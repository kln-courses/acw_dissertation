<plain_text><page sequence="1">MILTON'S PARADISE J. B. BROADBENT W E ARE coming to see Milton as a poet of his time, as much as Shakespeare and Donne. We no- tice that his materials were not, as a classi- cal tradition of scholarship had implied, predominantly antique but included the medieval, the Elizabethan, and the dis- tinctively seventeenth century. Of Mil- ton's interests in contemporary affairs, one of the strongest-and most typical of his period-was geography: it moved him to attempt a new and better textbook of historical geography, of which A Brief History of Muscovia, as we call it, was the beginning; and in poetry the interest was consummated when he linked the extem- poral and cosmic action of his epic with the present-day world by means of more, and more detailed, geographical references than ever Donne or even Marlowe had used. Paradise Lost is strewn with similes of contemporary travel, and the great place-name catalogues in Book XI and in Paradise Regained, Book III, were writ- ten to be both as epical and as topical as Hiroshima, Everest, and Westminster are today. Travel-book sources have been given for these passages in A. H. Gilbert's Geographical Dictionary of Milton (New Haven, 1919), and there are several briefer studies, listed in Professor R. R. Cawley's more comprehensive book, Mil- ton and the Literature of Travel (Princeton, 1951). But none of these investigators has re- vealed geographical facts behind poetic descriptions where actual places are not named or implied. The description of Paradise in Paradise Lost, Books IV, V, and IX, for instance, is explicitly geo- graphical only in the preliminary siting of Eden between Auran and Seleucia (IV, 211) and the similes of Orontes (1. 272) and Mount Amara (1. 280). These pas- sages have been commented on separate- ly; but in other details, and as a whole, Milton's Paradise seems to have been conceived by the fusion of literary tradi- tion with the reports of contemporary voyagers. If this be admitted, we have new grounds for a criticism of Milton's descriptive method, which has been at- tacked with special reference to Paradise. So I propose to offer some evidence to sup- port my theory that the place in the poem has a background of facts in the world and, because the geographical element is inseparable from the literary, to show how Milton used the facts to solve a peculiar artistic problem and to compare his Para- dise in other respects with various poetic descriptions of similar places. First, Paradise itself was to the Eliza- bethans both a literary tradition and a geographical hypothesis. The general characteristics were traditional-perpet- ual spring, trees that bloom and bear at once, and so forth. But places actually like this were being discovered and settled to east and west throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries; when they came across such fertile districts the ex- plorers often described them as "para- dises"; and many travelers to the East sought, with reasonable confidence, for the very site of Eden. As a result, poets tended to combine in their ideal gardens the traditional imaginative outline with real and newly discovered details. Thus descriptions which now seem artificial and [MODRN PHILOLOGY, February, 19541 160</page><page sequence="2">MILTON'S PARADISE 161 stereotyped were written and read with one eye on the object as it had been seen by the voyagers. In another book of his (Unpathed Waters [Princeton, 1940]), Professor Cawley explains the Elizabe- than idea of a "Terrestial Paradise";' and he quotes, from writers earlier than Mil- ton, prose and verse descriptions which in- clude the terms "odoriferous, nectar, balmy, ambrosia, sweet winds, melodious birds, pearly streams, golden fruit, stately cedars," and so on (pp. 8-11). Milton has all these and more; is he then just string- ing clich6s together? Take as example an- other stock item, "sands of Gold": Milton uses this at IV, 238, where it is linked with "Orient Pearl." Pearls, of course, both shone like the eastern sky and came from the Persian Gulf; similarly, the golden sands refer both to tradition and to the actual finds of gold prospectors. Mande- ville, for instance, describes "Paradys ter- restre," starting with the four rivers of Genesis, "of the whiche, the first is clept Phison or Ganges,... in the whiche Ryvere ben manye preciouse stones, and mochel of Lignfi Aloes, and moche gravelle of Gold."2 Mandeville admits never having been to Paradise; but the "gravelle of Gold" is not entirely his or Milton's imagination. In Hakluytus Post- humus,3 Purchas has similar phrases for gold-bearing streams, and in the geo- graphical context they sound quite nat- ural: "the Gulfe of Arabia," for instance, "where they found sand mingled with Gold," the margin giving "Golden Sand." And, even without the presence of ore, sand usually does look either golden or silver. Now Milton knew enough geography for him to have made his Paradise a highly realistic subtropical garden; and I shall show that in many other cases his descriptive details have the support of fact as well as of tradition. But the inter- esting critical point is that the facts do not obtrude: throughout the description there seems to be a compromise between fact and fancy, and also between naturalness and artifice, sense and idea. Milton strug- gled with a peculiar problem: his Garden had to be realistic enough to carry the main action of Paradise Lost-the card- board scenery of drama or the artifice and allegory of masque and interlude would not have been convincing at this point in the epic. But, at the same time, Paradise had to be fit for its inhabitants, still more than earthly and out of time and place; so it could not look too much like Bermuda or Virginia in the seventeenth century, and it had to be related to other heroic en- vironments in literature. Third, it had to be beautiful, but with a chaste and really unknowable beauty, like that of Adam and Eve themselves-beauty in its ideal perfection. These requirements, which we can analyze in retrospect, constituted a problem which Milton may have solved instinctively; but before we criticize his description of Paradise, it may be helpful to see it as the solution to this complex problem, because it is only in terms of the problem that we can understand the func- tion of the various elements in the descrip- tion. The first requirement, then, was real- ism; but a merely realistic paradise would not serve as an ideal. We have such a place in Waller's "Battel of the Summer Is- lands"; the description is drawn from travelers' reports and relies on contem- porary political interest in the Bermudas: Bermudas, walled with rocks, who does not know? [1. 4]. 1See also the chapter on "The Terrestial Para- dise" in S. Baring-Gould's Curious Myths of the Middle Ages (new ed.; London, Oxford, and Cambridge, 1877). 2 Voiage and Travaile (1725 ed.; reprinted, ed. J. O.

BROADBENT This indicates the familiarity of the is- lands, and Waller goes on to describe them in a manner appropriate to this familiarity: That happy island where huge lemons grow, And orange trees, which golden fruit do bear, The Hesperian garden boasts of none so fair; The lofty cedar, which to heaven aspires, Nature these cates with such a lavish hand Pours out among them For the kind spring, which but salutes us here, Inhabits there, and courts them all the year. Ripe fruits and blossoms on the same tree live. Milton, too, has his reference to the Hes- perian Gardens, his lofty cedars, lavish Nature, perpetual springs, and Blossoms and Fruits at once of golden hue [PL, IV, 147]. But his tone has entirely changed the sig- nificance of these things. Waller's Ber- mudas are familiar and real; realism was one necessary element in Milton's Para- dise; familiarity was not. Thus he has no "huge lemons"; in his golden apples there is no suggestion of their cash value to the colonist; he does not glance wryly at the rainy English weather; his comparison with the Hesperides is not impudent but solemn. So Paradise is kept at a distance in space and time, while the necessary realism is obtained by means more subtle than reportage: by the verse texture (which I shall deal with below) and par- ticularly by a subdued reliance on geo- graphical facts-some of the facts being characteristically abstruse. The physical details of Paradise were given, by the Bible and by tradition; but the travelers did their best to find them actually existing. Mandeville again had remarked that "in the moste highe place of Pardys, evene in the myddel place, is a welle, that casteth out the 4 Flodes, that rennen be dyverse Londes" (p. 304). But two centuries later a more reliable traveler saw towns in Morocco with a similar ir- rigation system: The south part of East Fez is almost halfe destitute of inhabitants: howbeit the gardens abound with fruites and flowers of all sortes. Euery garden hath .. a christall-fountaine enuironed with roses and other odoriferous flowers and herbes.... And well it may be called a Paradise .... Without the north, east, and south parts of the citie are great store of gardens, re- plenished with all kinds of fruite and with stately trees. Through the midst of these gardens, they deriue some small vaine of the riuer.4 Milton had read these descriptions, and it is perhaps as a result of them that his own description of the watering of Eden is more elaborate than Moses': for God had thrown That Mountain as his Garden mould high rais'd Upon the rapid current, which through veins Of porous Earth with kindly thirst up drawn, Rose a fresh Fountain, and with many a rill Waterd the Garden [PL, IV, 225]. Irrigation of this sort would not, of course, be peculiar to the north coast of Africa; but whatever place Milton had in mind, his description is here stiffened by the ref- erence to real horticulture. Again, the forbidden apples are bibli- cal, but travelers were often shown fruit claimed by the natives to be of the same species, as well as leaves large enough for Adam and Eve to have dressed in. Banan- as are suggested in Hakluytus Posthumus (VII, 332), and their case is supported by their aphrodisiac effect on women. But Leo Africanus was far from Mesopotamia 4 John Leo (Africanus), A Geographical HIistorie of Africa, trans. John Pory (London, 1600). References are to the reprint, ed. Robert Brown, for the Hakluyt Society (3 vols.; London, 1896), pp. 443 and 474 (consecutive pagination). For Milton's intimate knowledge of this and other travel books cited see the studies named on p. 160, above.</page><page sequence="4">MILTON'S PARADISE 163 when he found "a compound called Lhasis [hashish], whereof whosoeuer eateth but one ounce falleth a laughing, disporting, and dallying, as if he were halfe drunken; and is by the said confec- tion maruellously prouoked unto lust" (p. 722). As with new Wine intoxicated both They swim in mirth in Lust they burne: Till Adam thus 'gan Eve to dalliance move [PL, IX, 1008]. Milton described the fate of Paradise in the Flood with great vigor and unusual presence: Then shall this Mount Of Paradise by might of Waves be moovd Out of his place, push'd by the horned floud With all his verdure spoil'd, and Trees adrift Down the great River to the op'ning Gulf, And there take root an Iland salt and bare, The haunt of Seales and Orcs, and Sea-mews clang [PL, XI, 825]. The erosion is convincing, and its model might have been observed anywhere-in an English garden or a steep country lane; but the travel books provide it with a larger-scale background. Mandeville be- lieved that Paradise had survived the Flood; but the later voyagers often men- tioned huge logs floating down the flood- ing Euphrates, a phenomenon still noted by the nineteenth-century explorer Sir Alexander Burnes in his Travels into Bo- khara5 and used by Arnold for a simile in Sohrab and Rustum (1. 410). Islands of whales (orcs) and seals were also fre- quently described, as in Hakluytus Post- humus (XIX, 80); and Leo Africanus wrote about a whole series of islands off the coast of Africa, including "Mazua in forme like to an halfe moone" (p. 86), and "The island of salt, being destitute of all other liuing things, saue onely wild gotes" (p. 98). In the Persian Gulf itself, Ormus, famous market of pearls, stood on a simi- larly barren island: "This Island situate as is said at the mouth of the Gulf or Bay of Persia is ... barren of all necessaries except salt wherewith their very rocks are covered."6 Many of Leo's African islands are also bird sanctuaries, such as "the isles of Ascension.... They are all vnin- habited and desert, and haue vpon them infinite swarmes of a kinde of fowles of the bignes of duckes" (p. 93); and "the Isle of Tristan d'Acunna... it is full of birdes, and especially of sea-crowes or cor- morants" (p. 92). More certainly derived direct and per- haps solely from the travel books are some of Milton's animals. To us they are just a circus, but to his first readers they must have recalled the travelers' awkward de- scriptions of all kinds of beasts seen or reported in foreign countries, detailed with weird analogies and pictured on the maps and illustrations. The elephant was a great favorite, appearing on almost all maps of the East: . . hee is of a gentle disposition; and relying vpon his great strength he hurteth none but such as do him iniurie; only he will in a sport- ing manner gently heaue vp with his snowte such persons as he meeteth. He loueth the water beyond measure, and he will stand vp to the mid-body therein, bathing the ridge of his backe, and other parts with his long promuscis or trunke [Leo, p. 75]. th'unwieldy Elephant To make them mirth us'd all his might, and wreathd His Lithe Proboscis [PL, IV, 345]. We can see now why the elephant and some of the other animals do not quite fit into the description of Paradise: for us, in an age of zoos, they are too well known; for the seventeenth century they were 5 (3 vols.; London, 1834), I, 50. 6 Peter Heylyn, Cosmographie . . .

The interest aroused in this ele- phant is amusement and curiosity of the "Believe It or Not" kind, whereas Mil- ton's fiction ought to be stranger than fact. But more usually the details of Para- dise are supported by subdued and ideal- ized facts. The travelers themselves, of course, tended to exaggerate and poetize their descriptions; their geography books, like the Renaissance classical transla- tions, were not such raw materials as they later became. But the plainer statements of more recent travelers witness to the general veracity of the early voyagers, and perhaps the strongest evidence for the ex- istence of real facts behind Paradise lies in modern travel books. There are doubt- less many examples, but in his romance Gallions Reach (London, 1927), H. M. Tomlinson describes "the hull of a tower- ing berg, its flat summit dark with trees, but its walls bare and gleaming, as though of white marble" (p. 239). This mountain, full of tin, stands in the heart of the Malayan jungle, where the Renaissance explorers did not penetrate; but similar conditions could reproduce its shape and vegetation elsewhere. It shines like a beacon in the setting sun, and in daylight "Its walls ... appeared to overhang" (p. 241). We may compare a Rock Of Alablaster, pil'd up to the Clouds, Conspicuous farr, winding with one ascent Accessible from Earth, one entrance high; The rest was craggie cliff, that overhung Still as it rose, impossible to climbe [PL, IV, 543]. And there are still many bird-fluttered is- lands in the South Seas: a former Resident Commissioner of the Gilbert Islands de- scribes a peninsula on Makin-Meang, the haunted entrance to the abodes of death: "There was nothing in that empty waste to distinguish it from fifty other such promontories in the Gilbert Group. It was merely a blazing acre or two of coral rock shaken by bellowing surf and strident with the shrieks of swarming sea-birds."' It is noticeable that the author, like most modern travelers in really wild country, still takes naturally to personification. The travel books may have suggested other not explicitly geographical descrip- tions in Paradise Lost, notably those of Pandemonium, and of the various regions of Hell in Book II. But Paradise is the most certain and, so far, the least docu- mented case; it is also the most important critically. So much for the factual support which gives a quiet realism to Paradise. We have now to consider how the realistic is tem- pered with the ideal. Some of the devices are obvious-the stock phrases, which combine geographical fact with literary tradition; the references to the Hesperides and other imagined paradises; the dis- tancing effect of the Cape of Good Hope simile (PL, IV, 160); and the eclectic uni- versality of the expeditio starting with Persephone (1. 268). But there is also a more pervasive quality noted by Mr. Wil- son Knight in his essay on Milton in The Burning Oracle (London, New York, and Toronto, 1939). On page 83 he says that the descriptive method used for Paradise tends to harden and solidify what is more prop- erly flexible and yielding. The divine profusion is supposed to go beyond nature (IV. 207-8) but instead falls short of it. A certain de- liberating aestheticism insists on translating the natural into terms of human artistry, and you have excessive luxuriance side by side with a stony, carven immobility. 7 Arthur Grimble, A Pattern of Islands (London, 1952), p. 150; published in the United States as We Chose the Islands. The book has several interesting parallels between the Gilberts and Paradise, notably vegetation, the dignified manners of the natives, and (chap. viii) the Karongoan Creation Myth.</page><page sequence="6">MILTON'S PARADISE 165 Who is to judge of what is "properly" soft rather than hard? We shall notice below that Renaissance rhetorical theory held "deliberating aestheticism" to be proper to a topothesia.8 But, continuing to judge by our own standards, we may admit that there is some conflict between flexible real- ity and frozen artifice; and we should try to understand why. In some cases the gap is bridged: as we have seen, the hardness of "vegetable Gold. . . Saphire Fount... fruit burnisht with Golden Rinde" is partly the hardness of fact; if, never hav- ing seen such things ourselves, we forget what tropical vegetation looks like, we shall be fatigued by the glitter and blame it all on Milton's style. We must be able to place his "sands of Gold" in their own niche somewhere between the prospec- tors' real, nugget-laden streams and Donne's conventional "golden sands" of fancy in "The Bait." In other cases the hardness is due to linguistic change: "crisped" (PL, IV, 237) did not mean that the water was brittle but that the brooks had wavelets like curly hair; and "enameld" applied to flowers (IV, 149), which today suggests the hard whiteness of bathrooms and saucepans, meant to the seventeenth century the brilliant color used in miniatures and jewelry--it was the color rather than the hardness which took effect. Again, the "carven" quality of the verse and the things it describes helps to make real and solid a place that we must believe in; but real as a monument is real-immutable and formal in the Platonic sense. But this weightiness and the geographical realism had to be lightened: in the third draft for Paradise Lost in the Cambridge MS, Moses "tells [the audience] they cannot see Adam in the state of innocence by rea- son of their sin." As the scene in a tragedy, Paradise would have been described by a chorus, not represented on the stage. So, in the epic, geographical fact and even formal, monumental realism had to be tempered with "deliberating aestheti- cism." That is a vague and pejorative synonym for the artist's inevitable selec- tion and ordering of details; but Mr. Knight's objection is that in Milton's case it resulted in an inordinate number of "terms of human artistry." Here, cer- tainly, are some of them: a Lake, That to the fringed Bank with Myrtle crownd, Her chrystall mirror holds [PL, IV, 261]. the soft downie Bank damaskt with flours [1. 333]. close the Serpent sly Insinuating, wove with Gordian twine His breaded train [1. 347]. the roofe Of thickest covert was inwoven shade Laurel and Mirtle [1. 692]. each beauteous flour, Iris all hues, Roses, and Gessamin Rear'd high thir flourisht heads between, and wrought Mosaic; underfoot the Violet, Crocus, and Hyacinth, with rich inlay Broiderd the ground, more colour'd then with stone Of costliest Emblem [11. 697 ff.]. The artifice is not, of course, peculiar to Milton; these are all drawn from the lit- erary tradition.9 But why did he use them? Apart from the very good reasons of decorum and the countering of geo- graphical realism, there is another reason which still has critical force today: these artifacts hint that Adam and Eve in their 8 See Rosemund Tuve, Elizabethan and Metaphysi- cal Imagery (Chicago and London, 1947), passim, and other studies of Renaissance rhetoric and the rheto- ricians themselves. On p. 102 Miss Tuve suggests that the Cave of Morpheus posed for Spenser a prob- lem similar to the one being discussed here: It "must be at once as literal as Gulliver's reports and as re- mote as myth," but, of course, for different reasons. 9 Note that to have used the names of unfamiliar tropical flowers would have caused a distracting curiosity, like the elephant.</page><page sequence="7">166 J. B. BROADBENT natural state were provided with as much curious art and luxurious decoration as the king and queen of any human palace. Their majesty is insisted on, but it is inde- pendent of man-made pomp and accouter- ments; just as they are "with native Honour clad In naked Majesty" (PL, IV, 289), so their dwelling place, and espe- cially their bower, are sumptuously adorned by Nature. What is to fallen man the essential inconsistency of Paradise is precisely indicated by those oxymorons of "naked Majesty" and "native Honour." Mr. Knight complains that this "divine profusion is supposed to go beyond nature but instead falls short of it" in being arti- ficial-that is, unnatural. But the super- natural is to us unnatural; and Milton tries to suggest the power of unfallen Na- ture by making her provide not only raw but finished products as well-damascene work, mosaic, and so on. Yet he insists that even these strange glories are en- tirely natural, for they are the miracles of prelapsarian Nature: Flours worthy of Paradise which not nice Art In Beds and curious Knots, but Nature boon Powrd forth profuse on Hill and Dale and Plaine [PL, IV, 241]. The negative, as so often in Milton's po- etry, is weak and suggests that he was ac- tually thinking in terms of regulated flower beds; and later Adam wants to sweep up Those Blosoms also, and those dropping Gumms, That lie bestrowne unsightly and unsmooth [PL, IV, 630], thus making Paradise an unnaturally tidy garden; but that is a structural fault due to the difficulty of finding anything for Adam and Eve to do in a state of perfect Nature. The fact remains that Milton conceived and tried to express his Para- dise as the work of Nature (i.e., God the gardener) alone. This is not so in all literary paradises. Elsewhere (p. 86) Mr. Knight complains that Paradise is too baroque for its charac- ters; yet it is much less baroque than, say, Marvell's "Bermudas": He gives us this eternal Spring Which here enamells every thing; He hangs in shades the Orange bright Like golden Lamps in a green Night. And does in the Pomgranates close Jewels more rich than Ormus shows [ll. 13 ff.]. Marvell is also emphasizing the all-provi- dence of Bermudan Nature; but Milton could hardly do it by making God a Mas- ter of Ceremonies or a Levantine jewel merchant. Again, in the Bower of Bliss Spenser uses the baroque to environ sin. The Bower is favorably compared with Eden (FQ, II, xii, 52); but it is utterly artificial, with a gate of ivory, grapes ripe like ruby and green as emerald, with others of real gold "So made by art to beautify the rest"; there is a fountain of crystal statuary adorned with imitation ivy made of beaten gold, and so on. This flashy opulence is like that of the golden garden of the Incas, with its "flowers and trees of gold and silver" described in Hakluyt's Principal Navigations.1o There are similarly baroque paradises in Phineas Fletcher's Purple Island and in Brittain's Ida (1628) and other seventeenth-century poems. But Milton rejected this model: though it had the realistic support of the Incas, it was too artificial. His Paradise was a garden planted by God, Spenser's Bower a man-made pleasure-park. The Bower is goodly beautifide With all the ornaments of Floraes pride, Wherewith her mother Art, as halfe in scorne Of niggard Nature, like a pompous bride Did decke her, and too lavishly adorne [FQ, II, xii, 50]. 10 (London, 1589; reprinted in 12 vols.; Glasgow, 1903-5), VII, 288.</page><page sequence="8">MILTON'S PARADISE 167 These lines are comparable to Heylyn's lyrical outburst over the African town of Fez: "A City so beautiful and well seated, as if Nature and art had plaid the wan- tons, and brought this forth as the fruit of their Dalliance" (IV, 33b). Spenser re- marks: One would have thought (so cunningly the rude And scorned partes were mingled with the fine,) That Nature had for wantonesse ensude Art, and that Art at Nature did repine; So striving each th'other to undermine, Each did the others work more beautify [FQ, II, xii, 59]. Here Nature and Art co-operate;'1 in Mil- ton's Paradise they unite. Similarly, Spen- ser's Happy Isle, "a second paradise" (FQ, IV, x, 23) for true lovers and true friends, is not entirely natural, although it is sinless: all that Nature did omit, Art, playing second Natures part, supplyed it [1. 21]. But in the Garden of Adonis, Spenser has a paradise which is both sinless and completely natural: Adonis' arbor is not by art, But of the trees owne inclination made [FQ, III, vi, 44]; and several of the descriptive phrases are echoed in Paradise Lost-"fresh colours decke the wanton pryme... sweet gum did drop... With wanton yvie-twine entrayld," and so on. Indeed, this "Para- dize" (11. 29, also 43) is more natural than Milton's; but it is not a real place. The inhabitants are shadowy supernatures and personifications living in a garden of al- legory. It is a limbo of discarnate souls waiting for the gardener Genius to clothe them "with sinfull mire" from the "end- less rancks" (1. 35) of physical forms which constitute the flower beds. This treatment is integral to the Faerie Queene, but Mil- ton's Paradise is not primarily allegorical. It is a real place, the home not of deities and abstractions but of Milton's only hu- man characters. Therefore, the fanciful must be avoided as carefully as realism is kept at an ideal distance. Milton had de- scribed his own Garden of Adonis in the epilogue to Comus: it, too, is paradisal, with "the golden tree," "eternal Sum- mer," And West winds, with musky wing About the cedar'n alleys fling Nard, and Cassia's balmy smells. Iris there with humid bow Waters the odorous banks that blow Flowers of more mingl'd hew Then her purfl'd scarf can shew [11. 989]. The fancifulness, together with the more natural details (e.g., "musky"), belongs to the witchlike verse of the epilogue, just as the slacker, less sensitive, and more sol- emn Groves whose rich Trees wept odorous Gumms and Balme [PL, IV, 248] is proper to Paradise. One is an incanta- tion, the other a declamation. A much closer parallel than the Garden of Adonis is the plateau "Paradise" in Drayton's Endimion &amp; Phoebe. Here, in 1595, are most of Milton's stock proper- ties: mazy rivulets "Whose silver sand with orient Pearle was strewed" (1. 50), tufted cedars, named flowers, murmuring Zephyr, musical birds, and "golden Cit- rons"- More glorious then the precious fruite were these, Kept by the Dragon in Hesperides [11. 41 f.]. This also is the scene of innocent love; it is described with delicacy; but the charac- 11 Spenser's two passages here use the terms of Renaissance theory about the relationship between the poet and nature. It is interesting to compare the second passage, pointing out the possibility of too much ordering and embellishment--"beautify- ing"---of nature, with Miss Tuve's thesis (chaps. vi and vii, sec. 1).</page><page sequence="9">168 J. B. BROADBENT ters, though mythical, are treated more realistically than Spenser's Time, Pleas- ure, and the rest; and the allegorical meaning of the myth is not brought for- ward. Drayton is simpler than Milton and more explicit about the problems of Na- ture and artifice, myth and reality; so his poetry can help us at this point. For in- stance, Drayton explains something of the value of the stock characteristics of a paradisal scene by telling us the symbolic significance of certain details: Phoebus greene Laurell florisht in the shade: Faire Venus Mirtile, Mars his warlike Fyrre, Minervas Olive, and the weeping Myrhe, The patient Palme, which thrives in spite of hate, The Popler, to Alcides consecrate [1l. 30 ff.]. Milton merely names these trees (PL, IV, 139; IX, 435; etc.), but Drayton's man- agement of these and other conventional materials suggests that Milton's Paradise, too, must be considered not as a particular place but as an archetype, where any of the topographical details may have sym- bolic force. In Paradise the symbolism is subdued; but the meanest preacher could easily turn out a sermon on the under- ground river of divine grace, which, pour- ing through the soil of the human heart, issues again as four virtues of such strength that they take effect far from their heavenly source and themselves act as channels of blessing in "many a famous Realme" (PL, IV, 234). Second, Drayton also supports his mythical garden with geography, negatively and on a smaller scale than Milton, but still with the effect of holding on to reality even while trying to surpass it: the trees which on this Mountaine grew, As yet the like Arabia never knew [1. 17]; and the golden oranges and lemons are "More glorious then" gorgious Arras in rich colours wrought, With silke from Affrick, or from Indie brought [1. 43]. Third, Drayton shows very clearly what the Renaissance feeling was about the op- position of Nature and Art: Upon this Mount there stood a stately Grove, Whose reaching armes, to clip the Welkin strove, Of tufted Cedars, and the branching Pine, Whose bushy tops themselves doe so intwine, As seem'd when Nature first this work begun, She then conspir'd against the piercing Sun; Under whose covert (thus divinely made) [ll. 23 ff.]. Just as in Paradise Nature makes "the unpierc't shade" (PL, IV, 245), so here she makes the canopy of trees; and her work is "divine," as in Paradise the nup- tial bower has been framed by "the sovran Planter" (PL, IV, 691). When Nature produces an artifact, she is mani- festing God's creative power; and that, of course, is not limited to what our jaded taste accepts as "natural"; indeed, like poetry, the more artificial Nature's works appear, the more they illustrate the power of an anthropomorphic God.12 It was the mathematical order of the universe, not its senseless vastness, which was signifi- cant to the Renaissance: chaos, by defini- tion, was Godless, disorderly, and unnatu- ral-Nature "first begins Her fardest verge" where Chaos ends (PL, II, 1036). So it is that in Endimion we have Nature 12 Note the conventional epithets, shared by Milton-"stately," "tufted," "branching," "bushy," etc., and the generalization of "grove." Commenting on the use of "grove" as an example of generaliza- tion in eighteenth-century poetry, Mr. Donald Davie remarks that "a grove is planted, and to see all groups of trees as groves is to see them all in the park of a creator-god. Hence this generalization implies a view of the natural creation as a divinely ordered hierarchy" (Purity of Diction in English Verse [Lon- don, 1952], p. 43). Mr. Davie does not seem to make clear, though, that this method reaches back from the age of Johnson beyond Drayton; but many of his fine appreciations on these lines apply equally well to Renaissance diction.</page><page sequence="10">MILTON'S PARADISE 169 as the provider not only of a perhaps acci- dental parasol, such as we may see any day in a country lane, but also of another sylvan scene whose beauty resides in form and artifice: Which [trees] Nature in such order has dis- posed, And there-withall these goodly walks inclosed, As serv'd for hangings and rich Tapestry, To beautifie this stately Gallery: Imbraudring these in curious trailes along, The clustered Grapes, the golden Citrons hung, More glorious then gorgious Arras in rich colors wrought, With silke from Affrick, or from Indie brought [11. 35 ff.]. We realize from the approving tone of the verse that the trees are not demeaned by the image of interior decoration: Nature is consummated in art. Drayton and his contemporaries probably knew more about the facts of Nature's tooth and claw than Wordsworth or Tennyson-cer- tainly more than we, centrally heated, do; they described Nature in terms of art pre- cisely because they were poets. The real thing is there for the looking: why bother to transpose it? The result is not a photo- graph of Nature, but a reflection or imita- tion of her. Commenting on some of Drayton's lines, Miss Tuve admits that the lack of realistic accidents does make the description "in a sense unnatural" (p. 151); but, she asks, does that make it any the less "true" in the poem? "Renaissance poets, as aware as we are that neither evil nor opulent splendor occurs in the world of fact in quite such pure and rarefied form, yet endeavor constantly-with im- ages-to make such 'things in their es- sence' real to us." Drayton and especially Milton were in any case not describing real places but ideal paradises. We may dislike the "terms of human artifice" and the "deliberating aestheticism"; but as serious critics we should recognize that they are merely signs telling us that this is not a versified photograph but the expres- sion of the paradisal essence-that is, a state of supernature in which unfallen Man enjoys divinely ordered gifts sur- passing anything that either fallen Man or fallen Nature can now provide. We must also remember that the de- scription of Paradise is only a preliminary to the entrance of its inhabitants; it must suit them, and they are not "natural" in our sense, neither as savages are natural, nor as civilized men affect candor and bonhomie. They are carefully placed at the climax of description: the general loca- tion and physical shape of the Garden are first given; then details of its watering and vegetation; finally, at IV, 266, we have the faint fantasy of Pan and the Graces, fol- lowed by the distancing expeditio of Per- sephone, the Nyseian Isle, etc. Thus re- moved from the Garden to the realms of myth, we are suddenly brought back to the solid life of Two of far nobler shape erect and tall, Godlike erect, with native Honour clad In naked Majestie seemd Lords of all, And worthie seemd, for in thir looks Divine The image of thir glorious Maker shon, Truth, Wisdom, Sanctitude severe and pure, Severe, but in true filial freedom plac't [PL, IV, 288]. This generalized, intellectual, and formal approach to Adam and Eve; their separa- tion from the vegetation; the emphasis on stature rather than flesh; and the stately movement of the verse as they process through the Garden, indicate what man- ner of people these are, and what sort of place Paradise is. The Garden fades be- hind the awful severity of that first de- scription of Adam and Eve into a mere setting for them. It is not baroque, but neither is it a jungle, because the simplic- ity of Adam and Eve is not rustic or child-</page><page sequence="11">170 J. B. BROADBENT ish; as his conversation shows, Adam's in- nocence is rather moral than intellectual. He and the woman are not Neanderthal Man but "our first Parents"; and the po- etry puts us in our place as their children, bound by the fifth Commandment. They address each other with elaborate cour- tesy; and when Adam goes out to meet his archangelic guest, he is not stark naked and meanly alone, but accompanied with his own compleat Perfections, in himself was all his state, More solemn then the tedious pomp that waits On Princes [PL, V, 352]. More solemn-these are not noble sav- ages, but natural aristocrats: Adam a Renaissance soldier-poet-philosopher with his clothes off and without the pox; Eve a peeress minus petticoats-neither a fe- male savage nor a pastoral milkmaid, but virgin, matron, mother, and queen at once. We tend, of course, to equate sim- plicity with casualness, open-necked shirts; Milton did not. Had he been asked, "When Adam delved and Eve span, Who was then the gentleman?" he would un- doubtedly have replied, "Adam-and Eve his lady." Dignity of posture, grace of movement, and courtesy of address may have lost their proper function in the eighteenth century and become a nuisance in the twentieth; but they are normal in primitive peoples. They also constitute just the code of behavior likely to be habitual in creatures made by the God of Paradise Lost: he would not have created a riot of vegetables and a pair of suburban week-enders. Nevertheless, this countering of realism with artifice does leave a crack in the de- scription. Fancy and allegory that would have been at home in Spenser's Garden of Adonis do intrude with the dance of Pan with the Hours and Graces (PL, IV, 266; see also V, 394), and we feel it to be out of place, like cherubs in a portrait. And Mr. Knight is perhaps fair so far as he com- plains that the artifice outweighs the na- ture. But the balance appears to be struck more evenly when we know about the geographical background; and the final result is more justly appreciated when we recognize the problems involved. There is, thirdly, the problem of sen- suousness. Take away the fanciful, subdue the realistic with the artificial, yet insist on the physical presence of the Garden and its inhabitants, and you have little choice but to describe them in terms of the senses. But in Paradise Lost, Book IV, al- though the senses are offered satisfaction, we are not sensuously satisfied as we read. Smell, touch, taste, have their objects in odorous sweets, "the smell of field and grove," "Grots and Caves of coole recess," fruits "of delicious taste," and so on; but we are left to turn these words into sen- sations, for the poet does not communi- cate the experience itself. Yet Milton had done so before, as in Comus' speech on the bounties of Nature; who set to work millions of spinning Worms, That in their green shops weave the smooth- hair'd silk To deck her Sons, and that no corner might Be vacant of her plenty, in her own loyns She hutch'd th'all-worshipt ore, and previous gems To store her children with; Th'earth cumber'd, and the wing'd air dark't with plumes, The herds would over-multitude their Lords, The Sea o'refraught would swell, and th'un- sought diamonds Would so emblaze the forehead of the Deep, And so bestudd with Stars, that they below Would grow inur'd to light [1l. 715 ff.]. Here the conception of Nature as all- provident, of jewelry as well as of food, is eminently successful and shows none of the strain of Paradise Lost; but it suc- ceeds through a communication of sense-</page><page sequence="12">MILTON'S PARADISE 171 experience too direct and too rich for Adam and Eve. We have at this point the other main criticism leveled against Mil- ton's Paradise: in Revaluation,13 Dr. Leavis points out that Paradise Lost as a whole suffers from "a certain sensuous poverty" which is exemplified even in the comparatively sensuous description of Paradise; Book IV altogether lacks the "sensuous richness" of Comus. The dis- tinction is just; but what is the signifi- cance of the difference? Not that Milton's sensibility had coagulated: his description of Creation in Book VII, though some- times artificial and fanciful, has in places the rhythm, diction, and particularized sensuousness of Comus' speech (e.g., the fish, 11. 309 ff.). The point surely is that in Paradise the details are not so sensuously rich because sensuousness would have been out of place: these are the riches of God. Further, Comus is more than sen- suously rich: the subject of the speech is a degraded Epicureanism; it is an argu- ment, hyperbolical, persuasive, "deer Wit, and gay Rhetorick," as the Lady calls it (1. 790), based on the not merely sensuous but sensual description of an al- most obscene fecundity; it attacks tem- perance in order to strike deeper, at chas- tity-and so uses sexual connotations, such as the "spawn innumerable," "the smooth-hair'd silk" of worms, and Nature personified as a lavishly teeming mother. This is a celebration of promiscuity, char- acteristically spoken in a dramatic poem by the offspring of Bacchus and Circe; the other is an objective description in an epic of the nature of Paradise as the abode of unfallen Man. We can see the difference very clearly by noting that the ecstatic tone of the Comus passage had its own parallels in the travel books-the reports from Virginia, for instance, claiming that the fertility of the place made it ideal for colonization: "But the Earth (fruitful Mother of Mankind) she is prodigiously prodigal, in fatnesse of the soile" (Hak. Post., XIX, 245); and the prospector goes on to catalogue the animal, vegetable, and mineral resources of Virginia very much as Comus does those of the world, with a long dissertation on silkworms and the mulberry. Hakluyt reports a similarly ur- gent description in Principal Navigations, VI, 164-73. Milton may have used some of these facts about Virginia in Paradise Lost; but he could not there use the en- thusiastic tone of the voyagers-it would have been as out of place in Paradise as the prolixity of Comus' fish and the eco- nomic geography of "green shops." There is not yet any question of tempting Adam and Eve out of their nuptial chastity, and the Garden, too, must be chaste. There could therefore be no reaction from the inappropriateness of a completely natural jungle to the other extreme of a tinsel pleasure-garden. The baroque easily provokes sensuality--even in religious art it goes with a hysterical, almost erotic, sainthood. As a setting, the baroque de- mands characters such as the "Two naked Damzelles" in the Bower of Bliss, whom we are not surprised to find playing peek- a-boo in the crystal fountain, quite at home amongst ivy leaves of beaten gold. One coyly hid herself, the other her two lilly paps aloft displayd, And all, that might his melting hart entyse To her delights, she unto him bewrayd; The rest, hidd underneath, him more desirous made [FQ, II, xii, 66]. Milton will have no strip tease: Nor those mysterious parts were then con- ceald, Then was not guiltie shame, dishonest shame Of natures works, honor disonorable [PL, IV, 312]. It is true that Spenser's Happy Isle is not sensual, but we may notice that he does is (London and Toronto, 1936), pp. 47 ff.</page><page sequence="13">172 J. B. BROADBENT not describe the body of Adonis there-- perhaps it would have shattered the ideal atmosphere. We can see how far sen- suousness can be taken in Keats's descrip- tion of Adonis: Sideway his face repos'd On one white arm, and tenderly unclos'd, By tenderest pressure, a faint damask mouth To slumbery pout [Endymion, II, 403]. We are made to feel the dent in his flesh; compared with this, Adam and Eve at their most sensuous are made of marble.14 And this lack of sensuous softness is very necessary in the description of a solitary naked man and woman-a breath of sen- suousness could so easily become sen- suality and turn their Paradise into the Mohammedan sort, described piecemeal in the Koran and summarized by the travelers of the Renaissance; Heylyn says it is "a place of all Delights, adorned with flowry Fields, waterd with Chrystalline Rivers, beautified with Trees of Gold, un- der whose cool shade they shall spend their time with amorous Virgins. . .and those to have their Virginities renewed, as fast as lost" (III, 104b). And Purchas de- scribes how the godfearing "shall be ac- companied with many Maidens, beauti- full as the Hyacinth and Pearles, neuer deflowred of men or Devils, neuer men- struous, sitting in pleasant shades with their eyes fixed on their husbands.... Maidens likewise with pretty brests."'5 Milton reserved oriental splendor for Satan. But just as, in the description of their setting, the fusion of real and ideal, nat- ural and artificial, is not complete, so with Adam and Eve themselves the com- promise with sensuousness is not wholly successful. Dr. C. S. Lewis has objected to the sexuality of "sweet reluctant amorous delay" and the lovemaking passage.16 But even there Adam and Eve are still Michelangelic figures; their flesh has that massiveness which expresses an inter- est not in secondary sexual characteristics as such, but in physical form as the object of aesthetic contemplation-the play of muscle, swell of breast, weight and tint of hair-so far as these two attitudes can ever be separated. The separation is not easy--if desirable-for either poets or readers, unless they have been trained in the life-class or the ballet school; and Mil- ton did not attain complete objectivity. But he did attempt this impossible task of describing unfallen sexuality; and the im- portant thing for us is that his attempt is reflected in his management of Paradise as a setting for those bodies. Yet the sexual motif does appear, dis- guised, in the description of the Garden itself. Dr. C. S. Lewis has noted (p. 47) the "hairie sides" (PL, IV, 315) of the mountain; and it is possible to take the whole description as an allegory of the human body--e.g., "Access deni'd" (IV, 317), the personifications in general, and in Book V the recurring imagery of Sun: Earth::male:female, and vine-elm:lov- ers.17 This is not surprising in a period which produced The Purple Island and Mansoul and Donne's Elegy xviii. But, like the possible symbolism of the flowers and rivers, the allegory is faint and its sensual connotations deeply subdued. However, if we notice it, it does soften the hardness complained of by Mr. Wilson Knight: the flowers are enameled, but the bank of the lake is "fringed" like a wom- an's head gazing in her mirror (PL, IV, 14 Drayton describes Phoebe and Endimion sensu- ously but does not reproduce the feel of their flesh, as Keats does. It is a question of intensity of sensation. 1i Purchas His Pilgrimage (4th ed.; London, 1626), pp. 253-54. 16 A Preface to "Paradise Lost" (London, New York, and Toronto, 1942), pp. 119-20. 17 Cf. the section on "Sexual Cosmogony" in M. Saurat's discussion of the link between Milton and Fludd in Milton, Man and Thinker (2d ed.; London, 1944), p. 257.</page><page sequence="14">MILTON'S PARADISE 173 262), and Eve's hair "in wanton ringlets wav'd As the Vine curls her tendrils" (1. 306). The description of Paradise is, then, a compromise. Of Milton's three main scenes in the epic, it was the most difficult to describe. Heaven and Hell were out of this world and their inhabitants supernat- ural, so that the problems of realism and naturalness did not so forcibly arise. But Paradise, in this world, was yet not of it; and its creatures, though human, still re- tained the divine impress. It is useful to put the Garden in its dramatic context in this way, because these three levels of scene are emphatically distinguished throughout the poem and correspond to different levels of motive, action, nature, and character. Each has its peculiar phys- ical properties: Hell is predominantly deep and dark; in contrast, Heaven is little else but high and bright. Between them lies Paradise, where we return to our own level to find a world fully furnished by Nature, in contrast to the vacuity of Heaven and the barrenness of Hell. It is a world where Nature is Art: this again contrasts with Hell, where the devils have to dig and build because Nature is not so boon (in Paradise, Adam is similarly re- duced to technology after the Fall-PL, X, 1062 ff.), and with Heaven, where sci- ence and labor are unnecessary in the presence of an all-provident Creator. Again, there is in Paradise a balance of order against disorder; objecting to it, Mr. Knight describes it precisely as "ex- cessive luxuriance side by side with a stony, carven immobility." They are not fully reconciled, as they should have been; but the mere coexistence of riot and rigor, however precariously balanced, contrasts with the flaming shattered chaos of Hell and the frozen, theatrical discipline of Heaven. In Hell, Satan strides giganti- cally about his domain ordering devils to swarm and fly, parade and consult-all is action and movement. In Heaven, God sits immobile at the still center of concen- tric globes of hymning angels-a model of the solar system, the ideal hierarchy. But in Paradise the hellish bustle is tamed and the celestial frigidity melted: Adam and Eve do things-prune trees, make love, eat, and sleep-but do them with a quiet dignity unknown in Hell and with more freedom than the angels appear to enjoy. The details and tone of the scenic descrip- tion of Paradise are appropriate to the nature of the place; its peculiarities as a garden are strictly functional and related to its inhabitants. But Paradise ceases to function in this way after the Fall. Beforehand, there are sinister hints of what is to come-in an- ticipatory similes (as of Persephone), and in the metallic beauties of the vegetation perhaps a suggestion that this is a poison- ous garden. For the actual apple-eating in Book IX the glories of the place are stressed-that is part of the tragedy. But Paradise as a scene drops out of the poem at Book X and does not reappear until, as a distant piece of topography, it is swept away by the Flood in Book XI. As a re- sult, Adam suffers his agony without a Gethsemane. We are justified in expecting one, because up to this point the major speeches in the poem, however abstract in content, have very properly been sup- ported by definite physical (or celestial) background; and because, by failing to give it the background of a fallen Para- dise, Milton misses a chance of stressing the relation between Adam's lament at X, 720 ff., and the Son's self-sacrificial offer at III, 236 ff., and the greater Adam's agony in the garden as described in the Gospels.18 18 Cf. especially the discussions in both Adam's and the Son's speeches of the extent of Death's power, and the emphasis both they and Eve place on "me" as the object of the curse (X, 822, 824, 827, 832,</page><page sequence="15">174 J. B. BROADBENT This lack of a setting for Adam's grief and Eve's penitence may be defended on several grounds. First, the change that comes over the earth at the Fall is indi- cated at IX, 782 and 1000, and described elaborately at X, 651-714, immediately before Adam's lament. However, it does not effectually alter Paradise: the descrip- tion is not local but large-scale, astronom- ical, and meteorological, in terms of the Creation in Book VII rather than of Para- dise as displayed in Books IV, V, and IX. But this accords with the tradition that Paradise itself was not affected by the Fall, and Milton follows the same line by not finally destroying Paradise until the Flood (XI, 825 ff.). But the following of a tradition does not excuse dramatic weak- ness; and in any case the tradition is broken in several places, notably when Adam complains of Th'inclement Seasons, Rain, Ice, Hail and Snow, Which now the Skie with various Face begins To shew us in this Mountain, while the Winds Blow moist and keen, shattering the graceful locks Of these fair spreading Trees [PL, X, 1063 (my italics)]. A second defense might be that in Book X the warning of tragic notes to come (IX, 6) is fulfilled in form as well as con- tent, by a deliberate rejection of narrative description and the use of a bare stage on which the protagonist suffers alone, as in Samson Agonistes. But the effect, of some- thing lacking in what is still an epic, re- mains the same; and again there would be inconsistency, for in Book IX, where the tragic notes ostensibly begin and where there are some obvious relics of a dramatic draft, there is no lack of scenery in Para- dise. Third, it might be held that the fading- out of Paradise as a place indicates the fading in Adam and Eve of a paradisal state of innocence and peace: the raison d'Atre of the description of Paradise, as a garden for unfallen man and woman, hav- ing gone, the garden goes too. But this is a negative method, and it is particularly in the delineation of the fallen state of mind that an objective correlative would have been helpful. Milton does try to provide it, but his lines seem halfhearted; perhaps he was worried by doubt as to whether the change affected Paradise and, if so, whether Adam would have noticed it in his hiding place: these were from without The growing miseries, which Adam saw Alreadie in part, though hid in gloomiest shade, To sorrow abandond, but worse felt within [PL, X, 715]. It is the same for us: we hear Adam, but see him only "in part" because the per- spective has been lengthened too far. The lack of dramatic intimacy here is obvious when we remember the poignant detail in Book IX of how, when Adam met Eve coming from her sin, From his slack hand the Garland wreath'd for Eve Down drop'd, and all the faded Roses shed [1. 892]. This again runs against the tradition of the immunity of Paradise from decay; but the inconsistency is far outweighed by the realizing power of the lines. A last defense might be that in the long description of the effects of the Fall on the earth our perspective is lengthened on purpose to prepare us for the world view of Books XI and XII. Paradise no longer matters as a place, it is already lost; our interest must be directed to the future of 929 ft.; III, 237, 238, 241). The comparison between Paradise and Gethsemane is made explicitly by Giles Fletcher in Christ's Triumph over Death (Lon- don, 1610; reprinted in Poetical Works of G. and P. Fletcher, ed. F. S. Boas [2 vols.; Cambridge, 1908-91), stanza 14.</page><page sequence="16">MILTON'S PARADISE 175 fallen humanity and Paradise regained. So we are shown the Fall taking its effect over the earth as a planet, and on "Man" (X, 713) rather than on Adam. But to accept this reason as a justification we should have to agree further on the structural merits of the last two books in relation to the whole work. I would, however, suggest a deeper rea- son than these for the abandonment of Paradise. While structural expediency, the following of tradition, and so on may in part have caused Milton to drop Para- dise out of the poem after the Fall, the chief cause was perhaps the habitual homogeneity and inflexibility of his own descriptive method. These characteristics, inherent in his Paradise from the start, prevented him at the end from changing it in accordance with the Fall. The de- scription of Paradise is a mosaic of sealed patterns: its details-flowery banks, sands of gold, and the rest-are linguistically the same as those used in different scenes described by Spenser, Drayton, Waller, Marvell, the geographers, and Milton himself in earlier work. To design them into a Paradise fit for his epic, Milton cast them in a certain mold, tempering arti- ficiality with geographical fact, and ex- pressed them in a new verse form and with an uplifted tone: it is this shape that gives to the conventional material its new sig- nificance. The result is excellent but, like a mosaic, rigid; the parts cannot be read- justed to suit altered circumstances, so that when a change such as the Fall does come, the pattern must either defiantly stay the same or be dropped from use or be broken. In this case Milton let the pat- tern fade from sight for a book and a half and then broke it with the Flood. That is perhaps a fault; but it leads to a final consideration. Paradise is created out of familiar materials, both Milton's own and others brought in from outside. What is it that holds them together as a picture of a unique Paradise? In the first place, such a fusion of materials presented less difficulty to the seventeenth-century mind than it does to us. We have so dissociated Eden and Virginia, fact and fiction, geog- raphy and poetry, that it takes an effort of learning and imagination to put them to- gether again; and we have to decide for ourselves whether it is worth trying to as- sume a different apperception in order to appreciate the special goodness of Para- dise Lost--for no amount of critical analy- sis can do it for us entirely. Further, an appreciation based on our own sensitivity to language and rhythm will not be enough unless it is supported by knowl- edge, both literary and linguistic; for the fusion in Paradise is not, as in some seven- teenth-century lyric and dramatic poetry, evident in many single phrases or in syn- aesthetic imagery. In "vegetable Gold," for instance, there is, as Dr. Leavis says (p. 50), not "the same kind of fusion as 'green shops' " from the Comus speech."1 The fusion is more intellectual: "vege- table," as with Marvell, means not cab- bagey, but of the essence of cabbages-- life, vigor, growth, increase. But there is a larger fusion than this verbal-intellectual one. The explorers' top- ical reports of Africa, India, and America are indissolubly fused with the literary de- scriptions of a Terrestial Paradise, Garden of Love, or Happy Isle; these again derive details from the classical ideals, which are themselves models of our own vague indi- vidual notions of some Garden of Child- hood-what Eliot calls "our first world" ("Burnt Norton," I); and behind them all is the Eden of Genesis, projecting itself into the seventeenth century with the force of literal fact. The verse does not al- 10 "Green shops" also has the intellectual sugges- tion of silkworms' cash value, of course; and the grow- ing gold suggests coral, which the travelers called "rocks that grow."</page><page sequence="17">176 J. B. BROADBENT ways support this fusion of concepts: when Milton is using the ideal literary and classical elements, or forming a simile, his verse often takes on a suppler rhythm and a nostalgic note; whereas in the passages which rely on geography or the Bible it in- clines to an ineffable confidence-too rigid for our taste today, perhaps, but doing its necessary job of declaring that about this myth there can be no doubt at all; we hear this note in such a calm state- ment of the impossible as Flours of all hue, and without Thorn the Rose [PL, IV, 256]. But sometimes these two different kinds of verse are themselves fused with the elements they describe. This com- plete synthesis is to be seen in a passage which Dr. Leavis finds particularly offen- sive (p. 51): Groves whose rich Trees wept Odorous Gums and Balme, Others whose fruit burnisht with Golden Rinde Hung amiable, Hesperian Fables true, If true, here onely, and of delicious taste [PL, IV, 248]. As Dr. Leavis suggests, this is "at low ten- sion," the slow march of the Grand Style. But slow marching has its own impres- siveness, and the effect of ease is the result of taut control (as anybody knows who has had to do both, slow marching is much harder than doubling, in the long run). Here the lazy movement of the verse, the slackness of the syntax, have their func- tion. We are offered, casually, the sensa- tions proper to Paradise-sweet smell, smooth touch, golden color-directly and externally, because we are viewing Para- dise from the outside in space and time, not experiencing it. Then suddenly we are withdrawn into the world of romance and invited, with a sigh, to consider the Hes- perian fables; but before the perhaps closer familiarity of that myth can dis- tract us, we are recalled, by the curious syntactical hiatus, to taste the fatal fruit. And the taste is left in our mouths, not by synaesthesia or sensuous appeal, as if Keats were writing, but by the manipula- tion of syntax and rhythm about unexcit- ing and well-worn verbal units. There is here a completely successful fusion of fact with fiction, sense with intellect, and it is expressed in the verse texture. The com- pound is loose and unstable, and it is not typical of the description; but it does indi- cate the characteristic quality of what Milton was trying to do: not to force on us the personal paradisal vision of one man, but rather to distil to an essence all the variegated conceptions that men have ever held of Paradise.
