[The biological idea of structure extends in psychological application "only to the implication of a specific kind of complexity: beyond that it is irrele- vant and inapplicable ". The biological idea of function is, without any question, " applicable in a general way to the life of consciousness ". As regards the relation of the two aspects of mind, we note (1) that many psy- chical processes, ordinarily regarded as functional, not only involve struc- tural elements of the accepted sort, but also themselves possess unique structural attributes; (2) that, in any given case, structure and function turn out to represent simply two phases of a single fact; so that our present psy- chology needs "c a further development of both branches of the inquiry, based upon the distinction and a clearer recognition of the real relation of the two "; and (3) that the alleged superiority of structural psychology merely indicates that mental science has developed as science at large has developed,-static and structural phases of the cosmos being known earlier than its dynamic and functional features. It follows that " psychology cannot succeed in its effort to determine what consciousness is . . . with- out a determination of what consciousness does," i.e., that it must inquire, into the how and why of conscious operations. " Start from the psycho- logical standpoint, and we insist that you cannot avoid certain finctional statements. Once enter upon statements of function and you cannot . stop short of a logic, an ethics and an aesthetics. Furthermore, in the samne movement which carries you into logic, you will inevitably find your- self drawn back into epistemology. . . . The attitude is one and the same. throughout, the attitude of really understanding the structure and func- tion of consciousness."] E. B. MeGilvary. ' Altrulsm in Hume's. Treatise.' [" The relation of the Treatise to the Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals is much closer than recent critics would admit... The former work attempted to elaborate an explanation of the passions by the principle of association, and to apply the explanation to some of the passions-not by any means to all. The latter work, accepting the existence of exactly the same passions, did not attempt to enter upon that problem," partly because Hume now doubted whether any solution could be reached, partly because he now knew that abstruse speculations were not popular. But "f Hume did not modify in the least his view of the relative preponderance of fundamentally altruistic over fundamentally egoistic principles in human conduct. In both works he admitted the presence of both kinds of springs of action, and in the earlier as well as. -in the later he found that it is ' rare to meet with one, in whom the kind affections, taken together, do not overbalance all the selfish'.." These conclusions are, based (1) upon a consideration of the general drift of flume's psychological theory as presented in the Treatise, and (2) upon an</page><page sequence="2">136 PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. analysis of the passages in which he applies this theory in detail to love, sympathy and benevolence.] H. H. Bawden. ' The Functional Theory of Parallelism.' [(1) Function. " The essential idea in function lies in the use, value, or utility of the structure for sorne end. Function and func- tioning, ultilnately, are not material processes, but ideal significances or meanings. . . . Instead of saying that the psychical is the functioning of the physical, it would be- truer to say that the psychical and the physical are constituent and correlative functions within experience. . . . The ontological distinction of mind and inatter doubtless served a useful pur- pose at one time in the history of reflective thought." But these concepts now " stand simply for a functional division of labour in the building-up -of our actual experience as a systematic whole ". (2) Mental Activity. " Mental activity is not a special sort of activity. . . . Mind is not a different mode of energy from matter.... Mental life is a continual .synthetic construction. It is simnply a name for the orderly, continuous functioning of an organism under conditions of tension in adaptation. ... The sole difference" between mental acts and other acts in the world " consists in their being tensional or conscious acts instead of habitual or stable acts ". (3) " Nothing can be in the mind of which the mind is un- conscious. . . . The unconscious background of the conscious is not mental but neural. The subconscious is the mechanised background of the con- scious," i.e., is ' physical'. (4) In the light of these discussions, we may say that "this problem of mind and matter is, in reality, only a phase of the larger problem which modern psychology has transformed from its abstract statement, as the problern of the many and the one, into the more intelligible statement as the relation of mneans to end ".] Reviews of Books.

[Experiments out of doors with a specially constructed sound- cage, by means of tuning-fork, stopped pipe, reed pipe, bell, telegraphic sounder. Intensive differences alone are suifficient for confident and accurate assignment even of pure tones to the median vertical plane and to the lateral hemisphere from which they chance to come, as well as for less confident and accurate reference to the transverse vertical plane of the head. But " accuracy of localisation as regards altitude in this transverse plane, and accuracy in the several regions between this plane and the median plane" are "'apparently dependent upon tonal complexity and the modifications in timbre which complex sounds undergo through the changes in the intensity of their partials, when heard from different directions ". Localisation within the median ver- tical plane is inaccurate with all sounds, buit most inaccurate with pure tones.] R. Macdougall.

[President's Address before the American Psychological Association, December, 1902. (1) Psychological theory is influenced to a large, even to an embarrassing, extent by points of view and forms of expression derived from physics. This is referable not so much to physics as a science as to man's general commerce with the outside world. Now from an exclusively psychological, standpoint, physics is merely a most elaborate development of one aspect of the psychology of the cutaneous and kinesthetic senses, a study of fixed associative groups of a linited sensory origin. The difference between the two sciences is a difference (a) of attitude, (b) of variety of experience covered, and (c) of relative simplicity of contents. On the other hand, psychology itself is conscious of gaps in its empirical series, and tends to fill these gaps by appeal to the outside world and to unconscious cerebral processes. No harm is done, if we remember that the physical series called in is itself "based upon the physical group of sensations, and has been elaborated according to the usual psychical processes of perception, association, abstraction and generalisation ". But this implies that we are to utilise the physical series to the best psychological advantage; and this, -in turn, leads to an interaction theory of the relation of mind to body. (2) In spite of physical influences, psychology is, and probably must remain, an anthropomorphic science.] P. G. Bonser. 'A Study of the Relations between Mental Activity and the Circulation of the Blood.-' [A aphygmographic and plethysmographic study. Emotion and intellectual activity are accompanied by change in heart-rate and blood-pressure, and generally by peripheral vasomotor changes. The only constant variation for agreeable and disagreeable stimuli is that the vasomotor level is more quickly recovered in, the former case. Prolonged intellectual activity lessens the pulse curve, increases blood- pressure, and lessens the acuteness of the dicrotic notch. It has three distinct vasomotor effects: progressive constriction, no progressive ,change, and progressive constriction for a time, followed by a steady level of constriction or a slight dilatation. The Traube-Hering waves correspond to fluctuations of visual and auditory attention, the greatest acuity occurring just after the maximum of vasoconstriction.] G. T. Ladd.

'Mind and Body from the Genetic Point of View.' [An examination of the alleged primacy of subjective over objective, in the light of the genesis of the distinction between body and mind. (1) The three stages of growtb, formulated as: (a) the projective progression, " projective experience becomes personal-projects and thing-projects "; (b) the subjective pro- gression, "personal projects become subject-self and object-self"; and (c) the ejective progression, " object-self becomes mind and body ". (2) In the later stage mind and body have strictly correlative meaninlgs. The question is that of the relation of presented mind, considered as the object of reflexion, and presented body, likewise considered as the object, of reflexion. Materialism takes the spontaneous standpoint for body, the reflective for mind; subjectivism takes the spontaneous standpoint for mind, the reflective for body: both alike, therefore, miss the issue. (3) The distinction between mind and body requires the use of two cate- gories 'of construction. Physics interprets the agenetic; its formula for cause and effect is an equation. Psychology and ethics interpret the genetic (as subjective); their formula is that of progressive organisation; the equation is replaced by the progression. If we attack the problem of the relation of mind to body in terms of one category only, we either make mind a form of energy (materialism) or deny that antecedent brain-state fully determines subsequent (subjectivism): either form of interactionism is erroneous. (4) The conditions are fully satisfied by psychophysical parallelisnm. The further question arises: "How can we satisfy the mental demand for a type of change which shall . . . both exhibit the form of 'progression' . . . and also be liable to interpreta- tion in terms of the equations of agenetic science ?

' Esquisse d'une education de la memoire.' J. J. van Biervleit. The poor results of 'lesson by heart' at school are experimentally shown. Hence the desirability of new methods. The sensibility of the several senses and the duration of their various impressions vary in various individuals. Children should learn to remember by aid of as many senses as possible. For literature, only true ornaments of memory should be committed to memory. Vain repetitions should be avoided. Better to go over the passage once slowly, with attention to each syllable, and repeat the exercise after an interval. There are proposed exercises in remembering things seen and heard. The article deserves the attention of peda- gogists. 'L'illusion de fausse reconnaissance.' Emile Laurent.

When oxygen and hydrogen are combiined to form water, do the component substances still exist in the water, or do they disappear to formi the one substance of water? The problem in its general shape is as old as .Aristotle, and received much attention from the schoolmen. According to the author, every mineral compound body, be it either chemical combination or mechanical mixture, is a simple aggregate of substances, more or less altered, more or less unified in their sensible properties, but keeping always their respective individu- alities. He insists on the discovery of Sainte-Claire-Deville that there is no chemnical modus operandi distinct from physical modus operazdi, and that chemistry and physics henceforth make but one science. He promises to return to the metaphysical consideration of this question. ' Quielques arguments philosophiques en faveur de la liberte d'enseigne- ment.' S. Jankelevitch. The author rejects the theory which bases the liberty of teaching on the rights of parents : he considers that it assigns to the family an independence which would be destructive of the State. At the same time he is on his guard against too close an application of biology to politics; he does not admit that the family is to the State exactly as the cell to the body. He holds the State to be an expansion of the individual rather than of the family. He points out how, when power was wrenched from the minority composed of the privileged classes, the liberalism of laissez-faire, restricting the State's functions to those of police, led to the grinding down of the weaker individual by the stronger, and threatened to result in the disruption of society. There- -upon a new liberalism, or rather socialism, undertook to protect the</page><page sequence="7">PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. 141 weak, and in doing so has armed the State with such powers that, individual liberty has come to be once more in jeopardy. Such has been the effect of the teaching of Rousseau, and, after him, of Comte and Karl Marx. The modern State claims to mould the individual by a State-directed education. Finding what seemed to be a common ground for all modern minds in Science, the State has wished to make of Science the staple of its education. It has wished to make Science supreme and sole, to the exclusion of other educational forces which appeal more to the heart and conscience of the individual. The author argues that Science is not an instrument fit to do all the work that the State expects of it. He considers that the State may well insist upon Science for all: but should leave to individuals the liberty of their own teaching in religion and metaphysics. In that domain individuals shoulld be emancipated from State control, the State only interfering to prevent their impeding the liberty of one another. ' Theses de Doctorat de M. Ribery A la Sorbonne.' M. Ribery's Latin thesis is 'De infinito apud Pascalium'. He draws an analogy between Pascal and Kant, turning on their respective employment of the terms Infinite and Absolute, Appearance and Phenomenon, Heart and Reason. A French thesis follows, 'Essai de Classification Naturelle des Caracteres'. M. Ribery considers that intellect is no part of character. By 'character' then he means 'temperament,' and distinguishes eight temperaments, maintain- ing that temperament is given by nature, not by education, and that it is impossible to pass from one temperament to another. On both theses there is an interesting discussion reported between M. Ribery and his Examiners. ZEITSCHRIFT FUR PSYCHOLOGIE UND PHYSIOLOGIE DER SINNESORGANE. Bd. xxxi., Heft 3. H. Piper. 'lUeber Dunkeladaptation.' [Report of an elaborate experimental investigation of the temporal course and the quantitative relations of adaptation, i.e., of the increased retinal sensitivity induced by the removal of light stimuli. The author con- firms Tschermak's discovery of two types of adaptation, the one characterised by quick rise, with very marked increase of sensi- tivity, the other by a slow course, with a much lower maximum. Tschermak had brought these two types into close relation with Hering's typical differences of normal colour vision and of colour blindness: quick adaptation going with relative yellow-sightedness of normal colour vision and with 'green blindness,' slow adaptation with relative blue- sightedness and with 'red blindness'. Piper is unable to support this eorrelation. He concludes (1) that the mechanism of adaptation is, within wide limits, independent of and separate from the mechanism of brightness and colour vision; and (2) that the union of the fields of vision, in aaaptation to dark and light respectively, obeys essentially different laws. In binocular vision with dark-adapted eyes there is an addition or summation of the liminal stimuli of the two organs; in vision with bright-adapted eyes this is not the case. He therefore infers that in dark-adaptation central nerve structures are involved, whose function in face of light stimuli is different from that of the structures involved in bright-adaptation.] T.

[The physiological sub- strate of the affective process must be looked for in the cortical cells (cf. loss of feeling-tone in dementia paralytica).

If it underlies ' positive' feeling-tones, it accelerates, if it underlies ' negative,' it inhibits, the association of ideas and of movements: this action being, on the whole, teleological.

Except on the resonance hypothesis (which is untenable), the cochlea presents itself as the organ of noise sensation.

[If the eye is accommodated for a distant object, and a veil drawn over the face, there is but little interference with vision (ladies' veils). If the veil is drawn over the object, we get, if the meshes are distinct, a con- cealment of contours and a darkening by shadow (face seen through veil); if the meshes are not distinguished, either a general darkening of the object (dark veil) or a loss of details and of differences in light and shade (light veil, such as is used for clouds in theatrical scenes: cf. the ad- mission of light to the ground-glass plate of the camera). Intermediate positions of the veil give more complicated conditions.

['Bonnet's case ' is familiar to students of psychology, if only from its mention in Hoffding's Outlines. The author has obtained and here publishes the subject's own account of his case: "Visions de M. l'ancien Syndic Lullin, Seigneur de Confignon". The text is followed by a commentary. "Les visions de Lullin sont bien des hallucinations proprement dites, non des hallucinations dites psychiques, ou pseudo-hallucinations, n'affectant que l'ail interieur et depourvues du caractere d'objectivite propre aux perceptions."] A. Lemaitre. ' Deux cas de personnifications.' [Two studies of synaesthesia, involving personification. In the one case "les personnifications ont pris naissance dans le besoin instinctif d'associer un sens X des mots entendus mais encore incomnpris; le son de ces mots, frappants par leur etrangete, s'est alors adapte X des objets ou X de menus details bien localises, qui tombaient sous les yeux" of the subject "i la maison ou X la promenade "; in the other, " c'est la vue et non l'oreille qui la premiere a dft engendrer les personnifications des lettres majuscules imprimees de l'alphabet ".] A. M. Boubier. 'Les jeux de l'enfant pendant la classe.' [Schoolroom plays of children from nine to thirteen years of age: talking, epidemic interests, reading, pictures, barter, drawing, correspondence, car-ving, music, muscular activities, kaleidoscopic devices, etc. The theories of superfluous energy and of recuperation, and the principle of imitation, are insufficient to explain the phenomena, which must be looked on ratlier as 'preparatory exercise' or 'preliminary activity' (Voruebung, Einuebung). From this point of view it is inadvisable to attempt the total suppression of the play-forms.] E. ClaparAde. 'Exp6riences sur la vitesse du soulevement des poids de volumes diff6rents.' [When objects have the same weight but different volume, they are lifted the more quickly the greater their volume. There are two moments in the lifting: the latent time, and the lift proper. In general, the former is shorter the quicker the lift; but in some cases one moment only is the determining factor in the impression of weight, and- then it is rather the rate of lift thanl the duration of the latent time. At times, again, there is compensation or over-compensation of the two moments: a very slow lift will follow a very short latent time. These moments are not, as such, psychological factors that enter into the illusion ; they are mechanical conditions of the variation of tendinous and muscular tension, which is itself the sole factor upon which the specific</page><page sequence="11">PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. 145 sensation of weight depends. The weight illusion is, therefore, not a psychological illusion in the regular .sense, but a consequence of the persistency of instinct. Since the motor impulse is greater for greater volumes, and the greater volume is perceived as lighter, there is no sense of innervation. The reason for the direct objectification of the peripheral data is the insufficiency of acquired associations existing among the various elements (tension, speed, etc.) of the complex.] K.

[An elaborate study of the relation of psychology at large to the treat- ment of nervous disorders (hysteria, neurasthenia, etc.), with special reference to the conflicting claims of popular psychology on the one hand, and modern intellectualistic or voluntaristic psychology on the other. Critique of the views of Flechsig, Ziehen, Moebius, Kraepelin, etc. The author declares himself a voluntarist, in the Wundtian sense, and believes that " die durch Wundt uns vermittelten psychologischen Erkenntnisse heute allein irn Stande sind, der Vulgarpsychologie in allen ilhren Verhiillungen den Boden innerhalb der Nervenheilkunde abzugra- ben ".] C. H. Judd. ' An Experimental Study of Writing Movements.' (Investigates a phase of the relation between finger movement and hand and arm movement, in developed adult writing, by aid of a writing point attached to the fifth metacarpal bone, just behind the little finger. The apparatus fails, of course, to record up and down movements, and movements of supination and pronation ; but its simplicity offsets these disadvantages in a preliminary study. The fine formative movements are executed by hand or arm ; the pauses between letter-groups are used for long forward arm-movements and for hand-movements which ensure an easy-working position. The control of writing is visual, not kinaes- thetic.] F. Kiesow. 'Ueber Vertheilung und Empfandlichkeit der Tastpunkte.'

' Die Arbeits- curve&amp;' [An attempt to analyse a curve of 90 min. uniform work, recorded in 5 min. sections, into its components of practice, fatigue, warming-up,* habituation, and tension of will. The author confesses that, after mnore than a decade of work, he is able to offer only a pro- visional and crude analysis, but thinks that " eine sorgfaltige Erforschung der Arbeitscurve in allen ihren Einzelheiten" is the only path to " ein Massverfahren, welches durch zweckmassige Vertheilung von Arbeit und Ruhe uns mit den wesentlichsten Eigenschaften der Versuchspersonen, ihrer Uebungsfahigkeit und ihrer Ermiidbarkeit vertraut machen soll ".] 0. Kuelpe. ' Ueber die Objectivirung und Subjectivirnmg von Sinnesein- dricken.' [If our experience is originally unitary, neither subjective nor objective, it must be possible experimentally to produce wrong (or at least doubtful) objectification and subjectification, and to prove the conditioning of judgment upon factors extraneous to the experience itself. Experiments made in the spheres of visual and cutaneous sensa- tion showed that both of these hypotheses are correct.

Rostosky. 'Ueber binaurale Schwebungen.' [Slow diotic beats are always accompanied by repeated changes of localisation, occurring at the same rate. The direction of localisation is determined in every case by the intensive ratio of the diotic excitations. These facts are explicable on the assumption that the two stimuli, conducted separately, interfere at two points, whose excitation intensities are of determining influence upon sensation, and that the movement processes resulting from the interferences do not run synchronously. If this assumption be granted, the theory that binaural beats are due to transmission of vibrations from ear to ear by the bones of the skull receives important support.] :E. W. Scripture. 'Studies of Melody in English Speech.' [Study of records by a Rousselot apparatus. " In speech, as contrasted with song, the voice is constantly and continuously changing in pitch. The changes are so gradual and so complicated tha.t any attempt to represent the melody of speech by mnusical notation is thoroughly misleading. The changes in pitch are not very great."] Bd. xx. L. Lange. 'Das Inertialsystem vor dem Forum der Naturforschung Kritisches und Antikritisches.' [Review of literature on the law of inertia since 1885, with special reference to MacGregor's 1893 paper in the Phil. Magazine.

I Ueber die Helligkeitsvariationen der Farben.' [Experimental test, by aid of a universal optical apparatus, and on -the ground of formulae set up in the writer's Die physischen Aequivalente der Bewusstseinserscheinunzgen, of the hypothesis that equally intensive colour sensations possess the same brightness. The formulm are found correct; it also appears that equally bright colours of different wave length have approximately the same periodic constants. The variation of colours in brightness is a simple consequence of the fact that the retina is differently sensitive to light of different wave-lengths. A component theory of colour vision is thus rendered less probable than such a periodicity theory as has been proposed by Wundt.] G. F. Lipps. ' Einleitung in die allgemeine Theorie der Mannigfaltigkeiten von Bewusstseinsinhdlten.' [The author distinguishes a science of thought, whose fundamental principle is that " Jede Denkform besitzt ihren gegenstnindlichen Trtger, an dem sie zur Ausgestaltung kommt," from a science of objects, with the principle "Alles gegenstandlich Bestehende findet durch das Denken seine Be- stimmung". Thought itself is either comprehensive (erfassend) or relational (bbziehend). The distinction is important both on the side of the science of thought (e.g., in mathematics) and on that of the science of objects, where it founds the further distinction of a science of conscious contents and a science of substances. The former of these has two objects of investigation: the "relations founded in the nature of the conscious contents," and the "uniformities of connexion, in which conscious con- tents are -experienced ". The author, dealing here with the first only, characterises conscious contents by intensity (" Inanspruchsnahme des erfassenden Denkens ") and quality (" Weise des Erfassens "), and reaches the notion of a conscious element which, though not empirically percep- tible and not given in any act of comprehensive thought, may yet be used as if it were conscious content for the purposes of his problem.] E.

' Ueber den Zusammenhang zwischen der Methode der Minimallinderungen .und der Methode der richtigen und</page><page sequence="14">148 PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. falschen Falle.' [The difference limen of minimal changes is exclusively dependent neither upon the measure of precision nor upon the limen of right and wrong cases, but is influenced by both. Approximative formulea are given for liminal values.] E. A. Pace. ' Fluctuations of Attention and After-images.' [Experiments with visual stimuli. The stimulus fatigues the retina, and the impression disappears. Its disappearance affects the central mechanism of attention. This change of attention influences the process of accommodation. This, in turn, affects the operation of the stimulus upon the retina. Reappearance is accordingly a function both of recuperation and of accornrnodation. The writer thus combines the peripheral (sense-organ) and central (attention) theories of the fluctuation of minimal stimulus differences.] I. Richter. ' Die erkenntnisstheoretischen Voraussetzungen des griechischen Skepticis- mus.' [The paper works out in detail, with constant historical reference, the position taken up as regards ancient scepticism by Wundt in his Einleitung. The author extends and confirms Wundt's criticism by reference to the ethics of Pyrrhonism.] B. Scbmid. 'Der Wille in der Natur.' [A discussion of Wundt's natural philosophy, and especially of his employment of the concepts of will and purpose, on the basis of a, comparison with the views of Schopenhauer and Darwin.] G. Stoerring. 'Zur Lehre von den Allgemeinbegriffen.' [The scientific definition of the general idea presupposes, besides judgments of inherence and equality or similarity (' these and these characteristics of the complex ideational content or idea-object appear also in a whole series of other ideational contents or idea-objects '), the negative judgment that 'these and these characteristics and no others appear in this series'. Classification of general ideas.] G. Mx Stratton. ' Eye-movements and the AEsthetics of Visual Form.' [The eye moves far less accurately over an outline than has commonly been supposed; it takes a course which is but a rough approximation of the form which we perceive. We thus have evidence of a striking introspective illusion, due to confusion of point of attention with point of ocular fixation; and we must give up the theory that the preference for curves over straight lines is explicable by ease of eye- movement. " The form we enjoy is not a simple sensuous impression, * . . either muscular or retinal. . . . It seems to be due to nothing short. of an elaborate mental act of selection and recomposition of the data fuirnished by the eye."] K. Thieme. ' Philosophie der Theologie.' [Methodological considerations, based on the position which Wundt. assigns to the philosophy of theology or philosophy of religion in the system of the sciences. " A true science of religion is, on the one hand, a history of religions," and accordingly rests upon the historical disciplines (especially mythology and ethology) and philology. On the other hand, it " attempts, by help of anthropology and individual and social psycho- logy, to give systematic knowledge of the religious life ". Since, however, the religious elements of the mental life satisfy the deepest needs of man's affective and conative nature, " so gebiihrt der Religionswissen- schaft eine einzigartige philosophische Bedeutung im Kreise der Einzel- wissenschaften ". E. B. Titchoner. 'Ein Versuch die Methode der paarweisen VergI eichung auf die verschiedenen Gefiuhlsrichtungen an- zuwenden.' [Concludes,-on the basis of experiments with harmonium tones and time intervals by Cohn's method of paired comparisons, that excitement and depression, tension and relaxation, are not simple affective processes, like pleasantness and unpleasantness, but complex feelings.] A. ViLorkandt. 'Die Grunde fur die Erhaltung der Cultur.' [Enumer- ation of the formal and material grounds, with discussion. If we group together the formal and the secondary material grounds as ' subjective,</page><page sequence="15">PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. 149 the primary material as ' objective,' we may say that removal of the former gives us the civilisation of the Illumination, removal of the latter that of a thorough-going Relativism. The true path lies between these extremes. At the same time, " der wahre Sachverhalt liegt dem conven- tionalistischen Extrem naher als dem idealistischen. Der Eindruck, den wir von den Grundlagen der Cultur und deren gesammtem Charakter durch unsere Betrachtung erhalten haben, ist ein vorwiegend pessimis- tischer."] W. Weygandt. I Beitrage zur Psychologie des Traumes.' [ Deals especially with the alienation of consciousness at the oncoming of sleep. In drowsiness, certain somatic and other continuous weak sensations, not the object of attention in the waking life, come to the front; at the moment of falling asleep, these presomnic sensations pass over into dream ideas.] W. Wirth. ' Zur Theorie des Bewusstseinsum- fanges und seiner Messung.' [A paper of nearly 200 pages-naturally without summary! The author reviews the previous work, historically and critically; makes valuable contributions to the methodology of the subject; and briefly reports experiments of his own with an improved tachistoscope.] J.

Klein. 'Ueber die Wichtigkeit der Psychologie fur die Naturwissenschaften.' [Follows Aristotle's De Anima, dealing first with the vegetative soul, and then with the sensitive. In connexion with this last he points out a ' gross fallacy' fallen into by J. MUller the physiologist, Dubois, Helmholtz, Fick and Aubert, asserting that what we cognise in sight has no similarity with the thing seen. On the contrary, it is the thing seen.] E. Rolf. ' Die Unsterblichkeit der Seele nach . . . Plato und Aristoteles.' [Here the writer indicates Aristotle's proof of the immateriality of the soul: the thinking act is essentially different from matter, and argues an existence .which is not matter, and which therefore can exist separately after death. C. Th. Isenkrahe. ' Ueber die Zeit.' [The writer defends his theory-viz., that time is not founded in movement or change, but in the fact that things which exist in time are creatures-against several objections; and he concludes by admitting that, in his theory, the avum or duration of spiritual substances would have no place.] E. EHartmann. 'Die sinnliche Wahrnehmung nach Pierre d'Ailly.' [This paper, which is the first of two articles, deals with the general Scholastic Theory of Cognition as expounded by Pierre d'Ailly (the Magister Sententiarum) whom Aquinas followed closely; and enters into a detailed explanation of what was meant by the ' species impressa' and the ' species expressa,' and how these are supposed to act in the theory.] A.

' Die Aseitat Gottes.' [This is the first of a series of articles. The author, starting from the idea of Aseity- the Not-being-from-any-other-of God, who is the cause of all that needs a cause, and Himself needs none, attempts to show that it is the basis both of God's existence and of His attributes, not as a cause but analogically to a cause, in that we infer</page><page sequence="16">150 PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. them therefrom.] C. Gutberlet. 'Die naturliche Erkenntnis der seligen.' [This, the first of two papers, examines the question of the double cognition of the blessed; one which proceeds from the visio Dei, and the other from their natural powers. Now the natural faculties of cognition in this life cease with death, and the soul has no power to know itself by itself; since, therefore, the soul is hnmortal it is necessary and natural that certain species or intelligible perceptions should be in- fused into it at the moment of death, else it would be annihilated. This cognition, without the aid of any extended mental image, is not natural, nor is it contrary to nature; but it is preternatural.] E. Hartmann. Die scimliche Wahrnehmung nach Pierre d'Ailly' (Peter Lombard). [The most important point in this concluding article is the statement that the cognition of sensible things, although it takes place by means of an image, or resemblance, of the thing cognised, is not that image, which is never known directly, only by inference.] St. Schindele. ' Die aristotelische Ethik.' [Aristotle's idea of virtue is a mean between two contrary extremes; a mean which is geometrical, not arithmetical, and appreciable in reference to the subject. Scholastics had to part com- pany with Aristotle in many points, or make him say what he did not. Evil is to him the mere struggle between the intelligence and the senses, not the depravity of the will. He to some extent sacrifices the individual to the State. He makes. a virtue of magnanimity and a vice of humility. He blames suicide only as an injustice to the State. And his political conceptions are too narrow, too Greek.] P. Beda Adloch. 'Glossen zur neuesten Wertung des Anselmischen Gottesbeweis.' [This is a de- fence of St. Anselm's argument for God's existence against Graf de Vorges. His dilemma was: If God is the being than which none greater is con- ceivable, do I conceive this being, or no? If I do, there is something greater: if I do not, how can I know it to exist really?] RIVISTA FILOSOFICA. Anno v., Vol. vi., Fasc. iii. May-June, 1903. G. Chiapefli. 'I1 valore teoretico della storia della filosofia.' [The history of philosophy should be studied as part of the general history of civilisation. We must avoid the mistake of regarding past systemg as stages in the evolution of some one system whose finality is assumed. But there is a progress in thought; and even when the same problems recur their apprehension becomes widened and deepened in course of .time.] A. Zuccante. 'ILa donna nella dottrina di Platone.'
