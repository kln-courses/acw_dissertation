<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Sheila Lloyd Sara Baartman and the “Inclusive  Exclusions” of Neoliberalism Abstract: This essay examines three African-American feminist texts—Elizabeth Alexander’s “The Venus  Hottentot,” Barbara Chase-Riboud’s Hottentot Venus, and Suzan-Lori Parks’s Venus. In  their nuanced critiques of the sovereign power of neoliberalism as both a sociopolitical and a  discursive condition, that is, as what Foucault calls a biopolitics, these texts represent a  feminist cultural activism that challenges the hegemonic forms of neoliberalism and  transnational market relations. Despite their apparent focus on African-American women’s  bodies and their exploitation and instrumentalization, what is additionally meaningful in  these texts is that the more recent history of globalization to which women are subjected under  late capitalism—a history within and on which these texts and their writers work—is shown  to be coextensive (although not homologous) with the history of imperialism that made it  possible in the first place to mark out a place for a Sara Baartman (the so-called Hottentot  Venus) in nascent capitalist relations and forces of production and in the early colonization of  southern Africa. In their nonreferential literary representations of twentieth-century  neoliberalism, Alexander, Parks, and Chase-Riboud give readers a marginal subject, “Sara  Baartman,” who serves not simply as an icon of sexual difference between white and black, as  some critics have argued, but as an economic placeholder for these interrelated nineteenth- and  twentieth-century economic and social histories.

Fredric Jameson, The Political Unconscious (1981) Not only have transnational feminist theorists and cultural critics evi- denced a keen interest in Sara Baartman, a Khoekhoe woman who in 1810  was transported from the Cape Colony in South Africa and exhibited to the  public at Piccadilly Circus in London as the “Hottentot Venus,” but African- American feminist artists and writers (primarily women) have also taken  Baartman as their subject. If one wants to understand why some forms of  African-American feminist aesthetic practices have explored linguistic and  performative aspects of the social relations that theorists and critics have  examined in the case of Baartman, then one must be prepared to take on  these texts’ function as social texts. Moreover, in doing so, one need be  mindful that these texts are constructed in particular contexts and serve,  among other things, the tasks of producing and promoting, to use Olakun- le George’s formulation, highly invested versions of history (George 1999,  71). It is my claim that transnational feminist criticism of literature, and of  culture in general, might benefit from looking at the versions of history  that literary production around Baartman has created, if only because this  helps us to understand the role of literature and other art-forms in con- structing visions of collective action, solidarity, and social justice that are  so crucial to a transnational feminist imaginary.1 I read literary texts by Elizabeth Alexander, Suzan-Lori Parks, and Barbara  Chase-Riboud comparatively in order to determine what their versions of  history and their investments are and why these versions, for important  reasons, turn to Baartman’s encounter both with a colonial system that the  English began to install in the Cape Colony in 1806—only one year before  the abolition of the slave trade and four years before Baartman’s arrival in  England—and with that other scene of colonization, the metropole, with  which she is so often associated. This other scene engages an earlier  manifestation of the globalization of capitalism whereby policies concern- ing the Khoekhoe’s enslavement on the frontier and proletarianization in the  towns and industrial labor centers of the Cape Colony, as well as legislation  on the integration of “Britain’s newest colony” into the empire, were being  drafted and debated (Abrahams 1996, 101). As Zine Magubane explains, the  Sheila Lloyd • Sara Baartman and the “Inclusive Exclusions”  213 </page> <page sequence="3"> “old economic order at the Cape [was] based on enslavement, forced  captivity, and despotism,” and this was to be replaced, so the English hoped,  by a “‘voluntary’ commodification of the self and a ‘willing’ capitulation to  the dominant logic of capital” (Magubane 2001, 829). Given this history, one that needs little rehearsing here since it has been  explored in some detail by Yvette Abrahams (1996), Sadiah Qureshi (2004),  and Mugabane (2001), among others, my investigation runs counter to that of  most critics2 on Sara Baartman, who see her as exemplary of the status of the  Hottentot (a derogatory name for the Khoekhoe people), as “the lowest rung  on the great chain of being[, as] the central nineteenth-century icon for  sexual difference between the European and the Black” (Gilman 1986, 231,  quoted in Mugubane 2001, 817), and as “a late-twentieth-century icon for the  violence done to women of African descent” (Strother 1999, 37, quoted in  Mugabane 2001, 817). Although it would seem that the desire on the part of  the African-American women writers I have selected to examine also is to  claim Baartman as a iconic figure for the transhistorical, racialized sexual  difference of women of African descent, this desire can be historicized, at  least in the literary cases that I interpret, as an actual instantiation of a  critique of sovereign power. This critique, in Aihwa Ong’s particular explora- tion of this concept, involves “overlapping sovereignties” in that, although  “the state retains formal sovereignty, corporations and multilateral agencies  frequently exert de facto control over the conditions of living, laboring, and  migration of populations” (Ong 2006, 19). In their rather nuanced critiques of  sovereign power as both a sociopolitical and a discursive condition, that is, as  what Foucault calls a biopolitics, these texts represent a feminist cultural  activism that challenges the hegemonic forms of neoliberalism and transna- tional market relations. Thus, despite their apparent focus on black women’s  bodies and their exploitation and instrumentalization, what is additionally  meaningful in these texts is that the more recent history of globalization to  which women are subjected under late capitalism—a history within and on  which, I want to suggest, these texts and their writers work—is shown to be  coextensive (although not homologous) with the history of imperialism that  made it possible, in the first place, to mark out a place for a Sara Baartman in  nascent capitalist relations and forces of production and in the early coloniza- tion of southern Africa. Published between 1990 and 2003, the texts I examine serve as narratives  that offer up a space for comprehending and grasping in a nonteleological   214  meridians 11:2 </page> <page sequence="4"> fashion the possibilities of contemporary transnational feminism. The years  in which these texts saw publication also witnessed neoliberalism becoming  more and more entrenched globally as an economic dominant dependent on  a reconstitution of state powers. For their part, these newly constituted state  powers have consequences for how we examine traditional notions of state  sovereignty as linking territories in a naturalized and, despite their competi- tion, seemingly neutral fashion. Like many other state formations, neolib- eral state sovereignty is constructed and shaped by institutions, most of  which, such as the International Monetary Fund, are inter- or transnational  in scope. Moreover, the sovereign power invested in the state is one that is  marked by violence and by threats of violence, as Thomas Hansen and Finn  Stepputat have argued (Hansen and Stepputat 2005, 3). In fact, this state of  violence, along with the power to determine which lives are disposable, is  what ultimately defines sovereignty. Having opened this line of inquiry, we might ask: what does this have to  do with African-American feminist transnationalism, both socially and  literarily? We could glibly and therefore inadequately reply that it has  everything to do with it. But in order to venture a fuller account, we would  want to define “neoliberalism,” which David Harvey has explained as: a theory of political economic practices that proposes that human  well-being can best be advanced by liberating individual entrepreneurial  freedoms and skills within an institutional framework characterized by  strong private property rights, free markets, and free trade. The role of  the state is to create and preserve an institutional framework appropri- ate to such practices. The state has to guarantee, for example, the  quality and integrity of money. It must also set up those military,  defence, police, and legal structures and functions required to secure  private property rights and to guarantee by force if need be, the proper  functioning of markets. Furthermore, if markets do not exist . . . then  they must be created, by state action if necessary. But beyond these  tasks the state must not venture. (Harvey 2005, 2) Later in this essay, I will have occasion to address what is meant by “human  well-being” and to question how the “human” is defined under neoliberal- ism, but for now, to add to Harvey’s explanation, I want to refer to Ong’s  statements about this theory and place them alongside Harvey’s. As she sees  it, “Neoliberalism is merely the most recent development of such techniques  Sheila Lloyd • Sara Baartman and the “Inclusive Exclusions”  215 </page> <page sequence="5"> that govern human life, that is, a governmentality that relies on market  knowledge and calculations for a politics of subjection and subject-making  that continually places in question the political existence of modern human  beings” (Ong 2006, 13). Finally, as Jodi Dean considers it, “neoliberalism is a  philosophy viewing market exchange as a guide for all human action.  Redefining social and ethical life in accordance with economic criteria and  expectations, neoliberalism holds that human freedom is best achieved  through the operation of markets. Freedom (rather than justice or equality)  is the fundamental political value” (Dean 2009, 51). What I want to emphasize here about this political-economic theory and  practice qua ethics is that they have proven in the United States to be  devastating to poor and working-class African-American communities,  and this has been the case far more for poor African-American women,  who have been positioned in the rhetoric as manifestly unsuited for and  incapable of assimilation into the market relations fostered by neoliberal- ism. Moreover, in neoliberalism’s rhetoric, particularly against the figure  known as the “welfare queen,” these same women are held responsible for  an entire community’s perceived failure to integrate itself into late capital- ism’s market ethos. This became apparent in the languages of and policies,  from the 1980s on, related to race, gender, and class that justified (and  continue to promote) the dismantling and rearrangement of “divisions of  labour, social relations, welfare provisions, technological mixes, ways of  life and thought, [and] reproductive activities,” which, from Ronald  Reagan’s administration to Bill Clinton’s to George W. Bush’s, neoliberal- ism has brought about (Harvey 2005, 3). The fragmentation associated with neoliberalism might be described as  a new form of alienation in the sense that what we are examining is akin to  but not, I here argue, the same as what Fredric Jameson characterizes as  “the nineteenth-century historical situation in which the emergence of the  ego or centered subject can be understood,” a situation involving “the  dissolution of the older organic or hierarchical social groups, the universal  commodification of the labor-power of individuals and their confronta- tions as equivalent units within the framework of the market, the anomie  of these new ‘free’ and isolated individual subjects to which the protective  development of a monadic armature alone comes as something of a  compensation” (Jameson 1981, 153–54).3 In their nonreferential literary  representations of this fragmentation and alienation, Alexander, Parks,   216  meridians 11:2 </page> <page sequence="6"> and Chase-Riboud give us a marginal subject, “Sara Baartman,” who  serves not simply as an icon of sexual difference between white and black,  but as an economic placeholder for these interrelated nineteenth- and  twentieth-century economic and social histories. Alexander’s “The Venus Hottentot” (in Alexander 1990) is a narrative  poem that proceeds dialogically (as per the Bakhtinian model of dialogism4)  and that can be read for its historically determinant complex, which applies  to the other texts under study here, of discourses and philosophical sys- tems—for example, science, colonialism, medicine—all of which are  important to transnational feminism’s focus on women’s, particularly  postcolonial and poor “first world” women’s, subjection to the dictates of  such epistemes as science and medicine. The poem’s two voices are best  conceived not as characters or anthropomorphic figures with whom we  associate specific acts and attributes,5 but as subjects with whom we associ- ate particular discourses and places within what Lacan calls the symbolic,  the system of signs that constitutes the social order. At issue in the poem is  an agon between the subject that the poem would have us associate with  Georges Cuvier, the nineteenth-century naturalist and anatomist, and Sara  Baartman, the so-called Hottentot Venus. In Alexander’s poem, Cuvier  represents a space of mastery and a concomitant will to knowledge-power,  whereas Baartman represents a space reserved for that subject pressed into  service to advance the will associated with Cuvier. Writing about these two  historical figures, Anne Fausto-Sterling has suggested: Cuvier most clearly concerned himself with establishing the priority of  European nationhood; he wished to control the hidden secrets of Africa  and of woman by exposing them to scientific daylight. . . . Hence he  delved beneath the surface, bringing the interior to light; he extracted  the hidden genitalia and defined the hidden Hottentot. Lying on his  dissection table, the wild Bartman became the tame, the savage  civilized. By exposing the clandestine power, the ruler prevailed.  (Fausto-Sterling 1995, 42, quoted in Magubane 2001, 819) Notwithstanding the questions of how compelling this argument might  be—and it is not without its problems, which include most notably its  assumptions concerning Cuvier’s motives—it is consonant with Alexan- der’s poem’s thematic of the historical encounter and psycho-affective  exchange between Cuvier and Baartman. Sheila Lloyd • Sara Baartman and the “Inclusive Exclusions”  217 </page> <page sequence="7"> Although it addresses the colonial dynamic between the two figures,  Alexander’s poem says little about this dynamic as a set of actual social  relations emerging from imperialism in the nineteenth century. However,  rather than representing a silenced and tamed Baartman, Alexander’s  poem endeavors to establish a counter-discourse on the part of a colonized  and enslaved Baartman. As in the Hegelian master–slave dialectic,  Baartman’s knowledge vies with that associated with nineteenth-century  transnational science and medicine. For instance, at one point in the  poem, the visual sensorium—constituted by Cuvier’s eye gazing through a  microscope—captures “small things in the world” (Alexander 1990, 6)  with “few . . . ever see[ing] what I see / through this microscope” (5). The  slave’s avenging anger, as Frantz Fanon might say, counters this knowl- edge and is brought forth as a voice from the dead, declaring: If he were to let me rise up from this table, I’d spirit his knives and cut out his black heart, seal it with science fluid inside a bell jar, place it on a low  shelf in a white man’s museum so the whole world could see it was shriveled and hard, geometric, deformed, unnatural. (Alexander 1990, 9–10) Rising from the dead (and the poem’s use of the subjunctive mood is worth  noting), Baartman’s “spirit” leaves in its wake an anatomizing “science,”  whose unnatural black heart it displays to a multitude unlike the paradoxi- cally limited audience available to Cuvier, whose plans include taking her  “genitalia / [which] will float inside a labeled / pickling jar in the Musée / de  l’Homme on a shelf / above Broca’s brain / ‘the Venus Hottentot’” (Alexan- der 1990, 6). Implicit in the poem’s devices of metonymy and inversion is  the historical perspective of a colonial subject, a marginal one, pressed to  its limit. Instead of her being an atomized subject, what we find in the  Baartman of Alexander’s poem is the making of a collective subject  constructed via a colonizing process (though this is not to say that Baart- man represents all colonized subjects). The bringing of a new collective subject into being is suggested in  several places in the poem where the Khoekhoe colonial subject does not   218  meridians 11:2 </page> <page sequence="8"> do what the colonizer expects of her—which is to commodify the self, as  Magubane argues was historically the case. Instead, Baartman is figured  not so much as commodity but as consumer. In the poem, as a potential  consumer, Baartman avers: I would return [from England] to my family a duchess, with watered-silk dresses and money to grow food,  rouges and powders in glass pots, silver scissors, a lorgnette, voile and tulle instead of flax cerulean blue instead of indigo. (Alexander 1990, 7) Shunning the processes and forces of production in which she was formerly  embedded and where flax and indigo, according to the poem, are cultivated  in an agrarian mode of production, Baartman is captivated by the lure of an  imperial process in which goods from abroad, or from the periphery, find  their way into the hands of bourgeois imperial subjects in the metropole.  Although the poem focuses in this section on the commodified Baartman’s  relation to other commodities and objects and thereby represents her as a  “thing” among other “things,” we can discern a parallel between this  representation of a colonized subject as consumer and the actual, concrete  social history of taking raw materials from colonies, finishing them in an  imperial center, and returning them to a new consumer market in the  colonies—a process that needs to be recognized as importantly part and  parcel of the political economy of early nineteenth-century England.6 I would  argue that this set of political-economic relations, although possible to miss  when reading the poem, is as central to the poem as is its meditation on the  power relations between Baartman as a colonial other or object and Cuvier  as an imperial self or subject. At first glance, it would appear that Alexander’s poem, then, would have  us believe that the Cuvier–Baartman relationship of self to other is one that  has primacy when we attempt to understand these historical figures together  and alone. With its concentration on the Cuvier–Baartman dynamic, the  poem would seem to suggest that the nineteenth-century capitalist forces of  production, in which colonies were both sources of raw materials and  markets for goods finished in the metropole, are actually secondary to  Sheila Lloyd • Sara Baartman and the “Inclusive Exclusions”  219 </page> <page sequence="9"> historicizing Baartman’s situation with respect to French scientific inquiry  and with respect to the Khoekhoe colonization and immiserization in the  British-ruled Cape Colony. As the poem would have it, the signal historical  narrative or version of history that it wants to establish is one in which an  African-American feminist identification with Baartman is secured by  representing her as an ancestral presence.7 The poem indicates this by  imagining a line of descent from Baartman to “imaginary / daughters, in  banana skirts / and ostrich-feather fans” (Alexander 1990, 9). With its allusion to Josephine Baker, the poem establishes a filiation  between Baartman, as a nineteenth-century racialized and gendered other,  and spectacle and Baker, with her twentieth-century performance of race  and gender. What the poem ends up doing by juxtaposing these figures is  to dehistoricize Baartman, to conflate a Khoekhoe woman in near-captive  exile with an African-American woman in voluntary exile, and to claim a  kinship relation between Baartman and all black American women. The  making of this ancestral presence is perhaps informed by the poem’s  insistence that there be a reclaiming of the historical Baartman, a practice  of reclamation that was a significant feature of feminist criticism and  writing practices in the 1970s and 1980s, the latter of which were the very  years of the poem’s composition.8 The identification that Alexander’s poem  solicits is one that runs counter to an identification informed by the idea of  solidarity (not filiation) across national, racial, ethnic, class, and sexual  lines at the same time as this identification acknowledges and negotiates  these differences, an idea that is an important feature of transnational,  anticapitalist scholarship, aesthetic production, and activism. Yet despite all that I have said about its limitations, there is something  important in Alexander’s poem for transnational feminist criticism and  activism. The most crucial is her re-imagining the potential agency of  African-American women as transnational subjects during the early days  of the institutionalization of neoliberalism in the 1980s and 1990s. If the  reclamation project informing Alexander’s text is taken as a feminist  practice, then that feminism is not so much about Baartman as an ances- tral presence than it is about representing her as a figure that discursively  opens up a space granting us access to a usable past. Her positioning as  commodity and as consumer discloses a hidden transcript, to use James C.  Scott’s term, of resistance to a reduction of African-American women’s  lives to market relations (Scott 1992). Alexander’s Baartman shows the   220  meridians 11:2 </page> <page sequence="10"> compatibility between black life as commodity under nineteenth-century  capitalist imperialism and black life under twentieth-century neoliberal- ism as subjects engaged in market relations via consumerism. We might  ask: how can these two positions even be thought of together? What we  have witnessed in the intervening years from the nineteenth century to the  twentieth century is not so much a passage from commodity to consumer,  but the reconciliation of the earlier notion of the “speaking commodity”9  as an object-identity held by others with a more recent notion of black,  female life’s refusal (for neoliberals, their constitutive failure) to accept  social life in terms of competition within markets as the summum bonum. Alexander’s text deploys an alterist discourse and gives its readers cause  to think about imperialism and neoliberalism; Barbara Chase-Riboud’s  historical novel Hottentot Venus (2003) constructs its fictionalized Saartjie  or Sara Baartman via a triple discursive articulation. The text carves out a  space for her as a legally consenting subject; a class position for her as a  Khoekhoe woman brought within the realm of an imperialist capitalism  and finding reason to note the similarities of the positioning of industrial  metropolitan workers in England and colonized labor in the Cape Colony;  and a place for her as a colonized native or subaltern, who belongs among  the dispossessed, but who has the additional position of being a gendered,  colonized subject. Before getting into a discussion of these positions, I  would like to consider for a moment the novel’s use of history. Harry Shaw has usefully described and analyzed three main ways in  which history has been employed in the genre of historical fiction. He  enumerates and accounts for them as follows: First, history has provided an ideological screen onto which the  preoccupation of the present can be projected for clarification and  solution, or for disguised expression. I refer to this use as “history as  pastoral.” Second, history . . . has acted as a source of dramatic energy  that vivifies a fictional story. Such dramatic energy can produce effects  that are melodramatic and insubstantial, but it can also produce  catharsis. Finally, and obviously, history has acted as the subject of  historical novels, in a variety of ways. These different uses of history  often coexist in a given novel. But the sense we make of a historical  novel, or any character or scene within it, depends upon our conception  of its purpose. . . . Though all of these uses of history may coexist in a  Sheila Lloyd • Sara Baartman and the “Inclusive Exclusions”  221 </page> <page sequence="11"> work, they are likely at any given moment to fall into a hierarchy in  which one of them predominates, and adequate interpretation depends  upon recognizing this hierarchy. (Shaw 1983, 52) It is my sense that Hottentot Venus works with the first and last of these  methods, and it does this in such a way that the first serves as the “histori- cal ‘dominant’” of the work, to use the term that Shaw borrows from  Russian formalism (54). Although obviously taking history as its subject  matter, the novel would have its readers concentrate their efforts on  comprehending what perspective on history is most fitting when telling  the story of Sara Baartman. The text gives us multiple vantage points,  discourses, statements, decisions, and propositions that constitute its  narrative apparatus. To use Foucault’s concept, the “dominant strategic  function” of this narrative apparatus is to display the heterogeneity needed  to account historically for Baartman and to assimilate that which, because  of what has been done to construct her historically and socially, cannot be  assimilated with ease (Foucault 1980, 195). Dedicated as it is to Nelson Mandela, Chase-Riboud’s novel is more  obviously a transnational document than is Alexander’s poem. The novel’s  transnationalism is evident not only in the dedication, but in its epilogue set  in Cape Town, South Africa in 2002, the year that Baartman’s remains were  repatriated from France to South Africa for interment there,10 and also in its  author’s acknowledgments, which end with the words: “Forgive the African  debt, forgive the African debt, forgive the African debt” (Chase-Riboud 2003,  320). The social movement to relieve or forgive debt for highly indebted poor  countries began in the 1980s with pressure coming from international  nongovernmental organizations such as the Jubilee 2000 movement (Jubilee  Debt Campaign 2000). In Chase-Riboud’s dedication and acknowledgments,  we find a view of history in which the past is used to reflect on the present. More particularly, the author takes key moments in Baartman’s life and  career and links them imaginatively with actual historical figures and  events to indicate how they feature in our present. For example, in the  instance of her infamous trial, Baartman’s “managers” were brought  before the court to account for their indecent display of her while the case’s  judges attempted to ascertain whether she “was being kept as a slave”  (Abrahams 1996, 89). Hottentot Venus makes of this trial an occasion to  introduce the Jamaican radical Robert Wedderburn, who says of himself:  222  meridians 11:2 </page> <page sequence="12"> I was a theologian, the son of an aristocratic Scottish planter and a slave  woman. I had dedicated my life to the radical cause of abolition and had  founded the African Association, which was famous for defending the  rights of slaves and freeing and repatriating as many as it could. The  association fought and campaigned against racism in England and the  horrors of slavery in the West Indies. . . . I was a licensed, self-taught  Unitarian preacher who believed there should be an affinity between  black West Indians and the British working class, between London’s  artisan class and the ultraradical party. (Chase-Riboud 2003, 112–13) An early internationalist, Wedderburn is the subject of a chapter in Peter  Linebaugh and Marcus Rediker’s highly influential study The Many-Headed  Hydra: Sailors, Slaves, Commoners, and the Hidden History of the Revolutionary  Atlantic. Less well known than Sara Baartman, Wedderburn has been  described by Linebaugh and Rediker as “a strategically central actor in the  formation and dissemination of revolutionary traditions [and as] an intellec- tual organic to the Atlantic proletariat” (Linebaugh and Rediker 2000, 289).  His insertion into Chase-Riboud’s text as one of the primary abolitionist  figures coming to aid Baartman shows the early transnational (in this case,  Atlantic) politics of resistance to capitalist expropriation and exploitation,  which, for Wedderburn, applied equally to the cotton fields as to the cotton  factories. Working with his autobiography The Horrors of Slavery (1824) and  with some of his other writings, Chase-Riboud paraphrases Wedderburn  and has him say to the fictional Baartman, “The English working class, the  Scottish peasantry, the black Haitian, the African slave, the Irish bond  servant, the American Indian are all one and the same” (Chase-Riboud 2003,  135). Wedderburn promotes solidarity-in-difference, and his vision of it  depends on both a popular and a revolutionary theory of historical change  and consciousness. This, then, appears to be the historical dominant into  which the text attempts to insert the fictional Baartman. Assuming that she must be a slave, because otherwise there would be no  question that she would be capable of consenting to her display, the Wedder- burn of the text is surprised to meet Baartman’s resistance to his efforts to  free her from a supposed “involuntary servitude” (Chase-Riboud 2003, 121).  Despite his desire to be instrumental in her liberation and to make cause  with the Khoekhoe woman, Wedderburn and the African Association are  eventually thwarted by evidence that she has freely entered into a contract  Sheila Lloyd • Sara Baartman and the “Inclusive Exclusions”  223 </page> <page sequence="13"> with her keepers.11 According to the fictionalized Baartman, Wedderburn  sees in her “a means to [his] goal of revolution, and rebellion, against the  English” (Chase-Riboud 2003, 134). It is only years later, after her keepers  have abandoned her and sold her to a French animal-keeper, that Baartman  attempts (and unsuccessfully at that) to contact Wedderburn in order to  secure her liberty. If I have spent so much time on the fictionalized Baart- man–Wedderburn relationship—which, as the novel presents it, is a compli- cated affair—I have done so to emphasize the text’s view of the past, which  as represented in the person of Wedderburn includes both a radical trans- Atlantic proletarian and an African diasporic history of resistance. However,  the chapters of the text given over to Wedderburn are not the only place  where Baartman encounters figures of resistance. Concentrating equally on the Cape Colony, England, and France,  Hottentot Venus depicts Baartman as a near-picaresque character traveling  through these particular spaces of uneven development. Among the places  of interest to me, as I read the text’s representation of the past, are her  travels in the Midlands, where Chase-Riboud has Baartman witness what  E. P. Thompson calls “the making of the English working class,” a collec- tive class subject that practices radical dissent, popular direct action, and  other acts deemed illegal by the state (Thompson 1966). Of this, the text  states, “All over the Midlands, we encountered riots, strikes and lockouts  because of the Luddites and the trade unions, who were trying to organize  the guilds and mill workers. More than once, we [Baartman and the  company with whom she travels] were barred from a town because of  police curfews, or an ordinance against any assembly of more than three  people” (Chase-Riboud 2003, 170). At another point in the text, we learn  that Baartman’s traveling troupe appeared in the large cities of Northampton, Nottingham, Wakefield  and Leeds . . . The workers, the herders, the shepherds and peas- ants . . . rebelled against their rich landlords and owners, for which they  were named the Luddites. Like the Khoekhoe, once they rose they were  quickly put down by the police and constables hired by the factory  owners. . . . Workers convicted of machine breaking were sentenced to  death under the [1812] Frame Breaking act of Parliament. After one  attack in Yorkshire which left a mill owner dead, over one hundred  workers were rounded up, seventeen of whom were hanged. (186)  224  meridians 11:2 </page> <page sequence="14"> The making of this collective subject says much about how capitalism held  sway over the Cape Colony as well as over those working-class subjects in  the metropole, the other scene of colonialism. The text’s terms are such  that, despite the incursion of capitalism, it would remind readers not to  forget that in England, as in the Cape Colony, an insurgent working class  developed forms of resistance to its exploitation. This is far more well- known in the case of the Luddites, about whom the novel states, “The  revolts lasted two more years. . . . For a while, we believed the Luddites  might stage what Alice [the fictional Baartman’s English working-class  servant] called a revolution. But eventually most of them were caught and  the last of their heroes, James Towle, executed” (Chase-Riboud 2003, 187).  With this detail, one that conforms with Thompson’s historical account  (Thompson 1966, 573–74), although the fictionalized Baartman’s own  death came one year before the historical Towle’s actual death, Chase- Riboud’s text would have us remember that state sovereignty is secured by  means of violence, whether legal or extralegal. Moreover, such sovereign power can be read along the lines of distinction  that Giorgio Agamben—in Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life—draws  between the “People” and “people,” about which he states at some length: Every interpretation of the political meaning of the term “people” must  begin with the singular fact that in modern European languages,  “people” . . . always indicates the poor, the disinherited, and the  excluded. One term thus names both the constitutive political subject  and the class that is, de facto, if not de jure, excluded from poli- tics. . . . It is as if what we call “people” were in reality not a unitary  subject but a dialectical oscillation between two opposite poles: on the  one hand, the set of the People as a whole political body, and on the  other, the subset of the people as a fragmentary multiplicity of needy  and excluded bodies; or again, on the one hand, an inclusion that  claims to be total, and on the other, an exclusion that is clearly hope- less; at one extreme, the total state of integrated and sovereign citizens,  and at the other, the preserve . . . of the wretched, the oppressed, and  the defeated. (Agamben 1988, 176–77) This distinction between “people” as bare life and “People” as sovereign  power that Ong likewise describes as an inclusion of “People” as political  body separated from “people” as excluded body, is one that Chase-Riboud  Sheila Lloyd • Sara Baartman and the “Inclusive Exclusions”  225 </page> <page sequence="15"> pursues in her representation of Sara Baartman and in her identification of  Khoekhoe exploitation as having an equivalent in, but as being not quite  the same as, the exploitation of the English working class. Parsing the  difference between bare life and sovereign power, Agamben tells us, in a  manner that echoes the sentiment of Hottentot Venus, that “the species and  the individual as a simple living body become what is at stake in a society’s  political strategies” (Agamben 1988, 3). Although Agamben does not gender this “simple living body,” we can  extend his argument and examine how Chase-Riboud allows her readers to  understand Baartman as an anterior figuration of what Gayatri Spivak calls  “the patriarchally defined subaltern woman” (Spivak 1999, 68). This gen- dered subaltern reveals how “humanist practices [have tended to] legitimize  bourgeois and patriarchal interests” (Bose 1997). Included among the  humanist practices explored in the text are those having to do with elaborat- ing a position for that subject, a subject position that goes by the name of  individualism—including an individualism in its feminist guise. One of the  proper names of individualism would be the “self.” Marked out in Hottentot  Venus is the impossibility for a subaltern woman, within the prisms of  imperialism and patriarchy, to achieve such a subject position, largely  because within “patriarchal subject-formation” and within “imperialist  object-constitution, it is the place of the free will or agency of the sexed  subject as female that is successfully effaced” (Spivak 1999, 235). Bare life, as a “simple living body,” in our time is the body on which  neoliberalism, as a set of political and economic strategies, does its work.  Under neoliberalism, there is a “commodification of everything” in prin- ciple, and according to this principle, a price can be placed on “processes,  things, and social relations,” which in turn can be traded and subjected to  legal contract (Harvey 2005, 165). Here is where Suzan-Lori Parks’s contro- versial play Venus can be brought in, for it shows a total commodification of  the self, which is not the same as self-commodification, and the social  relations in which that self functions and is located. In some of the critical  literature, Parks is decried for having exploited Baartman and for having  represented her as complicit in her own undoing.12 My view, however, is that  if Parks’s Baartman is represented in such a manner, then one of the effects  of this representation is to compel viewers to consider whether binaristic,  particularly alterist, paradigms concerning relations between ruler and  ruled need reconsidering—a point to which I will return.  226  meridians 11:2 </page> <page sequence="16"> At once the feature of a “freak show,” of a “girlie show,” and of scientific  inquiry—all forms of commodification of bare life—the play’s Baartman  assumes three guises in the dramatis personae: “Miss Saartjie Baartman,  a.k.a. The Girl, and later The Venus Hottentot” (Parks 1997/2000). These  names suggest that the construction of this character is not as “person,” but  as a set of discourses and subject positions. When in the Cape Colony, she is  referred to as Saartjie, “Little Sarah,” and she is represented in the play’s  directions initially as “The Girl,” the servant-girl, until her unveiling in  London as “The Venus.” A careful reader of the script will notice that  nowhere in the play does a “Miss Saartjie Baartman” actually appear. What  does appear in the play is a set of figures cast in languages that situate her  only as personae. Self-conscious in its mode of organization, the play  “begins” and “ends” with an announcement of “The Venus Hottentot’s”  death and the cancellation of her show; bracketed between these are scenes  thirty-one to one, appearing in that order as a countdown with the end at the  beginning. In scene thirty-one, she is a servant girl who is convinced to go to  England to make “a mint”; in later scenes, she is presented as a performer  who is encouraged by “The Mother-Showman” to “pull out all thuh stops”  (Parks 1997/2000, 17, 34). It is obvious when looking at the structure of the  play with its figuration of its characters as multiple subjects (for example,  “The Mans Brother, later The Mother-Showman, later The Grade-School  Chum”) that the play is posing questions concerning performance, theatri- cality, publicity, obscurity, representation, and the relationship that each of  these has to power. It does this with anachronistic details (for example, The  Girl arrives in England on a jet airplane in 1810) and with heteroglossic and  polyphonic language, which calls attention to itself as language. Although  we rarely stop to reflect that we read and hear and speak language by means  of physical organs—the eye, the ear, the vocal apparatus, and the brain—the  performance of language by actors in a play such as Parks’s should heighten  our awareness that language and thought are embodied. Lacking the  “realism” of Alexander’s and Chase-Riboud’s texts, Parks’s text only edges  close to realism in its “footnotes,” which appear in the “body” of the script  and which consist of “historical extracts” taken from newspaper advertise- ments and scientific, literary, theatrical, and legal statements about Baart- man. Far from faulting Parks for the tenor of the roles she assigns to  Baartman, we should recognize in them her critique of representation,  particularly the representation of a “black” and “female” body. Three bodies  Sheila Lloyd • Sara Baartman and the “Inclusive Exclusions”  227 </page> <page sequence="17"> are at work in Parks’s play—the body of the text; the body of the actor playing  the three roles constituting Baartman; and the prosthetic body, the padded  posterior that the actor wears that calls attention to the idea that after flesh,  after physicality, is body, the social subject. I have called Chase-Riboud’s Baartman an anterior figuration of the  subaltern woman, and I want to suggest that Parks’s Baartman formally  and conceptually comes to us from a posterior position as a subject-in- language. We only recognize her as such after the names and the dis- courses describing her are conventionalized to us through the play’s  repetitive play of language. Yet I want to make clear that the play’s formal  features are not my only interests. The theatricality of the 1810 court case,  in which Baartman was asked to declare whether she freely consented to  her exhibition and thus was not being enslaved by and acting under the  will of another person, that Parks displays in her play is important to  consider, but setting that aside, I want to spend time examining, in terms  of intimacy and affect, the play’s theme of how one as either a “free  laborer” or an enslaved laborer is to survive “both socially and affec- tively”—that is, how one is to survive as a human being (Harvey 2005, 170). Surviving socially and affectively is crucially related to “conviviality,” a  concept that is useful for moving beyond the alterist version of history that  so many familiar with the historical Baartman want to tell. Informing my  understanding of Parks’s play is Achille Mbembe’s account of the workings  of conviviality in the postcolony, and considering, as he does, the etymol- ogy of the word, Mbembe has explained the “logic of ‘conviviality,’ [as] the  dynamics of domesticity and familiarity, inscribing the dominant and the  dominated within the same episteme” (Mbembe 2001, 110). What is particu- larly striking to me about Mbembe’s concept is that it facilitates an  understanding of the particular dynamics between the play’s “Miss  Saartjie Baartman, a.k.a. The Girl, and later The Venus Hottentot” and  “The Man, later The Baron Docteur” (a figure representing Alexander  Dunlop and Hendriks Cesar, the historical Baartman’s initial keepers, and  Georges Cuvier). In The Venus’s relationship to the composite figure  Dunlop-Cesar-Cuvier is her movement from servant to the former two to a  lover-scientific object to the latter, a movement that might strike us as odd  initially, but that becomes clearer when seen through the prism of Mbem- be’s concept. In his elaboration of “conviviality” in the context of postcolo- niality, he advances the idea that:  228  meridians 11:2 </page> <page sequence="18"> Precisely because the postcolonial mode of domination is a regime that  involves not just control but conviviality, even connivance—as shown by  the constant compromises, the small tokens of fealty, the inherent  cautiousness—the analyst must watch for the myriad ways ordinary  people guide, deceive, and toy with power instead of confronting it  directly. . . . At any given moment in the postcolonial historical trajectory,  the authoritarian mode can no longer be interpreted strictly in terms of  surveillance, or the politics of coercion. The practices of ordinary citizens  cannot always be read in terms of “opposition to the state,” “deconstruct- ing power,” and “disengagement.” In the postcolony, an intimate tyranny  links the rulers with the ruled. . . . (Mbembe 2001, 128) Seeing The Venus (no longer known as The Girl) as The Baron Docteur’s  lover involves seeing the character’s structural relationship to her lover, not  her identification (which is an act and not a structure) with/for him.  Mbembe allows us to discern a structure not of which she is unwitting, but  by means of which, in the play’s terms, she complies with him or “embrac- es” and “enfolds” him. This taking of the dominant within the episteme of  the dominated—learning and considering the systems of rules informing  conceptual and actual possibilities not necessarily so as to reproduce  them—is what “conviviality” means socially in Parks’s play. If one is to  survive socially under neoliberalism, one needs not dignity alone—because  neoliberalism’s ideology of competitive individualism and personal  responsibility will see to the cultivation of an overweening sense of  self—but support, as Harvey suggests (Harvey 2005, 170). The dismantling of social provisions and relationships that would  prevent people from giving way is what we find in Venus. Wanting to make a  mint and being passed along from “boss” to “boss,” thereby making her a  laborer with a precarious economic position despite her desire to move  ahead, The Venus finds herself without alternative social and economic  supports. She has her lover, yes, but she remains unsatisfied. Among the  few words that she utters in the scenes set in the bedroom that she shares  with The Baron Docteur is the repeated question: “Do you love me?” or  simply, “Love me?” With this question qua demand, The Venus finds her  proof of love in the gifts of chocolates that her lover provides to her.  However, sated neither by the chocolates, a substitute, nor by her lover, the  seeming object of her need, The Venus languishes, telling the audience in  Sheila Lloyd • Sara Baartman and the “Inclusive Exclusions”  229 </page> <page sequence="19"> one of the play’s later/earlier scenes, “Love helps in times of hardship”  (Parks 2000, 155). This statement suggests her awareness that, despite  what has been given to her, she still lacks that something that would help  her to survive her own hardship. My initial interpretation of The Venus’s questions was that she suffers  from what could be called affective lack. Yet when thought of in terms of  neoliberalism, Parks’s text directs our attention not only to what is  missing, but to what is actually taking place on the stage—the estrange- ment of the self in a “world of flexible labor markets and short-term  contracts, chronic job insecurities, lost social protections, and often  debilitating labour” (Harvey 2005, 170). In spite of its reminders to its  audience that the events on the stage take place in the early 1800s, Venus’s  anachronisms, its flights toward the future, bridge the divide between and  the breaks separating nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The uniting of  periods does not efface historical difference, but it does tell us something  about the coexistence of temporalities. Moreover, it makes of “history” an  open signifier in that it is not only “what happened” that matters, but also  the “why” of past events and our accountability for them that matter, the  text seems to suggest. One of the flights that the play takes us on entails a  history and economy of affect. Indicating to us that Baartman is an effect or a trace of history and  language, as indeed are any of us, Parks’s play stages an absent presence— the dead reanimated. This reanimation is something on the order of a  “return of the repressed,” and what has been returned to us is not a  resistant gendered subaltern, as in Chase-Riboud’s novel, but a figure that  speaks the last lines: “Kiss me Kiss me Kiss me Kiss” (Parks 2000, 162). The  fading away of the reanimated dead does not stop the circulation of  Baartman’s story. In fact, The Venus’s call for a kiss shows, even insists  upon, a desire to establish contact, to make material that which would  otherwise be imperceptible, and the call ends with an echo of a “me” with  the fourth repetition of “Kiss,” a first-person that is withheld, a subject that  is not broken off necessarily, but that is still with us as the play comes to its  formal conclusion. This circulation of the affect “love” shapes an economy  in which there is no second person (the implied “you”) without the first  (“me”). If The Baron Docteur—who, in his prevarication with her, is  concerned with making a name for himself upon her dead body, literally— appears throughout the second half of the play as the object loving The   230  meridians 11:2 </page> <page sequence="20"> Venus, as the one who having received her love returns it, then the play at  the end evacuates the specificity of the “you,” dislodging him from his  historical and grammatical positions and placing us in the circuitry that  the play establishes between the two characters. Given this rerouting, what then are the conditions hindering “Miss  Saartjie Baartman’s” affective survival? Two things immediately come forth  as candidates. Obviously, there is the question of asymmetrical power  relations concerning gender, race, ethnicity, and class; there is also a sense  that she has been made into an object to satisfy the ends of a competitive  subject epistemically, politically, economically, and socially. In the case of  the former, we have found a counter-response to the tendency to “flatten”  these relations in Mbembe’s concept of “conviviality,” and in the latter, we  have transnational feminism’s wary regard of the idea that one person’s  “ends,” their (political, economic, and so on) security, must be sought in  another’s insecurity. This notion of survival and security returns me finally to what conjoins the  three texts that I have examined. One thing we find without much difficulty  when taking these texts together is that the aims of transnational feminist  activism include seeking justice for women by cross-culturally undertaking  social-justice work, a project in which I would include the realm of the  aesthetic. This justice work might best be conceived as involving “ethical  geographies” that are themselves informed by “a transnational sense of  moral responsibility” for the excluded (Ong 2006, 21). In some versions of  transnational feminism, especially those having to do with diasporic and  borderland configurations, the relations of dominance that make for  exclusion organize feminist scholars’, activists’, and artists’ understandings  of what we could call, to borrow from and to modify Arjun Appadurai’s  terms, feminist “bioscapes” and “ethnoscapes” (Appadurai 1996) of women  that “highlight . . . the tensions between irregular and fluid shapes of  population flows and communities of imagination that cut across [static and]  conventional political and social boundaries” (Ong 1999, 10–11). This tension  between flow and stasis can be seen to function in the exemplary case of Sara  Baartman, insofar as she is represented in these African-American feminist  writers’ texts, despite their seeming concern with the local, as an ineluctably  transnational figure who urges us to historicize and interpret her as such. These texts also provide a critique of power that is concerned above all  with a biopolitics that concentrates its attention on that body of power  Sheila Lloyd • Sara Baartman and the “Inclusive Exclusions”  231 </page> <page sequence="21"> from which bare life is excluded. As I read them, the implications of these  texts for an African-American feminist transnationalism that wants both  to analyze and to engage the axiomatics of our time, most notably those of  neoliberalism, can be sought in Agamben’s concept of the “homo sacer,” or  sacred man, who represents a type of “inclusive exclusion.” It is this  “inclusive exclusion” that sovereign power uses to constitute itself (for  example, it excludes whole groups of individuals from “political commu- nity,” while including others), even as these excluded groups “remain  internal and crucial to the construction of [late capitalist] society and  economy” (Hansen and Stepputat 2005, 17).13 The internality of the  excluded, as a social as well as rhetorical catachresis, becomes a site for the  immanent critique of the inclusive exclusion of the historical Baartman  under imperial capitalism and of African-American women under neolib- eralism. Analyzing the similar structural negativity, in the critical as well  as social senses of the term, of these subjects calls for a method that, if the  African-American transnational feminist critic is wise enough to deploy it,  reveals the contradictions of these social and economic orthodoxies in  order to use these sightings of contradiction as possibilities for emancipa- tion. If we find anything in these literary depictions of Baartman that is  worth our sustained attention, when it comes to the relations between the  aesthetic and the political, it is their shared notion that nothing is trans- parent, that there is domination—a domination, however, that has not  been without aesthetic or social counter. Notes 1. Chandra Mohanty’s account and analysis of transnational feminism have been  especially useful to the ways in which I frame African-American transnational  feminism; it is notable for its antiracism, and as Mohanty states, it is “an- chored in decolonization and committed to an anticapitalist critique”  (Mohanty 2003, 3). Similarly, Laura Briggs, Gladys McCormick, and J. T. Way  indicate that transnationalism as a category of analysis: “belongs to genealo- gies of anti-imperial and decolonizing thought, ranging from anticolonial  Marxism to subaltern studies to Third World feminism and feminisms of  color. Transnationalism has been a diverse, contested, cross-disciplinary  intellectual movement that in some of its manifestations has been bound  together by a particular insight: in place of a long and deeply embedded  modernist tradition of taking the nation as the framework within which one  can study things (literatures, histories, and so forth), the nation itself has to   232  meridians 11:2 </page> <page sequence="22"> be a question—not untrue and therefore trivial, but an ideology that changes  over time, and whose precise elaboration at any point has profound effects on  wars, economies, cultures, the movements of people, and relations of  domination” (Briggs, McCormick, and Way 2008, 628). 2. This work seeks to extend some of the theorization on Sara Baartman by  African-American feminists such as Collins 1990; hooks 1992; O’Grady  1992/1994; Hammonds 1997; Sharpley-Whiting 1999; Hobson 2005; and Sharpe  2010. My contribution to this body of literature is to bring forth the theoretical  implications, for black feminist transnationalism, of a strategic formation of  texts in which Baartman is featured as a proper name. 3. My aim in quoting Jameson is to make apparent the construction of an ideal  citizen-subject for a given economic order. However, one would need to  question Jameson’s universalizing and his ignoring such matters as the  concurrent consolidation of enslaved and colonized subjects alongside the  “free” subjects of nineteenth-century capitalism. For a similar critique of  Jameson’s suppression of multiplicity and difference, see Ahmad 1992. 4. Dialogism is in essence antagonistic; for instance, within a shared code, classes  struggle against and oppose each other. An example of this would be the uses of  the concept or code of “liberty” by the conservative eighteenth-century politician  Edmund Burke and by the radical pamphleteer Thomas Paine. 5. See Fredric Jameson’s distinction between characters and subjects (Jameson  1981). 6. In the English imperial model, mercantilist and manufacturing interests  worked along with those of the landed elite to transform plantation labor  relations such that colonies, particularly those formerly dependent on the  slave trade, became sites not only for the production of raw goods, but also had  the potential to become new markets for British manufacturers. Abolishing  the slave trade and slavery was seen as a way to create these new markets. See  Bunn 1980. For more on this in the latter part of the eighteenth century, see  Magubane 2001, 828–29. Interestingly, Olaudah Equiano’s humanitarian,  antislavery text of 1788 calls for a similar opening of markets in Africa, an act  that in one fell swoop both would resolve the “poor black problem” in England  by means of transporting them to Africa to become consumers and carriers of  civilization to indigenous Africans and would work toward getting rid of the  market in slaves (Equiano 1788/1995, 193–96). 7. Sadiah Qureshi notes a similar claim to kinship in the African-American artist  Lyle Ashton Harris’s discussion of his photograph, Venus Hottentot 2000. About  his collaboration with the African-American artist Renée Cox, he states, “This  reclaiming of the image of the Hottentot Venus is a way of exploring my own  psychic identification with the image at the level of spectacle. I am playing  with what it means to be an African diasporic artist producing and selling  work in a culture that is by and large narcissistically mired in the debasement  and objectification of blackness. And yet, I see my work less as a didactic  Sheila Lloyd • Sara Baartman and the “Inclusive Exclusions”  233 </page> <page sequence="23"> critique and more as an interrogation of the ambivalence around the body”  (Harris 1996, 150; quoted in Qureshi 2004, 249–50). Responding to this  statement, Qureshi pointedly adds, “The emphasis upon identifying with  Baartman as an ancestral self and her treatment as representative of the  negativity of modern depictions of black sexuality is typical of her modern  politicization” (250). 8. I would suggest that poetically Alexander attempts to do for Baartman what  the novelist Alice Walker did in the 1970s for the then relatively obscure  novelist of the 1930s, Zora Neale Hurston, whom she claimed as a literary  foremother. See Walker 1975/1983. 9. See Moten 2003 for a complication, through an analysis of Frederick Doug- lass’s Aunt Hester, of Marx’s ventriloquization of the commodity as it speaks  about its value. 10. Warner 2008 provides a transnationalist reading of the repatriation and  interment of Baartman’s remains. 11. For more on the trial and on the question of whether Baartman consented to  her public exhibition, see Abrahams 1996 and Sharpe 2010. 12. The most notable criticisms along these lines are Fusco 1995; Young 1997; and  Garrett 2002. 13. The notion of “inclusive exclusivity” to which Hansen and Stepputat refer and  that I conjoin with Agamben’s concept of “bare life” allows for a complicated  analysis of marginalized lives. It answers, in part, Ong’s objection to what she  sees as Agamben’s “universal division of humanity into those with rights and  those without” (Ong 2006, 23).
