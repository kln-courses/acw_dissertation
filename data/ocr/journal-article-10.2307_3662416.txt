With the exception of the collection in the Medelhavsmuseet, the vast bulk of the material in these volumes is without provenance, and little interpretation is provided regarding the importance of the material for an understanding of recent developments in the field of Cypriot studies. As a result, these volumes will be of limited value for those wishing to engage in contextually based approaches to Cypriot material culture. Nevertheless, the author and his collaborators have done an excellent job of documenting substantial portions of these collections for potential use by scholars and students who may not otherwise have had the chance to include them in more general studies of the island's prehistoric and early historical past.

Paris: Ecole Nationale Superieure des Beaux-Arts, 2002. Paper, C35. ISBN: 2-84056-115-8. Any book which encourages students and scholars to engage with the ancient sources is to be welcomed. Marion Muller-Dufeu's substantial volume is based on the sources for Greek sculpture found in Johannes Overbeck, Die antiken Schriftquellen zur Geschichte der bildenden Kiinste bei den Griechen (Leipzig, 1868), hereafter SQ. In addition, also following SQ, there are 'quelques excursus concernant des arts voisins' (p. XII): short sections on architecture (e.g. pp. 4-8, 726-8 on Hermogenes), painting (pp. 1003-18), and mosaics (pp. 1020-2). Each entry is presented in Greek or Latin, with French translation, since, as M.-D. rightly points out (p. X), knowledge of the ancient languages can no longer be taken for granted. But this is far from the 'easy option' of reprinting Overbeck, as a very The Classical Review vol. 55 no. 1 ? The Classical Association 2005; all rights reserved 334</page><page sequence="2">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW considerable number of additional texts has been included, thus effectively updating SQ and making this volume far more valuable than a simple reprint. A high proportion of the new texts is epigraphical, as one would expect given that, as M.-D. points out (p. XI), major sites like Olympia and Delphi, and most of the Acropolis of Athens, were excavated after the publication of SQ. Some sculptors are known only from inscriptions, such as Archedamos of Thera (pp. 386-8, nos 1123-6). Equally, many inscriptions tell us next to nothing, e.g. p. 212 (nos 583-4) on Kritios and Nesiotes, but are rightly included anyway. M.-D. has performed a painstaking and valuable service in adding not only texts and inscriptions which mention the sculptor or sculpture concerned, but also many which do not, but which nonetheless have a bearing and whose inclusion is to be welcomed for completeness. Among many examples, I note Herodotos on Mikythos (p. 178, no. 480), and Pausanias on Prasiai (p. 206, no. 562) and Kallias (p. 242, no. 678), the latter included in the section on Mikon, although he is not mentioned, because an inscription from Olympia (p. 242, no. 679) tells us the statue of Kallias was made by Mikon. M.-D. cites eleven sources on the Plataean tripod at Delphi (pp. 224-6), of which only five appeared in SQ. Among the 'new' sources for the tripod are Thucydides (no. 631) and Demosthenes (no. 633), significant additions to Overbeck's list. In a further addition to SQ, M.-D. has added many short introductory and explanatory paragraphs, again an indication of intent to make the volume accessible to the non-expert. These paragraphs are mostly very helpful, but on occasion they skim over problems: for example, writing about Myron, M.-D. refers to 'son groupe Athena et Marsyas' (p. 251), thus ignoring the problem posed by the very passage she is introducing (Pliny, NH 34.57). Surprisingly, Pausanias 1.24.1, which has a bearing on this issue but is omitted by Overbeck, is also omitted here. Further, such editorializing is occasionally evident also in the placement of texts: for example, the inscription p. 488 no. 1414 is listed under Praxiteles, although the article cited, Donderer's in ZPE 1988, argues instead for reading 'Pasiteles'. This is prejudicial for the unwary reader, especially as there is no reference to it among the entries for Pasiteles. The 'lexique' (pp. 1026-8) contains words which indicate the author's intent of accessibility even to beginners, e.g. 'couros', 'pentathlon'. The format of the 'chronologie' (pp. 1030-3) is restrictive, resulting in too much inaccuracy or vagueness. Thus 'apparition de la figure humaine' is put at 750-700, the Berlin Painter confined to 490-479, while the Tower of the Winds still has the now discredited date of mid-first century B.C. The bibliography (pp. 1036-7) is extremely brief and the selection criteria not clear, but this is, after all, a book of ancient sources, not moder. A more useful bibliography is the list of epigraphical sources (pp. 1048-50), an essential inclusion given that most of the additions to SQ are inscriptions. Ancient authors are listed (pp. 1038-47), although not the passages cited, a regrettable omission which restricts the way in which the book can be used. This is inevitable in some respects: for example, it would take much work to search out every reference to chryselephantine, and one would do much better to go straight to Kenneth Lapatin's Chryselephantine Statuary in the Ancient Mediterranean World (Oxford, 2001), pp. 152-92, although even that extensive list is entitled 'Select Testimonia'. The usability of a compilation such as this will depend largely on what each reader seeks to learn from it, but it is a valuable collection and should be warmly welcomed. King's College London K. W.
