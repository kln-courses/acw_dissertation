The Milesian school did not concern itself particularly with questions relating to religion. Its conception of the soul, as it appears in the record, is entirely consistent with that of the epic poems; and the same may be said of its view of the gods. If in this regard a difference is to be noted, it may be regarded as the natural result of tendencies already observable in Homer and Hesiod. The gods of mythology do not appear in the account of the world given by the Milesians, the agents being natural objects and forces. Aristophanes, toward the close of the fifth century, represents Zeus as dethroned and supplanted by Dinos and Necessity.1 However justly this might be said of the conse- quences of the natural philosophy inaugurated by the Milesians as they appeared after a lapse of more than a century, there is nothing to show that Anaximander and Anaximenes were con- scious of such implications of the attitude they adopted toward nature. In Homer occasionally and still oftener in Hesiod the gods are little more than personifications of nature, a fact clearly perceived and expressed already in the sixth century by Theagenes of Rhegium.2 The Milesians might therefore pursue their way, interpreting nature as it seemed reasonable to them, without being conscious of breaking with the hallowed tradition, so long as they recognized that all things were full of gods. Such an attitude was the more natural to them as Ionians, because Ionia in the sixth century had gone farther in secularizing religion than had other Greek lands even a century later. Furthermore, 1 Aristophanes, Clouds, 376-381, 828, 1470-71. 2 Cf. Diels-Kranz, Fragmente der Vorsokratiker (hereafter cited simply as Diels-Kranz), 8, 2 = I, pp. 51-2 (Theagenes, frag. 2). 257</page><page sequence="2">the Milesians were chiefly concerned with external nature, its origin, processes, and periodicity, with a growing sense of order in the world and of a pervading and all-compelling necessity, in the face of which the individual counted for little. Their view of the soul as of a fleeting breath was not calculated to give it great importance, and such ethical conceptions as they applied to the operations of nature were social, having regard not to the individual but to the civil group. The latter half of the sixth century witnessed a change, the origin and causes of which are obscure. It is probable, indeed, that we should be equally in the dark in this matter even if our sources of information about this period were a hundredfold more abundant than they actually are; for the determining influ- ences may reasonably be assumed to have been entirely different in the several regions in which the signs of change appear. Nor does the change everywhere have the same direction and result. Orphism is especially prominent in Magna Graecia, but Orpheus was localized in Thrace, while Athens was regarded as a center of Orphic propaganda. How far Orphism penetrated Ionia is not clear, because it cannot always be distinguished from the mystic cult of Dionysus, which certainly won many adherents there. In Ionia and in colonies where Ionian refugees found asylum one can imagine a religious revival following the humiliating subjugation of Asia Minor by the Persians; but the general receptivity for the new movement cannot be so explained. Moreover, the results were entirely different in different regions and individuals. What is common to many, if not all, move- ments of this time is heightened interest in matters concerning religion. From another point of view one may say that man is becoming more conscious of himself and of his place in the world. If in Anaximander we find evidence of concern about the origin of man, it is still chiefly in connection with the origin of land animals in general. His conception of cosmic justice suggests an instinctive, rather than a reflective, application of a moral postulate to the world. In Xenophanes the application of ethical concepts in defining the character of God is essential and obviously conscious. Whatever God may have meant to him, it is certain that the concept he framed is essentially an ethical ideal. Xenophanes was acquainted with the anthropology of his day and knew how certain peoples, Scythians and Ethiopians, 258 W. A. HEIDEL.</page><page sequence="3">HECATAEUS AND XENOPHANES. imagined their gods,3 but it was not from a comparative study of their conceptions that he arrived at his own: he found it by examining his own mind and applying his concept of perfection. Aristotle suggests that his model was the universe-the fact that it is one led to the notion of the unity of God.4 Though Aristotle and Theophrastus may have been right in their belief that Xenophanes practically identified God with the world, one cannot accept the inference that the unity of the world sug- gested the unity of God;5 for, even if the world is conceived as a cosmos, its unity is not directly given: it is so conceived only because the moral postulate demands that it shall be a unit. The Orphic and Dionysiac conception of the soul is essentially a primitive notion growing out of the unity of a group. In itself it has no special religious significance, having no necessary relation either to conduct or to God. The Dionysiac anthro- pogony, indeed, developed this primitive idea by conceiving the human soul as having a twofold origin, partly divine, partly Titanic; but, while the better part of the soul was thus derived from heaven, to which it yearns to return, it is not clear that the purifications, by which it might be freed from the Titanic taint, were other than ritual and material. Pythagoras, or at any rate early Pythagoreans, raised the purification into the ethical sphere by recognizing a just and philanthropic life as a means to this end. The Dionysiac, Orphic, and Pythagorean conventicles held the belief in a periodic cycle under the power of fate or necessity. They sought means of escape from it. The Milesians, Xenophanes and Heraclitus, likewise accepted the belief in periodic cycles, as had Hesiod; for them, however, it seems to have had only a cosmic significance, unless Heraclitus actually thought of the conflagration of the world as in some sense a judgment. In Hecataeus these cosmic cycles became important in connection with chronology. A significant indication of the changed state of mind is the attitude of men at this time to Homer and Hesiod. So far as we can see, the Orphics, Dionysiacs, and Pythagoreans did not directly combat the views of these worthies.6 There are various 3 Diels-Kranz, 21 B 16. 4 Aristotle, Metaphysics 986 B 21-24. 6 Cf. Cherniss, Aristotle's Criticism of Presocratic Philosophy, p. 201, n. 228. 6 The Descent to Hades, however, depicted the punishment of Homer 259</page><page sequence="4">assignable reasons why they should not have done so. The rites performed by these groups did not come into competition with the state religion, which everywhere was concerned chiefly with Olympian gods. The rites of the conventicles 7 were more closely analogous to those of the clans, which by the end of the sixth century must have largely lost their original restriction to a group composed of blood-relations. As the clan worship could exist alongside the state worship, there was no good reason why these brotherhoods might not, like the "phratries," be tolerated, unless their observances by shocking excesses aroused a com- munity. Such instances seem to have been confined to the distant past when the worship of Dionysus was introduced. Indeed, that the Orphic conventicles were established in a peace- able way without conflict is suggested not only by the almost total want of information regarding the process but also by the fact that the Orphics produced theogonies to match the Hesiodic. For them Ilomer and Hesiod are at best models, at worst some- thing to be altered. As for the Pythagoreans, Homer and Hesiod and their gods appear to have had no significance for them.8 So far as their conduct of life is concerned, we conclude that it was directed to other ends, though Apollo was worshipped among them. While, therefore, the sects seem to have largely ignored the Olympian gods, and to have paid slight attention to Homer and Hesiod, except as literary models, the other thinkers of this time boldly challenged the teachers of the multitude. Herodotus, almost certainly following Hecataeus of Miletus, says that Homer and Hesiod taught the Greeks the names and functions of their gods, who, ultimately derived from Egypt, were in the time of the Pelasgians without names (and presumably without differentiated functions).9 Hecataeus had even made merry over the Greek traditions and had represented Heracles and Dionysus as human beings deified for their services to man. Xenophanes rebuked Homer and Hesiod for their accounts of and Hesiod in the Lower World-for what? One can understand why Heraclitus or even Xenophanes should dislike them. 7Did they include sacrifices? Cf. Diels-Kranz, 1 B 5 = Plato, Republic 364 E-365 A on which cf. Linforth, The Arts of Orpheus, pp. 77-85. 8 But see note 6 supra. 9 Herodotus, II, 52-53. 260 W. A. HEIDEL.</page><page sequence="5">HECATAEUS AND XENOPHANES. the characters and behavior of the gods, which included every- thing that is a shame and a reproach among men;10 and Hera- clitus also rebuked these same prophets. Perhaps the most scathing denunciation of Homer is to be found in his exclama- tion: "Ay, let them (the people) think that they are only holding fast what their most esteemed teacher thinks; yet, verily Justice will overtake the fabricators and sponsors of lies." 11 Clement of Alexandria cites this saying as confirming his belief that Heraclitus thought of the destruction of the world by fire as a fiery purification of those who have lived evil lives. Now Heraclitus couples many of these persons together in a common denunciation: "The learning of many things teacheth not understanding, else would it have taught Hesiod and Pytha- goras, and again Xenophanes and Hecataeus." 12 Why he should have singled them out is perhaps not so difficult to understand as why he should have grouped them together. They were one and all men of mark, and excepting Hesiod they were roughly contemporary, older by a generation than Heraclitus himself. Though decried for a common devotion to miscellaneous learning, it does not follow that they were alike in aims or interests. They are, in fact, instructive examples of the different ways in which men of different characters and under different circum- stances react to similar influences. They were all natives of Ionia with the exception of Hesiod, and even he may have been born near by, in the little city of Cyma in Aeolis, with which legend connected Homer. At all events Hesiod's father had lived there before he emigrated to rocky Ascra in Boeotia. Despite the different themes and spirit due to changed times and environment, Hesiod's works clearly betray the influence of Homer; but his personality is not, like that of Homer, hidden behind his theme, but, like that of Archilochus, stands in the foreground. He heralds the age of strong and self-conscious individuality, to which belong all the other men whom Heracli- tus, himself a man of uncompromising individuality, berated for their want of understanding. It is in fact this common trait of character that most arrests our attention and accounts for their several contributions. 10 Diels-Kranz, 21 B 11. Diels-Kranz, 22 B 28 (cf. A.J.P., LXIII [1942], p. 120). 12 Diels-Kranz, 22 B 40 (Burnet's translation). 261</page><page sequence="6">We may first consider Hecataeus, though he was perhaps the youngest of the group. He was born at Miletus, probably about 560 B. C., and can be understood only as the continuator of the work of the Milesian school. Whether he was personally in touch with that illustrious group we cannot say, because we do not know whether it existed as such after the death of Anaximenes, the date of which is likewise uncertain. In any case there is nothing to suggest that he owed anything to Anaximenes. If he did, it was probably in a negative way. We hear of adherents of the philosophy of Anaximenes in the fifth century, and from the character of their work as well as from the record regarding Anaximenes himself we gather that it was concerned chiefly with cosmology. With cosmology Hecataeus apparently did not deal at all. Actually he harked back to Anaximander, taking up the problem where he had left it. Anaximander's main interest centered in chronology and geography, though he sketched the origin and order of the world, as seems to have been the almost invariable rule with later geographers. We are told that in the book which Apollodorus of Athens found in the second century B. C. the great Milesian had given a "summary account of his opinions." 13 This statement is generally interpreted as meaning that the book was brief and sketchy; but this inference is not justified. It was his " opinions " that were briefly stated; and we must ask on what subjects he expressed opinions that were likely to be consulted. Surely it was not his opinions regarding human history or descriptive geography; for the doxographic tradition entirely ignored these subjects, and in consequence Hecataeus, who con- fined himself to this field, is not even mentioned in it. If Anaximander gave only a summary sketch of cosmology and cosmography, we infer that he did so, as later geographers and historians did, because he felt that it was the logical introduction to his main theme. Anaximenes took up this subject and made it peculiarly his own, dealing with it more at length and making his contribution there. That may be the reason why Ilecataeus entirely ignored the subject. He may have felt that he could not do better, or he may have been little interested in it. At all events he chose to continue the work of Anaximander. We are told, apparently on the authority of Eratosthenes, that 13 Diels-Kranz, 12 A 1 (= Diogenes Laertius, II, 2). 262 W. A. HEIDEL.</page><page sequence="7">HECATAEUS AND XENOPHANES. he made a marvellous improvement in the map of his predeces- sor.14 Though, or perhaps just because, we have no information on the subject, we may assume that he followed the same principles. His improvement must, therefore, have consisted essentially in the extension of the chart to include more lands and in the correction of the contour of the earth. We are sure that he introduced notable changes in the east, based on the conquests of Darius and the voyage of Scylax of Caryanda; for he was regarded as an authority on the Orient down to quite late times. In particular we may be sure that he incorporated the "Persian map," which may be reconstructed from the account of Herodotus, thereby giving a better approximation to the actual map of the external lands added to the Persian Empire. In doing so he must have discarded the old notion, later revived, of a land-bridge connecting India with Libya (Africa). There is no reason to assume that he had visited these eastern lands, though his personal relations with the Persian court may have led him to penetrate Asia Minor and even Persia. He knew Egypt from personal observation, having probably accompanied Cambyses on his expedition of conquest. He was acquainted also with northern Libya. His relations with the Persian court may well have facilitated his journey to the West, since the Phoenicians also were subjects of the Great King. The frag- ments of his geographical treatise reveal a detailed knowledge of the West which was not again equalled for some centuries. This also suggests a connection with the Phoenicians and their colonies of Carthage and Gades, as does the relatively vague picture of the coast of the Gulf of Genoa, which the Phocaean colony of Massalia controlled. In the north the "Scythian square " seems to be due to Hecataeus. We conclude, therefore, that the "inner map," that is, the map of the Mediterranean and of the Persian Empire, as we reconstruct it from the account of Herodotus, is essentially the work of Hecataeus. But Hecataeus was a descriptive geographer in the larger sense, not only a cartographer, but interested also in physi- ography. It is certain that in its essentials at least the account of the nature of Egypt given by Herodotus is based on his observations, which probably extended into the Libyan desert. 14 Jacoby, Fragmente der Griechischen Historiker, Erster Teil, p. 3 = Hecataeus, Testimonia 12 a. 263</page><page sequence="8">Other observations also, such as those relative to the Achelous and the Thessalian plain go with these, and possibly Plato's account of Attica. With this interest Hecataeus combined that of anthropology and ethnography, though it is not always clear how far he carried his researches. Points of contact between the I-ippocratic treatise on Airs, Waters, and Locations and Herodotus and observations treated as matters of common knowl- edge by the poets and Sophists of the fifth century suggest the existence of a considerable body of ethnology, a good part of which may with great probability be attributed to him. But for Hecataeus geography was intimately connected with history. One sees this most clearly in connection with Egypt. Though in the account of Herodotus it is not at once apparent, the discussion of the nature of Egypt is concerned with geological history as the condition and background of the history of civiliza- tion, because the higher culture of the world was thought to be ultimately derived from the land of the Nile. Hecataeus calcu- lated that kings and high priests had left records there for more than eleven thousand years, and from Arrian 15 we may infer that he thought a (perhaps lower) culture had existed there in even more remote times, because he recognized the Delta as due to the secular deposit of silt by the river and assumed that man had gradually descended the Nile Valley as the resulting fens became inhabitable. Thus the age of Nilotic culture was con- jecturally extended from the recorded eleven thousand backward to a possible twenty thousand years. To a Greek, whose con- structive chronology, based on legendary genealogies, extended over a period only one-tenth as long as that supposed to be actually recorded in Egypt, this result was astonishing and of the utmost importance. Not only did it guarantee an immense lapse of time in which almost anything might have occurred, but it offered the possibility of a definite chronological scale as the necessary basis of universal history. In order to make this scale practically serviceable, however, points of contact must be found between the chronologies of different peoples. These Hecataeus discovered in synchronisms. He had evidently begun, as was natural, with the Greek past. Here he could with reasonable assurance go back a number of generations to the 15 Anabasis, V, 6, 5; cf. Memoirs of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, XVIII, 2, p. 61. 264 W. A. HEIDEL.</page><page sequence="9">HECATAEUS AND XENOPHANES. beginning of the strictly historical age; beyond that point he must resort to legendary genealogies, and farther back lay the mythical world. Long before his time the mythical age had been divided into periods associated with divine dynasties, but there were also myths that recounted a series of catastrophic events affecting the cosmos. The notions associated with the catastrophes that periodically began and terminated a cosmic age, as we find them clearly reflected in the literature of the fifth and fourth centuries, and less clearly but yet unmistakably even in Homer, are the same as those which recur everywhere in the Orient, and bear a distinctly astrological character. The doxographic tradition ascribes the belief in cosmic periods to Thales, Anaximander, Anaximenes, Xenophanes, and Pythagoras, though the mythical connotations are not mentioned. It was natural, then, that Hecataeus also should hold the belief in such periods. What interests us is that he brought these cycles into relation with the long period of recorded history in Egypt but discovered there no trace of the supposed cosmic catastrophes. Whether in this, as at other points, he was slyly casting doubt on the Greek tradition one cannot say. It seems plain, however, that he made, at least in his own mind, a distinction between the mythical past and what he must have accepted as at least partly historical. The synchronisms between Greek and Egyptian history he made relate to more recent times: between Sesostris and the Argonautic Expedition and " Proteus " and the Trojan era. A more general basis of comparing dates he seems to have found in the chronology of Heracles, from whom, according to Greek tradition, the royal families of various lands claimed descent. That Hecataeus was the author of the sketch of Egyptian history, which we find in a confused form in Herodotus, I have elsewhere tried to prove.16 If that be true, he may be regarded as the Father of History in the narrower sense. But even if one disregards his claims in this particular, it must be conceded that he actually laid the indispensable foundations of universal history in his chronological scheme. Like other early writers, and many of later times, he leaned too heavily on myth and legend, thinking to extract history from them by simple ration- 18 Memoirs of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, XVIII, 2, pp. 53-134. 265</page><page sequence="10">alization, and one cannot fail to detect a certain whimsical and ironic turn in his procedure; but this does not obscure the brilliancy of his conception or the merit of his achievement. It is especially significant as a conscious effort to bring within the scope of knowledge the scattered and hitherto unconnected details of geological and human history. The method he pro- jected and-too lightly-used remains the method of universal history, corrected and refined as knowledge and reflection have advanced. The universality of his outlook and purpose is par- ticularly noteworthy and stamps him as a man of genius; but, even more important, it reveals the scope and spirit of the Milesian school. His achievement in the field of history is the exact counterpart of his work in geography. As his chronological studies aimed to furnish the frame for a survey of all time, so far as it relates to man, so his chart was conceived as the frame of man's habitat, the oikoumene. Where knowledge failed, wishing as an artist to present a whole, he resorted to conjecture and pieced out the picture with many a jeu-d'esprit. He was a character as well as a savant. Xenophanes of Colophon, a city of Ionia, is said to have flourished in the sixtieth Olympiad (540-537 B.C.), which implies that he was born forty years earlier. A most interesting character, while actually standing apart as a pronounced indi- vidualist, he is nevertheless to be regarded as marking the point of transition from the phase of thought characteristic of the Ionians to that of the Italic schools. Like all individualists, he resists classification. How he should be characterized can be determined only after a detailed study of his opinions. In this we are confronted by serious difficulties; for the record is not at all of a piece. On the one hand, we possess a considerable number of fragments of his own works, all in verse, and most of them torn from their contexts; on the other, we find doxo- graphic reports, which represent him as a philosopher reasoning after the manner of Plato and Aristotle. The several pictures of him presented by these sources are difficult or impossible to reconcile. Particularly is this the case if we accept, as some historians do, the account of his thought given in the Pseudo- Aristotelian treatise On Melissus, Xenophanes, and Gorgias, to which we shall presently return; but in hardly less degree is this true also of certain statements of Aristotle and Theophrastus. 266 WT. A. AHEIDEL.</page><page sequence="11">HECATAEUS AND XENOPHANES. From his own words we learn that Xenophanes led a wander- ing life and lived to an extremely old age, at least ninety-two years, with poetic powers apparently unimpaired. He is some- times represented as a rhapsode, that is to say, as one who professionally recited the poems of another. This is not war- ranted by the statement of Diogenes Laertius,17 who merely says that he recited his own verses. We may infer that he was welcomed at such feasts as he himself describes in one of his poems, and that, like other poets, ancient and modern, he repaid his hosts by contributing to the entertainment. (An anecdote represents him as engaged in conversation with King Hieron,l8 tyrant of Syracuse, who asked Xenophanes how many servants he had, and, being told that he could scarcely support two, retorted, " But Homer, whom you berate, supports a legion even after his death." 19 He is likewise reported to have said that one must approach tyrants either not at all or else as pleasantly as possible.20 One may take this also as referring to Hieron and infer that Xenophanes spent some time at his court. If so, he was probably on the same footing with Simonides, Bacchylides, Pindar, and Aeschylus, but this must have been at the very end of his long life. It is perhaps more probable that he may have had some relation to Gelon, unless the stories are invented and without foundation.) At any rate Xenophanes is to be regarded chiefly as a poet, but a poet with exceptionally wide interests and pronounced views on many subjects. Of his wanderings and the details of his life we know next to nothing. His departure from Colophon may well have been occasioned by the actual or threatened conquest of the Ionian cities by the Persians. He must be supposed to have spent some time in Elea (Velia), a Phocaean city in southern Italy, founded ca. 553 B. C., the colonization of which he is said to have treated in a poem of some length, as he related the founding of his native Colophon in another poem.21 In Elea he is supposed to have influenced Parmenides, who is represented as his pupil; 22 though it is impossible to think of him as giving formal instruc- 17 IX, 18: avros eppafw83et T7a ' avrov. 18 478-467 B. C. In thatq case he must have lived at least 100 years as Censorinus says (15, 3). 19 Plutarch, Reg. Apophth. 175 C (Diels-Kranz, 22 A 11). 20 Diogenes Laertius, IX, 19. 21 Diogenes Laertius, IX, 20. 2a Diogenes Laertius, IX, 21. 267</page><page sequence="12">W. A. HEIDEL. tion. His poems were of different kinds. Those written in elegiacs, if we may judge by the extant fragments, were con- vivial. The remainder seem to have been written in heroic hexameters and are in a more serious strain. He is credited with a collection of Silli, or lampoons, with parodies, and with a poem entitled On Nature. All these titles are subject to suspicion. Probably one and all date from later times, and the last in particular seems to have been ill conceived. The name "lam- poons," whether or not chosen by their author, is at any rate appropriate to some of these fragments, and our sources re- peatedly refer to the castigation administered by Xenophanes to Homer and Hesiod. They extend this to " all the philosophers "; and one may with probability include in these satirical attacks the reference to Pythagoras' belief in the transmigration of souls. How one is to justify the title On Nature is not so evident. There are indeed utterances of the poet regarding the gods which are of a truly philosophic character, but a more suitable name for these would be On the Gods or Of God. There are other statements in the poet's own words and in the doxographic record relating to matters that fall within the scope of natural philosophy; but there is nothing to show, or even to suggest, that a formal treatise on these subjects was either contemplated or attempted.23 In considering his opinions we shall begin with those which show him akin to the Milesians. Here we are largely dependent on the doxographic tradition, in which unfortunately in respect to Xenophanes one can have little confidence. If, as seems probable, he wrote no formal treatise On Nature, his utterances on the various subjects mentioned may have been made casually and without explanation, leaving those who wished to ascertain his views to infer them. That the inferences were in some instances unjustified is certain, as will presently appear. In other cases one is left in doubt as to his meaning, because our sources, regarding him as the predecessor of Parmenides, inter- preted his statements in the light of subsequent thought and gave the result as his own doctrine. There is much in this record to suggest that he presented his views in his Lampoons when criticizing the popular opinions regarding the gods. Earth, Sun, Moon, Stars, and Iris (the rainbow) were popularly held 23 Cf. Burnet, Early Greek Philosophy3, pp. 115-16. 268</page><page sequence="13">HECATAEUS AND XENOPHANES. to be gods. Xenophanes, rejecting this view, used as a means of combatting it the theories of the Milesians; this he may have done without seriously subscribing to these theories, though of course he may equally well have believed that they were true. We are told that he held the doctrine of four elements,24 a statement that at least in this form is not to be accepted. At most one may believe that he somewhere, not necessarily in the same connection, mentioned earth, water, air, and fire. Again we are told that he made the dry and the moist, or earth and water, his " principles," and in evidence there are cited his words, "All things that arise and spring into existence are earth and water," the real meaning of which is betrayed by the citation of a Homeric line (II., H 99), "May ye all turn to water and earth." 25 There is here involved no philosophic doctrine of elements but the same view as we have already found in Thales and Anaximander. We are likewise assured that Xenophanes held that there were innumerable worlds.26 If there is any foundation for this statement, we do not know what it was. We shall presently find that he is credited with the view that the world is subject to periodic changes, a new world arising as the old passes away. If he said that this process was eternal, this would account for the doxographic report; or, again, he may have referred to the innumerable host of the heavens in a way to give rise to this statement. To judge by the record his view of the world was based on the meteoric process attributed generally to the Milesians. The earth naturally is the center of interest. From it arise vapors which form clouds and by progressive sublimation turn to fire, sun, moon, stars, comets, rainbows, St. Elmo's fire. The sun is just a collection of fiery particles spontaneously combining and dissolving day by day; but while it is in the heavens it promotes the meteoric process and is therefore of some use in the world, while the cold moon is a mere "dead-head." But the process reverses itself also; what goes up in evaporation returns in water, and finally the earth either dissolves into water or is reduced to the primal slime. Xenophanes, as has been stated, followed the 24 Diogenes Laertius, IX, 19; cf. Diels, Doxographi Graeci, p. 168. 25 Philoponus, In Aristotelis Physicorum Libros Commentaria, p. 125, 27-32 (Vitelli) = Diels-Kranz, 21 A 29. 26 Diogenes Laertius, IX, 19. 269</page><page sequence="14">Milesians in holding that this process had its (presumably) definite periods. He found evidence of a former state in which the earth had been submerged by the sea in marine fossils seen inland and in mountains.27 If he had himself observed all that he mentioned, we should have proof that his wanderings brought him, among other places, to Paros in the Aegean (or Pharos in the Adriatic?), to Malta, and to Syracuse in Sicily. Possibly the observation that water may be found dripping from the roofs of caves may have seemed to him further proof of the tendency of earth (stone) to convert itself into water. The parts of the world continually undergoing change could not be gods; for God is unchangeable. Sun, moon, and stars pass away; and the rainbow, known as the goddess Iris, and St. Elmo's fire, known as Castor and Pollux, are nothing but clouds. Who would accept them as gods? The earth, too, is subject to change. He said that it was neighbor to the air above, but extended indefinitely downward.28 There is no reason to think that he meant strict infinity. The doxographers, obsessed by the Aristotelian notion that the early thinkers raised the question why the earth does not fall, evidently took the statement to mean this and explained that the earth is not everywhere surrounded (and therefore is not supported) by air.29 If one may hazard a conjecture, Xenophanes may have meant to exclude a Tartarus. Among the phenomena to which he referred, one may mention, aside from lightning, which he may have felt called on to explain in order to dispel the fear of Zeus KaratfcrraT, the eruption of the volcanoes on the Lipari Islands. He is reported to have said that on one occasion the fire failed to show itself for sixteen years and reappeared in the seventeenth.30 Whether this interested him in connection with the periodic cycle one cannot say. The statement of Aetius that he regarded the earth as compacted of air and fire 31 may perhaps be founded on a description of a volcano. Without instituting comparisons or contrasts in detail one readily recognizes in this survey of his opinions about natural phenomena a community of interest and point of view with the Milesians. The agreement, however, does not end there but 27 Cf. Diels-Kranz, 21 A 33. 28 Diels-Kranz, 21 B 28. 29 Cf. Diels-Kranz, 21 A 47. 20 Diels-Kranz, 21 A 48. 31 Aetius, III, 9, 4 (Diels-Kranz, 21 A 47).

Not only did he compose accounts of the colonization of Colophon and Elea but he displayed a historical outlook in more general ways. He said that the Greeks first learned from Homer 32 probably not only that the gods were anthropomorphic and shared the frailties of men 33 but also, as Herodotus believed, the names and functions of the gods; 34 and he declared Homer older than Hesiod.35 He derived the love of luxury among the Ionians from the Lydians 36 and, probably in the same connection, attributed to the latter the invention of coinage,37 which he may have regarded as the root of all evil. At all events this datum displays his interest in discoveries and inventions (e{p7xtzara), an interest henceforth destined constantly to engage historians. Whether the myths of culture heroes, like Prometheus, Triptolemus, and Palamedes, and of gods, like Dionysus, had already received wide currency in his day we do not know; apparently he knew and rejected them, as he rejected other myths, declaring, " The gods did not reveal all things to mortals in the beginning, but by searching in the course of time they discover the better." 38 In the same spirit as Anaximander he gave his own age in one of his poems 39 and suggested as a worthy question, " How old were you when the Mede came? " 40 One wonders whether, in referring satirically to Pythagoras' belief in transmigration,41 he attempted to trace the derivation of the belief, perhaps from Egypt, as Herodotus imagined it.42 His interest in ethnology he showed in his reference to the snub-nosed black gods of the Ethiopians and the blue-eyed fair gods of the Thracians.43 He is said also to have expressed his admiration for Thales' achievement in astronomy 44 and to have repeated the rumor that Epimenides attained an age of 154 years,45 an interest not improbable, when we reflect that he himself lived long and that his faculties were apparently unimpaired at the age of 92.

These data, generally lightly passed over, are of the greatest significance for the spirit of the age. They are characteristic of the latter half of the sixth century, when the foundations of history were being laid and the data began to be assembled which the Sophists and philosophers of the following centuries were to use with freedom as matters of common knowledge. In all this Xenophanes was essentially following in the foot- steps of the Milesians, though it is probable that he varied their theories in detail and added observations of his own, such as those regarding fossils. Whether the earlier Milesians had spoken of fossils we do not know: we have every reason, however, for believing that the observations recorded by Herodotus (II, 12) were derived from Hecataeus, a contemporary of Xenophanes, whose visit to Egypt probably dates about 525 B. C. Without assuming dependence of either on the other one may infer that Milesians had made similar observations before in support of their cosmic theories. If we are right, however, in our view that Xenophanes intro- duced his conception of nature in his criticism of the popular theology, we do him no injustice in assuming that all this was of secondary importance to him. His original contribution would then be in another direction. It is not uncommon that one who believes that he has a revolutionary message avails himself of current science in combatting the popular notions which he must overthrow. The more revolutionary his own views, the less concerned he is about the particular weapon he employs in clearing the way for the reception of the new truth. As has already been suggested, it was in his theology that Xenophanes displayed his originality, and there also, apparently, lay his chief interest. Certainly he departed most widely in this regard from the Milesians. There is no evidence that the latter, with the exception of Hecataeus, were conscious of a break with the religion of their people; for they could still observe the customary rites of the city, and if they were aware of interpreting the gods differently they could point to the accepted authorities, Homer and Hesiod, as not obscurely imply- 46 Diels-Kranz, 21 B 21. W. A. HEIDEL. 272</page><page sequence="17">HECATAEUS AND XENOPHANES. ing what they themselves taught. What their theories implied was that the myths current among the people were not to be taken literally, the philosopher recognizing the truth behind the poetic imagery. At all events they were men of science who in sober prose set forth the truth as they saw it. For Xenophanes the case must necessarily present itself under a different aspect. As a poet, especially as an epic poet, he was inevitably coming into competition with Homer and Hesiod. In his accounts of the founding of Colophon and Elea he must have felt that he was departing from these models, even if he may have woven into his story a certain amount of earlier legend. He belonged to an age in which the poet no longer disappeared from view behind the muse he invoked and the theme that was all in all in the older time. Archilochus, Stesichorus, Sappho, Alcaeus, Mimnermus, Anacreon, Simonides, and Pindar stood out as personalities, each after his kind, and even Hesiod, in the Works and Days, the one poem we may certainly attribute to him, had discarded the anonymity of the epic poet. A spirit of criticism was abroad as the complement of the strong expression of one's own opinion. All this made for frank expression of personal views in opposition to what others might think or might have thought. But with Xenophanes, we must assume, there were other and more important considerations urging him to self-expression. In his criticism of Homer and Hesiod, to which his words and the record bear witness, he was prompted not by a petty jealousy but by something infinitely greater, by moral indignation. Even in a poem for a convivial occasion he cannot refrain from referring to the myths as fictions to be banished from the feast along with factional bickerings.47 A pious prayer to the gods for strength to do one's honorable work he commended as most fitting.48 In another he takes up the theme of the relative value of wisdom and athletic prowess, which gains all the plaudits and rewards from the vulgar49-a theme which Euripides developed and which Plato did not disdain to have Socrates slightly vary in 47 Diels-Kranz, 21 B 1, lines 21-23. 48 Ibid., lines 15-16.

Nothing, it would seem, could more clearly indicate the spirit that animated Xenophanes in his strictures upon Homer and Hesiod and the unworthy representa- tions of the gods for which he held them accountable. His conception of God was essentially determined by his moral ideal, as was natural in a man of character and profound convictions; but it was colored also by esthetic predilections and notions of fitness. His moral earnestness appears most strikingly in the indignation he expresses at the characterization of the gods by Homer and Hesiod, who attribute to them all that among men is a shame and a reproach, theft, adultery, and mutual deceit.50 Timon described him as wanting in pretense,51 which may refer to his modest disclaimer of certainty, but must include sincerity and intellectual integrity. The anecdotes told of him emphasize this trait of his character. Aristotle relates that when the people of Elea asked him whether they should mourn Leucothea, he counseled them if they regarded her as a goddess not to mourn her, if as a human being, not to offer her sacrifice.52 Plutarch tells similar tales regarding his advice to the Egyptians about Osiris.53 No doubt the stories are apocryphal and were intended primarily to enforce his doctrine that gods are eternal, being neither born nor subject to death; but they illustrate the conviction men had of his integrity. Of like tenor is the anecdote related by Plutarch, who bids one not to look glum or to be afraid when taunted but to do as Xenophanes did, who, when Lasus of Hermione called him a coward because he would not gamble with him, confessed that he was an arrant coward and wanting in courage when it came to doing anything shameful.54 Aristotle reports that according to Xenophanes a challenge to take an oath was not fair as between a pious and an unscrupulous man, but as if a strong man challenged a weakling to engage in a hand-to-hand fight.55 In keeping with this obvious integrity is the frank confession of Xenophanes that 60 Diels-Kranz, 21 B 11. 61 Diels-Kranz, 21 A 35. 6a Aristotle, Rhetoric 1400 B 5-8. 3 De Iside 379 B, De Superstitione 171 D-E. 4 De Vitioso Pudore 530 E-F. 5 Aristotle, Rhetoric 1377 A 19-21. 274 W.

His conviction, however, is not born of knowledge but of faith,-of faith in an ideal projected by his own character. He perceived that the Ethiopian and the Thracian fashioned their gods in their own image: he was naturally not aware that he was doing the same. Endless questions arise when one asks how Xenophanes con- ceived of God. The authentic record is scanty and not free from contradiction. "There is one God, supreme among gods and men, like unto mortals neither in body nor in mind." 57 "He sees all over, thinks all over, and hears all over." 58 "Without effort he sways all things by the thought of his mind." 59 " He remains always in the same place unmoved; it beseems him not to fare now hither now thither." 60 From this description one would conclude that Xenophanes conceived of God as a spirit, after the analogy of his inner self, though without the limitations of man. One need not press the contradiction of " One God, supreme among gods," 61 because one finds similar incongruities of expression among the Hebrews who were at least trying to be monotheists; nor is one entitled to say that Xenophanes had fully succeeded in this respect. It suffices to recognize an ideal forming and striving to realize itself. To the characterization above given we are justified in adding the thought that God is eternal, not born or subject to death, and that the conception of a god does not comport with the belief that one god can be overlord and another his servant, or that a god should be wanting in anything. All this tends to a spiritual monotheism, however much the thought or the expression may fall short of completely realizing that ideal. 66 Diels-Kranz, 21 B 34. 57 Diels-Kranz, 21 B 23. 68 Diels-Kranz, 21 B 24. 59 Diels-Kranz, 21 B 25. 60 Diels-Kranz, 21 B 26; cf.

'1 Diels-Kranz, 21 B 23, line 1. 275</page><page sequence="20">Later writers give one a very different conception, representing Xenophanes as identifying God with the world and therefore as being a pantheist. This view seems hard to reconcile with the words of Xenophanes above set forth and is found in authors belonging to the doxographic tradition. We have, therefore, every reason to seek the source of this conception in Aristotle and behind Aristotle we may look for Plato. The latter, in a playful passage,62 represents the stranger from Elea as saying that the philosophers clothe their thought in mythical form, as if telling nursery tales, representing the cosmic entities as acting like human beings, fighting with one another or marrying and bringing up children; " but the Eleatic tribe, from our country, beginning with Xenophanes and even farther back, recount their tale, implying that the so-called All is One." At best one can reasonably infer nothing from these words regarding the thought of Xenophanes, except that Plato for whatever reason associated him with the Eleatics, among whom he must have had Parme- nides chiefly in mind. Aristotle, however, in this instance, as in others, seems to have taken Plato quite literally and therefore regarded Xenophanes as in his philosophy essentially agreeing with Parmenides. It is this conviction that obviously inspired the reconstruction of the thought of Xenophanes in the Pseudo- Aristotelian treatise De M. X. G. Now Aristotle himself in the Metaphysics,63 speaking of the Eleatics says: " Parmenides seems to lay hold on that which is one in formula, Melissus on that which is one in matter, for which reason the former says that it is limited, the latter that it is unlimited; while Xeno- phanes, the first of this school of monists (for Parmenides is said to have been his pupil), gave no clear statement, nor does he seem to have grasped either of these two kinds of unity, but, modeling his conception on the whole heavens, he says the One is God." However we interpret this, we obtain no clear concep- tion. If, as Aristotle implies, Xenophanes gave no hint as to the sense in which he used the term " One," there is no ground in what he says for identifying the One God with the universe. Theophrastus, however, as was his manner, pushed the definition still farther and identified the God of Xenophanes with the 62 Sophist 242 C-D. 68 Metaphysics 986 B 18-24; cf. Cherniss, Aristotle's Criticism of Pre- socratic Philosophy, p. 201, n. 228. W. A. HEIDEL. 276</page><page sequence="21">HECATAEUS AND XENOPHANES. world, saying that God is spherical.64 It seems clear that in this he was influenced by the assumption that Xenophanes as the teacher of Parmenides had thought of God as Parmenides imagined the All; but it is hardly conceivable that Plato and Aristotle would have spoken of the relation between these thinkers in such vague and uncertain terms if there were adequate grounds for thinking that one was the teacher of the other. So far as the authentic record goes, the sole point at which their thought agrees is in the emphasis laid upon unity; but the unity is in one case that of God, in the other that of the world. Only if one identified God with the world could one establish a close relation; that was gradually achieved by the tradition, though it was based upon mere conjecture and influenced by the desire to place Xenophanes definitely in the line of school successions. Viewed dispassionately, Xenophanes appears as a figure set apart. He was essentially a minstrel, who could contribute something to a festive occasion, but a minstrel of rather excep- tional character. He was not a Mimnermus or an Anacreon but a man of lofty ideals and strong convictions, which led him not only to criticize sharply the received and current views but also to suggest his own. In this respect he did not stand alone, for other contemporaries did the same. What distinguishes him from them is his earnestness and the sublimity of his conception. If Parmenides caught some of his spirit and applied his thought to his own cosmic philosophy, that is no more than can be said of others who stood in no personal relation to him. Aside from his theological views what we learn about Xenophanes' interests and notions places him entirely in the group of Milesian thinkers, especially with Hecataeus. But in spirit here also he stands apart; for, though each sought to rationalize religion, whereas Hecataeus sought by indirection to undermine current concep- tions of the gods, Xenophanes attacked them with indignation. We have in the one a reformer, in the other a rationalist whose weapon is sly ridicule and persiflage. t W. A. HIEDEL. a4 Theophrastus, Phys. Op. 5; cf.
