<plain_text><page sequence="1">3 THE ARAPA AND THUNDERBOLT STELAE: A CASE OF STYLISTIC IDENTITY WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR PUCARA INFLUENCES IN THE AREA OF TIAHUANACO Sergio Jorge Ch?vez Archaeologists have long been aware of the striking stylistic similarities between the Arapa stela (see fig. 1, upper portion) from the District of Arapa, Province of Az?ngaro in the Department of Puno, Peru, and a like piece of several fragments called the "Thunderbolt" by Posnansky, from Tiahuanaco, Bolivia (see fig. 1, lower portion). I shall demonstrate that the two pieces are definitely from a single stela, most probably originating from the Pucar? culture region in Peru, and providing us with a case of stylistic identity between the pieces of stone sculpture from the two ends of Lake Titicaca. Questions regard ing the time and direction of transportation of one fragment are posed. Description and History The stepped stela from Arapa is of pinkish-white fine-textured quartzite or quartzitic sandstone, with dimensions as follows: Overall height of broken stela 347 cm. Width 77.5 to 78 cm. Thickness 24 cm. It has a rectangular cross section, and is carved in low relief of 1 cm., or slightly less, on the two opposite broad faces only. Three and one half design panels are carved on each face and there is a narrower, smaller decorated area filling the uppermost part near the step or notch. On one face, the upper narrow area contains two small frogs or toads, while the opposite face has two curled "snakes"; for ease of reference I shall refer to the former face as face A and the latter as face B. 2 Kidder briefly summarized the history of the Arapa stela from the time Antonio Raimondi first noted it as a door lintel in the church there, to Uhlefs photograph of it there when it was still a single piece,1* its mention by Palacios,^ and Kidderfs own photographs of both faces and his description of it when it was in two pieces inside the door of the new Arapa church. He also described the site itself where he found no artifacts from the Pucar? culture.6 It is notable that when Uhle photographed the stela (what I designate as face B), it was in a single piece as a lintel, but when Kidder photographed it the stela was in two pieces, as one can observe it now outside the church, the larger piece on the left and the smaller on the right (see figs. 2 and 3). Mary B. Kidder, Dr. Kidder1s wife who accompanied him to Arapa on June 24, 1939, writing about the Arapa stela states, Most unfortunately, when Dr. Pardo [Dr. Luis A. Pardo, then Director of the Archaeological Institute of Cuzco] journeyed down to see it he ordered it cut in two to be moved to the museum in Puno before he troubled to find</page><page sequence="2">4 out that he couldn't possibly move it anyway. According to several informants in Arapa, whom I questioned concerning the stela's location prior to its incorporation as a lintel in the church, the stela came from Islapuncu or Island Passage, an area just southeast of the village. While Kidder did not locate Pucar? style ceramics in either the village or the surrounding area, another inform ant told me of pottery containing abundant mica ("gold") found in Trapiche, located some distance behind the church. In any case, as Kidder pointed out, the Pucar? occupation in or near Arapa needs to be precisely located. Kidder was also shown a slab with a standing human figure in high relief ? which was in the Islapuncu area, but today is located outside the church door on the right. This slab, with a human figure holding a trophy head in each hand, possesses Pucar? elements and may represent the only other evidence of Pucar? occupation in the Arapa region, although in 1973, in a house in Arapa, I located a broken mono lith (referred to here as Arapa 3),^ to be described below, which some what resembles the Arapa stela, and in 1974 I recorded a previously unknown and recently discovered complete Pucar? statue from Villa de Betanzos near Arapa. In reassessing the comparisons of this Arapa stela with the Bolivian "Thunderbolt11 or stone sculpture No. 40 of Bennett, I real ized that the two pieces form a single, large stela. Uhle first point ed out the similarities between the two,^ and others have done so since,*2 particularly Kidder who concluded, "The two are not only similar, but so nearly identical, as far as comparison is possible, as to suggest very strongly that they were the work of the same individual or group of artists," but the incompleteness of available illustra tions apparently allowed no further conclusions. In 1945 Posnansky illustrated the Bolivian piece, but with omissions and errors and with no scale or measurements. Referring to the Thunderbolt stela, Posnansky says, We came to know it in a small museum established by Colonel R?os Ponce, meritorious and exceptional resident of Tihuanacu, in the plaza of the modern village. About the year 1903 [1904 in the parallel Spanish version of this text], we took on a large plate, the photograph of which we are publishing in Fig. 152a [should be Fig. 152]. When we first saw this archaeological piece it was placed horizontally with the back against the wall of the room where the worthy Colonel R?os Ponce kept it. The Museo Tihuanacu was then dismantled after his death and Don M. C. Ballivi?n saved some of the things for the Museo of La Paz of that time. However, this interesting block had disappeared and for many years no one knew any thing about it. Recently, only a few years ago, we were</page><page sequence="3">5 informed by certain "llockallas" of Tihuanacu that some thing very valuable was "shut up" in the "tambo11 of the village. We went there, along with the Director of the Museum, and indeed, in a room from which they had re moved the doors, closed up the entrance with bricks and plastered the outside in order to hide the location of the old door?after having "unlocked" this place?we found, cast on the floor and broken into pieces, the famous piece that we had been able to photograph about 1903: another vandalio act of the regrettable greed of the iconoclasts of the present day who surely, since this was the "custom," suspected that the piece contained gold and therefore destroyed it completely. We had the larg est piece of the "stelle" brought out and we immediately noticed that on the back part it had sculpturing as in teresting or even more interesting than those in front. Figure 153a [should be Fig. 153] shows the rest of the famous piece and Fig. 153b [should be Fig. 153a] the little that it was possible to reconstruct in the sche matic drawing.^ Apparently when Posnansky originally photographed the stela, he did not realize there was carving on the opposite face; it was only when the piece had been broken and moved that he became aware of the other face, and the new photo shows only a fragment rather than the com plete opposite face. Posnansky felt the stela had originally been set in the ground because of the pedestal base and that it "probably formed a part of a shrine to the thunderbolt and the tempest, the carriers of the fertilizing rain."*^ Further, when Posnansky compared the Bolivian stela fragment to the two stelae from Hatuncolla, he misleadingly stated he was providing schematic drawings of the latter, when in reality he reproduced only one face of one of them (his fig. 154a). The other drawing he labels as a "stele from Hatun-Kolla" (his fig. 154b), is actually part of face of the Arapa stela from which he has omitted the step form at the top and instead placed vertical lines reconstructing it as though it continued upward. He also reconstructs the lowest panel of the Arapa stela without noting that the Bolivian fragment itself com pletes this panel. His fig. 154c shows the broken upper portion of face A of the Arapa stela, upside down, again omitting the step form. All of these drawings have been a source of error and confusion for others. Uhle provides additional information on the provenience of the Bolivian piece: In the excavations of the "Palacio" to the west of the Stonehenge [Qalasasaya] was found in years past, almost superficially, a pillar (fig. 9) carved with ornaments in the shape of volutes and zigzags, different from the usu al ones in the ruins. We now know many more pillars from the Lake Titicaca Basin carved in a similar manner, like one from Arapa (fig. 13), another from Caminaca (still in its place), and two from Hatuncolla (fig. 14), now in the</page><page sequence="4">6 museum of Lima. Uhle may be referring to the excavations made by Georges Courty in Tiahuanaco in 1903 when he found the "Palacio,11 now referred to as Putuni by Ponce (east of Kheri-qala and west of the Qalasasaya) as well as other structuresapparently just before Posnansky photographed the Thunderbolt piece. Uhle1s illustration of the Bolivian piece shows the same face as does Posnansky1s 1903 photograph, but it is longitudinally obstructed, apparently by a stone covering the other horizontal portion (if one views his photo upside down this becomes clear); so again, the illustra tion is incomplete. It may be that Uhle photographed the piece while it was in the museum of Colonel R?os Ponce to which Posnansky refers. Today the Bolivian portion is in the Tiahuanaco Museum, in six pieces as can be seen in fig. 4b, and as I observed during my visit there on August 17, 1973 (fig. 4a). Since no measurements had ever been pub lished, it was not until 1973 that I was able to obtain the dimensions of the Thunderbolt to support the other evidence which pointed to the match between it and the Arapa stela. The complete dimensions are exactly the same: Width 78 cm. Thickness 24 cm. The length is 2.28 m., making the total original height of the stela 5.75 m., one of the tallest stone stelae ever reported from Peru, and belonging to the Pucar? style. Combining the Arapa and Thunderbolt pieces, there is a total of five rectangular design panels on each face of the complete stela (fig; 1), a smaller narrow area at the top near the step, and an un carved portion at the base to be set into the ground. In addition to the dimensions, evidence that the two pieces fit together can be seen in the order of the design panels on each face. The order of the five designs on face A is exactly the reverse of those on face B, so that the panels on each face, numbered 1-5 from top to bottom, show the following combi nations (see fig. 1): Face A Face Panel 1 5 2 4 3 3 4 2 5 1 Only when the Arapa and Thunderbolt fragments are joined is this design arrangement apparent. The location of the break with respect to the de sign panels in both the Arapa and the Bolivian pieces coincides very neatly, and in 1973 the outlines of the broken parts were matched.</page><page sequence="5">7 Furthermore, the material of both pieces is the same, a banded quartzite. The width and location of the bands, parallel to the broad faces, exactly coincide (compare bands in figs. 3a and 4a). Small samples have been taken from both the Arapa and the Thunderbolt pieces for neutron activation analysis, already arranged at the University of Michigan laboratory, 9 in order to demonstrate that the stone came from a single source and to permit future determination of the quarry or stone source from which the material for the stela came. With this problem in mind, it was discovered that the fa?ade of the Arapa church today is constructed of what appears to be the same fine-textured, band ed quartzite including some of a pinkish color. Informants said that this stone comes from a nearby source on a hill called Mumu to the west of and overlooking Arapa. On a return trip in the summer of 1974 the Mumu hill was explored and samples of quartzite were obtained for future neutron activation analysis. Stylistic Comparisons The Arapa-Thunderbolt stela belongs to the Pucar? style as shown by the multiplicity of similarities to other stelae from the Pucar? culture area, including one from Hatuncolla and the Pucar? plaza stela, as has been pointed out by other authors, as well as to the Arapa 3 stela (fig. 12, to be discussed) and new finds from Yapura. Pucar? style elements which link the Arapa-Thunderbolt stela with other Pucar? stone sculpture of the northern Lake Titicaca region include: the frog/ toad motif, the checkered-cross motif, the curled "tadpole11 or "snake" with trapezoidal head having long volute appendages, relief rings, step designs, the double "jagged-S" element, and the general form with a step in one upper corner. The closest similarity within the Pucar? style lies with face A of the Pucar? plaza stela (fig. 5a).2* The uppermost panel on face A of the Pucar? plaza stela best compares to face A panel 1 and face panel 5 of the Arapa-Thunderbolt stela; this double jagged-S motif also appears on two additional lower panels on face A of the Pucar? stela. The use and positioning of the stepped corner elements on the lower pan els of this same face are similar to those on the Arapa-Thunderbolt stela face A panel 1, face panel 5, and panel 3 of both faces, including the framing of eared "serpents," though the elements themselves differ in some respects. Also, the relief rings as corner elements on face A of the Pucar? stela are similar to the rings on face A panel 5 and face panel 1 of the Arapa-Thunderbolt stela, although the former are within stepped frames while the latter are not. Checkered crosses contained in four square elements on face of the Pucar? plaza stela (fig. 5b) com pare to the checkered-cross motifs on the Arapa-Thunderbolt stela faces A and panels 2 and 4 of both faces. In addition, the outline of the top of the Pucar? plaza stela resembles the heads of the trapezoidal headed motifs with volute appendages on the Arapa-Thunderbolt stela face A panels 3 and 4, face panels 2 and 3. Detailed comparisons were made by Kidder, and he states, "The total impression in comparing the two stones is one of close technical equivalence (the reliefs are done as though by the same carver) and common conceptual motivation."22 The</page><page sequence="6">trapezoidal-headed animals with volute appendages behind the heads on the Arapa-Thunderbolt stela face A panels 3 and 4, and face panels 2 and 3 constitute a motif which links this stela with monoliths of what Karen Ch?vez and I have called the Asiruni substyle, some of which also have trapezoidal-shaped animal heads with coiled appendages behind the head.2** The Pucar? plaza stela comparison permits the Arapa-Thunderbolt stela also to be compared with a seated, headless anthropomorphic figure of magnetite in the University Museum, Philadelphia, of unknown prove nience (catalogued as coming from "Tiahuanaco, Peru") described and illustrated by Kidder (fig. 6, pis. VI and VII). Kidder shows simi larities between this figure and monoliths, including the Pucar? plaza stela, the Arapa stela, and one Hatuncolla stela, from the Pucar? region where he believes the statuette was originally made. He also compares it to the Pokotia statues from Bolivia,26 and it can be further compared to the Bern statuette collected by Johann Jakob von Tschudi at Tiahuanaco.2^ Two small "lightning stones" can also be compared to the Arapa Thunderbolt stela and the Pucar? plaza stela. One of these small stones comes from the southern margin of Lake Titicaca 2** (fig. 7). Posnansky indicated that the Indians said this stone was to prevent lightning from striking the house. The rollout (fig. 7d) shows two mirror image figures, each composed of three connecting serpent forms, on opposite sides of the stone with a checkered cross on the top between them. This motif with three connecting serpents resembles elements on panel 3 of faces A and of the Arapa-Thunderbolt stela, but most closely compares to the top pan el of face of the Pucar? plaza stela (fig. 5b). The latter panel has a design very similar to the lightning stone elements with mirror image serpent figures disposed opposite one another, although on the Pucar? plaza stela a relief ring replaces the checkered cross found on the lightning stone. The other small lightning stone (fig. 8) which comes from Escoma, Omasuvu, Bolivia, was given to the Ethnographic Museum in Berlin by Max Uhle, and has not been illustrated since Uhle1s publication. Uhle separated this specimen, along with others, from typical Tiahuanaco style sculpture. The piece is similar in size and style to the one just described. Assuming the opposite side of the stone to have the same motif of three connecting serpents, in mirror image to those on the side shown and separated from them by the cross on top, then the two lightning stones are very similar, suggestive of being a pair. The same compari sons to the Arapa-Thunderbolt and Pucar? plaza stelae can be made for this stone as were made for the one described above. The triangular headed, eared serpents and the checkered-cross motif of the lightning stones are to be found in the Yaya-Mama style,30 but these elements con tinue into Pucar? style sculpture; it is the arrangement of the motifs that make the lightning stones resemble the Pucar? style more than the Yaya-Mama style. Two fragments were found in 1967 in the village of Yapura near Capachica and have been reported by Margaret A. Hoyt.3* As a result of hearing about the stela from Hoyt, Karen Ch?vez, three students, and I</page><page sequence="7">9 visited the site on August 15, 1973, at which time we uncovered the bur ied portions, made rubbings, and obtained additional information.32 On the Yapura fragments,3 the intricate style of elements, both curvilin ear and rectilinear, disposed with the same kind of symmetry within rectangular panels on two broad faces of a stela form, is similar to the Arapa-Thunderbolt stela, and may represent a "common conceptual motiva tion," to use Kidderfs phrase. Although similar elements are found on the Arapa-Thunderbolt stela and the Yapura fragments, they are combined differently on the two. Similar motifs include relief rings; trapezoi dal-headed animals; the jagged-S element; and frogs/toads and coiled serpents situated in the center of panels. However, the jagged-S ele ment on the Yapura pieces is single, not double, and more elongated than the oval to round ones on the Arapa-Thunderbolt stela; the Yapura ser pents are double-headed and central panel motifs are unframed. Also, the larger Yapura fragment indicates no reversal in the order of panels on opposite faces, as is found on the Arapa-Thunderbolt stela; the Yapura panels lack corner motifs; and the Yapura trapezoidal-headed animals have unique squared eyes and possess legs. Specifically, the designs in the complete panel on the south face of the larger Yapura fragment and the nearly complete panel on the north face of the same fragment, are extremely similar to those on face A panel 5 and face panel 1 of the Arapa-Thunderbolt stela (see fig. 1). The elements in the middle of the sides and top and bottom of the Arapa Thunderbolt design panels may be compared to the bodies of the trapezoi dal-headed animals on the Yapura panels, especially the versions shown on the sides of the panel on the north face where the bodies are split. These split, double-triangular elements on the Arapa-Thunderbolt stela are oriented in the same way as the animal bodies on the Yapura frag ment, inward on the top and bottom of the panel, and outward on the sides. On both monuments the similar elements are joined by a continu ous, twisting band interrupted by zigzags of which there are two on the Arapa-Thunderbolt piece, and one set on the Yapura fragments. A similar comparison can be made with face A panel 1 and face panel 5 of the Arapa-Thunderbolt stela, although in these panels the twisting bands are double and not continuous, since the split, double-triangular elements have here been completely divided and are represented by two unconnected zigzags from which the twisting bands issue. These panels, in turn, can be compared with panels on face A of the Pucar? plaza stela (fig. 5a). Furthermore, there are similarities between face A panel 2 and face panel 4 of the Arapa-Thunderbolt stela and the incomplete panels on the larger Yapura fragment. Both have stepped rectilinear motifs, and the split, double-triangular elements on the Arapa-Thunderbolt piece are paralleled by similar elements in the same position on the Yapura panel. In the incomplete Yapura panels there are apparently only two animals facing in opposite directions away from the center of each panel, while on the Arapa-Thunderbolt stela there are no animal heads. Only on panels 3 and 4 of face A and 2 and 3 of face of the Arapa-Thunderbolt stela are there actually large animal heads (with coiled appendages be hind the head). On panel 3 of both faces all four animals face outward from the center of the panel and have bodies consisting of a solid</page><page sequence="8">10 trapezoidal element attached to a hollow rectangle; the two animal heads of panel 4 of face A and panel 2 of face also face outward from the center but have bodies composed of divided stepped elements. On panel 3 of both faces the long curved appendages emanating from the four corner elements and from the central diamond are not continuous, but end in ani mal heads with small zigzags on one side of the band behind each such head. It can be suggested that on panels 1 and 5 of faces A and respec tively, the zigzagging of the continuous curvilinear bands represents the overlapping or joining of the animals which are separated on panel 3. The Arapa-Thunderbolt monolith may also be compared to one of the Hatuncolla stelae,34 but not to the other.35 This first Hatuncolla stela (fig. 13) shares the following characteristics with the Arapa Thunderbolt piece: motifs in panels which include checkered crosses; frogs/toads; nested, multiple-step designs; and corner elements. It differs from the Arapa-Thunderbolt stela, however, in that panels are not in reverse order on opposite faces and all four faces are decorated. Further comparisons can be made with the Arapa 3 monolith, re corded on August 5, 1973, described and illustrated here for the first time (fig. 12). This quartzite block was located in the house of Luis Abarca Sotomayor in Arapa and has been in the possession of his family from his grandparents1 time. Although its original provenience is un known, the owner said it probably came from Arapa. The block has low relief carving on one face only; the other three faces and the flat bottom surface are polished. The uppermost part of the stone is broken, so that the total height is unknown. The monolith could have been a pan el or one of a series of panels, although it lacks the framing margins of the stelae already mentioned. The element which most closely compares to one on the Arapa-Thunderbolt stela is the step motif with coiled serpent appendages terminating in triangular heads. Panel 3 on faces A and of the Arapa-Thunderbolt stela has half of such a stepped element in each of the four corners of the panel from each of which emanates a coiled ser pent appendage ending in a trapezoidal head. The stepped elements, how ever, are not solid, and the scroll appendages emanate from what appears to be the top of the step (had the element been complete) rather than from the bottom. The animal on the Arapa 3 block has an unusual triangu lar head which tapers to a kind of snout, and the circular eyes consist of two concentric grooves, the outer groove of the eye on the right over lapping that on the left. The front legs of the animal are in the same position as those of the trapezoidal-headed animal on the incomplete pan els of the larger Yapura fragment.36 Original Location and Subsequent Movement The question now arises as to the original location of the com plete Arapa-Thunderbolt stela; the direction of movement, from north to south or south to north, of one of its portions; and the time such move ment of one of the pieces may have occurred. Insofar as the direction of movement is concerned, while present evidence is incomplete, it is my be lief that the Arapa-Thunderbolt stela was originally erected in or near Arapa in Pucar? times, roughly during the first century B.C.; later it</page><page sequence="9">11 was broken in two and the basal portion was transported to Tiahuanaco, a straight-line distance of 220 km.37 The most convincing evidence that the Arapa-Thunderbolt stela came originally from Puno is the fact that the Pucar? substyle to which it belongs has so far been found only around the northern Lake Titicaca Basin, as demonstrated by the comparisons we have made with the Pucar? plaza stela, one of the Hatuncolla stelae, and the Yapura fragments, as well as with the Arapa 3 monolith. These stelae combine a distinctive composition, technique, and stylization of elements, and form a separate group within the Pucar? style. The home of this substyle, then, appears to be in Puno. While other Pucar? style sculpture has been found on the southern end of the lake in Bolivia, no examples of this particular sub style occur there. In fact, in Bennett1s classification of Tiahuanaco stone sculpture, the Thunderbolt piece and only this piece is placed in his Style 8, Geometric Patterns.30 The report of village residents giving the original position of the Arapa stela as always having been in the Islapuncu even before its use as the church lintel, would be important testimony in support of my case; but while this account may be true, it is also possibly unreli able. More convincing, however, is the material (quartzite) from which the stela is made. This material is apparently present near the town of Arapa, as indicated by the banded quartzite church fa?ade and the ac count that the quartzite used in the fatjade comes from the hill Mumu. The results of p?trographie and neutron activation analyses should settle this point. Arguments concerning the time of transportation will differ depending on the assumed direction of transport, though some considera tions are applicable to either case. Following my hypothesized direc tion of movement from Puno to the south, there is evidence to support the possibility that the transportation of the basal portion to Bolivia was made prior to the European conquest, perhaps in early post-Pucar? or in Tiahuanaco times, and conceivably indicating a pattern of reuse of earlier stone sculpture as religious symbols or cult objects. The best evidence for pre-conquest transport of the Thunder bolt stone lies in its having been found in the Palacio, a Tiahuanaco construction, as reported by Uhle in 1912. Transportation of the piece from Arapa in post-conquest times does not seem reasonable in view of the fact that many pieces could easily have been obtained at the site of Tiahuanaco itself with much less effort, for whatever reasons those people might have needed such a stone: for decorative purposes, curios ity pieces, or use as building material. This kind of reasoning could also apply against an argument for the Bolivia to Arapa direction of transportation. Furthermore, anyone having brought the piece at the cost of so much effort over such a distance would surely not have aban doned it in the ruins of the Palacio. In addition, transportation in Colonial times is unlikely, since we would expect destruction of such monoliths by Spanish conquerors in order to do away with early "pagan" images, and not purposeful transportation and reuse of them, though</page><page sequence="10">12 there may have been exceptions. The Arapa piece was, however, used in the Catholic church there for practical reasons, having an appropriate and ready made form for a lintel. In support of my suggestion that there existed a pattern of re use of earlier stone sculpture by later inhabitants, the case of the Semi subterranean Temple at Tiahuanaco presents a documented instance. In Bennett's 1932 excavations in the Temple, within his Pit VII, he found Stela 15 associated with Stela 10;^ the two were aligned side by side as if they had been erected upright one next to the other. Bennett placed Stela 15 (his Style 3) into Group III stylistic group which probably corresponded to Decadent Tiahuanaco times, and Stela 10 into Group II corresponding to Classic Tiahuanaco times.^ He dated the Semi-subter ranean Temple as late, with earlier materials being brought together, reused. Ponce, however, dates the Temple as well as Stela 15 to his Epoch III; Stela 10 is assigned to Epoch IV. Ponce believes that Stela 10 was placed in the Epoch III Temple during Epoch IV, when Stela 15 was moved slightly to one side in order to do so. Given this interpreta tion, we find that during Epoch IV times reuse, or continued use, of an earlier style stone sculpture in the patio of the Temple itself occurred, suggesting the importance and perhaps veneration of these stone represen tations. If we can assume this practice was acceptable in Classic Tiahuanaco times (Epoch IV), then we could argue that the Classic Tiahuanaco people were responsible for the reuse of the Thunderbolt stone dating from Pucar? times and coming from the site of Arapa. That is to say, it may have been that Classic Tiahuanaco religious functionaries brought or had brought this Arapa fragment to Tiahuanaco as a venerated object to be incorporated into the Palacio, reflecting perhaps their concern with identifying with their past. There are various problems which arise from this explanation, however, and further work is needed to prove or disprove any of the pos sibilities mentioned here. There is the problem, for example, of why only the basal portion, a piece which has almost more uncarved than carved area, was moved. Possibly it was intended to bring the upper part later. One might postulate a concept of the base representing the "root" to be "grown" again in its new location, but there is no way to verify such a conjecture. Reuse of Stela 15, belonging to a style we have suggested is pre-Pucar?,1+3 does not necessarily mean that the Classic Tiahuanaco people would reuse a Pucar? style stela in the same manner. Another problem is the date of the Palacio itself; is this structure of Epoch IV date? Why would only the Arapa stela, and not others, be selected, or was it? Was the site of Arapa unoccupied at the time? Are there indica tions of Tiahuanaco presence near Arapa (although numerous reasons could be given for Tiahuanaco presence in the area)? Tiahuanaco pottery has been found at least as far north as Juliaca,1*1* and in 1973 we recorded Tiahuanaco pottery from the vicinity of Taraco, about 28 km. by land from Arapa and to the northeast of Juliaca. A fragment of a Classic Tiahuanaco stone head in the Puno Museum ^ would appear to be a unique case of the occurrence of Tiahuanaco stone sculpture at the northern end of the lake.</page><page sequence="11">13 Another reason for the presence of the fragment in Bolivia might be that the Pucar? people from Arapa, or their descendants, moved to the site of Tiahuanaco and carried the Thunderbolt fragment with them for some reason. These individuals would have had to have considerable influence in order for their stela fragment to be used in the Palacio, unless they themselves constructed the Palacio. There is no evidence to support any of these suggestions. Could Pucar? immigrants to Tiahuanaco have been missionaries, or what remained of them? Could Pucar? sculpture have been brought as models for imitation? Are there undiscovered Pucar? or Pucara-like occupations at Tiahuanaco? Pucar? or Pucara-like sculpture at or near Tiahuanaco could be indicative of Pucar? occupations there, although it is not certain that any Pucar? pottery has yet been found at Tiahuanaco itself.46 Could there have been a local Pucara-like occupation having distinct pottery, for example, but producing Pucar? style stone sculpture? The most likely means of moving the piece would appear to be a combination of water transport by balsa rafts and land travel. Departing from Arapa at the northwestern end of Lake Arapa and following this lake to Lagunas Chacamarca and Titihue into the northwestern end of Lake Titicaca, with perhaps a few short overland hauls, the piece could have been brought across Lake Titicaca to the southern shore where it could have been taken to Tiahuanaco via the Rio Tiwanaku. Pucar? Related Sculpture from the Southern Titicaca Basin Keeping the Arapa-Thunderbolt stela in mind, one must review the other sculpture which is Pucar? or Pucara-like in style from Tiahuanaco or other sites at the southern end of the lake. I do not know if the presence of these other Pucar? style monoliths can also be ex plained as representing a pattern of reuse, but it is a possibility to be tested on the grounds presented here for the Arapa-Thunderbolt case. Ex amples of Pucara-like sculpture from Tiahuanaco include the two kneeling statues at the door of the church of Tiahuanaco.47 Ponce says that these belong to Epoch IV or Classic Tiahuanaco,48 but the elements on the head bands (fig. 9)49 make the statues similar, as Uhle also noted, to the Pucar? style statue from Az?ngaro 50 which is now in the Puno Museum and to others having upside-down front-view animal heads on twisted or undu lating headbands. These two statues from the Tiahuanaco church are most similar to two blocky, kneeling or squatting statues from Taraco, one of which has a headband element similar to that described above while the other has one hand over the chest and the other at the knee.51 Four sculptures from Pokotia, just to the south of Tiahuanaco, share Pucar? style elements, and include the two kneeling "women," a seated "man," and the "Flute Player."52 Ponce places the first two of the Pokotia statues in his Epoch IV, but elements such as the headband (similar to those on the statues from the church in Tiahuanaco as shown in fig. 9), breechclout with side flaps, representation of ribs and navel, two 11 snake-braids" curling up to the shoulders,54 and overall realism are very Pucara-like. The third statue 55 also relates to Pucar? style sculpture in being blocky, in the position of the hands, the</page><page sequence="12">14 presence of a cap under the hat, and representation of the navel. This piece is most like one of the headless statues reported by N??ez del Prado from Waraqfoyoq Qfasa, Chumbivilcas, Cuzco, 6 in its similar seated position, position of arms on chest, and relief ring in the navel posi tion. The similarities of the "Flute Player" to other Pucar? style sculpture are even greater than those of the other three Pokotia statues, especially when compared to a statue now in the Pucar? museum (fig. 14).5? The similarities include: the neck fringe, wrist bands, cap under the hat, detailed face motifs on the hat,58 the general facial features, and an object emanating from the mouth. In the Pucar? example this object is an anthropomorphic figure upside down with the head held in the two hands at the chest (perhaps being eaten). The similar object held in the Pokotia statue's hand is not a flute, as the name implies, nor any other musical instrument as suggested by Ponce,59 but is an anthropomorphic figure which has hairlike braids on the sides of its head, and arms bent at the elbows with hands just under the stomach. This observation was confirmed during my visit to Bolivia in 1973. The Bern statuette bought at Tiahuanaco by Tschudi in 1858.60 and the seated and hunchbacked statues from the Island of Titicaca,*^ have some Pucar? elements; but, as Ponce notes, hunchback statues have never been found among sculpture from Pucar?.^2 The iconographie ele ments of the Bern statuette, however, are Pucar? ones. The Pucar? style statuette of uncertain provenience illustrated by Kidder is very much like the Bern statuette, but is not hunchbacked (fig. 6).63 A new statu ette from Taraco recorded by us in 1973 appears to be Pucar? in style and has the suggestion of a hunchback representation. There are other monoliths from Bolivia which resemble Pucar? style stone sculpture but are not sufficiently well documented to be used in this argument and present a subject for a separate article. In some cases, photographs of such possible Pucar? style pieces have been pub lished but do not show sufficient details, such as incised motifs, which characterize the Pucar? style. It is necessary, therefore, to examine the pieces themselves instead of relying on the published versions. Other possible Pucar? style monoliths in Bolivia include a human statue with breechclout and ribs now in the Museo Nacional de Arqueolog?a in La Paz, two pieces with frogs/toads having tails,^ and one interesting stepped slab in the museum at Tiahuanaco.^5 This last, unpublished piece was identified by me during my visit to Tiahuanaco in 1973, and appears to be the first case of the occurrence of a Pucar? style stepped stela in Bolivia; previously only statues and unstepped pieces have been described. This stepped slab is red sandstone and has relief carving on one face, of a zoomorphic figure with an oval, undecorated head, two arms bent upward, and does not show the lower portion of the animal's body. Conclusion The question of why two pieces of stone sculpture, coming from widely separated localities at both ends of Lake Titicaca, are stylistic ally very similar has been resolved by showing that the pieces belong to a single stela. Other problems are raised, however, regarding the</page><page sequence="13">15 direction and time of transport of one or both of the pieces. I have suggested possible answers to these, but more work is needed. But beyond the academic value of this unusual case of stylistic identity, it should also make us realize that present political boundaries (Peru and Bolivia) may create barriers to the pursuit of knowledge of altiplano archaeology. What we need is closer collaboration between "Peruvianists" and "Bolivianists" in coordinating all of the data for the purpose of reconstructing prehistoric altiplano events and societies, reinforcing a contact already made during Pucar? and even pre-Pucara times.

May 31, 1971 revised September 27, 1975</page><page sequence="14">16 NOTES This paper, as part of a larger work which also included Ch?vez and Ch?vez, 1976, was presented in the symposium entitled "Analysis and Interpretation of Form and Style of the Precolumbian Art of the Andean Region," during the 36th Annual Meeting of the Society for American Archaeology held at Norman, Oklahoma, May 6, 1971. 2A.

Larco Hoyle (1963, p. 47, fig. 73) also illustrated the stela, but said it was from "Sarapa," not Arapa; his photo, like Uhlefs, shows it (face B) when it was a lintel in the church, though his photo is upside down with respect to the true orientation of the stela. See also Ponce Sangin?s, 1957, p. 132, fig. 27a (from Kidderfs illustration); Lehmann (1943, pp. 141-142) mentions the Arapa stela along with one from Hatuncolla, then compares the frog motif on the latter to one on a Bolivian piece (possibly the Thunderbolt?) and to one of unknown provenience in Munich. 7 M. Kidder, 1942, p. 187; see, however, Palacios R. (1935, p. 236) in which much the same story is told but with a "coronel Ponce" blamed for the breakage. 8A. Kidder, 1943, pl. VI, 7. g Arapa 3 is the catalog number given to this third monolith from Arapa by S. and K. Ch?vez. Arapa 1 is our catalog number for the Arapa stela, subject of this paper, and more widely known in the literature as the Arapa stela; Arapa 2 is our catalog number for the slab which Kidder described and illustrated (A. Kidder, 1943, pp. 35-36 and pl. VI, 7). 10 Bennett, 1934, p. 463. nUhle, 1912, pp. 477-478. 12 Posnansky, 1945, vol. II, p. 230. 13A. Kidder, 1943, p. 33. 14 Posnansky, 1945, vol.

Courty was a geologist on the French Cr?qui-Montfort and S?n?schal de la Grange expedition and excavated at Tiahuanaco between September 3 and December 15, 1903 (Cr?qui-Montfort, 1906, p. 532). Ponce states that while Posnansky returned to Bolivia from Europe in September of 1903, he likely went to Tiahuanaco for the first time after May, 1904 (Ponce Sangin?s, 1969b, p. 24). By the time Posnansky went to Tiahuanaco the Thunderbolt had already been discovered and taken to the museum of Colonel R?os Ponce where Posnansky first saw and photographed it. While the Thunderbolt may have been found by Courty, the report of the excavations published by Cr?qui-Montfort does not mention it. Posnansky characterizes the work of Courty as destructive and lacking in careful excavation techniques (Posnansky, 1945, vol. I, pp. 64-65). The Thunderbolt may have been overlooked by Courty or found later by local inhabitants. 19 Dr. Adon A. Gordus, personal communication. 20Hoyt, 1976. 21 This stela was first published by Tello (1929, figs. 1-5 and 106). Tellofs drawings are not accurate, though his fig. 105, showing what I designate as face A, is more accurate than his fig. 106, my face B. Photographs of the two faces have been published as follows: Valc?rcel (1935, fig. 10) shows face B; Muelle (1936, p. 5) shows face B; Bennett (1938, p. 178) shows face A; Valc?rcel (1938, fig. 6) shows face B; Schaedel (1948, p. 71) shows face A; Cossio del Pomar (1949, photograph on third page following p. 48) shows face A; Bennett and Bird (1960, fig. 16) show face B; Harth-Terr? (1960, pp. 246, 248) shows faces A and B, but cut; Mason (1968, pl. 18B) shows face A. For other references see Espejo N?f?ez (1971)? 22A. Kidder, 1943, p. 34. 23 We suggest the name Asiruni, or "with snake" in Aymara (from A. Kidder, 1943, p. 10), for a Pucar? substyle having serpents, especially eared, or other reptilian fauna, with or without face or body details, often associated with relief rings, on stelae and slabs (for example, see Ch?vez and Ch?vez, 1970, pp. 25, 28-30, 35-36; Valc?rcel, 1932, fig. 1; Franco Inojosa, 1940, passim; A. Kidder, 1943, pl. IV, 1-6, pl. VII, 1, 8-9; Portugal Zamora, 1961, figs. 2, 3; Franco Inojosa and Gonz?lez, 1936, drawing no. 4). Some elements of the Asiruni substyle are shared with the Yaya-Mama style (Ch?vez and Ch?vez, 1976), but elements of the Asiruni substyle relate more closely and in greater detail to those of the Pucar? style. In addition, the geographic distribution of the Asiruni substyle and of the Pucar? style are closely congruent; both occur around Lake Titicaca and at sites considerably inland from the lake especially to the north as far as the Department of Cuzco, while the Yaya-Mama style is found around the lake, especially in the south. The Asiruni substyle will be defined more completely in a separate article in preparation, which will include ethnohistorical references as</page><page sequence="16">18 well as examples from both Peru and Bolivia. 24 Valc?rcel, 1935, fig. 7; A. Kidder, 1943, pl. VII, 9. 25 A. Kidder, 1965. The caption of the illustration indicates the height of the statuette to be 29% inches, while the text states it to be 8 inches ; the latter was confirmed to be correct. 26 Posnansky, 1945, vol. II, figs. 91-94. 27 Rowe, 1958. 28 Posnansky, 1958, pi. LXXV.A.a. and p. 124. 29Uhle, 1912, p. 478, fig. 15. 30 Ch?vez and Ch?vez, 1976. 31 Hoyt, 1976. Hoyt furnished me with details of the discovery and generously provided me with slides she took of the pieces. 32 Karen Ch?vez and I think the two Yapura fragments probably came from a single stela since the dimensions of both pieces are so much alike (width, thickness, and dimensions of design panels), the stone material is the same, and the execution and designs of both are so closely similar. The curvilinear panels of the smaller fragment could be a continuation of the pattern of alternating curvilinear and rectilinear panels found on the larger piece but with a connecting segment(s) missing. The higher relief portion of the smaller fragment indicates another piece is missing as well; this high relief conceivably is a frog/toad and could be the very top of the stela. 33 Hoyt, 1976, figs. 2-7. 3U Squier, 1877, pp. 385-386; Uhle, 1912, fig. 14; A. Kidder, 1943, pi. VII, 10. 35Uhle, 1912, fig. 14; A. Kidder, 1943, pl. VII, 11. 36Hoyt, 1976, figs. 4, 6. 37 Rowe (personal communication), however, has suggested an alterna tive possibility for the direction and time of transportation, namely that the top portion was brought to Arapa from Tiahuanaco in post conquest times to use as the church lintel. There is a third logical alternative: that the Arapa-Thunderbolt stela was originally erected neither in Arapa nor in Tiahuanaco, but at some other location from which both pieces were later transported. 38 Bennett, 1934, p. 473. The only exception to the southern occur rence of the substyle might be the two lightning stones mentioned previ ously, though they are distinct from stelae in form and size and are</page><page sequence="17">19 easily portable. 39 Cases of indigenous reuse of earlier stone sculpture in the alti plano of Peru and Bolivia have been documented within the last two centuries, as in the case of the Bern statuette known around 1858 as "the god of thieves" by the Indians of Tiahuanaco who showed "to it the same reverence they did to any of the saints of the church" (Rowe, 1958, p. 260). Another case documents the same kind of veneration of an ancient stone statue (known as Awicha Anselma) during the 1967 drought in Pucar?, Peru (Flores Ochoa, 1971). 40 The numbers given to these stelae are designations in the cata loguing system of the Centro de Investigaciones Arqueol?gicas de Tiwanaku. Stela 15 was named the "Barbada" by Wendell C. Bennett and was his stone sculpture No. 24? Stela 10 is Bennett's stone sculpture No. 2. 41 Bennett, 1934, p. 474. 42 Ponce Sangin?s, 1964, p. 68. 43 Ch?vez and Ch?vez, 1976. ^Rowe, 1956, p. 144. 45 A. Kidder, 1943, pl. VII, 5. According to the Puno Museum register it was obtained by the Puno Concejo in 1920 from Mrs. Epifania Zevilla?os de Palao, and was found at her house in the city of Puno while putting in foundations. 46 On p. 56 of his 1944 report, Rowe made a positive identification of a single sherd from Level 9 of Bennett's Pit V at Tiahuanaco as "Pucar? Polychrome." The sherd in question was a small one with a stepped design in red and black, the color being outlined by incision. In a later publication, Rowe discussed this identification and concluded that Bennett's sherd might belong to a local style related to Pucar? rather than to the Pucar? style proper (Rowe, 1963, pp. 7-8). In 1968, Rowe had an opportunity to see the Qalasasaya style pottery from Ponce Sangin?s* excavations at Tiahuanaco on exhibit in the site museum there, and he realized that Bennett's sherd might belong to the Qalasasaya style rather than to the Pucar? one. He subsequently stated to several people that no Pucar? style pottery had been found at Tiahuanaco, a statement he now regrets, since there is a perfectly good possibility that Bennett's sherd is indeed Pucar?, as Rowe thought when he first saw it in 1941.

Kidder, 1965, pp. 22-23; see my fig. 6). 55 Posnansky, 1945, vol. II, fig. 95. 56N??ez del Prado B?jar, 1972, l?m. XVII, fig. 4. 57 According to Mr. Emilio Ramos Carri?n, his son found this piece in 1969 in one of the stone enclosures at Pucar?. 58 Fig. 14, on the upper right of the headband, a face motif occurs (fig. 10) comparable to the one on the headband of the "Flute Player" (fig. 11). This face motif appears on both Pucar? sculpture and pottery, and continues to be present on some Classic Tiahuanaco sculpture, as was noted by Kidder (A. Kidder, 1943, p. 36), such as on the finger joints of Stela 8 or the Ponce Stela (Burland, 1970, p. 111). The motif also occurs on the back of the legs on one of the Wakullani statues (Posnansky, 1945, vol. II, fig. 98, right). 59 Ponce Sangin?s, 1969a, p. 37. He refers to fig. 6 in his discus sion, but should refer to fig. 19. 6?Rowe, 1958, pp. 260-261. 61 Ponce Sangin?s, 1969a, pp. 21-22, 33, pis. 13, 14, 15, 18, 20 and possibly 16, 17. 62 Ponce Sangin?s, 1969a, p. 20. 63A.

There appears to be a greater concentration of this substyle in the northern Lake Titicaca Basin, however.</page><page sequence="19">21 BIBLIOGRAPHY Bennett, Wendell Clark 1934 Excavations at Tiahuanaco.
