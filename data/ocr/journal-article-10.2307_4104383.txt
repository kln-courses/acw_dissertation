<plain_text><page sequence="1">Of Mothers and Sorcerers: A Luluwa Maternity Figure CONSTANTINE PETRIDIS Jane and Morgan Whitney Fellow The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York ome of the finest figurative sculptures by the Luluwa, a Bantu-speaking people of south central Congo (formerly Zaire), are delicately carved figures decorated with highly elaborated scarifications. The maternity figure in The Art Institute of Chicago (cat. no. 36) is one of the most refined of these Luluwa sculp- tures. Formally, this figure represents a natural- istic style that is characteristic of a specific his- torical setting and a well-defined sociopolitical reality. Contextually, it refers to the complex magico-religious world of the Luluwa, for this representation of a mother with her child is part of a particular cult, called bwanga bwa cibola, concerned with issues of human fertil- ity. The iconography and style of the Art Insti- tute's sculpture reflect its role as a symbol of political power and status among the Luluwa. The name Luluwa was introduced by the Chokwe, another Bantu-speaking people, and is generally used today to refer to the people that the German explorer Hermann von Wissmann called, by turns, Baluba and Bashilange.1 "Beena Luluwa" (singular, "Mwena Luluwa") means "people by the Luluwa River," a tributary stream of the Kasai in south central Congo. Although the single label suggests a homoge- neous ethnic entity, the Luluwa in fact comprise various subgroups. The patrilineal Luluwa, along with the Luntu, the Konji (or Nkoshi), and the Luba- Lubilanji, have been classified as belonging to the Luba-Kasai cluster. All four of these peo- ples speak the Bantu language Chiluba, with minor regional variations; the Bantu lan- guages, which are spoken by more than sixty million people in central and southern Africa, share common linguistic roots. The Luluwa, Luntu, Konji, and Luba-Lubilanji all trace their origin to a mythical place toward the east, called Nsanga a Lubangu, which is situated in the present-day Shaba province. Various aspects of their religious beliefs, political views, and social life are also strikingly similar. How- ever, it is the Luluwa who are particularly known in the West for their anthropomorphic wood sculpture. Scholars have assumed that successive waves of Luba emigrants from Shaba settled during the seventeenth and eighteenth cen- turies in a region that is now part of the Congo province of Western Kasai. Today, most Luluwa live in and around the town of Kananga and in the zones of Kazumba, Dibaya, and Ndemba (see fig. i). There is evidence that suggests a historical relationship between the Luba peo- ples of Kasai and those of Shaba. The immi- grants in Kasai are believed to have become mixed with a local substratum of peoples known as Kete and Bindji, and with pygmies. The Luluwa maternity figure mediates between the ancestral spirits and man; it is a power object that protects against misfortune and adversity.

CX\ Today the Luluwa are predominantly farmers, but in past times Luluwa men were also renowned as excellent hunters. Commer- cial exchanges between the Luluwa and their neighbors had traditionally resulted in cul- tural exchanges as well. It was the Luluwa's involvement in Portuguese-African trade, how- ever, that was to have profound influence on their culture. The influence of the Chokwe traders who arrived in Luluwa territory from Angola at the end of the nineteenth century was of key importance, and had a crucial effect on the artistic production of the Luluwa. According to Luluwa beliefs, the supreme being, Mfidi Mukulu, is the foremost among the spirits and is mentioned first in all prayers to the ancestors. Still, the impact of Mfidi Mukulu on people's daily life is minimal. It is the ancestral spirits who exercise a direct and ongoing influence upon human existence. Mere mortals can only enter into contact with the supernatural world of the spirits through the intercession of the recently deceased. Occa- sionally, in speaking of the ancestral spirits, a distinction is made between the good bashangi (singular, mushangi), and the evil bakishi (singular, mukishi). In fact, both terms are synonyms, the latter being used somewhat more frequently, for the spirits may exercise their influence both negatively and positively. In order to be assured of their sympathy, the worshiper has to invoke them regularly and give them offerings. In the past, a small conic mud mound or a miniature house or shelter in the family's yard served as the abode or meet- ing place of the ancestral spirits.2 The Luluwa and other peoples of the Kasai also dedicate certain shrubs or trees to the ancestral spirits in order to gain their protection or to assuage their disfavor (see figs. 2-3). The shrubs and trees are planted close to the houses, and out- siders tend not even to notice them. The white- barked mwabi (Sterculia quinqueloba) is probably the best-known of these "spirit trees." In the past, the common ancestral altar usu- ally consisted of a combination of a two-faced pole sculpture and a grove of small shrubs and trees.3 Among the individuals endowed with supernatural powers, the ritual healer, known as mupaki or mpaka manga, has the most important role to play in keeping misfortune at bay. The term bwanga (plural, manga) 184 Museum Studies</page><page sequence="4">OF MOTHERS AND SORCERERS PETRIDIS covers a wide range of meanings, but is usu- ally translated as "fetish," "charm," or "medi- cine."4 In essence, the term is used for the cult associated with the "supernatural object," and at the same time it is a generic name for the containers in which different powerful sub- stances or ingredients are kept. Although the manga serve predominantly positive and con- structive ends, the term always connotes both positive and negative, defensive and offensive, and constructive and destructive meanings. The shapes of the containers and the materials they are made of vary greatly. They tend to be natural, unworked objects such as snails' shells, gourds, or antelope and goat horns, but in the West the best known are the wooden anthropomorphic figures generically referred to as lupingu (plural, mpingu); thus, the Art Institute's maternity figure (cat. no. 36) is both a bwanga and a lupingu. Sometimes power substances are kept in one or more cavities in the lupingu's body; more often small cloth bags, horns, or snails' shells containing such bishimba are tied to the figure. In the end, the power of the manga stems from these ingredients or substances of min- eral, plant, animal, or human origin (bishimba; singular, cishimba). Bishimba comprise a diversity of objects and materials: horns, teeth, or claws of powerful and fearsome animals; fragments of meteorites or other rocks; leaves and bark of certain species of trees. All of these objects and materials draw their power from their function as symbols of the ances- tral spirits. Moreover, they are not chosen for their physical traits, but rather for their asso- ciative value.' As mentioned earlier, the refined mother- and-child figure in the Art Institute is con- nected to the widespread fertility cult bwanga bwa cibola, which is found among the Luluwa as well as among the neighboring Luntu, the Konji, the Luba-Lubilanji, and even the FIGURE 2 The Beena Konji or Nkoshi-sometimes confused with the Bakwa Luntu-share many of the traditions and customs of the Luluwa and other Luba-Kasai peoples. In most of their villages, adjacent to their houses, one can see trees or shrubs in which the ancestral spirits are believed to dwell. In this photograph, a spirit tree (mwabi) has been planted in the Konji village of Kasongo Mbanza (Tshefu) in honor of the birth of a child with "red" or pale skin. The mwabi tree is intended both to enhance the beauty of the newborn child and to preserve its spotless skin. Photo: Constantine Petridis, June 1996. Museum Studies 185</page><page sequence="5">OF MOTHERS AND SORCERERS PETRIDIS FIGURE 3 The ancestral altar (cyabu) existed not only among the Luluwa and the Luba-Lubilanji but also among the northern Kete, as seen in this photograph by Frederick Starr, a professor of anthro- pology at the Univer- sity of Chicago from 1892 to 1923. He took the photograph in 19o6 in a Kete village of the Bieeng chiefdom of chief Ndombe. Usually the altar con- sisted of a grove of trees or shrubs planted at the same time and bound together. The altar served first and foremost to protect against jealous and malicious ancestral spirits and to boost fertility. It was seen as a token of the benevolence of the ancestors if the poles took root and grew into trees. Photo: Frederick Starr, Congo Natives: An Ethnographic Album (Chicago, 1912), pl. iia. Songye.6 Several regional and local differences exist with regard to the details of the cult (sometimes, for example, it is known under a different name). The name of the cult com- bines the Luluwa words bwanga (see above) and cibola, which is generally understood as referring to "pain," "sorrow," or "misfortune."' Ambivalence, ambiguity, and reversibility are the most typical qualities of a bwanga. Thus the bwanga bwa cibola is characterized as a double-edged sword. Apart from mother-and-child figures, images of pregnant women are normally also associated with the cibola cult (see fig. 4). Yet true-to-life and elaborately detailed sculptures such as the one in the Art Institute are rare. Male figures are also linked to this cult, but since most cibola figures-much like other manga-tend to be roughly hewn, it is usually impossible to see whether a carving depicts a man or a woman (see fig. 5).8 This allows for distinguishing between two Luluwa styles: one "naturalistic" and the other "schematic." Although the naturalistic style developed later than the schematic, subsequently the cibola cult made use of figures in both of these styles simultaneously in the same village. A number of different substyles may be distinguished within the naturalistic Luluwa style. The sculpture in the Art Insti- tute is closely related to a limited number of very similar works that the researcher Paul Timmermans, partly on the basis of Dr. J.-A. Tiarko Fourche's data, attributed to the Bakwa Mushilu and to the Beena Chikulu, two north- ern Luluwa subgroups in the Ndemba zone.9 It bears a striking resemblance to two mater- nity figures in the Royal Museum for Central Africa in Tervuren, Belgium. All three may very well have been made in the same work- shop or even by the same artist." The ultimate goal in the life of the Luluwa is procreation. This explains why many manga are aimed at boosting fertility and at protecting pregnant women, new- borns, and small children." While transgress- ing certain norms and rules of behavior may have pernicious consequences in the view of the Luluwa, illness and disease are sometimes seen as stemming from the influence of a fickle ancestral spirit or from a malevolent manga maker. More often, however, the Luluwa attribute bad fortune to sorcery. The spirits of the ancestors will always be invoked to end injustice; if a woman has had several miscarriages in a row or if her newborn chil- dren always die shortly after birth, the spirits must be consulted. A woman who has suffered such calami- ties will visit a diviner (mwena lubuku or mubuki), possibly accompanied by her hus- band. Some individuals are reincarnated as diviners, but most acquire the skills to see the hidden causes of misfortune and adversity through initiation by an established specialist. 186 Museum Studies</page><page sequence="6">OF MOTHERS AND SORCERERS PETRIDIS 36.

In both its style and iconography, this rare mother-and- child figure can be con- sidered as a visual synthesis of Luluwa concepts of fertility, motherhood, sorcery, status, and power. It was in the collection of A. E C. A. van Heyst in Rotterdam as early as 1937. Museum Studies 187</page><page sequence="7">OF MOTHERS AND SORCERERS PETRIDIS I was told in several villages that the most pop- ular Luluwa divining technique makes use of a calabash or a basket filled with small objects, as is the case among many neighboring peoples in southern Congo, northeastern Angola, and western Zambia.12 The woman will sometimes go and see the ritual healer (mupaki; plural, mipaki) directly. Her admittance into the bwanga bwa cibola is very often prepared by female mipaki. When a woman consults a mupaki, she will first of all be told that she must observe a number of rules and prohibitions. She may even be obliged to live apart at the edge of the village, in a small house surrounded by a fence. During her seclusion, the mupaki initi- ates the woman into the rules and secrets of the cult. In other cases, the initiation simply takes place in the woman's home, but it is always performed in utmost secrecy. The ini- tiation itself can vary substantially, and the mupaki who officiates as initiator is free to give it a personal touch. The singing of ritual songs of the cult is usually part of this process. The mupaki will ask the woman to confess all the sins or crimes she has committed, after FIGURE 4 Congo (formerly Zaire); Luluwa. Standing Female Figure, late nineteenth/early twentieth century. Wood; h. 47.5 cm (i83/4 in.). The Nelson- Atkins Museum of Art, Kansas City, Missouri (Purchase). This representation of a pregnant woman belongs to the cibola cult. Together with a number of quite simi- lar figures in the Royal Museum for Central Africa in Tervuren, Belgium, which were collected in the field by Dr. Tiarko Fourche between 1933 and 1936, this sculpture belongs to a distinct style of the Bakwa Ndolo subgroup (Dibaya zone). It is possible that they were all made by the same artist. which a number of chickens are sacrificed. The mupaki then performs a purification rite by rubbing the woman with a mixture of luke- warm water and plant extracts." After a shared meal including meat from sacrificed chickens, the mupaki leads both spouses to a brook or a river. A dam is built and the couple's clothes are buried in the river bed. The prohibitions do not enter into force until the eighth month of pregnancy, when the birth of the child is near. This period is usu- ally called cizaba and is considered to be "the month of the manga." The mupaki gives the woman a receptacle, also called cizaba, typically made out of clay and containing various ingre- dients, including water. It serves as a protective device and is placed at the entrance of the home or, later, under the bed of the newborn child. From this time on, the woman must wash or rub herself daily with the cizaba mix- ture, or sprinkle it over her body. She also has to drink it regularly. In doing so, the woman will stimulate the growth of the unborn child, keep it from harm, and assure a safe delivery.14 It is in this month that the manga, which the future mother received earlier from the mupaki, begin to move beyond their protective function and start to work actively and constructively. Many of the restrictions imposed on the woman concern both her diet and her behav- ior; most of these restrictions are normally also observed by the maker of the manga. At the beginning of the pregnancy, the unborn child must be "fed" through intensive sexual activity, but soon the mother-to-be must refrain from such behavior. She is not allowed to eat certain kinds of game, for fear that she will transfer their characteristics to her child. In some cases, the mother's diet consists exclusively of manioc porridge (bidya). She may drink still water from a puddle or a pond, but no rainwater or river water may be consumed. When the pregnancy starts to show, 188 Museum Studies</page><page sequence="8">OF MOTHERS AND SORCERERS PETRIDIS FIGURE 5 It has become extremely rare to see material traces of the cibola cult in situ. In this photograph a Konji woman shows two cibola accessories that she secretly keeps as a reminder of the birth of a cibola child. The schematic wooden half-figure, which has a small cavity in the top of the head for the bishimba, was made by the female ritual healer who initiated the woman in the cibola cult. The woman wore these accessories hanging from a strap on her back, exactly as the snail's shell is worn on the back of the Art Institute's mater- nity figure (see cat. no. 36). By wearing these accessories, the woman made it known to the villagers that she was subject to the cibola cult, and was able to keep away negative powers and evil spirits.

BELOW FIGURE 6 In the past, according to the art historian Albert Maesen, Luluwa women who had given birth to unusual children performed ceremonial dances on market days, Sundays, and other holidays. On these occasions, the mothers of a boy born after three girls or of a girl born after three boys wore a belt or a bandolier of plaited raffia fibers with a number of full and half gourds tied to it at the waist. The full fruits were used as rattles, the halves were used to store the money that was collected during the dance.

Museum Studies 189</page><page sequence="9">OF MOTHERS AND SORCERERS PETRIDIS usually around the second or third month, the mupaki gives the woman a charm belt (mubangu) to wear.'5 The mubangu is made of leather or fiber and is decorated with beads, buttons, shells, and bits of ivory. The belt contains several ingredients that are some- times put into small gourds that hang from it. A small gourd or horn is also mounted into the roof of the woman's house for protection. The woman may use other protective charms -sometimes in place of the belt-such as horns, snails' shells, gourds, bells or whistles, which she wears on her chest or on her back. The ingredients may also be put into a small basket or bag worn on a strap from the shoul- der. A woman subjected to the rules and pro- hibitions of the bwanga bwa cibola some- times has to shave her head, either completely or only the right or left side. The shaven part refers to her previously aborted pregnancy or the newborn child she has lost. The woman's clothing consists of nothing more than a small loincloth which is made of red-dyed fiber or of banana leaves; her body is completely cov- ered with a mixture of palm oil and red clay. Yet the cibola cult is not only meant to foster pregnancy and to protect unborn life. Ultimately, it must bring about the reincarna- tion of a deceased ancestor into a newborn child. Dead children are often buried close to or right next to their mother's house, because children's spirits are believed to reincarnate faster than those of adults. Women who have lost a child can thus continue to take care of the spirits of their dead children and urge them to return to earth soon. After the birth of a long-awaited child, the diviner will be called in to determine the identity of the new- born, on the basis of congenital signs or han- dicaps.'6 If no signs are to be found, the way the child walks or speaks as it grows up will determine which ancestor it incarnates. After the birth, mother and child-and possibly the father-must live in a secluded, fenced-in house. Sometimes it is the same house where the initiation by the mupaki took place. As with the mother, the newborn is subject to strict rules and must regularly be rubbed with a mixture of red clay and palm oil. After each new moon, at dawn, the mother has to sing a ritual song to honor her child and must sacrifice a chicken for her bwanga. The rules often allow none but cibola initiates to see the child until it is three months old. Dyala, the first solemn 190 Museum Studies</page><page sequence="10">OF MOTHERS AND SORCERERS PETRIDIS coming-out of the child before the commu- nity, also takes place at new moon. All village children present at the ritual must break into loud shrieking in order to chase away evildoers. The families of both spouses are invited to a communal meal with the mupaki. After the meal, a banana tree (for a girl) or a plantain (for a boy) is planted behind the house. The rem- nants of the umbilical cord are buried at the foot of the tree, and feces of the child and ashes from the hearth are strewn around it. For chil- dren whom the Luluwa view as exceptionally beautiful, the above-mentioned mwabi tree is planted. Mother and child generally must continue to live apart from the village until the child starts to walk. The mupaki then shaves the heads of both mother and child, neither of whose hair had been cut since the child was born. In the past, the ban on the mother's sex- ual activity lasted until the child was three years old, but in more recent times it was lifted after the shaving. The couple reward the maker of the manga with money or goods to thank him for his intervention. The ritual cycle ends with a final communal meal. The parents usu- ally remain bound to the cult until the birth of their fifth child and may perform initiations themselves thereafter. The first child born after the initiation is always named Chibola, after the cult, no matter whether it is a boy or a girl, and the next child is always called Kapinga. A public ceremony invariably accompanies the birth of such "special children" (see fig. 6)."7 Some sources report that the woman receives the mpingu at the beginning of the initiation, immediately after she calls in the mupaki. According to others, they appear only after the eighth month of pregnancy, when the prescriptions and the prohibitions begin to apply. Usually the woman receives the bwanga and its accessories-possibly by order of the diviner-when she goes into seclusion. Blood of sacrificial chickens is then poured over the bwanga and the figure is "fed" a piece of chicken liver or some manioc por- ridge. Several testimonies indicate that in past times women usually had at least two figures. One was kept at home; the other was carried hanging from the belt or around the neck. The figures were often identical, but the ones hanging from the neck or from the belt tended to be smaller and less elaborate. Members of the cult interviewed by the art historian Albert Maesen, who did field research among the Luluwa in 1954, stated that a woman might receive more than two figures-the number being determined by how many of her chil- dren had died.i" As with other cults, sculpted anthropomorphic images far from prevail in the bwanga bwa cibola. Horns, snails' shells, gourds, leather or cloth bags, pouches or bun- dles containing ingredients are used more often. It is almost certain that originally such natural manga nearly always accompanied carved figures. Interestingly, the Art Institute's mother- and-child figure bears similarities to half- figures that end on a point (see fig. 7). That a full figure also features a short wooden point under the feet might indicate how it was actu- ally used. Not all sources are very explicit, but several mention that cibola figures are kept in the home, in a clay pot or in a basket." This vessel, in which the pointed end of the figure is stuck, is filled with dirt and several bishimba, and is not to be confused with the cizaba receptacle mentioned above. Usually, the head of the figure looks over the edge of the vessel toward the door, in order to make sure that negative forces or evildoers do not enter the house. It is likely that the owners of refined, true-to-life, large figures like the Art Institute's also possessed more rudimentary miniature pieces that they actually wore.20 Like all manga, FIGURE 7 Congo (formerly Zaire); Luluwa. Female Figure with Child, nineteenth century. Wood and metal; h. 35.6 cm (14 in.). Brooklyn Museum of Art, Museum Collection Fund 5o. I24. This half-figure, which is said to have been field-collected in 1894, is in the same style as the Art Insti- tute's maternity figure (cat. no. 36). It is dis- tinctive for its refined depiction of elaborate scarifications (nsalu), its very long neck, and the angular posture of the child in the arms of its mother. The brass-headed nail on the forehead is very similar to nails in cer- tain figures of the Luba-Shaba, but is rare among the Luluwa. As is the case with the Luba sculptures, the nail may be a reference to the idea that the ancestral spirit is locked into the carving. Museum Studies 191</page><page sequence="11">OF MOTHERS AND SORCERERS PETRIDIS the larger carvings normally stood in the home and were put outside at new moon, in order for them to be "impregnated" by the lunar light.21 The figures were honored by song and were regularly daubed with a mixture of red clay, palm oil, camwood, and porcelain clay. Although Albert Maesen claimed that figures holding a cup in the hand-which are known as lupingu iwa bwimpe-were cleaned after each ritual use, several examples in Western collections show that this was not the case.22 Many figures do look remarkably clean and polished; but it cannot be determined whether they were cleaned by their Luluwa users or by their later Western owners. It appears that refined figures like the Art Institute's belonged exclusively to a restricted class of women in positions of authority, and this might in turn explain why they are so rare. The Luluwa were originally made up of a num- ber of small, egalitarian groups of hunters and farmers. The confrontation with Chokwe tradesmen from Angola in the last quarter of the nineteenth century and the influence of the slave trade gradually created social oppo- sition between the nobility, with its lords or chiefs (bakalenga or bamfumu), and the com- moners (babiloolo), with their vassals or con- stituents.23 Some ambitious chiefs, with their newly acquired wealth and firearms, tried to emulate the Chokwe example of a more cen- tralized state by subjugating neighboring chiefs. They did not achieve this goal, and to this day no single Luluwa chief takes precedence over his political rivals. By the end of the nine- teenth century, however, it seems that class distinction had become a fact, at least in some parts of Luluwa territory. Naturalistic cibola figures, as much symbols of status as ritual objects, are likely a result of this development. Women are seen by the Luluwa as pos- sessing supernatural powers, and they there- fore act as important mediators between the natural world of humans and the supernatural world of the spirits. Many diviners and ritual healers are indeed women. These beliefs in turn explain why female beauty was often viewed as essential to the ability of such female figures to attract the ancestral spirits. The late nineteenth-century stratification of society strengthened the political power of part of the female population. The first wife of a polygy- nous household continued to rule over domes- tic matters, but new chiefs turned more and more to their sisters and/or mothers for help and advice in their quest for authority. It is possible that the elaborated and refined fig- ures, which belonged to wealthy and impor- tant female individuals, were meant for use by the community as a whole, while the sche- matic pieces, owned by women of any status, belonged strictly to the private sphere.24 While figures in the naturalistic style such as the Art Institute's are rare, even the oldest collections hold large numbers of schematic carvings. This strengthens the hypothesis that the naturalistic style evolved within the specific sociopolitical and economic context of the final quarter of the nineteenth century, and is therefore more recent than the schematic style. The development of the later style may have been accompanied by a shift in the way the fig- ures were perceived. Originally, they had been considered as mere power objects and seen as subordinate containers for the bishimba sub- stances, but they gradually acquired a certain autonomy from the bishimba and evolved into symbols of status and prestige.25 It appears self-evident that the schematic sculptures were made by nonspecialists such as the mupaki or by the clients themselves; figures in the natu- ralistic style, on the other hand, must have emerged from the workshops of established master sculptors."6 Mother-and-child figures and represen- tations of pregnant women glorify fertility and 192 Museum Studies</page><page sequence="12">OF MOTHERS AND SORCERERS PETRIDIS refer to the state of motherhood. As mentioned earlier, the realistic rendering of a woman who embodies the accepted notions of beauty in her culture is meant as an invitation for the ancestral spirits to inhabit the sculpture and thus let the ancestors exercise a positive influ- ence on pregnancy, birth, and the health of the newborn.27 Many maternity figures show a striking contrast between the realistic, often smooth depiction of the mother and the sche- matic, jagged representation of the child. It has been suggested that the child represented is stillborn. This would explain why some villagers read sadness and bitterness in the mother's features. However, in some examples, a living, suckling child is seen. Maesen rightly pointed out that the bwanga bwa cibola is not an ancestral cult and that the figures are not ancestral images in the strict sense.28 Nonethe- less, the importance of the bakishi ancestral spirits in the cult cannot be denied. The figures' long necks and especially their muscular limbs express positive aes- thetic values. So do their large heads and high foreheads, which also symbolize human intel- ligence and will power. The figures' strong calves indicate a capacity for hard work, which is a quality men look for when choosing a part- ner. Finally, the hairstyle, jewelry, and scarifi- cations make clear that these figures represent women of high rank. Elaborate hairstyles are one of the distinguishing features of natural- istic cibola figures. However, the coiffures depicted are old-fashioned; it is unlikely that the women initiated in the bwanga bwa cibola wore their hair this way. According to the researcher Henri Morlighem, the type of coiffure on the Art Institute's figure, with its three lobes at the back of the head, is actually a wig, which was made of vegetal fibers rubbed in with palm oil and red camwood powder.29 The pointed shape at the top of the head is also part of an old hairstyle. The two rows of carved cowrie shells at the back of the head imitate the adornments that were woven into the hair. The concentric lines on the figure's long neck are either scarifications or neck- laces, or perhaps even both. Women of high rank used to wear these kinds of necklaces, made from blue and white beads. The detailed depiction of a snails' shell hanging on the back of the figure is a direct reference to the cibola cult. The sculpted imitation of the loincloth and the mubangu belt, with small gourds hanging from it, as discussed above, also relate directly to the cult. One of the most characteristic anatomical details of the Art Institute's figure is undoubt- edly its protruding navel, which depicts the once highly coveted umbilical hernia. The navel symbolizes the close relationship between the ancestors and their progeny, and alludes to the succession of the generations. The Luluwa and other Luba-Kasai peoples attribute spe- cial powers to the navel and to the front and back fontanelles (soft membranes covering an infant's skull). The figure in the Art Institute has a small cavity that is filled with substances at the top of the head, right behind the pointed hairstyle. The perforation through the back of the head is probably meant for bishimba sub- stances as well. According to the esoteric beliefs of the Luluwa and their neighbors, the fon- tanelles stand for clairvoyance and "double sight," meaning the ability to "see" both the future and the past and the invisible, supernat- ural world as well as the visible, natural world.? The figure mediates between the ances- tral spirits and man; it is a power object that protects against misfortune and adversity. As such, its most important function is to seek out and disarm sorcerers (mwena mupongo or muloshi). The cult as a whole serves the same purpose. The powers of sorcery wielded by chiefs are mainly defensive and protective, but sorcerers are known for having mostly Museum Studies 193</page><page sequence="13">OF MOTHERS AND SORCERERS PETRIDIS evil intentions. All those whose behavior is abnormal or who stand out in the crowd run the risk of being suspected of sorcery. People with physical disabilities may also inspire spontaneous fear as potential sorcerers. Elderly people in general, and elderly women in par- ticular, are taken to be expert in sorcery. Peo- ple may come to be initiated into sorcery as a matter of voluntary choice, but more often they are lured into it by circumstances beyond their control. The sorcerer is driven by intense envy, revenge, or rage. He or she uses his or her powers of metamorphosis and ubiquity to achieve the final goal: destroying the life- force of the victim.31 The scarifications (nsalu) on the face and the body of cibola figures have several layers of meaning. First, they do have aesthetic connota- tions. The Luluwa associate body adornments with the notions of bwimpe and bulenga, which imply physical and moral beauty and combine the Western concepts of "beautiful" and "good." At the same time, they specifi- cally refer to human or cultural beauty-that is, beauty made by people themselves. In times past, the Luluwa only truly appreciated the body-and especially the female body-if it had been perfected and humanized by the application of such curvilinear and geometric decorative patterns. Maesen wrote that the union of ethical and aesthetic qualities, as expressed in the terms bwimpe and bulenga and as represented in the nsalu, is considered to be the best protection against sorcery.32 The Luluwa devote much time and attention to skin care and to skin beautification, particularly of the face. This is evident not only in more per- manent transformations such as scarifica- tions, but also in temporary beauty treatments such as massages and anointments with palm oil and other natural substances, which are considered an essential part of skin care. The Luluwa believe that children with a spotless and healthy complexion run the least risk of falling victim to sorcery. Children with skin disorders are often suspected of being sor- cerers themselves. The precise location and form of the nsalu on the face or on the body are not the result of haphazard choice. The temples, through which intelligence and common sense are said to enter the head, are emphasized by par- allel undulating grooves or by straight lines in relief. According to Tiarko Fourche and Henri Morlighem, public servants who worked for the Belgian colonial administration, the con- centric circles and spirals that are sometimes drawn around a protruding navel symbolize certain celestial bodies, as well as positive ideas such as life, hope, birth, and growth, and as such are clearly reminiscent of cone shells. A double or triple undulating line, as seen on the forehead of the Art Institute's figure, sug- gests life in the body-that is, the beating heart or the child developing in the womb." Recent testimonies suggest that the scari- fying of human faces and bodies to the extent seen on naturalistic Luluwa figures was never carried out in reality. Nowadays, however, one does occasionally see an elderly woman whose face, chest, or belly shows traces of black scarifications. These are usually small and purely geometric motifs, with two or three vertical lines under the eyes and a kind of mirroring zig-zag drawing at both sides of the navel. Fashion trends, geographic diver- sity, and foreign influences must also be taken into account. Hermann von Wissmann wrote that at the time he visited the region, in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, only a few elderly people still wore elaborate nsalu, while the younger generation preferred simpler motifs (see fig. 8)?" It is possible, therefore, that raised scarifications of the kind seen on figures and fine incisions coexisted in several parts of Luluwa territory. 194 Museum Studies</page><page sequence="14">OF MOTHERS AND SORCERERS PETRIDIS The production of refined figures in the naturalistic style, such as the Art Institute's sculpture, did not last long, having declined when colonial authorities curbed the power of the recently established elite in the early twen- tieth century. In contrast, the schematic figures and the bwanga bwa cibola, as well as some other cults, have survived up to the present in some areas despite the fact that missionaries and colonial authorities took a decidedly nega- tive view of manga and other traditional reli- gious practices. Yet the most important reason for the relative rarity of manga figures in West- ern collections is probably that they were not preserved by the users themselves. Due to their broader applications, naturalistic figures and the accompanying cult accessories belonging to the elite may have been passed on to follow- ing generations, thus remaining in use over several decades. However, the practitioners of the cibola and other manga were usually obliged by the mupaki to destroy all their paraphernalia once their membership in the cult ceased. Some sources say that the figures and the other manga were placed on graves or buried along with their owners. In more recent times, the storage of bishimba in natural containers has again become popular, and it would appear that these containers are now used more widely than anthropomorphic wooden figures. Today even imported goods such as light bulbs, miner's helmets, or cigar boxes loaded with power substances have been recruited to func- tion as manga. FIGURE 8 Nowadays, some elderly Luluwa women have modest blackened scarifications on their faces and abdo- mens. Artful and elaborate patterns as seen on the figures in "classical" Luluwa style appear to have fallen into disuse more than a century ago. This drawing depicts a man with the older style of scarifi- cations who belonged to the Bakwa Mwanza subgroup (of the central Luluwa) in the I880s.

The estimated number of altars in the palace in 1897 varies, as recorded by members of the British forces who took part in the conquest. Compare, for example, Charles H. Read and 0. M. Dalton, Antiquities from the City of Benin (London, 1899), p. 8; and Roth (note 2), p. 184, fig. 18o. 4. In my continuing study of Benin ivories, I have received valuable assistance from many sources. In I98o a Dickson History of Art Travel Grant from the University of California, Los Angeles, funded the initial examination, measure- ment, and photography of altar tusks in American and European collections. A Fulbright Dissertation Research Grant financed my fieldwork in Benin City during i98i and 1982. I am grateful to Ekpo Eyo for the sponsorship of the Department of Antiquities in Nigeria, and to the University of Benin for the use of facilities. I also owe a large debt of gratitude to Chief David Omoregie, who is now the Ineh, or leader, of Igbesanmwan, and other knowledgeable spe- cialists who assisted me in Benin City. The several travel grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities I received between 1987 and 1992 have supported archival study, further collection research, and the ongoing analysis of these materials. In 1993 and 1994, I was greatly aided by a research grant from the Joint Committee on African Studies of the Social Research Council and the American Council of Learned Societies, and also by an NEH Interpretive Research Grant for additional study and fieldwork in Nigeria, in collaboration with Kathy Curnow of Cleveland State University. I have also profited from the kindness, knowledge, and insights of many individuals, too numerous to mention here. I particularly wish to thank His Highness Oba Erediauwa, Oba of Benin, for his interest, encouragement, and generosity. 5.

(Leipzig, 189i), Hermann von Wissmann usually called the Luluwa "Baluba." For general ethnographic information, see Leo Frobenius, "Bena Lulua," in Hildegard Klein, ed., Leo Frobenius: Ethnographische Notizen aus den Jahren 19o5 und 19o6 (Stuttgart, 1988), pp. 3-29; Prosper Denolf, Aan de rand van de Dibese (Brussels, 1954); David A.

In Unter deutscher Flagge quer durch Afrika von West nach Ost von 1880 his 1883 (Berlin, 1889), Hermann von Wissmann described how he saw chief Chinkenke and his first wife and children invoke the ancestors while standing before a small earthen mound behind his house (p. io6). The ancestors were rep- resented as little zoomorphic mud figures; they received millet beer and pieces of meat as sacrificial offerings. Similar mud constructions, often representing quadrupeds, are found among the Chokwe and the Luba-Shaba. See, for exam- ple, Hermann Baumann, Lunda: Bet Bauern und Jagern in Inner-Angola (Berlin, 1935), figs. 33-34; and William EEP Burton, Luba Religion and Magic in Custom and Belief(Tervuren, 1961), fig. 13. 3.

Rafael van Caeneghem stated over half a century ago that the term bzz?anga cannot be translated adequately. He rightly proposed that scholars and others should not translate such terms; see van Caeneghem, "De psychologie der Baluba in hun spreekwoorden over de ziekten," Congo 21, 3 (Mar. 1940),p. 287 n. i. In Les communications des indlgenes du Kasai avec les ames des morts (Brussels, 1939), J.-A. Tiarko Fourche and Henri Morlighem point to the unmis- takable analogy between bwanga and lupingu among the Luluwa and nkishi among the peoples of the Sankuru River (pp. 57-62). For a discussion of the nkisi as a "fetish" among the Congo peoples, see Wyatt MacGaffey, "African Objects and the Idea of Fetish," Res 25 (Spring 1994), pp. I23-3I. 5. As Luc de Heusch has shown, the power of the bishimba can best be under- stood on the basis of the concepts of "metaphor" and "metonvm"; see de Heusch, "Pour une Approche structuraliste de la pensee magico-religieuse bantoue," in Jean Pouillon and Pierre Maranda, eds., Echanges et communica- tions: Melanges offerts a Claude Levi-Strauss (The Hague and Paris, 1970), vol. 2, pp. 810-13.

Among the Luba-Lubilanji, the term bwanga bwa mbombo is more current. See Alidoor Samain, "Zeden en gebruiken der Baluba's," Congo 2, i (Jan. 1921), pp. 23-24; Fourche and Morlighem (note 4), PP. 53-55; and Rafael Van Caeneghem, "Godsgebeden bij de Baluba," Aequatoria 7, I (1944), p. 29. 7. The cibola cult is part of the wide range of fertility and healing cults shared by various Bantu peoples in central and southern Africa. See esp. John M. Janzen, Ngoma: Discourses of Healing in Central and Southern Africa (Berkeley, Calif., I992); and RenC Devisch, Weaving the Threads of Life: The Khita Gyn-Eco-Logical Healing Cult Among the Yaka (Chicago and London, 1993). The hea~nga bwa cibola of the Luluwa is apparently closely related to the jebola (or zebola) cult of the Mongo. For instance, Tshisanda Ntabala- Mweny (note 3) mentioned possession by the cibolaz spirit as a possible way- of becoming a cult member (pp. 64-6y). For a discussion of the Mongo cult, see Edmond Boelaert, "Yebola," Kongo-Overzee I, I (Oct. '934), pp. 16-19; and Piet Korse, Mondjulu Lokonga, and Bongondo Bonje wa Mpay, Jebola: Textes, rites et signification (Bamanya and Mbandaka, 199go). 8. The Royal Museum for Central Africa in Tervuren holds a schematically carved, small half-figure that was collected among the Luluwa by Henri Morlighem in 1934 (RG. 38816; h. 16 cm [6Y4 in.]). Identified as a cibola figure by the collector, it was probably meant for a woman initiated in the cult to wear at the belt. 9. Paul Timmermans, "Essai de typologie de la sculpture des Bena Luluwa du Kasai," Africa-Tervuren 12, i (1966), pp. 21, 24. Io. Thanks to the wood analyses conducted by Roger Dechamps, we know that the figures in the Royal Museum for Central Africa in Tervuren were made of mutocz wood (Crossopterix febrifuga) (RG. 18805; De Deken) and of lukwanga wood (Hymenocardia acida) (RG. 43863; Fourche); see Gustaaf Verswijver et al., eds., Treasures from the Africa-Museum Tervuren, exh. cat. (Tervuren, 1995), cat. nos. 1io-11. While the figure collected in the region between 1933 and 1936 by Dr. Tiarko Fourche looks used and weather-beaten, the one acquired by Father Constant De Deken at the end of the nineteenth century is remarkably unblemished. Perhaps Father De Deken got it shortly after it was made, but it may very well be that this refined, almost manneristic figure was being carved specifically for sale to Europeans. This would also explain why no cavity was made at the top of the figure's head to hold the bishimba. 1ii. Rafael van Caeneghem wrote that when a man dies without having fathered children, "a sharpened end-piece of a boxwood sprig is driven into his back," and that a woman who dies childless is buried "with a piece of pottery on her head"; see Van Caeneghem, "Het vrijgezellen-leven in de spreekwoor- den van Luba- en Moyo-volk," Congo 21, I (Jan. 1940), p. 5o. See also Remi Mbiyangandu, "Le But du mariage," Bulletin du Centre d'etude des prob- lemes sociaux indigenes 17 (1951), p. 23. Figures holding a small cup filled with porcelain clay in one hand also tend to symbolize fertility and pregnancy. They are called lupingu lea bwsimpe by the Luluwa; the Luba-Lubilanji, who apparently imported their sculptures from the Luluwa, prefer the name bulenga. These figures were made specifically whenever children deemed beautiful were born and were primarily intended to safeguard and foster the beauty and the health of such newborns. See Maesen (note 6), pp. 52-54; and Tshisanda Ntabala-Mweny (note 3), pp. 89-92. 12. See Marie-Louise Bastin, "A Propos du Panier divinatoire tshokwe," Arts d'Afrique noire 68 (Winter 1988), pp. 19-27. In several villages, I was told that the Luluwa placed small, anthropomorphic figures in the divination basket. See Fourche and Morlighem (note 4), pp. 21-22; and David A. McLean and Ted J. Solomon, "Divination Among the Bena Lulua," Journal of Religion in Africa 4, 1 (1971), p. 34. 13. This is probably the aqua lustralis (nsompo), meant to ward off and neu- tralize negative influences, described by Leo Stappers in his studies on the BaaMilembwe (Songye) of eastern Kasai. The author distinguished between sprinkling and washing, which is always done in a centrifugal motion, and emphasized that the salutary effect of the potion is due to the intervention of the ancestral spirits; see Stappers, "Nsompo, het aqua lustralis bij de BaaMilembwe," Kongo-Overzee 16, 5 (June 1950o), p. 299; and idem, "Prieres luba-kasaayi datant de 1912," Cahiers des religions africaines 3, 5 (Jan. 1969), p. 115. 14. Muteba Nzambi Mushipula wrote about the cizaba receptacle that the Luba-Lubilanji used in their kukobolola ritual, which was meant to remove impurities from newborn children. Impurities (mikiya; singular, mukiya) may be a blemish, an irregularity, or "moral ugliness" sustained at birth. The actual kukobolola denotes the lifting of the mother's sexual abstinence and the presen- tation of the newborn child to the ancestors. Special births are accompanied by particular mzklya and a separate kukobolola; see Muteba Nzambi Mushipula, "'Mukiya,' 'Tshibau' et 'Tshibindi': Sanction sociale et morale chez les Luba du Kasa'," Zaire-Afrique 27 (May 1987), pp. 277-79.

Such special births, which are generally called mapanga (singular; bupanga), entail observing specific prescriptions and prohibitions. Still, a number of sources clearly distinguish between manga children and mapanga children.

The contextual information on fig. 6 in the present article, which was photographed during linguistic field research by Professor Amaat Burssens among the Luluwa in 1937, is based upon Albert Macsen's field notes of 1954 (notebooks no. 29, p. 36, and no. 30, p. 70, Ethnography Section, Royal Museum for Central Africa, Tervuren).

In Negerkunsr und Negerkiinstler (Braunschweig, 1960), Hans Himmelbeber, referring to the Luba-Shaba and the Fang (Gabon), intuitively stated that such half-figures end- ing on a point might be intended for a "fetish basket" (p. 399). However, during his visit to the Luluwa in 1939, Himmelbeber did not himself see half-figures in context. The woven baskets collected by Albert Macsen in 1954 for the Royal Museum for Central Africa in Tervuren were not large enough to contain any- thing but bishimba and small cibola sculptures (see RG. 53.74-432o and RG. 53-74-4323). 20. Contrary to what Paul Timmermans suggested, it is unlikely that large half- figures in a refined style, such as the one in the Brooklyn Museum of Art (fig. 7), were also meant for women to wear at the belt; see Timmermans (note 9), p. 24. 21.

The Luluwa, much like many other Bantu peoples, attribute special cultural meaning to the moon (mwenshi). They believe that the moon cycle influences human fertility; the reappearance of the moon after a moonless period is wel- comed with dances of joy. For further information, see Thfodore (Jacques) A. Theuws, De Luba-mens (Tervuren, 1962), pp. 300-305; and Allen E Roberts, "Social and Historical Contexts of Tabwa Art," in Roberts and Evan M. Maurer, eds., The Rising of a New Moon: A Century of Tabwa Art, exh. cat. (Ann Arbor, Mich., 1985), pp. 1-3. 22. Macsen (note 6), p. 53. The figure in the Art Institute originally had a "waxy" patina as well. The only existing photograph prior to its "cleaning," is not clear enough to draw definite conclusions as to the patina's composition. See Sotheby's, New York, Fine African and Oceanic Art (Nov. 14, 1980: lot 227). 23. See August De Clercq, "Lubavolkeren in den spiegel van bun spreuken," Onze Kongo 2, 2 (Sept. 1911), p. 96; Alidoor Samain, "Geschiedenis der Bena Lulua's," Congo 3, 2 (July 1922), p. 232; and Fourche and Morlighem (note 21), p. 637. The Luba-Lubilanji call the original inhabitants and landowners basan- gana and distinguish them from the bakalenga, the rulers from outside the area; see Denolf (note i), pp. 349, 388. 24. The lwendu lwa mucipu ritual demonstrates that women have always had an unobtrusive though profound influence on political decisions. When a series of accidents or problems beset several villages at once, the chiefs will jointly perform the cipumba ritual. If this fails to achieve the desired results, the chiefs will turn to elderly women and widows. These women come together in secret at night and hold a "cursing-march" through the village. Almost naked, with the exception of a small loincloth, their bodies painted white with lupemba kaolin, they sing songs and march to a crossroads at the edge of the village. While pronouncing secret spells and formulas, they sacrifice a dog, which is buried at the crossroads. See Badibanga Kantshama and Tshishimbi Katumumonyi, "Le Rble de la femme dans la soci~t~ luluwa," Les Cahiers du CEREKA I, i (June 1988), pp. 88-90. 25. In this regard, I believe it useful to refer to the distinction made by Roberts (note 21) in his discussion of the Tabwa between "statement" and "process" arts (pp. io-i6, 23). Statement art is concerned with perpetuating an existing order and the glorification of an existing authority, while process art is directed toward making change or solving problems connected with change. Inspired by the anthropologist Victor Turner, Roberts associated statement art with cer- emony as "confirmatory," and process art with ritual as "transformative." Among the Tabwa, statement art "rose in the specific politico-economic condi- tions of the mid-nineteenth century, when Tabwa chiefs sought to consolidate their power" (p. io). However; among the Luluwa there are no ancestral figures that "represent their lineage and arc a focus of prayers to ancestral spirits." 26. A similar distinction between figures made for the whole community by professional sculptors and figures made for individuals by religious specialists was described in the case of the neighboring Chokwe and Songyc. See Marie- Louise Bastin, "Les Styles de la sculpture tshokwe," Arts d'Afrique noire 19 (Autumn 1976), p. 17; and Hersak (note 5), pp. 140-60. 27. The Luluwa's preference for women as art subjects is strongly reminiscent of the Luba-Shaba. See Mary H. Nooter, "Secret Signs in Luba Sculptural Narrative: A Discourse on Power;" Iowa Studies in African Art 3 (1990), p. 45; and idem, "Fragments of Forsaken Glory: Luba Royal Culture Invented and Represented (1883-1992) (Zaire)," in Erna Beumers and Hans-Joachim Koloss, eds., Kings of Africa: Art and Authority in Central Africa, exh. cat.

Rafael Van Caeneghem's monograph Hekserij hzj de Baluba van Kasai* (Brussels, 1955), which for the most part applies to the Luluwa, is probably one of the most thorough studies on this subject. 32.

The erotic conno- tations of the tactile aspect of the scarifications again remind us of the Luba- Shaba. See Mary Nooter Roberts and Allen F Roberts, "Body Memory," in Roberts and Roberts, eds., Memory: Luba Art and the Making of History, exh. cat. (New York, 1996), pp. 111-12. The Luluwa also apply scarifications for healing purposes. See Diambila Luboya (note 1i), pp. 165, 16q. 34. Von Wissmann (note i), pp. 166-67. Frobenius (note i) mentioned that Chokwe decorations gradually took the place of Kuba elements in scarification, especially among the western Luluwa (p. 13; compare figs. 9 and 34, and see also fig. 430). At the time of Frobenius's visit, elderly people among the north- ern Luluwa apparently still had elaborate curvilinear nsalu (p. 14 and figs. 9-13).</page></plain_text>
