<plain_text><page sequence="1">Bramante's Belvedere and a Painting by Raffaello dal Colle in The Waters Art Gallery PHILIPPE VERDIER Kress Professor, The National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC IP^SlfilJ ne ?ftne fascinating aftermaths of catalogues n?S^Sj ?^ Breat collections, such as that of the Mas k^g^i sarenti collection of paintings in The Wal *^^ J ters Art Gallery, is that they cut clear the way for discoveries after attributions have been placed through scholarly analysis in their true perspective. Such is the case with Federico Zeri's work, Italian Paintings in the Walters Art Gallery.x The catalogue has been heralded as a model of its kind, in particular by John Pope-Hennessy m Apollo, September 1976.2 One painting, Madonna and Child with the Young Saint John the Baptist by Raffaello dal Colle, is, from the point of view of architectural iconography, of great his torical significance (fig.l). Raffaello dal Colle (Raffaello di Michelangelo de Lucca dal Colle), already active by 1516 (he died in 1566), first assisted Raphael in the Far nesina and the Vatican; after Raphael's death in 1520, and until 1524, he assisted Giulio Romano.3 The paint ing in The Walters Art Gallery, which is an early work of Raffaello, had been attributed at first to Giulio Romano after a model by Raphael. This attribution was kept for a replica showing the composition in reverse, cited in the catalogue of the paintings in the Borghese Gallery, Rome.4 The Walters painting is a key example of the incipient Mannerist style in the transitional phase be tween the last works of Raphael and the first works of Giulio Romano. It also documents a monumental achievement of the Renaissance in Rome, Bramante's Cortile de Belvedere in the Vatican Gardens. The group of the Madonna and Child with the young Saint John the Baptist was painted by Raffaello dal Colle as a "close up," dominated by a romantic ruin in the shape of an unfinished h?micycle with steps?an exedra. Vegetation creeps along the disjointed cornice and up the supports of the ambulatory. From the aedi cula (doorway) in the center, issue forth three figures (fig. 2), the most conspicuous being a girl gracefully balancing a jar on the top of her head. Farther to the left is Saint Joseph (fig. 3), groping his way with a cane, about to descend the steps. The staircase presents a struc ture that is no less remarkable than unmistakable (fig. 4). It consists of nine convex risers in its lower part. The steps become concave above, expanding into a cavea Such a staircase is a record of the very one imag ined and engineered by Bramante at the northern end of the terminal of the cortile, or courtyard, of the Belvedere in the Vatican Gardens (fig. 5). The first architect to Pope Julius II (1503?13), Bramante designed, partially built, and left the structure unfinished at the time of his death (1514). The cortile provided not only a monumental link, but an architectural landscape, covering more than 300 meters in the valley between the Borgia apartments in the Vatican Palace and the Belvedere, a villa built on a northern slope by Pope Innocent VIII (1484?92 ).5 Of the cortile as Bramante projected it (fig. 6), with an extraordinary extension of three progressively as cending terraces, linked by a monumental staircase and parallel ramps between three-story alleys and galleries, nothing was retained by Raffaello dal Colle in his paint ing. Only the apex of the whole vista, the exedra, struck his fancy. Even this small excerpt was rendered ambigu ously, the artist having shifted the exedra out of axis. That Mannerist trick, combined with other subtle de vices, probably explains why Bramante's exedra has The Journal of The Walters Art Gallery 41 (1983) 45</page><page sequence="2">46</page><page sequence="3">M 1.

The ideal point chosen by Bramante for focusing on the exedra was the central, southern window of Raphael's Stanza delta Segnatura, above and in the middle of the Borgia apartments. From this point of view, the horizon is at the top of the structure, where the exedra crowns Bramante's rational fantasy. Raffaello's shifting of axis invites the viewer to concen trate on the Virgin and Child. He does not perceive the exedra from afar and above, but at a closer range and in a di sotto in su perspective. The architectural axis is such that, were its western limit to be represented in the painting, the exedra would jump beyond the cortile bounds. Consequently, the right half of Raffaello's exe dra, corresponding to the northeast of Bramante's, is foreshortened, while the left half, corresponding to the northwest, is expanded and pivoted forward. The contrast between the bulky figures in the foreground, and, above them an off-center, dwarfed architectural motif, was adopted shortly after Raphael's death (1520) by Giulio Romano, as one of his revolu tionary innovations. Giulio's Sacra Conversazione above the main altar of Santa Maria dell'Anima, Rome (fig. 7), is composed on the same principles as Raffaello's painting in The Walters Art Gallery?with the qualifica tion that the exedra appearing in the upper left corner of Giulio's work is viewed from the inside and looks rather like an ambulatory in an atrium or a cloister. Raffaello dal Colle was associated with Gianfran cesco Penni to decorate, after cartoons designed by Giulio Romano, the Hall of Constantine (the Sala di Costantino) between Raphael's three Stanze and his Loggie in the Vatican Palace. In the window jambs of the Hall of Constantine is a painting of a two-storied exedra (which must have been executed prior to October 47</page><page sequence="4">4.

Fresco in Castel Sant'Angelo, Rome. 1524, when Giulio Romano left for Mantua). Frederick Hartt has attributed to Raffaello the allegorical figures of Faith and Religion, which bracket the enthroned figure of Pope Sylvester, as well as the caryatid figures.7 The entablature of the decorative exedra is supported by caryatids in the same style. The double staircase, convex below and concave above, recalls the one designed by Bramante for the cortile exedra; the fountain may be reminiscent ofthat in the lower court of the Belvedere. Such a combination of a cavea of concave steps and a fountain, however, can be found in Roman gardens, and possibly was inspired here by a ruin such as the Lava crumAgrippae, not far from the church o? Santa Maria sopra Minerva* Another fresco in the Hall of Con stantine, showing Pope Sylvester baptizing Constantine in a cavea with five risers or steps, a h?micycle of arches, and a niche behind them, seems to owe more to Roman architecture than to Bramante. The podium on which the Virgin is seated in the Walters painting, though, is not unlike the pedestal of the caryatids in the Hall of Constantine fresco.9 The pilasters separating the bays end in Ionic volutes in the painting and are of the Tuscan order in the fresco. In 1551, Bramante's convex and concave staircase was replaced by a rectangular one with two opposite flights of steps, Michelangelo's design.10 A platform, which leveled off the cavea in the h?micycle and the exedra itself; enclosed within a newly built semicircular wall, became a corridor. The huge niche, the famous nicchione (fig.8), which today is at the north, ending the upper half of the disfigured Cortile del Belvedere, was built by Pirro Ligorio and vaulted in May 156311 Bramante's exedra was buried in the supporting struc ture of the nicchione, and his staircase was completely obliterated. A dozen visual documents of the second quarter of the sixteenth century, including the decora tion mentioned in the Hall of Constantine and a fresco later transferred to canvas in Castel Sant'Angelo, how ever, have preserved the memory of Bramante's inge nious concept for the staircase. Of paramount impor tance for its reconstitution are: a plan of the whole cortile by an anonymous Florentine architect, drawn c. 1520-25, now at the Soane Museum, London; a plan and an elevation by an anonymous French architect, drawn before 1535, now at Windsor Castle; two plates? a plan and an elevation?drawn before 1535, in Sebas tiano Serlio's De Le Antiquit?, Libro Terzo, the Venice edition of 1540 (fig.9); a plan by Baldassare Peruzzi, drawn after October 1534, now at the Uffizi, Florence; and the panoramic fresco of a view of the cortile from the top of the Vatican Palace, painted as a sort of Hel lenistic Capriccio by Perino del Vaga, between 1537 and 49</page><page sequence="6">7.

It should be noted that Michelangelo took inspira tion from Bramante^ double (convex and concave) staircase in designing a first project for the staircase in the entrance hall of the Laurentian Library, Florence?a commission of the Medici Pope Clement VII (1523 34).13 However, the staircase was not completed until 155914 In the meantime, Michelangelo had a dream in which he saw a vision of a different staircase,15 the actual one with its crescent-shaped risers, dirninishing in width until reaching the door of the library, the lateral, straight flights of steps on the left and the right, flanking the converging banisters of the central portion. This central part, as Michelangelo explained to Vasari, was reserved for the masters; the lateral parts, for the use of the servants. Seven steps from the top, however, the two parts coalesced. The final version, a hybrid of Bramante's staircase to the Belvedere exedra and its replacement of 1551 by Michelangelo, materializes Michelangelo's curiously anthropomorphic conception of architecture, in which the nose which stands in the middle of the face is not depending on either eye, although one hand must of necessity correspond with the other, because they are placed at the sides and in pairs. Therefore, it is very certain that architectural members depend on the mem bers of the human body. He that has not mastered or does not master the human figure and especially its anatomy can never comprehend it.16 The documents are at variance concerning the number of steps of Bramante's staircase. The most relia ble of all, Peruzzi's sketch, registers scalini 16, i.e., eight convex followed by eight concave steps. That number is supported by Giorgio Vasari in the seventh book of the first edition of his Lives, published in Venice in 1550 (n.s. 1551 ).17 Raffaello dal Colle, in showing nine convex risers in the lower part of the staircase, does not fall very far from the mark. The staircase is, archaeologically speaking, the soundest element represented in Raffaello's composi tion. The design of Bramante's staircase remains a mys tery Could it have been envisioned as a sort of bipartite, three-dimensional labyrinth,18 at the same time a secret 52</page><page sequence="9">10.

Such a perfect symmetrical staircase was falling into disfavor towards the middle of the sixteenth century In one of Vasari's frescoes in the Salone dei Cento Giorni of the Palazzo della Canceller?a, Rome, a Mannerist double staircase is made up in its lower part of two narrow rectangular flights of steps meeting at a single, half-oval step and re-expanding into a cavea of five steps (fig. 10).19 Vasari's solution was a compromise?an uneasy one?between Bramante's design and Michelangelo's radical departure, which erased all reference to the idea of circularity in his new staircases for the cortile exedra, as well as for the fa?ade of the Palazzo Senatorio, on the Capitoline Hill. It is universally recognized that the temple o? For tuna Primigenia on the slope of the hill at Palestrina was the chief source of Bramante's inspiration in design ing the Cortile del Belvedere. 2? The combination of a straight (perpendicular) staircase and an upper cavea leading to an exedra signaled the apex of a succession of ascending sanctuaries and porticoes, alleys and ramps, h?micycles and flights of steps, building up the com plex, immense monument of the mid-second century b.c.21 Laying bare the various infrastructures of the Palestrina temple by destroying the city that had grown among its ruins, the bombings of 1944 made more obvious its derivation.22 Five drawings executed on the spot by Palladio, in 1571 and 1572, bear testimony to what Bramante was actually able to see in the early sixteenth century23 They retrace the scratch line from which his imagination started rolling.24 Ideally, Raffaello dal Colle's painted exedra is more in agreement with the archaeological model in Palestrina than with its rena scence of less than a half-century later at the end of the Cortile del Belvedere. Bramante's exedra was a one-story wall scooped out by alternating niches and doorways (see fig. 5). In the Walters painting the semicircular ambulatory resembles the Palestrina exedra, except that the Palestrina one was not a simple corridor or a curved loggia, but had a double aisle (fig. 11). We may presume that Raffaello went to Palestrina and wistfully meditated there. But neither he, nor Bramante, nor anyone living during the first third of the sixteenth century, could have seen with his naked eyes the unadulterated Pale strina exedra, because it had already been defaced dur ing the Middle Ages and transformed by Stefano 54</page><page sequence="11">12.

The Hermitage Museum, Leningrad. In this little-known composition, the concetto of the open circular gallery and the concave staircase are Bramante-esque. The figures are painted on state, a material that gives the oil pigments a silvery sheen. (State was also used by Sebastiano delPiombo and Daniele da Wterra.) The material was easily obtained at Fontainebleau, where Francis I in 1532 invited It Primaticcio to join II Rosso, but the painting could as easily be a work preceding It Primaticcio's departure for France.27 Colonna (after 1448) and his son Francesco (between 1490 and 1504) into a two-story palace, the plan of which, however, respected the curve of the ancient exedra.25 Access to the central semicircular part of the Colonna Palace was provided by the ancient cavea, but the primitive straight and perpendicular lower flight of steps had been replaced by two narrow converging ones, parallel with the fa?ade of the concave courtyard, an anticipation of the staircase painted by Vasari in 1546 and of the two staircases designed by Michelangelo, mentioned above. The romantic character of Raffaello dal Colle's re constitution in the Walters painting is intimated by the creeping vegetation artificially aging the architectural fentasy of the exedra and returning it to a state of nature, by the fantastic duplication of the steps on the right of the painting, and by trees wildly shooting on the slope and in the opposite corner, near the concave steps. Such free foliage harks back to a motif traditional in Helle nistic landscape painting. The statues set in the niches have nothing to do with the antiques assembled in the statue courtyard of the Belvedere since the early six teenth century. We associate them more readily with the statues adorning the niches in the garden of Raphael's Villa Madama Thus, Raffaello dal Colle's architectural fantasy is made up of observed elements mixed with figments of his imagination. It is fundamentally a Capriccio, and an early and fascinating one in a genre that was to become glorious in the history of Italian landscape painting. A proud Madonna of Humility, the Virgin is seated at the intermediate level of a Cortile del Belvedere both real and unreal, conceived here as a pagan version of a "para dise," the enclosed garden of the Song of Songs. Above her hovers, like a crown, the h?micycle of the exedra, pregnant with evocations not only of Bramante and Pale strina, but of the garden nymphaea, then so numerous among the ruins of ancient Rome.26 The Virgin being the Fountain of Grace, does not Raffaello dal Colle's Ma donna deserve to be called Our Lady oftheNymphaeum?
