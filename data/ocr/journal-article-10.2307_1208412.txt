<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SOIL AND MAN'S INTELLIGENCE: THREE CONTEMPORARY LANDSCAPE POETS Bonnie Costello The American imagination, which has been identified with the land- scape from the beginning, is most successful when it retains some form of attachment to the soil. Henry James admitted in The Art of Travel, "fact gives more to the imagination than the imagination gives to fact" (15). When precept strays too far from percept, poetic invention from observation, metaphor from attention to the world, our language often grows stale. Description provides the constant renewal of abstraction, its natural resource. The romantic symbol asserted a relation of mind and matter based on their participation in a common essence. Thus the principle of "organic form" assumed a continuity between the poet's artifice and his natural, corporeal reality. Yet that attachment to soil can no longer be an organic or native one, if it ever truly was so. Emerson's theory of language makes nature the original of human language. It is through nature that the universal spirit speaks to the individual, and one who accurately describes what he sees expresses his contact with God. Modern thought has re-emphasized the discontinuity that romanticism resisted. The theory of correspondence-in which the symbol partakes of the reality it represents - has been replaced by the arbitrariness of the sign. It is based on a principle of return, from a condition of estrangement. The new attachment is necessarily rhetorical or figura- tive rather than natural, and it must be inventive, not nostalgic. This awareness is present throughout American modernism and its preoccu- pation with the particular -in William Carlos Williams, in his insis- tence that the poem bears an appositional, not organic, imitative or oppositional relationship to the real; in Marianne Moore, who cele- brates nature's neatness of finish while inventing her own imaginary Contemporary Literature XXX, 3 0010-7484/89/0003-0412 $1.50/0 ?1989 by the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System</page><page sequence="2">gardens. Yet American modernism (and our postmodern readings of it) persists in an almost willful forgetting of this discontinuity. We still seem to want God, not figuration, in the details. The pastoral romance of the body, the earth, as a cure of our abstractions, continues in con- temporary poetry. Wallace Stevens provides the most vigorous, if paradoxical, example of how the American imagination might attach itself to soil without relinquishing poetic authority. "Man is the intelligence of his soil," pronounces Stevens's Comedian as he sets out on his westward journey, only to arrive at America, the idea of a colony based on the regrounding of the imagination in place. He inverts his proposition: "His Soil is man's intelligence. / That's better. That's worth crossing seas to find" (36). But this second phrase remains as laconic as the first, and between these two laconic phrases lies the essential tension of American poetry and the space of its invention. The urge toward Significance, toward mastery of the landscape by mind and by poetic order, has repeatedly contended with a prodigal humility toward the earth, as the locus of significance and the proper source of moral and aesthetic order. For me, the maximization of this tension and this space is one touchstone of the vitality of our poetry. Stevens's Crispin moves from cultured to primitive vision; his colony is originary rather than original. Contemporary American poets followed Stevens in seeking ways to base a poetry in the earth while preserving the authority, or at least autonomy, of the imagination and language. It remains a diverse and uncompleted project for our time. To illustrate the range of stances toward the landscape in this tran- sitional phase of return, from symbolist alienation to figurative attach- ment, I will present a triptych of poems drawn from three authors: Gary Snyder, A. R. Ammons, and Charles Wright. They represent perennial modes. The immanentist (so named by Charles Altieri [Temple 29-52]) finds a plenitude in the landscape and aims for the most unmediated presentation of that plenitude. Gary Snyder is our contemporary immanentist. The analogist pursues the parallels between landscape and mind, allowing each its autonomy and authority. Ammons best represents this mode. The transcendentalist (of which Charles Wright is a complex example) attends to the landscape for the traces of an inorganic ideal. These modes may alternatively be named pantheist, contemplative, and mystic, since religious rhetoric and motive are still so deeply entangled in our poets' stances toward landscape. These poets have achieved distinctly contemporary vision within these modes. My own imaginative sympathies lie most with the LANDSCAPE POETS I 413</page><page sequence="3">analogist (though Wright, the mystic, is my favorite of the three poets). But I believe the vitality of our poetry depends upon the coexistence of these three modes and their tendency to stand in implicit dialogue with one another. For Gary Snyder, as for many others (Wendell Berry, Mary Oliver, even James Wright), the cure of the ground has meant a return to the landscape as the locus of spirit and the center of human meaning and continuity. The landscape becomes guide and model of the imagination. Snyder has generated more power than others from this materialist reduction because he has most successfully purged it of romanticism, yoking a Zen Emersonianism to the pragmatic rhetoric of science and ecology. But too often Snyder forgets the rhetorical nature of this reduction to Emerson's Beautiful Necessity, his primitivism losing its force in a nostalgic forgetting of the estranged (and liberated) intelli- gence. A. R. Ammons's poetry has much in common with Snyder's; he is equally susceptible to nostalgia. But the strength of his poetry does not rest on the precarious identification of physics and metaphysics. The landscape is less an object of identification or, to use Snyder's term, "interpenetration," than a natural resource, always elusive in its essence and totality but freely available to poetic plunder and the tantalizing pleasure of naming. In this sense Ammons resembles Mari- anne Moore (or more recently, John Ashbery) rather than immanentists such as William Carlos Williams or Snyder. But Ammons by no means gives up his longing to merge with the elements. If his is chiefly a poetry of analogy and apposition, the will to surrender consciousness to soil repeatedly asserts itself. If the numinous is immanent in Snyder and approachable in Ammons, it is traceable in Charles Wright. He shares none of the other poets' enthusiasm for organic process; his ideal abides in crystal, on the other side of the river Styx. This is a transcendentalism mingled with a modern passion for the void. The figurative possibilities of land- scape rest on a principle of absence, and aesthetic pleasure is derived from an identification with the most fugitive moments in nature. But if there is nothing of the immanentist in Wright, neither is he a poet of minimalist negations or mystical absorptions. Unlike Mark Strand, W. S. Merwin, and others whose imaginations turn toward the void and set to work describing absence, Wright's poetry is marked by a sensuous beauty and particularity very different from, yet unsurpassed by, Snyder and Ammons. He is foremost among contemporary poets in developing the theme of death as the source of creative energies, 414 I CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="4">adding his own complex stance to those of Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, and Wallace Stevens. This theme, as he interprets it and behaves within it, rejects any notion of poetry or the earth as a cure for longing. Those who measure the value and vitality of poetry within such a standard of cure will find his work inadequate. But he will satisfy those who read the American tradition as the struggle of imagination to attach itself to soil without submitting to it. Gary Snyder's bold project is to restore the imagination to the stance of the primitive. He has come closer than any other American poet to imagining the world as one of Stevens's future primitives in "Sunday Morning," "chanting orgy to the sun," might. Communal, ritualistic, boisterously physical, utopian, this is a consciousness fully occupied by the present, ecstatically embracing necessity. It is a form of vision which Stevens prophesies but never adopts, his Platonism and his need for poetic authority always balking at such reductions. But Snyder is not altogether different from Stevens in this, for his "primitive" imagination and the body in which it is invested remain figurative in his best work. The need for poetic authority struggles with his poetic thesis so that the poems often equivocate as to whether the body is material or tropological. When it is material, poetic authority is reduced but replaced by prophetic, ideological authority. What Snyder's theory does not account for, but what his poetry at its best demonstrates, is that his primitive is inescapably rhetori- cal. His cultural and poetic project is one of reinhabitation (to become natives rather than invaders of the earth). The project is haunted by the contrary condition from which it begins. The poem "Wave" is central not only to the volume Regarding Wave but to all of Snyder's work, since it establishes his principle of unity and of process as plenitude. Grooving clam shell, streakt through marble, sweeping down ponderosa pine bark-scale rip-cut tree grain sand-dunes, lava flow Wave wife. woman - wyfman - "veiled; vibrating; vague" sawtooth ranges pulsing; veins on the back of the hand.

Leaning against sand cornices til they blow away - wind, shake stiff thorns of cholla, ocotillo sometimes I get stuck in thickets- Ah, trembling spreading radiating wyf racing zebra catch me and fling me wide To the dancing grain of things of my mind!1 The master trope of the wave connects individual images of dis- parate proportion and origin. But the poem is not meant to be a verbal machine (as it was for Williams). And the wave is not entirely treated as a trope. The poem is an instance or reification of the wave, a nodule of energy, a part cognizant of the whole. Language is not evaded or countered in this energy, but absorbed into it, a center of continuity expressing other organic continuities. The poem deliberately gives priority to verbs, absorbing noun differences into the continuities of process. Indeed, syntactic ambiguities merge verbs, adjectives, and nouns so as to erase all suggestion of a hierarchy or agency. Language is a native, not an invader of the earth. The last third of the poem introduces the self, not as agent but as object - to be released, caught, flung in this "wave." Yet the possi- bility of agency returns in the metaphoric use of language toward the end of the poem, in which the landscape becomes figurative of emo- tional states and the disparate realities regather in the mind. And what the self is flung to, finally, is "the dancing grain of things / of my mind" (emphasis added). The association of wave with wife in the Anglo-Saxon "wyf" further separates the figuring imagination from the nature of which it is supposedly a part. This wife is also "veiled." This figure reinvokes oppositions of mind and nature and a model of penetration rather than interpretation. The poem "Song of the Taste" and other poems in the middle section of Regarding Wave remove the self as subject of natural 'Gary Snyder, "Wave," Regarding Wave. Copyright ?1968 by Gary Snyder.

These poems use gerunds as subjects and subordinate to direct objects both things of the natural world and finally the human self. The major figures of the poem are partaking and nurturing, which are literalized - Snyder's usual procedure- as much as possible. Eating the living germs of grasses Eating the ova of large birds the fleshy sweetness packed around the sperm of swaying trees The muscles of the flanks and thighs of soft-voiced cows the bounce in the lamb's leap the swish in the ox's tail Eating roots grown swoll inside the soil Drawing on life of living clustered points of light spun out of space hidden in the grape. Eating each other's seed eating ah, each other. Kissing the lover in the mouth of bread: lip to lip.2 The figure of nurture merges with that of sexual intercourse, a merging itself treated literally but gradually revealing its metaphoric basis. The image in the first line is one of feeding. That the seeds of reproduc- tion are eaten is really incidental, though it forms an interesting con- flict of realms. But at the end of the poem the emphasis is on sexual gratification. The situation is reversed and "eating" is the figurative term. Both eating and mating are, of course, parts of the generative process, but Snyder has tied them together at the end of the poem in an entirely figurative and chiasmic way, making eating the vehicle of sexual process. In this inversion, metaphoric invention asserts itself over natural processes and man is again the intelligence of his soil, almost to the point of the decadents. But Snyder's aesthetic explicitly 2Gary Snyder, "Song of the Taste," Regarding Wave. Copyright ?1968 by Gary Snyder. First published in Poetry. Reprinted by permission of New Directions Pub- lishing Corporation. LANDSCAPE POETS 417</page><page sequence="7">prohibits poetic authority and requires the yielding of imagination to a fecund passivity in the landscape. The "Real Work," he tells us in one poem, is "washing and sighing, / sliding by" (Turtle Island 32). The imagination that would reside fully in the present replaces temporal with spatial consciousness and history with ecology, topog- raphy, and geology. In "Wave," the spatial imagination is clearly meta- phoric: "birdsfoot-alluvium wash" and "veins on the back of the hand." But the pressure of Snyder's poetics is to literalize these relations, to make spatial presence triumph over temporal loss, as in another poem: "squirrel hairs, / squirrel bones crunched, / tight and dry in scats of / fox" (Turtle Island 40). This kind of literal continuity is quite dif- ferent from the metaphoric one above. Even Whitman, whose decom- posing body feeds the grass, held a less material, some might say less debased, notion of bodily continuity. "Straight Creek -Great Burn" (Turtle Island 52-53) is a clear example of the spatial imagination and its treatment of history. It also indicates Snyder's gradual movement away from objectivist configura- tions and his turn to a passive, scenic mode. The first part of the poem characteristically describes a landscape without inhabitants or witness, a vision free of human agency: Lightly, in the April mountains - Straight Creek, dry grass freed again of snow &amp; the chickadees are pecking last fall's seeds fluffing tail in chilly wind, Avalanche piled up cross the creek and chunked-froze solid - water sluicing under; spills out rock lip pool, bends over, braided, white, foaming, returns to trembling deep-dark hole. The description, like others by Snyder, emphasizes movement: solid elements are included in order to be enfolded with the general flow. We see a tableau of frozen chunks the result of avalanches, boulders indicating flow near lines, and later "tumbled talus rock / of geosyn- cline warm sea bottom." This poem also illustrates again the tension in Snyder's work between materialist and mythic vision and between the cure of the 418 I CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="8">ground and the urge to transcendence. The eye moves naturally, but also rhetorically, from the sense of the past arising out of spatial aware- ness to the "eternal / azure," and it is in this mythic realm that the beholder is mentioned: us resting on dry fern and watching Shining Heaven change his feather garments overhead. A whoosh of birds swoops up and round tilts back almost always flying all apart and yet hangs on! together; never a leader, all of one swift empty dancing mind. They arc and loop &amp; then their flight is done. they settle down. end of poem.3 Shining Heaven becomes momentarily figurative, a Keatsian bird born out of the particular birds that launch the poem with the processes of nature: "pecking / last fall's seeds." But Snyder quickly returns from this mythic moment to another naturalistic one, grounding the poetic imagination in the material rather than identifying it with some eternal principle, as the young Keats might have done. The poetic mind attempts to identify itself with the "empty / dancing mind" of the birds, to yield to instinct and resist its will to dominate ("never a leader"). The poem ends with the arc of the birds' flight, though it had not been controlled by it earlier. The symbolist eternal azure cannot become the focal point; earthly birds, not celestial ones, provide the model for poetic invention. But a lively tension develops in the poem among three points of view - that of the heaven gazers, that of the birds, and 3From Gary Snyder, "Straight Creek-Great Burn," Turtle Island.

LANDSCAPE POETS I 419</page><page sequence="9">that of the poet, which is reduced to that of the birds at the end, but only then. Snyder's relaxation of figurative invention, and his forsaking of it at extreme moments, leads him in his most recent work to a laconic and even prosaic style, and increasingly to the substitution of ideo- logical for poetic authority. What used to be organizing tropes are now reduced to images or subjects in an anecdotal frame. The struc- ture of the poem "River in the Valley," for instance, in some ways resembles that of "Straight Creek," but the poem rests passively in the scenic mode. Stanzas begin "[1] We cross the Sacramento River at Colusa ... [2] Gen runs in little circles looking up ... [3] Kai leans silent against a concrete pier ... [4] I pick grass seeds from my socks" (Axe Handles 58). It is hard to muster enthusiasm for the symbolic action of some- one picking grass seed from his socks. Snyder seems compelled to make a bald statement of his theme at the end, uncertain of its presence in particulars, unassisted by poetic authority: "the river is all of it every- where, / all flowing at once, / all one place." For Snyder the poetic mind is fundamentally passive, "Like Com- post," he says (Axe Handles 75). Williams, too, saw poetry in agrarian terms and called for an attachment to soil, but the poet was for Williams a composing antagonist. Snyder's entire project hopes to end such antagonism, to harvest the very different fruits of an unalienated intelligence. Ammons participates in some of the same contemporary pastoral- ism for which Snyder is known. Both poets intermix religious and scien- tific (especially ecological) discourse, though Ammons is more Emer- sonian than Zen-like. Both poets also attempt to combine the prophetic with the lyric voice, offering the soil as the object and model of man's intelligence. Ammons often hovers around an immanentist mode which abandons all rhetoricity in the presence of the particular, but his imagination never truly entertains the primitive. While he enjoys those moments when poetic authority is disarmed by natural presence, the submissive or natural voice is often a foil for a highly rhetorical vision. If he subscribes at all to the notion that the soil is man's intelligence, it is more as plunderer than as apostle of that soil that he displays his debt. Early Ammons displays on the surface a great deal of anxiety about the relation between landscape and imagination. But often the result of that anxiety is a reassertion of the imagination's independent 420 I CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="10">purposes. Indeed, finding himself a superfluity in nature's presence, the poet and his forms must become grounded on principles of com- pletion and participation that are other than those of primitive organi- cism. Where Snyder's poetry of immanence denies the superfluity of mind in the organic whole, Ammons's poetry sometimes makes a virtue of it. Perhaps the most extreme example of this parallel geography in Ammons is "Terrain," a poem which might be called Emersonian for seeing nature as a metaphor of spirit. Unlike Emerson, Ammons emphasizes the expansive, multiple, and diverse rather than the unitary nature of spirit. The metaphoric structure of "Terrain" is one of parallel extension; here spirit and nature do not align as the one versus the many, and signification is not immanent or transcendental. The poem is Thoreau-like in its relish of detail, but also almost Rimbaud-like in its lush geographic fantasy and its essential abstraction. The poem begins, "The soul is a region without definite boundaries: / it is not certain a prairie / can exhaust it / or a range enclose it" and continues to display this proposition: it floats (self-adjusting) like the continental mass, where it towers most extending its deepest mantling base (exactly proportional): does not flow all one way: there is a divide: river systems thrown like winter tree-shadows against the hills: branches, runs, high lakes: stagnant lily-marshes: (Collected Poems 89-90) The poem inverts the usual Emersonian logic, which moves from fact to spirit. Instead, while positing an object of definition (the soul), it keeps all its attention on the apparent second term ("terrain") and its variety. The mutability of the landscape and its diurnal notations allow for a temporal consciousness to enter an essentially spatial figure, where Snyder reduces the temporal to the spatial. Ammons blends spatial traversings with the mind's temporal flow. The description shifts in and out of a focused perspective and shifts angles of vision yet remains in a present tense that suggests witness of a spectacle, the spectacle of the soul. This poem seems to me a model of postmodern landscape poetry, which must begin in abstraction and return to land- scape as the endless resource for the unfolding of that abstraction. Such is the practice of Ashbery. LANDSCAPE POETS I 421</page><page sequence="11">Ammons's "Gravelly Run" could almost be read as a narrative of Snyder's ambition and its failure. The proposed project of the imagination is the sloughing off of the self's enterprise, a yielding to the curves and rounds of external sensation, a surrender "to the vic- tory / of stones and trees." But he does not yield to this nostalgia. At the end of the poem the pilgrim truly "look[s] and reflect[s]," and he finds no reflexivity. The air, as Stevens said, "is not a mirror." Only later will Ammons discover in the air the "bare board" on which to project an analogous terrain of the mind. For now the air is a "glass / jail." Transparency, continuity, immanence, all such myths are undone by material sensation. "Hoist your burdens, get on down the road," he commands (Collected Poems 55-56). The road will lead ulti- mately to "For Harold Bloom," a sublime reworking of Stevens's "Anecdote of the Jar" and the figurative stance toward the landscape. But it repeatedly turns back toward the particular, and occasionally the poet mistakes the particular for his destination. In his best poems Ammons demonstrates the creative value of the alienated intelligence. He turns his burden to a levity with a truly happy tolerance between precept and particular. One of Ammons's most famous poems, "Corsons Inlet" (Collected Poems 149-51), is constructed on just such a rhetorical model of appo- sitional rather than organic or hierarchical relations between nature and mind. This "mirroring mind" is not mimetic so much as congruent, finding coordinates to match, not copy, the particulars of the land- scape. Though haunted by the mind's ambition to totalize, by the quest for scope, it does not submit "reality to precept," nor precept to reality. The particular does not so much illustrate precept as help to shape it. Like Snyder, Ammons celebrates process in mind and nature, but Ammons does not identify mental and organic process. The walk is a refreshment of form and, paradoxically, a heightening of the tem- porality of thought through the spatial openness of landscape. Figura- tiveness is less reduced than given free play in the poem. If the poem thematically "accepts the becoming," it does so at no cost to poetic invention. On the contrary, the witness to natural process coincides with the expansion of figurative range. While imagination and nature often coexist rather than compete for authority in Ammons, the subject of guilt still arises in his poetry. But the poem "Plunder" almost rejoices in its indictment. What the poet takes from nature does not diminish it, even while it augments the poet. The best Ammons poems give themselves to the activity of naming for the aura of consciousness, of significance, this activity 422 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="12">yields as reward. They are not in the least embarrassed by conscious- ness, or by the fictions it builds around things. The poem "City Limits" is a tour de force of naming, enraptured by its variety and inventive possibility. It begins: "When you consider the radiance, that it does not withhold / itself but pours its abundance without selection into every / nook and cranny not overhung or hidden" (Collected Poems 320). Indeed, the "radiance" the poem speaks of is almost identified with linguistic appropriation, which does not fence in but expands out. Fear turns to praise through the proliferation of names. "Air or vacuum, snow or shale, squid or wolf"- such nominal processions are common to American poetry, a humbling of significance to fact in Emerson, Frost, Moore. But in Ammons they are part of the expan- sion of poetic consciousness. The guilt here is released, not caused by the act of naming. Toward the end of the poem Ammons moves back from plurality toward unity, especially biological, cellular unity, but breadth is what turns fear to praise, and Ammons seems as indebted to the particulars which expand the possibilities of "radiance" as he is to the "radiance" for embracing and unifying the particulars. In "City Limits" Ammons discovers a truly happy relationship between par- ticulars and consciousness, in which approach neither imposes boundaries nor submits itself to the silent particular. In his recent volume A Coast of Trees, Ammons again bids rhetoric and the imagination venerate the particular. But the pilgrim figure here does not entirely give up the autonomy that language has given him. In one poem, "Strolls," a standoffishness and reasonable- ness are one with the generosity of the landscape. The title poem seems most directly to submit itself to an immanentist aesthetic, disdaining names, finding the Way in the particular. It is an example of the precept "his soil is man's intelligence." The reality is, though susceptible to versions, without denomination: when the fences foregather the reality they shut in is cast out: if the name nearest the name names least or names only a verge before the void takes naming in, how are we to find holiness, our engines of declaration put aside, helplessness our first offer and sacrifice, except that having given up all mechanisms of LANDSCAPE POETS 423</page><page sequence="13">approach, having accepted a shambles of non-enterprise, we know a unity approach divided, a composure past sight: then, with nothing, we turn to the cleared particular, not more nor less than itself, and we realize that whatever it is it is in the Way and the Way in it, as in us, emptied full.4 But the title itself is figurative in the most ambiguous way, not only in its suggestion of the one/many paradox in trees and forests. Cer- tainly the coast of trees suggests a New World Eden, such as Stevens's Crispin imagined free of "enterprise" and fully present so that approach becomes arrival. Like Snyder, Ammons seems the new American Adam. Yet if the trees are the figure of the particular, why should they need to be "cleared"? The trees may also suggest something of Baudelaire's forest of symbols, thus both cleared and preserved in the poem. If, as he says at the end of the poem, the particular is in the Way and the Way in it, the same may also be said of rhetoric, of names. This is delightfully clear in Ammons's latest volume, Sumerian Vistas, which by its very title puts language in the place of origins (ancient Sumer, the site of first writing). Here language is not so much part of nature (as in Snyder) as nature, or things observed in nature, are like language: "the odor of shit is like language" (12). We are reminded repeatedly that this poet is looking at nature not for itself but for what it can offer the imagination: "Bernie said he wasn't much interested / in nature but if we didn't have it we'd have to / think of something to take its place" (7). Within the constant probing for analogy is the strong sense of difference: if nature could speak would it have something to say right where it says nothing: that is, be like me, reticent, patient, waiting and slowly the progressions will find progressive gears (even now backsteppings are being wound forward) and the wind seek key other than the eaves-key: nature would say, 4A.

Even nature's "unintentionality"- the last nostalgia of losing oneself in a thing-in-itself-is revealed as a poet's trope: I go to nature not because its flowers and sunsets speak to me (though they do) or listen to me inquire but because I have filled it with unintentionality, so that I can miss anything personal in the roar of sunset, so that I can in beds of flowers hold no head up, too: (15) Here again Ammons contrasts the unifying, depersonalizing quality of nature to "one's own mercilessness, / inescapable as one's own intellect." But the contrast is framed in terms of human need, a function the imagination assigns to nature as its only place of appeal-a self-conscious pastoral. Two kinds of figurative conjunction dominate this volume. The first is "like," once the weak sister of "is," now the mark of honest humility. Simile is the postmodern surrender of the romantic and modern hubris of metaphor. Ammons's other, bolder conjunc- tion - also a sign of his postmodernism - is "of," the allegorical, pos- sessive preposition: in the small walks &amp; chasms of despair one seeks to find and pretends to build enledgments to plateaus of staying and view but these unfound, pretended become high lake surfaces of chagrin (31) LANDSCAPE POETS 425</page><page sequence="15">This is a peculiarly postmodern allegory that does not depend upon a unified set of second terms. Indeed, the biblical rhetoric so preva- lent in Ammons at first (and turned to natural piety in his middle period) is almost absent in this prebiblical, "sumerian" vision, with its relentless yet cheerful vision of entropy, death, and decay. Like Snyder and Ammons, Charles Wright has fastened his atten- tion to entropic nature. But while Snyder sees it as plenitude and Ammons as plural figurative ground, Wright sees it as the negative way of transcendence. While Ammons's enumerations accumulate, Wright's are subtractive. Charles Wright said he began by writing the poems of Walt Whitman in Emily Dickinson's room. But in recent books he has been trying to write like Emily Dickinson down Walt Whitman's road. The last to attempt either was Hart Crane, but Wright is really much closer to Dickinson and Whitman than to the more symbolist Crane. He shares Dickinson's preoccupation with "the other side," along with Whitman's ample vision of this side; he combines Dickinson's yearn- ing hermeticism and Whitman's anecdotal fluency. Wright's postscript to his selected early poems and the epigraph to China Trace, the last volume of his hermetic phase, expresses the desires and compensations which have led him through various stances toward the landscape: "I would like to house my spirit within my body, to nourish my virtue by mildness, and to travel in ether by becoming a void. But I cannot do it yet . . And so, being unable to find peace within myself, I made use of the external surroundings to calm my spirit, and being unable to find delight within my heart, I borrowed a landscape to please it. Therefore, strange were my travels." T'u Lung (T'u Ch'ihshui) Translated by Lin Yutang The landscape is not a home (his travels are strange) but a medi- tation of self and void. This has meant at first an emblematic style, but increasingly an immersion in surfaces for the hints of the infinite they yield. The temporal reach and decline of the emblem has taken on a horizontal temporality and an emphasis on memory. Indeed, if the spatial pre-empts the temporal in Snyder, if the temporal traverses the spatial in Ammons, the temporal overwhelms the spatial in Wright's images. 426 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="16">Wright's poetry clearly refuses the cure of the ground, the Eden of the body, even as it turns to landscape as a locus of imaginative action. He never collapses metaphysics into physics. Organic process may be the model of poetic process, but only as both are caught in an embodiment from which the soul seeks its freedom. The pilgrim in Wright pursues disappearances, not presences; beauty is derived not from nature's generous plenitude, not from things or motions, but from the shadows which haunt it and the lights which penetrate it. But Wright refuses as well the mystic's cure. The world's body and his own body remain the essential context of his vision. If the image is agonistic and the ideal unreifiable, the real may be transformed by desire, the mother of figuration. The volume Bloodlines is particularly concerned with surfaces, memories, emblems which retain traces of a remote ideal. Each poem in the sonnet sequence "Skins," for instance, traces embodiment, release, and recline into surfaces. This progress has been read by Charles Altieri as the failure of transcendence and a descent to aestheti- cism and pastoral loss (Self and Sensibility 158). But we should read the sequence within a Dickinsonian countersublime rather than an Emersonian sublime - measure it not by the confirmation of being in the infinite but by the alienation of beingfrom the infinite. "Skins 2," for instance, describes a chiasmic structure in which the idea of the infinite expands in proportion to the defeat of embodiment. Yet rep- resentation remains the only condition of consciousness. In the brushstroke that holds the angel's wing Back from perfection; in The synapse of word to word; in the one note That would strike the infinite ear And save you; and in That last leap, the sure and redeeming edge ... In all beauty there lies Something inhuman, something you can't know: In the pith and marrow of every root Of every bloom; in the blood-seam Of every rock; in the black lung of every cloud The seed, the infinitesimal seed That dooms you, that makes you nothing, Feeds on its self-containment and grows big.5 5Charles Wright, "Skins 2."

Yet the first four lines of the poem include images of representation: brushstroke, word, note. The inhuman element enters through these aesthetic surfaces. Thus the artistic imagination retains an authority beyond its scope through a metaphoric last leap, though not a redeeming one. Only after these images of representational beauty does the poem proceed to images of natural or supernatural beauty. The self's doom, then, is a byproduct of art, its "seed" infects nature (not vice versa, as in Snyder). In poetry, in metaphor, he can "disappear / Through the upper right-hand corner of things" (Country Music 141). The volume China Trace begins a fuller engagement with land- scape as the medium of the poet's longing. Where "Skins" tended to explore the vertical, agonistic structure of the emblem, these poems pursue the gradual divestment of being in time. So "April," the season of renewal and growth, inspires the longing to be "water / Pooled in the black leaves and holding me there, to be / Released as a glint, as a flash, as a spark" (Country Music 143). Fugitive, twilight phe- nomena (rather than large ecological structures or opaque particulars) attract the poet's attention: "Slowly a leaf unlocks itself from a branch. / Slowly the furred hands of the dead flutter up from their caves. / A little pinkish flame is snuffed in my mouth" (Country Music 130). Nature's ephemerality leads to an apprehension of "the other side," but utterance remains bound to that earthly temporality, is indeed silenced by the very waft of vision that evoked it. Denied access to the dead, such haunted beauty is "the poor man's pick purse" and "the rich man's cutthroat"- an image of stolen pleasures, glimpses, or a terrible sign of being cut off from the absolute. In his last two books and in recent work, Wright has turned more fully onto the horizontal of Whitman's road, to a less metaphoric, more descriptive and narrative record of vision. He has removed the particular from its hermetic cloak and focused on the apprehension of the infinite within the finite rather than on his failure to achieve mystic absorption into the infinite. It is still a landscape characterized by desire, and more than ever by an elegiac beauty: all beauty depends upon disappearance, The bitten edges of things, the gradual sliding away Into tissue and memory, the uncertainty 428 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="18">And dazzling impermanence of days we beg our meanings from, And their frayed loveliness. (River 15) But memory provides experiences of spontaneous joy and linkage out of which the imagination finds its sustenance. The later poems are constructed as a series of discontinuous descriptive/narrative episodes, hardly delightful in themselves (cripples, car accidents, murders are the common fare). But these are reclaimed and transformed as they are identified with place in fleeting experi- ences of memory. (He is consistent with Country Music's epigraph from Hemingway, which claims: "The country was always better than the people.") Wright is fascinated in particular by the inversions in the continuum that memory creates, the rearview mirror effect, a horizontal chiasmus to match the vertical one of "Skins." The spatiality of landscape particularly invites this effect, its vanishing points sug- gesting the absorption of experience into the past, but also the mind's pursuit of it. Here is the end of the poem "Lonesome Pine Special" from The Other Side of the River: A logging road from the early part of the century, Overgrown and barely detectable. I'd like it to be in North Carolina, in Henderson County Between Mt. Pinnacle and Mt. Anne, An old spur off the main track The wagons and trucks hauled out on. Blackberry brambles, and wild raspberry and poison ivy Everywhere; grown trees between the faint ruts; Deadfall and windfall and velvety sassafras fans On both sides ... It dips downhill and I follow it. It dips down and it disappears and I follow it. (River 18) This vision of a highly specified yet haunted landscape suggests a stance toward the particular and a rhetorical model antithetical to Snyder's. Poetic knowledge exists not in the plenitude of the image but, as Wright says in the poem "California Dreaming," "on the far side of the simile" (71). Figuration is a kind of glimpse of the other side, through infinite regressions, "the like that's like the like." The LANDSCAPE POETS I 429</page><page sequence="19">poet's lament is that "nothing rises more than halfway out of itself" (23), that the landscape will not yield to metaphor. Indeed, the suffi- ciency of the generative world is the terrible reduction to the imma- nentist's dream: 25 years ago I used to sit on this jut of rocks As the sun went down like an offering through the glaze And backfires of Monterey Bay, And anything I could think of was mine because it was there in front of me, numinously everywhere, Appearing and piling up ... So to have to come to this, remembering what I did do, and what I didn't do, The gulls whimpering over the boathouse, the monarch butterflies Cruising the flower beds, And all the soft hairs of spring thrusting up through the wind, And the sun, as it always does, dropping into its slot without a click, Is a short life of trouble. (River 25-26) If surfaces must be narrowed rather than expanded (as in Ammons) to let in the infinite, they remain essential to Wright's poetry. "Radiance comes through the eye / and lodges like cut glass in the mind," he says (51), and the luminous, transfigured world of the imagi- nation "in back of the eye" is only approachable through the medium of things seen. It is in this sense, I think, that he calls himself a "nominal pantheist." In his most recent volume, Zone Journals,6 Wright has immersed himself even further in landscape, pursuing the elusive zero zone within the more defined zones of place and time-"Yard Journal," "The Journal of English Days," "March Journal." As the volume proceeds, these grounded zones become less prominent and more abstract, but they are never relinquished. Indeed, the journal format itself repre- sents a paradoxical plunge into mutability (the landscape a palimpsest) in pursuit of an absolute. In this version erasure is discovery, stillness. is known by movement. Images of shredding, paring, and skimming are more prominent than ever: 6Excerpts from Zone Journals, by Charles Wright (copyright ?1987 by Charles Wright) are reprinted by permission of Farrar, Straus and Giroux, Inc. 430 1 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="20">-November pares us like green apples, circling under our skins In long, unbroken spirals until We are sweet flesh for the elements surprised by the wind's shear Curling down from the north of Wales (13) The volume begins on the assumption that -Exclusion's the secret: what's missing is what appears Most visible to the eye: the more luminous anything is, The more it subtracts what's around it, Peeling away the burned skin of the world making the unseen seen. (4) More than Snyder or Ammons, Wright defines nature as landscape, as an aesthetic order which expresses something. Terms of art and artists are prominent in Zone Journals. -Blue jay's bound like a kangaroo's in the lawn's high grass, Then up in a brushstroke and over the hedge in one arc. Light weights down the azalea plants, Yesterday's cloud banks enfrescoed still just under the sky's cornice, Cardinal quick transfusion into the green arm of the afternoon. (4) Such conceptions of nature as landscape preclude Snyder's ideal of primal vision. For Wright, the search for elemental, material truth is continually defeated by the abstract nature of language and mind: How sweet to think that Nature is solvency, that something empirically true Lies just under the dead leaves That will make us anchorites in the dark Chambers of some celestial perpetuity- nice to think that, Given the bleak alternative, Though it hasn't proved so before, and won't now LANDSCAPE POETS I 431</page><page sequence="21">No matter what things we scrape aside - God is an abstract noun. (17) This journal, then, resists the kind of assumption the form traditionally affirms. The details of experience (anecdotally recorded), the facts of observation (descriptively recorded) make no epistemological or spiri- tual claims of their own. They are presented to register the desire for a truth they can never disclose. Wordsworth and Emerson looked on the landscape with a double vision in which the spectacle of particulars yielded to a visionary glory. One legacy of modernism, especially from Eliot and Yeats, has been the alienation from those particulars, a longing for aesthetic, symbolist, mythic purity, and a psychologizing of vision. But American mod- ernists (Frost, Williams, Moore) retained, indeed heightened, the authority of external particulars and subjected the visionary glory to a great deal of scrutiny and skepticism. The happy continuities of romanticism become, in modernism, radical paradoxes and dualities. Contemporary poetry has inherited the instability of this double vision and has sometimes resisted it by a nostalgia for the earth. But Snyder, Ammons, and Wright have all entered this instability vigorously at times, whether their aim was to end it (as in the case of Snyder), exploit it (as in the case of Ammons), or know and endure it (as in the case of Wright). One function of the poetry of our time (a function served by a variety of aesthetics) is to find a rhetoric in which description and abstraction are openly reciprocal, in which poetic authority thrives on an attachment to soil, artifice on realism, in which percept is not the master or object of thought but the source of its renewal.
