London and New York: Routledge, 2007. isbn 978 ο 415 28915 3. Paper £17-99· Here is a useful addition to a good series. A brief curriculum vitae of the contentious bishop of Alexandria and an outline of his thought introduce a varied selection of sufficiently annotated texts in translation. Englished here from the original Greek are the complete sermon 'On the mystical Supper' preserved under the name of Cyril of Alexandria and a few short passages likewise extant in Greek; from the Latin versions by Jerome a couple of Festal Letters; and from the Coptic tradition two homilies. The passages fall under three heads: homilies, ecclesiastical legislation, and the Origenist controversy. Best known are the last-named passages and therefore specially welcome are the pieces dealing with pastoral measures; a valuable insight into Theophilus' understanding of the person and work of Christ is also conveyed in the sermon and in other extracts. Norman Russell does well to offer a more sympathetic interpretation of his subject's controversial acts than usual, but it is hard to work against the grain of the Constantinopolitan detractors whose versions of events got into the church histories. So far as the dishing of Gregory Nazianzen and John Chrysostom is concerned, there is at least a case for saying that both were incompetent holders of episcopal office and that it was an act of fraternal charity by the see of St Mark to ensure that the people of Constantinople were no longer encumbered with clergy whose imprudent behaviour threatened the Church as a whole. If Norman Russell does not explain what the 'anthropomorphism' involved in the confrontation with 'Origenism' consisted of, he does show that Theophilus was not a muddled hypocrite. He presents the picture of a principled thinker and a diligent and effective bishop. That seems to me to ring true. doi:10.1093/jts/flm069doi:10.1093/jts/flm069 L. R.
