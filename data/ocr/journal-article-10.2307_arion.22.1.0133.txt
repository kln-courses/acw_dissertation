<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Classics at the Dawn of the Museum Era: The Life and Times of Antoine Chrysostome Quatremère  De Quincy (1755–1849) LOUIS A. RUPRECHT, JR. It is therefore difficult, if not impossible, for someone not resident in Rome to write anything substantial about ancient art or obscure antiquities; even a few years in Rome is insufficient, as I myself have learned despite laborious preparation. It is not surprising when some- one says that he can find no unknown inscriptions in Italy: . . . one must know how to seek them out, and a traveler will find them only with difficulty. —Winckelmann, History of the Art of Antiquity, Preface Such was the effect, such was the fate of antiquity in the period I describe, when I visited Rome for the first time. Everything about this magical city contributed to entice my passion for antiquity and to enhance the beautiful illusions that enable us to recover the past and give it reality in the present, this radiance with which the imag- ination supplies the centuries that are long past. . . .  Such was the effect, almost a kind of magic, produced by Winck- elmann’s genius as well as by the spectacle of Roman antiquity. But this effect, it must be said, could only be produced in Rome, and by Rome. In vain do we convince ourselves that the antiquities taken from that city today can preserve their virtue. Everywhere else they are sterile, since everywhere else they lack the power deriving from their place; everywhere else they are disenchanted. They become images for which there is no mirror. —Quatremère de Quincy, Le Jupiter Olympien, Avant Propos  introduction two years ago, I published a book in which I laid out the primarily archival evidence that confirmed Johann Joachim Winckelmann’s (1717–1768) critical role in the creation of the Vatican’s first fully public Classical art museum.1Winck- elmann had achieved widespread fame first as a pamphlet- eer; his Reflections on the Imitation of Greek Artworks in Painting and Sculpture was published to great acclaim in arion 22.1 spring/summer 2014 </page> <page sequence="2"> 134 classics at the dawn of the museum era 1755. He is also commonly recalled as the “father” of mod- ern Art History; his History of the Art of Antiquity was pub- lished in 1764. Both books were designed to steer European aesthetics in the direction of Neoclassicism, and away from what he deemed Baroque “bad taste.”2 Winckelmann moved to Rome in the same year that his Reflections were published, and later secured the patronage of the most fa- mous art collector in Europe, Cardinal Alessandro Albani (1692–1779), who was appointed by Pope Clement xiii to be the Vatican’s Cardinal Librarian in 1761. Winckelmann was nominated as Papal Antiquarian in 1763,3 and at that same time, the Bibliotecario Albani arranged a position for him at the Vatican Library. Together, the two men curated the Vatican’s first “Profane Museum,” a small collection that opened inside the Apostolic Palace in 1767. Clearly, we are in the presence of some subtle and complicated refash- ioning of the religious landscape of Early Modern Europe.  Winckelmann was murdered in Trieste just one year after the Museo Profano was opened to public viewing, but his Neoclassical vision had by then been well established; Al- bani had helped see to that. And yet, in order to justify the public display of statues of pagan gods and goddesses, most of them rendered in the nude, and all of them housed inside the Apostolic Palace, it was essential to shift the way in which such objects were seen. Winckelmann, so I argue, ar- ticulated this seismic shift in spiritual perception whereby “pagan idols” rapidly came to be viewed as premier exam- ples of “fine art.” Albani, in his capacity as Cardinal Librarian, continued to work on the northern wing of the Apostolic Palace—over- seeing the construction of large new rooms like the Rotonda, the Greek Cross, the Muses, and the Octagonal Cortile— which house many of the Vatican’s most important Greek and Roman statuary to this day. This new Vatican Museum was completed at sometime around 1792, when the first bilingual guide to the Vatican Museum (in French and Ital- ian) was published.4 Just four years later, Napoleon, who </page> <page sequence="3"> Louis A. Ruprecht, Jr. 135 was then leading the Revolutionary French forces in their northern Italian campaigns, made the expropriation of one hundred works of art a condition of the peace (first at the Armistice of Bologna, 23 June 1796, and later in the Treaty of Tolentino, 19 February 1797) that the Papal States were forced to sign.5 The temporary transfer of the Apollo Belvedere, the Laocoön Group, the Belvedere Torso, the Belvedere Hermes/Antinous and the rest served to transform the Louvre into the preeminent European museum for nearly twenty years. In that same year, however, an aspiring young French classicist, Antoine Chrysostome Quatremère de Quincy (1755–1849), published a series of seven open letters that condemned the French looting of the Vatican as an act incompatible with the values of the Revolution, and more in line with the imperialism of the old order. Quatremère’s Let- ters to [General] Miranda won him an enthused following among radicalized artists in Paris, even as it won him the ire of more reactionary elements in the regime. His Revolution- ary fortunes, like those of many another moderate in those unsettled times, soured after 1793. He stepped down from the Pantheon project in March of 1794 when a warrant was issued for his arrest on March 2nd, and he appears to have been imprisoned in Les Magdelonnettes in April or May. Several delightful vignettes have come down to us, suggest- ing that he used his time to return to his first love, sculpture, creating clay models in his cell. He was released in the gen- eral amnesty of 27 July 1794, but then was sentenced to death in absentia after the Vendémiaire uprising (5 October 1795) that he had supported. He escaped to exile in Ger- many (at Holstein, where he stayed with the philosopher, Ja- cobi), then returned to Paris once again under the general amnesty of 9 November 1799.6 He eventually joined the French Academies he had a hand in reforming in the early years of the Revolution, where he enjoyed a prolific career of producing lectures and scholarly publications until his re- tirement in the early 1830s. He was appointed to the French Institute’s Classe de l’Histoire in 1804 after which he began </page> <page sequence="4"> 136 classics at the dawn of the museum era publishing what were to be his most important scholarly works, such as Le Jupiter Olympien. The year after that text’s publication, he was nominated to be Permanent Secre- tary of the Académie des Beaux-Arts (that was in 1816; he served through 1839).7 Also in 1816, the Classe d’Histoire became the Académie des inscriptions et belles-lettres, the primary state-sponsored Academy to which he would devote his energy and care. Quatremère has been unfairly remembered as “the French Winckelmann,” a charge that sticks in the English-speaking world primarily because so little of his work has ever been translated. Admittedly, the term, “le Winckelmann française,” also appears in René Schneider’s foundational 1910 study, L’Esthétique classique chez Quatremère de Quincy (1805–1823), but as an opinion falsely held by some of his contemporaries. For Schneider, “Winckelmann was, in his time, the great reformer of taste in Europe and the cre- ator of Art History: but that time had passed . . . Qua- tremère is far too superficially made into his stand-in.”8 In Schneider’s view, Quatremère was far more an activist and interventionist than he was a staid classical scholar: “The truth is that this vigorous athlete, as powerful in thought as he was in action, organized the ideal-antique school (l’école idéalo-antique) in 1791, carried the battle forward from 1816 to 1830, then fought a rearguard action from 1830 to 1839.”9 Such a description alone might well make him a person of singular contemporary interest. In fact, Quatremère was the premier Art Historian and Classicist of his generation. While there is a relatively large body of biographical and analytic work on Quatremère in French,10 studies in English have been more rare and diffi- cult to access. The two finest sources of biographical infor- mation for his early scholarly formation are both unpublished doctoral dissertations: Eric Rauth’s “The Work of Memory: Ekphrasis, Museums and Memorialism in Keats, Quatremère de Quincy, Balzac and Flaubert” (Prince- ton University, 1990); and Thomas F. Rowlands’s impressive </page> <page sequence="5"> Louis A. Ruprecht, Jr. 137 four-volume “Quatremère de Quincy: The Formative Years, 1785–1795” (Northwestern University, 1987).11 And Sylvia Lavin’s marvelous 1992 study, Quatremère de Quincy and the Invention of a Modern Language of Architecture, does an excellent job of explaining why architecture figured so prominently in Quatremère’s writings, both early and late, and how novel was his overarching theory that architecture might be meaningfully compared to human language, since both were conventional, socially embedded, and the product of human artifice.12 Quatremère shows us not what apish imitation of Wincklemann’s Neoclassicism looked like in the nineteenth century, but rather what these two overlapping disciplines had become in the generation after Winckel- mann. In my view, Quatremère was formed by three crucial developments that Winckelmann did not, and could not, know: the French Revolution and its chaotic aftermath; the combined academic and cultural influence of Hegelian (or perhaps we should simply say German Idealist)13 aesthetics; and the establishment of the museum era in Europe.  Quatremère also remained committed both to his Roman Catholicism and to the secular values of the early Revolution; this was not easily done, and in this he is very different than Winckelmann, who converted to Catholicism just before mov- ing to Rome, and who was, according to many who claimed to understand him best, really a “closeted pagan” if he possessed any significant religious sensibilities at all.14 Art and beauty were Winckelmann’s primary religious categories. Qua- tremère, by contrast, wrote eloquently and with deep insight concerning his understanding of the compatibilities between the Classical and Christian vision, an issue that does not really figure in Winckelmann’s more intentionally “profane” mus- ings. I hope to show that Quatremère’s true importance emerges only if we situate him in his own times, one genera- tion afterWinckelmann, in a very different, a far more revolu- tionary, and a far more religiously complex cultural moment. Recent work on Quatremère tends to be unreliable pre- cisely to the degree that it aims to fit him into someone else’s </page> <page sequence="6"> 138 classics at the dawn of the museum era story. So he is often taken to be a conservative, as opposed to Jacques-Louis David’s (1748–1825) aesthetic radicalism; I think we might see David more as a left totalitarian and self- promoter, one who later worked against his former friend and collaborator.15 Or he is deemed a French Orientalist16 whose views are, as such, entirely outmoded; in fact, his views of Egypt and the Greek east are far more nuanced and complex. Moreover, Quatremère’s prejudices are obvious, as Hegel’s were. And so, rather than beat a dead horse, I read both Hegel and Quatremère as significant theorists for whom such attitudes were not methodologically crucial. In this essay, I hope to show that Quatremère is a far more in- teresting character than such reductive accounts of his life and writings allow.  I first came upon the name of Quatremère de Quincy (hereafter Quatremère) while conducting research on the discovery and subsequent publication of the marbles from the Temple of Aphaia on the Greek island of Aegina, mar- bles housed now in the Glypotothek Museum in Munich.17 The Art Historical Report about that collection—commis- sioned by Crown Prince Ludwig of Bavaria (1786–1868), composed by Johann Martin Wagner (1777–1858), and ed- ited by Friedrich W. J. Schelling (1775–1854)—offers a fas- cinating glimpse into the state of classical and art-historical scholarship in the early nineteenth century.18 Hardly a household name today, even among classicists, Quatremère was a significant presence in Wagner’s and Schelling’s notes, especially praised for his imaginative reconstruction of Phei- dias’s two enormous chryselephantine statues of Athena and Zeus, housed in Athens and Olympia respectively. That 1815 opus became the work on polychrome Greek sculp- ture, for generations.19 Remarkably, that work has never been translated into English; precious few of Quatremère’s books have been. He appears to have been better known among Italian- and Ger- man-speaking scholars, as well as his large Francophone readership, than he was among English-speakers in his own </page> <page sequence="7"> Louis A. Ruprecht, Jr. 139 times, despite the fact that Quatremère was writing in the scholarly lingua franca (literally) of the day. Scholars all re- lied on translations, of course, even the most multilingual and cosmopolitan among them; Quatremère himself did as well. He makes closest use of Winckelmann’s 1764 opus, the History of the Art of Antiquity, though he seems to know it in the Italian translation by Carlo Fea (cited as Storia delle Arti del Disegno) and in the French translation by d’Hubert (cited as Histoire de l’Art), but not in the German original.20 Prior to his death in 1849, in any case, only three of Qua- tremère’s twenty-three books had found English translators, none of them what are today deemed to be the most impor- tant of his works. Quatremère published important pam- phlets, position-papers, and promotions for public works in the early years of the French Revolution; he published im- portant scholarly tools, like architectural dictionaries and art-historical encyclopedia; he published important book- length studies of Michelangelo, Raphael and Canova; he published two significant forays into theoretical aesthetics; and he published an impressive range of Classical studies that brilliantly combined his literary and visual and archae- ological interests. English translations never succeeded in re- flecting Quatremère’s unusual scholarly range, nor its creativity and importance. The Destination of Works of Art and the Use to Which They Are Applied was translated by H. Thompson in 1821 (it was originally published in French in 1815);21 his Essay on the Nature, the End and the Means of Imitation in the Fine Arts was translated in 1837 (it was originally published in French in 1823);22 and William Haz- litt translated his “Life of Raphael” in 1846 as one of two important essays published with the collective title, Lives of the Italian Painters (the original 1824 edition was revised and reissued in French in 1833).23 As I say, all scholars rely on translations. In Quatremère’s case, it is significant to note that three of his works were translated into English in the nineteenth century, whereas not a single one of his works was translated into English in the </page> <page sequence="8"> 140 classics at the dawn of the museum era twentieth.24 It may well be that the absence of any twentieth- century translations of Quatremère’s impressive oeuvre into English has contributed to his relative anonymity. This, too, may be about to change. Two of his most unusual (and per- haps most influential) books, both originally conceived as se- ries of public letters, have recently been translated into English: the seven letters he penned concerning the French looting of the Vatican Museum in 1796; and the seven letters he directed to Antonio Canova (1757–1822), the famous Ve- netian sculptor, in 1818 concerning the so-called Elgin Mar- bles that had recently been removed from Athens and reinstalled in London.25 By placing these two very different books together, the editors have elected to highlight the cen- tral irony that appears to separate them conceptually: Qua- tremère first announced himself as the emphatic opponent of art-historical looting in Rome, and an opponent to the forth- coming expansion of the Musée Napoléon, in his celebrated Letters to Miranda; yet later he announced his deep appreci- ation for the results of some similar-seeming British spolia- tion in Greece, and he became an enthusiastic proponent of the new form taken by the British Museum in London. The juxtaposition of the two books in this way also sug- gests that the central irony of Quatremère’s career is that the young radical becomes a figure of the ruling establishment in older age, but that would be a gross overstatement of the case.26 What I think is lost in the perfectly understandable contemporary concern for provenance, patria and repatria- tion, are the central religious paradoxes that animated Winck- elmann’s antiquarianism as well as his museums, inspiring a form of spirituality to which Quatremère may be viewed as an especially eloquent and important apostolic heir. One might go still further: the decision by the Getty Foundation to pub- lish these two books together may speak as well to its own concerns with the contemporary pressing of repatriation claims worldwide, claims to which the Getty Museum has been singularly susceptible, and nowhere more so than in Italy.27 The new Director of the Getty Museum, James Cuno, </page> <page sequence="9"> Louis A. Ruprecht, Jr. 141 has been an impassioned critic of the new nationalism that he sees lying at the heart of most such repatriation claims,28 hence the publication of material from the heyday of imperial looting that nonetheless paints a more complicated picture of the matter seems both timely and relevant. While I find many of Cuno’s arguments compelling—and it is certainly the case that modern archaeology was at least as implicated in modern nationalisms as modern art museums were—I suspect that the availability of this new text to an English-speaking audience already consumed by the ethical and political dimension of repatriation questions may actually distract us from the broader range of Quatremère’s interests and the profound re- ligious speculations that characterized so much of his work. The religious implications of modern museums and their “profane” forms of display were much clearer in his day than in ours, since the twinned revolutions embodied in Winckel- mann’s Neoclassicism and the museums spawned by that new aesthetic vision were relatively new and not yet fully justified in the popular mind. the new rhetoric of religion religion was, more often than not, the question within the question in each of the three emerging modern disciplines with which Winckelmann and Quatremère were involved: Classics, Art History, and Social or Political Theory. What would it mean to take Greek religion seriously as religion? What was at stake in considering something to be “art” rather than to be “religion”? These questions were central to Winckelmann’s rhetorical performances. And what was to be the fate of the Christian religion in the revolutionary, and increasingly secular, modern western world? This question would present a recurrent set of challenges for Quatremère, who lived through a highly complex set of religious changes in Revolutionary and post-Revolutionary France.  Quatremère’s story really begins in Rome and that city al- ways remained his lodestar. He took his Grand Tour with </page> <page sequence="10"> 142 classics at the dawn of the museum era money inherited upon his mother’s death; he remained in Italy for more than three years (1776–1780), and returned to Italy for six months once again in 1783. Fortuitously enough, Quatremère had struck up a close friendship with Jacques-Louis David (1748–1825) while in Naples,29 and under his tutelage, Quatremère committed himself to the promotion of Neohellenic ideals. David won the Premier Grand Prix de Rome from the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture, which enabled him to spend five years (1774–1779) in Italy. The Neapolitan trip generated a “spir- itual crisis” in him and a shift in painterly vision that in- spired his finest work. The two men returned to Paris together in 1780. Provided with a studio at the Louvre, David painted his “Belisarius” and “The Death of Hector,” winning immediate notice at the Royal Academy and its Sa- lons. Lesser known, Quatremère patiently pressed on with his antiquarian studies. The two returned to Rome together two years later, and it was then, in 1783, that Quatremère met a second visual artist who was to have an even greater impact on his thinking and on his professional career: Anto- nio Canova. Quatremère was so inspired by Canova’s sculp- tural group depicting “Theseus Conquering the Minotaur” that he described its effect on him as one of personal revela- tion; he was only 26 years of age, but the piece would help give form to the rest of his professional career. He would ul- timately devote more attention and care to Canova’s serene Neoclassical sculptures than he would to David’s ambitious Revolutionary painting; he and Canova would grow ever more intimate through the course of a correspondence that lasted for 40 years,30 as his encomiastic book devoted to Canova makes very plain. After returning from his Italian Tours, Quatremère en- joyed his first success in Paris in 1785 when he won the Prix de Caylus for his submission to an essay contest at the Royal Academy on the question of the Egyptian roots of Greek ar- chitecture.31 He was subsequently invited by the editor, Pan- coucke, to contribute several volumes on Architecture for </page> <page sequence="11"> Louis A. Ruprecht, Jr. 143 the ever-expanding Encyclopedia initiated by d’Alembert and Diderot; two volumes appeared in 1788 though this project was not to be completed until 1832. Quatremère was in London studying Sir Christopher Wren’s Saint Paul Cathedral when the Revolution broke out in Paris; he re- turned immediately and lent his services to the cause. He served in many capacities in those early, tumultuous years: he was nominated as a representative of the Assemblée des Représentants de la Commune de Paris (District of Pères de Nazareth), as Commissioner for the restoration of the dam- aged Archives at the Place de la Bastille; and as a minister of Public Instruction and Public Works under the Directorate; he served as a delegate and secretary to the National Assem- bly, with extensive work on several important committees, such as the Jury for the 1792 Louvre Salon, and the chief or- ganizer of the Fête de la loi on 3 June 1792;32 most signifi- cantly, he was appointed to be Director General of the project to convert the Église de Ste-Geneviève into that sig- nificant secular monument, the Panthéon français.33 While Quatremère was comfortable with the reigning idea that “the Patrie is a new divinity for a free people,” and that “this new religion” was political, moral and universal, he was generally opposed to the destruction of Christian mon- uments to make room for the thing; he preferred that they be carefully removed to another location. Already at age 40, then, he insisted on the essential compatibility between the new civic religion of the Revolutionary Republic and the tra- ditional Christian edifice he had been commissioned to adapt to its new secular purpose.34 In 1791, Quatremère entered into the furious debates about the future of the system of state patronage embodied in institutions like the Louvre Salons and the French Acade- mies in Paris and in Rome. Splitting the difference between more radical colleagues, like David, who argued for the wholesale dismantling of the current institutions, and the voices of aristocratic privilege, which essentially sought to defend and maintain the old regime, he published his “Con- </page> <page sequence="12"> 144 classics at the dawn of the museum era siderations on the Arts of Design in France.”35 His central premise throughout this period was striking; namely, that the artistic freedom to exhibit was morally equivalent to the freedom of the press: Equal rights, which is the foundation of the Constitution, allows all citizens to express their thoughts; this legal equality ought to al- low all artists to exhibit their works. Their paintings are their thoughts (son tableau, c’est sa pensée), and their public exhibition is the equivalent of their right to publish. The Louvre Salon is the press for painting, so long as decency and public order are re- spected.36 He had already given an important public address to the Assembly on 2 April 1790 in defense of the necessary free- dom of the Parisian theaters,37 and he returned to this ques- tion of fidelity to the sacred principles of the Revolution and the Rights of Man in his 1796 Letters to Miranda.  You know that the arts and sciences have long formed a republic in Europe whose members are bound to each other by mutual love and the quest for truth and beauty; this is their social pact and rather than isolating themselves from their own nations they tend to conciliate such national interests from the invaluable perspective of universal brotherhood. . . . The dissemination of enlightenment has rendered Europe a great service; no nation can any longer suf- fer the humiliation of being denominated barbaric by another; in- stead, across all these countries there is a community of instruction and erudition and an equality of taste, knowledge and industry. . . . it is as a member of the general republic of the arts and sciences and not as an inhabitant of this or that nation that I will discuss the in- terest that all parties share in the conservation of everything.38 Such aesthetic culture (and the moral cultivation it re- quires) is, Quatremère insists, a European achievement and a universal human legacy, hence the importance of universal standards of justice as embodied in international law and the so-called Rights of Man. Rome was the singular capital of that “republic of letters,” as it had been already for Mon- taigne centuries earlier, when he praised Rome as the most </page> <page sequence="13"> Louis A. Ruprecht, Jr. 145 cosmopolitan city on earth. This claim inspired Quatremère to one of his more rousing, and apocalyptic conclusions: See Rome stripped completely bare in this way, her ancient ruins buried under modern debris, and then witness Europe descending again into the dark night of bad taste and barbarism, covered anew in a veil of error and ignorance!39 The moral and spiritual matters implicated in the culture of the modern museum, as well as the political question of what belongs where, will never be far from Quatremère’s subsequent meditations. Aptly conceived as a mouseion, “a shrine to the Muse,” museums were designed to move and to inspire—and so they did. The British Museum provided Quatremère with his first week-long experience of work produced, he believed, by Pheidias’s own hand, worked linked now to his own. For there can be no doubt. We touch, we gaze upon, the marbles that Pericles and Plato saw, possibly worked by the chisel of Agar- ocrites or Alcamenes, and quite possibly retouched by Pheidias himself. These are the remains of one of the most celebrated tem- ples of antiquity, built in Athens’s most beautiful century, constitut- ing one of the true masterpieces of art. These remains are graced with a beauty that blooms ever new and that, according to Plutarch, seemed to grow younger with the passing years.  Hence the special value attaching to the spectacle of these works derives from a multitude of feelings and accessory considerations such as no other collection of antiquities can inspire.40 Such a reaction caused many sensitive readers to question the consistency of such encomia with his earlier concerns about French spoliation. With these few words—and with this reminder concerning the many treasures held in the British Museum about which I have said nothing—my sole purpose is to let you know what I think and what indeed anyone is bound to think of this collection. So let me tell you that, containing as it does the largest number of original </page> <page sequence="14"> 146 classics at the dawn of the museum era pieces of sculpture from the most beautiful period in Greece, it must now stand at the forefront of all collections: the one to which science and art history will turn for classical models and the most authentic ancient materials.41 It is as if this new London Museum (and by possible im- plication, the Parisian Museum in which he had worked for so long), had succeeded in capturing and extending the sa- cred spirit of the museum, the spirit that had been born in Rome under the star of Winckelmann: Modern Rome had never ceased to produce zealous antiquarians . . . Pope Benedict xiv, in the grand collection of antiquities on the Capitoline, had prepared the way to which the modern arts would, sooner or later, return. But these arts had begun to need further nourishment. It was left to Winckelmann to provide the final impulse toward the renewal of ancient taste in his History of Art, composed at roughly the same time, and with access to, the materials assembled in the Villa Albani, conceived by the Cardinal of that name. Thus Rome was to erect in honor of ancient art, a new monument that would exert a singular influence. In 1773, Pope Clement xiv established at the Vatican and began to erect a magnificent Museum, destined to collect in one place the dispersed examples of ancient sculpture . . . .42 Central to what Quatremère came to appreciate—quite in- dependently of the important political questions of spolia- tion and the practical questions of proper restitution—was the manner in which museums served as a bulwark to save the culture of humanity from the inevitable losses due to the vagaries of flux and change. In his reflections on Raphael, he concluded with words that take on a particular resonance in the museum-city with which he first fell in love (Rome), and the Museum that first stole his heart (in the Apostolic Palace), enabling him to gaze at his leisure at the transformative spiritual vision of that great Renaissance master with its subtle play of color and form, aimed at rejuvenating religious insight. </page> <page sequence="15"> Louis A. Ruprecht, Jr. 147 Everything that lives, everything in nature, is reproduced: the seasons, years, generations, societies, empires follow one another; genius alone has no successor, and centuries may pass ere a painter will appear who can be compared with, much less opposed to Raf- faello.43 Empires and museums follow one another. Such effusive words in praise of the Vatican and British Museums stand in the very sharpest contrast to the polemic he issued against the emerging museum culture of Paris in a series of lectures at the Academy in 1807, lectures he later published in 1815.  This text, Moral Considerations on the Destination of Works of Art, is surely his most passionately argued book, and in some ways it is his most eloquent. He appears to have come to the conclusion that the emerging museum culture in loot-laden Paris was stultifying to the promotion of a more vibrant culture of visual arts. One is convinced that the secret to making the arts flourish con- sists in the virtue of those vast assemblages of works of art one calls Collections, Cabinets, or Museum. All the nations are currently consumed with competitive envy about them. But here is the re- markable thing: the distinction between masterworks and models is blurred here . . . and no museum ever made an artist. . . . Does one not see that Constantinople came into possession of the collections from the Palace of Lausus and the Gymnasium of Zeuxippus, with- out these beautiful examples of Greek works inspiring the birth of a single Byzantine artist? Did ancient Rome not have in succession the Porticoes of Octavian, the galleries of the Golden House and the Temple of Peace? And yet history has not preserved the name of a single Roman sculptor.44 The reasons for such artistic sterility are not far to find. In a word, works of art displayed in museums have been re- moved from their original contexts. Quatremère juxtaposed the words “displacement” and “dismemberment” to great effect already in his Letters to Miranda. The moral urgency of that connection is intensified when the context in ques- tion was essentially a religious one by design. </page> <page sequence="16"> 148 classics at the dawn of the museum era How many monuments are now stripped of virtue due to their displacement! How many works have lost their real value in losing their use! How many objects are viewed with indifference because they no longer interest the curious onlooker! These are the curren- cies no longer valued but by savants. Thus, every day we see them condemned to the tribute of barren admiration, all these scattered and mutilated fragments of antiquity—these gods without altars, these altars without worshipers, these symbols of honor now de- void of all meaning, these fragments deprived of motive, these sar- cophagi emptied of affection which may attract antiquarian erudition but before which the soul seeks in vain for any emotional response. They are simply too far removed from their original home.45 Quatremère was as aware as anyone of the sea-change in visual perception enacted by Winckelmann. He knew that most of the statues both men admired served originally as the visual inspiration for religious veneration; he knew that most had been housed originally in temples of equal aesthetic pre- cocity. He understood that the massive shift in ways of seeing such objects—the shift in religious rhetoric from “pagan idol” to “fine art”—had served to justify these objects’ dis- play at the Vatican Museum and elsewhere. But he also un- derstood, through hard experience, what the excesses of a secularizing vision had done in the field of the visual arts. And so Quatremère once again wishes to split the difference, to encourage a way of looking at Greek statues that permits them to be both religious images and fine art. It is a spiritu- ally subtle form of seeing that he wishes to promote. This new way of looking at ancient art possessed the added virtue of reminding Quatremère’s audience of the deep in- sight those ancient authors who gazed at these statues before us, and in this way, were capable of communicating. Qua- tremère’s single most influential and important ancient sculp- tor was Pheidias; the single statue that attracted the greatest admiration and critical reflection was his chryselephantine statue of Zeus at Olympia. The book that Quatremère pub- lished on that statue in 1815, Le Jupiter Olympien, was ar- </page> <page sequence="17"> Louis A. Ruprecht, Jr. 149 guably his most influential publication in his own lifetime; it earned him the honorary position of Perpetual Secretary at the Academy and quickly became the standard work on Greek polychrome. Quatremère quotes Quintilian’s famous summary of this statue’s importance in several of his more theoretical works: Pheidias is thought to be better at representing gods than men [tamen dis quam hominibus effingendis melior artifex creditur]. In ivory [ebore] he would be unrivaled even if he had created nothing more than the Athena in Athens and the Zeus at Olympia in Elis, the beauty of which is said to have added something to the tradi- tional religion [receptae religioni], so perfectly does the majesty of the work equal the majesty of the god [adeo maiestas operis deum aequavit].46 This is a remarkable passage in every way. It is noteworthy that Quatremère so often turned to later Roman reflections on Greek art; we may not know the names of any Roman or Byzantine artists, but we are well familiar with the most sig- nificant Roman writers who demonstrated such an encyclo- pedic knowledge of the religious art and architecture of the ancient Greek world: Cicero, Pausanias, Pliny, Quintilian, Strabo, and the like. Perhaps he felt that this kind of criticism was the very best that a properly self-conscious and reli- giously attuned museum culture can produce. For Quintil- ian’s contention is remarkable in every way, virtually turning upside-down a more commonly held understanding of the re- lationship between religion and the visual arts. This work of art had actually added something to the received Olympian religion of the Greeks, Quintillian suggests. The visual arts were not thought to be slavishly in the service of religious or- thodoxy; they were dynamic contributors to the ongoing work of spiritual vision. This is an insight with which Qua- tremère was very much in accord in relation to both the an- cient and the modern arts. While his somewhat dated name for this virtue was “genius,” Quatremère’s fundamental be- lief about idealizing art was that it hinged on the inner vision </page> <page sequence="18"> 150 classics at the dawn of the museum era of the artist. If Pheidias actually added something to Greek religion, then Raphael and Michelangelo, and Canova for that matter, had added something to modern religion as well. This is why it is so wrong-headed to consent to the simplistic view that Quatremère was, or became, “conservative.” He was consistent in his belief that a central role of the fine arts was to supplement inherited forms with visual novelty and inherited knowledge with new vision. The central contention of Le Jupiter Olympien was that there existed an important elective affinity between the reli- gion and the visual arts of the classical Greeks. A profoundly incarnational and anthropomorphic religious system was destined to create the very supplest forms of visual iconog- raphy. Greek religion, in its pre-Christian and Christian forms, was precisely such a thing: The nature and the spirit of Greek religion, which had given rise to these sorts of images of the Divine, were singularly favorable to their execution and use. In effect, nothing other than this kind of religion, in which the senses were called upon to foster and pro- mote belief, could create so great a clarity—with this mingling of the grandiose dimension of these divine figures, the magnificence and beauty of their materials and their execution, and the imitative perfection of the form. No other type of sculpture could have com- bined all of these qualities, and no other could have imposed itself so strikingly upon the imagination. The unity of monochrome ma- terial, whether of marble or bronze, never provided art with the ca- pacity to captivate the senses to the same degree, nor to charm the eye, as did the spectacle provided by these prodigious ornaments to the thrones upon which these gods of gold and ivory reigned supreme.47 He would return to this point in his two forays into theo- retical aesthetics. Here was the first formulation, from 1823: It was especially a consequence of that polytheist religion, which, after having employed signs in a similar sense of relation to that of letters with words, contributed to clothe its emblems with a char- acter fitted to convert them into purely corporeal images, and </page> <page sequence="19"> Louis A. Ruprecht, Jr. 151 adapt them to express by their forms, the most abstract creations of the mind. This novel influence of religion on the arts, due no doubt to the revolution they themselves had contributed to bring about, pro- duced a reciprocal influence on the part of religion over the arts. In- stead of being, as in other instances its slaves, they became its minsters and interpreters. In fact, every Grecian divinity, with its poetical forms and mythological attributes, became a compound of abstract ideas and general properties, which art was insufficient to render visible to the eye, and intelligible to the mind, without the intervention of an ideal or generalized style of imitation.48 And here was his final formulation, from 1837: “The reli- gion of the Greeks was the principle, the engine and the propagator of the ideal style in imitation, and it would ap- pear that the duration of this style, considered at its high- point, was dependent upon and coterminous with this religion.”49 Thus, he argues, it is a failure of nearly categorical pro- portion to object to the use of pagan form in the visual arts in the Christian era. Quatremère refers to this question, or rather this moral concern, rather strikingly, as a “bourgeois” objection: “We continue to appropriate all sorts of ancient images without concern, images belonging to their pagan- ism, and to a system of belief long-since vanished. It is an anachronism, in the same way that a cuirass or a lance or a shield is, and—so they say—likely to mislead posterity as to our own customs and beliefs.”50 He responds to this alleged religious concern in a fascinat- ing way, by supplementing a sculptural practice with a po- etic one: “They [those who voiced the complaint] continue to invoke Apollo and the Muses; they use the same Parnas- sus and the same Olympia as the Greeks, without suffering the illusion that such uses of a foreign faith will throw future generations into confusion.51 In short, the moderns have been clothing themselves in classical costumes, phrasings and myths for a very long time; doing so has inspired some of the greatest artistic achieve- </page> <page sequence="20"> 152 classics at the dawn of the museum era ments of the Neoclassical era. Such a system of creative adaptation requires a tremendous exercise in creative imagi- nation—applied with spirit and passion to the Olympic pan- theon especially (296–297)—and as such it joined the various epochs of Homer, Pericles and Alexander in a single, overarching, idealizing aesthetic vision. This was the religion of Greek antiquity, what Hegel famously called “the religion of beauty” in his Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion.52 Religion, and more specifically the Roman religion (by which I, following Quatremère, intend in both its polytheis- tic and its later institutional Christian forms), lay at the heart of what amounted to a sea-change in European culture and politics. Moreover, the two decisive shifts in religious seeing that I have been tracking—making a larger place for Greek religion in the modern museum, while limiting the po- litical place of the Christian religion in the modern state— were ever more subtly linked in the post-Revolutionary European and North American world order. To set the com- plex contours of this decisive shift in somewhat higher relief, it is necessary to see Winckelmann as the essential Roman precursor to Quatremère’s work in Paris. Throughout Qua- tremère’s published writings, we witness the simultaneous acknowledgment of a massive debt to Winckelmann’s in- spired cultural contributions, coupled with subtler indica- tions of where and how Quatremère wishes to extend, refine, or correct the insights of his remarkably creative predecessor. This too had something to do with the Revolu- tion’s continued rethinking of the devilishly difficult ques- tion of modern religion. Quatremère’s probing reflections on such religious ques- tions are an especially representative way of illustrating what the study of ancient art had become just one generation after Johann Joachim Winckelmann’s (1717–1768) pioneering ef- forts in the field of Art History, an emphatically historicist type of study informed by new and ongoing archaeological discoveries in Italy53 and elsewhere. As I noted at the outset, two things that most emphatically separate the generation of </page> <page sequence="21"> Louis A. Ruprecht, Jr. 153 Winckelmann from the generation of Quatremère were: first, the emergence of several preeminent and entirely public clas- sical art museums in Rome (at the Capitoline in 1734 and at the Vatican in 1757–1767), along with the subsequent dis- semination of a new kind of aesthetic culture throughout the major capitals of Europe; and second, the French Revolution, with its far more convulsive and uneven dissemination of constitutional reforms throughout Europe and her colonial holdings. Of these two phenomena, the museums were every bit as revolutionary as the Revolution, though the radicality of Winckelmann’s cultural achievement has been less well re- marked in recent years. Since, as we have seen, the “displace- ment” (déplacement) of art historical treasures was a major preoccupation in a number of Quatremère’s published writ- ings, the “displacement” of Rome as the commonly ac- knowledged capital of the world of fine arts is an ironic historical subtext to the entire course of his career. Displaced first by Paris, and then by London, Rome is the forgotten ori- gin of the very institution—modern classical art museums— on which most Neoclassicism relied. It would be easy to read Quatremère’s career as primarily political one, or at least to read it in primarily political terms. State sponsorship of the arts was an unambiguous good, in his judgment, but much depended on what kind of state, and what kind of art such a state sought to promote. He was decidedly the product of the new international cul- ture of the public art museum in Europe, an Early Modern institution that grew out of state sponsorship by a religious institution (the Vatican), the precise alliance that the French Revolution had endeavored to abrogate. These institutions had placed certain fundamentally religious ideas—like incar- nation, image and imitation—eloquently on display. Less a political figure than a product of Neoclassical culture in the new era of the European museum, Quatremère provides us with a fascinating example of what classicists and art histo- rians who take museums and religions with equal serious- ness can produce. </page> <page sequence="22"> 154 classics at the dawn of the museum era the legacy and the aftermath antoine chrysostome quatremère de quincy is one of those remarkable figures who, held in very high repute in his own day, has fallen into a relative and undeserved anonymity. In closing, I would simply like to highlight some of the reasons that accounted for the remarkable reputation he enjoyed in his own day, reasons that may also account ironically enough for his relative lack of scholarly stature in our own time. The primary issue has to do with his close, perhaps unduly close, proximity to Winckelmann’s Neoclassical aesthetics and his deep indebtedness to Winckelmann’s conception of Art History. If Winckelmann is considered dated and passé, then so too is Quatremère. To be sure, the old rhetorical trope of Greece as a unique and unschooled marvel of free- roaming genius and artistic creativity is no longer in keeping with our more multicultural attitudes and tastes. Moreover, the comparative dismissal of other Bronze Age civilizations, like Egypt’s, in the name of the singularity of the Greek achievement has been quite properly refuted for the Oriental- ism on which it so often relies. We meet much that is best and worst in Winckelmann in Quatremère’s judgments as well. But Winckelmann, very much like Quatremère, is far too easily dismissed, these days. His achievements were many and the cultural reach of his ideas was remarkably long. As I have suggested several times, it was as an unsung museum curator—that is to say, as one of the founding figures in the creation of the Vatican Museums—that Winckelmann ex- tended his influence far beyond the reach of a dated Neo- classical aesthetic such as the one he professed and promoted. An emerging “museum culture,” which is ar- guably the most decisive legacy of the Vatican museums— founded (1767), looted (1797), and restored (1818), all in the space of fifty years—left a lasting cultural imprint that has only become the subject of proper theoretical attention </page> <page sequence="23"> Louis A. Ruprecht, Jr. 155 in the past twenty years or so. The mark that such a museum culture left on the fields of Classical and Religious Studies, on both sides of the Atlantic, has received considerably less scholarly attention. Quatremère’s career beautifully illus- trates what the field was to become in the first generation that witnessed the simultaneous emergence of the modern public art museum, institutional and state-sponsored mod- ern archaeology, and the concomitant interest in cross-cul- tural display they often promoted . . . all of this, in an age of self-styled political and religious revolution. Debates about the scope, the scale and the cultural or political purpose of such museums were a major issue in Quatremère’s early writings, and provide one important explanation for the ex- tent of his early reputation. Further meditations on a num- ber of European museums—in London, Paris, and Munich, as well as Rome—constituted one of the most recurrent themes in his work and signaled some significant shifts in his later thought, his own demurrals notwithstanding. Quatremère’s was a revolutionary era, as Winckelmann’s was not (though Winckelmann, a deep admirer of Voltaire, may well have sensed some of what was coming). Revolu- tionary turmoil, imperial reaction, and aggressive secularism created the historical context in which Quatremère was to extend the range and the scope of Winckelmann’s ideas—en- hancing them, contradicting them, and supplementing them with new archaeological evidence unavailable to his much- admired predecessor. Arguably the greatest single point of divergence between the two men concerned religion, in my judgment. Qua- tremère is one of those fascinating figures for whom taking the religiosity of Greek art and Greek culture seriously did not threaten his own theological scruples. He saw no neces- sary contradiction between his Neoclassical and his Chris- tian commitments, elusive as they can seem at times. We may read Quatremère as a remarkably creative Christian classicist and art historian. He was, in any case, decidedly not the surprising neo-pagan figure some of Winckelmann’s </page> <page sequence="24"> 156 classics at the dawn of the museum era greatest admirers took him to be (though some scholars have suggested that Quatremère may have flirted with this pose briefly in the waning years of the Napoleonic regime).  The modern museum was a self-styled temple, to be sure— a modern shrine dedicated to an ancient Muse—but it was just as decidedly not a church. Quatremère appears to have inhabited the liminal space between them quite happily, in- tending to connect these two modern institutions in times of rapid change, while at the same time maintaining their sepa- ration. And—this was the key—what linked these two west- ern religious systems most emphatically, to his mind, was their frankly incarnational orientation, an orientation that inspired the creation of art forms notable most of all for what the Venetian sculptor Antonio Canova referred to as their “meatiness” (this phrase appears in an enthused letter he wrote to Quatremère after his first glimpse of the Elgin Marbles in London; he was playing on the essential carne ly- ing at the core of every incarnation).  The works of Pheidias are real flesh [vera carne], of the same beautiful nature as we see in the other most eminent ancient sculp- tures: the Belvedere Mercury is flesh [carne], the Torso is flesh [carne], the battling [Borghese] Gladiator is flesh [carne], every copy of the Satyr of Praxiteles is flesh [carne], the reconstructed Cupid is flesh [carne], the Venus is flesh [carne], and the Venus that is housed in this genuine Museum is the fleshiest of all [carne veris- sima]. . . .  This judgment will suffice to establish most determinatively that these sculptors, renouncing all semblance of rigidity, attended with the greatest care to the beauty and softness of their natural ele- ments. (9 December 1815)54 Classical or Christian, this was the very essence of “west- ern” religion, in Quatremère’s judgment. On the negative side of the ledger, this essentializing notion of western reli- gion hinges on a certain Orientalism that sets such embodied forms of religiosity off against their allegedly more esoteric, highly spiritualized and otherworldly “eastern” counterparts. And yet on the positive side of the ledger, we should note that </page> <page sequence="25"> Louis A. Ruprecht, Jr. 157 Quatremère’s scholarship anticipates a great deal of more contemporary work on material culture, visual piety and ma- terial religion. The human body had come to be seen as a unique locus of aesthetic and moral meaning. If Neoclassi- cism broke with anything besides Baroque busyness, then it was with what was commonly (and probably erroneously55) taken to be the immateriality and excessive spiritual piety of medieval Christian religion and art. What is remarkable in Quatremère’s case is the way the new Classicism was envi- sioned as providing important spiritual resources for the re- juvenation and reincarnation of an ancient faith. Greek religion comprised a subtle thread he strove artfully to reweave into the fabric of modern art and modern life. It is also important to recall that Quatremère lived in Paris, not in Rome. His Roman sojourns, as influential as they were on his early scholarly formation, were simply an especially productive version of a fairly traditional Grand Tour; he was never tempted to trade his homeland for a more permanent Roman residence as Winckelmann had done. Moreover, in the course of Quatremère’s own lifetime, the art-historical center of gravity was shifting—away from Rome, toward Paris and London. This may be one reason why we remem- ber the Louvre and the British Museum, and not the Vatican Museum, as the founding institutions that they decidedly were not. Winckelmann and Quatremère suffered from no such confusion; they knew that the Vatican had sponsored and staged the grand idea, the novel institutions, and the new classical taste they were designed to promote. Winckelmann had played a largely unsung role in the creation of this bur- geoning Roman museum culture; Quatremère was among the most eloquent and productive of his early beneficiaries. But Quatremère was also living in a new era, in a new cultural capital, with a new museum that boasted enormously signif- icant new classical treasures that had been discovered after Winckelmann’s untimely death—like the Venus de Milo. This cultural transfer of Roman influence to Paris, the very “dis- placement” to which Quatremère had objected so passion- </page> <page sequence="26"> 158 classics at the dawn of the museum era ately in 1796, was something with which he appeared to have made his peace in later years. It was, in any case, fast becoming a fait accompli. As Hegel pointedly observed in his Lectures on World His- tory—lectures he offered four times in the mid-to-late 1820s, as Quatremère was completing some of his most important and influential works—spirit moves west, following the sun’s course across the sacred ground below. Quatremère ap- pears to have come to a similar view, whether he knew Hegel’s work in any detail or not. Athens had ceased to be a western city a very long time ago, in his judgment. Rome had displaced her, achieving a preeminence, not to say a per- manence—in both classical and Christian terms—that Athens never managed to secure. But now, ever restless, rev- olutionary spirit was on the move again: Paris and London were the new cultural capitals of a Neoclassical aesthetic regime, each boasting hugely important new museum collec- tions. The simultaneous emergence of modern archaeology, conducted by the European powers almost exclusively under the aegis of the new imperial order, ensured a continual flow of new material into these same museums. It was precisely this constellation of interrelated phenom- ena (the neoclassicism, the imperialism, the museums) that eventually made Quatremère’s work—for all of its impor- tance, remarkable insights and impressive scope—seem ob- solete. He died in Paris in 1849, hard on the heels of yet another revolutionary year in Europe.  It is worth recalling what happened in the art world in that very city, a mere twenty-five years layer. In short, the Neoclassical regime—and the central role that naturalism, idealism and imitation played within this aesthetic vision— was rejected almost completely, and in remarkably short or- der. Paris had landed upon a new self-conception, one that placed pride of place on continual innovation, a somewhat self-congratulatory modernness, and the genius born of rev- olutionary new ideas. If Egyptian art was rejected as static and unchanging, then modern art was to escape that charge </page> <page sequence="27"> Louis A. Ruprecht, Jr. 159 with its emphatic impulse toward continual visual innova- tion. The new source of creative artistic engagement was the inner world of the individual artist, not Greek or Roman statues, and the new artistic challenge was not to imitate, but to create afresh. This, by the way, was what Quatremère took to be the centerpiece of Michelangelo’s genius; he was the first truly modern artist and modern man, one who fully comprehended the novelty of his social role; he was paint- ing, in a very real sense, for himself. The career of these two men took a very different course and manifested a very different character. That of Raphael offers us the image of a river flowing gently along its way across a vast plain, with a large number of tributaries that increase it and accelerate it along its course without interruption. The history of Michelangelo suggests the idea of an enormous body of water surging over un- even territory, accelerating sometimes in rapid torrents, retarded at other times by great boulders, eventually overcoming all obstacles and reaching the sea, but only after having changed its name sev- eral times. (74–75)56 The artist as force of nature, as titanic rebel . . . and as sin- gular source of spiritual enlightenment: this had been Phei- dias, this had been Michelangelo, and this was Canova. They were primarily to be seen as bestowers of aesthetic epiphany. The new artistic movements announced in and around the Parisian Salons in the decades subsequent to Quatremère’s death reveal the lineaments of this story quite well. Signs of what was coming appeared as early as 1863, when the em- peror Louis-Napoleon proposed the creation of a Salon des refusés in order to display work rejected by the somewhat restrictive judgments of that year’s jury57; Manet’s Olympia first met her initially unsympathetic public there.58 Thus did the traditional system of Academy and Salon give rise to an anti-academic anti-Salon;59 so too did the Neoclassical aes- thetics of idealized imitation give rise to a radically new, non-mimetic aesthetics. Impressionism, Fauvism, Cubism, </page> <page sequence="28"> 160 classics at the dawn of the museum era Abstraction, Surrealism60 and all the rest signaled what amounted to the conclusive break with Winckelmann’s and Quatremère’s aesthetics, not to mention the privileged posi- tion once occupied by Greek sculpture and idealistic imita- tion in the fine arts. In a word, what stands between Quatremère’s life and works and those of us who endeavor to read it today is the disruptive and discontinuous history of Modern Art in the twentieth century.  We see this perhaps most clearly enunciated in that great manifesto of abstraction, Wassily Kandinsky’s Concerning the Spiritual In Art (1911). Imitation, he proclaims at the outset, intending to provoke, is a practice best suited to chil- dren and to monkeys.  Every work of art is the child of its age, and, in many cases, the mother of our emotions. It follows that each period of culture pro- duces an art of its own which can never be repeated. Efforts to re- vive the art-principles of the past will at best produce an art that is still-born. It is impossible for us to live and feel, as did the ancient Greeks. Such imitation is mere aping. Externally the monkey com- pletely resembles a human being; he will sit holding a book in front of his nose, and turn over the pages with a thoughtful aspect, but his actions have for him no real meaning.61 Greek art cannot serve as a model for modern times, so different have we become. A more stinging indictment of the entire project of Neoclassicism and what was now taken to be an aesthetics of slavish imitation would be hard to imag- ine. In Kandinsky’s work after 1910, the active notion of composition would come to replace any sense of static imi- tation.62 Indeed, this same word would serve as the title for a great many of his most important transitional paintings. In his view, the era of Winckelmann, and of Quatremère, was decidedly over.  Revolutions may be permitted a certain amount of over- heated rhetoric, but this blanket dismissal of Neoclassicism in the name of Abstraction clearly misses what was best in both men’s work. It is worth recalling that the way both </page> <page sequence="29"> Louis A. Ruprecht, Jr. 161 Winckelmann and Quatremère imagined the difficult art of imitation was neither childish nor apish at all. The two val- ued, not praised, individual artistic creativity at least as much as Kandinsky did—as idealism. Theirs was rather a quasi-Nietzschean call to agonistic imitation, a form of imi- tation aiming at surpassing the ancients with contemporary achievements, much as Rome did with Greece and the Greek arts. In short, the ancients provide us with idealizing models to be surpassed. Quatremère was even more emphatic about this than Winckelmann had been; he was the product of a revolutionary era, after all. Citing his favorite Roman sources, like Cicero, Pliny and Quintilian, he made much of the artistic paradox that a copy may in the best case actually surpass an original. It was never a matter simply of submit- ting to ancient superlatives, still less of clothing modern art in classical dress. Far more was at stake in these aesthetic commitments than that. In fact, Quatremère’s mature aesthetic theories hinged on the unbridgeable distance between the model and the ideal- izing representation which surpasses it. “I reduce this funda- mental principle to its simplest expression in the following terms: To imitate in the fine arts, is to produce the resem- blance of a thing but in some other thing which becomes the image of it.”63 An image, in this technical sense, is not the sort of thing of which a child or a monkey would ever be ca- pable. The radical spirit that animated this aesthetic theory has been beautifully captured in literary form by Roberto Calasso, in an evocative encomium to the vanished mythopoetic sensibilities of the ancient world, The Marriage of Cadmus and Harmony: To betray Hera, Zeus chose one of her priestesses, the human be- ing closest to her, since it was she who held the keys to the shrine. Her name was Io. In looks and dress it was Io’s duty to re-create the image of the goddess she served. She was a copy endeavoring to imitate a statue. But Zeus chose the copy; he wanted that minimal difference which is enough to overturn order and generate the new, </page> <page sequence="30"> 162 classics at the dawn of the museum era generate meaning. And he wanted it because it was a difference and her because she was a copy.64 There is a lot more to this than the so-called narcissism of small differences. There is a world view here—there is pas- sionate commitment, hunger, desire, inspiration, even grief. There is, in short, a religiosity to this core conception of im- ages—their origins, means, and ends. Quatremère always ac- cepted as given the ancient assessment of Pheidias as the supreme exemplar of idealizing classical sculpture. He also accepted without hesitation the ancient consensus that Phei- dias’s monumental gold and ivory statue of Zeus at Olympia was the supreme artistic achievement of the ancient world. The statue, we will recall, was said actually to have added something to the traditional, received religion, in Quintil- ian’s noteworthy judgment. Quatremère took such claims with great seriousness; he believed that Raphael and Michelangelo had accomplished something similar in the remarkable world of Renaissance Christianity, as had Canova in his own day. Teasing out the subtle logic of this view, a surprising conclusion appears on the classical horizon. Pheidias created an image, a sort of copy of an Olympian original, the great god Zeus. But his copy was in some way preferable to the original; his in- tended Greek audience wanted that copy, wanted it perhaps because it was a copy. Quatremère understood himself to be, historically speak- ing, in continuity with that Greek audience, and he took these mingled aesthetic and spiritual desires with great seri- ousness. Only a religion that attends to images, bodies, in- carnation and desire with equal attentiveness can make sense of such things, as he had argued vigorously and repeatedly. At their best, both the Olympian and the Christian religions were such. They were both emphatically Greek religions, af- ter all, mediated by Rome and—Revolution or no—their sun had not yet set. This was the revelation that Winckelmann’s “Profane Museum” had paradoxically been designed to en- hance: an image of the classical past as a living history, not a </page> <page sequence="31"> Louis A. Ruprecht, Jr. 163 dead one; and an image of classical religious images not as something surpassed or rendered mute by the Christian church, as icons, but rather as domesticated and placed on proud display in the very bosom of that same church, as rev- elatory images of fine art.  Quatremère was, in this sense, one of the primary Euro- pean apostles for Winckelmann’s Neoclassical, museum-go- ers’ gospel. Perhaps the publication of a new English translation of Quatremère’s most important epistles will contribute to the noble work of twenty-first century anti- quarians who attempt, however haltingly, to keep their faith intact. notes 1.

Kant’s Critique of Judgment is an explicit source that Quatremère in- vokes in his later theoretical work on imitation, beauty and the ideal, whereas the influence of Hegel is only implicit. We know that Quatremère was introduced to Kantian and post-Kantian aesthetics when he lived with Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi (1743–1819) during his exile from Paris. And we know that the main French promoter of Hegel in post-Revolutionary Paris was Victor Cousin (1792–1867), whose Cours de Philosophie: Introduction générale a l’histoire de la philosophie (Paris 1828) displays the clearest debt to Hegel’s historicism and what he considers his own “eclectic” interest in everything from geography to art to religion and philosophy. According to René Schneider, Quatremère and Cousin collaborated on the revival of the Journal des Savants in 1818, but Quatremère was indebted to Cousin for his Platonism, not an overt Hegelianism, thanks to Cousin’s masterful edi- tions of Plato and Proclus [L’Esthétique classique chez Quatremère de Quincy (1805–1823), vii–viii; 39; 76–9].

Ruprecht, Jr. 165 Germany and his friendship with Hegel, and also 24–9, for the 1828 lecture course on which his mature philosophical—and spiritual—positions were based. I hope to pursue the question of Hegel’s influence on the Academic culture of theoreticians like Quatremère in a subsequent work. 14. I recall the following representative remarks.  Madame Germaine de Staël (1766–1817) summed up Winckelmann’s ca- reer admirably, noting that before him, “[n]o one had, if I may say so, made himself a pagan for the purpose of penetrating antiquity” [this comment is quoted by Walter Pater in The Renaissance: Studies in Art and Poetry: The 1893 Text, 5 Ed. (London 1912), 152. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749–1832) agreed, suggesting not only that “he was the very reincarna- tion of ancient man [antike Natur], insofar as that may be said of anyone in our time, ” but also that it was Winckelmann’s “pagan spirit” [heidnisches Sinn] that enabled his “so-called conversion to Catholicism,” since “being a pagan at heart [als einen gründlich geborner Heiden], his Protestant bap- tism had not been able to turn him into a true Christian” [Goethe, Essays on Art and Literature, Ellen and Ernest von Nardroff, eds. (New York 1986), 101–2; 105, and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe Werke (München 1981), xii; 99–101; 105]. 15. Quatremère made two trips to Italy, the first time for more than three years (1776–80), and then for a second briefer visit in 1783. He met David, who has won the Academy’s coveted Prix de Rome on his first trip to Naples; the two returned together to Paris and visited Italy together again in 1783, where Quatremère met Antonio Canova, who became a lifelong friend until his death in 1822.

Dowd, “Jacobin- ism and the Fine Arts: The Revolutionary Careers of Bouquier, Sergent and David,” The Art Quarterly 16 (1953), 195–214. 16. The classic definition of European Orientalism—the construction of an eastern “other” to assist in the emerging European self-definition as “western”—remains Edward Said’s Orientalism (New York 1978). While the book grossly mischaracterizes the ancient Greek relationship to Persia as proto-Orientalism, the main thesis holds up fairly well within the limits of polemic. Said pays particular attention to the French and British roles in this western construction, especially as evidenced in literature, in Culture and Imperialism (New York 1993). 17. See Louis A.

As we will see, Quatremère was actively involved in the sponsorship and state patron- age of contemporary arts in Revolutionary France. 20.

In his Translator’s Preface, Kent observes that Quatremère was “almost unknown on this side of the Channel,” despite the fact that he had “long enjoyed on the Continent a well-earned reputation” (vii–viii). 23. This was the version that appeared in William Hazlitt, ed., Lives of the Italian Painters (London 1846).

The question put by the Academy in 1785 was this: “What was the status of Architecture in Egypt, and what do the Greeks appear to have bor- rowed” (Quel fut l’état de l’Architecture chez les Egyptiens, et ce que les Grecs paroissent en avoir emprunté)?  32. This was an especially significant event, and caused him great diffi- culty later on. On 3 March 1792, a mob killed the Mayor of Etampes (Jacques-Guillaume Simoneau) over rising grain costs and demands for re- lief. The event clearly demonstrated the need for moderation and the rule of law. A grisly account of his murder appeared in Le Moniteur Universel on March 8th, but a later report on March 19th claimed that the violence was due to outside agitators. The Assemblée nationale and after spontaneous fêtes were held in Lyons, Nemoirs, and elsewhere, the decision was made to centralize the public commemoration in Paris (and to control it). Moreover, the radical left had organized a Fête de la Liberté on 15 April 1792, in honor of a spontaneous mass uprising in Chateauvieux. Thus the Jacobins withdrew their support for the new proposal for a Fête de la Loi. As we can see, the public debate was being constructed as a debate over mutually ex- clusive principles: liberty and law. Quatremère refused to accept that the two principles were incompatible or in necessary contradiction, and organ- ized the parade and other celebrations in that spirit. He became increasingly suspect among the radical left after the summer of 1792, to his great cost.  See Thomas Rowlands, “Quatremère de Quincy: The Formative Years, 1785–95” i: 222–90. 33.

Thomson’s translation is as follows: People have persuaded themselves that the secret for making the Arts flourish lay in these assemblages of works called collections, cabinets, mu- seums. In this all nations have endeavored to vie with each other. It is strange that it has never occurred to them that the masterpieces, or exam- ples, collected and heaped together at great expense, were all in existence prior to the formation of such collections, and that since museums have been built with a view to the production of great works, no great works have been produced to fill museums. Is it not well known that Constan- tinople once possessed, in the collections in the palace of Lausus and of the Gymnasium of Zeuxippe, the most beautiful assemblage of the works of Greece? But did these collections ever create a Byzantine artist? Did not an- cient Rome possess, successively, the Portico of Octavia, the galleries of the Golden House, and of the Temple of Peace? Yet history has not preserved the name of a single Roman sculptor.

Ainsi, comme on l’éprouve tous les jours, ils se trouvent condamnés au tribut d’une stérile ad- miration, tous ces morceaux épars, tous ces restes mutilés de l’antiquité, ces dieux sans autels, ces autels sans adorateurs, ces signes d’honneur sans signi- fication, ces cippes privés de motifs, ces sarcophages vides d’affections, où l’antiquaire va chercher de l’erudition, mais aux quels votre âme demanderait en vain des émotions.

The English translator, Henry Thomson, includes the following footnote to this rousing paragraph: It may not be improper to remark, that the condemnation so justly pro- nounced on the removal of monuments of art, ought not to be applied to the Elgin marbles—they were equally assailed by “the hand of time and still more destructive hand of man”—their appropriation was also contemplated </page> <page sequence="39"> Louis A. Ruprecht, Jr. 171 by a rival nation. Honour, therefore, to the nobleman who received them for the benefit of the arts and public taste in his own country. (67, note). His translation of the paragraph is as follows: How many monuments owe the loss of their powerful effect to their be- ing removed from their original situations! How many works have lost their real value in losing their use! How many objects are looked on with indif- ference since they interest the curious only! They are coins which have no currency except among connoisseurs. Thus every day we see reduced to the tribute of barren admiration all the scattered mutilated fragments of antiq- uity–gods without altars, altars without worshippers, honourable distinc- tions without a meaning, cippi and sarcophagi which enclose no object dear to the affections.– Here the antiquary may pore for information, but in vain may the heart expect to feel the slightest emotion! These objects are lost to their original purpose.  (The Destination of Works of Art and the Use to Which They Are Ap- plied, 66–7). 46. Quintilian, The Orator’s Education, Donald A.

La nature et l’esprit du culte des Grecs, qui avaient donné l’être à ces sortes d’images de la Divinité, en favorisaient singulièrement l’usage et l’exécution. En effet, au gré d’une religion où les sens étaient appelés à com- mander la croyance, rien ne pouvait agir plus effacement, que cette réunion de la grandeur dans les dimensions des figures divines, de la magnifence et de la beauté dans leur matière et leur travail, et de la perfection imitative dans leur forme. Aucun autre genre de sculpture n’eût pu rassembler toutes ces qualités; et aucun autre encore n’eût été capable d’en imposer autant à l’imagination. L’unité d’une matière monochrome, soit marbre, soit bronze, n’eût jamais offert à l’art ni de quoi captiver au même degré les sens, ni de quoi charmer autant les yeux, que le spectacle varié de tous les ornements prodigués dans les trônes où siégeaient ces dieux d’or et d’ivoire. [Le Jupiter Olympien, ou, L’Art de la Sculture Antique considéré sous un nouveau point de vue (Paris 1815), ix].

L’histoire de Michel-Ange donne l’idée d’un de ces énormes volumes d’eau parcourant des régions irrégulières, et dont la course accélérée par de rapi- des torrents, ou retardée par d’énormes rochers, finit par franchir tous les obstacles, et n’arrive à la mer, qu’apres avoir changé plusiers fois de nom.

Danto, What Art Is (Connecticut 2013), 8–9, which situates these developments as the cultural prelude to what he famously deemed “the end of art.” See also his After the End of Art: Contemporary Art and the Pale of History (Princeton 1997), esp. 3–58. 58. For a luminous meditation on this painting, as well as what we might call “the return of the beautiful,” see Alexander Nehamas, Only a Promise of Happiness: The Place of Beauty in a World of Art (Princeton 2010). For a marvelous set of essays on the democratic significance of the return of beauty as a category of criticism, see Dave Hickey, The Invisible Dragon: Essays on Beauty (Chicago 2009). 59. See Schneider, Quatremère de Quincy et son intervention dans les arts (1788–1830), 325–41, for more on Quatremère’s own activity in re- forming the tastes of the Salon-and-Jury culture of his day. 60. This history is nicely summarized, situated and extended to the United States in the 1960s and 1970s, with particular attention to Marcel Duchamp and Andy Warhol, in Danto, What Art Is, 1–52. 61.

Ce principe fondamental, je le réduis, dans le plus simple expression, aux terms suivants: Imiter dans les beaux-arts, c’est produire la ressem- blance d’une chose, mais dans une autre chose qui en devient l’image. [Essay on the Nature, the End and the Means of Imitation in the Fine Arts, 11; Essai sur la nature, le but et les moyens de l’imitation dans le beaux-arts, 3]. 64.

Ma Zeus scelse la copia, desiderò la differenza minima, che basta a disarticolare l’ordine, a produrre il nuovo, il significato. E la desiderò perché era una differenze, perché era una copia . . . —Roberto Calasso, Le nozze di Cadmo e Armon. </page> <page sequence="42">  </page> </plain_text>
