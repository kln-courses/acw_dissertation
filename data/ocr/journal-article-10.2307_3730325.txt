<plain_text><page sequence="1">A POLITICAL READING OF BAUDELAIRE'S 'L'ARTISTE INCONNU' ('LE GUIGNON') The years 1848-51 in France, framed by the February Revolution and the December coup d'etat, provide rich material for those who are persuaded of an inevitable link between art and politics. Some of the central participants in the events of 1848 were writers and painters, and all artists, whether they appreciated it or not, were faced with a choice between commitment and neutrality (and, in the eyes of some, neutrality itself is a form of commitment). Timothy Clark, in The Absolute Bourgeois, has attempted to analyse the responses of artists (primarily Millet, Daumier, Delacroix, and Baudelaire) to the I848 Revolution and has shown that the work of these four artists is 'often more political than it looks at first sight'.1 Not political in a local sense, suggesting specific aims and actions, but political in that it is tied closely to the context of politics. The verse texts analysed by Clark which elucidate Baudelaire's reaction are 'Le Vin des chiffonniers', 'La Ranqon', 'Le Reniement de saint Pierre', and 'Les Litanies de Satan', all poems which can be given a political reading.2 To a greater or lesser degree (Baudelaire's comment on 'La Rancon' was that it illustrated a 'socialisme mitige'),3 these pieces show the poet to be committed to a political sympathy for the oppressed. This particular colouring does not, however, mark Baudelaire's complete poetic output in and around these uncertain years. One famous poem which seems void of such passions is 'Le Guignon', originally titled 'L'Artiste inconnu'; in all probability reaching a finished state in 1851-52, it had no doubt matured in the poet's mind over the years since the Revolution - the evidence will appear in the following pages. The poem, here given in its first extant version (the manuscript sent to Gautier at some time between September 1851 and January 1852), is one of plaintive lyricism, gently concluding with images of melancholic Nature: L'Artiste inconnu Pour soulever un poids si lourd, Sisyphe, il faudrait ton courage; Bien qu'on ait du coeur a l'ouvrage, L'art est long et le temps est court. Loin des s6pultures celebres, Vers un cimetiere isole Mon coeur, comme un tambour voile, Va battant des marches funebres.

It may seem perverse to attempt a political reading of such a delicate sonnet, yet the question is worth asking: can a poem that is written at a time contemporary with the undisputedly political poems analysed by Clark be read as if these poems did not exist? At the very least, the absence of political comment deserves to be noted; at most we may find unsuspected pointers lying deep within the text and its intertexts which guide us to a reading that makes it very much a poem of I848-51. Before looking at its fabrication in detail, I wish first to suggest a perspective. Writing to his mother in August I851, Baudelaire in a desolate mood foresees no immediate acclaim for his work: 'Mon livre de poesie? Je sais qu'il y a quelques annees, il aurait suffi la reputation d'un homme. II euit fait un tapage de tous les diables. Mais aujourd'hui, les conditions, les circonstances, tout est change.'4 The poet depicts himself in this letter as a victim of social change. His book, Les Limbes, originally given a publication date of 24 February 1849, the anniversary of the proclamation of the Republic (a book whose very title, taking up a Fourierist term, had socialist implications),5 was clearly designed to be a work pretending to contemporary relevance. But Baudelaire's own procrastination, the repressive attitudes of the Second Republic, the growth of Realism as a literary movement, the popularity of the ecole du bon sens had all combined in their different ways to lessen the likelihood of success. It is a typical irony that together with this same letter to his mother Baudelaire should send a copy of his article (published in August I85I) on Pierre Dupont, in which one of the main themes is that of the successful poet perfectly attuned to his time. Dupont is a poet 'qui se met en communication permanente avec les hommes de son temps' (II, 27); his natural destiny is to become famous, the threads of his childhood have been woven by fate in order to create the poet, so that all Dupont has to do is to go forward 'dans sa voie naturelle' (II, 30). The essay, as is so much of Baudelaire's critical work, is an intriguing piece of self- revelation, bristling with ambiguities and ironies. It is not difficult to detect the agonizing self-questioning that lies behind the reflection on the success of poets: 'Pourquoi le nom de celui-ci est-il dans toutes les bouches, et le nom de celui-la rampe-t-il encore tenebreusement dans les casiers de librairie, ou dort-il manuscrit dans des cartons dejournaux?' (II, 33). Dupont's secret is his 'amour de la vertu et de l'humanite', his 'gouit infini de la Republique', and the aura of'joie' (II, 33-34) that surrounds his work. But, above all, one feels that the qualities succeed, in Baude- laire's eyes, only because fate has decreed the circumstances in which Dupont publishes his work; he is a 'poete providentiel' (n1, 35).6 Baudelaire's fear, as a 4 Baudelaire, Correspondance, edited by C. Pichois, Bibliotheque de la Pleiade (Paris, 1973), I, I78. The 'livre de po6sie' is almost certainly Les Limbes, the publication of which had been announced in I848, in 1850, and in April 1852; see Crepet-Blin-Pichois, pp. 535-36. 5 See Baudelaire, (Euvres completes, edited by C. Pichois, Bibliotheque de la Pleiade (Paris, 1975-76), i, 794-97, for a summary of the implications of the title. This two-volume edition will henceforth be referred to in brackets by a roman and an arabic numeral. 6 Strengthened by his reading of de Maistre, the idea of providentiality in Baudelaire is a recurrent theme in 85 1-52. The effect of a 'Providence diabolique' dominates the first pages of'Edgar Allan Poe, sa vie et ses oeuvres' (published in March and April 1852), and in a letter to Poulet-Malassis (20 March 1852) the poet suggests that the coup d'etat should be looked at from 'un point de vue providentiel' (Correspondance, I, 189).</page><page sequence="3">Baudelaire's 'L'Artiste inconnu' creative writer, is that his own career is also providentially decreed - but providentially damned. In the Dupont article, this damnation is not voiced, nor is it seen as cause for pride or confirmation of one's ame d'elite, as it will be a few months later in the first long essay on Poe, 'Edgar Allan Poe, sa vie et ses ceuvres', published in the Revue de Paris (March, April I852). Here Baudelaire situates Poe in a long list of writers whom Providence has damned: Hoffmann, Balzac, Vauvenargues, Rous- seau, and (in an allusion to Vigny's novel Stello) Gilbert, Chatterton, and Chenier. Vigny's book had shown, irrefutably according to Baudelaire, that 'la place du poete n'est ni dans une republique, ni dans une monarchie absolue, ni dans une monarchie constitutionnelle' (II, 250). Baudelaire accepts Vigny's conclusion that all political systems deny the worth of the poet and condemn him to misery and premature death; indeed, there is an unspoken correlation between the workings of fate and the workings of a political system, both pushing the poet downwards. But the tone of the Dupont article is very different indeed. Here one finds a refusal to entertain the idea of l'irreparable. Poetry is given the glorious function of curing all ills, destroying injustice, inspiring revolt against oppression, and encapsulating all the hopes and aspirations of the populace: C'est une grande destinee que celle de la poesie!Joyeuse ou lamentable, elle porte toujours en soi le divin caractere utopique. Elle contredit sans cesse le fait, a peine de ne plus etre. Dans le cachot, elle se fait revolte; a la fenetre de l'hopital, elle est ardente esperance de guerison; dans la mansarde dechiree et malpropre, elle se pare comme une fee du luxe et de 1'elegance; non seulement elle constate, mais elle repare. Partout elle se fait negation de l'iniquite. Va donc a l'avenir en chantant, poete providentiel, tes chants sont le decalque lumineux des esperances et des convictions populaires! (II, 35) Poetry, in this definition (again providential), is a form of political action. Its dynamic attack on all forms of repression gives it a direct social role, distancing it from that melancholy tendency of some Romanticism which encouraged suicide rather than reparation. Baudelaire, whose major poetic publication (eleven poems in Le Messager de l'Assemblee) had appeared in April I851 under the title mentioned earlier, Les Limbes, could on that evidence scarcely claim to have any affinity with Dupont; the poems were predominantly lugubrious and irretrievably apolitical (and none the worse for it, of course).7 Indeed, their unhealthy tenor is much more likely to qualify them for banishment together with other Romantic melancholies: Disparaissez donc, ombres fallacieuses de Rene, d'Obermann et de Werther; fuyez dans les brouillards du vide, monstrueuses creations de la paresse et de la solitude; comme les pourceaux dans le lac de Genezareth, allez vous replonger dans les forets enchantees d'oi vous tirerent les fees ennemies, moutons attaques du vertigo romantique. Le genie de l'action ne vous laisse plus de place parmi nous. (II, 34) The frantic rhetoric increases rather than hides the sense of self-exhortation which lies scarcely beneath the surface; the paragraph has the incantatory power of an exorcism operated on the self. It is perhaps the clearest irony in an essay full of irony. There is a great deal more to be said about the Dupont article. But I have sought to highlight three major interrelated themes: fame, providentiality, and the choice between a poetry of action and a poetry of melancholy. It is in the light of these three 7 The poems published were: 'Le Spleen' ('Pluvi6se .. .'), 'Le Mauvais Moine', 'L'Idal', 'Le Spleen ('Le Mortjoyeux'), 'Les Chats', 'La Mort des artistes', 'La Mort des amants', 'Le Tonneau de la haine', 'La Beatrix' ('De Profundis clamavi'), 'Le Spleen' ('La Cloche fRelee'), 'Les Hiboux'. 66</page><page sequence="4">GRAHAM CHESTERS 67 themes that I would wish to examine 'L'Artiste inconnu' more closely. The title (and its generalized variant, 'Les Artistes inconnus', found in a list sent to Gautier with the 'Douze poemes') relates obviously to the theme of fame and, equally obviously, sets apart the moi of the poem and the Dupont of the article. The theme of providentiality is discreetly present in the poem: Sisyphus's fate is decreed by the gods; thejewel and the flower have no choice in their predetermined destiny; and the heart beats an inexorable path towards death. The subsequent title, 'Le Guignon', given to the poem when it was first published in the Revue des deux mondes (i June I855), stresses quite openly the fact that the failed artist is a victim of a 'Providence diabolique'; 'guignon' is the word that in his essay on Poe (1852) Baudelaire sees written across the brows of those writers pursued by 'des destinees fatales' (11, 249). But the third theme - that of poetic action conceived of politically - is explicitly absent: is 'L'Artiste inconnu' then, like so many others, a poem of non-engagement? Or is the absence to be taken as a token of disengagement, a deliberate negation of action? Absence alone is clearly not sufficient proof, but the poem conjures up through its allusions and associations a whole network of cognate texts whose reverberations help to modify and define one's reading. What is remarkable about 'L'Artiste inconnu' is that it is almost all plagiarized - plagiarism that Baudelaire was happy to confess in one of his projets depreface (I, 184). Lines 3-14 are a reasonably close translation of a quatrain from Longfellow's 'A Psalm to Life' and a quatrain from Gray's 'Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard'. Baudelaire copied the two stanzas in English on a single sheet, dating from I850, 'peut-etre 1849' according to the poet's friend, Poulet-Malassis;8 Baudelaire's transcription reads: Full many a gem of purest ray serene The Dark unfathomed caves of Ocean bare. Full many a flower is born to blush unseen, And waste its sweetness on the desert air. Art is long, and time's fleeting, And our hearts, though strong and brave, As muffled drums are beating Fun'ral marches to the grave.9 Elsewhere on this sheet are various drawings by Baudelaire. At the top, sketched laterally, is a half-length portrait of a woman, rather coquettish, and generally supposed to be Jeanne Duval. Below the two quatrains is an inked-in portrait of Auguste Blanqui, France's most persistent revolutionary; this careful drawing, described by Poulet-Malassis as 'extremement ressemblant',10 is centrally placed and occupies a logical space. Unlike the portrait ofJeanne, it seems an integral part of the sheet's design. To the right of the major portrait is an outline sketch of Blanqui in reverse profile. To the left there is a human leg, scarcely outlined, and a powerful tete defemme. The woman is again possiblyJeanne, but this face is no longer that of a coquette, rather that of une femme antique, exuding that mixture of strength and 8 The manuscript, together with Poulet-Malassis's annotations, is reproduced in the Album Baudelaire, edited by C. Pichois, Bibliotheque de la Pleiade (Paris, 1974), p. 83. 9 Baudelaire makes some errors: for 'bare', read 'bear'; for 'strong', read 'stout'; for 'As muffled drums', read 'Still, like muffled drums'. The apostrophes in 'time's' and 'fun'ral' are not in Longfellow's original. 10 See his annotations, Album, p. 83.</page><page sequence="5">68 Baudelaire's 'L 'Artiste inconnu' melancholy found in Delacroix's heroic women. She is a worthy companion to Blanqui. The coming together of the two plagiarized quatrains and Blanqui's portrait has drawn no comment from critics; yet, at the very least, it shows that Baudelaire's poem 'L'Artiste inconnu' was born at a time when the poet was interested enough in revolutionary politics to draw from memory an accurate portrait of one of its fiercest exponents (the significance is increased by the fact that engravings of Blanqui and other insurrectionists were banned under the Second Republic on the grounds that they risked glorifying criminals).1l One could go further. If the Gray stanza proposes the theme of unrecognized talent, of fame denied to the artist, and if the Longfellow stanza concerns the fateful inevitability of death, then the presence of Blanqui on this sheet can be seen as evoking the third major theme of the Dupont article, the theme of action. The poetry of melancholy or the man of action? The two postulations share the same sheet of paper. Blanqui (whom both Benjamin and Clark see as having affinities with Baudelaire)12 was a political recidivist, leading a life that was a constant alternation of prison and revolutionary involvement. Not only is he the man of action, he is also the very image of Sisyphus. Unlike the much more Romantic Prometheus, the great favourite of nineteenth- century writers, whose crime illustrated pride and daring ambition and whose punishment was dramatically cruel, Sisyphus had the misfortune to commit a crime nobody remembers (he disclosed to Aesopus where Zeus had taken his daughters) and to endure a punishment which, in its repeated futility, hardly appealed to the Romantics' taste for intense extremes. In Vigny's 'La Flute' (I843), the central figure, the 'Pauvre' whose talents never match his ambitions (poetic, military, religious, philosophic, theatrical, and so on), is compared sympathetically to Sisyphus: Ce Sisyphe eternel est beau, seul, tout meurtri, Brule, precipite, sansjeter un seul cri, Et n'avouantjamais qu'il saigne et qu'il succombe A toujours ramasser son rocher qui retombe. Such a model may be significant in that it proposes an image of the 'faible courageux' who in one guise at least is a failed poet- and it is a rare model.13 All the more interesting then to find an even closer model: a book of poems, Sisyphe: iambes, published by Fulgence Girard in 1850 (the depot legal is dated 1849). Girard, a friend of such revolutionaries as Barbes, Bernard, and Blanqui (in 1849 he managed to publish in his Histoire du Mont Saint-Michel several letters that he had received from the imprisoned Blanqui), was an ardent Republican poet of no mean talent. His 11 SeeJ. M. Merriman, The Agony of the Republic (New Haven, 1978), p. 45. 12 Benjamin, pp. Ioo-IoI: 'Blanqui's action was the sister of Baudelaire's dream.' Clark, talking of Baudelaire's prose-poem, 'Assommons les pauvres', says: 'If we look for a parallel, we must turn to the statements ofLouis-Auguste Blanqui' (p. I 77). It is worth noting that Baudelaire's name figured as one of the original 325 adherents to Blanqui's Societ6 Republicaine Centrale, constituted 26 February 1848 (see J. Mouquet and W. T. Bandy, Baudelaire en 1848 (Paris, 1946), p. 14). 13 In Alphonse Rabbe's Album d'un pessimiste (published posthumously in 1835-36 and admired by Baudelaire), one finds an unfinished prose piece with the title 'Sisyphe'. The narrator, suffering from a consuming anguish, is transported in a dream to a ruined, deserted landscape where at the base of a huge, divinely-sculptured pyramid he contemplates the marvellously accurate representation of the history of mankind and its catastrophes. The relationship between title and text is left suggestively vague; the Sisyphus allusion seems to be to the human capacity to sustain and survive this ritual of recovery and disaster.</page><page sequence="6">GRAHAM CHESTERS 69 work is resolutely political and he ascribes to poetry the ability to flourish in times of revolution.14 The title of the collection is that of the first poem. The aim of the poem, written in 1848, is to warn the people not to be duped into sacrificing the gains of the February Revolution; Girard fears that history (presumably the events following 1789 and 1830) shows the fragility of proletarian victory. He closes the third section of his poem with the key analogy: L'enfer antique au monde a legue ton embleme; Sisyphe, au roc ensanglante, Le Front courbe sous l'anatheme, Fier vainqueur de la mort, 6 peuple, c'est toi-meme; Son rocher, c'est ta liberte. Section 4 describes the painful triumph of Sisyphus as he strains to push his boulder to the summit and then the harrowing punishment as the rock 'retombe, . . . et, bondissant, emporte dans la plaine / Son corps pantelant et brise'. The final section asks whether the people will always be thus victims: Sera-t-il done toujours, 6 peuple, ton symbole, Ce sombre reflet de l'enfer? Devrais-tu, sans espoir, comme le fils d'Eole, Rouler dans ce cercle de fer? Oh! non ... Girard concludes that at last the people have learned the lesson of history and are now aware of likely treachery. Whereas Camus is to advise the twentieth century: 'II faut imaginer Sisyphe heureux', Girard in more optimistic tone proclaims the possibility of a 'Sisyphe delivre'. (His optimism was of course unfounded.) It is perhaps this Republican Sisyphus, this man of action, that Baudelaire admires in 'L'Artiste inconnu', feeling a consequent inadequacy in comparison. The Sisyphean courage to begin again, whether belonging to a Blanqui, the people, or even a victimized, revolutionary Satan ('Souverain incompris, a qui l'on a fait tort, / Et qui, toujours vaincu, te redresses plus fort', intones the poet in 'Les Litanies de Satan') is a quality which Baudelaire claims not to possess. The first stanza of'L'Artiste inconnu' contains one further political echo which merits reflection and which brings the text yet closer to the Pierre Dupont essay. Towards the end of the essay, Baudelaire introduces the figure of Proudhon, the persuasive advocate of anarchist theories: Quandje parcours l'ceuvre de Dupont,je sens toujours revenir dans ma m6moire, sans doute a cause de quelque secrete affinite, ce sublime mouvement de Proudhon, plein de tendresse et d'enthousiasme: il entend fredonner la chanson lyonnaise, Allons, du courage, Braves ouvriers! Du coeur a l'ouvrage! Soyons les premiers et il s'ecrie: 'Allez donc au travail en chantant, race predestinee, votre refrain est plus beau que celui de Rouget de Lisle.' (11, 34) 14 In his preface he asks: 'La poesie ne serait-elle que le rayonnement des soci6ets calmes? ... Fleur splendide, lui faudrait-il necessairement pour eclore et s'epanouir la securit6 de la paix; le ciel pur des epoques tranquilles? N'est-elle donc pas aussi bien l'eclair que le rayon, - l'indignation que l'en- thousiasme, - le cri que le chant, - le torrent que le ruisseau, - l'elan de l'ame que le battement du coeur, les foudres du Sinai que le buisson ardent de la solitude?'</page><page sequence="7">Baudelaire's 'L'Artiste inconnu' This snatch of song, quoted by Proudhon in his Avertissement aux proprietaires and remembered (incorrectly) by Baudelaire, contains within its four lines not only the rhyme 'courage'/'l'ouvrage' but also the phrase 'Du coeur a l'ouvrage', elements which recur in 'L'Artiste inconnu'. The banality of the rhyme and the familiarity of the expression argue against direct influence; on the other hand, the popular refrain was almost certainly fixed in Baudelaire's poetic memory at the time he composed his sonnet.15 It is quite possible that line 3 ('Bien qu'on ait du coeur a l'ouvrage'), as well as rendering Longfellow's 'though stout and brave', acts as a reply to the 'chanson lyonnaise';16 the poet tries to imitate the worker's courage but his task, despite this effort, is recognized as hopeless. The presence of Blanqui next to the plagiarized stanzas may be coincidence; Baudelaire may never have read Girard; the rhyme and idiom may be thought too banal to carry any allusion. Yet the convergence of these intertexts must surely carry some weight, particularly since they all lend strength to a common reading; the poet separates himself in a movement of negative choice from the men of action: the political agitateur, the Sisyphean masses, and the 'braves ouvriers' (at the same time he implies a distancing from the committed poetry of Girard and Dupont, and from the attitudes of Proudhon). Lines 3-8 of'L'Artiste inconnu' are a transposition of the Longfellow quatrain quoted earlier. The American poet's 'Art is long and time is fleeting' is itself a translation of the first of Hippocrates's Aphorisms, as Baudelaire himself recognized; in the margin of the text sent to Gautier, he notes: 'Vita brevis, ars longa. HIPPOCRATIS aphorismorum Section prima. i'. Hippocrates, of course, is think- ing of the art of medicine, not the art of literature. Paul Benichou supposes that 'Longfellow . . . appelle Art l'activite humaine, l'action sous toutes les formes; lui non plus ne songe pas a la creation esthetique'.17 But this is to forget that the whole poem is an address to an artist and that the subtitle is 'What the heart of the young man said to the psalmist'. The young man is exhorting the poet (both personae are aspects of Longfellow) to abandon the poetry of melancholy ('Tell me not in mournful numbers, / Life is but an empty dream!') and to 'be up and doing'. The plagiarized quatrain, with its doleful image of passing time and thejourney towards death, paradoxically forms part of the young man's optimistic plea: the fleetness of time and the approach of death are arguments for acting in the present. In this context of optimism and exhortation, Longfellow's 'Art is long and time is fleeting' could have two interpretations: first, that the young man is telling the poet that his craft is too ponderous and that there are more useful activities on which to spend one's precious hours; secondly, that since the poetic art takes time, then the poet should work all the harder to complete his verse. In both interpretations, art is seen in aesthetic terms - so Baudelaire is adding nothing new here. What is significant, as Benichou points out, is that Baudelaire has borrowed these lines 'pour en retourner du tout au tout le sens'; what in Longfellow was exhortation becomes in Baudelaire an expression of inadequacy and resignation ('I do not have the necessary Sisyphean courage to overcome the difficulties of my art and the 15 It seems likely that Baudelaire read the I848 reprint of Proudhon's Avertissement aux proprietaires. 16 Proudhon actually calls it a 'chanson faubourienne'; Baudelaire alters the adjective, presumably to strengthen the 'secrete affinite' between Proudhon and Dupont (who was born in Lyons). He may well be more accurate too, but I have been unable to,trace the text and origin of the complete song. 17 P. Benichou, 'A propos du "Guignon"', Etudes baudelairiennes, 3 (I973), 232-40 (p. 235). 70</page><page sequence="8">GRAHAM CHESTERS 7I exigencies of time'). He is in effect adopting the persona of the melancholy psalmist and replying to the heart of the young man. But we must not forget that the cultivated contradiction of Longfellow's text is also in a sense a self-contradiction: 'A Psalm of Life' presents a specific choice between the active spirit of the young man and the melancholy spirit of the poet and is as much an attack on melancholy poetry as is Baudelaire's own notice on Dupont. Both works place action above poetic complaint. The use made by Baudelaire of Longfellow's stanza is a further example of negative choice, the process which in my argument underlies the fabrication of the opening lines of the sonnet. Baudelaire, by excluding the young man's enthusiasm from his poem, has composed by contradiction. Just as a glance at the whole context of Longfellow's stanza helps to define Baudelaire's use of it, so it might be useful to look more closely at Gray's famous elegy, a poem which, relating as it does the 'short and simple annals of the poor', is clearly open to a political reading of some sort. One might object that the natural references extracted by Baudelaire (the 'gem of purest ray serene' and the 'flower ... born to blush unseen') have a decidedly unpolitical air. Yet one has only to look at a roughly contemporary poem by Baudelaire, 'Les Litanies de Satan', to realize that the image of the buried gem can be highly political in its overtones. The poet addresses Satan: Toi qui sais en quels coins des terres envieuses Le Dieujaloux cacha les pierres precieuses, . . . Toi dont l'ceil clair connait les secrets arsenaux Ou dort enseveli le peuple des metaux, ... Toi, qui, pour consoler l'homme faible qui souffre Nous appris a meler le salpetre et le soufre, ... Baton des exiles, soutien des inventeurs, Confesseur des pendus et des conspirateurs. In this committed poem, Satan is the figurehead of revolutionaries; 'grand roi des choses souterraines', he knows the value of that which a repressive God has condemned to oblivion. The 'dort enseveli' of the second couplet quoted above is a particularly significant echo of line 9 of 'L'Artiste inconnu' ('Maint joyau dort enseveli'), for it falls in a subtly menacing passage (the 'secrets arsenaux' suggesting the armed insurrection of the repressed 'peuple des metaux'). The buried stones and metals in 'Les Litanies de Satan' have potential political power; the buried gem in 'L'Artiste inconnu' has no Satanic allies and simply acquiesces to its fate. The comparison of the texts shows that the image of precious stones could have been given revolutionary overtones but that Baudelaire has chosen not to activate them; his preference for an image of saddened acquiescence confirms yet again a move- ment of disengagement. Without recourse to 'Les Litanies de Satan', one could offer a political reading of Gray's images of gem and flower. William Empson, who sees in the Elegy 'an odd case of poetry with latent political ideas', comments on the stanza thus: What this [the stanza] means, as the context makes clear, is that eighteenth-century England had no scholarship system or carriire ouverte aux talents. This is stated as pathetic, but the reader is put into a mood in which one would not try to alter it.... By comparing the social arrangements to Nature he [Gray] makes it seem inevitable, which it was not, and gives it a dignity which was undeserved. Furthermore, a gem does not mind being in a cave and a</page><page sequence="9">72 Baudelaire's 'L'Artiste inconnu' flower prefers not to be picked; we feel that the man is like the flower, as short-lived, natural, and valuable, and this tricks us into feeling that he is better off without opportunities.l8 As Empson states, all depends on the context. Yet even when divorcing the stanza from its context, Baudelaire retains vestigial political implications of the images of acquiescence. But Baudelaire, it should be noted, cannot be accused of tricking anyone; his poem is a highly personal gesture of tragic acceptance and does not advocate covertly a generalized satisfaction with the status quo: the jealous admira- tion of Sisyphus, for example, suggests a desirable alternative to the poet's own attitude. The images of the gem and the flower in Gray are metaphors of unrecognized talent in various domains, including the poetic ('Some mute inglorious Milton here may rest').19 But as the elegy progresses it is the lack of poetic fame that becomes the 18 'Proletarian Literature', in Some Versions of Pastoral (London, 1935). As Empson goes on to say, these images of hidden beauty or talent do also capture a non-political, permanent truth commonly felt about the human condition, and are thus more or less commonplaces. Gray's stanza itself has had several sources ascribed to it, the most convincing being the lines from Celio Magno (1536-1602): Ma (qual in parte ignota Ben ricca gemma altrui cela il suo pregio, O fior, ch'altra virtu ha in se riposta Visse in sen di castita nascosta,) In sua virtute e'n Dio contento visse, Lunge dal visco mondan, che l'alma intrica. (quoted in The Complete Poems of Thomas Gray, edited by H. W. Starr and J. R. Hendrickson (Oxford, 1966), p. 223). One parallel use of such images is found in a fascinating if poetically undistinguished piece published en plaquette by Alexandre Guerin in 1849, L'Artiste-Ouvrier. The narrator is advising a young provincial worker to forget his poetic ambitions and to return to his humble atelier: Enfant, sache-le bien, l'avare, l'usurier Se mettront ajeter de l'or par la fenetre Avant qu'un nom fameuxjette un brin de laurier A l'artiste inconnu qu'iljalouse peut-etre!! ... Or tout beau front qui gene un beau front souverain Est comme emprisonne dans un cercle d'airain! ... Sous la cendre qui dort, il est des etincelles; II est des cherubins dont on coupe les ailes; II est des chants du ciel proscrits a peine eclos; II est de belles fleurs dans un obscur enclos; Mais fleurs et feux follets, beaux reveurs et beaux anges Du voile de l'oubli vont enrichir les franges! L'oubli! ... Peses-tu bien ce mot vaste et profond? Pour l'ame du reveur, c'est un gouffte sans fond! ... L'artiste, mon enfant, l'artiste qu'on ignore, Mais c'est un pauvre fou qu'un poison lent devore; C'est l'humble voyageur briul par le soleil, Dont lesjours sont fievreux et les nuits sans sommeil; C'est le rameau fane du saule qui frissonne, C'est l'oiseau qui s'abat au vent qui tourbillonne; C'est un flambeau vivant, mort dans l'obscurite, C'est l'aigle qu'on reduit a la captivite! These lines read like a dense summary of the whole repertoire of that Post-Romantic imagery that so characterizes Baudelaire's verse; echoes and affinities strike the reader in almost every couplet. 19 A line which Chateaubriand renders in his imitation of Gray, 'Les Tombeaux champetres': 'La, dorment dans l'oubli des poetes sans gloire.' At the same time, he alters the line-order so that this mention of the 'poites sans gloire' follows immediately the image of the gem and the flower. The specifying juxtaposition and the 'dorment dans l'oubli' (admittedly banal) may have struck Baudelaire. Chateau- briand reminds the reader in his Essai sur la litterature anglaise that he has imitated Gray, asks 'Qui ne l'a pas imite?', and goes on to quote twelve lines from his 'translation' including the gem and flower images ((Euvres completes de Chateaubriand (Paris, 1837), pp. 245-46). On the previous page, his passage on Young closes: 'Regretter ce qu'il a perdu, habiter dans ses souvenirs, marcher vers la tombe, en s'isolant, c'est l'homme. Les images prises dans la nature ont mille rapports avec nos fortunes: celui-ci passe, en silence, comme l'epanchement d'une source; celui-ci... .' The presence of'dorment dans l'oubli', 'poetes sans gloire', 'marcher vers la tombe, en s'isolant', 'l'epanchement' either shows a direct influence or illustrates yet again the prevalence of a narrow range of elegiac vocabulary.</page><page sequence="10">GRAHAM CHESTERS 73 underlying lyrical theme- certainly in the last nine stanzas. In these much-debated lines, the elegiac narrator imagines a 'hoary-headed swain' answering some future enquiry as to the fate of'thee, who mindful of th'unhonoured Dead / Dost in these lines their artless tale relate'; the narrator ends the poem with his 'self-portrait' (spoken by the swain) and his own epitaph, the first verse of which insists on the notions of fame, melancholy, and providentiality: Here rests his head upon the lap of Earth A Youth to Fortune and to Fame unknown, Fair Science frown'd not on his humble birth, And Melancholy mark'd him for her own. The narrator himself, foreseeing his burial 'Loin des sepultures celebres, / Vers un cimetiere isole', takes on the mantle of the unknown artist, 'perhaps a village poet' according to H. W. Starr,20 or else 'a kind of declasse intellectual deriving obviously from a social class and milieu different from that of the "rude" peasants whom he describes' (F. H. Ellis). The itinerary of the poem, moving from outward gaze to inner reflection, would no doubt have appealed to Baudelaire; it displays quite brilliantly the irrepressible irony of the self-conscious narrator. For self-consciousness of the artist is a key theme in Baudelaire's own poetry and it is no accident that the texts which he plagiarizes in the making of'L'Artiste inconnu' are texts which reflect on the activity and position of their creator as poet. They present images of the inactive artist (Longfellow's psalmist), the unknown artist (Gray's narrator), and the melancholy artist (the psalmist and the narrator), all models for Baudelaire himself. The discussion of these texts and others that hover with more or less certainty around the composition of 'L'Artiste inconnu' may strike one as an interpretative luxury, since the sonnet stands beautifully on its own. Yet to appreciate the family of texts to which it belongs is to appreciate the essential difference of the poem. The study of literary genesis does not reveal a simple process of pollenization or geological growth; Baudelaire's fleur and joyau are born of contradiction and acceptance, a delicate faceting of received material so that some beams enter only to be reflected back towards their source, leaving nevertheless traces of their passing. Blanqui, Girard's Sisyphus, Proudhon's workers, Longfellow's enthusiastic young man linger behind or on the edge of the text and, through their very exile, signify the act of compositional choice made by Baudelaire. To anyone interested in Baudelaire's skill in being able to 'manier savamment une langue' (ii, I 8), 'L'Artiste inconnu' is a valuable poem in that its combination of double plagiarism and translation allows insight into the manipulation of raw material, the weighing and balancing of syllables, a restricted number of words and meanings in the poet's mind. Paul Benichou makes excellent observations on 'le travail poetique de Baudelaire' in his article and the pages that follow will draw partly on his conclusions. But they will also hope to go further into the details of the integration, transcription, and modification of the plagiarized texts. 20 H. W.

Ellis's essay, 'Gray's "Elegy": The Biographical Problem in Literary Criticism', is taken from the same collection (pp 5- 75).</page><page sequence="11">Baudelaire 's 'L'Artiste inconnu' The first thing that one notices is the fact that Baudelaire has needed twelve lines to render the eight of Longfellow and Gray. The demands of rhyme have had their effect here; undisputed additions made by Baudelaire ('Loin des sepultures celebres', 'isol', 'l'oubli', 'comme un regret') are intricated in the rhyme scheme and owe partial thanks to the exigencies of form for their inclusion. They solve a technical problem and, the very opposite of chevilles, enrich the suggestion of the poem. The opening quatrain integrates non-plagiarized and plagiarized material with the help of the etymological bond in 'courage'/'cceur', and the tautness of the line- ends: the A-rhymes interlock with the B-rhymes, so that 'lourd' and 'I'ouvrage', 'courage' and 'court' all echo each other. The second stanza begins with an addition ('Loin des sepultures celebres') which seems to have strayed from Gray. Unlike the young man in Longfellow who envisages an active mankind moving forward together (even towards the grave), Baudelaire is concerned - as was Gray - to stress the separation of mankind into the famous and the unknown; the added 'isole' in line 6 likewise emphasizes a spatial categorization absent from Longfellow. And the change from 'Our hearts' to 'Mon cceur' confirms Baudelaire's intention to drain Longfellow's stanza of its all-encompassing validity; the focusing on the personal fate here implies that others enjoy a happier lot. Self-definition achieved by the setting-up of an opposite model (as Sisyphus earlier) is fundamental to Baudelaire's expression. There are in this second stanza three elements which one might call 'given', elements of translation which must have imposed themselves on Baudelaire: first, the fact that the play on the word 'beating' (applied to hearts and drums) works excellently in French; secondly, once the 'beating' is kept, the 'tambour voile' stands as a set phrase corresponding exactly to 'muffled drums'; and thirdly, the phrase 'marches funebres' offers itself as a natural version of'fun'ral marches' and one with the advantage of carrying as companions a cluster of possible rhymes (celebres, tenebres, vertebres, all of which Baudelaire savoured in various poems). Fortunately - the poet's guignon does allow some respite - 'voile' and 'funebres' give rhymes of different genders and must have seemed all the more attractive. The tercets move away from the human world of the octet in order to propose two natural allegories which are left suggestively poised without any overt analogical link (Gray adopts exactly the same poetic method).21 The positional equivalence of 'Maintjoyau' and 'Mainte fleur' imitates Gray, and by making both nouns subjects of their sentences Baudelaire adds a syntactical equivalence.22 This modification (and the consequential 'dort enseveli') typifies the poet's freer treatment of Gray as compared to that of Longfellow; 'the dark, unfathomed caves of Ocean' is, for example, given by 'dans les tenebres' and 'bien loin des pioches et des sondes', and the qualifying 'of purest ray serene' is omitted altogether. The notion of 'dans l'oubli', on the other hand, is an interesting addition, containing a hint of a lost or unheeding audience. This Baudelairean hint of failure is helped by the association with the phrase 'tomber dans l'oubli' (an image of descent and depth as here), the implications of the title, and the earlier contrastive mention of'sepultures celebres'. Any possible banality attached to 'dort ... dans l'oubli' is counterbalanced by the 21 The change of reference between octet and sestet has provoked accusations of disunity and vague construction.

A stronger hint of frustrated ambition is present in the flower image in the verb 'epanche'; the artist, like the desert flower, lacks an audience and expends his gifts in vain. The simile 'comme un regret', not in Gray, reinforces the disconsolate position of the artist and the flower. The blatant anthropomorphism of the image (flowers, Empson would remind us, do not regret anything) makes the analogy between poet and flower easier to establish: as with 'dans l'oubli' the poet's sense of failure infiltrates the natural metaphor. After looking at Baudelaire's manipulation of his originals, one might ask how well he has integrated his dual sources. On the formal level, it is true that he has assigned them to either side of the pivot traditionally found in the sonnet after the second quatrain. On the other hand, the internal rhyme 'celebres'/'funebres'/ 'tenebres' helps to fuse the two parts together; so does the phonetic and etymological link between 'isole' and 'solitudes'. More important than either of these blendings is the extensive use of syntactic parallelisms studied by Nicolas Ruwet, who cites: Loin des sepultures celebres Vers un cimetiere isole . .. Maintjoyau ... Dans les tenebres et l'oubli, Bien loin des pioches et des sondes; Mainte fleur ... Dans les solitudes profondes. and goes on to comment: Sur dix vers, cinq sont donc entierement constitut6s par des syntagmes prepositionnels de lieu (quatre locatifs, et un directionnel, au vers 6). Des correspondances internes plus serrees groupent la plupart des vers deux a deux: (a) 'Loin des sepultures celebres / Vers un cimetiere isole' (determinant, nom, adjectif; noter les correspondances phoniques entre s6pultures et cimetiere); (b) 'Dans les tenebres ... / Dans les solitudes'; (c) 'Loin des s6pultures'/'Bien loin des pioches . .'; (d) '. . . les t6enbres et l'oubli'/'.. des pioches et des sondes'; (e) (structure interne des syntagmes et correspondances phoniques) '... des s6pultures celebres'/'les solitudes profondes'.23 Of this list, (a), (c), and (e) forge links between the passages from Gray and Longfellow, and all these observations show how the alterations and additions made by Baudelaire fall happily under the authority of a higher, carefully patterned design. This brief examination of the imitative stanzas highlights the relative economy of the translation, despite the length. In this respect the additions ('sepultures ce6lbres', 'isole', 'l'oubli', 'comme un regret') deserve particular mention. They might, as stated, grow from the demands of rhyme, but they also all relate to the theme of public recognition (or lack of it). The first two introduce the theme into Longfellow's stanza from which it was entirely absent; the second two lend precision 23 'Parallelismes et deviations en po6sie', in Langue, discours, sociiti, edited byJ.

The poignancy of the undiscovered gem or the lonely flower depends entirely on the discovery of other gems and the accessibility of other flowers. Similarly the tragedy of the 'artiste inconnu' depends on the fame of others (those who will lie in the 'sepultures celebres'); the frustration felt by the poet at his inability to overcome the difficulties of creation depends on the knowledge that others have successfully engaged in creative action (poetic, political, or general). The allusions tracked outside the text have the effect of sharpening the implied dialectic of the poem, and, to my mind, cohere convincingly. Such tracking, speculative as it is, has to be viewed with caution, and no doubt one could argue that the aesthetic power of a sonnet such as 'L'Artiste inconnu', like that of the gem or the flower, is contained within its contours. Yet it is not easy to close one's mind to the geologist and the botanist when they tell us why the gem and the flower are there and not elsewhere, why they display those characteristics and not others. The origins of a poem do not yield to precise scientific investigation but that is not to say that they are all totally irrecoverable 'bien loin des pioches et des sondes'. The exploration of the ground behind 'L'Artiste inconnu' has revealed an area of political sensitivity in which the poet has sought to balance certain ideological choices. His final expression all but eradicates traces of discarded options but enough vestiges remain to persuade us that the poem is one of disengagement, conveying Baudelaire's realization of the limits of his own poetic action. It is a denial of the optimism of the Dupont article, a denial of a poetico- political idealism - indeed no less a denial than 'Le Reniement de saint Pierre'. Both 'L'Artiste inconnu' and 'Le Reniement de saint Pierre' grow out of the disillusionment of the years following I848. According to Antoine Adam, St Peter's denial of Christ is a rejection of an idealism that pretends that we live in a world where action and dream are reconcilable; by applauding St Peter, the poet pro- claims his own estrangement from the ambitions of I848. 'Le Reniement de saint Pierre', for all its political implications, is none the less a lyrical poem and - in Adam's words - 'exprime le desespoir et la solitude du poete'. It is a description that fits 'L'Artiste inconnu' perfectly and the fact that it does so shows the integration of the lyrical and the political in Baudelaire's poetry.24 UNIVERSITY OF HULL GRAHAM CHESTERS 24 I should like to thank the British Academy for their award which enabled me to pursue some of the research necessary for the writing of this article.</page></plain_text>
