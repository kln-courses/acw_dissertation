<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of World Prehistory, Vol. 10, No. 2, 1996 The Formative Period on the South Coast of Peru: A Critical Review Helaine Silver/man1 Previous and current fieldwork has generated a significant body of data on the occupation of the south coast of Peru during the Formative Period (ca. 3800-2200 B.P). These data are placed in a synthetic framework and evaluated and compared to the trajectory of cultural development in the better studied regions of the Central Andes. Critical review of this panorama necessitates consideration of the relative chronological framework and definition of the Formative Period, the parameters and validity of the south coast as a culture area, contacts south coast societies sustained with other Central Andean regions, and the role of monumental architecture in the rise of complex society. KEY WORDS: Peru; Formative Period; complex society; culture area; chronology. INTRODUCTION Peru is one of the six regions of pristine state formation (Service, 1975). However, not all regions of Peru eventually developed state-level society, even if they were occasionally incorporated into centralized geo political units. The south coast of Peru was one such Central Andean region that never saw the rise of an autochthonous state configuration. The mani festations of and reasons for its different cultural trajectory already can be seen in the Late Preceramic Period (ca. 4500-3800 B.P.) when societies farther north were striking out on the evolutionary course(s) that would lead to true social stratification and its concomitant behaviors. department of Anthropology, 109 Davenport Hall, 607 South Mathews Street, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, Illinois 61801. 95 0892-7537/96/0600-0095$09.50/0 O 19% Plenum Publishing Corporation</page><page sequence="2">96 Silverman This article examines the culture history and cultural dynamics of the south coast in that period of time known as the Formative Period (ca. 3800 2200 B.P) among Peruvian archaeologists (e.g., Lumbreras, 1974a, b) and the Initial Period and Early Horizon among North American archaeologists working in Peru (e.g., Rowe, 1967a). The south coast societies treated in this paper have attracted little scholarly attention being greatly overshad owed, at the early end of the time in question, by the impressive monu ments and great public art of contemporary cultures found farther north, and by Nasca culture which developed in the region subsequently (ca. 2000 1300 B.P). Yet enough fieldwork has been conducted on the south coast to permit, indeed necessitate, a critical synthesis of the earliest pottery-us ing societies through the rise of the first regional culture. This is the first attempt at such an evaluation and the ideas proposed herein will surely be modified over coming years as archaeologists turn their attention to the problems raised. DEFINITION OF TERMS Culture Area Delimitation In the Peruvian archaeological literature the south coast is defined as a culture area or group or archaeological region within the Central Andes that itself constitutes a culture area (Bennett, 1948; Lumberas, 1981; Willey, 1971). Although it is virtually never specified in print, it is clear that most archaeologists use the modern-day boundaries of the Department of lea to delimit the south coast (Fig. 1). This delimitation has an environmental parameter corresponding to the end of the fog bank that covers the central coast in winter. Chincha, the northernmost valley of the Department of lea, has a warmer and sunnier climate than Canete, the southernmost valley of the neighboring Department of Lima. Geographically, on the south side of the Department of lea a great stretch of coastal desert separates the southernmost tributary of the Grande River from the next group of valleys (Acari, Yauca, Atiquipa, Chala), located in the Department of Arequipa. The utilization of the Department of lea to define the south coast also encompasses the areal distribution of three great, related, regional archae ological cultures and art styles, Paracas, Topara, and Nasca (see Silverman, 1991). The problem with this implicit criterion is that Nasca pottery is pre sent in Acari and the Topara style appears to have originated in Canete. But the core area of cultural development and interaction of these three societies clearly is the territory encompassed by the Department of lea.</page><page sequence="3">Formative Period on the South Coast of Peru 97 . \ LIMA ] if HUANCAV^L&gt;CA rio san j UAn\ ~m~j^ (chinch a) K~*\_/ / Paracas Peninsula i"-*^ ^^Sk^^ f ^""N* ?i s 11/ |L ^ &lt;"~^l ] Y A CIJC H O rio grande \rf V /r~"""" denazca^^ J A R EQ U I P A 0 30 60 90 120 150 ?\ Fig. 1.

For him the south coast comprises the valleys of Pisco, lea, Nazca, Acari, and the Paracas Peninsula; this grouping is identical to Bennett's (1948, p. 4) save Lanning's inclusion of Acari. Lanning distinguishes the south coast from the south-central coast which includes the Asia, Canete, Topara and Chincha valleys (see also Bennett, 1948, p. 4). Lanning specifically states that his grouping "is based on cultural affiliations rather than on a geo graphical separation." Nevertheless, there are problems with this construc tion since the Topara style also is present in Pisco and Paracas pottery also is indigenous to Chincha (Engel, 1957; Lanning, 1960; Silverman, 1991; Wallace, 1985, 1986). Furthermore, cultural affiliation is a concept that re quires temporal definition. In what moment of time did the south coast emerge as a unit of culture-sharing valleys whose societies consciously dif ferentiated themselves from peoples living in the valleys to the north and south? Is Lanning's delimitation valid in all periods? The cultural bounda ries of the south coast changed over the course of time, as shown below. However, even from as early as the Late Preceramic Period, the societies of these southern valleys were different from those of the central coast and, even more so, from those of the north coast in terms of pottery style, social, economic and political organization, ideology, and patterns of intra and interregional interaction. In this article the south coast archaeological area is defined as encom passing the territory within the Department of lea plus the Acari Valley (and, possibly, Yauca). Within this delimitation and over time some valleys were more and less closely culturally linked. But always there was more intercultural and intersocietal interaction within this area than between it and beyond, with the exceptions of Puerto Nuevo's relationship to Cupis nique people on the north coast and Ica-Karwa's relationship to Chavfn, both discussed below. Environmental and Ecological Parameters Having specified the geographical parameters of the south coast it is important to consider its environment and ecology for these had significant bearing on cultural developments in the region. Worldwide, increasing population size, density, and pressure constituted one of the key factors promoting the development of complex society. In terms of the Central Andes, the south coast is characterized by some of the narrowest and driest river valleys along the arid Peruvian coast (ONERN 1970, 1971a-c, 1975, 1976). While it is true that "one good soaking of the land a year was enough to ensure a crop of maize and squash" (Rowe, 1963, p. 9, speaking about</page><page sequence="5">Formative Period on the South Coast of Peru 99 the lea Valley but applicable to the whole south coast), this kind of hy draulic regime could not and, apparently, did not generate the major ag ricultural productivity and related population size and density characteristic of valleys to the north, most especially in the Jequetepeque-Zaha-Reque Leche-Motupe complex (see Kosok, 1965). These rich valleys of the north coast may be contrasted to the hydraulic regime of the Rio Grande de Nazca drainage, whose multiple tributaries in 1971 permitted only 12,920 ha of arable land to be farmed with modern, artificial irrigation methods (ONERN, 1971, p. 181). Kosok (1965, p. 58) correctly observed that the north coast river valleys could have water for most of the year, whereas south coast valleys might have water for just a few months, if at all. Fur thermore, the southern branches of the Nazca drainage suffer from a loss of surface water in discontinuous stretches of valley (Silverman, 1993, pp. 9-11; Schreiber and Lancho Rojas, 1995, pp. 231-232). Kosok (1965, p. 58) concluded that in the south no great wealth could accumulate and that "consequently, conditions never arose whereby a secular state could ap pear?except at rare intervals and then probably only as an outside intru sion." I am in fundamental agreement with Kosok. Due to a more limited suite of critical resources (land and water), throughout the prehispanic pe riod?as indeed today?the south coast had far less population than the north coast and, probably, the central coast. Only in the latest prehispanic period and then only in Chincha and, to a lesser degree lea, did truly com plex, yet still nonstate, societies develop (Menzel, 1959, 1966; Silverman, 1993, pp. 320-343). Related to this issue of hydraulic regime is irrigation. Whereas arti ficial canal irrigation is indirectly dated, on the central and north coast, to the beginning of the Initial Period on the basis of the major shift inland of settlements (Moseley, 1975), no such data are available for the south coast. Indeed, at present, the archaeological evidence of artificial irriga tion on the south coast dates to the Early Intermediate Period (see Canziani, 1992; Schreiber and Lancho Rojas, 1995). While recognizing that irrigation did not necessarily require the great managerial skills and bureaucratic centralization postulated by earlier scholars (e.g., Wittfogel, 1957), still large-scale canal irrigation did promote intravalley (and, later, intervalley), multigroup cooperation and coordination, thereby interdigi tating with other cybernetic linkages and processes leading to the emer gence of complex society. Supracommunity irrigation was missing on the south coast for millenia after its appearance on the north and central coast. Another major difference between some of the valleys of the south coast (specifically, lea and the Rio Grande de Nazca drainage) and those of the central and north coast may be considered under the concept of</page><page sequence="6">100 Silverman Fig. 2. The river valleys of the coast of Peru, south of Lima to Acari. For the multitributary Rio Grande de Nazca drainage the numbered rivers are (1) Santa Cruz, (2) Grande, (3) Palpa, (4) Vizcas, (5) Ingenio, (6) Nazca, (7) Aja, (8) Tierras Blancas, (9) Quebrada Atarco-Pajonal-Taruga-Guanillo, and (10) Las Trancas or Tunga (Quebrada Usaca-Poroma-Quemazon). "distance from the sea." Not only do lea and Nazca lack the wide alluvial deltas characteristic of most of the other coastal rivers, but also marine resources apparently were more important in the north and central coast valleys than in south coast settlements with the notable exceptions of the Paracas region sites and the common occurrence of marine resoures at Initial Period Hacha in Acari. The major focus of settlement in lea and Nazca was land irrigable by seasonal flood waters (and, later, by artificial irrigation) located significantly inland from the sea and, in the case of the lower lea Valley, oases with a high water table that provided a water sufficient setting for agriculture from Initial Period times on. Marine re sources supplemented the south coast diet but did not constitute the basic</page><page sequence="7">Formative Period on the South Coast of Peru 101 economic orientation as was the case in the Late Preceramic Period on the north and central coast (Moseley, 1975). Nor do marine resources appear to have supplied Initial Period south coast peoples with a sub stantial part of the animal-protein intake as was the case in various sites to the north (see, e.g., Pozorski and Pozorski, 1987), again with the ex ception of Hacha. Though household archaeology at south coast, Initial Period sites may change this perception in the future, at present it can be argued that on the south coast, distance from the sea also inhibited population size, population density, and multiply nested cross-ecological economic interactions and, therefore, delayed the onset of complex cul tural configurations. I also argue that the large desert tracts separating the south coast from the central coast and from the yet farther and poorer valleys of the far south coast acted to inhibit and postpone the rise of complex society on the south coast. Eighty kilometers and the small, narrow valleys of Chilca, Mala, and Asia intervene between the rich Lurin Valley and the next large coastal valley to the south, Canete (Fig. 2). Today, the total agricultural area of Chilca-Mala-Asia together is calculated as only 7730 ha (ONERN, 1976, p. 1). These three minivalleys behaved as some kind of cultural fron tier, permeable but peripheral to the cultural developments and processes occurring to the north. The only evidence I have seen reported of contact between the south coast and the central coast in the Initial Period is of "Disco Verde type" pottery at the Huaca Grande site in Asia (Engel, 1987, p. 90) and a Disco Verde-type ring base in a Curayacu 2 stratum, from a site just south of Lurin (Lanning, 1960, p. 516). It appears that early in the Initial Period the distance and dispersed populations between Lurin and Canete had created a no man's land that inhibited the spread of classic Initial Period ideology and architecture to Canete, a large fertile valley which otherwise should have been a prime participant in the central coast and north coast and north highlands interaction sphere. The early isolation of Canete appears to have set the pattern for the remaining three thousand years of its prehispanic history. Canete never achieved a centralized politi cal configuration, nor was it ever fully integrated into any Central Andean interaction sphere. Separated from Canete by another 40 km of barren desert lies Chin cha, today a large, fertile valley of immense commercial agricultural pro duction. Its lower valley is watered by two tributaries of the San Juan River, with evidence of at least two more fossil branches in the delta (Canziani, 1992, p. 111). However, using ONERN's (1970) data and on the basis of his own observations, Canziani (1992, pp. 111-112) cautions that the San Juan is notoriously dry and irregular, with only occasional, brief, full charges despite the valley's ample arable land. In contrast, Pisco is a long</page><page sequence="8">102 Silverman and narrow but well-watered valley (ONERN, 1971a). In addition, it has easy, direct access to the highlands, a subject discussed later. The long lea River is extremely dry but today commercial irrigation in the valley has brought almost 31,000 ha under cultivation (ONERN, 1971b). The figure would have been significantly less in the prehispanic era, prior to massive land reclamation of the wide but marshy middle valley. The Rio Grande de Nazca drainage is exceptional because it is formed of many affluents with only one outlet to the sea, the Grande River itself. Yet this hydrology created no paradise. On the contrary, the system lacks the wide delta char acteristic of most of the other river valleys of the Peruvian coast and the valleys that comprise the Nazca drainage are so dry that Kosok (1965, p. 51) described them as "minute, isolated valleys that lie scattered over one of the world's driest deserts." Today there are only 12,920 ha of agricultural land (ONERN, 1971c, p. 181); the amount of land under cultivation would have been much less in the prehispanic era. Acari's headwaters lie immediately above the southern tributaries of the Grande river system, in the Lucanas highlands, whereas along the coast a distance of more than a hundred barren kilometers separates Acari from the southern Grande drainage. The Acari River is unusual in being one of the few coastal Peruvian rivers that flows all year. Although the valley has a limited amount of arable land, estimated at 1500 ha in 1954 (see Menzel and Riddell, 1986, p. 2), it does have a wide floodplain and a readily available source of irrigation water (ONERN, 1975). This ac counts for its early occupations. Immediately south of Acari is Yauca, the last south coast valley with a significant amount of irrigable land till Ocona, located approximately 180 km farther south. Yauca, then, is the periphery of the south coast archaeological culture area. South of Yauca the Andean foothills almost reach the seashore and form an elevated coastal plain. This region has a markedly different geographic and cultural character. Just as the Chilca-Mala-Asia triad of valleys can be considered a cultural frontier between the central and the south coast culture areas, with Canete as the great unknown between the two, so the tiny valleys? quebradas, really?between Yauca and Ocona form a radically different geocultural configuration separating the south and far south coast archae ological areas. The distances of separation between Chincha and the southernmost of the Nazca valleys are significantly less, either along the coast or by cross ing between valley necks, than between Chincha and Cahete and Cahete and Lurin. Over time the valley societies of the south coast came to interact more intensively, and as linkages among them became more diversified, greater socioeconomic complexity developed in the region.</page><page sequence="9">C/3 n o 5 ROWE'S RELATIVE CHRONOLOGY CULTURAL STAGE CHRONOLOGY Absolute dates B.P.

Comparison of stage chronology and period chronology for the south coast.</page><page sequence="10">104 Silverman Chronology and Chronological Considerations Many Peruvian archaeologists have recognized early/lower, middle, and late/upper divisions in the Formative Period (Fig. 3) corresponding to the pre-Chavin, Chavin, and immediately post-Chavin eras, respectively (e.g., Lumbreras, 1969, 1974a, b). Most recently, Kaulicke (1994) has proposed a five-part scheme for the Formative in which the early Initial Period is separated out as the Final Archaic (4000-3500 B.E), and the Formative epochs are called Early (3500-3000 B.P.), Middle (3000-2600 B.P), Late (2600-2400 B.P), Final (2400-2200 B.P) and Epiformative (2200-1900/1800 B.P), each corresponding to particular sites and suites of behavior and/or material culture correlates, but most poorly linked to absolute chronology and, indeed, relative cross-dating. Although he proposes his revised chro nology as a period scheme, it is, in fact, entirely stage based [although, as Kaulicke states (p. 547), he intends no evolutionist connotation]. The use of the term Formative is eschewed among U.S. Peruvianists as portraying a cultural developmental stage rather than a period of time (Rowe, 1967a) (Fig. 3). For those using the Formative terminology in the cultural developmental sense, the late division is particularly awkward since the regional societies and polities that emerged upon the collapse of the Chavin interaction sphere were organized in a distinctly non-Formative manner that augers the rise of strongly regional polities (e.g., Bennett and Bird, 1964, pp. 102-113; Burger, 1988, p. 143; Lumbreras 1974a, p. 81). Kaulicke (1994, pp. 503-576) recognizes this problem and proposes an Epi formative as the bridge between the Formative cultural configurations and the florescent regional polities of the Regional Developmental Period/Early Intermediate Period such as Mochica and Nasca. Lumbreras (1993, p. 64) states that the Chavin horizon is "contemporary with forms that, like Sali nar, already correspond to another epoch"?raising significant problems of cross-dating, chronological terminology, and culture process that must be resolved. In Rowe's (1967a) period scheme the Initial Period would correlate with the Early Formative and the Early Horizon to the Middle Formative. The Early Horizon is defined by Rowe as "the time from the first appear ance of Chavin influence at lea until polychrome slip painting replaces resin painting in that valley" (Rowe, 1967a, p. 10). Rowe's Early Horizon is prob lematic since it is a millenium-long period that encompasses the prehorizon Chavin and non-Chavin cultures, the horizon spread of Chavin art and ide ology, and post-Chavin cultural manifestations (specifically Paracas culture, as shown below). Burger (1981, 1988) has argued forcefully that Chavin indeed had a horizon-like pattern of behavior with geographically wide</page><page sequence="11">Formative Period on the South Coast of Peru 105 spread features existing for a relatively short period of time (ca. 2400-2200 B.P). There are two solutions to this conundrum of time and cultural proc ess. Because there is such a history of use for the two national chronological terminologies, either solution presents problems. One solution is to modify Rowe's period framework to put the horizon (Willey and Phillips, 1958, pp. 32-34) back in the Early Horizon. Thus, we would keep the term Initial Period for all those cultures contemporary with the block of time existing between the first appearance of pottery in the lea Valley and the appear ance of Chavm influence in lea (Rowe, 1967a). The Early Horizon would begin with the introduction of Janabarriu Chavm traits into the pottery of lea which, according to Burger (1988), correlates with Ocucaje 3 (see also Garcia Soto and Pinilla Blenke, 1995). The term Early Horizon would be reserved exclusively for the horizon manifestation of Chavm corresponding to Burger's Janabarriu phase, radiocarbon dated to ca. 2400-2200 B.P. (Bur ger, 1981). All societies contemporary with that block of time would be Early Horizon cultures, irrespective of their degree of integration in the Chavm phenomena. In lea, Ocucaje 1 and 2 (see Menzel et aL, 1964) would be removed from the Ocucaje ceramic sequence for lack of evidence (Massey, 1986; Burger 1988). Ocucaje 3 would be the Early Horizon Chavin-influenced style of lea. It is defined here as prior to the Paracas style of lea, which would encompass Ocucaje 8-9-10 and any post-Chavm earlier Paracas phases as may be demonstrated to exist (see below). The post-Chavm regional cultures currently in the Early Horizon would be shifted into the Early Intermediate Period, which now would be defined as beginning with the introduction of the Oculate Being in the lea Valley rather than with the introduction of slip-painted Nasca pottery as defined by Rowe (1967a). In lea the Early Intermediate Period thus would begin with Ocucaje 8, followed by Ocucaje 9, Ocucaje 10, and then the Nasca phases. The other solution is to use the term Early Formative for pottery using, pre-Chavm horizon cultures. Middle Formative would apply exclusively to the Chavin or Early Horizon. Late Formative would be used as a temporal rather than a cultural indicator for that period of time between the ap pearance of the Oculate Being and the shift to slip painting in Nasca 1. Although ultimately any decision of where to create a horizontal (tem poral factor) line break in a vertically organized (spatial factor) chrono logical chart is arbitrary and homogenizing (see Kubler, 1970), certainly the introduction or appearance of Oculate Being imagery in lea (the valley itself being an arbitrary choice as the anchor of the relative chronology for the vast Central Andean chronology) is more notable than the change in lea Valley ceramic technology from postfire applied resin pigments to pre</page><page sequence="12">106 Silverman CANETE Carmen A Trial Ceramic Sequence for the South Coast Early Horizon epoch 3 - Early Intermediate Period epoch 4 CHINCHA PISCO Carmen Carmen &amp; Nasca 4 PARACAS UPPER LOWER NAZCA SITES ICA ICA VALLEYS Nasca 4 Nasca 4 Nasca 4 Carmen Carmen Carmen &amp; Nasca 3 Carmen Nasca 3 Nasca 3 Quebrada B Quebrada A Campana Campana Campana?

The temporal reality of the intermediate Ocucaje ceramic phases (i.e., Ocucaje 4 through 7) in lea has been challenged on the basis of corre sponding absence of settlements (see DeLeonardis, 1991; Massey, 1986); the matter will be settled stratigraphically as excavations are conducted in the lea Valley. It is important to establish the lea Valley textile sequence that might fill the gap between Ica-Chavin (Ocucaje 3) and Paracas Cav ernas/Late Paracas/Ocucaje 8-9-10 (I return to this point below). At pre sent, Dawson's original four-phase T-l (equivalent to Ocucaje 7-8 in the upper valley), T-2 (equivalent to Ocucaje 8 in the lower valley), T-3 (equiva lent to Ocucaje 9), and T-4 (equivalent to Ocucaje 10) seriation of the Paracas pottery of lea (see Rowe, 1958) is essentially borne out because the Paracas style is post-Chavin (Garcia Soto and Pinilla Blenke, 1995). This same sequence was suggested by Sawyer (1964), who, in addition, clearly isolated an earlier, pre-Paracas, Chavinoid component of lea Valley pottery. In the present article I advocate a modified (as above) period termi nology as the lesser of two "evils" (see Lumbreras, 1981, pp. 21-24). I dis tinguish among pre-Chavin Horizon, Chavm Horizon, and post-Chavin Horizon cultures (Fig. 4). Since the lea Valley is used as the master column, the modified period scheme I propose here is advantageous because it clearly marks the Chavm Horizon, recognizes the importance of the Ocu late Being, and better reconnects Nasca to its Paracas antecedents. LATE PRECERAMIC DISPARITIES In the Late Preceramic Period (ca. 4500-3800 B.P.) monumental ar chitecture was constructed on the central and north coast of Peru and in adjacent north highland areas (see overviews in Burger, 1992; Donnan, 1985; Kaulicke, 1994; Moseley, 1975; Quilter, 1991). Some scholars have interpreted these remains as evidence of complex societies, organized on at least a chiefdom basis (Feldman, 1987; Moseley, 1975). Others have ar gued that construction of these buildings did not require a highly ranked social hierarchy but does indicate a larger social field involving multicom munity integration (e.g., Quilter, 1991). Regardless of one's classificatory evaluation of these structures, a dramatic jump in organizational complexity and change in worldview are implied by this early monumental architecture</page><page sequence="14">108 Silverman in comparison with the archaeological record of the preceding millenia. Mosele/s (1975) well-known assessment of the Late Preceramic Period as the time of the rise of Andean civilization remains yet more valid today, with an enlarged database, than it was 20 years ago when first proposed (see also Lanning, 1967, pp. 77-79). On the south coast few sites of the Late Preceramic Period are known and none is large or displays the architectural complexity of contemporary sites of the central and north coast or highlands. Rather, the Late Pre ceramic south coast sites are shell middens such as Otuma in Paracas (Engel, 1991, p. 131) and San Nicolas and Lomas south of Nazca (Strong, 1957, pp. 9-10), small villages of perishable huts such as Engel's (1991, pp. 69-83, 119) "Algodon y Jiquima," "La Pampa," and "Conchalito" sites be tween Pisco and Paracas, and the "Archaic Period" occupation at Cahuachi, dated to ca. 6500-6000 B.P., which consists of the foundations and wood posts of rudimentary structures (see Isla, 1990, pp. 78-79). In addition, Roger Robinson (personal communication, 1995) reports finding at Hacha two structures of low adobe walls with rounded corners, set with upright posts which probably supported a jacal-type construction. The floors of these structures "were imbedded with countless fragments of gourds, cord age, vegetable matting, and netting. Not one single ceramic sherd was found." The radiocarbon dates for these newly discovered contexts at Hacha exceed 5000 B.P and Robinson probably has found a preceramic occupation. Clearly south coast population at this time was small in size and dispersed over the landscape in order to take advantage of particular ecological niches and economic resources. A very special economic re source is obsidian, which, in the Central Andes, was used almost exclusively to make utilitarian artifacts, especially points (Burger and Asaro, 1993, p. 203). Obsidian from the great Quispisisa source in Huancavelica, the most widely distributed obsidian in the Central Andes (Burger and Asaro, 1993, p. 207), is present at San Nicolas and is interpreted by Burger and Asaro (1993, p. 208) as the result of highland-coast contact. INITIAL PERIOD DIVERGENCES During the Initial Period (ca. 3800-2400 B.P.), yet more and greater ceremonial edifices were constructed in the core region of the central and north coast and north highlands. Although debate on the level of sociopoli tical complexity represented by these sites continues (e.g., Haas 1982, 1987; S. Pozorski, 1987; Pozorski and Pozorski, 1987; versus Burger, 1992; Burger and Salazar-Burger, 1991), nevertheless, the cumulative cultural develop ment represented by and embodied in these public constructions cannot</page><page sequence="15">i I n I o 3 Er o e o o C/J O a o V?

These great sites were underwritten by stable populations practicing irrigation farming. Long-distance trade and/or exchange net works provided exotic goods such as obsidian and Spondylus shell. Shared principles of architectural design, most notably the U-shaped layout and sunken circular court, bear testimony to intersocietal communication and common beliefs, as does the contemporary public and portable art with its complex, representational iconography (e.g., Burger and Salazar-Burger, 1991; T Pozorski, 1975; Ravines and Isbell, 1975). Quilter (1991, p. 429) aptly speaks of the public display of authority and the monopolization of power by fewer corporate kin groups, i.e., the emergence of elites. The archaeological record from the south coast at this time shows no similarity to the cultural pattern just described. Rather, a handful of small habitation sites (see Fig. 5 for the location of major sites discussed in this article) and their associated ceramic complexes are known. These are ex amined below. Initial Period Styles and Sites of the South Coast The Initial Period archaeological record on the south coast begins with two isolated sites, Erizo and Mastodonte, which are shallow middens con taining early pottery, inadequately discussed and illustrated in the literature (Rowe, 1967b, pp. 26, 27; Pezzia, 1969, p. 68). The Carbon-14 dates for Erizo are 3890 B.P ? 90 years (GX-0185) and 3820 B.P ? 85 years (GX-0186) (Rowe, 1967b, p. 26). The Carbon-14 date for Mastodonte is 3745 B.P. ? 165 years (Rowe, 1967b, p. 27). Read within the parameters of one standard de viation, the dates from the two sites are statistically contemporary. Excavation at Erizo, in the Callango Basin in the lower lea Valley, recovered a few sherds in association with beans (Canavalia sp.), peanut {Arachis hypogaea), aji pepper (Capsicum sp.), guayaba (Psidium guajava), pacae (Inga sp.), and cotton (Gossypium barbadense); no maize was present. Obsidian from Quispisisa is present in Erizo (Burger and Asaro, 1993, p. 208), anticipating an intensive use of this material centuries later in lea and the Paracas region in Paracas times (see Burger and Asaro, 1993, pp. 204-205, chart 11). At Mastodonte, located in the desert plain of Villacuri betweeji Pisco and lea that, in the past, must have been watered by today's dry courses of the Rio Seco, excavation revealed a hearth containing a few sherds (Fig. 10) and vegetal remains including maize (Zea mays). Pezzia (1968, pp. 69 70) says that the Mastodonte pottery is more advanced than that of Erizo. According to him, Mastodonte's ceramic corpus includes a ring-based bowl, a trait that could relate Mastodonte to the Disco Verde and Hacha com</page><page sequence="17">Formative Period on the South Coast of Peru 111 plexes (see below; Fig. 10). The only published illustration of Mastodonte and Erizo pottery is found in Pezzia's (1968, Fotograbado II, 1969, mapa arqueologico pictografico) summaries. Robinson's (1986, 1994; Riddell and Valdez, 1987-1988) recent field work at Hacha has provided important new data on an already known but poorly understood site. Hacha is located 23 km from the sea, on a long sandy terrace above the Acari River. It covers an area measuring 800 x 200 m within which at least five structures of adobe or compressed clay have been identified, in addition to wattle-and-daub structures. The rest of the site is a scatter of sherds and other material remains including the stone hoes (hachas) that gave the site its name. Robinson reports a fair quantity of camelid and guinea pig remains and, perhaps, deer. Many small projec tile points litter the site surface and animal bone is sufficiently common as to suggest that a good percentage of the animal protein in the Hacha diet came from hunting. Marine fish and shellfish are more common than vegetal remains, which include cotton, gourd (Lagenaria siceraria), Lima beans (Phaseolus lunatus), squash (Cucurbita sp.), guayaba, peanut, aji pep per, achira (Canna edulis), sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas), and maize. Bur ger (1992, p. 103) indicates that heavy reliance on hunting and marine collecting and the abundant stone hoes and projectile points on the site surface are at variance with contemporary sites farther north along the coast, despite Hacha's typical agricultural inventory. The radiocarbon dates for Hacha are consistent and run between 3000 and 2700 B.P (Robinson, 1994, p. 15; see also Riddell and Valdez, 1987 1988, p. 7; Robinson, 1986, p. 7; Rowe, 1967b, p. 30). The dates are im portant in and of themselves as well as for the interpretation of the site's pottery. Robinson (1994) emphasizes that two ceramic complexes are pre sent at Hacha. One complex, Hacha 2 (Fig. 10), is the corpus from the site's surface that was known well before Robinson's fieldwork. This is the material that is canonized in the Peruvianist literature as an Initial Period complex and that has been the basis of several interpretations and com parisons about early pottery in the Central Andes (see, e.g., Chavez, 1977, pp. 1038-1041; Lanning, 1960, pp. 466-467). Hacha 2 is characterized by globular pots with and without necks, carinated bowls, bowls with beveled lips, and tall vases and bowls that have everted lips and ring bases. Of particular importance is the presence of bottles with short cylindrical spouts and handles; these are an early version of the classic double-spout-and bridge bottle, the later hallmark of south coast pottery. Decoration in the Hacha 2 corpus consists of polished red slip and designs made by the resist technique. There are also a few sherds that exhibit postfire resin painting (Lanning, 1961, p. 78) and incised designs surely related to Paracas pottery</page><page sequence="18">112 Silverman of the valleys farther north (see Riddell and Valdez, 1987/1988, Fig. 5c; Robinson, 1994, Figs. 14g, h). Rowe (1967b, p. 26) says that he recovered Hacha (Hacha 2) sherds at Erizo. Pezzia (1968, p. 68) states that Hacha (Hacha 2) and Erizo pottery are similar. Hacha 2 also shares features with earliest Pikicallepata and Marcavalle A of Cuzco and early Qaluyu of Puno (Chavez, 1977, pp. 1038 1041), Muyu Moqo of Andahuaylas (Grossman, 1983), and, especially, Disco Verde of Paracas on the basis of its resist decoration and ring bases (Lanning, 1960, pp. 466, 563-564; Garcia Soto and Pinilla Blenke, 1995). Robinson's (1994) Fig. 14 also reveals Hacha 2 similarities to the Tajo com plex of Nazca and to Paracas plainware (see Silverman, 1994). On a broader level, Lanning (1960, p. 563) indicates that Hacha and Disco Verde share with Initial Period coastal styles to the north three basic features: sand tempered brownware, red slip, and neckless globular jars. Hacha 1 (Fig. 10) is the newly defined subsurface complex of pottery at the Hacha site (Robinson, 1994, Fig. 17). The sample is limited but the presence of tall vases with convex and concave sides and ring bases can be recognized. Robinson (1994) argues that Hacha 1 is stylistically distinct from Hacha 2, though in his illustrations and descriptions I see significant continuity. However, Robinson (personal communication, 1995) indicates that "Hacha 1 ceramics are constructed of a softer paste, characterized by rectangular vessel shapes, and generally devoid of surface decoration." It is this Hacha 1 complex that is associated with the site's architecture and it is this pottery and architecture that dates to ca. 3000-2700 B.P. This in disputable association leaves the better-known and recently redefined Hacha 2 complex floating in time (i.e., without C-14 dates specifically as sociated with it) and space (i.e., on the surface of the site). As Robinson (1994, p. 17) recognizes, the temporal and spatial anchoring of Hacha 2 is now a major task. Disco Verde is a deeply stratified multicomponent habitation site on the west shore of Paracas Bay. The Disco Verde ceramic complex was found isolated in the lower 10 strata of the type-site and it appears mixed with pottery called Chavm and Paracas in an upper stratum (Engel, 1976, pp. 128-129, 1991, Fig. 106). The C-14 dates (Burger, 1988, Tkble 1) for the style are 2715 B.P. ? 60 years (NZ-685) and 2705 B.P. (V-900). Garcia Soto and Pinilla Blenke (1995) place the style between 3000 and 2800 B.P. on the basis of Paul's (1991, Table 1.1) presentation. This dating would make the style contemporary with Hacha 1. According to Lanning's (1960, pp. 460-461) definition, Disco Verde is characterized by neckless globular jars, bowls with round bases and with ring bases, and graters. Lanning (1960, p. 461) also mentions a bowl rim sherd with a stepfret profile. Although unillustrated, the sherd described is</page><page sequence="19">Formative Period on the South Coast of Peru 113 reminiscent of a published vessel from the nearby site of Puerto Nuevo on the east side of Paracas Bay (see Engel, 1966, p. 140) which itself is strongly similar to a north coast Cupisnique form published by Larco Hoyle (1945, p. 16). The short cylindrical spouts with handle on a Disco Verde resist decorated bottle (see Engel, 1966, p. 152, 1991, p. 78 lower) relate Disco Verde to Hacha 2 and to the contemporary La Ramada style of the far south coast Sihuas Valley, dated by Santos Ramirez (1980, p. 24) to 2830 2810 B.P. ? 100 years (HAM-861) and 2890 B.P. ? 80 years (HAM-863). Decoration in the Disco Verde style consists of a single or double row of small stamped circles, incised lines, resist-painted zigzags, stepfrets and large circular dots, and the use of a yellow resin applied after firing in combination with diagonal parallel lines below the lip. Menzel (1971, pp. 22-23) indicates that she, J. H. Rowe, and L. E. Dawson found two sherds in the upper lea Valley (Fig. 10) that are comparable to Disco Verde in being unoxidized brown bowls with small stamped circular dots decorating the exterior rim. In addition, a crude small tapering bottle with incised lines and punctate incisions (Menzel et ai, 1964, plate lb; Fig. 10) is ac tually several centuries older than the Ocucaje 3 materials with which it is lumped and may be compared to bottles in T C. Patterson's unpublished late Initial Period collections from Ancon (Burger, 1988, p. 107). Pezzia (1969, p. 63) states that the bottle came from Cerro Cordero at the neck of the lea Valley but a specific context is not indicated in the text. The multicomponent Puerto Nuevo site was first reported by Engel (1966) but is only now receiving the recognition it deserves. Garcia Soto and Pinilla Blenke (1995) have noted the extraordinary postfire painted and elaborately decorated sherds recovered by Engel (1966, Fig. 40; see also Garcia Soto and Pinilla Blenke, 1995, Figs. 4-6; Kauffmann Doig, 1973, Fig. 315) (Fig. 10) from the Puerto Nuevo phase occupation. In ad dition, there are resist designs and ring bases that are a continuation from Disco Verde antecedents. The published dates for the Puerto Nuevo style are 2620 B.P. ? 60 years (NZ-877) and 2609 B.P. (V-899) (see Burger, 1988, Table 1). Garcia Soto and Pinilla Blenke place the style between 2800 and 2600 B.P. on the basis of Engel's (1966, p. 135) comment that the style is "slightly younger than" Disco Verde, their interpretation of Paul's (1991, Figs. 1 and 2, Table 1.1) presentation of south coast dates, and because the style clearly antedates the Janabarriu Chavin horizon.

Disco Verde in its ecological context. The site descends to the beach from the houses in the background. the valleys located farther north. Rather, at this time south coast peoples lived in small groups close to their basic resources. There is no evidence of artificial irrigation. Instead, existing water resources were exploited. Thus, the early pottery sites at Callango and the Pampa de Villacuri are explained by the presence of springs, which also permitted cultivation of food crops (Figs. 6 and 7). Engel (1991, p. 126) has noted the presence of fresh water at Disco Verde, which made possible permanent exploitation of the rich marine resources of Paracas Bay (Fig. 8). Puerto Nuevo was particularly favorably located to exploit the sea and a large zone of eco nomically important swamps and marshes, the product of a high water table and runoff from the Pisco River (Engel, 1991, p. 64) (Fig. 9). The pre Chavin Cordero Alto bottle and Disco Verde-like sherds in the upper lea Valley probably correspond to small sites that exploited the more readily available water at the valley neck; whether a comparably early occupation exists in the middle lea Valley remains to be determined. The Hacha settlers practiced agriculture on the seasonally self-irrigat ing Acari River floodplain adjacent to the site, using stone hoes. The com mon presence of marine resources, noted above, again can be indicated. In addition, obsidian is common at Hacha. Most is sourced to Quispisisa but there is a unique second type at the site (Burger and Asaro, 1993, p. 216). Perhaps Acari peoples traveled to the highlands to obtain obsidian</page><page sequence="22">116 Silverman a Fig. 9. Puerto Nuevo in its ecological context, (a) The site is located along the shore, (b) in an area where freshwater lagoons existed until 50 years ago. This part of the figure is created on the basis of Johnson's (1930, Fig. 151) reproduction of an 1865 map of the town of Pisco and its port. That map has been redrawn and reoriented here. The map is aligned with Johnson's (1930, Fig. Ill) photograph of San Andres, a fishing village. The importance of these images is that they show the presence of "lagunas" of the kind Engel (1991, p. 64) indicates at Puerto Nuevo, only 5.5 km farther south. Puerto Nuevo was situated to exploit a large zone of economically important swamps and marshes, the product of a high water table and runoff from the Pisco River. This ecological niche was intermittent but quite extensive and remnants can still be observed today and figure on modern Peruvian topographic maps. directly or maybe they exchanged their coastal products with highland herd ers who migrated transhumantly with their camelids. The evidence of the existence of a unique second obsidian at Hacha adds to the peculiarities of the site noted by Burger (1992, p. 103). Rowe (1963, p. 5) describes Hacha as an urban center. But his ascription is based on criteria of urbanism that differ radically from those used by other scholars (see discussion in Silverman, 1988, pp. 404-408). Hacha is a domestic site with an encapsulated ceremonial-communal function in the form of a complex of rooms, one built on a raised platform, and one with a relatively large central hearth around which are benches; this complex is associated with a wall decorated with a procession of camelids (see Riddell and Valdez, 1987-1988, pp. 8-9) (Fig. 10). At present, this is the earliest public/ceremonial architecture on the south coast. Though notable, the Hacha context compares poorly with the contemporary, well-planned, monumental ceremonial archi tecture of the central and north coast (see Burger, 1992).</page><page sequence="23">? e O o ^^^^ ^VR^^^^^^^^^^^gaEH _ acequia lagunas ^7 \ 1 PISCO Fig. 9.

Nevertheless, obsidian from Quispisisa moved widely among these early culture areas in the Initial Period (see Burger and Asaro, 1993). Burger and Asaro (1993, p. 209) ar gue for direct communication between the coast and the highlands in the Initial Period that included the exchange of various exotic goods, notably obsidian. This long-distance exchange network explains the ceramic simi larities noted above. Whereas these ceramic similarities locate the south coast in the Initial Period in a southern Peruvian interaction sphere, the wide distribution of Quispisisa obsidian potentially gives greater scale to the exchange and intercommunication network. Within this world, the Pisco-Paracas region (exemplified by Disco Verde and Puerto Nuevo) ap pears to have exercised a particularly privileged role, perhaps because Para cas Bay has such a bounty of easily collected marine resources and because the Pisco Valley is the natural route of communication between the coast and Quispisisa. And maybe Pisco-Paracas benefited from the geomorphol ogy of the Paracas Peninsula which, by jutting out into the Pacific, breaks what otherwise would have been a continous littoral route of communica tion, perhaps making the coastwise exchange of goods stop at this point, to be controlled by this area's residents. In this scenario it becomes possibly understandable that Puerto Nuevo was in seemingly direct contact with Cupisnique peoples of the north coast to judge from the presence of an actual Cupisnique trade piece at Puerto Nuevo [the incised stirrup-spout bottle illustrated by Engel (1991, Fig. 80)], the shared stepfret flat-based bowl form [compare Engel (1966, Fig. D-2, to Larco Hoyle, 1941, Fig. 75)], and distinctively northern iconographic ele ments present on Puerto Nuevo vessels [see Garcia Soto and Pinilla Blenke (1995); compare their Figs. 6a-d to Larco Hoyle (1941, Fig. 212, 1945, p. 9, bottom left) and Alva (1986, Fig. 67a); Kauffmann Doig (1983, p. 266, Fig. 5) and Alva (1986, Figs. 170a, 230a); Larco Hoyle (1941, Fig. 92) and Alva (1986, Fig. 170a); and Larco Hoyle (1945, p. 9, top right) and Alva (1986, Fig. 75), respectively]. A resin-painted and incised bottle fragment (Tello, 1929, Fig. 80, 1959, lamina IIC) from the backdirt of a caverna on Cerro Colorado at Paracas either is a Puerto Nuevo imitation of a Cupis nique vessel or is an actual trade piece, possibly from Jequetepeque (com pare to Kaulicke, 1994, Fig. 592). What exactly the large and complex Cupisnique society(ies) wanted with and of the small Puerto Nuevo site,</page><page sequence="26">120 Silverman and/or vice versa, remains to be determined beyond my vague speculation above, unless Puerto Nuevo is an actual Cupisnique port-of-trade. THE EARLY HORIZON The highland ceremonial center of Chavin de Huantar flourished in the Initial Period and Early Horizon and its canonized art style spread over much of the Central Andes (Burger, 1984, 1992; Kaulicke, 1994). During its horizon aspect entire traditions of pottery making are said to change as Chavin traits were adopted (Burger, 1992, pp. 214-215; Lanning 1960, pp. 196, 205-206). In the north highlands new temples were erected atop older ones [e.g., at Pacopampa, Kuntur Wasi, Kotosh, La Pampa (see Burger, 1992, pp. 190-191)]. Chavin is best interpreted as a powerful religious cult (Burger 1988, 1992; for alternative interpretations see Kaulicke, 1994 ). Among some of the societies that participated in the Chavin sphere of interaction-?par ticularly those of the north coast and north highlands?there was pro nounced socioeconomic or social differentiation as seen in highly ranked burial patterns [e.g., as at Kuntur Wasi (see Onuki, 1995)] and portable (ownable) objects of value, particularly gold (Burger, 1988, pp. 130-131; Onuki, 1995). The situation on the south coast was quite different. Chavin on the South Coast Burger (1988, p. 110) states that Chavin influence arrived on the south coast before the formation of the Paracas style, a position more fully elabo rated by Garcia Soto and Pinilla Blenke (1995). He argues that the Paracas style was born of the combination of local, non-Chavm traits with intrusive Janabarriu-Chavin features (Burger, 1988, p. 135; Wallace 1962, p. 313). Garcia Soto and Pinilla Blenke's (1995) reassessment of Engel's Puerto Nuevo material leads to the convincing argument that Puerto Nuevo is the source of local, pre-Chavin influence on the nascent Paracas style. Chavin influence on the south coast is manifested at Independence Bay in the Karwa textile cache (Cordy-Collins, 1976) and its associated pot tery, which Garcia Soto and Pinilla Blenke (1995) call the Karwas phase (Burger, 1992, Fig. 203; Garcia Soto and Pinilla Blenke, 1995, Figs. 8 and 9) (Fig. 10). Karwa is located 50 km due west of the middle lea Valley. Garcia Soto and Pinilla Blenke (1995) suggest that the spectacular Karwa materials came from a great U-shaped temple at the site (see Bridges, 1991, p. 52) which, if they are correct, would be the only pre-Paracas example of monumental architecture known on the south coast of Peru (since the</page><page sequence="27">Formative Period on the South Coast of Peru 121 encapsulated ceremonial focus at Hacha is not on this physical or interre gional scale). Burger (1988, pp. 117-123, 1992, pp. 195-198) has argued that a branch of the Chavin cult existed in lea or Karwa. Thus far, published survey and excavation results have identified only five sites in the lea Valley contemporary with the Chavin occupation at Karwa. These sites are the Cerrillos midden in the upper lea Valley (Wal lace, 1962) and four sites in Callango whose main occupations, as currently known, appear to be Paracas (DeLeonardis, 1991). These sites have Ocu caje 3/Cerrillos phase pottery (Donnan, 1992, Fig. 59; Menzel et al, 1964; Sawyer, 1966, Fig. 93; Wallace 1962) (Fig. 10). Several Karwa-like Chavin style-influenced textiles, said to be from Samaca and Callango, both oases in the lower valley, have been published (Brugnoli and Hoces 1991; Burger, 1992, Fig. 211; Rowe, 1962, Figs. 29 and 30). Their precise context is sci entifically unknown. Two radiocarbon dates have been published for Ocucaje 3 pottery from Cerrillos: 2408 B.P. ? 214 years [P-516 (cited by Rowe 1967b, p. 30)] and 2685 ? 140 [GX-1345 (cited by Paul, 1991, Table 1.1)]. As such, Ocucaje 3 appears earlier than as well as contemporary with Burger's (1981, 1988, 1992) Janabarriu phase. The earlier Cerrillos date, for which, unfortunately, no context is given, is consistent with dates cited for Puerto Nuevo, the antecedent phase, which had strong contacts with north coast Cupisnique culture. We may contemplate the possibility that that which has been iden tified as Chavin influence in Ocucaje 3 (see Burger, 1988) was, in fact, Cupisnique in origin, and arrived in lea prior to the Janabarriu phase, either via a direct maritime or territorially discontinuous coastal route [it is potentially significant that Wallace (1962, p. 313; see Engel, 1956, Fig. 9E) identified a Cerrillos sherd in the Chavin collection from Curayacu on the central coast] or via the Ayacucho highlands (see Ochatoma et ai, 1984), if the latter is not the result of north coast influence via lea. In this light, I call attention to a proto-staff god engraved on a pre-Chavin stone bowl from Lambayeque (see Bischof, 1994, Fig. 12c) whose shell breasts anticipate the eccentric eye breasts of the Karwa (contemporary with Ocu caje 3) staff goddess (see Burger, 1988, Fig. 4.9). Chavin influence is significantly weaker in the other valleys of the south coast. In Chincha, Lanning (1960, pp. 414-417) identified a "Chavinoid" style called Pozuelo. In the Pisco Valley proper Chavin-influenced pottery has not yet been identified. In the Rio Grande de Nazca drainage, Chavin influence is represented by a single petroglyph at the Chichiktara site in Palpa (Silver man, 1991, p. 374, Fig. 9.12) and by a diagnostic Ocucaje 3 (i.e., Janabarriu related) bowl from Juncumayo, just outside the town of Nazca (Silverman, 1991, Fig. 9.10). Both are more likely to be the result of lea Valley influence than any direct or significant contact of Nazca with the Chavin cult, except</page><page sequence="28">122 Silverman as it was present in lea. Tajo, the pre-Nasca ceramic style of the Rio Grande de Nazca drainage, has a series of general traits suggesting contemporaneity with Ocucaje 3 (and thus Janabarriu), in addition to those features which date it to Ocucaje 8 and later (Silverman, 1994) (Fig. 10). This brief review of the Early Horizon on the south coast indicates a significant poverty of Chavin influence outside the Ica-Karwa corridor. But we must bear in mind the paucity of sites and excavation at these sites dating to this time period and recognize the intensity of Ica-Karwa's par ticipation in the Chavin world as manifested in the complex, canonical Chavin iconography of the painted textiles. Yet, at present and subject to change as a result of more fieldwork, it appears correct to say that beyond Ica-Karwa the south coast was quite peripheral to the northern heartland of the Chavm horizon, to the close interaction between the north coast and the north highlands, and to the culturally and sociopolitically more complex configuration of that region. Within this scenario it is important to indicate that the distribution and volume of Quispisisa obsidian in creased in the Early Horizon, including on the south coast, and this indi cates continued or strengthened ties of the south coast with the highlands (see Burger and Asaro, 1993, p. 229). Much fieldwork is needed to eluci date and correctly date south coast cultural dynamics during the Chavin Horizon and to establish the local context into which Chavin intruded, for, at present, this context is virtually unknown. THE POST-CHAVIN REORGANIZATION Cultural development on the south coast, as elsewhere in the Central Andes following the collapse of the Chavin integration, was so rapid and, in the case of the south coast, so different from what preceded it that it is difficult to explain. I propose that a conjuncture of simultaneous and consequent factors contributed to a suite of sudden cultural consequences on the south coast that resulted in the dramatic jump in cultural complexity that is evident in much of the region upon the decline of Chavin and that we recognize as the regional variants of the south coast's first regional cul ture, Paracas. The factors leading to the emergence of cultural complexity on the south coast include the following. (1) The contact that lea sustained in the Early Horizon with a larger Central Andean world promoted intravalley, intervalley, and long-distance intercultural interaction and thereby enlarged lea's social, economic, and political field. (2) lea's intensive contact with the Chavin cult in the Early Horizon promoted the development of incipient elites in preferential positions for the control and exploitation of ideological and economic exchange (par ticularly of exotic goods).</page><page sequence="29">Formative Period on the South Coast of Peru 123 (3) With the decline of the Chavin interaction sphere new social and economic space was opened for experimentation which, in lea, led to the further consolidation of socioeconomic differences among the population (either within the previously existing elite groups or their replacement by others) and the emergence of new elites elsewhere on the south coast. In particular, contact between lea's Paracas people and the Yaya-Mama peo ple of the Lake Titicaca Basin may be noted. (4) The notable climatological changes that occurred in the Central Andes at the end of the Chavin Horizon (Elera et ai, 1992; Grodzicki, 1990; Ortlieb and Marchare, 1992) caused population movements, popula tion pressure, intergroup conflict, and economic intensification. These fac tors also promoted the emergence of elites. (5) Concomitantly, there was population growth on the south coast. It is possible, following Kaulicke (1994, pp. 565, 576), that this was pro moted by adoption or development of more productive maize agriculture. So far, excavation data are lacking for Paracas sites, though in the imme diately succeeding Nasca culture maize was a major food crop (Silverman, 1993, pp. 289-293). Regardless, the archaeological record of the south coast shows population growth, pressure, migration, and colonization. In some areas this was sufficient to cause intergroup conflict and economic inten sification, these spheres of activity likewise providing opportunities for status-seeking individuals and groups. Ica as a Case Study Paracas culture coalesced in the Ica Valley in Ocucaje 8 times, follow ing the non-Paracas Ocucaje 3 Chavin phase (see discussion above con cerning hypothetical intermediate Paracas ceramic and textile phases in Ica). As problematic as the interpretation of radiocarbon measurements may be, given the settlement pattern evidence arguing against the temporal reality of the intervening Ocucaje stylistic phases, i.e., those between Ocu caje 3 and Ocucaje 7 ("Cerrillos phase") or Ocucaje 8 (see DeLeonardis, 1991; Massey, 1986), it is probably very significant that the two published dates for the Isla or Ocucaje 7 phase at Cerrillos are 2302 B.P. ? 125 years [P-517 (cited by Paul, 1991, Table 1.1)] and 2302 B.P. ? 64 years [P-518 (cited by Paul, 1991, Table 1.1.)], i.e., statistically contemporary with and slightly later than Ocucaje 3 (see above). The Ocucaje 8 population and settlement pattern are large in size and complexity compared to the known Ocucaje 3 situation. Indeed, there appears to be a veritable colonization of new lands as, for instance, the entire length of the Callango Basin was occupied (Massey, 1991, p. 321). In Callango no fewer than 14 Ocucaje 8 sites have been identified (Massey</page><page sequence="30">124 Silverman 1986, pp. 276, 278-279; DeLeonardis, 1991, pp. 126-190) in addition to the regional center at Animas Bajas which Massey (1991, pp. 321) describes as 60 ha in size, composed of "seven rectangular mound structures and several long earthen elevations covered with the foundations of small adobe buildings and abundant habitation refuse." Other contemporary sites, some of them quite large, are known to exist elsewhere in the valley, notably in the Ocucaje Basin, in the Paraya narrows between Ocucaje and the south ern end of the middle valley, and at Cerro Prieto at the north end of the middle valley (Massey, 1986, 1991; Menzel et al., 1964, pp. 101-104; Wil liams and Pazos, 1974). In addition, there is a scatter of other, smaller Ocucaje 8 habitation sites and cemeteries throughout the entire length of the valley (Menzel et al., 1964, pp. 101-104). Massey (1991) interprets the Ocucaje 8 settlement pattern as indicating small chiefdoms or ranked so cieties (see also DeLeonardis, 1991). The lower valley sites are, in general, on the oasis floodplain. However, there are several lea Valley sites that break this pattern. One large ("several kilometers long") hilltop site called PV62-74, west of Santa Lucia at the southern tip of the middle valley, is described by Menzel et al (1964, p. 104; Menzel, 1971, p. 78) as fortified: "construction of embankments and fortifications . . . made of vegetal materials and hard clay, giving a very firm consistency." In addition to PV62-74, various of these large Ocucaje 8 habitation sites are on the west side of the valley on steep hillsides or at the very top of hills, as if defense were a consideration; they are said to have fortifications (Menzel, 1971, p. 79). In the late 1950s the allegedly fortified Ocucaje 8 sites were considered "the most ancient and largest populations" of this type known in the Cen tral Andes (Menzel, 1971, pp. 78-79). The statement is perplexing since Willey's (1953) intensive survey of the north coast Viru Valley already had revealed the existence of various large Salinar sites, including fortified "hill top redoubts" and smaller "hilltop platforms," presumably contemporary with these lea Valley settlements. In all, Willey identified 83 Salinar sites, most of which were concentrated at the valley neck. Indeed, both the lea Valley investigators and Willey had accumulated the first systematic settle ment pattern evidence of a major reorganization of the Central Andean social and geopolitical landscape following the disintegration of the Chavin cult, what had earlier been recognized as a widespread shift in ceramic art called the "white-on-red horizon" (Bennett and Bird, 1964, pp. 102-113; Kroeber, 1944, p. 110; Willey, 1948). The earliest synthesis of this cultural reorganization was presented in the original 1949 edition of Bennett and Bird's Andean Culture History. It is within this context that significant contact between lea Valley peo ples and the bearers of the Yaya-Mama religious tradition living in the Lake</page><page sequence="31">Formative Period on the South Coast of Peru 125 Titicaca Basin began, continuing into the next two lea Valley phases [Ocu caje 9 and 10 (see Chavez 1988, p. 21)] and, ultimately, Nasca 1 (see Chavez and Chavez, 1975; Rowe, 1971, p. 118). Chavez's (1988, p. 2) chronological table proposes an absolute date of 2500-2100 B.P. for the Yaya-Mama style. The complex shared iconographic similarities that were noted by Sergio and Karen Chavez 20 years ago, when they used them to cross-date their recently discovered altiplano style, are so important that they are cited here. The stylized scroll-like figures present on all four faces of the Yaya-Mama stela . . . are similar to rayed head motifs which appear on textiles from Paracas on the coast. This head motif with scroll or recurved ray appendages occurs on south coast textiles from Early Horizon Epoch 8 to Early Intermediate Period Epoch 3. . . . Squared faces with paired recurved-ray appendages can also be seen on a Paracas 9 or early 10 (10A) textile from Paracas Cavernas. ... Oval faces with pairs of recurved rays alternating with pairs of straight appendages occur on a headband from the Yacovleff-Muelle excavations at Paracas Cavernas... and are probably Paracas 9 as is a much more stylized motif on a head band from the same locality. . . . Very similar to the former is a headband from Ocucaje which has the same face elements with alternating paired scroll and straight appendages. . . . Yet another similar motif on a carrying bag from Paracas is illustrated by Engel. . . . which he places in his Period II dated by him to either 200 B.C.-A.D. 200 or to 300-100 B.C., probably Paracas 9 in style. Another Paracas textile shows, again, a similar head with paired recurved rays belonging to Paracas 9. . . . Two final examples also show similarities to the Yaya-Mama style head element. One is from a Paracas textile illustrated by Engel . . . having the motif repeated four times .... The second example is from a gauze weave textile from a Paracas Necropolis grave .... Similar head motifs with rayed appendages occur on Recuay pottery and stone sculpture in the north highlands of Peru. Tne two ramiform motifs on faces B and D of the Yaya-Mama stela, below the feet of the anthropomorphic figures, having on face B sets of two branching appendages and on face D profile animal heads, have no known parallels in the sculpture of the altiplano that we are aware of. Again, a similarity can be observed to motifs from Paracas iconography, although derived from only one example. A similar motif occurs on a pyroengraved gourd from Ocucaje, lea ... the motif most closely resembling that on face D of the Yaya-Mama stela. The gourd probably is Paracas 9. A very remotely similar motif occurs on a Paracas textile turban having stylized snakes. . . . (Chavez and Chavez, 1975, pp. 64-65) The shared motifs can be seen in the Chavezes' illustrations and can be lumped largely as a shared rayed face, interpreted by King (1965a, p. 330, Fig. 76, 1965b, Fig. 7) as a stylized sun face. While the examples are not as numerous nor the context as specific as the Karwa-Chavin connection, still this is no mere case of diffusion or adoption as a casual by-product of long-distance exchange relationships. This iconography is ideologically and cosmologically charged in lea and the altiplano. I think it is highly significant that this iconography occurs on textiles in lea (an Ocucaje Basin provenience is typically given) and carved stone sculptures from a manifestly religious context in the Lake Titicaca Basin. It would not be far-fetched to see in this iconographic identity?for indeed,</page><page sequence="32">126 Silverman the similarities noted by the Chavezes are strong enough to be so labeled? an earlier version of the contact that may later have occurred between Wari and Tiwanaku, which Menzel (1964, p. 67) hypothesized to involve "men from the area of Ayacucho and Huari who learned the new religion abroad and brought it home." In such a scenario textiles, as a portable medium and one imbued with high status, could have been an important vehicle for transmisson. I suggest that the Yaya-Mama Religious Tradition was the donor of this iconography. How the actual contact occurred?either directly between lea and the altiplano or via the valleys yet farther south along the coast (perhaps between Acari and Sihuas)?and why have yet to be estab lished. What makes this shared iconography even more important is the possibility that at this time lea Valley peoples spoke a Jaqi language (Hard man, 1978), as did those people living farther south along the coast and in the highlands to the Lake Titicaca Basin (see Hardman, 1978; Parker, 1969, p. 71, inter alia). Indeed, Torero (1964) suggests that the heartland of this language family was in the Departments of Apurimac, Cuzco, and the northeast portion of Arequipa. According to Rowe (1963, p. 9), Ocucaje 9 times saw the abrupt nu cleation of the previously dispersed Ocucaje 8 population into a "few very large urban settlements." The major sites of the period are now discussed in terms of their function in lea Valley society and the information they convey about sociopolitical dynamics and culture process in the region. As Rowe (1963, p. 9) suggests and as Massey's (1986, 1991) survey and excavations confirm, Animas Altas replaced Animas Bajas as the major habitation and ceremonial site. It is located only 500 m to the northeast of Animas Bajas in ail exposed position, but Massey (1991, pp. 323, 328) argues that its west side was defended by a large wall of alternating layers of earth fill and vegetal fiber faced with adobe. A single wall in an open plain would be poor defense, and the claim of fortification at Animas Altas must be reassessed. Among the site's 15 small adobe mounds was at least one with an iconographically elaborate supernatural frieze (Massey, 1991, Fig. 8.4). Massey interprets this and other mounds as temples or public buildings. Habitation refuse extended continuously and densely over an area more than a kilometer across. Massey identifies Animas Altas as the largest Ocucaje 9 site in the entire valley with an area estimated at 100 ha. The monumental Oculate Being imagery at Animas Altas corresponds to an increased frequency and wider distribution of the Oculate Being at this time (Menzel et ai, 1964, p. 175). Darrell Gundrum's recent mapping of Tajahuana, undertaken to de limit the site for the Instituto Nacional de Cultura-Ica, reveals that the site is larger and more complex than described by Rowe (1963, p. 9) and illus trated by Williams (1980, pp. 466-468; Williams and Pazos, 1974), yet not</page><page sequence="33">Formative Period on the South Coast of Peru 127 necessarily fortified. Rather, Gundrum (1995) has identified many more walls at the site and determined that most of these enclose space, and are associated with plazas and mounds, arid many mounds align with geoglyphs, natural features, and contemporary sites on the landscape visible from Ta jahuana's dominant position. Gundrum (1995) suggests that Tajahuana was a major habitation and civic-ceremonial site in a cultural landscape of other related sites. Indeed, Menzel (1971, p. 81) had already attributed a cere monial function to a dual structure at the site and had noted the presence of geoglyphs. But Menzel (1971, pp. 81-82) largely dismissed the ceremo nial aspects of both Tajahuana and Animas Altas (even while recognizing that sites such as Animas Bajas and Animas Altas could have existed in the repetitively flooded bottomland of the middle valley and been long since destroyed by subsequent occupations). She emphasized, instead, the appearance of trophy head iconography and abundance of obsidian pro jectile points at Ocucaje 9 sites. She speculated that the bellic theater as sumed to be represented in the Ocucaje 8 settlement pattern was enlarged in Ocucaje 9 times. If Gundrum's preliminary assessment of Tajahuana is correct, however, then the nature of Tajahuana and other walled sites will have to be reassessed. Furthermore, contrary to Rowe's portrayal of a valley population tak ing refuge in a few large fortified sites, analysis of the published lea Valley settlement pattern data reveals that various small Ocucaje 9 sites coexisted with the large ones noted by Rowe (see Massey, 1991, pp. 323-329; Menzel, 1971, p. 80; Menzel et ai, 1964, pp. 177-178). While these other sites do not lessen the nucleation evident at Animas Altas and, especially, Taja huana, the two largest sites of the lea Valley at this time, they should make us reassess their function and interpretation. A debate exists over the cause of population nucleation and perceived site fortification in Ocucaje 8 and, especially, Ocucaje 9 times, and sub sequent population dispersion and defortification (if sites were fortified in the first place) in Ocucaje 10. External and internal factors are claimed. Menzel (1971, p. 81) sees the Ocucaje 9 fortified sites as similar to the Ocucaje 8 ones, although Tajahuana is considered "somewhat more elabo rated in its construction and also has a good sized temple structure that is not found associated with the sites corresponding to the previous epoch." The ubiquity of broken obsidian projectile points over the surface of Ani mas Altas and other Callango sites, the frequency of shallow graves in the adobe architecture of Animas Altas, and the sudden abandonment of Ani mas Altas led Massey (1986, p. 301, 1991, p. 345, 1992, p. 222) to contend that Callango was militarily conquered by Ocucaje Basin peoples. Menzel and Massey, then, would appear to see internal lea Valley cultural dynamics as provoking the changes in the Ocucaje 8 and 9 archaeological record.</page><page sequence="34">128 Silverman Wallace (1985, p. 92,1986), on the other hand, argues for an external prime mover. He posits that an early (in Ocucaje 9 times) hostile Topara intrusion into lea caused the changes in settlement pattern noted by other scholars, an intrusion that continued over several generations till stopped, in his model, by a Nasca 3 conquest state (see also Massey, 1992; versus Silver man, 1993). In Ocucaje 10 times, another significant reorganization of lea's popu lation occurred as Animas Altas and other sites were abandoned, Ocucaje's population grew, Tajahuana's population was greatly reduced, and middle valley population concentrated in small sites at the southern extreme of this sector and at Tacaraca, and in the upper valley around Cordero Alto, Cerrillos, and Yancay (Massey, 1991, p. 329; Menzel 1971, p. 83; Menzel et aL, 1964, pp. 209-210). There were now a large number of small sites, no fortified sites, and no single large regional center. This situation led Massey to reconstruct a less complex sociopolitical arrangement in Ocucaje 10 than had existed in Ocucaje 9 times. She argues that the upper lea Valley was never well integrated into the lower and middle valley social and economic sphere. In her model, it would be into this power vacuum that Topara influence (presumably from Pisco, the closest valley) entered the lea Valley, probably extending its way down from the upper valley. Whether Topara influence in Ocucaje 10 times was the result of se lective intercultural contact among elites (Massey, 1992, p. 223) or the re sult of severe Topara pressure or even conquest of at least the upper lea Valley by Ocucaje 9 times (Wallace, 1985, p. 92, 1986) is debated, as well as the intensity of Topara in lea and the reality of a Topara state (Silverman, 1991). At present, there are insufficient data to resolve the matter. Ceramic collections from the upper lea Valley need to be restudied, much more excavation is needed in the lea Valley, and a massive investigation of Topara in all of its native valleys must be undertaken to understand that social formation. Paracas Occupations in Other Valleys of the South Coast In Chincha, Paracas society is said to be manifested by a series of large, artificial mounds in the lower valley. Canziani (1992) studied existing cuts in the mounds and surface evidence was used to date the architecture. My only hesitation with Canziani's fine work is the lack of published tables and plans showing the association of pottery and the mounds. The expe rience of Fernando Herrera and the author at Alto del Molino, in the lower Pisco Valley, has indicated that earlier pottery is often present in the fill or adobes of later constructions. For the Paracas Cavernas occupation in</page><page sequence="35">Formative Period on the South Coast of Peru 129 Chincha, what is being called Paracas in this article [equivalent to Ocucaje (7?), 8, 9, and 10 in lea], the only evidence of contemporaneity between a Paracas ceramic phase and a monumental construction is a single sherd in a cut at Pyramid 25 in the lower valley Soto Complex (Canziani, 1992, p. 93) and Paracas midden found in the profile of a canal near the Por tachuelo mound at the valley neck. Whether Portachuelo is contemporary with that domestic occupation (Canziani, 1992, p. 108) or built on top of it needs to be determined through excavation, although the layout of the mound conforms to the lower valley pattern if, indeed, those mounds are Paracas in date. The Paracas occupation of the middle Chincha Valley is not in doubt for Wallace's (1971) survey and L. Lumbreras' (cited in Canziani, 1992, pp. 104-108) survey and excavations demonstrate the presence of a Pinta-phase occupation, the local manifestation of Paracas Cavernas. The positioning of these sites at the valley neck indicates exploitation of more easily ac cessible river water for irrigation agriculture (see Moseley, 1974, p. 79). At Chococota there are low mounds which Canziani (1992, p. 104) identifies as public or communal in nature. There is a platform mound at Cerro del Gentil (the Pinta type-site) whose layout is similar to that of the Chococota mounds in being low, rectangular and oriented E-W. Traces of fieldstones near the mound suggest that a population lived around the public building. These sites are located on a sedimentary bluff, 10-15 m above the valley bottom. Clearly the goal in site placement was to not use valuable agricul tural land for construction. Canziani (1992, p. 114) argues that complex social structures existed in Chincha in Paracas times (for him, Cavernas and Necropolis); he uses the terms urban and incipiently stratified. He sees continuity between the Paracas Cavernas and the Paracas Necropolis social formations and argues that this society was the source of the great funerary bundles in the Wari Kayan Necropolis on the Paracas Peninsula. In Pisco, Peters (1987-1988) has indicated the existence of a major Paracas occupation at the large, agglutinated site of Chongos, in addition to the immediately subsequent Chongos-phase Topara occupation. Exqui site, postfire, resin-painted masks depicting the Oculate Being are said to come from Chongos (Lapiner, 1976, Figs. 146, 148, 150); their imagery is readily comparable to that on Ocucaje 8 pottery (see Menzel et ai, 1964, Fig. 43c). Paracas pottery also has been found in small quantity at Alto del Molino, west of Chongos, in two test pits, and in a nearby Chongos phase Topara habitation zone, but the occupation corresponding to the sherds has not yet been located (Silverman, 1995). In addition to these lower valley sites, Engel (1957) discovered several small Paracas habitation sites in the upper Pisco Valley, on the hillsides above Tambo Colorado.</page><page sequence="36">130 Silverman Wallace (1971) indicates that Paracas pottery is not common in Pisco and that, when it occurs, it is mixed with later materials. Given the extensive Paracas occupation at Chongos, this perception will surely change as in tensive survey of the Pisco Valley (that must include systematic test pitting of the valley floor in the manner of American Bottom survey) is carried out and excavations at Alto del Molino continued. Whereas the stylistic phases between Ocucaje 3 and Ocucaje 7 or 8 have been called into doubt in lea, for the Paracas region Garcia Soto and Pinilla Blenke (1995) make a stylistic argument for an Early Paracas phase, prior to Paracas Cavernas and after Karwas-Chavm, using the textile me dium as their evidence. They describe this phase as heavily influenced by and derived from Chavin, and the term "epigonal Chavfn" would not be inappropriate to describe the textile that forms the basis of their phase definition. This textile is a painted cotton cloth (illustrated in Engel, 1991, Fig. 69; for another example see also Engel, 1991, Fig. 67). It was excavated by Engel at a site he calls "Aldea", just south of Arena Blanca/Cabeza Larga at the neck of the Paracas Peninsula. This textile is stylistically closely related to textiles said to be from Ocucaje in the lower lea Valley. One such textile, a double cloth band fragment (see Hughes, 1995, plate la; compare to Dwyer, 1979, Figs. 9, 10), portrays three displayed frontal face personages having parted hair or head appendages, felinic spotted torso, recurved eyebrows, and a crossbar-configured fanged mouth strongly remi niscent of the Aldea textile. The figures are placed vertically and are sepa rated from each other by single guilloche (braided strands) bands. This piece can be compared to Ocucaje 5, 6, and 7 pottery from Callango (lower valley south of lea) and Teojate (upper valley), taking into account that the decoration on the Hughes textile is structural (woven double cloth) and hence the design is geometricized (rather than rounded through paint ing as in one of the Aldea pieces: Engel's Fig. 69). The body position on the Hughes personage, with arms extended away from the body and bent at the elbows, is comparable to that on an Ocucaje 5 bottle from Callango (Menzel et aL, 1964, Fig. 30a). The guilloche motif on the Hughes piece is identical to that painted on the Aldea textile (Engel, 1991, Fig. 69) and to Ocucaje 6 and 7 guilloches on post-fired resin painted pottery (Menzel et aL, 1964, Figs. 35d, e, 36h, 37k, 1). All this suggests that pottery and textile phases in the lea Valley may not be totally synchronized and that certain iconography may have been portrayed more fully on textiles. This elaborate material may not be typical at presumably habitation sites, thereby accounting for the absence of the middle Ocucaje phases in the settlement pattern studies undertaken in lea. Finally, the Early Paracas pe riod may have been quite brief, the Early Paracas displayed personage quickly evolving into the Oculate Being rather than being a foreign intro</page><page sequence="37">Formative Period on the South Coast of Peru 131 duction (see, e.g., Massey, 1990). Giving particular credence to this idea is the crossbar-configured fanged mouth of some of the personages on the Animas Altas frieze excavated by Massey [(1990, Fig. 116, top right) note also the recurved eyebrow on one profile figure], which is comparable to the mouth on the Hughes Ocucaje textile and Engel's (1991, Fig. 69) Aldea textile. From Yauca, just beyond the southernmost end of the south coast culture area, comes yet further evidence in support of Garcia Soto and Pinilla Blenke's Early Paracas phase. Gayton (1961) has published five fragmentary textiles collected by Max Uhle in Yauca in 1905. Iconographi cally these textiles can be described as "epigonal Chavin" and are identi fied by both Gayton (1961) and King (1965, p. 73) as "Early Paracas" in style. The structural manner of portrayal of the fanged mouth and guilloche is so strongly similar to the painted fanged mouth and guilloche on the Aldea textile referenced by Garcia Soto and Pinilla Blenke (1995; cited above) and on the Hughes double cloth piece (also cited above) that dif fusion must be the agent. As Yauca lies well outside the sphere of Chavm and Paracas influence, it is reasonable to assume that this influence moved north from Paracas-Ica to south and that Yauca was a receptor rather than an innovator. Thus far no Early Paracas textiles are reported from the Rio Grande de Nazca drainage. The Early Paracas phase is followed by the major Paracas Cavernas habitation zone at Cerro Colorado at the neck of the Paracas Peninsula (Silverman, 1991). This hillside settlement must be the source of the Cav ernas burials and tombs on the terraces above the site (Silverman, 1991, p. 397; Tello and Mejfa Xesspe, 1979, pp. 98-248, 304-315). The valleys of the Rio Grande de Nazca drainage were essentially out side the Paracas Tradition, although finds of diagnostic Ocucaje-Paracas pottery are reported (Silverman, 1991,1994). Rather, Paracas intruded into an existing local context called Tajo. Tajo society was organized in small, independent agricultural villages, without any evidence of larger-scale in tegration such as characterizes the south coast valleys to the north at this time (Silverman, 1994). In the Acari Valley, between Initial Period Hacha and the Early In termediate Period Nasca sites (see Rowe, 1963), there is, as yet, a hiatus filled only by the few incised bowls known from the Hacha 2 ceramic corpus (see Riddell and Valdez, 1987/1988, Fig. 5c; Robinson, 1994, Fig. 14g, h) (Fig. 10), generically comparable to Paracas pottery and, as noted by Ro binson (1994, p. 17), undated and without firm context.</page><page sequence="38">132 Silverman Topara Occupations on the South Coast Paracas was not the only art style and society on the south coast in the immediately post-Chavm period. Just as Paracas art and culture take their name from the Paracas Cavernas type-site on the Paracas Peninsula, so the other great, partly contemporary south coast style, Paracas Necropo lis, took its name from a peninsular burial ground, the Wari Kayan Ne cropolis (see Tello, 1959; Tello and Mejia Xesspe, 1979). Wallace (1963, 1971, 1986) and Lanning (1960) call Paracas Necropolis art and society Topara after the quebrada at whose mouth pottery of this style was first identified. The name is favored by U.S. archaeologists be cause it does not refer exclusively to the Wari Kayan Necropolis at Paracas but, rather, to the cultural tradition of which the Paracas Necropolis is a part. Topara textiles in the styles (linear, broad line, and block color) of the Paracas Necropolis textiles are only very occasionally reported in the literature (e.g., Pezzia, 1969, p. 53). Topara pottery, on the other hand, is found at sites in Cahete, Chincha, and Pisco, at the extensive Arena Blanca/Cabeza Larga habitation area at Paracas, and, of course, in the Wari Kayan Necropolis at Paracas and contemporary cemeteries at Arena Blanca/Cabeza Larga (see Silverman, 1991). Topara pottery constitutes a distinct ceramic style characterized by well-made, thin-walled, oxidized, monochrome vessels, in contrast to the resin-painted, thicker, and reduced-atmosphere fired vessels of the Paracas style. Wallace (1986) argues that the heartland of this material is Canete, which I, following Torero (1975), identify as being in the Department of Lima heartland of the Quechua language. Wallace considers his Patos style of Canete to be related to Paracas and to be the first phase of the Topara tradition (Wallace, 1963; see Silverman, 1991, pp. 379-380). The Los Patos type-site is described as "an agglutinated occupation site of rather large village size" (Wallace, 1986, p. 42). Wallace (1986, p. 43) speculates that there may have been a temple mound, though no data are presented in support of that hunch. Patos would be followed by the Jahuay 1, 2, and 3 phases, which are contemporary with Ocucaje 8, 9, and 10 in lea, and then the final Topara phases, Chongos and Quebrada. I am unaware of published information on Jahuay 1 and 2 settlement patterns in Canete; the Jahuay type-site, which has these phases, is not in the valley proper but, rather, at the mouth of the Topara Quebrada at a place called "Jahuay" or "Jaguey." Data on Jahuay 3 times in Canete are limited to Wallace's (1986, p. 35) statement that he found Jahuay 2B and 3 material at the Quebrada type-site whose later occupations are the principal ones.</page><page sequence="39">Formative Period on the South Coast of Peru 133 Wallace (1986) reported the presence of nine large Topara temple mounds in Chincha. Unfortuntely, the Topara phase or phases to which these constructions pertain is not indicated. The mounds are said to have no significant associated habitation areas. Wallace states that the concept of solid-fill temple mound religious structures was introduced to Chincha by bearers of the Topara style, which must be a reference to Cahete. This is an unusual suggestion since there are no data demonstrating the presence of monumental architecture in Cahete at this time other than Wallace's unsubstantiated speculation that at Los Patos one mound, in a more level area with poorly defined architecture, "could conceivably have been a tem ple mound" (Wallace, 1986, p. 43). Cahete, as presently known, is a poor choice of donor, and Chincha's cultural development first should be worked out in local terms before calling in outside explanatory factors. It is pre cisely this course of action that Canziani (1992) follows. Canziani's summary of the excavations at Chococota, in the middle Chincha Valley, is significant, for here a "Paracas Necropolis" domestic oc cupation was discovered in a series of low, public mounds, in addition to an earlier Paracas Cavernas one (Canziani, 1992, p. 104). A large, densely agglutinated multicomponent site is located nearby at Pampa del Gentfl. One of that site's occupation phases is Paracas Necropolis; Canziani (1992, p. 107) does not indicate what Topara phases are encompassed by this ter minology (i.e., Jahuay as well as Chongos?). Furthermore, Canziani (1992, pp. 108-113) identifies a Paracas Necropolis (again, no phase is indicated) through early Early Intermediate Period irrigation system in the middle valley. In Pisco, Wallace (1986, p. 43) and Peters (1987/1988) have docu mented a Topara component at the agglutinated Chongos site that is at least 40 ha in area. The site is composed of discrete rectangular compounds and associated rooms that form spatially separate architectural units with space between. Peters' (1987/1988, Fig. 2) map reveals a resemblance be tween the organization of space at Chongos and at the Jahuay 3-Chongos occupation of Arena Blanca/Cabeza Larga at Paracas. Peters (1987/1988, p. 34) suggests that Chongos was the capital of Wallace's alleged Topara state. She argues that Chongos was the point of contact between Paracas and Topara peoples, a metropolitan nexus of the strong cultural and eco nomic relationships characterizing the valleys of the south coast in the late Early Horizon (Jahuay 3 times) and earliest Early Intermediate Period (Chongos times). In this light, the long-distance exchange network between Cahete-Chincha-Pisco-Paracas and the Mantaro Valley, Ancon-Chillon re gion, and obsidian-producing Huancavelica highlands is also relevant (see MacNeish et al, Browman 1975; Browman 1970, pp. 191-194).</page><page sequence="40">134 Silverman Fernando Herrera and I have recovered Topara pottery at the large Alto del Molino site in the lower Pisco Valley, west of Chongos. At present we consider all of our Topara material to be Chongos and later in date, i.e., we have not yet firmly identified discrete Jahuay 3 pottery?rather, it appears to be mixed with our Chongos phase in fulfillment of Wallace's (1986, p. 39) comment that a bowl with "a sharply convex-curved rim occurs in Jahuay 3 but apparently does not completely die out until some time during the Chongos phase." The major Topara habitation zone at Arena Blanca/Cabeza Larga at the neck of the arid Paracas Peninsula was supported by a dependable sup ply of goundwater (Craig and Psuty, 1968, p. 36; Engel, 1987, p. 127) and abundant marine resources. It is possible that farming was carried out at nearby sunken fields, taking advantage of the high water table or, possibly, the abundant agricultural products recovered through excavations at Para cas (e.g., Tello, 1959; Tello and Mejia Xesspe, 1979) were the result of ex change with valley dwellers in Pisco. Regardless, a large sedentary Topara (Jahuay 3 and Chongos phases) population occupied the more than 50 ha of agglutinated rectangular habitation units of Arena Blanca/Cabeza Larga. Yet in spite of the 'pronounced socioeconomic differentiation manifested in the fardels from Paracas, the extensive contemporary habitation zone exhibits no intrasite stratification and debate still continues over the ulti mate source of the individuals buried in the Arena Blanca/Cabeza Larga funerary nuclei and in the great necropolis on Cerro Colorado (see Paul, 1990, pp. 30-34; Rowe, 1995, pp. 35-38; see summary by Silverman, 1991). In lea there are no Jahuay-phase Topara sites. Rather, Ocucaje 10 pot tery in lea may exhibit specific Topara influence in the use of white slip, white paste, differential firing, and there are specific cases of carefully shaped, very thin, monochrome or resist-decorated Topara (Toparoid?) pottery includ ing double-spout-and-bridge capped bottles (see Menzel et aL, 1974, pp. 211, 164; Sawyer, 1966, Figs. 137, 138; Silverman, 1991, pp. 376-377). There is, as yet, little or no evidence of Jahuay-phase Topara influence in the Rio Grande de Nazca drainage, and none in Acari. Regionalism Paracas may be described as the first regional culture of the south coast. Prior to Paracas there were scattered sites with little relationship to each other. With Paracas there is a well-developed settlement pattern of culturally related and interacting sites in Chincha, Pisco, the Paracas Peninsula, and lea. Interaction is shown by a shared art style (Wallace, 1985) that conforms fairly closely to Moseley's (1992, pp. 73-74) definition of corporate style.</page><page sequence="41">Formative Period on the South Coast of Peru 135 (1) Corporate styles emerge after the corporations that they identify come into existence. (2) Once a corporate body is established, a corporate style can be put together rapidly, being either newly created or borrowed or a combination of both. (3) Corporate styles imply the existence of skilled craftsmen and specialized technicians. (4) Corporate styles generally spread to the limits of their supporting reciprocity systems but reciprocity was not uniform. (5) Stylistic unity at the corporate level does not imply ethnic homogeneity at the folk or local level. (6) Change in corporate style or replacement of one by another does not necessarily reflect population replacement. The emergence of the Oculate Being?as a totally new icon (Menzel et aL, 1964), a Chavin (presumably Karwas-Ocucaje 3) derivation (Massey 1990, p. 153), or a revival of pre-Chavin Puerto Nuevo iconography and ideology (Garcia Soto and Pinilla Blenke, 1995)?marks the coalescence of the corporate style. The subsequent rapid diffusion of this iconography out of the Ocucaje Basin conforms to Moseley's first and second criteria. Although there is no evidence for full-time craftsmen, clearly there were skilled artists in Paracas society. Moseley's notion that corporate styles spread to the limits of their sys tems of reciprocity is particularly interesting for this discussion. The Ocu cate Being first appeared in the Ocucaje Basin, while this subregion and neighboring Callango still used Chavm-derived imagery (Menzel et aL, 1964, p. 169, plates 8b, 9, 10a, right). The ideology and cultural dynamics of the epigonal Chavin material are unknown. But its replacement by an entirely new icon, the Oculate Being, is testimony to both the collapse of the Chavin cult and interaction sphere and the emergence of new, more local lines of power and, in Moseley's words, reciprocity. This is what I am calling the post-Chavm reorganization. Oculate Being iconography is much more fully developed in lea than in any other area of the south coast save Paracas, where it is present on textiles. Paracas ceramic iconography is much more limited outside lea, with the exception of the Cavernas prove nience material from Paracas (see Wallace, 1985; see Tello, 1959, laminas I A, I C, II A, B, III A, B, IV A, B) which, nevertheless, does not portray the Oculate Being. The Oculate Being may be one of the keys to understanding and assessing the nature and degree of integration in the ancient Paracas world. The Oculate Being was laden with religious/mythological and cultural sig nificance to judge from its contexts in lea. Whereas participation in the Chavin cult and interaction sphere appears to have lubricated the flow of</page><page sequence="42">136 Silverman goods and information (including Chavfn iconography), the geographical distribution of the Oculate Being was limited, although other Paracas ce ramic traits were widespread on the coast from Chincha to Acari and in the adjacent highlands (see Schreiber, 1992, pp. 215-222; Wallace, 1985). In lea, the Oculate Being appears in a variety of media including tex tiles (King, 1965), pottery (Menzel et aL, 1964), and public art (Massey, 1991, Fig. 8.4). Beyond lea its occurrences literally can be counted. It is present at Chongos in Pisco as fine ceramic masks (Lapiner, 1976, pp. 80 81). It occurs multiply in full-body form on a painted textile from Cabeza Larga (Engel, 1991, Fig. 71) and on pyroengraved gourds from the Caver nas tombs at Paracas (Tello and Mejia Xesspe, 1979, Fig. 42). Wallace (1985, Fig. 1) says that it occurs in Pinta pottery from Chincha, but I have never seen an illustration and suspect that it is not common there. It occurs rarely in Nazca on textiles (see Silverman, 1991, Fig. 9.13) and in simplified form on pottery (Silverman, 1994, Fig. 5). What does this differential situ ation mean in terms of intervalley interaction, ethnic groups, geopolitical organization, and cultural values? Wallace (1985, p. 93) suggests that "the Oculate Being was introduced quite early into the lea sequence from the northern variants of the Paracas styles, if not from the Topara Tradition itself." As noted above, the rarity of Oculate Being iconography outside lea makes this contention unlikely, although we can consider Garcia Soto and Pinilla Blenke's (1995) sugges tion that the Oculate Being is a revival of the Puerto Nuevo principal icon after the Chavin interruption of indigenous south coast culture and cos mology. Still, the Oculate Being and other important lea Valley Paracas motifs^ both natural and supernatural, occurred in a stylistically distinct and coherent manner in the Paracas style of lea and defined lea's cosmology, religion, and cultural and geopolitical entities as a corporate style. The pres ence or absence in other south coast areas of the icons and ritually charged artifacts (such as musical instruments) that lea Valley peoples chose to em phasize is significant for what this distribution indicates about the lack of a shared worldview on the south coast and the limitations and/or conditions on the nature and degree of intervalley cultural integration. This raises the issue of the origin of the Paracas Cavernas corpus, which stylistically, in all media, is so similar to lea's Paracas style. While the identification of the "nucleos habitacionales de Wari Kayan" on Cerro Colorado as a Paracas Cavernas site is not in question (see Silverman, 1991), the source of the clay for the pottery, fuel for the kilns or pottery firing areas, cotton for the textiles, and gourds for carving is, and therefore the geographical identity of the artists is in doubt. Were the Cerro Colorado residents the makers as well as the users of their renowned material cul ture? And even if these goods were obtained from a valley population</page><page sequence="43">Formative Period on the South Coast of Peru 137 (Pisco? Ica?), would not the ubiquity of these materials at Paracas suggest cultural identity with the purveyors? This issue requires resolution through more fieldwork at Paracas. Wallace (1986) has argued that Topara was a cultural manifestation and social formation with an art style and geopolitical territory distinct from that of the Paracas tradition societies. He models Topara as an expansionist state that expanded south from a Cahete Valley heartland to occupy Chin cha, Pisco, and finally, the upper Ica Valley. Yet Topara society is, at pre sent, elusive because of insufficient fieldwork and a ceramic style whose phases largely can be discriminated only through comparison to each other by means of samples from stratigraphic columns (e.g., Jahuay 3 is differ entiated from Chongos by the former's lack of a low open bowl with a gambrel between the base and short side walls; Jahuay 3 is differentiated from Jahuay 1 and 2 by the absence of certain Jahuay 1 and 2 traits rather than the appearance of new ones). The paucity of data from Cahete, the alleged heartland of this state, makes all interpretation about Topara re gional political interaction, at least in Jahuay times, highly speculative at present. Interregionalism The Early Intermediate Period is widely viewed as a time of local geo political assertion, warfare, and territoriality marked by the emergence of truly distinct regional art styles. These inward-looking cultural configura tions have been contrasted with the wide networks of communication and exchange that characterized the Chavin Horizon. While the generalization is true, it is important to note that significant interregional contact occurred in the immediately post-Chavm period, even as the networks distributing Quispisisa obsidian shrank to the pattern in existence prior to the Chavin Horizon (see Burger and Asaro, 1993, p. 230). A case illustrating interre gional contact in the immediately post-Chavm period is the contact between Paracas and Topara peoples of the south coast and their contemporaries on the central coast. Tabio (1965, 1972) has reported the discovery of two Paracas Cavernas sherds in midden at the Colinas site in Ancon. Lanning (1960, pp. 128-129) recovered postfire painted sherds at Curayacu which he interpreted as a local innovation under Paracas influence. The detailed studies by Silva et al (1982, 1983), Palacios (1987-1988), Cardenas (1971, plate 13), Stothert (1980, Figs. 15, 16, 23; compare to Lavalle and Lang, 1983, p. 158, Fig. 169, bottom), and Paredes (1986) illustrate Paracas and Topara influence on Late Formative pottery from the Rimac and Lurin valleys on the central</page><page sequence="44">138 Silverman coast. In figure after figure we see local vessels and sherds that imitate various south coast forms and decoration without copying them exactly. Silva et aL (1982, 1983) have indicated the similarities between Huachipa C (Palacios' Cerro Temprano) and Paracas in terms of the use of incised lines to form rectilineal geometric designs. A close comparison can be drawn between figurines of both cultures (compare Silva et aL, 1983, Fig. 16 to Lapiner, 1976, Fig. 202). Palacios' (1987-1988, cover, photos 7, 8, 14, 15, 17, 19-21, Figs. 22, 33, 38) double-spout-and-bridge bottles, bottles with spout-connector handle-and-modeled bird, and bottles with head and spout show clear influence from the Paracas Tradition and from Jahuay 3 and Chongos pottery of the Topara Tradition (see Tello, 1959, plate 9c; Tello and Mejia Xesspe, 1979, Fig. 93; Sawyer, 1966, Figs. 135, 137, 139). But Huachipa C does not exhibit the resist technique or postfire resin paint ing?other than red?or the ubiquitous graters found on the south coast at this time (Silva et aL, 1983, pp. 22, 32). Acceptance of ceramic traits was selective and influence went in both directions and included the north coast as evidenced by locally made double-spout-and-bridge bottles in Sali nar. Archaeologists have emphasized the White-on-Red diffusion as the spread of a decorative technique (Willey, 1948). In addition, there was a morphological diffusion as seen in shared common vessel shapes along the north, central, and south coast, specifically, vessels with modeled birds and animals seated on their bodies and bottles with a spout-bridge-and-modeled spout. The fact that both Paracas and Topara traits can be seen in the earliest Early Intermediate Period pottery of the central coast is interesting. Only Pisco and Chincha meet this bicultural condition and I suggest that these were the donor valleys that engaged in contact with the central coast. To understand fully the nature, context, and mechanism (e.g., direct, down the-line, etc.) of this interregional contact, it will be vital to investigate the virtually unknown intermediate valleys of Canete, Asia, Mala, and Chilca. The great distances between some of the coastal valleys and the evi dence of territorially discontinuous interregional influence make maritime routes of exchange plausible. Nevertheless, I am unaware of actual earliest Early Intermediate Period trade pieces from the south coast on the central coast, and vice versa. Much work is needed to understand the nature of these interareal relationships beyond the typical archaeological cliche that imitation is a recognition and manipulation of the prestige of the donor. The stylistic influence of the south coast on the central coast and the first cultural apogee of the south coast in Paracas culture occurred precisely when there was a power vacuum on the central coast during the concurrent post-Chavin cultural reorganization identified with the White-on-Red dif fusion. The earliest Early Intermediate Period societies of the central coast</page><page sequence="45">Formative Period on the South Coast of Peru 139 did not put their cultural emphasis on spectacular artisanal activities, and central coast settlement pattern (as currently known) seems to be simpler than that of the south coast at this time. Nevertheless, the burials at Tablada de Lurin indicate a large population, and these societies of the lower Lurin Valley were creating the conditions and context for the rise of Pachacamac (Paredes, 1986; Stothert, 1980, pp. 286, 292). Paredes (1986, p. 8) correctly stated that "the central coast developed interacting culturally as a center of north-south convergence." Truly, the Lurin-Rimac-Chillon nucleus was both cosmopolitan and highly regional ized (Stothert, 1980, p. 290). Fishing villages coexisted with agricultural towns. Valley dwellers built ceremonial mounds. People were buried with greater or less wealth: Stothert (1980) indicates the presence of exotic and luxury grave goods such as Spondylus shell beads and gold-covered copper ornaments; Paredes (1986) reports the construction of funerary tumuli at El Panel and he notes socioeconomic differentiation in terms of grave of ferings and prestige paraphernalia. Among the burial goods are pots influ enced by contemporary south coast styles. Pottery appears to have been a valued item in earliest Early Intermediate Period Lurin Valley society since usually only one vessel was placed in a burial and some of these show south coast influence. CONCLUSIONS Achievement of complex society on the south coast lagged behind that on the central coast and north coast and in the north highlands. The Initial Period and Early Horizon societies of the south coast varied in size and level of sociopolitical integration among each other and with regard to these other regions. The south coast did not participate in the precocious Initial Period events and processes of the core area, although there was pre-Chavin contact between Cupisnique society and the Puerto Nuevo site and the south coast was part of the Quispisisa obsidian network. Nor was the south coast well integrated into the Early Horizon Chavin world, with the specific and very significant exception of the lea Valley-Independence Bay corridor. Only in the apparent power vacuum created by the demise of the Chavin cult did the south coast more fully engage with and manifest social formations more readily comparable to those of the central and north coast. The emergence of clearly territorial social formations and regional art styles marks the immediate post-Chavin period. It is significant that cemeteries formal areas for the disposal of the dead?appear precisely at this time for cemeteries correlate with the geopolitical marking of group territory,</page><page sequence="46">140 Silverman typically with rights to land and other critical resources inherited from or traced to the ancestors (see, e.g., papers in Chapman et aL, 1981). Similarly, geoglyphs elaborated in lea (e.g., lineal markings at Tajahuana) and Nazca [e.g., the additive figures made by piling up rocks (see Reinhard, 1988, Fig. 40)] in this immediately post-Chavm period may be said to mark the land scape in sociopolitically and ritually meaningful ways (see discussion by Sil verman, 1990). Yet the south coast would never achieve the level of sociopolitical integration of the core area as manifested in the archaeologi cal cultures known as Lima, Mochica, Sican, and Chimii, to name the most obvious. Without turning to environmental determinism, nevertheless I think that at least part of the cumulative cultural dynamic of the central and, especially, north coast that is visible from the Late Preceramic Period is due to the necessity and ability of those valleys to act in an intervalley manner. This promoted complexity in social and political relations, whereas the more isolated and poorer nature of the south coast valleys acted against these forces of interareal integration for many centuries. Indeed, I would argue that there never was a centralized multivalley polity (i.e., a regional state) on the south coast. Although the development of complex society should not be seen as a race and although the trajectory of cultural development is not unilineal or unidirectional, seen through a lens of long duration there does appear to be a cumulative cultural dynamic toward cultural complexity on the central coast, and even more so on the north coast, that was slower and more precarious on the south coast in spite of the episodes of artistic beauty, mortuary elaboration, and ceremonial intensification that can be detected in that region's archaeological record. I see the expansion of in tervalley and interregional communication networks in the Late Pre ceramic and Initial Period on the central coast, and north coast and north highlands promoting the increase in cultural complexity regionally (Bur ger, 1985; Quilter and Stocker, 1983) in a way that would not characterize the south coast for many centuries and then more diluted and different in nature. With more fieldwork and a critical evaluation of the existing data, it should be possible to resolve the debates and unknowns presented in this article. Results of future studies will enable archaeologists better to trace and systematically explain the growth and nature of complex society on the south coast, with the purpose of placing these diverse regional cultures within the overarching framework of ancient Andean society. Ultimately, we will be able to compare these processes to trajectories of cultural evo lution and manifestations of complex society worldwide.</page><page sequence="47">Formative Period on the South Coast of Peru 141 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This paper has benefited from topical conversations with Krzysztof Makowski, Ruben Garcia, Jose Pinilla, Jalh Dulanto, and Darrell Gundrum and careful, critical readings by Richard Burger, Karen Chavez, and Donald Proulx.
