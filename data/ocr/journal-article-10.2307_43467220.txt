HARRISON Univerzity of Texas Press, Austin $3.00 this book traces the decline, fall, and recovery of rational nature-writing. The accurate re- cording of firsthand observations of natural phenomena in the field began, as all science does, with the Greeks. Aristotle (see his History of Animals) wrote of nature very much in the modern way. Vergil, three hundred years later, imitated him. But Vergil's Georgie s show symptoms of decadence in their tales of how 344 autumn 1957</page><page sequence="2">birds predict the weather, how philomel be- wails in a human fashion the loss of her brood, and other wizardry and sentimentālisms. Henceforward nature-writing for a thou- sand or more years veered off into mere cata- loguing, symbolism, and interpretations of ani- mal behavior in terms of human thoughts and emotions. In short, nature- writers, even includ- ing the illustrious Pliny, went deeper into the books than into the woods in pursuit of Na- ture's ways and means. "True encyclopedists, . . . they labored to assemble all extant infor- mation from written and oral sources," says Dr. Harrison. Hence they produced libraries of mere catalogues, folklore, superstitions, and im- poverished pedagogy and moral instruction of questionable effectiveness. Historically, this is all interesting enough, but thin diet for one who is "hot for certainties in this our life." Early Christian writers, we are told, reveled in symbolic interpretations of nature, quite in- different to the verity of the symbol itself, so long as it could be twisted to point a moral. Nature- faking was thus made to drive home spiritual truths and to dramatize the wisdom of quitting the crowd to "enter in at the strait gate" of the gospel, according to Saints Mat- thew and Luke. But we shall not attempt further to con- dense the author's thirty-page summary of pre- Chaucerian literature in which the theme of this engaging book is set forth. Briefly, as al- ready indicated, his purpose is to exhibit the evolution of a science from a mixed-up mass of fact and fiction by means chiefly of the imagery found in the works of the four English poets named in the subtitle of this volume. We find in this detailed and thoroughly doc- umented study the nose for derivations, or sources, expected of the professional student of literature, as well as a familiarity (quite un- expected) with the point of view of a twen- tieth-century field naturalist. Spenser, himself a falcon fan, perhaps a falconer, is given a pat of approval for using images drawn from fal- conry directly observed, whereas Milton's meta- phors are downgraded as following the old pattern. Dr. Harrison traces with the gusto of a game and the skill of a seasoned player Mil- ton's debt to Spenser, Spenser's to Chaucer, and Chaucer's to De Planētu Naturae , Alanus, Aelian, and other sources sufficiently obscure to make juicy morsels for the derivationist. This form of literary hide-and-seek has been played ardently by generations of literary partisans, and from it has come a considerable body of scholarly writing and a livelier appreciation of critical literature. There is often keen rivalry among the researchers. Sometimes disputes wax really warm. Authorities are bandied back and forth like shuttles in a badminton tourney. In the present work, for instance, authorities are cited plenteously in polyglot footnotes, rather more mystifying than enlightening, by the way, to a monolinguist like this reviewer. The discussion develops, however, the fact that Chaucer represents a budding of the scien- tific method. Spenser (except in falcon im- agery) and Milton relapse into symbolism, sentimentalism, and pseudo pedagogy, while Drayton epitomizes the whole movement. Be- ginning in the old vein, this eminent Eliza- bethan soon became a field observer and re- corder of no mean ability. Especially is the modern note quite audible in Drayton's ear for birdsongs. All in all, the English major will find in this book rather a model for documented studies in his field. The bird-lover will value Dr. Harri- son's account of how the method of field ob- servation and conscientious recording declined with Aristotle and how, after a long wandering in the wilderness of cataloguing, symbolism, sentimentalism, anthropomorphism (and per- haps another ism or two) , it came into its own, as shown in the imagery of the four great poets. And, finally, as a by-product of this mining operation, an impressive body of bird- folklore has been recovered. Roy Bedichek southwest Review 345</page></plain_text>
