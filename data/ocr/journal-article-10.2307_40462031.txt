Hopi Racing Few works in religious studies have evoked more interest and discussion than James George Frazer's The Golden Bough. Frazer's theory of magic that "like produces like, or that an effect resembles its cause; and, second, that things which have once been in contact with each other continue to act on each other at a distance after the physical contact has been severed,"1 has been utilized by numerous scholars in the twentieth century to interpret a variety of ritual prayer acts found virtually over the entire globe. According to Frazer, "sympathetic magic" has been put to use in a multitude of cultures to facilitate childbirth and produce children from barren women, to help the hunter, the fisher- man, and the farmer, and to protect people from a variety of diseases and/or evil influences. Sympathetic magic has two separate but often related branches according to Frazer, "homeopathic" and "contagious" (1922: 12). Homeopathic magic is based on "the associa- tion of ideas by similarity," that is, it assumes that "things which resemble each other are the same" (1922: 13). Frazer cites as a familiar example of homeopathic magic the attempt made by many peoples to injure or destroy another person by and through the destruction of an image of that person. After citing that the above practice occurred in ancient India, Baby- lon, Egypt, Greece, Rome, Australia, Africa, and Scotland, Frazer gives us a couple of examples from the two Americas. For example, he notes that the Ojibway Indians of North America think that they can hurt an enemy by making a little wooden image of that person and piercing it with a needle, the pain corre- sponding on the victim's body to the point pierced by the needle (1922: 15). Contagious magic, somewhat differently, is based on "the association of ideas by contigu- ity" and holds that "things which have once been in contact with each other are always in contact" (1922: 13). Here again Frazer cites examples from many peoples across the world over the ages. The Ojibway of North America are again referenced as Frazer notes that they often placed a death "medicine" on the track of the first deer or bear they met, thinking the animal would soon cease to travel and die (1922: 51). Frazer wrote that the two branches of magic, homeopathic and contagious, often exist together in practice and that both branches can be comprehended under the general term of sympathetic magic, since both assume that things act on each other at a distance through a secret sympa- John D.

Loftin thy, the impulse being transmitted from one to the other by means of what we may conceive as a kind of invisible ether, not unlike that which is postulated by modern science for a precisely similar purpose, namely to explain how things can physically affect each other through a space which appears to be empty (1922: 14). Frazer holds that humanity's first appropria- tion of the world was magical. Perhaps that helps us to understand the very widespread utilization today of the theory of magic to interpret the religious art of various Paleolithic peoples.2 Magic was an early attempt at modern science that failed due to its barren and false logical underpinnings. Magic was correct in assuming that "in nature one event follows another necessarily and invariably without the intervention of any spiritual or personal agen- cy" (Frazer 1922: 56) but incorrect in attempt- ing to decipher those immutable laws through the laws of similarity and contact. Religion, strictly speaking, for Frazer did not emerge among humans until after repeated failures by magic to control the world (1922: 56-59). Upon the experience of numerous fruitless magical rites, humans began to feel that there must be another agent involved in the workings of the world and they began to supplicate this being with prayer. Finally, the religious phase of human evolution gave way to the advance of modern science, where the idea of nature's unchangeable rhythms was once again recover- ed. With science, however, Frazer held that proper empirical and rational experimental techniques assured success in attempting to manipulate the world for some desired result. Many symbolic anthropologists and histori- ans of religion since Rudolf Otto have found the theory of "sympathetic magic" held by Frazer and his supporters to be unsatisfactory (Otto 1923). Das Heilige (The Idea of the Holy) holds that religious experience always embodies an encounter with the "numinous" (sacred/supernatural)3 which is experienced as an anonymous and autonomous "wholly other." Furthermore, Otto argues that the ex- perience of passivity or receptiveness ("crea- ture feeling") is a constitutive, not evolutiona- ry, structure of authentic religious experience. Scholars of religion who hold that religious experience is a constitutive structure of the human mode of being have, therefore, resisted the evolutionary scheme of Frazer which pre- supposes that religion is a derivative component that evolved after the failures of the early science called magic. Yet, at the same time, scholars of religion have refuted the theory of magic in a rather tendentious manner that does not squarely come to terms with the immense amount of data cited by Frazer and his support- ers. In this paper I shall address the problem of "sympathetic magic" through an examination of the prayer acts of the Hopi, a Native American people who inhabit primarily three spurs of the semi-arid Black Mesa in northeastern Arizona, United States. The scope of the paper would be surpassed were I to conduct a similar detailed investigation of the prayer acts of other Native 2 For a few examples of the use of the theory of magic to interpret Paleolithic religious art as well as critiques thereof, see: Breuil 1952; Graziosi 1960; Leroi- Gourhan 1958; 1965; 1972; Marshack 1972; 1977; Narr 1964; Ucko and Rosenfeld 1967. For a fine critical biblio- graphy of works on Paleolithic peoples and regions, see: Eliade 1978: 376-385. 3 I shall here utilize the term sacred to describe that which the Hopi experience as ultimate. I use the term sacred as does Eliade, who borrowed the sacred/profane dichotomy from Caillois. According to Caillois, "At bot- tom, the only helpful thing one can say of the sacred in general is contained in the very definition of the term: that it is the opposite of the profane. As soon as one attempts to give a clear statement of the nature, the modality of that opposition, one strikes difficulty. No formula, how- ever elementary, will cover the labyrinthine complexity of the facts." Recently Hultkrantz, the foremost authority on Native American religions, wrote a paper in which he argues that the term "supernatural" is a more appropriate term than sacred for making the human distinction "be- tween their everyday world and the mysterious world of gods and spirits." Hultkrantz prefers to use the term sacred to refer to the religious dimension as revealed in social and ritual usage. While it would take me too far to address the above problem in detail, I understand the terms sacred and supernatural to be synonymous in de- scribing that which is experienced by humans as "other" than natural (Hultkrantz) or profane (Eliade).

My purpose here is to demon- strate that the many "magical" rites of the Hopi are, to the contrary, quite religious in character in that they presuppose a sacred "other" with which they communicate by supplication and participation.4 1. Magic and the Hopi Magical interpretations of Hopi prayer acts are old and numerous. The first scholar who inves- tigated and interpreted Hopi prayer acts was J. Walter Fewkes, who wrote numerous works about the Hopl.5 He was also the first to utilize Frazer's theory of "sympathetic magic" in order to interpret Hopi prayer. As early as 1904, Fewkes argued that Hopi prayer rites were based on ...false theories of what caused rain, heat, and the power of germination.... One of these theories was that atmospheric and germinal processes were due to magic and could be controlled by sorcery.... Smoking to cardinal points is a sign prayer, and has the same signification, for a cloud of smoke represents symbolically a rain cloud, and the worshiper wishes rain, which comes from a cloud (Fewkes 1905: 668). Later, in 1918, Fewkes wrote that the Hopi ceremonial calendar (Hopiwiimi)6 revolves around the power of the sun which Hopi priests "compel" to change the seasons and to bring warmth and precipitation to the crops in the fields. According to him, for want of a better term we call this process prayer, but it is more than a verbal entreaty, it is compulsion by sympathetic magic, and may be expressed in several ways one of which is by mimetic representa- tion called dramatization (Fewkes 1918: 496).7 Fewkes then proceeds to relate that Hopi priests impersonate the sun during the winter solstice in order to turn the sun back towards summer (1918: 496-500). Later in the same paper he again explicitly mentions magic when discussing the Hopi Buffalo Dance. Noting that at sunrise Hopi religious leaders place a minia- ture ladder in the Sun shrine, Fewkes commen- ted that, "the recognized object of this sträng offering is to aid, by sympathetic magic, the sky god in rising" (1918: 523). In 1934, C. Darryl Forde reiterated Few- kes' interpretation of Hopi prayer acts as magi- cal. In discussing the complex ceremonial calen- dar of the Hopi, he notes that the rituals of the Hopi societies are ex- tremely complex. They centre round the magical achievement of many desires... . ...but the needs of agriculture and the hazards of the environment feature promi- nently in many of them. There are rites for every stage in cultivation; ceremonial activi- ties throughout the year have nearly always some reference to agricultural prosperity (Forde 1934: 242-243). 4 For some other critiques of the theory of magic, see: Downie 1970: chapter VIII; Eliade 1958: 19ff., 35-36; Evans-Pritchard 1965:27-29; Leach and Jarvie 1966; Lowie 1924:137-147; Gill 1977-1978; Schmidt 1931: 123-124; Smith 1972-1973; de Vries 1961; Wax and Wax 1961-1962. 5 For a listing of Fewkes' many Hopi works, see Laird 1977: 191-208. Laird's annotated bibliography is the most complete on the Hopi and contains almost three thousand entries. Yet, one must remember that hundreds of works about the Hopi have been published since 1977. 6 The spelling of Hopi terms is problematical since the Hopi language was not written aboriginally. A Hopi- English dictionary is now being put together by Emory Sekaquaptewa, Coordinator of Indian Programs at the University of Arizona in conjunction with Dr. David Shaul, a Uto-Aztecan linguist. I would like to thank Emory for his help with the spelling of Hopi terms in this work. Some terms referred to in this paper were not yet standardized at the time of publication and are therefore not emphasized. 7 Fewkes' works are well respected among the Hopi themselves. His works are considered to be accurate yet respectful of Hopi ceremonial secrets revealed to him (personal communication, Tony Dukepoo, Second Mesa, 1980). See also Yava 1978: 80. Anthropos 81.1986</page><page sequence="4">180 John D. Loftin Forde then proceeds to give some examples of Hopi agricultural magic (243-244). He men- tions winter stickball games which are played with a buckskin filled with seeds. The purpose of the ritual is to burst the buckskin and scatter the seeds which foreshadows a good harvest the next fall. He also notes that Hopi farmers often run races in the fields in order to promote the quick growth of the crops. In February the Hopi grow bean and corn sprouts in heated kiikiva (underground ceremonial chambers) in order to compel a bountiful harvest the next season. In 1936, Elsie Clews Parsons published a massive two- volume work, Pueblo Indian Reli- gion. In that work, she devotes a small amount of space to the interpretation of Pueblo and hence Hopi religion. She calls Pueblo religion an "instrument of life" that controls the natural through the supernatural. The technique of control is largely magical, that is, ritual acts are automatically effectual: prayer or song or dance, color or line are formulistic or compulsive (Parsons 1936: x).8 Elaborating further, Parsons writes that Pueblo magic must be understood primarily as "thinking by analogy" such that "like causes or produces like, or like follows like" (1936: 88). Elsewhere, Parsons relates that sympathetic magic allows a sense of achievement ... through the production in small scale or miniature of the end desired. ... Rites of water sprin- kling and of smoking to produce rain and cloud express this attitude, one expressed constantly in the daily, personal life of the Pueblos. ... To this end the woman of the house will throw water on the man as he leaves to plant ... or the tobacco chief will puff smoke for "the directions" into a bowl of water which represents a spring (Parsons 1924: 147). However, drawing upon works by two other nineteenth century ethnologists, Stephen (1936: 1271-1272) and Voth (1905: 116; 1912a: 25, 55)9, as well as her own fieldwork, Parsons discusses another more religious side of Hopi prayer. On that level, prayer for the Hopi is pot so much a matter of thinking by analogy as it is a mode of reciprocity between Hopi deities and Hopl. There prayer offerings are given to various Hopi gods in exchange for the fulfill- ment of some practical, life-supporting desire (Parsons 1924: 147). More recently, R. Maitland Bradfield (1973: 195-197) has taken up and elaborated Parsons' two-fold scheme of Hopi prayer acts in a well-done synthesis of Hopi materials. He discusses first "mimetic magic," in which, according to him, a ritual object is used to act directly on the "like thing" to compulsively bring about the desired event. According to Bradfield, such magical rituals emerged first among the Hopi and their ancestors (hisatsi* nom), true prayer coming later. I shall return later to a more detailed discussion of Brad- field's theory of magic as it relates to Hopi prayer. I mention Bradfield here for two reasons. First, his large monograph is generally regarded as an accurate account of Hopi religio- sity, a view I find problematical. Secondly, I want to show that the interpretation of Native American prayer rites as magical is not a relic of the past and thus needs to be explored further. Some may feel that the magic-religion issue is outmoded, but the fact that a number of con- temporary theoreticians continue to push Fra- zer's position indicates to me that more discus- sion on the matter is needed. 8 Parsons wrote numerous works on various Native Americans, especially the Pueblos of which the Hopi are an example. For a list of her many works on the Hopi, see Laird 1977: 473-481. Yava (1978: 81) claims that Parsons' Tewa informant ("Crow Wing") never existed, but per- haps that name was a pseudonym. 9 Voth was a very astute observer of Hopi life, though some Hopis say he never fully mastered their language. However, some of his reproductions of Hopi sacred objects, which found their way into a number of museums, were so seemingly authentic as to arouse suspi- cions of theft among some Hopis who viewed them. For discussions of Voth as a Mennonite missionary and eth- nographer, see: Eggan 1979: 1-7; Courlander 1982: XVIII, 124-126; James 1974: 147-158; Talayesva 1942: 41, 252. Anthropos 81.1986</page><page sequence="5">Supplication and Participation jgj The smoking of sacred tobacco for rain is cited by both Parsons and Bradfield as being a typical Hopi magical ritual. Ritual smoking is, along with the sprinkling of sacred cornmeal (homngumni), the most common mode of pray- er among the Hopi and is utilized in almost every phase of their elaborate ceremonial calen- dar. Hence, the understanding of Hopi ritual smoking should shed much light on the theory of Hopi prayer acts. 2. Spiritual Substance and Smoking for Rain My view is that Hopi ritual smoking, along with the other modes of Hopi prayer, is not magical in character, but rather embodies paradoxical structures of participation in and supplication of a 'ne himu, the "very something" that is expe- rienced as sacred. Emory Sekaquaptewa, whom I interviewed in June 1984 at his mother's house in Kykotsmovi, agrees with Milo Kalectaca in defining a'ne as "hard, well, strongly, very" and himu as "something" (or "what" when used to ask a question (see Kalectaca 1978: 190, 192). Hence, a'ne himu is generally rendered among the Hopi as "very something," though Ken- nard's "Mighty Something"10 should not be considered incorrect. A'ne himu refers to that which the Hopi experience as anonymous and autonomous or, as Kennard notes, that which is "powerful but unknown" (Kennard 1972: 470). Emory told me that the term a'ne himu is also used to describe a number of secular attributes and is purposefully vague because the Hopi do not feel they can make specific conceptual statements about that which is the foundation of all creation.11 Ritual smoking occurs among the Hopi at a variety of times and in a variety of settings. Many Hopi elders retire daily to their respective kiikiva (underground ceremonial chambers) to smoke for rain. Farmers, prior to planting, often will retire to the shade of a field hut to smoke as a prayer that their crops may receive life-giving moisture. When hunting the Hopi may stay up the night before smoking for rain to increase vegetation and hence game popula- tions and to facilitate the tracking of game. Traditionally, ritual smokes occurred be- fore, during, and after journeys to other places or pilgrimages to sacred shrines. Hopi warriors, in former times, smoked before and after war- fare expeditions. Finally, all Hopi ceremonies (Hopiwiimi), including the rites of passage, birth-naming-initiation-marriage-death , involve considerable smoking. Smoking for rain, fertil- ity, and long life occurs often during all cere- monies including Wuwtsim-Tnb&amp;l Initiation, Soyalangw, Bean Dance, Nimankatsina Tikive, the Snake- Antelope and Flute rites, and the women's rituals (Maraw, Qwaqöl, Lakon). In other words, it is appropriate for Hopi to smoke ritually in a large number of situations which call forth fruitful, life-yielding communication with the sacred. Smoking involves the burning of Hopi wild tobacco mixed with rain tobacco (yoyviva) (Whiting 1939: 88, 90) or spruce, pine, and aspen (Stephen 1936: 599 n.l) in a variety of pipes (tsootsongo).12 Hopi pipes are made by men from clay to which are attached stems of 10 See Whorf 1950:69 n. 2. - This article is also found in Carroll (ed.) 1956: 57-64. 11 Personal communication, Emory Sekaquaptewa, Third Mesa, 1983. 1 will, when appropriate, cite the names of my Hopi informants. However, sometimes my Hopi contacts (who are also my friends) wish to remain anony- mous for a variety of reasons. Some do not wish to arouse bad thoughts and jealousy from their neighbors for partici- pating in a non-Hopi venture that attempts to understand Hopi religion. Others simply wish to avoid any publicity that might threaten their own attempts to be humble and non-obtrusive, traits which carry much religious signifi- cance among the Hopl. Still others do not wish to be misquoted or misunderstood. Hopi religion embodies many ceremonial secrets which should not be revealed to the uninitiated and many contemporary Hopi, with good reason, do not wish to have their names associated with the revelation of sacred secrets or misinformation. All too often the Hopi have been exploited by western scholars who broke vows of confidentiality in disclosing certain Hopi secrets. The Hopi are human beings and any study of them should embody that understanding. It is a sad fact that much of the primary data available on the Hopi from scholars such as H. R. Voth and Alexander Stephen violates Hopi customs and was published without the consent and/or knowledge of the Hopl. 12 Wright has written about the various types of Hopi pipes drawing from a number of sources. See Wright 1979: 56-57; see also Voth 1901: pl. XL. Anthronns 81 1Q«*</page><page sequence="6">182 John D. Loftin paaqavi (a type of reed that grows near springs) (Whiting 1939: 65). The tobacco is stored in a tobacco pouch which can be constructed of a variety of materials (Wright 1979: 56). All that is needed to smoke ritually among the Hopi is a pipe, some sacred tobacco, and a source of fire. The participants, almost always male, sit smok- ing in a circle or semi-circle. Each person takes in and swallows ("drinks") four puffs of smoke, each one symbolizing a prayer for clouds and rain from one of the four cardinal directions. Then the pipe is passed to the next person with whom the smoker exchanges appropriate kinship terms, e.g., "my uncle - my nephew," "my father - my son." The exchange of proper kinship terms symbolizes the unity of Hopi hearts and breath, a prerequisite for fruitful prayer acts. As I will demonstrate more concretely below, the Hopi feel that prayers are effective only if they embody thoughts of har- mony and fertility. Smoking is always referred to as drinking. On the one hand, smoking is perceived as a prayer offering to the Six-Point-Cloud-People. In that context "drink is being given to the clouds" (Parsons [ed.] 1925: 20 n.23). The Hopi understanding of Cloud People is difficult to apprehend for one not raised and initiated a Hopl. However, I do know that the Hopi understand there are six "Cloud chiefs," each one located at one of the six cardinal directions (Stephen 1898:261-262). The Cloud Chiefs issue forth clouds from themselves which travel to Hopi where they drop their life-yielding essence on the parched ground below. Further- more, the spirit or breath (hikwsi) of Hopi, at death, is said to return to the spiritual realm of the underworld from where it periodically returns home to Hopi as cloud, bringing the gift of sacred rain.13 The spirits or souls of the Hopi return to the underworld for that is where Muy'ingwa, the Cloud Chief of "all colors," resides. Each Cloud Chief is associated with a particular color and direction except Muy'ing- wa, who is said to be "speckled with all the colors" (Stephen 1898: 262). Hence, Muy'ing- wa is another term for the sacred source of all clouds and rain according to Hopi traditions.14 In smoking, the clouds are given an offering with the hope that the clouds will bless the Hopi in return with life-giving rains. This prayer form embodies on one level a feeling of reciprocity between the Hopi and the sacred according to Parsons (1924: 147) and later Hieb (1979a: 580). Indeed, Hieb notes that the Hopi under- standing of reciprocity is the most fundamental aspect of their "world view" (580). I shall return later to discuss reciprocity, but for now wish only to note that the Hopi are, on one level, supplicating the sacred by and through prayer smokes. Also involved, according to George Nasoftie, is a dimension of suffering and humility for the smoker hopes to evoke the pity of the clouds by holding in the harsh, burning smoke.15 The smoker hence humbles himself sacrificially before the sacred by exert- ing great physical and spiritual effort in the hopes of receiving rain in return. The smoke is perceived as an offering, an indication of sacri- ficial humility and as a symbol of that which is desired, that is, primarily, rain. Rain is under- stood by the Hopi to be the "spiritual sub- stance" of the universe upon which all life and forms depend and hence the prayer for rain is also a prayer for fertility, health - indeed creation itself.16 On the other hand, Hopi ritual smoking involves participation in the sacred, or what Whorf (1950: 69) calls the "heart of the Cos- mos." There the smokers are said to give each 13 For some discussions of Hopi burial customs as well as their understanding of death and rebirth, see: Beaglehole and Beaglehole 1935: 11-15; O'Kane 1953: 240-242; Helen Sekaquaptewa 1969: 148-150; Stephen 1936: 824-828; Talayesva 1942: 256-257, 262, 270, 284, 288, 313-318; Voth 1912¿&gt;: 99-103; Yava 1978: 107-109. 14 Much more can be said about the nature of Muy'ingwa. For example, Muy'ingwa seems to be both personal and impersonal. On the one hand the Hopi discuss Muy'ingwa as though he were a personal deity who sends forth rain and crops from himself. At the same time, however, the Hopi discuss Muy'ingwa in more impersonal terms by saying that Muy'ingwa reveals himself wherever there is rain and crops. Muy'ingwa thus appears to be both an anthropomorphic deity and a cosmic revelation. 1D See the Hopi production, "Nawatniwa: A Hopi Philosophical Statement." 16 Hieb 1979a: 577; 1979b: 65. - Hieb drew his con- clusions about "spiritual substance" from informants as well as from Voth 1901: 146. Anthropos 81.1986</page><page sequence="7">Supplication and Participation 183 other a drink which "means rains from the clouds" (Parsons [ed.] 1925: 121 n. 185). If the smokers produce large dense clouds then the rains will be heavy; if not, the rains will be light and brief (Stephen 1936: 681 n. 1). One aspect of the above seems consonant with the principle of supplication. That is to say, the production of large dense clouds of smoke indicates great humility and sacrifice before the sacred and is rewarded with much rain. However, on the participatory level of Hopi prayer, the Hopi are reaching into the rhythms of their cosmos in order to help them move ahead in a life- supporting manner. A Hopi succinctly states the above participatory principle as follows: A true Hopi is a part of the universe and must keep himself in balance. ... All things, animate and inanimate, have life and being. A true Hopi tries to be aware of the deep spiritual essence that is at the heart of all things. All things have inner meaning and form and power. The Hopi must reach into nature and help it move forward in its cycles, harmoniously and beautifully.17 Or to quote another Hopi, "nature's forces may work against you, but if you attune your life to nature she will work in your favor" (Helen Sekaquaptewa 1969: 256). It is the above understanding that Frazer's followers incorrectly label "magical," for the Hopi may participate in the sacred only to the extent that they align their breath with the cosmic breath that is "very something." Ed- ward Kennard, in editing one of Benjamin Whorfs articles, notes that hikwsi and a'ne himu are both perceived by Hopi as "the very heart of the Cosmos itself (Whorf 1950: 69 n. 2). In other words they are the same. Each Hopi, indeed virtually each life form, is under- stood to embody hikwsi, that is, a "spark" of the "Giver of the Breath of Life." It is often said about the Hopi that they feel a close relationship with their world. I agree, for many Hopi have related their sense of unity with the world. For example, the unity that the Hopi feel with all life forms by and through the sharing of the "spiritual substance" is expressed well in a quote by Jim Kewanwytewa: To the Hopi all life is one - it is the same. This world where he lives is the human world and in it all the animals, birds, insects, and every living creature, as well as the trees and plants also have life ... share the spark of life with us humans (Nequate- wa 1936: 133-134 n. 59 [emphasis mine]).18 The Hopi cosmogony tells how the Hopi, after gestating in the womb of Mother Earth, emerged through the womb of the earth (sipaa- puni) in the "long ago."19 Such an "Emergence Mythology" has been described and interpreted well by Charles Long who notes that those peoples who share emergence cosmogonies embody the following perceptions: Men have emerged from the earth, but the potencies and latencies within the earth are still part of his world. No fundamental break with the powers has taken place. The bonds of the earth constitute the immanent principle which operates in all phenomena (Long 1963: 44). Long's remarks help illuminate the Hopi perception of "spiritual substance" which is understood as the "immanent principle" that each cosmic form embodies. The Hopi are, of course, human and have emerged from the world's unity into time and space, but they nonetheless remain rooted in the non-duality of the spiritual substance. It is perhaps instructive to note here that the Hopi's main traditional food, corn, is homologized with themselves in a very profound manner. Corn is likened to the 17 Qoyawayma 1964: 128-129. - Qoyawayma's father worked for several years with Voth and was one of his principal informants. 18 Similar remarks by Hopi relating to their sense of unity with the world are well known in the literature. For example, see: Beaglehole 1936: 23-24; O'Kane 1953: 158, 161-162, 177, 240; Stephen 1936: 1313; 1929: 15; Whiting 1939:6-7. 19 There are numerous accounts of Hopi emergence myths. See: Courlander 1971: 17-33; 1982: 3-15; Cushing 1923; Goldfrank 1948: 244-250; Nequatewa 1936: 1-26; Helen Sekaquaptewa 1969: 224-228; Stephen 1929: 3-13; 1936: 11, 137, 150, 153-154, 217, 928; Talayesva 1942: 417-420; Voth 1905: 1-27; Wallis 1936: 2-17; Yava 1978: 4, 38-41.

Corn is furthermore homologized with the earth, both being referred to as "Mother." Both earth and corn are perceived as relatives by the Hopi and are understood to relate to the Hopi be- cause they too embody the spiritual essence of the cosmos. Kennard once recorded a conversa- tion between a ceremonial father and his son following tribal initiation which demonstrates nicely the homologies drawn between the Hopi and corn: um hapi qa9öniwti 'You really have become corn'; urn put toko9taqe9e hintiq nu9 pu9 toko9 ita 'If you have that as flesh, why do I have that as flesh?', kemu pipas 9um qaoniw9iwta 'It is not that you have beco- me real corn,' 9um hapi itanguy co:nanta pi yep sosoyhimu 9atkyangaqsa 9a9aniwa put 9um pa:lat akw yep haqam qatu 'You have been nursing (sucking) on our mother (earth) for everything here grows up from below,' hak po: sit 9uyingwu pu9 pam ci9y- akngwu 'Whenever one plants seeds, they sprout,' paisato kuyivangwu 'After a while it appears above the ground' pu9 aw yok- vaq9o put pa:layat9a akw na.wungnangwu 'Then it rains on it, and with its juice (moisture) makes it grow,' pu po:sive9e 9amtiwtiq9o 'When it has eyes (kernels) it becomes ripe,' put 9a hak naUokotangwu 'One makes his flesh with that,' pangso hak 9 ahoy nimangwu 9i9 hak qatungwa9ata, 'When one goes back home (to earth, by dying) this (body) is a stalk': pamsa pipay nukwsiwtingwu 'By itself it is no longer useful,' niq 9a9piniqa hikwsi 9aniwtiqa 'And afterwards, the breath forms life,' pam hapi sucep qatungwu 'That is what always lives,' put 9um hapi 9uqaciniqata 9 aw na9saslawu 'That is what you are pre- paring for in your life' (Kennard 1972: 471). The Hopi share with corn and the earth the breath of the cosmos that constitutes all there is. Breath, or rather an aspect of the moisture embodied within breath, is perceived by the Hopi to be the source, sustenance, and destiny of all cosmic life and forms. The aspect of moisture which is perceived as sacred by the Hopi is given a name kept secret from the uninitiated. Indeed, one of the primary pur- poses of the early Hopi initiations is to intro- duce young Hopi to the understanding that a spiritual essence undergirds the material world. I mentioned earlier the Hopi phenomenon of Cloud People to which prayers for rain are directed. The Cloud People are synonymous with katsinam, perfect spiritual beings who manifest themselves anywhere there is mois- ture.20 The Hopi hold that any manifestation of moisture is a revelation of the sacred which helps one to understand why the Hopi almost always pray primarily for rain. Rain, or rather an aspect of rain, is the source of life and creation and thus a prayer for rain is above all a prayer for the creation of the world. The sacred moisture that is constitutive of the cosmos is also seen as constitutive of the Hopi also. The self-perception of Hopi as embodiments of the "spiritual substance" is fundamental and relates even to their understanding of birth and kin- ship. As Louis Hieb first noted, the Hopi, when discussing kinship, do not say, "I am of the same flesh and blood as my parents"; but rather, "I am the liquid substance of my fathers [ancestors, katsinam]" (Hieb 1979:65). Thus the "spiritual substance" is that which perva- sively relates the Hopi to other people and to the world. The Hopi perception of moisture as sacred is clearly seen in at least one version of the Hopi cosmogony from Third Mesa which begins, "A very long time ago there was noth- ing but water" (Voth 1905: 1). Furthermore, the underworld (spiritual realm) is also describ- 20 Literally hundreds of works have been written about Hopi katsinam. I cannot here take up the many theories concerning katsinam, but will note that they are perceived as Hopi ancestors who are also "refractions" (Evans-Pritchard) of the sacred. For recent syntheses of the data on katsinam, see: Loftin 1983: 302-308; Malotki 1983: 19-37. Earle's and Kennard's short work (1971) remains a fine interpretive account. Another fine work on katsinam published recently by a Hopi is Lewis 1981: 110-119. The Hopi feel the presence of katsinam whenever rain or gentle breezes are manifested.

To return to ritual smoking at the participa- tory level, I am suggesting that the Hopi align their breath with the "Giver of the Breath of Life" so that they can participate in the creative and life-sustaining rhythms öf the cosmos. Yet one problem remains in my interpretation - how do the Hopi align hikwsi with a'ne himul If posed with that question, a Hopi will almost invariably answer, "by following the path of the hisatsinom [people of long ago, ancestors]." The hisatsinom who lived in the "time before there was time" could communicate freely with the sacred essence of the cosmos because they were constantly aware of the spiritual substance that constitutes all cosmic forms and rhythms, including themselves. The Hopi say that when all beings emerged to this world, "all could speak to each other, the animals, and all vegeta- tion," because then, "the whole universe was endowed with the same breath-rocks, trees, grass, earth, all animals and men."21 Thus the Hopi ancestors experienced a relationship of unity with the sacred essence of the world. By repeating the pattern of being established in the Beginning by the hisatsinom, the contemporary Hopi are able to transcend their strictly human status and thereby re-experience and participate in the non-duality of the constitutive principle of the universe. O'Kane perhaps best sums up that which the Hopi learned from the ancestors when he says, "To the Hopis the essence of it all is to seek what they term 'a good heart,' a way of life in which a man is ... constantly aware that he is a part of a great, immortal spirit world" (O'Kane 1953: 177). I shall return below to a fuller discussion of the function performed by a "good heart" in Hopi prayer, but want now to emphasize the importance Hopi attribute to realizing the spiritual dimen- sion of the cosmos, including humans. As will soon be more clear, the Hopi feel that they can participate in the revelations of the "very something" precisely because their "breath" is not different or distant from the sacred. 185 3. Spiritual-Material Undergirdings and Interrelationships To return to my discussion of Hopi ritual, the Hopi term for prayer, according to Benjamin Whorf, is natwanta, which means to concen- trate spiritually "on a hope to bring it to pass through meditative prayer" (Stephen 1936: 1261). Kennard, however, lists naawakna as the Hopi term for prayer which means "to want ... to pray to wish and to will" (Kennard 1937: 492). O'Kane (1950: 240) seems to echo Ken- nard's position when he says, "To pray is to will that it shall come to pass. The word for prayer is identical with that for wishing and willing" (see also O'Kane 1953: 170). In 1983, I visited Hopi and attempted to obtain some clarification of the above discrepancy concerning the Hopi term for prayer. I was told that both terms are related to the ritual act of praying. Naawakna means to wish and will for a desired event and natwanta (Whorf s na'twanta) means to act out symbolically the desired event. The above two aspects of Hopi prayer were generally referred to by Joseph and Thompson (1944: 41) as "the physical and the psychical." They realized as scholars that all Hopi ceremo- nies require proper physical activity and para- phernalia as well as what the Hopi call a "good heart."22 Fruitful prayer acts are dependent on the harmonious union of physical and psychical dimensions. Hopi prayer is always mediated by and through some material phenomenon such as sacred tobacco smoke, prayer stick (paaho), breath feather (nakwakwusi), sacred cornmeal (homngumnî) and/or physical activity. Such practice is commensurate with the fundamental Hopi perception that the sacred manifests itself by and through the profane. In other words, for the Hopi "nature is never purely 'natural' " (Eliade 1958: 38), or as Ortiz (1972: 143) re- vealed, the Hopi and other Pueblos think that all things have "matter and essence" (see also O'Kane 1953: 239). In prayer, the Hopi must perform proper ritual observances laid down by the ancestors and they must do so with "good 21 Wallis 1936: 10; Stephen 1936: 706, see also 1254-1255, 1308. 22 Joseph and Thompson 1944: 41; see also Titiev 1972: 62; O'Kane 1950: 212. Anthropos 81.1986</page><page sequence="10">186 John D. Loftin hearts," that is with thoughts of harmony and fertility. The spiritual and material dimensions of the prayer act must be harmoniously interre- lated. Each dimension is necessary for the other, and neither is reducible to the other. The spiritual and material dimensions for the Hopi always constitute a paradoxical totality. The spiritual dimension of the Hopi is the sacred moisture on which all life and forms depend. Hence, the spiritual is indeed related to the material. The spiritual substance is the source, sustenance, and end of all cosmic life and forms. Everything depends upon it and without it there would be nothing. The above Hopi understanding is perhaps best revealed in their cosmogony which clearly indicates that the Hopi experience their world as created by the "very something" that is sacred.23 That is, the very creation of the world's life and forms was effected by and through the spiritual substance of the Hopl. Indeed, the Hopi perceive the primordial problem of humanity to be the belief "that they [humanity] had created themselves" (Courlander 1971: 19). Conversely, though interrelated, the Hopi material world is simultaneously related to the spiritual. The life and forms of the Hopi cosmos are perceived as revelations or manifestations of the spiritual substance. It is not that the Hopi perceive their world and then reason or believe that the world has a spiritual undergirding; rather their perception embodies the experience of the spiritual. Bradfield was the first scholar to note that Hopi gods are not simply perceived as personal deities who control various cosmic events (1973/11:267). According to him, the Hopi perceive their gods whenever and wher- ever certain cosmic events such as rain, light- ning, death, etc. are manifested. Thus, he states that Sotukinangw (Sho'tokununwa) is not to be understood as a "god of lightning." Rather, where lightning reveals itself, there is Sotuki- nangw. I think Bradfield is essentially correct in his interpretation of Hopi deities as the mani- festation of various cosmic events. However, I would add that the Hopi perceive the sacred by and through cosmic forms as well as rhythms. I agree that the Hopi perceive lightning as an event or happening, but what about stone? Stone strikes the Hopi as a cosmic form rather than an event. Stone and shell are experienced as manifestations of Huru'ingw Wuhti and/or Poqangwhoya and are felt to be permanent revelations. Borrowing from Evans-Pritchard,24 I think that various Hopi deities should be understood as so many "refractions" of the "very something" that constitutes the cosmos. One Hopi, when discussing Hopi katsinam seemed to confirm the above when she said that they "represent elements, qualities, and inhabi- tants of our universe."25 It is not that the Hopi have many gods and are hence polytheistic (to use an Enlightenment term of little value). Rather, the Hopi understand that the "spiritual substance" manifests itself by and through the various forms and rhythms of the cosmos. The Hopi thus know of one sacred principle that reveals itself in many modes of manifestation. To quote a Hopi: 23 The Hopi's passive or receptive experience of their world is mentioned explicitly in at least one version of their cosmogony (Courlander 1971: 19). Courlander, in another work (1982: 138-139), relates a conversation be- tween a Hopi woman and an Anglo male in which the Hopi woman emphasized the receptive character of humanity based on the creation of the world by a "Great Spirit." - Perhaps the passive character of religious experience is best revealed by and through the cosmogonies found among all known peoples. All creation myths, despite their variations, reveal quite profoundly that some anony- mous and autonomous "other" created the world and its inhabitants. See: Long 1963; Van Baaren 1955: 4-13. - For more general discussions of the way in which religious experience emphasizes passive or receptive dimensions, see: Eliade 1959:202-203; Leenhardt 1979:19^-21, 69; Long 1967. 24 Evans-Pritchard (1956: 107) coined the term "re- fraction" when studying the religious orientation of the Nuer. He noticed that the Nuer apparently worshipped many gods, each of which corresponded to some cosmic rhythm or form. However, he finally realized that the many apparent gods of the Nuer were all so many particular manifestations of one sacred essence. For an excellent example of a Native American description and interpretation of the way the sacred is understood as manifesting itself in many modes, see the conversation between the Oglala Sioux Finger and J.R. Walker (Walker 1917: 154-156). 25 Lewis 1981: 113. - This paper also addresses important issues of religion and modernity among the Hopl. Anthropos 81.1986</page><page sequence="11">Supplication and Participation 187 The sun, the moon, and the stars are the work of a great Power. This Power created them. We speak of Mother Earth, but it is not the earth who created all the creatures that live on the earth. It is this same Power that made the sun and moon and stars. That is what we worship - the Great Power (O'Kane 1953: 161-162). The Hopi, as a people, feel "chosen" to the extent that they were granted the ability "long ago" to participate in the rhythms of their cosmos.26 However, they can only do so if they direct their breath in unison with the "Giver of the Breath of Life" so that they are no longer separate from the world. "Good hearts" and "straight breath" as taught by the hisatsinom are necessary if Hopi prayers are to bear fruit as is well known. That is to say, the Hopi must align their breath, their spiritual substance with the sacred so that they transcend their strictly human status of historicity. Furthermore, if prayers are to be effective all Hopi involved must meditate in unison.27 One bad thought can ruin a prayer rite by disrupting the unity be- tween the sacred and the hearts of the Hopl. As one Hopi told Stephen, the Hopi feel that they receive world-sustaining rains in their harsh, semi-desert environment because, "our hearts beat together; all our speech is straight and travels in the same direction; all our prayers ... converge upon the same object at the same time" (Stephen 1936: 879). When the Hopi pray they do so by and through some material object, e.g., smoke, prayer stick, breath feather. I shall say more about the significance of the objects used, but for now wish to note that they do so because of the insoluble connection they perceive between the material and the spiritual. In terms of ritual smoking the above means that the sacred tobac- co smoke clouds produced by a Hopi do not act magically to cause rain clouds. Neither homeo- pathic nor contagious magic is involved in smoking for rain among the Hopl. It is not that the Hopi think that the likeness of tobacco smoke causes rain cloud formations nor that rain clouds are caused by the contact of tobacco smoke with the sky. I have specifically asked a number of initiated Hopis about the above ideas and all agreed that Hopi prayer involves no such causal laws. At the supplicatory level, smoke clouds are sacrificial prayer offerings to the Cloud People (katsinam) that also inform the sacred of that which they desire, that is, clouds-rain-life. Clearly at that level there can be no question of magical thoughts for transcen- dent deities, "other" than human, are petition- ed to reciprocate the smoke offering with rain. In terms of participation in the sacred, the tobacco clouds are microcosmic representations of rain clouds by and through which the smo- kers unite their hearts and breath in order to will forth rain on a cosmic scale. In other terms, the Hopi are attempting to participate in the rhythms of the cosmos through a microcosmic rehearsal of the desired future event. Again, though the material rehearsal (natwanta) must be accompanied by proper thoughts (naawak- na) if the prayer is to prove effective. As Stephen puts it, "without unison in thoughts and actions, prayers are nearly always ineffectu- al, the prayer-sticks are not looked at nor the song-prayers listened to by the deities" (1936: 848). Participation in the sacred by the Hopi is clearly revealed in katsina dances, where Hopi impersonate the perfect, spiritual beings, who bless the Hopi with rain. The Hopi dance various katsinam from the day after Wuwtsim until the conclusion of the Nimankatsina cere- mony (roughly December to late July).28 Impersonate is, however, a poor choice of terms, for the Hopi, through proper ritual observances and thoughts, become identified with the katsinam they dance. One Hopi stated that when a Hopi participates in a katsina 26 Personal communication, Emory Sekaquaptewa, Third Mesa, 1980. 27 O'Kane 1950: 240; personal communication, Third Mesa, 1980. 28 Strictly speaking, the Hopi katsina season does not officially open until the arrival of the Qoqoqlom Katsinam on the last day of Soyalangw in December (Titiev 1944: 111-114). - For some excellent myths of the origin of katsinam, see: Curtis 1922: 99; Nequatewa 1936: 79^3; Stephen 1929: 60-63; 1936: 261; Voth 1904: 16-30; Talay- esva 1942: 86. Anthropos 81.1986</page><page sequence="12">188 John D. Loftin dance, "he loses his identity and actually be- comes what he is representing" (Emory Seka- quaptewa 1976: 39). Another wrote that during katsina performances, "we were turning our- selves into real katcinas, like those who used to visit the village and help the people" (Talayesva 1942: 181; see also O'Kane 1953: 175). However, though the Hopi may periodical- ly transcend their humanity and participate in the sacred as katsinam, they also realize at other times their distance from the sacred. The Hopi hold clown (tsuku) ceremonies during the katsina season at which time they portray human traits of gluttony, selfishness, obscenity, arrogance, etc. in order to reveal how they are but should not be. In other words, clowning refers to the specifically human aspect of being that is separate from the sacred essence of the cosmos. Still there is a sacred dimension to clowning for clowns repeat the primordial pat- terns of the ancestral Hopi clown youth and clown maiden. The Hopi hold that their ances- tors also had a clown nature at the time of their emergence to this world, a dimension of their being that could only be overcome by death, when the Hopi become katsinam. The Hopi understand themselves as para- doxical beings, both sacred #nd profane, as kat- sina and tsuku ceremonies reveal. They, there- fore, perceive the sacred as related yet distant, immanent yet transcendent. It is that paradoxi- cal understanding o{4he sacred which is refract- ed through Hopi prayer acts. As humans, the sacred is experienced as distant and hence the Hopi supplicate the sacred through prayer of- ferings. Yet, as spiritual beings the sacred is experienced as related and thus the Hopi may participate in the sacred through prayer acts. However, I should note that the Hopi experience both dimensions of the sacred as symbolic of the constitutive character of the sacred. In other words, both immanence and transcendence are experienced passively, as revealing that the sacred creates them before they project themselves into the world. When the Hopi supplicate the sacred they are clearly emphasizing the fundamentally passive or receptive character of their mode of being. The sacred is experienced as prior to them and thus they petition the sacred for their needs. Yet the same is true when they participate in the sacred for it is not "they" that participate but their "breath bodies," that is, the "spark" of the "very something" which every Hopi embodies. Through proper ritual purification, the Hopi can transcend their emergence from the sacred and become reunified with the sacred. Then they can participate in the sacred because they cease to be unrelated, that is, strictly human. In neither case are Hopi prayer acts magical, for both modes presuppose the passive experience of the world. Magic presupposes an active appropriation of the world in which humans control the world through the manipulation of objects which invariably cause certain effects. According to Frazer (1922: 824), "in magic man depends on his own strength to meet the diffi- culties and dangers that beset him on every side." The Hopi, by contrast, depend on the spiritual substance of the cosmos to bring forth and sustain the blessing of life. 4. Paaho The Hopi often breathe their prayers onto prayer sticks {paavaho), sticks of differing lengths to which are attached various grasses and plants, feathers and a corn husk packet containing grass seeds, a pinch of cornmeal, a pinch of pollen, and a drop of honey.29 The making of paavaho occurs especially during various ceremonies down in the kiikiva and, indeed, Bradfield writes (1973/11: 191) that con- struction and blessing on prayer sticks consti- tutes the primary work done in the kiva. Differ- ent prayer sticks are made by different Hopi at different times for different purposes, though all paavaho embody a prayer for moisture. Talayesva stated once in describing the Soya- langw rite that paaho making "is the most important work in the world, that the gods and spirits are holding out their hands for pahos, and that if the Soy al should fail, life for the Hopi might end" (Talayesva 1942: 169-170). 29 For pictures and descriptions of various types of Hopi paavaho, see: Wright 1979: 85-90; Voth 1901: pl. XLI. Anthropos 81.1986</page><page sequence="13">Supplication and Participation 189 The feathers, grasses, and plants vary on paavaho depending on the particular blessing, in addition to rain, that is petitioned.30 If a prayer for rain is emphasized, the Hopi may attach yellow bird or duck feathers. Yellow bird feathers are linked with the coming of spring rains and the blossoming of yellow flowers, while duck feathers are associated with water. For warmth, the Hopi may attach either cow bird, fly-catcher, warbler, or owl feathers, as well as maa'övi and kunya (mountain sage- brush) sprigs. The sight of the above-mentioned birds are linked with warm weather as are maa'övi and kunya plants. Pine needles and bluebird feathers symbolize prayers for cold weather. Bluebirds migrate away from Hopi during winter and pines keep their needles throughout the winter. In order to increase wild game and cattle, soho grass is tied to the paaho for it is a favorite animal food. The corn husk packet containing seeds, cornmeal, pollen, and honey symbolizes a prayer that Mother Earth will bring forth plenty of moisture in order that the Hopi may have a bountiful harvest (Qoya- wayma 1964: 86). The corn husk packet also contains "food for the prayer while it is on its way so that it may have strength and be sure to reach its destination" (O'Kane 1953: 148). The sacred breath (hikwsi), on its journey towards its source, the sacred, does not actually ingest the food but rather inhales the essence or odor of the food (Voth 1905: 116; 1912a: 55). Final- ly, yet most importantly, each paaho contains a downy eagle breast feather attached to a piece of cotton string "because that is always the breath of life" (O'Kane 1953: 148; see also Means 1960: 121). The downy feathers are not heavy (Stephen 1936: 1271) and symbolize the spiritual essence in all of creation (Qoyawayma 1964: 86). Or as one Hopi related about breath feathers, "they represent falling rain" (Voth 1905: 117; see also Stephen 1936: 791). In other words, the paaho is above all a prayer for the spiritual moisture that gives forth life. Bradfield states that Hopi prayer sticks embody a primordial "mimetic element" that acts "compulsively" on the like thing represent- ed on the paaho (1973/11: 195). He argues that the "compulsive strain" is strong in Hopi ritual and historically preceded the worship and sup- plication of "personalized deities controlling such natural forces as clouds, germination, ice, and cold" (195). It may be that the idea of personal gods controlling cosmic events is a late religious development among the Hopi, and indeed I am not sure it exists among the initiated priests and elders. At the same time, however, I see no evidence to support Brad- field's contention that a magical perception of the universe preceded the worship of gods among the Hopl. I tried to demonstrate in the previous section that the Hopi do not perceive the material dimension of the cosmos apart from the spiritual. The material and spiritual aspects of the world form an irreducible, para- doxical totality according to the Hopi and, therefore, I do not think paavaho act compul- sively on the world. As one Hopi father replied to his inquiring daughter when asked about the theory of the paaho, "the good it does depends on many things. ... It depends most of all on the faith of the one who made the paho" (Qoya- wayma 1964: 86). To be effective, a Hopi's prayer must embody a "good heart" and "straight breath." Again let me quote Talayes- va who tells us that, when making paavaho, "we were instructed to keep our minds pure and filled with these thoughts while we worked and wished strongly for rain, good crops, and long life" (Talayesva 1942: 170). The above seems to me to dismiss the theory that paavaho act automatically on the like thing they repre- sent, for clearly bad thoughts can ruin the prayer. Stephen, closely following a Hopi infor- mant, put forth the basic Hopi theory of the paaho at the supplicatory level: A man makes a prayer-stick because he wants something good, some benefit. O'mquwu (Cloud), Na'nanivak Mon'mowi- tu (Chief of the Directions), Patu'shunula (Ice Chief), Mu'yinwa (Planting Chief) - from these, and other chiefs, all benefits proceed. 30 The following discussion is taken from: O'Kane 1953: 14&amp;-149; Stephen 1936:782, 1271-1272; Voth 1901: 76-77. Anthropos 81.1986</page><page sequence="14">190 John D. Loftin Feathers are used in prayer-sticks and breath-feathers, because they are ka-pu'tu, 'not heavy,' i.e., light; and Cloud, and all the other chiefs, desire them to make the fringe of feathers with which to decorate their foreheads. The Hopi barters his prayer-offerings with those chiefs for the benefits he desires to receive from them. He exchanges prayer- sticks and breath-feathers for material benefits. He places on his prayer-stick the prescribed feather and grass emblems, in accordance with the kind of material or other benefit that he may desire. ... As Sun journeys over the earth, he sees the prayer-sticks and breath-feathers, and comes to them and inhales their essence and takes them. He does not take up the material sticks and string and feathers, but their breath body, hi'ksi adta ah'paa, their picha'n adta, likeness. He places them in his girdle and goes in at the west to the Below (at'kya) and gives them all that he has collected through the day's journey to Mu'yinwa. Mu'yinwa knows all prayer- sticks and breath-feathers, and as he takes them up one by one and looks at each, he says to the other chiefs: 'this is for you, or you,' according as the prayer-sticks are designed. Those that are ill-made, or made by men of evil hearts, he casts away, saying: 'this one is from a bad man, ka-ho'pi, a foolish one.' The chiefs thank Mu'yinwa and the makers of the emblems, and deco- rate their foreheads with the feathers, and send the benefits that the prayer-maker desires (see Stephen 1936: 1271-1272). At the supplicatory level of the paaho the Hopi exchange an offering to a deity (in this case anthropomorphic) for some material bless- ing. At this level Hopi prayer seems to embody a principle of reciprocity between the Hopi and their gods. The offerings given to the gods by the Hopi are worn as decorations. One Hopi myth relates that the gods are living poorly and desire more prayer-offerings with which to decorate their foreheads (Voth 1905: 117). Fur- thermore, the nakwakwusi are said to represent falling rain which the gods claim they will bring in response to properly sent offerings. I should also note that the paaho will be effective in bringing forth rain and life only if properly made with a good heart. Hence, both physical and spiritual dimensions of the prayer act, natwanta and naawakna, must be harmoniously interrelated for the prayer to bear fruit. Bradfield, to support his theory of magic with regard to paavaho, notes an example in which a Hopi said, the yellow bird is used because this yellow bird constantly scatters the fructifying pol- len; its color shows that, and when there is no rain, there are no yellow birds; when there is plenty of rain, there are plenty of grass seeds and multitudes of yellow birds are seen eating seeds and scattering the life-giving pollen over the land (Bradfield 1973: 195).51 Bradfield argues that the Hopi's use of yellow bird feathers on paavaho is "mimetic," that is, embodies the theory that like causes or pro- duces like. He thus argues that the Hopi are utilizing what Frazer calls the homeopathic branch of sympathetic magic. Again, Bradfield is well aware of the supplicatory dimension of Hopi prayer but argues that it occurs later in Hopi history along with the emergence of anthropomorphic gods. However, it seems to me that Hopi prayer acts embody no magical premises, or if they do, I think that those presuppositions arose very late in their history. I agree with Otto (1923: 118) that "the conception of Nature as a single connected system of events united by laws is the final and most difficult outcome of abstraction." In other words, if the Hopi hold a magical understanding of prayer, I think such a theory represents a later degradation of their initial religious perceptions. At the participato- ry level, I think that the yellow flowers used in paavaho are the material, microcosmic medium by and through which the Hopi unite their hearts in meditation. Hopi prayer at both the supplicatory and participatory levels requires natwanta and naawakna, the harmonious inter- 31 Bradfield took this quote from Stephen 1936: 782. Anthropos 81.1986</page><page sequence="15">Supplication and Participation 191 twining of material and spiritual dimensions. For the Hopi the material and spiritual dimen- sions of the cosmos form an irreducible totality so that one does not exist without the other. Therefore, Hopi prayers must be mediated by and through some material object or physical activity. The Hopi may participate in the sacred periodically by uniting their hearts with the "heart of the Cosmos," but their breath must inhabit something that is material if they are to reach into and help move the world's rhythms. The Hopi say that their ancestors taught them how to pray for life in this world. The proper preparation of different prayer offerings was revealed to the Hopi in the Beginning, when all life and forms emerged from the sipaapuni. By repeating the process taught by the his at si nom, in the time before time when all life and forms were of one breath, the Hopi feel that they can return again to that mythical era and thereby participate in the sacred. All Hopi prayer acts are, as a Hopi friend told me, "commemora- tive" in the sense that they return the Hopi to the timeless time of the emergence. Because of the above, the Hopi feel that all properly sent prayers will be answered fruitfully. At the supplicatory level, though, the Hopi experience their distance from the "very something," they nonetheless feel that the sacred (whether per- sonal and/or impersonal) is obliged to recipro- cate a properly sent prayer offering with moisture and creation.32 Part of the Hopi ancestry involves a clown nature, but that mor- tal nature is nonetheless sacred in that it was granted to the Hopi at their emergence to this world. At the participatory level, the return to the "long ago" allows the Hopi to overcome their humanity in the strict sense such that they can align their breath bodies with the Giver of the Breath of Life and help move the rhythms of the cosmos. In both cases the Hopi expect proper prayer offerings to be rewarded. Indeed, Talayesva (1942: 230) tells of Hopi elders who actually "scolded" the clouds and ordered them to bring rain. Whether through supplication and its implied reciprocity or participation the Hopi feel, as one Hopi said, that "if we live it [life] properly, it will always rain" (Hillerman 1980: 15). At the same time, the Hopi know of droughts and unanswered prayers. Though unanswered prayers are generally thought to occur because of bad hearts and thoughts, the Hopi also feel that the sacred as transcendent may not bring forth the petitioned desire. We mentioned that Hopi elders will at times scold the katsinam for not reciprocating Hopi prayer offerings with the gift of rain. At the supplicato- ry level, the Hopi expect a proper prayer offering to be answered fruitfully, but ultimate- ly such reciprocity is not always revealed. Therefore, the Hopi also hope to draw pity from the clouds through their sacrificial humil- ity so that they may receive moisture for their crops. As Talayesva was told by his uncles and fathers: y Work hard, keep the ceremonies, live peaceably, and unite your heart with ours so that our messages will reach the Cloud People. Then maybe they will pity us and drop the rains on our own fields (Talayesva 1942:224). In other words, at the supplicatory level, reciprocity from the gods for prayer offerings is not assured among the Hopl. Therefore, the Hopi also attempt to evoke pity from the katsinam as humble creatures in need of their blessing. Supplication is itself then paradoxical for it involves principles of both pity and reci- procity. However, the transcendence of the sacred is maintained at the supplicatory level because of the fact that the sacred may or may not answer one's prayer. 32 Sam Gill (1977-1978) has written that the Navajo (who live adjacent to the Hopi) state their prayers to the Holy People in an "imperative verbal mode." By follow- ing proper ritual procedures taught in the Beginning by the Holy People, the Navajo establish a relationship with the Holy People which "obliges" them to respond to the prayer request properly offered. Gill mentions the necessi- ty for a "good heart" ("right intentions") among the Navajo and says that the efficacy of their prayer songs (performative utterances) depends on the perfect physical and spiritual execution of the prayer act as taught by a Holy Person. Gill argues that Navajo prayer is not magical in nature for their mythology reveals that inappropriate offerings were never reciprocated. Thus, Navajo prayer presupposes a sacred other with which the Navajo must communicate. It would be interesting to see if the Navajo also, embody a theory of participation by and through spiritual concentration. Anthropos 81.1986</page><page sequence="16">192 John D. Loftin The theory of the paaho is closely related to theories of the nakwakwusi (breath feather) and homngumni (sacred cornmeal). The Hopi also breathe their prayers onto those objects which represent both a prayer offering to the sacred and microcosmic manifestation of their desires. I discussed above the symbolism of the nakwak- wusi which forms a part of each paaho that is prepared. Prayer through homngumni is per- haps the most common of all formal Hopi prayer modes. Generally, homngumni is prepared from white corn, the color white being associated with and indeed being a "chromatic prayer" for purity and clouds.33 For the Hopi, white is symbolic of the spiritual substance which is pure and manifests itself in clouds. At the participa- tory level, the Hopi attempt to align their breath bodies with the spiritual substance sym- bolized by the whiteness of the homngumni. The whiteness of the homngumni is likened to the whiteness of the eagle down feathers and the whiteness of the tobacco clouds. The Hopi embody their spirits within the materiality of the sacred cornmeal which serves as a microcos- mic representation of that which they desire, i.e., rain-crops-food-life. At the supplicatory level, the cornmeal is an offering to the sacred, the essence of which the sacred will inhale. The homngumni also serves to inform the sacred of their desires. I mentioned with regard to smoking that a sacrificial element was involved at the supplica- tory level. Smoking burns the throat of the participant and reveals a sense of determined humility before the sacred. The same sense of sacrifice is apparent in the other modes of prayer I have so far examined. Homngumni reveals hard work in and of itself for it must be ground by hand with stone tools. Homngumni presupposes the full agricultural cycle as well as milling the grain and thus manifests much hard work. Hard work is also demonstrated in the preparation of nakwakwusi for they are taken from the breasts of eagles who are captured alive by hand in nests which are situated in cliff walls. The search for eagles is very tiring and dangerous so that the fact of their possession indicates tremendous sacrifice on the part of the Hopl. The Hopi pray by and through sacred corn- meal in a variety of instances. For instance, many Hopi women traditionally offered corn- meal to the rising sun each morning (Qoyaway- ma 1964: 16) and they continue to offer prayers with homngumni to the sun whenever a child is named. On the twentieth day after birth, a Hopi child is named.34 Then the mother's mother, if living, takes a handful of cornmeal and makes a path across the floor from the far wall of the house through the door and out. The line is called a pöötavi (road) and points to the east as a prayer for long life. The mother and her mother now take the infant outside the house for the first time and present the child to the rising sun. First, the mother's mother, or the attendant, breathes a silent prayer onto homngumni and casts the meal to the sun. Then, uncovering the baby's face and allowing sun to shine on it, the mother's mother places some homngumni in the baby's mouth with her left hand, sucks it out and blows it toward the "sun father" four times as a prayer for long life. In addition, Hopi men breathe prayers onto meal throughout Hopiwiimi and when farming or hunting. Indeed, ritual smoking, paavaho, nakwakwusi, and homngumni constitute the most visible forms of Hopi prayer and in many circumstances all modes are utilized at some point, the order depending on Hopi traditions. In other words, the above prayer acts are in ma;iy cases not mutually exclusive rites but rather are often conjoined. 5. Salavi Another Hopi prayer modality which may seem magical at first glance utilizes the branches of Douglas fir (salavi) (Whiting 1939: 63; personal 33 Stephen 1898: 265. - Stephen was the first scholar of the Hopi to note that different colors are symbolic of specific prayers among the Hopl. For a full description of Hopi colors symbolism as well as the association of colors with directions and various cosmic forms, see Hieb 1972: 86-88, 103. 34 For a detailed discussion and interpretation of the Hopi birth and naming rites based on a synthesis of various sources, see Loftin 1983: 144-158. Anthropos 81.1986</page><page sequence="17">Supplication and Participation 193 communication, Third Mesa, 1983). Douglas fir trees abound in the higher elevations around Black Mesa where the annual rainfall is much greater than below in the villages.35 Indeed, the Hopi perception of salavi and increased rainfall parallels the Hopi understanding that Douglas firs are houses of the Cloud people (katsinam) (Stephen 1936: 439; see also 220, 324, 370) and have what one Hopi called a "magnetic power upon which the clouds rest" (Waters 1963: 247).36 The idea of "magnetic power" might be interpreted as an indication of magical thinking among the Hopi, and thus I shall explore prayers for rain utilizing fir trees in more detail. I shall take my example from the Nimankatsina rite, a very important ceremony that occurs annually near the end of July.37 During the sixth day of Niman a party of messengers is sent to Kisiwu spring to gather salavi. They take with them paavaho made by Katsina chief, Powamuy chief, the "fathers" of the katsinam, and the Niman sponsor. Also taken are a mongwikoro (priest's jug), a bone whistle (to call forth the clouds from the six directions), a bullroarer (to imitate the sound of thunder), a pipe and sacred tobacco, and some sacred cornmeal. The party sets out to the northeast toward Kisiwu but stops 'about one-half mile away to camp that night, fhe next morning they arise and begin approaching Kisiwu. When about one hundred yards away, they strip to their loin clothes and loosen their hair. The lead messen- ger, who carries thç priest's jug, pipe, whistle, and bullroarer, leads the others in single file. Arriving at the edge of the spring, the leader announces to the katsinam that they have arriv- ed with happy hearts. Prayer sticks are then deposited in a dry spot near the spring. All smoke and then the leader gathers some sacred spring water in the mongwikoro. The jug itself is a small clay receptacle that is carried in a net and is a material medium for prayer. It remains suspended in air until the party arrives back at the kiva for it calls forth rain to the point where it is set down. Later, after lunch, the men gather salavi. First, the leader cuts down one small tree symbolic of a "male," while his assistant cuts down a "female"; these are called "brother" and "sister." Breath feathers are attached to the holes remaining as payment for the trees. The party next gathers other plants to be danced at Niman as well as more salavi to be used as collars for the Hemis, the katsinam most often danced at Niman. The remaining prayer offerings are then deposited as a lump payment for the rest of the salavi gathered. The party then returns to the village, usually arriv- ing about dusk. The salavi is hidden outside the village after which the party goes to Powa- mu Java and the sponsor's kiva to relate the events of the journey and to smoke for rain. I went into some detail concerning the gathering of salavi used at Niman in order to demonstrate the sacrality of the rite. Prayers are offered at many points during the gathering expedition and happy hearts are deemed neces- sary to bring forth rain. The Hopi do not think that salavi causes rain. Rather, salavi and rain constitute a spiritual-material cosmic totality. Salavi is perceived by the Hopi to be inhabited by katsinam whom they wish to visit their vil- lage. However, the katsinam, though associat- ed with salavi, do not automatically manifest 35 For a detailed discussion of the Hopi environment, see Hack 1942. 36 Waters' book is extremely controversial especially among the Hopi themselves. Emory Sekaquaptewa told me in 1980 that the book has- two basic problems: (1) Much of the information is inaccurate and misleading, and (2) several ceremonial secrets as well as informants' names were improperly published. Emory told me he was present when the alleged voluntary informants mentioned in the book assembled at Hopi and demanded through a letter that Waters come back to Hopi to account for his mis-deeds. Apparently, Oswald "White Bear" Fredericks, an uninitiated Hopi, helped Waters obtain ceremonially secretive information from various Hopi elders through the use of a hidden tape recorder. Fredericks soon moved to the outskirts of Old Oraibi where he continued to sell his art work for a number of years and it is my understand- ing that Waters never again returned to Hopl. I cited the above quote from John Lansa, for he was a respected Hopi elder and his remarks concerning salavi are appro- priate for publication. See also Yava (1978: 81) for another critique of Book of the Hopl. 37 The following discussion and date were taken from these Third Mesa sources: Earle and Kennard 1971: 41-45; Bradfield 1973/11: 142-149; Talayesva 1942: 13&amp;- 140; Titiev 1944: 12&amp;-129, 227-235; Loftin 1983: 372- 385. Anthropos 81.1986</page><page sequence="18">194 John D. Loftin themselves wherever there is salavi. It is very important during the gathering of salavi for the lopi to maintain good hearts. Once back at the village the salavi is prayed over and purified a number of times and the men continue to strive to keep "straight breath" in order that their prayers prove to be effective. In other words, Hopi prayers for rain by and through salavi also presuppose a sacred other with which they must communicate properly. Salavi in and of itself does not cause life-giving rains among the Hopl. It is both an offering to the Cloud people (though one not constructed by the Hopi) as well as the microcosmic medium by and through which the Hopi focus their breath bodies in participating in the rhythms of the cosmos. 6. Hopi Racing Another Hopi mode of prayer which has been described as "compulsive magic" is running (Titiev 1939: 33). For example, at the end of a day of work in the fields, Hopi farmers will often run one or two kinds of "races," each of which is a prayer for crop growth. They may run a short distance at a fast pace as a prayer that the crops grow quickly or they may run a long distance at a slow pace as a prayer that the sun move slowly toward winter, thus prolonging the growing season (Beaglehole 1937: 40; Talayesva 1942: 230). However, I must disagree with Titiev's interpretation of Hopi running as "mimetic magic" for again I think the Hopi are attempting to communicate with the "very something," the sacred. Running does seem a bit different from the other prayer acts I have so far examined because it seems to embody no offering to the sacred. Rather, at the supplica- tory level, it seems to emphasize hard work and humility before the katsinam in the hope they will pity the petitioner and bring forth the blessing of moisture. Running does symbolize materially the desired fruit, rain, for rain is said to run races along the ground (see below). Simultaneously, running involves a participato- ry structure as well. Hopi farmers also attempt to unify their breaths and hearts with the "Giver of the Breath of Life" in order to will quick crop growth and a long growing season. At the supplicatory level of running the Hopi are attempting to draw pity from the sacred by and through strenuous, sacrificial physical acti- vity while at the level of participation, they are trying to reach into and influence the sacred by and through dedicated, harmonious spiritual activity. In supplication, the Hopi are active physically and receptive spiritually as they hope their own physical efforts will evoke a gift from the spiritual substance. In participation they are passive physically and active spiritually as they feel their spiritual efforts will bring about the manifestation of the spiritual substance. In sup- plication, the Hopi wish for rain and attempt to draw pity from the katsinam by hard work. In participation, the Hopi will bring forth rain by and through the use of their bodies as microcos- mic, material mediums. It is important to remember each Hopi prayer embodies both supplication and participation simultaneously. Naawakna means to will and to wish for a desired event. To will an event is to participate in its manifestation, while to wish for an event is to hope that it will take place. In prayer, the Hopi wish and will simultaneously, that is, they supplicate and participate in the sacred other that constitutes the cosmos. There are several other modes of ritual running involving laymen, priests, and katsinam which take place during the spring and summer months.38 One of the most important ritual races run by Hopi laymen takes place on the eighth and ninth mornings of the Snake- Ante- lope ceremony held in August.39 The race begins outside the village. A water fetcher, who had earlier been to a sacred spring to fill his mongwikoro with water, addresses the racers thusly: Now we shall race joyfully. Hence you strong men do not once detain each other. 38 The Hopi racing season begins three days after the conclusion of Powamuya. See Titiev 1939: 35; Voth 1901: 154. 39 Titiev 1939: 34. - For accounts of the Snake- Antelope rites on Third Mesa, see Loftin 1983: 385-404; Talayesva 1942:42, 72, 206-227, 342; Titiev 1944: 149^154; Voth 1903. Anthropos 81.1986</page><page sequence="19">Supplication and Participation 195 Whoever comes out ahead, on his account we shall drink when the sun has not yet come halfway (soon). Being concerned about this to these our mothers, our fa- thers, to the village, we shall ascend, we shall enter it happily, courageously. Now go! (Voth 1903: 324 n. 6). The water fetcher then starts the race by running towards the village. He carries two offerings, a mongwikoro and a chochokpl. The chochokpi is a long prayer stick to which is attached a rain wheel and stream ball stick. The rain wheel consists of cattail leaves because cattail "is a plant associated with water" (Whit- ing 1939: 64). Duck feathers are sometimes attached to increase the power of the prayer. The stream ball stick (muinkunatoki) is a cylin- der-like object that symbolizes the small clay balls formed by the flow of water in the arroyos and are "considered to be special prayer offer- ings that the washes may rise and flood their thirsty fields" (Voth 1903: 314). The race towards the village is thus a prayer that clouds and rain visit the village soon. As a racer overtakes the water fetcher he is handed the mongwikoro and chochokpi which he then carries until overtaken by another runner. Thus the race proceeds. The runners are humbling themselves before the katsinam by sacrificial action or hard work yet they are also participat- ing in the cosmic rhythms by unifying their breath with the katsinam through a microcosmic rehearsal of that which they desire. In the Snake-Antelope rites the Hopi pray for quick crop growth and rain. Rain helps not only the crops but the animals as well. Indeed, one Hopi says that running symbolizes the animals who are said to run around after a rain: The meaning of it is to hurry the watermel- on and the corn to ripen, also to hurry the clouds to bring rain. When it rains and there is lots of water, the animals will be happy and run around. That is what the running means (Parsons [ed.] 1925: 107). Another form of Hopi ritual racing has runners following a prescribed course leading to the village while kicking a ball made of pitch and some hair from a swift horse and/or rabbit and a few hairs from the big toe of a fast Hopi runner (Voth 1901: 154 n. 2). The kickballs are symbolic of the clay nodules formed by rushing water after a heavy rain and represent the desire of the Hopl. Hopi kickball racers hope to evoke the pity of the Cloud People by sacrific- ing themselves through strenuous physical acti- vity. The racers are encouraged to run hard so that the sacred may perceive their earnestness and humility. At the supplicatory level a Hopi explained kickball racing this way: All devout men ... pray that the Cloud deities will look upon the runners kicking the nodule before them and will send the rain in quantity to fill the water courses brimming full and rushing as swift as these runners, and the water like them strong and swift, running and kicking the muinkuyuna before it, the nodules of clay large and small which are formed in the water courses during rain freshets (Stephen 1936: 279). The above seems to imply a distance be- tween the Hopi and their gods who are said to look down hopefully upon the runners and grant their request. Kicking the nodule indi- cates the desired event in the above quote, but it seems that the Hopi in that case are wishing for rain to fill the washes. At the same time I think kickball races have a participatory structure as well. The katsinam are thought by the Hopi to run races in rain storms, flooding the arroyos and rolling along nodules of mud which serve as their kickballs. In supplicating the katsinam the Hopi ask that the katsinam race as they do. At another level, the Hopi unify their hearts with the katsinam in order to will rain to the crops. There they embody their breath bodies within a microcos- mic representation of their desired cosmic rhythm and participate in the realization of their prayer. Thus, as Parsons notes, "to make the kachina race and bring rain, men race" (Parsons [ed.] 1925: 61 n. 99). At both levels, which occur simultaneously, the prayers of the fastest runner are perceived as the most power- ful (Stephen 1936: 272). On the one hand, he exerts the most physical effort and thus evokes the most pity from the katsinam. He also is the first to arrive at the village and thus on the Anthropos 81.1986</page><page sequence="20">196 John D. Loftin participatory level he calls forth the clouds more quickly than the others. Beginning with the first day of the summer Rute rites which are held alternately each August with the Snake-Antelope rites, the Sand clan chief, whose phratry is said to "own" racing (Titiev 1939: 35), races around the vil- lage as a prayer that the clouds come quickly with rain. A Hopi told Stephen that the Sand clan chief runs ever-decreasing circuits around the mesa to draw the Cloud People closer and closer "until on the concluding day of the ceremony they shall have come overhead and poured down the heavy rain upon ourselves, our houses, and all the surrounding lands, and we may see the arroyo full of running water and listen to its sweet sound" (Stephen 1936: 780). To evoke the pity of the katsinam through physical sacrifice, the Sand clan chief runs in the hot summer sand and sun barefooted and without covering on his limbs and body. Thus he petitions the sacred to send forth rain to help the crops and cool his body. Yet he also participates in the rhythms of the Cloud People. He allows his hair to hang over his shoulders in ^microcosmic imitation of the Cloud people, "for thus the Cloud chiefs carry the rain clouds" (Stephen 1936:780). His ever-decreasing cir- cuits around the village paradoxically symbolize both his supplication of and participation in the sacred. Perhaps the participatory structure of Hopi racing customs is best revealed by and through the katsina races. The Hopi impersonate katsi- nam for roughly half the year and feel that they become the perfect spiritual beings they sym- bolize.40 During the spring and summer months of the katsina season, various Runner (Wawar- katsinam) chase Hopi runners and whip them with yucca blades, the purpose of which is to have rain water "rush down the arroyos."41 One Hopi says, "these kachina races are for the clouds to come soon, the kachinas are clouds; if the kachinas whip many boys they have to pay lots of rain back" (Parsons [ed.]1925: 94). The katsinam are themselves clouds so that their very presence calls forth rain, but there also seems to be included a sense of reciprocity, at least according to my informant. I should note, however, that the above quote indicates that the katsina must give rain in return for whip- ping a racer and thus forthcoming rain seems to be certain. If the katsinam cannot catch a runner then they throw mud at them, "if he hits it means there will be a heavy rain, mud making" (1925: 93 n. 143). A sense of reciproci- ty may or may not be present in the preceding example, but certainly a participatory structure is evident. A katsina throwing mud symbolizes the coming of rain for katsinam are the rain. Because katsinam are "refractions" of the "very something," they participate directly in the cosmic rhythms of the Hopi world. They partici- pate in those rhythms because they are sources of those rhythms. It is interesting to read several katsina songs in order to see the partici- patory structure therein. For example, Mark Lomayestewa wrote a Long Hair katsina song which begins, "From all directions to here rains will come throughout your corn fields; ponds will shine."42 Note that as katsinam the Hopi do not supplicate the sacred for they are unified with the sacred. They say simply that they will come and visit the Hopi with their blessing of rain. The Hopi may also pray directly for their crops while working in the field. The Hopi say that they should work hard and sing in the fields with a happy heart.43 At the supplicatory level hard work and a humble heart is thought to merit the pity of the Clouds who will then drop rain on the crops. At the participatory level, the 40 O'Kane 1950: 240; also 1953: 170; - Joseph and Thompson 1944: 41. 41 For descriptions of the various "Runner" katsi- nam, see Wright 1977:72. Recently, E. Malotki (1983: 19-37) has critiqued Wright's classification of Hopi katsinam and has proposed categories which he claims are the Hopi's own. 42 Lomayestewa and Lomakema 1978: 3. - This short work contains several songs sung by various katsinam including Long Hair, Corn-Lads, Hewto, Hunter, Mon- kum, He'hey'a, and Honan Katsinam. 43 The theory that working hard with a happy heart will facilitate crop growth is widespread among the Hopl. For some Hopi accounts of the above, see Qoyawayma 1964:129; Navatniwa...; Talayesva 1942:224; Abbot Sekaquaptewa 1982: September 16, p.2; November 24, p.2. Anthropos 81.1986</page><page sequence="21">Supplication and Participation 197 Hopi feel that their breath has a real influence on the crops with which they work (Carroll [ed.] 1956: 149-150). In one sense simply work- ing around and breathing upon crops is a prayer for the breath of the Hopi inhabits and influences the material forms and rhythms of their world. Bad thoughts can poison the crops, while good thoughts will help crops to grow and ripen beautifully (1956: 150).44 Each Hopi embodies the spark of creation and can direct that spark in either life-promoting or life- negating directions, for the sacred both creates and takes away life. In both cases, though, the Hopi may participate in the rhythms of the world. Both possibilities have existed since the Beginning, when the Hopi first emerged to this world. Hopi creation myths hold that a witch (powaka) or Two Heart emerged with the Hopi in the Beginning and also laid down an ances- tral path which could be followed. Those Hopi who do not unite their hearts with the others can participate in the world's rhythms in a negative, life-denying mode.45 After the first Two Heart emerged from the sipaapuni he brought death to the Hopl. Death upset the Hopi, who then decided to send thè witch back down the sipaapuni from which he came. How- ever, the witch told the father of the deceased child to look down into the underworld and there the father saw his child alive and playing a game. The witch said death is not final and is indeed necessary to transform humans into purely spiritual beings, from which comes more life. Thus, the Hopi decided to let the witch remain for they felt his evil was a necessary component in the maintenance of the world. In other words, though the Hopi seek rain, fertili- ty, long life, and good health in this life, they recognize also that life springs from death and thus they accept ultimately the presence of death in the world. Bradfield has keenly observed that the Hopi ceremonial calendar acts out in advance each stage of the cosmic agricultural cycle (1973/11: 185). While it would take me too far to examine the ritual calendar in detail, let me note that each ceremony enacts each stage of the agricultural cycle on a microcosmic level in advance of the desired event, i.e., rain, warm- ing of soil, planting, sprouting, growth, harvest. Each ritual requires proper material actions and objects as well as proper thoughts. According to Kennard (1972: 469), the Hopi word for ritually foreshadowing cosmic events is pasiwna (Third Mesa dialect, pasiuni). I am not sure of the relationship of pasiwna to natwanta and naa~ wakna at this time. It may be that the term has ceremonially secretive dimensions that preclude any discussion of it with the uninitiated. I have gathered from one informant that it perhaps refers in some way to the joint acts of natwanta and naawakna; that is, the forecasting of cosmic rhythms by physical and spiritual efforts (Emo- ry Sekaquaptewa, personel communication; Third Mesa, 1983). At any rate, Kennard inter- prets pasiwna as "magically predetermining" events, a position I find untenable. If pasiwna embodies a spiritual dimension and I have been told it does, then I must rule out an interpreta- tion of it as magical. Nowhere in Hopi religion have I found any ritual that embodies "faith ... in the order and uniformity of nature" (Frazer 1922: 56). In actuality, the Hopi address their world with prayers precisely because they do not take for granted cosmic events such as the movements of the sun, rain, crop growth, ferti- lity, and long life. I have attempted here to critique Frazer's theory of sympathetic magic in light of the Hopi theory of prayer. It seems to me that the Hopi "compel" events to take place only by trans- cending their human status through uniting their breath bodies with the "very something" as taught by the hisatsinom. When the Hopi put duck feathers on a water paaho because "ducks swim in ponds of water through the land after rain" (Stephen 1936: 782), or when they feed a 44 O'Kane (1953: 166-167) also notes the power the Hopi feel their thoughts have over all aspects of the world. However, I do not agree with O'Kane in understanding the ability of Hopi hearts to influence the cosmos in a cause-effect modality. The material and spiritual dimen- sions of the Hopi world constitute an irreducible totality. Therefore, one dimension does not cause another. 43 For discussions of Hopi witchcraft, see Courlander 1982: 5-7; Talayesva 1942: 43, 119-121, 208-210; 255-256, 257, 307-308, 418-419, 425, 426, 428-430; Voth 1905: 13-15, 20; Wallis 1936:11; Wallis and Titiev 1944: 535-540; Titiev 1942: 549-557.

Frazer's The Golden Bough. Frazers's theory of sympathetic magic has been utilized by a number of scholars of Hopi prayer, including J. Walter Fewkes, Elsie Clews Parsons, Mischa Titiev, and, more recently, JR. Maitland Bradfíeld. This work criticizes the theory that Hopi prayer rites include magical dimensions while demonstrating that Hopi prayer involves structures of supplication and participation. These paradoxical acts embody the Hopi understanding of the sacred as both related yet distant, immanent yet transcendent Each mode of Hopi prayer includes a participatory structure in which the Hopi attempt to align their breath bodies with the Giver of the Breath of Life in order to will a life giving cosmic event to occur as well as a structure of supplication whereby the Hopi wish the sacred to fulfíll some need. Numerous examples of Hopi prayer acts are discussed in order to demonstrate concretely the comprehensive char- acter of the structures of participation and supplication. Discussed in detail are ritual smoking, breath feathers, prayer sticks, sacred cornmeal, salavi, and ceremonial foot races. None of these modes of prayer embody the attempt magically to control the environment [North American Indians, Hopi, Prayer rites, World view, Magic] 46 As Yava, an initiated Hopi-Tewa, said, "We seek a way of communicating with the source of life, so we have prayers and kachinas" (Yava 1978: 134).
