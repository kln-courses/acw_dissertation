<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rolf Hellebust Metal in the Works of Vasilii Aksenov Why has the search for a Soviet cultural mythology become so attractive to scholars East and West? The reasons are complex, and some have more to do with academic politics than with real advances in understanding. Nevertheless, much of Soviet reality - as constructed by both leadership and people - is better interpreted in terms of a shared cultural landscape of myths and symbols, than it is in terms of ideological systems. While Marxist ideology is unmatched for the scope of its rationalist worldview, the lacunae in its historical narrative are too conspicuous to be ignored even by ardent supporters. Leaps of faith across causal gaps demand a shift (whether conscious or unconscious) from logical exposition to a more poetic idiom. The prime example of such a gap is the one separating political and cultural revolution. When Marxism attempts to envision the actual course of events by which changes in economic conditions will lead to a change in human nature, it must resort to metaphor. Thus, the creation of the New Soviet Man is described in terms that evoke mythic archetypes: initiation, death and rebirth, apotheosis. The history of one especially prominent narrative of transformation can be traced back for millennia. One finds it in Mexican creation myths, in the initiation rituals of Siberian shamans, in the religious folklore of medieval Europe, in the doctrines of both Occidental and Oriental alchemy, and throughout the symbolic lexicon of modern revolutionary movements.1 This is the myth of spiritual transubstantiation through metallization. Its archetypal motifs are as follows: a given metal, on the basis of its physical characteristics and the peculiarities of its extraction, is identified with the supernatural realm (or even with the flesh and bones of some divine being). Through the mediation of supernatural forces, mortal human bodies can be treated by the methods used in the production of this metal, resulting in their union with the sacred element and their acquisition of its positive characteristics. 1 R.J.

Metal symbolism has thus been associated from primordial times with the universal revolutionary symbols of fire and light. Another factor explaining its attraction for the Russian revolutionaries stems from more recent history, and the split of the communists into "hard" Bolsheviks and "soft" Mensheviks, as manifested in pseudonyms such as those of Kamenev (kamen1 ', "stone"), Molotov (molot, "hammer"), and - of course - Stalin (stal' "steel"). Iron and steel provide the commonest epithets for the political firmness of Lenin's followers.2 The post-revolutionary economic role of these metals is reflected in their enhanced symbolic function, particularly with regard to the sacred triad of labour/warfare/suffering. Stalin's declaration that the Soviet Union "can and must become a country of metal"3 presumes the existence of a nation of iron- jawed cadres ready to execute such a cataclysmic task. While traces of the flesh-to-metal narrative are present on every level of Soviet culture, it is, like any Bolshevik myth, rarely encountered in its explicit form. The great attraction of Marxism is its alleged scientific insight into the history and future of hitherto unanalyzable social phenomena. "All that is reasonable in the human mind... will necessarily become reality," declares Plekhanov.4 This faith in the power of reason demands that Marxist ideology suppress any irrational elements, not excepting its own ruling myth - that of dialectical materialism as the antidote to all myths. Yet Marxism cannot survive without its myths and symbols, and its history is the ongoing record of their suppression and resurgence. The metallization of the body as a metaphor for the creation of the communist New Man has undergone several cycles of automatization and realization in the course of the twentieth century. In the pre-1917 verses of revolutionary agitators such imagery appears often, but remains formulaic, most often involving Aesopian parallels between the political struggle and the creative work of the blacksmith.5 At the 2 Hans Günther, "Zheleznaia garmoniia (Gosudarstvo kak total'noe proizvedenie iskusstva)," Voprosy liter atury 1 (1992): 40. 3 I.V.

Its apogee comes in the machine utopias of radical proletarian poets such as Aleksei Gastev (chiefly remembered today as the satirical target of Zamiatin's novel My (We). Gastev's worker-hero gives us an explicit first-person description of his own apotheosis, as he fuses with the factory collective into the mass-man: Into my veins flows new iron blood. I have grown still higher. I myself grow steel shoulders and arms immeasurably strong. I have merged with the building's iron. I have risen.7 With the advent of socialist realism in the 1930s, the tide turns against the use of overtly figurative language. In works such as Ostrovskii's Kak zakalialas' stai' (How the Steel Was Tempered), the forging of the new man again becomes a mere abstraction, its broader implications - both positive and negative - hidden below the surface. At the same time, fellow-travelers such as Babel1, Olesha and Pil'niak demonstrate their awareness of this deeper meaning. The imagery of iron and steel is especially prevalent in Platonov: for example, in the morbid "Musornyi veter" (Garbage Wind), with its vision of "thousands of people transformed into metal."8 It also receives complex treatment at the hands of less mechanically oriented writers such as Pasternak: for example, in the metal cheekbone of the shrapnel- wounded soldier in Doktor Zhivago (Doctor Zhivago), a grotesque realization of the metaphor of the steeling of the revolutionary body Q in the forge of combat. But to observe the freest play with the dehumanizing clichés of classical Soviet literature, we have to turn to the last decades of the USSR, to non-official 6 Andrei Belyi, Peterburg (Moscow: Nauka, 1981) 307. 7 A.K.

Given Aksenov's biography - the time spent with his mother in Magadan exile, the celebrated struggles with the literary and political establishment, the forced emigration, and, above all, the provocative, pro- Western stance that pervades his writing - it is easy to forget that he and his peers such as Andrei Bitov still represent a generation that, in its own idiosyncratic way, dreamt of realizing the high ideals of Marxism-Leninism. The prominence of metal imagery in Aksenov has been noted by several scholars. Per Dalgârd points to an antithesis of iron machinery and "bionature,"10 while Konstantin Kustanovich links Aksenov's use of metal with the "century-long tradition in Russian literature (from Boratynsky through Nekrasov and Tolstoy to Blok) of using the image of iron to represent pragmatism, inhumanity, and a lack of spirituality."11 These readings reflect a negative symbolic usage dating back to biblical times, reinforced (especially in Dalgârd' s case) by a typically late twentieth-century mistrust of technology. While the traditional symbolism is not neglected in Aksenov's writings, his references to iron and steel (and silver, gold, lead, bronze and aluminium - to list the metals he treats in their order of importance) are much more ambiguous than suggested here, and can rarely be understood in the broad existential terms offered by Dalgârd and Kustanovich. Furthermore, the cultural context within which they must by analyzed is not Russian in any identifiable way, but emphatically Soviet. (Among other things, this casts doubt on assessments of this author based on the axiological opposition of nature/technology.) Aksenov continually quotes - with varying degrees of irony - from the classical repertoire of metal epithets for the positive hero of socialist realism. On the deeper level, his works offer a sustained meditation on the symbolic equation of metallization and revolutionary transformation that lies at the heart of the Soviet myth. Those characters Aksenov depicts in terms of iron and steel represent canonical Soviet types: workers, soldiers, sailors, pilots, cosmonauts, police officers and high government officials. For the most part, the bias of such portrayals depends less on the author's abstract political views, than on genuine popular attitudes (those of his protagonists) toward a given category of hero - from cosmonauts and war heroes on the one end, to internal security agents on 10 Per Dalgârd, The Function of the Grotesque in Vasilij Aksenov (Aarhus: Arkona, 1982) 133.

The latter are unfailingly tagged with negative metal epithets, as exemplified in the KGB-rich novel Skazhi izium! (Say Cheese!). Aksenov eschews the clichéd physical and psychological referents of socialist realism (jaw, arms, grip, will, constitution, etc.) for the unambiguously grotesque characterization of a KGB general as "not a man, but a steel gut." Meeting one of the novel's dissident protagonists, the menacing General Planshchin becomes "full of cast iron" (5:60). In another such encounter it is his victim who is subject to unwilling metallization, "feeling lead pour impetuously throughout his body and, inside, his unprepared organs collapsing under the lead's weight" (5:275). Both versions of the flesh-to-metal transformation are clearly negative, as is the grotesque nickname used in this book for the security forces: Zhelezy ("the Glands" - a play on "Internal Organs" [5:17]), echoing the Russian word zhelezo ("iron"). Only when a representative of these forces turns out to be unexpectedly sympathetic, as is the case in the novella Poiski zhanra (In Search of a Genre, 1978), does Aksenov have his protagonist observe that the officer "wasn't as iron as he appeared at first glance" (2:75). A more neutral tone marks Aksenov' s use of metal imagery to refer to the Soviet state and its ideals in the abstract. (That such imagery always has a specifically Soviet component is confirmed by its absence in the relatively few works of Aksenov set outside the USSR, such as "Pravo na ostrov" ("Quest for an Island," 1977). The very idea of returning to the USSR after a putative defection leaves one of the heroes of Say Cheese! with an ambiguous metallic taste in his mouth (5:246). The novel offers frequent descriptions of symbols of Soviet power - from the forty-pound aluminium letters of a communist slogan (5:295) to numerous metal monuments, including the "female metallic personage" of Mukhina's famous Rabochii i kolkhoznitsa (Worker and Collective Farm Woman), and a statue (in honour of Soviet animal husbandry) of a cast-iron bull with a "scrotum seemingly full of cannonballs." This monstrous piece of sculpture, located at the Exhibition of Economic Achievements, is seen against the background of "the guilded statues of the peoples of the USSR" (5:284) - combining an image of threatening, inhuman 12 V.P. Aksenov, Sobranie sochinenii, vol. 5 (Moscow: Iunost', 1995) 114. (Further references, unless otherwise noted, will be to this edition and will be given in the text.) Even in the one novel that Aksenov might be assumed to have written i n a socialist-realist manner - the little-read Liubov' k elektrichestvu (Love for Electricity, 1971) - refuses to take an unambiguous, orthodox approach: on one page, an enemy to the Soviet cause is described negatively as having a monocle "flashing with metallic light," behind which no eye is visible. On the very next page Aksenov portrays his nemesis, a revolutionary hero, as "steel-eyed." {Liubov' k elektrichestvu [Moscow: Politicheskaia literatura, 1971] 363-364.</page><page sequence="6">96 RolfHellebust vitality with that of the Utopian metallization of an entire nation. As for General Planshchin, during his work at the Lubianka he finds it necessary to pause and seek inspiration by gazing out his office window at the "bronze figure" he has dedicated his life to defend: that is, the statue of the "Iron" Commissar Dzerzhinskii, metallized in death as he was in life (5:242). But it is not only in the eyes of the secret police that metal can become an object of quasi-religious devotion. Considering Aksenov's treatment of old Stalinists and KGB officers, one might be surprised by the attitudes evinced by sympathetic representatives of the author's own generation, both in Say Cheese! and in other works. One of Aksenov's most heartfelt portraits is that of Viktor Denisov, a young character in the novella that first won him worldwide attention: Zvezdnyi bilet (A Starry Ticket, 1961). Viktor, like so many of Aksenov's heroes, is a scientist with a poet's soul. He embodies the physicist/lyricist opposition that became a term of reference in the debates of the 60s generation about the relation of their own life's ambitions to the aspirations of the Soviet state.13 Viktor is a rebel: his research threatens established ideas and the careers of his superiors. Yet, as he admits in the first words of the story: "I am a loyal person" (1:183). Viktor cannot help but link his dreams with the romanticism of Soviet scientific achievements. Gazing into the night sky toward an orbiting sputnik, he identifies himself with this piece of earthly metal, hot ingot of earthly hopes, product of brain and muscle, mixed with our sweat and with the blood of those who are no longer around to hear it. A piece of earthly metal, full of love, full of heroism and happiness and suffering. It's all ours, flesh of our flesh... (1:202). Here the flesh-to-metal myth is both updated and personalized. Brimming with teenage emotional exuberance, it reflects an age in which the acronym NTR (nauchno-tekhnologicheskaia revoliutsiia, "scientific-technological revolution") was to become an article of secular faith. At the same time, Viktor's paean harks back to a classic Soviet version of the myth - to the fusion of molten metal in the blast furnace as a symbol of the merging of individuals into the socialist collective. This transformation is always one of "heroism and happiness and suffering." The element of martyrdom recalls the legendary smiths of primitive culture, who resorted to human sacrifice as a catalyst for the elusive 13 Western readers will be struck by the remarkable absence in Aksenov's world of anything resembling C.P. Snow's two cultures. Aksenov's artists are at home in scientific circles, and his scientist heroes are "recognized by everyone belonging to the intelligentsia." ("Randevu," 2:207).</page><page sequence="7">Metal in the Works of Vasilii Aksenov 97 metallurgical process.14 The phrase "flesh of our flesh," from the Biblical inception of woman from Adam's rib, is a further reference to mystical transformation through sacrifice.15 A Starry Ticket also bears witness to what one might think a more likely stance of Khrushchev-era adolescents toward official state symbolism. For example, there is the poet Alik, compelled to earn his bread by producing ditties along the lines of With the bronze of muscles, Let the Day resound! Can they ever be tarnished These days of ours? (1:227) "Muscles-tarnished (muskuly-tusklymi)' An iron-clad rhyme," he comments to himself cynically. Yet despite this attitude, even the most defiant of Aksenov's young heroes come to find something alluring in the naïve, monumental idealism underlying the image of the steel-bodied Bolshevik. Viktor's kid brother Dimka is a slave to Western fashion. He considers his older brother a Soviet square, too studious by half. But Dimka eventually grows out of it, and ends up proud of his backbreaking job on a Baltic fishing trawler, working for a captain whom he had initially described in a mock socialist realist manner as "an iron man with steel jaws and ferro-concrete logic" (1:297). As for Viktor, he becomes a martyr to his unrealizable dreams. His eventual death in an air crash, as well as his identification with the sputnik, make him a spiritual heir to the great physicist/lyricist heroes of the classical age, the Soviet aviators. Throughout Aksenov's work, cosmonauts and airmen function simultaneously as official exemplars and genuine popular idols.16 Both types of hero are characterized by the use of metal imagery: for example, the gold-toothed, silvery-suited cosmonaut of Say Cheese!, whose "steel phallus" is his spacecraft's docking section, and whose recreational reading during a sojourn on Venus (planet of love, but with the atmosphere of a blast furnace) is How the Steel was Tempered (5:343, 356). Both are frequently represented in state 14 Joseph Needham, "The Evolution of Iron and Steel Techology in East and Southeast Asia," in T.A. Wertime and J.D.

Yet Aksenov undermines the routine sardonicism of his dissident hero. He puts these thoughts into Andrei's head at the moment he is eagerly awaiting a glimpse of the rocket that will take him on his own cosmic adventure - one that will involve a symbolic death and at a least hint of crucifixion for himself (in the form of a crewmember's homosexual advances [5:347, 357]). Aksenov's characters use the Soviet ideal of flight for their own purposes. One dreams of becoming a superman and going into orbit to escape atomic war (1:505). Another envies a TU-154 for its ability to achieve complete isolation from the masses (a common-sense but unorthodox observation [2:76]). Then there is the character in Aksenov's first novel who makes the following declaration - but only because he would rather avoid the real-life demands of the Party on his future medical career: If they say "Climb into this rocket, we'll shoot you into space, and we guarantee your remains will be scattered in the name of science," I'd say "Hooray." But when they tell me it's my patriotic duty to turn into an Ionych... (1:10). The title of this novel - Kollegi (Colleagues, 1960) - would fit almost any of Aksenov's books. His heroes always come in tightly-knit peer groups (classmates, co-workers, co-vacationers). Their aim in life is not sex or love, despite Aksenov's predilections in this area. Neither does it have much to do with aesthetics, despite the avant-garde pretensions and artistic self-consciousness of works like Zatovarennaia bochkotara (Surplussed Barrelware, 1968) or Zolotaia nasha zhelezka (Our Golden Ironburg, 1980). 18 Both of these prominent features in Aksenov's œuvre are primarily functions of private life, and it is only in social terms that his protagonists define themselves - in terms of their 17 Katerina Clark, The Soviet Novel: History as Ritual, 2nd ed. (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1985) 139. 18 One could argue that both Aksenov's taboo-defying eroticism and his occasional efforts at displaying an avant-garde aesthetic sensibility have been first and foremost tools to legitimize his own career as the voice of his generation and as a serious Russia writer - with all the historical demands of that heavy calling.</page><page sequence="9">Metal in the Works of Vasilii Aksenov 99 contribution to their generation, in terms of their vocation in the broadest sense.19 Thus, adolescent dreams of flight as escape and self-affirmation are never totally divorced from thoughts of social responsibility. Both the heroic individual metamorphosis and the consciousness of a social mission are represented in the flesh-to-metal transformation - and never more clearly (albeit in a perverted sense) than in the case of the steel bird. The prime example of this recurring type in Aksenov' s work is, of course, the protagonist of the groundbreaking 1965 story of the same name. Popenkov, the hero of this fantastic satire, is depicted in distastefully physiological terms. Yet this foul-smelling, scabby-buttocked petty con-artist appears to his fellow citizens as a romantic dreamer. In the course of his metallization, he is gradually transformed in their eyes from the piteous object of their charitable impulses to the ultimate benefactor of humanity (2:253, 276). At the beginning of "Stal'naia ptitsa" ("The Steel Bird") Popenkov' s metallic nature appears only through clichéd comparisons. ("His hands were like steel" [2:263].) Then, gradually, the metaphor is realized in textbook fashion.20 We see this unambiguously in a series of medical reports describing Popenkov' s physical condition. Added to his initial appearance as a caricatured Zoshchenko-type low- life21 are an incongruous mix of the features of a heroic Soviet pilot, a Stalinesque dictator, some bird of the same unspecified genus as that of Kafka's bug, and a steel-skinned jet fighter aircraft. With this obviously allegorical figure, Aksenov is referring to two things: first and more generally, to the dream of the new Soviet man - a "completely new species," as the medical reports attest (2:272). Second, the realized metaphor itself comes from a heroic epithet which was applied equally to the planes of the Soviet air force (alternately called stal'nye ptitsy ["steel birds"] and stalinskie ptitsy ["Stalin's birds"], recalling the etymology of that name) and to the pilots themselves. This image can be found in the well-known patriotic songs of the 1930s, one of which is quoted as the story's epigraph: There, where infantry can't pass Nor armoured train race through Nor heavy tank crawl through The steel bird will fly (2:237). 19 The narrower sense of vocation is often lacking, as Aksenov tends to make his heroes dilettantes, who refuse to channel their creative energy into any one profession (Kustanovich, The Artist and the Tyrant 137). 20 Dalgârd 28. n Compare the narrator's description of the "Zoshchenko type" in Ozhog (3:313).</page><page sequence="10">100 RolfHellebust Another, the famous "Vse vyshe" ("Ever Higher"), also appears in the text: We were born to make fantasy fact To overcome distance and space, Reason gave us steel arms - our wings, And instead of a heart, a fiery engine.22 The dialectical synthesis of man and machine into a new, superhuman creature - this is precisely what is described in both the song and in Aksenov's ironic elaboration of it. In Aksenov's almost too happy ending, the steel bird is chased away; but he returns in various avatars in other plays, stories and novels. Throughout Aksenov's work, metal signifies the power of dictatorship and violence. However, the author never loses sight of the human origins of this power. The Soviet embodiment of the flesh-to-metal myth, as a (perhaps unwitting) perversion of high social ideals, retains a deep moral ambiguity, and cannot be reduced to a case of humanity's alienation through modern technology, or of nature versus metal as "the embodiment of sheer inhuman force," as Kustanovich has it.25 Technology is a fetish for Aksenov - from the quintessential^ Soviet space project of Say Cheese! and the research institute of Our Golden Ironburg, to the toys-for-boys (fancy watches, guns, motorcycles, sports cars, etc.) he bestows upon his heroes.26 Although his generation's identification of technological progress (inevitably and paradoxically accompanied by a naive Hemingwayesque primitivism) with the spirit of the 1960s is at time shaken (especially in Our Golden Ironburg), it is never overcome. The enthusiasms of Aksenov's characters, while serving in their eyes to differentiate their generation from that of their parents, in no way alienates them from Soviet ideals. Furthermore, there is nothing dehumanizing about their relationship toward machines, as is made clear by the use of positive metal imagery in this regard. One of Aksenov's pet words is the translation-resistant diminutive zhelezka (from zhelezo, "iron"), employed most prominently in the 22 (2:272). One feels the ironic reverberations of this verse elsewhere in Aksenov: for example, in Ozhog (3:169, 390), as well as in "Zatovarennaia bochkotara" (2:158), which deftly realizes the unsettling metaphor of the "fiery engine." Lò A similar synthesis is suggested in bkazhi izium! or an aluminium statue or Lenin - an "idol" that resembles "a plane set on its rear end" (5:382). 24 D.

It also figures in Aksenov' s frequent automotive descriptions (for example, In Search of a Genre [2:14, 46, 90]). Cars are almost alive (2:21). Sentimental thoughts about his junkyard-bound Volvo lead Andrej Drevesnyi in Say Cheese! to ask "But what sense is there in the destruction of metal? Maybe there's more so-called 'injustice' in the aging of mechanisms, than in the breakdown of the flesh?'" (5:177). At the same time, such thoughts do not bias Aksenov's protagonists against living nature, or even prevent them from espousing a fashionable environmentalism.27 And some of Aksenov's central positive images come from the natural world. The steel bird is - despite everything - a bird. Almost everything Aksenov has written contains some reference to the bird as a symbol of his heroes' lofty dreams. Even Popenkov's avian type has positive potential: in Ozhog (The Burn, 1980) a stroke of inspiration lets a scientist finish off a brilliant formula, dubbed a "steel bird now tamed" (3:21). Of the specific metals named in Aksenov's works, iron and steel are both the most widespread and the most semantically neutral. Among the others, aluminium recalls the innocent revolutionary ardour of futurism (with hints of the nineteenth-century metal utopia of Chernyshevskii's Chto delat'? (What is to be Done?) (5:223). Gold and silver are mainly positive; the latter is also connected with Russia's poetic Silver Age, a constant point of comparison for members of the 60s generation with what Evtushenko has called the "Steel Age" 9Q of the Soviet era. But Aksenov undermines the dream of a cultural renaissance: the quintuplet heroes of The Burn have five "silver" friends (Serebrianikov, Argentov, Silvestr, Zilberanskii, Serebro).30 All act as sounding boards if not muses to Aksenov's creative protagonists; and all betray him at the last moment. Compare the bizarrely named Smelldishchev in "Randevu" ("The 27 V.P. Aksenov, Zolotaia nasha zhelzka (Ann Arbor: Ardis, 1980) 19. 28 In this meaning, Aksenov's birds have been related to Chekhov's seagull: see Konstantin Kustanovich, "Notes on Aksenov's Drama," in E. Mozejko, ed., Vasiliy Pavlovich Aksënov: A Writer in Quest of Himself (Columbus, OH: Slavica, 1986) 92. Mozejko has traced the negative application of this image in the case of the steel bird to Russian folklore and colloquial speech: see Edward Mozejko, 'The Steel Bird and Aksenov's Prose of the Seventies," Mozejko 213. As for the metallic aspect, one might look for predecessors in Khlebnikov's Zhuravl' (Crane), or to the negative metaphorical depiction of technology in pre-revolutionary workers' lyrics: see B. Alekseeva, Ustnaia poeziia russkikh rabochikh (Leningrad: Nauka, 1971) 104. 29 Evgeny Evtushenko, Introduction, to Albert C.

The darker metals - lead, cast iron - tend to play a negative role. Aksenov's treatment of cast iron, in particular, reveals the working of a crucial set of oppositions in his writings, both poles of which are represented through metal imagery: flexibility, weakness and nonaggression versus rigidity, strength and aggression. Cast iron epitomizes the latter qualities. Thus, from the gloomy perspective of Aksenov's later books, the once shiny 1960s are filled with rust (3:391), while the 1970s - the years of zastoi (stagnation) - are "cast-iron."31 Stasis is abhorrent to Aksenov's heroes. The fear of the protagonist of "Sviiazhsk" (1981), as he grows older, is that "everything is becoming cemented into place" (4:568). Luchnikov, the benighted politician-hero of Ostrov Krym (The Island of Crimea, 1981), is sure that the "ferroconcrete of communism" is softening (4:240). His misplaced trust in the peaceful intentions of the USSR is revealed by the sight of the "steel cathedral of the Soviets" - an aircraft carrier - come to lead the invasion of his island paradise (4:357). Aksenov's great criticism of the Soviet Union is for its intransigent enmity to any manifestation of youthful energy. With uncharacteristic bluntness, he charges in Say Cheese! that the Revolution was born "middle-aged" and that Lenin's tomb, like a pyramid, "stinks of decay." The metal bronze plays a role similar to that of cast iron in its connotation of the rigidity of once-dynamic ideals, especially in Aksenov's references to statues. In "Gibel1 Pompei" ("The Destruction of Pompeii," 1980) a writer has a nostalgic, almost chummy relationship with a plaster statue of an unnamed dictator. The flaking metallic paint of this "pseudo-bronze gentleman" symbolizes the failure of the metal-to-flesh transformation (5:586, 592-593). Both bronze and cast iron recall the oppressive weight of history (4:34). The ambiguity of the hero of "The Steel Bird" in this regard is seen in the fact that he threatens to melt down Russian history and its monuments into a "bronze porridge" which he will devour - as well as in his cryptic comment that "time erodes even the most solid metal" (2:281, 257). 31 Aksenov, Say Cheese!, trans.

This translation is from an unpublished manuscript; these words are missing in the Russian-language version of the novel. 32 Say Cheese!, Bouis 13, 33. Yet Aksenov's heroes are not immune from similar criticism. Just as the suburbs of Moscow in Say Cheese! are characterized by the paradox of stareiushchaia novostroika ("aging new construction"), so an aging member of the 60s generation in Our Golden Ironburg is condemned as an "old- fashioned innovator" (Aksenov, Zhelezka 23).</page><page sequence="13">Metal in the Works of Vasilii Aksenov 1 03 At times, Aksenov's youthful (and once-youthful) heroes are tempted by the monumental confidence of bronze and the Stalinist solidity of cast iron, with its promise of refuge from the storms of contemporaneity (5:66). Witness Our Golden ¡ronburg, Aksenov's last long look back at the 1960s, decade of "Soviet Don Quixotism."33 This is a work that cannot be understood without reference to key elements of Soviet metal symbolism. As Nina Kolesnikoff has pointed out, the novel subtly parodies a certain subgenre of the socialist realist production novel.34 The Zhelezka complex is an embodiment of the hopes and dreams of a generation, an updated version of Magnitka - Magnitogorsk, the magnetic mountain, Stalin's great Siberian metallurgical project of the 1930s, immortalized in such classics as Kataev's Vremia, vpered! (Time, Forward!). "We're forging something of iron here," sing the builders of Zhelezka.35 These contemporary shockworkers are bewildered when one morning, in the course of their construction work, they find a curious baroque architectural detail, added as if by magic to the sleek modernistic structure of the research institute. This Stalinist anteroom, richly adorned with cast-iron fertility symbols, is immediately rejected by the 60s generation. But the venerable scientist who acts as their mentor reminds them that this style does represent their youth. His assertion is followed by the narrator's own admission that, despite his avant- garde pretensions, he still feels an attraction to socialist realism, and the "steel unfolding" of its "cast-iron plot," as Aksenov puts it in The Burn (3:428). Apart from any political considerations, there is something magical about metal itself. Our Golden Ironburg begins with the crash of an alien spaceship in the Siberian taiga. The crash site draws the builders of Zhelezka with a mysterious magnetism (a satirical reference to the effect claimed for Magnitogorsk on communist enthusiasts). There they find an unearthly metal object (which, to add a bathetic counterweight to this imposing narrative, is said to resemble a can-opener). Their leader throws this scrap of iron back into the swamp. In an unwitting evocation of ancient homoeopathic lore about the growth of metal in the earth, he symbolically plants the seed of the larger zhelezka which is soon to spring up. 7 During the construction, the mysterious swamp energy of the place makes both workers and machines run faster, a result attributed by some to the "iron-rich water." 33 Aksenov, Zhelezka 3. 34 Nina Kolesnikoff, "Our Golden Hardware as Parody," Mozejko 195. 35 Aksenov, Zhelezka 70. 36 Aksenov, Zhelezka 71. 37 Aksenov, Zhelezka 67. 38 Aksenov, Zhelezka 69.</page><page sequence="14">104 RolfHellebust Although the complex is eventually destroyed (by Memozov, another steel bird strangely hostile to metal), the novel closes with a new can-opener falling from the heavens, and - with the deus-ex-machina sobornost' of a typical Aksenov resolution - the solemn pledge to rebuild.39 Throughout the book, it is stressed that Zhelezka is more than simply a research institute. It is both a place of religious sacrifice, and an unaging Cleopatra.40 It is a collective dream, but also an unreachable ideal that each of Aksenov' s heroes builds and serves in his own individual way.41 The ideological vagueness of this ideal keeps us from interrogating it as to its real implications; yet it appears, on the most basic level, to involve the same fusion of individuals into a harmonious collective envisioned by the proletarian Gastev in a very different political context.42 In support of this interpretation, there are recurring parallels in Our Golden lronburg between the pioneers of Zhelezka and the mythological Prometheus - a longtime Marxist icon of revolutionary individual sacrifice for the sake of the collective. Recent Russian scholarship has discussed Aksenov' s ambiguous treatment of Soviet myths in terms of a privileging of form over (political) content. In general, Aksenov is a writer whose favourite symbols are easy to spot, but difficult to interpret - mainly because of his penchant for grotesque appositions that confound our hermeneutic expectations. He has himself encouraged critics in their pursuit of the form-over-content approach.44 However, his downplaying of the political dimension is called into question by the conspicuous efforts he makes in one of his more recent works, Zheltok laitsa (The Yolk of the Egg, 1989) to free himself from the politicized view of reality that, as he tacitly admits, does indeed characterize all his work dealing with the 60s generation. For the creative heroes of novels like The Burn, metal symbolizes a longed-for Promethean dynamism. It is lost youth, an escape from the Oblomovism of 39 Aksenov, Zhelezka 187. 40 Aksenov, Zhelezka 17. An implied erotic relationship between anthropomorph- ized technology and the male protagonist is typical for Aksenov. 4* Aksenov, Zhelezka 128. 42 Aksenov, Zhelezka 13. 43 N.T.

Either way, it is a feature of the symbolic landscape of the Soviet Union shared by both the children of the Thaw and their Stalinist forebears. Clearly, the ambiguities involved in Aksenov's reinterpretation of the myth of revolutionary transformation through metallization have less to do with any desire to empty it of their political meaning, than with the inescapable semantic richness it holds for the author, and for the representatives of the idealistic generation he depicts with such sympathy. 46 Aksenov is a defender, in the Russian tradition, of the social function of art: see Kustanovich, The Artist and the Tyrant 86-87.</page></plain_text>
