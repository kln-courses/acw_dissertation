<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Oxford Handbook of the Reception History of the Bible. Edited by Michael Lieb, Emma Mason, and Jonathan Roberts. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 201 1. ISBN 978-0-19-920454-0. Pp. xv + 725. $150.00. According to the editors of the Oxford Handbook of the Reception History of the Bible , biblical reception history, an enterprise grounded in the philosophical hermeneutics of Hans-Georg Gadamer and the contextual hermeneutics of Ulrich Luz, is to be distinguished by its attention to "the situated nature of all interpretive acts" (1). From the innumerable receptions of portions of the Bible over now millennia, the would-be reception historian collects and frames some subset, seeking to understand both the reception in its historical specificity and his or her own specificity as a historian. It goes without saying that there can be no unitary reception history of the Bible, only partial reception histories- effective histories-</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 289 and thus the overarching achievement of reception history of the Bible will be to "put the question of who owns the Bible centre stage" (6). Diversity, then, is of the essence, and the contributors, though largely of British affiliation (as would be expected), "are of any or no religious position, and write from many countries around the globe"; they were commissioned to produce "a highly diverse set of responses to the Bible" (6). The handbook is divided into two parts. Part I (approximately one-quarter of the hefty tome) offers an "overview of scholarly post-Enlightenment readings of the form and content" of twelve of the biblical books (seven from the Hebrew Bible, five from the New Testament), while part II "offers a series of in-depth case studies of particular key passages or books with due regard for the specificity of their socio-historical context" (7). Although the rationale for the arrangement of parts is clear enough, the essays in part I tend toward the cursory - they are indeed "overviews"- and tend to normalize rather than challenge the historical-critical paradigm- which is fine, of course, except that reception history as defined in the "Introduction" wants to be more plural, "a recognition of the dynamic, living relationship between texts and readers, rather than an attempt to isolate and stabilize textual meanings" (8). Nevertheless, the volume does ultimately achieve its aim of providing a structure in which the dialogue between the traditional and the innovative "can be made visible" (6). There are obvious groupings implicit among some essays across the two parts: the "Romans" chapter by Guy Williams in part I serves as essential background to chapters 40-41, which concern readings of that epistle by Karl Barth, Augustine, and Pelagius. Likewise, the "Genesis" essay in part I supports chapters 26-28 in part II (dealing respectively with gnostic interpretations of Genesis, a nineteenth- century debate on evolution, and present-day Anglican wrestlings with the question of homosexuality). However, given the fact that there are two essays in part II specifically interested in uses of the Exodus (chapters 29-30), one wonders why there is no chapter on Exodus in part I. A footnote in the "Introduction" (7n7) warns that the somewhat artificial separation between parts I and II will be breached at times, but I found myself wanting it to be breached more often. For example, the essay on "Psalms" discusses matters of form and genre but offers only a passing reference to the reception of particular psalms as messianic in early Christianity (40), a notable absence since that particular reception is both early and determining. Although the essays in part I are only designed to survey form and content, when the next essay in part I, John F. A. Sawyer s "Isaiah," offers a three-page section on early Christian reception of Isaiah in Greek translation (56-58), the previous absence becomes more noticeable. Similarly, the "Revelation" essay in part I, though admirable in its efficiency, has little to say about the many identifications of the Beast or the Whore of Babylon or the Woman Clothed with the Sun going forward from the first century, nor does it elaborate on literal versus figurative readings of the millennial reign - all of which seem to me rather important moments in the reception history of that book of the Bible.</page><page sequence="3">290 Christianity and Literature Editor Jonathan Roberts suggests in the "Introduction" one less immediately obvious example of essays from part II that should be read in conjunction due to their thematic interests in race; I would like to add to that example by suggesting that chapters 34 and 43 be read together for their investigations of apocalyptic disconfirmation and that chapters 18, 33, and 35 be read together for insight into how modern Jewish experience determines and has in some cases been determined by biblical reception. Chapter 33, Isabel Wollastons "Post-Holocaust Jewish Interpretations of Job," is for me the single best chapter in part II, with its demonstration of how the range of Jewish responses to the Holocaust interfaces with the range of readings possible for Job. (Part I includes a strong introduction to Job that helps to contextualize this essay.) Also fascinating is Jo Carruthers investigation of the multiple ironies to be found in the juxtaposition of the casting of Hitler as a second Haman by contemporary Jews with Hitlers own baffling acceptance of that role- an acceptance made "acceptable," unfortunately, by a "widely circulating Protestant reading of Esther that saw the slaughter at the end of the book as evidence of Jewish vengefulness per se" (525). Other especially informative treatments in part II include Michael Liebs discussion of the Nation of Islams "Mother Plane," modeled on the so-called chariot of Ezekiel 1; and Richard Harries investigation of tension in the New Testament (or at least in readings thereof) concerning the use offeree, whether by the individual or the state. Additional essays cover uses of and encounters with the Bible by the likes of Dante, Handel, William Blake, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Bob Dylan, and Gandhi. Given my own interests and its place within the volume, I must speak at a bit more length about the final chapter, Valentine Cunninghams "Bible Reading and/ after Theory." Cunningham, the author of Reading after Theory (Blackwell, 2002), skillfully recounts the movement of literary theory into biblical studies from the late 1960s, beginning especially with the work of Roland Barthes and Jacques Derrida, with attention also to the contributions of such critics as Frank Kermode and Robert Alter. Cunningham offers a particularly nuanced and sensitive résumé of Derridas biblical reading, yet there is a tone of disdain for certain more recent trends/ methods, particularly the work of Stephen D. Moore, that I find a bit perplexing, since- regardless of ones opinion as to the legitimacy of post- structuralist hermeneutical practice- such practice now undoubtedly occupies a position within the reception history of the Bible. To say that Moore "just gets truly ludicrous (as well as, presumably, blasphemous)" in assembling autobiographical, Foucauldian, and/or Queer readings of the Crucifixion and of anthropomorphic representation of the divinity (663-64) is to make an accusation that, whatever its validity, seems more polemical and judgmental than befits a handbook on the reception history of the Bible, especially when in the "Introduction" Roberts proposes that "the more history of reception of the Bible one reads, the clearer it becomes that the human importance of the Bible does not lie in a single foundational meaning that, by dint of scholarly effort, may finally be revealed." Rather, "there can be no meaning</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews 291 except through the conjunction of readers and texts, and at no point can a clear line be drawn to divide where texts end and readers begin" (8)- which is precisely one of the points that Moores highly theoretical, intensely personal, and deliberately provocative criticism seeks to make. (That Moore tends toward the ludic is manifest; whether or not he is ludicrous depends upon ones assumptions as to legitimate hermeneutical practice. He is certainly relentless in pursuing such audacious analogies as, for example, God as bodybuilder in Gods Gym [Routledge, 1996]- an analogy which, however fanciful and anachronistic, may well raise troubling questions about a sacrificial economy.) Whereas Cunningham allows that cross- fertilization between English and Bible departments has "freshened up our sense of the Bible and of its reception no end," he simultaneously bemoans "the critical daftnesses, follies, and crimes, the sentimental political correctnesses, the neurotic and wishful sightings of oneself in the textual mirror, the canting repetitions about contentless, dehistoricized, utterly abysmal linguistics and textuality [. . .] which have all flourished down the literary corridor" (661-63). Theory has its place, it would seem, but must also know its place, as Cunningham evidently does. (For more on Cunningham, and on Gadamer as well, see Jens Zimmerman's article in Christianity and Literature 53.4, which thoughtfully proposes a post-postmodern incarnational theology.) In sum, this is a useful, enlightening collection, though it seems extremely unlikely that any individual will find the range of readings in part II equally useful; moreover, the essays in part I will each require supplementation by a modern commentary (and they are very good about suggesting further reading). The volume is indexed both by subject and scriptural citation. Anyone interested in this collection should compare it with the Blackwell Companion to the Bible and Culture (2006), edited by Sawyer, which employs a four-part schema encompassing a survey of matters biblical in historical periods (ancient through modern); in religious and geographical contexts (e.g., Asia, North America); in the arts (e.g., film, music, literature); and in recent, more theoretical contexts (e.g., ecological, postcolonial). Indeed, these two volumes share four contributors between them, and the majority of the editors of the Oxford Handbook are also the editors of a third and somewhat similar (though more specific) text, The Blackwell Companion to the Bible in English Literature (2009; reviewed in Christianity and Literature 60.3). With the ongoing appearance of such volumes, the Book of Books proves itself still to be exactly that: the indispensible source, the Book that generates book after book, the Book that calls for response after response, the Book whose reception histories may come to require their own reception history. Indeed, if reception history as an enterprise were ever fully to succeed, then, to borrow the hyperbole of John 21.25, the world itself might not contain the books. Kevin R. West Stephen F.
