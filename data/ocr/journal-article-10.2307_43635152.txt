<plain_text><page sequence="1">BICS 28 (1981) 163 MYCENAEAN SEMINAR 1980-81 On 28 May 1980 Dr Peter G. van Soesbergen read a paper entitled The historical significance of onomastic data from Linear A and B texts to the Mycenaean Seminar of Institute of Classical Studies. The full text of this paper (1 6 pp. text + 1 map + 1 65 notes) may be obtained from the Institute. A brief abstract is given below. Abundant evidence of Human onomastica and lexical terms in Linear A of which some survived in Linear B, indicates that Hurrians most likely played a significant part in the Minoan civilization of Crete. The agglutinating character of Linear A as well as the phonological incompatibilities which Linear B inherited from Linear A, can be explained from the morphology and phonology of the Human language, respectively. In addition, non-Greek suffixes and roots in Mycenaean and post -Mycenaean onomastica show a strong relation with names from the area of Macedonia and Thrace north of Greece proper, as well as with Anatolian names. Summaries of three of the papers read to the Mycenaean Seminar in the session 1980-81 are given below.</page><page sequence="2">164 BICS 28 (1981) 15 October 1980 PROFESSOR GERALD CADOGAN The rise of the Minoan palaces I try to examine how the palaces of Minoan Crete came to be: a difficult task as there is little evidence for EB or, in many ways, Old Palace (OP) Crete, and much of what there is comes from communal tombs which are not easy to date. EM I is especially sketchy - a long phase, in the later part of which the growth of population that is seen often as a feature of EM II may already have begun. With EM II there was a considerable increase in wealth, and improvements in technology, with grander buildings in settlements (Knossos, Vasiliki) and some picture of regional peculiarities (in, for instance, the grouping of circular communal tombs mainly in South Central Crete and of house-like rectangular communal tombs in East Crete). The "international spirit" of EB II was not strong in Crete. The phase ended with some disruption and dislocation; but there is plenty of evidence of continuity of culture and quick resettlement in EM III and its part -contemporary MM IA. Pure EM III (post-EM II and pre-polychrome) levels may be distinguished at Knossos (and at Gournia), and there may well have been an EM III forerunner of the Old Pälace (that belongs to about the end of MM IA). The MM IA settlement of Knossos was quite large. An important development was the appearance of mountain shrines, although it is not necessary that their organisation foreshadows that of the palaces. Improvements in technology, save for the appearance of the potter's wheel, are difficult to date (for example, granulation, filigree, and improvements in daggers), but came sometime around the time of the founding of the Old Palaces; ashlar was introduced; and health seems to have been quite good, better at any rate than in Mainland Greece. By the end of the OP period there was a rich, sophisticated and technologically advanced society around the palaces. Foreign contacts in EM III/MM IA were few, although importing of copper from Cyprus may have begun then. How then did the palaces come about? Answers have to be given in terms of Crete and Cretans, without the convenience of immigrants. The palaces were founded at old settlements, which seem to have been part of regional groups (defined in terms of pottery and habits of burial, though in time we may be able to add stoneware, seals and metalware as criteria). At Mallia there is the special problem of explaining the relationship of the probable Old Palace to the Agora and the buildings of Quartier Mu, which have so many of the attributes of a palace. I cannot find anything in Crete to explain how the organisation of a large amount of space around a large North-South central court came to be the pattern. J.W. Shaw's recent suggestion of a need to illuminate the religious rooms of the West sides by the morning sun is attractive; but we still have the problems of size, complexity and organisation. Who, for instance, were the masterbuilders, and how were the plans chosen? We must not resort to pomposity to fill the void. Nor may we postulate foreigners. It is, however, reasonable to see a generic resemblance with palaces and palace-temples and temples of the Near East, with Crete at the West end of a long line of such buildings stretching as far as the Euphrates and Tigris. This need not mean direct influence, just that a Minoan in the Levant or a Levantine in Crete would have found the social order familiar. Still, how the Minoan ruling class was created is quite elusive. As to why Crete was generally self-contained in the Old Pälace period and before, it may be that the island was preoccupied</page><page sequence="3">BICS 28 (1981) 165 with internal troubles and that it was not till Knossos had emerged as clearly in command in the New Pâlace period that the Cretans could really turn to the Aegean. We do not know the answers, but we do have from EM II the evidence of distinctive wealth and, I think, of war and of a ruling class which could have harnessed the skills and energies of Crete and ordered the palaces. 18 February 1981 MR R.F. HODDINOTT Northern Neighbours in the Mycenaean World Chronological confusion and the state of archaeological research contribute to the difficulty of an overall picture of the north or, more precisely, the north-eastern neighbours of the Mycenaean world. Known to Homer and Herodotos as "Thracians", they were an illiterate Indo-European people, the date of whose ethnic crystallization is much disputed. Religious symbolism provides an important clue to their identity. Originating in part from a mature Neolithic culture brought from Anatolia to a wide area of the Carpatho- Balkans, the transition to the EBA was largely caused by eastern and northern invaders whose horned animal symbols replaced but were later associated with the sun-fire symbols of the earlier culture. Following the c. third millennium EBA, the Carpatho-Balkans shared in the general upheavals at its end. In North Thracian lands, the Otomani and Wietenberg cultures and their associated neighbours emerged as powerful groups, their flowering covering at least the middle quarters of the second millennium. Settlements such as Otomani and Derjida, and ritual constructions as at Sãlacea, Sãrata-Monteoru, Pufegti and Wietenberg, with their finds, contribute to knowledge previously based on numerous bronze and fewer gold hoards. These, chronologically classified into four horizons, demonstrate not only the maximum spread of Otomani-Wietenberg power or influence west across the Hungarian Plain and east to the Dnieper, but also its metallurgical wealth and skills, expressed mainly in weapons, ornaments and tools. By about the thirteenth-twelfth centuries the much increased size of fortified sites, such as Corne^tii-Jadani, and the huge buried hoards mark the ending of what may have been the Thracian heroic age. So long and stagnant was the subsequent Dark Age that gold and silver armour and ornaments of the fourth century - with native anthropomorphic and zoomorphic representations - may reflect an idealized Thracian Bronze Age. There are analogies in decoration between Mycenae and Otomani-Wietenberg Thrace, but it is doubtful whether the former influenced the latter. Contacts between the two worlds were geographically and physically possible but unproven, although the Argonaut legend suggests Mycenaean interest in the north and Thracian as well as Trojan obstacles. The presence of Late Mycenaean pottery at Assiros, Vardaroftsa and other Macedonian centres indicates at least gradual Mycenaean economic expansion. Thracian LBA fortresses, as at Maroneia and Ostur Kamuk, suggest the need for defence measures against a powerful but unidentified enemy - which may have been Mycenae attempting the land route to the riches of the north. After the decline of Mycenae, Thracians were among the northerners who entered Macedonia.</page><page sequence="4">166 BICS 28 (1981) 28 April 1981 DR LYVIA MORGAN The West House Paintings , Thera The miniature friezes and large panels from Rooms 5 and 4 of the West House at Thera were, it is proposed, painted according to a scheme in which the various scenes unite to form a theme. North Wall (Rm. 5): The Meeting on the Hill is interpreted in the light of peak sanctuaries. A fragment of a shepherd holding a stick (below The Meeting in publications) should almost certainly be transferred to the area between The Meeting and the Pastoral Community. In the latter scene flocks are led in upland pastures. This association between a hill-top ritual, shepherds, flocks and high grazing grounds is appropriate to aspects of peak sanctuaries. Analogies with pastoralism in modern Greece suggest that summer trans- humance may have been the occasion for ceremonies such as that represented in The Meeting. The Ship- wreck and Warriors scene is a genre (recurrent in Aegean iconography) typifying the dangers of the sea. Shipping and piracy would be restricted to summer months when navigation was possible. The juxtaposition of these scenes, and the inclusion in The Meeting on the Hill of both shepherds and men whose robes and gestures recur in The Ship Procession, indicate that the ceremony incorporated supplications for the welfare of both pastoralism and maritime concerns (the dangers of the latter being shown in typified form). This relationship is comprehensible if the ceremony was concerned with the seasonal interests of the people. East Wall: The Landscape is a single scene of hunting in an aquatic landscape. While human activity is replaced by that of animal, the scene of chase by water complements those preoccupations of potential raids and aquatic enterprise on the neighbouring walls. South Wall: The Ship Procession is interpreted as a nautical festival, on the grounds that the vessels have been decorated, carry élite passengers, are watched excitedly by the populace, and could not by virtue of their propulsion be travelling more than a short distance. The most widespread and hence likely occasion for such a festival is the inauguration of the new navigation season. Relationships between the scenes: (1) Repetition: specific robes and votive gestures associate the two ceremonies (The Meeting, The Ship Procession); helmets used in nautical display in The Procession (S. Wall) complement those worn in the scene of potential coastal warfare on the N. Wall. (2) Analogy: juxta- position of lions, griffins and warriors in Aegean iconography associates hunting with warfare through the power of survival; in the paintings animals hunt by water, warriors are associated with the sea, lions and griffins are used as ships' figureheads. Panels: The Fishermen, Stern Cabins and Priestess (associated with the ships) reflect the maritime interests of the scenes. Conclusions: The ceremonies (Meeting, Ship Procession) are concerned with activities which occur in early summer (transhumance and the navigation season). Details of the plants and animals confirm the time of year. The interests of the Theran people are held within the context of a particular season.</page></plain_text>
