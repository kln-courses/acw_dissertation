<plain_text><page sequence="1">R. Keller Kimbrough University of Colorado, Boulder Bloody Hell! Reading Boys' Books in Seventeenth- Century Japan Both in and outside of Japan, the early history of Japanese woodblock-printed children's literature continues to be insufficiently understood. Even the topic is controversial insofar as some contemporary scholars have denied the exis- tence of a Japanese children's literature prior to the nineteenth- century impor- tation of Western notions of the child. By examining a young boy's collection of picture books that were sealed inside a statue of the bodhisattva Jizõ from 1678 to around 1980, the present article seeks to illuminate the contents and principal themes of "boys' books" - an incipient form of Japanese children's literature apparently written for and consumed by children - published in the Kyoto-Osaka region in the 1660s and 1670s. In particular, the article takes up the issue of extravagant representational violence in a subset of four illustrated warrior tales with obvious links to the contemporaneous sekkyõ and ko-jõruri puppet theaters, exploring the salient features of those works in their historical and literary contexts. keywords: Japanese children's literature - media violence - monsters - Yoshitsune-Benkei - Oguri - sekkyõ - ko-jõruri - yõkai - kodorno no ehon - irui-mono Asian Ethnology Volume 74, Number 1 • 2015, 111-139 © Nanzan Institute for Religion and Culture</page><page sequence="2">For most contemporary important discoveries historians of the of twentieth Japanese children's century was literature, a trove of one ten of illus- the most important discoveries of the twentieth century was a trove of ten illus- trated children's books inside a sealed wooden statue of the bodhisattva Jizõ ttüc in the Dainichi Hall ýz H it of the former (now defunct) Izawaji Temple Stfū# in Izawa-chõ, Matsusaka City, Mie Prefecture. The seated Jizõ image seems to have been carved by a master craftsman of the Nanbokuchõ period (1336-1392), and in 1950 it was designated an Important Cultural Property {jüyö bunkazai ÄSc 'XiYM) by the Japanese Agency for Cultural Affairs. During the course of exami- nations and repairs in March 1915, December 1935, and August 1950, the statue was found to contain two paper-wrapped bundles of twelve small woodblock- printed books (ten of which were children's picture books), a thick sheaf of used calligraphy practice paper, a copybook of warrior pictures, and a kawarabtm 3ĒJK (broadsheet). The objects were largely disregarded until 1980, when the scholar Okamoto Masaru, having seen copies of the books and broadsheet made in the fall of 1978, had the statue reopened to further examine its contents.1 Recognizing the historical significance of the materials, Okamoto was amazed by what he found. The books, calligraphy paper, and broadsheet had all apparendy belonged to the late son of a seventeenth-century merchant by the name of Obiya (sash-maker/seller) Jirõkichi , who had placed them inside the image on the eleventh day of the ninth month of 1678 as a memorial offering for his child. Jizõ was renowned in the medieval and early-modern periods for his salvation of children, and Jirokichi's decision to seal a part of his dead son, represented by the boy's books and calligraphy, inside a statue of the bodhisattva would have ensured the boy's connection to Jizõ in the afterworld. The boy's name, Obiya Chõkurõ is written in a childish hand on the inside cover of two of the picture books, and the outer wrappings of the two bundles are inscribed with the incanta- tion namu Jizõ daibosatsu "Hail the Great Bodhisattva Jizõ" and the boy's posthumous Buddhist name, Eigaku Hisamoto Shinji The boy's age at the time of his death is unknown, as are the causes and circumstances of his demise. Okamoto speculates that Chõkurõ was fifteen or sixteen years old when he died,2 but considering the awkward strokes of his signature on the inside cover of Tengu-zoroe (An assemblage of tengu), along with the date 112 I Asian Ethnology Volume 74, Number 1 • 2015</page><page sequence="3">kimbrough: boys' books in SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY JAPAN I 113 Enpõ 6 (1678, the year of the boy's death) written in the same unpracticed hand, it seems moře likely to me that he was no older than eight or nine. Three of Chôkurô's ten picture books contain publication dates, including 1667, 1668, and 1677, and considering that the entire collection was sealed inside the statue in 1678, Okamoto concludes that all ten volumes were likely published in the Kanbun and Enpõ 3ŁS eras, between 1661 and 1677. This would make them roughly contemporaneous with the akahon (red books) of Edo, which are believed to have flourished between circa 1661 and 1748, but none of which can actually be dated to before 1678.3 Several of Chôkurô's books were produced by prominent Kyoto publishers of ko-jõruri playbooks, including Yamamoto Kuhei UWÄÄitr, Hachimonjiya Hachizaemon and (probably) Tsu- ruya Kiemon &lt;§Sl1¡ííjíirFEI. Considering Izawa-chô's proximity to the old capital, which Chôkurô's father would have had occasion to visit in connection with his busi- ness, and from which he may have been expected to bring back souvenirs for his son, Okamoto surmises that they were all published there. Thus, given the circumstances of their likely purchase and preservation, Chôkurô's books - even the undated ones - are renowned today as the oldest extant children's books of the Kyoto-Osaka region. The status, or even presence, of children's literature in premodern Japan is con- troversial among scholars today. Karatani Kõjin, for example, argued in a work written around 1980 that insofar as "the child" is a Western European philosophi- cal construct, "it was not until [the notion of] 'the child' came to exist [in Meiji- period Japan] that literature and amusements 'for children' appeared" (Karatani 1993, 119). In a 2002 review of the multi-volume Nihon nojidõ bungaku B [Japanese Children's Literature], Joan Ericson likewise writes that "children's literature has a history rooted in state construction, nationhood and the arrival of modernity," and that in one of the volumes she reviews, Sekiguchi Yasuyoshi "breaks new ground in pushing back the usual starting point in literature for children in Japan - conventionally dated from Iwaya Sazanami's Kojjane maru Cl (1891) - rooting it in a particular Sunday school tract of Christian missionaries pub- lished in 1872" (Ericson 2002, 105 and 106). On the other hand, Kristin Williams argues that "children's literature emerged [in Japan] as early as the late 1670s," and that although it faded in the late nineteenth century, displaced by modern children's literature in movable type, Edo -period children's literature lasted for over two hundred years, borrowed from and transformed literary and theatrical sources, influenced the visual imagination of adult popular literature, and helped to shape both Edo- period concepts of the child and Edo-period children themselves. (Williams 2012, 5) In my own writings on eighteenth- century children's books (Kimbrough 2006a and 2008), I have implicidy sided with those who trace the history of Japa- nese children's literature back to the early Edo period. As Williams has observed, much of the current controversy seems to stem from a basic lack of information - particularly in English-language sources - about Edo-period publications for chil-</page><page sequence="4">114 I Asian Ethnology 74/1 • 2015 dren, as well as from the unfortunate tendency of some contemporary scholars simply to repeat what has become an entrenched "common knowledge" about the history of Japanese children's literature. Thus, given the pressing need for more "data" in the field of Japanese children's literary studies, the present article has two central aims: to introduce to English-reading audiences Chokuro's unique collection of illustrated books and to reflect on the implications of those books for our understanding of the early history of children's literature in Japan. Among Chokuro's ten books are three concerning the exploits of the warrior Minamoto no Yoshitsune (1159-1189) and his retainer Musashibõ Benkei and I will argue that those works in particular demonstrate the presence of a kind of ultra-violent, non-didactic literature for children and young adults in the sev- enteenth century that was not unlike the sensationally violent "penny dreadfuls" and "dime novels" of nineteenth-century England and America - works written to entertain (rather than instruct) by appealing to a seemingly timeless and universal human fascination with bloodshed and brutality. Chokuro's books It is hard to overstate the importance of Chokuro's book collection, espe- cially insofar as it suggests a range of reading material that would have been deemed appropriate for merchant-class boys in the 1660s and 1670s. Like those of many boys today, Chokuro's tastes (or perhaps those of his father and/or other relatives who likely bought the books) seem to have tended toward monsters, anthropomorphic animals, silly jokes, and violence. Unfortunately, one can only speculate as to what sorts of books we might have today if Chõkurõ had been a girl. The books span a continuum between those that were published for very small children - for example, highly simplistic works like Tengu-zoroe , which are dominated by their illustrations and which contain very little supporting text - and those that purvey more sophisti- cated narrative content, such as Oguri Hangan Terute mono# atari &amp; C *9 WÉÍT h (The tale of Oguri Hangan and Terute), that was based on a related theater book for adults and which would probably have been more interesting and appro- priate for older children. Based on the books' relative contents, which suggest the gradual growth and maturation of a child, we can imagine that Chokuro's father may have bought one or two volumes for his son every year until he died. One of the most remarkable aspects of the collection is its lack of obviously didactic content. The principal aim of Chokuro's picture books, it seems, was to entertain rather than to inculcate or instruct. Other than a vague celebration of martial heroics, there is no explicit mention of Confucian, Buddhist, or any other philosophical principles or moral values that are so common in more sophisticated works of "adult" literature of the time, including woodblock-printed collections of filial piety tales, bukemono 1ŘMM (samurai tales), and illustrated biographies of Indian, Chinese, and Japanese Buddhist exemplars. One of Chokuro's contempo- raries, the best-selling Confucian moralist Fujii Ransai (1618-1709), seems to have single-handedly flooded the book market with virtuous tracts in the mid-</page><page sequence="5">figure i.

Furthermore, the characters in those works (both the simpler illustrated catalogs and the more developed narratives) behave with impunity, dem- onstrating little or no thought for the motivations, implications, or consequences of their sometimes callous and brutal actions - a characteristic fundamentally at odds with what Judy Wakabayashi and others have described as the pre-Meiji penchant for didacticism in children's books (Wakabayashi 2008, 227-28). The following is a descriptive list of the ten picture books discovered inside the wooden statue of Jizõ at Izawaji Temple. All of them are small - a mere five inches tall and some three-and-a-half inches wide - and most of them are extremely well preserved. (The exception is Ikusa mai , which is far more battered and worn than all of the other books.) The books were published with black-and-white mono- chrome illustrations, many of which were skillfully colored in (by their owner, per- haps) in shades of red, green, yellow, orange, blue, and brown.5 Only Ojjuri Hangan Terute mono# atari was left wholly untouched; considering that it was published in 1677, Chõkurõ may not have had the interest or the opportunity to color it in before he died in the following year. I have grouped the works according to Okamoto Masaru's three categories of compendium books, nonhuman tales, and sekkyõ and ko-jõruri volumes.6 The four compendium books appear to have been published for younger audiences (both readers and listeners, insofar as the works were likely read aloud to children by their parents), while the two books of nonhuman tales and the four sekkyõ and ko-jõruri books were apparently published for older children. Compendium books Tengu-zoroe (An assemblage of tengu) One volume; undated; published by "Tsuruya" 1§It, whom Okamoto takes to be either the Kyoto publisher Tsuruya Kiemon or Tsuruya Gohei ÄUÜtSÄÄr, but more likely the former (Okamoto 1982, 320).

The tengu are shown in various poses, and while most of them are drawn with long noses, a few have beaks.

Contains a series of unrelated illustra- tions of funny or improbable scenes, including ones in which two hungry ghosts (jjaki IRA) hold down a demon with a gourd; a man keeps a dragonfly tied to the end of his excessively long nose hair; a person has attached a sail to the back of an ox; a demon loses a sumo wrestling match to a hungry ghost; a man rides backwards on a wild boar; and a demon smokes a pipe. Some of the scenes are notable for the lev- ity with which they treat sacred religious figures. For example, in the second illustra- tion, King Enma HBHIÎ, the judge of the dead, is shown embracing the bodhisattva Jizõ while a jealous boy lover (oni no wakashu a "demon wakashu ") looks on. Likewise, in the book's fourth illustration (see figure 2), Enma is shown leering at Datsueba the "clothes-snatching hag" of the Sanzu River in the afterworld, who is dressed as a lovely courtesan and trailed by her own "demon maid" (oni no ¿fe jo A^)TÍC). As Okamoto has observed, the illustrations in this work are likely to have appealed to children of various ages (Okamoto 1982, 321). Akusõ-zukushiM-M^ &lt; L (A compendium of wicked priests) One volume; undated; judging from the publisher's mark on the cover - the char- acter % in a circle - it was probably published by Yamamoto Ruhei of Kyoto. Con- tains portraits of eighteen evil warrior-monks, beginning with Õishi Yamamaru LlilA, who is said to have been a great villain of Mount Midoro in Bitchū Province during the reign of the forty-seventh human emperor (Junnin r. 758-764). The book concludes with Taira no Kiyomori (1118-1181), the leader of the Taira during the first years of the Genpei War, whom it shows being carried off to hell in a burning carriage. The textual explanations are more substan- tial than in either Tengu-zoroe or Dõke e-zukushi. Senmitsu hanashi L (Tales of three in a thousand) One volume; undated; publisher unknown. Contains the inner title E-hanashi &amp; ii£L (Picture-stories). A collection of fifteen illustrated accounts of rare, strange, and sometimes terrifying dreams: so rare, in fact, that they are like only "three in a thousand." The dreams include those of a man who once encountered a giant disembodied head in the mountains; a man who overheard King Enma pronounc- ing judgment on another man who had been unfaithful to his master; a man who was blown off course on his way to Nagasaki and then sailed to the island of Mount Penglai SÉfSíLlJ; a man who found a three-foot, seven-eyed baby abandoned in the mountains; a man who was approached by three giant skulls that demanded to be avenged; two men who, in parallel dreams, ran away from the same blood-stained ubume (the ghost of a woman who died in childbirth); a man who was saved from a venomous snake by his copy of the Kannon Sutra ; and various others.</page><page sequence="9">figure 5.

Oka- moto observes that in accord with its title, which invokes the jõruri puppet theater, the opening and closing passages of Imo jõruri are written in the style of sekkyõ and ko-jõruri (Okamoto 1982, 326). The second work, Bijin tataki , is a sing-song list of beautiful women of the past - both historical and fictional - including Yang Guifei #ÂÍ5 of China, the goddess Kichijõten the Some-dono Empress ŽcStJn , Izumi Shikibu fPÄÄoP, Koshikibu no Naishi Murasaki Shikibu ^Äol5, the daughter of Ki no Aritsune Jõruri-hime Matsukaze fôM and Murasame łtffi, Terute-no-hime Ono no Komachi /MJvhflT, Tokiwa Gozen ^ jffflJtíí, Sayohime /J^ÍĚ, Senju-no-mae and many others.

Tells the story of the teenaged Yoshitsune's slaughter of 999 people in the capital, as well as his legendary first meeting with his loyal retainer, the warrior-monk Benkei. Unlike the other three sekkyõ and ko-jõruri books in Chôkurô's collection, Ushi- waka sennin-giri alternates between full pages of text and illustration, suggesting that it may have been intended for slighdy older, more accomplished readers. Benkei tanjõki (The birth and life of Benkei) One volume; undated; judging from the publisher's mark on the cover (the char- acter % in a circle), it was probably published by Yamamoto Kuhei of Kyoto.

Recounts a sim- plified version of the medieval sekkyõ story of Oguri Hangan and Terute-no-hime.7 Although Okamoto classifies Chôkurô's picture books as compendium books, nonhuman tales, and sekkyõ and ko-jõruri books, we might as easily divide the ten works into two alternate groups: tales of the strange and supernatural, and warrior tales. Judging from the limited sample in Chôkurô's library, the two themes of creepiness and combat constituted the heart of boy's literature in the Kyoto-Osaka region in the mid-to-late seventeenth century. Tengu-zoroe , Dõke e-zukushi , and Senmitsu hanashi - three of the simpler volumes - clearly fit the former category, while Akusõ-zukushi and the four sekkyõ and ko-jõruri books fit the latter. As works of fantasy warrior fiction, Ikusa mai and Imo jõruri can be placed in either group; they are multivalent, much like the animator Craig Bardett's contemporary Ameri- can cartoon series "Dinosaur Train," which cleverly appeals to many boys' dispa- rate interests in dinosaurs and trains. Only Bijin tataki is inappropriate to either category, although, in defense of Okamoto's classifications, it fits in well with the compendium books (but not with his category of nonhuman tales, in which he places it as a result of its combination with Imo jõruri).</page><page sequence="14">figure ii.

Only one of the four volumes has yet been matched with an actual extant shõhon : Ojjuri Hanjjan Terute monojjatari , the text and illustrations of which Okamoto has shown were strongly influenced by those of the Oguri Hangcin jo C WUT published by Shõhon-ya Gohei in 1675. But based on the language of the stories (which incorporate many of the distinctive linguistic conventions of sekkyõ and ko-jõruri ), their characters and contents, and the physical aspects of the books (three out of four of which have black-patterned covers like those used for shõhon), Okamoto suggests that the four sekkyõ and ko-jõruri books in Chökurö's collection were published as "byproducts" (fukuscmbutsu M of theater books for adults.8 As both Okamoto and Nakano Mitsutoshi have observed, this is not particularly surprising insofar as three of the four volumes were published by either Yamamoto Kuhei or Hachimonjiya Hachizaemon, both of whom are known to have been prominent Kyoto publishers of shõhon playbooks.9 Of the four sekkyõ and ko-jõruri picture books in Chökurö's collection, three concern the twelfth-century Genpei War hero Minamoto no Yoshitsune and his devoted retainer Benkei, both of whom have been celebrated as cultural icons since the thirteenth or fourteenth century.10 Whether their presence in nearly half of Chökurö's warrior books indicates their popularity in early Japanese children's books in general, or whether it mirrors Chökurö's (or his father's) own preferences in particular, is impossible to say. But in either case it is remarkable, and it reflects Yoshitsune and the wild warrior-monk Benkei's prominence in the popular adult fiction and drama of Chökurö's day. The first of the three Yoshitsune-Benkei books, Benkei tanjõki, or, loosely trans- lated, "The birth and life of Benkei," chronicles the life of Musashibö Benkei from his inauspicious birth to his abscondence to the northeast with the young Yoshi- tsune prior to the Genpei War. The story that it tells would have been well-known to audiences of the time from its inclusion in numerous other sources, including seventeenth-century woodblock-printed editions of the medieval Gikeiki ÄÜfö, the otoßizöshi Benkei monoßatari in, and various noh, kõwakamai #ïrÂ, and ko-jõruri texts. Unlike those other works, however, Benkei tanjõki focuses on Benkei's earlier years, which may have held greater appeal for younger audiences, rather than on his more famous later exploits, including his valiant defense of Yoshitsune in the years following the Genpei War and his outstandingly gruesome "standing death" at the Koromo River ïcJII. Instead, Benkei tanjõki tells of Benkei's mother's unusually protracted pregnancy, which is said to have lasted for a full three years and three months; Benkei's laughing declaration at birth that it was "too bright outside" (the illustration of which appears to be indebted to earlier woodblock-printed editions of Gikeiki [figures 12 and 13]); litde Benkei's</page><page sequence="16">figure 12.

The second of Chökurö's three Yoshitsune-Benkei books, Minamoto no Yoshi- tsune kõmyõ-zoroe (Minamoto no Yoshitsune's glorious feats), hereafter abbrevi- ated to Yoshitsune kõmyõ-zoroe , is an illustrated catalog of fourteen of Yoshitsune's most famous accomplishments, all of which appear in other contemporaneous works of literature and drama. Following a short biographical introduction, the work begins by recounting the legend of the fifteen-year- old Yoshitsune's sennin- giri ŤÁÍ0 (slaughter of a thousand): his attempted murder, as a Buddhist memo- rial offering to his late father, of a thousand people associated with the Taira. The story is mentioned in passing in Benkei tanjõkiy and it constitutes the principal dramatic event in Ushiwaka sennin-giri , Hashi Benkei . The boy ultimately fails in his vindictive endeavor insofar as his thousandth victim is Benkei, who, as we can see in figure 7, fights and then surrenders to the nimble Yoshitsune and becomes his loyal retainer. This first account is followed by the stories of Yoshitsune's annihilation of the disrespectful samurai Sekihara Yoichi and all of his thirty-six men (figure 14); Yoshitsune's extermination of Kumasaka Chöhan ÂÎE and his band of bandits; Yoshitsune's killing of the six thieves who murdered his mother at the Yamanaka post station (figure 15), a marvelous bloodbath that has been most colorfully depicted in the Yamanaka Tokiwa lilŤířil picture scrolls attributed to Iwasa Matabei ëÎËXÂÎtr (1578-1650); several of Yoshitsune's more</page><page sequence="18">figure 15.

What may be most surprising for modern readers of these children's books is the extremity of their violence and the seemingly cavalier ways in which that violence is portrayed. Nevertheless, when compared to some nineteenth-century children's literature in England and America, Chökurö's Yoshitsune-Benkei books are hardly unique. American dime novels of the 1860s and 1870s, whose "primary audience," according to Harold Schechter (2005, 34), "was young boys," trucked in particu- larly gruesome and salacious material. Russel Nye explains that "twenty deaths per novel was not unusual, and the formula demanded at least one dangerous crisis per chapter. You began, said Robert Davis, who wrote dozens of Westerns for Street and Smith, with 'a hero, a villain, dustbiting redskins, three Colts, thin air, and much des- perado dialogue,' and proceeded from there" (Nye 1970, 205). Schechter writes that American boys weren't the only audience for sensationalistic schlock during the late nineteenth century. In Britain, their juvenile cousins were devouring count- less of so-called "penny dreadfuls" - a term indicative of both the cut-rate cost and quality of these tacky publications and the frequently appalling content of their stories. Like Seth Jones , Deadwood Dick on Deck , and other dime novels, the penny dreadfuls of the Victorian era specialized in escapist fantasies with a heavy emphasis on frenzied action and graphic gore. If anything, these lurid entertain- ments - which were aimed primarily at working-class youngsters, mostly (though not exclusively) boys - were even more wildly violent than their American coun- terparts. Besides celebrating the exploits of outlaws, thieves, and murderers - who were invariably cast as Robin Hood- style heroes - they often focused on the crimes of psychopathic killers, whose atrocities were recounted in hideous detail. (Schechter 2005, 34-36) Like Chökurö's warrior tales, penny dreadfuls included illustrations, many of which sought to capture "the most bloodcurdling moments of the story" (Schechter 2005, 41)5 appealing to what William James once described in a different context as "our aboriginal capacity for murderous excitement."11 Whether or not the "problem" of violence in our own contemporary children's entertainment would have been a problem for seventeenth-century audiences in Japan is unclear. The perception of "referential violence" (represented, as opposed to actual, violence) is inherently subjective, and as contemporary social scientists have shown, it tends to result more from the ways in which that violence is por- trayed - what the film scholar Stephen Prince has dubbed the "stylistic amplitude" of its depiction (Prince 2003, 35) - than from the represented behaviors themselves. In discussing Prince's work on violence in modern motion pictures, James Kend- rick writes that "we can see film violence as having two primary components: the referential component (that is, the behavior depicted) and the cinematic treatment (what Prince terms 'stylistic amplitude'), which is a function of graphicness and</page><page sequence="20">I30 I Asian Ethnology 74/1 • 2015 figure 1 7. Ushiwaka sennin-ßiri, Hashi Benkei (Little Yoshitsune slays a thousand, and Benkei on the bridge), 1667. Yoshitsune (left) learns martial arts under the tutelage of tengu. Courtesy of the Izawa Town Council. duration" (Kendrick 2009, 13). We can apply Prince's notion of stylistic ampli- tude to a variety of media. For example, in their originally uncolored woodblock- printed forms, the picture books in Chokuro's collection would have been slightly less graphic than they are today (or were in 1678), after some unknown person - probably Chõkurõ - colored them in, highlighting blood spurts and the like and thereby increasing the amplitude of their depictions (figures 15 and 16). Rather than being repelled by the stories' violence, the unknown amateur artist seems to have reveled in it (like many boys might today), and, as an active consumer, to have actually participated in its vivification. In one particular scene in Benkei tanjõki , for example, the only part of the line drawing to which color has been added is the blood - now painted bright red - shooting out of a swordsman's sev- ered neck and head (figure 16). 12 The utter absence of color from the rest of the image allows for a surrealistic intensification of the pictorial gore. The last of the three Yoshitsune-Benkei books is Ushiwaka sennin-giri , Hashi Benkei (Little Yoshitsune slays a thousand, and Benkei on the bridge), hereafter abbreviated to Ushiwaka sennin-giri . Like Yoshitsune kõmyõ-zoroe , it depicts the teenaged Yoshitsune (known in his youth as Ushiwaka ^ïf) as a twelfth-century mass-murdering terrorist- hero. The immediate origins of the story are obscure, but there is a loosely related ko-jõruri playbook with nearly the same tide ( Ushi- waka sennin-giri as opposed to Ushiwaka sennin-giri , Hashi Benkei ), published in 1679 by Yamamoto Kuhei and attribúted to the chanter Uji Kaganojõ ^ÍpÍJDÂÍ^. Unfortunately, that work dates to a dozen years after Chokuro's book, and its plot is far more convoluted. However, Muroki Yatarõ has suggested that a ref- erence to a lost play by the name of [Blank] sennin-giri OŤA*5J in a list of ko-jõruri</page><page sequence="21">kimbrough: boys' books in SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY JAPAN I 131 compositions in a 1661 entry in the diary Matsudaira Tamato no kami nikki B SE may in fact refer to the 1667 picture book's antecedent work.13 Chokuro's Ushiwaka sennin-giri begins with Yoshitsune's widowed mother, Tokiwa Gozen, deciding to send her young son to live and study at Kurama Tem- ple ïîcJItP after her husband's unsuccessful rebellion against the Taira. Yoshitsune finds himself surrounded by 380 other acolytes, 90 of them Taira. Because Yoshi- tsune wears the same clothes every day - even on special, formal occasions - the other acolytes tease him, calling him the " minomushi chigo " or "bag- worm acolyte," in reference to the minomushi' supposedly unchanging appear- ance throughout the four seasons.14 Yoshitsune blushes, hides, and weeps, after which he writes a letter to his mother. Tokiwa immediately sews him a splendid set of clothes, the elaborate description of which takes up more than a third of the entire tale. Later, Yoshitsune is pleased to receive his new attire, but he takes to sneaking away from the temple to practice martial arts in the woods of Sõjõ Valley The accompanying illustration (figure 17) shows him sparring with the various tengu of Mount Kurama - a visual reference to the legends of his miracu- lous training, recounted in the otogizõshi Tengu no dairi (The palace of the tengu) and other late-medieval sources - but, surprisingly, the written text contains no mention of tengu. One day Yoshitsune realizes that it has been thirteen years since the death of his father, whom he recalls having lost at the age of two. In Japanese Buddhist cul- ture, the thirteenth death anniversary is a particularly important one, and Yoshi- tsune decides that rather than reciting "one thousand or ten thousand scrolls of sutras" for his father's sake, as an ordinary person would, he should travel into the capital and kill a thousand Taira as his own more personal Buddhist offering. He spends seven days and seven nights reciting sutras and chanting the nenbutsu It ik (the ritual invocation of the name of Amida Buddha) for his father, after which he makes his way into the city and kills 999 passersby, both high and low alike. He utterly terrorizes the capital, for as the narrator whimsically explains, "those who saw or heard tell of what he did all exclaimed, 'Oh, how frighten- ing!"' As in all other versions of the story, Benkei approaches Yoshitsune at Fifth Avenue Bridge, but before Yoshitsune can kill him, Benkei surrenders and swears allegiance to the young lord. The two return to Kurama Temple, and in a final, formulaic line reminiscent of countless ko-jõruri playbooks, the narrator declares that "there was no one at all, noble or base, who did not praise Yoshitsune for his glorious feat." At the risk of oversimplification, Ushiwaka sennin-giri is thus the story of a sen- sitive boy who is teased about his clothes, and who gets revenge by first procuring a better set of clothes - far fancier than those of his peers - and then killing 999 strangers whom he associates with the men who killed his father and, presumably, with the Taira acolytes who bullied him at school. On a purely emotional level, his actions make perfect sense. Furthermore, his ambition to avenge his father's death is admirably filial, especially in the context of a seventeenth- century storytelling culture that valorized vendettas. But however brave and accomplished Yoshitsune</page><page sequence="22">132 I Asian Ethnology 74/1 • 2015 might have been, the way in which he pursues his revenge is disturbing insofar as he targets seemingly random residents of the capital.15 In Tengu no dairi, it is in fact Yoshitsune's late father Yoshitomo HIE who, in his rebirth as Dainichi Buddha urges Yoshitsune to abandon his Bud- dhist endeavors in order to focus on killing the Taira. In a late Muromachi-period picture scroll in the possession of the British Library, for example, Yoshitomo/ Dainichi tells Yoshitsune that he would rather be avenged than have his son tran- scribe for him "a thousand or ten thousand sutras."16 (Having already become a buddha, Yoshitomo is not likely to have needed the merit.) More significantly, in the course of an extended prophecy at the conclusion of the tale, Yoshitomo/ Dainichi actually commands his son to carry out the sennin-giri memorial offering to him. He says, You will be fourteen next year, and in observance of the thirteenth anniversary of my death, you must set out to slay a thousand men at Fifth Avenue Bridge. After you have killed the first 999, Musashibõ Benkei, the heir of the Kumano shrine intendant Tanzõ, will come. Don't kill him; save his life and make him a retainer. He will serve you for a very long time. After that, go back home and have a blood celebration. (Tsuji 1999, 367b-68a) This strange and callous instruction seems to have been too much for some medieval storytellers, because at least one Tengu no dairi manuscript - the Shinoda Jun'ichi text - seeks to justify Yoshitomo's directive by having him explain that the 999 people whom Yoshitsune will kill at Fifth Avenue Bridge will be reincarnations of the ants that devoured Yoshitsune when he was a winged insect listening to a sutra recitation in a former life.17 It is therefore those people's karma - their own just rewards, and nothing that ought to weigh on Yoshitsune's conscience - that they should be slaughtered by the reincarnated creature whom they themselves once consumed. In Ushiwaka sennin-giri (as in most extant Tengu no dairi texts), this kind of karmie justification is conspicuously absent, leaving a gaping moral void at the center of the tale. One might argue that by heroicizing loyalty, valor, and filial piety (as opposed to empathy, mercy, and restraint), the story models some of the "samurai virtues" that it fails to address more explicidy; but such an interpretation cannot account for the insensitive brutality of Yoshitsune's actions, or for the visceral, seemingly homicidal glee that pervades all of the warrior tales in Chôkurô's collection. More likely, Chôkurô's warrior tales simply cater to what Harold Schechter describes as "our age-old hunger for spectacles of suffering, tor- ture, and violent death."18 Yoshitsune's great medieval biography, Gikeiki , which circulated widely in numerous woodblock-printed editions in the seventeenth century, circumvents the troubling moral issue of Yoshitsune's rampage by avoiding it altogether. In Gikeiki , Yoshitsune's first meeting with Benkei occurs in the course of Benkei's campaign to steal a thousand swords. After having accumulated 999 blades, Benkei sees Yoshi- tsune, who is wearing a particularly marvelous weapon, and he attempts to steal it. The result, of course, is that Benkei ultimately surrenders to Yoshitsune and</page><page sequence="23">kimbrough: boys' books in SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY JAPAN I 133 figure 18.

Conclusion Media violence is a perennial concern for many parents today, but for one prominent Japanese writer in the early nineteenth century, the lack of violence in contemporary children's literature was the real cause for concern. In his 1811 Enseki zasshi (Swallowstone miscellany), Kyokutei Bakin decries the recent trend of parents teaching their children about profit 'ri f!J]. "In the past," he explains, "parents taught their children about valor, because valor 'yü H] is close to virtue '£Í Ü]."20 In a discussion of "ferocious heroes" (mosa ÍĚ#) in the performing arts of earlier years, Bakin writes, Again, in that same age [around the Genroku era, 1688-1704], Izumi Dayü's [ffiÄ;fcfe] puppet plays came to be called "Kinpira" [ánT].21 When you think about things like that in connection with [the popularity of ferocity in the kabuki of the time, it is no wonder that] in that age even children were wholeheartedly enamored with derring-do. However, if you were to show a picture book like Kioi sakura [ è tä£&gt;t£] illustrated by Okumura Genpachi Masanobu [HłłfSA ] to today's kids, they would not like it.22</page><page sequence="24">134 I Asian Ethnology 74/1 • 2015 As Kristin Williams has observed (2012, 103), Bakin was not the only one to see warrior stories as appropriate for children. The Convenient Guide to Gift-giving published in the same year [1811], recom- mended 'warrior picturebooks' (musha ehon as a gift: for a boy when he wore trousers for the first time (hakamagi fë it) in the eleventh month of his fifth year. In Enseki zasshi , as an example of the kind of work that he seems to have approved of for children, Bakin reproduces an illustration from the 1691 playbook Kinpira sennin-giri ty (Kinpira slays a thousand), published by the Izutsuya #MJÜ publishing house of Tõriaburachõ Ä ty VÈTO* in Edo (figure i8).23 The play is only loosely related to the older story of Yoshitsune's rampage - in this version, the great Sakata no Kinpira defeats a tengu challenger and then receives a famous sword capable of beheading a thousand men with a single stroke, which he subsequently uses to capture a spy in the capital, slay 999 men on Yahagi Bridge in Mikawa Province, and then, with the help of the former spy, find and kill a provin- cial traitor - but both the title of the play and its titular scene are indebted to the tale preserved in Ushiwaka sennin-giri. Even the woodblock-printed illustration of Kinpira's fight with Dobu Kuma ("Gutter Bear") on Yahagi Bridge (figure 18) seems to be based on images of Yoshitsune and Benkei's battle on Kyoto's Fifth Avenue Bridge, although with more severed heads. Kinpira sennin-girfs plot is certainly more complicated than that of Chokuro's Ushiwaka sennin-giri , but Bakin's playbook, which was presumably published for adults (or at least young adults), revels in bloody carnage in much the same way. So how are we to understand boys' books in seventeenth-century Japan? The ko-jõruri theater was notoriously violent, and that brutality seems to have car- ried over into Chokuro's Ushiwaka sennin-giri and the other warrior tales in his collection. While we might now expect children's books to make a kind of moral sense, there may have been no such expectation among seventeenth- century readers of works like Ushiwaka sennin-giri and Yoshitsune kõmyõ-zoroe (or, for that matter, among American and British boys in the late nineteenth century).24 Nakano Mitsutoshi has pointed out that our contemporary opinions about what constitutes a "children's book" differ considerably from those of peo- ple in the Kyoto-Osaka region in the early-modern period. Nakano writes that while today we tend to think of children's books as works that preserve, reveal, or appeal to the "spirit of childhood" ( döshin Ä'fr), for people in the Edo period, children's books were ones that served to quickly introduce children to the world of adults (Nakano 1985, 497-98). This may be a key to understanding the works in Chokuro's collection. The world of seventeenth-century adult entertainment, including the sekkyõ and ko-jõruri theaters, was a strange, lecherous, and savage one, and as byproducts of the playbooks and other ephemera that were produced in that setting, Chokuro's picture books may have served to introduce children like him to the popular diversions awaiting them in adulthood.</page><page sequence="25">kimbrough: boys' books in SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY JAPAN I 135 In a 2008 article on modern Japanese children's literature, Judy Wakabayashi writes that "although texts read to or by Japanese children had existed for centu- ries, it was only at the end of the nineteenth century that child-centered works - texts specifically oriented toward children's interests and needs in terms of content, language, and presentation - began to appear, and the initial catalyst for this was translations of foreign (predominantly European) children's literature." Waka- bayashi then describes the emergence of modern Japanese children's literature as being characterized by a "shift from a didactic and moralistic orientation to a focus on reading pleasure" (Wakabayashi 2008, 227). Although Wakabayashi is not alone in holding this opinion, the books in Chokuro's collection, with their plain disinterest in didacticism and conventional morality, would appear to refute this view. And if works like Tengu-zoroe and Imo jõruri are not child-centered "in terms of content, language, and presentation," then it is hard to imagine what is. Nevertheless, as others have shown in different cultural contexts, defining the parameters of "children's literature" - or even "the child" - is no easy task.25 I would propose that in the case of Edo-period Japan, at least, scholars should avoid the deceptive simplicity of binary dualisms (that is, child vs. adult, and chil- dren's books vs. adult books) and instead seek to understand all published works as lying on thematic and linguistic/orthographic continuums ranging from the simplistic and/or juvenile to the more complex and/or adult. Likewise - and the most recent science supports this proposition - we might better understand human beings as existing on a developmental continuum from birth to old age, rather than occupying one of two or three stages: "child" and "adult," or, in the language of contemporary American publishing, "child," "young adult," and "adult."26 The fact that a boy named Chõkurõ appears to have owned the ten picture books in the statue of Jizõ at Izawaji Temple has conveniendy allowed me to describe those works as "boys' books," but I suspect that my inclination to lump together such disparate publications as Tengu-zoroe and Ushiwaka sennin-giri may be almost as misguided as wholly denying the existence of children's literature in Japan prior to the late nineteenth century.

Charlotte Eubanks has suggested to me that "in staking out Fifth Avenue Bridge," Yoshitsune stations himself "at one of the major travel points between the Taira compounds around Rokuharamitsuji (east of the river) and the rest of the capital," making it seem "fairly likely that many of the people crossing that bridge will be on their way to or from a Taira neighborhood" (personal correspondence, July 2014).

Still, as Russel Nye explains (1970, 202-203), "The better dime novels rarely attained the level of literary mediocrity, but they were highly conventional in their regard for contem- porary standards of conduct. The action might be bloody and the heroes roughhewn, but the books were resolutely virtuous." One could perhaps make a similar argument in regard to Chökurö's Yoshitsune-Benkei books, especially considering Bakin's association of valor ( yū ) with virtue (gi). 25.

Karatani Kõjin suggests this, too, when he writes that unlike in rites of passage in which "a clear distinction is drawn between child and adult," our modern understanding of human maturation posits "a 'selP that develops and matures gradually.
