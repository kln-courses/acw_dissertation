<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Sentimental Education: Exploring the Interliminal Translation Theory and Postmodern Taste Marilyn Gaddis Rose Œhe notion of the interliminal in translation theory seems to have come into currency slightly before cross-reading, thus giving us an example of theory preceding taste.1 Yet whichever came first - and it is probably not even worth proving - postmodern reading and translation theory are mutually reinforcing. It is gratifying to read in Laurent Lamy's "Pas de deux" that translation theory can never reach closure (1995). It is exhilarating also, for that move liberates translation criticism and by extension literary interpretation. Every attempt to regularize theory in translation studies depends upon making meaning stay put, as Mariano Garcia-Landa demonstrates in his essay on epistemology in translation theory (1995). If meaning stayed put, exegesis would be the only valid critical strategy. Not that exegesis is flawed, but its chief value is archival. And while polysystem descriptions, now renamed Descriptive Translation Studies by their chief expounder Gideon Toury, guide us in data collecting (Toury 1995), their focus on the translation text obscures not only the interliminal gap between the first text and its translation(s) but also the veritable landfill the gap may have become.2 Exegesis aims to uncover how a text was 1. References to the "between" are not uncommon in anthropology, continental philosophy, cultural studies, Deconstruction, Postmodernism. Anthropologists in particular use liminal as a concept. - I began using "interliminal" publicly in late winter 1988 when I was working with Jean-François Lyotard's le différand and asked my Binghamton colleague Stephen David Ross for a term to use for the space between source and target phrases. But I believe I did not use the term in print until a Festschrift for Wolfram Wilss in 1990. In "Translation and le différand," for "La traduction proligère," Université de Montréal, October 5-7, 1989, 1 still used le différand - because I thought "interliminal" would never catch on. But as the history of science apprizes us, when the momentum is propitious, similar inventions and/or insights will occur in many sites. For example, some of the discussions recorded in The Translatability of Cultures. Figurations of the Space Between apparently go back to 1991. Contributor Klaus Reichert discusses the Buber- Rosenzweig Bible (169-83) as "an attempt at colonizing the space between two cultures" (181). See also Between Languages and Cultures: Translation and Cross-Cultural Texts, eds. Anuradha Dingwaney and Carol Maier (University of Pittsburgh, 1996). The contributors stop just short of a concept like "interliminal." - A version of the present article was read at the annual meeting of the Association canadienne-française pour 1" avancement des sciences (ACFAS), McGill University, May 17, 1996. A French translation by Valérie Galiussi is available from the author. 2. Gideon Toury 's career-long commitment to developing and refining this methodology is illuminating, even heroic. His summa may well be Descriptive Mélanges Kocourek in DFS 38 (1997) -85-</page><page sequence="2">86 Marilyn Gaddis Rose read. In principle, exegesis never changes reading; in actuality, we can never recover the consensus reading of a text prior to our own reading life.3 In translation criticism, exegesis takes no account of interliminal accrual. Old translations may still read acceptably, but the interliminal has inevitably changed. Our own reading will be richer if we engage in a hermeneutic motion to assess what the dynamic of language has changed in the interim. Our shared experience of literature will be immeasurably expanded in the process - as well as never-ending. My overt infra-premise is that a translation challenges our reading by giving it a boundary. But in setting this provisional boundary, a translation also establishes an interliminal space of sound, allusion, and meaning where we must collaborate, criticize, and rewrite. My covert infra-premise privileges bilingual or stereoscopic reading,4 because my remarks imply that reading with a single text, whether that of the first inditer or a translator (and the translator can be ourselves translating silently and intermittently while we read), impoverishes the experience of literature. To return finally to the stated premise of my title: what is remarkably gratifying and exhilarating is that probing the interliminal, made more perceptible by translation, induces postmodern expansion in even the most controlled rhetoric. We can make a token demonstration if we spend a few moments with Flaubert's L'éducation sentimentale (1869). It is a fact of literary history that Flaubert's agonies of composition led to excision. Traditional scholarship, impelled by exegesis within French, has reconstituted context. Admittedly, we have available plenitude of a sort, if we can in some attenuated way share Flaubert's "information." But we form for and within ourselves an affective plenitude by looking for the interliminal. This disciplined but partly intuitive examination restores plenitude: first, in recognizing the gap; second, in marking translation choices no longer justes, or third, in finding errors that have left a trace. Indeed, the obsolete and erroneous function as analogues to the parts of the text Flaubert discarded. The plenitude, in turn, displaces the subject - by which I mean the narrative consciousness, fairly subtle with Flaubert - making the text amenable to postmodern taste. For demonstrating what English univocality must contend with in French polysemy, Flaubert is a marvelous exemplar. His prose yields so much in monolingual readings that we adjust our expectations of a translation. We know that the sheer momentum of plot and characterization will sustain a translation. We cannot imagine that we shall miss too much if we lose the subtle word plays Translation Studies and Beyond where he uses "polysystem" only in a footnote quoting Itamar Even-Zohar (64). 3. For example, with a writer like Christine de Pisan (1364-1430) it would be truly unfair for traditionalists to call a postmodernist, Lacanian reading farfetched, since we cannot reconstruct a reliable 14th-century consensus. See Nicole Lehnsten (Christine de Pizan, CEMERS Proceedings, October 1995, ed. Marilynn Desmond, forthcoming). 4 . Mildred Larsen highlighted the importance of the bilingual reader in an address to the American Translators Association in 1984. JoAnne Englebert introduced the term "stereoscopic" at the 1987 ATA meeting.</page><page sequence="3">Flaubert 87 provided by polysemy. But when we plunge into the interliminal opened up by Robert Baldick's translation (1964), we are compelled to find a richer reading experience.5 The translation credits of Baldick (1927-1972) include Huysmans' A rebours, the Goncourt brothers' Journal, Villiers de l'Isle- Adam's Contes cruels, as well as Flaubert's Trois contes. In the first chapter on the boat trip home, Frédéric sees among the passengers Madame Arnoux who will crystallize the Madonna of his love life. After he has seen her, the narrative camera turns to what he sees: Une plaine s'étendait à droite ; à gauche un herbage allait doucement rejoindre une colline, où Ton apercevait des vignobles, des noyers, un moulin dans la verdure, et des petits chemins au delà, formant des zigzags sur la roche blanche qui touchait au bord du ciel. Quel bonheur de monter côte à côte, le bras autour de sa taille, pendant que sa robe balayerait les feuilles jaunies, en écoutant sa voix, sous le rayonnement de ses yeux ! Le bateau pouvait s'arrêter, ils n'avaient qu'à descendre; et cette chose bien simple n'était pas plus facile, cependant, que de remuer le soleil ! (9) A plain stretched away to the right; on the left a meadow sloped gently up to a hill, on which vineyards and walnut-trees could be distinguished, with a mill in the midst of the greenery. Further up, paths zigzagged across the white rock which seemed to touch the sky. What bliss it would be to climb up there beside her with his arm around her waist, listening to her voice and basking in the radiance of her eyes while her dress swept the yellow leaves along the ground! The boat could stop, and they had only to disembark; it was all so simple, yet budging the sun would have been an easier proposition. (20-21) The landscape is substantially the same: Une plaine s'étendait à droite ; à gauche un herbage allait doucement rejoindre une colline, où l'on apercevait des vignobles, des noyers, un moulin dans la verdure, et des petits chemins au delà, formant des zigzags sur la roche blanche qui touchait au bord du ciel. A plain stretched away to the right; on the left a meadow sloped gently up to a hill, on which vineyards and walnut-trees could be distinguished, with a mill in the midst of the greenery. Further up, paths zigzagged across the white rock which seemed to touch the sky. Yet the camera movement is somewhat modified because Flaubert with "l'on" keeps an agent who perceives, i.e., Frédéric himself. He sees the green of the 5. All Flaubert citations are from P. M. Wetherill's edition for Classiques Gamier (1984). All Baldick citations are from the Penguin edition (1964).</page><page sequence="4">88 Marilyn Gaddis Rose field (it is September IS) going towards a hill, and once he is focussed on the hill, he sees the signs of rural life and from there a natural monument. From Frederic's distance, man-made paths have wrapped and tied the boulder. Baldick is accurate but initially more neutral, introducing this sight with the passive "could be distinguished." However, he hints at a viewing agent when he closes with "seemed to touch the sky." What the juxtaposition does is show us what Frédéric saw (Flaubert) and what someone trying to see things from Frederic's angle saw (Baldick). The nature of English imposes removal of any anthropomorphism, i.e., no male grassy patch (un herbage) going to join again (rejoindre) a female hillock (une colline), no pre-Freudian mill (un moulin) surrounded by bushy greenery (la verdure), counterpointed by a boulder (la roche) touching the boundary of the sky (le ciel). The fact remains that the combination of an agent (l'on) with the covert sexuality of French grammatical gender provides the reader a transition to the indirect discourse of the next sentence. An English reader has to make an inference: Quel bonheur de monter côte à côte, le bras autour de sa taille, pendant que sa robe balayerait les feuilles jaunies, en écoutant sa voix, sous le rayonnement de ses yeux ! Le bateau pouvait s'arrêter, ils n'avaient qu'à descendre ; et cette chose bien simple n'était pas plus facile, cependant, que de remuer le soleil ! What bliss it would be to climb up there beside her with his arm around her waist, listening to her voice and basking in the radiance of her eyes while her dress swept the yellow leaves along the ground! The boat could stop, and they had only to disembark; it was all so simple, yet budging the sun would have been an easier proposition. Baldick uses about eight more words to both expand and compensate. He moves the conditional to the main clause of a complete sentence. He moves the exclamation mark since he is splitting the sentence. His expansion follows Flaubert's lead, so that each description of a couple walking could be read as an amorous embrace. We might wonder why Baldick was not content to say "yet it would have been easier to move the sun." Although it is difficult to imagine Frédéric leading a useful life anywhere, Paris does seem to elicit especially irresistible self-indulgent impulses. After an orgiastic masked ball in the first chapter of Part II his dream consciousness brings together prophetically (after all, this is a novel) images of the women who act on his senses: Une autre soif lui était venue, celle des femmes, du luxe et de tout ce que comporte l'existence parisienne. Il se sentait quelque peu étourdi, comme un homme qui descend d'un vaisseau ; et, dans l'hallucination du premier sommeil, il voyait passer et repasser continuellement les épaules de la Poissarde, les reins de la Débardeuse, les mollets de la Polonaise, la chevelure de la Sauvagesse. Puis deux grands yeux noirs, qui n'étaient pas dans le</page><page sequence="5">Flaubert 89 bal, parurent ; et légers comme des papillons, ardents comme des torches, ils allaient, venaient, vibraient, montaient dans la corniche, descendaient jusqu'à sa bouche. Frédéric s'acharnait à reconnaître ces yeux sans y parvenir. Mais déjà le rêve l'avait pris ; il lui semblait qu'il était attelé près d'Arnoux, au timon d'un fiacre, et que la Maréchale, à califourchon sur lui, l'éventrait avec ses éperons d'or. (128-29) Another thirst had come upon him: the thirst for women, for luxury, for everything life in Paris implies. He felt slightly dazed, like a man disembarking from a ship; and in the hallucination of his first sleep he saw passing to and fro before him the Fishwife's shoulders, the Stevedore's back, the Polish girl's calves, and the Savage Woman's hair. Then two big dark eyes, which were not at the ball, appeared; and, light as butterflies, bright as torches, they darted here and there, quivered, new up to the ceiling, then swooped down to his lips. Frédéric struggled to recognize these eyes without success. But already a dream had taken hold of him; he thought he was harnessed side by side with Arnoux in the shafts of a cab, and the Marshal, sitting astride him, was tearing his belly open with her golden spurs. (133-34) Although the comparable effects overall may vary when read out of context (which situates the women wearing these costumes), this is close to flawless. It adds to the surface movement: allaient, venaient becomes "darted here and there11; descendait jusqu'à becomes "swooped down to"; vibraient adds the notion of "quivered"; Véventrait is unpacked as "tearing his belly open." As Part II comes to a close, Frédéric believes he can profit from Madame Arnoux's exasperation with her husband's infidelities. She was in the prime of what the French call a woman's second youth: D'ailleurs, elle touchait au mois d'août des femmes, époque tout à la fois de réflexion et de tendresse, où la maturité qui commence colore le regard d'une flamme plus profonde, quand la force du cœur se mêle à l'expérience de la vie, et que, sur la fin de ses épanouissements, l'être complet déborde de richesses dans l'harmonie de sa beauté. (273) Besides, she was approaching the August of a woman's life, a period which combined reflection and tenderness, when the maturity which is beginning kindles a warmer flame in the eyes, when strength of heart mingles with experience of life, and when, in the fullness of its development, the whole being overflows with a wealth of harmony and beauty. (272) This is another typical instance of Baldick's adroit rearranging, i.e., strengthening the opening metaphor by omission of "the month of1; expanding an appositional phrase into a clause. Gender gives him some trouble. The "whole being" (l'être complet) is masculine, but Madame Arnoux is the person being discussed - it is not a question of the August of a man's life. This means</page><page sequence="6">90 Marilyn Gaddis Rose that ses épanouissements- clearly referring to women in their second youth with Madame Arnoux as their exemplar - when rendered as "its development" has the English reader referring back to "life" (or possibly "experience," "heart" or "strength"), not, however, to Madame Arnoux. Perhaps a little more interpretation would have helped, e.g., "when nearing the end of her blooming, a woman's whole being overflows with gifts of harmonious beauty." However, in Flaubert's interlacing of the political and the social, Louis- Philippe's abdication coincides with her son's sore throat complications. This conjunction makes their assignation inconceiveable in retrospect. (Nor could we have foreseen the degree of coincidence that lets Frédéric begin his liaison with her husband's official mistress Rosanette during the same 24-hour period.) Flaubert's language is so spare in the one instance where he arouses readers' unforced compassion that Baldick achieves a nearly semantically isomorphic translation and an equally moving passage. This is at the close of the second chapter of Part III where Louise Roque, the young heiress of his home town, discovers that she was at most a nearby diversion. She and her maid go through the 1848 barricades to his apartment: Enfin, elles arrivèrent chez Frédéric. Louise tira la sonnette avec vigueur, plusieurs fois. La porte s'entre-bâilla et le concierge répondit à sa demande : - « Non ! » - « Mais il doit être couché ? » - «Je vous dis que non ! Voilà près de trois mois qu'il ne couche pas chez lui ! » Et le petit carreau de la loge retomba nettement comme une guillotine. Elles restaient dans l'obscurité, sous la voûte. Une voix furieuse leur cria : - « Sortez donc ! » La porte se rouvrit ; elles sortirent. Louise fut obligée de s'asseoir sur une borne ; et elle pleura, la tête dans ses mains, abondamment, de tout son cœur. Le jour se levait, des charrettes passaient. (354-55) At last they arrived at Frederic's house. Louise pulled the bell vigorously several times. The door opened a little way, and in response to her inquiry the concierge answered: "Noi" "But he must be in bed?" "I tell you, no! He hasn't slept at home for nearly three months now!" And the little window of the lodge dropped into place like a guillotine. They stood there in the darkness, under the archway. A furious voice shouted at them: "Get out!" The door opened again; they went out. Louise was obliged to sit down on a gate-stone; and with her head in her hands, she wept copiously, from the bottom of her heart. Day was breaking; some carts went by. (349)</page><page sequence="7">Flaubert 91 Part IQ, another authorial tour de force, balances and weaves together the collapse of the Second Republic, the death of Frédéric and Rosanette's little boy, the embittering ending of his engagement to a wealthy widow, Louise's marriage to his "best friend" Deslauriers, and the bayonetting of one of his friends by another. In the penultimate chapter, sixteen years later (veritably the time of Flaubert's writing the novel), Madame Arnoux visits him. Afraid that she has come to make up for the rendezvous missed the day of Louis-Philippe's abdication, Frédéric rolls a cigarette. As she gets up to leave, she gives him a maternal blessing: Et elle le baisa au front comme une mère. Mais elle parut chercher quelque chose, et lui demanda des ciseaux. Elle défit son peigne ; tous ses cheveux blancs tombèrent. Elle s'en coupa, brutalement, à la racine, une longue mèche. - « Gardez-les ! adieu ! » Quand elle fut sortie, Frédéric ouvrit sa fenêtre, Madame Arnoux, sur le trottoir, fit signe d'avancer à un fiacre qui passait. Elle monta dedans. La voiture disparut. Et ce fut tout. (424) And she kissed him on the forehead like a mother. At this point Baldick does some discreet rewriting: But she seemed to be looking for something, and finally [adverb inserted] she asked him for some scissors. She took out her comb, and all her white hair fell over her shoulders [prepositional phrase added]. Baldick tones down the reader's shock at her self-immolating gesture (and removes pre-Freudian overtones). Instead of "She cut some off [the reflexive makes action harsher], brutally, at the root, a long lock": With an abrupt gesture [action classified] she cut off a long lock close to her head. "Keep it. Good-bye!" When she had gone out, Frédéric opened his window. On the pavement Madame Arnoux beckoned to a passing cab. She got in. The carriage disappeared. And that was all. (415-16) The novel, however, is not quite over. Frédéric and Deslauriers resume their friendship and, as well, the narrative we have just read: Et ils résumèrent leur vie. Ils l'avaient manquee tous les deux, celui qui avait rêvé l'amour, celui qui avait rêvé le pouvoir. Quelle en était la raison ? - « C'est peut-être le défaut de la ligne droite », a dit Frédéric.</page><page sequence="8">92 Marilyn Gaddis Rose - « Pour toi, cela se peut. Moi, au contraire, j'ai péché par excès de rectitude, sans tenir compte de mille choses secondaires, plus fortes que tout. J'avais trop de logique, et toi de sentiment ». Puis, ils accusèrent le hasard, les circonstnces, l'époque où ils étaient nés. (426-27) Baldick subtly interprets, toning down; after all, their lives were not tragic: And they looked back over their lives [instead of "summed up" which suggests not only the itemization which they have just completed but a passing judgment which they proceed to do]. They had both failed [more literally and accurately: "they had missed out on life"], one to realize his dreams of love, the other to fulfil his dreams of power. What was the reason? "Perhaps it's because we didn't steer a straight course," said Frédéric. "That may be true in your case. But I, on the contrary, was far too rigid in my line of conduct, and I failed to take into account a thousand-and-one minor factors which were really all-important. I was too logical, while you were too sentimental" [Baldick gives Deslauriers far more lexical fluency]. Then they blamed chance, circumstances, the times into which they were born. (417-18) This may be English interference, but "accusèrent" sounds stronger than "blamed." But every emendation of Baldick adds to authentic characterization. Flaubert ends the novel on this reminiscence, a truncated visit to the local brothel, subtly interpreted by the substitution of "happiest time" for de meilleur ("the best we had"): - « C'est là ce que nous avons eu de meilleur ! » dit Frédéric. - « Oui, peut-être bien ? c'est là ce que nous avons eu de meilleur ! » dit Deslauriers. (428) "That was the happiest time we ever had," said Frédéric. "Yes, perhaps you're right. That was the happiest time we ever had," said Deslauriers. (419) Baldick has matched Flaubert's mots justes. As bilingual readers we find deviations we would change. If his translation begins to sound silly - or a major change in publishing economics puts his translation into remaindering - then we shall probably see another translation. But for stereoscopic reading such glossing adds to L'éducation sentimentale. It can show us as readers the translation as a boundary to be disputed. In this instance accessing the interliminal brought a novel of 1869 to 1996. We might not have expected that a novel by Flaubert could slip from his control in a mere 127 years. It could even be claimed, although beyond the scope of this communication, that such stereoscopic reading prepares readers to indulge verbose authors like Sainte-Beuve and Sand who now sound eerily postmodern. Translation theory has spelled out for reading a</page><page sequence="9">Flaubert 93 mechanism for updating texts. No matter how dated a text in time and/or translation, our reading now only begins with the text as presented. With a translation - or by translating - we can elicit the interliminal and make it new. In any event our reading of literature can only gain with translation. State University of New York at Binghamton REFERENCES Budick, Sanford, and Wolfgang Iser, eds. 1996.
