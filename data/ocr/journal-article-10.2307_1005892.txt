C. The investigations in the Pyramid of the Sun reported on here resulted from a suggestion by Bruce Drewitt. In the spring of 1959, Drewitt, then a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, suggested that it might be profitable during the projected summer training program at Teotihuacan to examine the tunnel system in the Pyramid of the Sun for possible signs of interior structures of earth. With this and other objectives discussed in the text in mind, permission was obtained from the Mexican Government to examine the walls of the tunnel system and to make small-scale excavations, if desired. The subsequent investigations in the Pyramid tunnels, which form the basis of this report owe much to the energy, ability, and imagination of Drewitt, who spent a good part of the summer in the interior of the Pyramid, along with others mentioned below, who assisted him. In December, 1959, preliminary reports on various aspects of the summer training program were made at the annual meeting of the American Anthropological Association in Mexico City. Drewitt and the writer took this opportunity to return to the Pyramid of the Sun to make additional observations and to check on some of the data obtained during the summer. It proved possible to do very little because in the interim the walls of the tunnels had been concealed from view by retaining walls of stone and mortar, as ex- plained in the text. The principal result of this return to the Pyramid was a near disaster-the theft from the Los Angeles International Airport of the writer's suitcase, in which had been placed a folder containing a large part of the notes and almost all the drawings made during the summer's work in the Pyramid. Fortunately, a preliminary summary of the summer's work made in the fall of 1959 recorded much of the most important data, including a number of critical measurements. This, together with the remaining notes and a full photographic record, none of which was lost, have made possible the reconstruction of much of the lost evidence. In addition, most of the lost profile drawings of sections of the tunnel walls were laboriously reconstructed by Drewitt, using primarily the data provided by photographs, as described in Chapter II. These were subsequently gone over and finished in detail by the writer. As discussed in Chapter II, we are quite conscious of the severe limitations which these drawings possess (figs. 120-124); we publish them here only because the walling up of the visible areas in most of the tunnel system makes it unlikely that any re-study of these tunnels will be possible in the foreseeable future. In addition to the authors, others who participated in the Pyramid investigations during a major part of the time were Donald E. McVicker and John P. Sanchez. Edward Calnek, Patrick Hallinan, Alan L. McPherron, and Richard R. Randolph also worked for short periods in the tunnels. All made substantial contributions to our work in the Pyramid, and their assistance is acknowledged with gratitude. Josefa Haveman was the staff photographer and took most of the photographs of the interiors of the tunnels published here. Chapters I and VII were written by the writer; Chapters II and III represent the joint efforts of Drewitt and the writer; Chapters IV and V were written by Drewitt. Chapter VI was to have been written by James Bennyhoff and was to have included a study of the ceramics of Tzacualli phase Teotihuacan. When this proved impossible because of the pressure of other commitments, the writer prepared a draft of an abbreviated chapter, to which Drewitt appended comments on the radiocarbon dates for Tzacualli phase Teotihuacan. This draft was revised by Benny- hoff, who also prepared the captions for all the ceramic illustrations on the basis of his analyses of early Teotihuacan ceramics. The preparation of these illustrations was also supervised by Bennyhoff; he also selected the specimens to be illustrated and made the preliminary layouts for the illustrations. Chapters I-V were written in late 1960 in Berkeley and revised at the Behavioral Sciences Center in Stanford in 1963. Chapters II-V have undergone only minor changes since they were first written; no system- atic attempt has been made to incorporate evidence uncovered since. Chapter VI was written in December, 1963, in Rochester. Chapter VII was finished in Janu- ary, 1964, in Rochester from an earlier outline never formally finished, pending completion of the chronologi- cal evidence which it was intended to present in Chapter VI. When it became clear that for some time to come Chapter VI could not be prepared as originally planned, we then settled for an abbreviated version and the conclusions were written. Minor changes in the manuscript have been made subsequently up to the present. The ceramic illustrations were prepared by Peggy Muller, Zenon Pohorecky, and Freda de Castro. Mrs. de Castro painted figure 96b. Pohorecky prepared the illustrations in figures 105, 106,a, b; 107 g, i, 1, p; 109 a, g, h, k; 110 j, s-x; and figures 111-116. All others were prepared by Peggy Muller, Office of Medical 3</page><page sequence="4">4 MILLON, DREWITT, AND BENNYHOFF [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. Illustration, Stanford University. We thank all of them for their patience. The drawings in figures 118-124 were prepared in final form by Frank Vaccaro, Roch- ester Institute of Technology. Figure 117 is a section of the photogrammetric manuscript map of Teotihuacan prepared by Cia. Mexicana Aerofoto, S. A., Mexico City, and Hunting Mapping, Inc., Rochester, New York, for field use in the preparation of the detailed archaeological map of the ancient city now in the process of being made under the writer's direction. The first 92 illustrations (figs. 1-92) have been arranged to give the reader an impression of the Pyramid and its tunnel system in an orderly sequence. The reader first sees the Pyramid from the air from various positions, after which the western entrance to the tunnel system is shown and the reader is led into the tunnel system at this point, passes through its entire length from west to east and emerges from the upper tunnel on its eastern face (see fig. 118). There- after various views of the Pyramid are shown, prin- cipally of the Plataforma Adosada. The next 24 il- lustrations (figs. 93-116) are of objects from the tunnel system or of related material. Figures 117-124 are drawings of the Pyramid as a whole and of sections of the tunnel system. Figure 125 is a vertical aerial view of the Pyramid taken in 1962. We regret that in the preparation of this manuscript it was not possible for us to coinsult the unpublished study of the Pyramid of the Sun made by Remy Bastien (La Piramide del Sol en Teotihuacan: Tesis presentada en la Escuela Nacional de Antropologia e Historia, Biblioteca, Museo Nacional de Antropologia, Mexico, 1947). In addition to the financial support which the investigations reported here received from the Division of Scientific Personnel and Education of the National Science Foundation, the preparation of this report was aided by research grants from the National Science Foundation, the Committee on Research of the Uni- versity of California, Berkeley, and the College of Arts and Sciences of the University of Rochester. Our radiocarbon samples from the Pyramid (M-1283) and from Plaza 1, Oztoyahualco (M-1118) were run at the University Memorial-Phoenix Project Radio- carbon Laboratory at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, under the direction of H. R. Crane. Dr. James B. Griffin submitted these specimens for us, and we wish to thank him for this and for so graciously arrang- ing to have our Pyramid sample run without charge. Funds for the preparation of ceramic illustrations were provided by the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, in Stanford, California. We wish to thank Dr. Ignacio Bernal, Sub-Director of the Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia and Arql. Roman Pifia Ch'an of the Museo Nacional de Antropologia for the permits and letters which we needed to carry out our investigations and for their interest and cooperation during our stay. We are also grateful to Arqls. Jorge Acosta and Ponciano Salazar for providing us with information on I.N.A.H. investigations in the Pyramid subsequent to our own. We also wish to thank Arql. Florencia Muller and Robert E. Smith for information on the ceramics obtained in the recent I.N.A.H. excavations in the Pyramid and for their assistance and cooperation in discussing many problems with us. Carmen Cook de Leonard and Juan Leonard of the Centro de Investi- gaciones Antropologicas de Mexico placed their field facilities at our disposal in 1959 and otherwise were very helpful to us in a number of ways, for which we are very grateful. We also gratefully acknowledge the assistance of Dr. Eduardo Noguera in the resolution of a number of problems related to ceramic analysis and interpretation. We are greatly indebted to Jose Luis Franco for assistance rendered in so many diverse ways and for the long hours he spent talking with us about Teotihuac'an and related matters. Finally, the writer would like to express his thanks to Dr. Ralph Tyler and the staff of the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, Stanford, for providing the setting, time, facilities, and funds which made possible the completion of the manuscript. I also wish to thank my wife, Clara, for her assistance and counsel throughout the history of this manuscript. I have learned much and the manuscript has benefited immeasurably from her critical reading of it.

INTRODUCTION BACKGROUND At the time of the Spanish Conquest, Indian peoples of the Valley of Mexico attributed the building of the Pyramid of the Sun at Teotihuacan to giants (Sahagiun, 1961: pp. 191-192; 1956: 3: p. 209; (Bk. 10, Ch. 29)). This appealing account is an indication of the awe in which the Pyramid was held by aboriginal inhabitants of the Valley in the sixteenth century. Later investi- gators have continued to be awed by it. The great pyramid has been the subject of debate for many years. It is a structure of tremendous size that is thought to have been raised to its full height in a single building operation, suggesting the presence of a complex religious and political structure at Teotihuacan when it was built (figs. 1-7, 125). Yet it was thought to have been built during the earliest phase of occupation at Teotihuacan at a time when no structures of comparable size were being built anywhere else in Middle America or in the rest of the New World. For this and other reasons some archaeologists have argued that the civilization of Teotihuacan was imported and/or that the Pyramid could not have been built early in Teotihuacan's history. The man responsible for the present appearance of the Pyramid is Leopoldo Batres, whose expressed wonder at the structure (Batres, 1889: pp. 8-10) did not prevent him from attacking it with more vigor and enthusiasm than care. His work was carried out between 1905 and 1910 as part of President Porfirio Diaz's program for the commemoration of the centen- nial of the beginning of Mexico's struggle for independ- ence from Spain (Batres, 1906, 1908, 1913; Seler, 1915: pp. 419-424; Bastien, 1951). Following this reconstruction of the exterior of the Pyramid, a tunnel was excavated from the rear of the Pyramid to its center (figs. 117, 118). This was done in the course of Manuel Ganmio's monumental project for the study of the Valley of Teotihuacan which began in 1917. The tunnel appeared to demonstrate what Batres' excavations had suggested, namely that there were no major interior structures of stone within the Pyramid (Marquina in Gamio, 1922: 1: 1: pp. 132-134). It also revealed that the interior of the Pyramid contained pottery and figurines which pertained to an "Archaic," previously unrecognized phase of occupation at Teotihuac'an (Gamio, 1922: 1: 1: pp. 180-183, 184, 266, Lam. 100). These findings were supported by Kroeber (1925: pp. 390-394), who studied the pottery obtained from Gamio's tunnel in 1924 together with new material excavated from the tunnel for his analysis. Vaillant (1932: pp. 487-488) also made a small- scale excavation in the Gamio tunnel in the winter of 1931-1932. His preliminary report on the material he obtained from this excavation, while based on a fuller knowledge of the early ceramic remains found in the Valley of Mexico, agreed substantially with Kroeber's findings. As a result of these studies the problems posed by the great pyramid assumed a new magnitude and a second tunnel, this time running from west to east, was excavated under the direction of Eduardo Noguera in 1933 (fig. 118). The Noguera tunnel was specifi- cally designed to clarify the two principal problems which the earlier investigations had raised: (1) Was the Pyramid erected in a single building operation or did it contain interior structures of smaller size over which the final structure was built? (2) Did the 5</page><page sequence="6">6 MILLON, DREWITT, AND BENNYHOFF [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. ceramic and other material in the interior of the Pyramid pertain exclusively to the early "Archaic" phase of the occupation of Teotihuacan or were other later phases also represented? (Pe'rez, 1935: p. 91; Noguera, 1935: pp. 5-6). The excavation of the new tunnel further supported earlier conclusions that the Pyramid proper contained no major interior structures and that its ceramic and other remains were exclusively of the early phase of the occupation of Teotihuacian which Vaillant designated at first as "Archaic Teoti- huacAin" or Early Teotihuac'an and later as Teoti- huacan I (Perez, 1935: pp. 91-92; Noguera, 1935: pp. 3-90; Vaillant, 1932: pp. 488-49; 1935: p. 295; 1938: pp. 540-542). Despite the ceramic evidence Noguera did not con- clude that the Pyramid was built in the Teotihuac&amp;an I phase (1935: pp. 55, 64, 75, 77; but see also p. 57). Vaillant (1938: pp. 540-541, 561) agreed with Noguera in this, basing his conclusion on the fact that "no buildings nor undisturbed refuse beds of this time phase have been found in sitit, since the remains of this stage have been incorporated in later buildings" (1938: p. 541). Teotihuac{an I pottery had been found or recognized only in the interior of the Pyramid of the Sun, in the lower part of the deposits forming the large platform surrounding the Pyramid, in the interior of the Pyramid of the Moon, within the adobes forming a wall around the "precinct" of Group 5' (to the west of the M\oon Pyramid), and in fill in an excavation south of the local Teotihuac{an museum (Vaillant, 1932: p. 487; 1938: p. 541; Tolstoy, 1958: p. 57). Vaillant was arguing in effect that no occupation areas or i?n situ midden deposits of the Teotihuacan I phase had been found at Teotihuac{an and that no structures had been found which could be attributed to this phase with certainty since they contained Teoti- huacain I material only as redeposited fill. That is, no caches or burials of this phase had been found nor had any direct evidence been found within any building of its occupation by these people. Given the fact that no other structures of any size could be attributed to this early phase, this argument would run, how could the largest structure ever built at Teotihuacan be attributed to people who might never even have occupied Teotihuac{an intensively. Vaillant's conclusions were accepted or amplified by some archaeologists, disputed or qualified by others (see Millon, 1960, for details). The great size of the Pyramid, together with the fact that there seemed to be no definable zone of Teotihuacan I occupation in Teotihuacan, lent support to the views of Vaillant and Noguera. On the other hand, the fact that the tunnels in the Pyramid proper had not yielded any identifiable ceramic or other remains later than Teotihuacan I, argued that the Pyramid had been built in that phase (see Caso, 1953: p. 233). Work undertaken thereafter in the Pyramid and elsewhere in the city failed to clarify the question. Remy Bastien (1951) carried out a series of investi- gations from 1945 to 1947 both on the outer surfaces of the Pyramid and within it, including the excavation of a short north tunnel a little over nine meters long, at the east end of the lower or Noguera tunnel, where the latter is joined to the upper or Gamio tunnel by a staircase (fig. 118 (6)). But his published report on these investigations is not concerned with the age of the Pyramid. Recent discoveries in the Oztoyahualco zone, west and northwest of the Pyramid of the Moon, have clarified the problem in several respects (fig. 119). A 1miajor zone of Teotihuacan I or Tzacualli phase occupation, as it is now called (Armillas, 1950: p. 67), was found in Oztoyahualco. In addition to many surface remains of modest size in this zone, excavation revealed simple structures with earth floors, beneath which were found a number of undisturbed caches of pottery and other objects of the Tzacualli phase (Millon, 1957; 1960; Millon and Bennyhoff, 1961). Other excavations in the same area carried out by Carmiien Cook de Leonard and Juan Leonard disclosed the remains of wlhat appear to have been small ceremonial structures of the Tzacualli phase and perhaps a still earlier phase (Nicholson, 1959: p. 306; Stuiver, Deevey and Gralenski, 1960: p. 57; also Cook de Leonard, 1957: pp. 3-5; Noguera and Leonard, 1957: pp. 6-10). These discoveries served to answer Vail- lant's principal objection to accepting the evidence that the Pyramid was built in the Tzacualli (or Teotihuacan I) phase. Now that a major zone of occupation of this phase was known to exist at Teotihuaccan, this removed one of the reasons for doubting that the Pyramid was built so early. Still to bDe reckoned with was the fact of its enormous size. How could this huge structure have 1)een erected in a single building operation? Despite the fact that successive enlargements of earlier temples and their platforms are almost always founld in Middle America when an attempt is made to look for themii, those who had dug in the Pyramid had found no earlier structures within it. The tunnels in the Pyramid had in fact been made expressly for the purpose of uncovering such earlier structures, if they existed. None was found. Thlis had to be interpreted as signifying that there were no earlier stone-faced structures in the Pyramid. But did it mean that there were no earlier earthn mounds within it without stone facings ? A fairly sizal)le clay-surfaced earth mound was found at Cuicuilco in the southern valley of Mexico in 1957 (Heizer and Bennyhoff, 1957). The Great Pyramid at the early Olmec center of La Venta in Tabasco apparently was made entirely of earth and clay (Drucker, Heizer and Squier, 1959: pp. 119, 267; Heizer, 1960: p. 218). The same is true of the largest pyramid at Kaminal- juyu in the Valley of Guatemala (Shook and Kidder,</page><page sequence="7">VOL. 55, PT. 6, 1965] THE PYRAMID OF THE SUN AT TEOTIHUACAN 7 1952). Was it possible that a similar structure or structures of earth existed within the Pyramid of the Sun which had escaped notice in the darkness of the tunnels ? No drawings or photographs of the tunnel interiors had ever been published; the report on the excavation of the upper tunnel was extremely brief (Gamio, 1922: 1: 1: pp. 132-134) ; so was the report on the excavation of the lower tunnel (Noguera, 1935: pp. 5-6; Perez, 1935: pp. 91-92; see also Marquina 1951: p. 64). OBJECTIVES OF 1959 INVESTIGATIONS The possibility that interior structures of earth and clay might have been overlooked led us to ask for permission to work in the Pyramid tunnels in the summer of 1959. We were also interested in examining the nature of the fill used in constructing the Pyramid, since existing accounts did not make clear how ex- tensively and in what ways adobes were used (Batres, 1906: p. 20; Seler, 1915: p. 419; Gamio, 1922: 1: 1: p. 132; Kroeber, 1925: p. 391; Perez, 1935: p. 92; Noguera, 1935: p. 6; Vaillant, 1938: p. 541; Armillas, 1950: p. 43; Marquina, 1951: pp. 64, 69). Another of our objectives was to obtain a sample of the pottery from the Pyramid for use in making compari- sons between it and the pottery from the recently dis- covered zone of Tzacualli occupation in the Oztoya- hualco region of Teotihuacan. The results of our subsequent investigations form the basis of this report. PREVIOUS STUDIES OF CERAMIC CHRONOLOGY The relationships of pottery of the Tzacualli phase to other Preclassic Period ceramics on the one hand, and to pottery of later phases in the Teotihuacan se- quence on the other, has been a problem since the Tzacualli (or Teotihuacan I) phase was first isolated and recognized. While, as noted above, Tzacualli pottery and figurines were first excavated in significant number during the 1917 and later excavations of Gamio, only the figurines were studied at the time; apparently no attempt was made to analyze the pottery (Gamio, 1922: 1: 1: pp. 180-183, 184, 266, L'am. 89-94, 100). The first study of the pottery of this phase was made by Kroeber (1925: pp. 390-394, 406-407), who analyzed selected ceramics from the Gamio tunnel excavation, as well as sherds obtained from four small excavations made into the tunnel walls at his request. Kroeber was struck by the fact that while the figurine heads described and illustrated by Gamio were clearly of the "Archaic" (Preclassic) Period, the pottery differed markedly from that of Copilco, the Preclassic site beneath the lava beds in the southwestern part of the Valley of Mexico. Painted pottery fragments which constituted 10 per cent of the Copilco decorated sherds, comprised 90 per cent of the decorated pottery in the Pyramid collections. Three and four colors were found on a number of specimens; such decoration was rare in Copilco pottery. In addition, Kroeber commented that the base color on most painted frag- ments was "yellowish brown" which was rare at Copilco. (The base color on most Tzacualli painted pottery is quite distinctive and, if well preserved, often serves to identify a specimen in itself in the absence of other decoration.) Kroeber concluded that the pottery from the Pyramid was later than the pottery from Copilco because of its connections with the style of Teotihuac'an, adding that figurines reinforced the case for relative continuity of the "Pyramid Archaic" (Tzacualli) and Teotihuacan periods. He was also of the opinion that the uniformity of ceramic refuse from the Pyramid indicated that it "was erected, if not at one time, at least in one period." Nevertheless, he believed that the Pyramid was built after the Tzacualli phase, when the remains of this phase "already lay waste in the soil" and that these deposits were "erected into the core of the Pyramid in Teotihuac{an times" (Kroeber, 1925: pp. 392, 390-391). Kroeber, like Gamio before him, stressed the evi- dence for continuity between the great periods at Teotihuac'an and the "Pyramid Archaic," but unlike Gamio (1922: 1: 1: p. 181) carefully evaded the problem of intrusive peoples or influences contributing to the florescence of Teotihuacan following the Tzacualli phase. He states: All important Archaic traits, ceramic or otherwise, are found in equally or more developed form in the Teotihuac&amp;in civilization in which the Archaic appears to have dissolved. This circumstance of course does not preclude the abrupt or gradual appearance of new traits in the Teotihuac6in culture (Kroeber, 1925: pp. 406-407). Noguera's study of the pottery and other artifacts from the excavation of the lower tunnel is the standard report on the Tzacualli phase at Teotihuac'an (Noguera, 1935). He distinguished six types of bichrome and polychrome pottery in the material excavated in the Pyramid: Red-on-Yellow, White-and-Red-on-Yellow, Black- and - Red-on-Yellow, White - Black- and- Red -on Yellow, White-on-Red and Red-on-Brown. His de- scriptions are amplifications of Kroeber's, with one significant exception. He noted that most, if not all, of the black color on the Pyramid sherds represented "negative" or resist decoration. This type of decoration has since come to be a diagnostic of the Tzacualli phase. Noguera's study also demonstrated that bi- chrome and polychrome pottery fragments vastly out- number sherds bearing incised, modeled, applique, carved and allied designs (97 per cent to 3 per cent), thus confirming Kroeber's observation. Moreover, bichrome and polychrome sherds formed 11 per cent of all pottery fragments (decorated and undecorated) found within the Pyramid proper, an exceptionally high percentage. Nevertheless, monochrome pottery</page><page sequence="8">8 MILLON, DREWITT, AND BENNYHOFF [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. formed the major proportion of all decorated sherds, polished black and polished brown being the most numerous (ca. 19 per cent of all sherds found) Noguera, 1935: pp. 93-94). Noguera's study also demonstrated that the platform structure built against the western face of the Pyramid (figs. 2-4, 7, 117, 118, 125) was built later than the Tzacualli phase (Noguera, 1935: pp. 53, 57; Perez, 1935: pp. 91-92). According to standard ideas on Teotihuacan chronology developed since Noguera's study, this structure, known as the Plataforma Adosada, was built in the Miccaotli phase (Teotihuacan II). We shall have much to say about it in succeeding pages. Human figurines from the Pyramid were classified by Noguera into seven types, excluding more recent ones from the Plataforma Adosada. A predominant characteristic of all of them is an exaggerated prog- nathism, which gives many of them an animal-like facial appearance. All of them are made by hand, rather than in molds as are many of the later Teoti- huac'an figurines. Facial characteristics are crudely and minimally represented, but headdresses are often elaborate (figs. 97-104). Armillas (1944: p. 126) combined Noguera's seven types into two large groups. In the first of these, features are made by rough in- cising; in the second, they are made with applique. These figurines were first analyzed by Gamio (1922: 1: 1: pp. 180-181; L'am. 89-92, 94) and are different from other recognized types from the Valley of Mexico. Some of them more closely resemble Vaillant's Type E-2 than any other (Vaillant, 1931: pp. 338-339; 1935: pp. 302-303; 1938: fig. 10; 1944: pl. 13: 7; Vaillant and Vaillant, 1934: p. 120; Tolstoy 1958: p. 65; Porter 1956: p. 573).1 TEOTIHUACAN ORIGINS The problem of the beginnings of Teotihuacan has occupied the attention of a number of investigators who have worked at Teotihuac'an or on material related to it. The problem may perhaps be stated best in the following fashion: Was the flowering of Teotihuacan an essentially indigenous development or did it stem largely from the migration of a new people to Teotihuacan ? Or, in other terms, was the Teoti- huacan "great tradition" an internal development or was it imported? (Millon and Drewitt, 1961.) Noguera devoted considerable space to a study of the relationships of the material from the Tzacualli phase to material from other phases in the Valley of Mexico and elsewhere (Noguera, 1935: pp. 57-81). He con- cluded that the people who made the Tzacualli remains came from West Mexico at a time when the "Archaic" (Late Preclassic period) peoples of the Valley had begun to experience a cultural decline. There was an inter- change between the two peoples, but the postulated 1 Noguera's later classification of Teotihuacan figurines ap- peared after this was written (1962). new arrivals borrowed from their neighbors only simple traditions of minor importance. Noguera also felt that these putative newcomers at the very least in- fluenced the great civilization of Teotihuac'an, even though he did not feel able to say, on the evidence available, whether or not they had brought it into being (Noguera, 1935: pp. 75, 77). He commented briefly on the possibility that the developing civiliza- tion of Teotihuacan was also influenced by traditions from the "Atlantic coast and Southern Mexico," adding that the reverse might be true, namely that it was Teotihuac'an which had influenced the "Gulf Coast" (Noguera, 1935: p. 81). While the burden of Noguera's argument is devoted to demonstrating the relationship between the Tzacualli phase at Teoti- huacan and certain archaeological remains in West Mexico, he admitted the two might represent branches of a "common trunk" (Noguera, 1935: p. 78). Vail- lant (1938: pp. 541-542) agreed in general with Noguera's conclusion that West Mexican influence is evident in the materials of the Tzacualli phase: The western Mexican influence is reinforced by the pres- ence of many shells from the Pacific, as well as by the use of negative painting and figurine types suggesting that source. While to the writer, there is still the possibility that the western Mexico culture may have been influenced by an earlier Cuicuilco-Ticoman effusion, nonetheless, Mr. Noguera's belief that a west Mexican complex is present in Early Teotihuac'an, is amply supported by the evidence . More recent ideas on Teotihuacan beginnings lay less stress than did Noguera and Vaillant on the matter of the relationship of Tzacualli remains with those found in West Mexico. The problem of the origins of the Tzacualli tradition is still with us, and we shall have something to say about it below, but there is less disposition today to postulate migrations from the west than when Noguera wrote (Porter, 1956: pp. 571-572; Jimenez-Moreno, 1959: pp. 1046, 1051-1052). Receiving more attention in the past few years has been the question of the relationship of the people who left the Tzacualli remains to the later builders of the great city of Teotihuacan. Covarrubias (1957: pp. 125-126, 133-137) contended that the major ele- ments of what we have called the Teotihuac'an "great tradition" were imported following the Tzacualli phase, by a hypothetical foreign elite which he derives at one point from "the east, the gulf coast" and at another "perhaps. . . from the east and south . . . the gulf coast." Gamio (1922: 1: 1: p. 181) previously argued from a similar position, whereas Kroeber (1925: pp. 406-407) preferred to leave the matter open. Linne (1942: pp. 182-183) took a more extreme position, suggesting that the inhabitants of Teotihuacian during the Tzacualli phase were later displaced by a new people who were the builders of Teotihuacian civilization. Covarrubias also argued that the first phase of the occupation of Teotihuac'an (Teotihuac'an I)</page><page sequence="9">VOL. 55, PT. 6, 1965] THE PYRAMID OF THE SUN AT TEOTIHUACAN 9 represents an interaction between "two different cultures, one, that of the common people. . . the other, that of an incipient elite," an incipient elite with Olmecoid affiliations (Covarrubias, 1957: p. 136). Others have held that the origins of florescent Teotihuac'an are to be found in central Veracruz, at the site of Remojadas (Medellin Zenil, 1953: pp. 371-376; 1955: pp. 102-104; Garcia Payon, 1953: pp. 385-387). This argument rests on the relationship of Remojadas to Teotihuac'an throughout much of its history, a relationship which is said to be strongest during the Upper Remojadas I phase at Remojadas and the Miccaotli phase at Teotihuac'an. While a relationship between the two does exist, its nature and extent are not clear, since no adequate report on Remojadas has been published as yet. The existence of a relationship between the art style of Teotihuactan and the art style of the site of El Tajin in Veracruz, or, more precisely, between the Teotihuacan style and the "scroll style" of central Veracruz has also been pointed out by many. It is usually assumed that the style was brought to Teotihuacan from the Gulf Coast but the reverse has also been argued (Caso, 1953: p. 234; Covarrubias, 1957: pp. 125-126, 133-134, 139; Jimenez-Moreno, 1959: 1060; Kelly and Palerm, 1952: p. 15; Krickeberg, 1956: pp. 379, 409; Proskouriakoff, 1953: p. 392). Torquemada records that the Totonac, most of whom now live in Veracruz, claimed that in the course of their wanderings, before settling down in Veracruz, they had lived for a time at Teotihuacian and that while there they had built the Pyramids of the Sun and Moon (1943-44: 1: p. 278); this has been cited by many investigators, frequently in conjunction with a discussion of the "scroll style" (see, for example, Covarrubias, 1957: pp. 125-126, 133-134, 139; Gamio, 1922, 1: 1: p. 293-295; Jimenez-Moreno, 1942; Krickeberg, 1956: pp. 379, 409). While we shall not be directly concerned with these problems here, we shall return to them in Chapter VII in discussing certain questions relating to the origin of the Teoti- huacan "great tradition." PROBLEMS IN CERAMIC CHRONOLOGY Another matter with which we shall be concerned here is whether the distinctive bichrome and polychrome "negative" or resist pottery wares of early Teotihuacan represent a single phase of occupation or several. The first indication that the Tzacualli phase might not be the earliest phase in this pottery tradition in the Valley of Mexico came from Noguera's excavation at the site of El Tepalcate, a low, flat peninsula on the eastern shore of Lake Texcoco, north of the town of Chimalhuacan, in the eastern part of the Valley of Mexico (Noguera, 1943). Analysis of the pottery from this site revealed close correspondences with the pottery from the Pyramid of the Sun, including the presence of bichrome and polychrome resist wares. Human figurine fragments also resembled some of the distinctive fig- urines from the Pyramid. There were also important differences between the two ceramic assemblages. Noguera especially singled out the presence of vessel supports at El Tepalcate because these had been extremely rare in the material from the Pyramid. Because these supports most closely resembled vessel supports found in the third and final phase at the village site of Ticoman on the western shore of Lake Texcoco, Noguera concluded that the two were con- temporaneous. He further concluded that the El Tepalcate remains and those from the Pyramid of the Sun were contemporaneous, despite the presence of differences between the two. Armillas (1950: pp. 60, 67), on the other hand, believed that the differences between the El Tepalcate and Pyramid remains were sufficiently great to indicate that El Tepalcate rep- resents a transition between Ticoman III and the Tzacualli phase at Teotihuacan. While he admitted the possibility that these differences were spatial (i. e., local variations), he concluded that it was a time difference that was involved and that the El Tepalcate remains were earlier than those found in the Pyramid. He named this new phase Chimalhuacain, after the modern town near the site.2 We agree that the evidence available indicates that the material from the Pyramid and from El Tepalcate represent different phases in the early Teotihuacan tradition, and that the Chimal- huacan phase appears to be earlier than the Tzacualli phase. Following William T. Sanders' lead we use the term Patlachique to refer to material of the Chimal- huacan phase that is found in the Valley of Teoti- huacan (see Chapter VI). (We also believe that we have evidence suggesting that the Tzacualli phase should be divided into several sub-phases.) In the chapter on chronology we shall briefly discuss two other phases in the Valley of Teotihuac'an which have not been previously distinguished. Another ceramic complex from the southern part of the Valley of Teotihuac'an appears to be related to the later polychrome and resist-decorated tradition of the Tza- cualli phase. Pottery of this complex was found by Bennyhoff and Millon in 1957 on top of Cerro Tezoyuca el Grande, at the foot of the Valley of Teotihuac'an, between the towns of Cuanalan and Tezoyuca. Because this pottery was so distinctive we considered it to 2 In the discussion on Teotihuacan origins, Covarrubias' views on the interaction of two groups of people in the Teotihuacan I phase were mentioned. We may now add to this statement that Covarrubias named these two groups Chimalhuacan ("the common people") and Tzacualli ("the incipient elite"). Covar- rubias accepts Armillas' placement of Chimalhuacan as earlier than Tzacualli and describes the two of them as sub-phases of Teotihuacan I (Covarrubias, 1957: pp. 127, 136). While he is not explicit on this point, he is evidently arguing that his Tzacualli sub-phase involved the incorporation of Chimalhuacan sub-phase elements and the addition of new elements, some of them Olmecoid, developed by his apparently foreign "incipient elite."</page><page sequence="10">10 MILLON, DREWITT, AND BENNYHOFF [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. represent a separate phase which we called "Tezoyuca." 3 Its painted varieties somewhat resemble painted va- rieties of the Ticoman III phase, the final phase at Ticoman. Resemblances also exist to the pottery of a phase at Cuanalan in the southern Valley of Teoti- huacan. The latter pottery shows close relationships with Ticoman III, closer than those of Tezoyuca with Ticoman. In addition, this pottery from Cuanalan, Ticomnan III pottery and pottery from Cerro del Tepalcate (in the western Valley of Mexico, near Tlatilco) are roughly linked to each other in time by the connections of eaclh with early Chupicuaro in Guanajuato (Porter 1956: pp. 571-572). The Tezoyuca phase seems to be later than the Ticoman III related pottery of Cuanalan and may rep- resent an intermediate phase between this phase and the Patlachique phase (for earlier comments on Tezo- yuca and Cuanalan see Millon, 1957: pp. 16-17; 1960: p. 8). As will be seen, we believe that the ceramic evi- dence summarized in Chapter VI in preliminary form reinforces the evidence for continuity between the Tzacualli and Miccaotli phases and indicates that the ceramic antecedents of the Tzacualli phase are to be found in the Valley of Teotihuac'an rather than else- where (Millon, 1960: pp. 5-6). The possible bearing of this evidence on the developmental history of Teoti- huac'an will be commented on in the final chapter. INVESTIGATIONS OF 1959 Our 1959 investigations of the Pyramid were quite limited in nature and scope. Nevertheless, they proved to he productive beyond our expectations. Despite the fact that previous work in the tunnels had apparently established that there were no earlier structures of stone within the Pyramid, we found such a structure in the Noguera tunnel, about 55 m. from its western entrance (figs. 118, 30-41). The structure found had a core of earth but was faced on its western side with stone cobbles. It seems to have been modest in size, partic- uarly when compared with the imimense bulk of the Pyramid which overlies it. This was not the only evidence of interior structures we noted in the course of our investigations. At several places near the entrances to each of the tunnels, that is, at opposite ends of the Pyramid, we found the remains of what appear to have been quite minor structures (fig. 118). Near the center of the Pyramid are the remains of what may be a major structure, perhaps a tomb of immense proportions (figs. 118, 123). We noted that adobes were used as construction material near the entrance to the two tunnels, that is, near the present outer surface of the eastern and western faces of the Pyramid. Elsewhere in the tun- nels the use of adobes is sporadic. We feel that their 3 Excavations at the Tezoyuca site by Michael West in 1962 have confirmed its distinctiveness. presence near the surface on two sides of the Pyramid may possibly represent the core or backing of the outer face of a structure built before the present facing of the Pyramid and covered by it. The adobes in the upper or Gamio tunnel end 3.5 meters west of the upper tunnel entrance (figs. 118, 82, 83). In the area between the adobes and the eastern entrance to the Pyramid fill lines are visible, sloping steeply down from west to east (fig. 124). The present stone surface of the Pyramid rests against the outer- most of these fill lines. At the other end of the tunnel system, near the front or western face, stone fill of the Plataforma Adosada rests directly oln courses of adobes. That is, there is no intervening fill nor is there an existing outer stone surface of the Pyramid against wlhich it rests (figs. 118, 120). Since the slope of the Pyramid proper at its juncture with the Adosada does not correspond to the slope of the exterior face of the Pyramid on either side of the Adosada, it is possible that a portion of the exterior face of the Pyramid was removed at this point and the Adosada set into it. This might account for the absence of fill corresponding to the fill which rests against the adobes on the eastern face. There is then a possibility that the adobe courses at both ends of the tunnel system represent the core or backing for a facing built before the present facing of the Pyramid. If suclh an earlier facing existed, the structure it faced would have been a monumental structure, only very little smaller than the present Pyramid. Whether such a structure actually exists we cannot say, on the basis of our limited investigations within the narrow confines of the tunnels.4 But discussions of the evi- dence for it will be found in Chapters III and V. Another discovery of interest was a remarkable obsidian figurine offering found behind the facing of the stone covered structure previously mentioned. The figurine was erect and was surrounded by close to 40 miniature obsidian projectile points whose average length was 1 cm. (figs. 38-41, 93). The figurine seems to represent a Tzacualli phase prototype of later obsidian figurines of the Miccaotli and subsequent phases at Teotihuacan. The stone-faced structure and its associated offering are discussed at length in Chapter IV. Our investigations also indicate that the Plataforma Adosada was built in several stages and may once have been a small structure in front of and completely separate from the Pyramid. The Adosada, as well as its juncture with the Pyramid proper, are discussed separately in Chapter V. Also of some interest is a "Tlaloc" effigy vessel found in the Adosada (fig. 95). Its description and possible significance will be foulnd 4 Subsequent work on the north face of the Pyramid carried out by Arqlgo.

Descriptions of structures in the Pyramid interior not discussed elsewhere will be found in Chapter III. Our findings concerning the building materials used in the construction of the Pyramid itself will be found in the same chapter. As will be seen, our findings for the most part supplement rather than contradict the conclusions of earlier investigators. Their principal significance lies in the fact that they provide us with an enlarged and somewhat enriched conception of the nature of the Pyramid and of its antecedents. They also raise certain questions concerning possible structures of great size within the Pyramid which can be settled only by further excavations on a large scale. In addition. the ceramics found within the Pyramid and the Adosada, together with related materials elsewhere, have made possible new formulations concerning the early chronol- ogy of Teotihuacian. As a result of this and other evidence we are able to draw certain conclusions of a tentative nature in our final chapter concerning the formative period of Teotihuacan civilization and the beginnings of its "great tradition." II. THE TUNNEL SYSTEM AND HOW IT WAS EXAMINED In this and the succeeding chapter we present a description of the interior of the Pyramid. We begin with a general account of the tunnel system in the Pyramid and comment on both the possibilities it pre- sents to the investigator and on the limitations which it imposes on investigation. We then discuss our reasons for concentrating our work on particular sec- tions of the tunnel system and the nature and scope of our investigations in 1959. Also included is a discus- sion of the methods and procedures used in our work. Following this we take the reader on a tour of the Pyramid interior, describing the salient features visible on a survey from west to east (Chapter III). We then discuss other general features found in the tunnel walls. Finally, we present our conclusions concerning the nature of the interior of the Pyramid and discuss certain implications of our evidence. NATURE OF THE TUNNELS As mentioned in Chapter I, the earliest tunnel to be dug in the Pyramid (fig. 118, Upper Tunnel) was made under the direction of Manuel Gamio during his 1917 and subsequent excavations at Teotihuacan. The Gamio tunnel penetrated the rear or eastern face of the first stage of the Pyramid, above ground level (figs. 85, 86). It extended horizontally (with a gentle up- ward slope) from the approximate mid-line of the eastern face to a point near the center of the Pyramid, a distance of about 100 meters (fig. 118, Upper Tun- nel). It is now connected by a flight of stairs to the lower tunnel dug in 1933 under the direction of Eduardo Noguera.1 This second tunnel (fig. 118, Lower Tun- nel) is 6 meters lower than the Gamio tunnel and extends at ground level from the mid-line of the west face or front of the Pyramid, penetrating first the Plataforma Adosada, then the Pyramid itself, in an easterly direction to the base of the stairs mentioned above. The orientation of the two tunnels is approxi- mately the same but the lower tunnel is offset about 2 meters to the north of the upper tunnel. The over-all length of the resulting passage, including the connecting stairs, is somewhat less than 218 meters. Both tunnels are now covered with a vaulted concrete roof resting on lintels running along the top of the tunnel walls and supported by concrete pillars (figs. 10, 79). The pillars are 1.6 meters high and 20 centimeters wide. They are placed uniformly throughout the tunnels at intervals that are normally 1.4 meters in width. In the bays between these pillars, the fill form- ing the hearting of the Pyramid is visible, except in areas where collapses of the original fill have made it necessary to shore up with rock all or part of the area between the weakened supports on one or both walls of the tunnel (figs. 44, 84). As we shall see, con- siderable sections of the upper and lower tunnels have been walled up in this fashion, completely concealing the deposits behind them from view. This, of course, greatly limited our ability to interpret the evidence found in open bays, as will become apparent farther along. At the time of our investigations about one- third of the bays in both tunnels were completely walled up on both sides of the tunnel. An additional 25 per cent are walled up on one side or the other so that less than half of the bays in the lower and upper tunnels are completely open for inspection on both their north- ern and southern sides (see fig. 118, Plan View). Since our investigations all bays in both tunnels were completely walled up. A walk through the tunnels now reveals virtually nothing. In cross section the upper tunnel is 1 meter wide. The vaulted roof is 2 meters above the floor at its apex and 1.8 at the lintels. The cross section of the lower tunnel had about the same vertical dimensions but is slightly wider (1.2 meters). However, since the concrete roof and supports were constructed, collapses of fill between pillars, particularly in the lower tunnel, have built up the tunnel floor 10 to 20 cm. in some areas. This addition to the floor has not appreciably limited the amount of fill visible in each bay nor has it limited access within the tunnels to any serious extent. It did present certain hazards to some of the taller members of our staff, however, who had to learn to proceed cautiously in the lower tunnel to avoid frequent collisions with the concrete roof. For this and other reasons safety hats were prescribed for those working in the tunnels regularly (fig. 10). 1 Marquina's account suggests that the two tunnels were for a time connected only by a ramp (1951: p. 64).</page><page sequence="12">12 MILLON, DREWITT, AND BENNYHOFF [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. The upper and lower tunnels thus provide two east- west cross sections, a little over a meter apart which are roughly 1.6 meters high and more than 215 meters long. For relatively small features or structures eni- countered, the cross sections in the tunnel walls are of sufficient height to provide clues as to their nature in two dimensions (east-west and vertically). After the presence of the small stone-faced structure mentioned in Chapter I was detected in the south wall of the lower tunnel, it was possible to determine what appeared to be its upper surface from the cross section. Moreover, for certain features in the tunnels, cross sections even only a little more than a meter apart are helpful and enlightening. They made possible, for example, deter- mination of the general orientation of two low walls that appeared in both cross sections. However, without additional lateral and/or vertical excavations the inves- tigation of the nature and extent of any structure large or small within the tunnels is obviously seriously limited. Because of their close proximity, the walls of the tunnel furnish, in effect, a single cross section for the Pyramid as a whole. And of course the cross section height (1.6 meters) is only one-tenth the height of the first platform of the Pyramid (16.7 meters) and one- fortieth the total height of the Pyramid which is 64.5 meters. As a result any possible structure within the present Pyramid wlhich might aproach it in size could not be effectively identified. At this scale the tunnels yield information in which amounts to a single dimen- sion. Another way of indicating what we mean is to compare the amount of fill removed in the excavation of the tunnels with the mass of the Pyramid. We calcu- late, roughly, that the fill removed in digging the tunnels amounted to about 500 cubic meters. The volume of the first platform of the Pyramid is about 600,000 cubic meters and of the total Pyramid about 1,175,000 cubic meters . Thus the original explorations resulted in the excavation of approximately 83/1000 of one per cent of the fill of the first platform and 44/1000 of one per cent of the volume of the total Pyramid. There are also a number of practical limitations to investigations in the Pyramid tunnels. The tunnels are narrow and provide very limited working space (figs. 10, 41). The angles and distances at which photo- graphs can be taken are therefore restricted. Prob- lems also arise in the disposition of workers and in the removal of backdirt. Provision of adequate light- ing is a major undertaking and a shift of a meter often meant the difference between fairly adequate light and no light. Finally the restrictive nature of the surround- ings and the dim or virtually absent illumination had a depressing effect on several members of our party. PLAN AND SCOPE OF 1959 INVESTIGATIONS We have already outlined in Chapter I our general reasons for wanting to examine the walls of the tunnels in the Pyramid. We wanted to determine whether the Pyramid might contain interior structures of earth and clay that might have been overlooked; we wanted to examine in detail the nature of the fills used in constructing the Pyramid; and we wanted to obtain a pottery sample from the Pyramid for comparison with the pottery from the Oztoyahualco region. However, after a preliminary examination of the tun- nel walls, it became apparent that we would be able to examine in detail only a small part of the tunnel system, despite the fact that one-third of the tunnel system is walled up on both sides and another 25 per cent is walled up on one side or the other. The prinmary reason for this was lack of time but we were also limited by the very nature of the tunnel system itself which made it difficult for more than a few people to work there at one time. It became apparent immediately that we could not do any effective work in the tunnels at all until we had installed a lighting system. The tunnel had once had a lighting system but the wiring and fixtures had dis- appeared some years back. Fortunately, however, the power line to the eastern entrance of the Pyramid tun- nels was still there. Accordingly, we arranged for the installation of a new lighting system in the tunnels which consisted of 100-watt bulbs placed at 20-meter intervals to facilitate movement within the tunnels and a number of 150 watt bulbs on long extension cords for use in work areas. This system was installed by Sr. Jose Monterrubio, then Assistant Custodian of the Archaeo- logical Zone, now retired. In addition two portable banks of fluorescent lights, each consisting of four 40-watt tubes were constructed by Alan L. McPherron of the University of Michigan (fig. 10). Once the lighting system had been installed we were confronted with the fact that certain sections of the tunnel system were scheduled to be walled up im- mediately by the staff of the Archaeological Zone. The lintels and posts in a number of bays had been cracked in the 1957 earthquake and had been progressively weakening thereafter and it was then felt that they were in imminent danger of collapse (figs. 10, 22). Since repairs in the tunnels take the form of shoring up the lintels with masonry walls beneath them parallel to the walls and flush with the posts, this meant that new sections of the walls of the tunnels would be sealed off from view. Because of this we felt that we should devote particu- lar attention to these affected sections since it would not be possible thereafter to obtain any information from the walled-up bays. We did not then have any inkling that all of the remaining open bays of the upper and lower tunnels would be walled up between our departure in August, 1959, and our return in December of that year,2 nor did Lic. Castafieda, then Custodiani of the 2 Figure 79, taken in 1963, shows what the tunnel system now looks like, after the completion of the walling up process. It</page><page sequence="13">VOL. 55, PT. 6, 1965] THE PYRAMID OF THE SUN AT TEOTIHUACAN 13 Archaeological Zone, seem to contemplate any such action at the time of our departure. Had we been aware of this possibility we would have disposed of our time and personnel differently, spending more time, for example, on the possible tomb area in the upper tunnel and on the adobes at the eastern entrance of the upper tunnel and less time on the collapsing bays beyond the Adosada-Pyramid juncture and before the stone-faced structure in the lower tunnel. The area scheduled for walling up was in the lower tunnel and included all bays then open from a point 34-2 meters from the western entrance of the lower tunnel to a point 63 meters inside the lower tunnel. We decided to devote our primary attention to this 28-meter stretch and to the first 20 meters of the lower tunnel, the latter stretch representing the Plataforma Adosada and its juncture with the Pyramid. Before beginning any work in the tunnels we decided that all bays in the tunnel system should be assigned a number. This was placed on the lintel of each bay in black marking ink (fig. 20). We began our number- ing system with the westernmost bay in the lower tun- nel. Each bay was also distinguished in our records as being on either the north or the south side of the tunnel system, but this designation was not placed on the lintel, each lintel bearing only a number. Thus, Bay 1S is the first bay on the south side of the lower or Noguera tunnel. Since the Noguera tunnel pierces the Plataforma Adosada before reaching the Pyramid, Bay 1S is in the Adosada (figs. 118; 11). We found the lower tunnel to be divided into 81 bays of equal width (1.4 meters), plus a narrow bay 40 cm. wide which we numbered Bay 82. The eastern edge of Bay 82S bordered on the stairwell leading to the stair- case to the upper tunnel; the eastern edge of Bay 82N bordered on the short north tunnel which exists at this point at the end of the lower tunnel (fig. 118). The area occupied by the stairwell and the lower north tun- nel was originally designated with the number 82 as well since Bay 82 was so narrow. Accordingly, the first bay in the staircase was designated Bay 83. Bay numbers in the upper tunnel begin with Bay 89 at the head of the staircase and end with Bay 157 at the eastern entrance to the tunnel system. After these numbers had been placed on the lintels we realized that the stairwell and short north tunnel opposite it (fig. 118) deserved numerical designations of their own. The stairwell was thereafter designated Bay 82A-S and the lower north tunnel Bay 82A-N. We also established datum lines in the lower and up- per tunnels before beginning our work. These were marked as follows "&gt;" on the posts of each bay (see, for example, figs. 13, 20, upper right-hand corner). These datum lines established that the lower tunnel is very close to level throughout its extent, whereas the was taken at the entrance to the Gamio tunnel looking west. See also figure 84. upper tunnel rises gently a distance of 1.5 meters from its eastern entrance to the staircase connecting it to the lower tunnel. It is also worthy of note for the benefit of future investigators that the tunnels now bear meter designa- tions every five meters on the lintels on the south side of the lower and upper tunnels, beginning, as does our numerical sequence of bay numbers, at the entrance to the lower tunnel on the western side of the Pyramid. These meter designations were on the lintels when we began our work. They were not placed there by us. These meter designations serve well as a rough guide but we found that they could not be used for precise measurements. In the lower tunnel they are reasonably accurate, running behind our measurements by less than half a meter. Near the top of the staircase in the upper tunnel they are more than a meter and a half short of what ouir measurements indicate they should be. By the end of the upper tunnel, that is, at the eastern entrance to the tunnel system (fig. 118), some of this distance has been picked up. The final meter designa- tion on the lintels (215 m.), which is 1a, meters from the upper tunnel entrance, is only about 1 meter short of what our measurements indicate it should be. The meter designations on our plan of the tunnel system (fig. 118) are based on our measurements rather than on the meter designations which now appear on the lintels. The actual amount of time we spent during our inves- tigations in the Pyramid in 1959 was quite limited. Work in the tunnels began at the beginning of July and ended in the early days of August. The work force during this period varied from two to five persons of our party, plus the staff photographer, Miss Josefa Haveman, and one to five workmen. For the greater part of the time, however, the work force in the tunnels on any given day averaged four persons. During this time all open bays in the first 63 mieters of the lower tunnel, except for six bays on the north side which were also open on the south side, were scraped and cleaned with trowels for the drawing of cross sections. It was our intent to make cross-section drawings of all of these bays on at least one side of the tunnel. This turned out to be impossible, however, and we were not able to make such drawings on a 20-meter stretch (Bays 25-38) following the Adosada-Pyramid juncture and before the stone-faced structure mentioned in Chapter I.3 We did not so prepare any bays east of the 63 meter point in the lower tunnel, nor any at all in the staircase or upper tunnel. We believed at the time that it would be possible to clean the remain- ing bays on a subsequent trip to the Pyramid and to prepare drawings of other critical areas in the system. This is now impossible as previously related. As a re- 3All of these drawings were subsequently stolen as related in the Preface (p. 3).</page><page sequence="14">14 M1ILLON, DREWITT, AND BENNYHOFF [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. sult most of the remnaining parts of the tunnel system were never examined adequately during our stay. Fortunately, however, we did photograph all open bays in the tunnel system, and now have photographs of all the areas which have subsequently been walled up. This has made it possible for us to make certain in- terpretations and to prepare a number of drawings of sections of the tunnel system from these photographs (figs. 120-124). The cross sections and other drawings from the first 63 meters of the lower tunnlel are based on photographs of bays which had been scraped and cleaned and we have more confidence in what we repre- sent in these drawings (figs. 120-122) than in our two other cross sections from the lower and upper tunnels (figs. 123, 124). The bays in the latter two drawings were never cleaned, as already mentioned. W\hile this may not be so serious a problem in our drawing of the central area of the tunnel system (fig. 123), we do have serious doubts about the acctiracy and even the useful- ness of our drawing of the adobes near the eastern entrance of the upper tunnel (fig. 124). In addition, all of our drawings are subject to the serious limitation that we were unable to photograph any of the bays from a position directly in front of them. The tunnels are too narrow to permit this (fig. 10). As a result we photographed each bay from two direc- tions (figs. 30, 31), the first half of the lower tunnel in both black and white and Kodacolor, the remainder in black and white. It was our intent to use these photo- graphs to check and supplement the information on our original drawings in the first 63 meters of the lower tunnel and as a guide to other areas of interest in the remaining parts of the tunnel system. As matters turned out, these photographs have become the primary source of all our drawings, since our drawings from the first half of the lower ttinnels were stolen and since the remaining parts of the lower and upper tunnels have been walled up. It should be clear why we present these drawings here with some hesitation. All of them are subject to possible distortions, both horizontally and vertically, over which we have little control, despite the care which went into their creation. There wotild in fact be no justification for their publication here were it not for the fact that no even remotely adequate report exists of the tunnel system and all possibility of obtaining such a re- port in the foreseeable future has been foreclosed by the walling up of all remaining open areas of both the lower and upper tunnels. For these reasons, our present report, despite its inadequacies, serves a useful purpose, we believe, so long as the reader is warned explicitly of its limitations. As previously mentioned, one of our objectives was to obtain a sampling of the pottery within the Pyramid tunnels for comparative purposes. Such samples were taken from 66 of the 101 bays in the tunnel system which were open on one or both sides of the tunnels. Samples were also taken from both the north and south sides of 10 of these 66 bays. Although not one of our original objectives, we also tried to obtain as large a sample as possible from the Plataforma Adosada, since this structure is designated in the literature as having been built during the Miccaotli phase (Armillas, 1950: p. 68; Marquina, 1951: p. 72; Noguera, 1935: pp. 53, 57; Perez, 1935: pp. 91-92). We were hopeful that this material might be useful in demonstrating further relationships between the Tzacualli anld Miccaotli phases. Comments on it and on our views on the ceramic chronology of early Teotihuac&amp;in will be found in Chapters VI and VII. We did not intend when we embarked oln our brief examination of the Pyramid tunnels to undertake any excavations because of the limitations of time. Never- theless, we felt obliged after we began our work to make a small excavation in the floor of the lower tunnel to investigate the evidence for a stone-faced structure which we had found in the south wall 55 meters from the tunnel entrance. This excavation, as all excavations, turned out to be time-consuming be- yond our expectations. It also proved to be productive beyond our expectations. But it acted to prevent us from learning as much about the rest of the tunnel system as we might otherwise have been able to do. III. THE INTERIOR OF THE PYRAMID The clearest way of proceeding is to take the reader on a tour of the tunnel systeml beginning at the western entrance, i.e., the front of the Pyramid. The lower or Noguera tunnel is entered through an iron grill gate, the entrance to which is slightly below present ground level in front of the Pyramid and which is protected from rain by a masonry extension of the Adosada itself (figs. 8, 9). At the western entrance (fig. 118) what appears to be the present stone facing of the Plataforma Adosada is visible in the upper third of Bay 1, N and S, and the upper western corner of Bay 2, N and S (fig. 11). In Bay 3, about 3 ni. from the entrance, a low stone wall about 90 cm. high and 40-50 cm. wide is visible in cross section in both the north and south walls of the tunnel (fig. 12). This is the first of several suggestions of interior structures within the Adosada itself. In the next open bay, Bay 7S, about 10 m. from the entrance, the beginning of a rock-filled area is visible (figs. 118 (3) ; 13). The line of rock fill drops sharply to floor level and then begins to rise almost imlmedi- ately on both sides of the tunnel in a more gradual slope (figs. 118, 120). Within this stone fill, in Bay 8, N and S, water-laid deposits of sandy silt are to be found, containing an abundance of large fragments of re- storable pottery vessels. This deposit rests in what appears to be a well-defined basin-like structure (figs.</page><page sequence="15">VOL. 55, PT. 6, 1965] THE PYRAMID OF THE SUN AT TEOTIHUACAN 15 118, 120; 14, 16, 17). This and other evidence of in- terior structures within the Adosada itself is discussed in Chapter V. Beyond the rock fill very faint outlines of adobes are visible.' This represents the first appearance of adobes in the Noguera or lower tunnel. The area in which the rock fill rests on the adobes represents the juncture of the Adosada and the Pyramid proper, as mentioned in Chapter V (figs. 118 (3, 4), 120; 18). Immediately to the east of this juncture a low stone wall is visible in both walls of the tunnel. This structure, which is 60 cm. wide, begins 16 meters from the tunnel entrance. While it does not appear to be necessarily related to the juncture of the Adosada with the Pyramid, Perez (1935: p. 93) evidently believed that this wall marked the end of the Adosada and the beginning of the Pyramid (see Chapter V). The stone wall is sur- rounded on both sides by adobes (figs. 120; 19). These adobes represent a continuation of the adobes on which the Adosada rests. They end abruptly shortly beyond the wall, resting against a dark compacted earth fill containing pottery fragments and small stones. Four meters east of the stone wall both sides of the tunnel are walled up for a distance of 14 meters and we are therefore unable to say anything about the fill in this area. The next open area begins 33.5 meters east of the lower tunnel entrance, at Bay 25N. From this point to Bay 42N, a distance of slightly more than 25 meters, one side or the other of the tunnel walls is open for examination but only 6 of these 18 bays are open on both sides. As we shall see, this section pre- sented us with difficult problems of interpretation, especially near the stone-faced structure mentioned in Chapter I, which is in this area. The first 17 meters of this section (Bays 25-36) seem to consist primarily of fill of dark, compacted, sandy earth with scattered fragments of pottery and small rocks. This deposit appears to consist of layers of material of varying consistency, with distinct fill lines visible throughout most of its extent (figs. 21, 22). The lower 10-20 cm. of the material visible in many of these bays seems to have consisted of a slightly different fill containing relatively numerous pieces of the in- durated yellow subsoil known locally as tepetate. In cross section the top of this fill is marked by an undulating line. It does not appear to represent a former surface but rather a special type of fill (fig. 21). Beginning at a point very close to 50 meters from the lower tunnel entrance (Bay 37N), an inclined plane appears in the north wall of the tunnel a short distance above the present tunnel floor. The slope of this plane rises gently but steadily to the east for a distance of 6.5 meters reaching a maximum height of 1.35 m. above the base of the pillar in Bay 41N 1 Perez (1935: p. 92) comments on the sporadic use of adobes in the Adosada. We did not note any, suggesting that they may be concealed behind the walled bays. (figs. 121; 23-27). No similar deposit was observable on the south wall of the tunnel in this area (fig. 29). The fill overlying the area of the inclined plane seems to be similar in consistency and manner of deposition to the material previously described in the 17 meter stretch immediately to the east (Bays 25N-36N). That is, it appears to be fill laid down in the construction of the Pyramid proper. However, the deposits visible in the south wall of the tunnel, whiclh was only partially open to inspection through the area of the inclined plane, appear to be different both in consistency and in content. Pottery fragments are more abundant and the deposits seem to be less sandy. So far as we were able to tell the deposits on the south side of the tunnel also rep- resent fill laid down in the building of the first body of the main Pyramid. The apparent difference in composition between the fill on the north side and that visible in the bays open on the south side probably represents no more than local variation in the type of fill then being used in construction. But we cannot be certain of this and have therefore noted this difference for the record. The inclined plane ends, as we have seen, about 56 mn. from the western entrance (Bay 41N). In the south wall at this point (Bay 41S), the western- most portion of the stone-faced structure mentioned in Chapter I appears in cross section (figs. 122 (d) 30, 31). For reasons which will become clear in Chapter IV, we believe it possible that the inclined plane and the stone-faced structure are related and that the inclined plane possibly represents a west-east ramp leading to the top of the stone-faced structure on the north side of the tunnel. It also appears that the re- mains of an earlier structure or structures are visible in the tunnel walls immediately behind the stone-faced structure and its putative ramp (Bays 41N, 42N and 41S) (figs. 121; 27, 28, 30; Ch. IV). The outer or western surface of the lower part of the stone-faced structure was exposed by an excavation in the tunnel floor, the upper part of the structure presum- ably having been removed in the excavation of the lower tunnel. Perez (1935: pp. 91-92) does not, however, make any comment on this point. We also excavated part of the deposit in the tunnel floor behind the stone facing. This is where the obsidian figurine offering mentioned in Chapter I was found (figs. 122; 38-40). The offering and the complex of structures found in this section of the tunnel are discussed in Chapter IV. Continuing on our survey of the lower tunnel, we find that the next 11 meters on the north side are walled up (Bays 43N-50N). On the south side the situation is even worse, for only one bay is open (Bay 45S) for a distance of almost 17 meters (Bays 41S to 54S) (fig. 118). This is particularly un- fortunate because it prevented us from following the out- lines of the stone-faced structure to the east wlhere we hoped to be able to determine its eastern limnit.</page><page sequence="16">16 MILLON, DREWITT, AND BENNYH-)FF [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. The one open bay in this section, Bay 45S, some 4 meters east of Bay 41S in which the stone facing is visible, does not reveal any demonstrable relationship to the stone-faced structure. It does reveal, however, a sloping fill of tepetate chunks in the lower part of its eastern side (fig. 42), which may represent a special fill in the hearting of the stone-faced structure, since it slopes in the same direction. The succeeding section of the lower tunnel does not help to clarify the problem of the eastern limit of the stone-faced structure. This is in part due to the fact that 15.5 meters (11 bays) of the last 43.5 meters in the lower tunnel are walled up on both sides (Bays 51-82). To renew the reader's orientation at this point, we are referring to a section of the lower tunnel which extends east from a point 70 meters from the western entrance to a point 113.5 meters from that entrance. The full length of the Noguera tulnnel is close to 115 meters, the additional distance being occupied by the beginning of the staircase leading to the upper or Gamio tunnel (see fig. 118). What is visible in the last 44 meters of the lower tunnel (Bays 51 to 82) is fill of varying consistency, sometimes rich in pottery fragments, the latter suggest- ing the use of midden deposits for fill (fig. 43). We did not note any evidence of structures in this section of the tunnel nor did we note any use of adobes. However, at 105 meters from the lower tunnel entrance (Bay 76S), we noted the presence of sloping fill lines, sloping downward from west to east. These fill lines appear in two of the three remaining open bays of the lower tunnel, that is, for an overall distance of 8.5 meters (to Bay 81), and their slope is down from west to east, that is, towards the center of the Pyramid (figs. 123; 45, 46). Fill lines sloping in the same direction are also clearly visible in the south wall of the well made for the staircase leading to the upper tunnel (figs. 118, 123; 47). The staircase begins approximately 115 meters from the lower tunnel entrance. This well is immediately to the east of the last bay in the lower tunnel (Bay 81 and the abbreviated Bay 82) (fig. 50) and is approxi- mately the same width as a bay. Thus the west-east sloping fill lines extend for a distance of 10 meters to the approximate center of the Pyramid. We do not know whether this sloping fill has any special significance. It is conceivable that it is related to the previously-mentioned stone-faced structure which begins 50 meters to the west but we have no way of knowing whether it is or not. It may also be related to a structural feature which begins near the top of the staircase and extends for some distance in the upper tunnel. We shall be discussing this farther along. It is also possible that it has a significance independent of either of these structures in view of its location near the center of the Pyramid and sloping towards it. Whatever may be its significance can be determined only by further work in the tunnel(s). At the eastern end of the lower tunnel, at the foot of the stairs leading to the upper tunnel, there is a short exploratory tunnel running some 9 meters to the north at a right angle to the lower tunnel (figs. 118; 48, 49). This tunnel was excavated by Re'my Bastien in 1946 or thereabouts. It has no concrete supports or vault. However, when it was dug its roof was arched which may account for the fact that it survived the 1957 earthquake relatively undamaged (figs. 48, 49). The sloping fill lines previously mentioned are clearly visible at the north end of this tunnel (fig. 49). This marks the end of our tour of the lower tunnel system. As previously mentioned, the lower tunnel is connected to the upper tunnel by a staircase. This consists of a flight of 24 concrete steps, each approxi- mately 25 cm. high (figs. 123; 50). The staircase is approximately the same width as the tunnels it connects. It climbs in a southeasterly direction for several meters, then turns due east to join the upper tunnel 6 meters above the floor of the lower tunnel. The jog in the stairs was necessary because the lower tunnel is roughly parallel to but slightly less than 2 meters north of the upper tunnel. Inspection of the staircase revealed several features of interest but we were not able, unfortunately, to clean these bays for careful inspection and photography. Despite this the walls of the staircase did reveal a change in construction material at a point slightly over 2 meters above the floor of the lower tunniel. At this height we began to note the presence of large rectangular adobes (figs. 123; 51, 52). We are not certain whether adobes completely replace other build- ing material from this point upward or whether they continued to be used in conjunction with fill for an- other meter (figs. 123; 51, 52). In any event, adobes soon replace other fill on both sides of the staircase (figs. 123; 53). It is possible that the adobes are re- lated to a structural feature which begins above anid to the east of the uppermost adobes visible when we nmadle our inspection (fig. 123). The new structural feature to which we refer first manifests itself near the top of the staircase in the form of slanting fill lines, sloping down from west to east (figs. 123; 54-56). These fill lines slant steeply at first, then are succeeded by a series of deposits whose gradient is less sharp (fig. 123). As you enter the upper tunnel from the top of the staircase, these sloping deposits are still visible (fig. 2 Perez mentions that short tunnels 1.5 meters long were dug to the north and south of the end of the lower tunnel (1935: p. 91). The southern extension became part of the stairwell leading to the upper tunnel. The northern extension was continued by Remy Bastien in the manner indicated. We did not obtain adequate information from the Bastien tunnel in 1959; later visits were made in 1961 and 1963; photos of the north end of this tunnel were made in 1963.</page><page sequence="17">VOL. 55, PT. 6, 1965] THE PYRAMID OF THE SUN AT TEOTIHUACAN 17 123). Less than two meters from the staircase (Bay 90), these are capped by a surface near the lintel (figs. 123; 57). It is possible that this surface also overrides them at the top of the staircase (Bay 89) but this is problematical (fig. 123). In any case the surface is visible in the next bay to the east (Bay 91), but is interrupted thereafter for a space of about 5 meters after which it reappears (Bay 95N) and con- tinues thereafter for another 15 meters (to Bay 106) (figs. 123; 58, 64, 65, 67-69). The surface runs at a relatively uniform height throughout its extent. What slope it has is down from west to east but this is very slight; it is 20 cm. higher at its westernmost visible point (Bay 90) than it is at the point where it vanishes into the roof of the tunnel (Bay 106) (fig. 123). It does, however, seem to dip slightly in its central portion; this drop is very slight, approximately 10 cm. (fig. 123). The total distance spanned by the visible portion of this surface is approximately 22 m. The surface seems to consist of water-sorted deposits, suggesting that this portion of the Pyramid was ex- posed for an undetermined period of time (which need not have been long). It does not give the appearance of a deliberately made surface designed to be the outer capping of a structure. It will be recalled that the surface is interrupted for a space of 5 meters shortly after it first makes its appearance (Bays 92-94). However, another surface appears about 25 cm. higher in this interrupted area which may be related to the surface we have just been discussing. The higher surface appears in a short tunnel approximately a meter wide which begins 5 meters east of the top of the staircase (Bays 92 and 93N). This tunnel, which we refer to as the upper north tunnel, extends north for a distance of about 4 meters, and is approximately level with the main tunnel (fig. 123, inset). We are not certain who was responsible for the digging of this tunnel but believe that it may have been Vaillant (1932: pp. 487-488). It is possible, however, that either Vaillant or someone else enlarged an already existing pit made at this point under Kroeber's direction in 1924. We cannot be certain of this because of contradictions between the measurements given by Kroeber and the evidence presently visible in the tunnels concerning the location of his four pits (Kroeber, 1925: p. 391). We shall be considering his other pits later in this chapter. How- ever, the innermost of Kroeber's pits in the upper tunnel from which he obtained his sample of pottery from the Pyramid, and which he identifies as Lot No. 1, may either have been in the spot where the upper north tunnel is now located or several meters to the west (Bays 89-90) (figs. 123; 57). The measure- ments which he cites admit of either interpretation. While we do not know who was responsible for the digging of this tunnel, we can say something about the nature of the deposits within it. The first three meters of the upper north tunnel consist of a distinctive deposit of small chunks of caliche and tepetate which rises to a height of 1.70 m. above the tunnel floor. The northern limit of this forms an almost perpendic- ular line (fig. 123, inset). The remaining meter to the north consists of an earth fill containing pottery fragments and several good-sized deposits of diatoma- ceous material.3 This fill also rises 1.70 m. above the tunnel floor. Both the caliche-tepetate and earth fills are capped by the previously mentioned surface which is approximately 5 cm. in height, consisting of fine- grained material, which does not, however, appear to have been water-sorted (figs. 123, inset; 59-63). It is thus distinct in appearance from the water-sorted surface which appears in the main upper tunnel ap- proximately 25 cm. lower. Three small basin-shaped hearths appear immediately below this surface. Al- though they are small their contents are quite dis- tinctive; they are filled with ash, finely dispersed frag- ments of charcoal, and a few tiny fragments of pottery. Each is about 30 cm. in cross section. Two of them appear in the west wall of the upper north tunnel; one on the east. Whether these hearths have any special significance in connection with the water-sorted deposit we do not know. Their presence opens up the possibility that the surface was not entirely a transitory phenomenon, marking a heavy rainfall which occurred during the building of the Pyramid. Possibly they are of ritual significance. Or perhaps they are the remains left by workmen eating lunch. An effort was made to obtain an adequate carbon sample from these small hearths but they did not pro- vide enough carbon for dating purposes. Another carbon sample was obtained from a large ash lens which formed part of the fill visible in Bays 89-90N, a short distance to the west.4 The fill of caliche and tepetate visible in the upper north tunnel is also found in the main upper tunnel (figs. 123; 59). However, it is only sporadically present, if at all, in the south wall of the main tunnel. Surrounding the distinctive caliche-tepetate fill are other fills containing fragments of both caliche and tepetate but these materials constitute a much smaller proportion of the latter deposits (figs. 123; 57, 65). The latter deposits are present in the south wall as well as the north. The presence of the distinctive caliche-tepetate fill in the north wall of the tunnel and in the upper north tunnel, together with its absence in the south wall suggests that a rectangular pit may exist in this part of the Pyramid, the east-west dimensions of which are 5 meters near the lintels of the tunnel 3 While taking new photographs of the upper north tunnel in 1963, the presence of adobes was noted at the rear or north end of this tunnel (figs. 61-63). Their presence is not commented on in the text. 4 The radiocarbon date obtained from this material is discussed in Chapter VI.</page><page sequence="18">18 MILLON, DREWITT, AND BENNYHOFF [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. and about 2.5 meters near its floor and whose north- south dimensions are more than three meters but less than 4 meters (the width of the main tunnel being a meter), since the distinctive fill does not appear clearly in the south wall. The possible significance of this formation will be commented on below. It will be recalled that near the top of the stairway sloping fill lines are visible tipping downward from west to east. This continues to be the direction of slope of fill lines until slightly beyond the upper north tunnel, a distance of some 9 meters. Thereafter, fill lines in both the north and south walls tip in the opposite directions, that is, down from east to west for a distance of 20 meters (from Bays 95-108) (figs. 123; 65-67). The existence of these fill lines sloping toward each other, capped by a surface, raise several possibilities in interpretation. The most intriguing of these possibilities is that these fill lines represent the fill of an enormous pit near the center of the Pyramid. If this is what they do represent, it is possible that the fill lines we see in the tunnel represent the deposits capping a pit which houses a tomb. It is equally possible, however, that these lines represent no more than successive deposits of fill poured in from two directions by workmen working from west to east and from east to west towards the center of the Pyramid. The fill lines in the final meters of the lower tunnel might be taken to support the latter interpretation. On the other hand, the presence of the course of adobes in the stair- case to the upper tunnel might be taken to support the "tomb" interpretation, representing perhaps the western wall of the pit housing it. The surface capping these lines of fill over so long a distance suggests at the very least that a considerable area of the Pyramid's first stage was built to this height with a surface which was very close to level. Aside from the fill lines in the lower tunnel suggesting a ramp approaching the stone-faced structure, this is the only part of the tunnel system where a uniform surface of any kind is visible. It is true that what we were able to see of the surface is fragile and does not appear to have been exposed to weathering for any considerable period of time. Nor does it show evidence of having been hardened by use. This argues against the possibility that we may be dealing here with a major structure built before the raising of the present Pyramid. But it is consonant with the idea that it may be the capping of a tomb. Overlying the water-sorted surface is what appears to be a relatively uniform deposit of gray silty material the upper portion of which rises an unknown distance above the lintels (figs. 123; 58, 65-67, 69). The band 5 cm. wide which forms the surface in the upper north tunnel at a height of 1.80 m. from the tunnel floor is similar in appearance and consistency to the deposit which overlies the water-sorted surface visible in the walls of the main upper tunnel. It is possible there- fore that both are part of the same deposit which capped the fills and the water-sorted surface in this section of the tunnel system. This again raises the possibility that we may be dealing with the upper surface of a major interior structure in the Pyramid. This does not seem likely, however, because the surface visible in the upper north tunnel is quite fragile. It was not possible to trowel away overlying material and expose any distinct hard surface. We do not believe then that this surface was intended to be the permanent outer surface of a structure for any length of time. Its appearance does not suggest that it would have with- stood weathering for any period of time without pro- found alteration. This supports the "tomb hypothesis" once again. However, there are probably other inter- pretations which would be just as consonant with the evidence. It is impossible to come to any definite con- clusion without further excavation. Continuing east from the end of the deposits which slope to the west, we are now at a point slightly less than 149 meters from the entrance to the lower tunnel (Bay 109), with an additional 69 meters remaining. We shall now consider a section of the tunnel which extends for a distance of 50.5 meters (Bays 109-144) which will bring us to within slightly more than 18 meters of the end of the upper tunnel. The last 18 meters we shall consider separately because this is the area where adobes appear once again, as mentioned in Chapter I. The section we are about to discuss reveals only one structural feature and this of minor significance. It appears on the east side of one of the pits excavated for Kroeber's pottery sample in 1924 (Bay 136S). We shall discuss this structural feature briefly below. This section also contains two other excavations in the north wall of the tunnel, each of which now extends in an east-west direction for about 3 meters and which vary from a meter to 2 meters in depth, though each was probably originally considerably smaller, collapses having increased their lateral dimensions; the first of these is about a meter high, the second, about 1.5 meters (Bays 119-120N, Bays 142-143N) (figs. 118; 70, 73). We believe that the more easterly of these (Bays 142-143N), the one which we have illustrated, is one of Kroeber's pits, the one which he designates as Lot No. 3 (Kroeber, 1925: p. 391). However, the other pit falls short of the location given by Kroeber for his Lot No. 4, by some 2 to 3 meters, depending on how his measurements are interpreted. Since tlhe area immediately to the west of this pit (Bays 119-120) is walled up on the north side for a distance of 8.5 meters, it is possible that Kroeber's pit is where he said it was and that this is another one of unknown origin. The remaining Kroeber pit, his Lot No. 2, is the only one on the south side of the tunnel (Bays 135-</page><page sequence="19">VOL. 55, PT. 6, 1965j THE PYRAMID OF THE SUN AT TEOTIHUACAN 19 136S) It is now somewhat smaller in lateral di- mension than the two excavations on the north side of the tunnel, extending for a distance of about 2 meters. It is partially closed off by the walling up of one of the bays it straddles (Bay 135S). Its depth is ap- proximately 2 meters; its height, 1 meter. The eastern- most edge of the pit, which is now larger than when Kroeber had it excavated, reveals the minor structural feature mentioned previously (figs. 118; 74, 75) .5 This consists of two rough courses of stones, some of which are fractured, associated with finely laminated pottery-bearing deposits of clay some 25 cm. in thick- ness, which appear to have been water-laid. The lowest course of these stones is about 60 cm. from the floor of the tunnel. They extend to the south at roughly right angles to the wall of the tunnel for a distance of approximately 70 cm. There is no sign of any similar feature in the north wall at this point. However, the next bay to the east (Bay 137) is walled up on both sides of the tunnel. The position of these stones sug- gests that they may have formed a small basin in which the laminated bands of clay collected. Above these bands of clay is a deposit in which pottery fragments are abundant. There is a suggestion of a surface within this deposit about 20 centimeters above the top of the laminated deposits. We do not believe that this minor structural feature is of any special significance. We have no reason to believe that it is an intentional construction; it may simply be that the grouping of stones is accidental and that the water-laid deposit collected within it during a brief interval in the construction of the Pyramid. Nevertheless, it does stand out from surrounding de- posits and we have therefore noted its presence for whatever it may be worth. In the remaining open bays in this section of the tunnel the fill is predominately a soft, fine, dark brown middenlike material containing in some areas extraordi- narily high concentrations of pottery fragments. One of the Kroeber pits was made in such an area (Bays 142-143N) (figs. 70-73); we illustrate another for inspection by the reader (fig. 78). In some areas, the juncture between deposits relatively free of pottery and deposits containing heavy concentrations is quite sharp (fig. 73). Nevertheless, we could detect no significant patterning in the few areas where sloping lines of fill were visible. This may be due in part to the fact that almost two-thirds of the length of this section of the tunnel has been walled up on both sides (Bays 110-111, 113-118, 121, 127-135, 137-141), 23 of the 36 bays involved. The latter fact is in itself an indication that the fill in this section of the tunnel is much looser in texture 5 It is possible that additional samples were taken from this and other pits by other investigators subsequent to their exca- vation for Kroeber. This may be at least part of the reason these pits are greater in size than Kroeber indicated. Collapses also seem to be a factor as noted above. than the various fills used in the possible "tomb" area to the west where no bays at all have been walled up for a distance of 35 meters (fig. 123). In any case we detected nothing else of note in this section of the tunnel. In fact the most noteworthy aspect of this stretch of the upper tunnel is that the visible portion of its 50 meter length seems to consist almost entirely of dark brown loamy material suggesting that midden was the primary building material in it. Nowhere in this stretch of the upper tunnel did we find any evidence of the use of adobes, except possibly in the easternmost bay in this section (Bay 144N) (fig. 76) (cf. Kroeber, 1925: p. 391). We come to the end of our tour of the tunnel system with the last 18 meters of the upper tunnel (Bays 145-157). This is the section of the upper tunnel containing adobes which roughly correspond in position to the adobes near the western end of the lower tunnel, as mentioned in Chapter I. The first of the 13 bays in this section (Bay 145) still seems to consist primarily of midden material but on the upper portion of its north side the faint outlines of several adobes are visible. We do not know whether these are isolated or whether close examination would reveal that they or the possible adobes in Bay 144 North form the beginning of the use of continuous courses of this building material (fig. 77; also possibly fig. 78, the south side of the same bay). In the next three bays (Bays 146-148) the midden material continues in the lower part of the deposits visible but adobes are visible in the upper portions (fig. 80). However, they still seem to appear sporadically and it is still not clear whether they have now become the predominant build- ing material. Unfortunately the exposed surface of the next 5.5 meters (Bays 149-152), is covered with a scaly white deposit which obscures the nature of the construction material behind it. This deposit is perhaps the product of a chemical reaction due to the seepage of moisture from above at this point in the upper tunnel. The white deposit actually begins to appear one bay earlier (Bay 148) but the outlines of several adobes nevertheless can be made out near the top of the bay (fig. 80); the next four bays are almost completely obscured, however (fig. 81). When we can next see a surface relatively free of this scaly deposit, we are within seven meters of the end of the upper tunnel (Bay 153). At this point courses of adobes are visible on both sides of the tunnel. The outlines of some adobes can also be made out through the scaly deposit on the north side of the tunnel in the bay immediately preceding (Bay 152N), but none are visible on the south side. Beginning at this point courses of adobes extend for approximately 3.5 meters, to within 3.5 meters of the entrance to the upper tunnel (fig. 124; 82, 83). The adobes in this section of the tunnel system on the eastern face of the Pyramid are, in general, similar</page><page sequence="20">20 MILLON, DREWITT, AND BENNYHOFF [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. in appearance and dimensionis to the adobes at the western end of the tunnel system mentioned earlier (figs. 120; 18). The largest of them also seem to approach the dimensions cited by Batres (1906: p. 20) (i.e., 40x30x10 cm.), but there are many which seem to be much smaller in cross section. By contrast the average size of adobes in the center of the Pyramid seems to be very much larger (figs. 123; 51, 53). The last 3.5 meters at the eastern end of the upper tunnel adobes seem to consist of layers of earth fill, whose slope is down from west to east, that is, in the same direction as the outer surface of the eastern face of the Pyramid (fig. 124; 83). It is conceivable that the adobes on which these fill lines rest may have served as the foundation for an earlier facing of the Pyramid. That is, the first or lower platform of the Pyramid may originally have been smaller than it is now and adobes may have been used to form its surface or as a foundation or backing for its surface.6 However, we are not at all confident that this is what is represented. It is just as plausible, perhaps more so, to interpret this entire cross section as representing the way the outer surface of the present Pyramid was constructed-courses of adobes interspersed with fill in a single building operation for at least the last 7 and perhaps the last 18 meters of the Pyramid's first stage. This completes our tour of the tunnel system. There remain only a few comments of a general nature. In several sections of the tunnel system the deposits ex- posed in the tunnel walls were noticeably moist. We particularly noted three such areas but there may be others which we did not note. The first such area was in the Plataforma Adosada and the area of its juncture with the Pyramid, a section some 10 meters in length, beginning 10 meters inside the lower tunnel (Bays 8-14) (figs. 118, 120). The next 14 meters of the lower tunnel are walled up on both sides (Bays 15-24). The second moist stretch begins im- mediately following this walled up area and continues through all open bays for the next 29 meters, i.e., for a distance of 63 meters from the entrance to the lower tunnel. It seems quite probable that these two moist stretches are really parts of a single long stretch more than '50 meters in extent. The deposits in the first moist stretch are damper than those in the second, and in fact the second stretch grows progressively dryer as one penetrates deeper within the Pyramid. The second moist stretch may not actually end for another 10-15 meters but beyond the 75 meter point (Bay 56) deposits are quite dry and free of the signs of moisture noted earlier. The third moist stretch is at the other end of the tunnel system, near the eastern entrance to the upper 6 This possibility receives some support from the recent excavations of Arql, Ponciano Salazar of INAH on the north side of the Pyramid (see Chapters V and VII). tunnel. It manifests itself most strongly for a distance of 7 to 14 meters from the entrance to the upper tunnel (Bay 148-152). It is in this stretch that the exposed surfaces of the bays are coated with a white, scaly sub- stance which obscures the deposits lying behind it (fig. 81). But the bays immediately to the west also con- tain moist deposits, though they become progressively less so as one moves deeper into the upper tunnel. Such moisture was evident in the deposits comprising the possible minor structure 17 meters deeper in the upper tunnel (Bay 136) but we are unable to say whether it was evident beyond this point. We do know that beginning at a point 63 meters within the upper tunnel (Bay 109) deposits are notably dry and free of any sign of seepage, and that they remain so for the remainder of the upper tunnel. Thus, in the upper tunnel, moisture-bearing deposits end some- where between 31 meters and 63 meters from the upper tunnel entrance, perhaps between the 56 and 63 meter points, since the deposits at 56 meters seem still to be moist (Bays 119-120). We do not know the reason for the differential moisture content manifested in the walls of the tunnel system. Lic. Manuel Castafieda, then Custodian of the Archaeological Zone of Teotihuacan, who first called this fact to our attention, was of the opinion that the beginning of the second moist area in the lower tunnel might underlie a tomb chamber or major offering of some sort through which moisture was percolating from above. This is possible, a likely place for such an offering being below or behind the foot of the stair-, cases of the second or third stages of the Pyramid (fig. 4). On the other hand, there is another explanation which might account for the presence of this moisture at both ends of the tunnel system. It may simply be that moisture has been seeping down to the level of the tunnels through the sections of the tunnel system which underlie the first two stages of the Pyramid but that it has not penetrated to the level of the tunnels in the central area of the Pyramid covered by the third and higher stages (see fig. 118). This, however, would not explain why the first seven bays of the lower tunnel and the last five of the upper tunnel, are dry. Perhaps this has something to do with protection provided b)y the stone facing of the Adosada and the Pyramid at these points at opposite ends of the Pyramid. It is clear from our survey of the tunnel system that adobes form a relatively small fraction of the exposed area of the tunnels. We are not certain, of course, that they do not occupy more extensive areas than we have indicated. This is more apt to be the case in the upper tunnel than in the lower since we were unable to clean the bays in the upper tunnel for close examination of their deposits. Nevertheless, for reasons already indicated, we believe that our estimates are likely to be sound within a relatively small margin of error.</page><page sequence="21">VOL. 55, PT. 6, 19651 THE PYRAMID OF THE SUN AT TEOTIHUACAN 21 It will be recalled that adobes were found in only three sections of the tunnel system, near the western entrance (at the juncture of the Adosada and the Pyramid), at the eastern entrance and in the staircase.7 This suggests that adobes were used as construction material for the final 10 to 20 meters of both the front and back of the first stage of the Pyramid. Presumably they were also used on the other two sides as well. Thereafter they were used again only near the center of the Pyramid in a localized area in which they may have formed part of a large construction, the possible "tomb" area. The remaining sections of the tunnel system reveal only earth fills, often fills of what obviously must have been midden material. It is possible then that adobes were only used as outer retaining walls for the first stage of the Pyramid to help contain the fills which comprised the greater part of its interior. Perhaps the builders of the Pyramid believed that this thick capping of adobes would better bear the thrust of overlying materials. Or, as previously commented on, the adobes might represent what remains of a backing or foundation for an earlier facing of a pyramid slightly smaller than the present one. We do not know. But it does seem reasonably certain that adobes occupy no more than 30 to 45 meters of the 218 meter length of the tunnel system. The western limit of the use of adobes is reasonably clear in the upper tunnel. But we do not know how far they may have extended to the east in the lower tunnel, since there is a 14-meter stretch walled up immediately to the east of the adobes near the Adosada juncture (Bays 15-24). Hence, the range of 15 meters, between 30 and 45. If we assume that adobes occupied the full 45 meters which it seems possible they could have occupied, this leaves a total of 173 meters. Of this distance some 28 meters are occupied by the possible "tomb" area near the center of the Pyramid, which contains special fills that seem to be free of pottery fragments for the most part. We are left then with a total of 145 meters. This is 66 per cent of the total length of the tunnel system. If we then exclude the Plataforma Adosada from this total, there remains a total of 134 meters, which is 65 per cent of the length of the tunnel system exclusive of the Adosada. This is the length of the tunnel system within the Pyramid itself containing fills, including fills of midden material. Of this total of 134 meters, 80 meters are open for inspection on one or both sides of the tunnel system (57 bays). All of these 80 meters seem to consist of fill containing pottery fragments, but only 17 meters of it (12 bays) are clearly midden material containing great concentrations of broken pottery. This is 21 per cent of the total length of fill material visible in the Pyramid proper and 13.6 per cent of the total length of the tunnel system exclusive of the Adosada. 7See footnote no. 3 to discussion on upper north tunnel concerning the presence there of adobes. We do not know, of course, whether the tunnel system gives an adequate picture of the relative proportions of midden fill to other deposits in the first stage of the pyramid. For example, a greater volume of midden material is found in the upper tunnel than in the lower, in the proportion of 3 :1. Furthermore, the midden material in the lower tunnel (3 bays) is not so densely packed with sherds as is the midden material in the upper tunnel (compare, for example, Bay 45S in the lower tunnel (fig. 42) with Bay 142N (figs. 71, 72) in the upper tunnel). As a matter of fact, this indicates something of importance in itself, namely, that the Pyramid was not built over an already existing ac- cumulation of midden. This conclusion is supported by other evidence to be discussed later from the stone-faced structure which indicates that the site of the Pyramid must already have been sacred when it was built. It does not, in other words, seem to have been built over a great garbage dump. The midden fill which we find in it must therefore have been deliberately brought to the Pyramid to be used as fill in its con- struction. Our conclusions concerning the Pyramid and in- terior structures within it are stated in the final chapter (Chapter VII), following the presentation of the evi- dence concerning the stone-faced structure and the Pyramid-Adosada juncture and the evidence revealed by study of the pottery and other artifacts collected during our investigations. These form the subject of the next three chapters. IV. THE STONE-FACED STRUCTURE As mentioned in Chapter III our examination of the walls of the tunnel system revealed stone fill in Bay 41S (figs. 122; 30, 31). Apart from the stone fill in the Adosada section of the lower tunnel and the low stone wall immediately east of the Adosada-Pyramid juncture, this was the only stone fill visible in the lower tunnel. Near the top of the bay the stone fill is about 1 meter wide. The juncture of the stone fill and the earth fills to the east, slopes down from east to west so that at the base of the bay, stone is only visible at the western edge of the bay. The stone fill reached to within 10 cm. of the top of the bay and was overlaid by a water-deposited layer of sand which sloped downward slightly from east to west. A narrow cross-section of water-laid sand was also visible along the juncture of the stone fill and the earth to the east, extending from approximately 10 to 50 cm. above the tunnel floor (fig. 122 (d) ). The adjacent bays on the south wall of the tunnel to the east and west of Bay 41S were walled up. No similar evidence of a structure was visible in 41N or 42N and 40N was partially walled up. However, the stone fill of 41S was, by itself, sufficient to suggest a cross section of either a rock wall in a state of disrepair or a stone surface sloping up from west to east which was originally</page><page sequence="22">22 MILLON, DREWITT, AND BENNYHOFF [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. open at the top permitting water and sand to filter down through cracks between the stones and the earth backing. Fingerings of sand visible between the inner (eastern) edge of the stone fill and the earth backing suggested the latter (figs. 122 (d) ; 30, 31). Both because of time limitations and possible cave-in problems it was not thought feasible to reopen Bay 40S which had been walled up. It was decided that ex- ploration of the structure would be limited to an attempt to trace the northern extension of the stone fill in the tunnel floor. A small exploratory pit, 30 cm. wide and 110 cm. long, was dug along the base of Bay 41S to a depth of 45 cm. below the present level of the tunnel floor (fig. 122 (a, d), Pit A). Stones were found only at the western end of this pit in line with and below the stones that were visible in the lower right- hand corner of the 13ay. It was concluded that, if further evidence of the structure were to he found, a trench extending west from Bay 41S would have to be dug in the tunnel floor. Accordingly, a trench 1.2 meters wide (the width of the tunnel) and 2.4 meters long was laid out. The eastern margin of this trench was located 30 cm. east of the mid-line of the western pillars of Bays 41N and 41S (fig. 122 (a), Trench 1, East and West). Since it was known that the floor of the tunnel had been built up to some extent by earth which had fallen from the tunnel walls since the original excavation of the lower tunnel, it was decided that the first level excavated would be uni- formly 30 cm. deep. Beginning at a depth of 20 cm. below the present tunnel floor, stones were encountered in an area which extended 75 cm. west of the eastern margin of the trench. At a depth of 30 cm. the outlines of the stones in the floor were clear (figs. 36, 37). The western edge of the stones was well defined; the eastern edge was much less so. These stones exposed in the tunnel floor appeared quite clearly to be an extension of the stones in the wall of Bay 41S. On the north side, however, the stones seemed to end about 15 cm. short of the north wall of the tunnel. As a result of these early findings it was decided that the western face of the rock structure should be exposed by continuing the excavation of that part of Trench 1 to the west of the rock structure. It was decided that the excavation in this part should be carried out in 15 cm. levels until a change in strata was encountered. Since it appeared that the stone structure ended short of the north wall of the tunnel, it seemed possible that we had uncovered its northwest corner. To test this conclusion a narrow pit was excavated along the base of Bays 41 and 42N in an attempt to uncover the northern edge of this structure. The pit was made 35 cm. wide, 2.5 meters long and 45 cm. deep (fig. 122 (a), Pit B). In effect it was a narrow northern extension of Trench 1 to the mid-line of the eastern pillar of Bay 42N. Pit B did not reveal any evidence of a continuation of the rock fill in an easterly direction. It did, how- ever, help to confirm our original observation that the stone structure ended short of the north wall of the tunnel. We concluded that any further information on the northern terminus of the rock structure would be found in the excavation of Trench 1. In the course of the excavation of the 30-45 cm. level of Trench 1 west of the stone structure, it became clear that the west face of this structure had been exposed once before. The outlines of this previous pit were somewhat irregular. Its width coincided approximately with the width of the tunnel; its length was slightly over one meter. It had been dug to a depth of 145 cm. to solid tepetate. Curiously, no published report of such an excavation exists. We tried to find out who had dug the pit but so far the matter remains a mystery. Noguera, Armillas, Remy Bastien, and Lic. Castafieda disclaim all knowledge of this excavation.' It is certainly strange that whoever dug the pit did not publicize it, since the shape of the pit suggests that it was deliberately designed to expose the structure. In our exposure of the western face of the structure we took great care first to clear only the fill from the previous pit. This was done in order to preserve any remnants of the original deposits that might be still adhering to the western face of the structure. The stone structure when excavated was 75 cm. high and rested on dark brown compacted soil containing large pieces of tepetate (figs. 33, 34). About 25 cm. below the base of the structure the tepetate inclusions in the dark brown soil became much smaller and this layer continued for 25 cm. to solid tepetate (fig. 122 (c)). The structure was made of relatively smooth cobbles set in earth mortar to form a relatively even surface running north-south which slanted slightly to the west from the base to the top (fig. 122 (d) ). That is, the slope was the reverse of that visible in the south wall. By first removing only the fill of the previous pit we found, as we expected, that in the original exposure of the stone structure the western face had not been completely cleaned. Remnants of a sandy water-laid deposit, which was visible in the north and south walls of our pit (the lower extensions of Bays 41N and 41S), still adhered to the face of the structure (fig. 34; also 35). The surface of this sandy deposit is about 50 cm. below the present level of the tunnel floor. The soil layers below the wall formed a surface which appeared to be a continuation of the wall itself. The creation of this apparent surface was probably the result of the excavation of the previous 1 The only reference to a pit in the floor of the tunnel which would have been anywhere near the stone-faced structure is Noguera's comment that Perez had sunk three pits into the tunnel floor at distances of 65, 90, and 115 meters from its entrance (Noguera, 1935: p. 6). The first of these would have been less than 10 meters beyond the stone-faced structure (fig. 118).</page><page sequence="23">VOL. 55, PT. 6, 1965] THE PYRAMID OF THE SUN AT TEOTIHUACAN 23 pit which as mentioned above continued down to tepetate. The exposure of the western face of the structure further supported the conclusion that the stone did not extend as far as the north wall of the tunnel. However, at lower levels the exact northern limits of the wall were difficult to determine because it was necessary to slope both the north and south walls of Trench 1 to prevent possible collapses in this area which, as previously mentioned, was weakened in the 1957 earthquake. The "mystery" pit had been extended about 50 cm to the north at this point apparently in an effort to determine the northern limit of the rocks. Re-excavation of this gouged out area did not disclose any rocks. Subsequent excavation at this point in 1960 by members of the staff of I.N.A.H. of the tunnel running north at right angles to the main tunnel (fig. 118 (5)) did not reveal any evidence that the stone facing had continued to the north.2 In the fill of the "mystery" pit to the west of the stone structure a number of loose stones were found. Many of them were about the same size as some of the smaller stones within the structure itself. The possible significance of these stones will be commented on below. The pottery in the excavations around the stone struc- ture was all of the Tzacualli or Teotihuacan I phase (see Chapter VI). The exposure of the western face of the stone struc- ture in the tunnel floor did not clear up many of the questions needed to interpret the original nature of the structure. It seemed most likely that the stones formed the outer facing of an earth-filled structure, the north- west corner of which was within the lower tunnel. We concluded that part of the structure probably was removed when the tunnel was originally excavated, and that previously its facing resembled in outline the formation of stones in the south wall of the tunnel at this point. The occurrence there of the water-laid sand deposits mentioned above supported the view that the stones formed a surface sloping up from west to east which was open at the top permitting water and sand to filter down through cracks between the stones and the earth backing. If this interpretation were cor- rect the fact that the western face which was exposed in our excavation slopes in the opposite direction might have been the result of warping and bowing under the pressure of subsequent fill used when the pyramid was brought to its present size. Furthermore, the stones along the eastern edge of what was now the top of the structure in the tunnel floor did not form nearly as regular an outline as did the stones along the western edge. Still it was difficult to explain why 2 Excavation of the "mystery" pit in front of the structure effectively prevented us from determining the surface of the ground on which the structure rested. The recent north-south I.N.A.H. excavations should clarify this question. See also figure 34 concerning the problem of the "mystery" stake driven into the "heart" of the structure since the excavation of the tunnel system. no trace of the northern facing of the structure could be found in our exploratory excavations if in fact we had uncovered the northwest corner of the structure. It was still possible that the stone uncovered was part of a formerly freestanding wall that ended or was breached just short of the north wall of the present tunnel. But this seemed unlikely in the context. Excavations into either the north or south walls of the tunnel would have been a major undertaking beyond our capacity in time and manpower. It was decided that whatever further information we could obtain would have to come from excavation on the eastern side of the stone fill. Accordingly we decided to excavate the area between Pit A and the western section of Pit B (Pit C) and that part of Trench 1 directly to the east of the rocks which formed the western face of the stone structure (Trench 1 East) (fig. 122 (a, b), Pit C). Here again excavation was begun in arbi- trary 15 cm. levels pending the encountering of evi- dence for changes in strata. In the time available it was only possible to excavate this area to a depth of 60 cm. Below the level of the original floor of the tunnel, the fill was dense and compact and showed no evidence of having been dis- turbed by previous excavation. In general the fill in this section consisted of dark brown earth relatively free of stone, tepetate fragments, and pot sherds. At a depth of 30 cm. below the present floor of the tunnel a layer of sand was encountered. This deposit seems to correspond in depth to the western portion of the sloping layer of sand visible near the base of Bay 41S. It covered a large portion of the area excavated in the rock structure itself but its outline was irregular. It is also possible that this sand deposit is connected with the sand deposit in front of the stone structure (fig. 122 (c, d) ). The sloping layer of sand near the base of Bay 41S in the earth fill to the east of the stone fill seems to suggest that there was a sloping surface at this point prior to the construction of the rock-face structure. If this had been the case the thicker horizontal layers to the west of the stone-faced structure might be accounted for as deposits formed at the base of this sloping surface. If this interpretation is sound, a trench must have been dug through these sand layers to accommodate the lower courses of the stone fill. This would not, however, explain the presence of the sand within the stone fill itself. As the excavation of the eastern edge of the stone fill proceeded it became clear that the eastern side of the fill had never formed a uniform surface such as that formed on the western side. Thus it is most prob- able that the stone fill formed the facing of an earth- filled structure of some sort. This interpretation of the nature of the structure suggests that the sloping water-laid deposit of sand within the earth fill, mentioned above, may have simply been the result of a heavy rain during the construction of the structure, which</page><page sequence="24">24 MILLON, DREWITT, AND BENNYHOFF [TRANS. AMER. PHIIL. SOC. washed out deposits from a slightly higher level and deposited them at this point. At a depth of 35 cm. below the tunnel floor a small cache of 7 obsidian blades standing vertically was found. It was located 50 cm. from the north wall of the tunnel and 90 cm. east of the western face of the structure. The matrix of the cache did not differ from the sur- rounding dark brown compact soil, and we did not detect any outline of a pit. If we are correct in this, this suggests that the blades were probably placed in position at the time that the structure was being con- structed. Below and to the south of the cache of obsidian blades an obsidian figurine was found standing upright. The top of its head was 42 cm. below the floor of the tunnel. It stood 66 cm. from the north wall of the tunnel and 68 cm. from the western face of the structure, in the northwest "corner" of the structure at the eastern interior edge of the stone facing. The figurine is lenticular in cross section and is thus, in effect, a simple silhouette; it is 12.1 cm. in height. Beginning approxi- mately 4 cm. below the top of its head, the figurine was surrounded, within a radius of about 6 cm., by 40 miniature obsidian points and 11 obsidian fragments extending down to below its feet (figs. 38-40, 93). The points are very small and crudely made and do not appear to have been intended for any utilitarian purpose. A large proportion of the points were lying horizontally when uncovered and most of those that were horizontally placed were pointing toward the fig- urine. In the course of the excavation of the figurine it was necessary to remove it daily from its position in situ. It was so removed and replaced five times before all the associated points had been uncovered. (For various reasons it was clear that if we left it in situ overnight we would run a serious risk of losing it.) It is possible that this removal and replacement of the figurine disturbed some of the points closest to the figurine which had not yet been uncovered. Perhaps even more of the minature points might have been found pointing towards the figurines had we not felt it necessary to follow this procedure. The matrix in which the figurine was found was of the same dark grayish-brown color as the surround- ing soil but it was considerably softer in the immediate vicinity of the figurine. The soil around the figurine contained small scattered fragments of charcoal, decayed wood, fibrous organic material, and a light yellowish granular substance. Again there were no outlines of any sort of pit visible. It would thus appear that the figurine had been placed in position at the time the earth backing of the stone facing was laid down. The figurine was found just a short time before our investigations in the tunnel system of the pyramid were scheduled to end. In order to obtain the maximum amount of information about the figurine and its sur- roundings it was decided that the earth directly below the lowest point reached in the excavation of the figurine would be encased in plaster of paris and removed in a block for further investigation (fig. 41). The area around the figurine was excavated to a depth of approxi- mately 9 cm. below the top of the figurine's head. The figurine was then extracted and a block of earth approximately 25 cm. long, 15 cm. wide and 15 cm. deep, surrounding where the figurine had stood, was removed. Subsequent micro-excavation of this block of earth revealed that the figurine had stood in a circle of small stones which had apparently been formed in order to keep the figurine standing upright. This suggests that when the figurine had been originally placed in position it was intended that it should remain upright and free-standing. It is not likely that the figurine remained exposed for any length of time, however, because it was not possible to distinguish any change in the earth fill below the figurine from that which surrounded it. Five of the miniature points of the total of 40 mentioned above and 3 of the 11 fragments were found in the block of earth removed at the end of our excavation. Two of these points were at the level of the base of the lowest stones surrounding the figurine and one of them was directly under the largest stone of the circle. Apparently a few miniature points were placed in the cache first, then small stones were placed to support the figurine. The figurine was then put in place and a small amount of earth added. As the earth was added additional points were placed in position with many of them pointing toward the figurine. The majority of the points were placed in two levels surrounding the fig- urine (at approximately 4 and 8 cms. below the top of its head). The charcoal that was found in the area around the figurine consisted of very tiny fragments which were scattered throughout the earth fill. The size of the pieces of charcoal and their lack of concentration in addition to the condition of the figurine and associated points indicate that nothing was burned in place when the obsidian offering was made. The fragments of decayed wood and the fibrous material that were found are probably the remains of a root that penetrated this region at a later date. In the process of removing the block of earth in which the obsidian figurine stood, a fragment of a slate figurine was found a few centimeters to the south- east of the obsidian figurine. The fragment consists of the lower part of the body of a type of figurine in which an anthropomorphic figure is represented by means of rather crude incised lines on a flat piece of slate or shale. A number of these figurines were found by Gamio in the upper tunnel excavations (1922: 1: 1: p. 184, L'am. 100). Noguera (1935: p. 47, L'am. 25) illustrates 10 such figurines from the lower tunnel ex- cavations but it is not possible to tell from his account whether or not any of them are from the Adosada</page><page sequence="25">VOL. 55, PT. 6, 1965] THE PYRAMID OF THE SUN AT TEOTIHUACAN 25 offerings found by Perez (1935: pp. 91-92). The legs of the figurine we found are separated by a single deep incision and the incised lines that mark the lower edge of the arms are visible just below the line along which the fragment broke off from the rest of the figurine body. It is difficult to determine whether or not the obsidian blades, the figurine and miniature points, and the frag- ment of the slate figurine were originally intended to form a single offering. As mentioned above the soil immediately surrounding the various finds was of the same nature as the fill used throughout the area to the east of the rocks, and we were not able to distinguish the outlines of a pit or pits. While it is true that the soil directly around the obsidian figurine was not as densely packed as the soil in general in this region some of the miniature points which, as a group, are certainly directly associated with the figurine were found in densely packed soil which is generally characteristic of the area. Thus, at the conclusion of our excavation in this area around Bay 41 it seemed apparent that the stone face that we uncovered beneath the floor of the tunnel formed part of the face of an earth-filled structure. Although this was the most plausible interpretation of the evidence, there remained, as mentioned above, several problematic features for which there were no ready explanations. First, the facing seemed to end just short of the north wall of the tunnel, but if this did in fact indicate that we had uncovered the north- west corner of the structure it was strange that we could find no trace of the north side of this structure which presumably would also be faced with stone. Secondly, we were never able to locate the eastern side of the structure. That is, there was nothing in any of the open bays to the east of Bay 41 which even remotely resembled the stone visible in Bay 41S. However this failure may be simply the result of the fact that all bays on both sides of the tunnel with the exception of Bay 45S are walled up from Bay 41 to Bay 51. In fact in the rest of the lower tunnel east of Bay 41, most of the bays are walled up on both sides and this is true of an even higher percentage of the bays on the south side, where the likelihood that such evidence would be found is perhaps greater (fig. 118). Arql. Jorge Acosta and other members of the staff of INAH subsequently dug tunnels each approximately 15 meters in length, to the north and south at right angles to the lower tunnel at the point where we had exposed the stone structure. Their north tunnel, as previously mentioned, confirmed our conclusion that the stone facing did not extend in that direction. The new south tunnel exposed the structure for a distance of approximately 5 meters to the south, revealing a stone facing which was in a state of disrepair. Its maximum present height is said to be about 1.5 meters. Parts of the stone facing apparently had fallen in front of the structure and deposits of water-laid sand overlay por- tions of it, which has been interpreted as indicating that it was no longer in use when the great pyramid was built. The east-west dimension of the structure remains unknown, but it seems unlikely that it was very great. The additional excavations under the auspices of INAH have established the length of the stone facing in a north-south direction and the evidence for a state of disrepair helps to explain why the decayed root of a tree or bush was found near the figurine offering. But the questions concerning the position of the northern and eastern limits of the structure remain unanswered by our excavation and the subsequent excavations by INAH. The profile of the fill in Bays 37-42N (figs. 121; 23-28) may provide an explanation for the abrupt termination of the stone facing short of the north wall of the tunnel. Beginning in Bay 37N a surface is visible in cross section which rises steadily from west to east. This inclined plane terminates abruptly in Bay 41N and abuts an earth fill whose western boundary rises almost vertically at this point. To the east of this vertical fill line, in Bays 41 and 42N, fill lines of fairly regular and constant slope are visible. It is possible that these features are components of an earth structure of some sort that did not have a stone facing. It is even possible that the inclined plane represents the surface of a ramp that led up to a central section of earth flanked by sections faced with stone. If this were the case, though, it would appear to imply that this postulated central ramp was at least 15 meters wide because the tunnel dug to the north in 1960 ex- tended that distance and did not reveal any evidence for the resumption of the stone facing. The sloping surface must have ended abruptly somewhere within the breadth of the lower tunnel because there is no trace of it in the south wall of the tunnel. This suggests that the end of the stone facing on the north may have coincided closely with the beginning of the inclined plane. The presence of loose stones in the fill of the pit which had been previously excavated in front of the stone facing suggests that the edge of this postulated ramp might have been faced in part with courses of stone running at right angles to the stone facing which we exposed. Further comments on this apparently small structure and its possible relationship to the Pyramid itself will be found in Chapter VII. V. THE PLATAFORMA ADOSADA AND ITS JUNCTURE WITH THE PYRAMID In Perez's report on the excavation of the lower tunnel of the Pyramid, the bulk of his brief account is devoted to the excavation of the first 16.5 meters which lie within the Plataforma Adosada (Perez, 1935: pp. 91-92). A brief review of what he found in that</page><page sequence="26">26 MILLON, DREWITT, AND BENNYHOFF [TRANS. AM3'R. PHIL. SOC. area is relevant at this point. Examination of aerial photographs of the pyramid taken sometime after the excavation of the lower tunnel shows that at the time of excavation the entrance of the tunnel was slightly farther to the west than it is now because the lowest stage of the Plataforma Adosada had not been completely exposed then and the beginning of the tunnel penetrated rubble that was later removed (for example, see figs. 3 and 4). Our measurements of the lower tunnel support this conclusion. Perez states that the lower tunnel extended for 116.5 meters: at the present time the tunnel extends for only 115 meters east of the gate at the western entrance. Features found by Perez are shown in our diagrams and reported in the text in relation to the present entrance and the distances involved are thus 1.5 meters less than those mentioned in his report. All the features and artifacts mentioned by Perez in the first 16.5 meters of his excavation are within the present confines of the tunnel except the stone step which he encountered in the very beginning of his excavation. Within a distance of 3.5 meters from the present entrance Perez encountered "dos pequefias plataformas o escalones de entortado, distantes entre si de 1.80 a 2.00 metros" which were just slightly above the floor of the tunnel. We were not able to locate anything in this area that corresponded to this description. However, the low stone wall that is visible in both the north and south walls of the tunnel about 3 meters from the present entrance may be one of the platforms or steps that he mentions. In the first 3.5 meters from the present entrance, 22 artifacts were found at a height of 1.75 meters above the tunnel floor resting on a surface composed primarily of stone. In the next five meters Perez reports finding seven additional artifacts, but the height at which they were found is not mentioned. In the area between 8.5 and 15 meters, 140 more arti- facts were found, apparently in a cache, at a height of 1.80 meters above the floor of the tunnel. From Perez's description it seems clear that the first 22 artifacts and the 140 artifacts found in the area between 8.5 and 15 meters from the present western entrance formed the contents of two separate caches or offerings. The other seven were probably scattered since their vertical position is not given. However, although the vertical position of the two groups of artifacts is given, they are not located precisely in his report in relation to the western entrance or to the walls of the tunnel. It is difficult therefore to determine what relationship these caches or offerings might have had to the structural features that he mentions or to the structural features that were visible in this area at the time of our in- vestigations. The fact that the westernmost cache was near the top of the tunnel and the two platforms or steps that he mentions as being in this area were near the floor suggests that they were not directly associated. A number of these artifacts are illustrated (Noguera, 1935: LJaminas XXIII-XXVII; Perez, 1935: p. 92). Unfortunately, it is impossible to tell from the captions from which of the find spots within the Adosada a particular piece that is illustrated comes. Of the 169 artifacts said to have been found in the Adosada those illustrated by Noguera appear to number at least 86. The exact number depends on how many of the objects in L'am. XXV actually were found in the Adosada (Perez 1935: 92). The artifacts illustrated include: A variety of obsidian pieces-six human and six "serpent" figurines, points of various sizes, in- cluding very small ones, blades made into knives and drills, and a single small disc (fig. 94). A figurine and two figurine headdresses of trans- lucent quartz. Crude anthropomorphic representations and per- forated discs, pendants, and beads of slate or shale. Basalt plaster smoothers, a flint projectile point, and earspools and beads of diorite, trans- lucent quartz and siliceous stone. A variety of worked and unworked shells. The artifacts made from slate or shale are shown in a single plate (La'm. XXV) which is placed in the middle of the section of plates on material from the Adosada. It bears no designation indicating that any of these objects were found in the Adosada but Perez identifies this plate as one of those containing material from the Adosada (1935: p. 92). Whether any of the anthropomorphic slate figurines were found in the Adosada we do not know. The figurine and the fig- urine headdresses of translucent quartz are of the same type as those found in offerings in the Temple of Quetzalcoatl (Borbolla, 1947). The obsidian figurines are quite similar to those found in the Temple of Quetzalcoatl offerings, and while similar in general ex- ecution they differ in style and details of form from the obsidian figurine which we found behind the stone facing of the small structure described in Chapter IV (cf. figs. 93 and 94). The second and possibly even the first cache found by Perez may be expressions of a widespread tradition in the construction of important buildings at Teoti- huacan. Caches or offerings or their looted remains have been found in a number of such structures directly in front of the center of the staircase (for example, Borbolla, 1947: pp. 62-63; Bernal 1963: pp. 30-31; Sejourne, 1959: fig. 1, lower right, facing p. 7). Perhaps the cache found between 8.5 and 15 meters represented such an offering in front of the facing of an earlier structure. The question of earlier structures within the Plataforma Adosada is discussed further below. It will be recalled from the brief description of the Adosada section of the lower tunnel in Chapter III that there are a number of structural features visible in this section of the tunnel system. The present stone facing</page><page sequence="27">VOL. 55, PT. 6, 1965] THE PYRAMID OF THE SUN AT TEOTIHUACAN 27 of the Adosada is visible just inside the western entrance to the tunnel system (figs. 118; 11). A short dis- tance to the west of this stone fill a low stone wall is visible in cross-section in both the north and south walls of the tunnel (figs. 118 (1); 12). Immediately east of this wall is a short walled-up section 4.2 meters long (Bays 4, 5, and 6). Beyond this there is a section of stone fill extending for a distance of almost 7 meters (figs. 118, 120; 13-15). Within the stone fill is an unusual water-laid deposit, visible in both walls of the tunnel, containing a large quantity of sizeable pottery fragments (figs. 120; 14, 16-17). To the east of the stone fill the tunnel walls reveal the faint outlines of courses of adobes (figs. 120; 18). The juncture of the stone fill and the adobes evidently marks the beginning of the main Pyramid. Within the adobes a second low stone wall is visible in cross section in both walls of the tunnel (figs. 120; 19, 20). Just east of this stone wall the fill visible in the tunnel changes to dark brown, sherd-bearing earth. The main goals of our work in this region were the investigation of the unusual water-laid deposit, and the collection of a sample of pottery from the Adosada which is generally thought to have been added to the front of the main Pyramid in the Miccaotli or Teoti- huacan II phase. In the course of our work we photo- graphed all open bays in the region of the Plataforma and its juncture with the main pyramid (that is, Bays 1, 2, 3, N and S, Bay 7S, Bays 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 N and S). and Bays 13 and 14S. We drew profiles of all the open bays on the south tunnel wall, that is Bays 1-3S and Bays 7-14S. In the course of scraping and cleaning these bays for the drawing of cross sections, we collected all the sherds that were in the loosened fill. We also excavated the water-laid deposits in Bays 8N and S laterally for a distance of 40 cm. within the tunnel walls. This was done for two reasons: first to in- vestigate the nature of this water-laid deposit, and secondly to augment the sample of sherds from the Adosada. In the course of scraping the bays to the east of the stone fill in this region it became apparent that what we originally had thought to be a homogeneous clayey fill actually showed the faint outlines of courses of adobes. These outlines were extremely difficult to discern even under the best lighting we were able to muster in the tunnel. However, we discovered that the outlines of adobes could be made slightly clearer by moistening the surface of the bays with a fine spray of water after the surface had been carefully scraped with a sharp trowel. Even then it was extremely difficult to plot the individual adobes on our profile drawings with the lighting available. Fortunately, the outlines of the adobes did show up in the photo- graphs that were taken of these bays. Outlines that were very indistinct in the gloom of the tunnel were frequently clearer on the photographs. The observations that follow are based on the work that we did in the course of preparing the bays in the Adosada region for photography and in collecting a sherd sample. No excavations of any size were carried out; our conclusions are therefore more than ordinarily provisional and subject to confirmation or revision in future excavations. As mentioned previously, at the western entrance of the lower tunnel what appears to be the present stone facing of the Plataforma Adosada is visible in the upper third of Bay 1, North and South, and the upper western corner of Bay 2, North and South (figs. 118 (1) ; 11). The earth fill below and to the east of this rock surfacing contains a number of fragments of coarse adobe concrete. The first of several suggestions of interior structures within the Adosada itself appears in Bay 3. A low stone wall is visible in cross section in both the north and south walls of the tunnel (fig. 118 (1) ; 12). Its base is 15 cm. above the present floor of the tunnel and rests on light brown sandy loam overlaid by a thin layer consisting mainly of badly decomposed adobe concrete. The wall is 80 cm. high and about 50 cm. wide. The wall appears to be approximately oriented at right angles to the tunnel and thus parallels the western face of the Adosada and the Pyramid. To the east of the wall, in Bay 3, there is a dense dark layer which abuts it and extends up about half its height. Above this the fill surrounding the wall is lighter in color and contains numerous fragments of tepetate, adobe concrete, and pottery (fig. 12). Bays 4, 5, and 6 both North and South are walled up. Perez in his report states that it was necessary to shore up with timbers 9 of the 16.5 m. in the Adosada section of the tunnel because of the danger of cave-ins in the areas in which the fill consisted of stone. It is likely that this 9-meter stretch in which timbering was originally necessary included Bays 1 and 2, and Bays 7, 8, 9, 10 and part of 11. These are the bays in which stone fill is now visible. They cover a distance of between 9 and 10 meters. It is likely that the fill in Bays 4, 5, and 6 was earth. Although this section is almost completely walled up an interesting feature is visible at floor level in Bay 4. On both sides of the tunnel a low mound extends from the wall into the passageway of the tunnel for a short distance. These mounds resemble the fenders of an old-style automobile or the bulges left by the back wheels in many trucks. They are made of adobe concrete but little else can be said about them because the remainder of Bay 4 is walled up. They do not correspond in position to any of the structural features that Perez mentions in his report. In Bay 7S the beginning of the stone-filled area is visible (figs. 118 (3), 120; 13). The fill visible in this bay below and to the west of the rock fill con- sists of what is apparently pulverized tepetate, overlying a layer of dark compacted soil. This change in the nature of fill between Bays 3S and 7S (an interval of 4.2 meters) is quite marked. The line of juncture</page><page sequence="28">28 MILLON, DREWITT, AND BENNYHOFF [TRANS. AME R. PHIL. SOC. between the stone and tepetate fills drops steeply from the upper right-hand corner of Bay 7S to the lower left hand corner. In Bay 8 on both the north and south walls of the tunnel, the stone fill occupies the whole width of the bay at floor level. The juncture of the stone fill and the adobes to the east rises in a more gradual slope from floor level in the lower western corner of Bay 8 to the top of the bay on the western side of Bay 11 (figs. 120; 13-15). The stones of this deposit are in general relatively smooth cobbles of vary- ing sizes. Scattered in the fill are a few small cut stone slabs or la/jas. These latter do not appear to have been placed there by design as there is no apparent order to their position within the fill. In general the stones are tightly packed and are held together by mud mortar. The fill appears to continue uninterrupted above the level of the lintels of the tunnel. It is possible that the juncture of the stone fill and the adobes to the east was stepped (fig. 120). But since the sup- porting pillars between Bays 8 and 9, and 9 and 10 obstruct the indications of this, the matter remains in doubt. The water-laid deposit which is visible in both walls of the tunnel within the stone fill begins 9.9 meters from the western entrance and extends east for a dis- tance of 1.45 to 1.95 meters. This deposit rests on the stone fill about 1.1 meters above the floor of the tunne, and apparently continues above the upper limit of the tunnel wall (figs. 120; 14, 16-17). The base of this deposit on the western side is marked by a smooth, thin, flat stone slab at least 50 cm. wide and about 2 cm. thick (fig. 17). This slab is visible in both walls of the tunnel and continues unbroken both north and south beyond the 40 cm. insets which were made in both walls to obtain sherd samples from the water-laid deposits. Resting on the western edge of the flat stone is a low stone wall consisting of eight courses of small carefully laid out stone slabs (lajas) (fig. 17). The overall height of this little wall is between 20 and 25 cm. This low wall is present in the deposit on both sides of the tunnel and, like the stone on which it rests, it continues beyond the inset which we made in both directions. On the south side of the tunnel there is another little wall of cut stones supporting the east- ern edge of the flat stone. This supporting wall is not present in the section of the deposit in the north wall which we excavated. Thus it appears that the wall of cut stones resting on the western edge of the largc flat stone and the stone itself were continuous before the lower tunnel was excavated, and that the tunnel cut through them. This does not seem to be the case with the wall below the flat stone slab.1 The lajas in it do not seem to have been as carefully laid as those in the upper wall and it is possible that they were only 1 The slab itself need not have stretched across the width of the tunnel in a single piece. There may well have been one or more sections of slab there between the north and south sides of the tunnel. put in places where the stone in the fill on whiclh the water-laid deposit rests did not provide adequate support to keep the large flat stone from tipping. The material within the deposit consists of alternate layers of water-laid sand and water-borne soil con- taining numerous pot sherds. At the western edge of the deposit the layers of water-laid material abut the low wall of lajas resting on the stone slab, but at a slightly higher level the deposits override the wall and continue for some distance to the west. The eastern side of the deposit does not appear to have very distinct limits. The deposits here seem simply to merge with the earth mortar of the stone fill to the east. As mentioned previously, the deposits continue unbroken above the lintels of both the north and south walls of the tunnel. The pottery fragments from this deposit are primarily undecorated and unpolished. A large proportion of them were fragments of cajetes of uniform size and shape. Thus apparently the pottery in this deposit does not represent a random selection. The sherds may have been washed out from a cache at another spot, they may have been placed in this deposit purposely or perhaps they were accidentally broken in or around this deposit and left there. A "Tlaloc" effigy vessel was found in a cavity in the stone fill of the south wall 13 meters from the western entrance and a meter and a half above the floor of the tunnel (fig. 118 (3), 120; 95). It is cylin- drical in form, 10 cm. high and a little over 5 cm. in outside diameter. This vessel is unusual in that "Tlaloc" vessels of this type had not previously been found in the pyramid nor were they thought to have formed part of the Miccaotli assemblage. Of even more interest is the fact that the paste of which it was made closely resembles one of the characteristic Tza- cualli pastes and the vessel presumably dates from the Tzacualli phase. The easternmost group of artifacts found in the original excavation of the tunnel were found on a "small surface," 1.80 meters above the floor of the tunnel. It is possible that the surface referred to was a layer within the water deposited section. When this deposit was excavated by us, some of the layers in it gave the appearance of a firm compacted surface. It is not likely that the "Tlaloc" vessel formed a part of the cache found by Perez, however, because it was found 30 cm. below the Perez cache. The adobes to the east of the stone fill, as mentioned above, are difficult to distinguish clearly. In making the original profile drawings of this section it was not possible to plot in the individual adobes. It was our intention to use the photographs that we took of these bays to locate the adobes on the profile drawings. Since these drawings were later stolen it became neces- sary to reconstruct all aspects of the profiles. But the adobes as shown in the present drawings probably are no less accurate than they would have been in the</page><page sequence="29">VOL. 55, PT. 6, 1965] THE PYRAMID OF THE SUN AT TEOTIHUACAN 29 originals (figs. 120; 18-20). The adobes in this section average about 10 cm. in thickness and run from 18 to 30 or more cm. in length. The courses are not completely clear but it would appear that the adobes had been disturbed; some of them look as if they had been tipped or upended, especially in Bay 1iS. The adobes, like the stone fill to the east, appear to continue uninterrupted above the level of the lintels in the tunnel. They do not continue down to floor level in the tunnel but rest on a layer of brown soil which contains fragments of pottery and obsidian. This fill on which the adobes rest slopes up gently from west to east. The adobes extend to the eastern edge of Bay 12 and it is possible that they continue a short distance further east into Bay 13S. It appears that the j uncture of the adobe section and the earth fill to the east is roughly vertical. The earth fill to the east is a dark compacted soil containing pottery frag- ments. Within the adobe fill a low stone wall appears in cross section in both walls of the tunnel (figs. 118 (3); 120; 19-20). The wall is about 65 to 70 cm. wide; it rises about one meter above the floor of the tunnel and may continue for some distance below the floor. Its western edge is 15.85 meters east of the western entrance to the tunnel. The earth fill on which the adobes rest to the west slopes up gradually to this wall to within 20 cm. of its top. Again to the east the top of the earth fill below the adobes is only 45 to 50 cm. below the top of the wall. The adobes directly above the stone wall appear to be less numerous than in the sections on both sides of the wall at the same height. The material in the section above the wall seems to be slightly lighter in color than the surrounding material. It is therefore possible that the adobes on each side were originally placed in such a way that a space was left between that was only later filled. Interpretation of the structural features in the Adosada section is limited in the same way as in the other sections of the tunnels by the nature of the tunnel system itself. As we have stated before, conclusions about internal structures based simply on what is visible in the open sections of the tunnel walls are very tenta- tive and could only be confirmed by additional major excavations. What follows therefore are simply sug- gestions as to the significance of the features that were visible in the Adosada section when we investigated the tunnel system. Any conclusions about the construction of the Adosada and the relationship of it to the main pyramid depend on first establishing where the main pyramid ends and the Adosada begins within the tunnel. This can only be done by comparing external dimensions of the Adosada with the location of structural features within the tunnel. The western face of the pyramid probably was altered less than the other three sides by Batres in his reconstruction of the pyramid (Bastien, 1951: p. 64). It seems unlikely that exterior measure- ments of the Adosada as it stands at present are grossly inaccurate. From measurements taken from figs. 117 and 125, combined with the dimensions of the first stage of the pyramid at ground level given in Marquina (Marquina, 1951: Lamina 11), the juncture of the main pyramid and the Adosada at ground level was calculated to be between 14.5 and 15 meters from the present western entrance of the tunnel. This coincides closely with the figure given by Perez for the juncture of the two structures-16.5 meters from the entrance as it existed when the tunnels were excavated or 15 meters from the present entrance. In the lower tunnel the juncture of the stone fill and the adobes to the east is 14.4 meters from the western entrance at the top of the tunnel walls. The present exterior ground level is about a meter below the lintels of the tunnel. At this height the juncture of the stone fill and the adobes in the tunnel is almost horizontal and thus it is difficult to locate precisely the juncture at this point. But our calculation of the juncture from exterior measurements performed as described above is only approximate and there is no indication given in Perez's report as to the basis for his estimation of the position of the juncture. In any case we feel that it is likely that the juncture of the adobes and the stone fill marks the edge of the main pyramid and the beginning of the Adosada even though the available measurements, interior and exterior, do not exactly coincide. If the juncture of the adobes and the stone fill does in fact represent the juncture of the main pyramid and the Adosada, a number of problems remain concerning the nature of this juncture. It is generally considered that the Adosada was built at a later period (Miccaotli or Teotihuac'an II) than the main pyramid. If this were the case it is reasonable to suppose that some trace of an original permanent surface of the main pyramid would be visible behind the fill added when the Adosada was built. In general, when structures in Teotihuacan were enlarged or rebuilt no attempt was made to dismantle or remove previous structural features below a certain height; the masonry walls, wall- stubs and staircases of earlier structures were simply built over and utilized as foundations (for example, Batres, 1906: p. 9, fig. 1; Gamio, 1922: 1: 1; Linne, 1934, 1942; Sejourne, 1959). But there is no trace of any surface made of fitted hewn stone as Batres (1906: p. 20, fig. facing p. 20) shows for the surface of the pyramid, nor is there any trace of a former stone staircase. This raises the possibility that, at the time that the fill for the Adosada was added to the western face of the Pyramid, the surface of the main body consisted simply of adobes and was thus similar to other earth-faced structures known from the Pre- classic Period in Middle America, and that there never was a staircase down the center of the first stage (or that a jutting platform, since removed, bore the stair-</page><page sequence="30">30 MILLON, DREWITT, AND BENNYHOFF [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. case). As mentioned in Chapter I, the adobes near the eastern entrance and the adobes near or at the beginning of the Adosada might represent the backing or founda- tion for an outer facing of stone. The latter possibility received some support from the recent excavations of Arql. Ponciano Salazar of INAH on the north side of the Pyramid (see Chapter VII). It is also possible that the stone fill represents part of the original facing of the main pyramid. If this were the case, the fact that the stone fill slopes up from the east to west in Bay 7S may indicate that a structure stood in front of the main pyramid and was covered with the same sort of facing. But here again there is no evidence of anything like a cut stone or plaster facing covering this fill. In addition this would mean that the main pyramid in this section extended a short distance, about 2.5 meters, beyond what it does on either side of the Adosada at the present time. Whatever the nature of the original facing of the main pyramid, the presence of the water-laid deposits in Bay 8 indicates that there was once a structure in front of the pyramid which did not rest against it as the present Adosada does. The space between this structure and the main pyramid must have been open to permit the accumulation of the water-laid deposits, for the deposits appear too extensive to have collected in a covered drain. It is difficult to conceive what the function of the stone slab and the low wall of lajas resting on it could have been. If it was originally part of a drain the drain must have been partially destroyed before the deposits which are visible there now had been laid down, and it is really only the presence of these deposits that suggests the possibility of a drain. Al- though this might be thought to be a natural location for a central staircase the stone slab and the lajas seem too flimsy to have formed a step that could stand much traffic; furthermore if there had been a staircase here it is likely that we would have found more evidence of it than just a single step. The fact that so many of the pottery fragments found within this water-laid deposit represent a single vessel form, a cajete, is also rather puzzling. Since the deposit is water-laid the pottery fragments within it must either have been washed down to this spot along with the other fill or they must have been thrown into the spot as the deposits were collecting. But in neither case would it have been possible for these fragments to have originally come from midden deposit since there is such a high concentration of a single vessel form represented. This suggests, as we have mentioned earlier, that the sherds were washed out from a cache at another spot, accidentally fell into this spot, or were purposely put there. The first alternative would imply that this section of the structure was either in a state of disrepair or undergoing alterations over a con- siderable period of time to allow a deposit at least half a meter in thickness to be built up through water deposition. The second alternative suggests that some activity involving the handling of vessels of this form was going on in this vicinity and that some of them were broken and simply thrown in this spot to be disposed of. This could have happened once or a number of times. The last alternative seems the least likely since there was no evidence that these fragments represent a cache in the water-laid deposit; rather the fragments seem to be haphazardly spread in these deposits. The adobes to the east of the stone fill are not in completely regular courses. But in general they appear to be placed horizontally or almost so, and not diagonally as Batres shows in the report of his restoration of the pyramid (Batres, 1906: facing p. 20). The size of the adobes in this section correspond closely to the size he mentions in his report. The fact that the outlines of individual adobes are difficult to distinguish has been attributed to the great pressure that is exerted on them by the weight of the pyramid (Marquilia in Gamio, 1922: p. 132). It is also possible that this pressure accounts for the fact that the courses of adobes are not completely regular. Or this may be the result of exposure to the elements and neglect, or simply be an indication that the adobes were not laid with any great care in the first place. The fact that the two low stone walls in this section of the tunnel are only a slight distance behind sections of stone fill is perhaps more than a coincidence and may indicate that they had some function in supporting this fill, but since no comparable construction features have been previously reported it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions on this matter. The two walls are very similar in construction and both seem to have been either placed in a foundation trench or covered for a part of their height with earth fill. The stones which make up the walls are similar in appearance to the stones that are found in the fill to the west of the adobes in this region. In neither wall is there any evidence of any sort of smooth surfacing applied to the top or sides. However, it is interesting to note that there were fragments of adobe concrete in the fill above and to the west of the westernmost wall. It is not likely that this concrete was associated with the wall but the concrete itself is similar to the fragments found in Tzacualli fill in the south platform of Plaza 1 in the Oztoyahualco region northwest of the Pyramid of the Moon (Millon and Bennyhoff, 1961). Adobe concrete was apparently used only or nearly exclusively in the Tzacualli phase; thereafter lime concrete was used. The discussion of structures naturally introduces the question of the probable location of the surface on which these structures were built and whether this surface was at ground level. It is possible that the material on which the adobes and the westernmost stone wall rested formed the original surface at its</page><page sequence="31">VOL. 55, PT. 6, 1965] THE PYRAMID OF THE SUN AT TEOTIHUACAN 31 lowest point about 15 cm. above the present floor of the tunnel. However, this layer does contain pottery and obsidian fragments and does slope up rapidly toward the eastern low stone wall (fig. 120). Moreover, the base of this stone wall is below this layer and it may be that the layer in question was put down in the course of construction. Thus it is difficult to say if any of the nearly horizontal layers visible in this area ever formed a surface or not. To sum up, the structural features in the Adosada section of the tunnel system indicate that prior to the building of the present Adosada a structure stood on the same spot but was not directly against the main pyramid. At that time the space between the main pyramid and the structure in front of it was open allowing water-deposited earth to collect there. Possibly the main pyramid was faced with adobes at this time. Another possibility is that these adobes and the adobes near the eastern entrance served as the backing for a facing of stone (see Chapter VII). Later, presumably during the Miccaotli phase, the present Adosada was built. It is also possible that there are three periods of con- struction represented in the Adosada, instead of two. The first construction might have been a structure completely distinct from the Pyramid. The second con- struction might then be the one involving the stone fill, in the trough of which the water-laid deposit built up-this, too, would be an essentially separate structure in front of the Pyramid. Presumably both of these early "Adosadas" would date from the Tzacualli phase. 'The final construction would be the present Adosada, little of which would be exposed in the tunnel, except in the area of the stone fill (fig. 120). VI. CHRONOLOGY The materials used to build the Pyramid of the Sun include a mixture of the ceramics of the Tzacualli phase with ceramics of the earlier Patlachique (Chimal- huacan) phase and with figurines, at least, of the still earlier Tezoyuca phase.' This is the conclusion we reached after examination of the ceramics obtained in our investigations in the Pyramid and in our excavations in Plaza 1, Oztoyahualco, and after other studies in- cluding comparisons with published reports of these ceramics (Kroeber, 1925; Noguera, 1935, 1943; Armillas, 1944, 1950; Castellanos, 1954). We found no ceramics or other artifacts characteristic of the Miccaotli or later phases in our investigations in the Pyramid, except in the admittedly later Plataforma Adosada. Our excavations in Plaza 1, in the Oztoya- 1 The Tezoyuca phase will be described by Michael West on the basis of excavations at Tezoyuca and Chimalhuacan. It appears to represent the H-4 figurine horizon preceding (and slightly overlapping with) the Patlachique phase. (See also Millon, 1957: pp. 16-17.) hualco zone of Teotihuac'an, yielded no definable com- ponent of the earlier Patlachique phase (Millon and Bennyhoff, 1961). The detailed report on Teotihuacan ceramics and chronology which Bennyhoff is preparing will contain thorough analyses of the Tzacualli phase and its sub- phases, as well as of the antecedent Patlachique phase.2 It is our intent here to present only the outline of this part of the chronology of Teotihuac'an as it now appears to us, together with a substantial body of illustrative material which should prove useful to other investigators pending the publication of the detailed report on Teotihuac'an ceramics by Bennyhoff. Most of these illustrations are of materials found in our investigations in the Pyramid (figs. 95, 105, 107-111). However, a number of drawings are of vessels from our excava- tions at Oztoyahualco (figs. 96, 112-116) ; these are included because so little has been known until now of the vessel forms of the Tzacualli phase. Most of the sherds found by Noguera and earlier investigators in the Pyramid were too small to make possible the reconstruction of whole vessel forms; the same was true of our investigations in the Pyramid. For this reason our discovery of a number of caches of broken Tzacualli pottery in our 1957 and 1959 Plaza 1 ex- cavations was important; drawings of most of these reconstructed vessel forms are included in this report. In addition, drawings of some of the figurines found at Oztoyahualco have been included for comparative purposes (fig. 106). For the same reason we are happy to be able to republish several of the illustrations from Noguera's study of the Pyramid (figs. 94, 97- 104). Preliminary ceramic analyses by Bennyhoff provide the basis for the following chronological distinctions which bear on the chronological position of the Pyramid. Tentatively speaking, the Tzacualli phase (Teotihuacan I) appears to differ ceramically from the Miccaotli phase (Teotihuacan II) which follows it in a number of ways. Tzacualli ceramics include: Polychrome wares (figs. 107-109, 113-115) Distinctive orange wares "Eared" censers (fig. lllc) Wedge-rim ollas Rim-shouldered bowls (fig. 112) 2 The material recovered from the new east-west tunnel in the uppermost stage of the Pyramid is reported to contain a very small proportion of sherds and objects dating from the Miccaotli phase (preliminary analysis by Florencia Muller, personal communication; the detailed analysis of this material is being made by Robert E. Smith). This is in contrast to the material recovered in the tunnel system in the Pyramid's first stage. There, analysis of the material from the recent north-south I.N.A.H. tunnel (fig. 118 (5)) by Robert E. Smith lends support to our own and earlier conclusions that the ceramics from this part of the Pyramid precede the Miccaotli phase (personal communication to Millon, July, 1964). For comment, see Chapter VII.</page><page sequence="32">32 MILLON, DREWITT, AND BENNYHOFF [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. None of these appears in the Miccaotli phase. Con- versely Miccaotli ceramics include: Nubbin feet Red-on-yellow brown incised ware Censers with thumb-nail decoration on the body or half-reed punctation on rim flanges Comals None of these appear in the Tzacualli phase. In ad- dition, there are significant differences in frequency between the Tzacualli and Miccaotli phases: Sharply decreasing frequencies of resist or "nega- tive" decoration and of white-on-red decoration from the Tzacualli phase into the Miccaotli Increasing frequencies of the cajete form (fig. 116e), the outflaring rim, and dark polished wares from the Tzacualli into the Miccaotli phase Finally, previously accepted distinctions between Tzacualli and Miccaotli figurines are, in general, sup- ported by our findings, that is, the old distinctions between Teotihuacan I and II figurines substantially agree with our distinctions between the Tzacualli and Miccaotli phases. Again speaking tentatively, the Tzacualli phase appears to differ from the Patlachique phase which preceded it in the following ways: Percentage of decorated wares is much higher in the Tzacualli phase than in the Patlachique Frequency of polychrome and resist or "negative" decoration increases sharply in relation to red- on-yellow brown in the Tzacualli phase Incised red-on-yellow brown bowls with interior decoration are limited to Patlachique (Noguera, 1935: Lam. IX, nos. 1-8) Frequency of the angled-wedge rim olla increases from the Patlachique into the Tzacualli phase Frequelncy of the rounded-wedge rim olla decreases into the Tzacualli phase Presence of vessel supports in the Patlachique phase contrasts witlh their absence in the Tza- cualli phase 3 Solid ceramic "earspools" are rare in Patlachique, absent in Tzacualli In the Patlachique phase there is a predominance of figurines of Noguera's type 2,4 together with type 3 (1935 classifiication) (figs. 98 and 99) Figurines of the above types are progressively replaced in the Tzacualli phase by types 4, 7, 6, 5 and 8 (1935 classifiication) (figs. 100, 103, 102, 101, 104) Differences between the Tzacualli phase and the ensuing Miccaotli phase are based largely on the 3 Saddle feet (Noguera, 1943: fig. 2, nos. 12, 13; Castellanos, 1954: figs. 3, 6) and large hollow feet. 4 Type 2 is restricted here to Noguera, 1935: L'am.

The differences between the Tzacualli phase ceramics and those of the Patlachique phase were initially fornmu- lated by Bennyhoff after comparisons between the ceramics from our Pyramid investigations and those from our Oztoyahualco Plaza 1 excavations where Patlachique ceramics are virtually absent, and after comparisons of these materials with ceramics from the recent excavations at Cuicuilco carried out b:y Robert F. Heizer and Bennyhoff. It was these differenc'es which first led Bennyhoff to recognize the presence of a Patlachique component in the ceramics we had obtained from the Pyramid. Furtlher recognition of the differences between these two phases came from comparisons with Noguera's published material oln this phase as it is manifested in the El Tepalcate site near ChimalhuacAn (Noguera, 1943), comparisons with ceramics from the El Tepalcate site whiclh we collected on the surface in 1962, study of the ceramlics of the Patlaclhique phase found in surface concentrations just beyond the western border of Classic Period Teoti- huac.in (nmentioned below), and b)rief examinlation of the ceramics from El Tepalcate obtained in the 1963 excavations at that site carried on by Michael West. Based on these studies it appears that the deposits of earth and midden used in the construction of those parts of the lower body of the Pyramid visible in the tunnels included ceramics of the Tzacualli phase and, in addition, ceramics of the earlier Patlaclhique phase. Recognition of this mixture was not possible until "pure" deposits of the Tzacualli phase lhad 1)een isolated elsewhere, as they were at Oztoyahualco in 1957 and 1959. It was this mixture which had confounded the problem of the chronological relationship between the two phases, leading to the differing interpretations of Noguera and Armillas discussed in Chapter I. Recognition of the presence of Patlaclhique phase pottery in the Pyramid raised another problem, lhow- ever; for pottery of this phase had not previously been isolated at Teotihuacan, partly for reasons already indicated. If it did not exist at Teotilhuac&amp;an, how did it get into the Pyramid? This problem was resolved in 1963 when sites of the Patlachique plhase were fouild by William T. Sanders and hiis associates oll the lower slopes of Cerro Patlachique, the great mountain which 5 Near the eastern edge of the modern town of Sta.

Presumably the ceramics and figurines of the Patlachique phase found in the Pyramid were introduced into it from this source, that is, by incorporating into the Pyramid midden and refuse left by the people who had made the Patlachique phase pottery and figurines and who had lived in the Patlachi- que phase settlement out of which grew the later city. As mentioned in Chapter III, we collected material from small lhearths in the upper north tunnel for possible radiocarbon dating. These hearths clearly had been made during the period when the Pyramid was under construction and were the only features we found of this nature that appeared to contain enough clharcoal to make collection worth while. Unfortunately, it developed that there was not enough carbon in the ash for dating. However, we also had collected a sample of charcoal and charred wood from the large ash lens in the fill from the pit on the north wall of the upper tunnel a few meters to the west of the hearths (Bays 89-90N) (figs. 57; 123). Since this sample came from ordinary fill material, it was clear that at best a radiocarbon date from it could provide an upper limit for the building of the Pyramid. Even this it could do only if it were possible to evaluate it in the context of other radiocarbon dates for the Tzacualli phase. Plain body sherds in the Tzacualli tradition were found in the ash lens and the surrounding fill. Because of this it was thought that the charcoal, ash, and charred wood collected might have been from contemporary or recent hearths which had subsequently been incorporated in the debris collected to form the fill in this part of the Pyramid. The radiocarbon date from this sample was 1870?75 B.P. or A.D. 80?75 (M-1283, Michigan VIII, Crane and Griffin, 1963: p. 249). A carbon sample was obtained at the same time from the excavations in Plaza 1 in the Oztoyahualco region. This sample was part of Cache 3 which we have now tentatively placed late in the Tzacualli phase.7 The 6 When the significance of these discoveries became apparent and it became clear that it would be desirable to distinguish the new materials from those found at El Tepalcate (Armillas' Chimalhuacan phase), Sanders suggested that the Valley of Teotihuacan manifestation of the phase be named Patlachique after the region in which it had been first isolated. This was agreeable to all concerned. 7 In the description of this sample to be published in volume 6 of Radiocarbon it is stated that preliminary analysis of the associated ceramics suggests that the material in the cache falls into a subphase of the Tzacualli phase earlier than that found in the Pyramid of the Sun (M-1118, Michigan IX, in press). We now believe that the deposit of the cache and the beginning of the construction of the Pyramid occurred at roughly the same radiocarbon date obtained from this sample was 1805 + 120 B.P. or A.D. 145?+ 120 (M-1118, Michigan IX, in press). The only other Tzacualli phase date from the Oztoyahualco region is somewhat earlier (1930? 80 B.P. or A.D. 20+80, Y-644, Yale V, Stuiver, Deevey and Gralenski 1960: p. 57). Dates obtained from two earlier carbon samples from the Pyramid do not, on the face of it, coincide well with these more recent determinations. The earlier samples gave widely divergent dates of 2434?+500 B.P. (484 B.C. +500) and 1519+200 B.P. (A.D. 431?+200) (C-203, Libby, 1955: p. 128). The early date could be explained simply as old charcoal not even necessarily associated with human occupation which had been scooped up along with eartlh fill for the construction of the Pyramid. The range of the standard deviation of the second of these early samples would overlap the range of the samples tested more recently if allowance is made for the fact that no correction was made for the Suess effect in early radiocarbon determinations. (Suess effect calculations suggest that early radio- carbon determinations were 200+40 years too young; Tauber, 1960: p. 6.) In sum, the radiocarbon dates so far available for the Tzacualli phase at Teotihuac'an, although not com- pletely consistent, are consonant with our ceramic chronology and with the present corpus of radiocarbon dates for the late Preclassic Period in other parts of the Valley of Mexico. On the basis of what we now know of external relationships and internal develop- ments at Teotihuac'an, we tentatively envisage the Tzacualli phase as spanning the period A.D. 1-150.8 Based on the same reasoning we would place the beginning of the Patlachique phase roughly one- hundred years earlier, i.e., ca. 100 B.C. VII. CONCLUSIONS It is clear that the history of the Pyramid of the Sun is more complex than it previously had been thought to be. Despite this the Pyramid still appears to have been built to its present height early in the life of Teotihuacan. This conclusion is based on the work of previous investigators, our own work in 1959 and on fragmentary reports of work accomplished since by archaeologists of the Instituto Nacional de Antropo- logia e Historia. What do we mean by "early"? We mean bv this that the construction of the Pyramid appears to have begun before the development at TeotihuacA\n of the time.

Jorge Acosta has just been published (July, 1964). It is thought to date the construction of the Pyramid and is 1640 +150 B.P. (A.D. 310 +150) (M-1124) (Crane and Griffin, 1964: p. 14). If we take the lower end of the range provided by this run, namely, A.D. 160, it would fall at the end of the Tzacualli phase.</page><page sequence="34">34 MILLON, DREWITT, AND BENNYHOFF [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. complex of ceramic features characteristic of the Mic- caotli phase (Teotihuacan II) (i.e., before vessels with nubbin supports had become common; before the customary use on pottery of specular red pigments; before the use of incised lines bounding designs in red- on-yellow backgrounds; before the appearance of thin orange ware; before the shift to the slit-eyed figurines of the type traditionally associated with Miccaotli (Teotihuacan II ); before the manufacture of fully developed florero forms). Our conclusion concerning the beginning of the building of the Pyramid is stated in this fashion to avoid involvement in the still un- resolved question of whether a phase should be dis- tinguished between the Tzacualli phase (Teotihuacan I) and the Miccaotli phase (Teotihuac'an II), or whether the ceramics which suggest this are insufficiently dif- ferentiated from Tzacualli to warrant designation as a separate phase. We believe that the construction of the Pyramid was begun before the emergence of the developed Miccaotli phase because occupation debris character- istic of this phase has not been found in the tunnel system in the first stage of the Pyramid except in the Plataforma Adosada.' However, preliminary reports on the material found in the new east-west tunnel in the uppermost stage of the Pyramid appear to indicate that the uppermost part of the Pyramid was built in the Miccaotli phase. This suggests at least two pos- sibilities: (1) that the Pyramid was built over a period of many years, perhaps fifty or more, during which time the fully developed Miccaotli phase emerged from the earlier Tzacualli phase, and occasional sherds of the later phase became incorporated into the last part of the Pyramid to be built, or (2) that the upper part of the Pyramid was erected in at least two distinct building periods, with the material from the tunnel in the uppermost stage representing the approximate age of a later addition but not necessarily bearing any relation to the construction of the lower part of the Pyramid. We tend to favor the former possibility, and in any case do not believe that the evidence to date can reasonably be used to argue that the entire Pyramid was built in the Miccaotli phase. Pottery as late as the Xolalpan phase (Teotihuacan III) has been re- ported from the outermost portions of recent excavations carried out on the north side of the Pyramid by Arql. Ponciano Salazar of I.N.A.H. But this Xolalpan debris appears not to penetrate the major body of the Pyramid. Firmer conclusions must await the analysis of the upper tunnel material by Robert E. Smith, and perhaps further excavations as well. But at this point it would 1 Robert E. Smith reports that his analysis of the ceramics from the I.N.A.H. excavations in the north-south tunnel in the lower stage of the Pyramid supports this conclusion (personal communication to Millon, July, 1964). appear reasonable to suggest that the Pyramid was begun in a burst of creative activity at the close of the Tzacualli phase, and that its completion was a long process extending into the Miccaotli phase. In terms of our present ideas on chronology this would place the building of the Pyramid of the Sun between 100 A.D. and 200 A.D. Four of the structural features noted in the course of our investigations in the Pyramid deserve comment here. It will be recalled that adobe construction was found near the present outer face of the Pyramid on its eastern side (fig. 124). The possibility was mentioned that this might relate to an earlier structure only a little smaller than the one reconstructed by Batres (Chapter III). The recent excavations by Salazar on the north side of the Pyramid conceivably may bear on this. Possibly the adobes on the east side represent the backing for a facing of stone such as Salazar found behind the Xolalpan phase debris on the north side. If so, no trace of such an earlier stone facing was visible in the tunnel. Moving to the western end of the tunnel system, it seems clear that the Plataforma Adosada had a complex history and that at one time it may have been a separate structure completely detached from the Pyra- mid. Whether the history of this structure begins prior to the Miccaotli phase is not clear. The nature of the stone-faced structure we uncovered in the lower tunnel in 1959 has been clarified as a result of the subsequent excavations of Arql. Jorge Acosta. However, while it was evidently not a structure of great size, its form and dimensions are still unknown at this writing. It appears that it had been allowed to fall into a state of disrepair before or during the building of the great Pyramid over it; perhaps it was also partially robbed of stone during the early stages of such building. Since the stone-faced structure within the Pyramid is an unusual construction at Teotihuacan, it is worth noting that other structures of earth faced with uncut stone and cobbles set in mud mortar are known from the Oztoyahualco zone of Teotihuacan. One such structure was found in a partially exposed state and briefly examined in 1957 and again in 1959. It is situated a little over 400 meters east-northeast of Plaza 1, in square N6W1 on the Teotihuac'an grid (fig. 119). The pottery from the looted area within and around this structure was of the Tzacualli phase. Another such structure was uncovered in the excavations in Mound B, Plaza 1, by Carmen Cook de Leonard and Juan Leonard. The Leonards were kind enough to show us the remnants of this structure or structures within the tunnel system they excavated in Mound B. The Leonards believed the structure to be no later than the Tzacualli phase and perhaps to have even earlier affiliations; they reportedly referred to it as being "similar to the Cuicuilco style" (in Nicholson,</page><page sequence="35">VOL. 55, PT. 6, 1965] THE PYRAMID OF THE SUN AT TEOTIHUACAN 35 1959: p. 306; see also Stuiver, Deevey and Gralenski, 1960: p. 57; Millon and Bennyhoff, 1961: figs. 1, 2). Whether stone-faced construction of this simple type will turn out to be one of the characteristics of the Tzacualli phase or of some part of it remains to be determined. The fourth structural feature in the Pyramid's tunnel system which we encountered and which we wish to comment on here is the one near the center of the Pyramid. Some of the possibilities suggested by the fragmentary evidence from this part of the tunnel system were discussed in Chapter III (for example, the fill lines sloping in opposite directions toward the center of the Pyramid-fig. 123). We remind the reader of the possibility that there may be an enormous tomb concealed here. Recent reconnaissance and surface surveys which we have been carrying on in preparing the map of Teoti- huac'an have provided new information on the size of the site during the Tzacualli phase.2 It now appears that Tzacualli phase Teotihuacan covered an area of between 8 and 9 square kilometers or something over three square miles (fig. 119). We are still not pre- pared to say how intensively this area was settled. The population of Teotihuac'an at this time must have been sizable. If, as now appears to be the case, the construction of the Pyramid was begun towards the end of this phase, and in any event, before the appear- ance of the complement of features characterizing the Miccaotli phase, then the society from which it sprang could have provided the conditions its construction would have required. Tzacualli Teotihuacan, together with the Tzacualli hinterland which William T. Sanders has been investigating, provide the basis for an emerging vision of a Tzacualli society which was both populous and prosperous, in Teotihuacan and in its valley. This in itself can tell us little about how the Pyramid came to be built. The milieu in which a construction of this magnitude was conceived, planned, and executed is not clear to us now. The religion which must have provided the ultimate inspiration for its construction has yet to be isolated and defined. The society whose members labored to build the Pyramid very likely was notably stratified; its leaders must have been able to mobilize large groups of men and effectively dispose of their labor in the construction of this great edifice. At the same time the populace which labored to bring the Pyramid into being must 2 The reader's attention is called to the map of the northern part of the Street of the Dead which has just been published in Mexico (Bernal, 1963: Lam. 1, ff. p. 53). It places the Pyramid in the context of a Street of the Dead spectacularly transformed by the recent excavations of I.N.A.H. (The new map was drawn from the copy of our map which we gave to I.N.A.H. in 1963 to serve as a base map for them and for us on which they would place data from their excavations. While the orientation of our grid is maintained, the grid lines them- selves are not shown. Cf. fig. 117.) have believed that what they were doing in building the Pyramid was fundamentally good and desirable. They must have been strongly motivated to support the religion of Teotihuac'an and they must have believed that the building of the Pyramid was, in some important sense, right. Indeed, if comparative anthropological and sociological studies of living peoples have any validity, we must assume motivation along these lines. We have the completed Pyramid and the continued existence, not to say florescence, of Teotihuacan for at least another half millennium as evidence of it. A society cannot long endure on the basis of force and coercion alone, with fear as the principal source of motivation for its members. Despite the popularity of the Cecil B. DeMille version of the building of civil- ization (forced labor, whiplash and slaves), we believe it would be gratuitous and grossly misleading so to picture the building of the Pyramid of the Sun and the city which surrounded it. Covarrubias, author of the best recent book on ancient Middle America, sets up what we believe to be a false dichotomy in his approach to this question. What seems to have happened is that he over-reacted to the absurdity of the "sweetness and light" approach and in so doing sketched in an equally untenable "chains and slavery" caricature. His comments largely speak for themselves: It has been dogmatically believed that the common people subjected by the city-states of the Classic period lived in a state of blissful peace and prosperity under the paternal rule of benevolent and cultured priests. The very exaltation of the aristocracy, the motivating factor of Maya art-for instance, noblemen shown standing on or in front of a vanquished enemy or a submissive slave-shows that a despotic autocracy must have prevailed (1954: p. 82).... A hypothesis to explain the general character of the Classic period and the social and economic factors that went into its makeup has been attempted elsewhere . . . [and] revolves around the evolution of pre-Columbian society from the simple communalism of the Pre-Classic peasant villages, politically autonomous and free of a top- heavy religious ceremonialism, to the consolidation )f an absolute theocracy of a Pharaonic style, with priest-kings and slaves whose entire life and culture were placed at the service of the state and of religion. The society of the Classic period can perhaps best be understood as a tight aristocracy of feudal-minded and mystic priest-kings, liv- ing in great ceremonial cities, Meccas, surrounded by the thatched huts of their vassals, the common people, whose whole existence was dedicated to the maintenance of their masters and their cult. The art of these people was grandiose and elegant, clearly the product of a dominant elite, in which the common people had little or no partici- pation (1957: p. 118). Clearly this is an exaggerated and distorted view of Classic Period societies in Middle America. In addition, the "absolute theocracy of ... Pharaonic style, with priest-kings and slaves" is a gross distortion of the society of ancient Egypt (cf. Wilson, 1951; Frankfort, 1948; Frankfort and others, 1949). Again it is a case of the Cecil B. DeMille model.</page><page sequence="36">36 MILLON, DREWITT, AND BENNYHOFF [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. The problem of Teotihuac'an origins in the sense of the origins of the Teotihuac'an "great tradition" is related to this. Both comparative evidence from living peoples and archaeological evidence from Teotihuacan argue that the building of the Pyramid of the Sun must have been inspired by a powerful and living faith. We do not know from how large an area people were drawn to participate in its construction. Certainly it is reasonable to conclude on the basis of surface survey evidence obtained by William T. Sanders that populations in a large part of the Valley of Teoti- huacAn and in areas adjacent to it were involved. There is no way of knowing at this point whether pilgrims from outside the Valley of TeotihuacAtn con- tributed to building the Pyramid. Pilgrimage to a shrine area which was at once the seat of a special cult and a market is a well-established custom in Mexico today. The custom was solidly entrenched when the Spanish came and must have had a long history behind it. But we do not know whether it formed at least part of the attraction of Teotihuacan. The ancient city occupied a strategic position; in sprawling across the Teotihuacan valley from foothills to foothills it served as one of the main gateways to the Valley of Mexico for people from the Gulf Coast and the neighboring areas of Tlaxcala and Puebla. Did this strategic position, combined with a growing shrine-market complex, contribute to the growth of Teotihuacan? Certainly other factors must also have been involved; some of them we may never be able to divine. But the strategic position of Teotihuacan must have reacted favorably on its growth. That this strategically located comnmunity became a major shrine, one of pre-hispanic Mlexico's holy places, is clear. What is not clear as yet is whether Teotihuacan was a major market area for central Mexico; and if it was, whether the growth of this market paralleled the growth of Teotihuacan, the holy place, and whether the two fed on each other. By the time Teotihuac'an had reached its apogee, the city itself undoubtedly was the prime center of attraction in the Valley of Mexico, both for Valley residents and for outsiders, not only from neighboring areas and the Gulf Coast but from regions as far away as Guatemala. It must then have been the re- ligious, social, cultural, and commercial center of the Valley of Mexico; very likely it was also the political center during the latter part of the life of the city. Its influence spread over most of Middle America. But during the Tzacualli phase it was only beginning to grow into that position of importance. It was then, presumably, that certain spots at Teotihuac{an began to assume importance as shrines and perhaps began to attract pilgrims on their way elsewhere. Possibly the site of the Pyramid of the Sun had been sacred from the beginning of Tzacualli times or earlier; at any rate it may long have been the site of a small shrine or shrines. The stolie-faced structure in the lower tunnel probably represents such a shrine. Elsewhere we have argued that "there was continuity in 'great tradition' between the builders of the stone- faced structure and the builders of the pyramid during the Tzacualli phase and similar continuity between the builders of the pyramid and the builders of struc- tures on the Street of the Dead erected during the Miccaotli phase" (Millon and Drewitt, 1961: p. 378). We believe that the argument for this continuity still stands and in fact has been strengthened by the evi- dence for the greatly increased size of the Tzacualli settlement.3 In so arguing we do not deny the presence of foreign influences at Teotihuacin. On the other hand, we do not believe that questions concerning the direction of some of these influences (who was in- fluencing whom?) have been analyzed systematically (see Chapter I). We discuss below some of the di- mensions of the problem of influences and their inter- pretation. If we make the substitutions in Covarrubias' termi- nology required to make them consonant with the terminology we have been using (see Chapter I), we shall be able to examine briefly his argument con- cerning the rise of Teotihuacan and certain of its implications. In these terms he argues that during the Tzacualli phase there came into being at Teotihuacan a society composed of an indigenous, subordinate pop- ulation, "common people," and a superordinate "incip- ient elite," apparently of foreign origin, although he does not say so explicitly or suggest where they might have come from. (If it were his intent to suggest that 3Another significant continuity in religious practices between the builders of the Pyramid and the builders of the Temple of Quetzalcoatl in the Ciudadela should be pointed out, namely, the fact that sacrifices of children were associated with the four corners of both of these structures. Batres reports of his excavation of the Pyramid of the Sun that he found in each of the corners of the four (sic) bodies of the Pyramid the skeleton of a child approximately six years of age. He claims that these skeletons were all squatting and facing outward in the direction of the angle formed by the corner in which each was buried (Batres, 1906: p. 22). He presents a macabre perspective sketch of the Pyramid to illustrate what he found (Batres, 1906: unnumbered figure ff. p. 31). It shows seated skeletons on the corners of each of the first three bodies of the Pyramid. Excavations in the Temple of Quetzalcoatl revealed the pres- ence of pits beneath each of the four corners of that structure. Each of these pits contained the skeleton of a child, along with a small offering (Armillas, 1950: p. 44; Marquina, 1951: p. 87). Possibly these children were sacrifices to the god of rain; children were sacrificed to Tlaloc, the Aztec god of rain, at the time of the Spanish Conquest (Caso, 1958: p. 42; Sahaguin, 1950: pp. 38-39; 1956: 1: p. 89 (Bk. I, Appendix, Par. G, ff. Ch. 16); 1951: pp. 1-2; 1956: 1: pp. 109-110 (Bk. II, Ch. 1)). The central motif represented twice on the cylindrical vessel from Cache I, Plaza 1, Oztoyahualco, may be another instance of continuity in symbolic art between the Tzacualli phase and later Teotihuacan art (figs. 96a, b). It is possible that this motif is an early version of the glyph which Caso identifies as "ojo de ave" ("bird's eye") (Caso, 1937: p. 141, fig. 10; see also Hall, 1962: pp. 246-247, figs. 8, 14).</page><page sequence="37">VOL. 55, PT. 6, 1965] THE PYRAMID OF THE SUN AT TEOTIHUACAN 37 this "incipient elite" developed indigenously, we would have no quarrel with the essentials of the remainder of his interpretation.) The culture of this "incipient elite" was Olmec-derived and involved a modified ver- sion of the Middle Preclassic Period Olmec style. Covarrubias' discussion of the culture of this "incipient elite" is not clear. He seems to feel that Olmec style stone masks underwent stylistic changes which gradually transformed them into the characteristic Classic Period Teotihuacan stone masks and that part of this process of transformation took place in the Tzacualli phase (Covarrubias, 1957: pp. 134-136, figs. 48, 56). Covar- rubias' stylistic argument may well be sound. His argument for the presence of the transitional form of stone mask in the Tzacualli phase so far has re- ceived little support from controlled excavations (for possibly transitional forms presumably dating some- what later, see Batres, 1906: p. 17, fig. 11 and Borbolla, 1947). But this is not at all conclusive, for few Tzacualli phase structures have yet been excavated. We suspect, as a matter of fact, that Covarrubias' argu- ment concerning an Olmecoid component at the base of the Teotihuacan tradition is sound and will be veri- fied.4 We find his argument concerning the Olmec ancestry of the manner of representation of the Teoti- hua6cn Rain God ("Tlaloc") to be persuasive (see, for example, Covarrubias, 1957: p. 62, fig. 22; 1946: pp. 168-170, Lam. 4). We are not equally persuaded, however, that "Tlaloc" arrived in Teotihuacan with the Miccaotli phase, as part of the cultural baggage of a new elite from the Gulf Coast (Covarrubias, 1957: pp. 125, 133). Granted that his representations are stylistically derivative from the Olmec tradition, the antecedents of the Teotihuacan Rain God lie, we believe, in the Tzacualli phase (Millon and Drewitt, 1961: pp. 377, 378, fig. 5). Covarrubias' argument seems to be that the beginning of the Tzacualli phase was marked by the intrusion of an "incipient elite" (from sources unspecified). This "elite" would have established itself over the populace whose potters made the ceramics of the Patlachique phase. The contrary argument is that Tzacualli phase Teotihuacan is an essentially indigenous outgrowth of Patlachique phase Teotihuacan (see Chapters I, VI). What bases are there for making a choice between these alternative hypotheses? The great size of Tza- cualli phase Teotihuacan has in one sense pushed the problem of the origins of Teotihuacan back a step. Covarrubias was able to write shortly before his death in discussing his Teotihuac'an I phase (our Tzacualli phase): The first period [at Teotihuac'an] is elusive and mysteri- ous, and, to date, its remains have not been found in situt at TeotihuacAn except in the fill of the Pyramid of the Sun. (Covarrubias, 1957: p. 127) 4 What appears to be the earliest formulation of this point of view appears in Caso, 1942. See also Covarrubias, 1942. Since he wrote this, excavations in several Tzacualli phase structures have been carried out and surface survey has demonstrated that Tzacualli phase Teoti- huacan covered an area of approximately three square miles. Tzacualli phase Teotihuacan has in fact grown so large that its antecedents now pose a problem. A few years ago the lack of a well-defined zone of Tzacualli occupation at Teotihuacan was used as an argument for an intrusion from the outside at the beginning of the Miccaotli phase. This argument has been disposed of so well that it has created another problem-the problem of the antecedents of Tzacualli phase Teoti- huacan. At this writing the extent of the Patlachique phase settlement at Teotihuacan is not known. The area we have examined covers less than a square kilo- meter but its eastern limits remain to be defined. Does the growth of Tzacualli phase Teotihuacan from the Patlachique phase settlement seem reasonable? We tend to think that it does, pending further investi- gations. In the first place, Tzacualli Teotihuacan does not appear to have been so densely settled, at least not uniformly, for all its great size, as to appear anom- alous in relation to Patlachique phase Teotihuacan. Secondly, Patlachique phase Teotihuacan is not only a respectably large settlement, even in its present state of incomplete definition, it is also a settlement which appears to contain at least several stone-faced platform structures of moderate size, structures which appear to indicate that some tradition of building in stone ex- isted in this phase. But what of the argument for the arrival of an "incipient elite" which marked the beginning of Tza- cualli phase Teotihuac&amp;an? At the moment this hypothe- sis can be neither proved nor disproved. What about the Olmecoid strain presumed to be present in Tzacualli phase Teotihuacan? The appearance of this putative influence at Teotihuac'an does not require and need not imply the immigration of a foreign elite. During the Middle Preclassic Period, strong Olmec influences were manifest in the Valley of Mexico, notably at Tlatilco and Tlapacoya, and in surrounding areas, notably Morelos and Puebla. During the Late Pre- Classic Period, Covarrubias argues that an Olmec-de- rived style continued to find expression in the Valley of Mexico and Puebla as well as in Veracruz and part of Guerrero (1957: pp. 131-136). If this is true, the spread of this style (and attendant cults?) to a rapidly growing Teotihuacan seems entirely plausible. Its transmission by an "incipient elite" of foreigners from an unknown source, while possible and subject to em- pirical verification, is not necessary to "explain" the growth of the city and is difficult to defend. The same is true of other attempts to bring new people into the Valley of Teotihuacan to "explain" the presence of foreign influences manifest or said to be manifest there. Even the almost explosive suddenness with which Tzacualli phase Teotihuacan grew is not sufficient to</page><page sequence="38">38 MILLON, DREWITT, AND BENNYHOFF [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. establish a case for foreign intruders. We know little about the social and cultural conditions which underlay and which supported and fostered this near phenomenal growth. Nevertheless, on the basis of the evidence at hand, there is no intrinsic reason why such growth could not have taken place without the guidance and inspiration of an "incipient elite" of foreigners. In- fluences must have been absorbed; social and cultural transformations may have been kaleidoscopic; outsiders may have provided important leavening; but the elite which must have existed in the latter part of the Tzacualli phase was largely home-grown, we suspect. In any event, this elite, home-grown or otherwise, presided over a settlement covering three square miles within which there were a number of ceremonial structures. If present evidence is to be believed, some among this elite had audaciously conceived of building a pyramid many times larger than anything then ex- isting elsewhere in Middle America or in the rest of the New World. In addition it appears that the members of this elite had formulated a workable plan for executing the construction of the immense Pyramid of the Sun and were engaged in carrying out the largest con- struction project up to then attempted in the New World. It is at this juncture that Covarrubias wants to bring another elite into Teotihuacan. This "new elite," he postulates, brought with it "an almost abstract, symbolical art and a highly intellectualized cult of a rain god who was at the same time a jaguar." The ''new elite" came from "the Gulf Coast where many traits common to those of Teotihuacan appear in early times" (Covarrubias, 1957: pp. 125, 133, also 39). We do not dispute that Teotihuacan society and culture were influenced in the Miccaotli phase by con- cepts foreign to the Teotihuac'an tradition as it had developed up to that time. This was a time of ex- plosive growth in Teotihuacan and very likely a time of receptivity to foreign ideas. This may have been the most exciting period in the history of Teotihuac'an, and one of the products of this ferment may have been the mature Teotihuacan style, a style less susceptible to outside influences but not nearly so impervious to them as has sometimes been suggested. (For evidence of continuing receptivity to outside influences in Teoti- huacan mural art, see Hall, 1962.) But the receptivity to foreign ideas which we suggest may have occurred or begun during the Miccaotli phase need not imply the domination of Teotihuac'an by foreign priests or other intruders. Teotihuacan was then on its way to becoming the most influential center in central Mexico. To argue that it may well have been receptive to new ideas during this period of growth is not to argue that these new ideas must have been introduced by outsiders who "took over" the city. Even if outsiders were incorporated into Teotihuacan society, and this is certainly a lively possibility, there is no reason on the basis of existing evidence to postulate that they came in at the top. In short, we are not arguing that Teotihuacan was a closed society; we are, however, arguing that this picture of an open, receptive, vigorous society, absorbing influences from many directions and transforming them into a dis- tinctive synthesis, does not require the leadership of a foreign elite to "explain" it. Covarrubias argues that there are two distinct com- ponents in the Teotihuac'an style, one of which is derived from the Tzacualli phase, and the other and dominant one derived from the Gulf Coast. The former, he believes, was never incorporated into the cultural heritage of the "new elite" he derives from the Gulf Coast, and hence was never carried by them to Kamninal- juyu in highland Guatemala where Teotihuacan in- fluence manifested itself in profound form during the Esperanza phase in the Early Classic Period. Teoti- huacan style pottery and architecture are conspicuous in Esperanza phase Kaminaljuyu but notably absent, Covarrubias stresses, are certain elements of the Teoti- huacan tradition typically found at Teotihuac'an itself (clay figurines, stone masks, statuettes, and old fire- god braziers). Covarrubias suggests that these elements are absent because they are part of the cultural heritage from the Tzacualli phase which continues into the later history of Teotihuacan, but which never became part of the culture of the "new elite." In speaking of the evidence from Kaminaljuyu he writes: This supports the theory that the style and the religious concepts of Teotihuacan were brought to the Valley of Mexico by an elite that had to make important concessions to the existing culture of a large, established population. These people who had traces left of the "Olmec" culture, made clay figurines and carved masks, statuettes and fire gods, and provided the Teotihuacan priesthood with serfs and the manpower to build their great city (Covarrubias, 1957: pp. 136-137). The "new elite" replaced the "incipient elite" and the "incipient elite" became serfs. Maybe . . . but we would like to see solid evidence to support this al- together remarkable formulation. Perhaps evidence will be forthcoming that will make it possible to dis- tinguish the influence of ideas and concepts from the movements of men and elites. Until such evidence is forthcoming, we find it more difficult to envisage the curious accommodation pictured by Covarrubias than to envisage the explosive growth of the Miccaotli phase as the product of indigenous processes of devel- opment occurring in a wider environment of exceptional creativity. Clearly Teotihuacan had become a highly differenti- ated society by the time its influence appears at Kaminal- juyu. This differentiation into what may well have been different "life styles" and the impress of the most prestigious of these is probably what we are seeing at Kaminaljuyu. But this need have no bearing at all</page><page sequence="39">VOL. 55, PT. 6, 1965] THE PYRAMID OF THE SUN AT TEOTIHUACAN 39 on any foreign elite at Teotihuacan. It could just as easily be the product of internal differentiation. We find it difficult to see the leaders of what may well have been the New World's largest settlement and one in the process of vigorous growth, turning over leadership to outsiders, however prestigious. That such a situation could occur is conceivable. That it did seems to us unlikely on the basis of existing evidence. Perhaps these differences in interpretation stem from the fact that some have difficulty conceptualizing beginnings and processes of growth and development, and so are inclined to invoke a deus ex machina when confronted with such a situation. Conversely, perhaps we find it difficult to visualize processes of hybridization and cross fertilization and so are prone to argue that monads have windows but no doors. Or perhaps our involvement in Teotihuacan is so great that we do not see where others would. Certainly it is true that we believe the solution to most of the developmental problems in Teotihuacan society and culture that can be formulated now lies at Teotihuac'an. This has been our working hypothesis for a number of years and it has proved to be a productive one. While much more work remains to be done in the Pyramid before its history will be unraveled, we believe that we have clarified certain questions while admittedly raising others. The reports of the INAH excavations in the Pyramid, together with the reports on the massive INAH program of excavations on the Street of the Dead will greatly enrich our understanding both of the Pyramid and of Teotihuac'an. To a lesser extent and in a different way, the Teotihuacan map in which we are now engaged will enrich our under- standing both of the Pyramid and of the city which it dominates. The next several years should see major interpretations and reinterpretations of Teoti- huac'an society and culture. In the course of this the history of the Pyramid and the nature of Teoti- huacan society should emerge more clearly.</page><page sequence="40">REFERENCES ARMILLAS, PEDRO. 1944.
