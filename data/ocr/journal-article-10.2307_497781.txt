<plain_text><page sequence="1">1928 January-June ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS' SUMMARIES OF ORIGINAL ARTICLES CHIEFLY IN CURRENT PUBLICATIONS EDWARD H. HEFFNER, Editor University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS Development of the Plastic Arts.-In Mannus xx (1928), pp. 1-24, JOSEF STRZYGOWSKI, in an article entitlcd Natur und Unnatur in der bildenden Kunst, advances a new theory of the historical development of the plastic arts. Begin- ning with some observations on art as manifested in nature itself in symmetry and proportion, he insists that too great emphasis has been laid on the collection and study of the extant remains of the powerful peoples of the temperate zone, whose rulers imposed their will on sculptors, painters, and artists generally. He com- pares this period to that of the great naturalists and collectors of the last century in the field of the natural sciences. He would divide the world into the three great belts of the equatorial zone, the middle zone, and the northern, and thinks that great light is to be cast on the beginnings of art in the two zones where perishable materials were the vehicles of artistic expression. He excepts the Greeks from his strictures, in maintaining that they brought from the north their artistic gifts. So, too, in Spain, at Alpera, of the province Albacete, he attributes the high skill of primitive artists to a similar influence from the north, though he admits that this is hypothetical rather than proven. Early Magnifying Glasses.-In Ant. J. viii, 3 (July 1928), pp. 327-330 (1 fig.), H. C. BECK gives evidence of the early existence of magnifying glasses. Rare pieces of round glass have been found in Egypt, one of which, in the Ashmolean collection, is claimed to be of the First Dynasty, if not Predynastic. The most conclusive proof of the very early existence of magnifying glasses is the discovery in Crete of two crystal lenses dating as early as 1200 B.C. at least, and probably 1600 B.C. Eighteenth-Century Notes of Travel in the Near East.-A collection of note- books, diaries, sketch-books, etc., relating to the journey in Greece and Asia Minor made in 1750-1751 by Robert Wood, John Bouverie, and James Dawkins, with an Italian draughtsman named Borra, has come into the possession of the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies, and a selection from them, with comments, is published by C. A. HUTTON in J.H.S. xlvii, 1927, pt. 1 (pp. 102-128; 6 pls.; 5 figs.). The Englishmen were excellent classical scholars and men of cultivated tastes, Bouverie being more especially the archaeologist of the party.

The party started from Naples in May, 1750, and visited Smyrna, Sardis, Cyme, Pergamon, Constan- tinople and the shores of the Propontis, the plain of Troy, Tenedos, Lesbos, Teos, Ephesus, Samos, Priene, Magnesia ad Mwandrum, Tralles (where Mr. Bouverie died of a fever), Nysa, Laodicea, Hierapolis, Aphrodisias, Alabanda, Mylasa, Euromus, Halicarnassus, Cos, Ceramus, Cnidus, Rhodes, Egypt (Cairo, Pyramids, Saccara, Alexandria), Palestine (many sites), Damascus, Palmyra, Baalbek, Cyprus, lassus, Didymus (?), Delos, and Athens, whence they made a tour with Stuart through Attica, Eceotia, Delphi, Corinth and the northern part of the Peloponnesus, returning through Eleusis to Athens. Their descriptions and the drawings of these sites and the then existing ruins of ancient cities are of the utmost value and interest, historically and archaeologically. Genesis of the Potter's Art.-In lMannus xx (1927), pp. 285-295 (5 figs.), FRANZ LANGER discusses the genesis of the potter's art before the invention of the potter's wheel. The chance location of a fireplace on clayey soil or the accidental burning of children's clay toys probably led to the discovery that clay was hard- ened by fire into an almost indestructible condition. Only small and flat vessels could be made by hand from a ball of clay. For larger vessels a wicker-work form was lined with clay and the burning of the woven reeds or basketry helped in the firing. The impress of the weaving gave a primitive adornment to the vase, which was later imitated by tooling. Gourds and leather bags or bottles lined with clay and then filled with sand or hot coals gave many new shapes to the artist. Large jars were made by building up on a circular flat base successive rolls of clay in rings that were allowed to dry and harden till the desired height was reached. These were probably produced wholesale, not by individuals for their own use. The author quotes freely from other authorities. By the time of the later Stone Age the art had already reached a stage of high development. The Horse of Sardis.-In The Art Bulletin x (1927-28), pp. 215-230 (2 pls.; 20 figs.), T. L. SHEAR publishes the life-size horse's head of marble discovered at Sardis on the last day of the excavation campaign of 1914. Although this disap- peared during the war, the photographs show it to be a magnificent representation of an Anatolian breed of horse long cultivated and from which the modern Arab breed is descended. The breed was already represented in Hittite art, it appears in Lydian art, and, because of the relations with Greece growing out of the Persian expansion, it became standard for Greek art, where it reached its highest glory and influence in the Parthenon frieze. Some Ancient Weapons.-In R. Arch. xxvii, 1928, pp. 254-277 (38 figs.), PAUL CoUIssIN discusses some ancient weapons recently discovered, after calling atten- tion to the importance of the study of arms in general. He finds that the weapons found at Mallia in Crete (Jean Charbonneaux, Mon. Piot xxviii, 1925-1926, pp. 1 ff.) are not parade weapons (armes d'apparat). The dagger is of a very well known and widely used type. The sword has a richly decorated hilt which was once covered with gold wrought in repouss6 and was attached to the blade only by four rivets. But arms have always been decorated, and the rivets are sufficient, since the Minoan sword was used only for thrusting. Other similar swords are cited in comparison. The axe or hatchet is of schist and is decorated with a spiral pattern. The butt end has the form of the head, shoulders, and forelegs of a panther wearing a harness. This axe is a combination of a beast-god (perhaps the totem of a tribe) and a weapon-god. It was probably set on a slender upright shaft and worshiped. Weapons from other places are compared with this. An axe found at Beisan, in</page><page sequence="3">504 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XXXII, 1928 Palestine (R. Bibl., 1927, p. 98; Syria, 1927, p. 187), has a curved, wave-like shape and the butt end terminates in four points. This, with an axe figured in a relief at Boghazkeui and one from Syria, form a group the centre of which appears to be Asia Minor. A so-called arrow head found at Nabatiye, Lebanon (Milanges de 1' UniversitU S. Joseph, xi, no. 7; Syria, 1927, p. 185), bears an inscription which is translated "the arrow of Addo, son of Akki." An inscription on an arrow head, which, when once shot, is lost, is peculiar. This object is about 12 cm. long. It may be a votive arrow head or perhaps a javelin head. At Neirab, Palestine, some arrow heads and a sword were found (Syria, 1927, p. 208). Unfortunately their dates are uncertain. The arrow heads are of common types. The sword is of one piece, both blade and hilt. The latter was once covered with plates of a non-metallic material. The weapons of the Jogassess, Marne (R. Arch. xxv, 1927, pp. 326 ff.; xxvi, 1927, pp. 88 ff.), do not show a break between the culture of Hallstatt and that of Latlne, but a development. The belt with nail-head studs is a part of feminine apparel in the Hallstatt period, but appears in the first century B.C. on men. ORIENTAL AND CLASSICAL EGYPT The Ficoroni Medallion and Other Gilded Glassin the Metropolitan Museum.- In The Art Bulletin ix (1926-27), pp. 352-356 (6 figs.), J. BRECK publishes several examples of gilded glass in the Metropolitan Museum. The recent establishment by de M6ly of the Egyptian origin and probable third-century date of the famous medallion at Brescia makes it possible to give the same origin and date, approxi- mately, to the related Ficoroni medallion and another newly acquired medallion in the Metropolitan Museum. The Brescia medallion has occasionally been sus- pected, but its Greco-Egyptian word terminations combined with its mention in a seventeenth-century inventory rule out the forger. Papyri.-In Sitzb. Preuss. Akad. IWiss. (Berlin) xxvi-xxvii (1927), pp. 270-276, ULRICH WILCKEN gives a larger significance to the seven Michigan papyri letters published by J. G. Winter in the Journal of Egyptian Archaeology xiii (1927), p. 72 ff., by identifying the bravopOwris 'AXLXXEb6 with the usurper slain at Alexan- dria in the revolt against Diocletian. Winter, though he noticesthe resemblance in name, interprets epanorthotes as meaning corrector juventutis, 'one charged with revision of the service lists.' Wilcken translates the word 'reformer' or 'restorer' and supports his interpretation by an Alexandrian inscription of, he admits, decidedly uncertain meaning. It reads: .I II H Hot, ZEfaaroi3 'EreI T^ K lrl KXavblov r4ipypov I Xaprrporirov iravopOwroi, where he thinks the emperor's name has been erased and the usurper's added. The seven letters, read in this light, indicate that a certain Paniskos, who had gone to Koptos on other business, had become implicated in this new uprising and sends to his wife for his arms (Winter had regarded him as a dealer in arms), and endeavors to get other men (cf. yr&amp; Avppca'r w aXwjv), including his wife's brother to join him there. Koptos had been the centre of an earlier revolution and had been destroyed a short time before (293 A.D.). Some Types of the Nude Goddess.-In R. Arch. xxvii, 1928, pp. 36-49 (13 figs.), M. PILLET discusses some rude terracotta figurines found in 1922 at Karnak in surroundings which fix their date from the fourth to the sixth century A.D. Some are grotesques, derived perhaps from representations of the god Bes. The others</page><page sequence="4">ASSYRIA, ETC.] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 192S 505 represent the nude female form and are divided into three categories. In the first the arms are short and extended horizontally. The navel is enormous and the sex is represented by a great triangle sprinkled with dots. The legs are separated by a line and end in a point. The face is hardly indicated, and the eyes are pellets added after the rest. The breasts are conical. The second category contains figures similar to the first, except that the hips are more developed, and a mass of hair falls over the shoulders. The arms are sometimes curved, joining the hips and looking like the handles of a vase. The figurines of these two categories are modelled separately, not made with a mould. The figurines of the third category are hollow, moulded in two pieces. The body is rounded, the breasts projecting slightly. The short arms are sometimes raised, sometimes mere projections or bosses. The head is surmounted by a great conical helmet. Black paint marks the features and ornaments the body. These figurines are similar to others found in various places in Egypt and also in other countries. The nude goddess is prob- ably of Aegean origin, not Oriental, and such figures found in Mesopotamia are probably not very early. The date of such crude works can be determined only by careful examination of the objects found with them, and the earth of ancient sites has often been so overturned as to make the dating difficult. Methodical classification of all such objects and careful recording of all indications of date are greatly needed. ASSYRIA AND BABYLONIA A Crowned Head and a Statue of a Child from Mesopotamia.-In B.S.A. xxvii, Session 1925-1926, pp. 113-123 (pl.; 2 figs.), A. W. LAWRENCE publishes two monuments from Mesopotamia which are purely Hellenic in subject. These are in the Assyrian room of the British Museum. A bearded head of marble, about two-thirds of life size, is represented as wearing a crown in the form of olive leaves with a rosette clasp. This was probably a golden crown. The style of the head, and especially the great size of the eyes, show that Asiatic influences have affected the work of the sculptor. Comparison with Parthian coins and other objects justifies us in assigning this work (probably from an honorary portrait statue) to the Parthian period of the late second or first century. The statue of a boy of perhaps two years of age is of terracotta and measures, with the base'upon which the child sits, 0.37 m. in height. The base is semi-circular, the rounded part being in front. The child is nude, save for a cord passing over the right shoulder and under the left arm. A round object is attached to the cord near the neck. The outstretched hands apparently held objects one of which was probably a bird. This figure, being very like a torso from Borsippa, is doubtless of Babylonian origin. A very great number of figures of children is preserved, and they have been found in many regions of the ancient world. Some of these may represent infant deities, but nearly all may be regarded as votive offerings to some deity in thanksgiving for the birth of children. Comparison with statues of children of various dates shows that this terracotta (as well as the other, from Borsippa) be- longs to the Seleucid period when Mesopotamia kept closely in touch with the larger Greek centres. The Laws of Deposit in Early Babylonia and in the Old Testament.-In J.A.O.S. xlvii, 1927, pp. 250-255, I. M. PRICE discusses the laws in regard to trusts, deposits, agents, carriers, etc. as they are exhibited in the Code of Hammurabi, and in Old Babylonian contract tablets; and compares with these the laws on the same subjects in the earliest Hebrew legislation. He comes to the conclusion that the latter agree entirely with the Babylonian system, except that they are more crudely expressed and that the penalties are slightly modified.</page><page sequence="5">506 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXXII, 1928 Polynesian Words in America and in Sumer.--In Mitt. Vorderas. Ges. xxxi, 1926, part 2, pp. 1-127, E. STUCKEN shows that Polynesian dialects closely similar to one another are spoken over an area 2000 of longitude in breadth from Mada- gascar and Formosa to New Zealand and Easter Island. He presents a large body of evidence to show that Polynesian influence appears also in the languages of Mexico, Central America, and Peru. For instance, the word for 'butterfly' in Maori is purehua; in Tahiti, purehua; in Peru, parahu; in Guatemala, porosh. Another word for 'butterfly' or 'moth' in Maori is pepe; in Tahiti, pepe; in Guatemala, pepe; in Mexico, papalo. Such facts seem to show that there is a genetic affinity between Polynesian and some of the languages of America. On the other hand, Stucken is struck with numerous resemblances of Sumerian, the primi- tive language of Babylonia, to Polynesian: for instance, Sumerian ku, 'eat'; Polynesian, kai; Mexico, qua; Sumerian gish, 'wood'; Polynesian, kas; Sumerian, nun, 'great'; Polynesian, nunu, nunui, or nui. He gives a comparative table of over two hundred words that are similar in Sumerian and in Polynesian, and comes to the conclusion that the resemblances are too numerous to be accidental. There must be some historical connection between Polynesia and Sumer and America. One hypothesis is that the Polynesians originated in southeastern Asia and spread in two directions as far as Sumer and America. Another theory is that the Sumerians carried their commerce as far as Polynesia and established colonies there in pre-historic times. A third theory, to which Stucken inclines, is that Polynesia is the residue of a sunken continent in the Pacific. Here there originated a civilization that, with the subsidence of the continent, spread as far as Sumer in the East and America in the West. The stepped pyramid, which is found only in Babylonia, Egypt, Polynesia, and America, is a vestige of this civilization. Small Sculptures from Babylonian Tombs.-In Mus. J. (Univ. of Pa.) xix, 2 (June 1928), pp. 195-212 (18 figs.), LEON LEGRAIN discusses the above subject. A study is made of the nude female type in its significance as symbol, charm, and, finally, divinity. The influence on Greece, and of Greece in return, and the later development are treated. There follows a presentation of a number of figurines in illustration with notes and a discussion based, as Dr. Legrain says, largely on the still supreme treatise in the field, the catalog by L. Heuzey, Figures antiques de terre cuite du Mus&amp;e du Louvre. A good digest of this rather fascinating subject is provided in Dr. Legrain's study. The Sources of Sumerian Civilization.-In R. Arch. xxvii, 1928, pp. 90-104, AMELIA HERTZ discusses the influence of the Proto-Elamite civilization upon the Sumerians. She compares the results of excavations at El Hibba, Shurgul, Fara, and Tello with the objects found at Abou Shachrain, Moussian, and Susa. Evidently the Sumerians, when they entered Babylonia, found there a people (Proto-Elamites) of more advanced civilization than their own, as is proved by comparison of their utensils and pottery. Some of their religious practices were different; for example, the Proto-Elamites buried their dead in cemeteries and put in their tombs no offerings except objects of metal, whereas the earliest Sumerians buried their dead under their houses and deposited with them objects of stone as well as of metal. As time went on the Sumerians adopted the practices of the Proto-Elamites. Any Egyptian influence before the middle of the second millen- nium B.c. is impossible. The source of the Sumerian script is difficult to determine. The script was borrowed, but not from Egypt. Examples of the script of Proto- Elamites II, found at Susa, which have been in part deciphered, resemble the earliest Sumerian writing, but show that the Proto-Elamite writers borrowed their Script, as did later the Sumerians. One tablet found at Susa bears signs which may be writing of the earlier Proto-Elamites I, but this is uncertain. Discovery</page><page sequence="6">ASSYRIA, ETC.] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1928 507 of further tablets of the Proto-Elamites I may disclose the ultimate source of the Sumerian script and at the same time make known to us the earliest of all forms of writing. Sumerians, Semites, and the Origin of Copper-Working.-In Ant. J. viii, 2 (April 1928), pp. 217-235 (1 pl.; 6 figs.), H. FRANKFORT discusses the above sub- ject. Pottery of the kind found in the lowest layers of the Tell at Susa, with geometric decoration combined with figures of animals and men, degraded into mere geometric designs. The same culture is evidenced by pottery finds in Mesopotamia, near Assur, at Samarra, at Bender Bushire near Kish, at Abu Shahrein, and especially at Al 'Ubaid, as well as near Teheran, at Urmya, at Mo- hammedabad, at Seistan, and to a degree by vessels discovered in Beluchistan. The possible influence into India cannot as yet be certainly spoken about, although it appears as if connection with Persia were indicated by certain evidence in hand. This style of pottery existed in the Persian highlands for a long period. Susa I apparently was a representative of a sphere of culture including all of Persia. The second style at Susa was also more than a mere local growth. The connection between the second and the first civilization here still remains to be established. The polychrome pottery at Susa comes later than the Highland culture of Susa I. This kind of ware, which appears suddenly and does not have any established connections with what preceded it in various centres, in Palestine, Mesopotamia, Egypt, Cyprus, and Cappadocia, may have had its native home in a region cen- trally located with reference to these places and this place may have been northern Syria, where actually the excavations at Carchemish have revealed a 'three-colour' scheme of decoration resembling some of the polychrome pottery from Mesopo- tamia. The makers of the polychrome ware apparently were a Semitic element in the Sumerian culture and to Semites or Semitized north Syrians should perhaps be ascribed the cylinder seals, and also the theriomorph and multiple vases of ala- baster. Sumerians perhaps originally spreading a considerable distance north- ward may have been responsible for certain other remains of the first civilization. Semites coming down from the north may have mixed with these Sumerians, al- though their number near Sumer, where their type of pottery is scantily repre- sented, may have been comparatively small. At all events we have reached the conclusion that both the civilizations originally found at Susa seem to belong to large areas of culture, that the older belongs to Sumerians or kinsmen of these and that the younger is that of the Semites from northern Syria. Copper-working is the great invention of these people at Susa during the period of the first civilization. Recently evidence has come forth showing that the Ar- menian-Caucasian metallurgy, praised in antiquity for its excellence, employed forms and shapes which existed at Sumer in the last century of the fourth millen- nium. The four spatula-shaped pins with turned-over tops, two of which are of silver and the other two of bronze, discovered at Ur, serve to show the connection between the two sections of the country engaged in this industry. Further evi- dence corroborating the same view is afforded by closely related pins, ear-pendants, prongs, etc. Therefore, before the year 3000 B.C. there was in existence a centre of metal-working at some place south of the Caucasus with which the Sumerians had contact, and, if the people that carried the Highland culture were Sumerians, then the invention of this belongs to them. The Tower of Babel.-In Z. Alttest. Wiss. xlv, 1927, pp. 162-171, E. UNGER main- tains that the reconstruction of the plan of the Tower-Temple of Babylon, made by Koldewey, and followed by numerous other architects, is incorrect. This reconstruction rests upon the interpretation of the word nu-kar in the inscription of</page><page sequence="7">508 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXXII, 1928 Nebuchadrezzar describing the building of the tower. This Koldewey assumes to be identical with the ordinary word zikkurat, 'tower-temple.' Accordingly, he regards the nu-har as the basis of the tower, and equates it with the cubical ex- cavation from which the original bricks have been removed that now appears in front of E-sag-ila, the great temple of Marduk. Unger holds, on the contrary, that nu-6ar means 'clay platform,' and denotes the open square or area on which the temple proper stood. This leads to an entirely different architectural recon- struction of the Tower of Babel, as begun in primitive Sumerian times, and as finished by Nebuchadrezzar. SYRIA AND PALESTINE The Date of the Two Temples at Byblos.-In Archivf. Orientforschung, iv, 1927, pp. 57-66, F. W. VON BISSING criticizes the reports of the French expedition at Gebal (Byblos) in regard to the two buildings that were excavated. These are commonly called the "Syrian" and the "Egyptian" temple, but there is no agree- ment as to which building is meant by each of these terms. Vincent, Montet, and Contenau contradict one another in their use of these terms. Moreover, there is no archaeological evidence to show that either building is "Syrian" or "Egyptian." The building called "Egyptian" by some on account of the colossi found in it, is not a genuine Egyptian structure; and the statue of the Ba'alat of Gebal also found in it is a very late work influenced by Assyrian art. The objects found in the second building afford no evidence that it was a Phoenician temple, or even a sanctuary of any sort. General Semitic Characteristics in Israelite Personal Names.-In Z. Morgenl. Ges. lxxxi, 1927, pp. 1-45, M. NOTH makes a detailed comparison of Hebrew per- sonal names as they are found in the Old Testament and in other sources with per- sonal names in the other Semitic languages. He finds that the most striking com- mon characteristic is the use of names of relationship, such as 'ab, 'father,' 'amm, 'uncle,' 'ah, 'brother,' ham, 'father-in-law,' and dad, 'paternal uncle,' as titles of divinities in compounding personal names. In all the dialects these names are most frequent in the earliest times and steadily decline in frequency until they dis- appear. except as they occur through paponomy. This leads to the conclusion that names of this type belong to the earliest period, before the Semites migrated out of their original common home. The use of names of relationship, as divine titles, accordingly, was the outcome of religious conceptions that arose out of the conditions of primitive nomadic life. Semitic Alphabet on Sarcophagus of A hirim.-In MElanges de 1' Universitg Saint-Joseph (Beyrouth), xii (1927), 1, P. SPBASTIAN RONZEVALLE presents a more complete study (with very clear plates) of the Semitic alphabet as found in the inscription on the sarcophagus of AhTirAm, which entered the literature about the origin of our alphabet. Syrian Astartes, etc.-In M4langes de 1' Universitg Saint-Joseph (Beyrouth), xii (1927), 3, P. SkBASTIEN RONZEVALLE continues his "Notes et Etudes d'Arch&amp;- ologie Orientale." He presents descriptions (with plates) of several Syrian Astartes and a goddess-mother of Beyrouth; also of a cylinder formerly in the col- lection of Comte Michel Tyszkiewicz, but since 1898 in the Boston Museum. Reinach, Furtwingler, Messerschmidt, and Ward (in A.J.A., 1899) described and interpreted the symbolism on the cylinder as Syro-Hittite. On the basis of photo- graphs made by the Boston Museum for the writer, he minutely describes the work and interprets it as presenting "un tableau th6ogonique Ftabli sur le th6me general 'syro-anatolien' du meurtre et de la renaissance du m6diateur cl61este." The Ten Commandments Originally a Rock-Inscription.---Most of the early</page><page sequence="8">ASIA MINOR] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1928 509 Hebrew religious institutions have been illuminated by the discovery of similar institutions among other peoples of the ancient Orient, but the Ten Command- ments as a portable code, carried about in a chest, the ark, has no analogy else- where. This fact and the non-mention of any such law-code in early Hebrew literature have led many critics to doubt whether there ever really were any in- scribed tablets in the ark. In Arch. Rel. xxv, 1927, pp. 220-224, B. GABIROL claims that the story that the tables in the ark were a duplicate suggests that the original code was a rock-inscription at Sinai. The forty days that Moses took to write it were due to the necessity of inscribing it on the rock. The duplicate was made because Israel had to leave Sinai, and wished to have a copy of the code. When they entered Canaan, according to Deut. 27: 2-8 and Josh. 8: 32, they again carved the code on a rock as at first. The tablets in the ark were destroyed at the time of the capture of the ark by the Philistines (I Sam. 4). Hence the origin of the story that the original tablets were broken at Sinai, and the disappearance of the tablets from Hebrew history. ASIA MINOR A Lydian Text on an Electrum Coin.-An electrum coin belonging to Mr. A. B. Cook, at Cambridge, is published and compared with other coins of the same lion type by W. H. BUCKLER in J.H.S. xlvi, 1926, pt. i(pp. 36-47). It shows for the first time that the dies used in stamping the obverse of the third-of-a-stater and sixth- of-a-stater electrum coins had two lions' heads confronted, with the inscription between them, but because the dies were much too large for the amount of metal used, only one lion's head is impressed, except in the case of this one specimen. The inscription also is more complete here than elsewhere. The Lydian sign ") (A), which is not known in any Ionian alphabet, proves that this is a Lydian word. It is to be read valves, probably pronounced walwesh, but that it represents the name of King Alyattes is by no means certain. The New Neo-Phrygian Inscriptions.-Ten additional Neo-Phrygian inscrip- tions which were discovered in 1912 and 1913, with revisions of some previously known, are published by W. M. CALDER in J.H.S. xlvi, 1926, pt. i (pp. 22-23). Some notes on these as well as on certain Old Phrygian texts, by A. H. SAYCE, appear in the same issue (pp. 29-35). The Sword-God.--In R. Arch. xxvii, 1928, pp. 107-135 (21 figs.), PAUL COUIS- SIN discusses the sword-god of lasili-Kaia and the cult of the sword in antiquity. One of the figures of the great rock-cut relief at Iasili-KaYa has a human head sur- mounted by a conical cap, the fore parts of two lions where the shoulders might be expected, and below the shoulders two lions, head downward. Below these lions is a support which has been interpreted in various ways, but is without doubt a sword-blade. The lions and the human head form the hilt of the sword, and the whole represents the sword-god or the sword as an object of worship. The blade is apparently not triangular, and it has the axial reinforcement common in bronze blades, though its form is elsewhere hardly met with before the Celtic swords of the late Bronze Age. Analogies for the various parts of this sword are found in various countries. The worship of the sword was at first a worship of the weapon itself, or rather of the magic power residing in the weapon. In course of time, as religion became more anthropomorphic, the human form (and animal forms) were added to the sword, and finally the sword became merely an attribute of the god. The Hittites of Cappadocia probably received the use of iron from the inhabitants of the Caucasus, and with the use of iron they received the sword and the worship of the sword. This would account for the fact that they, highly civilized as they were, represented the sword-god in such primitive fashion. At that time, the thirteenth century B.c., they had but recently received the cult from the Caucasus.</page><page sequence="9">510 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XXXII, 19'2S GREECE Cadmus and the Spartoi.-In R. Arch. xxvii, 1928, pp. 278-292, GEORGES POISSON discusses the origin of Cadmus and the Spartoi. The word spartos (Sparton, Sparta) is Asiatic, identical with Sardes (Sfard). Cadmus and the Spartoi are of Asiatic origin, presumably from Asia Minor. The various parts of the Theban legend, when carefully interpreted, bear out this theory. Certain Greek Cloaks.-In R. Et. Gr. xl, 1927, pp. 1-16 (7 figs.), LEON HEUZEY (posthumously) discusses the Greek cloaks, the epitaphis and the zeira. The epitaphis or ephestris-both terms are late-was an over-mantel fastened on the shoulder by a clasp (fibula). The terms are occasionally used by Greek historians to designate foreign cloaks, especially the Roman sagum, or paludamentum. Even in Thessaly, home of the chlamys, the longer epitaphis was worn, as being better against the cold. An illustration and contrast with the chlamys is furnished by a monument (Fig. 1) found in Macedonia. Comparison is made with the Homeric chlaing (Fig. 2, from a b.f. vase,-Mon. dell' Inst. II, pl. 22). Various materials were used, sometimes richly dyed and even embroidered. The zeira, a Thracian clasp-garment reaching to the ankles, is characterized by a collar falling as much as one-third the length of the garment, and by heavy felt-like material often hanging woven in patterns, particularly crenelation. The Thra- cians seem (Xen. Anab. VII, 4) regularly to have worn the fox cap (alopekis) with this cloak. But at Athens the petasos was sometimes worn with it by the young cavalrymen (cf. the Parthenon frieze). Heuzey believes these to have been Athe- nian youths (he discusses the matter from vases, etc.), a style reflecting the Thra- cian expedition of 465, thus showing the interaction of military history and art. Military history shows continuously examples of such borrowing of fitting costume, even from the enemy. The Death of Heracles and Life in the Lower World.-In Rend. Ace. Lincei, serie sesta, iii (1927), pp. 529-570, G. PATRONI writes on the death of Heracles and certain aspects of life in the Lower World. He emphasizes the points of resem-. blance between the eidolon of Heracles in Hades (Homer Odyssey XI, 601-627), "looking like black night and holding his bare bow with arrow on string, ever about to shoot," and that of Iphthime sent to Penelope as a dream (Odyssey IV, 795-841). Homer (l.c.) speaks of the hero himself, in contradistinction to his ghost, as feasting with the immortals in heaven and having Hebe to wife. Patroni disagrees with Mingazzini, who argues that Heracles' death on the pyre on Mt. Oeta (where a place of sacrifice has actually been found with two inscriptions bear- ing the name of Heracles) must have been unknown to Homer, and was probably a later addition to the myth. Our author sees no necessary contradiction to the supposition that Homer did know of Heracles' death on the pyre, in Iliad XVIII, 117-119, where the statement is made that the mighty Heracles, though very dear to Zeus, did not escape death. for Hera's wrath subdued him. He thinks that Heracles' tvxi', a heavenly body, was translated from the pyre to the abode of the gods, whence he exerted a control over his eido!on in Hades. Four Cults of Thasos.-In B.C. H. li, 1927, pp. 178-233 (2 figs.; pls. IX, X) HENRI SEYRIG discusses at great length the cults on the island of Thasos of Apollo, Herakles, Dionysos, and the Egyptian gods. A section of the article is devoted to each cult. The first (pp. 178-185) is devoted to Apollo. There were two distinct sanctuaries of this god at Thasos, the earliest being to the Pythian god. This was on the acropolis, and has been excavated, and although no evidence has been found as to the nature of the cult, its importance can be determined by its size and posi- tion. To this sanctuary doubtless belonged the colossal archaic statue of a crio-</page><page sequence="10">GREECE] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1928 511 phoros recently discovered. The second sanctuary of the god, in his capacity as Nymphegetes, was in the lower city. More is known about this cult, from the reliefs of Apollo and the Nymphs discovered many years ago, on which the regula- tions for sacrifice were inscribed. With Apollo and the Nymphs, the Graces were also associated, and divided the sanctuary. For him as leader of the Nymphs, the singing of the paean was forbidden in this sanctuary. The origin of the cult was rural and probably indigenous and pre-Hellenic, Apollo being added in Hellenic times. The second portion of the article (pp. 185-198) deals with the cult of the Thasian Herakles. Among the Greeks, Herakles was a hero, not a god; and the writer cites the passage from Herodotos (II, 44) where the Thasian cult is spoken of as founded by the Phoenicians. The position of Herodotos is upheld in part by the author, who takes the view that the Greek Herakles absorbed the earlier cult, which was already in existence when the Greeks from Paros colonized the island. The importance of the ritual of the Thasian Herakles in the inscription published by Picard (B.C.H. xlvii, 1923, p. 241) is especially emphasized. The third section (pp. 198-219) deals with the cult of Dionysos and the Thracian rider, and is the most important part of the article. In this connection, a frag- ment of Doric frieze, showing two metopes, one of a Thracian horseman, and the other of a warrior, now in Constantinople, and bearing a dedicatory inscription, obviously to Dionysos, is published. With this fragment, another, now lost, bore a relief of Dionysos. The finding-place of these fragments, which have been known for some time, was just where the sanctuary of Dionysos has recently been discovered, and they were from a votive shrine or treasury. The period of the inscription is of the early third century B.C.: the sculptures, however, are Roman. The writer asserts that the Thracian horseman is another way of representing Dionysos, and mentions other instances to prove his point. This form seems to typify Dionysos in the aspect of the mysteries connected with his cult, and is found on other monuments from Thasos, and of these a stele is here published for the first time. This stele, set up by one Auphonius Thersilochus and Auphonia Helikion, shows the man as Dionysos the Thracian rider, and the woman as Persephone the goddess of the dead. It belongs to the period of Caracalla, and suggests strongly the influence of the mysteries. Two celebrations of Bacchic mysteries in Thasos are known to us from inscriptions as existing into the period of the two monuments here published; the rp 'r6'XEws f6aKXELOV and the lepc'rarov voV p AKXELOV. It is to the latter of these that the stele probably belongs. It is a matter of regret that so little has been discovered of the worship of Dionysos at Thasos in classical times and earlier, as it ought probably to be considered an indigenous cult, of the Thracians, who originally inhabited the island, and left many vestiges of their presence. The last part of the article (pp. 219-233) deals with the Egyptian gods. A long inscription, found in 1924, is published for the first time, with translation and com- mentary, regarding the cult of Serapis, and belonging to the second century B.c. The predominance of Asiatic influence on the Thasians is shown, in coins, sculp- ture, and religion. We may infer from various names of individuals in Thasos, that besides Serapis, other Egyptian gods, such as the deified Nile, Isis, etc., were also worshipped. In Hellenistic times, the existence of commerce between Thasos and Naucratis, at the delta of the Nile, is proven by stamped amphorae, showing trade in wine and oil. It was through this commerce with Naucratis, which it is suggested went back several centuries before Hellenistic times, that the familiarity of Thasos with the Egyptian gods was engendered. A Funerary Diadem of Gold.---In R. Arch. xxvii, 1928, pp. 26-35 (pl.; fig.),</page><page sequence="11">512 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXXII, 1928 W. DEONNA publishes and discusses a funerary diadem of gold in the museum of Geneva. It was acquired in 1925 from a private collection and is said to have been found in Etruria. It consists of a band of thin gold, 0.284 m. long and 0.043 m. wide. Small myrtle leaves of gold, only 32 of which remain, were attached to the sides.. The band is decorated in repouss6 with figures between bands of ornament. The angle at the right is now empty; then follow a seated sphinx and a palmette; then a cortege facing to left, consisting of three draped women, a woman and a bearded man with a lance, three draped persons, a chariot, above which a beardless head is visible, behind the croupe of the horse three beardless persons and a bearded man all facing to right, by the horse's head a bearded man facing left, before the horse two bearded men facing right and holding lances, and three draped figures facing right; then a Doric building with two columns in antis and a domed roof. Between the columns are three vases. To the left of all these is a boat with mast and sail and five rowers, and in the angle at the left end an indistinct decora- tion. The building resembles closely the two buildings on the Frangois vase, and the style of the work is so like that of the Francois vase that the date of about 570 B.c. and Attic workmanship are to be assumed. Whether the scene represented has to do with a funeral or is susceptible of a mythological interpretation is not clear. ARCHITECTURE The Plan of the Maussoleum.-At the January (1927) meeting of the Berlin Archaeological Society, F. KRISCHEN presented an elaborate mathematical cal- culation of the original architect's plan of the Maussoleum in full detail, taking as the basic measurement one hundred Anatolian feet and following the ancient custom of dividing into halves, quarters and eighths, not tenths. The results arrived at by regarding the known simple proportions used by Greek architects are strikingly confirmed both by the actual remains and by the dimensions given by Pliny. In only one case is it necessary to assume that 'feet' in Pliny's text is a mistake for 'cubits.' (Arch. Anz. 1927, pt. 1-2, cols. 162-169; 5 diagrams) SCULPTURE The Aphrodite with the Dove.-In R. Arch. xxvii, 1928, pp. 195-193, EM. ESP?ERANDIEU shows that the Aphrodite with the dove in the museum at Lyons was not, as has been believed, found at Marseilles, though it was in Marseilles in the second half of the eighteenth century. It is described (No. 143) in a manu- script catalogue of the collection of the Abb6 Pichony at Nimes, whose collection, formed in the early part of the eighteenth century, contained objects from various sources. This statue, an Ionian work of the sixth century B.C., may very likely have been brought from Egypt. Arcadian Bronze Statuettes.-In B.S.A. xxvii, Session 1925-1926, pp. 133-148 (2 pls.; 3 figs.), WINIFRED LAMB lists and discusses Arcadian bronzes. The Main Arcadian Style (seventh and sixth centuries) is characterized by short, thick-set figures and large heads; the subjects are shepherds and peasants, occasionally Hermes or some other deity. Twenty-one such bronzes are described, and nine of other types are added. The Fifth-Century Arcadian group comprises bronzes reflecting those motives which the leading artists of the time had made popular, but each bronze shows clearly its Arcadian origin. Ten such figurines are listed, and to these are added three male figures of the second half of the fifth century, also a dead fox and an eagle. Probably most of the earlier bronzes were made in the southwest part of Arcadia, in the region round Mount Lycaeus. Tegea may have been the centre of production of the fifth-century bronzes, though possibly their production was not limited to one place.</page><page sequence="12">GREEK SCULPTURE] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1928 513 Chian Mask of Artemis.-In R. At. Gr. xl, 1927, pp. 224-233, W. DEONNA discusses the Chian mask of Artemis with double expression ascribed by Pliny (N.H. xxxvi, 12) to Boupalos.and Athenis. The author offers an explanation different from that given by Collignon (ibid., 1901, p. 1 ff.) for the facies in sublimi posita, cuius voltum intrantes tristem, abeuntes exhilaratum putant. Deonna be- lieves that the goddess protected an entry, a gateway, perhaps of the city, and that a mask of menacing aspect was above the exterior of the gate, while another of benign countenance, was set above the interior. It is possible also, though less likely, thinks the author, that the face may have been a gargoneion of the acroterion type, above the gate. DELPHI.-The Frieze of the Siphnian Treasury.-In B.C. H. li, 1927, pp. 1-56 (pls. I-VII; 13 figs.), G. DAUX and P. DE LA COSTE-MESSELIERE discuss the dimensions and composition of the frieze of the Treasury of the Siphnians. After a brief preface (pp. 1-5) for which both authors are responsible, the article is divided into two parts: the first (pp. 5-26), by M. Daux, deals with the dimensions of the rectangle of the frieze; the second, by M. de la Coste-Messeliere (pp. 27-56), takes up the composition of the sculptures, and the position of the extant pieces in relation to one another. Each of these two parts is again subdivided. To estab- lish his dimensions of the frieze, M. Daux is obliged to study the dimensions of the treasury from the euthynteria up, and consider its restoration in toto, in order to establish the correct position of the frieze above the epistyle. His conclusions place the frieze between the Ionic and the.Lesbian mouldings associated with the treasury. His measurements conform for the most part with those of Courby and Dinsmoor, but his conclusions are often at variance with them. M. de la Coste- Messeliere, in discussing the proper placing of the sculptures, takes up each side separately, beginning with the north, to which six pieces are assigned, then the east (four fragments), the south (five fragments), and finally the west, two pieces of which are preserved. This article is a prelude to a more complete study of the entire building, to appear in the Fouilles de Delphes. A Greek Marble Head of a Horse.-A head of a horse, of yellowish-white marble, now in private possession in England, is published by R. HINKS in J.H.S. xlvii, 1927, pt. ii (pp. 218-221; pl.; 4 figs.). The technique is evidently Greek and of a good period. The close-cropped mane with top-knot is not distinctive in date, but in comparison with other Greek heads, from the horse of Selene on the Par- thenon (440 B.C.) to that of Dexileos (395 B.c.), the flat cheeks and slightly concave profile of the nose suggest that this is the work of a pupil of Phidias working in the last two decades of the fifth century. A Marble Statuette.-In B.S.A. xxvii, Session 1925-1926, pp. 149-150 (fig.), H. W. LAW publishes a marble statuette in his possession. It is of coarse-grained&amp; marble, probably Parian or Naxian. Its total height is 0.376 m. The head, the- legs from about the knees, and nearly all the right arm are wanting. In the left. hand is a mask-apparently a comic one-in the back of which a small portion of lead pipe is inserted. The date proposed for the figure is the first century B.C. 'Xhether Eros or a satyr is represented is uncertain. The Parthenon Pediments: How the Work of Phidias Was Accomplished.- To refute the objections raised by L. Curtius against the probable dates that have been assigned to the East and West pediments of the Parthenon, P. JOHANSEN dis- cusses the conditions of work of a great sculptor in the fifth century B.C., as com- pared with those of a modern artist, such as his greater freedom from hampering external influences, and the greater ability and trustworthiness of his assistants, and shows how much of the actual execution of the creations of Phidias may rea- sonably be assigned to his own hand, illustrating by a discussion of the methods of</page><page sequence="13">514 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL.

Anz., 1927, pt. 1-2, cols. 50-48) The Thermon Metopes.-In B.S.A. xxvii, Session 1925-1926, pp. 124-132 (3 figs.), H. G. G. PAYNE presents some observations on the metopes from Ther- mon. He calls attention to some technical details, such as the use of red and black outlines for female and male flesh respectively. The metope with Chelidon, Aedon, and Itys has been correctly interpreted; the metope with the three seated goddesses forms only part of a scene, perhaps the Introduction of Heracles or the Birth of Athena; and the metope with two seated figures is also dependent upon another to complete its meaning. An unpublished fragment (a leg and left foot of a running female figure) is interpreted as part of one of the Gorgons pursuing Perseus, and the coloring of the Perseus metope is discussed. The hunter metope is compared with vase paintings, as are also the Gorgoneion and the fragment with a lion's head, and the conclusion is reached that the metopes are to be assigned to the period of transition from the Proto-Corinthian to the Corinthian style, that is, probably, to the years between 650 and 630 B.C. An unpublished fragment of a winged figure is interpreted as "Typhon." PAINTING Euphronius.-In publishing anew the "swallow vase" in the Hermitage Mu- seum-a red-figure pelike by Euphronius, found in Vulci in 1835 and published at that time in the Monumenti-O. WALDHAUER compares it with the very similar black-figure pelik6 in the Museo Gregoriano on which are two scenes with a dog, and discusses the strongly marked characteristics of the artist: his fondness for making a scene tell a story, his interest in a composition as primarily a decora- tion for the vase, and the total absence of any effect of perspective in his work. He was a great artist, not an innovator, belonging heart and soul to the era of Pisistratus, and his work has the charm of a dawning renaissance, like that of Taddeo Gaddi. (Arch. Anz., 1927, pt. 1-2, cols. 70-75; 2 pls., 2 figs.) Macedonian Vase.-In Ann. Arch. Anth. xiv, 3-4 (Oct. 1927), pp. 117-118 (1 pl.), R. W. HUTCHINSON discusses a vase in the Free Public Museum, Liverpool. The vessel measures 812 in. long, 72 in. wide, and 3Y8 in. high to the top of the sides and 412 in. high to the top of the raised handles. It is hand-made of coarse red clay blackened on the outside, well baked and polished. The running spiral decoration and its history are discussed and its relationship with lower Danubian and Macedonian ware. The Origin of the Representation of the Human Figure in Greek Art.-In a very long and important article (B.C.H. 1, 1926, pp. 319-382; 25 figs.), W. DEONNA discusses the beginnings of human representation among the Greeks, in an attempt to trace the steps by which the knowledge of anatomy grew, until in the beginning of the fifth century B.c. it had arrived at a very high stage of development. The point of departure is the pottery and similar objects of the geometric period, where a more or less schematized representation is found. The object is to trace, if possible, the origin of this conventional rendering. The theories in this connection of Pottier, Walston, and Cahen are particularly examined. But, while conceding the ties that bind the geometric civilization to the Aegean, it is suggested that they are perhaps exaggerated, and that there was a spontaneous development, some- what, perhaps, influenced by the preceding cultures, but not entirely in their debt. To prove this point, it is shown that the influences cited by Cahen to establish the dependence of geometric art on Minoan models, can be used equally well to support the theory of a simultaneous spontaneous development, influenced only distantly, if at all, by the Aegean culture. This is especially true as regards costume, several</page><page sequence="14">GREEK COINS] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1928 515 instances being discussed. But in the case of the delineation of the human form, it is shown that one of the most noteworthy traits of the geometric style is the representation of the torso in the form of an inverted triangle. By means of illus- trations as well as text, it is established that this is a characteristic of primitive art in all parts of the world, and of the crude drawings of children. This triangular manner of delineation is also found in representing other parts of the body, and applies to animals as well as human beings. When drapery is to be indicated, the triangle points upward, or two triangles are joined, point to point. Often not merely the torso, but the entire body as a unit, is conceived in a triangular scheme. Side by side with this we also find a rectangular scheme in primitive art, which is often combined with the triangular, in the same figure, the head being rendered in one manner, the torso in the other. As a result of comparisons with other primitive art, the suggestion is made that it is not necessary to admit a direct influence of Aegean art on the Dipylon style, but rather that they are both subject to impulses spontaneous in the art of all primitive peoples. This is proven by the fact that the human representations in Crete in this geometric triangular form go back to M.M. I and II, where striking resemblances to Dipylon ware may be found, and the pottery of Phylakopi is also cited, which dates in E.M. II and III, and M.M. I. In the later Minoan fabrics a more naturalistic style is found. The same truths hold for Cyprus as well as for Crete. These facts show that in Pre-Hellenic art there was a schematized geometric human type, analogous to that of the Dipylon, but having no influence upon it, owing to the centuries that separate the two periods. By means of a most enlightening series of cuts, it is shown that this triangular type of human representation existed in Pre-Dynastic Egypt, and in the early art of the Elamites and of Mesopotamia, showing that in all these countries as well as in Pre-Hellenic Greece, the beginnings of human representation start in the same way. There is consequently no reason to suppose that the new art of Geometric Greece will not take the same form of development, without necessarily being in the least influenced from outside. It must also be remembered that a lapse of from two to three centuries for which archaeological research is not as yet able to account, separates the Pre-Hellenic and geometric ages. Moreover, the earliest picture of the human form of the geometric age is not until the developed Dipylon style of the eighth century B.C., and this militates against a Pre-Hellenic influence, and in favor of an independent evolution. A similar development is also found in Etruscan geometric wares and in early art in central Europe and Georgia, all arising independently of each other. In Greece, the triangular types continue to survive through the earlier techniques of vase-painting, and distinct survivals can be seen in the black-figured and red-figured styles, in archaic sculpture, and even in the school of Polykleitos. The conclusion is therefore reached that the art of the Dipylon ware was a native creation of Greece, based on conventions common to all primitive art, and with no necessary tie to previous cultures. Testing and Sale of Oil on Painted Vases.-In R. Arch. xxvii, 1928, pp. 233-239, BERNHARD LAUM discusses anew the vase paintings discussed by F. J. M. de Waele, ibid. xxiii, 1926, pp. 282 ff. He interprets the paintings as scenes of test- ing, not selling, oil. The little rods are not siphons, but kalamiskoi, and are used to put a drop, or a few drops, on the hand or arm of the purchaser in order to test the quality of the oil as an unguent. COINS Names of Caesars on Greek and on Roman Colonial Money.-In Num Zeitsch. 59 (1926), N.F. 19, pp. 1-70, R.

INSCRIPTIONS Cyprian Inscriptions.-In B.C.H. li, 1927, pp. 138-154 (1 fig.), HENRI SEYRIG publishes thirteen inscriptions from different parts of the island of Cyprus. These inscriptions have all been previously published in local Cypriote periodicals, not readily accessible outside of the island. Of these, No. 4 is in Latin, the rest are in Greek. Nos. 1-5 are from Nea-Paphos, No. 6 from Citium (the modern Larnaca), No. 7 from Salamis, Nos. 8-10 from Arsos, Nos. 11-13 from Kerynia. Of the thir- teen, Nos. 3, 5, and 7 are the most important. All date in the Roman imperial period, mostly in the second and third centuries of our era. Decrees.-In R. Et. Gr. xl, 1927, pp. 214-223, under the general heading, Epigraphica, LEON ROBERT discussed: III. Isopoliteia between Pergamos and Temnos (Frankel, Insch. v. Perg., 5), presenting a study of some of the rights in- volved in this decree; IV. An inscription from Delphi, on a decree by the Del- phinians in honor of Athenian Dionysiac Technites (first published B.C.H., 1906, p. 277),-a new restoration is attempted; V. Decree of Priene on the cult of Egyp- tian gods (Insch. v. Priene, 195). The decree concerns the expenses for the cult sacrifices the 20th of Apatouria, and the choice, by the priest, of the cult officiant from those eligible. DELOS.-Two Graffiti.-In B.C.H. li, 1927, pp. 234-243, A. SEVERYNS dis- cusses two graffiti, previously published, and found in the excavations at Delos. The first, found in 1894, on a wall of the "House on the Lake," has been published several times; first by L. Couve in 1895, and then in 1924 by J. Chamonard. The writer of this graffito was obviously a native of Antioch on the Maeander, and it must have been written after the rebuilding of the city by Antiochus I Soter, 281- 260 B.c. It is shown that it is metrical, consisting of an iambic tetrameter and an iambic trimeter. It cannot be a quotation, on accounmt of the poor language, but was probably the work of a homesick Carian slave. The second graffito is in the "House of Dionysos," and was discovered by J. Chamonard in 1904, and published by him in B.C.H. xxx, 1906, pp. 552-553. The writer suggests some new readings of this graffito, and gives it a date certainly later than the sack of Delos by the generals of Mithridates in 88 B.C., and perhaps in the Christian period. DELPHI.-The Law of Cadys.-This inscription, published by the late Theo- phile Homolle in B.C.H. l, 1926, pp. 3-103 (for a summary of this article, see A.J.A. xxxi, 1927, pp. 491-492), is discussed by THEODORE REINACH in B.C.H. li, 1927, pp. 170-177. The writer believes that the conclusions arrived at by Hom- olle, and before him, by Bourguet, are not altogether satisfactory in certain par- ticulars, notably the maximum rate of interest to be charged on loans, and the penalties for infractions of the law. It seems certain that the Delphian standard of 70 drachmae to the mina was the standard to which the law applies, giving a maximum interest rate on loans of about 8.57 per cent. As regards penalties, a different reading and interpretation of that part of the inscription is offered, show- ing that the penalty for charging excessive interest on loans of less than a mina was a fine of 20 drachmae, but that short term loans up to 6 staters could be made at a rate of 14 obol for every stater per month, corresponding to a rate of 25 per cent per annum. The Delphic Paean to Dionysos.-In B.C. H. 1, 1926, pp. 263-304, W. Voll- GRAFF continues his series of articles on this subject. (See A.J.A. xxx, 1926, p. 490, for references to previous articles.) After giving a list of emendations and corrections supplied him by M. Roussel of the French School at Athens, the author</page><page sequence="16">GREEK INSCRIP.] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1928 517 takes up the discussion of Strophe X, to which the entire article is devoted. This strophe throws a new light on certain aspects of the history of Delphi, and through its evidence a date after 340 B.C., perhaps 339, is assigned to the destruction by fire of the temple of Apollo, and the erection of the new sanctuary, the one which was described by Pausanias. The second half of this strophe is unfortunately very fragmentary, and an attempt is made to reconstruct the text. The series of articles on this subject will be continued. Epidaurian Stele.-In Sitzb. Preuss. A kad. Wiss. (Berlin), xxvi, xxvii (1927), pp. 277-301, ULRICH WILCKEN publishes a new transliteration of the Epidaurus stele previously discussed by him in Volume xviii of the Sitzungsberichte, and re- cording the federation of Greek states formed in 302 B.C. under Antigonus Mon- ophthalmus and his son Demetrius. Since then Hiller von Ghrtringen has discov- ered a new fragment'and Wilcken's supposition that this might be inscribed on the reverse side has proved correct. More careful readings with the help of Dr. Klaffenbach in Epidaurus have also cast new light on the inscription. Kabbadias had put its date in the time of Antigonus Doson and Philip V, but the new frag- ment twice bears on the recto, as the largest fragment had on the verso, the name of Demetrius, once in connection with that of Antigonus. It is, therefore, now certain that both sides dealt with the same treaty, and that Wilcken's dating of the in- scription was correct. Klaffenbach on epigraphical grounds, e.g., the existence of the E with the bar across the lines, had also declared for the earlier date. Kallias Decree.-In Sitzb. Preuss. Akad. Wiss. (Berlin), xxviii (1927), pp. 319- 330, W. KOLBE discusses at length the dating of the Kallias decree. Differing from August Boeckh and Julius Beloch, who thought that such a decree could not have been passed in the years immediately preceding the Peloponnesian War, when the finances of Athens were in a very flourishing condition, and therefore placed it after the Peace of Nicias, Kolbe agrees rather with Kirchoff and Eduard Meyer in dating the decree 435-434 B.c. More careful readings and emendations of the inscription by scholars like Adolf Wilhelm and Hiller von Girtringen, as published in the new Corpus (I.G. 1 2, editio minor (1924)), have made this date quite certain, he thinks. The decree on the back of the stone, as dealing with payments by the rauaLt rTij ~iXXw OEV,, Kolbe thinks is of the same date and finds additional proof of his thesis in references to golden statues of Nike and the construction of the Propylaea, expenditures which can only have been made before the disasters of the Peloponnesian War had depleted the treasury. PANAAMARA.-Inscriptions.-In B.C. H. li, 1927, pp. 57-122, J. HATZFELD publishes one hundred and thirty-nine inscriptions from this site, found and copied by the late G. Cousin and G. Deschamps in 1886, when they discovered the sanc- tuary of Zeus Panamaros. They fall into the following four classes: I, Decrees and regulations (1-10); II, Invitations to various cities (11-25); III, Dedications and commemorations of priestly colleges, priests, and priestesses (26-132); and IV, Miscellaneous inscriptions (133-139). For the most part, these inscriptions belong in the Roman imperial period. The Mysteries.-In B.C.H. li, 1927, pp. 122-137, P. ROUSSEL comments in particular on that series of inscriptions from Panamara published by Hatzfeld in the article immediately preceding, which consist of invitations to various cities to take part in the worship of Zeus Panamaros. The resemblance to the announce- ments of the hierophants of the celebration of the Eleusinian mysteries is especially pointed out. This leads to the conclusion that "mysteries" were also celebrated at Panamara. Three great festivals were observed-the Panamareia, the Komy- ria, and the Heraia. Of these the Panamareia need not be considered, as it ap- pears to be of late origin. At the Komyria, women played a minor r8le, while the</page><page sequence="17">518 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXXII, 1928 Heraia seems to have been essentially a women's festival. The Komyria seems to have been of great antiquity, going back to the rude days of the Carians, and to have had a banquet as its principal event. From this barbaric symposium the later mysteries developed. The women's festival always appears to have been of secondary importance. These mysteries, however, did not necessarily limit themselves to the periods of the two festivals, but could be held at any time. We are ignorant of the nature of the initiation, and whether, in such initiations, the sexes were segregated. The invitations to the mysteries were sent out by the priest, speaking in the name of the god; and were not confined to the festivals above named, so that pilgrims from other places could present themselves for initiation at any time. A national character is indicated by the fact that Zeus Panamaros was identical with Zeus Karios, the patron god of Caria, and that the priests invoked special blessings on the cities of their nation. On the other hand, there is an attempt at universality-to make the god out as a benefactor to the en- tire human race. The principal part of the mystery at all times was a banquet, at which the initiates were supposed to be dining in company with the god. The article ends with suggestions of influence from the Hebrew worship in this Carian cult. Religious Regulations.-In B.C.H. 1, 1926, pp. 305-318, P. ROUSSEL comments on several religious inscriptions previously published elsewhere. The first, con- cerning the Asklepieion of Pergamon, is published by Zingerle in the Strena Buliciana. Roussel is not entirely in accord with this publication, adopting some of its views, rejecting other emendations and restorations, and making several new conjectural readings. He next discusses briefly two similar documents from Delos, and then republishes and comments on a text relating to the sale of a priesthood from Samothrake. Finally he takes up a lex sacra found at Cos and makes several restorations in the text. THESPIAE.-Inscriptions.-This article, in B.C. H. 1, 1926, pp. 383-462 (6 figs.), the sixth that has appeared on the epigraphical material from this site, found in the excavations conducted by P. Jamot and the late A. De Ridder in the years 1888-1891, is written by A. PLASSART. In a footnote, references are given to the previous articles, and two further papers dealing with the remainder of the in- scriptions are promised. This article is devoted to dedicatory texts of a religious or honorary character, and to boundary marks of sacred precincts. One hundred and twenty-five inscriptions are listed, divided into the following groups: I, Archaic texts in the epichoric alphabet (1-5); II, Boundaries of sacred precincts (6-13); III, Dedications of buildings (14-15); IV, Collective dedications (16-18); V, Bases of statues of divinities or mythological personages (19-21); VI, Dedica- tions of offerings by priests and individuals, many of which are to Artemis Eileith- yia for a safe delivery in childbirth (22-53); VII, Bases of honorary statues of individual Greeks, and signatures of sculptors (54-71); VIII, Bases of honorary statues of Romans (72-85); IX, Bases of statues of Roman emperors and members of the imperial family (86-104); X, Fragments of dedications of various periods after the archaic (105-125). Each of these inscriptions is given a commentary according to its importance, and some of them are of very great interest, particu- larly the archaic inscriptions and some of the dedications of buildings and honorary texts. ITALY ETRURIA.-In Rend. Acc. Lincei, serie sesta, iii (1927), pp.2 73-290, L. CECI in the third of a series of articles on Rome and the Etruscans, after criticizing Carl Schuchhardt's theory of the indigenous origin of the Etruscans and Pareti's identi-</page><page sequence="18">ITAL. SCULPTURE A(RCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1928 519 fication of them with the Villanovans of Emilia, discusses not only the words vinurm and asinus but the things themselves. Convinced as he is of the Lydian origin of the Etruscans, he thinks that they brought the vine and the ass with them into Italy. The words, too, he regards as West Asiatic, or perhaps Hittite, cer- tainly not Indo-European. Even to the Greek oivos was, he thinks, a foreign word, who gave it a masculine form, while the Romans made it neuter on the analogy of malum, pirum, pomum, etc. Asinus, with its non-Latin preservation of intervocalic 's,' is to him the "Asian animal," using Asian in its original restricted sense, like the Homeric 'Aaui iv XetLwvL Kai(Trplov tiwl jheOpa, and not referring to Asia Minor. Even the word mulus, with an older form musclos (cf. Gr. pvxX6s), he derives from Mysia. The article teems with etymological lore, much of which seems reasonable, even if problematic. The Technique of Pompeian Wall-Painting.-At the April (1927) meeting of the Berlin Archaeological Society, O. DANNENBERG reviewed the various opinions that have been advanced, since the discovery of the Roman paintings in the Baths of Titus in the early years of the sixteenth century, as to the process employed by the ancients in making their extraordinarily permanent wall-paintings, whether fresco, encaustic, or a process with resin or some other unknown medium. Through study and experiment he had himself developed a process which seems to give the same result as the ancient work. This begins with a very careful and thorough preparation of the ground; then specially prepared colors are applied on the wet plaster; and the surface is then rubbed over with a warm iron, which gives the necessary gloss and transparency. In those Pompeian paintings in which the figures and the ground are in the same plane, this finish, however produced, is carried over the whole surface; in those which have the figures in relief, only the background is polished, the raised figures being left dull. But in both cases a final thin coating of wax was applied, for protection and also, in the case of the raised figures, to give unity to the whole effect. (Arch. Anz., 1927, pt. 1/2, cols. 178-180). ARCHITECTURE A Military Altar.-In R. Arch. xxvii, 1928, pp. 309-319 (4 figs.), MARCEL DURRY describes and discusses a military altar in the garden of the Villa Medici in Rome, where it until recently served as the base of a statue. It is hexagonal. One side is plain; on the others are reliefs which have suffered from exposure. One of these represents an officer sacrificing, the four others vexillarii wearing bearskin head- dresses. The altar once belonged to one of the military barracks of Rome. It was probably erected by horsemen of the pretorians (equites praetoriani, specida- tores, or evocati) and belonged to one of the elegant aediculae which were conse- crated to the genius turmae. SCULPTURE Ara Pacis.-In Jh. Oest. Arch. I. xxiii, 2 (1926), pp. 53-61, E. LOEWY inclines to believe that the sculptor of the Ara Pacis knew, but outdid, the work on the Par- thenon frieze. Loewy also says: "Nicht Portriatgruppe bloss, sondern Gruppen- portrdit, das erste, das wir besitzen, wohl das erste der Kunstgeschichte." The Crista Transversa.-In R. Arch. xxvii, 1928, pp. 303-308, MARCEL DURRY publishes a note on the costume of the centurions of the Roman Empire a propos of a bronze statuette in the Museo delle Terme published by Lucia Morpurgo (Memorie dei Lincei, VI, II, 2, 1927, pp. 226 ff., pl. I, 4-6). He adds nothing to Miss Morpurgo's statements except in regard to the crista transversa. Those with an aigrette or panache he regards as not really cristae transversae. The real ones are of one piece of metal or of closely set hairs like a brush; they pass from one ear</page><page sequence="19">520 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXXII, 1928 to the other. The stele of Calidius and the statuette in the Museo delle Terme are examples of them. The crista transversa seems to have disappeared in the second century A.D. The Problem of the Late Antique and the Arch of Constantine.-In Sitzb. Preuss. Akad. Wiss. (Berlin), xxix-xxxiv (1927), pp. 342-358 (4 figs.), HANS LIETZMANN discusses the problem of the Late Antique, using as his text the Arch of Constan- tine in Rome (315 A.D.), for which much decorative material was taken from monuments of Hadrian and Marcus Aurelius. Only six reliefs, those above the three doorways, were especially designed for the new structure, the others being simply worked over. Four of these record the heroic deeds of the emperor, while the two over the main doorway represent him as addressing the people in the forum and distributing a largess. The author compares the treatment of these with sim- ilar scenes from the side-walls of the Rostra, executed in Trajan's time in the classical spirit of 200 years earlier. In the later work low relief replaces high, a picture effect being rather sought after, and color being used to supplement sculpture. Instead of the chisel the boring auger was much used. The distribu- tion of figures in the field was more schematized and, above all, interest was con- centrated upon the central figure, that of the emperor himself. He alone is represented in full front; the others are in face-profile, though their bodies are square to the front. The importance of the emperor and the nobles is shown by their greater size. Lietzmann insists that all this is not a mere decadence in artistic skill, but that it represents a difference in the object aimed at; that the laws governing demand and supply influenced the deterioration. The people were no longer interested in art or able to understand it. Individuality had yielded to mass and originality to type. He attributes the change to Oriental and barbarizing influences, and in the last half of his article discusses parallel movements in the fields of literature and religion throughout these same centuries. The Ransom of Hector.-In Jh. Oest. Arch. I. xxiii, 2 (1926), pp. 62-70 (Nach- trag, p. 116), A. SCHOBER compares the broken part of a sarcophagus relief found at Ostia in 1910, in which Achilles sits listening to a bending figure of which the outstretched right hand and one advanced foot appear, with four other known reliefs portraying the ransom of Hector. Schober concludes that the Ostia relief is a composite from the Paris relief as to the position of the suppliant, and from several other reliefs as to the grouping,. A Roman Portrait in Chicago.-In The Art Bulletin x (1927-28), pp. 258-262 (2 figs.), A. D. FRASER publishes a Roman female head in the Art Institute of Chicago. The coiffure is like that of the two Faustinas and, though it is not possible to identify the person represented, the head can be dated within a few years of 140 A.D. PAINTING Oscan Motif on Lower Italian Hydria.-In Jh. Oest. Arch. I. xxiii, 2 (1926), Beibl., col. 301-308, MARGARETE LANG identifies Oscan clothing and motifs on a hydria from lower Italy left to the National Museum in Budapest by Delhaes. Studies in Pompeian Paintings.-In Jh. Oest. Arch I. xxiii, 2 (1926), pp. 71-115, the third article of W. KLEIN, who died in 1924, treats of the fourth style of Pom- peian paintings. He identifies a number of paintings as fourth style and imperial date by the presence of Erotes. COINS Coins of Thurium.-E. S. G. ROBINSON publishes with accompanying facsimiles ten silver coins from the collection of the Marchese Ginori, remarkable for their rarity or other interest. Some variations from known dies appear in them, as</page><page sequence="20">BULGARIA] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1928 521 well as new points concerning the coin-engravers Histor and Molossus. (Num. Chron., 1927, pp. 297-303; 1 pl.) Reform of Coinage by Aurelian?-PERCY H. WEBB puts forth reasons for dis- senting from H. Mattingly's belief (cf. Num. Chron., 1927, p. 219) that Aurelian instituted a reform in the system of Roman coinage. He would instead attribute the change to Diocletian. He also believes that, as the denarius had the value of two quinarii, the antoninianus was rated at three quinarii. (Num. Chron., 1927, pp. 304-306) FRANCE Celtic Swords.-In Mannus xx (1927), pp. 266-270 (3 figs.), 0. RICHTER and M. JAHN write of certain very unusual Celtic swords with hilts decorated with spherical knobs. Only eight of these are known to exist; three were found in Eislingen, Ulm, and Bayern, in South Germany, four in eastern France in the Department of C6te d'Or, and finally an eighth specimen in western France near Nantes at the mouth of the Loire by the Vicomte de Lisle du Dreneuc. The au- thors think the original place of manufacture was in the Saone valley of eastern France. This sword has four of these knobs at the end of the hilt, arranged in two pairs in the plane of the blade of the sword and two more in the same plane where the blade joins the hilt. The sword seems to have been fashioned from one piece of metal. All seem to belong to the Hallstatt period. The So-called Glazier's Furnace at Glozel.-In R. Arch. xxvii, 1928, pp. 293- 302, MADELEINE MASSOUL discusses the so-called glazier's furnace at Glozel and shows that it is a pit for incineration, the date of which is much earlier than the Roman occupation. GERMANY German Fibulae of Roman Empire.-In Mannus xx (1928), pp. 79-117 (14 figs.), HELMUT PREIDEL treats of the Absolute Chronology of the German Fibulae of the Early Roman Empire. In a brief historical sketch he speaks first of Hilde- brand's classification, which distinguished fibulae of the Bronze Age from the Hallstatt and La T ne forms, and then of the Dane Sophus Mifller's further classi- fication into an earlier and later Roman period. Hostmann and Tischler erred in thinking the fibulae of provincial Roman manufacture, and Montehus first vin- dicated their German source. To the dissertation of the Swede Oskar Almgren (Stockholm, 1897) we chiefly owe the scientific classification and chronological arrangement of the various forms of these brooches. The article lists 248 of them, arranged by place of discovery and indicating form and date as well as first publica- tion. HUNGARY Budapest Antiquities.-In Henszlmann-Lapok (Henszelmann-Bldtter, studies prepared in memory of Emerich Henszlmann, 1813-1888, first professor of the history of art in the Pazmany University, Budapest), 1927, A. HEKLER publishes short accounts of: I. A bust of a Greek philosopher. The soft expression of the face permits us to date it in the time of Marcus Aurelius and the hair confirms this impression. II. A bust of Philippus Arabs, a good representation of the Emperor. III. A fragment of a Greek portrait head in a private collection in Budapest which by its arrangement of the hair and general technique can be dated about 200 B.C. BULGARIA A Three-Headed Thracian-Anatolian Divinity.-A relief found in Bulgaria and first published in 1912 shows the Thracian horseman-god with three heads, one</page><page sequence="21">522 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXXII, 1928 full-face, the other two in profile. The triple character thus expressed to the eye may be compared with that indicated by such names as Trikasbos, a Lycian variant of Kakasbos, for the undoubtedly related horseman-divinity of Anatolia, whether the number implies a god of three worlds, heavenly, earthly, and under- ground, or is merely expressive of a threefold heightening of his power and majesty. (0. WEINREICH, Arch. Anz., 1927, pt. 1/2, cols. 20-23; fig.) SPAIN Scipio's Camps before Numantia.-In R. Arch. xxvii, 1928, pp. 5-17, STAPHANE GSELL describes the seven camps and the wall of circumvallation built about Numantia by Scipio Aemilianus, the remains of which have been published and discussed in detail by Adolf Schulten (Numantia, Die Ergebnisse der Ausgrabungen, 1905-1912. Band III, Die Lager des Scipio, Munich, 1927, F. Bruckmann). The circuit wall was 9 kilometres long, agreeing with the 50 stadia of Appian. The camps were built, with one exception, on elevated and easily defensible ground and were laid out in accordance with the shape of the sites rather than according to the mathematical rules familiar to us from the camps of a later period. GREAT BRITAIN ESSEX.-'Romano-Celtic' Temple.-In Ant.J. viii, 3 (July 1928), pp. 300-326 (8 figs; map), R. E. M. WHEELER discusses a 'Romano-Celtic' temple near Har- low, Essex, various remains of which were excavated in the summer of 1927. The foundations show that the temple has a cella 18% ft. square, placed within a portico 48' ft., inside measurements. The walls are slightly less than 3 ft. wide. The finding of painted wall-plaster leads to the suggestion that the walls had once been covered with plaster. It is suggested that the cella roof may have risen above that of the veranda and thus have received light from the upper windows, as was the case in the 'Temple of Janus' at Autun, although it is possible that the two parts, cella and veranda, were roofed evenly. A ditch surrounding the elevation upon which the temple foundations were found may be the remains of the normal device employed to mark out the sacred limits of the areas of such temples. Such evidence of chronology as was discovered would indicate that the temple was in use in the fourth and perhaps in the third century A.D., and was possibly constructed not before this time. There is evidence that the site of the temple was occupied to an extent by earlier structures which may be investigated. The finds consist of: a few coins belonging to the Roman Emperors from Claudius to Valentinian, and also British coins; brooches of iron and bronze; iron-ware in the form of nails, key, and knife; and fragments of pottery much of which can be designated pre-Flavian. The description of the Harlow excavations is made the occasion for a discussion of this type of temple in general. The structure was in the form of a square, or nearly square, cella enclosed by a veranda on all four sides. The floor of the cella in many instances was tesellated and the walls on the inside normally, and on the outside occasionally, plastered and painted. These temples frequently stood on hill-tops, and with them there was often associated a sacred pool or spring. Buildings other than the temple proper, and used in an accessory way, sometimes have been found within the sacred temenos formed in many instances by a ditch. The temples were dedicated either to purely native deities, or else were the centres of a com- posite worship consisting of Gallic and Roman or Germanic and Roman elements which had come to be designated by some name chosen from the classical religion. MIercury, Apollo, Mars are names that occur several times; others, such as Caprio and Latobius, seem to be free from classical influence. The votive objects consist</page><page sequence="22">EARLY CHRISTIAN] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1928 523 of many pipe-clay statuettes of Venus, Neolithic polished axes, sea-urchins, and silver vessels. There is slight evidence at any of the seventy-one recorded sites of these temples that would tend to show pre-Roman relics associated with the structural features. Furthermore, the coins discovered range chiefly from the first to the fourth century, many of them being of the second half of the fourth century. The general conclusion on the chronology, therefore, is that these temples were in use during the main portion of the Roman period and were then destroyed, possibly by the Franks, at the beginning of the fifth century. An interesting map accompanying this sketch shows the distribution of these temples, which are located in fairly concentrated areas; eight or nine in Britain, but all in the southern counties from Essex to Monmouthshire; a considerable number in the Gallic community about Rouen; another group in the land of the Aedui, in and about the C te d'Or, the Auvergne, and the Lyonnais; about fourteen in the Rhine country a short distance south of Cologne; a few scattered examples in Switzerland, Holland, and Austria. With reference to the origin of this type of temple, the conclusion is reached that it does not represent a pre-Roman architectural tradition but is an adaptation of Roman elements made by native Gallic architects shortly after the conquest of Gaul in a process by which Roman ideas about the gods were also carried over into the native cults. Just exactly from what centre of diffusion these temples spread, whether from Rouen or the Eifel, for example, cannot be safely said. Diffusions of such influence can have been readily facilitated by the annual meeting of delegates from Gallia Comata at the altar of Roma and Augustus at Lyons. The Inscriptions of the Clyde.-In R. Arch. xxvii, 1928, pp. 320-324 (4 figs.), F. W. G. FOAT recapitulates for French readers the controversy which was carried on between 1895 and 1905 relative to Neolithic inscribed objects found in Scotland near the Clyde, objects which show similarity to others found at Alvao in Portugal. The parallel between the incredulity shown at that time in regard to the objects found in Scotland and that exhibited towards the recent discoveries at Glozel is obvious. SHROPSHIRE.--Bronze Hoard.-In Ant. J. viii, 1 (Jan. 1928), pp. 30-47 (2 pls.; 3 figs.), LILY F. CHITTY discusses a Late Bronze Age hoard discovered at Little Wenlock, Shropshire. The discovery dates as far back as 1834. Various more or less conflicting previous accounts of the hoard are now examined, and the conclu- sion is reached that 18 implements and fragments can be identified: a celt, a broken sword, 16 spear-heads and remnants. The spear-heads resemble one another in type, size, and general condition, though apparently no two were made from the same mould. The instruments are badly battered and were apparently gathered together as scrap. Swanwick Refuse Pit.-In Ant. J. viii, 3 (July 1928), pp. 331-336 (4 figs.), CHARLES F. Fox discusses the finding of about twenty burnt clay loom weights of the Bronze Age and a portion of a tool-dressed saddle quern in a refuse pit sunk in the clay at Swanwick, Hants. EARLY CHRISTIAN, BYZANTINE, AND MEDIAEVAL City-Gate Sarcophagi.-In The Art Bulletin x (1927-28), pp. 1-45 (50 figs.), M. LAWRENCE makes a careful study of the type of columnar sarcophagi the archi- tectural decoration of which shows the motive of the gate of a city, and she ana- lyzes the relations between these sarcophagi and other types. They form a closely connected group, the purest examples being assignable to one atelier. Like other columnar sarcophagi, they reflect the Asiatic tradition and have subjects and</page><page sequence="23">524 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXXII, 1928 ornament foreign to the frieze sarcophagi of the West. Their high cubical shape, decoration on all sides, and architectural background are derived from the pagan sarcophagi of Asia Minor, whence sprang the atelier of which they and probably other columnar sarcophagi were the product. Restoration and Fabrication of Early Christian Sculpture.-In The Art Bulletin ix (1926-27), pp. 88-141 (33 figs.), J. WILPERT demonstrates how much circum- spection is necessary in dealing with Early Christian sculpture, because of the dangerous and ubiquitous activities of restorers and forgers. In his preparation of a corpus of Early Christian sarcophagi he has come upon abundant absurdities, such as "the head of Napoleon III added to the figures of a sarcophagus in the Louvre, the head of Pius VI on one in the Lateran, and the Garibaldi on a sarcoph- agus in Leyden." Forgery with intent to cheat is less common (though known) with sarcophagi than with smaller objects, among which Wilpert discusses with devastating results the "cup of Constantine," "chalice of Antioch," "second silver treasure from Cyprus," and other recently invented treasures. EGYPT The Siren Woman-Fish.-In R. Arch. xxvii, 1928, pp. 18-25 (6 figs.), W. DEONNA writes of the siren in the form of a woman with two fish tails, a form which appears in Christian art about the twelfth century and is mentioned about the sixth century in the De Monstris, after which it appears in the mediaeval Bes- tiaries. These literary notices point to Egypt, and it is undoubtedly in Egypt that the source of this form, which is unknown in classical art, arose. The Style of the Consular Diptychs.-In The Art Bulletin x (1927-28), pp. 60- 101 (34 figs.), E. CAPPS discusses the consular diptychs from the standpoint of style and finds that they fall into two major and one minor groups. There is first a Latin group made to order for the various consuls of the fifth century. Next there is a larger sixth-century group made in Egypt or under Alexandrian influence and turned out wholesale to meet the demands of the consuls, who after they had bought them had the necessary consular inscriptions added. Finally there are a small number of these diptychs which appear to be Latin copies of Alexandrian models: three Magnus diptychs, based on the Alexandrian diptych of which a fragment is preserved in the Bibliotheque Nationale; a Philoxenus diptych in Liverpool, which is a copy of uncertain date of one in the Trivulzio collection; and an Orestes diptych at South Kensington, imitated from such a model as the Clementinus diptych at Liverpool. A Vatican Pyxis and a Sancta Sanctorum Plaque.-In The Art Bulletin ix (1926- 27), pp. 331-340 (11 figs.), E. CAPPS attributes to Egypt a plaque from the Sancta Sanctorum and a pyxis from Milan Cathedral in the Museo Cristiano of the Vati- can Library. He dates them about 500 and 517 A.D. respectively. ITALY Sienese and Pisan Trecento Sculptors.-In The Art Bulletin 1926-27, pp. 176- 221 (55 figs.), W. R. VALENTINER publishes a series of studies of Trecento sculptors. Nicola di Nuto is defined in his relations to Giovanni Pisano, Ramo di Paganello, and Lorenzo Maitani, and considerable additions are made to his ceuvre. Next the work of the partners Agostino di Giovanni and Agnolo di Ventura is assembled along with that of the former's mediocre son Giovanni. The two great Pisan architects and sculptors, Tino di Camiano and Lupo di Francisco, are considered with special reference to the tomb monuments of Emperor Henry VII and of the Gherardesca family, respectively attributable to them. The personality of Giovanni Balducci is also clarified by a variety of new attributions, taking as their</page><page sequence="24">EARLY CHRISTIAN] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1928 525 point of departure the signed tomb of Guarnerio Castruccio at Sarzana, from which the Madonna is in the Johnson collection at Philadelphia. FRANCE The Franks and Armorican Brittany.-In R. Arch. xxvii, 1928, pp. 246-253, SALOMON REINACu writes of the history of Brittany in the fifth century and later. The country was partially depopulated and was harried by Saxon pirates, but received immigrants from Great Britain. The cities were governed by the bishops and contained remnants (and descendants) of Roman armies. The Franks never conquered Brittany until the time of Pepin the Short. This is proved by the absence of Merovingian monuments of any kind in Brittany. GERMANY Jean Fouquet.-In Zeit. f. Bild. K. lxi (1927), pp. 345-349 (4 figs.), F. WINKLER discusses the illuminations of Fouquet that still remain in Germany since the miniatures of the Book of Hours of Etienne Chevalier have passed from Frankfurt to Chantilly. Germany still boasts the famous Boccaccio with the Fouquet illus- trations. To these must be added the three hitherto unnoticed miniatures in the Library of Duke August, at Wolfenbiittel, illustrating a book by the so-called terror of England, Jean de Bueil. After comparing these three pages with the Boccaccio illustrations and the miniatures in Chantilly, there are no grounds for the belief that these are the work of a clever imitator. HUNGARY A Reliquary Adorned with the Arms of Hungary in Bari.-In Henszlmann- Lapok, 1927, Dr. J. BALOGH stresses the testimonial of the inventory of the Basilica of St. Nicholas in Bari, made in 1362, as a source for our knowledge of the liberality of the Hungarian kings. This basilica received many gifts from the house of Anjou, but they are all lost except the reliquary which is illustrated in this paper. It agrees with the account in the inventory except for the absence of the arms of Petrus de Morerijs, Prior of St. Nicholas. The author promises later to consider in greater detail the identity of the donor and the artistic relations of the reliquary. RUSSIA The Miniature in Russian Art of the pre-Tartar period.-In Slavia (Prague), vi, pp. 742-757, VYACHESLAV SHCHEPKIN points out that those miniatures which come from the pre-Tartar period in Russia are relatively few in number and are con- nected with princes rather than with monasteries. They seem, furthermore, to reflect the monumental style of the Macedonian dynasty of Constantinople rather than the later style of the Komnenas period. In some of these there seems to be an attempt to represent in the coloratidn the softness of the Ukrainian landscape, since the colors are far softer than in those miniatures which can be associated with Novgorod. The author discusses also the Psalter of Gertrude, made for the Archbishop of Trier Egbert, 977-993, but apparently decorated later, in the eleventh century. Some of these miniatures have been thought to show Western influence, but the author concludes that they were made by a Russian during one of the westward journies of Svyatopolk, whose daughter was married to the King of Poland. SPAIN The Early Panels of Catalonia.--In The Art Bulletin x (1927-28), pp. 153-204 (77 figs.), W. W. S. COOK continues the publication of his studies on early painting</page><page sequence="25">526 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXXII, 192S in Catalonia with an exhaustive study of the iconography of the Old and New Testament Panel from Sagars. The article treats monographically the following themes: The Fall of Man, The Entry into Jerusalem, The Betrayal of Christ, and The Descent from the Cross. Gothic Painted Ceilings from Teruel.-In The Art Bulletin ix (1926-27), pp. 341-351 (17 figs.), M. S. BYNE calls attention to the wealth of Gothic ceiling paint- ing at Teruel. Although the finest example, that still in situ but hidden behind a later vault in the cathedral, remains, others have been removed. That from "the Jew's house" has been exported by a Madrid dealer. Three ceilings have come to America and are now owned by Myron C. Taylor, New York; George E. Steedman, Santa Barbara; and William Randolph Hearst. A Romanesque Fresco in the Plandiura Collection at Barcelona.-In The Art Bulletin x (1927-28), pp. 266-273 (10 figs.), W. W. S. COOK publishes the three fragments of a Catalan fresco from the parish church of Argolell in the Plandiura collection. They represent the Madonna and various saints and belong in style with the frescoes from the Card6s valley. Although still in the Romanesque tra- dition, the Argolell fragments are to be dated in the thirteenth century. Another late Romanesque fresco in Sr. Plandiura's collection is a fragment with a standing Apostle, which is all that is left of the decorations of the chapel at Esterri d'Aneu. NORTHERN AFRICA Three Christian Objects in the Museum of the Bardo.-In R. Arch. xxvii, 1928, pp. 67-89 (4 figs.), Louis POINSSOT and RAYMOND LANTIER discuss a censer and a beaker from Furnos Majus and a eucharistic mould from Djebeniana, all of which are in the Museum of the Bardo at Tunis. The censer is a footless bowl of very thin metal of a golden yellow color. It has three rings for suspension. Round the upper part runs an inscription in letters of the sixth century A.D., KarlevvOv1ro eI 7rpoEvXi jiov Cs Ovplia.pa 'v6'rL6v t ov K(iPL)E. The use of t and at for - and of o for w is common enough at this time. The main decoration consists of an acanthus scroll so arranged as to form eight medallions, in which are birds. It is carefully executed and is purely classic in its inspiration. Its origin is to be sought in Egypt. The beaker is also of golden yellow bronze. The receptacle is wide, but thin, and stands upon a truncated conical base. The handle is wanting. It belongs to the class of sacred vessels called ama, and is to be dated in the sixth century. The mould is of terracotta, about 0.16 m. in diameter. It was used for moulding eucharistic bread. In the centre are a stag, a tree, and two plants. Round the centre runs the inscription Ego sum panis vivvs qvi de celo descendi, preceded by a cross with four equal arms. The letters are those of the sixth cen- tury. The stag probably symbolizes Christ, and the tree the tree of life. Discus- sion of the forms of tree and stag leads to Egypt. So in the three objects here discussed the influence of Egyptian Christianity is evident. RENAISSANCE A Detroit Collection of Paintings.-In Art in America xvi (1928), pp. 49-58 (6 figs.), W. HEIL discusses the fourteen pictures composing the uniformly fine collection of Edgar B. Whitcomb in Detroit. A portrait by Tintoretto and one of those delightful vedute by Francesco Guardi represent the Italians. Two works by Rubens and Van Dyck convey an idea of the opulence of Flemish art of the seven- teenth century, while a fine portrait of Titus by Rembrandt and three landscapes by Ruisdael, Hobbema, and Cuyp represent the Dutch. From the French school are a Holy Family by Poussin, a super-refined Minerva by Fragonard, and a por-</page><page sequence="26">ITALY] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1928 527 trait of Marie Antoinette by Mme. Le Brun. Excellent paintings of the English school of the eighteenth century, by Gainsborough, Beechy, and Hoppner, com- plete the collection. The Stemma of Terence Manuscripts.-In The Art Bulletin x (1927-28), pp. 102-120 (21 figs.), L. W. JONES studies the relations of the illustrated Terence manuscripts on the basis of their iconography. He finds, besides new evidence for datings, that Ambrosianus H 75 inf. is the closest of existing manuscripts to the original miniatured archetype and that Turoni Lat. 924 and Leidensis Vossianus 38 reflect a second wave of influence from the delta line of manuscripts. ITALY Antonio Vivarini.-In Art in America xvi (1927), pp. 12-15 (fig.), F. MASON PERKINS attributes to Antonio Vivarini a Madonna and Child in the collection of Mr. Percy Straus, New York, which has until recently been called the work of an anonymous Venetian painter of the fifteenth century. It is a product of Vivarini's ripest period and is interesting not only from the point of view of iconography, technique, and style, but also for its purely decorative qualities. The Art of Scenography.-In The Art Bulletin x (1927-28), pp. 231-257 (11 figs.), C. Ricci writes a descriptive account of the evolution of stages, stage set- tings, and methods of stage lighting from Classical antiquity to modern times. He gives special attention to the great period of Italian scenography extending from the Renaissance to the eighteenth century and brings into their proper place and prominence several neglected artists of those times. Bartolommeo Veneto.-In Zeit. f. Bild. K. lxi (1927), pp. 280-288 (9 figs.), E. MICHALSKI discusses Bartolommeo Veneto, called the Venetian Proteus, who was at first a dilettante but later abandoned his traditions, and combined the significant innovations of the time in a striking, but second-rate, personality. His early work shows the influence of the Bellini school in some of his figures and of Mantegna in others, while Giorgionesque influence is apparent in his use of color. He combines portraiture, mythology, and allegory in his repertory. To him may be attributed the Resurrection in Berlin from the Bergamo Museum; it has been attributed to Bellini, but has the earmarks of Bartolommeo. In his later works there is a definite liberation from conventions, but though he is gifted in the use of ornament and landscape, and in the facility with which he imitates, he lacks the inner flame and inventiveness of a first-rate artist. Francesco di Giorgio.-In Art in America xii (1928), pp. 67-71 (2 figs.), F. MASON PERKINS discusses three paintings by Francesco di Giorgio. A Virgin and Child with Sts. Jerome and Bernardino and two angels, the property of Mr. and Mrs. Edward Holmes of Boston, displays in accentuated manner some of the most prominent formal peculiarities of the master's style. Two panels, evidently com- panion pieces, in private possession in New York, are interesting examples of Francesco's elastic and personal style in treating secular subjects. Genoa and the Netherlands.--In Zeit. f. Bild. K. lxi (1927), pp. 273-279 (8 figs.), M. J. FRIEDLANDER throws light on the artistic relationship between Genoa and the Netherlands. A triptych by Van Eyck came into the possession of the King of Naples in the middle of the sixteenth century through a resident of Genoa. Roger van der Weyden, Gerard David, and Joos van Cleve are all represented in Genoan churches and museums. Traveling Italians brought Flemish work back with them, and Flemish artists traveling through Italy took commissions. They seem to have been especially well received in Genoa. In the Palazzo Bianco in Genoa there are four uniformly sized panels, marked Albert Bouts, which do not seem to have anything in common with his work as represented in the Poldi-</page><page sequence="27">528 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXXII, 1928 Pezzoli Museum, in Milan. In the Palazzo Reale in Genoa there is Flemish work illustrating legends of St. Catherine and St. Agnes. Genoa seems to have been more under the influence of Antwerp than of Bruges. Luciano Laurana and the "High Renaissance".-In The Art Bulletin x (1927- 28), pp. 125-152 (31 figs.), F. KIMBALL establishes the attribution to Luciano Laurana of an architectural perspective panel in the Walters Collection at Balti- more, and another in the Ducal Palace at Urbino. Proceeding from these he shows the place of Luciano in the history of architecture. Inspired by Alberti, Luciano became one of the founders of the "High Renaissance," which is the style of a school rather than of a period. In creative originality and influence his impor- tance was comparable to Bramante's. The Portrait of Raphael in the Louvre.-In Zeit. f. Bild. K. lxi (1927), pp. 357- 358 (2 figs.), M. FRIEDBERG opposes the attribution of the portrait of the young man in the Louvre to Raphael, contrasting it with a drawing of a young man by Raphael at Oxford. His theory is that it is a portrait of Raphael by some un- known artist who has used as model the Raphael self-portrait in the Uffizi. He supports this theory by quotations from Burch, Mariette, and others. Reconstruction of an Altarpiece.-In Art in America xvi (1927), pp. 16-25 (6 figs.), G. GRONAU succeeds in reuniting five separate predella panels and in con- necting them with the main panel of an altarpiece by Ghirlandaio in the Uffizi depicting the Madonna between two archangels. A charming little panel in the Detroit Institute, attributed to the shop of Ghirlandaio and representing the battle between the archangels and devils, was first linked with the Uffizi altarpiece. A panel in the National Gallery, erroneously marked David Receiving the Shew Bread from the High Priest, having the stylistic qualities of the Detroit piece, became St. Justus Distributing Bread to the Soldiers (the two bishops in the Uffizi altarpiece are St. Zenobius and St. Justus). Later three panels at the Metro- politan Museum (where they are ascribed to Botticini) were added to the series. These depict the Marriage of the Virgin, a Miracle of St. Zenobius, and Tobias and the Archangel. This reconstruction of a masterpiece seems well founded. The Sarcophagus of San Lorenzo.-In The Art Bulletin x (1927-28), pp. 46-59 (17 figs.), F. H. TAYLOR discusses the class of Attic sarcophagi to which the sarcoph- agus in the porch of S. Lorenzo f. 1. m. belongs, and he shows that this example must in its original aspect have been made in the second century of our era. The decoration consisting of vintaging putti, however, proves to be a later addition, to make room for which the original strigilation and some of the moldings were cut away. Analogies for the putti and other features of the vintage are to be found in Renaissance rather than Early Christian art. Works of the school of Filarete offer a variety of parallels for them and for some of the moldings that were carved on the sarcophagus at its reworking. We have thus an antique sarcophagus with Renaissance reliefs, not an Early Christian work at all. Some Florentine Paintings in Russia.-In Art in America xvi (1927), pp. 25-40 (11 figs.), V. LASAREFF discusses some Florentine trecento paintings at the Hermit- age, Leningrad, and at the Museum of Fine Arts in Moscow. The earliest is a well-preserved tondo at the Hermitage, representing the Salvator Mundi. This resembles in many ways a Christ in two Paduan frescoes and a standing figure of Christ in the chapel of St. Nicholas in the Lower Church at Assisi, both attributed to the school of Giotto. The tondo is placed in the second decade of the four- teenth century; the nearest work in date is a fragment representing St. James Major which is attributed to Niccolo di Tommaso, likewise in the Hermitage. At the Moscow Museum is a Madonna with angels, which is connected with the school of Orcagna, being attributed to Giovanni Cristiani. Two fragments at</page><page sequence="28">HUNGARY] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1928 52t( the Hermitage are ascribed to Spinello Aretino, by comparison with his Monte Olive to altarpiece. The school of Lorenzo di Niccolo Gerini (1400) is represented by two Madonnas at the Hermitage, one of which is said to be an outstanding work of the late trecento and probably the most successful work of Lorenzo di Niccolo. A Venetian Painting in Detroit.-In The Art Bulletin ix (1926-27), pp. 70-75 (fig.), F. J. MATHER shows that the inscriptions on the back of the three-figure Venetian painting in the Detroit Institute are unconvincing as contemporary evidence of authorship and that the picture could have been derived from early sixteenth-century works at a later date. In Art in America xvi (1927), pp. 40-44, W. R. VALENTINER maintains his former attribution of the painting to Giorgione, Sebastiano del Piombo, and Titian. He holds that the inscriptions, although not contemporary, represent an old Venetian tradition, and that the picture has been too widely accepted by scholars to be later than its apparent style indicates. GERMANY Exhibition of German Art.-In Revue de l'art ancien et moderne lii (1927), pp. 65-78 (16 figs.), R. BONYER discusses the exhibition at the Musee du Jeu de Paume of works of art of the end of the fifteenth and beginning of the sixteenth centuries, the time of that remarkable personality Maximilian I. The exhibition included works lent by the Austrian republic and by museums and libraries of France; there were portraits of the imperial family, tapestries, books, armor, wood engravings, especially those of the celebrated "Triumph" designed by Diirer, the history of which is here related. Maximilian in art means Diirer, for he was decidedly the most unique and outstanding figure in the emperor's reign. In the "Triumph" fantasy and reality blend. Kalderer, an architect and painter, made 110 minia- tures, 95 of which remain in the Albertina. Then Diirer began his work in wood. Ten years passed before 138 pieces in wood completed the long series of scenes from the life of Maximilian, and by that time Maximilian was no longer alive. HUNGARY The Abbot of Madocsa, the Miniaturist of the Royal Books.-In Henszlmann- Lapok, 1927, Dr. J. BALOGH endeavors to explain the meaning of this title, which is found in the accounts of Wladyslaus II in 1495. He shows that the name of this man was Fra Zoan Antonio Cattaneo, a Dominican from Milan, who worked with other miniaturists for King Matthias Corvinus in his miniature studio in Ofen at the end of the fifteenth century. He was the fourth member of the group of which the others were Bandini, Felix Ragusanus, and Francesco Roselli. We can assign to him such manuscripts as the Parisian Cassianus, which show north Italian influence. Andrea Scolari, Bishop of VArad as Maecenas.-In Archaeologiai ]Rrtesiti, new series, xl (1923-1926), pp. 173-188, JOLAN BALOGH writes that at the beginning of the fifteenth century Andrea Scolari, a member of the same Florentine family as Filippo Scolari, was Bishop of Zagreb and later of V~irad. At his death in 1426 he left his property to Filippo, on provision that he would found a cloister. During his life he had done much in building and establishing monasteries, etc. All of his foundations have been destroyed, but to this family belongs a great part in the strengthening of the Italian influence in this area in the fifteenth century. Calvary Rotunda in Budapest.-In Henszlmann-Lapok, 1927, BRUNo GRIM- SCHITZ, discusses the Calvary rotunda in the Epreskert, Budapest. This has been studied by the Institute for the History of Art, and especially by J. Kapossy and Ivan Obilics. The City Archives of Budapest, in 1732, refer to the monument as the memorial of Frau Anna Maria Visztner (Viznerin), alias Schwartz (Schwarc-</page><page sequence="29">530 AMERICAN JOURNKAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXXII, 1928 zin), who died in 1717. She is recorded to have built a mortuary chapel in 1711. This reference seems to mean the subject under discussion. The work turns into complete architectural form the mediaeval mons cabariae, where an arcade and steps completely surround the inner cylindrical walls 6.25 m. in diameter. The motifs and style coincide closely with the work of Johann Lucas von Hildebrandt, who did considerable work between 1716 and 1720, and the mortuary can be connected with his work. The Origin of the Grassalkovich Monument in Besnyo.-In Hensznlman- Lapok, 1927, J. KAPOSSY discusses the date of the monument of Count Anton Grassalkovich, and shows that this is mentioned in an entry in the Annals of the Capuchin Monastery of Mariabesnyo and was, according to this, erected towards the end of 1772. The monument is the work of Johann Georg Dorfmeister, a prominent, if not extremely important, sculptor of the Viennese school of the period. The same author publishes also a color sketch by Ignaz Unterberger, which was procured in Munich in 1926. The sketch seems to be a study for the altarpiece in Cavalese La Madonna che offre il Bambino a Sant' Antonio. Unterberger went to Vienna in 1776 and became a member of the Viennese Academy and a much sought-after painter of Late Baroque Church work. RUMANIA Slavonic Parallels of Paris MS. Gr. 74.-In The Art Bulletin ix (1926-27), pp. 222-274 (62 figs.), S. DER NERSESSIAN publishes two Slavonic Gospels of the monastery of Sucevitza, Moldavia, that were shown in the exhibition of Rumanian art at Paris in 1925. One is of the late sixteenth, the other of the early seventeenth century. Both belong, like Curzon 153 of the British Museum and the Elizavet- grad Gospel, to the group of Paris Gr. 74, an eleventh-century Byzantine manu- script. For it is the-presumably Syrian-tradition of this manuscript rather than the Constantinopolitan tradition exemplified by Laur. VI, 23, which seems to have been accepted by the Balkan Slavs, part of whose Christianity was derived from the East directly and not via Constantinople. THE NETHERLANDS A Former Attribution to Ouwater.-In Art in America xvi (1928), pp. 72-77 (fig.), P. ACKERMAN challenges the attribution of the Resurrection of Lazarus in the Kaiser Friedrich Museum to Albert Ouwater. It is not essentially Dutch in style, nor is there any kinship with the work of Geertgen, Ouwater's pupil. Be- sides, on one of the cloaks Mirin is neatly and clearly printed in gold. On one of the hats of the spectators another inscription reads Nai. This is Jan backwards. Various versions of this name appear in the documents of the Northern guilds of the time. In view of this inscription and the intrinsic evidence in the painting, there seem to be no justifiable grounds for continuing to regard the painting as the work of Ouwater. BELGIUM Self-Portrait by Rubens.-In Art in America xvi (1927), pp. 3-11 (4 figs.), F. E. W. FREUND writes of a hitherto unknown self-portrait of Rubens which has recently been acquired by Mr. William R. Timken of New York. A chain is established connecting this portrait with the portrait of Rubens and Van Dyck by Van Dyck in the Schlicting collection at the Louvre and an engraving of Rubens and Van Dyck by Paulus Pontius. The self-portrait seems to have been used as a model for the Van Dyck Rubens, and when the engraving is stripped of the usual embellishments given to popular idols, we have Van Dyck's portrait.</page><page sequence="30">ATHENS] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 192S 531 SPAIN Pictures by Zurburan.-In Zeit. f. Bild. K. lxi (1927), pp. 289-292 (5 figs.), A. L. MAYER discusses some hitherto unknown works by Zurburan. Two panels of St. Jerome and St. Benedict, formerly in the collection of Lord Heylisbury and now in the Boehler collection in Munich, must have belonged to a series executed about 1630. In private possession in Madrid there is a Monk dated about 1630 also, which is undoubtedly by this artist. Zurburan may safely be accredited also with the powerfully, executed picture of a Dominican friar in a private collection in Barcelona, where it is now marked anonymous. Two characteristic Kneeling Angels, as well as a beautifully conceived Liberation of Peter, in the collection of Molina Dazas in Madrid, may be added to the list. Another characteristic work, though not of the finest, is the St. Agnes in the possession of Jose Suarez in Seville. Other works here attributed to the master are a Child's Portrait, in the possession of Dr. Carvollo, a Crucifixion, in Sonora, indicating the influence of Ribera, and a St. Dorothy, in Seville. NEWS ITEMS FROM ATHENS The reports from the excavations of the French School during 1927 were not available until this summer. They were, for the most part, continuations of pre- vious campaigns on the same sites, but in addition M. Bon carried out an exhaus- tive survey of the Frankish remains in the Peloponnesos, and in September he ex- plored the mountainous region to the north of the Alpheus, identifying the ruins in Paleokastro of Galatas as the castle of Akova, the seat of the first barony of the principality of Achaia. The fortress was larger than Karytaina, corresponding to Kalavryta in type, situated on a rocky eminence between two confluent valleys. The outer circuit of walls was very extensive and was defended on the north where the slope was more gradual, by three heavy square towers. There are traces of other walls within this circuit, and on the summit of the hill there is a large square donjon. The French excavations at Thasos in 1927 centred within the sanctuary where the two large altars, one circular and one square, had been found in 1925. This sanctuary is rectangular in form and runs approximately north and south. It was built on sloping ground which made it necessary to have a very strong sup- porting wall along the west face of the peribolos while the east face is cut into the rock of the hillside, and this part of the enclosed area was never levelled and could not have been built upon.' The western supporting wall served as the fa-ade of the sanctuary and shows five courses of marble blocks still in position. The great doorway was not in the centre of this facade but nearly ten metres nearer the north- ern corner. The approach to this entrance must have been by a ramp of packed earth. The marble sill is still in place, a monolith 6.30 m. in length and shows traces of a square central dividing pillar. Five metres south of this gateway there was, at the same height in the wall, a window, 0.90 m. wide with a base below it which would point to the setting of a statue in this recess. The peribolos showed drainage openings through the outer walls. Within the enclosure the altars found in 1925 appear to have been the important elements while foundation walls along the south face of the sanctuary and in the northwest angle would seem to have served as dwellings for the priests. The attribution of this sanctuary to Poseidon is fixed by the finding of two inscriptions which bear the same dedication: "Xenoph- anes son of Myllos to Poseidon" and by a fragment of a decree of an association 1The peribolos measures: on the west ft:ce 48.50 m.; on the east 52.50 m.; on the north 29 m.; on the south 32.50 m.</page><page sequence="31">532 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXXII, 1928 of Poseidoniasts and a small lead anchor of the characteristic ex-voto style. Di- rectly in front of the sanctuary was an altar built of marble which apparently car- ried the plaque with a short sacred law forbidding the sacrifice of goats to Hera Epilimenia. To the south of the great entrance and against the wall of the perib- olos there was found a marble statue of Aphrodite riding a dolphin with Eros perched on its tail. In Samothrace M. Chapouthier of the French School cleared a building to the north of the sanctuary. This exists in foundations only, but these are of the same poros used in the foundations of all the great Ptolemaic buildings and the structure must therefore be dated about the middle of the third century B.C. In plan it shows a three-stepped crepidoma with inner divisions. Fragments of marble from it were found built into modern walls and further exploration will undoubt- edly establish this as one of the important temples of Samothrace. At Mallia in Crete members of the French School spent two months clearing the north and east fronts of the palace. The limits of the building and its entrances on the east and northeast have been definitely established. The eastern walls, com- posed of great blocks of blue limestone, were c. 1 m. thick. At the height of the central court this wall was interrupted by a large opening flanked by two round columns. Farther to the north there is a jut in the wall, pierced, perhaps, by a win- dow. In the eastern wing there are two regions of storerooms opening on the col- onnade of the central court; the first includes six rooms for storage, reached from a NS. corridor with a narrow side passage; the second was divided into three rooms. To the north the rooms were grouped around a small court with a portico on two sides. The western part of this group is composed of rooms at a slightly lower level reached by steps in each narrow doorway. One room showed a low bench around the walls and on it were found numerous cups and jars; another room con- tained an immense pithos sunk in the ground. Between this quarter and the por- tico was situated the northern entrance to the palace, a real propylon composed of two successive vestibules at right angles to each other, paved with blue limestone very carefully worked. The sill of the outer doorway was of this same material. In front of the door there was a courtyard paved with short irregular slabs and from this emerged a roadway (1.15 m. wide) which descended obliquely in the direction of the Port. The arrangement here is identical with that of the SW. propylaia of Knossos. This would appear to be the official entrance as it leads through a small court to the north portico of the central court near the "Hypostyle Hall," while the east entrance gave access more directly to the magazines. The new discoveries have confirmed the former views as to the date of the palace. There are distinct traces of two occupations; the latest, found especially in the region around the northern court, shows typical M. M. IIIb remains, whereas the rest of the construc- tion must be contemporary with M. M. I. Mr. Rhomaios very kindly let us have a brief report on the Helleno-Danish exca- vations at Calydon which were resumed in 1928 in the same region where digging was carried on in 1926, i.e., in the Sanctuary of Artemis Laphria and the Heroon. In the Sanctuary it was ascertained this year that a second smaller temple, also archaic, existed alongside the large temple.1 This second smaller temple must have belonged to Apollo Laphrios who is mentioned only by Strabo. This attri- bution is made certain by an archaic boundary inscription: 'Ao6Xovos Aaq4plo while an intact bronze inscription of c. 300 B.C. supports the view that to the goddess must be attributed the chief worship and consequently the larger temple. Figur- ines of terracotta were collected in large numbers. These are of various periods, 1From its foundations the temple appears to have been 15.45 m. long by 10.50 m. wide.</page><page sequence="32">ATHENS] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1928 533 although the archaic predominates. To the forty fragments of metopes discov- ered in the excavations of 1926, eighty new pieces were added. From some of them may be put together a curious Gorgoneion with snakes issuing from the cheeks and ascending to the hair above the eyes. An important find is a terra- cotta head, life size, representing a goddess, undoubtedly Artemis. It is of the severe style of c. 470 B.C. Of slightly later date and smaller size is a head of Dionysos preserving its color. Important also are the new finds among the ar- chitectural terracottas; especially noteworthy is the sima of a gable of c. 350 B.C. with beautiful painted representations of Victories in chariots. The excavations of the Laphriaion cannot yet be considered finished. In the Hero6n work was car- ried out on a smaller scale and the results show that the building above the vaulted tomb appears to be much more important than was supposed in 1926. To the east of this building the end of a great colonnade was uncovered showing a peculiar variety of Ionic capitals. A third campaign at the Argive Heraeum was conducted by Mr. Blegen from April 18 to June 8, 1928, with funds generously provided by Mrs. Joseph Clark Hoppin. The campaign resulted in the discovery of two burials, apparently of the Neolithic Period, nineteen Middle Helladic graves, and twenty-one Mycenaean chamber-tombs. The Neolithic burials, the earliest interments yet found at the Heraeum, were very simple: the bones lay heaped together, packed in with small stones, in shallow depressions of no great size cut in native rock. Some of the bones had clearly been burned, and above the graves was a layer of black earth and carbonized matter, certainly the result of fire. Almost no objects were recovered in these graves, but the earth covering them contained a good many potsherds of exclusively "Neolithic " types. Twelve of the Middle Helladic graves were dis- covered in a group close together, forming a small cemetery on the upper slope of the East Yerogalaro ridge. They were all cist-graves, generally small rectangular pits hewn in hard pan, frequently, but not always, covered with large slabs of lime- stone. They yielded a good many vases, chiefly diminutive pots decorated with dull paint, a few small bronze implements, and some simple jewelry of paste, crystal and bronze. The Mycenaean tombs, of the same type as those excavated in the pre- ceding campaigns, proved unusually rich in pottery, jewelry and bronze weapons. The total number of vases recovered is not far short of four hundred. The two most important objects unearthed were a gold ring with a large bezel bearing an engraved scene of two heraldically confronted griffins, standing one on either side of a spirally fluted column; and a small ivory statuette of a standing "goddess." The latter wears a characteristic Minoan costume, with a flounced skirt, decorated with foliate sprays and rosettes, a low-cut bodice, open about the full breasts, and an elegant necklace about the throat. The figure was unfortunately badly shat- tered.' The right arm is missing, but the remains of the fingers show that the hand was laid over the right breast. The left arm was bent at the elbow and held across the body. This statuette is the second of its kind to come to light on the main- land of Greece, the only other example yet known being the one found by Tsoun- tas at Mycenae. The University of Cincinnati which had financed the three campaigns at Nemea (1924-27) began an exploration of the territory farther south in the Peloponnesos with a careful excavation of a low mound at Hagiorgitika not far to the east of Tripolis in Arcadia. The campaign took about three weeks and was conducted by Mr. Blegen. The deposit covering the mound had a maximum depth of three metres and proved to be the gradual accumulation of debris from prehistoric settle- 1It has now been skilfully repaired by M. Gilliron of the National Museum, Athens.</page><page sequence="33">534 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXXII, 1928 ments. The remains of simple dwellings came to light; these houses had stone foundations (the superstructure was of more perishable material), their floors were of packed clay and there were fixed hearths, either circular or rectangular. Vast quantities of potsherds were found illustrating clearly two chronological stages in the occupation of the mound. The characteristic pottery from the deeper strata is decorated in red on a white or buff ground and corresponds with the painted ware of the first Neolithic Period in Thessaly. The second style apparently represents a regular development from the earlier one, but the colors change to brown and black on a buff ground. No examples of "Dimini" ware came to light. No trace of metals was discovered, but the excavations yielded numerous implements of stone: celts, pounders, slingshots, etc., and a considerable quantity of pins, needles, chisels and other instruments of bone. There were also numerous objects of terracotta including several fragmentary figurines. An astonishing quantity of animal bones was found in the mound, many of them well preserved, in fact almost petrified. One small grave also came to light which contained in a small space the closely packed bones of an adult skeleton. All these remains seem to belong to a pure Neolithic phase of civilization. At a few points here and there about the hill traces of later occupation appeared, chiefly in the form of several Early Helladic bothroi cut through the earlier deposit and filled with fragments of Early Helladic pottery.
