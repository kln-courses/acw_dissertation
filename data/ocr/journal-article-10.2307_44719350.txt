Bevan Applied Physics Laboratory - Johns Hopkins University Copyright © 2002 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc. ABSTRACT Cloth- and leather-upholstered passenger seats equipped with NEC seat-based electric field sensors were tested using three crash test dummies, a 12- month-old CRABI, 6-year-old Hybrid III and 5th-percentile female Hybrid III. The crash test dummies were tested in the normal condition and in a modified condition where they were covered with conductive plastic. Human subjects were also tested so that the response from the crash test dummies could be compared with their human counterparts. A number of seated positions were analyzed in the ungrounded condition. Additional tests were conducted with children in forward-facing booster seats and one infant in rear-facing infant seats. INTRODUCTION Earlier testing with capacitive and electric field sensors had shown that these sensors responded differently to humans and ATDs (Anthropomorphic Test Devices).[1 ,2] These differences depended on a number of variables including sensor geometry, position, and occupant posture and grounding state. Modification of the ATDs surface by the addition of electrically conductive paint or plastic was shown to generally reduce the differences measured between humans and ATDs. The purpose of the testing reported here was to: (a) gather data on the response of an electric field-based seat sensor system to humans and ATDs; and, (b) determine if covering the ATD with conductive material reduced the differences measured by the sensor system. If the differences between the ATDs and humans could be reduced to an acceptable tolerance, the ATDs could be substituted for humans of similar size in classification and position testing of automobiles. The ATDs would provide an easy-to-use, repeatable surrogate for a human. The ATDs could also provide a standard regulatory tool for this type of testing. TEST PROCEDURE ANTHROPOMORPHIC TEST DEVICES - Three ATDs were tested: 5th-percentile female and 6-year-old Hybrid III dummies and 12-month-old CRABI (Child Restraint Airbag Interaction) dummies. The ATDs were tested in the normal condition wearing the regulated clothing and in a modified condition where an electrically conductive plastic meeting MH-P-82646A was layered under the ATDs clothing. Not only was this material easily installed and removed from the dummy, the material had been shown to be effective in reducing the sensed differences between humans and ATDs.[1] Typical resistivity measured on the modified ATD was 60k to 100k ohms when measured hand-to-hand or hand-to-foot. HUMAN SUBJECTS - Three adults, two female and one male, ranging in weight from 48 to 51 kg were tested and the results were compared with the sensor response to the 5th-percentile female Hybrid III at 109 lbs. Seated both in forward-facing child seats and in normally seated positions, test results on 5 children ranging from 20 to 27 kg were compared with that of the 6-year-old Hybrid III at 23 kg. One infant weighing 6.4 kg was tested in three infant seats and compared to the 12-month-old CRABI at 9.9 kg. Additionally six other children were tested outside the weight ranges of the 12-month-old CRABI, 6- year-old and 5 -percentile female Hybrid III dummies. Table 1 lists the height, weight, and grouping of the human subjects. SEATED POSITIONS - The adults, 5th-percentile female Hybrid III, children and 6-year-old Hybrid III were tested in the passenger seat in the following positions: 1 . Normal seated position belted and unbelted 2. Seated with legs rotated 30 degrees clockwise and counter clockwise, belted. 3. Seated, shifted towards the door and center of the vehicle, belted. 4. Repeated testing in a normal seated position, belted and unbelted. 1707</page><page sequence="2">The human subjects were instructed to sit in the specified positions. The seating positions were approximate based on occupant comfort in the seat. The rotated positions were approximate, limited to what was easily achievable by the subject. The shifted positions stayed within the limits of the seat width. The children were also tested in the following forward facing child booster seats: • Britax Cruiser • Century Nextstep • Cosco Highback The infant was tested in the following rear-facing infant seats: • Evenflo Discovery • Evenflo On My Way • Graco Lite Rider The child and infant seats were installed according to the manufacturers recommendations; however, the seatbelt tension was not measured. CARS TESTED - The front passenger seats for two cars were retrofitted to incorporate the electric field sensor in the seats. The first car was a 2001 Chevrolet Impala with cloth seats. The second was a 2001 Chrysler Stratus with leather seats. The vehicles were new and no consideration was given in this test to the effect of aging of the seat and vehicle. It is expected that testing of seat sensor systems with crash test dummies will be conducted on new vehicles and seats, therefore aging characteristics of the sensor system and seat foam are not significant issues. Differences in seat fabric and seat shape had been shown to affect the sensors response. Cloth and leather have different stiffness and thickness, affecting the sensor response. Seat shape affects the pressure pattern in the seat and the spread of soft tissue when seated. Because of these differences, the same subject seated in the two vehicles generated different responses. For this reason, each vehicle sensor system has different classification threshold settings and a direct comparison of data between vehicles can only be made with this consideration. Figures 1 and 2 show an example of how the sensors look after installation on the foam cushion. Figure 3 gives a cross-sectional schematic of the NEC electric field sensor showing the relative location of the sensors within the seat cushion. The NEC seat sensor works by creating an RF field that couples to the occupant and surrounding vehicle structure. Changes in this field caused by the occupant results in a sensor response. [3] By studying the correlation of the occupant size and seated position to sensor response, the occupant can be classified according to the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208 (FMVSS-208) requirements. Because of the sensitivity of the sensor's response to the seat design and interior vehicle environment the sensor classification thresholds may vary with interior options. Since NEC's classification algorithm is proprietary, a data analysis algorithm was created that captured the essence of NEC's algorithm without the classification threshold and due-care considerations since these considerations were outside of the scope of this paper. The eight measurements taken for each test were reduced to three measurement groups according to their location: top (sensor numbers 1, 4, and 7), bottom (sensor numbers 3 and 6), and thickness (sensor numbers 2, 5, 8). The sensor response was determined by taking the digital sensor output for each sensor and subtracting it from the empty seat baseline. To create a sensor group measurement, the sensor responses from all of the sensors in the group are added together. The driving factors for the response of the top and bottom sensor groups were the: a) Area of the sensors covered by the subject; b) Electrical conductivity of the object in the seat; c) Distance or gap between the sensors and the seated occupant. The response of the thickness sensors group is dominated by the foam compression (or gap) between sensors 1 and 2, 4 and 5, and 7 and 8. The thickness sensor responds in a non-linear fashion to the amount and area of foam compression caused by the seated subject. This thickness group is intended to detect the condition where a child sits on a wet towel. The wet towel will create the response of a large person in the top and bottom sensor groups but the thickness measurement will correctly estimate the weight of the child. The NEC sensor system also has additional sensing modes to detect occupant grounding, temperature and relative humidity effects on the sensor system. These sensor responses were not evaluated in this study. RESULTS The following results are presented: • Effect of seatbelts and seated angle • Sensor response to humans as a function of weight in the normal, shifted, and angled seating positions for humans • Comparison of sub-group data in the normal, shifted and angled seating positions of humans to that of similarly-sized ATDs • Child and infant seat testing SEAT BELTS - The effect of seatbelts was investigated by comparing the normally seated positions that were belted and unbelted. Excluding the child and infant 1708</page><page sequence="3">seats, the seatbelt had little or no effect on the sensor response; however, this is a qualitative assessment based on observations during testing since there was insufficient number of matched samples for analysis. Given the small difference observed, the belted and unbelted data for the seated positions is combined in the analysis. Table 1 Height and weight of infants, children and adults tested.

In looking at Figures 4 and 5, there was little difference between the clockwise and counterclockwise positions. For this reason, the results of the two groups are combined in later analysis. SEATED POSITION AND WEIGHT - Figures 4 through 10 show the response of the sensor groups to ungrounded human subjects seated in two different positions in two different cars. The first position was a normal seating position (Figures 6 and 7). The second position was a normal seating position shifted either towards the center of the vehicle or to the outside door with the body remaining in a forward-facing position (Figures 8 and 9). In all of these tests, the sensor response was similar. The sensor groups tended to have a non-linear response to occupant weight in the Impala, being very sensitive at low occupant weight with decreasing sensitivity at larger occupant weights while the sensors in the Stratus exhibited much more linear response to weight. For Figures 8 and 9 there was little difference between the inboard and outboard positions in the seat. HUMAN AND ATD DATA - Data collected on the sensor's response to humans and ATDs was analyzed to determine if the sensor responded to ATDs and similarly sized humans in a similar fashion. The human data was broken up into three target groups as shown in Table 1. Each group was analyzed using group averages and standard deviations to determine the similarity of the ATD to humans of the target group. Due to insufficient sample size, the standard deviations (shown as error bars on the plots) for some of the subgroups are not statistically significant and their use should be limited to qualitative comparison. Figures 10 and 11 compares the sensor's response to three humans to that of a normal and modified 5th- percentile female Hybrid III dummies seated in an ungrounded, normally seated position. Figures 12 through 15 plot the sensor's response in ungrounded angled and shifted seating positions in both the Stratus and Impala. These plots show that, for the top sensor group, the modified 5th-percentile female Hybrid III generally was detected to be more similar to humans than the unmodified Hybrid III. For the bottom and thickness sensor groups there was little improvement offered by the modification to the 5th-percentile female Hybrid III. Figures 16 and 17 compares the sensor's response to five children to that of normal and modified 6-year-old Hybrid III dummies, all seated in an ungrounded, normally seated position. Figures 18 through 21 plot the sensor's response in ungrounded angled and shifted seating positions in both the Stratus and Impala. These plots show that the modifications to the 6-year-old Hybrid III generally cause the seat sensor to detect it to be more like similarly sized humans than the normal, unmodified Hybrid III. For a number of the positions analyzed, the sensor's response to the modified 6-year-old Hybrid III fell within one standard deviation of the child response. Three forward facing child seats and three rear facing infant seats were also analyzed using a similar process. The results are shown in Figures 22 through 36. The averages and standard deviations are plotted allowing comparison of the electric field sensor's response to the children, infant and ATDs. DISCUSSION A number of tests were conducted to determine the potential for substituting ATDs for humans in testing of the NEC sensor. The preliminary testing suggested that, to a limited degree, the ATDs could be substituted for 1709</page><page sequence="4">human subjects when testing the NEC's electric field sensor. The fidelity of the ATD response to the human response varied with the vehicle, occupant size and ATD covering. In general, the response of the electric field sensor was non-linear with weight, tending to be more sensitive to lower occupant weight (0-36 kg) than greater occupant weight (36-51 kg) Looking at the sensor response in the two vehicles several observations can be made. While the magnitude of the response of the sensor in the Impala was generally twice that of the Stratus, this difference is insignificant because hardware and software adjustments that can be made. Of greater interest is the difference in sensor group response as a function of weight. Looking at Figures 6 through 9, the response of the top and thickness sensor was more linear for the Stratus than the Impala. In comparison to the Impala, the response of the Stratus' thickness and bottom sensors showed less difference. These differences may reflect differences in seat profile and foam response. The Stratus seat appeared to have a more "fitted" shape conforming closer to the body in an uncompressed state. This, combined with differences in foam stiffness may account for the difference in response with occupant weight. The differences in response magnitude and relative response suggest that classification algorithms will need to compensate for differences in seat design. SMALL ADULT AND 5™-PERCENTILE FEMALE HYBRID III - In comparing the response of the sensor to humans and ATDs, differences in the electric field sensor response were greatest between the 5th- percentile female Hybrid III and similarly sized adults. The largest differences were found in the top sensor group where the normal dummy response was less than half of the human response for all three seating positions examined. For the modified 5th-percentile female Hybrid III, the top sensor group response was 10-30% greater than the response measured on humans. For the bottom sensor group, the differences between the human, and normal and modified 5th-percentile female Hybrid III dummies were smaller than those measured on the top sensor group, with the normal 5th-percentile female Hybrid III appearing more similar to the human response than the modified 5th-percentile female Hybrid III. The thickness sensor showed both the normal and modified 5th-percentile female Hybrid III dummies created a larger response than the human test group, with the normal 5th-percentile female Hybrid III being more similar to the human measurements than measurements of the modified ATD. The significant differences measured between the 5th percentile female Hybrid III, both in the normal and modified conditions, suggests that greater modifications may be needed to the ATD to create an acceptable similarity to humans. The differences between the humans and 5th percentile female Hybrid III tested can potentially be explained by comparing the pressure pattern of the 5th female Hybrid III to that of females of similar stature. As reported earlier, [1] there exists significant difference in pressure pattern between small female humans and a similarly sized 5th-percentile Hybrid III. Imbedded in the thickness measurement is a nonlinear response to thickness. Variations in seated pressure, such as those seen between humans and ATDs may have an effect on the measurement made. Closer examination of the data by location gives more insight on differences observed. Figure 11 can be broken down by each sensor as shown in Figures 34 through 36. Sensors 1 , 4 and 7 show that the modified ATD and human are much more similar than the normal ATD but the difference increases towards the front of the seat. It is suspected that difference between human and ATD weight distribution accounts for this difference. As seen in Figure 37, the front portion of the thighs of the 5th-percentile female Hybrid III exert significantly more pressure on the seat than humans. The difference in front-to-back weight distribution shown in Figure 34 corresponds with the trend of decreasing sensor difference found from front-to-back. Another way to test the weight distribution issue would be to repeat the testing using the 5th-percentile female OCATD (Occupant Classification Anthropomorphic Test Device) developed by FTSS. This test tool has a seated pressure pattern more similar to that of small females than the 5th-percentile female Hybrid III. If the differences, particularly if the OCATD was covered with conductive material, were reduced then the effect of pressure distribution on seat-based electric field sensors would be confirmed. CHILDREN AND 6-YEAR-OLD HYBRID III - Test data on the 6-year-old Hybrid III shows that the modified 6- year-old Hybrid III appeared more similar to children of similar size. This was especially true in the Impala where the difference in response was within one standard deviation for most of three sensor groups for the three positions evaluated. The measurements made in the Stratus showed greater differences between the modified ATD and human measurements. Differences in the thickness sensor group measurements need to be evaluated with caution because of variation in seatbelt preload. Variation of seatbelt preload affects the compression (and response) of the thickness group of sensors. Since seatbelt preload was not controlled, its variation would affect the thickness sensor response. The forward facing child seat reduced the differences observed by the electric field sensor between the children and normal and modified 6-year-old Hybrid III dummies. Although based on a small number of tests, the modified ATD showed more similarity to a child than 1710</page><page sequence="5">the normal ATD. The substitution of the modified 6-year- old Hybrid III for human children of similar size may be acceptable for certain vehicle seats and seating positions. INFANT AND 12-MONTH-OLD CRABI - Preliminary tests on the rear-facing infant seat suggest that the 12- month-old CRABI might be a suitable substitute for human infants because the sensor's response to infants is so small relative to the response generated by larger occupants. Differences in the thickness group measurements between the CRABI and the infant may be due to the 3.5 kg difference in their weight. Additionally, the thickness group response would be affected by the seatbelt preload, up to 134 N, that FMVSS-208 specifies during installation. To confirm the testing reported here, additional testing is needed at this tension level of 134-N and a larger number of infants need to be tested that have a weight closer to the CRABI. CONCLUSION Testing of NEC electric field sensors was conducted using the passenger seats in two cars, a leather covered Stratus seat and cloth covered Impala seat. Three crash test dummies were tested, a 12-month-old CRABI, 6- year-old Hybrid III, and 5th-percentile female Hybrid III. The ATDs were tested in the normal condition and in a modified condition where they were covered with conductive plastic. Human subjects were also tested so that the response from the ATDs could be compared with their human counterparts. Additionally, the children were tested in forward-facing booster seats and the infant was tested in a rear-facing infant seat. The preliminary results showed that, to a limited degree of fidelity, the use of 6-year-old Hybrid III and 12-month- old CRABI crash test dummies as surrogates for humans in testing of electric field sensors is possible. The best results were found with the covered 6-year-old Hybrid III seated in a forward facing booster seat. Limited test results suggest that it might be possible to substitute the 12-month-old CRABI for an infant. The 5th- percentile female Hybrid III showed the poorest fidelity to human measurements and its use as a surrogate is probably not warranted. Additional testing is needed to confirm these results and give greater statistical confidence to the results. It is possible that further improvement of the seating procedure and conductive covering could improve the similarity between humans and ATDs. Use of the OCATD (if covered with conductive material) may yield even better similarity to humans than the modified Hybrid III dummies. It is planned that this testing will be conducted in the future.
