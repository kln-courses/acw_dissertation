<plain_text><page sequence="1">POTTERY MASK TRADITION IN MESOAMERICAx STEPHAN F. DE BORHEGYI CLAY MASKS of various sizes representing both humans and animals have been reported in small numbers throughout Mexico. Ekholm mentions twenty-one pottery masks and maskettes from Tampico and Panuco in the Huas- teca,2 three from Guasave, Sinaloa,3 and one from Teotihuacan, Mexico;4 Kelly reports one from the La Carbonera site near Culiacin, Sinaloa;5 and Drucker excavated several at Cerro de las Mesas, Veracruz' (see Fig. 1, map). Most of these belong to the Late Classic and Post-Classic periods, the only exceptions being some of the small maskettes from Panuco which possibly date to the Proto-Classic or Early Classic. In her recent report on the Pre-Classic culture of Tlatilco, Mex- ico, Muriel Porter' reports two clay masks which she believes to be a Pre-Classic feature unique to Tlatilco. One of the clay masks8 from burial 79 at Tlatilco represents a human face with mouth and eye holes, three suspension holes, and which measures 13 cm in height. The other fragmentary mask9 has decidedly feline (jaguar) characteristics, with a large mouth, drooping at the corners, and two long fangs. It came from an isolated trench at Tlatilco, has eye and mouth holes, and is 7 cm in height. It appears to have only one suspension hole. Porter also calls attention to some miniature masks excavated by Vaillant at Zacatenco, Ticoman, and El Arbolillo, which he referred to as "gorgets."' Vaillant has as- signed these to the El Arbolillo II, Middle Zacatenco period. Although the clay masks found at Tlatilco are undeniably the earliest reported from Mexico, a speci- men discovered in Guatemala appears to be of even earlier date. 1 This discussion is limited to pottery masks in Mesoamerica. No attempt has been made to incorporate Mesoamerican masks of other materials such as jade, stone, granite rock, stucco, gold, shell, mosaic, gourd, etc. 2 Ekholm, 1944, pp. 452-453, fig. 32a-g. 3 Ekholm, 1942, pp. 85-87, fig. 16a-c. 4 Idem, p. 87. In a letter dated March 10, 1955 Dr Ekholm informed me that the American Museum of Natural History possesses two pottery masks from Teotihuacan, Mexico. One mask has suspension holes but is without perforated eyes and is four and a quarter inches in height (no. 30.1-6918). The other has perforated eyes and no suspension holes and is five and a quarter inches in height (no. 30.1-6917). They are both of Teotihuacan V date. 5 Kelly, 1945, p. 141, pl. 4d. 6 Drucker, 1943, p. 65, pl. 43. 7 Porter, 1953, p. 25. 8 Idem., pl. 13d. 9 Idem, pl. 13e. 10 Vaillant, 1930, pl. 39 bottom row; 1931, pl. 81, fourth row, no. 9; and 1935, p. 236. 205 VOL. 11, 1955</page><page sequence="2">206 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY In the course of an excavation in 1953 conducted under my direction by the students of the archaeology class of the San Carlos University Summer School, one of our laborers, Sr Jose Domingo Rosales, found a well-preserved clay mask representing a human face."

The clay mask shown here as Fig. 2a, a', is made of a well-polished reddish-brown ware containing a great many mica particles. This "micaceous ware" has been associated with the Las Charcas period and was used almost exclusively in the manufacture of the usually solid, handmade Las Charcas figurines. The height of the mask is 10.4 cm. It is 11.8 cm wide and the inner concavity is 2 cm deep. The eyes are represented by two slits, and six tool indentations mark the upper teeth. The individual represented by the mask has a fleshy nose, protruding lips, a small receding chin, and rather full cheeks. The facial characteristics of the mask correspond in all respects to those of the "realistic" portrait-like Las Charcas figurines. The exterior of the mask is well-polished whereas the interior is only roughly scraped and smoothed. It has two bifurcated suspension holes, one near the right temple and the other in the upper part of the left ear. It would appear that the mask was originally perforated symmetrically at both temples but that in ancient times the upper left portion of the mask broke off and the owner was forced to drill another hole. Although the mask was discovered in a pit which contained a mixed lot of Las Charcas, Providencia, and Miraflores artifacts, the micaceous reddish-brown ware of which it is made undoubtedly places it within the Las Charcas period. Since the Las Charcas culture is presumed to be older than Tlatilco, this clay mask is earlier than the Tlatilco specimens. In Guatemala, as in Mexico, the manufacture of clay masks continued after the close of the Pre-Classic or Formative horizon. Although rare, they are present in the Late Classic period and are most common in the Alta Verapaz region. There are seven large clay masks representing human and grotesque faces in the Diesel- dorff collection in the Guatemala Museum.'3 Of the seven, five have eye, mouth, and suspension holes, while the remainder have only mouth and suspension holes. They were found by the late E. P. Dieseldorff during his excavations in the vicinity of Coban, and in the Sanimtaci cave, Alta Verapaz. Some of the grctesque faces show distinct feline and serpent characteristics. Since the specimens in the Diesel- dorff collection were not uncovered during controlled excavations, it would be pre- carious to try to date them, were it not for an almost identical mask"4 from Chipoc, Alta Verapaz (see Fig. 2b, b'). This fragmentary specimen was excavated by R. E. Smith of the Carnegie Institution in 1944, and the associated material indicates it to be of Late Classic date.'5 It is made of a superficially smoothed and 12 Porter, 1953, pl. ib; also see Shook, 1951, p. 96. 13 Dieseldorff, 1926, vol. 1, table 7, nos. 25 and 26; Villacorta and Villacorta, 1930, p. 349; and Guatemalan Museum Guide book, 1948, p. 8, figure in upper left corner. 14 Guat.

The sharp "eagle" nose is perforated and the mouth open. Five sharp tool marks beneath the upper lip indicate teeth. When complete it may have shown ten to twelve teeth. Above the eyes there are narrow slits, probably to enable the wearer to see. The height of the mask is 13.5 cm and the width of what remains of the face is 9 cm, suggesting an original width of approximately 18 cm. Above the left ear are two suspension holes indicating that originally there were four holes, two over each ear. In the Guatemala Museum collection there is another Late Classic mask."1 Although fragmentary it clearly represents an aged human face and is of the miniature type (4 cm high). It is from Santa Anita, El Jobo, in the Department of Santa Rosa. It has three suspension holes. No examples of clay masks have yet been found from the Post-Classic period in the southern Maya area but Kubler illustrates two clay masks in the Arensberg collection from central Mexico.17 The larger specimen is 13.5 cm high, while the smaller one is only 5 cm in height. Both have eye and mouth holes and large upturned noses. They also have intricate linear markings suggesting face painting or tattooing. Kubler believes that the upturned nose may represent an Aztec carica- ture of their Huaxtec neighbors. Anthropomorphic effigy vessels, ladle censers, and incense burners with similarly upturned-nosed individuals are characteristic how- ever of the Post-Classic period in Guatemala,18 and therefore the suggestion that they represent caricatures of the Huaxtecs is open to doubt. Probably they repre- sent some manifestation of the long-nosed rain god. The green or black stone mask-like heads or "amulets" with upturned noses from Nebaj, Oncap, Chipal, and Zacualpa in the northern and southeastern Quiche region, may represent the Guatemalan counterparts of the clay masks illustrated by Kubler. They are usually small, 4 to 7 cm in height, and many have bifurcated suspension holes.'" The manufacture of clay masks continues today in Guatemala. In Figure 2c, c' I illustrate a typical example of the pottery masks made in the village of Santa Cruz Chinautla, a small Pokoman Indian town about twelve miles northeast of Guatemala City. The Chinautla handmade pottery is probably the best known and best executed pottery in Guatemala today. The well fired and beautifully painted Red-on-white, White-on-red, and plain yellowish-orange ware jars, bowls, pitchers, and effigy whistles are favored by many Indian housewives and are car- ried by the native merchants to all parts of Guatemala.20 These modern pottery masks, although not made in any quantity, are interesting examples of the artistic 16 Guat.

The specimen illustrated here is 15.5 cm high, 13.5 cm wide, and has an inner concavity 4.5 cm deep. It has eye and mouth holes made in the form of narrow slits. It is made of the regular Chinautla yellowish- orange ware, is well fired, and is polished on the exterior. The interior is unslipped and unpolished. The prominent nose is pinched together at the tip. The chin is protruding and nine tool marks indicate the teeth. The curly moustache is applied and shows ten tool indentations on each side of the nose. The eyebrows and eyelids are represented by tool marks. The masks usually have three suspension holes punched from the exterior. The pottery masks from Chinautla are used in Chinautla and elsewhere in the Guatemalan highlands to cover the faces of Indian dancers during festival ceremonies. Masks with moustaches usually represent Span- iards, and are used in dance dramas in which the conquest of Guatemala by Pedro de Alvarado is reienacted. Since the head of the dancer is swathed in scarves the size of the actual mask does not have to be great. From the above it is obvious that clay masks, although they have not been found in quantity, must have been in continuous use throughout Mesoamerica from the Formative period to the present. The purpose for which the pre-Colum- bian masks were used and by whom they were worn is still an open question. The eye and mouth holes on the larger specimens suggest that they were true, i. e., functional, masks in contrast to the many jade, granitic rock, and limestone mask- like "face-panel" carvings so common in central Mexico, especially in Teotihuacan and Guerrero.21 The fact that the pottery masks were occasionally made in minia- ture complicates the problem. Possibly these were simply representations of the real masks, and since most of them have suspension holes, they may have been worn as amulets, pectorals, or pendants. Miniature (4 to 6 cm high) brightly painted pottery and wooden masks are still manufactured in Guatemala in the towns of Chichicastenango and Totonicap~in. On stela 11 at Yaxchilan, Chiapas, Mexico, tattooed prisoners are represented with bound arms kneeling before an elaborately clothed priest who wears the mask of the Sun God.22 This stone carving, dating about 752 AD, suggests that masks were worn by priests, possibly to conceal their identity and inspire fear among the uninitiated. Perhaps the larger pottery masks found among archaeo- logical collections were used for similar purposes. We know that among the Aztecs masks were often used in temple ceremonies when a god was impersonated. In many of the codices even the gods are sometimes represented wearing masks. For example when Quetzalcoatl appeared as Ehecatl, god of the wind, he was pictured wearing a red mask, which resembled a bird's beak, while Mixcoatl usually was represented with a black mask. Certainly masks must have played an important 21 Kubler, 1954, figs. 15-23, 87-89, 93, 109, 119. 22 Thompson, 1942, pl. 3, and 1954, fig. 15.</page><page sequence="7">POTTERY MASK TRADITION 211 part in pre-Columbian rituals and may have represented gods, spirits, deified heroes or even totem animals and nahuals. The practice of making and wearing masks is a nearly universal preoccupation of mankind. Masks also may have been used to intensify the religious feeling in a community and to permit escape from the burdens of reality into a world of mystery and drama. Such seems to have been the object of the masked dancers on the Bonampak murals.23 The inevitable accompaniment of any feast day among the present day Mayas of the Guatemalan Highlands is a masked dance drama. Although the masks used for these dances are in most cases made of carved, richly painted or gilded wood and represent many post-Columbian features,24 there is no doubt of their pre-Columbian affiliations. It is interesting to note in this connection that the present centers of pottery, gourd, or wooden mask manufacture (Chinautla, Chichicastenango, Totonicapin, Cob~in and Rabinil) coincide closely with the pre-Columbian distribution of pottery and stone masks in Guatemala. A good case for the regional mask manufacturing tradition as a cultural continuum is therefore evident (see Fig. 1). Mention should be made, however, of two other uses for masks in the southern Maya area. Effigy masks to cover the faces of a "scarecrow" type of image with sacred connotations, such as "Maximon," "Judas," etc. are made in several villages in the Guatemalan Highlands, most notably Santiago Atitlan and San Pedro La Laguna.25 These are distinguished from the ordinary dance mask by the lack of eye slits and mouth openings, although a small hole may sometimes be carved between the lips for the purposes of inserting a cigar or cigarette. Some of the pre-Columbian masks without eye holes may also have been used to cover the faces of sacred images or idols. As a matter of fact there are several references to "masks of wood" in connection with idols in the testimonies taken at the time of the auto de fe and the investigations regarding idolatry in 1562 in Yucatan.26 Other masks, especially the "face-panel" type, either with or without eye holes, were very probably used in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica as death masks. They may have been put over the face or attached to the outside of the bundle containing the dead person as was frequently done with the mummy bundles of ancient Peru. The fact that some of the pottery, stone, or jade masks actually were discovered in burials, would seem to corroborate this theory. In summary, the following four categories of pre-Columbian pottery and other masks can be suggested for Mesoamerica in accordance with their size and func- tion: (1) True mask; (2) Effigy mask; (3) Death mask; (4) Pendant mask. 23 Thompson, 1954, pl. 17b. 24 Lothrop, 1927, figs. 25, 26, 28, 29; Lothrop, 1929, figs. 1, 2. 25 Lothrop, 1929, figs. 9, 11. 26 See Tozzer, 1941, pp. 77, 103, 111.</page><page sequence="8">212 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY BIBLIOGRAPHY DIESELDORFF, E.
