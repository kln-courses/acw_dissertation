Anestis') (Department of Anthropology &amp; Reproductive Ecology Laboratory, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06520) (Accepted: 6 January 2005) Summary Remarkable individual variation in primate personalities is evident to those who study them, but the concept of 'personality' has nevertheless received little attention in the nonhuman primate literature. In this study, I introduce a novel implementation of a method to quantify primate personality or behavioral style based on ethological observations and use it to test several predictions about the relationship between personality and dominance rank in young captive chimpanzees living at the New Iberia Research Center in New Iberia, Louisiana. I demonstrate that while some behavioral styles are related to dominance rank (smart, aggres- sive, playful, and mellow), others are not (affiliative and friendly). Furthermore, dominance rank is a poor predictor of stress as reflected by baseline urinary cortisol levels, but individ- uals who score highly in the 'smart' behavioral style component show significantly higher cortisol levels than those whose scores in this component are low, perhaps reflecting different stress levels experienced by these two groups. I discuss the implications of these findings and encourage researchers of animal behavior to consider behavioral style an important variable in their study populations, as it may ultimately help us further our understanding of social evolution and life histories. Keywords: Chimpanzees, cortisol, stress, personality, behavioral style, dominance rank. Introduction What is behavioral style and why study it? Personality has been defined in a number of ways by researchers studying both humans and nonhumans, but most definitions include reference to a 1) Corresponding author's e-mail address: stephanie.anestis@yale.edu © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2005 Behaviour 142, 1245-1268 Also available online -</page><page sequence="2">1246 Anestis suite of characteristics that remains relatively stable over time and that in- fluences an individual's behavior in response to its environmental and sit- uational variables (Clarke &amp; Boinski, 1995; John &amp; Gosling, 2000). While human personality research often includes concepts such as beliefs, motives, and life stories, research on nonhumans is limited to those aspects of indi- viduals that can be observed, and has therefore focused on the identification of personality traits (Gosling et al., 2003). Various terms including personal- ity, temperament, and style are sometimes used interchangeably; here I use the term 'behavioral style' to refer to this somewhat narrower concept of observable traits. Behavioral style is associated with physiology in interesting ways, and can therefore affect the basic growth, maintenance, and reproductive func- tions of an organism. In humans, individuals with certain personality types have been found to be more susceptible to illness, to heal more slowly, and to exhibit higher levels of stress hormones (Grossarthmaticek &amp; Eysenck, 1990; Schmitz, 1992; Spangler, 1997; Bruce et al., 2002; Smith &amp; Zautra, 2002). Similarly, individual variation in behavioral styles or personalities in nonhumans results in differences in baseline levels of stress and disease sus- ceptibility (Higley et al., 1991; Virgin &amp; Sapolsky, 1997; Kaplan &amp; Manuck, 1998; Kalin et al., 2000), as well as differential responses to physical or psychosocial challenge (Davidson et al., 1993; Capitanio et al., 1999). Fit- ness differences resulting from personality variation can also be measured directly (birds: Dingemanse et al., 2004; bighorn ewes: Reale et al., 2000; humans: Eaves et al., 1990; reviewed in Dingemanse &amp; Reale, this volume), though the literature on this topic is sparse (Wilson et al., 1994). Ultimately, we would like to know whether certain behavioral styles result in higher fit- ness than others, and whether certain traits are associated with particularly high or low fitness. Quantifying nonhuman primate behavioral style variation Remarkable individual variation in behavioral style has long been evident to researchers who study nonhuman primates. For example, adult male chim- panzees use various approaches to try to obtain high dominance rank, and their concern with rank varies (de Waal, 1982; Goodall, 1986; Nishida &amp; Hosaka, 1996). Altmann (1980) noted two distinct baboon mothering styles, restrictive and 'laissez-faire,' that were not entirely predicted by rank. Strier</page><page sequence="3">Behavioral style in chimpanzees 1247 et al. (2002) described two male muriquis with similar rates of association with other males, but observed that only one was active in maintaining these associations; they suggest that these males were employing disparate 'social styles'. Despite the acceptance of behavioral style as an important feature of pri- mate sociality, this variable has received little formal, quantitative attention in the nonhuman primate literature. There are several reasons for this, in- cluding the fact that primate social behavior is so complex and that practical and ethical considerations limit us to correlational, rather than experimental, data. Some authors have also argued that a fear of anthropomorphism has kept primate researchers from considering individual variation in behavioral style as anything but 'noise' in the data (Clarke &amp; Boinski, 1995; Gosling et al., 2003). Nevertheless, a few authors have attempted to quantify primate behav- ioral style variation using methods derived from studies of human personal- ity (Buirksi et al., 1978; Stevenson-Hinde &amp; Zunz, 1978; Martau et al., 1985; Higley et al., 1991; Bolig et al., 1992; Gold &amp; Maple, 1994; McGuire et al., 1994; Capitanio, 1999; Heath-Lange et al., 1999; Laudenslager et al., 1999; King &amp; Landau, 2003; Martin, 2005; reviewed in Gosling et al., 2003) or standard ethological techniques (van Hooff, 1973; Sapolsky &amp; Ray, 1989; de Lathouwers &amp; van Elsacker, 2004). For example, Sapolsky &amp; Ray (1989) used focal observations to compare savanna baboon males on a set of four behavioral style traits, and concluded that low basal levels of cortisol char- acterize certain styles of dominance, rather than being associated with high rank per se. However, compared to the number and sophistication of stud- ies on other aspects of primate behavior, primate behavioral style research is lagging. This study attempts to address this imbalance by emphasizing the fact that primate behavioral style variation is both quantifiable and important to our understanding of individual variation. Cortisol, stress, and reproductive success Cortisol is an adrenal steroid hormone secreted in vertebrates in response to stressful or aversive stimuli. It prepares an organism to deal with a threat, di- verting energy from long-term physiological processes towards those that en- hance immediate survival (Sapolsky, 1993). However, chronically high levels of circulating cortisol lead to decreased immunity, decreased cardiovascular</page><page sequence="4">1248 Anestis health, and a host of other physiological problems (Riley, 1981; Sapolsky &amp; Pulsinelli, 1985; Goujon et al., 1997; McEwen, 1999; Rabin, 1999; Avit- sur, et al., 2001; Fuchs &amp; Flugge, 2003). Because this hormone is an impor- tant biomarker that may reflect energetic allocation between survivorship and other life history needs, cortisol assays provide information on physiological factors that can influence fitness. The relationship between stress, cortisol, and behavioral variables has been investigated in many animals. There is some evidence that high rates of aggression can increase cortisol levels in both aggressors (Muller &amp; Wrang- ham, 2004) and recipients (Scallet et al., 1981; Steklis et al., 1986; Martensz et al., 1987; Wallner et al., 1999), and that conversely positive social in- teractions such as post-conflict affiliation may reduce stress (Aureli et al., 1989, 1999; de Waal, 1989). In primates, a primary question of interest has been how baseline cortisol varies with dominance rank. Results have been mixed: some authors report a positive association, with higher-ranking in- dividuals exhibiting higher cortisol (Mendoza et al., 1979; Cavigelli et al., 2003; Muller &amp; Wrangham, 2004), others a negative one (Manogue et al., 1975; Golub et al., 1979; Keverne et al., 1982), and in some cases no re- lationship has been found (Yodyingyuad et al., 1982; Steklis et al., 1986; McGuire et al., 1986; Martensz et al., 1987; Stavisky et al., 2001; Weingrill et al., 2004). Several explanations have been proposed for the variation in outcome, including variation in social stability (Sapolsky, 1983; McGuire et al., 1986; Goymann &amp; Wingfield, 2004). Some variation may also be ex- plained by the complexity of the variables involved and the fact that stud- ies of cortisol and dominance rank include both captive and wild primates, cooperative and noncooperative breeders, and single and multimale groups. In this study I propose that the inconsistent relationship between dominance rank and cortisol in previous studies can be partially explained by the neglect of another crucial variable, namely behavioral style. Study aims Chimpanzees are an excellent species in which to investigate the concept of behavioral style because individual differences independent of dominance status are evident (de Waal, 1982; Goodall, 1986; Nishida &amp; HIosaka, 1996). Although chimpanzee social behavior is relatively well studied, behavioral styles have not been quantified except in a few cases where rater-based meth- ods were used (Buirski et al., 1978; Lilienfield et al., 1999; Weiss et al., 2000;</page><page sequence="5">Behavioral style in chimpanzees 1249 King &amp; Landau, 2003). This study uses a method modified from Sapolsky &amp; Ray (1989) to quantify behavioral style variation in captive peer groups of young chimpanzees. The aims of this study were to develop a method to quantify behavioral style, to measure how much it varies in a population of young chimpanzees, and to examine whether differences in behavioral style could explain differ- ences in baseline urinary cortisol. Specifically, I was interested in investigat- ing whether: (1) Behavioral styles in young chimpanzees are independent of dominance rank. In macaques, baboons, and chimpanzees, similarly ranked animals may ex- hibit very different behavioral styles (e.g., Nash &amp; Chamove, 1981; de Waal, 1982; Sapolsky &amp; Ray, 1989; Virgin &amp; Sapolsky, 1997), suggesting that dominance rank and behavioral style are not synonymous. However, if some overlap between behavioral styles and dominance rank is evident, we may gain some insight into how rank is achieved and maintained; for example, do individuals with particular behavioral styles have greater success at obtaining high rank? (2) Baseline urinary cortisol is related to rank. The relationship between cortisol and dominance rank varies both among and within species, and evidence has been found for both positive and nega- tive associations between these two variables (see above). (3) Baseline urinary cortisol differences are related to differences in behavioral style. Once behavioral styles are identified, we can make predictions about whether certain behavioral styles are more likely to lead to high baseline cortisol levels than are others. Methods Study site and groups This study was conducted at the University of Louisiana's New Iberia Re- search Center (NIRC) in New Iberia, Louisiana, intermittently from 1999-</page><page sequence="6">1250 Anestis Table 1.

Periodic observations approximately two months in length were conducted annually for four research periods, each about one year apart (7 months of observation total). Only urine samples (no behavioral data) were collected in 1999. The chimpanzees live in indoor-outdoor enclosures (approximately 5 x 6 x 5 m3 outdoors and 5 x 3 x 3 m3 indoors) with con- tinuous access to toys and water. They are fed a standard monkey chow diet at 1500 hr, but the caretakers distribute fruits or vegetables daily at around 1000 hr and occasionally again at 1300 hr. The subjects of this study lived in juvenile and adolescent male/female peer groups consisting of individuals who spent variable portions of their early development with their mothers (range 0-7 years), and all subjects were born in captivity. Group size varied but ranged between 5 and 12 individuals (Table 1). Groups remained stable over the course of an observation season, but did change between seasons, resulting in changes in dominance rank and group size. Behavioral data collection and analysis Observation sessions were spread evenly across all groups, giving equal time to early morning, late morning, afternoon, and evening sessions. The data presented here are based on all-occurrences recording of all social inter- actions using an ethogram modified from Nishida et al. (1999). To reduce bias towards more active individuals or those located closer to me, I visually scanned the group constantly in a predetermined order. If a social interaction began that demanded full attention (e.g., an extended agonistic encounter) the scanning was dropped temporarily, and some social interactions were probably missed. I constructed dominance hierarchies using matrices of pant-grunts and supplants, and assessed linearity of hierarchies using MatMan (Noldus v</page><page sequence="7">Behavioral style in chimpanzees 1251 1.1, 2003). In some cases no pant-grunts or supplants were observed within dyads (year 2: 4 of 66 dyads; year 3: 45 of 143 dyads; year 4: 26 of 100 dyads); the rank relationship between these individuals was assigned using data from interactions with other group members, and was supported by the relatively low turnover rate (percent of supplants and pant-grunts that went against the hierarchy; mean 3%, range zero to 11% for the 10 groups). I did not observe any rank changes within field seasons (though ranks did change between years). The raw rank scores for each individual were con- verted to a 0 to 5 scale to correct for varying group size. For analyses involv- ing 'low', 'medium', and 'high' ranking data groupings, individuals were divided as equally as possible among the three categories (for example in groups of 8 individuals, 3 were counted as 'high', 2 as 'medium', and 3 as 'low'). Aggressive behaviors included attacks, chases, hits, and threats. 'Ag- onism' included any aggression as well as pant-grunts, displays, and sup- plants. 'Friends' were those dyads whose combined touch, groom, and hug frequencies were greater than the mean for all dyads in their group; individ- uals could have more than one friend. Rates of behaviors were calculated by dividing raw counts by the total number of ad-lib observation hours for that group. I used parametric statistics when samples exhibited homoscedascity and independence, and nonparametric statistics otherwise (alpha always at 0.05, two-tailed tests except where noted). I calculated Kendall's coefficient of correlation to test for associations between rank and behavioral style com- ponents, and to test for associations between cortisol, rank, and age. I used Pearson correlations (r) to test for associations between cortisol and behav- ioral style components, and partial correlations to test for an association be- tween rank and cortisol controlling for age. T-tests and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to assess differences in baseline urinary cortisol between subgroups of individuals (e.g., the two sexes, and individuals scoring high or low in certain components). Behavioral style indices and principal components analyses Instead of using raw data on behavior frequencies to compare individuals, I created behavioral style indices (Table 2) that capture the spectrum of behav- iors exhibited by these chimpanzees. These indices are intended to describe not just how often an individual engages in behavior X, Y, or Z, but also</page><page sequence="8">1252 Anestis Table 2. Behavioral style indices and how they are calculated. Index Calculation Chooses safe interac- Approaches lower-ranking (LR) individuals more often than ex- tions pected based on the # of available LR individuals Initiates winnable ag- % of agonistic interactions initiated &amp; won (opponent pant onistic interactions grunts, runs, moves, screams, cries, and/or gives fear face) Uses coalitions % of aggressive interactions (attack, hit, threaten, and/or chase) in which individual formed a coalition either as initiator or by joining a third party Coalition partners # of different coalition partners used in the study period, cor- rected for the number of individuals in the group Is aggressive % of initiated social interactions that are aggressive (attack, hit, threaten and/or chase) Is mellow % of 'no reaction' responses to approaches by group members Does not react % of 'no reaction' responses to aggression (attack, hit, threaten, and/or chase) against self Participates in groom- % of total # of group grooming sessions in which individual was ing a participant Gets groomed % of individual's total grooming sessions as groomee Play offers accepted % of play offers to other group members that are accepted (re- sult in a play session) Play partners # of different play partners over the study period, corrected for total number of individuals in group Participates in play % of total # of group play sessions in which individual was a participant Has friends # of different friends (defined in text) divided by the total num- ber of individuals in the group Spreads friendship % of affiliation (groom, hug, and/or touch) with primary partner Is affiliative % of initiated social interactions that are affiliative (groom, hug, and/or touch) some aspect of his or her behavioral style. For example, 'agonistic encoun- ters initiated and won' tells us something about how 'smart' an individual is about initiating agonism with individuals that may or may not show submis- sion. An individual with a score close to 1 in this index consistently initiates</page><page sequence="9">Behavioral style in chimpanzees 1253 agonism that he/she can win, while an individual with the lowest score in this index is the least likely to initiate winnable fights. None of the indices is based on subjective rating; all are calculated from the ad-lib data. I was specifically interested in pinpointing behavioral variables that are not known to vary with age or group size. This generally involved using a method for standardization, often by dividing by the total number of indi- viduals in the group and/or the total value for a particular type of behavior. For example, while play rates almost certainly change with age, the percent- age of all play interactions in the group in which an individual participates may not. Likewise, while aggressive interactions may be more infrequent in smaller groups, group size may not affect the percentage of total interactions initiated by a particular individual that are aggressive. The behavioral style indices also reduce the influence of dominance relationships, which may be consequences of behavioral style - and of age and body size - rather than causes of variation in behavioral style. Some behavioral style indices are inter-dependent (e.g., the three play in- dices should covary), and some indices that are not immediately obvious covariates may actually be correlated. To investigate the relationships be- tween variables in the sample, I used principal components analysis (PCA) to reduce the data - including all index scores for all individuals in the sam- ple, with the three years combined - to a set of principal factors. Data were log-transformed before PCA to reduce skew and kurtosis. I used Varimax ro- tation with Kaiser normalization, and included only factors with eigenvalues &gt; 1. I defined the dominant indices (those driving variation in components) as those with values over 0.6 or under -0.6. Urine collection and analysis Measuring hormone levels in urine samples is ideal for studies of baseline levels of hormones because (1) collection is noninvasive and stress-free for the animals and (2) samples represent smooth averages of hormones excreted since the last void. Urine collection in captivity can be challenging when in- dividuals are socially housed because of cross-contamination and limited re- searcher access to individual animals. I solved these problems by using pos- itive reinforcement to train the chimpanzees to urinate into 3 oz. disposable paper cups, which I held close enough to the enclosure mesh to catch a suf- ficient volume. Individuals were rewarded for urinating near the enclosure</page><page sequence="10">1254 Anestis mesh with small pieces of desirable food items (e.g., raisins), and training proceeded opportunistically and simultaneously among all individuals in an enclosure. Once the animals are trained, this method results in an extremely efficient collection system that can yield many samples over a short period of time. Urine was not collected simultaneously with behavioral data. Urine was immediately transferred to labeled tubes and refrigerated within three hours. Samples were frozen at -20°C no more than 12 hours after collection. Before freezing, samples greater than 0.5 ml in volume were tested on 10 UA Chemstrips (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN) to determine urine pH, specific gravity, and to check for abnormalities such as the presence of blood. Samples were shipped at the end of the collection period via next day air on dry ice and arrived frozen at the Reproductive Ecology Laboratory at Yale University. The Yale University Animal Care and Use Committee approved all procedures used in this study, and all collection protocols fell under the New Iberia Research Center's guidelines. Not all individuals in this study were trained due to time constraints and noncompliance. Therefore analyses involving cortisol in this study include only 23 individuals (some represented in more than one research period), and more males than females (70% males). I only included individuals with a minimum of four samples per observation year that were successfully assayed for both cortisol and creatinine. Cortisol The competitive binding cortisol assay protocol was developed by Knott (1997) based on a human salivary assay (Ellison, 1988). The assay uses a (1, 2, 6, 7) tritium tracer, cortisol specific antibody and a charcoal separation step. Briefly, urine samples were assayed after dilution at a 1:10 ratio with HPLC water. Two standard curves were run in each assay using standard in a buffer solution (Steraloids Q 3880, Newport, RI), each dosage in triplicate. Tracer (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), standard, and unknowns within samples were allowed to compete for binding to the antibody (# 07- 121016, MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA; formerly ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA) overnight at 40C. The following day dextran-coated charcoal was added to the sample and standard curve tubes, vortexed, and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes, allowing the unbound tracer to bind to the charcoal. Samples were spun in a refrigerated centrifuge for 20 minutes so that the charcoal and unbound tracer formed a pellet at the bottom of each</page><page sequence="11">Behavioral style in chimpanzees 1255 tube. The supernatant was poured off, combined with scintillation fluid, and counted on a Wallac liquid scintillation counter (model 1409 DSA). The antibody used in this assay displays 100% cross-reactivity with corti- sol, 11.4% with 21-desoxycorticosterone, 8.9% with 1 1-desoxycortisol, and 1.6% with corticosterone. Other cross-reactivities are less than 1%. Curves were calculated using AssayZap software for the Macintosh (BioSoft, Inc., Cambridge, UK). Assay sensitivity was 5 ng/ml; samples that fell below this value were eliminated. Samples whose duplicates were more than 10% dif- ferent were run again. Samples were run sequentially in the order in which they were collected in a total of 59 assays, with a new set of quality controls beginning with assay 28. Cortisol intra-assay variation averaged 7.2%. Inter-assay variation, estimated for the 59 assays from urine pools with varying levels of cortisol, averaged 21.3% (low), 17.6% (medium), and 9.1% (high). Chimpanzee cortisol exhibits a distinct diurnal rhythm that can affect samples collected as little as half an hour apart (Anestis &amp; Bribiescas, 2004). I therefore converted each raw cortisol score to a residual value obtained from the regression of cortisol on time of day. Individual averages were calculated using these residual values. Samples collected during or within 24 hours after a known stressor were excluded. Known stressors in this sample were any of the following: a routine physical exam; severe wounding with blood loss; forced restriction to the indoor part of the enclosure for more than 2 hours, which occurred in the 2002 season due to a hurricane; transfer to a new enclosure; addition or removal of one or more individuals from one's enclosure; and behavioral enrichment exercises, which are probably not stressors but their potential hormonal effects are unknown. Creatinine I used a colorimetric assay for creatinine based on a protocol developed by Knott (1997) based on the Jaffe reaction (Taussky, 1954). I used four creatinine standards at concentrations of 0.5, 1.0, 3.0, and 10.0 (Sigma- Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Urine samples were assayed at the same dilution used to determine cortisol (1:10 in HPLC water). Samples that fell below 0.5 mg Cr were eliminated.</page><page sequence="12">1256 Anestis Results PCA explained 67% of the behavioral variation in the sample, and no single factor explained more than 15%. The behavioral style indices included in the analysis (Table 2) loaded onto six principal factors. Two indices - initiates winnable fights [smart agonism] and chooses safe interactions [chooses safe] - did not load strongly on any one factor. I named factors according to the indices loading on them (Table 3): 'smart', 'affiliative', 'playful', 'aggres- sive', 'friendly', and 'mellow'. No index loaded strongly onto more than one principal factor. Principal components analysis yielded a style score for each individual in each behavioral style component. These scores served as independent variables in tests of hypotheses about individual variation. Individuals could score highly on more than one component, and components do not represent opposite extremes along a spectrum (e.g., a high score on the 'affiliative' component does not necessarily preclude a high score on the 'aggressive' component). Rather, each behavioral style can be conceptualized as a spec- Table 3. Principal components and loading scores for each index, with load- ings &gt; 0.6 or &amp;lt; -0.6 marked(*).

Behavioral styles and dominance ranks In this analysis, I hypothesized that three of the six components derived from the behavioral data (affiliative, playful, friendly) would not be correlated with rank and that three others (smart, aggressive, mellow) would be. These hy- potheses are based on the observation that high-ranking individuals (1) may attract grooming in exchange for tolerance/support and use coalitions in ag- onistic interactions (smart component), (2) use aggression to maintain their high social status (aggressive component), and (3) tend to react less when ap- proached (mellow component), probably because they have less to fear and are less likely to engage in submissive signaling such as pant-grunting. The hypothesis that the affiliative and friendly components would not be related to rank was supported (affiliative: N = 80, Kendall's r = 0.03, p = 0.71; friendly: N = 80, r = -0.06, p = 0.44; Table 4). The playful component was related to rank, with higher playful component scores in lower-ranking individuals (N = 80, T = 0.16, p = 0.04). The hypothesis that the smart, aggressive, and mellow components would be related to rank was also supported, with higher aggressive (N = 80, -T = -0.33, p = 0.001) and mellow (N = 80, -r = -0.32, p = 0.001) component scores in higher-ranking individuals. The smart component showed a significant association with rank in the opposite direction to that expected (N = 80, T = 0.17, p = 0.03); low-ranking individuals scored higher in this category than high-ranking individuals. Table 4. Correlation between each principal component and dominance rank (Kendall's r); significant associations marked. Since lower numbers repre- sent higher ranks, a negative correlation indicates a positive association be- tween that component and rank.

Low, medium, and high-ranking groups differed significantly in the smart (df = 79, F = 3.5, p = 0.03), playful (df = 79, F = 3.3, p = 0.04), aggressive (df = 79, F = 12.1, p = 0.001), and mellow (df = 79, F = 7.9, p = 0.001) components, but not the affiliative (df = 79, F = 0.07, p = 0.93) or friendly (df = 79, F = 0.26, p = 0.77) components, consistent with the results presented in Table 4. Baseline urinary cortisol and rank A total of 1,475 urine samples were analyzed for this study. Of these, 1,262 were used in the analysis of cortisol and time of day because they fit the following criteria: (1) both cortisol and creatinine results fell within assay range and replicates were within 10% of each other and (2) they were not collected during or one day after any known stressful event. Only those samples from individuals for whom behavioral data were collected in a given year, and for whom there were a minimum of four analyzed samples in that year, are included in the remaining analyses presented below (N = 1076). All samples from an individual in a given year were corrected for time of day and averaged to create a single value per individual per year (mean 23 samples per individual, SD 18). A total of 43 individual averages are included in these analyses (23 individuals, some sampled in more than one year). I did not make specific predictions about the direction of the association between cortisol and rank because the evidence for this association is mixed. Age was significantly correlated with baseline urinary cortisol (N = 43, Kendall's r = -0.37, p = 0.001), but males and females did not differ (df = 41, t = 0.07, p = 0.94). Cortisol and rank were not significantly correlated in this sample (N = 43, Kendall's T = 0.12, p = 0.12), even after controlling for age (N = 40, Pearson r = 0.10, p = 0.51). Cortisol was also not significantly associated with either aggression given (N = 43, r = 0.06, p = 0.69) or aggression received (N = 43, r = 0.26, p = 0.10), which did not change after controlling for age (aggression given: N = 40, r = -0.21, p = 0.19; aggression received: N = 40, r = -0.11, p = 0.51).</page><page sequence="15">Behavioral style in chimpanzees 1259 Baseline urinary cortisol and behavioral style I tested the predictions that cortisol would be negatively associated with both the affiliative and mellow components, and positively associated with the aggressive component. These predictions are based on the assumption that high rates of affiliation may minimize the experience of stress, while high rates of aggression may increase it. In addition, individuals who tend to show little reaction to being approached or threatened (e.g., those scoring high in the mellow component) probably perceive their environments as predictable and controllable, two variables known to reduce stress (Sapolsky, 1993). I did not make specific predictions about the relationship between urinary cortisol and the other three components. None of the behavioral style components was significantly correlated with baseline urinary cortisol, though two approached significance (Table 5). The smart component was positively associated with baseline urinary cortisol (N = 43, Pearson r = 0.25, two-tailed p = 0.10), as was the aggressive component (N = 43, r = 0.24, one-tailed p = 0.07). Since these analyses were necessarily conducted including only those individuals for whom uri- nary cortisol data were available, some of the most extreme individuals in various style components were excluded because their cortisol levels were unknown. I therefore also used t-tests to compare the baseline urinary corti- sol level of the individuals in the top and bottom 25% (six lowest, six highest) in each of the six behavioral style components because considering the ex- tremes renders cortisol differences more detectable. To avoid the problem of one individual appearing more than once in each list and potentially intro- ducing bias, I only allowed each individual to be in a top or bottom 25% list once for each component. The six individuals with the highest smart compo- nent scores exhibited significantly higher cortisol levels than the individuals with the lowest six smart component scores (df = 10, t = 2.27, p = 0.047, Table 5.

The top six and bottom six individuals were not significantly differ- ent in average age (Mann-Whitney z = -0.05, p = 0.62), so this variable cannot account for the observed differences in cortisol. A comparison of the top and bottom 25% in the other behavioral style categories yielded no sig- nificant differences in baseline urinary cortisol. Discussion Principal components analysis on a set of fifteen behavioral indices yielded a set of six behavioral style components that describe the range of variation in chimpanzee behavior in this study. Four of the six components were related to rank (aggressive, mellow, smart, and playful), and two were not (affiliative and friendly). The fact that some components are unrelated to rank suggests that understanding behavioral style variation may give us insight into alterna- tive social strategies. For example, in this population alpha individuals varied widely in how much affiliative behavior they initiated and how they spread affiliative behavior throughout their group. On the other hand, the associa- tion between some of the components and rank suggests that, for example, a certain degree of aggression may be a requirement for obtaining high rank. Elucidating which factors are causal is the logical next step; e.g., are 'mel- low' individuals more likely to achieve high rank, or is a 'mellow' style a by-product of enjoying a relatively high position in the social hierarchy? Although the relationship between rank and the aggressive and mellow components was positive as expected, the smart component was negatively</page><page sequence="17">Behavioral style in chimpanzees 1261 correlated with rank, contrary to the expectation that higher-ranking indi- viduals would show higher smart component scores. Three primary indices drove this component: receiving grooming, using coalitions, and having one's play offers accepted. Although grooming is often directed up the hi- erarchy in exchange for social commodities such as tolerance or support (Seyfarth, 1977; Vervaecke et al., 2000; Watts, 2000; Schino, 2001; Barrett et al., 2002), higher-ranking chimpanzees may also groom lower-ranking in- dividuals to maintain their high rank and retain support of allies (Nishida &amp; Hosaka, 1996), which may be the case in this population. High 'smart' scores in lower-ranking individuals may also reflect their greater need to use coalitions in agonistic interactions to have any chance of winning them. In addition, though the effects of rank differences on play have not been explic- itly studied, in this population lower-ranking individuals seem to be more successful at initiating play because play initiations (which are often rough, involving hitting or kicking) are less likely to be misinterpreted as aggres- sion. In this sample, cortisol was unrelated to dominance rank, contrary to studies that have found significant correlations between these two variables (Manogue et al., 1975; Golub et al., 1979; Mendoza et al., 1979; Keverne et al., 1982; Cavigelli et al., 2003; Muller &amp; Wrangham, 2004) but consis- tent with many that have not (Yodyingyuad et al., 1982; Steklis et al., 1986; McGuire et al., 1986; Martensz et al., 1987; Stavisky et al., 2001; Wein- grill et al., 2004). Besides methodological issues in how baseline cortisol is measured (Anestis &amp; Bribiescas, 2004), focusing on only dominance rank makes the evidence difficult to interpret. Assessing the specific costs (e.g., lack of predictability and control) associated with occupying low or high rank (Creel, 2001; Abbott et al., 2003; Goymann &amp; Wingfield, 2004) is a better way to analyze the relationship between cortisol and rank. For exam- ple, Sapolsky (1983) has argued that during periods of social instability, the protective effect of high rank on baseline cortisol disappears, as the security usually afforded to dominant animals is threatened. This may reduce the in- fluence of rank on baseline urinary cortisol. The chimpanzee peer-groups at New Iberia experience frequent social instability because their membership is shuffled (about once a year) when a fast-growing individual becomes too aggressive towards smaller peers (although aggression is mild and wounding is rare). Although they never join a group with completely unfamiliar indi- viduals and never transfer alone, group changes nevertheless introduce social</page><page sequence="18">1262 Anestis instability in this population, ironically as a result of attempts by caretakers to minimize harassment and aggression. The degree of social stability in wild chimpanzee communities also varies, which may influence the salience of other variables that affect baseline urinary cortisol. Future studies that assess the importance of variables in predicting individual differences in cortisol should include both social stability and behavioral style as potentially im- portant factors. Although cortisol was not related to dominance rank, it was associated with behavioral style. Specifically, there was a positive but nonsignificant (p = 0.10) association between both the aggressive and smart components and this hormone. Recently, Muller &amp; Wrangham (2004) found an associ- ation between individual rates of aggression and (afternoon) cortisol levels in wild chimpanzees at Kanyawara, Kibale National Park. They argue that since the hierarchy was stable during their study period, higher levels of cor- tisol in more aggressive (and in their case, more dominant) males may be the result not of psychosocial stress, but of increased metabolic costs associated with energetic expenditure during aggressive acts. There are several reasons why this may not apply in this population, however. Captive animals are un- likely to experience increased metabolic stress as a result of higher rates of aggression because they do not experience periods of low energy availability. Also, although there was a trend toward a positive relationship between cor- tisol and the aggressive component, there was no relationship between rates of aggression and cortisol. Individuals scoring high in the aggressive com- ponent did not necessarily spend a lot of time engaged in aggressive acts; rather, a high percentage of the total social interactions they initiated were aggressive (Table 3). Therefore, although both require further exploration, the hypothesis that psychological factors result in higher cortisol levels in individuals scoring high in the aggressive component is more likely. The smart behavioral style component was also positively associated with baseline urinary cortisol, and individuals in the top 25% of the distribution in smart component scores showed higher levels of cortisol than individuals in the bottom 25%. This is contrary to the expectation that the most socially 'skilled' individuals would show the lowest cortisol levels. One possible ex- planation for this effect is that the individuals with the high smart compo- nent scores are those most concerned with rank (regardless of their ranks), and that this concern increases stress levels. The high smart component in- dividuals are those who spend the most time engaging in such activities as</page><page sequence="19">Behavioral style in chimpanzees 1263 monitoring coalitions (and using them), paying attention to the direction of grooming, and being aware of when other individuals are interested in play- ing (and initiating play appropriately). The evidence presented here suggests that these behaviors impose a physiological cost in the form of high cortisol. Because chronically high cortisol levels can affect an individual's reproduc- tive success by reducing immunocompetence, increasing glucose uptake at the cost of long-term energy storage, and even causing neuron death in the hippocampus (reviewed in Sapolsky, 1993), any such style-related physio- logical costs could influence fitness. An analysis including baseline urinary cortisol data for a greater number of individuals could begin to address this question. If being socially 'smart' carries a cost, what is the benefit? It remains to be seen whether certain behavioral styles enhance reproductive success, per- haps by influencing an individual's success in social relationships. Socially smart individuals, for example, may have higher reproductive success than similarly ranked peers because of their greater success at forming and using coalitions. Their ability to get grooming could reflect more general success at achieving desired effects in relationships. Mating behavior was not included in this study because the study animals were not reproductive, but research on behavioral style components associated with mating (and reproduction) in wild populations would be valuable in testing hypotheses about the rela- tionship between individual variation in style and fitness. Conclusions The animal behavior and especially primate literature is replete with analy- ses that consider the impact of dominance rank on behavioral and physio- logical variables (for reviews see Creel, 2001; Abbott et al., 2003; Goymann &amp; Wingfield, 2004). In many species, an individual's dominance relation- ships with other group members are indeed central to understanding his or her life history, but this variable alone does not paint a complete picture of the animal's social environment. Expanding our focus on dominance rank to include consideration of alternative reproductive tactics and sexual conflict has greatly advanced understanding of primate mating strategies (Gowaty, 1997). In the same way, research on behavioral style could improve our un- derstanding of behavioral endocrinology, which has been narrowly focused</page><page sequence="20">1264 Anestis on possible dominance rank effects. This paper highlights the importance of another variable that (1) is quantifiable, (2) is not entirely synonymous with rank, and (3) has implications for individual variation in physiology and ul- timately reproductive success. Because the underlying behavioral style com- ponents for any given population should be the same, even researchers with slightly different indices will obtain comparable results, allowing for valida- tion of this method in much the same way that personality traits have been validated by repeated analysis of human behavioral style variation.
