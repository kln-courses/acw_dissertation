<plain_text><page sequence="1">AN UNDERWORLD SCENE ON A BLACK-FIGURED LEKYTHOS (PLATE XVIII) THE National Museum at Athens houses many fine vases of the late black-figure and early red-figure technique, as well as the Acropolis fragments, but the display cases which perhaps attract no less attention are those containing the small Attic black-figured lekythoi. The paintings on these vases, making no claim to artistic pretensions and produced in answer to local burial needs, often echo impressions the vase-painters received from the theatre or from figures in monumental painting. It is worth noting that they were inspired not only by well-known myths but also by stories of popular belief which the painters of large vases scorned to represent. The large vases were made and painted for the Italian and Etruscan markets and had to be decorated with impressive themes. On the small lekythos which concerns us here (PLATE XVIII, 1-2), we meet a unique theme which raises a host of questions and leads to a wealth of conjectures.1 The picture is framed by two columns with Doric capitals. The right-hand column, which is the better drawn, spreads to a sort of base, and the painter must have imagined both columns to be of wood. Of the three female figures on either side of the weird figure in the middle, the one on the right, dressed in chiton and himation, turns her head to the left, whilst her feet point to the right. She extends her right arm imperiously, palm open, towards the central figure. The latter is distinguished from the others by the fact that her feet do not appear beneath her himation which hangs below them. Her coiffure differs from that of the others, as we shall see later. It seems clear that she stands not on her own feet but on the body of a black dog with feet projecting beneath and a long, fat, unnatural tail stretching behind, to which is con- nected the hindquarters of a second dog. Its head is somewhat larger than that of the first and ends in a pointed nose which pierces the back of a small human figure. The latter is suspended in mid-air with legs and long arm dangling, his hand touching the nose of the lower dog. The forepaw of the upper dog protrudes menacingly, filling the empty space between its own body and that of the lower dog. On the left are two female figures, dressed like the first. The one immediately behind the central figure extends her right arm with palm open, the other holds an object in her closed fingers. Careful examination shows it to be a flower. On all three figures the unextended arm is hidden beneath the himation; in this way the back or breast of the figure, instead of being seen in side view, is shown flat on the vase surface. The feet of the two women on the left differ from those of the first in being unusually long, particularly on the left-hand figure, but the difference has no significance. For an explanation of the picture we must first consider the two columns. The building 1 Athens NM inv. no. I9765. Ht. to shoulder o* 105 m. Unknown provenance, most likely found in a tomb in Athens. I have the impression that it comes from the same excavation that produced the small lekythos I86o6 (ex Empedocles collection) with the Suppliants scene (to be published in RA 1972). I am sorry that I was unable to show Sir John Beazley these two vases, but they along with some others were locked away and forgotten in an office of the National Museum. Of the five palmettes on the shoulder only the centre one points downwards, almost on the line of the central figure. PLATE XVII, 2, is from an old drawing which I owe to the skill and willing generos- ity of Alex. Kontopoulos. Through the kindness of Barbara Philippaki, I was recently able to check the drawing against the vase. I observed only slight divergencies from the original, as for instance in the wrist of the central figure and, even less marked, in the heads of the two women on the left. For the translation of the Greek text I am indebted to the kindness of Dr Brian Sparkes.</page><page sequence="2">AN UNDERWORLD SCENE ON A BLACK-FIGURED LEKYTHOS 65 they suggest is that known from representations of Herakles and Cerberus, the classic example being the amphora by the Andokides Painter in the Louvre.2 On vases with this scene there is usually a single column shown-sometimes with geison-but the reason is that Herakles is outside Hades.3 On a few early white-ground lekythoi Hades is alluded to by a single column behind the mourning woman holding a lekythos-undoubtedly the dead.4 The two columns on our lekythos, however, show that the scene is imagined inside the underworld. In the same way Hades is represented by two columns on the Ferrara krater with the divine pair.5 But for the location of our scene a more important element in the painting is the weird, monstrous female figure with the dogs, as well as the presence of the small human figure. The latter must be an E'GwAov KaOtdvv-os, stripped of all clothing and condemned to undergo a frightful punishment in Hades. As for the identification of the central figure one should note that she is represented as attached to the two dogs. Besides the absence of feet which we have already noticed, the fact that she is shown shorter and stockier than the others, with larger head, confirms this observation. As the painting is not done with absolute precision, the question arises whether the tail really does belong, as it would appear to do, to the body of the lower dog only, and not to the body of the woman as well. There is the further problem of whether the hindquarters of the upper dog are attached to the large tail of the lower one. An incised line separates the artline of the large tail in the middle, so that the curve of the upper dog's tail perhaps shows that its tail is attached to the body of the woman. Whatever the answers to these questions may be, it seems certain that the whole figure is three-bodied, with the main part female. We might best say that the human body ends at the knees and is attached below and behind to two dogs. Who can this figure be? The choice lies between two monsters, both connected with dogs: Skylla and Hekate. The difficulty with calling the lekythos figure 'Skylla' lies in the fact that she has no real place in the underworld. Even if in earlier thought Skylla was a monster of Hades before becoming a terror to seamen, the relevant evidence is missing, and this location for her does not appear plausible for the fifth century.6 2 Buschor G V2 fig. 155; Arias, Hirmer and Shefton, pls. 88 and xxix; ARV2 4, ii, also p. 1617 and Paralip. 321; Schefold, Propylen fig. 196a and p. 221 (I.

The draw- ing on this vase prompts the suspicion that the seated goddess who holds a sceptre and phiale on an early white-ground lekythos in the National Museum (from the Stathatou collection) is not Hera (ARV2 643, 121, the Providence Painter, and Paralip. 401 'near him'). E. Holmberg in his publication (Opuscula Atheniensia i 81, fig. I = Amandry, Coll. Stathatos iii pl. 24, no 83) calls her Demeter and compares (p. 82, note 8) Plouton with a similar inclination of the head, on a white-ground lekythos in Berlin: Pfuhl, MuZ fig. 531; ARV2 750. It would be more correct to call the goddess on the lekythos in the NM Persephone in Hades. The picture on an early white-ground lekythos in the British Museum (Murray, WA V pl. 21A; Johansen, Attic Grave Reliefs I57, fig. 8o; ARV2 746, 3) of a seated woman holding a lekythos and a pomegranate provides a connection with Buschor's 'Haus und Grab' idea (OJh xxxix [1952] 12 f.). 5 Alfieri, Arias, Hirmer, Spina pls. 74-75; ARV2 1052, 25; Paralip. 444.

We know that at Kolophon black dogs were sacrificed to her,9 that her daughter was Skylla,1o and that she was given the epithets UrKvAaKi-rt, UKGvAaKaYEta, ftAouKVAae, etc." On the lekythos picture she has entrusted to her dogs the punishment of the human shade for some wrongdoing of his in the upper world, impiety to the gods or injustice to men, perhaps matricide. The painter probably wished to indicate not that the dogs are tearing him apart but that they are drinking his blood. Hekate herself is called Aloi-ordtr.'2 This connects with the pdAav attua of the dead which the witch in the second idyll of Theocritus says Hekate seeks, and we learn from our lekythos that she hands over this disgusting task to her dogs. We come now to the unusual headdress that Hekate wears in the painting. That it is not simply hair but some sort of 'sakkos' can be deduced from the horizontal edge below, the two parallel lower lines and from the general shape which is different from the coiffure of the other three women. We venture to suggest that it resembles the related "Ai~8o KUVE7, known chiefly from the Hades of the Etruscan 'Tomba del'Orco', and from the headdress on a plastic vase in the Athens National Museum with a fine representation of Thanatos.13 der Hund 36; Lexikon der alten Welt s.v.; EAA vii o09 f.

As proof of her connexion with popular worship one should remember that Hekate is not referred to in the Homeric poems (Rhode, op. cit. and PW vii 2770 [Heckenbach]). Her elevation to the r61e of Great Mother of earth, sea and sky in Hesiod's Theogony (411-52) we shall not consider here, since, even if the lines themselves are not considered interpolations (see West's edition pp. 276-80), that aspect of her takes us from the themes which concern us here.

D. Mylonas had already called the demon's headgear "A05og Kvv817 (AM vii [1882] 388). Furtwingler was the first to connect this small work with the cap of the Athena Albani (MW I14, note i). If, as Langlotz (Der Triumphierende Perseus 1-4, pls. SI I-12) maintains, the head does not belong to the statue, I would be inclined to believe that it comes from a statue of Hekate. But after recent examina- tion the unity of the statue has been championed once more (forthcoming publication by W. Fuchs in Helbig, Fiihrer4 iv 210-Ii, as D. Willers kindly informs me). So we must return to the old view that the Athena Albani is a copy of the Itonia of Agora- kritos at Coroneia (Furtwingler, MW II3; Fuchs, op. cit. 2II). On the other hand, in a brilliant publication, G. Despinis, following Langlotz in the view that the head does not belong, proposes that the Hope-Farnese Athena was consort to Zeus-Hades in this sanctuary (2vyjflo,) a-ri #ex6q -0ovo pyov a-oil 'AyopaKptrov 5I1-5). In my opinion, the fact that Hekate wears the "A'i6og KvvE27 on our lekythos leads us to conclude that Agorakritos borrowed the head- dress for the Itonia from a non-Attic single-faced statue of Hekate. For Aegina, an important centre for the worship of Hekate, see Kraus, I Io f. It is likely that in the classical period her image was renewed there by a statue which was set next to the wooden one (Pausanias at ii 30.2 put too much trust in the interpreters' belief that it was the work of Myron).

A. Schober has identified a female figure on the west frieze of the temple dedicated to Hekate at Lagina as Hekate herself from the presence of the basket on her head.14 Two female figures to right and left of Hekate give orders for the shade to be punished; the right-hand figure is more peremptory, stretching out her arm. Who then are the three figures with Hekate? We know that the Erinyes lived in the underworld and punished perjurers, particularly matricides.15 One would add 'tyrants' as well, were not the vivid description at the end of Plato's Republic concerning the punishment of tyrants (not however as shown here) so far removed in date from our vase.16 Another female triad that comes to mind is the Fates. But these were above all guardians of fate and not avengers; they have, therefore, no place in the underworld, even though they are connected with Hekate.'7 The august appearance of the figures on our lekythos with long chitons and himatia is no hindrance to their identification with the Erinyes, as Pausanias, describing the statues in the sanctuary of the Semnai, says Tov0-rot S E'TCE' o0 v oEflEpdv.0s Similarly, the well-known small reliefs of the Eumenides from Hekate's sanctuary in the Argolid (recently located, with some good reasoning, near Tiryns)19 raise no feeling of dread. If the last figure on the left of the painting does actually hold a flower, as we have surmised, it serves to emphasise, as on the reliefs, the particular connexion the Eumenides had with fertility and fecundity.20 The older image of the Eumenides which survives in the Argive reliefs was affected by the influence of Aeschylus. Being forced to make his chorus move, the poet gave them a new appearance with a short chiton borrowed from the Harpies (though without the wings), as seen on older paintings. He almost confesses his debt when he says: E18oV rr7o- 'q87 7 E&amp;oWS 7/Eypaq6l/EvacS SE7,rVov cEpovcra-s arEpol 7E eL7jV 1UoEv avrat, tLEAawavat 8" -r~V aEAv'Krpo7roL. 2'1 14 Hekataion von Lagina 70; Kraus, pl.

Christou gives the name Artemis-Hekate to the goddess with the dog on the terracotta pinax from Daimonia at Sparta (AE 1953-4, iii I88 f., fig. I). But the lack of any attribute belonging to Artemis, as well as the fact that the pinax was found in a grave, characterizes her rather as Hekate.

One might compare the lebes gamikos in Syracuse by the Hekate Painter: Trendall, LCS 589, no. 27, pl. 228, 1.</page><page sequence="5">68 SEMNI KAROUZOU It is perhaps not superfluous to mention that Schiller in his poem 'The Cranes of Ibycus' presented another vision and showed the awful terror of the Eumenides chorus as they entered the theatre, clothing them in black: Ein schwarzer Mantel schligt die Lenden, Sie schwingen in entfleischten Hinden Der Fackel dtisterrote Glut, In ihren Wangen fliesst kein Blut. The conclusion to which we are inevitably drawn from the identification of the central figure as Hekate is clear: we have here the only representation of Hekate xOovla, as the Athenians knew her, prior to the work of Pheidias' pupil, Alkamenes. Although this is not the occasion to consider which Hekataion echoes the 'EmrnrrvpytSla of the Propylaea most faithfully, we may briefly consider the opinions germane to the question. Some years ago Eduard Schmidt in his brilliant study of the archaistic style was the first to conclude that the Hekataion in the British School at Athens was not of the Roman period but much earlier, being made soon after the erection of the triple Hekate on the Nike bastion.22 After personal investigation, T. Kraus in his Hekate (to which we shall return below) accepted Schmidt's opinion. Later F. Eckstein devoted an entire essay to a study of this little work and after critical investigation concluded by agreeing with his two pre- decessors.23 These opinions were disputed by Eve Harrison, though she had not seen Eckstein's treatment at the time of writing.24 I have the impression that Eve Harrison, in what is in fact a useful and extensive review of Hekataia, was drawn to her conclusion not only by the Agora material but also by a subconscious belief that contemporary repro- ductions could not have existed. So she assigns a Roman date to those Hekataia which had been thought older, the small example in the British School and the slightly later and larger example from the Agora.25 Today we know many examples of reproductions of famous works in the classical period, so we cannot completely exclude contemporary or slightly later reproductions of the Epipyrgidia. There was a great demand for small Hekataia in Athens at the end of the fifth and in the fourth centuries, and the influence of Alkamenes' recent work would not have been small.26 Eckstein's exemplary study of the British School Hekataion, accompanied as it is by exceptionally fine photographic details, makes any general description of it superfluous. Only two out of the three figures are preserved. Schmidt (op. cit. 48) was the first to cite the 22 Archaistische Kunst 47 f., pl. 24, I and 3. Peter- sen was the first to attempt a detailed division of Hekataion types in AEM iv (I88o) 140 f. and v (1881) I f.

Havelock's rejection of the older and more recent opinions (AJA lxix [1965] 337, note 32): '. . . I am nevertheless compelled to say that without the British School Hekataion as a point of departure and without Schmidt's concep- tion of 4th century archaizing, which is invalid, Kraus' list of fourth century Hekataia becomes extremely suspect.' 26 Reproduction of classical works in contemporary sculpture: Robinson Studies i 674 f.

On the original there would also have been a high basket (not a polos) on her head. Was Alkamenes the first to abandon the terrifying "A'06o KVVwr1 and substitute this type of head-gear?

Thanks to the kindness of the Director of the British School, Dr Catling, I was able to take a fresh look at the piece and was persuaded of the correctness of Schmidt's opinion. This carving must have been done c. 410 B.C., as Eckstein believes. Overlooking some small blemishes which are easily explained in a work of lesser craftsmanship, one has only to consider the beautiful treatment of the folds of the garment over the breast where the deep furrows give them life, or the other, softer, flimsier folds over the thighs. The conclusion to which these facts point is that such harmonious curves would have been impossible in Roman times, because such fine marble carving had been forgotten by then, and also something more important and not unrelated to it: all sculptural sensitivity had declined by that time. For our own enquiry, however, it is more significant that Alkamenes, most likely c. 430 B.C., chose to erect a triple Hekate. Kraus, after considering the older theories, came to the conclusion that this form of Hekate was derived merely from the notion of her 'gerade in ihrer Rolle als Schtitzerin vor Tur und Tor'.27 However, the lekythos picture, in acquainting us with another triple-bodied Hekate, prompts the question-was it perhaps the earlier image of chthonic Hekate attached to two dogs, and not the Trioditis, which determined the triple body? Alkamenes then turned his back on this old terrifying version of popular belief and created the anthropomorphic form. Even though Kraus did not know the lekythos painting, he saw the deeper significance of the change and expressed it well: 'Alkamenes . . . hat als erster das volle k6rperliche Bild geformt, drei midchenhafte Gestalten, denen alles Unheimliche, Schreckliche felt . . . (Alkamenes) schuf daraus das erste dreifache Kultbild vor den Toren des Heiligtums in drei Midchengestalten: Dies ist eine klassische Tat.'28 We might add that only in Periclean Athens was such a realisation, such a step to the anthropomorphic possible. We must presume that the older image of the terrifying triple Hekate was well established, otherwise Alkamenes would have depicted her in the one-bodied form we see on some Attic vases of the fifth century-though, as Kraus observes, they are few in number.29 The Niobid Painter shows her as a single figure, carrying torches in her hands, on his Gigantomachy krater in Ferrara.30 On an excellent painting on another calyx-krater in the same museum her identity is certain from the inscription: Hekakte. The Peleus Painter reveals her peaceful side, as guardian of marriage, lighting the newly-wedded pair, Peleus and Thetis, with torches behind the chariot.31 We meet her again with torches, outside Hades this time, on a krater by the Persephone Painter in the Metropolitan Museum, with the anodos of the goddess.32 I would like to add to these vases a bell-krater in Utrecht with a figure that has remained unexplained until now.33 The scene shows Herakles making ready to attack Cerberus. Only one head of the dog is shown, and above it on a rock sits a woman, alone. Very probably this is Hekate. It is tempting to compare her with a similar figure at the right side 27 Kraus, io6.

Petersen had earlier called her Artemis Brauronia and emphasised the significance of the whole scene for the topography of the Acropolis.36 Comparison with the probable Hekate in Utrecht suggests that Hekate herself came to be connected, however remotely, with the chorus of Nymphs not far from her Hekataion.37 The painter of a small red-figured lekythos in the National Museum makes a subtle allusion to the fact that Hekate lives below ground. A young woman is sacrificing and has fixed three torches in the ground. She bends down, holding a basket in her left hand, a small animal in her right. The scene had previously been connected with the Athenian festival of the Skira, 38until Rumpf's keen eye noticed that the small animal was not a piglet but a puppy. So the sacrifice is to Hekate, identified in Athens with Aphrodite Genetyllis.39 We are indebted to the Beldam Painter's preference for the unusual and the terrifying for giving us this unique figure: Hekate as she was known in Athens before Alkamenes. It is the only one of this painter's unusual subjects that it has been possible to interpret clearly, since there is no agreed interpretation of the name-vase with the 'beldam' nor of the lekythos 34 Antike Plastik iv 35, note 58. Old drawing: Herbig, Pan pl. 22, 3 and p. 58. 35 Furtwaingler-Wolters, Fiihrer no. 456; Eckstein, loc. cit. 35, note 58, agrees. 36 JdI xxiii (I908) 25. 37 The painter of the vase could have taken his inspiration from figures like that on the bell-krater in Thessaloniki with a representation of the Nemean Lion ('ErztPfltov Taorvra 380 f., pls. 3-4); Rhomaios prefers to call her a local nymph (ibid. 382-3). The seated female figure on the Utrecht krater has no connexion (except as an iconographic type) with the figure on the Thessaloniki krater (ARV2 0I53, 43 Group of Polygnotos: undetermined). The short- sleeved chiton of 'Hekate' on the Munich relief is not unconnected with the chthonic nature of the figure shown. By the second century B.C. the Sarapis type by Bryaxis-dressed in a sort of sleeved chiton-was widespread throughout the Hellenistic world. In answer to Lippold's objections (Festschrift Paul Arndt S116 f.) that Bryaxis did not find this dress in older representations of Hades, no-one would deny that in the fifth century the Hades-Plouton type closely matched representations of Zeus, but the known monuments with Hades are few, and it is not im- possible that representations like that of Sarapis existed. See particularly Thiemann, Vatergotheiten 27 f., 47 f. and 138. Thanatos on a plastic vase in the National Museum wears a sleeved chiton (see note 13, where it is dated just after 400 B.c.). See also Hades on the Nekyia krater in New York (ARV2 IO86) and on the volute-krater in Karlsruhe: AK xiv (1971) 53, note 62 (R.

(Wace, Catalogue no. 6oo), which has recently been resurrec- ted after long neglect and well reproduced by H. Walter (Gr. Gdtter 133, fig. I37), there is such damage to its appearance that any deductions from it are useless.

We would exceed the limits of this study if we attempted a comparison between the Hekataion kalathos and the kalathos- modius of Sarapis. This head-gear, connected as it is with the chthonic gods (V. MUiller, Polos 79 f.), could have been borrowed by artists from Anatolian monuments. A lengthy account of Bryaxis' work was given by Picard, particularly in Mon iv 2a, 867 f. Cf.

Haspels who has analysed his work with such freshness. We can recognise his hand in the rough, free drawing, and particularly on the smaller vases, in the distorted treatment of figures with their long limbs almost disjointed." Some paintings have been attributed to his imitators, but we believe that this lekythos drawing could not have been painted by any other hand, that his mind, and only his, could have conceived it. This choice of picture (not an original invention of his, as we shall see) was suggested to the painter by the funerary purpose of the little vase. He started his career by painting small lekythoi which had no funerary content42 but later began to decorate some lekythoi with simple burial scenes, not the sort of pictures with delicate allusions to the dead which the Athena Painter had produced a little earlier.43 From the free treatment of the folds, particularly on the lower part of the chiton, the Hekate painting dates to c. 470 B.c. It is directly followed by a lekythos in the National Museum with a funerary theme.44 In this later phase, our painter was inspired by monu- mental painting, as Haspels noticed in connection with a lekythos with Amazons in the National Museum. An old drawing of this picture (FIG. I) serves to confirm its dependence -i -: i-ii-i:i:i-:i i- - ::-i:i:ii-i Hii-"iii-i:i-i:iii:':-: ::c?:ii::i:--ili i:-:i-i::--- -_- -:- ..-:::. _:i-:: : :- :-'---:-'i:siiiiiijiii-i :. .. -i ii-''''"'"'''''''':'-:::::: -::-:-" ::'::::::" :::-:::" :'::::: :::j:?:_u:i::::-::j:?:~-- j?--:::::::::: ::::-:::::::-.::::::7 : :::::: . ...' .'..:' . ..'..."" ..:.;.:. ii::i-ii~ii::i~iii:-ii :. ii:iiiiii:i . : :----i-:::::i:-::- -':'''"'--:'''::''~::~:'i'i'i'i i'i~~iii-iiiiiii~i:i:~:$iiilii : : :: : ..:::::::_ :::::::::: :.:_:.: ::::::::.::::::: : ........ :. .-..?

Sir John Beazley devoted a number of pages (199-294) of Paralipomena to the groups of small black-figured lekythoi. Of interest also are the two published by E. Haspels and L. Kahil in Melanges Michalowski 437 f., 48I f. (= Paralip. 294, Beldam Class). For small lekythia on the steps of stelai, see F. Felten, Thanatos und Kleophonmaler pl.

For the Beldam</page><page sequence="9">72 SEMNI KAROUZOU on the Amazonomachy of the Stoa Poikile.45 Four Amazons are shown preparing for battle. Their bodies have been drawn in outline, and applied white has been used for the naked parts-the beginning of polychromy. Of the two standing Amazons, the left-hand one in particular suggests by her stance some knowledge on the painter's part of early rhythmic 'contrapposto'. The white coating on the body of the lekythos itself, as on the other in the National Museum with the funerary scene, fits in with the artist's progressive development, his introduction of new themes and the influence on his work of large-scale painting.46 We should place these vases between 460 and 450 B.c. It is likely, however, that for the earlier, pure black-figure Hekate lekythos a famous mural painting or something similar was also used as a prototype, a picture which expressed popular belief in the effectiveness of Hekate in the underworld in punishing the impious. We cannot today deduce which sanctuary housed the painting. But if we let our imagina- tion run free, it would lead us to the underground sanctuary below the Nike temple-though there has been insufficient investigation there.47 Must there not also have been, from primitive times, an underground enclosure in the Kerameikos, perhaps on the site fixed by a base and a later relief of the second or third century A.D. ?48 Also, the sanctuary of Kallisto who was Hekate and Artemis combined, is fixed in the Kerameikos from offerings made there.49 But all this is slight evidence to back up a slender hypothesis, though this picture of the underworld is well designed for the decoration of an underground sanctuary of Hekate. What is more certain is that Alkamenes' triple Hekate in human shape not surprisingly had no deep psychological influence. It gave birth to works of art, the sculptors of Hekataia, particularly from the fourth century onwards, depended for their inspiration on this model, but the influence went no further. We know from Sophocles' Rizotomoi and from passages of Aristophanes that the Athenians of the fifth century knew the terrifying side of Hekate.50 Following the decay of classical feeling, the demonic and chthonic character of Hekate began to revive and grow and to master the minds of men. In this aspect Hekate with her connexion with magic lasted until Neoplatonist times.51 In the Hellenistic period she was as the older Athenians had imagined her and as we see her in the lekythos picture: 7r XOova 6"CEKC'7r rav Ka L OrKCAKE 7Tpo[Eov'~70 EPXOt[EVa VEKvwV ava-Tr7pla Ka cLv ( (Theoc., Id. ii 12-13) On moonless nights she was carried on her dogs round the graves in the Kerameikos, attended by the band of aiwpot, the young who had left the world before their time; the howls heard in those parts were thought to be the barkings of her dogs.52 Painter, see also AE I942, 44, 63 f.

As a result of the art-historical studies that have been made, it seems certain that the group of three maidens, hands touching in a joyful dance-some with the goddess' polos on their heads-was added to Hekataia only in the early Hellenistic period. Older archaeolo- gists were unsure what name to give them.53 Kraus, in his detailed review of the problem, did not fail to note the proximity of the Epipyrgidia to the Charites, who were also guardians of the Propylaea, and yet he decided not to apply that name to the dancers on the Hekataia, while Schwarzenberg should have paused to consider the matter but instead passed it by hastily.54 Miriam Ervin devoted more time to the identity of the group. Starting from the sound proposition that these figures should be recognised among those worshipped on the Acropolis, she reviewed the rich sources for the subject and came to the conclusion that the figures dancing round the Hekataia were the Nymphs Aglaurides.65 Hauser in his famous study of Neoattic reliefs had proposed this name for a type of dancers, and Fuchs has now accepted it for a group of such reliefs with dancers.56 Whatever may have been the name of the lovely dancers, we may note that the female figures who accompany Hekate in the underworld are three in number. So, one cannot escape the thought that some artist of the Hellenistic period decided to connect these figures, which were known from older representations, with the form of Hekataion, but thereby changed their shape, their meaning and their function. Instead of avenging Furies, he devised the lovely Graces, Seasons or Aglaurides who danced round in a spring dance. The 'Av-rata of the crossroads became a messenger of Spring, and a Hellenistic idyll was united with a classical creation. But at the same time there was a parallel development: fear of the other, chthonic power of the 'EvoSla grew strong and completely overshadowed the minds of simple people. SEMNI KAROUZOU.
