Photon and Neutron Dose Contributions and Mean Quality Factors in Phantoms of Differ- ent Size Irradiated by Monoenergetic Neutrons. Radiat. Res. 140, 130-133 (1994). The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) in its Publication 60 introduced important changes in the concept of risk-related quantities. For external neutron radiation in particular the introduction of the equivalent dose with the radiation weighting factor WR instead of the dose equivalent con- cept with the quality factor Q(L) has many consequences. The value of WR is defined by the external neutron radiation field, while the radiation quality in the phantom depends on the radia- tion field at the position of interest and hence on the size of and the position in the phantom. It has been investigated to what extent the size of the phantom influences the mean radiation quality in the phantoms. For incident monoenergetic neutrons, mean photon dose contributions and mean quality factors have been calculated. Results are presented for various phantoms which characterize the conditions for a mouse, a rat, the ICRU sphere and a human body. INTRODUCTION The International Commission on Radiological Protec- tion (ICRP) in its Publication 60 (1) recommended impor- tant changes in the concept of risk-related radiation protec- tion quantities by introducing a radiation weighting factor, WR, for the determination of equivalent doses in human bodies. The new quantity organ equivalent dose, HT = WRDT,R, (1) R has been defined, where DT is the mean absorbed dose in a specified organ or tissue T due to radiation R. For external radiation the radiation weighting factor WR depends on the type and energy of the radiation incident on the body. Its value is equal to 1 for photon radiation and depends on the particle energy for neutron radiation ranging from 5 to 20, the maximum value being between 100 keV and 2.0 MeV. The quantity effective dose, E, has been defined by the weighted sum of the equivalent doses of different organs and tissues of the body, E= w WHT. (2) Regarding the operational radiation protection quantities ambient dose equivalent, directional dose equivalent and personal dose equivalent as proposed by the ICRU (2), the ICRP recommends the further use of the quality factor con- cept for the definition of dose equivalent. They, however, proposed a revised Q(L) function, where L is as before the linear energy transfer of a charged particle in water (1, 3). For external neutron radiation the most important dif- ference in the concepts of dose equivalent and equivalent dose is that the dose equivalent at a specified point in a phantom is determined by the absorbed dose at this point multiplied by the effective quality factor obtained from the radiation field at this point, while the equivalent organ dose is determined by the mean organ absorbed dose multiplied by WR, the value of which is determined by the external neutron field. The values of WR for neutrons have been cho- sen to reflect the relative radiobiological effectiveness (RBE) of neutrons compared to photons. The following considerations deal with the fact that the radiation field in a body can be considerably different from the external neu- tron field and discuss the consequences. Monoenergetic neutrons entering and reacting within a body or phantom will be degraded in energy by multiple scattering or nuclear reactions until they exit the body or are thermalized or have been absorbed. Secondary photons are produced predominantly by the 1H(n,y)2H reaction, but other nuclear reactions also contribute. Under these condi- 0033-7587/94 $5.00 130 ?1994 by Radiation Research Society.

According- ly, the absorbed dose results from neutron and photon interactions near this point, and the radiation quality of the mixed field depends on the neutron and photon dose con- tributions. These, however, depend on the size and shape of and the position in the phantom. Many radiobiological experiments for studying the RBE of neutron radiation were performed by irradiating either small cell systems or mice or rats (4). It is therefore an interesting question to what extent the different body sizes of a mouse, a rat or a human influence the mean radiation quality in those bodies. In this paper calculations will be described and results will be presented for various phantoms which show the dif- ferences in the radiation quality for a mouse, a rat, the ICRU sphere and a human body irradiated by neutrons. PHANTOMS AND CALCULATION To simplify the calculations small spheres of ICRU tissue were select- ed to simulate the small animals. The weight of the smallest sphere was 25 g, equal to the weight of a cylindrical soft-tissue mouse phantom as given in ICRU 48 (5). Various rat phantoms were also reported there, varying in mass from 180 to 442 g. Here, a value of 250 g has been select- ed as a representative value to simulate a rat. It is suggested that calcula- tions with a sphere will give an upper limit with respect to the photon dose contribution in a mouse or rat, because the rate of thermalized neu- trons and the probability of secondary photons reacting within the phan- tom is higher in the sphere than in more realistic animal phantoms with the same mass but a smaller diameter and a greater length. A summary of the data from the phantoms used is given in Table I. In addition to these phantoms, data are presented for the ICRU sphere (2) used for the definition of the quantity ambient dose equivalent, H* (10), and for an anthropomorphic ADAM phantom. The data for the ICRU sphere have been taken from Schuhmacher and Siebert (6), and the data for the ADAM phantom were taken from Hollnagel (7). The calculations for the spherical phantoms were performed with MCNP, a general Monte Carlo code for neutron and photon transport (8). A broad parallel monoenergetic neutron beam of energy En incident on the phantom was taken and calculations were performed for neutron energies from thermal to 5 MeV for the "mouse" and "rat" sphere phan- toms, while data up to 20 MeV are available for the other phantoms. As a result of collisions the neutrons are moderated upon entering the phan- tom, and secondary photons are produced mainly by the 1H(n,y)2H reac- tion. The MCNP code simulates the neutron and photon transport and allows the photon absorbed dose, DN, and the spectral neutron fluence, DE(E) = dD(E)/dE (E is the neutron energy at the mass element of interest within the phantom) to be computed. All results are normalized to an incident neutron fluence of 1 cm-2. The spectral fluence is then used to determine the neutron absorbed dose, Dn, and the neutron dose equivalent, Ha, which are termed the heavy-ion doses because the contri- bution of secondary photons is excluded. It is Dn = f E(E)kf(E)dE (3) and Hn= f E(E)[Qn(E)kf(E)]dE, (4) where kf is the kerma factor and Qn the quality factor for neutrons which pertains to the first-collision heavy-ion dose. Qn characterizes the quality factor for neutrons incident on a very small piece of tissue, but with the additional condition of secondary charged-particle equilibrium in this mass element. The data for kf and Qn are taken from Schuhmacher and Siebert (6). A detailed discussion of the physics in phantoms and the influence of the induced photon dose on radiation quality for neutrons is given elsewhere (9). The quality factor Q of the mixed neutron-photon field is then obtained by the quotient of H and D: 1H H,+Hn Q- DD, + D (5) D D'+ Dn where HY is the induced photon dose, D., multiplied by a quality factor of 1. The calculations for the anthropomorphic phantom ADAM were performed by Hollnagel (7) using his own transport code with kerma factors and quality factors for neutrons taken from Schuhmacher and Siebert (6). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The radiation quality of a mixed neutron-photon field obviously depends on the relative photon and neutron dose contributions. Figure 1 shows the relative absorbed dose contribution of the secondary photons for the various phan- toms. For the mouse and the rat sphere phantoms values averaged over the sphere volume are presented, while for the ICRU sphere the values at a depth of 10 mm on the radius opposite to the direction of radiation incidence are given, which corresponds to the definition of H* (10).

This averaging takes into account the different radiation sensitivity of organs with respect to cancer induc- tion and hereditary damage as defined by the ICRP. At incident neutron energies below about 0.5 keV, for all phantoms the photon dose contributions are nearly inde- pendent of the neutron energy. At these energies the range of neutrons before thermalization takes place is small and in the first order the photon dose is therefore a function of the volume and size of the phantom only. For energies above about 1 MeV the photon dose contribution is very low for all phantoms considered because the volumes are too small for significant thermalization and production of y rays. A remarkable difference is to be seen for neutron energies between about 0.5 keV and 1 MeV. The decrease in the photon dose contribution is obviously shifted to high- er energies with increasing phantom volume. Using Eq. (5), mean quality factors Q have been calcu- lated for the phantoms as a function of incident neutron energy En (see Fig. 2). For the ADAM phantom Q is calcu- lated by Q = WTQTDTwith QT H ,T +HnT (7) - TDDH-y,T + Dn,T The influence of the induced secondary photon dose on the effective quality factor is always quite strong in the region of thermal and epithermal neutrons. For thermal neutrons, the quality factor Qn, based mainly on protons from the reaction 14N(n,p)14C, has a value of 19.2 (6).

If realistic mouse and rat phantoms instead of spheres would have been applied, Q should be even larger at low and intermediate neutron energies. For neutron energies above about 10 keV the photon contribution is small in the mouse and rat phantom and thus the mean Q values are nearly equal. They differ from Qn by less than 10%, which stems from the degradation of the neutrons in the phantoms. For the ICRU sphere and the ADAM phantom, the Q values are significantly lower than these values for neutron energies of less than about 1 MeV. For higher energies the photon dose contribution is small in all phantoms considered, and there are no strong differences in Q values to be seen. The results obviously show that for incident neutron radiation the mean effective quality factor depends not only on the neutron energy but also strongly on the volume of the phantom. This is not a really surprising result, but it means that if the radiation quality of an external radiation is specified, for example, by defining radiation weighting factors, care must be taken when values obtained from investigations of the radiobiological effectiveness (RBE val- ues) in mice or rats are transferred to the irradiation condi- tions of human bodies. Many radiobiological studies on which the selection of the new WR values for external neu- tron radiation are based have apparently been performed by irradiating animals with fission neutrons with a large amount of epithermal and thermal neutrons (4).
