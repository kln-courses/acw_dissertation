<plain_text><page sequence="1">TWO BRITISH CHRONICLES I The Complete Poems of W. H. Davies, with an introd. by Osbert Sitwell and a foreword by Daniel George. Wesleyan University Press. $7.50. Lodgers, by Tony Connor. Oxford University Press. $4.25. The Snow Leopard, by Paul West. Harcourt, Brace, and World. $2.95. This new, and apparently definitive, edition of the poetry of W. H. Davies (appearing, as Daniel George notes in his Foreword, simultane ously with a critical biography of him by Richard Stonesifer, an Ameri can scholar) supersedes the I943 Collected Poems, which was selected by Davies himself before his death in I940 but still unaccountably omitted a considerable number of good pieces. The latter have been restored here, making the present volume a very substantial one of seven hundred and forty-nine poems. In addition, the introductory essay by Osbert Sitwell provides an informative and affectionate biographical sketch of Davies, though the reader will look in vain for any detailed comment on the poems themselves. Yet Davies' poetry requires no critical prefaces or explanations. As a body of writing it stands completely outside the modernist or post Symbolist movement in poetry; its closest kinship is to the work of the 406</page><page sequence="2">RALPH J. MILLS, JR. Georgians. The virtues of Davies' poems are those of the author himself unaffected simplicity, directness, intuitiveness, coupled with a genuine and marvelous lyric gift. While he has been compared to Herrick and Blake-and, of course, the resemblances are sometimes there-he is really untutored, a wholly natural poet; his responses to experience seem to take the form of brief lyric poems, as if these composed his ordinary, accustomed mode of utterance. Here are two stanzas from Nature's Friend: Say what you like, All things love me! I pick no flowers That wins the Bee. The Summer's Moths Think my hand one To touch their wings With Wind and Sun. Much of Davies' experience derives, as it does above, from nature or rural life; and at times, as we would obviously expect in a poet of so spontaneous a sort, the results deaden into convention, the responses be come too mechanical. That is the cost, but it is certainly worth it for all the fine poems we get. And it ought to be emphasized at once that Davies is not merely a barely self-educated poet nhively singing the joys of field and forest in total ignorance of the world's ways. His prose works chronicle his travels as a "super-tramp" in America and Canada (where he lost a leg jumping from a train); after his return to England he lived (until his books sold and he received a civil-list pension and married) on a tiny inheritance from his grandmother in London doss-houses, printing and selling his own verses. A number of his poems deal, often fiercely, with the conditions of poverty and anguish he witnessed in that period: Those poor, heartbroken wretches, doomed To hear at night the clocks' hard tones; They have no beds to warm their limbs, But with those limbs must warm cold stones; Those poor weak men, whose coughs and ailings Force them to tear at iron railings. (The Helpless) 407</page><page sequence="3">POETRY * * * * Why do I stare at faces, why, Nor watch the happy children more? Since Age has now a blackened eye, And that grey hair is stained with gore. For an old woman passed, and she Would hide her face when I did stare, But when she turns that face from me, There's clotted blood in her grey hair. Aye, here was hell last night to play, The scream of children, murder cries; When I came forth at early day, I saw old Age with blackened eyes. (Saturday Night in the Slums) What is perhaps most amazing about Davies is that in spite of a pro found personal acquaintance with human suffering, dereliction, evil, and abandonment, his own nature never hardened but remained sensitive and uncorrupted. He was a poet of real talent whose work should long re main with us, giving pleasure. It is a considerable jump in time and sensibility to the work of two younger British writers. Tony Connor's Lodgers is his second book, and one that everywhere impresses the reader with the made poem, the careful labor of craft in the service of vision. The focus of that vision falls both on the poet's own life, on his father and mother (their relation to one another, his relation to them), on his wife, and on the quality of English life today. This feeling of contemporary England pervades the book (as it does Philip Larkin's books) like the ineradicable dampness, soot, and odors of a London winter. I suppose one could point to a certain cor respondence between these poems of Mr. Connor's-especially the per sonal and family pieces-and the autobiographical strain so prominent in the writing of American poets such as Robert Lowell and Anne Sexton. Yet Tony Connor decidedly has his own voice, and it is very forceful and very English too. It is also more closely bound to the actualities of existence, the realistic, unpleasant, inescapable facts of daily life, than the 408</page><page sequence="4">RALPH J. MILLS, JR. work of Americans, who tend toward looseness, the free play or ex travagance of imagination. One passage will have to serve here as an example of this poet's strong, accomplished manner; but in any case Mr. Connor's book is a very good one. The following lines are from the opening of A Death by the Seaside in which the poet imagines his own death and explores that of his father: Too clearly for my comfort, I am able to picture a likely ending for myself; not slain by Gods, or torn apart by rabble, or making a last insanely proud and wilful stand against storm or sea, but rather, a quiet lodger-the only guest-in a boarding house where stairs are being moved, walls knocked out, and the downstairs parlour changed to a cocktail lounge ready for next season. A man of sixty, or thereabouts, who writes no letters. At night, a man who sits alone, staring fixedly at each successive programme on the bright screen amidst the contractor's half-completed contemporary fittings. Type of Timon but not disgusted enough to be great-, I see myself, a soured old man-a 'rum 'un' to landlady and cleaners; one whose ways, and presence by the shore in dead of winter are cause for speculation 'though he pays on the dot each Friday'. One who has no banter, and little luggage, who walks the gusty prom sick of the past, impatient for death to come. Paul West has already made himself well-known through a sizeable amount of energetic and imaginative literary criticism. He has, however, to my mind little ability as a poet. With the exception of War Cemetery, Monte Cassino, I found nothing but the most willful, invented kind of verse in this book. Since the volume is clearly one printed and bound in England, then distributed in this country by a large publisher, one might question the taste, the justice even, of importing such a poor collection when the work of some of the very finest contemporary British poets 409</page><page sequence="5">POETRY (R. S. Thomas, Thomas Blackburn, Elizabeth Jennings, for example) only occasionally is handled here by a major publishing firm. I say this not to oppose the appearance of Mr. West's book in America, but because adequate representation of the best British poets is obviously neglected here. RALPH J. MILLS, JR.

Chatto and Windus / The Hogarth Press. I2S 6d. Collected Poems, 1930 to 1965, by George Barker. October House (New York). $7.50. Michael Parr's first volume contains eighty-one poems, of which I would return to thirteen. The others seem to me well-rhymed, and super ficially ecstatic, ending in no special manner at no special point. Nature is wholly stories, eliciting from the poet little more than sentiment: ". . . O it is sweet to live / proclaiming words that would reveal my love"; "The worst with us is that we die." The gusto of these pieces depends on haphazard imagery and tortured diction. The lyrical posture wants, vainly, justification in the works of Dylan Thomas. Mr. Parr's better poems generally concern people and events. A little bit of protest, a wee bit of lechery, show in these pieces, and improve them: I care about the speaker, which concern seems to me important. Two of his best poems are Look, Lord, which celebrates the miraculous, and The Cement City, which defines the workaday metropolis; neither piece is representative. And the lines I like best, to a Rook, are atypically casual: Ah well, it's winter, things must live: here's rind, here's bread, here's fat, here's food. Live, black voice, not without my love 4IO</page><page sequence="6">MARVIN BELL Writing in I962 about his selection for Poet's Choice, the anthology edited by Paul Engle and Joseph Langland, Michael Hamburger re nounced the "impersonality", the "labored" manner, and the "symbolic distillation" in his previous poems, and promised to write a more spon taneous, idiomatic, "free mixture of immediate and imagined experi ence". In Flashlight contains eleven somewhat spontaneous, somewhat idiomatic poems: responses, often nostalgic, usually slight, to nature and to traces of people. I feel, in his "approachable" posture, in the appearance of effortlessness in his language, and in his careful enjambments, the presence of the speaker in these pieces, and like them for that. My favor ites in this pamphlet are The Jackdaws ("Gone, I thought, had not heard them for years"), For a Family Album ("Tied to my rooted bones / In your chairs you were flying, flying."), Oxford ("Years on the Gothic rack"), Brixton ("Why the black looks, neighbour: / But for us your white would be greyer"), and For No One: And now you chattered gaily about yourself, About living from hand to mouth, luxuriously. Because you were Beatrice, nothing had changed between us; Because nothing had changed between us, I knew your name. Of the thirty-four poems in Nature with Man-his fourth collection Jon Silkin apparently wishes us to pay particular attention to fifteen on flowers-having published and broadcast groups of them previously, and now surrounding them with pieces closely related in content and a relevant three-page essay. According to the title poem, .... . The whole / Of nature is turning slowly / Into an eye that searches / For its most developed / And treach erous creature, man." Mr. Silkin's attempt to define the real situation of "nature with man," both in the flower poems and in their fellows, is heavy with aphorism ("The whole of nature / Is a preying upon"; "What can't be stopped must be nourished"; "It is not natural to / Grow by separation."), anthropomorphism (peonies are "confident"; daisies, "candid" and "glad"; violets, "courageous"), and insistence ("Take care of Nature... ."; "[God] is our carnivore / And we, His feeling plants. / And that's the complex part."). The poems labor to deliver their mes sages. 4II</page><page sequence="7">POETRY (I take the presence of the essay as an indication of the book's technical and perceptual mediocrity. Here, the poet tells his theories, intentions and methods in the flower poems, and a bit of his political philosophy. Having read the poems first, I was not convinced by the essay. Returning to the poems, I felt the essay had said everything, and more interestingly.) Jon Silkin has already written well, and importantly. (See his selec tions in the second New Poets of England and America, for starters.) These flower poems, on which he has placed such emphasis, seem to me neither artful nor educational-not half-successful. Of the (better) poems which lead up to them, I like two particularly: Defence and Community. No More Crying Out, one of five translations from the Italian of Ungaretti, is, for me, the one artful polemic in the book: Cease murdering the dead. They have a barely heard whispering, No more than the increase of grass, Happy where no man passes. George Barker's new Collected Poems contains all of his Collected Poems, 1930-1955 (Faber and Faber, I957), all of The Viewfrom a Blind I (Faber and Faber, I962), and nine new and old additional pieces. It does not collect many of his published poems, including-its most serious omis sion-The True Confession of George Barker, available in a New American Library edition of I964. It was The True Confession ... , begun in I947, which signified a severely deliberate shifting by the poet from obtuse eloquence-itself a development from Mr. Barker's early acrobatic diction-to idiomatic clarity, from self--torment to self-analysis, from the elegiac tone to the conversational, slightly from the visionary to the analytic. Common to Mr. Barker's early poems, the Confession, and The View from a Blind I is the conception that death is our one expectation, in a kaleidoscopic life which the poet serves by praising. In the Confession and The View . . . , however, the poet expresses less belief in a discernible divinity and more in impenetrable human ignorance. His own trial as sertions of faith do not convince him, and he carries on unpopular, some times scatological, dissections with wit and aplomb. Love is his favorite cadaver. 4I2</page><page sequence="8">MARVIN BELL The Viewfrom a Blind I provides, I feel, the best pieces in the Collected Poems. They are various in technique and substance, and are not so dogged, nor so self-centered, as the Confession. And they end in more than howling. Mr. Barker should be complimented, just as he compli ments Allen Ginsberg in Nine Beatitudes to Denver, for refusing to edit the hysteria out of his own vision of reality. Quite differently, he should be complimented for affirming, as he does in the title poem in The View from a Blind 1, the subjectivity of that vision. The spirit of man, he con cludes, in what seems to me an honorable equivocation, is "defiled yet viable". The new poems contain a little mocking and a lot of accomplished memorializing. They are merely additional pieces, I think, to an already well-defined development toward idiomatic expression and an earth bound sense of self. The Confession, I believe, was responsible.
