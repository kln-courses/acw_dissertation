<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE USE OF REASON IN MAIMONIDES AN EVALUATION BY AHAD HA-AM Alfred Gottschalk Los Angeles The mediaeval Jewish philosopher, Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon (Mai monides) was held in special regard by Ahad Ha-Am, who considered him his guide and teacher.1 Among the Sadagora hasidim with whom Ahad Ha-Am was reared, studying Maimonides was anathema, and yet it was to Maimonides that the rebellious young Ahad Ha-Am was drawn and whose thought epitomized for him shilton ha-sekel, "the supremacy of reason/'2 It was the exposure to Maimonides that finally led him from the stage of being a mitnagged to a maskil.3 Ahad Ha-Am paid supreme tribute to Maimonides for having brought him out of the deep religiosity in which he had been steeped from his youth onward.4 The Moreh awakened in Ahad Ha-Am, it appears, the great inquisitive spirit which was a natural gift of his, and which gave him renown in the intellectual milieu of his time. Throughout his life Ahad Ha-Am venerated Mai monides, for he saw in him the creator of the doctrine of the "supremacy of reason" developed to its most radical formulation.5 To attempt to 1.

In a letter to Simon Dubnow of Vilna (January 13, 1905), Ahad Ha-Am speaks of Maimonides as "the one to whom I am indebted for leading me out of the forty-nine gates of 'holiness' in which I was immersed in the beginning of my youth."

It is because of his feeling of indebtedness to Maimonides that Ahad Ha-Am in</page><page sequence="2">8 ALFRED GOTTSCHALK render religion meaningful through reason, however, as far as Ahad Ha Am was concerned, was a fruitless effort. Ahad Ha-Am confesses that he never found any satisfaction in religious philosophy built upon metaphys ical principles. Religion for Ahad Ha-Am was not a question of belief but of the heart,6 and therefore it seems anomalous that it was Maimon ides, the supreme exponent of reason, who led Ahad Ha-Am out of his hasidic piety and awakened his mind to the fruits of speculative thought. If religion is a matter of feeling,7 then that feeling would hardly have been changed by Maimonides' rational methods, or for that matter anyone's rational methods. One can see in a real sense how Ahad Ha-Am, whose mind was always alive to new ideas, would have taken to Maimonides with such avidity. For in Maimonides one can find all the subtleties of philosophic thought as he wrestles with the obvious anthropomorphic and anthropopathic passages of the Bible, as well as his controversial discussions on whether the universe was created ex nihilo by a creator-God or has existed from eternity. Related to Yehudah Halevi's arguments in The Kuzari, Mai monides appears to be providing the intellectual case to make it possible for Jews to entertain the notion of the eternity of matter and the universe. After amassing the evidence, particularly from Aristotle's philosophy, which leads to the conclusion of a non-created universe, Maimonides brings his reasoning to an abrupt halt and casts doubt upon the evidence which he has so brilliantly arraigned. He suddenly embraces the position that one cannot conclusively prove Aristotle's contention,8 and mature years felt obliged to write a major exposition on Maimonides' contribution to Jewish thought.

For Aristotle and the Peripatetics after him have come forward with a demonstration for every one of them.

The twenty-sixth premise, "that Aristotle constantly</page><page sequence="3">MAIMONIDES EVALUATED BY AHAD HA-AM 9 since Jews have a tradition of creation, the latter is to be accepted as binding upon the believer.9 For Ahad Ha-Am and other readers of The Guide, even more important than the particular conclusion at which Maimonides arrives are the arguments which he expresses in readily understandable modes of Jewish philosophical expression. Although Maimonides, conclusion is a tradi tional one, his method for arriving at that conclusion must be studied on its own terms. It is possible to see how, if one understands Maimonides correctly, massive doubt about traditional Jewish beliefs and dogmas could be generated, notwithstanding the fact that Maimonides posits the thirteen dogmatic principles of Judaism which are a credo of faith. Ahad Ha-Am was fully cognizant of the fact that Maimonides was introducing a new dimension to Jewish religious thought not indigenous to it. This may be gleaned from his reference to Maimonides when he states: "The people has not opposed those of its sages that have filled its cask with new wine from foreign vintages such as the Rambam and his school, neither have they withheld reverence nor honour from them."10 The seventh centenary of the death of Maimonides (datable to Decern ber, 1204) occasioned essays of tribute in his memory from major Jewish thinkers throughout the world. Ahad Ha-Am took this occasion to repay a long-felt debt to one whom he considered his guide and who, more than any other Jewish thinker, had led to his intellectual emancipation. The tribute to Maimonides was originally an address delivered in Russian to the Jewish Club of Odessa. Ahad Ha-Am developed the nucleus of this address into the Hebrew essay which appeared in Hashiloah under the title, "The Supremacy of Reason."11 The article reappeared in this fourth wishes to establish as true," is opposed by every Mutakallim and affirmed as "necessary" by every commentator of Aristotle. Maimonides maintained that this premise in Aristotle's opinion was "the most fitting and probable." As to its "necessity," Maimon ides says, "To me it seems that the premise in question is possible — that is, neither necessary ... nor impossible." Ibid., p. 240-241. 9. Ibid., p. 329-333. Maimonides does not leave at rest the traditional Jewish concept of creation. He sets forth his own, "by means of arguments that come close to being a demonstration, that what exists indicates to us of necessity that it exists in the virtue of the purpose of One who purposed." Ibid., p. 303. Maimonides does not presume to call his premise "a demonstration." Since it is counterbalanced by Aristotle's premise, it is the tradition which ultimately tips the scales in favor of creation. Cf. Z. Diesendruck, "The Philosophy of Maimonides."

The noted British scholar, Dr. Israel Friedlaender, responded, joining issue with some of Ahad Ha-Am's comments on Maimonides but dealing with Ahad Ha-Am's treatment of the subject as one expert to another.12 "The Supremacy of Reason," a thorough if not completely balanced presentation of Maimonides' thought, contains a portion that is germane to our discussion. Ahad Ha-Am begins the essay by noting the different climate in the intellectual world of his day than that which had existed previously. In the past, it would have been impossible for an educated Jew to have a single day go by without calling Maimonides to mind. Whichever way such a person would have turned, whether to religious and philosophical speculation, or to legal studies, or problems relating to ethics, he would have had to confront Maimonides and recognize the great authority, the high place of honour and deep respect in which he was held, even by those who differed with him. Even the non-scholar met him daily when he sealed his morning prayers with the ani ma'amin, the thirteen principles of faith. How was it possible to forget the man who established the "principles" of Israel's faith? Today, however, if a Jew from those times were to rise from his grave and we wanted to show how far removed from our forefathers we were, it would be sufficient to tell him that now it is possible for a man to read Hebrew works extensive ly without encountering a reference to Maimonides. This is not because we have satisfactory answers to all the spiritual questions that vexed our fathers and therefore no longer have need to turn to the ancient philo sophy of Maimonides. It is rather because the questions themselves have been blotted out from our daily agenda and thoughts. Spiritual matters seem to be pushed aside by modern civilized men, and earthly concerns seem to hold sway. It is as if we are ashamed of spirituality in a way that Aristotle believed the sense of touch to be something of which we ought to be ashamed.13 In Ahad Ha-Am's estimation, Maimonides cannot be regarded as the 12.

He was persuaded that Maimonides borrow ed extensively from the philosophy of Aristotle, as it was available to him. The basic guidelines were of Aristotelian thought with an admixture of neo-Platonic doctrine, again as this had been absorbed and transmitted by the Arab philosophers.14 What was unique in Maimonides was that he brought the ethical consequences of the assumptions borrowed from the Greeks and Arabs to their logical conclusions. Further, he developed them into something new, which had previously not been stated, though they were implied in the fundamental principles from which he deduced these consequences. Ahad Ha-Am gives us a clue to his own methodological reconstruc tion of Maimonides' thought by stating that the various sources which he is setting in logical sequential order are scattered throughout Maimon ides' work. Thus, Ahad Ha-Am uses portions of the Mishneh Torah (Foundations of the Law), Chapters i-iv, and all parts of The Guide.15 Ahad Ha-Am's thesis is that Maimonides subsumed all of the beliefs current in his age under the aspect of reason. In the beginning of Part II of the Moreh, Ahad Ha-Am underscores that Maimonides would not have evaded asserting the principle of the eternity of the universe if he had found conclusive proof to that effect, even if this meant rejecting the contrary teachings of Scripture. One would have expected, then, if Ahad Ha-Am is correct about Maimonides, that he would proffer some reason for believing in the principle of creation other than that it has "the authority of prophecy." It is in this way, however, as Ahad Ha-Am notes, that Maimonides left room for belief in the existence of a revealed religion. Thus, "If the belief in the creation of the world is possible, every difficulty with regard to this question is removed."16 Why God has given of his prophecy to one and not to another, why he gave his Torah to one nation in particular and not to another, and why then, not before or after—these were serious problems. Such trouble some questions can be resolved by resorting to the answer that it was God's will or wisdom which determined these happenings.17 However, 14. Ibid., p. 356. 15.

Divine religion cannot lead to man's supreme goal which, as posited by Maimon ides, is the development of his intellect from the stage of potentiality to that of actuality. This is a goal achievable only by the activity of the intellect through a long process of contemplation and rational thought. Divine religion cannot lead to this goal, not being able to elevate its followers to the level of the "actual" man, but being operative, rather, in his potential state. It must, therefore, be assumed that religion is the interim instrument required to prepare for the sought-after goals.18 Society is the necessary environment for the realization of the actual from the potential state. The aim of religion, then, is to "regulate the soul and the body" of society so that it may produce the largest number of "actual" men possible.19 To accomplish this, it is necessary for religion to be popular, for its teachings and ordinances to be directed not only to the select few who strive for ultimate perfection but to all the people. It must furnish for society both "true opinions" in a form accept able to the understanding of the masses, and true moral teachings, personal and communal, providing for the welfare of society and the well-being of its members. This must be furnished through a code of relig ious observance whose purpose is to educate the people by reminding them constantly of the "true opinions" and their ethical obligations. Through the development of such a society, religion makes it possible for a greater number of men to develop to their "actual" state.20 According to A. H., Maimonides' presuppositions regarding the Torah of Moses are: (1) on its theoretical side it reflects "true opinions"21 in popular form; and (2) from a practical point of view, it is a moral doctrine geared to the individual and society which emanates from the "true opinions" postulated and which, together with them, educates men and society both in right opinions and morality.22 It is because of Mai monides' presuppositions about Torah that the Torah itself presented him with formidable problems of interpretation. The beliefs expounded in the Torah seem to be at opposite poles from the philosophical points of view characteristic of Maimonides' system. He had a clear choice to make. Either the words of the Torah as they are written mean what they say and therefore are binding, subordinating the philosophic principles, 18. Kol Kitve, p. 360. 19. Ibid. 20. Ibid., p. 360 f. 21. "ha-de'ot ha-amitiot." 22. Kol Kitve, p. 360.</page><page sequence="7">MAIMONIDES EVALUATED BY AHAD HA-AM 13 or the Torah is to be subordinated to the philosophic principles as enunciated by Maimonides. Since Maimonides, in Ahad Ha-Am,s view point, was convinced that he had "true opinions," necessity compelled him to subordinate religion absolutely to philosophy; he had to explain the words of the Torah so as to make them compatible with his philosophic principles and have the Torah fulfil a role which philosophical require ments imposed upon it. The method of homonyms reduced anthropo morphisms and anthropopathisms to rational principles and, because of his great skill in finding support for his interpretations from other portions of Scripture and the Talmud, the Rambam succeeded in bending religion to the needs of his philosophy.25 Ahad Ha-Am does not explain Maimonides' method of exegesis in detail, considering it only a "memorial" that stands as a reminder of the weakness of the written word in the face of a living force24 which con verted "yes" to "no" and "no" to "yes." Ahad Ha-Am identifies this living force as a spiritual force which led Maimonides to turn the "living God" of the Torah of Moses into an abstract philosophic idea, empty of all content except the summary of various negations.25 Ahad Ha-Am treats Maimonides' view of divine revelation in a footnote, calling to mind Part II, Chapters xxxii-xxxviii, of The Guide, and Chapter vii of the Mishneh Torah, disposing of these two sources in a sentence or two. The prophet, as far as Maimonides is concerned, is the most perfect ("actual") man who receives divine revelation through the "active intellect," which is charged with the guidance of the world and with bringing from potentiality to actuality all forms, including that of the soul.26 It is Ahad Ha-Am's decided point of view that Maimonides' assertion of the "supremacy of reason" effected a tremendous and fundamental revolution in the history of Jewish thought. Others before Maimonides had tried to make faith compatible with reason but, in the last analysis, rea son was subordinated to the written word. This was the case with Saadia Gaon and Yehuda Halevi. The latter gave pre-eminence to religion, and 23. Ibid., p. 361. Part I of The Guide is by and large devoted to this effort. The Guide is a very complex work, constructed for the double purpose of public teaching and to impart secret lore to the elite few. Of particular interest on the structure of The Guide is Leo Strauss' "Introduction" in Pines, Guide of the Perplexed, pp. xi-lvi. 24. "koah hai ba-nefesh." 25. Kol Kitve, p. 361. 26. Ibid., p. 360, note 3.</page><page sequence="8">14 ALFRED GOTTSCHALK Ahad Ha-Am cites in a footnote a quotation from Halevi which reads: "Whosoever accepts the Torah completely without investigating it with his reason is better off than the one who investigates and researches it."27 Saadia28 and Halevi chose philosophical views which confirmed their religious faith. Not so Maimonides, to whom religious faith was sub ordinate to reason.29 Ahad Ha-Am ascribes to Maimonides, as the motive for postulating the "supremacy of reason,5' his cognition that much in Judaism could stand restructuring. It was not fulfilling its role as a "divine religion" in the way that Maimonides envisaged that role. In Maimonides' comment ary on the Mishnah, he tried to give a clear statement of the "true opinions" of the Torah as well as the practical commandments through which these were to be realized. The commentary clearly concerned itself with the latter aspect, and Maimonides provides the answers from the Gemara whenever the Mishnah leaves a point in doubt.30 In Ahad Ha-Am's opinion, Maimonides' commentary did not make a great impression nor bring about the revolution of popular thought for which he had intended it. Later in life, with greater clarity he composed the Mishneh Torah ("the second law"), in which he set forth both practical laws on religion and morality and all the "true opinions" geared to understanding by the masses. It is a masterpiece of systematic and logical arrangement in which only the decisions are cited, without supporting proofs. This time Maimonides succeeded, in Ahad Ha-Am's opinion, in teaching philosophical truths to the masses in the guise of revealed truth, the latter not requiring demonstration or proof.31 Maimonides next wrote The Guide of the Perplexed. The Guide, Ahad Ha-Am notes, was composed for those chosen few for whom it was necessary to show through reason the philosophic truth that underpinned the religious form. The few were "perplexed," torn between the demands of reason and the doctrine of the divine revelation of the Torah. The Mishneh Torah had filled this need for the masses. The Guide was written 27. Ibid., p. 363; the reference is to the Kuzari, II, chapter xxvi. 28. Kol Kitve, p. 363. 29. It was the role of religion, since it could not directly raise up the "actual" from the "potential" man, to prepare the context which would make this possible. Religion was "to regulate the soul and the body" of society so as to make it yield the largest number of "actual men." Ibid., p. 360. 30. Ibid., p. 365. 31.

Such a person would necessarily always be "in a state of per plexity and anxietyIf he were solely guided by reason, he would have to reject the fundamental beliefs of the Torah. If he chose, however, to abandon reason and adhere to the literal meaning of the Torah, he would still be in a constant state of perplexity, since his abandoning of reason would leave him with only a fundamentalistic approach to the Torah resulting in fear, anxiety, and even greater perplexity.32 Ahad Ha-Am summarizes the teaching of The Guide as the admonition by Maimonides to his readers to follow reason, and reason only, and to interpret religion in conformity with reason. Reason is the purpose of human life. Religion remains only a means to that end.33 Ahad Ha-Am sees a master plan of intellectual enterprise in Maimon ides' life, for he notes that Maimonides took care to establish himself first as the greatest living exponent of Judaism. Had The Guide been published before the Mishneh Torah, he certainly would have been accused of heresy by his opponents, who, in any case, did precisely that after his death.34 Having shown Maimonides' great spirit in emancipating reason from all authority, Ahad Ha-Am adds a postscript in which he, in Maimonidean style, attempts to posit that supremacy of the national sentiment. In an ingenious way, Ahad Ha-Am attempts to supply an escape from the problems that confronted Maimonides. Those elements of Jewish thought and life whose intrinsic value was not readily discerni ble and whose rational bases were in question, were subjugated to reason by Maimonides. These elements, Ahad Ha-Am maintains, could have been rescued had Maimonides paid sufficient attention to national sentiment.35 Maimonides could have discovered thereby that many religious statements, so troublesome to him, had no purpose other than to strengthen the feeling of national unity. He would not have had to state, for example, that the purpose of the Festivals was "their use in the establishment of friendship which is necessary among people living in political societies."36 In dealing with the future redemption, he would not have had to say that "the wise men and the prophets longed for the 32.

In the last part of his study on the Rambam, Ahad Ha-Am openly deals with the question of the intensity of the Rambam's national feeling. Reluctantly, Ahad Ha-Am concluded that in the Rambam national sentiment or feeling was not supreme. Reason was supreme. But the national sentiment was present as sort of an unconscious instinct some times playing havoc with the logic of this thought. By applying the criteria of national sentiment as the basic frame of reference for the appreciation of the Rambam's contribution to Jewish thought, Ahad Ha-Am has explicitly revealed his major presupposition. Reason must be yoked to ha-regesh ha-leumi.38 The national feeling, or sentiment, whose powers are elaborately depicted in the balance of his essays, shaped Jewish consciousness and subordinated all creative powers to its will. Whereas the attainment of the active intellect is the ultimate striving in the Ram bam, it is merely a means to an end in the speculations of Ahad Ha-Am. It develops that even the Rambam, great guide and emancipator that he was, served as an imperfect model for the perplexed of Ahad Ha-Am's time. The Rambam's thought was a point of departure rather than a programme for the future. The last lines with which Ahad Ha-Am concludes his Shilton ha-Sekel ascribe to Maimonides an unconscious national goal of supplying for the nation a system of thought upon which it could mature and grow during its dark exile. Ahad Ha-Am singles out the Rambam from his predeces sors by reaffirming that while they placed Judaism above reason, he identified Judaism with reason. Truly this was a new beginning in the evolution of Jewish thought. Ahad Ha-Am, ever the eclectic, took from the Rambam's thought elements which he later recombined into his own system as he attempted to become the Moreh Nebukim for the Jews of his time in their attempt to find a solution for the Zoret ha- Yahadut. 37.
