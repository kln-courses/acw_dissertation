<plain_text><page sequence="1">EARLY WOODLAND RITUAL USE OF CAVES IN EASTERN NORTH AMERICA George M. Crothers Mammoth and Salts caves in west-central Kentucky were intensively mined for gypsum and other sulfate minerals during the Early Woodland period (ca. 1000-200 B.C.)-1 propose that this mining was part of a larger ritual performance asso ciated with the initiation of adolescent males into adulthood. Drawing on ethnological literature, I suggest that, beginning in the Early Woodland, caves became integral settings for male rites of passage. This argument is based on(l) ethnographic examples of male initiation that invokes the use of caves for secrecy and seclusion, (2) fecal steroid analysis that indicates exclusive male activity, (3) medicinal use of cave minerals as a purgative, (4) evidence of sensory deprivation and possi ble use of psychotropic substances to heighten states of consciousness, and (5) collection of gypsum as a symbolic marker of transitional rites. Using an institutional economic approach, I further suggest that Early Woodland ritual cave use is correlated with the formation of new social institutions and new forms of property relations stemming from the emergence of horticultural economies in the Eastern Woodlands. El yeso y otros minerales sulfatados fueron explotados intensamente durante el periodo Woodland temprano (1000-200 a.C.) en las cuevas Mammoth y Salts en el centro-oeste de Kentucky. Propongo que esta minería fue parte de una práctica ritual mayor asociada con la iniciación de los adolescentes varones a la edad adulta. Basándose en la literatura etnológica, sugiero que, a partir del periodo Woodland temprano, las cuevas se convirtieron en las ubicaciones sistémicas para los ritos de paso masculinos. Este argumento se basa en: 1) ejemplos etnográficos de iniciación masculina que demandan el uso de las cuevas como lugares secretos y de encierro; 2) análisis fecal de esteroides que indican actividad exclusiva de hombres; 3) uso medi cinal de minerales de la cueva como purgantes; 4) evidencia de privación sensorial y el posible uso de sustancias sicotrópi cas para alcanzar estados elevados de conciencia; y 5) la recolección de yeso como marcador simbólico de los ritos de transición. Utilizando un enfoque económico, sugiero además que el uso ritual de las cuevas durante el periodo Woodland temprano se relaciona con la formación de nuevas instituciones sociales y nuevas formas de relaciones de propiedad derivadas del desa rrollo de economías horticultoras en la región este de Woodlands.
