Thus  a semi-observant Jew could have his bacon and his gefilte fish, a traditional  Sabbath meal.  The imitation of  the authentic extended to other aspects of  Jewish life.  The phrase “belonging,” for example, I first heard from our landlord. Bow- legged and waddling up the creaky stairs, he would make his way to our  apartment to collect his bi-weekly rent. He was born, bred and had prospered  in Providence, and yet he still spoke a kind of  English in which Yiddish  influences manifested themselves in intonation, diction and syntax. When he  came the first time to collect his rent, he asked me whether “you belong  already?” The question caught me unawares; bewilderment must have shown  on my face. Up to this moment I thought that I belonged to my family and by  extension to the State of  Israel, where I paid taxes, fought its wars and usually  obeyed its laws. “What I mean is that you belong to a shul,” he added for  clarification. I discovered later that there were three categories of  belonging:  1) dues-paying member of  a synagogue or temple; 2) former members who  for a variety of  reasons stopped their affiliation with the religious institution;  3) non-affiliated but planning to belong. I decided to join the third category.  In one of  his collection visits, we talked about the advantages of  higher  education in life. Chuckling between slurps of  tea, he asked me a rhetorical  question. “Tell me, Eli, who has more smartkeit (sic), you or me?” And without  pausing, he added another rhetorical question: “Who gives money to who,  every two weeks?” I thrill to disputation but do not dispute obvious facts. My  landlord’s conclusion deriving from the fact that I shelled out a bi-weekly rent  to him was irrefutable: “Obviously, you’ve the smartkeit,” I humbly conceded.  Glowing in victory, he wobbled down the stairs to knock on the door of  his  next tenant.   Black Cats versus White Cats It was a gloriously crispy New England autumnal morning as I strode across  the Brown campus to my assigned class, carrying under my arm a copious  bunch of  syllabi for “Poetry 101.” It was one of  those days when the Creator  smiles upon the earth and the Psalmist praises His creation, a day that makes  life worth living. The freshmen were hurrying to their classes, the juniors and  seniors sauntering to theirs. My state of  mind must have been closer to that  of  the juniors, though my walking pace was not. I was looking forward to  B l a c k   C a t s   v e r s u s   W h i t e   C a t s </page> <page sequence="2"> 159 meeting my class and at the same time felt apprehensive about the meeting.  What I had learned from my teaching experience was that the first encounter  with a class shaped — to a large extent — its contours and subsequently  determined its character. I breathed deeply, taking in the fresh morning air. As I walked into the dusky classroom from the bright, sunny outdoors,  I noticed through my squinting eyes about fifteen students of  various  complexions, some sitting upright, others slightly slumped in a more leisurely  position. A rather lean and small black-skinned student sat straight up between  two white-skinned counterparts, in the front row. The seats in the deeper  rows were mostly taken by white students and a few blacks. I liked that chequered class composition and tacitly welcomed the presence  of  black students. I felt an emotional closeness to black people because of  our  similar experiences. The active participation of  the Jewish community in the  Civil Rights movement made me proud of  my people. I therefore expected  a rapport between the class and me.  Actors can tell the mood of  an audience as soon as they come on stage.  Back in Israel, I got a sense of  a class on the first day of  teaching. But here, my  senses were not yet acute enough to guide me. After making some introductory  remarks, I handed out the syllabus and waited for questions. The lean black  student in the front row was the first to raise his hand. Waving the syllabus, he  announced in a defiant voice: “There’re no black cats here, only white cats.”  This announcement was followed by an orchestrated choral demand to know,  “Why are there only white cats here, no black cats?” I had been in the country  for about six weeks, watched television as time permitted, read the New York  Times daily, occasionally saw both white and black cats lurking in alleys, but  missed what their colours signified beyond their blackness and whiteness.  Surely, my coaches, David and George, would have told me that black folks  do not take kindly to white cats, or did they miss this one? I was flabbergasted  at the way events were turning out.  I needed to gain time; I needed time... I needed time to sort out my wildly  racing thoughts. My distress increased by the second. I was seeking signs  of  help among the blue-eyed blond students who sat erect in their chairs,  looking straight ahead in silence. Suddenly a thought crossed my mind. “The  entire uproar is due to medical reasons... perhaps an allergy to cats, cats that  have found shelter in the building from the morning chill.” But I could not  brace myself  to open the door to the hallway to verify my notion. So I fell  back on the last delaying tactic. Stuffing my pipe with tobacco allowed me  time to stall and finally come up with a combative ploy. I got up from my  chair, looked the syllabus-waving kid straight in the eye and stressing each  B l a c k   C a t s   v e r s u s   W h i t e   C a t s </page> <page sequence="3"> 160  word with a sculptor’s chiselling precision asked: “What do you mean?” In  response, they unleashed a harangue. While the thrust of  the harangue was  aimed at the white establishment, they targeted me as its representative. Each  of  the four students briefly told a story of  his ancestors’ suffering. The stories  were moving. White society had not owned up to its wrongdoing; the absence  of  black poets from the syllabus was indicative. Throughout the indictment  of  the white establishment, I wavered between sympathy and resentment  towards the black students. Their stories deeply touched me, but the misplaced  venue and the ill-timing of  telling them distressed me. What most disturbed  me, however, was the way they told them. The telling was orchestrated and  synchronized, akin to a well-rehearsed recitation, consequently dulling the  pain encased in the slavery experience. It showed that even an authentic story,  when lacking in spontaneity, might turn into bathos. Now that the white and black cats were put in a racial context, I slowly  came to grasp what offended the protesters. Stripped of  their felinity, the  felines assumed anthropomorphic characteristics. This I could handle. During  a short lull, I took the opportunity to offer my rebels a compromise. First  I explained to them that I had nothing to do with writing up the syllabus  outline and then I told them that I would agree to teaching black poetry,  though it might not exactly fit in with John Donne, Keats and Yeats.  They rejected my offer and renewed the class warfare, but at a lower level  of  intensity. In the course of  my teaching, I knew that maintaining one’s  composure in such circumstances was critical. I tried hard not to lose my  cool. But when my attempt to reason with them failed, my anger burst out  in a confrontational rebuke. I was offended and I gave voice to my feelings.  Raising my voice above the din I went into a monologue: “Your pain you take  out on me without knowing who I am... I belong to a people that treaded  the bloody paths of  history for two thousand years. My ancestors endured  expulsions, persecution, pogroms; they were quartered, burned on the stake.  I belong to a historically victimized people... I’m Jewish.”  Emotionally drained, I plunked down onto the chair. Silence fell in the  room. Even the blue-eyed students’ chairs squeaked, registering vital signs. My  accusers sat in silence, their postures somewhat shrunk. I only now became  aware that I had used my unlit pipe as a pointer to underscore my litany of   agonies. Though there were still about fifteen teaching minutes left, I called it  a day. Even as I gathered my things, the four black challengers approached my  desk. “We’re dropping the course,” the small, lean kid spoke.  Putting on a face of  mild disappointment — lest they change their minds —  I asked, “Why?”  B l a c k   C a t s   v e r s u s   W h i t e   C a t s </page> <page sequence="4"> 161 “It won’t work,” he said in a hushed voice. He was the most vociferous  among them. They showed signs of  discomfort. Surprisingly, they asked me  what other section of  the course I’d recommend they take. I was flattered  by the trust they put in me. The name that immediately sprang to mind was  Mr. Harold, who, hailing from California, seemed to have the right mix of   sensibilities to deal with these racial issues. They thanked me and left.  I needed a long walk to sort out my feelings and thinking. Why did the  white students keep silent? Were they intimidated or was their silence a tacit  admission of  guilt? I knew why the black kids dropped my course; they  wanted to avoid a victim rivalry. What they really wanted was a full-blooded  WASP professor, preferably with slave ownership ancestry. But why choose  a class as a place to raise your resentments? And then I had a question for  myself: why did I not mention the Holocaust and my ordeals? By the time  I got to David’s office, I had calmed down, but my face must have shown  turbulence, for David immediately noticed. I gave him a step-by-step account  of  the episode, anticipating an enormously stunned response, but instead he  smiled. Apparently, protests in classes against the Vietnam War and against  discrimination against blacks had been happening quite a bit of  late. Politically  energized by inflammatory speeches on campus, and without time to cool off,  the students would simply carry the heat of  the speeches into the classroom.  So there was nothing sensational about it, except that it happened in the  morning and the haranguing was done by freshmen. David actually praised  me for standing up to the black students.  While the term “political correctness” had not been coined yet, the  climate in which it originated already reigned at Brown as well as at other  universities. The faculty as a whole at Brown, as I learned later, tried to avoid  confrontation with students. There was a wide range of  reasons for faculty  reluctance to react to the protesters’ abrasive behaviour. Some professors  agreed with the substance of  the protests; others just did not want to turn  the classroom into an arena for verbal warfare. Still others believed that sanity  would return and the life of  the mind resume, so why get upset about it? Had  I known then the faculty’s conciliatory disposition — for want of  a more  fitting term — I might have absorbed the offences in mournful silence. But  the assertive position that I had taken in the class paid off. To begin with,  David spread the word among his peers over coffee and croissant, and I shared  my adventure with my own peers over beer. In the department corridors,  I was acknowledged with a knowing nod and smile: “This fellow from Israel  really dished it out.” In recognition of  my assertiveness, I was invited to  join a makeshift literary club. I myself  did not consider my response to the  B l a c k   C a t s   v e r s u s   W h i t e   C a t s </page> <page sequence="5"> 162  class’ disruption as anything extraordinary. Intimidation should be met with  determination, harassment with deterrence. The nearly sweeping approval of   my reaction to the provocation that I was subjected to exposed the Achilles’  heels of  human nature: the reluctance to take a stand when risk is involved.  One early morning as I was collecting my mail from the mail-box,  a significant tap on the shoulder made me turn around. There stood Handsome  Mr. Harold, to whose class I had directed my provocative students. His posture  did not bode well. Eyes shooting flaming arrows at me, he hissed through his  perfectly aligned teeth one pointed question: “Why do you hate me?”  For the record, I would like to state that I do not usually hate people,  nor do I necessarily love them. I judge people by what they say and whether  they act on their words. In this particular case, I neither hated nor loved  Harold; I was emotionally impartial to him. He was a fellow graduate student  who embraced humankind with a Mormon’s missionary passion. He loved  humanity at large and the underdogs up close. In short, he was an underdog  lover. These sentiments Harold had expressed in our short conversation over  coffee earlier in the month. It seemed then that he had the right sensibility  to channel the black kids’ anger into creative activity. Evidently, I was wrong.  Now I was facing a fuming Harold.  “Why should I hate you? I hardly know you,” I said with a shade of   affectation.  Even as I was about to elaborate on the subject of  our relationship, he cut  me short and spat out, “They’re destroying my class,” and with this he turned  on his heels and left in a huff. Handsome Harold was out of  my life for many  months. The Brown campus was not an oasis of  calm in 1968. Planted all across the  green lawns, loudspeakers emanated inflammatory speeches amid cheering  and jeering from the crowds of  students sprawled on the grass, the words  stitched into each other like threads in an exotic tapestry. Capitalism, Fascism,  Socialism, Plutocracy, Democracy, Hypocrisy and a string of  other “isms”  and “cys” liberally bounced around. It was like a Hyde Park Corner event  without the self-deprecating irony of  the speakers and the humorous taunts  of  the audience.  I would amble from speaker to speaker in search of  some idea variations,  but all the speeches sounded the same and the speakers bore a strong  resemblance to each other. They wanted a revolution and they wanted it  now; and the way to get it was to destroy the Military-Industrial Complex,  as Republican President Dwight D. Eisenhower put it in 1961. Occasionally,  I engaged the proponents of  the revolution in discussions. Having been  B l a c k   C a t s   v e r s u s   W h i t e   C a t s </page> <page sequence="6"> 163 trained in the thinking of  Marx, Engels and Lenin in my own messianic  days, I was well equipped to probe the intellectual plausibility of  their radical  endeavours. My point of  departure was that a revolution could not be made  without the active participation of  the working class and the acquiescence of   the middle class. As I expected, my discussants were better versed in the art of   love-making than in the art of  class warfare, greater celebrants of  Dionysus  than followers of  Marx. As soon as they finished their exams they screeched  out from the parking lots in their Jaguars and BMWs, leaving the revolution  and the Vietnam War in a trail of  gas emissions. To be fair, some took the  train to Washington, DC, to join the antiwar demonstrations on the Mall. In  all, it was a spectacular retreat from the campus rhetoric.  The veteran faculty took all the upheaval rather badly. The University,  situated on the hill that perched over Providence, registered a tremor; the  daily rhythm of  academia got disrupted and mitres ruffled. I took the campus  uproar as a farce, a youthful joyride masquerading as a generational rebellion.  I had been witness to and victim of  the calamities that ravaged the European  Continent, an experience that equipped me with an intuitive warning  system. The sight of  the students hanging out on the lawns, singing folk  songs accompanied by strumming guitars and punctuated by speeches, did  not trigger my alarm system. Indeed, when they returned for the 1969/1970  academic year, their revolutionary passion was quite damped. Bowing to  the Zeitgeist, the University adapted its curriculum and the undergraduates  returned to their studies in earnest. The years of  my residence in Providence, Rhode Island, were the best  years of  my academic career. The tranquility that wrapped my surroundings  allowed me thinking space, and the intellectual vibrancy that pulsated in the  university further challenged my inquisitiveness. It was not as if  I had been  deprived of  stimulation at Bar-Ilan University — Harold Fisch provided me  with plenty of  intellectual challenges — but the daily tension of  life in Israel  sapped my emotional energies. What struck me were the different questions  asked by Brown and Israeli students concerning papers that they’d handed in  for grading. The Brown student, relaxed and congenial, asked, “Did you like  my paper, Sir?” In contrast, the anxiety-ridden Israeli student asked, “What  did I get?” No wonder. The Israeli student comes to University in his early  twenties, after a three-year stint in the army, and is therefore in a hurry to  finish his studies. Unlike his Brown counterpart, he is goal-oriented to a fault.  Indeed, they live in two contrasting worlds.  Whether it is my personality or fate (and I tend to believe that one’s  personality is one’s fate), I am often led to commit follies that I subsequently  B l a c k   C a t s   v e r s u s   W h i t e   C a t s </page> <page sequence="7"> 164  come to regret. I jeopardized my standing in the Providence Jewish community  because of  a critical article I published in Haaretz about Jewish education  in the U.S., using Providence as an illustrative case. The article, entitled  “The Silent Conspiracy of  Jewish Education in the U.S.,” was based on my  observations of  the local Hebrew schools, reading of  the curricula, or the  lack of  them, and examination of  the accompanying didactic books. My wife  taught in the afternoon Hebrew school, and she related to me the educational  flaws of  the system. The pedagogy in the Hebrew Supplementary Schools  was reminiscent of  the Kosher Style food, symptomatic of  the efforts of  an  ethnic minority to become part of  the American ethos and still retain a Jewish  identity. The Supplementary School was supposed to nurture the students’  Jewish heritage, while the public or private school was to inculcate the Jewish  child with Americanism. And because American culture has such a pervasive  influence, Judaism, in due course, becomes diluted. The situation is not unlike  the Kosher Style food construct, where the Style overwhelms the Kosher. It  was a courageous attempt to maintain the hyphen between Americana and  Judaism. At the time I had not realized the American Jewish resilience in  a state of  constant strife, its ability to retain religious and ethnic continuity in  the face of  assimilation pressures.  It was Rabbi William Braude of  the Reform Temple who had me over  for lunch to educate me about the American Diaspora. He had read my  criticism in Haaretz — a paper he subscribed to — and found its author  sadly wanting in understanding Jewish life in America. He began by asking  me whether I was aware of  the cultural pressures on Jewish tradition and  consequently the drift away from Judaism. “Your article implies,” he argued,  “that the Supplementary Schools have little or no impact on their students’  Jewish awareness and therefore should be done away with.” I objected to  his characterization, arguing that I meant to say that the Schools could be  made didactically more effective. I came out of  this dialogue with a deeper  understanding of  the religious and ethnically existential realities the Jewish  community was facing. I realized that my observations were made from  an Israeli perspective. I was humbled and conveyed my apologies to the  Rabbi. The Jewish identity is not questioned in Israel; there are other problems  visited on its citizens, but not identity issues. Later I kept on asking myself   why I would get involved in an issue that supposedly did not concern me —  when, as the Texas argot has it, I had no dog in this fight.  I was into my second year of  graduate studies and we intended to return  to Israel as soon as I was done, so why would I want to badmouth the good  B l a c k   C a t s   v e r s u s   W h i t e   C a t s </page> <page sequence="8"> 165 people of  Providence? They had greeted us with a welcome basket, saw to it  that we got free dental work, invited us to their homes on holidays, and some  of  them became close friends — and despite their generosity I criticized their  institutions of  education.  As I was probing deeper into my motivation, it dawned on me that I was  driven by an act of  defiance, namely wishing not to hand Hitler a posthumous  victory. Education was an antidote to assimilation and subsequently to the  diminishing numbers of  the Jewish population. I was neither religious  nor nationalistic. Had I been given a choice of  religion, I would not have  chosen Judaism or Christianity. Monotheistic religions have a zealous  disposition, consequently wreaking havoc. In Israel as well as in the Diaspora,  I occasionally went to weddings, rarely to funerals, and when the spirit took  me, to a synagogue. I also went to church to watch Mass; its stylized pageantry  fascinated me. Had I lived before Paul’s vision on his way to Damascus,  I would have been a devoted pagan. But Jewish continuity gave purpose to  my three-year suffering; my loss of  youth and family constituted the core of   my being.  In the course of  my rather itinerant career, I often compromised my  principles and bowed to opportunism with a view to advancing my interests,  but not when it came to the Holocaust. Enshrined in a kind of  closed garden,  impenetrable from the outside material world or by my own evil inclinations,  Memory was a driving force in my life. And I paid a high price for adhering  to it. At the time, I was not conscious of  the impact that my past ordeals  had on my daily life and particularly on my life of  the mind. Only in the  clarifying process of  writing my dissertation did I slowly come to understand  the grooves they had worn on my consciousness.  I was overwhelmed by my daily responsibilities. Teaching, the coursework,  and the writing of  the doctoral proposal left little time for social life. The  proposal had to be approved prior to my becoming qualified to take the final  exams. Some of  the courses were enlightening and crystallized the premise of   my proposal; others honed my knowledge of  the Elizabethan and Jacobean  periods; and still others turned out to be achingly boring. No surprise there.  While sitting around the seminar table, you could tell from the colour of  the  professor’s notes the approximate date they had been scribbled. Faded in  time like their tenured author, they gave off  an autumnal yellowish whiff.  On the whole, the calibre of  the professors was intellectually outstanding,  and their high quality was manifested in their wide breadth of  knowledge.  My former section instructor, James Boulger, a Romanticist, who boasted  a delicate palate for fish, used to share his favourite dishes with me as well as  B l a c k   C a t s   v e r s u s   W h i t e   C a t s </page> <page sequence="9"> 166  his thinking. I appreciated his munificence on both counts. And there were  my fellow students, doctoral aspirants, hard-working, stressed out, crouched  in their library carrels, whom I liked to engage in conversation whenever  physical and mental time allowed.  An Immodest Proposal These were spiritually and intellectually rewarding times. I was moving at  a reasonable pace to meet the marked deadlines. While the relevant committee  was considering my proposal, “Irrational Man in the Jacobean Drama and in  the Theatre of  the Absurd,” I was getting ready for the final stretch. The  proposal was an extension of  my Masters thesis, to which Professor Fisch of   Bar-Ilan had taken exception because of  the chronological break between the  two periods. At the back of  my mind I had, therefore, a niggling doubt about  the scholarly soundness of  my dramatic concept. So when the chairman of   the committee, Mr. Andrew Sable, asked me to “drop by in my office for  a little chat,” my doubts morphed into a constant haunt. Mindful not to hurt  me, Sable chose his words carefully. “The committee appreciates your original  ideas,” the habitually ebullient Andy said, sounding rather grim, “but finds  that the proposal needs more substantiation.” He had more nice things to  say about me that were of  little consolation. Usually, I would go to David  for advice, but this news was too shocking to share with him. I wanted first  to digest it myself  before broaching the subject with David. I rushed to the  Ford Library, hoping to discover some kind of  support for my thesis. As  I pored over the drama magazines, Fischs’s sentence “It’s too big a leap,” kept  on echoing in my head. My doctoral project had been planned for three years.  For the last two years, I had mulled over the affinities between the Jacobeans  plays and the Absurdist plays. The productions I had seen in London had  alerted me to their similarities. A switch of  topics at this stage was tantamount  to shunting railway tracks and directing the train to a different destination.  I was mentally unable to do it, and even if  I were, my scholarship was running  out. I had suffered many setbacks over the years, and this one was particularly  severe for several reasons. Living in the shadow of  the swastika, I had had  to take many winding roads, navigate shoals, evade hunters, and plead with  evil-wishers, and consequently I was equipped to deal with danger. But this  was a totally different situation. I did not face enemies. On the contrary,  I was sure that each member of  the committee wished me well and would  be willing to help me, particularly to help me switch my topic. I met David  for our customary evening walk, traditionally followed by a hefty portion  A n   I m m o d e s t   P r o p o s a l </page> </plain_text>
