<plain_text><page sequence="1">Pnin's History CHARLES NICOL "The history of man is the history of pain!"-Timofey Pnin Pnin, one of Vladimir Nabokov's most approachable novels, may be read enjoy- ably on an elementary level for its "human interest"-those quotation marks, and that sneer, belong to Nabokov himself. Consequently, some critics have praised Pnin out of all proportion, and Nabokov's best critics have tended to over-react and slight this delightful novel. A book that can be enjoyed by simple people is not necessarily a simple book, and Pnin is as complicated as a pet snake. Timofey Pnin, a pathetically comic Russian emigre, teaches his native language at Waindell College, somewhere in New England. His ineffectual English makes him the butt of countless jokes; amid this alien corn Pnin wanders with apparent cheer, but cannot always avoid hearing the mockery of his numerous mimics on campus. Far from a cliche clown, Pnin is inescapably comic because he is a pen- guin out of water, a man who had the world pulled out from under him. Among fellow Russian emigres a highly intelligent, articulate, polite, scholarly student of the social sciences, among Americans he appears an incoherent fool, unschooled in the simplest of the mores of "unpredictable America." As a whole, Pnin's life may be tragic, but in its visible fragments it is either comic or pathetic. Nabokov thoroughly exploits these dual possibilities, continually shifting his focus and our allegiance. While the views of Pnin are ambivalent, they are rarely ambiguous; the dis- tinction is between Pnin fooled and Pnin hurt. In the first chapter we witness Pnin's comic misadventures with American trains, busses, and women's clubs, as well as his pathetic heart attack. The second chapter includes his hilarious en- counters with a washing machine and a heart-breaking visit from his cruel, thoughtless, exploitative ex-wife. The quiet third chapter records his comic bat- tles with the college library as well as the loss of his pleasant room and his failure to recognize his own birthday. The fourth chapter begins a rising movement in Pnin's fortunes: he meets his ex-wife's son Victor to their mutual delight. The comedy of this chapter involves Pnin's-or America's-confusion between foot- ball and soccer, the vagaries of Jack London's literary reputation, and Victor's height; a comic fall gives Pnin a later, pathetic backache. The fifth chapter, Pnin with fellow emigres, shows him at his best: the comedy involves not just Pnin lost in the Catskills, but also Pnin marvellously talented at croquet; the pathos is Pnin's remembrance of a childhood sweetheart who died in a Nazi concentration camp. The sixth chapter begins a corresponding falling movement. The comedy is again on Pnin's side, the triumph of his little party. The emotion catches us rather off-guard, for just as Pnin is feeling most at home in his new house and in</page><page sequence="2">NOVEL SPRING 1971 Waindell College, he is informed that he is about to lose his job. The seventh chapter details how Pnin first met his cheaply poetic and intellectual ex-wife Liza, and how now, on his birthday, Pnin leaves Waindell College with no particular destiny in mind and no new job in sight (in Pale Fire we find that Pnin did eventually find a better job). In this last chapter what humor there is, is deliber- ately flat. That four of its seven chapters appeared first as separate stories in The New Yorker tends to reinforce the impression that this short novel is marvellously realized throughout, but fails to progress; though his circumstances have changed, Pnin at the end of the novel may seem much the same as at its begin- ning. Lost: his position at Waindell. Gained: friendship with Victor and the com- pletion of an extensive piece of research. But because of these two (closely related) gains, Pnin's character does indeed change. After Liza's visit in the second chapter, the utter loneliness of Pnin comes home to him and he yields to his grief: "'I haf nofing,' wailed Pnin between loud, damp sniffs, 'I haf nofing left, nofing, nofing !' " In contrast, at the end of the sixth chapter when he again seems to have nothing left, neither job, house, nor punch-bowl, "bracing himself" he stoically continues washing dishes. Pnin's progress, the gains which brings about this character change, are the subject of this paper. Many of Nabokov's novels have men of letters as their subjects, fictional authors whose projected writings reveal something about themselves. Naturally, these works often also inform us of Nabokov's own intentions; The Real Life of Sebastian Knight mirrors the novels supposedly written by its title figure, and Humbert's writings on psychology, Proust, and memory provide insights into Lolita. In like manner, the research of modest and scholarly Timofey Pnin pro- vides another dimension for our view of Pnin. The content of Pnin's research is a bit hard to establish, however, since it is only mentioned twice, first in the third chapter: He contemplated writing a Petite Histoire of Russian culture, in which a choice of Russian Curiosities, Customs, Literary Anecdotes, and so forth would be presented in such a way as to reflect in miniature la Grande Histoire-Major Concatenations of Events. He was still at the blissful state of collecting his material; and many good young people considered it a treat and an honor to see Pnin pull out a catalogue drawer from the comprehensive bosom of a card cabinet and take it, like a big nut, to a secluded corner and there make a quiet mental meal of it, now moving his lips in soundless comment, critical, satisfied, perplexed, and now lifting his rudimentary eyebrows and forgetting them there, left high upon his spacious brow where they remained long after all trace of displeasure or doubt had gone. Note for later reference the simile of the card catalogue, "like a big nut," and its further development where Pnin becomes, metaphorically, a squirrel. In the next 198</page><page sequence="3">CHARLES NICOL PNIN'S HISTORY paragraph we find Pnin consulting a "voluminous work... on Russian myths," but we find out no more about that research until the sixth chapter, several years later, when we are told that the project is practically finished: Index cards were gradually loading a shoe box with their compact weight. The collation of two legends; a precious detail in manners or dress; a reference checked and found to be falsified by incompetence, carelessness, or fraud; the spine thrill of a felicitous guess; and all the innumerable triumphs of bezkor- istniy (disinterested, devoted) scholarship-this had corrupted Pnin, this had made of him a happy, footnote-drugged maniac who disturbs the book mites in a dull volume, a foot thick, to find in it a reference to an even duller one. And this is all. Two mentions, separated by almost half the novel. There are no other references to Pnin's research, and the trail of his little history grows cold. And yet-we all know that when a man is wrapped up in his studies, some of that wrapping unwinds wherever he goes. At his own party, over-wound Pnin suddenly explodes into suspiciously detailed, very pedantic footnotes about the Cinderella fairy-tale: . .. Professor Pnin remarked. . . that Cendrillon's shoes were not made of glass but of Russian squirrel fur-vair, in French. It was, he said, an obvious case of the survival of the fittest among words, verre being more evocative than vair which, he submitted, came not from varius, variegated, but from veveritsa, Slavic for a certain beautiful, pale, winter-squirrel fur, having a bluish, or bet- ter say sizily, columbine, shade-from columba, Latin for "pigeon," as some- body here well knows-so you see, Mrs. Fire, you were, in general, correct. Here, suddenly and clearly, is an example of Pnin's research on his Petite Histoire, an example that corresponds perfectly to Nabokov's second mention of that research (see above), for it includes not only "the collation of two legends" and "a precious detail in manners or dress," but even, most compactly, those index cards "loading a shoe box"! So Pnin has discovered how Cinderella's shoes changed from squirrel to glass. In his projected book, this little discovery will provide a model for some major trend in Russian history; however, it also illustrates a Major Concatenation of Events in the Life of Timofey Pnin: squirrel to glass. For there can be no doubt that Pnin is associated with squirrels throughout the novel. In the first chapter Pnin suffers a heart attack that recalls a childhood delirium; then in his fever he had felt that a squirrel drawn on a screen by his bed held the answer to the world's riddle. That remembered picture overlaps Pnin's confused perception of his present surroundings, a park where a gray squirrel sits in front of him, emblematically holding a peach stone. In the second chapter, in a second park, Pnin gives a third squirrel water from a drinking fountain, thinking "she has fever, perhaps." In the third chapter, a squirrel 199</page><page sequence="4">NOVEL SPRING 1971 crosses the snow in front of the college library, and later Pnin is directly com- pared to a squirrel (in the extended description, already quoted, of Pnin investi- gating a catalogue drawer). The fourth, central chapter is as much about young Victor Wind as it is about Timofey. And when Pnin begins writing to Victor, he follows his first letter with "a picture postcard representing the Gray Squirrel." It is, in a sense that Pnin himself does not understand, Pnin's calling card. (The Gray Squirrel, Sciurus carolinensis, is the uniquely American squirrel. Might Pnin's squirrels, or Pnin himself, belong to a special Nabokovian sub-variety, American-Russian, Carolina Slavsky-the name of a minor character in Pnin?) "Victor," we are told, "was glad to learn that 'squirrel' came from a Greek word which meant 'shadow-tail.' " We shall return later, first to Victor, then to shadow- tail. The fifth chapter begins with Pnin somewhere in New England, lost; after a hunter fires at a squirrel and misses, Pnin finds his road. The sixth chapter contains the history of Cinderella's shoes, which we have already mentioned; Pnin demonstrates that they were originally made from Russian squirrel fur. The seventh, last chapter contains the narrator's glimpse of young Pnin's Rus- sian schoolroom, where a stuffed squirrel stands among the toys and books. Victor, Liza's son by Eric Wind while she was still Mrs. Pnin, is associated with glass, for he is, thematically, the later version of Cinderella's slipper. Glass can reflect and refract events, as well as shadow them, and all of Victor's painting and drawing is concerned with optical effects; for instance, he spends much time observing the appearance of various objects through the distortion of a glass of water. One of his ancestors was "a stained-glass artist in Liibeck." Victor, at St. Bart's, learns from Lake, his art teacher, that the order of the solar spectrum is not a closed circle but a spiral of tints from cadmium red and oranges through a strontian yellow and a pale paradisal green to cobalt blues and violets, at which point the sequence does not grade into red again but passes into another spiral, which starts with a kind of laven- der gray and goes on to Cinderella shades transcending human perception. Pnin approaches the Cinderella tale through history and legends; Victor ap- proaches the same material through art, and eventually sends Pnin a beautiful punch-bowl of aquamarine glass. One of Pnin's guests, admiring this gift, also uses the Cinderella description: "when she was a child, she imagined Cinderella's glass shoes to be exactly of that greenish blue tint." These words prompt Pnin's discussion of Cinderella's shoes. Squirrel, glass, we have come full circle again. It should be made clear at this point that squirrels are not symbols for Pnin, shorthand to represent him, or reductions of him, but only themes associated with him. Nabokov's method of associational cross-references, "not text but texture," is uniquely non-reductive, non-levelling. If one thing can be reduced to another, then the first item has no independent value; if one thing stands for another, then the system is itself unnecessary. Nabokov clearly objects to all re- 200</page><page sequence="5">CHARLES NICOLIPNIN'S HISTORY 201 ductive systems, particularly Freudian and Marxian, that treat art as source material for ideas, denying creation its essential dignity. Nabokov investigates events not in their reduction to a hidden simplicity, but in their hidden complexity. Drunk on Pnin's punch, one of the guests at Pnin's party asks it this way: "But don't you think-haw-that what he is trying to do-haw-practically in all his novels-haw-is-haw-to express the fantastic recurrence of certain situations?" This calls to mind Nabokov's discussion (in his autobiography) of his two memories of General Kuropatkin, and how these memories are both associated with sulfur matches. "What pleases me," Nabokov wrote, "is the evolution of the match theme"-and then comes one of the orga- nizing principles of his art: "The following of such thematic designs through one's life should be, I think, the true purpose of autobiography."1 Following such designs is also for Nabokov a rationale of fiction, and the relationship of Timofey and Victor may be obliquely described as the evolution of the Cinderella's slip- per theme. We may note in passing that the Cinderella motif apparently fascinates Na- bokov, for Cinderella stories are hidden in at least two other novels. In Bend Sinister, Mariette, the amoral girl who spies on Krug, keeps house for him, and nearly becomes his mistress, is the youngest of the three Bachofen sisters. A young policeman once calls her by "a secret diminutive which none knew, which he had somehow divined." That diminutive is "Cin."2 In Ada there are numerous Cinderella references: in the garbled play of the second chapter the servant girls are described as "Cinderellas"; the curtain falls with an actor "holding the glass slipper." And the servant girl Blanche is throughout Ada described as Cinderella or "Cendrillon." Once "she rushed down the corridor and lost a miniver-trimmed slipper on the grand staircase, like Ashette in the English version."3 She is, of course, another totally false Cinderella: she suffers from venereal diseases and eventually marries a man named Fartukov. Is there a Cinderella story in Pnin? If so, it is not a parody as in Bend Sinister and Ada, but a transfiguration. In most older versions of the Cinderella tale, Cinderella is befriended not by a fairy godmother but by a helpful animal, which frequently has to be killed for its magic to take effect.' Pnin is indeed befriended by a series of uncanny squirrels in the novel, he makes the necessary sacrificial connection in his rather far-fetched insistence that the fur of Cinderella's slippers was squirrel fur, and he possesses "frail-looking, almost feminine feet." We also identify with him in his frequent humiliations in the same way we identify with Cinderella in the ashes. But this seems inadequate evidence. This brings us to the possibility that Victor is the "male Cinderella." The most famous version of Cin- derella, "Cendrillon" by Perrault, is the version that Pnin discusses at his party. Perrault introduces the glass slipper to the story, and Pnin's guess that he con- 1 Speak, Memory: An Autobiography Revisited (New York, 1966), p. 27. 2 Bend Sinister (New York, 1964), p. 186. 3 Ada (New York, 1969), p. 114. 4Marian Roalfe Cox, Cinderella (London, 1893), passim.</page><page sequence="6">NOVEL SPRING 1971 fused vair and verre is accepted scholarship.5 Victor, as we have said, is associated with glass, and consequently with this version of the tale. Perrault's version also includes the fairy godmother, and to some extent Pnin fills this role for Victor- he may also be the fairy-tale prince, since in Victor's dream Pnin is the King. Further, Victor is kept at St. Bart's for a day of his vacation as punishment for smoking; telltale ashes had been found in the attic, and ashes are Cinderella's trademark. But again, it is dangerous to press the case for Victor as Cinderella too far. It is clear that we do not have an especially strong case for either Pnin or Victor as Cinderella; what we do have is a substantial comparison of early and late artifacts of the Cinderella tale, with the representatives of the two versions trading emblems: Pnin sends Victor a card with a squirrel on it, while Victor sends Pnin a glass punch-bowl of "Cinderella" color. We do not have the evolu- tion of a story, but the evolution of a theme in that story. The card that Pnin sends Victor, carefully chosen from "an educational series depicting Our Mammals and Birds," tells us that "squirrel" comes from the Greek for "shadow-tail." The Greek for shadow is skia. We know from Pale Fire the importance to Nabokov of Shade and Shadow; it is therefore fitting that, just as this card helps begin the relationship of Victor and Pnin, this word as a "thematic design" helps demonstrate their deep natural affinity. In the very first section of the first chapter, we are told that Pnin can "shadowgraph with his knuckles a rabbit (complete with blinking eye)." Here, "shadowgraph" has a per- fectly clear meaning. Compare the same word, at a different stage in its etymo- logical history, applied to Victor: He studied his mediums with the care and patience of an insatiable child-one of those painter's apprentices (it is now Lake who is dreaming!), lads with bobbed hair and bright eyes who would spend years grinding colors in the workshop of some great Italian skiagrapher, in a world of amber and paradisal glazes. Here, with "shadow" moved back into Greek, Nabokov seems to be referring to some highly technical artistic process. But there is apparently no such term as "skiagrapher" in the history of art-although Victor is indeed visiting Italy with his mother at the end of the novel. It is, rather, an early term for a Roentgen photographer; that is, a skiagrapher is an X-ray technician. ("Pnin said, laughing, that every time he was X-rayed, doctors vainly tried to puzzle out what they termed 'a shadow behind the heart.' ") But while there has been no such term in art, Nabokov demonstrates that there easily could be. A skiagrapher might project shadows, or sketch shadows, or draw silhouettes. Pnin, as we have seen, does the first. Victor does the second: He never went through that initial stage of graphic activity when infants draw Kopffiisslers (tadpole people), or humpty dumpties with L-like legs, and arms 5 Stith Thompson, The Folktale (New York, 1946), p. 127. 202</page><page sequence="7">CHARLES NICOLIPNIN'S HISTORY ending in rake prongs; in fact, he avoided the human form altogether and when pressed by Papa (Dr. Eric Wind) to draw Mama (Dr. Liza Wind), responded with a lovely undulation, which he said was her shadow on the new refriger- ator.... And at six, Victor already distinguished what so many adults never learn to see-the colors of shadows, the difference in tint between the shadow of an orange and that of a plum or of an avocado pear. Thus Pnin and Victor are both practitioners of the art of skiagraphy. Amusingly, so is Nabokov, who chooses the third and, he admits, easiest method of ski- agraphy to end his fifth chapter: On the distant crest of the knoll, at the exact spot where Gramineev's easel had stood a few hours before, two dark figures in profile were silhouetted against the ember-red sky. They stood there closely, facing each other. One could not make out from the road whether it was the Poroshin girl and her beau, or Nina Bolotov and young Poroshin, or merely an emblematic couple placed with easy art on the last page of Pnin's fading day. Of course Nabokov is a far better shadowgrapher when he so chooses. Indeed, the references to shadows in all the novels continually reinforce our impression that Nabokov is in total control, that his characters are only shades, shadows, figments of the imagination of "an anthropomorphic deity impersonated by me,"6 with no independent life of their own. They are but Nabokov's shadows on the page, and their existence has no reality apart from the whims of their creator. In the undercurrents of this novel, Pnin and young Victor are related by the Cinderella story and by shadowgraphy. What that relationship approximates is obvious even on the novel's surface: father and son. The thematic designs run in harmony with the flow of the novel. Pnin's triumph is that eventually he and Victor qualify as father and son under every test but flesh itself. Approached directly, the relationship is a reasonable one. Liza, Victor's mother, was at the time of her pregnancy Pnin's wife. (One analysis of Pnin incorrectly states that when she married Pnin, Liza was already pregnant.7 Since she married Pnin on the rebound from her affair with the narrator, and since the narrator seems to be Nabokov himself, this would indeed be a fascinating situation. The chronology is, however, impossible.) Although Liza eventually marries Eric Wind, Victor's actual father, still later she takes for granted that Pnin will help finance the education of a boy he is not related to and has never met, simply be- cause the relationships of Victor and Pnin to Liza make them father and son by extrapolation. And when Liza, Timofey, and Eric all came to America on the same ocean liner, Liza and Eric both seemed more than willing to include Pnin in their parenthood. When Eric referred to "our child," Nabokov tells us, "the 'our' sounded tri-personal." Given Pnin's wide sympathies, his innocence and open- ness, his plans at the end of his European career to raise then-unborn Victor as G Bend Sinister, p. xviii. 7 Page Stegner, Escape Into Aesthetics: The Art of Vladimir Nabokov (New York, 1966), p. 93. 2.03</page><page sequence="8">NOVEL SPRING 1971 his own, and his still firm attachment to Liza, Pnin's acceptance of Victor as a son is effortlessly believable. The problem is Victor himself. Victor is a very talented youth, possibly a ge- nius; like Pnin he is a loner; before he meets Pnin Nabokov confides about him, "I do not think he loved anybody." Yet, almost purely through indirection, Na- bokov has convinced us by the end of the novel that Victor, in spite of his "ami- cable aloofness," thinks of Pnin as his proper father. This involves a careful predisposing of Victor's fantasies, tastes, and opinions. Victor's relationships with Eric and Liza are hardly satisfactory: "Both parents, in their capacity of psycho-therapists, did their best to impersonate Laius and Jocasta, but the boy proved to be a very mediocre little Oedipus." Considering Nabokov's well-known attitude toward Freud, this statement is hardly surprising. What is surprising is that Andrew Field, perhaps our foremost Nabokov expert, has in his study of Nabokov come close to reproducing this "modish triangle of Freudian romance." Victor has a recurring fantasy about "the King, his father." Because in these dreams the man who has married Liza resembles Victor "as that underformer imagined he would look at forty himself," Field assumes that Victor wishes to elevate himself to the role of "the King, his more plausible father."8 But this would mean that Victor wishes to replace his father in his mother's affection, and has in his imagination destroyed his father (Eric is non-existent in the dream) in order to marry his mother (the photograph of the King's wife is clearly of Liza-but she is dead also). Since Field failed to comment on these Oedipal implications, perhaps he did not realize the consequences of his reading of Victor's fantasy. Victor's dream is not, as Field apparently reads it, a boy's fantasy about being king, but a more significant fantasy on the subject of an ideal father. Logic would dictate to Victor that his father should resemble himself. While "the residue of various family allusions of long standing to the flight of Russian intellectuals from Lenin's regime" has its place in the dream, the other "obvious sources" include "an Italian film, made in Berlin for American consumption," "an anony- mous Kafkaesque story," and The Scarlet Pimpernel. Curiously, Nabokov fails to mention here the Shakespearean sources for the king pacing "a beach on the Bohemian Sea, at Tempest Point." Prospero in The Tempest is an exiled duke, while the geographically absurd Sea of Bohemia is found in Winter's Tale, whose plot deals in part with a princess exiled from birth and her eventual reunion with her father the king. At any rate, if we follow Victor's dream to that "crucial flight episode when the King alone . . . paced a beach on the Bohemian Sea," we find it merging with Pnin's dream that ends the chapter. Pnin's dream ap- parently occurs on the coast of that same "hopeless sea," so it is no wonder that his friend has gone home to get a map. (This theme of the impossible voyage occurs also in the middle of the chapter in the legendary float trip of Saint Bar- tholomew's casket from the landlocked Caspian Sea to the coast of Sicily.) Pnin, who has escaped from a palace in his own dream, must also be the king, the 8 Andrew Field, Nabokov: His Life in Art (Boston, 1967), p. 138. 204</page><page sequence="9">CHARLES NICOLIPNIN'S HISTORY "more plausible father," in Victor's dream, for the dream has insistently recurred to Victor ever since Liza, her marriage to Eric breaking up, first informed him [Victor] that she had been Mrs. Pnin before she left Europe. She told him that this former husband of hers had migrated to America too-that in fact he would soon see Victor; and since everything Liza alluded to .. . in- variably took on a veneer of mystery and glamour, the figure of the great Timofey Pnin . . . acquired in Victor's hospitable mind a curious charm, a family resemblance to those Bulgarian kings or Mediterranean princes who used to be world-famous experts in butterflies or sea shells. Thus, even before meeting him, Victor's choice for father (and king) is a tenta- tive Pnin. Their first meeting, in chapter four, is "extremely satisfactory." Because of this meeting, the chapter has the underlying theme of the cross, or intersection at right angles (the intersection on a map in the first part, Jung's mandala in the third, a Celtic cross of stone in the fourth). Because Pnin is Victor's "water father"-an insistent reference in the novel-it rains throughout this chapter, even in dreams. And of course, it is a tremendous formal and psychological rein- forcement that at the end of the chapter Pnin picks up the dream where Victor left off at the beginning of the chapter. With this device, the central chapter of the novel circles back on itself, the same way the entire novel circles back when lack Cockerell's story "of Pnin rising to address the Cremona Women's Club and discovering he had brought the wrong lecture," the last words of the book, reminds us of, and brings us back to, the first chapter, where Pnin prepares to deliver that lecture. There is plenty of room for Pnin in Victor's life, for his attitude toward his indifferent, "real" parents is quite clear. Eric, "a cranky refugee doctor, whom the lad had never much liked and had not seen now for almost two years," is hardly a rival for Liza's affections, since he now lives in South America and Liza is about to marry for a third time. And the narrator expressly rejects the possi- bility that Victor is jealous about his mother's love: "In his attitude toward his mother, passionate childhood affection had long since been replaced by tender condescension." Victor has no Oedipus complex. But this condescension apparently does not extend to Liza's appearance, for the desk photograph in Victor's dream indicates that he and his mother share the same opinion of her beauty and of her style, "those great blue eyes, that carmine mouth (it was a colored photo, not fit for a king, but no matter)." Compare the emphasis in a poem that Liza wrote in Paris: "No jewels, save my eyes, do I own, but I have a rose which is even softer than my rose lips." Dismissing those jewel eyes but keeping in mind both pairs of rose lips, we may further note that Liza's early collection of Russian poems is entitled Dry Lips, and that she inscribes them to the narrator in "dark-red ink." With this emphasis in mind, we realize that Victor's own poem is not just about da Vinci's painting, but about his mother (Liza of course equals Lisa; indeed, Pnin's proposal of marriage addresses her as "Lise"): 205</page><page sequence="10">NOVEL SPRING 1971 Leonardo! Strange diseases strike at madders mixed with lead: nun-pale now are Mona Lisa's lips that you had made so red. And now that, in Victor's poem, this contrast of nun-like appearance and lurid reality has been added to the mix, notice that the same pattern comes up in Liza's own poem, the one she recites to Pnin at Waindell: I have put on a dark dress And am more modest than a nun; An ivory crucifix Is over my cold bed. But the lights of fabulous orgies Burn through my oblivion, And I whisper the name George- Your golden name! Clearly, Victor understands his mother's character. Incidentally, the ultimate joke in this particular thematic complex threatens to be a private one for Rus- sians, for Liza's poems are described as being unoriginal in a special way, "the kind of stuff that emigre rhymsterettes wrote after Akmatova." Twice in Pnin Liza's poems are described as weak imitations of Anna Akhmatova, and Akhma- tova was herself notoriously denounced by Zhdanov (Stalin's sub-dictator in matters of culture) in 1946 as "a mixture of nun and harlot."9 Nabokov's joke is that this parody of criticism does apply perfectly to the poetry of Liza, herself a parody of a poetess. In these family relationships, Pnin can be profitably compared to Joyce's Ulysses, one of the few twentieth-century works for which Nabokov has unre- strained admiration-a comparison one critic has already pointed out.10 Liza, like Molly Bloom, is an unfaithful Penelope to her Odysseus, while Pnin is the "true" father of Victor, as Bloom is of Stephen. Victor is also more autobiographical than he first appears (extending the comparison with Joyce's Stephen), since Nabokov was almost by mistake christened Victor (according to the autobiog- raphy, at least), and was expected to become not a writer but a painter." Victor, then, embodies two alternative paths, or "time-forks," in Nabokov's life. Al- though he insists that the biography of the artist is ultimately irrelevant to ful- filled art, one suspects that Nabokov has a control over his biography that rivals his control over his fiction, and that these little references were not intended to go forever unnoticed. 9 Alexander Werth, "Akhmatova: Tragic Queen Anna," London Magazine, VI (December 1966), 88. 10 Ambrose Gordon, Jr., "The Double Pnin," in Nabokov: The Man and His Work, ed.

If that relationship has been over-emphasized in this paper, it is because the thematic strands investigated here all led back to Pnin's "family." The relationship to Victor is not Pnin's whole history, but it is a major factor in Pnin's progress. Hopefully the reader is by now convinced that the book is an intricate webbing of cross-references, a fully realized novel rather than a series of casually connected sketches. There is more to Pnin. His full character development lies in his rejection of Nabokov-or, purists will insist, of Nabokov's persona. Several commentators have, rightly, been intrigued with the particularly wobbly lines between the author, the narrator, and ultimately the character in the novel who seems to be Nabokov. That is precisely the point: Pnin rejects them all. This devilish com- posite personality I shall simply call Nabokov. Nabokov, author and narrator, leads Pnin through innumerable agonies of fever, seizure, "pain and panic" in the first chapter; in the second he dredges up Liza and reduces Pnin to his nadir. In the third chapter, Nabokov the narrator warns the "careless reader" that it is Pnin's birthday, but no one warns Pnin. "And where will fate send me?" Pnin wonders, following the thought of the Pushkin poem he has just taught in class; he fails to find out. He is unknowingly preparing for a Pushkinian "future anniversary," the birthday several years later when he will leave Waindell College. Pnin has now begun his research on the Petite Histoire in earnest, storing up fragments against his ruin. In the fourth chapter, Pnin affirms the new pattern of his life through meeting and cherishing Victor. The fifth chapter provides Pnin with a breathing space, the semblance of a full life, visiting Russian friends, talking about Victor, showing his mental and physical prowess. But Nabokov is mentioned during a conversation, and un- fortunate, not-quite-so-innocent Pnin says, "I have always had the impression that his entomology was merely a pose." "Oh no," replies Pnin's best friend Chateau, continuing rather ominously, "You will lose it some day," referring to "the Greek Catholic cross on a golden chainlet" that Pnin has temporarily taken off. Whether or not we take this as a threat from an insulted author, the next, sixth chapter includes another attempt to reduce Timofey to nothing. Herman Hagen tells vulnerable Pnin that he will almost certainly be fired when a new chairman takes over. When Hagen reveals that Nabokov will be a lecturer in the English Department and a potential employer, Pnin insists, "I will never work under him." Possibly because Pnin has rejected the author's conciliatory gesture, a further disaster now occurs: quietly washing dishes, Pnin drops a nutcracker into the water, "where an excruciating crack of broken glass followed upon the plunge." The "melodious" punch-bowl, Pnin's most precious possession, his 12 Bend Sinister, p. xiv. 207</page><page sequence="12">NOVEL SPRING 1971 Cinderella link to Victor, seems to have been broken. Nabokov has slipped tre- mendous importance into that aquamarine punch-bowl, invisible in a sink full of water. And Pnin rises magnificently to the occasion. In The Real Life of Se- bastian Knight, only after merging the experience of two lives is the narrator able to speculate on the possibility of Nabokov's existence. In Bend Sinister Nabokov confronts the hero on a "beam of pale light" and drives him mad. Stupendous Pnin, standing once again in the wreckage of his life, confronts fate, chance, Nabokov with all the energy in his zig-zag soul, and drags his punch-bowl back from Hades: Pnin hurled the towel into a corner and, turning away, stood for a moment staring at the blackness beyond the threshold of the open back door. A quiet, lacy-winged little green insect [an emblem of entomologist Nabokov, this bug is the signature, the evidence of Nabokov's presence in the scene] circled in the glare of a strong naked lamp above Pnin's glossy bald head. He looked very old, with his toothless mouth half open and a film of tears dimming his blank, unblinking eyes. Pnin seems dead himself on his return from this "duration," this long moment where we feel time in our bones, but at this crucial moment of time suspension to which the novel has led, he has confronted Nabokov and won: his punch-bowl is intact. In the last chapter Nabokov emerges from his den, striking in all directions, and takes on the definite shape of a character. He visits a direct hit on Pnin's past by telling us that it was his own affair with Liza that precipitated her into marriage with Pnin. We hear Pnin call Nabokov "a dreadful inventor"-to his face. We find Pnin and Nabokov cheerfully riding a New York bus together. It is clear that Nabokov and Pnin have ambivalent feelings toward each other, but Nabokov, as author as well as narrator and character, is ultimately always in control; we are perhaps annoyed by his tone of sympathetic superiority, as well as moved by his disappointment at not gaining Pnin's confidence. It is here that we begin to suspect our author's attitude toward his unfortunate character, and that suspicion flows backwards to color our impression of the entire novel. It is a remarkable technical feat. Then Nabokov visits the campus for a lecture and a personal confrontation with his victim. But Pnin flees, escaping on his birthday while Nabokov is busy with a decoy, Jack Cockerell, the false Pnin who "had acquired an unmistakable resemblance to the man he had now been mimicking for almost ten years." Surging up the hill, Pnin is "free at last"-free of his author. But Nabokov will neither retire his puppet to his box, nor let him go, a real live boy, on his earned escape. Pnin will re-appear briefly in Pale Fire, care- fully trimmed back to comic Russian, "fantastic pedant," stock figure trapped in an enormous burlesque. 208</page></plain_text>
