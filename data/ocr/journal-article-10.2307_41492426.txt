Paris : ADPF. 288 pp., XXIV planches , 71 figures. By Trevor W ATKINS. By the standards of most archaeological excava- tors, this volume follows remarkably closely on the seasons of fieldwork which it describes, and Alain Le Brun is to be congratulated on the production of this report. It follows the example of its predecessor in dealing with three seasons, and including various chapters of analysis and discussion of the excavated material. Typical of Alain Le Brun 's modesty is the refusal to claim authorship of the volume; as with the excavation itself, the book was put together un- der his direction and his is the major contribution. Having dealt in the first two chapters with the stratigraphy (co-authored with his wife) and the ra- diocarbon dates, Le Brun divides the rest of the book into two unequal parts : the first, and larger, part deals with the architectural remains (in which O. Daune - Le Brun again appears as co-author in one sub-section, and M. Molist has a sub-section on an experimental study of fire-installations); the second part deals with the archaeological material, both the artefactual and the floral and faunal remains. The vo- lume is completed by a short and valuable "Entracte" by Le Brun. In the interests of speed of publication, Le Brun has published such studies as were ready, and studies of the chipped stone, for example, or the human re- mains must await future volumes in the series. What is important in the short term, as Le Brun remarks in his introduction, is that there is much new material here, which has been made available as soon as pos- sible. What matters in the long term is that the publi- cation series exists, and that it adds up to a reasonably complete survey of the results; in this re- gard Le Brun is one of the archaeologists most likely to achieve that objective. Publication of material when it is ready is a good policy, but posterity may find it difficult to deal with the odd inclusion here of the study of the faunal remains from Le Brun 's other Cypriot excavation at Cap Andreas- Kastros. In the first part there are sections which discuss the walls which limited (or delimited) the settlement, the materials and techniques of construction, the structures themselves (in which each structure is briefly catalogued), their fittings and fixtures, the treatment of domestic and village space, and the hu- man burials. In the second part the archaeological material discussed consists of the stone vessels (C. Saliou) and anthropomorphic representation in stone (A. Le Brun). The floral and faunal material is dealt with in four more sections : S. J. M. Davis has writ- ten on "Some more animal remains from the acera- mic neolithic of Cyprus"; J. Desse and N. Desse-Berset have a contribution on the fish remains; J. Hansen contributes a preliminary report on the plant remains on the seasons 1980 to 1983 (note, not the seasons of excavation with which the rest of the report is concerned); and J. Renault-Miskovsky re- ports on a palynological study, which for the first time gives evidence which is not anthropogenic of the natural environment around Khirokitia. The earlier seasons had shown that the axial "road" of the old excavations by Porphyrios Dikaios was in fact a perimeter wall, which was latterly transcended by the expanding settlement. In the ex- cavations reported here, on the "inner" side of the wall, it is shown that the well known and massive wall was the latest in a series of barriers on that line; no phase in the settlement's stratigraphy is ear- lier than the first wall construction. When the long- established perimeter was abandoned as the settlement spread to the west, we know from Le Brun 's earlier excavations that another perimeter was constructed. Thus the settlement was physically se- gregated from the outside world throughout its life. The excavations reported here have produced much new and detailed information about the tech- niques and materials of construction, especially concerning the superstructure and roofing of houses and their doorways. In particular, structure 585 was found to contain detailed evidence of the nature of the roofing materials and their disposition. Khirokitia "tholoi" (that ill-chosen term which has proved so hard to lose) are now shown to have had flat roofs and to have looked like cylinders. How long will it take to insert into the collective archaeological me- mory Le Brun 's reconstruction in place of that so well-known artistic cut-away painting of a "bee- hive" in Piggotťs Dawn of Civilization , which has so pervaded popular imagination ? We shall need an equally striking and colourful image, I suspect. Le Brun 's careful documentation has also shown that doorways were common-place, even if their thres- holds were regularly half a metre or more above the floor. The pairs of strange pillars, which in Dikaios' time were a great rarity, are likewise shown to be fairly common, though their purpose and function re- main quite inscrutable despite Le Brun's close atten- tion to every detail which can be observed. Le Brun now has eight radio-carbon dates, six from the new excavations and two from the later area west of the wall, all assays carried out in Jacques Evin's Lyon laboratory. Le Brun's problem is that his series of dates spans a considerably greater range of time (roughly from 6000 to 4300 ВС) than the tight cluster of already published dates from the site. They are also quite out of synchronism with the stra- tified sequence. It is a problem strikingly similar to that faced by Ian Todd in regard to his radio-carbon dates from Kalavasos-7ewta. There being no evidence to suggest that the late dates might be associated with later re-occupation, and no reason to suppose that the samples or their laboratory treatment might be dubious, it seems to 103</page><page sequence="2">PALÉORIENT, vol 16/2 - 1990 me that the dates must be accepted, even if their lo- cation in secondary contexts means that they do not necessarily date the strata in which they were found. In the end (literally, in his final "Entracte") Le Brun expands the chronological horizons of Khirokitia's occupation to include the whole of the sixth millen- nium, but he refuses to accommodate the fifth mil- lennium dates. One of the peculiarities of Khirokitia (and per- haps one of the reasons why various archaeologists have seen the settlement as relatively short-lived) is the apparently unchanging nature of its material culture through time. Le Brun has now begun to por- tray something of the settlement's history in terms of its repeated re-walling and late expansion and re- definition by a new wall, and aspects of the archi- tectural development of house design and construction. C. Saliou has done something similar in terms of the stone vessels and the changing use of raw materials. There is a clear decrease in the use of soft (calcareous) stone through time, mirrored by an increase in the number of vessels made in the hard stones. Davis reports further changes through time in terms of the decrease in the importance of fallow deer in the faunal assemblage, as against the corresponding increase of ovi-caprids. At Cap An- dreas -Kastros, however, precisely the reverse ap- plies, with fallow deer becoming more and more important with time, as ovi-caprids decrease. No evi- dence is adduced as to the status, domesticated or wild, of either the ovi-caprids or the fallow deer, but the pigs are reported to be on the one hand smaller than mainland wild boars and on the other hand lar- ger than domesticated pig from ancient mainland sites. In the following chapter it is shown that large Mediterranean fish played a small but consistent part in the diet. The strangest faunal find maintains the Cypriot aceramic neolithic reputation for ambiguity, and comes from Cap Andreas-Kastros. Davis has identi- fied a single metacarpal of pygmy hippopotamus wi- thin that relatively small assemblage, but suspects that the piece may be fossil bone and the earliest evidence of an interest in palaeontology. Although this seems a fairly slim monograph, it is dense with information and detailed discussion. It needs careful reading, for the picture is often complex and not all the components of a particular aspect are to be found in one place. It is fully illus- trated and produced to commendably high standards. As Le Brun follows his publication of Cap Andreas- Kastros with the series on Khirokitia, he is making the major contribution to our ability to re-examine the Cypriot aceramic neolithic culture, which, I still contend, needs to be considered by anyone interested in the neolithic of Western Asia, simply because it is so strikingly different.</page></plain_text>
