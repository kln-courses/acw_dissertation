<plain_text><page sequence="1">309 EVOLUTION IN MAORI AiRT.-II. PENDANTS. By H. D. SKINNER. [WITH PLATES XIII-XVIII.] 1. THE MAORI HEI-rlIKI. MANY writers have put forward theories as to the purpose and meaning of the Maori hei-tiki. The great value placed on these neck pendants by native owners, the skill and industry required in their making, and the grotesque appearance of the finished article, unite to make them the most interesting of all Maori ornaments. As regards their artistic merit, one writer, Von den Steinen, considers the tikci CC perhaps the ugliest object the artistic genius of a people ever created by years of labour."l Plate XIII represents an exceptionally fine specimen. Its height is 51 inches, its maximum width 32- inches, and its thickness about 3 inch. Its head is inclined towards the right-that is, its right eye is higher than its left. The iris of each eye is represented by a ring of pana (haliotis) shell, the serrations in which probably represent eye-lashes. The nostrils are clearly marked, and the bridge of the nose is represented as in orthodox Maori carvings in wood. The huge mouth is shaped like a flattened heart, having teeth indicated medianly above and below, and one at each lateral corner. On the breast lies part of the long forked tongue, the upper end of which has lost all connection with the mouth. The artist in this, as in most cases, was apparently ignorant of the true nature of the forked tongue. Below and parallel with it he has added an inverted V, giving a ribbed appearance to the breast. The arms are akimbo and the legs are curved round in an extraordinary manner. There are, as is usual in Maori carving, three fingers to each hand and three toes to each foot. The navel is shown. The sex is female. The back of the tiki is polished and flat, except that the lower edge is bevelled. The head is perforated in the median line, and through the hole there passes a finely plaited flax cord terminating in loop and toggle. The toggle is of albatross wing-bone, and is ornamented at either end with short parallel straight lines, a method of ornamentation common to many districts of New Zealand. At some timie the tiki has been painted with kokowai (red paint). Plate XIV, which, by the courtesy of the authorities at the British Museum, I am allowed to reproduce from their Handbook to the Ethnographical Collection, represents specimens from the collection at the British Museum. 1 Karl von den Steinen, "Neuzeelandisches Heitiki und Nephritbeil," Archiv fur Anthropologie, Neue Folge, Band IX, Heft. 1 u. 2.</page><page sequence="2">310 H. D. SKINNER.-Evolution in Maori Art. Plate XV represents a group of fifteen tikis from the Otago district, once in the John White Collection. The Otago district is a region of high variability in all forms of Maori art, a variability which is reflected by this collection of tikis. I have to thank the Director of the Bristol Museumn, where they are now on exhibition, for permission to figure them. The inner meaning of the hei-tiki is not known, and it is doubtful whether it had one. Yate,' writing in 1835, makes the following statement regarding tikis: " They are by no means connected with any of their superstitions, nor are they, as has been imagined, representations of gods whom they might be supposed to worship. The latter idea was conceived from the hei-tiki being .taken off the neck, laid down in the presence of a few friends meeting together, and then wept or sung over. But this is only done to bring more vividly to the recollection of those present the person now dead to whom the hei-tiki belonged. It is kept and worn about the neck as a remiembrance of departed friends, not only of him who last departed, but in remembrance of others also by whom it has been worn." From this statement and from other considerations, it appears probable that the tiki had no religious significance, but that it gathered associations from the people and events with which it was connected. Hei is the generic name for neck ornaments. One of the meaniings of the word tiki is a carved figure. It is also the name of a Polynesian deity, the first man. That the former, and not the latter, is the meaning in the compound word hei-tiki is evident from the fact that whenever sex is indicated it is feminine. Mr. Best has the following passage on the subject:-" In Maori myth it is stated that the first hei-tiki was made for Hine-te-iwaiwa by her father. . . It is known to every old native that this pendant is properly worn by women only, and herein lies the story of its origin. It is highly probable that this curious figure represents the huinan foetus, or embryo, as, indeed, some old natives state, and the wearing of it by women is a survival of certain acts connected with phallic symbolism of long past centuries."2 There may, as Mr. Best., suggests, be some connection betweeni women and the ornamient. It is certainly much more often worn at the present titne by women than by men. But in Cook's time it would seem to have been observed on men only, for Banks says," The men often carry the distorted figure of a nman made of green talc."3 It should be remembered that Cook's plates show a proportion of the men wearing the tiki, as do other early writers. On the whole it would seem probable that the figure has no special religious significance. Individual specimens would accumulate mnana from the persons who wore them, the mana increasing with age and with the position of the succession of owners. fTikis that had in this way accumulated much mana would doubtless be produced at times of tribal crises, in case of sickness, or at the birth of a child, just as any other object possessed of mana might be produced.

SKINNER.-Evolution int Mlaori Art. 31 1 was more likely than any other ob*ject to accunmulate miana, and it is probably to this fact and to the skill required in their making that tikis as a class owe the veneration ill which they were held. In endeavouring to explain the disproportionate head and the bowed legs of the tiki, it has been asserted that the Maori artist intended it to represent the humnan- embryo,' and it is on this false assumlption that the iden-tification of the hei-tiki as a deity connected with birth is usually based. Karl vonl den Steinen has disproved the assumption, and has reached a conclusion arrived at indepen- dently by the present writer. This conclusion is that the disproportionate size of the head, the slant at which it is set, and the curved legs depend not on a realistic representation of the human embryo, but on the proportions of the greenstone adze. Banks, in his Journal,2 says, " They hang fronm their ears by strings very many different things-often a chisel and bodkin made of green talc." The small green- stone adze, probably because it was too heavy for suspension from tile ear, was worn about the neck. Plate XVI, 2, shows, on the left, a small greenstone adze intended solely for use, and on the right an adze intenided solely for ornament. The blunt edge of the latter and the thinness of the blade are proof of its ornamenital nature, quiite apart from the hole for suspension and the cord and tocrale. How the proportions of such an adze as this were imposed upon the humnan figure and produced tIme orthodox shape represented by Plate XIII will best be understood by a consideratioin of the early history of the human figure ornament in New Zealand, so far as it can be pieced together. On the walls of variotus rock-shelters in Canterbury and Otago are found numibers of paintings. Some are fragments of decorative patterns, some are realistic drawings of fish or of sea mammals, while there are a number of conventional representations of men. The rock drawings have not yet been systematically examined, though they will probably throw much light on the origins of Maori decorative art. Such traditional evidence as we have points to the great antiquity of most of them. The rock drawings as a whole show a remarkable resemblance to the examples of pictorial art reproduced in the Reports of the Cambridge University Antlhropological Expedition to the Torres Straits region. There are, however, some points of resemblance to the human figure, as portrayed in the Hervey Islands and elsewhere in Polynesia, so that the determination of outside relationships must await the production of further evidence. The drawings shown in Fig. 1 are from Hamilton,3 and are typical examples of the hunian figure from rock shelters in the Waitaki valley. In one the head is erect, while in the other it is entirely wanting. Compare with these the pendant shown in Fig. 2, a specimen of the greatest interest, in the Hocken Collection, I J.

SKINNER.-Evolution in Jaorz Art. 313 Its length is about 21 inches. It was founid in the Waitati valley.' 'In the Dominion Museum there is a specimen in slate of the same type, but degenerate, from the Southland district. Fig. 3 represents three still more degenerate examples, fronm the John White Collection in the Bristol Museum. Like the previous figures, they come from the Otago district. The special interest of the type lies in the light it throws on the ancestry of the hei-tiki. The line of subsequent development is clearly indicated by Plate XVI, 1, an interesting and beautiful specimen in the Eels Collection. The head is erect, as in one of the drawings of Fig. 1. The body and legs follow the treatment of Fig. 2, but the notched ornamentation on the arm of that pendant is here transferred to the edges. The perforation and the position of the arms are new. An extra- ordinary feature of this specimen, whiclh, however, has no bearing on the develop- ment we are following, is the tatuing, on shoulders and thighs. Of similar type is the small tiki on the left side, middle row, of Plate XIV. In this example the notched ornamentation has been lost, and there is no tatuing. The legs follow the primitive treatment of Fig. 1. It would seem to be at this point that the adze pendanit, an example of which has been already figured, and the human-figure pendant became associated, a union which produced the orthodox type of hei-tiki represented in Plate XIII. Such a pendant as Plate XVI, 2 (specimen to right), must have suggestecd itself at once to the tiki-maker as an admirable beginning for a hei-tiki. The polished back-surface was already finished, and the human figure could, without great trouble, be adapted to suit the outline of the adze. To preserve this outline it was necessary to bow the legs in along the cutting edge and to enlarge the head and place it aslant. Such an adaptation would probably be made without trouble, for Maori art was far more elastic and adaptable than many writers have supposed. Plate XVI, 3, is from Von den Steinen's paper, and shows clearly the relationi that exists between the two forms. The figure marked " a " is from Maori Art2 and shows how the adze shape inmposed bowed legs on the hei-tiki. The figure marked "b" indicates clearly how the square poll of the adze necessitated the slanting position of the head. A most interesting exanrple also illustrating this point is represented by Plate XVI, 6. This specimen has unfortunately lost its cutting-edge. It was originally a fine example of toki-pont-tangata or fighting adze, and the upper part is still ornamented with the characteristic notches called wvhakataratara. Its owner evidently decided to make from his toki-pou-tangata a hei-tiki, and an ordinary toki or adze. The unfinished result is highly interesting. Nos. 4 and 5, Plate XVI, show front and back views of another interesting specimen. In this case the reke or poll is curved and the eye has been brought further upwards to suit the outline. More labour has been expended on the sculpture of the back than is usually the case, though there are occasional I Locality on authority of J. Edge Partington, Ethn. Album of Pacific. 2 Plate 49, Fig. 3. Y2</page><page sequence="6">314 H. ]D. SKINNER.-EVolIti6o in Maori Aqrt. specimens in which the front carving is repeated on the back. Plate XVII, 1, represents another example in which the cutting-edge of the parent adze still exists. This example is from the Fels Collection, and, like Plate XVII, 2, is from the Otago district. A further orthodox feature inherited from the ancestral adze is exem- plified in Plate XVII, 3. It is the flatness of the lateral outlines. This flatness is present in a large proportion of specimens. It is absent in the archaic types, Plate XVI, 1, and Fig. 2, and in the specimen noted on the left of Plate XIV. Plate XV may be taken as representing an average collection of tikis. C3 is more primitive in character than any of the others. It is feminine, and has a rectangular flange for the perforation, a feature commoni in Otago. The cutting edge of the adze has influenced the legs of all specimens. B4 has been cut from an actual adze. B 1 follows the adze shape very closely. Flatness of lateral outline is especially noticeable in Al, A3, A5, B1, B4, C2, C4, and Co. The specimens figured indicate the close connection between the hei-toki (to coin a name) and the hei-tiki. Von den Steinen is wrong, however, in stating that every tiki was, at one stage in its manufacture, a toki or adze. This is true of a limited number of specimens only. Of the remainder about 25 per cent. have the outer curved edge of the legs acttially sharp. Of those that are left a proportion, of which that on Plate XIII is one, are bevelled towards this edge at the back. Often the curved edge is broken by two knobs representing the outermost of the three toes on each foot. Here we may examine parenthetically two other points of much interest in the evolution of the orthodox type. -Plate XVII, 5, represents a hei-tiki, many of the characteristics of which are archaic. Out of its mouth there projects a reptilian forked tongue.' As to the origin and meaning of this forked tongue we have no information whatever. There are specimens in which it passes out of the mouth and lies extended on the breast. By the time this stage was reached, the true significance of the tongue must have been lost to the carver, for it soon loses its connection with the mouth and lies detached like an inverted Y, Plate XV, 02. Plate XIII shows the detached tongue and an additional inverted V representing ribs. This latter appears to have been added by the artist under the impression that the detached tongue was intended to represent the neck and the two topmost ribs. In Plate XVII, 3, the tonigue has almost disappeared, and the ribs are clearly marked. In some examples, the tongue has disappeared entirely, the ribs having occupied more than its space. The second point is the concavity of back which may often be seen. It exists in the specimen figured on Plate XIII, but the illustration does not show it clearly. It is a feature transferred to the hei-tikis from the carvings of the human figure in wood. Enough has been already said to indicate the high probability that the 1 See also Plate X1V, top row middle, and Plate XV, A2, A4.</page><page sequence="7">H. D. SKINNER.-EvolutiMo in Maoia Art. 31 proportions of the typical hei-tiki are determinied by those of the greenstone adze. There renmain a number of tikis, perhaps 10 per cent. of which diverge markedly from that type. These would appear to be either archaic or eccentric. To this latter class belongs the well-known double-headed specimen on the right in the middle, Plate XIV. I cannot agree witlh Voni den Steinen, who says it is pathological,' or that its slhape depends on defect in material. It is clearly a hybrid resulting from the fusion of two ideas-m)?atan and tiki. The mat au, or fish- hook, is often executed in greenstone, and the influence of that motif can be easily detected in this specimen. Plate XVII, 4, from Von den Steinen, represents a specimen in the Berlinier Museum, which lie is probably right in regarding as a forgery. Its resemblance to Plate XVI, 6, is accidental. Von den Steinen is in error in stating that the hoiizontal is the normal position for the hei-tiki to hang in. The horizontal position was probably adopted only when the hole for suspension vertically was broken or had not been bored. Nothing can be said here about bone hei-tikis. Genuine ones are very rare, and depart far from the typical form. Forgeries, both good anld bad, are comilmlon in collections. From the facts already stated the following conclusions are drawn: (a) The disproportionate size of the head and its slantinog position, and the bowed legs of the Maori hei-tiki, characteristics which give it a superficial likeniess to the human einbryo, have not arisen from an attempt of the Miaori artist to portray an emlbryo. (b) Two elements have united to form the _Maori hei-tiki. The first was a conception of the human figure, which included a forked tongoue and an archedl back. w These characteristics it is hoped to examine at some future date. Upon this antecedently existing conception of the huiman figure there were imposed in New Zealand new proportions and characteristics. These new developmiients were determinied in their nature by the pro- portions of the second element-the pendanit adze. (c) The connection between the hei-tiki and the rites performed at birtlh, if such a connection did exist, were not essential, but onily secondary, depending' on acquiired mana. 2.-THE PENTDANT CA LLED " PEKA-P'EKA." Plate XVIII, 1, shows a good examiiple of this ornamnent, whichl is niot uncommon in collections. As in the case of other Maori pendants, little informa- tion has been collected from the lnatives as to its meaning. Somie years ago the writer was told by the late Augustus Hainilton that the two outward-facing figures were called the pigeons of Kupe. I do nlot know on what Maori authority this 1 Pathologisehes Eremplar.</page><page sequence="8">316 H. D. SKINNER.-EvolUtion in Mfaori Art. statement rests, but the identification of the two monsters as birds is interesting. They are apparently identical with the manaia figures so prominent in Maori carving, and there is imluch evidence to indicate that the mnanaia have a eommon ancestry with the bird figures from the Melanesian area. This point will be dealt with by Mr. Elsdon Best in his monograph on Maori pataka now in the press. It is initeresting to note that an ornament with a similar motif is found in the Melanesian area. Plate XVIII, 2, represents such a pendant from Southern New Guiniea or the Solomon Islands. We may regard the bird in the Melanesian design as the frigate bird, which occurs in endless variation in the art of that region. The peka-peka is confined to no one district of New Zealand. Examples in greenstone vary hardly at all in design, but when the more tractable material, bone, was used, the design, as in the case of other ornaments and weapons, became much more variable. Fig. 3 represents a specimen made from human parietal bone. This specimen comes from the north of Auckland. The two manaia figures are distinguishable at either end, while between them is a tangle of the curves and scrolls dear to the Maori artist. Fig. 4 represents a specimen in whalebone in the Hocken Collection at Dunedin. Though the locality is not specified it was probably collected from one of the Otago beaches. Plate XVIII, 5, represents a very beautiful unfinished specimen in the Ethno- logical Sectioni of the Cambridge University Museum. For the figure I am indebted to Baron von H-igel. The double perforationi for suspension may be noted. The inverted V between the figures represents the iwo arms of the rmanaias. In conclusion I figure a stone palette of the Egyptian prehistoric period, for which I have to thank Dr. Harrison, of the Horniman Museum. It represents two outward-facing birds. It is iliterestinig to note that in a similar specimen in the Manchester Museum, at Owens College, the iris of the eye is represented by a ring of bone or ivory. In the Maori specimens the iris is represented by a ring of pawa shell. Plate XVIII, 1 and 3, are from the admirable collection of Mr. Willi Fels. For pernmission to figure Fig. 2 I have to thank the Director of the Royal Scottish Museum, and for Fig. 4, Dr. Benham. 3.-EVOLUTION OF THE STRAIGHT EAR-DROP. Perhaps the commonest formn of ornament to be seen in collections of Maori artefacts is the long pencil-shaped greeinstone ear-drop, of which Fig. 1 is ani example. Fig. 2 represents characteristic, but somewhat shorter specimens. In proportions the type shows considerable variation, every length from 6 inches down to 1 being commnon, the diameter varying as the length. The material almost invariably utsed was greenstone, though specimens in bone are occasionally seen (Fig. 4). The following facts bear on the probable origin andl evoluLtion of this type. In all collections of any size there are nunerous examples of small chisels and gouges. Greenstone specimens are cominon, and are often beautifully finished. It</page><page sequence="9">H. D. SKINNER.-Evolution in Maori A rt. 317 should be noted that there are two distinct types of chisel, one being like a small adze and rectangular in cross-section, while the other has a cross-section which is circular. Specimens of both types are often seen with a hole bored near tlle poll for suspension from the ear or about the neck when not in use. Sometimes an 4.i~~~~I FIG. FIG 2 FIG.3. FIG. 4 PENDANT.

It is probable that the symmetrical orna- ment (Fig. 1) has descended from the greenstone chisel of the circular type, and</page><page sequence="10">318 H. D. SK1NNER.-Ev01Ntio1 in Maori Art. that the rectangular type uniderwent a process of degenieration wlich tended to converge on the same shape. Fig. 3 shows an example of the " circular " type, in which useful and ornamelntal functions appear to be evenly balanced. It is capable of being used in wood carving and also of being worn as aln ornament wheni not in use. Fig. 6 is ain example of the " rectangular" type in which the transition from useful to ornamental is complete. The genieral outlinie is retainied, but all the edges are rounded, and the cutting edge is too'blunt for use. In Fig. 7 the process has gone a step further, this speciineni being oval in cross-section. It retains a blunt cutting edge at the lower end, while the upper end is flattened, giving a hint of its rectangular ancestry. Fig. 8 is a splendid specinmen of symmetrical ornament in which the only hint of its ancestry is the blunt alnd conventional cutting edge at the lower extremity. From this form to the purely ornamental type of Fig. 1 is only the shortest step. When it has beeni taken the evolution of the symmnetrical oriiament is complete. 4.-EVOLUTION OF THE CRESCENT PENDANT. Fig. 1 represents a set of three whalebone pendants, generally called " mat- ornamiients," fronm Taranaki. They were worn suspended at the point where the woven flax mat was fastened on the shoulder. The carving about the middle represents a pair of hunman faces looking outward. The eyes are not represented, the lower jaw is absent, and the execution does not compare with that of similar carving, from the east coast. Apart fromi the carving, however, the set is a file one. This form of pendant appears to have evolved from the bonte needle, which, like all other light objects made from attractive material, was worn for ornanment when not actually in use. Fig. 4 shows three of these curved bone needles, also from Taranaki. They were used in the process of mat-making, for which in old times the Central Taranaki tribes were famiious. Fig. 5 is a curved needle made of greenstone, and from the same district. It is evidently designed equally for use and for ornament. Fig. 3 represents two nmuch larger needles of whalebone. The holes seem to have been burned through with a red-hot nail or a piece of metal. They are intended for use, though for exactly what purpose is not known. Fig. 2 shows a needle pendant intended solely for ornamient. The step from the type represented by Fig. 3 to this type is paralleled by the step from the graceful barbed bone point of a pigeon spear to a fat and clulmisy pendant copy which was found at Purakanui by Dr. R. Btuddle. The addition of the carving gives the mat-ornament of Fig. 1. An interesting variant form is exemplified bv Fig. 6, in the White Collection, found near Dunedin. This fine pendant is about 12 inches in length. Its most interesting feature is the bend, not very clearly shown in the figure, abo'ut 2 inches fromn the upper end. This kink divides the great curve of the needle into two</page><page sequence="11">04,~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ : &lt;0,t, _ &lt;l SX t r ITEI-TIKI: FRONT HEIITIKI BACK.

I do not know whether any of the intervening steps are represented in collections. The specimen figured is in the Hocken Collection at Dunedin, but I think it is of northern origin, and modern. Fig. 8 is like Fig. 6, but made of greenstone, a beautiful piece brought home by Captain Cook. I have seen a clumsy greenstone specimen from Taranaki, now at the Dominion Museum, and a tiny greenstone one from D'Urville Island found by Captain Bollins. Bone exanmples are rare. From the facts stated above, I thilnk we are justified in concluding that the crescent and its variant forii, the double crescent pendant, are, like the J-shaped and the straight types, native to New Zealand, and that none of them indicates foreign influence or origin. 5.-BROAD, SERRATED, BREAST PENDANT. FIG. 1.-HEART PENDANT OF STONE. Fig. 1 represents a type of breast pendant which is extremely rare in New Zealand. The writer has heard of an example in greenstone, biut has not seen another, nor has one ever before been figured. The Maori name is not known. The specimen figured is in the collection of Mr. Edric Williams, of Otane. It is made of a dense black stone and comes from the western shore of Tasman Bay, New Zealand. Its greatest breadth is 6 inches, the vertical measurement from smooth edge to bottom being about half an inch greater. Its greatest thickness is about three-quarters of an inch. The four holes along the top edge are designed to take</page><page sequence="19">H. D. SKINNER.-EVolUti0ol in A Maori Art. 321 the flax fibres of the string. The holes on either side were perhaps intended to hold tassels of feathers. This type of pendant is more widely spread in the Pacific than any other. Throughout Micronesia, Polynesia, and the Polynesian fringe of Melanesia, it varies little in shape and is generally executed in whalebone. In Melanesia it appears generally to be executed in pearl shell. In this area its ancestry can be clearly traced to a single valve of pearl shell worn as a pendant on the breast. In view of present controversies it is perhaps worth noting that such shells were worn as pectoral ornaments in ancient Egypt.' The example figured bears a remarkable resemblance to the Fijian variety of this type, a resemblance so striking that no student can fail to recognize their close connection. (or full details of speciments figured see CONTENTS.) I See J. Wilfred Jackson, " Geographical Distribution of the Use of Pearls and Pearl- shell,' Yone/ester lMemoirs, vol. 60, 1916, No. 12, p. 5.</page></plain_text>
