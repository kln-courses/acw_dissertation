<plain_text><page sequence="1">AESTHETIC EMOTION BY P. S. SASTRI The part played by emotion in the evolution of the rasas is of considerable importance. The emotional experience of ordinary life, however, is not exactly the same as that of the aesthetic. Yet James wrote ♦ " Aesthetic emotion, pure and simple , the pleasure given us by certain lines and masses, and combina- tions of colours and sounds, is an absolutely sensational expe- rience, an optical or auricular feeling that is primary, and not due to the repercussion backwards of other sensations elsewhere consecutively aroused. To this simple primary and immediate pleasure in certain pure sensations and harmonious combina- tions of them, there may, it is true, be added secondary pleasures, and in the practical enjoyment of works of art by the masses of mankind these secondary plêasures play a great part The primary feeling of beauty is, on this view, a pure incoming sensible quality. The secondary emotions too in their turn are composed of sensations. Out of these secondary emotions there arise u complex suggestiveness, the awakening of vistas of memory and association, and the stirring of our flesh with picturesque mystery and gloom"8. Our emotional reactions in spite of James refer not to sensations but to something else. The agreeable sensations, and the relatively pure colours and sounds, no doubt, arise from the poem. But they are not essential; for, our response to sensations is totally distinct from our response to works of art3. Yet Dr. Richards tells that " when we look at a picture, or read a poem, or listen to music, we are not doing something quite unlike what we were doing on our way to the gallery or when we dressed in the morning4 ". Between the poetic and the ordinary experiences there is no greater gulf " than that between the impulses which 1 Principles of Psychology, II. 468. « Ibid, II. 469-470. • See Roger Fry : " Some questions in Aesthetics "in 11 Transformations *' p. 3. 4 Principles, p. 16.</page><page sequence="2">Aesthetic Emotion 143 direct the pen and those which conduct the pipe of a man who is smoking and writing at once"1 As such he treats contemptuously the ideas of poetisation and transmutation2, and holds the aesthetic to be a phantom state. An emotional experience requires an object. This object might be a person or thing or even an idea. When it is an idea, the emotion is aroused at the bidding of imagination. Aesthetic emotion can be satisfied purely by the play of imagination. " Its embodiment in actual works of art only serves as an aid to emo- tional construction3 Aesthetic experience, like every other experience, involves an emotional excitement. All experiences to a certain extent are emotional; but the aesthetic experience differs from other experiences in the degree of the excitement it involves? and this degree or intensity is conditioned not by any impulse or instinct or sensation, but by a creative or unifying principle. It is aroused by a principle that is dissatisfied by the disorganised and unsystematised particulars. When we apprehend a work of art, the central feature of our experience is the imaginative awareness of the object. This awareness is no doubt influenced by the emotions in question; but it is not all, since the imaginative synthesis of the sensation and emotions is of the utmost importance. Hence does Coleridge observe that the " sense of more than musical delight is a gift of the imagination4 ". Emotions and sensations are the " gifts " which the imaginative apprehension of the object gives rise to. Dr. Richards ignores the imaginatively apprehended object and fastens his theory on the " gifts " alone. Such a false emphasis leads to a sort of subjectivism. Emotion and feeling are only states of mind involving the mental activity known as cognition or awareness of an object that exists outside of ourselves. This activity apprehends the object not as it is given in isolation, but as integrated into a system of objects. The awareness of this integrated object is the effect of the creative activity of the mind which creative activity 1 Ibid, p. 78. 2 Ibid, p. 79. 2 G. F. Stout : Analytic Psychology, II, 76, « Biographia Literaria.</page><page sequence="3">144 Ännals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute is imaginative. Thus besides the sensibility and understanding, we have a third factor called imagination. And the philosophical exploration of this region commenced with Kant, who was faced with the problem of justifying the conceptions of a natural Order, of a moral order, and of the compatibility between these two orders. The question of imagination crops up in the third problem. Imagination in its creative function produces a " charm of novelty 99 , a new world which cannot be oreated as long as we are at the mercy of " the film of familiarity and selfish solicitude The development of the demands of the contemplative life makes imagination issue forth in artistic creation. By overstepping the bounds of space, imagination attempts to explore the known and the unknown alike thus discovering the values of life that are out- side of us. In this process the mind " starts with some germinal apprehension of the unity of the world, sufficient to enable it, when occasion arises, to expect and seek for connections not yet disclosed1 99 . We perceive the world as a world of objects and the multiplicity is unified in imagination. While understanding or intelligence is busy in abstraction and classification, imagi- nation concerns itself with the apprehension of individual wholes. In this apprehension it takes into account only the unitary wholes that constitute the experiences, and not the usefulness of objects. Theoretical knowledge is limited only to understanding as operative within the perceptual field, whereas the whole cannot be known as a whole through reason but only in its parts which may be interrelated. The artist does not allow any experience to go alone or unrelated, for he finds a deep felt neöd to assimilate it into a wider pattern. That is, the experiencing individual refuses to maintain the gulf between the realm of the sensuous and that of the suprasensuous. Reason cannot bridge the gulf from the former to the latter; and yet the latter has a profound influence on life and also on the former. Hence says Kant, " there must after all be a ground of the unity of the supra-sensuous which lies at the root of Nature with that which the conception of Freedom practically contains8 This ground of unity is cognised 1 G. F. Stout : Manual of Psychology, pp. 437-438. $ Critique of Judgment.</page><page sequence="4">Aesthetic Emotion 145 neither in theory nor in practice. But since it alone brings out a transition between the two, its validity and existence should be recognised in terms of the active and creative aspects of the mind. The mind synthesises and effects an ordered unity in the multipli* city of the given. It grasps what is presented in sensation and works in it to arrive at a system of inter-related objects. Thus in human perception, says Kant, there are involved sensibility, ima- gination, and understanding. These factors transform the given in sensation into a world of objects. Space and time being forms of sensibility in the system of Kant, we become aware of the spatial and temporal orders through sensibility. But the mind apprehends this order creatively since sensibility is invariably accompanied by the other two factors. Thus on one side we have a mass of sensation?, and on the other a set of rules and concepts. But we apprehend particular objects as having sense qualities. That is, there is a principle which represents reason in the world of sense and sense in the sphere of reason. It is a principle which synthesises the parts into a whole, and which apprehends the interrelated system of Reality. This is imagination which is the source from which arise the other two. The creative imagination makes possible the apprehension of objects and of the sensory wholes. Thus in a poetic image we have a picture in words, and this picture is touched with some sensuous quality. It is a picture charged with emotion. As Coleridge put it, " Images, however beautiful ••• do not of themselves characterize the poet. They become proofs of original genius only as far as they are modified by a predominant passion-, or by associated thoughts or images awakened by that passion An image therefore becomes vivid by its relation to aü emotion; and the emotional tone conveys the intensit/ and freshness of the intuition. Consequently both ima- gination and emotion are very closely related. Imagination enables us to apprehend things in a wider context. Roger Fry tells us that " it is easier to abstract ourselves completely» and look upon the changing scene as whole. It then, at once, takes on the visionary quality, and we become true spectators, not selecting what we will see, but seeing everything equally, and thereby we come to notice a number of appearances and relations of appearances which would have escaped our notice 19 [ Annals, B. O. R. I. ]</page><page sequence="5">146 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research institute before This is the intense and disinterested contemplation of things known as imagination. It is a contemplation directed to understand things as in themselves they really are. Such an insight is necessary for the artist. Though we reject Alexander's conclusions, we can accept a distinction made by him between " passion as the source of the work of art and passion as entering into the work of art " 2 . A work of art is lyrical only when it is a lyric. And the work includes not only emotions but thoughts and fancies as well3. The emotions enter into the experience at an early stage, but an uncontrolled or unchecked emotion is best conducive to the final expression of a work of art . A9 Roger Fry says : " The need for responsive action hurries us along and prevents us from ever realizing fully what the emotion is that we feel, from co-ordinating it perfectly with other states. In short, the motives we actually experience are too close to us to enable us to feel them clearly. They are in a sense unintelligible. In the imainative life, on the contary, we can both feel the emotion and watch it "4. Imagination presents the emotion in bold relief, for it endea- vours at transforming the fleeting nature of the emotion into an enduring one. But amotion can become enduring only by losing its psychological and physiological aspects of excitement. This is achieved by the revival of the past experiences, images and ideas which revival is controlled by the demands of reason and by the needs of imaginative satisfaction. Emotion in the aesthetic state thus turns out to be a source of power to the artist. It is an experience where the artist has " that serene and blessed mood, In which the affections gently lead us on, - - Until, the breath of this corporeal frame And even the motion of our human blood Almost suspended, we are laid asleep In body, and become a living soul : 1 Vision and Design, pp. 19-20. 3 Art and the Material, p. 18. 2 Cf.

In other words, it is a mood which breathes a new vitality and a new spirit; into him. In this state the emotional tones of the various images are united systematically by imagination. This " imagination is put in action by the will and understanding, and retained under their irremissive, though gentle and unnoticed, control 8 Will and understanding are the factors that determine the imagination and control it in its activity. The emotion fixes the ideas. It associates and relates one idea to another by virtue of the revival of the past experiences. This revival is to some extent subsconscious. And the ideas that are revived appear as a unity with a dominant emotional tone. At times it is not the past alone that is revived; for the emotional mood sets the mind active and creative, so that the mind sets thinking in an anticipatory way the possible and the probable. With reference to this aspect does Shakespeare speak of it as giving to airy nothing " a local habitation and a name The emotion that is awakened to fulfil the demands of imagina^ tion cannot be merely painful, since it aids a satisfying imagina- tive experience. In ordinary life our emotions are at times painful enough. Thus mortality which is not a cheerful spectacle, is imaginatively apprehended in the aesthetic situation as involv- ing the feeling of value and harmony. It is viewed in a more universal back-ground. And tragedy, therefore, does not leave us crushed or rebellious.3 The tragic emotions of pity and fear become distinct from the corresponding emotions of ordinary life. In the work of the creative imagination there are involved memory, emotion, and reason. Memory preserves the essence of the past experiences and attempts at producing them in a certain sequence. It contributes the materials for the relation of one 1 Wordsworth : Tintem Abbey. * Coleridge : Biographia Literaria. 1 Cf. A. C* Bradley : Shakespeaiean Tragedy. I.</page><page sequence="7">148 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute image to another. Reason regulates the workings of emotion and memory. Imagination thus demands the active co-operation of the reader's mind. This is necessary because of the interpénétration of the images, words, meanings and the like. Dr. O. Wheeler approraches the truth when she says : " The fullest enjoyment of a poem is only possible when the images and their meanings, as well as the emotional tones accompanying them, blend and interpenetrate ( ii ) Imaignation refuses to encounter bare abstraction, since it is a priciple of unification. Some of the richest imaginative render- ings of the objects of perception are thus to be found in metaphors. The sensory elements presented to perception are integrated into the unity of the imagined object by creative imagination. The totality of the object is thus made and contemplated by imagination; and the poefc compels us to relive his experience by suggesting the inner nature of the objects. This inner nature is comprehened in metaphor. Here imagination is active in selecting the relevant factors and fusing them into one whole. Metaphor ( ' rüpaka y ) arises from the perception of similitudes leading to an identification or unity, by subsuming one object under another2. Thus it unifies and even identifies two objects, and " a goõd metaphor says Aristotle, u implies an intuitive perception of the similarity in dissimilars "3. Here two objects coalesce and unite destroying all equivalence between them. This unity presupposes the oraganic unity of mind and matter into one system of thought and reality. Stout, therefore, observes * 11 the metaphors which pass either from nature to man, or from man to nature, are without point and relevance if nature is regarded as mere matter, or man as mere mind "4. This integral relation of the objects to one anotoer leads to the comprehension through similarity and difference. 1 An Analysis of Literary Appreciation ( British Journal of Psychology, Vol. 13, Part 3, p. 238 ), a Natya Sastra: II. 325.

It groups objects together since it expresses an hitherto unperceived similarity bet- ween them. The apprehension of the relations between things obliges the pcet to be metaphorical. And since the universe is a coherent system of reality, we must accept that metaphor 3 provi- des us with a " partial intuition of the whole world " ' Here the unknown is mediated by the known. This n ediation is brou- ght forth by compressing the simile. The object that is to be com- pared is treated as non-different in certain respects from the object with which it is compared2. This is possible ouly when there is an intuitive perception of similarity between dissimilar enti- ties. This similarity should be real and genuine for then alone it affects the iniud suddenly. In this suddenness of the revelation, the image appears to be creative. In the metaphor, therefore, there is a great degree of emotional experience originating from imaginative apprehension. But when the emotion is very great, then the expression becomes hyperboli- cal giving rise to " Atisayokti " and " Atyukfci When the meta- phor answers an immediate necessity ( 4 prakrtopayogitva '), it áppearâ as the figure 4 Parinäma. " Thus metaphor smoothly brings about a variety of transitions in expression and in the understanding of the objects. However, the greatness of a poem does not depend on isolated images fashioned by metaphorical needs. Its greatness is deter- mined by the harmonious total impression which the various metaphors produce. Metaphors being images, we require the harmony of the various images. This harmony arises at the bidding of a predominant emotion or passion, or at the bidding of the thoughts awakened by that emotion. The emotions and the thoughts thus become significant only when the multitude is reduced to unity, or succession to an instant, or " when a human and intellectual life is transferred to them from the poet's own spirit " 3. This transference is the real function of the imagina- tion as penetrative and creative. 1 C. D. Lewis : The Poetic Image. 2 Sshitya Darpaça, p. 492. * Rüpakam rüpitaropad visaye nirapahnatve . Of.

Then the feelings and emotions of the past experience are intensely revived and assimilated to the immediate impression. Thereupon consciousness attempts st moulding the perceptual images. This is the basis of the inventive or creative imagination. The constructive imagination contemp- lates the object disinterestedly by removing it from the context of utility. Since ordinary perception lookg upon objects as utilities, the non-utilitarian cognition can be taken as one of the disting- uishing criteria of imagination. The artist apprehends an object emotionally and in so doing he views it as different from the object of normal perception. This difference is its specific nature which is apprehended by imagination alone. Imagination therefore transforms tie appa- rent nature of the object by focussing our attention on something that is vital to the object. The work of art is the expression of this imaginatively apprehended content. The content of art, because of the presence of the constructive imagination, is aesthetic. Hence we have to reject the contention of Mr. Fry, that in a true work of art we have both the aesthetic and the non- aesthetic element1. The doctrine of the 4 Significant Form 9 is committed to the untenable conclusion that the subject matter of art is non-aesthetic, because it fails to recognise the value and influence of imagination. When the content is equally significant to the aesthetic imagination, we have to find out the nature and value of the content which is imaginatively apprehended. Is it real or purely imaginary ? The purely imaginary is often spoken of as a fiction of the mind alone. For the imagination, it is said, there can be no distinction between the real and the unreal, and as such there arises no possibility of mistaking. It is neither true nor false. The images, says Plato, are 11 firstly shadows, secondly reflections in water and in things that are close grained and smooth and 1 Vision and Design, p. 295.</page><page sequence="10">Aesthetic Emotion 151 bright and all similar things " The artist paints for us a horse " which is a sort of dream created by man for those who are awake".2 This is taken by Plato to be a case of * eikasia9 which includes memory, sense and imagination. But 4 eikasia ' can be true if it emodies or apprehends a possibility that is in keeping with the nature of Reality. An analysis of the scientific and historical imagination helps us in solving this problem to a great extent. Prior to Harvey's discovery of the circulation of blood people thought that there is a symmetrical flow of blood either side of the body. This is a case of 4 pure imagination 9 in the sense that it failed to be proved and as such could not fit into the system of knowledge. But it is one of the incipient cases of imagination in the sense that it attempted to explain something in terms of the experienced facts. That is, scientific imagination is a power of suggesting plausible explanations, and its ideal is to hit the true explanation at the very first attempt. Then it is considered to be a case of intuiting the true explanation ; and the transition from imagination to know- ledge is consequently very slight. Thus we have the hypotheses that gradually become laws and formulas. Likewise the historical imagination illumines all the facts by weaving them into a close-knit pattern or thought. This pattern makes explicable the principles that run through the historical process, principles apprehended intuitively. The value of imagi- nation lies in getting into the heart of existence or reality. In other words, imagination has a supreme value not merely as anti- cipatory or reproductive, but as constructive and creative. In all its aspects it grapples with reality and presents reality in an intelligible way. However what the poet imaginatively appre- hends is generally taken to be real in the sense in which the objects of the empirical world exist. But the terms ' the real ' and * the imaginary 9 represent the distinctions that are valid only mithin the universe. That is, we cannot speak of the universe either as purely real or as purely imaginary. However there is a distinction between the two concepts. An imaginary shilling, for instance, is different from the real one in so far as the former does 1 Republio, 510a. 1 Sophist, 266c,</page><page sequence="11">iça Annals of the Bhandarkâr Oriental Research Institute not help us in a practical way. Ifc does not serve any utility. Apart from this difference it is the same as the real one. The absence of utility or practical efficacy thus seems to mark off the imaginary. But consider the case of fright arising from a hallucination which is purely imaginary. Here is a oase of imagination is- suing forth in a definite conative urge; and yet it is not real. Considered in this light the imaginary differs from the real not because of the absence of utility in the former but because of something else. Nor can we distinguish the two with reference to the experiencing individual; for the reality of a world is arrived at from the felt self. Whatever is felt is real, and the imaginary is no exception to this. The existence of a real world, as Bradley has shown, depends on a felt quality1. The difference between the imaginary and the real must therefore be sought not in their contents but in their internal character. In the real world we find a logical necessity operating. This necessity brings all its parts together and integrates them into a whole. But in imagination we generally do not apply the logical necessity and we are even willing to give it up. But if logical necessity and thought are given up, imagination loses all its vitality since in its creative and constructive functions it unifies a variety of objects. It is not employed by thought, nor does it reject thought. And just as the function of thought is to construct a system of reality that is apprehended, the function of imagina- tion is to construct a whole or a unity out of an apparent chaos. That is, imagination " is itself thinking proper " 8 And Bradley, therefore, observes " Mere imagination, where regulated logically, itself is inference. And again, so far as serving other ends and subjected to other kinds of control, it becomes and itself is contrivance, fancy and creation in various forms, intellectual, practical and aesthetic2 The special nature of the end and the apecial nature of the control constitute the differences between these forms, In imagination we have " thought acting freely4 #' i Essays on Truth and Reality, p. 47. a Ibid, p. 365. 3 Ibid. cf. pp. 371 ff. 4 Bosanquet : Meeting of Extremes in Contemporary Philosophy p. 37.</page><page sequence="12">Aesthetic Emotion i $ 3 It pursues its end and in so doing it u develops a world which qualifies the universe ' This is possible only when it is " controlled by the inherent laws belonging to those of the universe itself1 As such Bosanquet calls it " free constructive thinking2 An imaginative work, say a novel, represents a story in a way which the characters therein would have followed if they were real for actual experience. The imaginative representation keeps close to a possibility of its actuality. If there is to be any imagi- nativa enjoyment we have to accept the work of art as a just representation of human nature. Considered in the light of the influence they wield there can be no difference between the reality of a historical character like Napoleon andan imaginary chara» cter like Hamlet. ( iv) The emotion involved in an imaginative experiences gives rise to the most valuable experiences like the moral and the artistic. This emotion cannot be the result of a balance or equilibrium of the mind. The poet, says Dr. Richards, has a systematiged com- plex response while the ordinary man has only a welter of responses ; and " the great difference between the aitist or poet and the ordinary person is found in the range, delicacy and freedom of the connections he is able to make between the diffe- rent elements of his experience. " 3 But this is achieved through the activity of imagination, And imaginative activity is by no means a mere balance or iuter-animation of impulses. Otherwise in the absence of the imaginative activity, how can the poet build up this organisation ? And if there is the working of the imagination, the organisation is not merely neural. Take the " Lines written in dejection " by Shelley. These lines pulsate with the greatest anguish, with a most intense emotional and intellectual excitement experienced by the poet. But yet in a tragedy, Dr. Richards tells us, we have the impulse to approach ( = pity ) and the impulse to retreat ( = terror ) ; these two impul- ses are awakened at the same time and in equal force, and they are reconciled because they balance each other4. But the con- 1 Ibid. 2 Ibid. p. 40. 2 Principles, pp. 181-3. 4 Ibid, p. 245. 20 [ Annals, 6. Q» R, I. ]</page><page sequence="13">154 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute flict of these two impulses is not neural nor is it purely mechani- cal. It stirs our bodies and minds as well; we cannot afford to be complacent spectators of the tragic purgation of a character like Lear. Further in a valuable frame of mind, like the tragic, some impulses or desires are actually frustrated in spite of Dr. Richards; and the frustration of these is opposed to statisfaction which according to Dr. Richards lies in the fulfilment of a great many impulses without the thwarting of any. In spite of the frustra- tion, we are fascinated by Lear and we are drawn to him because of a supra-psychological principle involved in such great experi- ences. This principle is variously called creative imagination or aesthetic emotion. ( v) All works of art evoke a peculiar type of emotion which is distinct from that of the ordinary life. This peculiar emotion is said to arise from the apprehension of a ' significant form 9 by Clive Bell1; and we are told, that " to appreciate a work of art we need bring with us nothing from life, no knowledge of its ideas and affairs, no familiarity with its emotions "2. This view removes all connection, even an underground one, between Art and Life. Dr. Richards denies any such aesthetic emotion3. Each emotion, he argues, is not unique. It has something in common with other emotions. It is a psychosis and is therefore concretely different from every other psychosis. But there is a similarity between all psychoses. Aesthetic experiences ťt differ chiefly in the connections between their constituents, and they are only a further development, finer organisation of ordinary experiences"4. But all experiences are valuable in so far as they presuppose cr effect the stability and balance of the impulses. This balance, it is said, is only a response givtn to a stimulating object5; and there- fore there is nothing specifically aesthetic in the balance or organi- zation of the impulses. Since the aesthetic is only a phantom state, an experience similar to the one produced by a poem can be evoked 1 Art, p. 8. 2 Ibid, p. 25. 8 Principles of Liierary Criticism, p. 11. 4 Ibid, p. 16. ! Ibid, p. 248.</page><page sequence="14">Aesthetic Emotion 155 also by a drug. In the analysis of these two experiences it is enough for Richards if the critic of the drug comes forward to analyse poetic experience also with a knowledge of the impulses. No conscientious student of literature would admit such a gloomy spectacle. Let us examine the facts a little carefully. The work of art is beautiful. It is a complex unity expressive of a meaning which it embodies. The aesthetic object, says Mr. L, A. Reid, is " a complete fusion of meaning with physical form so that the meaning appears to be part of the form and the form part of the meaning By 4 physical ' he means physical as perceived, and by ' form he means the material of which the form is the form. We can cognise this fusion not by our senses alone, but by our minds. This he terms 4 imaginative perception, 9 which is the causal agency in affecting this fusion. But it is not the imagination alone that causes this fusion, since the physical object too is involed in it. Some of the forms of nature are suggestive of meaning and some are not; and "we know that When a painter * represents 9 nature, he selects, and modifies, producing a work which is more completely expressive than its natural model" 8. Complete fusion, therefore, appears when there is perfect expresson. And Beauty thus 4* is an indefinable quality belonging to perfect expression of meaning in material " s. It is the expressiveness of a content that determines the aesthetic nature; and this expressiveness is achieved by the imaginative percep* tion. In other words, even emotion is awakened to activity only when the penetrative imagination4 has begun its work. As this penetrative imagination proceeds to become creative, the emotion itself is kept within bounds. Thus the affective-volitional elements are incidental to imagination. But the material and the meaning are not two different entities. They are the aspects of the same integrated whole. The fusion of these two exists both in the aesthetic and in the non- aesthetic spheres. If so, the difference between the two must lie only in the presence and absence of the aesthetic nature« Analysing the example of ice * looking ' cold, Mr. Reid tells us 1 The Limits of Psychology in Aesthetics (Aristotelian Society, Supple- mentary Volume XI, p. 171 ). * Ibid, p. 172. » Ibid. 4 See Ruskin : Modern Painters,</page><page sequence="15">rj6 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute that " it is not an aesthetic, object, unless we can at best say that the physical object in its very forms really does ' express ' its meanings " ' We are told that it is not suggestibility or any other such feature, but expiessibility that makes a fusion aesthetic. But Mr. Reid forgets that expreesibility itself is the function of the creative imagination. The expressed content is what the imagination has apprehended. Mr. Reid, however, proceeds to tell us that our states become objectified in art, and " become related aesthetically to physical objeota and to a whole system of meanings outside us8 The contents of the subjective experience, on this view, are projected into the objective world; and these contents are comtemplated as objective because we become detached from them. This is the 1 psychical distance ' advocated by Mr. Edward Bullough as constituting the aesthetic nature of the object2. There is a clear gulf between the subjective state of emotion and the physical object. And no attempt is made to find out how and why the subjective state is transferred to the object. Nor is there any examination of the problem whether every state can be transferred to every object almost indiscriminately. (vi) There is a view known as the "Einfuehlung" ( = Imputation- Empathy ) theory advocated by Lotze, Vischer and Lipps. Empathy means that our activities tend to be merged with the qualities of the perceived object. The mental ideas are ť felf into ' the object. The aesthetic effect of an object depends on the nature of the object and 011 the ideas and objects it reminds us of. People and things become significant to us because they remind us of certain specific states of our own bodies and minds4. Into the inanimate nature man projects himself, and the artist projects us, by means of the intimate symbolism which in reality is only the relation of the image to an ulterior significance5. It is not only the subjective sensations that are projected but also our real 1 Aristotelian Society, Suppl.

This blending or fusion of the feelings of the individual with the object cannot be reduced to a principle of association, for it is not a conscious juxtaposition of associated representations. A mere association cannot produce new feelings unless it is enlivened by something else. Moreover the relation of the feeling to the object is neither accidental nor causal. The feeling is in our own minds. And Lipps argues that we project this feeling into an object which expresses our spiritual life, and this is possible only when the feeling lies in it.2 It is the aesthetic sympathy that enables us to apprehend the unity of our inner life and the material object. The unity animates or articulates the form and outline of the objects. The objects then appear transformed and humanised. But artistic sympathy fails to explain how and why we have a disinterested and detached contemplation of beauty. In the expe- rience proper our hearts are filled with joy and rapture; and when we apprehend a balanced, harmonious, and symmetrical form we are really happy in an aesthetic way. Here we have neither sympathy nor a projection of our feelings. Since the advocates of empathy lay too much stress on the motor element in perception and ignore the importance of imagination thinkers like Mr. Reid amend the doctrine by stating that we do not 4 feel into ' the object but ' think into ' it or 4 take it as3 ' Even otherwise, how can a feeling get into an object4. If music expresses a feeling, this feeling must appear in the object itself. It is not any feeling that a particular tune can and does exprêss, but only a specific one. A Bosanquet puts it, our feelings should be relevant to a perceived object5. Unless there is something in the very nature of ail object to evoke a particular feeling, the latter cannot emanate.

Hence the aesthetic emotion is distinct from the ordinary emotions in being enlivened and controlled by the creative or constructive imagination. Mrs. Helen Knight, however, argues that we transfer our mental states to the object : u In visual art the expression is fused with the form, as calmness with green when we perceive a calm green. The green is.not calm in aotual fact, but it is calm in our experi- ence1 Here is a fusion of a form with a meaning and we are told that aesthetic fusion is not different from that found in non-aesthetic experience2. This fusion is said to be analysable, and it becomes aesthetic by virtue of somthing else. In other words, objects are not aesthetic in themselves. The mind projects or imputes a meaning or value into them and thus they acquire an aesthetic nature. If the perfect work of art is a complete fusion of meaning with physical form, and if the meaning is not aesthetically separable from the perceived object, then meaning becomes a property of aesthetic objects. But if art is the expression of a meaning, since meaning emanates from the mind of the person expressing it, meaning cannot be a characteristic of the object. In the former alternative it is proved that all imputation is illogical ; and in the latter case, the object becomes dead to all imagination. Some objects are specially suggestive of meaning, and this suggestiveness is no other than beauty. This belongs to, is inhe- rent in, the objects and it gives rise to or suggests the meaning. And if aesthetic value is the result of a fusion of meaning with a physical form, mountains, rivers, clouds and the like cannot be suggestive of meanings. It is preposterous to conceive that an artist embodies meaning in these objects of nature. A beautiful landscape evokes emotions almost much in the same way as a poem or a picture. That is, natural objects too are aesthetic, and are suggestive of meanings without undergoing any fusion at the hand of the artist. 1 Aristotelian Sooiety, Suppl. Vol. XI. pi 187. 8 Ibid, p. 188«</page><page sequence="18">Aesthetic Emotion 159 What is the implication of this fusion ? The meaning of a work of art is said to exist in unity with its material. It is .not brought together with the work of art. That is, the work of art exists before the artist has made it and yet it ernodies his meaning. The meaning cannot be there before the artist expresses it. This is rather an unhappy conclusion to all theories that insist on the idea of violently forcing our mental states on the objects. Fusion and assimilation are too familiar in experience. The asso« oiated images in ( the snow looks cold ' are fused with the present visual experience. And what we apperceive comprehends what we actually sense. But the nature of the apperception depends upon the nature of the experience into which the object enters. The fusion, in so far as it is aesthetic, is determined by aesthetic satisfaction. That is, it comprehends only the relevant elements in the unity of experience. In the aesthetic experience we attend to an object directly, but images enter into our apprehension of the same. This apprehension starts with an impression felt by the individual. In the act of receiving these impressions will and intellect are suspended and the images pass rapidly before the mind. Then the individual becomes very attentive, selects some images and rejects others, and fuses these together into a unity. This unity thus has four features. First, it comprehends the past, the present, and the future, in such a vivid way that these temporal distinctions evaporate or slide into the present1. Next, it evokes interest and attention because it enables the events or images to move smoothly and fascinatiDgly. In the third place it comprehends or presents ideas that capture the imagination because they are striking and lofty2. Finally it is fully experienced directly and through words3. ( vii) An emotion is a feeling, and a feeling is inseparable from the object. The separation of a felt emotion from a melody heard makes the emotion formless and blank. It is the individuality of the music that constitutes the individuality of feeling. The feeling 1 Bhamab, III. 52: " Pratyaksä iva drsyante yatrartha bhütabhSvinah, " a Ibid, III. 53 : " Citrodättadbhutarthatvam, kathãySh svavlnïtatâ 8 Jbi4 : w SabdãnSkulatã ceti</page><page sequence="19">lío Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute resides in the melody heard. That is, unless the feeling gathers substance from ideas and objects, it is no feeling but a blank intensity. However, Clive Bell tells us that 4' the starting point for all systems of aesthetics must be the personal experience of a peculiar emotion1. Prof. Alexander speaks of it as the emotion that is proper to the constructive impulse though it is " raised to the level of contemplation2 The Freudians treat these emotions as sexual. And Dr. Richards remarks • " Introspective analysis has not convinced psychologists that the postulated emotion can be admitted. It is not otherwise known, has never been described and is much in need of identification3 But if introspection ever fails to explain the nature of this specific emotion, it will be because emotion as emotion is evanescent and dyanamic. In the introspective state we catcli the mind when it ceases to be emotionally dynamic. As such introspection is bound to fail in arriving at the aestheic emotion. But there are certain facts that help us in getting at it. Aesthetic emotion fastens on individual differences and the specific feelings the objeots evoke. These feelings are amenable to an introspective analysis only when fchey are intensely felt. An intense feeling strives after apprehending clearly the unity of a variety of parti- culars. Hence it is that the aesthetic emotion ignores repetitions by evoking and accepting novelty of idea or image. This novelty of idea or image is cognised by a principle that differs from emotions. The aesthetic emotion is only an event savouring of beauty. But imagination asserts beauty thus partaking of the nature of a judgment. That Is why it is quite possible to assert that an object is beautiful without feeling any emotion. The feeling that accompanies my judgment is irrelevant to my asser- tion because the former is interlinked with physical conditions. That is, while my judgment is determined directly by the object, my emotion may take the object as a bare stimulus. But it is undeniable that emotion, however feeble, is present in all imagina- tive apprehension. The artist starts with an emotional experience and the emotion gets itself transmuted into a work of art. But we have only a 1 Art, p. 53. 2 Art and Instinct, p. 22. a Foundations of Aesthetics, p. 56,</page><page sequence="20">Aesthetic Emotion 1 6 1 continuity of emotional experience in the act of composing a poem. It is not the same emotion that runs through it. In every creative act we have three distinct steps. For instance in the poetic composition we have the imagined idea, the idea consciou- sly drawn, and the completed poem. The. artist's emotional experience binds all these three together. This experience starti as an image which leads to the conscious analysis and working out, and it results finally in the actual poem. The image of the poet is accompanied by emotion ; and it is difficult to distinguish between the imaginative and emotional experiences. To put the same in a different way, the feeling or emotion evokes the poetic act by determining the character and direction of every stroke of the pen, only when it is enlivened by an imaginative process. The poet feels, and imagines; the feeling arises from an object which exhts either in the external world or in the mind. The object awakens an) aesthetic interest and reveals itself as an aesthetic object being charged v'ith the imaginative insight of the artist. This insight reveals the object as having, internal harmony, completeness, meaning and other features. The representation of such an object in the proper medium is the second function of imaginative apprehension. Hence we can say that the emotional experience lies behind the work of art. It is an experience which " moves him to design its communication in a work of art.1 " It is an experience about which he nowhere tells us anything ; for, it is that which impels him to do something else which is the work of art. He no doubt, tries to externalise his emotional experience in a medium. But the need for externalization comes only when the original experience is hazy and indistinct. Through this pro- cess he attempts at an understanding of the implications and mean- ings of the original experience. Such an understanding arises only when the personal and private experience is detached from him, In other words the artist feels and should feel that the experience is not his own. He can feel so when he assumes a critical attitude to the experience and examines it carefully, It is here that we find conscious selection. The artist gives the object or experience a certain unity through the activity of the mind. 1 L. Abercrombie : Towards a Theory of Art, p. 56. 21 [ Annals, B, O. R. I. )</page><page sequence="21">1 62 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute In other words, " there is something inherently intellectual in every' form of aesthetic expression. " 1 Thus starting with an emo- tional state, the artist assumes an intellectual tone to record the imaginative visions he had seen and felt. As Rainer puts it, " emotional expression is the ' spring ' and nat the 4 motive ' of artistic creation. " 2 This emotion functions as an essential dement in the imaginative activity and it is the truly aesthetic one. Imagination, therefore, provides the differentia for this specific emotion. And when Dr. Richards treats it as a phantom ktate, he is to be taken as rejecting any and every imagination. ( viii ) The innate tendency (' sthäyin 9 ) gets itself transformed when it enters the aesthetic experience. In this context it is powerfully affected by the poetic imagination and intensely refined. It thus gets shorn off of all the limitations which an individual might put on it. Freed from the personal limitations, it acquires a universal appeal and is no longer realised or apprehended as the tendency ( 4 sthãyin ' ) of some one else.3 Further, this mental tendency in the ordinary work-a-day world does not stop with itself, but gives rise to some other state of mind. One mental tendency leads to another and so on the process goes on in a continuous chain of sequence. But in the aesthetic experience, one mental state ( 4 sthãyin ' ) is unable to give place to another different from it' Consequently imagination, when it influences and affects the impulses and the emotions, altogether transforms their nature so profoundly that it is difficult to recognise their ordinary nature in the aestheic world. Thqre thus appears to be a graat and signifi- cant difference between the empirical and aesthetic state. " Aesthetic emotion says C. E. M. Joad, " is a mental process which accompanies the apprehension of beauty, as fear is a process which accompanies the apprehension of a tiger, or if it be held ï E. M. Bartlet : Determination of Aesthetic Minimum ( Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, Vol. XXXV, p. 131 ). ř The Field of Aesthetics ( Mind, Vol. 38, p. 181 ).

Where the common man fails to perceive beauty or meaning, there the insight or the vision helps ths artist. Thus the beauty that is latent in things is brought to birth through the medium of the artist; and in so doing the medium called the artist undergoes significant experiences that are embodied in a specific way. This way is described succinctly by the Indian aestheticiane under the 6 figure of speech ' called 4 Bhävika ' The expression of an imaginative vision is a whole whose parts are mutually helpful, a whole which is devoid of the redundant and which is guided by propriety8. The force or the sequence of the expression brings to light an underlying idea which is profound8. The expression thus becomes lucid ( ' prasäda ' ) and renders the hidden meaning explicitly ( * arthavyakti ' ). The essence of * bhävika * is to make the reader feel and imagine that which the poet has seen and felt. To this end his expression must be intensely passionate ( anãkulatã ) and the significance of the thing must be revealed suddenly4. Then alone can the thought of the poet be identified with that of the reader or the spectator. Pratlhãrendurãja treats ' bhävika ' as the very essence of all aesthetic experience, since imaginative sympathy alone provides us with a clue to it. We may be seeing an object for many days, which all of a sudden one fine morning appears beautiful. The object participates in the Idea of Beauty according to Plato. The aesthetic object then turns the eye of mind towards the world of being. But this vision 1 Aristotelian Society, Supplementary Volume, XI, pp. 209-210. 2 Dapdin, II. 365 41 Parasparopakaritvam sarvesam vastu parvaçtam, vise- saçãnãm vyarthänäm akriyã, sthãnavarnanã 3 Ibid, II. 366: " Vyaktir iikti krama balad gambhïrasyapi vastunab bhã- väyattam idám sarvam ". * Pratïbarenduraja on Udbhata, p. 79 : " Tatra vãcSm anakulata vyasta sambandha rahita loka prasiddba sabdopabandhanãt jhagity artha pratíti- kâritã</page><page sequence="23">íť&gt;4 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute of beauty cannot be retained for long. It is only experienced but not held fast. In a tranquil mood the artist recaptures the emo- tion which he felt when he had the vision of beauty; and he attempts to translate it in sound or stone or paint. This translated version is only a visible image which enables him to remember that which he cannot now apprehend directly. This visible image is a symbol of the inspired vision which he failed to retain. The reader or the spectator has for this image those feelings and emo- tions which the artist had for the original1, because the image is conveyed to us through ideas, clarity of thought, and intense emo- tion. This is the creative imagination or the 4 bhävanä vyãpãra 9 of Bhatta Näyaka, and it is at the back of all poetic creation and aesthetic experience. The idea ( bhäva ) of the poet is imaginatively ( bhävanä ) apprehended by the reader or listener. This creative imagination ( bhävanä ) comprehends the supra-sensuous ( ' atlndriyãrtha darsana * ) ; and it grasps th© inward life and meaning of the object2. The reader with the aid of imagination is able to see an object like a ' seer ' and comprehend it in all its variety, freshness, intensity, and completeness. This object therefore becomes aesthetic. The aesthetic object is that which we apprehend as a totality for its own sake. It is an object of interest which is disintere- stedly ( 4 tfitasthya ' ) apprehended. That is, the object is imagi- natively apprehended as a self-sutsistent unity, and no idea of utility enters into our attitudes and feelings. This aesthetic attitude lies in u the pleasant awareness presented to imagination or imaginative perception ' The awareness takes cognizance of the transcendental nature of the object. 4t lha lokottaränäm vastünäm sphutatayä tätasthyena ca pratlteh This clarity of the suprasensuous apprehension makes imagination the ' esemp- laste 7 power. i Pratlhärenduräja, P. 79 ff.

Prof. Alexander favours the latter pince the poet does not know his state of mind till he has said it. What he wants to say and how he shall say it are one and the same, and the poet is unaware of this due to the excitement which his subject has afforded him " The imaginative experience supposed to be in his mind does not exist there. What does exist is the subject-matter which detains him and fixes his thoughts and feeds his interest, giving a colour to his excitement which would be different with a different subject matter1 ". That is, imagination might be an incident in emotion. But in a great poem we do not have a mere graphic expression of emotion which is closer to ' rasokti '. Such an expression can at best create an emotional image ( 4 citta vrbti saihvãda ' ) in the mind of the reader. On the contrary we have an imaginative experience which involves an expression of emotion and an under- standing of the object ( 4 vastu samväda 7 ) as well8. In the words of Mr. D, G. James, therefore, " the aim of poetry is nevèr to create emotion, but to convey the imaginative idea of object3 ". Imagi- nation, as we have seen, has two functions : one awakens an understanding of the object, and the other arouses an emotion. The moment imagination is active, these two functions automati- cally come into existence and with them the need for expreesion too arises. Language has two functions : one is to indicate or describe objects, and the other is to give expression to one's experience, feelings and ideas. The latter function appears in Literature. Though the poeťs imagination too is focussed on the objects, still he expresses the object in the way in which he has apprehended it. The nature of this expression is to make us re-live or re-experience the same imaginatively. As Coleridge observed, we feel Shakespeare ťo be a poet in as muoh as for a time he has made us active crea- tive beings. This feature is comprehended by the two features of the imaginative or aesthetic expression called ' prasãda 9 and 4 arfchavyakti ' Of these the former is lucidity and it is co-exte- 1 Art and the Material, pp. II, 12. 2 Alamkara Sarvasva, p. 227. 8 Soeptioism and Poetry, p. 30. of.

The latter can best be explained in the words of Stout : " The tension of the stretched bow is no more taken to be itself akin to will or striving fchan the felt tension of the archer's hand as he pulls the string. Both are apprehended as secondary tendencies. So far as active tendency is ascribed to matter, it is always in this way derivative. If we drop all reference to an initiative analogous, however vaguely, remotely and mysteriously, to our own, the word 4 tendency ' as standing for something actual and positive loses all meaning. There is nothing left but the bare relations of coexistence and sequence which alone are discoverable in the content of sense-experience2 Though sense-experience can give us only very little, still the creative imagination makes explicit a world of meaning hidden in the universe. In reality imagination comprehends objects only as * vital It does not 4 put ' vitality into them. (ix) Imagination brings about order, wholeness, and unity into our experiences* If the artist were to be carried away by his emotions and conations, there will be no restraint and we shall have strong and vivid emotional reactions without any unity or order. It is the imaginative command of the emotions that effects order in the chaotic feelings and sensations. In the very act of experiencing the emotion, the artist struggles to " disintoxicate " himself from it by a certain quietness. This quietness is the result of ft an eminently clear consciousness of things in general and therefore, also, of that which is opposed to them, namely, one's own self "3. In other words, it is the imaginative apprehension of the emotions and feelings that distinguishes aesthetics from normal life, for, the imaginative act brings forth the depersonalisation of the artist. An object becomes aesthetic in virtue of its relation to imagination. Sensations too can become aesthetic only if they are charged with imagination. Thus the whole gamut of feelings, emotions, and sensations are charged with imagination in the aesthetic experience. 1 Dhvanyäloka, II. • G. F. Stout: Mind and Matter, p. 20. s Schopenhauer: On Genius, Translated by T. B. Saunders.</page><page sequence="26">Aesthetic Emotion 167 Dr. Richards speaks of the " finer organisation of ordinary experiences"1. But this finer organization itself is the " new and different kind of thing " which he denies. This organisation is not brought about by the emotions and impulses for the latter are in real need of being organised and systematised. The poet sees things as they really are, but each thing is organically related to the rest. Reality involves this relationship, and the apprehension of this relation is the basis of emotion. But this apprehension is impossible unless the poet is able to sympathise with his objects. This sympathy leads one to identify himself with the objects that appeal to him. That is, he refuses to impose any pattern or formula or feeling upon the objects, but tries to comprehend the pattern or formula or feeling that is in those very objects. This is the "negative capability" spoken of by Keats. This sympathy is liable to be interpreted in an ambiguous way. Thus Victor Bäsch argues that the beautiful really exists only in the contemplative mind at the time when it sympathetically attunes itself to the object. Bergson tells us that by means of this unique variety of sympathy the artist places himself within the interior of the object2. But since any emotion can become aesthetic in this way, there can be no specific feeling of beauty. That the judgment of aesthetic value is dependent on the object should not be lost sight of. But it is a valuation suited to the object and necessitated by it*. This sympathy therefore is an intensely disinterested one; and being disinterested and unificatory it restrains the emotional excitement. The sympathetic or imaginative emotion is unlike other emotions in having its intensity, vividness and overwhelming power transformed so well that it ceases to be personal. In ordinary perception there is very little emotion and it is purely subjective. But in aestheťic perception the psychical disturbance is felt in and attributed to the object : and the emotion is not "discharged" into the void. Moreover, the aesthetic emotion is an enduring pattern. If there is nothing like an aesthetic experience or emotion or object as distinct from the normal one, why should artists have i Principles, p. 16. ř Creative Evolution, p. 192. 1 See T.

Every art has its own medium and each such medium has a definite specific nature. Bosanquet writes : " The metal challenges you, coaxes you, as William Morris said of the molten glass, to do a particular kind of thing with it, where its tenacity and ductility make themselves felt. The clay, again, is delightful, I take it, to handle, to those who have a talent for it : but it is delightful of course in quite different manipulations from those of the wrought-iron. I suppose its facility of surface, how it leads itself to modelling or throwing on the wheel, must be its great charm. Now the decorative patterns which are carried out in one or the other may, of course, be suggested ab extra by a draughts- man But when you come to carry them out in the medium, then, if they are appropriate, or if you succeed in adapting them, they become each a special phase of the embodiment of your whole delight and interest of body-and-mind in handling the clay or metal or wood or molten glass. It is alive in your hands, and its life grows or rather magically springs into shapes which it, and you in it, seem to desire and feel inevitable. The feeling for the medium, the sense of what can rightly be done ip it only or better than in anything else, and the charm and fascination of doing it so - there, I take it, is the real clue to the fundamental question of aesthetics 'V This fundamental question demands the acceptance of ' bhävika ' or imagination as the vital principle of all aesthetic experience. s Bhävika' or imagination compels us to recognise that the aesthetic object is as much necessary as the feeling of the artist for the creative work. It is not the individual alone that can bring into existence a work of art. He stands in need of an object, and the object is the material counterpart of the total situation. The artist with his imaginative insight feels the latent possibilities in the object; and the poem is the outcome of the total unity of experience. As such when Mr. E. F. Carritt observes that beauty is the expression of emotion2, he is expressing only a partial truth since the beautiful is not purely mental. And we cannot also say with Collingwood that art is ' pure imagination 1 Three Lectures on Aesthetic, p. 58 ff. * Theory of Beauty, p. 296. • Speculum Mentis, p.: 61. cf, His Outlines of a Philosophy of Art: pp. 3, 19,</page><page sequence="28">Aesthetic Emotion 169 for imagination is taken by him to be almost the same as intuition; and pure intuition implies the representation of states of mind, passion, feeling, and personality1. Likewise when Alexander argues that i€ the imaginative artistic experience is generated in and through the expression itself "a, we find him identifying the passionate excitement with the finished work itself. But as the excitement which is an emotional state passes into an experience of the work of art, the excitement starts getting quietened. The aesthetic object is that object whose real nature, meaning, or value is felt imaginatively by the artist. This imaginative experience requires a sensuous medium, but it is itself not sensuous. As Leon observes, " the imagination is a kind of supra-sensual a priori sense, and beauty or the aesthetic object of the imagination is, as it were, a suprasensual sensum ''3 (x) The artist concentrates on what Binyon calls " the effective realization of an imaginative idea*". This realization excludes or rejects all those that do not contribute to the total effect. The distracting and the irrelevant elements have no place in it. Imagi- nation as constructive attempts at unifying the diverse . elements and presents a new and significant totality. Hence it is that Walter Pater said that Art " presents us with a kind of profoundly signi- ficant and animated instants, a mere gesture, a look, a smile perhaps some brief and wholly concrete moment - into which, however, all the motives, all the interests and effects of a long history have condensed themselves, and which seem to absorb past and future in an intense consciousness of the present This feature is compre- hended under " Bhàvika " or intuitive imagination by the older aestheticians of India when they said - " Pratyaksä iva dršyante yatrãrthã bhütabhävinah5 " This imagination functions as a unifying force.

This ťnd is:aitained when the the whole is represented; and in the representa- tion of the imagiñedobjects the mind assumes a critical attitude. Out of this attitude there arise aesthetic judgments relating to the internal harmony and unity of the whole. This poetic imagination ( 1 bhãvanã ' ) is the same as the power of the genius. It is a power " to find no contradiction in the union of the old and the new " 2 ; for, it involves the apprehension of the past or of the- future as the present.3 Imagination blossoms afresh and irradiates, the intellect and the objects as well.4 It synthesises the forms and contents, and gives a coherent shape to the manifold particulars. This imagination, we have seen, is a united whole of the object and the aesthetic emotion. And its nature becomes explicable when we understand the nature pf the emotion. Aesthetic emotion is always expressed, and expression here is an embodiment of emotion. But the emotion is a whole which includes both the sensuous and ideal elements. The expression of the emotion is the content that is felt : and feeling is evoked by a presentation. Each presentation evokes those emotions that are relevant to its nature ; and each emotion comes into existence with a specific content which is expressed. Hence "aesthetic emotion first arises in and is essentially constituted by, expression for expression's sake, or in other words, when its discharge takes the form of a positive production or action which has no purpose beyond that of tittering the content of our feeling".5 The emo- tion therefore, is idealised by expression and is objectively embodied. Otherwise an aešthethic emotion like fear would have to bring about the shock of personal terror, in which case the tragedy presented on the stage collapses in the middle. The object affects the nature of the emotion ; and with the help of the object the emotion dwells on the feeling and draws it out. That is, an emotion is aesthetic not merely because its • Stout : Analytic Psychology, II. 261-262. 2 Coleridge : Biographia Literaria, IV. 5 Bhamaha, III, 52. * Of.

Aesthetic emotion is an emotion that has undergone a change in adapting itself to its expression or in creating its expres- sion. The change lies in its becoming objective ; for, the emotion is felt in the presented objects which are highly individualised and are united to the mind. This unification is the specific con- tribution of imagination. "I am certain of nothing, " said Keats, " but of the holiness of the heart's affections and the truth of imagination The poet directs us to what he has imaginatively apprejiended in the objects. His intenser sympathy or insight elicits from the objects their meaning and value. The meaning is not put into them, but is cognised and experienced by the poet. It is thus that the poet widens " the sphere of human sensibility, for the delight, honour and benefit of human nature." 1 The poet is a genius and the power of genius lies in "the introduction of a new element into the intellectual universe...., ..It is an advance or a conquest made by the soul of the poet ".2 This new element is imbedded in the very nature of the objects and the poet apprehends it not with his sensibility, nor with his understanding, but with his imagination. It is "a" new insight which brings us nearer to the truth of things ''3 Let us analyse a poem which will help us here. When we hear or read a poem like the one describing the deer pursued by Dusyantag " Grivábhañgabhiramam muhur anupatati syandane baddhadrstih Pascãrdhena pravistah sarapatanabhayãd bhüyasä pürvakäyam darbhair ardhävalidhaih šramavivrtamukha bhram- sibhih klrpavartmä pasyodagraplutatväd viyati bahutaram stokám urvyâm prayãti, 4 1 Wcrdsworth : Preface to Lyrical Ballads. « Ibid. • A.

As we apprehend the meaning of the words and sentences, there is evoked a direct image or vision in the mind. This vision embodies the succession of images and ideas that the poem represents or reveals1. We appre- hend the antelope. In this apprehension, which is not practical, the activity of the mind is self-contained and selt-compiete. That is, the fear that is overtaking the antelope is distinct from the ordinary emotion of fear. This fear is aesthetic by virtue of the absence of any relation to the conative aspect1. It does not refer to anything outside itself. It is appreheneded directly and without any difficulty. It seems to enter the heart as it were and transform us by moving us deeply and intensely. This is the ' bhayänaka rasa ' or the state of fear which makes the self seek a refuge in itself. In such an endeavour we identify ourselves completely with the antelope. We do not make any distinction between our- selves and the tender animal. This is technically known as universalization ( ' sàdhãranl karana ' ) which can not be limited or restricted in any way*. Here we have a widening of the self through the widening of sympathy; and sympathy is experienced through imagination which, therefore, is a fundamental principle in artistic creation and aesthetic experience as well. Bhaftanãyaka therefore enunciates three essential functions that enter into the poetic experience. " Abhidhä, bhävanä cänyä, tad bhogikftir eva ca; Abhidhã dhämatäm yate sabdârthàlarhkrtï tatah Bhävanä bhãvya eso pi srngãrãdi gano hi yat, Tad bhogl kfta rüpeija vyäpyate siddbimän narah " +. Words have meanings and these meanings constitute their primary denotations. When they surrender their meanings, the poetic imagination ( ' bhävanä ' ) colours them profoundly and welds them into a new unity. As Bharata tells us, the aesthetic state itself is 1 ,, ... ...

The poem embodies the aesthetic state, and words and their meaning in a poem find their fulfilment only in evoking the aesthetic experience. This aesthetic experience is brought forth by the activity of the instincts and the emotions. That is, the instincts and emotions have the latent capacity to develop into the aesthetic state only when some new element sets them in motion. This new element is imagination2 which enables us to experience consciously that which is suggested as experienced by some one else. Such an immediate experience is that found in the aesthetic state'. What is imagination ? It is an aspect of the immediate expe- rience. It is that principle which gives us an insight into the nature of Reality. Uttuůgodaya observes. " Bhãvanà näma manaso vyäpära äsvädanädi paryãyas carvanety ãha4 It is a function of the mind, a function that is synonymous with apprehension. But this apprehension is totally distinct from ordinary apprehensions. Consequently it is disinterested and it excludes the practical and volitional aspects of human nature. And yet it is of supreme importance to human life. The poetic experience we have noticed, is a whole of three essential parts. They are meaning ( ' abhidhä ' ), imagination ( ' bhävanä ' ), and apprehension of unity ( ' bhoglkaraga ' ). The first refers to words. The second is imagination which is indispen- sable to the aesthetic state. The third refers to the experience of the reader or spectator'. If the words alone are enough to constitute poetic experience, one should have such experiences from going through scientific works as well.

That is, the words in poetry are distinct from the words in other works in so far as the former alone are charged with imagination2. And imagination is the supreme unifying principle. " Tac caitad bhävakatvam nãma rasãn prati yat kävyasya tadvibhãvãdlnãm sãdhãranatvã pãdanam nãma3 The various elements that go to make up the poem are organised by imagination to form a unified whole. This shaping spirit of imagination enables us to experience immediately and directly the poetic idea. Such experience is naturally distinct from memory and other forms of mediate experience. Imagination, therefore, cannot be identified with the images, figures of speech and other embellishments. And when Abhinava- gupta writes. " Bhãvakatvam api samucita gunãlamkãra pari- grahãtmakam asmäbhir èva vitatya vaksyate,4 he is mistaking ' bhävakatva ' or imagination to be the same as embellishing. On the contrary that universalising and unifying principle ( s sädhäranikarana ' ) which he admits is the same as Bhattanäyaka's 4 bhãvanã # ( imagination ). As Jagannätha puts it " bhävanopanltah sädhäranätma ratyãdih sthãyl rasai"5. The unification and universalization are revealed through the activity of the creative and contemplative imagination. Such an imagination is in no way different from Abhinavagupta ' pratlya- mãnatva 1 pratili or ( carvanã '. The aesthetic experience ( ' pratlti or ' carvanä ' ) involves the individual who is the medium that reveals imagination, and the field of- objects over which it operates succinctly and successfully. The physical object is distinct from the aesthetic. The former is extended in space outside, while the latter is in the mind of the artist and of the spectator. There is no doubt an element of identity between the two, but they do differ. Thus for instance a woman might convey a variety of meanings like wife, sister, and mother. But in the aesthetic sphere a woman evokes a specific 1 " Tatrãbhidhã bhãgo yadi suddhah syät, tat tanträdibhyah sastra nyäye- bhyah slesädy alamkäränäm ko bhedah?

Moreover the objcct that is outside is subject to time and may cease to exist after some time. But the aesthetic object being mental or spiritual, is not temporal, and not spatial even ; and as such it continues to exist,1 This difference is due to the nature of the object appre- hended differently in the two spheres. In the aesthetic sphere it is imagination that fastens on the real nature of the object that is concealed from the gross mind and senses. It is enabled to appre- hend thus because it has no ulterior motive and reference. 'In. the ordinary apprehension, our desires and volitions do not allow us to look into the inner life of the object and to contemplate it. Thus Imagination is the activity of the mind and the soul. The soul feels something which answers to its nature. It has before it something which delights it, and which makes it desire the realisation of that which delights it. This something is an intellecual content accompanied by emotion. This content represents the possibility of the soul's development. Such a conent assumes varied forms. Thus it may appear as the ideal union of two souls as in love ( ' srngära ' ), or as the harmony of feeling and will as in virtue ( ' vira ' ), or as the perfection of sympathetic experience of the human values as in pathos ( 1 karuna ' ), or as the systématisation of the moral and intellectual elements as in truth ( 4 santa ' ). The function of poetry is the formation, development, and expression of such a content. This content is transformed by imagination. Whatever influence it has over the individual, it is produced through imagination. And imagination, said Shelley, is " the great instrument of moral good"2. When the moral doctrines are winnowed by imagination, they enter the world as mighty facts of life. An intense and comprehensive imagination in itself transforms the nature of the individual so well that there can be no higher satisfying morality outside the activity of imagination. It is a morality that intuits a comprehensive view of reality and /eels it imaginatively. In such a feeling we have the " the abiding satisfaction of an abid- ing self 1 Bhagav&amp;d bhakti rasayana, p. 26.
