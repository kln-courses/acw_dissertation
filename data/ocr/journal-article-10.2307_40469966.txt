<plain_text><page sequence="1">AN ACTION-BASED THEORY OF PERSUASION IN MARKETING G. Ray Funkhouser Ft. Washington, PA Richard Parker Rowan University This paper advances a theory of persuasion in marketing based on behavioral (rather than attitudinal) change. It considers fundamental conceptual issues, comparisons with other theories of persuasion, potential for marketing applications, and suggestions for future research. INTRODUCTION There is a vast literature on the topic of persuasion (cf. a review by O'Keefe 1990). However, the bulk of it has treated persuasion as a means to attitude or opinion change (e.g., Hovland, Janis &amp; Kelley 1953; Petty, Unnava &amp; Strathman 1991). Yet "practical persuaders" such as salespeople, con artists, lawyers, street hustlers, and spoiled children concentrate not on changing attitudes, but on getting other people to do what they want them to do. The ultimate goal of most marketing activity, including commercial advertising, is also to precipitate action (i.e., a purchase), although attitude change can sometimes be a means to that end (McGuire 1969a). Scholars have long questioned the utility of using attitudes to predict or account for behavior (e.g. McGuire 1969b; Fishbein 1973; Bonfield 1978), and one recent review concludes flatly that "there has been little support for the relationship between attitudes and behavior" (Reardon 1991). Nevertheless, much research on "persuasion" continues to follow the path first established by Hovland and his colleagues, who were admittedly interested in opinion change concerning social issues, rather than in specific behavioral actions. Early multiattribute models, such as those of Rosenberg (1956) and Fishbein (1967) which followed the Hovland tradition, were extensively applied to consumer behavior (Wilkie &amp; Pessemier 1973), suggesting that the assumption of equivalence between consumer decision processes and changes in attitude or opinion regarding social issues was either widely accepted or widely overlooked for many years. Some of these models have since been modified to address conditions under which attitude change is related to behavioral change (see below), but attitudes remain the central focus. This paper will present an alternative approach to understanding the persuasion process, focused on action rather than attitude change. The Action Theory of Persuasion (ATP) appears to apply to all persuasion - from mass media advertising and propaganda, to interpersonal exchanges between salesperson and prospect, lawyer and jury, parent and child, etc. Unfortunately, space constraints will permit only a brief outline of a lengthy topic. The nature of the theory, its assumptions, and selected classical and contemporary sources will be considered, but detailed discussion, examples, practical applications and so forth, which might aid understanding, Summer 1999 27</page><page sequence="2">must regrettably be minimized. Although the ATP bears a family resemblance to other theories (e.g. Ajzen &amp; Fishbein 1980), its central focus on precipitating (or preventing) behavioral change is intended to provoke renewed discussion of basic principles of persuasion as applied to marketing practice. The ATP begins with the view that ultimately, persuasion is an attempt by one party, Persuader, to influence the actions of some other party, Actor. This view is reasonably congruent with common usage of the term, "persuasion," as defined in the Random House Dictionary: "winning a person over to a certain course of action." A key assumption of the ATP is that every action is preceded by a decision to act. As Parsons and Shils (1951) put it, before there is action "a decision must always be made (explicitly or implicitly, consciously or unconsciously)." The objective of preventing unwanted actions is often more easily accomplished than promoting desired actions, for two reasons: (1) persuasion not to do something is not always easily detected; and (2) people often do not want to have to make decisions to take action in the first place. According to the ATP, persuasion is a matter of Persuader's engineering Actor's decisions to produce the desired action. This is entirely a process of information management. Clearly, an analysis of the pre-action decision process is essential to formulating a theory of persuasion. THE ACTION DECISION SEQUENCE An important component of the ATP is the Action Decision Sequence, which draws upon several approaches to human decision-making. (Discussion of these approaches will be abbreviated due to space constraints, and because it is expected that many readers will already be familiar with them.) The problem-solving approach assumes that people proceed through a series of steps aimed at satisfying a need, relieving tension or otherwise solving some problem of which Actor is aware. In the context of consumer behavior, Engel and his associates (cf. Engel, Black-well &amp; Miniard 1995) formulated a comprehensive model, based on Dewey's problem-solving sequence of five stages: (1) problem recognition, (2) search for information. (3) evaluation of outcomes, (4) choice and (5) outcome. This model comprises many psychological, social, cultural and environmental influences that might affect a consumer's decision. Janis and Mann (1977) also described decision-making as problem- solving, although they stressed that the natural tendency of most people, at most times, is to resist having to make a decision at all. Both models would apply to a situation in which Actor is making a decision that involves high commitment and risk. Neither would be at its best if applied to a low-involvement decision, such as how much sugar to put into a cup of coffee, or whether to have one's eggs over easy or sunny side up. 28 Journal of Marketing THEORY AND PRACTICE Two early, comprehensive stimulus-response models were proposed to account for the process by which consumers choose among different brands in a given product category (Nicosia 1966; Howard and Sheth 1969). Both described the decision process, provided for the consumer's history of experience that is relevant to the decision, and set the stage for the decision. However, both were limited to brand-choice behavior. Neither truly applied to behavior (not even consumer behavior) in general. Multiattribute models of attitudes, evaluation and preference are represented by an extensive body of literature. The bulk of this work has been concerned with models of the "expectancy- value" form, whereby Actor's attitude toward an object is assumed to be a sum of perceptions of different attributes of the object, each perception represented by the product of the value the individual places on that attribute and his estimate of achieving that value from that object. For example, the version originally proposed by Fishbein (1967) was: Ao= %, B¡a¡ (1) where Ao is the attitude toward some object "o;" B¡ is belief i about o, that is, the probability that o is related to some other object, x; a¡ is the evaluative aspect of B¡, that is, the respondent's attitude toward x¡; and n is the number of beliefs. Rosenberg's earlier version (1956) differed only slightly, with "value importance" in place of "evaluative aspect" and "perceived instrumentality" in place of "belief i about o." Both models (which flowed directly from the work of Hovland) were limited to attitudes toward objects, with no specific actions implied. A later version proposed by Fishbein (1973) - the "extended Fishbein" - incorporated situational norms and motivation to comply with them. Fishbein eventually attempted to reconcile attitude and behavior in his "theory of reasoned action" (Ajzen &amp; Fishbein 1980), but that conception has been faulted for application to an extremely limited subset of behavioral possibilities. For example, "whenever the performance of some action requires knowledge, skills, re- sources, or others' cooperation, or necessitates overcoming environmental obstacles, the conditions of the [Fishbein] model cannot be met" (Sheppard, Hartwick &amp; Warshaw 1988). A more fundamental difficulty of this approach is its focus on self-reported behavioral intention, which can be an unreliable predictor of ultimate behavior, and may not even be independent of measures of attitude. One otherwise supportive review of the Fishbein approach (O'Keefe 1990) concedes these limitations and also concludes that "the theory of reasoned action does not adequately capture the role of normative influences." These limitations do not appear to be surmountable within the context and assumptions of the model.</page><page sequence="3">FIGURE 1 THE ACTION DECISION SEQUENCE: A sequence of steps for a decision to take a specific action at a specific moment STEPl: Does a need for action exist?

Behavioral scientists accomplished translations of this model to other areas of behavior besides economic decision making, including multiattribute choice and preference behavior (Etter 1975). The field-theory models of Gestalt psychologists, particularly Lewin (1951), held that behavior is determined by forces impinging on a person at the moment of decision. These forces comprise every factor in an individual's life space and are constantly in flux, the result being that for every person life is a continual stream of conflict resolutions. This approach was first applied to consumer behavior by Kassarjian (1973), who criticized other approaches such as decision theory and stimulus-response theories as being limited in their accounts of human behavior by virtue of their leaving out such influences as values, beliefs, aspirations and group pressures. As theories such as these gained prominence in consumer research, authors began to question whether decision-making is always an appropriate consideration in analyzing consumer behavior. Kassarjian (1978) suggested early on that much consumer behavior does not involve a prepurchase decision process. Olshavsky and Granbois (1979) reviewed the literature and concluded that "a significant proportion of purchases may not be preceded by a decision process ... not even on the first purchase." A subsequent stream of research demonstrated that low-involvement purchasing often utilizes simpler heuristics (cf. Bettman, Johnson &amp; Payne 1991). The Action Decision Sequence does not contradict these streams of theory. Rather, its intended contribution is an integration of them. One result of this integration is that it incorporates the dynamics of the persuasion process in ways that preceding models are unable to. The view of Parsons and Shils, and the Gestalt psychologists, that people constantly are resolving conflicts and making decisions to act, does not necessarily mean that elaborate, conscious problem-solving exercises will precede each and every action that a person may take. Six steps, diagrammed in Figure I, appear to account for any specific action that a person might choose to undertake. We will define a specific action as: Actor, undertakes ^precise action (A), at ^precise time (TJ. If Actor undertakes a variant of a ~ for example, A' -- or undertakes A at a different time, Ta, that would be viewed as being a different action and as having resulted from a different action decision. This model covers both simple ("no decision") actions such as the pur- chase of a container of salt and more complicated decisions such as the choice of a career or a residence. Thus it appears to speak to both the more elaborate choice models and their critics. Application of this sequence to the Olshavsky and Granbois set of "non-decisions" reveals that each in fact involves decisions, though not of the sort covered by the models that these authors criticized. The six steps are: Step 1: ~ Does a need for action exist? First, in response to some stimulus, Actor must decide whether there is a need to take action. This may be a "rational need," a capricious need, a need dictated by the situation, a physiologically-provoked need, etc. If Actor decides that action is needed, he proceeds to Step 2. Otherwise, no action is taken (the actual choice made for the vast majority of the myriad stimuli that constantly reach human sensory organs). Step 2: - Is there any choice of action to be taken? If Actor decides that more than one alternative is available, he proceeds to Step 3. If no choice is perceived, he proceeds to Step 6. The decision as to whether there is any choice, is (as are all decisions in the sequence) entirely subjective. Actor may not be aware of other choices. Alternatives that would be acceptable to other people may be untenable to Actor. In fact, for virtually every action there are many choices, although people often do not recognize or consider them. Step 3: - Will an habitual course of action suffice? If one will, Actor proceeds to Step 6. However, Actor may have no Summer 1999 29</page><page sequence="4">habitual action appropriate to the situation at that time. He may have a need for novelty or variety. Any of several possibilities may dictate a progression to either Step 4 or Step 5. Step 4: ~ Reduction of alternative courses of action to a "consideration set. " If an habitual course of action will not suffice, and if there are numerous alternative courses of action apparent to Actor, the next step in the sequence may be a matter of reducing a relatively large number of possibilities to a smaller, more manageable set which Actor would seriously consider. This step in the sequence corresponds to Steps 2 and 3 in the Engel et al model (1995) -search for information and evaluation of alternatives. Step 5 - Choice of preferred course of action. From the "consideration set," Actor chooses the course of action that appears to be most attractive at the time. This choice would be Actor's "behavioral intention." Step 6 - Decision to take the indicated course of action. This step is by no means automatic, as the epigram "Many a slip twixt the cup and the lip" will attest. If Actor decides not to take the indicated course of action, he may return to any of the previous steps in the sequence (he may return from any step to a previous step), until the sequence is resolved, either by taking some course of action or by deciding that no action is needed. The Action Decision Sequence accommodates other models of decision-making. It parallels the Engel (1995) model, which also extends from problem recognition ("need for action") to the decision and beyond to the outcome ofthat decision. The seven ideal procedural steps stated by Janis and Mann (1977) amount to a finely detailed discussion of Steps 4 and 5 in the Action Decision Sequence. The Howard-Sheth (1969) and Nicosia (1966) models addressing brand choice begin with the assumption that choice is available and then proceed to cover Steps 3 through 6 comprehensively. The multiattribute models and decision theory generally apply best to Step 5 in the se- quence ~ selection of a preferred choice from a limited set of alternatives. Various other refinements to the major conceptual schemes are also consistent with the conception advanced here. For example, Tversky (1972) proposed a sequential process, "elimination by aspects," which serves the purpose of narrowing a set of alternatives to a preferred choice. Park (1978) suggested a "Sequential Conflict Resolution Model" of two stages: "satisficing plus," which narrows possible alternatives to a limited set; and evaluation on relative preference dimensions to arrive at a final choice. These two stages correspond to Steps 4 and 5, respectively, in the Action Decision Sequence. Similarly, the "prospect theory" of Kahneman and Tversky (1979) saw choices in two phases: an early phase of editing and a subsequent phase of evaluation. 30 Journal of Marketing THEORY AND PRACTICE Thus the Action Decision Sequence is consistent with traditional conceptions of human decision-making. Like many other models, it treats decision-making as a sequence of events, not a single event. However, it differs from some other models in several respects: (1) It is not restricted to any particular area of behavior but rather applies to the decisions preceding any, action; (2) It provides a more complete sequence of steps, of which most other models address only a few; (3) Through its return loops it provides a mechanism for a number of decision-related behaviors, such as procrastination and indecisiveness. The Choice Evaluation Array If every action taken is the result of a sequence of decisions made according to the Action Decision Sequence, a mechanism for evaluating the choices at each step is necessary if we are to understand the process more fully. The model proposed here is an instrumentality model (Ryan &amp; Bonfield 1975). It is based on a traditional, hedonistic theory of motivation, whereby people seek to "maximize pleasure and minimize pain." In addition, it incorporates values that are salient to the choice situation. Let us say, for the sake of terminology, that in evaluating alternatives for the steps in the Action Decision Sequence, the alternative selected is the one perceived by Actor to have the greatest Relative Attractiveness (RA) at the time the decision is made. Relative Attractiveness is a function of motivators (M), or positive incentives, and demotivators (D), or negative incentives, so that: RA=/(M)-/(E» (3) Motivators, in turn, comprise potential rewards (R) and positive (or prescriptive) values (VP). Demotivators comprise potential penalties (P) and negative (or proscriptive) values (VN). While some form of rewards and penalties are common in discussions of motivation, the inclusion of positive and negative values ~ that is, rules for behavior ~ is less often observed. Yet it is a statement of the obvious to note that much behavior is governed by "what is right" and "what is wrong," according to sets of values such as the Boy Scout Law, the Ten Commandments or commonly accepted instrumental and terminal values (Rokeach 1973). Campbell (1975), in his Presidential Address to the American Psychological Association, complained that psychologists have tended to neglect the role of values in directing human behavior, and that situation appears to have changed surprisingly little in the ensuing quarter century. "Rewards" in this context are the answers to Actor's question: What do I have to gain if I make this particular choice? "Penalties" are the answers to the question: What do I have to lose? "Positive values" answer the question: What indicates that this is the right choice to make? And "negative values"</page><page sequence="5">answer Actor's question: What indicates that this is the wrong choice to make? A multiattribute instrumentality structure is necessary to complete the Choice Evaluation Array, as shown in Figure 2. This structure is analogous in form to these proposed by other authors (e.g. Ajzen &amp; Fishbein 1980), but different in several crucial aspects: (1) Values are included equally and similarly to rewards and penalties; (2) The Choice Evaluation Array focuses on evaluation of the choice or the action itself, rather than on the attributes of objects or attitudes; and (3) Positive and negative outcomes are treated separately, rather than as opposite poles of unidimensional scales. FIGURE 2 CHOICE EVALUATION ARRAY: The criteria by which choices are monadically weighted for acceptance or rejection at each step in the Action Decision Sequence.

Similarly, each value being considered is weighed as to: how important it is to Actor; and how salient it is to the choice being evaluated. The model as presented is compensatory in form; however, it would apply as well to choice situations identifiable as lexicographic, disjunctive, etc. (Bettman et al 1991). The Choice Evaluation Array assumes: (1) Irrespective of the objective situation, all rewards, penalties and values, and their respective importances, probabilities and saliences, are perceptions of Actor. As such: they are entirely subjective; and they are in constant flux. (2) Alternative choices of action are ultimately judged monadically, not comparatively. That is, the final choice is "Shall I do A or shall I not do A?" (not "Shall I do A or shall I do B?"). As these are entirely subjective estimates of future consequences of contemplated choices, there is a nearly limitless array of rewards and penalties that may impinge on any given decision, including the following types: (a) Product benefits or deficits; (b) Personal satisfactions or dissatisfactions; (c) Social rewards or penalties; (d) Interpersonal rewards or penalties; (e) Economic rewards or penalties; or (f) Situational rewards or penalties (including either product usage situations or the decision situation itself). Figure 3 illustrates some of the rewards and penalties that might be considered as Actor ponders whether or not to buy a certain new car, from a particular salesperson, at a specific time. Of course, not all, or even very many of these rewards and penalties may be salient at any given mo- ment. It is important to note that for most actors, in most situations, the elements of the array are more or less unstable. That is, a reward that was important at one moment may not be at the next. It may seem more probable at one time than another. It may not even pertain at one moment, while it might loom large a little later. Even the nature of a reward or penalty may subtly shift, for example, from "owning a fast car" one instant to "owning a fun car" the next. This may seem a small distinction, but it might be crucial to a salesperson whose product is demonstrably less fast than a competitor's, but plausibly more "fiin." Rewards and penalties are treated separately in this model to reflect the realities of choice situations, which results in a less tidy model than some others. It is a tradeoff between applied and theoretical parsimony, justified by the following considerations: 1. Not all variables that might constitute rewards or penalties are bipolar in nature. For example price, amount of food, length of a movie, and number of candies in a package, all vary from zero to infinity on their respective metrics, rather than from one extreme to another.

The inclusion of both poles of bipolar variables may be inappropriate in some situations. For example, it is a rare buyer who would consider "safety" to be a potential reward when evaluating a particular car. However, an "unsafe" car constitutes a very important potential penalty, as the manufacturers of certain cars which have attracted unfavorable publicity can attest. 3. Actor's reactions to different levels of a variable may be non-linear. Consider "amount of food" as a variable that influences choice of a meal from a restaurant menu. The potential reward will be "just the right amount of food." Both "too much food" and "too little food" may be potential penalties. 4. Actors' reactions to opposite poles of a scale may be qualitatively different. Winning and losing are certainly op- posite poles of the same dimension, by definition. Yet as both game theorists and sports enthusiasts know, "playing to win" dictates quite a different strategy in just about any game from "playing not to lose." Just as a wide variety of potential rewards and penalties may be considered for any specific choice in Actor's Choice Evaluation Array, for any specific step in the Action Decision Sequence, for any specific action, so may a variety of prescriptive and proscriptive values. Figure 4 suggests values that might be salient at the time a car purchase decision is being made, including examples of personal, economic, interpersonal, and group or social values.

After all, there may be as many as six separate decisions to be made, each of them involving at least two and possibly several alternatives, each oí those involving its own array of rewards, penalties and values, all subject to change from time to time. It is perhaps for this reason that people tend not to welcome taking action or making decisions. Janis and Mann (1977) went so far as to characterize man as "the reluctant decision maker," noting that often the effort of making decisions is reduced by such strategies as "satisficing" or "elimination by aspects." Other possibilities for reducing complexity include developing habitual patterns of behavior, living according to strict sets of values, or adopting a rigid outlook on life. As we will see, the complexity of decision making plays a role in persuasion tactics. Game theory defines uncertainty as a decision-making condition in which "some or all of the objective probabilities of possible outcomes are unknown or even undefined" (Harsanyi 1977). In this regard, the Choice Evaluation Array involves Actor's estimates of probabilities of future rewards and penalties. (Furthermore, in virtually any decision-making situation, not all potential rewards and potential penalties are known to Actor.) One important aspect of uncertainty relates to the probability of successful performance of an intended action. In this regard, "there seems to be no provision in the [Fishbein] model for considering either the probability of failing to achieve one's goals or the consequences of such failure" (Sheppard et al 1988). By contrast, the ATP provides for Actor's perception of the possibility of unsuccessful performance of a behavioral intention (e.g. to stop smoking) as a source of potential penalties (e.g. loss of self-confidence) offsetting any potential benefits. THE PERSUASION PROCESS With a working model of the decision-making process established, we are now in a position to explore the process of persuasion. According to the ATP: Persuasion is entirely a matter of information management and processing, aimed at influencing the outcomes of decisions made by Actor in his Action Decision Sequence. Accordingly, let us bring another party into the discussion, Persuader. Persuasion is viewed as a dynamic process involving three flows of information: (1) Status Information, flowing from Actor to Persuader; (2) Persuasive Messages, flowing from Persuader to Actor; and (3) Feedback, flowing from Actor to Persuader. We might call this process "selling." However, a more appropriate model of many persuasion situations would be that of "negotiating" or "bargaining," wherein each party tries to influence the other's decision making and thus has the roles of both Actor and Persuader simultaneously. Bauer (1964) suggested that this two-way model may apply to more persuasion situations than many realize. Thus just as the prospect is weighing the importances, probabilities and saliences of various rewards, penalties and values related to the act of purchase, the salesperson is doing the same with regard to his actions in trying to persuade the prospect to make the purchase decision. While the salesperson may see the commission from the sale as a potential reward, he also may be aware that too "high- pressure" tactics may alienate the prospect and occasion the potential penalty of losing the sale. Definitions of the terms above are: Status information is any information available to Persuader that provides knowledge of Actor's Action Decision Sequence or Choice Evaluation Arrays. Persuasive Messages are any information (verbal or nonverbal) transmitted by Persuader with the intention of affecting Actor's decisions. A message may be directed at any decision being considered at any step in the Action Decision Sequence. Of course, messages may be transmitted accidentally or inadvertently that may affect someone's Action Decision Sequence; but without intention it seems inappropriate to consider them as "persuasion." Feedback is any information available to Persuader that provides knowledge of the effects that persuasive messages have had on Actor. Persuader may use feedback to alter messages or approach. Persuasion Tactics It follows from the Action Decision Sequence and the Choice Evaluation Array that there are actually only a limited number of different types of persuasion tactics available to Persuader in designing persuasive messages (although, needless to say, the content of potential messages is infinite). The ten basic persuasion tactics may be grouped into two types. (a) Attempts to change the Relative Attractiveness of choices. (1) Increase or decrease the importances of Actor's rewards, penalties or values associated with the decision ("Costs only pennies per day" is an attempt to decrease the importance of a potential price penalty); (2) Increase or decrease Actor's perceived probabilities of rewards or penalties resulting or not resulting from the decision ("Try it, you'll like it" is an attempt to increase Actor's estimate of the probability of a good experience resulting from the choice to try it); (3) Increase or decrease Actor's perceived saliences of values to the decision ("Buy American" is an at-tempt to make the value of patriotism more salient to a purchase); Summer 1999 33</page><page sequence="8">(4) Introduce new rewards, penalties or values in Actor's Choice Evaluation Array; (5) Modify the natures of the rewards, penalties or values in Actor's Choice Evaluation Array; (Note: tactics derived from most theories of persuasion and attitude change typically are variations on the above five.) (b) Attempts to manipulate the decision process itself. (6) Provoke Actor's thinking by introducing stimuli that will activate the Action Decision Sequence in a desired direction. For example, attractive display windows were one of F. W. Woolworth's innovations that helped build his nationwide chain of "Five and Ten Cent Stores." He found that openly displayed goods, priced low, could bring customers into his stores and entice them to buy items they did not really "need" (Boorstin 1974), (7) Shift the decision from one step in the Action Decision Sequence to another (once a prospect has made a choice ~ Step 5 - a good salesperson will immediately stop trying to sell him the item and will con- centrate on getting him to sign the contract - Step 6); (8) Modify the nature of the decision that is being considered. Book clubs, for instance, early on discovered that they could sell many more books if, rather than letting members decide whether or not to order a book, they required them to refuse the current month's selection (a retailing tactic called "negative checkoff). Marketers may also try to convert a low- involvement decision into a high- involvement decision (cf. Parker and Churchill 1986); (9) Increase or decrease the complexity of the decision for Actor (a good salesperson will try to make things as simple as possible, and conversely, a good way to forestall an unwanted decision is to try to make it as complicated as possible); ( 1 0) Increase or decrease Actor's uncertainty, on the same grounds as tactic 9. Lutz (1975) proposed tactics similar to (1), (2), and (4) above, based on the Fishbein model. Tversky and Kahneman (1974) suggested similar tactics. 34 Journal of Marketing THEORY AND PRACTICE Effectiveness Variables Of course, Persuader's messages are only attempts, more or less effective in influencing Actor's decisions. The ef- fectiveness of persuasive messages has received considerable attention from communication, attitude, and advertising researchers. A vast body of literature in those disciplines provides evidence that the effectiveness of a given message can be expressed as a function of several types of variables. Content variables would include such aspects of a persuasive message as the selection of the specific rewards, penalties, and values for the decision that is being considered, as well as the tactics employed in designing the message. Presentation variables are elements of themessage that comprise its form and appearance, including design, layout, choice of color, quality of illustration, typeface, use of humor, background music, length or size, media placement, and so forth. Channel variables are contributions to the effectiveness of the channel or medium through which the message is presented. For example, a product whose use involves motion might be better advertised on television than on radio or in print. Source vari- ables are characteristics of the source of the message, as perceived by Actor. Source variables have long been exten- sively studied (e.g. McGuire 1973; Petty et al 1991 ) and include: credibility, expertise, sincerity, attractiveness, likeability, authority, control over rewards and penalties, social status, similarity to Actor, legitimacy, popularity or celebrity, etc. Audience variables are aspects of Actor that influence reception of, and reaction to, a message. These include intrinsic attributes such as intelligence, education, experience, cultural background, interests, and personality. Also among "audience variables" would be Actor's behavior toward a message, including exposure to it, attention to it, etc. Actor's "persuasion knowledge" and coping abilities (Freistad and Wright 1994) would also come into play. Logical variables are elements of a message that correspond to Actor's cognitive structure and thought processes. These could include such variables as syllogistic consistency, language and semantics, and cognitive and affective structures. Clearly, the better that the logic of a persuasive message corresponds to Actor's logic, the more effective it is likely to be, simply because it will be better comprehended. Financial variables are not necessarily directly related to persuasion, but they do relate to resources available and, all else being equal, the more resources available for conducting a persuasion attempt, the better a chance it has of being effective. Resources allow Per- suader to use personal contact instead of media advertisements, hire better artists or copywriters, purchase better media exposure, etc. The foregoing brief treatment is not intended to minimize the effort devoted by legions of researchers over many years to the study of variables that comprise the effectiveness aspect of persuasion. However, in the context of exploring the process</page><page sequence="9">and the mechanisms of persuasion, "effectiveness variables" play a supporting, not a central role. A good persuasive message can be enhanced or undermined by any or all of the effectiveness variables mentioned here, plus many others. But "effectiveness variables" by themselves cannot persuade. The most credible source in the world will have little effect on Actor until he attempts to persuade him to do something. Persuasion Situations It may be helpful, in both understanding how the ATP fits with existing notions of persuasion and understanding its potential for practical application, to analyze common persuasion situations. Two useful ways of classifying these situations are based on (1) specificity of the persuasion objective, and (2) key communication variables. (1) Specificity of the Persuasion Objective. The discussion to this point has treated persuasion as it applies to persuading a specific Actor to decide to undertake a specific act at a specific time. However, many persuasion situations are not nearly so specific: a message may be aimed at a specific individual ("precise"), at a small, relatively homogeneous population (a "narrow frame"), a large heterogeneous population ("broad frame") or at an unspecified population. Similarly, both the action that is the objective of the persuasive attempt, and the time at which the action is to be taken, also can be classified as "precise," "narrow frame," "broad frame," and "unspecified." Figure 5 shows a spectrum of persuasion situations based on degree of specificity of these three dimensions. This spectrum is anchored at the "precise" end by the situation depicted in the 1973 movie "The Sting," which starred Robert Redford and Paul Newman as two depression-era con men who perpetrate a major con on a racketeer. Their Actor was "precise," the intended action was "precise" (betting a half-million dollars on a "fixed race"), and the time of the action was "precise" (the exact moment when everything was arranged for the "sting"). In fact, this example may go beyond mere "persuasion," since an entire reality had to be fabricated to support the racketeer's decision to take that action at that instant. The other extreme of the spectrum (completely unspecified objectives) is represented by the situation described in Hyman and Sheatsley's classic paper, "Some Reasons Why Information Campaigns Fail" (1947). A study was conducted to determine public knowledge of certain political issues. The results were disappointing, in that no particular audience impact was found. However, the public information campaign had no specified objectives. That is, no one in particular, was supposed to perform any action in particular, at any time in particular. Between these two extremes, persuasion situations can be arrayed according to the specificity with which objectives are conceived, in terms of the actor, the action and the time of the action. For example, an insurance salesperson trying to get a prospect to sign a contract for a policy has a precise actor, a precise action and a precise time. By contrast, a brand advertisement for, say, a particular laundry detergent, is addressing a broad frame of actors (all prospective buyers of detergent, of whom it is hoped that the ad will persuade a significant fraction), a precise action ("buy our brand") and a broad frame of time ("some time in the future, hopefully soon"). FIGURE 5 SPECTRUM OF PERSUASION SITUATIONS BASED ON SPECIFICITY OF OBJECTIVES Actor Acton Time "The Sting" Precise Precise Precise Personal Precise Precise/ Precise/ Selling (e.g. Narrow Frame Narrow car, insurance) Frame Mail order Broad Frame Precise Narrow advertisement Frame Advertisement Broad Precise Precise for one-time Frame event (e.g. sale, concert) Point of sale Broad Frame Precise Precise display Brand Broad Frame Broad Frame Broad Frame/ advertising Unspecified Corporate Broad Broad Frame Broad Frame/ public Frame/ Unspecified relations Unspecified "Information Unspecified Unspecified Unspecified Campaigns" (Hyman &amp; Sheatsley It is clear from Figure 5 that people generally regarded as being "persuasive" - con artists, salespeople, lawyers, etc. - tend to practice their art in situations involving relatively specific targets and objectives. On the other hand, much of the academic literature addressing persuasion in the contexts of public opinion and marketing has emphasized situations that involve much less specific objectives ~ brand advertising and political propaganda. Further, these bodies of literature have predominantly focused on attitude change (implying a "broad frame" of behavior, at best), rather than on specific actions. This is one basis of the limitations of some of these lines of research, for, as Fishbein (1967) pointed out early on, "the size of the correlation between a behavioral intention and behavior is determined largely by the specificity of the behavioral intention being considered." Summer 1999 35</page><page sequence="10">2. Key Communication Variables. The other analysis that is useful in gaining a perspective on the ATP is shown in Figure 6. Persuasion situations are categorized as to type of audience (individual, group and mass), and communication channel (face-to-face or mediated) (McGuire 1969a; Schramm 1961). The different types of audience are important in persuasion, in that they determine the precision with which Persuader can shape appeals. If the audience is an individual, it is possible to concentrate precisely on those appeals and approaches to which that person is most likely to respond. If the audience is a group, Persuader will be more limited, having to rely on appeals and approaches common to most or all of the group and consistent with group norms and constraints. If one is directing a message to a mass audience there is less latitude yet. Persuader is addressing a heterogeneous aggregate of indi- viduals who represent a variety of personalities, predispositions, backgrounds, etc., and response becomes a stochastic process. As Bauer (1963) pointed out, mass communication "given a very large audience, varies in its im- pact. It affects some one way, some in the opposite and some not at all." In this regard, Bonfield (1978) noted a fallacy with the way multiattribute models are sometimes applied, under the assumption (usually implicit) that all consumers have the same reactions to a given set of attributes. FIGURE 6 TYPOLOGY OF PERSUASION SITUATIONS ON KEY COMMUNICATION VARIABLES Channel Audience Face-to-Face Mediated Individual One-on-one person Personally written selling letter from sales- person to prospect Group Tupperware party Written proposal to purchasing committee Mass Auctioneer Advertising(all forms) Circus barker Virtually all empirical research on persuasion The channel of communication plays an important role in the persuasion process. The crucial distinction implied in Figure 5 is with regard to feedback - information the communicator receives as to the reaction of the audience. Schramm (1961) pointed out that while feedback between two people is direct, between a mass communicator and a mass audience it is inferential, as well as delayed. In the latter case, quick modifications of the appeal in response to audience reactions are virtually impossible. The bulk of experimental research on attitude change has involved standardized persuasive 36 Journal of Marketing THEORY AND PRACTICE messages, transmitted to aggregates of isolated subjects, with no provision for changing the messages based on feedback. Therefore, this literature would (with some exceptions in studies of group dynamics) appropriately be applied only to mass-mediated persuasion situations. By contrast, the ATP applies to the entire spectrum of persuasion situations, from personal selling to political propaganda. From the perspective of this theory, the difference between one end of the spectrum and the other is not a chasm so much as a partly obscured pathway. The car salesperson and the molder of public attitudes are both engaged in the same craft, but at opposite ends of three critical dimensions: specificity of objectives, type of audience and availability of feedback. If the salesperson is perceived to be the more persuasive, the apparent difference in efficacy is due primarily to the fact that his task involves the more favorable extremes of all three dimensions. Also, by the time the salesperson and prospect begin negotiations, the prospect generally has made up his mind to purchase a car. Only the details of which car and from whom to purchase it remain to be settled, thus relieving the salesperson in most cases of having to engineer steps 1 through 4 of the Action Decision Sequence. Persuasion Strategy It follows from the foregoing discussion that, from Persuader's point of view, the strategy of persuasion would comprise the following steps: (1) Selection of a persuasion objective: (a) specific actor or set of actors, (b) specific action, (c) specific time frame; (2) Collection of status information concerning Actor in the context of the persuasion objective: understanding of (a) pertinent Action Decision Sequence(s), (b) pertinent steps, (c) nature of choices at each step, (d) relevant Choice Evaluation Arrays, (e) rewards, including Actor's importances.and perceived probabilities, (f) penalties, including importances and perceived probabilities, (g) values, including Actor's importances and perceived saliences; (3) Selection of appropriate step(s) in the Action Decision Sequence; (4) Selection of appropriate persuasion tactics; (5) Design of persuasive messages: (a) selection of most highly leveraged rewards, penalties and values, (b) incorporation of logical variables consistent with Actor's logic, (c) use of most effective presentation variables; (6) Transmission of persuasive message(s) to Actor: (a) selection of most effective source, (b) selection of most effective channel, (c) most effective use of audience variables; (7) Gather feedback on effects of messages; and (8) Design and present additional messages, as indicated by feedback. As outlined, this may seem to be a complicated and demanding process, but the fact is that in the right circumstances, a street hustler, a good salesperson, a skilled negotiator, a manipulative spouse or child, or any accomplished "practical persuader" can effect the entire process in a matter of seconds.</page><page sequence="11">Links Between Attitudes and Behavior Since the ATP is claimed to apply to the entire persuasion process, for virtually every persuasion situation, it should therefore be able to provide reasons or mechanisms to show why other approaches have occasionally fallen short in their attempts to explain, predict or otherwise account for aspects of persuasion. One historically troublesome area (as indicated earlier) has been the gap between attitudes and observed behavior. Figure 7 shows linkages between behavior and the three components of attitude originally noted by Day (1972): (1) The cognitive, or perceptual, component, having to do with a person's information about an object - for example, judgments about the attributes of a brand, product, person, ideology, etc.; (2) The affective, or feeling, component, having to do with liking or disliking an object, situation, person, or concept; and (3) The conative, or intentions, component, having to do with a person's gross behavioral expectations concerning an objective ~ for example, likelihood of buying a product or voting for a candidate. Figure 7 incorporates the dynamic nature of the Action Theory, allowing that behavior will probably occur at some time (TJ other than when attitudes and other properties are measured (Tm). Thus, cognitive attitudes measured at Tm are linked to behavior at Ta through a series of five connections between mental states at different points in the process. Assuming that these states can be appropriately quantified, we can postulate a chain of correlations among them. Cognitive attitudes are correlated (r^) with Actor's Choice Evaluation Array, which is correlated (r^) with Actor's choice or preference, which is correlated with Actor's behavioral intention (rDC), at the time of measurement, which is correlated (rCB) with behavioral intention at the time of action, which finally is correlated (rBA) with the behavior or action taken. The overall correlation between cognitive attitudes and a related behavior then is a product of five correlations, and its magnitude will be a function of the strengths or weaknesses of the component correlations. If, as Figure 7 shows, affective attitudes are linked to the next step in the Action Decision Sequence, choice or preference, then we would expect to find that, in general, measurements of affective attitudes tend to be better predictors, simply because there is one fewer correlation in the chain between these attitudes and ultimate behavior. Conative attitudes, linking to the Sequence yet one step further forward -- behavioral intention at Tm - would be expected to be yet more accurate predictors of ultimate behavior, having the least number of links in the chain of correlations. This is not to say that attitudes will necessarily be poor predictors of behavior. Well-conducted political polls focus on conative attitudes (voting intention), and are extremely accurate, with accuracy increasing with the proximity of the day the poll is conducted (Tm) to election day (TJ.

For those circumstances in which such predictions are disappointing, Figure 7 offers a mechanism to account for why this is so. Due to space constraints, this brief discussion has focused on the traditional, or "standard," learning hierarchy. However, beginning with the "four-orders" model of DeBruicker (1979), based on earlier insights of Michael Ray and others, marketing researchers have recognized that information processing can vary from the cognition-affect- conation pattern, especially in low-involvement situations, and that conation may often trigger a decision process that leads to attitude change. These insights also built upon several earlier streams of psychological research. Studies of cognitive dissonance (Festinger 1957) had shown that people sometimes change attitudes to conform with their behavior when the latter appears to them to contradict their prior beliefs. Research on attribution theory (cf. Bem 1967) had demonstrated that people often infer their attitudes from behavior they have already engaged in. Marketing researchers also know that consumers integrate information from any given marketing message not only with relevant prior experience generally (McQuarrie 1988), but also with initial trial experience of low-involvement products (Smith 1993). Marketing practitioners have responded with such tactics as point-of-purchase sampling of new products, which function to trigger conation prior to any significant cognitive or affective processing. Although a systematic analysis of each information processing pattern is beyond the scope of this paper, the logic outlined above would appear to hold for each of them. Summer 1999 37</page><page sequence="12">Links Between Intentions and Behavior Several extensions and proposed alternatives to the Fishbein approach have been specifically formulated as theories of behavioral intentions, beginning with the work of Warshaw (1980). On the one hand, this confirms Fishbein's recognition (in the theory of reasoned action) of the importance of intentions as a mediator between attitudes and behavior. On the other hand, it often sidesteps serious questions as to the relationships (if any) between intentions and behavior. There are, however, several current streams of research investigating these issues. For example, Warshaw and Davis (1985) demonstrate that many studies have confounded behavioral intention with behavioral expectation. More recently, they have "concluded that conventional intention measures are not valid. The problem seems related to the scales that are used to measure BI that are derived largely from Fishbein and Ajzen's conception of intention as a belief (Davis and Warshaw 1993). Bagozzi and Warshaw's (1990) "theory of trying" focuses on consumer uncertainty when achievement of a consumption objective is not entirely within one's volitional control. Greenleaf and Lehman (1995) show that substantial delay can occur at every stage of decision and consumption processes, which further reduces the probability of consummation of any intended behavior at any given time. Among methodological issues recently addressed are the fact that the act of measuring intent often leads to changes in behavior (Morwitz, Johnson and Schmittlein 1993). Work in progress by Morwitz, Steckel and Gupta (forthcoming) will provide a review of the conditions under which purchase intentions predict sales. Most of these authors address a concern that is addressed by Step 6 in the Action Decision Sequence. However, unlike some other approaches to the intentions/behavior gap, the ATP views the decision actually to engage in the behavior as to some extent independent of the choice of behavior (Step 5), with an array of rewards, penalties and values all its own, which may coincide with the arrays of any of the previous steps to some degree. Although studies such as those cited above have raised serious questions about the applicability of the Fishbein approach to marketing situations, that approach remains the reference point for most persuasion-related research. Only time will tell if all of the anomalies in that approach can be resolved sufficiently for it to retain that status, or if another framework, such as that being offered here, will ultimately provide a better foundation for the study of persuasion in marketing. likely benefits of the ATP would thus go to those who seek to 38 Journal of Marketing THEORY AND PRACTICE CONCLUSIONS AND MANAGERIAL IMPLICATIONS A theory of persuasion in marketing, based on influencing the actions of others, has been proposed. This theory appears to be compatible with other streams of research on the topic of persuasion and attitude change, and may even serve as a basis for integrating the various streams into one general theory of persuasion. Although the focus of the present paper has been on development of a theory, wise marketers have long known that "there is nothing so practical as a good theory." In addition to examples of possible applications of the ATP which have been mentioned throughout this paper, the Action Theory of Persuasion seems to apply to virtually any practical persuasion situation, both in aiding the understanding of such situations and in possibly enhancing a persuader's marketing effectiveness. Nevertheless, the present paper is clearly only a first, tentative step that must be followed by an ongoing process of theory testing and application development. Unfortunately, practitioner-oriented writings on persuasion in marketing have tended to gloss over the explicit meaning of persuasion, and/or focused on an extremely narrow range of persuasion applications (e.g. advertising testing), thus making derivation of any general theory virtually impossible (both of these tendencies can be found, for example, in Schwerin and Newell' s Persuasion in Marketing, 1981). On the other hand, it may be that the more general a theory, the less specific guidance it may provide to a practitioner with a typically narrow focus. However, it should be apparent, from examples throughout the preceding discussion, that the Action Theory of Persuasion suggests practical applications in many contexts, at many levels (although space constraints preclude a comprehensive inventory in this paper). For someone intending to persuade, it provides a well-defined formula for generating persuasion strategies, and suggests tactics for implementing these strategies. For someone intending to understand or analyze persuasion attempts, the ATP provides keys to unlock a process that at times can seem quite mysterious. Its primary contribution is likely to be in the latter case. Expert persuaders, including salespeople, recruiters, and con artists, have been plying their various arts and crafts at least since the advent of language. According to three major religions, the first persuasive message (consistent with the ATP, by the way) was delivered by the serpent in the Garden of Eden. The ATP clearly does not invent anything new. Rather it rests on analysis of what expert persuaders have done for centuries. Little in this paper would be news to such people; in fact, being made consciously aware of what they effectively do "instinctively" might even hinder them. The understand how expert persuaders operate.</page><page sequence="13">REFERENCES Ajzen, I. and M. Fishbein (1980), Understanding Attitudes and Predicting Social Behavior, NJ: Prentice-Hall.
