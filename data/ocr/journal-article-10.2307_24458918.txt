<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANIMALS AND MORAL THEORY 1. Daniel A. Dombrowski, The Philosophy of Vegetarianism, Amherst: The University of Massachusetts Press, 1984. Pp. iv + 188. $20.00, cloth; $9.95, paper. The 1970's are believed to be the age when serious philosophical inquiries on the moral bases for the treatment of animals began. The debate about the topic continues, and there are still a lot of disagreements about some subde and some times basic points. Nevertheless, there is an almost complete consensus among ad herents of different positions that we should make far-reaching changes with re gard to the practice of experimentation (which would practically eliminate most of the contemporary painful experiments on animals), that we should refrain from rearing animals for human consumption, and that we should change our brutal and cruel attitude towards animals. Since some basic positions and their consequences seem well established, could anything, beyond a further discussion of details, be added to the present debate? Dombrowski has proven that there is a great deal still worth saying. His book is the first lengthy treatment in English of the history of philosophical vegetarianism. He explains that ancient vegetarians had four reasons for their stance: (1) belief in a mythical golden age in which vegetarianism was practiced; (2) belief in the transmi gration of souls and in the possibility that animals were, or would become, human beings: (3) a belief that flesh-eating was injurious to the health of body (ancient medicine) or soul (the more general commitment to moderation or asceticism); (4) a genuine moral concern for animals themselves—i.e., belief that we should spare animals unnecessary suffering and should not kill them even painlessly. Some ancient philosophers tried to refute the argument from sentiency (i.e., that since suffering is bad, and animals are able to suffer, we should spare them unnecessary suffering and killing). One famous attempt was the Stoic use of reductio ad absurdum: "If we show justice to animals we will have to do so as well to plants, thereby threatening our own existence as just beings" (p. 78). But, as Dombrowski remarks, "there is a certain hypocrisy in this Stoic argument, i.e., the Stoic is re markably sympathetic to oak trees when his torments of sheep and oxen are brought to his attention" (p. 78). What is much more intriguing is Porphyry's so phisticated argument based on marginal cases (not quite 'normal' members of humankind—e.g., small children, the severely mentally ill, the retarded, or the like), which works both as a refutation of the Stoic objection and as an argument for vegetarianism: 100 CROSSCURRENTS</page><page sequence="2">If we suggest that sentiency is an insufficient standard for being jusdy treated, we eliminate many of our own species who live by sense alone, with out reason (alogon). And if we "lower" our standards to include all humans, we must be willing to include animals capable of sensation, among which would be cows, pigs, and chickens. At this point a defender of the Stoics would either have to admit his inconsistency or abandon his opposition to infanucide, mercy killing of the retarded, and so on. Hardly a nice position to find oneself in! (p. 79; cf. also p. 156) Dombrowski is entirely right that knowledge of the history of important issues has its own value, independently of any refining of contemporary ideas that might occur as a consequence (p. 3). However, his work is not merely a book about the history of philosophy, but also a concrete and controversial instance of a virtue based ethics, which, "must be taken seriously as an alternative to utilitarianism and Kantianism" (p. 4). Dombrowski writes that "one of the approaches in the ancient debate over vege tarianism perceives [vegetarianism] as a matter of virtue or excellence (arete) rather than, or in addition to, duty" (p. 4). He proposes six possible states of moral charac ter which may help us to locate what sort of action vegetarianism could be: A. Heroic excellence (arete): when one wants to act well and does so heroically. B. Ordinary excellence (arete): when one wants to act well, and does so. C. Self-control (enkrateia): when one wants to act badly, but controls oneself. D. Lack of self-control (akrasia): when one wants to act badly, tries to control oneself, but cannot. E. Badness of character (kakia): when one wants to act badly, does so without resistance, thinking it is to be good. F. Brutishness (aischros): a diseased moral character, inhuman (p. 123) What kind of action would vegetarianism be? Dombrowski maintains there are two possible and reasonable answers: (i) Vegetarianism may be an ordinary obligatory act and the practice of vegetari anism may be a matter of ordinary excellence (B) or self-control (C). This in turn would mean that opponents to vegetarianism exhibit moral characters (D), (E), or in extreme cases of torturing and cruelty, (F). The author believes that "moral char acter (D) is more prevalent than many suspect" (p. 123). (ii) vegetarianism is a matter of heroic excellence (A). For Dombrowski, there are two kinds of heroism, (HI) non-supererogatory he roism, and (H2) supererogatory heroism. Supererogatory acts, by definition, go above and beyond the scope of duties and obligations. They are always praisewor thy; they sometimes demonstrate the "saintliness" or the heroism of an agent. How ever, because of their great difficulty, they are not obligatory. (For example, it is commonly believed that it is our duty not to cause anyone's death. Suppose that someone may save the lives of many innocent people by sacrificing his own life. Would it be his duty to make such a sacrifice? Many authors maintain that such an action is not obligatory, but would be rather an example of supererogation.) Dom browski maintains that some philosophical positions "imply" that vegetarianism is a duty only for philosophers, but supererogatory for the multitude. He refers to Por phyry, Plutarch, Pythagoras, and Plato, and among contemporary philosophers, Tom Regan. (I do not see any reason to classify Regan in this group. He seems to me one of the most radical adherents of the doctrine that vegetarianism is obliga tory for everybody for whom vegetarian food is abundant, since the raising of ani SPRING1986 101</page><page sequence="3">mals for meat causes them to suffer and die. For him, Eskimos are probably in a position where vegetarianism could be supererogatory.) But what is heroic about vegetarianism? And which kind of heroism could vegetarianism be?: One could be a heroic vegetarian if he did his duty—not causing animals to suffer or be killed unnecessarily—regularly under conditions in which desire or self-interest or some other reason would prod most people not to do it, even thought vegetal food was in abundance—Η1. Or one could be a heroic vegetarian by refusing, above and beyond the call of duty, to make animals suffer or be killed even if it might be deemed "necessary" as in times of drought, etc.—H2. That is, moral excellence in the form of (B) or (A) can be attained without supererogation . . . The key question seems to be, is vegetar ianism "within the capacity of the ordinary man"? If not, Plutarch's and Por phyry's claim that it is a duty would be in danger, for vegetarianism would slip into the category of supererogation, thereby rendering it largely irrele vant for those who are not moral heroes in the sense of H2. (pp. 124—125) Dombrowski suggests that in our egalitarian culture it seems possible to encourage all people to pursue arete, including some heroic kinds of virtues. He believes that both the argument from sentiency and the argument from marginal cases are cor rect, and vegeterianism is a duty. "In the present state of culture, however, and this applies to Porphyry as well, a certain heroism is required from philosophers, but especially from the multitude, in order to meet this duty. This heroism need not be supererogatory; that is, one only needs HI to fulfill one's duty" (p. 126). Nevertheless, I still do not know what precisely is heroic about vegetarianism, although I am quite sure that I understand the author's distinction between two kinds of heroism. (His rationale for an arete-based ethics is not quite clear to me, either.) I have been a vegetarian for about 15 years, most of this time living under conditions much poorer than those typical of Americans or Western Europeans. During this time I have had no difficulties and I have not seen anything heroic in vegetarianism. Dombrowski claims that he does not place vegetarianism in the category of su pererogation. But then, what, precisely, does the non-supererogatory heroic arete (HI) consist of? Does the author have in mind a case where one is seriously addicted to a carnivorous diet in the way in which people are addicted to cigarettes or drugs? Or perhaps a situation in which a pioneer of vegetarianism acts against a strong and dominating opinion that vegetarianism is evidence of a kind of nervous disease, social non-adaptability, or vague sentimentality? In any case, if there is anything heroic about vegetarianism, the distinction between two kinds of heroism, on which Dombrowski's argument depends at least to a degree, demands further explora tion. Unfortunately the author supports his basic distinctions and assumptions only by offering a certain number of examples. It would be profitable to base the main distinctions on a developed moral theory rather than merely on some (perhaps ad hoc) examples. It would be better, as well, to say more about why we should develop and maintain moral virtues. Two theories, I think, could be taken into consideration in such explanations— utilitarianism and quasi-Kantianism. But then it might be the case that arete-based ethics is not as the author claims, a third proposal, but just a consequence of one of two well-known theories. Dombrowski writes in his "Introduction" that the phoenix of vegetarianism can fly in two directions. He maintains that ancient wisdom may be used as an Archime dean point from which we may criticize not only opponents of contemporary vege 102 CROSSCURRENTS</page><page sequence="4">tarianism, but also its defenders. I am not convinced by his criticism of the de fenders. On the other hand, and this is the second possible direction of phoenix's flight, we may use the tools and insights of the contemporary debate to better un derstand and criticize the inadequacies of ancient philosophical vegetarianism. Dombrowski's exposition of different views and doctrines of the ancient Greeks and Romans is informative and clear, and makes many useful references in the contemporary debate. The book is well written, very interesting, and—in Peter Singer's words—it will be "valuable for anyone interested in vegetarianism and its intellectual origins." As Dombrowski remarks: The plurality of assumptions, methods, philosophical anthropologies, and metaphysical beliefs among the ancient vegetarians should make the con temporary philosopher realize that vegetarianism is not a conclusion that fol lows from any particular assumption, method, philosophical anthropology, or metaphysics. This may also lead one to realize that the split between con temporary vegetarians who are utilitarians . . . and those who are quasi Kantians... is not surprising. And due to the plurality of reasons for ancient vegetarian beliefs, the contemporary opponent to philosophical vegetarian ism may come to realize that the position he opposes cannot be dismissed merely as a fad or a narrow, sectarian position (pp. 3-4). STEFAN SENCERZ 2. Mary Midgley, Animals and Why They Matter: A Journey Around the Species Barrier. Athens: The University of Georgia Press, 1984. Pp. 158. $14.00, cloth; $7.95, paper. Prof. Midgley begins her earlier book, Beast and Man: The Roots of Human Nature (1978), with the statement: We are not just rather like animals; we are animals. Our difference from other species may be striking, but comparisons with them have always been, and must be, crucial to our view of ourselves (p. xiii). Someone may worry that such an approach may jeopardize, if not harm, human dignity. Not at all, the author answers, since we may view the traditional marks of humanity, such as speech, rationality, and culture, "not as alien or hostile to the underlying emotional structure in which we so much resemble other species, but as growing out of and completing it" (ibid., p. xxii). The understanding and liberation of man is possible, but it must be the understanding and liberation of both reason and emotion. The sort of universe which assumes "the unity of life" is necessary for such a liberation: This is the sort of universe in which our nature is adapted to live, not one alien and contemptible to us, from which we must segregate. As I understand Humanism, this is its message... its chief job is to understand and save man. But man can neither be understood nor saved alone (ibid, p. 363). Her present book continues the arguments of the earlier one. As the core of the first was that reason and emotion (or man and beast) are not antagonists, so the core of Animals and Why They Matter is that men and animals are not, or at least need not be, antagonists. The author does not ignore competition and some real conflicts of interests. She denies, however, that in such cases we mayjust ignore animals' inter SPRING1986 103</page><page sequence="5">ests. She thinks rather that competition between us and animals, as well as competi tion between animals themselves, neither is nor has to be unlimited and always red in tooth and claw. She believes that even serious conflicts of interests could almost always be resolved more harmoniously than at present, leading to "the mixed com munity" of men and animals. Midgley sketches her ideal in radical opposition to a long tradition which has dismissed animals. Her criticism of the different prejudices of Descartes, Spinoza, Kant, Hume, Hobbes, J. Rawls, and R. G. Frey is very effective. She virtually demol ishes some of the most popular objections to an inclusion of animals into a sphere of morality: that care of animals would be emotional or even sentimental, and there fore wrong; that animals without language cannot suffer or feel pain, and cannot have thoughts, desires, or interests; and that any attempt to understand the moods of animals and what they desire, think, or are interested in, is necessarily a case of "anthropomorphism," and hence mistaken. She seems to think that two questions are relevant to the moral status of animals—first, the nature of animals, and second, the basis for the dismissal or in clusion of them in a sphere of morality. With regard to the first question, she dem onstrates how deep and complicated is the awareness of animals, and also discusses social relationships between animals, showing that they are deeper and more com plicated than it was supposed. (A most intriguing point is that there are some forms of reciprocity between animals which correspond with some mental relationships between men.) These analyses prepare a ground for a refutation of the species barrier as a crucial one, and for inclusion of all sentient beings in a moral commu nity. The author compares some typical forms of the treatment of animals to the typi cal forms of discrimination against humans. Slavery, racism, sexism and exploita tion of animals (speciesism, as it is sometimes called) turn out to have common fea tures. All are based on the same kind of mistakes, are frequently practiced by the same persons, are arbitrary, and unjustified by moral standards: Anyone who thinks it quite obvious that equality extends to, and stops exactly at, the species barrier should read the literature of women's emancipation as well as that of colonialism. Thus a member of parliament, opposing the Mar ried Women's Property Bill of 1868, denounced the proposal that a wife should own any property as introducing 'a novel principle of civil equality between man and woman'. . . About colonialism, it is striking how often the European emigrants to places like America and Australia disregarded the claims of the local inhabitants, although they themselves had often left home to escape the tyrannies and inequalities of Europe, and held explicit views opposed to these. Their attitude was, in practice, all the same in general as that of the Brazilian farmer who told a journalist investigating the native problem, 'Indians and pigs are the same thing. If either one comes on my land, I don't think twice—I kill them' (pp. 77-78). If we decide to include animals in a sphere of morality, what would it mean in practical and theoretical terms? Some authors maintain that if we believe that all humans are morally equal, including babies, the severely mentally ill, the retarded, etc., we should take the next step and say that humans and animals are morally equal as well. Midgley creates her ideal in moderated opposition to such a tradition of "equal inclusion" (the expression is mine, not hers). She believes there is an addi tional relevant factor which moderates an equality between all sentient beings. 104 CROSSCURRENTS</page><page sequence="6">An emotional, rather than a rational, preference for our own species . . . [that is] a necessary part of our social nature, in the same way that a prefer ence for our own children is, and needs no more justification. We must look seriously at this position, in which there is, I think, a great deal of truth. The species-bond is strong, even outside the institutions which have been devised to protect it. The kind of reaction which makes Crusoe risk his life to save Friday from the cannibals really works . . . The instinctive bond is a real one .. . The natural preference for one's own species does exist. It is not, like race-prejudice, a product of culture. It is found in all human cultures, and in cases of real competition it tends to operate very strongly (p. 104). So what?—one could ask. Why, in which way, and to what degree is it relevant? Midgley answers that we are not, and do not need to be, disembodied intellects. We are creatures of a definite species on this planet, and this shapes our values. Sup pose that it is true that the values in which most of us do believe are shaped not only by a special education but by our biology as well. There still remains an open ques tion : in which values should we believe, and which of them, in what degree, should we protect? The author seems to suppose a kind of metaethical naturalism. She tries to take advantage of it and to refute, or rather to moderate, a tradition of "equal inclu sion" and, in particular, utilitarianism. In her position, I would rather try to take advantage of utilitarianism for the sake of the protection of her moderate ethics "based on nearness or kinship" (p. 96), or species solidarity. Suppose that we need to take care of other humans rather than animals, that we are more interested in the welfare of other humans than that of animals, that we humans suffer more facing the misery of other humans than an equal misery of animals, and that, because of our disposition, we can more easily bring help to other humans rather than to animals. Suppose next, as Midgley maintains, that our needs, interests, and dispositions to compassion and solidarity are natural in the sense that they are not products of cultural or social education. What would follow if we accepted utilitarian standards? Not that other people's interests could be ig nored, or that other animals' interests could be ignored, or that our own interests could be ignored. Rather, it would follow that we should give equal consideration to the interests of everyone (including ourselves). An implication of utilitarianism would be that we consider as equally bad states of affairs the infliction of pain (or suffering, or misery, etc.) on a baby or on an animal. However, supposing that we faced a serious conflict of interest between a man and an animal, and that we had to inflict a certain amount of pain on one party (suppose that it is the smallest possible evil), we could almost always have a good utilitarian reason to inflict this pain on the animal rather than on the human being. This is because of the interests of third parties—that is, because of (natural, as Midgley claims) interests, feelings, dispositions, tendencies, etc., of ourselves and some other indirectly engaged people. If this argument is correct, utilitarianism might allow a certain kind of ethics of kinship or species-solidarity. And it might lead to a practical resolution not so different from Midgley's ideal of a mixed com munity. The basic difference between an utilitarian mixed community and Midgley's would not be in their practical consequences but in their justifications for these consequences. The utilitarian ideal can be based, I think, on much more rea sonable assumptions than Midgley's metaethical naturalism. Another shortcoming of the book is that Midgley does not spell out in detail the basic principles for her mixed community. She merely explains a way in which the SPRING 1986 105</page><page sequence="7">factor of equality would operate. Basically, all sentient beings would be taken into consideration and would have a place in a moral community. ("If we have duties to forests, they are not of that kind [are not based on the principle of equality, or the Golden Rule], But there are in any case other sorts of duties, so this need not sur prise us"—p. 91.) She does not explain, however, how a factor of natural species solidarity would operate, except that in cases of real competition it tends to operate very strongly. But does this imply that it should dominate in such situations? And which cases, by her standards, are cases of real competition? Consider two of the most frequently discussed practices—experimentation on animals, and the raising and the slaughtering of them for food. There is good evi dence that the results now being obtained in experiments on animals are trivial, that these results hardly can be applied to real problems of human life, and that there are, almost always, some alternatives to using animals as "tools for research." Is this an example of a competitive or a noncompetitive situation? Midgley just by passes the problem. Again, there is good evidence that raising animals for food causes enormous suffering, that meat-eating is unnecessary, that a meatless diet is not less tasteful and is probably healthier than a carnivorous one, that 90% of proteins are spent on the raising of animals, that the same food could be more effectively used for the reduction of world hunger, and that billions of animals are killed year after year. Is this a competitive situation or not? Peter Singer rightly maintains that we should cease consuming meat and, especially, that we should oppose factory farming, which is an extraordinarily pain-producing practice {Animal Liberation, 1975). Midgley's conclusions are not equally clear. She supposes that most of us are against some of the most brutal forms of the treatment of animals, and believes we should be. She does not explain, however, the moral status of such things as the treatment of animals in battery farms. Battery produced eggs and meat are on the whole and in the short run (in spite of some con cealed costs) somehow cheaper in the West than free-range equivalents .. . Competition does therefore exist to the extent of noticeable, though silent, economic clash, but certainly not to the extent of a life-and-death one (p. 26). Is this a "real competition," in which a species-solidarity factor operates (and perhaps should operate) strongly, or rather a moderate one, in which an equality factor dominates? Midgley would probably answer that the latter is the case, but we cannot be sure until she explains in detail how the two factors are connected with each other, and how each of them operates. Despite its inconclusiveness, the book proposes a valuable position. It searches for the place of animals within a community which, as a matter of fact, always has been a mixed community of humans and animals. Midgley avoids, where possible, technical and complicated language, a special virtue in writing on a topic important for non-philosophers. Another virtue of the book lies in Midgley's mode of argu mentation, which encourages us to respond to the situation and take responsibility for the rest of the earth. Midgley constantly asks, "What can matter to us? Why?" Her final paragraph presents her answer: Among the parts of [the] universe which are within our reach, the other ani mal species which share our planet with us are a most significant part. They are not just put there as a convenience for us, neither are they just an op pressed minority in human life. They are the group to which we belong. We 106 CROSSCURRENTS</page><page sequence="8">are a small minority of them. It seems reasonable to suggest that we ought to take them seriously (p. 145). STEFAN SENCERZ</page></plain_text>
