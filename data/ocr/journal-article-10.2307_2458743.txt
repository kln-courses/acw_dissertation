Lewin MAX HARTMANN Tubingen, Germany In a symposium on 'Sex in Microorganisms" Lewin (1954) has given a review on sex in unicellular algae. In this report my thesis of a general bi- polar bisexuality and a bisexual potency of isogamous haplomonoecious algae (generally called by Lewin homothallic according to the somewhat improper expression of Blakeslee, in spite of repeated objections by Correns, Kniep and myself) is rejected as a "theoretical anthropomorphic concept." Also, the existence of two physiologically different sorts of gametes re- ceives an unfavorable and insufficient evaluation because of some negative statements by the botanists Czurda, Mainx, Pascher and Pringsheim at Prague. These statements have already been refuted in detail. Evidence for the existence of physiologically diverse gametes has often been pro- vided by the method of residual gametes, a method due originally to Haem- merling not, as Lewin apparently believes, to Moewus. Furthermore the indication for sex-specific agents (gamones) in gametes of algae is ques- tioned, obviously since Lewin seems to believe that sex substances in uni- cellular algae have been mentioned only by Moewus "whose published re- suits contain a number of discrepant features." For the same reason the existence of relative sexuality is doubted. Actually, the term "gamone" for sex-specific agents did not originate with Moewus, as Lewin seems to assume, but was proposed by Hartmann and Schartau (1940) after consulta- tion with Prof. R. Kuhn. This rather partial presentation of sexuality in unicellular algae cannot pass without contradiction and calls for critical adjustment. It is impossible to give a correct critique of positive and negative findings concerning bi- polar bisexuality, bisexual potency, relative sexuality, and the occurrence of specific sex substances, or gamones, in fertilization by limiting the dis- cussion to unicellular algae only. It is necessary to pay regard also to the findings in multicellular algae (especially Ectocarpus siliculosus), fungi and protozoa. I claim to be entitled to make such a criticism of Lewin's 321</page><page sequence="2">322 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST report not only on account of my own investigations, which extend over decades, and those of my collaborators and students with regard to sex in algae, but also by the fact that my present collaborators, Foerster and Wiese, have, at my suggestion, accomplished the most careful and thorough examination yet made of the statements by Moewus on sexuality in Chlamydo- monas eugametos and on its gamones in particular. In agreement with American investigators, they could not verify the assertion of Moewus on the carotinoid nature of the gamones in this species. Moreover they showed that the cited statements of Moewus are wrong and why. They proved the existence of gamones in Chlamydomonas eugametos and C. reinhardi, de- termined the specific effect of the gamones, and showed them to be proteins with sugar components. In the following account the points at issue will be treated under three subjects: 1. Bipolar bisexuality in isogamous monoecious algae as indicated by the residual gamete method, and in isogamous and autogamous protozoa (flagellates), as indicated by the cytological findings of Cleveland. 2. Indication of relative sexuality in algae, fungi and protozoa. 3. Indication of gamones in algae and fungi. BIPOLAR BISEXUALITY IN ISOGAMOUS HAPLOMONOECIOUS ALGAE AND PROTOZOA Algae. Haemmerling (1934) has since 1931 investigated the reproduction and sexuality of the Dasycladacean, Acetabularia mediterranea. It is well known that his work led to valuable results, e.g. the demonstration of the mononuclear structure and the diploidy of this alga and especially the first proof for the dependence of form on substances produced by the nucleus and the cytoplasm. In the present review only his findings in connection with sexuality and the method of residual gametes, which he developed, are of interest. Sex determination in Acetabularia is diplophaenotypic and independent of the reduction division. The sex is determined at the latest for single cysts. This indicates that gametes of some cysts are plus while those of others are minus. In case only gametes from cysts of the same sex of any one plant are released, the plant seems to be dioecious for the combination of gametes from different plants shows a Zweierschema." On the other hand, if gametes from cysts with different sex are released from the same plant, pairing between gametes takes place and accordingly Acetabularia proves to be monoecious. In this case there remains after copulation a smaller or bigger number of the strongly phototactic gametes which gather in the dif- ferent Boveri-dishes near the source of light and can be isolated. These residual gametes copulate in new combinations and prove to be sexually differentiated according to a bipolar scheme. This bipolar sexual differen- tiation of the residual gametes is further confirmed by the fact that one type of residual gamete is able to mate only with a plus type or only with a minus type of gamete from a different cyst (table 1). This method of Haemmerling was applied with success by Moewus (1933), under control of Dr. Haemmer-</page><page sequence="3">SEX PROBLEMS IN ALGAE, FUNGI AND PROTOZOA 323 ling, to the haplomonoecious isogamous Stephanosphaera pluvialis and similarly haplornonoecious isogamous strain of Protosiphon botryoides. Both of these monoecious algae form two different sorts of gametes, i.e. plus and minus, or male and female, as proved by the residual gamete method. These results of Haemmerling and Moewus have been discussed earlier (Hartmann, 1932). At the same time Dr. Rosenberg (see Hartmann, 1932) applied the residual gamete method in her investigations on clone cultures of the haplomonoecious isogamous alga Hydrodictyon with results like those of Haemmerling.

This interpretation of Czurda and Mainx was thus refuted by the investigations of Rosenberg on the same organism chiefly used by Mainx. The facts are plainly the reverse of what they are made to appear in the account of Lewin. Later Lerche (1937) proved several strains of Dunaliella (D. parva, D. persei, D. euclora and D. minuta) to be monoecious, while Dunaliella salina was haplogenotypically dioecious. On account of difficulties with the ap- plication of the residual gamete method for these organisms, she used it only in her investigations on the related Haematococcus pluvialis and with the same result as described above for other monoecious algae. Of special interest are her findings regarding the pairing of isolated residual</page><page sequence="4">324 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST gametes with larger red gametes obtained by lack of phosphate and nitrogen in the culture medium. She gave only a short notice on these investigations (1937), but in my book "Die Sexualitaet" (1943) I published a detailed de- scription including the reproductions of her fine illustrations. In normal clone cultures Haematococcus pluvialis is isogamous and monoecious; it produces small green gametes that copulate with each other. But combina- tions of residual gametes hint at a clear "Zweierschema." In clone cul- tures without phosphate and nitrogen, big red gametes are formed that do not copulate with each other nor with other red gametes from similarly treated clone cultures. On the other hand a profuse pairing takes place with one type of the normal small green residual gametes, but just with one type only (fig. 1). Thus, a different culture method induced the formation of bigger and red gametes of only one sex which may be called female. It is impossible to demonstrate more clearly or more impressively the forma- tion in haplomonoecious isogamous algae of two sexually different gametes, plus and minus or male and female, respectively. Lewin, in his review, reports the earlier statements of Pascher (1931) concerning Chlamydomonas pauper from a natural habitat. This strain was held to be monoecious and isogamous. The released gametes were claimed to be male first and to become female afterwards. For this strain of Chla- mydomonas, Moewus (in Hartmann, 1934a) proved later, with clone cultures from the same location, haplogenotypic dioecism. Further statements of Moewus on the occurrence of two different sorts of gametes in monoecious isogamous algae will not be mentioned here, since they were published only after his leaving our institute. Lewin furthermore lays greater stress on the accounts of Pringsheim and Ondratscheck (1939), (who could not confirm the findings of Moewus on monoecious strains of Polytoma and Protosiphon with regard to the behavior of the residual gametes), than on the positive statements of Haemmerling, Rosenberg, Moewus and Lerche concerning other organisms. He attaches great weight to the objections which led Pringsheim and Ondratscheck to deny, from an evolutionary standpoint, the likelihood of the existence of two diverse sexual types in case of modificatory differentiation of sex which, according to me and my collaborators, is said to be controlled by the presence of sex substances in the nutrient medium. But this reasoning of Pringsheim and Ondratscheck is of a purely hypothetic and teleologic nature and thus cannot prove any facts. That they also failed to find two sexual types in some cases is neither remarkable nor decisive. It goes without saying that in some cases the residual gamete method will fail and it will be impossible to demonstrate the presence of sexually differentiated gametes for some monoecious isogamous algae. This would hold especially for cases in which the gametes are not released all at once but emerge only successively in the course of one day or of several days, or if a chemotactic or phototactic isolation of the residual gametes cannot be achieved. The negative results of Pringsheim and Ondratscheck might have been due to such conditions. In any case a few negative findings cannot affect the con- clusive force of positive results by acknowledged reliable investigators.</page><page sequence="5">SEX PROBLEMS IN ALGAE, FUNGI AND PROTOZOA 325 00, . .ic i:4~~~~~~~~~~~~~~i FIGURE 1.

It was not in any case what Lewin says, an "anthropomorphic concept, borrowed perhaps from Aristotle." The notion of a general bipolar bisexuality and bisexual potency goes back to 0. Buetschli (1888-1889) who presented it for the first time in his great standard work on protozoa after having recognized that his earlier "eVerjiungungshypothese" (hypothesis of rejuvenescence) is unable to ex- plain all aspects of fertilization in protozoa. While at that time the "Amphi- mixislebre" of Weismann and the "Verjiungungshypothese" of Buetschli were predominating, the latter's hypothesis of sexuality was left unnoticed until F. Schaudinn (1905), without having knowledge of Buetschli's concep- tion, developed in principle the same hypothesis in a report before the Ger- man Zoological Society. Some months earlier my friend Schaudinn had talked with me about his new hypothesis. Though already at that time, on account of logical considerations as well as observations and experiments, I had come to the conviction that neither the "Amphimixislehre" nor the "tVerju-ngungshypothese" were satisfactory theories of fertilization, I opposed his views in long discussions just on account of the numerous cases of morphologically and physiologically isogamous algae which I had already worked on at that time. But shortly afterwards there appeared the famous publications of Blakeslee (1904, 1906) in which he demonstrated for the isogamous Mucorinea Phycomyces blakesleeanus the presence and the indispensability of two sexually different types, i.e. plus and minus mycelia, for fertilization. Only after inoculation of both kinds of mycelia on agar slants did there arise in the zone of their contact the isogamous gametangia which copulate. With these findings of Blakeslee the possibility for a general bipolar bi- sexuality as well as for a general bisexual potency arose at one stroke. At that time it was not yet ascertained whether the bipolar bisexuality in this fungus was of genotypic origin, though that seemed most probable. Later Burgeff (1914) finally established this fact. Phycomyces remained for a long time the only case of such a genotypic dioecism. Only after 1919 could Kniep (1919) and his successors demonstrate the unexpected frequency of haplogenotypic dioecism in other isogamous fungi (Uredineae and Hymeno- mycetes), while later Kniep's students established the same fact for fresh water algae and I, with my collaborators, did the same for marine algae. From the year 1925 onward it was proved that in isogamous and anisogamous algae a strict differentiation of sex may occur not only as a genotypic dif- ference but also as a modification (phaenotypic dioecism). At the same time slight cytological differences of gametes in seemingly isogamous algae and protozoa, or a diverse behavior during fertilization was repeatedly observed. The extreme multiplicity of the various genetic and cytologic</page><page sequence="7">SEX PROBLEMS IN ALGAE, FUNGI AND PROTOZOA 327 findings and the manifold interlacing ways for their demonstration naturally cannot be described in this survey. Protozoa. I confine myself to a short report of some recent cytological findings by Cleveland (1953) in his investigations of the hypermastigote flagellates, parasitic in the wood-feeding roach Cryptocercus punctulatus. These studies prove a bipolar bisexuality of the fusing nuclei even in cases of extremely autogamous fertilization. Thus Barbulanympha is an anisogamous genus of flagellates the species of which differ with respect to the occurrence or non-occurrence of cell division following the nuclear division that initiates sexual differentiation. For instance, in Barbulanympha ufalula, this cell division usually occurs and so leads to normal complete gametogenesis, while in Barbulanympha wenyoni it usually fails to occur so that gametogenesis remains incomplete. According to Cleveland the ac- companying nuclear division in all species differs from asexual mitosis. In the derived male nuclei the telophase is completed more quickly. They can therefore be identified at an early stage by the denser coiling of the chro- mosomes and accordingly smaller size as compared with the female nuclei (fig. 2). In contrast with Trichonympha (see page 17), the final gametes differ only in size, the androgametes being smaller than the gynogametes. If, as is usually the case in Barbulanympha wenyoni, gametogenesis is not completed, an autogamous fusion of the pronuclei takes place. In other words, we can observe in just one genus the transition from anisogamous gametogamy to clear autogamy and moreover a sexual differentiation of the fusing pronuclei in extreme autogamy. Furthermore, as is the case in all hypermastigote flagellates, only the female centriole is preserved while that of the male pronucleus is eliminated. This holds for normal gametogen- esis (Barbulanympha ufalula) as well as for extreme autogamy (Barbulanympha wenyonz). RELATIVE SEXUALITY IN ALGAE, FUNGI AND PROTOZOA Algae. The occurrence of relative sexuality is mentioned by Lewin only incidentally and insufficiently. He states only that Moewus reported for several algae (e.g. Chlamydomonas, Polytoma and Protosiphon) obtaining viable zygotes by mating strong gametes with weak gametes of the same genetic sex. Extensive physiological and genetic investigations for many such cases are said to have been described by Moewus, and these were re- viewed by Moewus (1941, 1951), Chodat (1941), Smith (1951) and others. "Relative sexuality has apparently not been established in any unicellular alga investigated by other workers." Foerster and Wiese (unpublished) could not confirm Moewus on the occur- rence of relative sexuality in strong and weak mutants of Chlamydomonas eugametos (put at our disposal by Moewus). I convinced myself of the cor- rectness of their observations. Further experiments on relative sexuality with these mutants were not continued, for our main purpose was to clarify the chemical nature and biological efficiency of the gamones in Chlamydo- monas eugametos (see below, page 000), on which Moewus had reported.</page><page sequence="8">328 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST c b~~~~~~l FIGURE 2.

But being so far unconfirmed, they are left out of consideration here. The indication for the occurrence of relative sexuality in algae with iso- gamous fertilization, in forms with modificatory or genotypic dioecism, is in my opinion one of the most important and decisive points for the validity of the general sex hypothesis of fertilization. For this reason I wish to furnish a more detailed proof of it. In 1909, following a review of all available accounts of automictic fertili- zation in protists and thallophytes, I advanced the thesis that, because of certain findings, a general theory of sexuality and fertilization can prove correct only if the assumed bisexuality could be confirmed as relative, not as absolute. From this hypothesis, strictly logical deduction led to the conclusion that it should be possible experimentally to demonstrate cases in which gametes A act as males in relation to gametes B, while they act as females in relation to gametes C. The first proof of such a relative sexu- ality I found in 1914 together with Dr. Huth at the Zoological Station of Lunz am See in a Spirogyra of undetermined species (see Hartmann, 1923). When transferred to rainwater a profuse pairing took place. Besides normal ladder. shaped copulations, i.e. of strictly dioecious type, we found conjugations between three different filaments of the algae, of which two were either FIGURE 3. Spirogyra spec. (Chlorophycea). Copulation of three filaments, half schematic. A = proper $, B = proper , C is S with regard to A, S with regard to B, relative sexuality. After Hartmann (1923). proper male or female while the third one copulated with the gametes of the female as well as with the male filament, exactly as I had postulated in 1909 and tried to confirm by experiments. Figure 3 gives a half schematic repro- duction of the finding. Unfortunately it was not possible to cultivate this strain. On account of the outbreak of the war we had to return to Berlin- Dahlem and the material perished. A thorough analysis of the subject and further experimental tests became thus impracticable. Since at that time nothing was yet known about dioecious haplonts with non-hereditary modifi- catory sex determination, we assumed that we had found a case of haplo- genotypic dioecism with relative sexuality. Later Czurda (1925) established for Spirogyra weberi that its strict dioecism can be accomplished only by modification (phaenotypically).</page><page sequence="10">330 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST After the war experiments on relative sexuality in algae could not be re- sumed until the spring of 1924 at Naples. Besides numerous combinations be- tween normal male and female gametes in strictly dioecious Bryopsis mucosa as well as between two female or two male types of different plants, respec- tively, I observed with Belar (see Hartmann, 1929a) in a combination of gametes from two different female plants several normal fertilizations which are copied here from drawings by Belar (fig. 4). We were not able to raise cultures from these zygotes at that time. Further experiments on Bryopsis were not undertaken because during the following spring we found in the FIGURE 4. Bryopsis plumosa (Chlorophycea). Copulation between 2 gametes from different plants. After Hartmann (1929a). Phaeophycean, Ectocarpus siliculosus, an organism much better suited for the demonstration of relative sexuality. In the autumn of the same year I made combinations with the isogamous gametes of Dasycladus clavaeformis which proved strictly dioecious during the time of my tests. Among a great number of normal combinations, follow- ing strictly a "Zweierschema," I found one case of relative sexuality. In the autumn of 1925 the sexual conditions in this alga were thoroughly in- vestigated by my collaborator at that time, Jollos (1926), who demonstrated the occurrence of relative sexuality in this species. His results were dis- cussed in detail in the book of Kniep (1928) and again by myself (1943) so that I can refer to these reports. The best object to demonstrate the occurrence of relative sexuality in algae proved to be the multicellular Phaeophycean, Ectocarpus siliculosus, from Naples (not from other habitats). For this alga Berthold (1881) and later Oltmanns (1899) had already demonstrated that only gametes originating from different plants can copulate. As these two botanists had established, the morphologically isogamous gametes behave differently when brought to- gether; while one (the female) type settles down and loses its flagella, the other (the male) type aggregates around the fixed females by chemotaxis. This is followed by fusion of one male gamete with a female one (fig. 5).</page><page sequence="11">SEX PROBLEMS IN ALGAE, FUNGI AND PROTOZOA 331 In 1925 and 1926 (in 1925 supported by Jollos) we gathered the gametes of 155 plants of Ectocarpus and made 1400 combinations between male and female, female and female, and male and male gametes which confirmed and completed the statements of Berthold and Oltmanns. We could ascertain that in combinations of male and female types of gametes a violent clump- ing took place, sometimes in a few seconds, while in other cases we ob- served a slower clumping with less groups or, still later, a very weak clump- ing. This shows that there exist strong females, rather strong females and weak females and conversely strong male, medium strong male and weak male types of gametes. In Ectocarpus the same plants may release their FIGURE 5. Ectocarpus siliculosus (Phaeophycea). Copulation of gametes, seen from above. Drawn from stained material. After Hartmann (1937). gametes in the course of several days up to 6 or 8 times; and in all ensuing tests the sexual strength of each plant proved to be always of the same de- gree. On combination of strong and weak gametes from plants of the same sex we observed relative sexuality in 38 cases. Often one type was shown to be strong, another one of the same sex to be weak (table 2). The objec- tions by Czurda and Mainx against this interpretation of the experiments- Czurda had assumed hidden monoecism-I had considered myself and taken into account in 1925 and in full particular in 1926; but in all cases I could establish strict dioecism. A few cases which seemed to be exceptions to the rule could be explained by interlacing of two plants or otherwise (com- pare Hartmann, 1934b). My collaborators Haemmerling, Foyn and Bauer have examined these relations in later years with the same results. Further- more (Hartmann, 1937) it could be ascertained by marking one or both types by vital staining that always the female gametes settle in the middle of a clumping group while the males keep their motility. After so many detailed trials there can be no further doubt about the occurrence of relative sexuality in this morphologically isogamous but physiologically anisogamous Phaeo- phycean. Should someone not yet be convinced of the right interpretation of the Ectocarpus tests, I recommend a thorough examination of the cited pub- lications (1925 and especially 1934b and 1937) in which the possible sources of error are discussed in detail and the interpretation of Czurda was shown to be incorrect. After my paper of 1934b neither Czurda nor Mainx has re- peated his doubts or objections concerning the experiments with Ectocarpus.</page><page sequence="12">332 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST TABLE 2 ECTOCARPUS SILICULOSUS (PHAEOPHYCEA).

The strict dioecism of Ectocarpus siliculosus from Naples thus proves conditioned by modification (phaenotypically), as likewise ascertained for other algae in the meantime. Now it was of importance to furnish proof of relative sexuality in algae with haplogenotypic sexuality. Besides the cases described by Moewus (that became doubtful, see above, page 000) such a case came to observa- tion only once in Enteromorpha ran2ulosa. Table 3 shows that the gametes of plant number 2 (minus) gave weak clumping and copulation with those of plant number 11 (minus) (Hartmann, 1929b).

Fungi. I confine myself to a short description of conclusive findings of relative sexuality in Ascormycetes and Basidiomycetes (especially Hymeno- mycetes). I wish to emphasize that at an early date Blakeslee and his col- laborators had already described in Mucorinae a strong difference of valence in infertile crosses between various dioecious as well as between monoecious and dioecious species and made probable the occurrence of relative sexuality.

He employed hermaphrodites and genetic males obtained from a hermaphroditic stock by natural or experimentally induced mutations. Thus the conditions for rela- tive sexuality are given in this instance. Furthermore the various sexual reactions of this Ascomycete, on pairing of hermaphrodites alone or hermaph- rodites with males of different valence, revealed relations that can be in- terpreted as relative sexuality. An incontestable statement came from Greis (1941) who worked on mutants of Sordaria fimicola. By X-radiation of a hermaphroditic initial form he got strong, normal and weak females as well as strong, normal and weak males. When he combined strong female mutants F3 with weak female mutants FP he obtained in several cases normal fruiting bodies. Since the female sex is to be recognized plainly by formation of ascogonia it is beyond doubt that in</page><page sequence="14">334 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST TABLE 4 SORDARIA FIMICOLA (ASCOMYCETE). 0 = NO FRUIT-BODIES, Z = FER- TILE FRUIT-BODIES, x = STERILE FRUIT-BODIES, x A CASE OF WEAK FERTILITY.

This result he furthermore confirmed by analysis of gones. For Hymenomycetes Quintanilha (1939) has shown by a very careful genetic analysis of the so-called Buller phenomenon in mutants of Coprinus fimetarius that the A-factors, which according to later investigations of Greis are to be looked upon as the essential sex factors, possess different strengths in the mutual attraction of nuclei in haplomycelia with respect to the weaker type of nuclei in diplomycelia. Quintanilha thus came to the important es- tablishment of a differing valence in the multiple series of A-factors as ex- pressed by the following schema: aA--------A------- Al --1---- a, 10 20 40 50 In this connection he hints at the fundamental similarity between the differ- ing valences of A-factors and the occurrence of relative sexuality in algae.

In this fungus, Solenia anornala, Greis (1942) furthermore observed among the female stocks some of a hereditarily different valence, viz. four females of different strength (F', F2, F3 and F4) which after combination produced some cases of relative sexuality. While F' and F3 as well as F2 and F' are able to copulate normally with each other but do not form fruiting bodies, F1 x F' copulate and moreover yield normal fruit-bodies (table 5). These clear results allow the conclusion that the described findings of Quintanilha are also to be regarded as cases of relative sexuality. By this short review on anisogamous Ascomycetes and isogamous Hymenomycetes with haplogeno- typic determination of sex, the occurrence of relative sexuality in these fungi is demonstrated beyond doubt.

Cleveland (1949), in his account of the fertilization of the hypermastigote flagellate Trichonympha, described the most impressive case of relative sexuality that has yet come to our knowledge. In his publication he called the gametes with abnormal behavior and weaker sexual differentia- tion gynandromorphic, but after my review (Hartmann, 1954) of his many in- teresting results on the fertilization of hypermastigote flagellates he ac- cepted my interpretation of the observations. The gametes of this haploid flagellate-which are distinctly characterized as male and female by their cytologic structure and by their behavior during fertilization-arise within a cyst by a single division of one cell (gametocyst). Already in the prophase and early mretaphase a darker staining intensity of the chromatids of the later sperm nucleus, when compared with that of the later egg nucleus, is to be observed as the first indication for a sexual differentiation of the two later gametes. The cytoplasmic differentiations, which as a rule occur only after excystation of the gametes, are most impressive: while the granules in the male gametes remain scattered in the cytoplasm, they gather in the posterior end of the egg and congregate to a compact ring of fertilization granules around a lucid mass of cytoplasm, serving as fertilization cone (fig. 6Ib). At this point the male gamete enters the egg like a sperm and, while the cytoplasm is taken in, the male extranuclear organelles degenerate and the darker stained male gamete fuses with the female. The fertilization process of Trichonympha thus proves to be extremely anisogamous regarding the cytologic structure and the conduct of the gametes, while the varying sizes of the latter are without sexual significance. Fertilization in Trichonympha, as in all hypermastigote flagellates oc- curring in the blattid Cryptocercus punctulatus, takes place epidemically in close correlation with the molting of the host. Besides numerous normal copulations there occur fusions of two female or two male gametes of cyto- logically varying differentiation (valence). Figure 6IIa shows pairing of two gynogametes of which the upper one is of normal female structure with a compact ring of fertilization granules at the posterior end, while the lower</page><page sequence="16">336 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST FIGURE 6.

In the case demonstrated in Figure 6IIb, the female character of the gynogamete, behaving like a sperm, is even more explicit. An example of special interest is reproduced in figure 611c, where three gynogametes of relative sexuality with more or less female characteristics are in copulation. Here the lowest one shows prevailing male properties in that the accumulation of the granules at the posterior end has just begun. Cleveland has published in his paper mostly cases of fe- male relative sexuality; but in addition mating may occur between two andro-</page><page sequence="17">SEX PROBLEMS IN ALGAE, FUNGI AND PROTOZOA 337 gametes with different degrees of the male characteristics as shown by figure 611d. The natural occurrence of relative sexuality in a protozoon, the gametes of which are extremely anisogamous in their cellular structure as well as in their conduct, and its simple microscopic establishment is most astonishing. In Ectocarpus it was necessary to make more than a thousand gamete com- binations to refute all possible objections and to secure the result (Hart- mann, 1925, 1934b, and 1937). Here it is sufficient to fix and stain some preparations and take a look into the microscope to be convinced of the facts Moreover they can be studied on living material. Even the boldest imagination would have scarcely dared to dream of such an anisogamous FIGURE 6.

The very degree of female tendency in the gynogametes of a relative sex can be estimated by eye. Though to. day the occurrence of relative sexuality may be called experimentally proved for Ectocarpus and other algae and fungi (see above), such an impressive microscopically visible proof as furnished by the observations of Cleveland on Trichonympha will have still more convincing power for quite a number of biologists since many of them (not to say most of them) are inclined to believe only their eyes. GAMONES Algae. If gametes of the same sex of Ectocarpus siliculosus are brought together nothing happens, even if hundreds or thousands of gametes are whirling about. If they cling to each other occasionally, they will soon separate again. But in combinations of male and female morphologically isoganious gametes with full reaction capacity the whole Boveri-dish shows suddenly in a few seconds a heavy clumping. In the middle of each such cluster is placed a female gamete without flagellum, surrounded by swarm- ing males, until finally one male gamete fuses with the immobile female. With this observation in 1925 we grasped at once the conception that this strange behavior could be explained only if the androgametes secreted a substance that induces the gynogametes to throw off their flagella and be- come fixed; and if the females produced some other substance that calls forth the approach of the males by chemotaxis or thigmotaxis. Attempts to produce a specific reaction in the opposite sex by means of filtrates of iso- lated female and male gametes failed in Ectocarpus in the years 1925 and 1926. But my collaborator Jollos could establish in the autumn of 1925 in Dasycladus clavaeformis such a specific efficiency of filtrates from plus or minus gametes. For this demonstration he used minus gametes with lessened reaction capacity as shown by their failure to yield further clumping and pairing when mixed with gametes of the opposite sex. Such unreactive minus gametes, when placed in filtrates from minus gametes of undiminished reaction capacity, at once yielded again profuse formation of clusters and pairs after being mixed with plus gametes (This is Lewin's case 2 in his account of the different actions of sex substances). In tests on filtrate ef- ficiency, Jollos further found that the filtrates of gametes with strong reac- tion capacity may change the response of weakly reacting gametes of the same sex, namely, that the latter become capable of copulation with strong gametes of the opposite sex or, in other words, that weakly reacting gametes were unable to copulate with gametes of the opposite sex unless they were subjected first to filtrates of strong gametes of the same sex as that of the weak gametes. The substances in question were called later by Kuhn and Moewus termones (case 4 of the different actions of sex substances accord- ing to Lewin). With these experiments Jollos had already in 1926 ascer- tained substances of type 2 (gamones) and type 4 (termones). At first Jollos regarded the substances ascertained by himself merely as the cause</page><page sequence="19">SEX PROBLEMS IN ALGAE, FUNGI AND PROTOZOA 339 of copulation. In contrast with me he did not attach to them a special value as sexual substances. But later results concerning sexuality in algae and fungi demonstrated that such a distinction between substances inducing copulation and special sex substances is without relevance in this form. I refrain from going into detail on sex-determining substances. A further proof of gamones (substances of type 3 according to Lewin) was furnished by Geitler (1931) for Tetraspora lubrica, a strain with haplogeno- typic determination of sex. He found that the gametes of one genetic sex could be induced to give a clumping reaction (autoagglutination) by the addi- tion of concentrated extracts practically free from cells, gained from sus- pensions of the opposite sex. By this test for the first time the case 3 of Lewin was established. Similar results were reported by Moewus (1933) re- garding filtrates of Chlamydomonas eugametos, contaminated with bacteria, and residual gametes of Stephanosphaera and Protosiphon. Before entering into particulars on the accounts of Moewus which re- cently were confirmed in principle by Foerster and Wiese, though they had to be revised in some essential points, further positive findings of gamones in unicellular and multicellular algae will be reported. Thus Lerche (1937) could account for sex specific gamones in the haplogenotypic dioecious Dunaliella salina. Instead of extracts (as in the tests of Geitler) she used centrifugates from gametes of one sex with which she induced clumping reaction in the gametes of the other sex (autoagglutination). She found that by filtration through a membrane with 0.75 S pores the active agent was removed, and she suggested that larger particles rather than a solute were responsible for the effect, The accounts of Geitler and Lerche are well-founded by their protocols, and in the case of Lerche furthermore Alet FIGURE 7.

After Lerche (1937).</page><page sequence="20">340 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST by a photocopy of a clumping reaction induced by filtrates of gametes of the opposite sex (fig. 7), In Ectocarpus siliculosus the occurrence and the effect of gamones was established finally in the spring of 1936 (Hartmann, 1937). In that spring (though only after the end of April) Ectocarpus proved to furnish fine ma- terial. All of the 64 tested plants, with the exception of only four speci- mens, released an abundance of gametes (most of the plants several times, that is, up to seven times in the course of some days), and all of them were dioecious. This strict dioecism showed up usually between 9 and 10 a.m. before the starting of combinations since the female gametes exhibit less motility. They often lost their flagella and had already settled down during the forenoon. For this reason some of the female types, which in the early morning had paired with heavy clumping reaction, by about noon gave no more clusters nor copulations with their still fit male partners. But with the same males a renewed good reaction could be induced by the addition of filtrates from three to four female types that had kept motility (case 2 of the different actions of sex substances according to Lewin). In a similar wlay the effect of male sex substances (gamones) could be demonstrated. Lewin's statement: "qatart from this uncertain case" (with reference to an account of Schulze, 1927, unmentioned in this report) "sex substances have apparently been reported in unicellular algae only by Moewus," does not prove correct according to the investigations just described. For unicellu- lar algae the occurrence of gamones and their activity had been established beyond doubt by Jollos (1926) in Dasycladus (case 2 of Lewin), by Geitler (1931) and Lerche (1937) in Tetraspora and Dunaliella salina (case 3 of Lewin, and by lartmnann (1937) for the multicellular Phaeophycean Ecto- carpus siliculosus (case 2 of Lewin). At the same time the occurrence of termones had already been ascertained by Jollos (1926) in Dasycladus (case 4 of Lewin). Following this historical review of the evidence I shall discuss in particular the reports of Moewus on the presence of gamones in Chlamydomonas eugametos. In the last year or two my collaborators Foerster and Wiese (1954 a and b) have submitted these questions with regard to Chlamydomonas eugametos to a thorough examination. They could to some extent confirm the account of Moewus (1933), though not with regard to some rather vital points. One of these concerns the statement of iMoewus that the clumping of gametes of one sex by filtrates of the opposite sex (autoagglutination, case 3 of Lewin) can be induced only if bacteria are present or applied simultaneously. Divergently Foerster and Wiese obtained the same result with filtrates absolutely free from bacteria (fig. 8). This item is of minor importance, since Moewus himself mentioned the desirability of its reexamination. Of essentially greater importance is the second deviation from Mloewus' report. This concerns the dependence of gamone formation on exposure to light, a relation which later assumed great importance in Moewus' claims for the carotinoid nature of the gamones. In the first place, Foerster and Wiese</page><page sequence="21">SEX PROBLEMS IN ALGAE, FUNGI AND PROTOZOA 341 (1954 a and b) established that the gametes are already completely motile in the dark, while Moewus had stated that they become agile only after ex- posure to light or to the carotinoid crocetin, formed in the light. Secondly, Foerster and Wiese found that the female gametes have perfect capability of reaction even without illumination. The female gamone is already released in the dark and accordingly the gynogametes can at once start clumping and copulation with males made capable of reaction by light; while the male gamone is released by the androgametes to the culture medium only after exposure to light. These exact results of Foerster and Wiese show that by performing the experiments indicated by Moewus it is quite impossible to demonstrate the said gamones or compounds of cis- and trans-crocetin- dimethylester and their dependence upon light.

In these investigations, most ac- counts, especially of American authors, that were in disagreement with the statements of Moewus find an explanation. Fungi. Burgeff (1914) established for fungi, by his experiments with the mucorale Mucor mucedo, a gamonelike effect of chemomorphotically effi- cient substances. The minus myceliumr, separated by a collodion wall from the adjacent plus mycelium, not only induced the formation of zygophores FIGURE 9. Bombardia (Ascomycete). Characteristic growth of two trichogynes to approach an accumulation of spermatia (chemotropical growth). After Zickler (1953). through this membrane but also induced the zygophores to establish contact with the wall by growing telomorphotically backwards, instead of straight upwards. The mutual approach by growth of the hyphae and their fusion at the rim of the wall is effected obviously by substances which may justly be called gamones. The inauguration of zygophores is caused presumably by other substances like those found by Raper in Achlya amphisexualis. For this Saprolegniacean Raper (1939 and 1940) has shown in a series of careful experiments that four hormone-like substances (A, B, C and D) in- duce the formation and the joining of antheridia and oogonia, of which A and B can be regarded as termones. The hormone C, released by the imma- ture oogonia, causes the branches of the antheridia to grow chemotropically toward the oogonia, to be cut off and to unite with the oogonia. The op-</page><page sequence="23">SEX PROBLEMS IN ALGAE, FUNGI AND PROTOZOA 343 posite effect is produced by a substance emitted by the antheridia which calls forth the discharge of the oogonia (hormone D). It goes without say- ing that the hormone C can be called a gynogamone and its antipode D an androgamone. In a third fungus, the ascomycete Bombardia, Zickler has proved the ac- tivity of an androgamone, with which I have already dealt in my book on sexuality (1943). For the final work of this investigator who perished in the wars the reader is referred to his last publication (Zickler, 1953). The male spermatia of Bombardia secrete a substance that induces the trichogynes, which grow straight in monospore cultures, suddenly to assume a meander- ing growth, as in combinations of male and female mycelia, and to approach the spermatia even from a considerable distance (fig. 9). Trichogynes of a female mycelium show the same behavior if capillaries, loosely fixed to the agar dishes, contain a suspension of spermatia or an extract of spermatia obtained by heating. Finally the application of agar cubes soaked with a filtered suspension of spermatia brought about an equal reaction by the trichogynes, but not by the other hyphae. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The following conclusions can be drawn from our critical review of the present results regarding the sexuality of algae, fungi and protozoa: L1 By the residual gamete method of Haemmerling bipolar bisexuality is absolutely demonstrated for the haplomonoecious isogamous algae Acetabu- laria (Haemmerling, 1934), Stephanosphaera pluvialis, Protosiphon botryoides (Moewus, 1933) and Haematococcus pluvialis (Lerche, 1937) as well as for the multicellular alga Hydrodictyon (Rosenberg, communicated by Hartmann, 1932). For these species, the investigations also demonstrate bisexual po- tency (bisexual reaction norm of Goldschmidt). Furthermore, recent cyto- logical investigations by Cleveland on hypermastigote flagellates proved for all forms, including the seemingly isogamous and autogamous cases, a bi- polar bisexuality and a. bisexual potency. In the related anisogamous genera and species the exhaustive examinations by Cleveland have shown that dur- ing copulation the male extranuclear organelles are discharged while only the female ones remain intact. The apparently isogamous and autogamous forms behave in the same way, so that here too a male and a female partner can be discerned; in other words, a bipolar bisexuality is manifested. Thus we have for the first time a proof of bipolar bisexuality and bisexual po- tency regarding autogamous fertilization. 20 In dioecious algae in which the determination of sex is controlled either genetically (haplogenetically) or by modification (haplophaenotypi- cally), a general bipolar bisexuality and bisexual potency is established by the occurrence of relative sexuality. Excluding single cases lacking close analysis (Bryopsis mucosa, Spirogyra spec. and Enteromorpha ramulosa following Hartmann), decisive evidence was secured by thorough investiga- tions on the morphologically isogamous Phaeophycean Ectocarpus siliculosus (Hartmann, 1925, 1934b, 1937). Relative sexuality and thereby bisexual</page><page sequence="24">344 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST potency and relative differences in valence of the sexually differentiated gametes were confirmed for anisogamous ascomycetes by Huettig (1934) in Glomerella and by Greis (1941) in Sordaria fimicola. The same was proved by Greis through careful genetic analysis of the isogamous hymenomycete Solenia anomala. These investigations render irrelevant the objections formerly raised against the interpretation of relative sexuality for the re- sults of Quintanilha on Buller's phenomenon in Coprinus limetarius. The elucidation of these sexual problems, which is most significant for the understanding of sexuality and for their explanation as relative sexuality, is now beyond doubt. All these points, including those from algae as cited above, are absolutely independent of a confirmation of the questioned ac- counts by Moewus. This refers in particular to the impressive, purely cyto- logical demonstrations on the occurrence of relative sexuality in Trichonympha by Cleveland. 3. The same applies to the establishment of sex-specific (plus and minus or male and female) gamones that render possible the fusing of gametes. Only with the concept of gamones do we acquire a physiological under. standing of copulation, not only with regard to isogarrous but also with re- gard to anisogamous and oogamous gametes. This proof was secured by Jollos (1926) in Dasycladus, by Geitler (1931) in Tetraspora, by Lerche (1937) in Dunaliella and by Hartmann in Ectocarpus siliculosus. As shown above, the same refers in principle to Chlamydomonas eugametos, the ob- ject of Moewus, though some of his reports, especially the biochemical parts, did not prove correct. Gamones have also been established in fungi by Burgeff in Mucor mucedo, by Raper in Achlya and by Zickler in Bombardia. In contrast with the review of Lewin I believe to have furnished proof that the phenomena of general bipolar bisexuality, of bisexual potency, of relative sexuality and the presence of gamones are not to be looked upon as a "theoretical anthropomorphic concept" (Lewin), but that they are well founded on facts which are of decisive significance for a general theory of fertilization and sexuality.
