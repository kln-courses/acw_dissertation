      <p>Julian Franklin’s book, <italic>Animal Rights and Moral Philosophy</italic>, will be of great interest to moral philosophers and those interested in the history of moral philosophy. Franklin’s stated project is a reworking of the theory of animal rights. Chapter 1 contains a critical discussion of Peter Singer and utilitarian theories concerning animal rights. Interestingly, Franklin is also critical of the utilitarian Ray Frey, who opposes animal rights from within the same utilitarian theoretical framework. Franklin contends that utilitarianism is a fundamentally flawed theoretical framework that is simply inadequate for a sensible discussion of animal rights. I suspect that even if this conclusion should turn out to be correct, it would require rather more than the ten pages of discussion devoted to it.</p>
      <p>Chapter 2 examines the alternative, deontological, framework for a discussion of animal rights. The focus here is on the work of Tom Regan. Franklin thinks Regan has failed to make his case—the cause of the failure being rooted in his failure properly to appreciate Kantian moral theory. It is not so much that Regan is wrong but, rather, that his arguments are not properly grounded. This sets us up for the discussion in Chapter 3, where a detailed analysis of animal rights in the context of Kantian moral theory is set forth.</p>
      <p>The focus of Chapter 3 is on the meaning of the categorical imperative—something that Franklin contends has been misinterpreted not only by numerous commentators but also by Kant himself. Franklin argues that Kant confuses the subjects of the categorical imperative (rational beings) with the beings to which the imperative applies. When properly understood, Franklin contends, Kant’s idea of the moral law becomes a powerful argument for the rights of all sentient beings: “Act in such a way that you always treat sentience, whether in yourself or in the self of any other, never simply as a means but also at the same time as an end” (p. xiii).</p>
      <p>The concern of Chapter 4 is with post‐Kantian rationalism, where attention is given to the works of John Rawls and such luminaries as Jürgen Habermas. Chapter 5 addresses issues surrounding animal rights and feelings of compassion. Chapter 6 is focused on issues raised by environmentalism and the preservation of endangered species. The book is brief (128 pages, including two appendixes). It could be used with profit in an introductory ethics class.</p>

         <italic>Thinking with Animals: New Perspectives on Anthropomorphism</italic>, edited by Lorraine Daston and Gregg Mitman, is likely to be of much more interest to the readers of <italic>Isis</italic>, since it is a collection of essays focused on issues in the history and philosophy of science. Is anthropomorphism an intellectual sin and, thus, something to be avoided? With the advent of evolutionary biology, species boundaries ceased to be absolute metaphysical boundaries. The principle of phylogenetic continuity suggests that humans and their nonhuman mammalian relatives, for example, exhibit both similarities (arising from common descent) and differences (arising from modification consequent upon divergence from common ancestors). This leads us to expect both similarities and differences with respect to psychological traits.</p>
      <p>Of course, the issues here are not merely of scientific interest. After all, in the United States today school boards and statehouses are hearing religious arguments to the effect that humans and nonhuman animals are fundamentally different and that Darwin’s theory of evolution blurs a fundamental theological boundary. Matters are seldom simple, for lurking in the Bible itself are tales of talking serpents and donkeys (e.g., Balaam’s Ass). The Judeo‐Christian take on these matters is not monolithic. Even in medieval times, it could be argued that humans stood at the top of the <italic>scala naturae</italic>, but this did not stop Saint Francis from talking to animals.</p>
      <p>Then again, in contemporary debates about animal rights, much hinges on how similar humans and nonhuman animals are with respect to cognitive traits—just consider the debates between cognitive ethologists, behaviorists, and the modern “bio‐Cartesians” (who maintain that animals have no mental lives at all).</p>
      <p>The volume is divided into four parts. Part 1 examines these issues in historical and cultural context. It contains contributions on Indian zoomorphism (human as animal) as well as anthropomorphism (animal as human). There is also a contribution on angelic, human, and animal intelligences. This part of the volume ends with a discussion of the status of experimental animals in Victorian Britain.</p>
      <p>In Part 2 the focus shifts to an examination of these vexatious matters from the standpoint of evolutionary biology. In this part of the volume we learn that it is important to avoid mistaken anthropocentrism and mistaken denial of such. Observation must be our guide. There is also a valuable essay on the argument from analogy and the perils of cross‐species modeling.</p>
      <p>Part 3 shifts the focus of attention to relationships between humans and animals in everyday life. Here there are interesting reflections on the human–pet relationship, as well as on the aesthetic implications of animal imagery in contemporary art. This leads to Part 4, where consideration is given to anthropomorphic conceptualizations of animals in film and photography. Here there are essays on the portrayal of elephants in the media and on the ways in which visual imagery has shaped our understanding of the relations between humans and great apes.</p>
