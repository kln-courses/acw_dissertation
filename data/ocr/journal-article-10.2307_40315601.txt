<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE STONE AGE OF KAMCHATKA AND THE CHUKCHI PENINSULA IN THE LIGHT OF NEW ARCHAEOLOGICAL DATA* N. N. DIKOV (Translated by Gerald H. Clark) During the last few years substantial progress has been made in the study of the archaeology of northeastern Siberia, especially in Kamchatka and the Chukchi Peninsula (Chukotka). The main stages in the development of the Stone Age in these areas is more definitely known than it was two or three years ago, prior to the investigations carried out by the Laboratory of Archaeology, History, and Ethnog- raphy of the Northeastern Joint Scientific-Research Institute. Our historical perspective has been con- siderably extended: not only the Neolithic, but also the Mesolithic roots of the cultures of the peoples of northeastern Siberia have now been ex- posed to the historian's view. The new archaeologi- cal data for the Northeast are important for the re- construction of its pre-Russian history; they also have international significance, since they shed some light on the problem of the first peopling of America. Field investigations in Kamchatka and Chukotka are not yet completed. Therefore this paper gives only preliminary conclusions based on the new data, combined into an integrated historical picture which takes into consideration all prior investigations. Archaeologically Kamchatka ceased long ago to be a blank spot on the map. S. P. Krasheninnikov (1755) observed a living Stone Age there in the mid- eighteenth century, gave a classic description of the primitive economy and social structure of the Kamchadal, Koryak, and Ainu, the principal inhabi- tants of Kamchatka at that time, and painted a clear picture of many long-lost ethnographic phenomena which are now the object of archaeological research. A hundred years after Krasheninnikov 's work spec- ialized surveys and excavations were needed to dis- cover traces of the Stone Age in Kamchatka. Such archaeological surveys were undertaken by the # Translated from Trudy Severo-Vostochnogo Kompleksnogo Nauchno-Issledovatel'skogo Insti- tuía, Vyp. 8, pp. 5-27. Magadan, 1964. following: K. Ditmar, in 1851-1855; N. Gondatti in 1898; P. D. Loginovskii at the beginning of the twen- tieth century; V. I. Jochelson in 1910-1911; the Japa- nese Yamada and Nakayama in 1923-1928 and 1932- 1933; I. Schnell, a member of the Swedish Botanical Expedition, in 1920-1922; N. A. Gur'ev, captain of the trawler Krasnoarmeets, in 1932; E. P. Ori ova in 1928; P. S. Smirnov in 1956; and A. V. Semenov in 1959-1960 (Ditmar 1901; Jochelson 1928; Schnell 1932; Nakayama 1933, 1934; Lev 1935; Orlova 1955). The excavations carried out by these individuals were as a rule executed in an amateurish and sometimes far from scientific manner. The only exceptions are the expeditions of Jochelson and Semenov, and to a cer- tain extent, of Schnell, for these men did not neglect to record field data. The outcome of all these ar- chaeological surveys was to discover only conspic- uous and comparatively recent remains, the so-called iurtovishcha, i.e. deep pits representing the remains of late Neolithic semi-subterranean dwellings. S. I. Rudenko (1964), V. V. Antropova (1949), and A. P. Okladnikov (1953a) have summarized the archaeo- logical material on Kamchatka, Okladnikov selecting from all the sites known at that time the older house pits of the Middle (Developed) Neolithic on the shores of Tar'ia Bay near Petropavlovsk. In 1961-62 the author carried out archaeological investigations in Kamchatka. Considering that the interior regions of Kamchatka were the least studied, surveys were conducted along the Penzhina River (in the Koryak National Okrug) and along the Kamchatka River, the banks of which were heavily populated by the Kamchadal as late as the eighteenth century (Fig. 1). Late Neolithic sites were investigated on the Penzhiña River; in the valley of the Kamchatka River, on the other hand, cultures considerably older than any previously known were discovered: Early Neolithic and even extending back into the Meso- lithic. A four-level site of ancient fishers was ex- cavated over a large area on the shores of Lake Ushki, which is connected with the Kamchatka River (Fig. 2). Its clear stratigraphy will serve henceforth as the basis for the periodization of the ancient cultures of Arctic Anthropology III-l, 1965 10</page><page sequence="2">Dikov: Stone Age of Kamchatka and the Chukchi Peninsula 11 Fig. 1.

The importance of the 1961-62 archaeological investigations on the Kamchatka River is not limited to the clearer delineation of the past of the peoples of the Kamchatka Peninsula. Equally important is the fact that a new method was developed to deter- mine the relative dating of cultural levels which are demarcated by ash horizons. The method of visual determination of the ash layers of Shiveluch Volcano was employed for the first time, allowing the identification of each of these layers with ash strata in a known stratigraphic section in the town of Kliuch, investigated by B. I. Piip (1948). This was facilitated by the fact that each ash layer of Shiveluch Volcano (Fig. 3) was easily differentiated either by color or by the presence or absence of accompanying volcanic sand. Thus it was possible to date or correlate a number of other Neolithic sites in the Kamchatka River valley with definite cultural horizons in the Ushki site, even in the cases where a section of a site contained perhaps only one or two Shiveluch ash layers. Inaccuracy in dating the Shiveluch ash horizons in the Kliuch section became apparent. Following the erroneous principle of determining age by the thickness of accumulations of loose ash, and incorrectly deter- mining the position of an excavated cultural stratum led B. I. Piip to date the upper ash of the Kliuch section to the year 1854, the second layer to 1810, the third to 1780, the fourth to the middle of the sixteenth century, and the fifth to the beginning of the fifteenth century. However, the cultural layer observed in the Kliuch section is situated not under the third ash layer (as Piip thought) but above the first. The author has repeatedly observed the same cultural stratum above the highest Shiveluch ash layer throughout the Kamchatka River valley. For this reason it is impossible to date the upper two ash layers to 1854 and 1810; the eruptions of Shive- luch which these two strata mark took place before the Russians settled here. Thus the three lower ash horizons are considerably older. The chronological scale, based on ash strati- graphy and refined by structural, chemical, and carbon- 14 analyses, is important for the periodiza- tion of the ancient cultures of Chukotka as well as of Kamchatka, since the ancient history of both these regions developed along similar lines. Until comparatively recent times only isolated objects of ancient culture were known from Chukotka, found by various travelers, none of whom were spec- ialists in archaeology: G. A. Sarychev, in 1787; A. E. Nordenskiold, A. Argentov, and N. Gondatti in the nineteenth century; and N. P. Sokol'nikov, D. E. Bettak, N. P. Borisov, and Rasmussen in the first quarter of the twentieth century (Nordenskiold 1936; Rudenko 1964; Sarychev 1952; Dikov, 1958b, 1961a). The honor of the first specialized, and highly productive, archaeological investigations in Chukotka belongs to Professor S. I. Rudenko. In 1945 he dis- covered a large number of ancient Eskimo settlements on the coast of the Chukchi Peninsula and in sum- marizing the work systematized the material into stages (Rudenko 1961). Next were excavations by A. P. Okladnikov (1947) near the mouth of the Kolyma River, by V. V. Naryshkin at the mouth of the Kan- chalan River (Okladnikov and Naryshkin 1955), and by D. A. Sergeev, M. G. Levin, R. V. Kozyreva and the author in the Uelen Cemetery (Dikov 1958; Ser- geev 1959; Levin 1964a, 1964b, 1962; Levin and Sergeev 1964; Arutiunov and Sergeev 1962, 1964). Mention should be made also of the chance discov- eries of N. N. Levoshin (Okladnikov 1950c), N. A. Grav (Okladnikov 1953b), I. A. Nekrasov and A. K. Saiapin (Okladnikov and Nekrasov 1959, 1962; Saiapin and Dikov 1958; Chard 1960b), A. A. Kalinin (1961), and K. V. Paraketsov and V. D. Lebedev (Dikov 1961d). In 1956-1959 the author carried out an archaeo- logical survey of two large rivers in the Chukchi National Okrug - the Anadyr and Amguema - and along a part of the Vankarem River and Lake Krasnoe (Dikov 1958a-e, 1959, I960, 1961a-d, 1963). The most remarkable site found was the Ust'-Belaia Cemetery, located at a former Neolithic campsite on the middle Anadyr River. Its importance for an under- standing of the prehistory of Chukotka is as great as that of the above-mentioned stratified Ushki site for the archaeology of Kamchatka. Even before the author's excavations in the Ust'- Belaia Cemetery (Dikov 1958a, 1958b) the supposi- tion was expressed that the inhabitants of the so- called continental Neolithic sites, dating from the end of the second to the beginning of the first mil- lennium B.C., were the ancestors not only of the Yukagir, as Okladnikov (1953b) and Levin (1963) feel, but also of the Chukchi. The discovery of an an- cient skull, similar to that of a Reindeer Chukchi, in burial 9 of the Ust'-Belaia Cemetery enables the author to more definitely assert that "the popula- tions of the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age of the northeast Asiatic Arctic can no longer be con- sidered as exclusively ancient Yukagir. They also influenced the formation of the ancestors of the Chukchi" (Dikov 1959). I. S. Vdovin (1950, 1961) holds a similar point of view, arrived at chiefly by means of linguistic data. In 1958 the author advanced the hypothesis that ancient Eskimo culture developed locally as a re- sult of adaptation to a drop in temperature beginning in the middle of the first millennium B.C. (Dikov 1958a, 1958b). At the same time M. G. Levin also arrived at the idea of a local origin for the Eskimo way of life, supporting his view on physical anthro- pological data. Subsequent excavations at the Ust1-</page><page sequence="4">Dikov: Stone Age of Kamchatka and the Chukchi Peninsula 13 Belaia cemetery give this hypothesis additional probability. We shall now turn to the general historical pic- ture, already fully established in its basic features, which the newest archaeological materials have elucidated. In Mesolithic times, roughly during the 9th-8th millennia B.C., Kamchatka was occupied by tribes of hunters and fishers. The lowest layer of the Ushki site, with a radiocarbon date of 10,675 ±360 years (Mo-345),1 yielded so-called "core-scrapers," or as they have recently been termed, "wedge-shaped cores" (Panichkina 1959). These small flint artifacts, roughly shaped on one side by narrow longitudinal facets while the other is like a wedge-like cutting edge, have much in common with similar objects appearing in the Upper Palaeolithic of Eastern Eu- rope and Southern Siberia and especially wide- spread in the Mesolithic over a vast territory from Sinkiang to the Soviet Maritime Territory and north- ern Japan (Teilhard de Chardin 1939; Okladnikov 1950). They occur also in Alaska (Nelson 1937). It is characteristic that nowhere in this territory (from Sinkiang to Alaska) are there any of the typi- cal western Mesolithic insert microblades of trape- zoidal or segment form. Perhaps the very small blades struck from the "core scrapers" served as a substitute. This constitutes a significant differ- ence characterizing the distinctive Asiatic-Ameri- can Mesolithic zone, and Kamchatka thus falls into this zone (Fig. 4). The Kamchatka "core scrapers" have the closest similarity to their analogs: the Shirataki core burins from the preceramic Neolithic of Hokkaido (Befu and Chard I960) (Fig. 5). Thus it is very likely that the Mesolithic technique of manufacturing "core scrapers" spread to Kamchatka from the Japanese Islands and thence to Alaska. The vastness of the distances between the ex- treme points in the diffusion of a single tool-type (Central Asia-Japan-Kamchatka-Alaska) fully cor- responds to the direction of the populating of Amer- ica from Asia and to the links which encompassed the Mesolithic and subsequently the early Neolithic world of hunters and fishers in post-glacial times. It was at just this time, under favorable climatic conditions, when the most intensive occupation of Kamchatka, Chukotka, and the whole of the Asiatic Far North must have occurred. Moreover, the settle- ment of people from the central, and earlier perhaps even from the southeastern regions of Asia, over these vast expanses of taiga and tundra evidently took place not as an organized march or migration across great distances, but through natural and con- tinuous detachment of small groups and their occu- pation of neighboring tracts of virgin wilderness. This was a very protracted process and nothing could stop such a slow and limitless dispersal of people. It makes no difference to the hunter where he wanders, so long as no insurmountable natural barriers arise and as long as there is game to hunt. Even a change in climate does not deter him, since it is scarcely perceived in the course of a slow, centuries-long movement. Finally, in the third to second millennia B.C. a rather homogenous material culture of Neolithic hunters and fishers was distributed over Kamchatka, Chukotka, and far to the east and west of this: from the Taimyr Peninsula to Hudson Bay and even as far as Greenland. To the early period of this culture on Kamchatka (5th-3rd millennia B.C.) we can assign the third level of the site located on the shores of fish-rich Ushki Lake;2 and on Chukotka, the oldest finds on Ust' -Belaia knoll, the Neolithic campsite and cemetery, and also the chance finds on the banks of theAmguema and IAkitikiveem Rivers. Characteris- tic of this early, non-ceramic Neolithic are first of all lamellar blades and prismatic cores, burins made from blades, and partially-retouched arrow points of obsidian or silicious rock shaped by delicate per- cussion and pressure flaking (Fig. 6, Nos. 6, 7, 8). In the second millennium B.C. the Neolithic of Northeast Siberia acquires a fully-developed as- pect: the first pottery and ground axes appear, along with a diverse assortment of stone knives, scrapers, arrow and spear points and similar articles, all manufactured with a high degree of skill. At this time the first significant local peculiarities in the technological development of Kamchatka and Chukotka also arise. Thus, in Kamchatka at this time the prep- aration of various types of figured stone knives^and scrapers, and even figurines of men and animals' fashioned by retouching, was widespread (Fig. 6, No. 3). The distinctive figured scrapers and knives (Fig. 6, No. 4), and also elongated adzes with pointed butts (Fig. 6, No. 5) were widely used on Kamchatka and spread thence to the Aleutian Islands. The cus- tom of decorating the lips with distinctive stone plugs or labrets, which was current in Kamchatka during this period, indicates the direction of cultural and most likely also of ethnic affinities. This cus- tom was later a widespread feature of Aleut and Es- kimo life, the only difference being that here the labrets were made chiefly of bone and walrus ivory. *A wet, cold climate is indicated by paly noi ogi- cal data, according to the author - Ed. According to recent information from the au- thor, palynological data suggest that this third level coincides with the postglacial climatic opti- mum - Ed.</page><page sequence="5">14 Arctic Anthropology III-l Fig. 3.

I. Jochelson, N. A. Gur'ev and D. N. Lev. Now, after our excavation of the second layer of the Ushki site and of the huge house pit at Kultuk on Ushki Lake in 1962, we can make more definite statements concerning the economic and social structure in Kamchatka during the Middle (Developed) Neolithic. The size of the dwelling at Kultuk (about 100 square meters) is explicable only on the assumption that it was occupied by a large clan collective, com- posed of several unsegregated conjugal families. The abundance of fish remains and stone projectile points indicates fishing and hunting as the chief economic pursuits. The Kultuk house pit is remi- niscent of the subterranean dwellings of the Kam- chadal in certain details of its construction: the same supporting posts for the roof, the same smoke hole, serving as an entrance. The general square form with rounded corners is comparable with the ancient round dwellings of the Aleuts. The labret found in the second stratum of the Ushki site has the form of a hat flattened on the sides; it is strik- ingly reminiscent of the largest male lip ornaments of the Aleut and Eskimo. It is no accident that pins with which to pierce holes in the lips for labrets were found near Petropavlovsk in Tar'ia Bay; and the name Tar'ia itself is a purely Eskimo toponym (Vdovin 1961). In the succeeding Late Neolithic, in the first millennium B.C., the subsequent formation of two differing economies takes place. In central and southern Kamchatka, among the ancestors of the Kamchadal, fishing predominated, while among the ancestors of the Koryak and Chukchi in Chukotka reindeer hunting developed. In Kamchatka the Late Neolithic has been re- constructed mainly from data derived from the upper horizon of the Ushki site, revealing a very clear picture of a fishing camp. A multitude of storage pits for fish surrounding a rather small pit house were discovered on the extensive area of a rocky cape, inhabited by fishermen since Mesolithic times. The deep accumulation of burned fish bones in the hearth of the house pit attests the prolonged human occupation of this fish-rich locality. A large supply of Oncorhynchus keta, O. kisutch and other varieties of large salmon were prepared here; and also sacrifices were offered to the patron-deity of the fishermen, probably quite similar to the Kam- chadal Khantai: half-fish, half-man, according to Krasheninnikov. Wood and birch bark fragments of a probable image of the deity, in fish form, were re- covered in a special pit under the remains of a tent built above it. Under and above the image were traces of sacrificial fires and at its head were the small bones of sacrificed fish heads. In addition to the campsite uncovered in the upper layer of the stratified Ushki site, there is a whole series of other Late Neolithic sites on the Kamchatka River (at Doiarki, near Kliuch', on Domashnoe Lake, and others). These sites have yielded stone adzes with rectangular sections (Fig. 6, No. 1), cores from which lamellar blades have been struck (Fig. 6, No. 2), scrapers, knives, arrow points, and other purely Neo- lithic artifacts. There is sufficient archaeological information to allow us to assume that all these sites belong to the ancestors of the Kamchadal, true fisher- men who densely populated the banks of the Kamchatka River down to the arrival of the Russians. Unfortu- nately, so far there is a complete lack of physical anthropological data. There is even greater basis for assuming that the common ancestors of the Chukchi, Koryak, and to a lesser degree of the Yukagir, lived in the interior regions of Chukotka and Northern Kamchatka. The skull from burial 8 of the Ust'-Belaia cemetery pre- serves traits both of the Arctic race (dolichocrania, high face, long nose, little projection of the nose bones) and to a lesser extent traits of the Baikal type of the North Asiatic race (orthognathism). The indefatigable Late Neolithic reindeer hunters of Chukotka preferred to live near the seasonal spring fords of the reindeer, conducting vast round-ups of the defenseless swimming animals, spearing them from boats with stone-tipped lances, much like those used in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries by the people on the Anadyr River. Because of the large population, a great variety of stone points for spears, arrows, and darts is found in the Ust'-Belaia ceme- tery, considerably more than is found in the Kam- chatka River sites. In addition to specialized hunt- ing weapons, the Late Neolithic Anadyr River people had at their disposal a great variety of other stone artifacts: scrapers for working hides, knives, pol- ished axes, adzes, and chisels for wood -working, especially for making dugout canoes. Since these people lived permanently near reindeer fords, they were also in a position to fish and even to hunt the pinnipeds which came up the Anadyr River from the sea. Thus, it was no accident that the bone head of a real toggle harpoon was found with burial No. 9 in the Ust'-Belaia cemetery, associated with a bronze blade and near stone artifacts typical of the Conti- nental Neolithic. In its main features it conforms in general to the ancient Eskimo type, but it is primi- tively made. It has a wide, open socket, one line hole, and no slots for stone side blades or tip (Fig. 7, No. 8). It resembles most closely certain rare har- poon points of the Palaeo-Eskimo Dorset Culture, which are also preserved to some extent in the Thule Culture. Its rather simple form and poor state of preservation creates an impression of great antiquity and it could well be considered as the oldest harpoon</page><page sequence="7">16 Arctic Anthropology III-l (0 $-1 &lt;0 - (D O Itfft O-hoo a o a^o oí: as*2 «Oí § -2 «S S § o J2 -' -Q a, ♦* -1 5.J2 o O w N ¿o ^ « E."S -' J2 « 01 4&gt; In 5 ^ i ^ JS -S • &lt; I ~ § a 5 • &lt; •§ 8 -' " la &lt;o d ~* HH S2, O So o 75 Oc&gt;^T3u,Df0 S S Q. 0 "S ü 5 S 3 I üljilií</page><page sequence="8">Dikov: Stone Age of Kamchatka and the Chukchi Peninsula 17 point yet known in Northeast Asia. Situated at the crossroads of the most impor- tant intercontinental routes between Asia and Amer- ica, the tribes of Chukotka and Kamchatka devel- oped from Mesolithic and very early Neolithic times under the influence of broad cultural links, a con- sequence of the relatively similar life of the hunt- ers, fishers and gatherers in the Old and New Worlds in the premetal period. These broad inter- continental cultural links continued to embrace the whole of northern and eastern Asia (including Chu- kotka and Kamchatka) in the Late Neolithic as well. The presence in the Ust'-Belaia cemetery and to some extent in the Late Neolithic sites on the Anadyr, Amguema, and Lake Chirovoe of the char- acteristic net-imprinted pottery, many types of ar- row points (Fig. 7, Nos. 1-6) and burins, white nephrite rings, tiny shell beads, and also the axes and adzes with a rectangular cross- section (Fig. 7, No. 7) which are widespread in the Neolithic over the whole Pacific zone of Asia (including Cis- Baikal), is indicative of cultural and possibly ethnic ties with more southerly regions of East Asia. Close ties are clearly visible with the Neolithic and Early Bronze Age of Yakutia. They are evident in the gen- eral appearance of the flint inventory, especially the arrow points. The result and culmination of these links was the diffusion of copper and bronze tools into Chukotka and Kamchatka from southern and eastern Siberia. Although only a very few of these have been recovered as yet (two engravers and a tetrahedral awl in the Ust'-Belaia burials, and a small copper artifact like a chisel from the upper horizon of the Ushki site) (Fig. 7, Nos. 9, 10), they all the same signify a turning point in the his- tory of the Far Northeast: the end of the Neolithic in the strict sense. The influence of metallurgy on the development of productive forces was, it is true, fleeting and superficial in Chukotka and even more so in Kamchatka. After the population of the southern portion of Siberia and the Lena River valley switched to stock raising, and in places even to agriculture, the distant continental cultural links between Chukotka and Kamchatka and the south were sharply curtailed. This resulted in the rever- sion of the Northeast from an incipient Bronze Age back to the Stone Age. But even in spite of this growing isolation, iron began to come into use, at first on the coasts and later in the interior of Chu- kotka and Kamchatka. Thus the Northeastern Neo- lithic, entering into its last phase which persisted down to the arrival of the Russians in the eighteenth century, acquired a "relict" character. From this time on, local differences become even more marked; at least five separate regions take form, differentiated by their distinctive archae- ological remains. In the extreme south of the Kam- chatka Peninsula a fishing people, probably the an- cestors of the Ainu, lived along the lakes and rivers in large villages. At least, their flat-bottomed clay cauldrons with peculiar interior lugs are strikingly reminiscent of those of the Ainu. Their semi-sub- terranean dwellings were rectangular; the smoke hole served as an entrance for the men, while a spec- ial tunnel entrance was dug specifically for women, children, and koekchuch (homosexuals or male sha- mans who had assumed the ways of women). A typi- cal village of this kind excavated by Jochelson on Cape Siwusk in volcano-rimmed Kuril Lake con- sisted of fifteen such dwellings. One was con- siderably larger than the rest. Scarcely any tools were found in it, leading one to believe that it may have served for community festivals ancü meetings. The smaller house pits contained many polished stone axes, obsidian and flint knives, scrapers, ar- row points, potsherds, one copper and ten iron ob- jects, and three Japanese coins of the eleventh cen- tury, or even later, in the opinion of the Japanese archaeologist Baba (Oswalt 1953; Levin 1963). The numerous little fortified settlements on the banks of the Kamchatka River belong to the ancestors of the Kamchadal, fishers like the ancestors of the Ainu. Their semi- subterranean houses were con- structed in the same manner, only they were rectan- gular, sometimes almost square, with rounded corners. The inhabitants of these settlements used containers of wood and birch-bark instead of clay pots, boiling water in them by dropping in heated stones. The settlements were often fortified with ramparts and ditches, frequently double or even triple. Usually one of the dwellings was of larger size, as in the Nikol'ski site excavated by the author, and as on Cape Siwusk it probably served as a ceremonial and meeting place. The ancestors of the Koryak lived on the north- ern Kamchatka Peninsula as far as the Penzhina River and beyond along the Okhotsk Coast. On their frontier with the Kamchadal (e.g., along' the Kulki and Kavran Rivers) they lived in fortified settlements enclosed by ditches and ramparts, but deep in their own territory, on the lower reaches of the Penzhina near Manily and on Capes Bol'shoi and Zelenyi, settlements were not fortified. Their pit houses are always round. Portable dwellings were erected only near reindeer crossings. The ancestral Koryaks knew how to fashion thin-walled, round -bottomed pottery, decorating it with textile imprints, with various deeply incised punctate or linear designs, and with ornamental relief bands (Fig. 8, Nos. 1, 2). Like their neighbors to the south, they made all sorts of tools and weapons of stone and knew how to polish and retouch it. They made wide use of oil lamps, sinkers, stone axes and adzes, arrow, dart and lance points, scrapers, and knives (Fig. 8). The Neolithic technique of striking lamellar blades from prismatic cores had not yet been lost, for we found a fragment</page><page sequence="9">18 Arctic Anthropology III-l ¿ s 1 | 8S3a M Ü ^ ^H °« g M Ü " ^ &amp; « C o »*E« iS.il 8 S " &gt;. ° S 5 2 o -e w lUS o -e I* ".us-?. ro I O ^ O 5 ^» 5 o . &lt; g-g o^ -3 x:</page><page sequence="10">Dikov: Stone Age of Kamchatka and the Chukchi Peninsula 19 of such a core of obsidian on the lower reaches of the Penzhina on Cape Bol'shoi (Fig. 9, No. 7), and one had been found in a house pit on the Kavran River (Jochelson 1928:50). They also manufactured various tools from bone: arrow points, hooks, mat- tocks, shovels, spoons, runners and other parts of dog sledges. Two pieces of iron and a fragment of a porcelain cup were found in a house pit on the Kavran River. In contrast to the fishers of central and southern Kamchatka, the ancestral Koryaks not only fished, but also hunted reindeer and, on occa- sion, sea mammals. The "Remnant" Neolithic3 in Chukotka takes on distinctive forms in the valley of the Main and Anadyr Rivers. Here one finds the unusual stone splitting adze, round in cross-section and having a sharp, conical butt, like a war axe; and here clay vessels of a distinctive form were made, often with stamped designs, which can be traced to the ceram- ics of the Late Bronze Age of Yakutia (Fig. 9). The Vakernaia and Chikaevo sites, both found on spits, belong to this Anadyr- Main culture. The rather thick cultural horizon of the Chikaevo site yielded particularly abundant material including many bone and stone artifacts and several iron items (a fire steel and fish- spear barbs), showing that fishers as well as hunters probably lived in the Anadyr- Main valley at this time. It is more than likely that these were the ancestral Yukagir, rather than the population of the developed and late Neolithic who preceded them in this area. The fifth region of the "Remnant" Neolithic comprised the coasts of the Chukchi Peninsula. Here great progress in economic development had been affected as early as the last centuries B.C. After the significant lowering of temperature the distinctive, highly developed culture of sea hunt- ers, ancestral Eskimo, arose in the Bering Strait region. It developed on the basis of the interior culture of the Arctic hunters and fishers who, as noted above, already had toggle harpoons at the be- ginning of the first millennium B.C. The drop in tem- perature and the resultant deforestation of the coast- al zone from the middle of the first millennium B.C. played a decisive role in the elaboration of a num- ber of such distinctive features of the culture of the Arctic sea-hunters as parka-type fur clothing; the semi- subterranean dwelling constructed of whale bone since wood was scarce; canopies of reindeer skin for sleeping, warmed by oil lamps; an intricate harpoon complex; and equipment for sea-hunting in- cluding large skin umiaks and small kayaks. All this could have and must have appeared at the con- fluence of the Pacific and Arctic Oceans, the loca- tion of the greatest abundance of sea mammals on earth, as the result of adaptation to new and more severe climatic conditions. The culture of the sea-hunters passed through four stages of development on Chukotka: Uelen- Okvik, Old Bering Sea, Birnirk (roughly from the fourth to fifth centuries, A.D.) and Punuk, named from the typesite (roughly from the seventh to ninth cen- turies A.D.). Each of these stages is based above all on toggle harpoon point typologies, the chief implement for hunting sea mammals, and on the art style en- graved on the harpoons and other bone implements. This style, at first restrained, underwent a remark- able efflorescence in the Old Bering Sea stage, showing refined and subsequently abundant combina- tions of curvilinear designs. During the Birnirk and Punuk stages, the motifs were markedly simplified due to influences from the interior of Chukotka: straight-line designs and the circle and dot motif came to predominate. Maritime hunting was perfected during the course of all four stages. If the coastal people hunted walrus, bearded and common seals from the start, they learned to kill whales in the Punuk stage, and possibly even somewhat earlier, courageously going out on the open sea in their umiaks. During Punuk times sedentary sea hunters settled along the whole of the Arctic coast of Chukotka and North America as far as Greenland, while the influence of their culture spread even farther, reaching at least to the Kuril Islands, as attested by finds of late type harpoons with closed socket on Kamchatka and Shu- mushu Island (Fig. 10). Iron, a precious commodity in the north, came into use as early as the Old Ber- ing Sea stage, although in negligible amounts. It was used only for very fine engraving tools, for use in incising designs on bone. The complex burial rites of the Uelen Cemetery reveal the substantial progress achieved in the evo- lution of social structure, a development already ob- servable in the Old Bering Sea period. The occur- rence of burials in the Uelen Cemetery with rich and poor grave goods tells us that the" clan structure had begun its protracted degeneration. The indications of unequal wealth are probably tied with the rise of shamanistic power. It is likely that the richest Old Bering Sea burials were those of shamans; not with- out reason do we find cult objects predominating in these graves - real masterpieces of the bone car- ver's art: all sorts of totemic symbols, sculptured images of female ancestors, often half-animal, half- human in form, as on the bone clasp illustrating a beaver with young (Fig. 11); and the invariable so- 3The term "Remnant" is retained for the sake of conformity with the author's English abstract.

Skillfully carved from walrus ivory in the form of a butterfly with spread wings, they have an opening for mounting on the end of a shaft. Two such "winged objects," recovered by the au- thor in 1956 from burials 2 and 4 of the Uelen Ceme- tery (Dikov 1958c), had separate bone parts spec- ially fastened to them, which must represent the butterfly's antennae (Fig. 12). The flat side of the wings is covered with intricate Old Bering Sea art motifs; on the reverse side are anthropomorphic de- signs, reproducing distinctly, but schematically, the female torso. Herein lies the solution to the use of these objects. In the mythology of the Chuk- chi the butterfly is a female destroyer of sea mam- mals (Lavrov 1958). In her aspect the "winged ob- jects" evidently depict the female ancestor, the ob- ject of the clan matriarchal cult. In the Punuk period the development of whale hunting effected a transi- tion to a patriarchal clan, and typically it is just at that time when the "winged objects," remaining shamans' attributes as before, lost their representa- tional nature and were transformed into the no less enigmatic "tridents" which have hitherto puzzled archaeologists. After the sea hunting way of life had spread along the coast as far as the Kolyma and the Sea of Okhotsk, a progressive development also took place among the tundra population of Chukotka and north- ern Kamchatka. On the one hand, a portion of the hunters and fishers, ancestors of the Chukchi and Koryak, settled on the coast and took up sea hunt- ing, while the rest, who were predominantly reindeer hunters, remained on the tundra and perfected a new form of economy: reindeer breeding. This develop- ment of nomadic reindeer herding, even though in very primitive form, introduced elements of social in- equality among the peoples of Chukotka and Kam- chatka, weakening the aboriginal communal struc- ture. Remains of fortifications and numerous traces of battles survive from this time. All these are signs of new relationships between people, characteristic of a period of growing military democracy. Subsequent progress and development in the his- tory of Kamchatka and Chukotka is tied up with the influence of Russian culture and lies outside the scope of the Neolithic. Analyzing the picture of historical development sketched above, it is easy to note the general ten- dency toward gradual local differentiation of the an- cient cultures. Thus, the vast Asiatic-American Mesolithic culture zone (Sinkiang to Alaska), char- acterized by the "core scraper," was superseded in Northeast Asia by the narrower Early Neolithic zone. Out of the latter, two culture areas developed in the Middle, "Developed," Neolithic - Chukotka and southern Kamchatka. They lasted into the Late Neo- lithic, although sharing many traits in common at this time. In the "Remnant" Neolithic at least five economic-cultural areas have already been isolated in this region. The formation of local differences in the econ- omy and culture of the territory under consideration reflects the processes of ethnic differentiation. Thus, in the Mesolithic there probably lived on Kamchatka tribes forming part of a vast ethnic community, char- acterized in Central Asia, southern Siberia, northern Japan, and Alaska by the "core-scrapers." The Palaeo-Asiatic language family (Chukchi-Koryak- Kamchadal) perhaps arose in the Early Neolithic (third horizon of the Ushki site). Remains of the middle Neolithic in southern Kamchatka (second hori- zon of the Ushki site, Tar'ia) can probably be related to Proto-Aleuts and to some extent, therefore, to the culture of the ancestral Eskimo as well. In the Late Neolithic it is likely that the two ethnic groups of Palaeoasiatics took form: Chukchi-Koryak, and Kam- chadal. In the "Remnant" Neolithic the demarcation of cultures corresponded to the distribution of the ancestors of the principal nationalities of the North- east, with the exception of the Lamut. The ancestors of the Ainu lived in southern Kamchatka, those of the Kamchadal along the Kamchatka River. The Eskimo inhabited the coast of Chukotka, and the Yukagir probably appeared in the basin of the Anadyr and Main Rivers at this time. They evidently wedged in between the Koryak and Chukchi, pushing the latter to the northeastern and northwestern regions of Chukotka, where they were found by the Russians in the seventeenth century. Wide cultural ties with America are evident in all the stages of prehistory surveyed above. They originate in the central and southeastern parts of Asia in the Mesolithic and Early Neolithic; later they are manifested in the spread of Eskimo culture. BIBLIOGRAPHY* Antropova, V.
