That it is written in English will greatly facilitate its use in Ethiopia. Aksum, in the highlands of Tigray in northern Ethiopia, was the capital of a major state during the first seven or eight centuries A.C. Its local precursors and antecedents during the last millennium B.C. have been a particular fo- cus of the research conducted by Bard and Fattovich. The area thus contains important archaeological remains illus- trative of the development and florescence of a major African civilization. Despite Aksum's designation by UN- ESCO as a World Heritage Site, comparatively little ar- chaeological field research has been undertaken there. Sad- ly, much of what has been undertaken remains incom- pletely or inaccessibly published. Aksum today is a town of some size which attracts growing numbers of pilgrims and tourists, as well as being the administrative center for the rapidly developing Cen- tral Zone of Tigray. The Ethiopian authorities are aware of the major problem presented by the need to ensure ade- quate conservation of the heritage without unnecessary im- pediment to ongoing economic development. The short- age of trained and experienced Ethiopian personnel is, however, a serious impediment to appropriate manage- ment of this uniquely important heritage. The book under review is an extremely useful contribu- tion to resolving this dilemma. Fattovich and his collabo- rators have assembled a large amount of information, from published sources and the results of their own fieldwork, concerning archaeological sites in the Aksum area. Much of their data is derived from the work of others (including this reviewer) which has often been reported only in prelimi- nary publications. As a result, there are certain unresolved discrepancies, as when conflicting dates are suggested for a single site de- pending on which preliminary report is under citation, or when the locations of sites are imprecisely specified result- ing in uncertain correlations between different accounts. Despite these imperfections, the work will provide an ex- cellent basis both for management of the local archaeolog- ical heritage and for the planning of future research. Full bibliographic details are provided, although in the case of the ongoing research many references are to unpublished reports that have been submitted to the Ethiopian author- ities. Overall, the utility of the work is reduced by the poor quality and small scale of its maps.

In this publication of his 1996 doctoral dissertation, Cyprian Broodbank attempts nothing less than to rewrite the early prehistory of the Cycladic islands, a chain of sev- eral dozen small- to medium-sized islands in the middle of the Aegean Sea east of the modern Greek mainland. The Cycladic islands are significant for the study of coloniza- tion from neighboring mainlands because they witnessed a series of impressive societies known for their material cul- ture (e.g., Cycladic marble figurines, which furnish a sad example of irrevocable damage to cultural heritage fueled by the antiquities market) and for their maritime orienta- tion. The book focuses on the Neolithic and Early Bronze</page><page sequence="2">226 Book Reviews Age (EBA) periods, beginning with the first tangible hu- man occupation of the Cyclades and ending with the ad- vent of external domination of the islands from Minoan Crete, i.e., calibrated to roughly 5200-1900 B.C. The au- thor's primary aim is to develop an "island archaeology" of the Cyclades that is more detailed and explanatory than previous syntheses. This remarkable work succeeds in part because Broodbank is an innovative thinker and a fine and careful archaeologist. Chapter 1 provides the reader with a concise theoretical outline, and introduces some of the central concepts that frame the discussion of the archaeological data and histor- ical sequences in subsequent chapters. Broodbank explores the intellectual foundations of other island studies, partic- ularly the well-developed island archaeologies of the Pacif- ic. His perspective on the uniqueness of islands as objects of study is encapsulated in his concept of"islandscape" em- bracing the notions of seascape and landscape in an insular context and providing the physical and cognitive template for the subsequent analysis. A most important position that emerges is Broodbank's rejection of the notion of is- lands as bounded units of analysis. In fact, the scale and res- olution of analysis set this study apart; unlike previous studies that have focused either on individual islands as units of study, or on islands as parts of broader, pan- Aegean or pan-Mediterranean systems, Broodbank directs his gaze at intermediate, intra-Cycladic dynamics with en- lightening results. This chapter would benefit from fuller integration into the subsequent text. It reads like a grab- bag of theoretical considerations, linear and reticulate his- tories, human agency and contingency, world-systems the- ory and annales history, and phenomenology, many of which are not linked explicitly to the ensuing analysis. In Chapter 2, Broodbank establishes the Cyclades first as an appropriate case study for island archaeology and sec- ond as sufficiently different from other island groups that unique models and approaches are required. Broodbank justifies a distinct Cycladic approach by contrasting condi- tions and historical trajectories of the Cyclades with those of the Pacific islands. The longer and more remote human history of the Cyclades renders the ethnographic baseline that is so useful in the Pacific of little relevance, in the au- thor's estimation, to understanding Cycladic prehistory. There are also significant disparities in resources and phys- ical landscapes. With virtually no tides, the Aegean lacks in- tertidal resources that were often vital to Pacific islanders; and the closer physical communication with surrounding mainlands and intervisibility of islands within the Cycladic chain entail potentially very different interaction networks. The chapter concludes with a clear overview of the history and current state of prehistoric archaeology in the Cy- clades. Broodbank outlines the one hundred year history of archaeological exploration in the Cyclades, highlighting the central issues and sorting out the often-confusing chronological and cultural terminologies. In Chapter 3, Broodbank discusses overarching themes that structured island life in the Neolithic-EBA Cyclades, asking how the inhabitants forged livelihoods given the physical and social realities of island life. Most of the Cy- cladic islands are beset by problems of scarce fresh water and arable soil, and mineral resources are few and uneven- ly distributed. The earliest colonizers of the Cyclades pos- sessed a Neolithic agricultural and pastoral package im- ported from the surrounding mainlands that included wheat and barley, and sheep and goat. This environmental baseline exerted a profound effect on islanders' adaptive re- sponses. Broodbank examines the evidence for demogra- phy, concluding that exogamy, exchange, and other forms of interdependence among the Cycladic islands were indis- pensable for the survival of early Cycladic communities. Given these circumstances, Broodbank emphasizes early seafaring technology and performance as critical variables in islanders' responses to challenging environmental con- ditions. He concludes this chapter with an excellent dis- cussion of the conditions of early seafaring in the Cyclades, including the limitations imposed by winds, currents, and existing boat technology. The evidence for seacraft, small canoes, and larger "longboats" is mainly iconographic, and their performance is deduced from recent experiments as well as ethnographic observation of similar boats in other parts of the world. Having set out the theoretical and historical context, Broodbank devotes the rest of the book to a detailed chronological analysis of the archaeological data and to the development of interpretive models through which the da- ta might be better understood. Whereas Broodbank takes great pains to show that life in the Neolithic-EBA Cyclades was fundamentally different from modern Aegean life, he also insists that it need not be unintelligible to us. This po- sition is consonant with how Broodbank steers a "middle way" between processual and postmodern approaches; he is sympathetic to the innovations and critiques of the latter while sharing the former's optimism that meaning can be extracted from empirical data through proper methods and approaches. In the fourth and fifth chapters, Broodbank tackles the colonization of the islands, from the earliest exploration through the eventual establishment of viable, long-lived communities. This was a long and complex process, as wit- nessed by the fact that some five or six millennia passed be- tween the earliest known visitation of the Cyclades to ex- ploit obsidian sources. Melian obsidian was found in 1 lth-</page><page sequence="3">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 28, 2001 227 millennium levels at Franchthi Cave on the Greek main- land and at the first archaeologically visible Cycladic settle- ments of the Late Neolithic. Broodbank uses colonization models to portray a long sequence of discovery, exploita- tion, colonization, and establishment of viable populations with successes, reverses, and demographic changes that may be explained by historical contingency as much as by environmental imperative. Chapter 5 concludes with a de- tailed synthesis of the earliest Cycladic cultures-Saliagos, Kephala, and Grotta-Pelos-which arose in succession be- tween ca. 5200 and 2700 B.C. Broodbank regards them all as reciprocity-based egalitarian societies, but outlines im- portant distinctions among them and changes over time. The Saliagos (Late Neolithic) settlements are found main- ly on the larger islands, closely associated with the best arable land. Although the overall population was low and communities were separated by considerable distances, the settlements were large (typically supporting 75-150 peo- ple), and already long-distance overseas connections were in place. The early Final Neolithic Kephala culture contin- ued many of these trends with extra-Cycladic contacts very much in evidence in "style zones" involving the Cycladic is- lands and much of the Aegean. New features included community cemeteries and a novel concern for placing set- tlements in defendable locations. In the later Final Ne- olithic and Early Bronze I, the Grotta-Pelos culture wit- nessed much more profound changes. Settlements were now much more numerous but very small; they were dis- persed widely over available pockets of arable land and for the first time on the smallest islands. The shift to smaller settlements is seen by the author as a more flexible adapta- tion to environmental conditions and marginal zones, and indeed these small sites tend to fade out every few genera- tions. Along with the infilling of Cycladic islandscapes, lo- cal exchange networks replace the former long-distance re- lationships, which are now rare. The Grotta-Pelos culture also provides a first glimpse at the individual in Cycladic prehistorr: inequity in grave goods, and individualistic treatments of bodily features on anthropomorphic fig- urines, suggest that some individuals held special status within the community. Broodbank speculates that seafarers may have derived elevated status from their skill in long- distance voyaging, as well as from the exotic goods to which they had access. Early Bronze II (ca. 2700-2200 B.C.) is the best-known period in Cycladic prehistory, and Broodbank devotes Chapters 6 through 9 mainly to an examination of its dy- namics. This half-millennium witnessed the emergence of a handful of large "centers" that apparently controlled ac- cess to raw materials, craft technology, maritime contacts, and objects possessing prestige value. The prominent fea- tures of these centers included large populations; skilled craft production in stone, metal, and ceramic; evidence of wide maritime contacts; and conspicuous consumption (via burial) of prestige objects, including fine pottery, met- al jewelry and weapons, and marble figurines and vessels. Broodbank characterizes these centers as nodes of interac- tion, but also of social power, which resided not in organi- zational structures but in individuals who achieved status with the exercise of marine prowess or craft skill. These centers arose, according to Broodbank, by virtue of popu- lation growth at nodes of good overseas connection. He eschews other explanations, such as access to extensive arable land, mineral resources, or superior harbors. The Early Bronze II phenomenon continues the trend away from low-density, open networks of maritime con- tact, toward high-density, regionally focused networks with only selective long-distance relationships. Broodbank detects deliberate attempts to form distinct, sub-regional identities that he terms "small worlds." He cites the exam- ple of southern Naxos, Amorgos, and the small Erimonisia island group as one such small world, which by virtue of topographic and environmental similarity, as well as shared material culture and contacts, became an integrated island- scape. In Chapters 10 and 11, Broodbank rounds out his chronological account with the "end" of Cycladic early his- tory, a period of internal disruption and transformation of island life in Early Bronze III (ca. 2200-1950 B.C.), fol- lowed by the initiation of external domination of the Cy- clades from Minoan Crete (ca. 1950-1900 B.C.). In Early Bronze III, for reasons that are not yet clear, small and large settlements were destroyed or abandoned, most nev- er to be reoccupied. A shift in the settlement pattern took place, from the limited number of Early Bronze II seafar- ing centers dominating networks of small, dispersed com- munities to a much smaller number of nucleated settle- ments. Broodbank reviews a range of hypotheses that have been advanced to explain the phenomenon: external inva- sion, land abuse, and catastrophic climate events affecting areas from the Middle East to the Aegean in the later 3rd millennium. He also considers intra-Cycladic processes such as internal competition among the Early Bronze II centers, and epidemic disease. In the end, however, he fa- vors the introduction of sailing technology, with its atten- dant transformation of seafaring and maritime interac- tions, as a primary cause. By increasing the speed, range, direction, and cargo capacity of sea-going vessels, the new sailing ships effectively shrank the Mediterranean, and the Aegean then irreversibly took its place in a wider world. In this new world, sailing ships could transport large loads of staple foods swiftly enough that they would not spoil, but</page><page sequence="4">228 Book Reviews they also required proper anchorages. These and other con- sequences redefined networks according to new priorities, negating the bases of the Early Bronze II centers' power and prominence. The earliest introduction of the sailing ship in the Aegean probably occurred on Crete, and Broodbank im- plicates sailing technology as a factor in Minoan state for- mation, already underway during Early Bronze III. By ca. 1950 B.C., the Cyclades were for the first time oriented to- ward an external power, as the Aegean islands became a pe- riphery to the core of the Minoan palaces. The details of this transformation remain unclear, but Broodbank points to the Phylakopi settlement on Melos, phase I, as crucial because it is almost unique in straddling the transition from the end of Early Bronze II to the onset of Minoan domination. The final chapter of the book is a brief re- statement of issues and conclusions. Broodbank's framework for understanding and explain- ing this long cultural sequence is a network analysis model (presented in Chapter 6) that structures his discussion of patterns of interaction across the entire period under con- sideration. He constructs a Proximal Point Analysis (PPA) for the purpose of simulating interaction networks given certain assumptions about the locations and numbers of in- teracting settlements. Briefly, PPA predicts patterns of con- nections between points distributed in space. Convention- ally, each point connects with the three points closest to it. The webs formed by these connections generate networks, as some points accumulate more links by virtue of their proximity to a larger number of other points. In certain ar- eas, denser webs emerge that hypothetically mark out in- teraction "centers" where communications ought to flow most easily. Of course, models of this sort are laden with assumptions, simplifications, and choices that may bias the final results. In this case, it is assumed that communities in- teract most intensely with their nearest neighbors, as longer journeys are riskier and more time-consuming. Sea travel is taken as uniform in all directions for the purpose of analysis, and all sites are deemed equal-that is, no site hierarchy is superimposed. The actual placement of points is a thorny problem given the incomplete nature of the ar- chaeological record. Broodbank chooses to start from the locations of known settlements, and from that baseline he increases the number of points to simulate the expansion of population over time. This is accomplished by varying the amount of land area required to place one point on an island. Broodbank creates four different models (PPA 1-4) by placing a point for every 150, 100, 75, and 50 sq km, respectively. Varying this parameter changes the resulting networks significantly. PPA 1, with only 19 points, appears to resemble the Neolithic-Early Bronze I pattern of low density settlement and provides a visual explanation for the need for larger settlements and longer-distance contacts than in later periods. On the other hand, the more heavily populated and highly connected Early Bronze II is reflect- ed best in PPA 4, which features 54 points yielding more localized, high-density networks and maximal small-island involvement. Is PPA more than an interesting heuristic exercise that is, furthermore, susceptible to manipulation to achieve de- sired results? The answer hinges on the rules and parame- ters set, since PPA does nothing more than connect dots. Broodbank explains transparently the inputs he chooses and the interpretations he places on the results, allowing the skeptical reader a fair chance at critique. I was con- vinced that PPA did yield some enlightening insights, par- ticularly in helping to explain the presence or absence of centers around the Cyclades. For example, no such center is yet known on the large island of Andros, which, in spite of apparent advantages in fresh water and arable land, is poorly connected in the PPA model. Conversely, the set- tlement of Daskaleio-Kavos thrived as an Early Bronze II center despite its location on the small island of Keros in the resource-poor Erimonisia group; this center is ad- mirably explained in PPA by its position in a dense web of network connections. PPA demonstrates that connectivity exerted a fundamental influence on centrality, but, as Broodbank acknowledges, it fails to explain all occur- rences. A fortified settlement at Chalandriani-Kastri on Sy- ros emerged in Early Bronze II despite being rather poor- ly linked to the rest of the Cyclades; in this and similar cas- es archaeologists must seek alternative explanations. Nev- ertheless, if the logic behind Broodbank's reconstruction of Cycladic networks is valid, PPA may have predictive po- tential for site location as archaeologists work to fill in spa- tial and temporal gaps. The perspectives offered inAn Island Archaeology have a wider utility in coastal archaeology. Archaeologists investi- gating the mainland coastlines of the Aegean have devel- oped approaches along rather similar lines, because coastal inhabitants, particularly those on rugged shores where communication is easier by sea than over land, confront problems and devise solutions similar to those of island dwellers. At the same time, communities in the interior of large islands may have little contact with the sea, and their behavior may be more analogous to inland dwellers else- where than to their coastal island brethren. Understanding Broodbank's approach as exclusive to islands is perhaps limiting, particularly when one moves beyond the special conditions of initial island colonization. There is a great deal to be learned, taking a complementary perspective, about the ways in which mainland coastal communities</page><page sequence="5">Journal of FieldArchaeology/Vol. 28, 2001 229 were influenced by, and integrated with, island cultures in the prehistoric Aegean. This is even more true with the ad- vance of seafaring technology in the historical periods. This book is professionally and attractively produced. Broodbank's prose is clear and elegant with only a few, mi- nor typographical errors. The figures are attractive, infor- mative, and fully explained in detailed captions, marred on- ly by the washed-out appearance of some computer-gener- ated maps using grayscale or gray backgrounds. The book is also available in paperback. It is not possible in a short review to do justice to the complexity of this work or to the sheer number of issues addressed and new interpretations proposed. It is a land- mark contribution in that it offers a new synthesis based on a careful and current reading of the archaeological data and because it issues a challenge to look at Cycladic prehistory in vigorous new ways. This book will surely have a pro- found effect on the investigation of Cycladic prehistory, taking its place among works like Colin Renfrew's classic The Emergence of Civilisation (Renfrew 1972)--which Broodbank's volume essentially updates-that appear about once a generation and redefine the agenda of an en- tire field of archaeological inquiry. New projects will be conceived and grant proposals written specifically to test (or contest) Broodbank's models or to fill in lacunae bear- ing upon them. An Island Archaeology of the Early Cyclades will be required reading for Aegean prehistorians, but Broodbank's ideas and methods should resonate with all those engaged in island, coastal, or maritime archaeologies.

Because Grahame Clark died only in 1995, there has so far been little in-depth critical assessment of his work. Yet, beginning in the 1930s, he played a key role in transform- ing prehistoric archaeology from being an amateurish pur- suit, preoccupied with artifact classification, into a multi- disciplinary enterprise. He also devoted the whole of his academic life to professionalizing the training of British ar- chaeologists. Through his publications and the work of his students, Clark influenced the practice of archaeology in many parts of the world. The lack of study of his work has left a major lacuna in understanding the overall develop- ment of archaeology during the 20th century. Fagan's bi- ography of Clark, written at the request of Clark's literary executors but carefully avoiding hagiography, is a welcome contribution to filling this gap. Fagan has written an intellectual rather than a personal biography. He seeks to acquaint readers with Clark's ideas by judiciously summarizing Clark's books and major sci- entific papers and relating them to Clark's professional ac- tivities. While caring and generous in his private life, Clark the archaeologist tended to be an austere, remote, and crit- ical individual, who intimidated his students (including Fagan) and many fellow archaeologists. While Fagan aims his assessment of Clark's contributions to archaeology at "working scholars with a general interest in the develop- ment of archaeology," [p. xiii] his book permits a clearer understanding of the history of prehistoric archaeology not only in Britain but also in America and elsewhere. The Scandinavians who pioneered the development of prehistoric archaeology in the first half of the 19th century sought to use the material remains of the past to document how culture in general had evolved, what sorts of peoples had inhabited their national territories at various periods of prehistory, and how different peoples had lived in the past. Each of these questions became the basis of a different sort of archaeology: evolutionary, culture-historical, and func- tional-processual. A growing interest in how cultures func- tioned and changed became evident in British archaeology during the 1920s. Throughout his long academic career, Clark unswervingly pursued a functionalist approach. In 1939 he redefined archaeology as "the study of how men [humans] lived in the past" (Clark 1939: 1). In the first two chapters, Fagan traces Clark's life from birth until completion of his doctoral dissertation. Clark was born in 1907 into an upper-middle class family that encouraged a strong work ethic and notions of public ser- vice. Early on he developed an interest in collecting pre- historic stone tools and by the time he left Marlborough College, a well-known private school, to attend Cambridge University, he was determined to become a professional ar- chaeologist. At Cambridge he developed an interest in the Mesolithic period and published The Mesolithic Age in Britain (1932), a typical culture-historical study modelled on the early work of Gordon Childe.
