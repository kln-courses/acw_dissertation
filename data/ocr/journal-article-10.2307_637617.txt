<plain_text><page sequence="1">CLEOPATRA AS FATALE MONSTRUMI (HORACE, CARM. I. 37. 21) THE pregnant phrase fatale monstrum comes at a crucial point in the third and longest of the three sentences of the 'Cleopatra Ode'.2 Before it Cleopatra is being hissed from the stage of history with cries of disapproval; after it she is recalled to receive plaudit after plaudit for her courage and resolution. The phrase is emphasized by its position at the start of a stanza followed by a marked pause. Prima facie it is the climax of the vituperation, and has often so been taken. T. E. Page, for example, comments: 'Horace speaks of Cleopatra as not human, but a hideous and portentous creature sent by destiny to cause horror and alarm.'3 And R. Syme (The Roman Revolution, p. 275) writes: 'The propaganda of Octavianus magnified Cleopatra beyond all measure and decency. To ruin Antonius it was not enough that she should be a siren: she must be made a Fury-' fatale monstrum" '.4 We must then suppose that having said his worst our fickle poet turns suddenly to compliment: quae generosius ... nec muliebriter expavit ensem, etc. An abrupt transition, may be, but is not Horace full of such ? I shall argue that this view of the phrase is too one-sided to be adequate. I shall try to show that fatale monstrum contains shades of meaning and overtones of association which redeem it from sheer abuse and fit it to be the pivot on which Horace swings from censure to panegyric.s Horace uses monstrum in five other places in the Odes, and once in the I The most recent discussion of the ode known to me is by Mr. Steele Commager (Phoenix xii [1958], 47-57). He regards the similes of vv. 17-20 'as a kind of pivot divert- ing our sympathies from Caesar to Cleopatra (p. 48)'. On the meaning of fatale monstrum he simply refers to E. Fraenkel's treatment (Horace, p. I6o). I agree entirely with his penetrating observations on the structure and movement of the ode, and with his verdict that 'the transition is meditated rather than impulsive, and the Ode's second half answers the first in contrapuntal detail (p. 50)'. I differ from him in locating the 'pivot' in fatale monstrum rather than in the similes, and attempt to justify this by draw- ing out the implications of the phrase in greater detail than has hitherto been done. 2 In the punctuation of Wickham and Klingner. Keller and Holder make four sentences with a full stop after monstrum, while Kiessling-Heinze treat the whole ode as 'eine groBe Periode'. If Kiessling-Heinze are right this will be the longest sentence in the Odes. The next longest appears to be Carm. 4. 4. 1-28, which also shows a central and focal phrase in bella . .. Drusum gerentem (vv. I7-18). These periods in their stately complexity resemble single-sentence sonnets like Keats's 'Bright star . . .'. 3 Edition, ad loc. Cf. F. G. Doering in his edition (Glasgow, 1826): horrendae et in- auditae cupiditatis mulierem, fato quodam a diis iratis Romano imperio immissam, quam graviter! 4 W. C. Grummel (C.J. xlix [1953-4], 360) actually states that Cleopatra was de- scribed asfatale monstrum in the 'propaganda war preceding Actium'. He appears to sug- gest that Horace prepared his transition by using a notoriously jingoistic phrase which his more liberal readers would mentally put in inverted commas: that 'deadly monster', as she was called, but she wasn't really so despicable after all. But this account would make the use of the phrase ironical, and irony appears to be quite out of keeping with the tone of the ode. s This paper was already well advanced when I found that F. Arnaldi (Orazio, Odi ed Epodi, 4th"edn., Milan, 1956) has emphasized fatale monstrum as the key phrase in the ode. He begins his introduction to the ode as follows: 'Il centro logico e sentimentale dell' alcaica e fatale monstrum (v. 21) che non vuol dire soltanto "mostro fatale" ma sintetizza il problema umano e storico di quella creatura, donna, femmina sino alla follia regina, sino all'eroismo.' He does not, however, develop the meaning and associations of the phrase as explicitly as I try to do in what follows.</page><page sequence="2">252 J.V. LUCE Epodes.' In none of these passages is the word particularly abusive or deprecia- tory.2 Monstra natantia in (2) are simply sea-monsters. Nova monstra in (i) refer to the portentous and unnatural happenings at the time of Deucalion's Flood, when Proteus led his 'cattle' up the mountains and fish roosted in elm trees. The turgid phrase in (6) refers to unions contra naturam. In (3), iniecta monstris Terra dolet suis, the 'monsters' are the earth-born giants and Titans. In (5) monstrum means the armed warriors springing from the dragon's teeth, and is used to illustrate Rome's unexpected resurgence in adversity. In (4) the remorse- ful Europa says: frangere enitar modo multum amati / cornua monstri (v.1. tauri). (4) is the closest to our passage, as monstrum is used of a 'person'. The epi- thet amati shows that the bull was not wholly hateful to Europa because 'she has learnt long ago that it was not merely what it seemed' (Wickham, ad loc.). Fatale monstrum, like amati monstri, is a daring phrase, and needs careful in- vestigation. Translators have clearly sensed that the phrase is many-sided, and are far from unanimous in their interpretation. A random survey yielded the following selection: the blunt 'that monster' (Lord Dunsany); the pedestrian 'le monstre elu de destin' (Villeneuve in the Bud6 edition) ; the comminatory 'accursed monster' (Bennett in the Loeb edition); the decorous 'fateful Dame' (Gladstone); the chivalrous 'wondrous prize' (Lord Derby); the arch (and not unperceptive) 'fair and fatal pest' (Sir T. Martin). Porphyrion's note reports two interpretations, but these relate to the mean- ing of fatale rather than of monstrum.3 In general, editorial comment has not been very copious or illuminating. E. Fraenkel, however, has some important remarks on the meaning of monstrum in his discussion of the ode (Horace, p. 16o). He says that it 'probably contains less of what we hear in "monster" and more of what a Greek heard in r~'pas, a Roman in portentum or prodigium, something outside the norm of nature, something at which we look with wonder and often with horror' (my italics). He supports this opinion with four quotations from Cicero in which monstrum, portentum, and prodigium are used as virtual synonyms. He then proceeds: 'To fatale monstrum there is appended a long relative period: it fills the last three stanzas of the ode. The feeling of horror recedes, andadmiration takes its place' (my italics). The two passages I have italicized seem to make it clear that in Fraenkel's view our phrase by its complex associations assists the transition from horror to admiration. With this I entirely agree, but Fraenkel's analysis could be more explicit. What do we hear in 'monster' ? What did a Roman hear in portentum or prodigium ? Fraenkel appears to stress the religious associations of monstrum and to play down its depreciatory sense, but in the Cicero passages which he adduces monstrum is used as a term of unmitigated abuse. I turn to consider another passage in Cicero which seems to me to provide an apt illustration of Horace's use of monstrum, but which has never, so far as I know, been adduced in this connexion. It comes in thepro Caelio where Cicero is reflecting on the character and career of Catiline, and for once finding some good to say about him.4 He allows that Catiline had the rudiments of many I For convenience of reference I number them as follows: (I) Carm.

Though viciously lustful he was a good soldier. At one moment the favourite of the nobility, at another hand in glove with criminals, he alternated between loyalty and hostility to the Establishment. He was a pleasure-seeker, yet able to bear hardship, greedy for gain, yet generous in largesse. In short he exhibited a natura varia et multiplex. (We are reminded of Cleopatra's 'infinite variety'.) In the context of this elaborately antithetical delineation it is striking to find Cicero using monstrum to characterize this Catiline who both attracts and repels him: Neque ego unquam fuisse tale monstrum in terris ullum puto, tam ex contrariis diversisque atque inter se pugnantibus naturae studiis cupiditati- busque conflatum. Catiline was a 'freak' (R. G. Austin's rendering), a strange blend of mutually hostile inclinations and desires. It is my contention that Horace was using monstrum of Cleopatra in a similar sense. He was using it, not as a term of opprobrium, but rather to signalize the complexities and contradictions in her character and career. Centrally placed in his portrait monstrum looks back to her failings and foreshadows her virtues. Cicero concludes his sketch of Catiline with the words: Neque unquam ex illo delendi huius imperi tam consceleratus impetus exstitisset, nisi tot vitiorum tanta immanitas quibusdam facilitatis et patien- tiae radicibus niteretur. In reflecting on the life and death of Cleopatra, Horace, I believe, reached a similar conclusion. To the average Roman Cleopatra's career must have seemed a monstrum in the old religious sense, i.e. something strange, unnatural, and ominous of misfortune. Here was a woman, the offspring of a brother-sister union and herself incestuously married, a queen with the attributes of divinity and the reputation of a whore, who had the effrontery to captivate 'the noblest Roman of them all', and the audacity to plan the overthrow of Rome with a Roman army.' Horace had reflected on the 'monstrosity' of this situation, and draws atten- tion to the religious and historical implications of Cleopatra's designs by the epithetfatale. Another passage in the Odes helps to determine the meaning of fatale here.2 In the third 'Roman Ode' Juno begins her speech with the emphatic pronouncement: Ilion, Ilion fatalis incestusque iudex et mulier peregrina vertit in pulverem... Paris isfatalis in that through the workings of divine justice his actions brought destruction on the Trojans.

In discussing the parallel structure of the 3rd and 5th 'Roman Odes', Fraenkel remarks on 'the streams of Greek myth and of Roman history flowing into a common bed'.2 Infatale monstrum I see these two streams interfused in a single phrase. By describing Cleopatra asfatale monstrum Horace, I believe, was evoking the lore of those abnormal monsters that abound in Greek myths, Hydra, Gorgon, Cerberus, Scylla, Sphinx, Chimaera, and the like. It is one of the functions of heroes to kill, capture, or subdue such monsters. This mythical theme must surely have been in Horace's mind when he expresses Octavian's goal in the bellum Actiacum as: daret ut catenisfatale monstrum.3 It does not seem to have been noticed that in Epistles 2. I. 11 Horace describes the labours of Hercules in a way strikingly reminiscent of our present phrase: Notaque fatali portenta labore subegit. And there, of course, Hercules is a prototype of Augustus.4 In the poetry and propaganda of the period the struggle against Antony and Cleopatra was represented as 'an ideological conflict between barbarism and civilization, East and West.'s It was regarded as a holy war in which the great gods of the Greco-Roman pantheon were opposed by latrator Anubis,6 the anthropomorphic by the theriomorphic. Now composite monsters like Sphinx and Chimaera show the influence of oriental art and imagination. In calling Cleopatra monstrum Horace may well have had in mind some such multiform and exotic creature. She was in truth afemmefatale, one of the long line from Homer's Sirens to Heine's Lorelei, who lured voyagers to their doom. And Octavian as he rushes to subdue her, remis adurgens, is in the tradition of all monster killers from Apollo and the Python to St. George and the Dragon.7 It is interesting to observe that Horace uses triformis Chimaera of the girl to whom Opuntiae frater Megillae is bound in hopeless and not so honourable infatuation (Carm. I. 27. 23-4): Vix illigatum te triformi Pegasus expediet Chimaera.8 This shows that he was ready to 'point a moral' from the Bellerophon myth, x M. Renard, 'Horace et Clopatre' in ttudes horatiennes (Brussels, 1937), pp. 189- 99, seems to take fatale monstrum simply as meaning that Cleopatra was 'une calamite publique' (p. 199). He refers to Porphyrion's note, for which see p. 221, n. 3. In the same spirit is Shakespeare's: 'The death ofAntony/ is not a single doom; in the name lay / a moiety of the world.' Ant. &amp; Cl. v. i. 17-19.- 2 Op. cit., p. 267. 3 Is there a hint of this in Porphyrion's fatis sibi destinatum ? 4 Cf. Carm. 3. 3- 9-12; 3. 14. 1-4- s Steele Commager, art. cit., p. 53, who gives detailed references. 6 Virg. Aen. 8. 698. Cf. Prop. 3. I I. 41. 7 Propertius touches on the Apollo-Python theme in his Actium ode, 4. 6. 35-36. For an exhaustive treatment of this theme as the paradeigmatic 'combat-myth' see J. Fonten- rose's Python (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1959). One of his general conclusions is: 'The Champion fought not a single enemy ... but two great enemies, male and female, of whom the latter was even more terrible.' This motif of a double combat is particularly appropriate to the case of Octavian v. Antony and Cleopatra. I am indebted to Professor D. E. W. Wormell for drawing my attention to Fontenrose's book. 8 The styling of prostitutes as Chimaera, Scylla, etc., seems to have been a common- place of Greek comedy. See Orelli and Kiessling-Heinze, ad loc. and on v. 19, and Fontenrose, op. cit., pp. 309f. Professor W. B. Stanford has drawn my attention to the description of Clytemnestra as dCL~ia- flatav i ZKAAav Trva in Aesch. Ag. I233.</page><page sequence="5">CLEOPATRA AS FATALE MONSTRUM 255 and that he might have visualized the lover of Cleopatra as in the clutches of Chimaera. If monstrum could imply the thought of Cleopatra as Chimaera, then Octavian might be imagined as Bellerophon. I do not wish to press this identification. One could as plausibly visualize the combat in terms of Perseus and Medusa or Hercules and the Hydra. But it is interesting to find that the Chimaera and, implicitly, Bellerophon make their appearance in a later ode as one of the themes handled by Pindar when singing of the exploits of heroes and demi-gods (Carm. 4. 2. 13-16). Shortly afterwards in the ode (and there is surely a connexion of thought) the triumphal return of Augustus is pictured with the fierce Sygambri led captive down the Via Sacra (vvw. 33-36).' To the Augustan poets the victory at Actium had a moral as well as a mythical significance. Octavian's victory represented the triumph of reason over passion, of freedom over despotism, of Roman virtus over Oriental luxuria. The mythical and ethical aspects are clearly displayed and conjoined by Horace in the 4th 'Roman Ode'. Vim temperatam (as displayed by Octavian and his forces) di quoqueprovehunt. I ... Idem odere vires I omne nefas animo moventem (as re- presented by the unbridled passions and ambitions of Antony and Cleopatra) (vv. 66-68). Testis mearum sententiarum, proceeds Horace, the whole brood of Titans and Giants subdued by the power of the Olympians-myth again used to fortify a political lesson. Much emphasis is placed on the sexual crimes of the defeated horde. Orion is tentator integrae Dianae, Tityus incontinens, and Pirithous amator. It has often been noticed that Horace appears to reveal some sympathy for Pirithous 'the lover', just as, we may add, he clearly admires Cleopatra's fortitude. It is interesting, and probably significant, that both 'monsters' and 'chains' appear in this ode (vvw. 73 and 8o), suggesting that the same complex of ideas that moved Horace to his great Pindaric epinikion for Augustus was already at work in his imagination when he wrote the Cleopatra Ode. I suggested earlier that Horace is using monstrum of Cleopatra in the same way as Cicero in the pro Caelio used it of Catiline, not as a mere term of abuse, but to characterize the unique complexities and contrasts in her character, and to emphasize that she was both a perverse and formidable opponent. I then went on to develop the religious and mythical associations of monstrum in the context of the bellum Actiacum. I wish now to return to further consideration of the ethical overtones of the word. I believe that some light can be thrown on the implications of Cleopatra as monstrum from the 9th book of Plato's Republic, and I venture to suggest that Horace had portions of this work in mind when composing the ode.z It will be objected that many Platonic (and Aristotelian) ideas had become common- places in the Hellenistic period, and that, as Fraenkel puts it (op. cit., p. 361) : 'The cultural atmosphere at that time [sc. the Augustan Age] was saturated I Doering's note on daret ut catenis makes clear the connexion with the triumph pro- cession: eo scilicet consilio, ut ex more solemni catenata ante currum triumphalem duceretur. Cf. Carm. 2. 12. 11-12 and Epod. 7. 8. To the same complex of ideas belongs an image in the most consciously Pindaric of all the Odes, 4- 4. I i, Drusus as an eagle swooping on reluctantes dracones, yet another instance of the heroic in pursuit of the monstrous. Did Shakespeare remember his Horace when he makes Antony chide Cleopatra with the words: Follow his chariot, like the greatest spot Of all thy sex; most monster-like be shown...? (Ant. &amp; Cl. Iv. x. 48-49) 2 Plutarch in discussing the conduct of Antony and Cleopatra twice makes explicit references to passages in the Platonic dia- logues (Ant. 29. I and 36. 1-2).</page><page sequence="6">256 J. V. LUCE with doctrines and principles of Hellenistic ethics, which were to such a degree common property and, as it were, floating in the air that they need not be traced to any particular source.' However, I still think that there are such striking similarities between parts of Republic Book 9 and the ode that a direct link is by no means improbable. The ode begins with a reminiscence of Alcaeus, and Alcaeus's poem was occasioned by the death of the tyrant Myrsilus. Nunc est bibendum, exults Horace, and passes at once to a portrayal of the queen who dared to threaten the Capitol. After such an opening Horace's readers would naturally view Cleo- patra as cast in the role of a tyrant. In characterizing her Horace follows re- markably closely in Plato's footsteps. Plato sums up the character of the typical tyrant as /JEOvUrTrKoS, pT07KdO', ILEAaYXOAtKdS (Rep. 573 c). There was no need for Horace to tell the Romans that Cleopatra was J'pWortKdS, but he does em- phasize the other two traits: tUEOVUrTtKd0 in the phrases mentemque lymphatam IMareotico and dulcifortuna ebria; tEAarYXoALKd0 in quidlibet impotens sperare,furorem, and dementes ruinas. With Cleopatra's wild threats to the Capitol and the Roman imperium we may compare Rep. 573 c 3-5: Ka /77o V E yE LaoVd/tEvoS Kal VTOKEKMq7KWS Ov 3LOVOP JvOpiToTov Jaad Kat OEWjv EXTtXETPE7 7rE Kat ETT SmE a fvvaTro elvat apxEtv. In the licentious band of eunuchs surrounding the queenI there may be an echo of the dissolute companions of the tyrant postulated by Plato (Rep. 575 a 4-5). In Plato's view the character of the tyrant is the last and most complete perversion of the natural order and system of the parts of the soul. In him the control of rd AoyLrtKdv supported by rd OvtOvEaSdS has been completely subverted by -r dOlv7TOV~LtKd'V. Or, to put it in another way, rd %OEov has succumbed to -rd O7rlpt(ES. This is an unnatural and monstrous state of affairs. In calling Cleo- patra monstrum had Horace this in mind? Did he, perhaps, recollect Plato's allegory of the POpV rroTOKAov KaL TrrohAVKaAov (Rep. 588 c)? Plato himself linked his allegory to the traditional mythology of Cerberus, Scylla, and Chimaera which we saw reason to suppose was in Horace's mind (Rep. 588 c). And there are other pointers. In calling Cleopatra impotens Horace is using a term with marked ethical associations, a Latin equivalent of dKpar'g and KdoAa . 7 os a rd oKalvEtv is one of the vices which Plato explains in terms of the Ol)ptov allegory (Rep. 590 a). Later, when Cleopatra recovers her com- posure she is described, again in terms reminiscent of ethical theory, as de- liberata morteferocior. This phrase suggests the restoration of -r Aoyt0TWKdv and r7 Ovt/OEtUS to their proper functions as the controlling and motive forces respectively in conduct. Is it psychologically plausible that Cleopatra should so suddenly exchange the iflp~p of a tyrant for the serenity of a Stoic ? We need not invoke the hypo- thesis of dissociated personalities. Severe ordeals can radically alter personality traits. We should stress the shock of her defeat as the factor which dispelled herfolie de grandeur and brought her back to sanity and self-control. It was her chastening by Octavian which restored her morale. Horace says so. By a kind of shock therapy the naval disaster minuitfurorem, and Caesar's pursuit dispelled the panic fantasies of her distempered brain and redegit in veros timores.2 Pre- sumably a verus timor is one in which, as Aristotle would say, a person fears when he ought, what he ought, and to the extent he ought. This implies the vvw. 9- o0: contaminato cum grege turpium / morbo virorum, where the use of morbus for vice is typically Platonic. 2 This point is well put by Steele Commager, art. cit., p. 51.</page><page sequence="7">CLEOPATRA AS FATALE MONSTRUM 257 due co-operation of reason and emotion in a state of mind which is 'royal' (generosius) rather than 'tyrannical'. Towards the end of his Oipt'ov allegory of human nature Plato stresses the therapeutic value of punishment. He says that the offender who escapes punish- ment (AavOdcvwv) becomes a worse man, while he who is caught and punished has 7r OptpoE5 in him lulled and tamed, and his soul restored to a more honourable condition (Rep. 591 b 1-5).

I have allowed that monstrum is abusive in so far as it reflects the average Roman's superstitious horror of Cleopatra, but have argued that in Horace's learned and humane mind the term carried richer and deeper meanings. In particular, I have emphasized the mythical and ethical associations of the word. By its mythical associations it glorifies the exploit of Octavian in ridding the world of a 'monster'. But we cannot follow Horace in sympathy for the fallen if Cleopatra was nothing but a monster. Here I have explored the psychological complexities implied by 'monstrous' conduct, and have suggested that the ethical sense of monstrum (after Plato) as a deviation from the normal condition of the psyche functions as a hinge or pivot in the movement of the ode. Monstrum at the heart of the long final sentence sums up the contrasts and extremes in Cleopatra's life and character, and is the point at which the antitheses of the ode are knotted together. We were prepared for antithesis by the sharply contrasted nunc . .. antehac of the first two stanzas. Then we moved on to Cleopatra planning ruinas Capitolio andfunus imperio; but after the d6bacle her own palace is laid low and she herself prepares her own death. The queen sur- rounded by courtiers becomes a privata mulier. Having fled in terror from the sea-fight she now faces death voltu sereno. Her mind was frenzied by wine; now her body (like that of Socrates) prepares to drink the poison.3 There is a tragic intensity of contrast in this peripeteia. Shakespeare felt it too in his heroine who 'by her death our Caesar tells "I am conqueror of myself"'.4 And Horace would clearly agree with Shakespeare's epilogue: 'Their story is I no less in pity than his glory which I brought them to be lamented.' Trinity College, Dublin J. V. LUCE I According to Plutarch (Ant. 69) she did take some steps to transport her fleet from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea, but the project ran into difficulties.
