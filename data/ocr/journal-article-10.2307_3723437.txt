<plain_text><page sequence="1">'ENEAS' AND THE DOCTRINE OF COURTLY LOVE The Dido episode in Eneas has received due and sympathetic treatment from scholars for the way the poet has taken Dido into his mind, and re-imagined in terms of his own background and experience, without departing very far from the great figure which Virgil's human insight had created.1 The French Dido not only recognizes the emotions as an integral part of the human personality, she also places there the dynamic of action: Se il sentist ce que ge sent, Qu'il amast moi si com ge lui, Ne partisson ja mes andui. (1828) Her craving for unity receives expression just because her love is unreciprocated. She has become conscious of her own relation to Eneas, and of a desired unity: to be loved back, the condition of friendship comes from a just God of Love. For what, asks Cicero, is so absurd as to take pleasure in many vain things, such as honour, glory, a building, apparel and adornment of the body, and not to consider as a treasure a virtuous heart which can love you, can return love for love.2 That side finds fulfilment at the end. In the Lavinia episode the poet is borrowing piecemeal from Ovid,3 but the spirit of his work has little in common with the Latin poet. The articulate heroines of the Metamorphoses are partly responsible for giving life and substance to the shadowy Lavinia of Virgil, but Lavine is different in this sense that she is an indi- vidual by reason of her love. Then, like Dane and Narcisus her intellectual background is not merely declamation, but the Trivium - grammar, dialectic, rhetoric; and as William of Conches tells us, these are the first things which the philosopher must possess: with them equipped as with arms, we ought to approach the study of philosophy.4 In Eneas the characters not only illustrate a philosophy, but also expound it. This is most apparent in the scenes between the Queen and her daughter Lavine. A truce of eight days has been agreed upon before the final combat, and quite suddenly we are introduced into the Queen's chamber. Her 'suasoria' puts the case for Turnus. The general question or thesis - que est amors? - is explored by means of interrogation and response. The critical approach to the mystery of love dominates from the outset. The Queen is not only a dialectician, she is also something of a natural philosopher. Both the Piramus and Narcisus poets had been fascinated by certain passages in Ovid which treated of the phenomenon of 'falling in love' and the state of 'being in love'.5 In Piramus it had been 'nullo dolore', no physical wound. In Narcisus it is closer to the expression of the Ars Amatoria, with the aim of singling out a passion involving pain as evil. For the Queen in Eneas 'Cist maus est buens' (7937).

Then her thought finds expression by means of the little allegorical figure with the arrows and box of ointment, borrowed from decorative art. He is the direct descendant of the Amor of Propertius,1 and shows very well by comparison the new temper of the modern world. In the Latin poets the opposition is between love's pains and the absence of love; the poet, in the grip of passion, cries out in torture and all his desire is for love to fly away and leave him whole (sanus). In elegy and epyllion it is usually unhappy love, and in the Metamorphoses usually undesirable love, and for the victim of this scourge Ovid says he composed the Remedia Amoris.2 The opposi- tion now is between love's pains and fruition, wholeness is the enjoyment of love, happy love. Our poet includes both kinds in his demonstration, but the love he chooses to portray is reciprocated. It is true that at the beginning of the Remedia Amoris Ovid tells us that it was for happy love that he wrote the Ars Amatoria, the second book ends on the theme of fruition (II, 727-8). It is not accidental that our poet draws on this passage, yet we cannot fail to recognize the gulf which separates the detail of a poet writing on the art of seduction from the conviction of a character who is expressing the profoundest needs of her being. In the Queen's exhortation it partakes of the sanity of outlook of a Bernardus and, as in his description of the sense of touch the Ovidian imagery finds itself in a new context, in that blend of literature and philosophy which characterizes the best products of the cathedral schools.3 It is typical of the freedom and balance of our poet that this purely earthly side of love needs no excuse, noble in itself; it stands high by contrast with the vice of sodomy which the Queen denounces in a later speech,4 that sin castigated by St Paul in his Epistle to the Romans. Later the charge against Eneas sets Lavine's love in a bad light, but it is disproved, and the poet has set out deliberately to portray Lavine as an instance of happy love, founded on natural morality, whereas Scylla to whom she owes something, always appears in Ovid in the catalogue of women whom passion has driven to crime. The Queen has defined the essential nature of love, but the consciousness of love she does not profess to be able to teach - 'Tes cuers t'aprendra a amer'. Lavine has learnt something from her but these images only serve to orientate her thought. To describe the birth of love in his heroine the poet puts into action the machinery first sketched in the anthropomorphic Amor of the Piramus. The events happen in a way which suggests an apparatus of scientific learning, not just a more rigorous application of the rules of the 'narratio' to the passage in Ovid descriptive of Scylla's passion for Minos. In her the effect of Minos's beauty, as Ovid describes it, was a sort of crescendo, ending almost in 'folie'.5 In the medieval poet it becomes a psycho-physical process which is natural and unconscious. Lavine who was said 1 The god with the arrows of gold and lead was early traced to Ovid, Metamorphoses, I, 468-71 (Faral, p. I44, footnote 2), but the groundwork is, I think, an elegy of Propertius which is a kind of chria, II, xii, I-I2. Compare especially v. 14 and Eneas 8o19. 2 Remedia Amoris, I5-38. 3 The remedies of love are no longer a collection of precepts based on psychology, they come rather within the sphere of Physis of Bernardus who 'naturarum omnium origines, proprietates, potentias, effectus, postremo universam omnemque Aristotelis categoriam materiam cogitationis effecerat' (mentioned by F. J. E. Raby, A History of Secular Latin Poetry in the Middle Ages, 2 vols (Oxford, I934), II, IO, and described by C. S. Lewis, The Allegory of Love (Oxford, 1936), pp. 93-7). 4 Eneas, 8596-8602. 5 Metamorphoses, vIII, 32-6. 284</page><page sequence="3">HELEN C. R. LAURIE to be 'salvage' is the substratum, Amor is the efficient cause. By his action, the shoot- ing of the dart, her physical condition changes from health to the kind of sickness which is the nature of love. The natural (i.e. perishable) form, that specified in the Queen's definition, is conceived of as present in the efficient cause, now wounding but ultimately healthgiving.1 We are at the beginnings of the process: bien a oi comfaitemant lo loent tuit par la cite et de proece et de bialte; bien lo nota an son corage la ou al fu an son estage. Amors l'a de son dart ferue; ainz qu'el se fust d'iluec meue, i a changid cent foiz colors: or est cheoite es laz d'amors, voille ou non, amer l'estuet. (8052) Aristotle maintains that necessity is in the matter, while 'that for the sake of which' is in the definition:2 Quant voit que eschiver n'en puet, vers Eneam a atorne tot sun corage et son panse. Amor acts as a mediator: 'por lui l'a molt Amors navree'. This may be related to Aristotle's discussion in the third book of the Physica of agency and patiency in the full sense, which, though they belong to the same subject, the motion, are not the same; for the 'actualisation of love in Lavine' and 'the actualisation of Lavine through the action of Amor' differ. But matter and form are not place, and there is such a thing as locomotion:3 la saiete li est colee desi qu'el cuer soz la memelle. Tote ert sole la damoiselle, l'uis de la chanbre ala fermer, revient a la fenestre ester ou al recut lo cop mortal; d'iluec esgarde lo vasal. (8066) The awakening proceeds so that there is a 'soul' or 'consciousness' standing above the sensations, organizing them into an experience: Crie et plore et gient et brait; ne set ancor qui ce li fet, qui son corage li comuet. (8079) 1 Physica, II, 8, I99a, 15. The scholar who rehandled Ovid's story of Piramus and Thisbe began the thinking on scientific lines (see my article in M.L.R., 55 (1960), p. 29): 'Each step then in the series is for the sake of the next; and generally art completes what nature cannot bring to a finish, and partly imitates her' (translation by R. P. Hardie (Oxford, I930) ). 2 Physica, II, 9, 2ooa, 14. 3 Physica, III, 3, 202b, 20 and IV, 3, 209b, 30: 'In so far then as it [i.e. place] is separable from the thing, it is not the form: qua containing, it is different from the matter. Further, how could a body be carried to its own place, if place was the matter or the form?' Compare Eneas, 9204. 285</page><page sequence="4">'Eneas' and the Doctrine of Courtly Love Then the 'self' distinguishes itself from sensation, the Aristotelian 'vis animae' appears in the external world by means of a monologue in which Lavine examines the data of sensory experience, and finally arrives at knowledge. When she was fancy free she was ignorant, and unwilling to learn. Then from sense perception comes opinion: 'Ge quit, mien esciant, ge ain' (8097), and through the inner discourse with commonsense reason she finds herself in possession of a whole body of knowledge, a new consciousness, and as its source she comes to think of Amor as the teacher in the inward act of apprehension. Our poet takes the interpretation of heat and cold a stage further than the Narcisus poet, linking it with medical science and the study of symptoms. The kind of experience which the medieval poet has in mind cannot then be taught by a master like Ovid. Only when the miracle has happened can the experient, from the particulars of sense experience, attain to a knowledge of the universal. In the Ars Amatoria Ovid boasted that exper- ience inspired his work (I, 29-30), but his was the experience of a man of the world, experience in human psychology, in types of women, in every possible situation in every possible love affair. The poet of Eneas is using his scientific knowledge to work up quite a different passage in Ovid which contains the germ of his develop- ment. Ovid is counselling the reader (the man) who has found an object for his love, to see that he never leaves her side, and compares this new love and the way it can be strengthened to growth in animals and plants (In, 339-48). The 'insomnie amoureuse' has a new function of exercise; the pains of love which Narcisus attributed to an Omnipotent Fiend are the necessary accompaniment of the coming-to-be, Amor tortures in order to teach. It is a process of refinement of the experient and the final cause is a Good. Ovid in a digression brought in Apollo, whose advice to the seducer was 'Know thyself', but this turned out to be not introspection but 'make the most of yourself', through knowledge of your physical attractions and pleasing accomplishments (II, 497-500). The god ends-: Qui sibi notus erit, solus sapienter amabit, Atque opus ad vires exiget omne suas. The poet of Eneas sets up this couplet on a proper philosophical basis. Lavine has knowledge, a self-consciousness and poise that the Latin poets and their heroines lacked. She does not wish for love to fly away: the appetite for felicity finds imaginative expression in the anticipation of the joys in store (8218-8230). It is only through the challenge of commonsense reason that the spiritual truths of the love experience come to be formulated, and there is a strong rationalistic founda- tion.1 The need of the lover for a physician, the acknowledgement of a teacher, these were already suggested in Narcisus. Surrender to a God of Love, and a complete transformation of Lavine, these are the new things, rebirth to spirituality in Amor and a fresh vision of the cosmos: Trestot lo jor, desi qu'al soir, s'estut iluec, si esgarda lo lou par ou il s'an ala: molt li sanblot la voie bele. (8388) 1 A process of continuous development of knowledge from sensation and imagination, out of which springs rational knowledge and through it wisdom (sapientia) exists in theory in the Metalogicon of John of Salisbury (iv, 8 if.). This is the section, of course, in which he is drawing largely on the Posterior Analytics and Chalcidius' commentary on the Timaeus. 286</page><page sequence="5">HELEN C. R. LAURIE 287 It is noticeable that love of the perfect kind can only be felt for one person. Love based on utility is for the commercially-minded. True love is for a companion and an equal (8285-92). As a union of two souls the conception is anticipated in the 'pius amor' of Nisus and Euryalus, the love of man for man which 'provided an exercise of the spirit not wholly unlike that which later ages have found in "love" '.1 The conditions for its sexual expression had been made clear in the experience of Narcisus at the pool. Since the lover has material existence and lives in society, problems of conduct arise. In Eneas the sphere of conduct is confined to the lovers themselves for the most part. Whether to make the advances - that had been the question which caused Tisbe and Dane to pause, and while Reason had opposed on grounds of Pudor, Love had won the day. The perfecting process which takes place in Lavine brings about a different state of affairs. In a lyrical outburst as Eneas passes out of view she fortifies herself against a declaration. This is in reply to commonsense reason. It begins and ends on a lyrical note, but there is insinuated into it, in curiously pedantic phrasing, a resolution to do nothing which will lower her in the eyes of Eneas. Now it is Pudor which goes hand in hand with love, it is Love which is exacting about considerations of 'honestum', at least so far as the beloved is concerned (8353-80). After the 'scene de l'aveu', when the poet is faced with the problem of bringing about a parallel development on the side of Eneas, the question of the advances again presents itself to Lavine. Her natural impulse is to seek satisfaction, and Reason, by cross-questioning, extorts the admission that she is ready to make the advances herself: 'Iras i tu?- Oil, par foi'. Reason reminds her of the larger world: 'A grant honte t'iert atorne.' She does not show the same regard for public opinion as she had had for Eneas: - Cui chalt ? se faiz ma volent6, molt m'en ert pou que l'an an die. (87 6) Reason remonstrates on grounds of 'honestum'; her advice is that she adjust herself to a purely mundane scheme of things. In rejecting it love's assurance comes from the conviction that the freedom and happiness of the individual depend on her capacity for choice, and Love goes on to propound a reason of its own, a higher value in the light of which the good may be achieved through practical activity: S'an ert plus fiers al mien espoir; se de m'amor est a seiir, molt l'an trovera cil plus dur, molt an prendra grant hardement, s'il sot onques d'amor noiant. (8758) The divided will, the conflict of Cupido and Mens, is resolved in this co-ordination of mind and sense, of thought and activity. It is the judgement neither of blind instinctive emotion nor of calculated individual utility but the judgement of the whole person. Still, the danger of 'vilenie' could not be avoided so long as the woman made the advances. This is brought home to Lavine in the last scene of the episode, 1 C. S. Lewis, The Allegory of Love, p. io. Compare Eneas, 4947-8.</page><page sequence="6">'Eneas' and the Doctrine of Courtly Love when the position has to be faced, the consequences of having disregarded Pudor, not for what the world thinks (the later Honte), but for the possible effect on the man: sovant me sera reprov6 que de s'amor fui prinsaltiere et me tanra por noveliere; le dongier avra de l'amor il an ventra au chief del tor. (9862) and again: lo dangler an deiisse avoir; il me deiist proier d'amer et losengier et dangerer. (9870) In spite of the idea of equality which Lavine had expressed earlier, there is this added notion that she should have the right to refuse her favours. It is a matter of civilization, not of nature: Dangler is the correlative of Pudor on the social side. Interested in his characters as members of a civilized society, the poet seizes on those parts of the Ars Amatoria which deal with problems of sociology (I, 277-8, 34I-2). These aspirations which are voiced by the heroine in Eneas point to an ideal which is only completely realized in later poems. The attitude of the man is much less established in tradition. He is a new type in vernacular literature in the North, and Eneas has only in this episode a single love monologue in which he alternates between cynicism and idealism about Lavine's motive in declaring herself. All the arguments of commonsense reason are of no avail against the conviction of the lover himself, as it organizes and clarifies itself in the contest. Reason points out the disadvantages of revealing his feelings, the advantages of holding back: Homme se doit molt bien covrir; ne doit pas tot son cuer mostrer a feme, qui la velt amer; un po se face vers li fier, que de l'amor ait lo dongier, car se la famme lo faisoit, qu'el fust desor, il s'en plaindroit. l'an doit fame faire doter, ne li doit an pas tot mostrer come l'an est por li grevez; de tant aime ele plus asez. (9078) This theory of conduct, based on psychology, comes, of course, from Ovid,l but in the lines just preceding Ovid had recommended the man to ask first: the modera- tion of his advance is a later manoeuvre in order, as our poet saw, to avoid pain. Love does not reply with a theory, though the elements were there in Ovid's text if the poet had wished to use them; it admits the truth of these warnings, but there is still an objection, and it comes as the spontaneous judgement of the whole man. He will do nothing which may possibly deprive him of this felicity which has just 1 Ars Amatoria, I, 715-18; Faral, p. 141. 288</page><page sequence="7">HELEN C. R. LAURIE come within reach of his consciousness (9089-94). The good of the lover is seen to depend exclusively on the beloved. With the woman, the movement was away from the object, the method was that of cultivation and restraint, and this was not altogether incompatible with the idea of the unity of the lovers. Eneas thinks of Lavine's love as a gift, and he is ready to sacrifice himself in order to keep it. There is no theory of submission, but the mentality of the lover tends to be ecstatic and idealizing, while common sense takes a realistic view of woman. In the dialogue of the 'insomnie amoureuse' there was an attempt to explain what is meant by the love pains: Lavine urges herself to accept them as a lesson, an increase in knowledge and therefore good. Another part of her replies feelingly that she has only known the bad so far (8438-44). The image of Amor as a horse- man, the lover considered as an animal, love as a burden, are not uncommon in Ovid.1 Later, the 'scene de l'aveu' with the Queen ends with the surrender to Amor, as Lavine sees the wisdom of submitting to discipline on the model of Ovid: 'Cedamus! leve fit quod bene fertur onus.' It is the familiar elegy, ending with the triumphant procession of Amor with the captive Mens Bona and Pudor, the scene which with Medea's monologue suggested the elaboration of Dane's passion in the JNarcisus. But here it is the central section of the elegy, the surrender of the lover to the God of Love, which our poet takes over at this point. However much Ovidian material has been utilized in the episode, it is rare to find in the Latin poet an attitude to which the medieval poet can naturally respond. Both are indebted to rhetoric, both make the comparison with the disciplining of an animal, and both employ the technical terms of vassalage.2 In Eneas it concludes Lavine's defence (8653-9), and is in an entirely different key from Ovid's playful handling. The surrender is the first real step towards the reconciliation of the rebellious senses and the desire for understanding of the true meaning of her experience. Love is a 'pondus', and whether he was conscious of it or not, the poet is lending to the Ovidian word something of the added meaning it had acquired in the intervening centuries.3 A living faith has stamped itself however unconsciously on the lovers' attitude and outlook - for instance in the final scene when, after the fight, the poet imagines a lovers' quarrel. Eneas' torture and suspense are described from another familiar elegy,4 the god of Love is now the lover's refuge in his trouble: la nuit veillot et ert an plor et apelot lo deu d'amor et priot li molt humblement qu'il nel menast si aigrement. (9923) And in the monologue that follows, of self examination and repentance, it is brought home to us that the whole inner life of the religious Christian may well be the mould into which the new experience was poured. Yet in this scene, there is no deliberate use of Christian material. At first it is Ovid, or Ovid plus the rhetorical means of expression, and as he continues it is rhetoric which lays bare the recesses 1 Pondus, sarcina; Remedia Amoris, 82, 90, 530; and especially Heroides, Iv, 2I-5. 2 Amores, I, ii, 13-22. 3 The Benedictine Guillaume de St Thierry had taught how this 'pondus' couldI be applied to its proper end, raised to the order of charity and so bring forth supernatural virtues, in his De natura et dignitate amoris. 4 Heroides, xi, 25-30. 19 289</page><page sequence="8">'Eneas' and the Doctrine of Courtly Love of his soul.1 The remainder of the monologue, seventy more lines of dreary self- communing on the theme of the lovers' suspense, makes sufficiently clear what is the result when the poet's invention fails him, exposes the need for fresh sources, material to work up in order to satisfy the desire to explore the inner life of the individual man. Another poet could be intentionally (and, it might be held, profanely) using language which he found applied to love for God in reference to purely human love between man and woman. The God of Love to whom the prayers of Eneas are addressed is more than a mere personification. Inside the lover as well as outside, Amor is essentially a presence. The Amor who appears to Lavine in his various aspects, now as physician, now as schoolmaster or as feudal lord, belongs to the conceptualizing imagination. The God himself, 'lord of terrible aspect' as he is already in the Roman de Troie,2 has it in his power to save or condemn the lover according to his merits. The curbing of the woman's natural instincts was accompanied on the side of the man by a readiness to accept the position of humility. They are equal in their fidelity to the God of Love, but moral and social considerations are gradually defining the duality of lover and beloved. Their 'amistie' tends to approximate more closely on the one hand to the reality of a great court and the forms of vassal service, on the other to the 'sentiment type', the love of man for God. We are witness of the motives which were influential in the creation of an ideal, of the Lady as Domina and Dea, in contemplation of whom the lover found, at least for the time being, the subject self merged with the objective thing, in an experience of unity and ideality. The poem ends with the marriage of the lovers. The poet thus remains true to the general spirit of his 'remaniement', for in his eyes this episode probably completes the personality of his hero. As usually in Virgil, 'pietas' serves to express in Old French epic a social relation whether sacred or secular. The new com- bination which appears in Eneas derives its dynamic from the individual passion of Turnus,3 it too is redirected through the lover's dependence on the God of Love. It is now a personal relation, the end is individual salvation in this world. Virgil's contemporaries might thrill at the words 'Tantae molis erat Romanam condere gentem', but for a man of the eleventh or twelfth centuries, whatever reverence or admiration he felt for the past, the old civilization had passed away, the life of the individual as an embodied soul with a high destiny was the most important thing on earth. The Eneas poet's gaze is turned in a different way to an alien past, and he finds there a means of expressing his growing personality, by the construction of an analogous scheme of felicity for man in the flesh - a foretaste of Paradise. This unique personal relationship derives directly from the God of Love. The arrow of gold which pierced Lavine's heart expresses in the world of time and sense the sheer reality of Amor now in control of her life. For Dido, on hearing of Eneas' intention to depart, love was not 'loials' towards her 'quant ne senton comunalment' (1827), so the poet interpreted Virgil's 'non aequo foedere'. It is the man as the third person who makes the mood one of happiness or despair, and the traditional imagery of Latin elegy finds its way in in a fresh and uninhibited way. At rock-bottom 1 A single 'sententia' of Terence - 'amantium irae amoris redintegratiost' - is expanded into a sort of enthymeme, 996I-10005. 2 C. S. Lewis discusses these questions in a general way in The Allegory of Love, pp. 2o-I. His 'Additional Note to p. 8', p. 43 is very much to the point. 3 See my article 'Eneas and the Lancelot of Chretien de Troyes', Medium Evum, 37 (I968), 142. 29o</page><page sequence="9">HELEN C. R. LAURIE in sexual matters his view coincides with that of Chalcidius.1 At the other extreme, the repentance of Lavine on finding her fears of sodomy are unfounded is touched with an almost religious emotion: Biaus dolz amis, tenez mon gage, molt par vos ai dit grant oltrage, ferai vos droit et tot plaisir ... Biaus dolz amis, se vos plesoit, nus piez iroie a vostre tref; molt me seroit bon et soef, se trairoie mal ne dolor. (9213-23) How strangely the charm of Cynthia2 is revived in this flash of poetic feeling of a kind rare in Eneas! The charge of unnatural love was the obstacle which had given rise to a little psychological drama. Lavine's unbounded joy when it is removed gives a new twist to a passage (x, 298-502) in the Metamorphoses where the words 'pia', pius', and 'pietas' are very evident, the story of Myrrha's unnatural love for her father. Her nurse tells her how she is to gain access to him, drunk with wine: infelix non toto pectore sentit laetitiam virgo, praesagaque pectora maerent, sed tamen et gaudet: tanta est discordia mentis. A divided and turbulent state of mind had indeed appeared in Lavine earlier when commonsense and love had wrestled out what was to be if Eneas was killed (ocirrai moi, ge n'en sai plus). Ovid's picture of the tree wavering, to which he had compared Myrrha's mind, weakened by many blows, leaning unsteadily now this way and now that, and falteringly turning in both directions, offered the medieval poet dramatic incentive to original thought and imaginative effort. We can almost see the destructive crash as the Latin poet comments: 'no end nor rest for her passion can she find save death'. In Lavine's dialogue with herself, as her love proves stronger than common sense or utility, the girl is uplifted and upheld by the thought of dying in the event of Eneas' defeat. Timelessness keeps her in balance: que mes druz ne soit Eneas; o lui me tien, choisi l'en ai, ja mes d'amer ne li faudrai. (8750) The attitude to the subjective will is Augustinian in inspiration. Referring to different kinds of wills in man, the Saint shows how 'certant secum donec eligatur unum, quo feratur tota voluntas una, quae in plures dividebatur'.3 So she goes on to construct a very effective plan of action. Her letter, offering her 'amistie', reminiscent of the 'nugae amatoriae' of the schoolmen, is the prelude to an attempt at representing a union at different levels. That the bond of nature (foedus naturae) 1 Timaeus a Calcidio translatus commentarioque instructus, edited by J. H. Waszink (I962), pp. 215-6.

(III, 513-I4, Eneas, 8876-86) Just before, Ovid had consciously advanced to a philosophic standpoint: 'candida pax homines, trux decet ira feras' (502). At this the highest point of the episode, concord, in the midst of battle scenes, is brought about by love. The god himself is concealed behind the surface narrative, but the pure 'baisier' exchanged between the two contrasts too obviously with the kiss of Venus in the Dido episode for the mystical intention to be overlooked. Ovid had added: "tis after such prelude that young Cupid, laying his foils aside, draws the sharp arrows from his quiver'. Describing his state after his conversion, St Augustine could use the erotic imagery with complete freedom: 'et cantantibus canticum graduum dederas sagittas acutas', and 'Sagittaveras tu cor nostrum caritate tua'.1 This poet is not on a par in giving a theological colour to his description of human love. The analogy with the heavenly Cupid exists only in embryo in his mind; for the privileged reader to find 'in secret within, the sweeter kernel of truth'.2 In a couplet, only intended perhaps to emphasize the vileness of Myrrha's passion, Ovid briefly and in a negative way, set the lines of a development which was to have a great future in the vernacular literature: ipse negat nocuisse tibi sua tela Cupido, Myrrha, facesque suas a crimine vindicat isto. (Metamorphoses, x, 31 I) The Hellish associations which might be expected in a Trojan are amplified freely in Eneas, but the quality of the relationship approved in the poem has a positive character, and 'pietas' a precise area of meaning; its realm of feeling sustains an earthly Cupid capable of an ethical bias, working with passion in a spirit of devotion and self-sacrifice, and still able to take stock of itself. The novelty is in the free expression of this sentiment, from its beginnings as a profound physical need and rising to a plane of disinterestedness and idealism not generally attributed to the Ovidian spirit. The situation of Medea has been dramatically overturned and re- dressed, her energetic self-revelations reorganized from within.3 The unexpectedness of love's assault (nova vis) is shown in Lavine's direct appeals to Amor: Amors, an ceste novelt6 me demoines trop grant fert6. (8205) From the revelation of a Power greater than herself, 'out of the innermost feeling of the soul', comes the effect of integration. Perhaps the view in Propertius of a God 'entire, fastened to his prey' corresponds most closely to the medieval poet's 1 Confessions, Ix, 2 and 3. 2 Alanus ab Insulis, De Planctu Jaturae, printed by Thomas Wright, Anglo-Latin Satirical Poets of the Twelfth Century, 2 vols (1872), II, 465. 3 dixit, et ante oculos rectum, pietasque pudorque constituerant; et victa dabat iam terga Cupido.

LAURIE feeling, and the monologue only provided the elements for the reasoned philosophy of love which his own habits of thought and his intellectual training demanded. Ovid moreover was a wonderful repository of ideas expressing typical experience of love, so that by careful testing of their validity and readjustment where necessary he set a sound basis on which to build. In this little piece of original composition the disciplines are interrelated, in complete conformity with the best teaching of the times,l and the poet's place in the rise of romance is the guarantee of his fame while many other and perhaps more gifted students are forgotten. The study of Grammatica in particular had impressed on his memory all that erotic imagery - so astonishing a feature when we consider the aspect of unfamiliarity where the unlettered part of his audience was concerned. Not by imitation but by discrimina- ting recreation in accordance with a particular point of view and an original psychological approach has he worked out his solution, and admiration and delight are effects he can contrive in people in his poem and simultaneously in his hearers. Only half real in Eneas, this vision would seem to commend itself to those milieux capable of appreciating an imaginative experience and responding to gradations in feeling. After Lavine's outburst, which was only with difficulty restrained, harmony is restored with the exchange of signs between the two.2 Eneas is delayed in his tent, and when he reappears, Lavine's passion breaks out anew. She in her tower and Eneas below, 'iluec ou il rebut l'amor', exchange tender looks. Then the poet introduces the barons whose raillery serves to promote a general atmosphere of goodwill: 'Sire', font il a lor seignor, 'veez, molt est bele la tor, mais il a un piler laisus qui auques pent vers vos gaiis. veez com la meisiere est plaine, li pilerz droiz et l'ovre saine. Molt est bele cele fenestre lez ce piler, de Ca sor destre, mais il s'i esta uns archiers qui molt trairoit ca volantiers. Sire, car vos traiez an sus que il ne traie a vos caiis.' (9241) Jesting in an oblique way on the scene, they have become a party to convention. This apparently original passage is strongly reminiscent of Quintilian,3 and seems to be related in the poet to a rhetorical background. He adds: 1 SeeJohn of Salisbury, Metalogicon, I, 24 (edited by C. C. J. Webb (Oxford, I929), pp. 54-5). 2 In Cassiodorus we find a description of two kinds of affection known to the Greeks as pathos and ethos, the one violent, the other a settled state: 'Et est pathos temporale ethos vero perpetuum; utrumque ex eadem natura, sed illud maius, hoc minus, ut amor pathos, caritas ethos. Pathos concitat, ethos sedat' (Carl Felix von Halm, Rhetores Latini Minores (Lipsiae, 1863), p. 503). This part of his Liber de Rhetorica seems to go back to Quintilian. 3 Institutio Oratoria, VI, ii, 3: 'Ethos quod intelligimus quodque a dicentibus desideramus, id erit, quod ante omnis bonitate commendabitur non solum mite ac placidum, sed plerumque blandum et humanum et audientibus amabile atque iucundum; in quo exprimendo summa virtus ea est, ut fluere omnia ex natura rerum hominumque videantur utque mores dicentis ex oratione perluceant et quodammodo agnoscantur.' 293</page><page sequence="12">294 'Eneas' and the Doctrine of Courtly Love Un po s'an sozrist Eneas, qui antandi tres bien lor gas (9253) Quintilian continues: 'Quod est sine dubio inter coniunctas maxime personas... Nonnumquam etiam lenis caloris alieni derisus ex hac forma venit, sed his non ex locis tantum.' He refers to a kind of irony which employs words which mean other than they seem to express. This situation demonstrates the need for instruction in the figurative interpretation of reality, and the nature of the demand, for the ideas, literary in origin and now in a new dress, must find in the layman a corresponding response in experience. The poet of Eneas was early in a field to become popular with medieval audiences. Though his poetry does not reach great heights, this innovator of lucid and enquiring mind undoubtedly tackled a number of problems in a way which could interest and inspire a Chretien de Troyes or a Guillaume de Lorris.'
