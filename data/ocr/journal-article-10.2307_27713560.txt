<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR IN BEAUCHAMP'S CAREER it is common knowledge that Beauchamp's Career, published in November, 1875 after a serial run in the pages of The Fortnightly Review, is George Meredith's one political novel. It is equally well known that Meredith created the hero in the image of his friend, Captain Frederick Maxse, who in 1867 had stood as the Radical candidate for the borough of Southampton and had been defeated. Not only that, but it is repeatedly, and appropriately, recorded that Meredith had devoted two months of his own time to promoting Maxse's campaign. Commentators have been quick to verify the resemblance of Nevil Beauchamp to his prototype, documenting the case through Meredith's letters and Maxse's published addresses,1 yet no one has demonstrated, in a manner either sufficiently explicit or sufficiently complete, the way in which Meredith himself can be seen to figure in the narrative. The invitation to look for the author in the pages of his novel may be said to come from Meredith himself, for in a letter to Maxse, which undoubtedly refers to an early version of the story, Meredith had announced: "I have just finished the History of the inextinguish able Sir Harry Firebrand of the Beacon, Knight Errant of the 19th century, in which mirror you may look and see?My dear Fred and his loving friend, GEORGE MEREDITH."2 While it cannot be said that this invitation has been ignored, less has been made of it than one would expect, and those who have acted upon it have failed to go as far as they are entitled to do. In a characteristically thoughtful appraisal of the hero's r?le Monsieur Ren? Galland casually remarks, "Il ne voit pas comme son ami Lydiard (Meredith lui-m?me) les deux faces d'une question," but he provides no evidence whatsoever for his arresting parenthesis.3 1 See, for example, Mary Sturge Henderson, George Meredith, Novelist, Poet, Re former (New York, 1907), pp. 113-14 and Siegfried Sassoon, George Meredith (London, 1948), pp. 128-29. The fullest and the most satisfactory discussion of Beauchamp's Career is to be found in Ren? Galland, Les Cinquante Premi?res Ann?es (Paris, 1923), pp. 334r-50. After the event Meredith counted the time that he had spent in helping Maxse as "a dead loss," but he may have revised his judgment when the experience turned out to be grist to his literary mill. 2 Letters of George Meredith, Collected and Edited by his Son (New York, 1912), i, 220. Hereafter referred to as Letters. 3 Op. cit., p. 341. 332</page><page sequence="2">Portrait of Author in "Beauchamp's Career" 333 And the fact is that very little can be advanced to support it. Mr. Lydiard, hardly more than a supernumerary, is a colorless member of Beauchamp's coterie, whose appearance could readily be dispensed with, and whose only affinity with his author appears in two mildly amusing comments which Meredith may have set down, tongue in cheek. "He is no true Radical," some one is made to say of him. "He is a philosopher?one of the flirts, the butterflies of politics."4 Such a remark, certainly, may be construed as a wry jest made by the author at his own expense, inspired by recollections of his futile campaigning with Maxse. And one may take a similar view of the deliberately caustic comment that Lydiard is "a man of ability fool enough to have turned author on no income."5 It is easy to imagine that Meredith, whose patience was often tried by the refusal of the public to appre ciate him, penned those words with a degree of personal animus; yet to say these things is not to assert, much less to prove, a close identi fication of Meredith with this character. Nowhere does Lydiard ex press any of the ideas or attitudes which one thinks of as Meredithian. Never, for example, does he seem to be so close to Meredith as does Seymour Austin on one important occasion. Seymour Austin belongs to the Tory faction, but, unlike the other Tories in the novel, he eschews intemperate views and "the enthu siasm of party." He is, moreover, astonishingly liberal in one sig nificant respect, for he is a firm believer in "new and higher destinies for women," hopefully envisaging, even, their future participation in political life, and professing to see "more certain indications of the reality of progress among [them] than any at present shown by men."6 Such breadth of mind where women are concerned naturally recalls Meredith's own championship of the sex, yet one should not therefore conclude that Seymour Austin is modelled on his author.7 4 George Meredith, Works, The Memorial Edition (New York, 1910), xi, 217. All references are to this edition, hereafter cited as Works. 5 Ibid., xi, 304. 6 Ibid., xi, 301-02. 7 For Meredith's ideas on the position of women, see in particular Letters, n, 418-19, 426, 442, 557-58, 561, 562, 596. In 1869, at the very time, perhaps, when Beauchamp's Career was beginning to take shape in his mind, Meredith read Mill's essay on "The Subjection of Women," and it is probable that Mill's cogently marshalled arguments served to confirm him in a point of view toward which he had been moving independently. Meredith had already been celebrating women through splendid repre sentatives of their sex. In the novels following Beauchamp's Career he assisted their cause not only through the characterization of memorable heroines but, increasingly, through his treatment of the problems which they are obliged to face. His next novel, The Egoist, for example, is as much concerned with the situation of Clara Middleton as it is with the psychology of the selfish male.</page><page sequence="3">334 Hill There can be no doubt that if Meredith is incarnate in any one of the characters in this novel that one is Dr. Shrapnel, the man whom Beauchamp has chosen as his guide, philosopher, and friend. To be sure, Dr. Shrapnel is not a self-portrait in any narrow or literal sense. Although he is described as lean and wiry, no physical resemblance to Meredith can be pressed, for he is also said to be in his sixty-eighth year (Meredith was forty-seven in 1875) and immoderately tall. It is rather through his ideas that his likeness to Meredith emerges, for he has many things to say in which he can be shown, beyond any shadow of doubt, to be speaking for the novelist. Here again Monsieur Galland has noted a general resemblance without going into particulars.8 The fact is, however, that the paral lels between certain utterances of the Doctor and the recorded opinions of Meredith are impressive. Most of these are to be found in the celebrated letter which the Doctor sends to his young prot?g? after the latter's defeat at the polls, a letter which is a kind of Summa of his beliefs on a variety of subjects. There, for example, he assails the apathy of the English middle class; "the belly class," he calls it, echoing a phrase ("this pot-bellied country") from one of Meredith's letters to Maxse.9 The religion of the middle class, he proclaims, "is Comfort. It is their central thought; their idea of necessity; their sole aim." An indictment which may recall how Meredith had written to Morley in 1870, at the time of the Franco-Prussian war, rapping the complacency of the English, "a people notoriously craving peace for comfort's sake," while taking sides furiously in the conflict.10 Dr. Shrapnel's comment that the middle class "has absorbed the upper and despises ... the lower," seems to reflect Meredith's statement to Maxse that "the aristocracy has . . . sold itself to the middle class: that has done its best to corrupt the class under it."11 And then 8 To the creation of Dr. Shrapnel, he observes, Carlyle and Ruskin, J. S. Mill and Meredith himself contributed. And again: "Ce 'revolutionaire,' ce d?mocrate, est comme Meredith avant tout un moraliste." {Op. cit., pp. 342, 343.) But although he cites (p. 342, n.2) passages in Meredith's letters attacking the materialism of the English middle class, Galland does not compare them with similar passages in the novel. 9 Works, xii, 10 and Letters, I, 191. 10 Works, xii, 7 and Letters, I, 212. Dr. Shrapnel is violent on the subject of the comfort-loving commercial class. Its loyalty to the nation, he insists, would not survive the loss of prosperity. "In a day of bankruptcies, how much would you bid for the loyalty of a class shivering under deprivation of luxuries, with its God Comfort beg gared?" {Works, xn, 8-9). The most earnest desire of Dr. Shrapnel and Beauchamp is to improve the lot of the common people, "the unmoneyed class, which knows not Comfort" (xn, 9). 11 Works, xn, 8 and Letters, i, 191.</page><page sequence="4">Portrait of Author in "Beauchamp's Career" 335 there is what the Doctor, though reputed to be subversive, has to say about society. On this subject he is particularly eloquent, knowing that Beauchamp has been tempted to defy society in his desire to free Ren?e Croisnel from her unhappy marriage. "Society," he pronounces, "is our one tangible gain. . . . Toward the laws that support it men hopeful of progress give their adhesion. . . . Rebellion against Society, and advocacy of Humanity, run counter." That is essentially the view of Meredith, who, though he had himself been made to suffer by the prudery and hypocrisy of society, once told his son Arthur that, while "Society is a wanton hypocrite and [he] would accommodate her in nothing," he nevertheless held that for the principle of Society "men should be ready to lay down their lives."12 But it is on the subject of religion and the clergy that the closest similarities between the senti ments of Dr. Shrapnel and those of his creator are to be found. In the decade of the seventies Meredith was becoming increasingly anti-clerical and increasingly hostile to the formulations of orthodoxy. The ethical teachings of Christianity he never ceased to honor, but he had come to regard its dogma as the result of a primitive need for supernatural assurances which men should now be able to do without. Writing to his son Arthur in April, 1872, he expressed himself to this effect in the language of evolutionary thought. The Christian teaching is sound and good: the ecclesiastical dogma is an in stance of the poverty of humanity's mind hitherto, and has often in its hide ous fangs and claws shown whence we draw our descent. And Nevil Beauchamp's mentor, asserting the need for flexible belief to meet the advancing knowledge of men, uses the same metaphor to condemn the rigidity of the creeds. The creed that rose in heaven sets below; and where we had an angel we have claw-feet and fangs. Ask how that is! The creed is much what it was when the followers diverged it from the Founder. But humanity is not where it was when that creed was food and guidance.13 The imagery of brute force which is startlingly repeated in these two passages is inspired by the conception of the Church as a reactionary power hostile to progress, which Meredith expressly entertained. The agreement of Dr. Shrapnel and his author on this point can be demon strated by the collocation of other passages. Dr. Shrapnel's letter, for example, contains this declaration: 12 Works, xii, 12-13 and Letters, I, 237. 13 Letters, i, 237 and Works, xn, 5.</page><page sequence="5">336 Hill Ours, my Beauchamp, is the belief that humanity advances beyond the limits of creeds. . . . We reverence the Master in his teachings; we behold the lim its of him in his creed?and that is not his work. We truly are his disciples, who see how far it was in him to do service; not they that made of his creed a strait-jacket for humanity. Furthermore, Meredith allows Beauchamp himself to argue: It's put down to the wickedness of human nature that the parson has not got hold of the people. The parsons have lost them by senseless Conservatism, because they look to the Tories for the support of their Church and let the religion run down the gutters. . . . [They] call the men that do the work they ought to be doing demagogues. The parsonry are a power absolutely to be counted for waste, as to progress.14 These stringent utterances can be matched by some of Meredith's own. Toward the end of his life he expressed himself emphatically to Edward Clodd: "Parsondom has always been against progress; they treat Christianity not as a religion, but as an institution."15 And at the beginning of 1870 he had complained to Maxse: "The Parsonry are irritating me fearfully. . . . They are interwound with the whole of the Middle class like the poisonous ivy."16 But Meredith's heartiest scorn of priestcraft was called forth when the clergy assailed John Tyndall's Belfast address in 1874. "They affirm that Tyndal is an atheist," he wrote angrily, "and would dare to say he is already damned if the age were in a mood to hear that language. The man or the country that fights priestcraft and priests is to my mind striking deeper for freedom than can be struck anywhere at present."17 14 Works, xn, 5 and xi, 169. 15 Edward Clodd, "George Meredith: Some Recollections," The Fortnightly Review, lxxxvi, N.S. (1909), p. 26. Clodd also reports that Meredith had said to him: "The man who has no mind of his own lends it to the priests." {Ibid.) Compare this with the question which Cecilia Halkett, troubled by the arguments of Beauchamp, puts to her father: "Do we really give our consciences to the keeping of the parsons once a week, and let them dogmatize for us to save us from exertion?" {Works, xi, 161). What Beauchamp had been saying to her can be inferred from one of his later conversations, in which he tells her that "The Protestant parson is the policeman set to watch over the respectability of the middle-class (xi, 169)". Finally, when Beauchamp, out of deference to Jenny Denham, consents to be married by a priest, despite his own "natural re pugnance," Meredith cannot refrain from taking a fling: "Alas for us,! . . . these women who have not moved on their own feet one step since the primal mother taught them to suckle, are perpetually pulling us backward on the march. Slaves of custom, forms, shows and superstitions, they are the slaves of the priests" (xn, 303-04). We need not take this too seriously, for Meredith had, after all, married Marie Vulliamy in the service of the Church of England (in October, 1864), and there is no reason to think that, had she wished it so (and she would have), he would have hesitated to do the same in 1875! 16 Letters, i, 201. 17 Ibid., i, 251. Speaking before the British Association, Tyndal had surveyed the development of natural philosophy from Democritus to Darwin, and, in expounding</page><page sequence="6">Portrait of Author in "Beauchamp's Career" 337 The vehemence of these onslaughts must not, however, lead one to suppose that Meredith's attitude toward Christianity was at all times wholly combative. He tried to keep distinct his feelings about Chris tianity and his opinion of its official sponsors. Nor did he spurn all priests. The Reverend Augustus Jessopp, to whose school he sent Arthur, was one of his dearest friends, and there were other clergymen for whom he had a genuine respect. Moreover, the personal philosophy which Meredith substituted for religion did not exclude reverence. Though the creeds of the churches had ceased to have meaning for him, and though he no longer believed in the God of his fathers, or in immortality, Meredith did believe in a governing Spirit at the heart of the universe, and he believed in prayer. "It seems to me," he wrote to John Morley in 1878, "that Spirit is, how, where, and by what means involving us, none can say. But in this life there is no life save in spirit."18 This belief in cosmic Spirit is the fruit of Meredith's love of Earth, of his trust in the vitality and the goodness of Nature; and to this immanent Spirit, though it resisted precise definition, Meredith found it helpful to pray. On the subject of prayer he sent more than one comment to Maxse, who at one time had the matter very much on his mind. Prayer, he wrote, "is good for men. It is at once an acknowledgment of some higher power: it rouses up and cleanses the nature, and searches us through to find what we are." He was explicit, furthermore, about what it is proper to pray for, and about what should be prohibited. One may pray for guidance and for strength, but one ought never to pray for material rewards. "The praying for gifts, and thanking for gifts, is really damnable. It's like treating the Lord as an old uncle."19 This same thought Meredith repeated in a characteristic passage of a letter to Arthur, written in 1872 when the lad was nineteen and was abroad studying in Germany. "Do not lose the habit," he counselled him, "of praying to the unseen Divinity. Prayer for worldly goods is worse than fruitless, but prayer the origin of species, had repudiated anthropomorphic conceptions of God. Expressing a frank materialism, he had professed to discern in Matter, despite the lack of empirical evidence, "the promise and potency of all terrestrial life." He acknowledged an insoluble mystery in the creative process, and he admitted that to find a reasonable satisfaction for "the religious sentiment in the nature of man" was "the problem of problems at the present hour." But asserting that religion is "mischievous, if permitted to intrude on the region of knowledge, over which it holds no command," though it is capable of "noble issues in the region of emotion, ... its proper end and elevated sphere," Tyndal warned the clergy not to try to control the advance of science. {Address Delivered Before the British Association Assembled at Belfast, London, 1874, pp. 55 and 60-61.) 18 Ibid., i, 287. 19 Ibid., i, 176.</page><page sequence="7">338 Hill for strength of soul is that passion of the soul which catches the gift it seeks."20 Those words illumine, and are illumined by, the famous aphorism of Sir Austin Feverel: "Who rises from Prayer a better man, his prayer is answered."21 But a remarkable gloss upon these several passages comes in the epistle of Dr. Shrapnel to Beauchamp. Warming to his subject, the Doctor discourses at length. I say Prayer is good. I counsel it to you again and again: in joy, in sickness of heart. The infidel will not pray; the creed-slave prays to the image in his box. . . . We make prayer a part of us, praying for no gifts, no interventions; through the faith in prayer opening the soul to the undiscerned. And take this, my Beauchamp, for the good in prayer, that it makes us repose on the unknown with confidence, makes us flexible to change, makes us ready for revolution?for life, then ! He who has the fountain of prayer in him will not complain of hazards. Prayer is the recognition of laws; the soul's exercise and source of strength. . . . Cast forth the soul in prayer, you meet the efiluence of the outer truth, you join with the creative elements giving breath to you . . . you live in the day and for the future, by this exercise and discipline of the soul's faith.22 The significance of this quotation needs no underscoring. The idea of prayer as a means of self-discipline, helping to free one from inhibiting custom, making one "flexible to change," joining one with "the crea tive elements," and preparing one for social growth through the elimi nation of selfish fear, suggests the evolutionary faith of which, as everybody knows, Meredith was the eager apostle. Finally, the passages from the novel and the excerpts from Meredith's letters corroborate one another, irrefutably confirming the opinions of Beau champ's radical mentor as George Meredith's own. It is notable that Monsieur Galland was conscious of nothing contradictory in declaring that Mr. Lydiard is Meredith himself and in stating, in a later paragraph, that Meredith put something of himself into the characterization of Dr. Shrapnel; for even if one could subscribe to the first contention, no real contradiction would exist. There is nothing amiss, and nothing unusual, in an author's reflecting elements of his own personality or his own experience in the develop ment of more than one of his personae. What the foregoing argument appears to demonstrate is that the suggestions of the French critic should be reversed. Although one or two of the things which are said about Mr. Lydiard may lead one to think of Meredith, the figure with whom Meredith probably identified himself more or less fully is Ibid., i, 237-38. 21 Works, ii, 91. 22 Ibid., xi!, 5-6.</page><page sequence="8">Portrait of Author in "Beauchamp1 s Career" 339 Dr. Shrapnel; but he took good care to keep the identification from being complete. After all, while he might be amused to reflect upon himself as a dilettante in politics, he doubtless found it peculiarly congenial to think of himself as the philosophical tutor of the hero. In conclusion, it may be salutary to recall what Meredith wrote to Janet Ross, reminding her that he had once given her, sitting on the mound at Copsham, an outline of the real story upon which his novel about Emilia (Sandra) Belloni had been based. "Of course," he had added, "one does not follow out real stories; and this has simply suggested Emilia to me."23 Charles J. Hill Smith College 23 Letters, i, 25.</page></plain_text>
