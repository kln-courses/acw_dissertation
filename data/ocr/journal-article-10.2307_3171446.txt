Assemblage 28: 6-15 @ 1996 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Esther da Costa Meyer La donna e mobile This paper will focus on the appearance of agoraphobia and the imbrication of women, urban space, and pathology. Since this neurosis straddles the fault line between public and pri- vate, and affects women in particular, it seems to be a rel- evant subject of study for us today. Even though agoraphobia cannot be generalized as reflecting the current situation of women, like other urban pathologies,' it tells us something about the way space is constitutive of personality. I wish to explore different theories of agoraphobia - sociological, psychological, psychoanalytic, feminist, new historicist - to discover what each of these has to say about this most spatially confining of anxiety disorders and its relation to women. Agoraphobia is most commonly defined as the fear of, or in, open spaces, or more literally, the fear of the marketplace. First coined by Dr. Carl Westphal in 1871, the term did not gain common currency until relatively recently.2 Different authors used Platzscheu or Platzfurcht (fear of public squares), Platzschwindel (dizziness in public squares), Strassenangst (fear of streets), Raumangst (fear of space), and Topophobie. With time, fear of urban spaces came to be identified more correctly with situations located in the public realm: not only streets and squares, but more specifically, centers of shopping, trains, bridges, tunnels, elevators, and so forth. In recent years, the incidence of agoraphobia has increased exponentially and it currently constitutes over fifty percent of all patients with phobic or psychoneurotic disorders. Its con- nection to women is beyond dispute: around eighty-five per- cent of agoraphobes in this country are women,3 and although 7</page><page sequence="3">assemblage 28 1. Camillo SittL's plan for the Ringstrasse. The Roman numerals designate the close- knit squares created by his infill blocks. the vast majority of these are white and affluent, we simply do not know enough about the extent of the disease and the forms it takes in other ethnic groups that have no access to psychiatry and lack the economic resources to stay at home. Combating the Symptoms One of the first scholars to deal with agoraphobia was the Viennese architect and urbanist Camillo Sitte. Sitte fell back on a literal interpretation of agoraphobia - the fear of open space. Or perhaps it is more fair to say that he was primarily concerned with agoraphobia as a sociological rather than a pathological phenomenon. Always attuned to psychological questions, Sitte noticed that many of his con- temporaries either scuttled uneasily across large city squares or engaged in long detours skirting the walls of surrounding buildings.4 As he wrote in 1889, "Recently a unique nervous disorder has been diagnosed - 'agoraphobia.' Numerous people are said to suffer from it, always experiencing a cer- tain anxiety or discomfort whenever they have to walk across a vast empty place."5 According to Sitte, only small-scale, enclosed squares took account of what he liked to call "our natural craving for protection from the flank."6 Sitte had particular reason to be concerned with agorapho- bia. Vienna's old ramparts, which had for centuries served as a psychological and architectural boundary that enclosed the old city, had been torn down to make way for the Ringstrasse, a vast boulevard one hundred ninety feet wide, whose width was out of scale with the historic fabric. But perhaps unconscious class fears had something to do with the tensions attaching to the Ringstrasse as well. From time imme- morial the old city had been the seat of the court, the aristoc- racy, the wealthy bourgeoisie, and their servants, while the proletariat was housed in the featureless urban sprawl beyond the walls. The destruction of the ramparts implied the erasure of the main spatial divide that separated the affluent from the Hapsburg empire's ethnic minorities and from the poor. Sitte redesigned parts of the Ringstrasse, adding infill archi- tecture to produce small, protective city squares of the sort he had seen in Tuscany and Umbria. His projects, which were not carried out, represent a nostalgic, petit-bourgeois protest against the inevitable transformation of Vienna into a me- tropolis. To be sure, they would have helped dispel the mal- aise of the small-town dweller, inured to the shelter and comfort of the capillary street network, but only at the ex- pense of future traffic. Although his insights were based on an incomplete formulation of the complex social issues involved, his sensitive reading of the intricacies of urban space remains a valuable tool for town planning even today. And his empha- sis on the emotional importance of walls is most perceptive, though it misses the psychosexual connotations that other scholars were later to identify and analyze. Pathologizing Women For Sitte's contemporary and fellow citizen Sigmund Freud, who focused on the clinical picture, the fear of urban space was a symptom, not a cause, of aberrant behavior. In Freud's view, anxiety neuroses such as agoraphobia were due to repressed, unconscious fears or wishes masquerading as spatial ones and were connected not with empty space but with urban - that is, social - space, above all, with streets. Streets were threatening to those, like affluent or middle-class women, who led a shel- tered or repressed life, because they held out promises of temp- tation, sexual fulfillment, and escape from home. This freedom of choice was a source of great anxiety for the agoraphobe, who experienced unconscious guilt for what were in fact uncon- scious desires, and so felt the need for a restraining influence, such as the walls of the house or a companion to walk with.7 8</page><page sequence="4">da Costa Meyer Linking the etiology of agoraphobia to repressed sexual desire, Freud theorized it largely as a female malady, at least in his early writings on the subject. As he put it rather crudely in a draft entitled, appropriately enough, "The Architecture of Hysteria" (1897), "Agoraphobia seems to depend on a romance of prostitution."' Yet the first three known patients for whom Westphal named the disease were, in fact, men, as was the overwhelming majority of cases reported in the medical literature of the day.9 Freud himself had treated one case of male agoraphobia in 1893 and two in 1895. And though he did not know it at the time, in 1897, his most important experience with agora- phobic patients was to revolve around a five-year-old boy - the celebrated case of Little Hans.") Significantly, this is the only one of Freud's case histories where he makes use of urban plans, however schematic. When Little Hans developed a fear of going out into the streets and squares of Vienna, including the sheltering ones so admired by Sitte, Freud correctly saw that space per se was incidental to the disease and incapable of causing trauma. In the case of agoraphobia, buildings and squares have no intrinsic architectural meaning, but are convenient "symbolic substitutes" for repressed feelings." Desire, thwarted by prohibition, transfers itself by metonymy to a nearby object. Urban and architectural space become eroticized through displacement - the final resting place of the repressed (and overdetermined) signified, at the end of a long metonymic chain. Freud later explained the mechanism and the secondary gains it affords: In the case of phobias one can see clearly how this internal danger is transformed into an external one .... The agora- phobiac is always afraid of his impulses in connection with temptations aroused in him by meeting people in the street. In his phobia he makes a displacement and is now afraid of an external situation. What he gains thereby is obvious; it is that he feels he can protect himself better in that way. One can rescue oneself from an external danger by flight, whereas an attempt to fly from an internal danger is a difficult undertaking.12 As we can see, for Freud there was no easy fit between the urban or architectural signifier and the referent, which is always overdetermined and thus partly unavailable. In this sense, we might say that he was a post-structuralist avant la Warehouse I Caae Loading Dock n ism zmna Carts -- Courtyard Railings Street Entra nceates (Untere Viaductgasse) Ill"0 Mllll 77I717IfMllllll1 717717llllllTl/ 7 O ur H ouse 1/ 2.

Freud's diagram showing Hans's projected route lettre: "In the process of the formation of a phobia from the unconscious thoughts underlying it, condensation takes place; and for that reason the course of the analysis can never follow that of the development of the neurosis."" Like all phobias, the story of Little Hans can be broken down into different issues that never exhaust the whole picture: his fear of the streets had to do with, among other things, zoophobia (in his case, a fear of horses). One of Hans's playmates had fallen down while both children were playing horses, and he had also seen a horse fall down in the street. He wished his father too would fall down and hurt himself: the Oedipal triangle would thus happily resolve itself around Little Hans and his mother. Had Hans limited himself to feelings of love for his mother and ambivalent feelings toward his father he would not be phobic. "What made it a neurosis," wrote Freud, "was one thing alone: the replacement of his father by a horse. It is this displacement, then, which has a claim to be called a symptom.""4 Displacement - a form of censorship - permitted Little Hans to overcome the ambiguity of his 9</page><page sequence="5">assemblage 28 emotions with respect to his father by transferring the ag- gressive impulses to a substitute object, the horse. Freud later changed his mind with regard to the origin of agoraphobia in one very important aspect. Reflecting on the case of Little Hans from a distance of several years, he began to revise his earlier view according to which anxiety was the result of repressed material. Anxiety, he now believed, was the cause of repression: "the majority of phobias go back to an anxiety of this kind felt by the ego in regard to the de- mands of the libido. It is always the ego's attitude of anxiety which is the primary thing and which sets repression going. Anxiety never arises from repressed libido."" What agoraphobes fear is the outbreak of their anxiety attacks. Be that as it may, Freud successfully isolated the main com- ponents of the symptomatology of agoraphobia - the un- derlying sexual symbolism, the mechanisms of condensation and displacement, and the bipolar world of the patient, torn between a fear of obscure forces transferred to urban space and a home that could be far from nurturing even in the case of affluent women. Though Freud knew better than to mythologize the home as a benign, sheltering cocoon, he underestimated the extent to which even placid, happy homes could be confining to women, and not only those with intellectual proclivities. By concentrating on individual cases, which were seen as unique occurrences, he also avoided any correlation between pathology and society. Today, psychoanalysis has moved far beyond its own initial sexist and essentialist explanations that focused primarily on women agoraphobics and disregarded the cultural construc- tion of gender in the pathogenesis of mental illness. Today, agoraphobia is considered as much a social problem as it is an individual affliction - at least to those, male or female, who have done research on the subject with an eye to women's issues. Capitalism, Consumption, and Agoraphobia The synchronicity of the appearance of agoraphobia with the rise of the metropolis also anchors it firmly within capital- ism. The Industrial Revolution entailed, among other things, the sexual division of labor that separated dwelling from workplace. As a result, the social identities of men and women came to be constituted differently. Yet the doctrine of the separate spheres - a male public sphere and a female private one - cannot be accepted today except as ideology. Numer- ous historians have underscored the continued presence of women in the public realm throughout the centuries.'6 It was only to men that they had been invisible. And African-Ameri- can scholars have shown that in this country, non-Caucasian women often spent more time in the public realm than men. The relentless focus on the private realm betrayed an exclu- sively white middle-class conception of domesticity." But the Industrial Revolution also radically altered the class structure and its inscription in the urban fabric. With zoning, the proletariat, often split up into ethnic subgroups, was more often than not driven out of the historical city with tragic consequences, particularly for working-class women: "the slogan 'woman's place is in the home' took on a certain ag- gressiveness and shrillness precisely at the time when increas- ing numbers of poorer women left their homes to become factory workers."" Only affluent white housewives could af- ford to lead shuttered lives secluded in suburbia. Class plays a powerful role in the geopolitical distribution of this neurosis over urban space. Just as the equation of obesity with lower-income groups plays a role, however subliminal, in the rise of anorexia,'9 so, too, we must ask to what extent the isolation, if not the suburbanization, of the agoraphobic in this country - her spatial segregation from other social and ethnic groups - may be linked to class fears.20 Are we dealing with a pathologic pastorale, if we can be permitted the oxymoron? Is the agoraphobic's attempt to reterritorialize urban space unwillingly complicit with some form of societal discrimination? It seems clear that the semiotics of this anxi- ety disorder include powerful markers of class and ethnicity, as well as of gender. The correlation of urban space and so- cial class is not incidental to the emergence of phobias. Per- sonality evolves in response to specific economic, social, and cultural opportunities made possible in and through the ur- ban environment. According to David Harvey, "assignment of place within a social-spatial structure indicates distinctive roles, capacities for action, and access to power within the social order.""21 Positionality, we might say, is destiny. 10</page><page sequence="6">da Costa Meyer Agoraphobia must, I think, be theorized in relation to capi- talism. But we must remember, too, that what we call the public sphere has to do not only with gender, but with social class and race, issues that vary from culture to culture and are articulated differently in terms of space. As Susan Bordo notes, "Agoraphobia and anorexia are, after all, chiefly disorders of middle- and upper-middle-class women - women for whom the anxieties of possibility have arisen, women who have the social and material resources to carry the language of femininity to symbolic excess."" If gender is the product of social practices and institutions (disciplines), we must historicize and contextualize agora- phobia, not just pathologize it. Several scholars have done just that, relating cultural factors - not just psychological ones - to the genesis of psychological disorders.23 Going back to the etymology of agoraphobia, Gillian Brown has reinterpreted it as the fear of the marketplace (or agora), that is, the fear of consumption. In her view, agoraphobia epitomizes the plight of the individual in a market economy and can thus also be seen as a painful and pathologic attempt to circumvent the consumerist role assigned to middle-class women in affluent societies.24 With the advent of industrialization, economic pressures caused severe strains in the traditional value system of American society. The transformation of the home from a place of production to one of consumption had great im- pact on women's personalities and led to a drastic change from the Protestant values of thrift and self-denial to one of self-indulgence and self-fashioning. Extending this analysis to the spatial aspect of the phenomenon, we might say that agoraphobia can be considered to a certain degree as a rejection of the commodification of public space made available exclusively for purposes of consumption. But withdrawal from the marketplace is no longer feasible: the two realms have become consubstantial. This desperate attempt to reprivatize the home and wrest it from commer- cialism was doomed to failure from the start. With the spread of consumer ideology, the boundary between house and marketplace was eroded.25 Hence the need for an ideol- ogy of domesticity: middle-class women were encouraged to consume but also to stay out of the labor market. Sadly enough, it is just the fragile and ultimately illusory frontier between domestic and urban space that agoraphobes hang on to, the nerve-racked, angst-ridden threshold behind which they retrench themselves. Perhaps the most tragic aspect of this disorder is that the home to which all agoraphobics are inexorably chained is not a shelter.26 It is, rather, the place from which they unconsciously struggle to escape. The Production Of Agoraphobia Agoraphobia can thus be said to allegorize the sexual division of labor and the inscription of social as well as sexual differ- ence in urban space. It speaks, after all, the same symbolic language as patriarchal society: the gendered antinomy be- tween interior and exterior space reasserts the economic (ac- tive) function of the male and the "non-productive" (passive) one of the middle-class female. Agoraphobia represents a vir- tual parody of twentieth-century constructions of femininity.27 The parodic femininity of agoraphobia is based on a literal interpretation of domesticity as immobility, helplessness, and infantilization, according to the main stereotype fabricated in the West as a role model for affluent women.28 Significantly, the vast majority of cases of agoraphobia develop after mar- riage.29 And it is the only phobia known to appear when the patient is an adult.3o The transition from a state of total de- pendency on the parents to one of expected independence reactivates fears of separation and may precipitate a crisis resulting in agoraphobia. Obviously, an anxiety neurosis as complex as this is always overdetermined. But in light of the escalating number of cases, we cannot be satisfied with purely psychological explanations. The very fact that most cases appear after marriage should alert us to the socioeconomic connotations of a disease that keeps women out of the labor force and reiterates their role as housekeepers for their hus- bands.31 Agoraphobia is known, to no one's surprise, as "housewives' disease."32 In recent years, feminist scholars on both sides of the Atlantic have produced a steady stream of challenging literature that treats gender-specific types of neurosis as outlets of resistance to patriarchy: Luce Irigaray, Hlene Cixous, Catherine Cl6ment, and Michele Montrelay in France and Carroll 11</page><page sequence="7">assemblage 28 Smith-Rosenberg and Elaine Showalter, among others, in the United States. For these scholars, psychopathology is a form of protest: the hysteric's repressed impulses are articu- lated symbolically through the body - which implies, from a Lacanian point of view, a refusal of the phallocentric power anchored in language. Studies on agoraphobia have followed the same trend. Like other forms of psychopathology, it is a language with a syntax of its own. Robert Seidenberg and Karen DeCrow, for example, see agoraphobia as a strategy of opposition to what might be called the ethic of renunciation usually demanded of married women.33 It is precisely the somati- zation of the symptoms that permits the victim to express feelings that she finds unacceptable. The agoraphobic, say Seidenberg and DeCrow, is "a living and acting meta- phor."34 Conversely, agoraphobics avoid situations that give (unconscious) symbolic expression to their hidden fears or wishes: trains (the wish to flee), elevators and tunnels (the fear of being trapped in unhappy marriages), and so forth.35 The notion that agoraphobia is "body talk" is crucial also for Julia Kristeva, who comes to a similar conclusion from a different perspective. Drawing on the work of Lacan, she sees phobia as a failure of the subject's "signifying system."36 The [agora]phobic personality, she writes in her analysis of Little Hans's case study, is "incapable of producing meta- phors by means of signs alone, . . . . the only rhetoric of which he is capable is that of affect, and it is projected, as often as not, by means of images."" But - and here she departs radically from the others - symbolicity is cathected by a drive that has nothing to do with object choice and thus bypasses sexual difference.38 Years ago, Roman Jakobson called attention to the bipolar structure of semiotic systems or forms of language in his pathbreaking article on aphasia.39 Metaphor and me- tonymy, he concluded, are equally present in literature (language) and in aphasia (pathology). While space per- ception depends on mastering institutionalized signs, agoraphobes tend to read them figuratively. Both the places they avoid and those they designate as shelters have to do with distinct typologies that are metaphors for situations they fear or desire. Their spatial codes are personal and her- metic rather than socialized. There can be no doubt that agoraphobia is a coherent signify- ing system. Its victims stand to gain something from their extreme stance and are prepared to pay exorbitant prices for it. As Freud points out, illness of this kind ends in compro- mise: Little Hans's fear of going out into the streets served as a ruse for keeping him at home with his beloved mother.40 Susan Bordo, however, has underscored the self-defeating nature of the agoraphobic protest and its ultimate unwilling and unconscious collusion with the system.4" Nondiscursive, symbolic protest through the body ends up by subserving the hated establishment and reproduces the sexual division of labor by keeping women at home - which is to say, it repro- duces capitalism.42 Neuroses, as Freud was fond of pointing out, often seem to do the bidding of the more conservative forces of society: they are, after all, the result of a repression of vital instincts. While psychoanalysts and clinical psychologists interpret fear of the built environment as "merely symbolic of interpersonal issues" and ignore the sociopolitcal dimension, environmen- tal psychologists see it in purely ecological terms, insisting on the connection between place and pathology.43 Choosing one or the other of these two opposing conceptions carries serious implications for the victims of agoraphobia. From a psychoanalytical point of view, the notion of cure is highly problematic. Recovery is not frequent and is marked by re- lapses even when it occurs.44 The psychoanalysts' pessimistic prognosis helps explain the popularity of the behaviorist ap- proach that nowadays tends to dominate the field. Behavior- ists teach the patients to revisit the threatening sites or typologies, often with the help of antidepressants. In dealing exclusively with the symptoms, they deny the metaphoric nature of agoraphobia and hence overlook its causes.45 The Semantics of the Spatial Referent Whichever side we choose to follow, the persistence of archi- tectural imagery in this gender-specific disease raises several issues. Are the buildings and urban space just empty husks to 12</page><page sequence="8">da Costa Meyer which repressed pathologic behavior attaches itself? Are they, in other words, simply neutral signifiers? Or is there not some underlying reason that leads victims of agorapho- bia to cast their scenarios of fear and foreboding in architec- tural terms? If architecture is eroticized through metonymy that depends on propinquity, why is the garden, for ex- ample, not an equally powerful source of affect? Heldne Deutsch, the first woman psychoanalyst to study agoraphobia, was also the first to analyze the architectural imagery of the house. According to her studies, the act of leaving the protective walls of the home and finding oneself "outside" is associated by many agoraphobics with the act of giving birth.46 For some psychoanalysts this would explain the high rate of agoraphobia among women. Lest this be taken for an essentialist claim, I hasten to add that agora- phobia is one of the rare phobias in which the association of crossing the threshold with parturition occurs also in male agoraphobes: it is not linked to biological sex but to gender. The equation of home and womb would thus seem to be so profoundly ingrained that it has the power to femi- nize male patients. There is a surplus of signification at work here: in their regression to intrauterine memories, the agoraphobes' Lebensraum shrinks to this tautological con- densation of home and womb. But it is not just space that contracts. By choosing to stress the ontological priority of the maternal body over the home what is implied is also a rejection of temporality. The agoraphobe's inspired mis- reading of domestic space is revelatory: after all, "everyone's first environment is a woman."47 Agoraphobes are thus at odds with Filarete's definition of the architect as "mother" to the building as soon as it is born.48 It is the building that is the perennial mother to the architect and to the human being in general. But architecture has reasons of its own that inflect the slip- pery referentiality of the word home. Size, scale, and the anthropomorphic resonances encoded in the articulation of architectural form, all conspire to give it a strong presence in the urban environment. As Denis Hollier writes, "Archi- tecture is society's authorized superego; there is no architec- ture that is not the Commendatore's."49 And he quotes Lacan to this effect: "This edifice [Lacan was speaking meta- phorically of the psychoanalytic building] is appealing to us. For, metaphoric though this may be, it is perfectly con- structed to remind us of what distinguished architecture from building: that is, a logical power organizing architecture be- yond anything the building supports in terms of possible use. Moreover no building, unless reduced to a shack, can do without this order allying it with discourse.""5 To conclude, agoraphobia was engendered by Western cul- ture even before it was first diagnosed. Femininity, construed as planned helplessness, has still not disappeared from our society. Until relatively recently, buildings also figured promi- nently in children's books where girls were often shown im- mobilized in the house, behind the protection of windows, fences, porches, while boys were shown actively exploring the environment." Although today women are no longer inexora- bly trapped in this circularity that culturally constitutes them through images, even the most emancipated ones come up against a major obstacle that retains them behind walls. When one woman out of every four is raped in the United States (or one every ten minutes), agoraphobia - the fear of public spaces - takes on a different coloration altogether. In the case of rape victims, public space as such does not exist except as part of a topology of fear. And time, not just space, is also a constituent element of agoraphobia: at night, in most cities, all women are agoraphobic. Neither the appearance of agoraphobia nor the escalating number of victims is accidental. Psychopathologies that emerge within a given society, as Bordo has forcefully demon- strated, far from being exceptions to the rule are in fact prod- ucts of that culture.52 Agoraphobia is not easy to categorize: it cannot be reduced to a cultural stereotype (its victims suffer intensely) nor to a purely psychological or individual phenom- enon, given the growing incidence of cases. Most important, due to the circumscribed nature of its social distribution, it cannot be universalized; it does not represent the female con- dition. After all, the duke of Mantua in Rigoletto was literally correct: even though his famous definition of women was meant sarcastically - women are inconstant, fickle, change- able - today, at least, and against all odds, la donna e mobile. 13</page><page sequence="9">assemblage 28 Notes I wish to thank John Goodman and George Hersey for their suggestions and helpful readings of the manu- script. 1.

In the nineteenth century the middle-class housewife was, so to speak, tethered to the home. Thorstein Veblen's acid pen described the economic function of female fashion - the wasp waist produced by the corset - as "mutilation, undergone for the purpose of lowering the subject's vi- tality and rendering her perma- nently and obviously unfit for work" (quoted in Bordo, "Anorexia Nervosa," 107). 33.

The authors point out that while Susan Sontag la- mented, with reason, the way illness was treated as metaphor (Illness as Metaphor [New York: Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 1977]), in the case of agoraphobia, "metaphors are being treated as diseases" with equally disastrous results. 36.

It is not, perhaps, accidental that several students of Westphal, such as Carl Wernicke and Arnold Pike, were specialists on aphasia. 41. Freud, "Analysis of a Phobia," 139. 42. "On the symbolic level, too, the protest dimension collapses into its opposite and proclaims the utter defeat and capitulation of the sub- ject to the contracted female world" (Bordo, "The Body and the Repro- duction of Femininity," 21). 43. "In focusing on the association of agoraphobia with consumerism, I do not mean to suggest a market determinism, but rather to trace one internalization of market capi- talism that is neither simply a com- modity nor a site of resistance to commodification. The agoraphobic imagination both produces and is produced by capitalism. Like any commodity, it might also serve other purposes - such as feminist resistance to domesticity" (Brown, "The Empire of Agoraphobia," 154 n. 25). 44.

Freud himself suffered from a mild case of travel phobia until it was dispelled by analysis when he was in his mid-forties. He discov- ered, not surprisingly, that it stemmed from his fear of leaving home, which he associated with the maternal breast/body. See Ernest Jones, The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud, ed.
