<plain_text><page sequence="1">ON PHILOSOPHICAL DEFINITIONS In this paper I shall defend the legitimacy of nonreductive defini- tions or analyses in philosophy. In the first section, I will illustrate the issues using Quine's attempt to deal with the analytic-synthetic question in "Two Dogmas of Empiricism." The next section will clar- ify the notions of nonreductive and reductive definitions. I shall present a framework in which to classify and examine instances of these definitions. The proposal will be a theory about philosophical theories, and hehce, metaphilosophical. In order to make clear the features of this proposal about philosophical definitions, it is neces- sary to consider an illustration in some depth. Hence, in the final section, I shall consider the case of causation and show how, in a programmatic way, a nonreductive analysis of causation is required. I In "Two Dogmas of Empiricism,"' Quine attempts to show that there is no analytic-synthetic distinction - at least along traditional lines - by showing that the locution 'S is analytic' cannot be ade- quately defined. The key notion here is that of an adequate definition. Unfortunately, Quine never explicitly states adequacy conditions for a definition. Judging from several of his remarks, however, he ap- pears to hold that an adequate definition is a definition such that (A) it is not subject to counterexamples from the preanalytic data and (B) the definiens does not appeal to the family of locutions to which the definiendium belongs. A first, and naive, explication of analyticity considered by Quine is: S is analytic = df not-S is self-contradictory. But this definition breaks adequacy condition (A). Preanalytically, the following two sentences are analytically true: (1) All unmarried males are unmarried; (2) All bachelors are unmarried. Since (1) is an instance of a logical truth, the denial of (1) is a con- tradiction. However, unless appropriate substitutions are made for 'bachelor' or 'unmarried' in (2), the denial of (2) is not an explicit contradiction. We might attempt to salvage this definition by enrich- ing the notion of a contradiction: but the enriched notion in that 1 W. V. Quine, "Two Dogmas of Empiricism," The Philosophical Review, vol. LX (1951), 2043. 151</page><page sequence="2">152 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH case would depend for its meaning on 'S is analytic,' and thus ade- quacy condition (B) would be broken. Quine thinks that isolating instances of logical truths is un- problematic.2 Hence, if (2) can be transformed into (1), there would be an unproblematic way of indicating that (2) is analytic. The prin- ciple of transformation cannot be coextensively, since replacing 'bachelors' in (2) with 'things that are identical with John Jones or Harry Smith or . .. ,' where '. . .' indicates an exhaustive listing of actual bachelors, does not yield an instance of a logical truth. The principle of transformation has to be synonymy. In general: S is analytic = df (i) S is logically true or (ii) there is an S'such that (a) S is exactly like S except that S'contains expressions e1', e' . , where S contains ei, e2, .. , en and where every ei is synonymous with ej and (b) S is logically true. This definition is highly plausible. Quine rejects it, however. The second adequacy condition is broken: 'e is synonymous with el" and 'S is analytic' belong to the same fam- ily. Moreover, we cannot salvage this definition by substituting 'is defined by' for 'is synonymous with,' since the former also belongs to the analyticity family. Adequacy condition (B) would be satisfied if 'e is synonymous with e" is definable without appealing to any locution in the analytic- ity family. The most plausible suggestion of this type is: e is synony- mous with e' - df for every S that contains e, e' can be interchanged with e without changing the truth-value of $. Quine claims that this proposal fails. If the language in which S occurs is purely extension- al, then, contrary to the preanalytic data, 'creature with a heart' and 'creature with a kidney' are synonymous. In order for this definition to meet the requirements of the preanalytic data, the language in which S occurs must contain the predicate ". . . is necessarily true." For interchangeability guarantees synonymy only in the context 'S is necessarily true' or similar contexts. When this qualification is added to the proposed definition of synonymy, however, adequacy condition (B) is broken. 'S is analytic' and 'S is necessarily true' belong to the same family. Quine considers other locutions that might be used in the defini- tion of 'S is analytic,' such as 'R is a semantical rule'; but in each case, the cost of accommodating the preanalytic data is the failure to meet adequacy condition (B). And according to Quine, failure to 2 But cf. J. J. Katz, "Some Remarks on Quine on Analyticity," Journal of Philoso- phy LXIV (1967), pp. 36-38.</page><page sequence="3">ON PHILOSOPHICAL DEFINITIONS 153 meet the requirement that the definiens not use locutions that belong to the same family as the definiendium results in unintelligibility. Adequacy condition (B) is surely too strong.3 The locution 'S is analytic' is clearly intelligible: by isolating (1) and (2) as analytically true and by criticizing various definitions for not satisfying the pre- analytic data, Quine shows that he understands these locutions. For example, in arguing against the view that synonomy is interchange- ability in a purely extensional language, Quine says that 'creature with a heart' and 'creature with a kidney' are nonsynonymous but interchangeable. But Quine can raise this objection only if he pre- analytically understands synonomy. A great deal is learned about a locution when one determines its interconnections with other members of the family to which it be- longs. Quine himself has increased our knowledge about 'S is ana- lytic' by delineating some of its interconnections with other members of the analyticity family. If it were the case that 'S is analytic' is definable using only locutions not belonging to the analyticity family, then it would be helpful to know these interconnections. If, as Quine maintains, 'S is analytic' can only be defined using locutions belong- ing to the analyticity family, then it is not merely helpful to know these interconnections, but essential. What is needed in that case is a mapping or charting of the geography of that area of our conceptual framework concerned with analyticity. II A more careful differentiation? of the kinds of definitions at issue is in order. First, however, let me construct some working terminol- ogy. A locution is an open sentence, such as 'S is analytic' and 'e caused '; it is symbolized by 1, with or without sub- or superscripts. I take as primitive the predicate ". .. is definable using only . . . where".. ." is replaced by a locution and "- - -" is replaced by one or more locutions and/or other expressions, possibly complex, such as a logistic system. This predicate is veridical in the sense that if 0. is definable using only +, then there exists some definition of 0 in terms of + that admits of no counterinstances from the preanalytic data. -The second primitive notion is that of a preanalytic locution set. These sets are symbolized by A, with or without superscripts. A pre- 3 H. P. Grice and P. F. Strawson, in "'In Defense of a Dogma," The Philosophical Review, LXV (1956), 141-158, suggest this criticism: see esp. 147 ff.</page><page sequence="4">154 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH analytic locution set contains all and only those locutions that are categorically bound, as it were. An example is the set of locutions pertaining to analyticity: {S is analytic, e is. cognitively synonymous with e', e is interchangeable with e', S is necessarily true, R is a semantical rule. S is self-contradictory (in a wide sense), } Another example is the set of locutions pertaining to human action: {(person) S performed (action) a, S brought about (event) e, S brought about e intentionally, S tried to perform a, S wanted to perform a, S has the ability to perform a,.. S has the opportunity to perform a, And another example is the set of locutions pertaining to knowledge: (S knows that p, S has evidence for p, S is justified in believing that p, S has good reason to believe that p, p is a basic belief of S, The final primitive notion is that of a base locution set of 1, written B(l). It is the set of locutions formed by the union of those preanalytic locution sets, excluding the one to which I belongs, that is required for any reasonable attempt to define 1. The base locution set of 'S is analytic,' for example, consists in the union of the pre- analytic locution set IS is a sentence, e is a linguistic expression,... the preanalytic locution set {S is true, S is false, . . .}, and the pre- analytic locution set (S is logically true, S is tautological, S is a con- tradiction (in the narrow sense) ... }. The base locution set of the key human action locution 'S performed a'- includes the members of the preanalytic sets pertaining to causation, to events, and so on. Both preanalytic and base locution sets are governed by princi- ples of admission and completeness. A syntactical principle of admis- sion for preanalytic locution sets is that, for any A, if li is deducible from Ij by syntactical considerations alone or conversely, then at most one of li and lj is a member of A. A similar requirement of independence obtains for base locution sets. The key factors determining admission and completeness of locution sets are nonsyntactical. I am not concerned, however, with finding a general procedure for isolating or discovering locution sets here. After agreement about the composition of a locution set is reached, questions concerning the interrelations and intrarelations of locution sets arise. That is where the concern of this paper begins. The device of organizing the data into locution sets serves a clarify- ing and heuristic purpose; but this device, by itself, does not yield a method of discovering the data. The method of locution sets yields only a standard manner in which to compare and contrast philosoph- ical problems; it does not indicate which analyses or definitions are tenable. Questions of definitional adequacy are substantive, and must be answered by considering the particular proposals.</page><page sequence="5">ON PHILOSOPHICAL DEFINITIONS 155 Although the method of locution sets does not specify the mem- bership of any locution set, there is, fortunately, a consensus in some cases, or at least a well-established view, about the compositions of a locution set. We determine what the consensus or traditional view is by paying attention to the contemporary philosophical debates and by reading the history of philosophy. In the case of analyticity, Quine has isolated the primary members of the preanalytic locution set. For the composition of the preanalytic and basic locution sets per- taining to knowledge, we look toward Plato and the current discus- sions concerning 'S knows that p.' For the composition of the pre- analytic and basic locution sets pertaining to causation, to take another example, we look toward Hume and, again, the contempor- ary literature. The ways in which a locution is definable can now be specified. (Dl) I is systemically definable with respect to A iff: (i) 1EA and (ii) there is a B(l) such that I is definable using only the locutions contained in A, B(l), and the laws of logic. An appropriate logistic system, not necessarily the first-order predi- cate calculus, is assumed. (D2) I is extrasystemically definable with respect to A iff: (i) ICA and (ii) there is a B(l) and an A* such that A n A* = A and I is definable using only the locutions contained in A*, B(l),'and laws of logic. (D3)' I is purely systemically definable with respect to A iff: (i) I is systemically definable with respect to A and (ii) there is no A* such that I is extrasystemically definable with respect to A*. (D4) 1 is purely extrasystemically definable with respect to A iff: (i) I is extrasystemically definable with respect to A and'(ii) it is not the case that there is a B(l) such that I is definable using'only the locutions con- tained in A, B (l), and the laws of logic. In these definitions, the terms 'systemic' and 'extrasystemic,' rather than 'nonreductive' and 'reductive,' were used. The pair 'reductive'- 'nonreductive' is unfortunate in that it connotes an hierarchical or- dering, one indicating ontological commitment. It may-be the case that, for some locution, it is controversial whether it belongs to a particular locution set. In the case of caus- ation, for example, it appears controversial whether 'e has the power to make f happen' belongs to the preanalytic set pertaining to caus-</page><page sequence="6">156 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH ation; for, it may be claimed, this locution has anthromorphic conno- tations, and is best classified as a member of the preanalytic locution set pertaining to human activity. If a situation of this type arises, two preanalytic locution sets should be formulated, one containing the locution in question and the other excluding it. The manner in which the key locution is definable with respect to each locution set should then be determined. If we grant that it is controversial wheth- er 'e has the power to make f happen' is a member of the preanalytic locution set pertaining to causation, then we would formulate two locution sets, one including 'e has the power to make f happen' and one excluding it. It would have to be determined whether 'e caused f' is definable extrasystemically, or so on, with respect to each resulting locution set. Definitions (DI) to (D4) provide a standard procedure for classifying and examining relations between locutions; but they do not provide an alogarithm for determining the preanalytic data. Quine can be interpreted as arguing that there is no extrasystem- ic definition of 'S is analytic.' Granting that Quine is correct about this but that, contrary to Quine's claim, 'S is analytic' is antecedently intelligible, the only method of explicating 'S is analytic' is systemic- ally-that is, 'S is analytic' is purely systemically definable. Often a philosophic debate will focus on whether there is an extrasystemic definition of some key locution. One way to -think about the old-time volitional theory of action, for example, is as an attempt to define 'S performed a' extrasystemically in terms of locutions pertaining to bodily and mental events and to causation. One way to read certain phenomenalistic claims is as attempts to define 'x is a physical ob- ject' extrasystemically in terms of locutions pertaining to persons and to sensings. One way to understand the proponents of the Natu- ralistic Fallacy is that they are attempting to show that key ethical locutions, such as 'a is a right action,' cannot be defined extrasys. temically in terms of nonethical, or naturalistic, locutions. Interest- ingly, recent discussion in epistemology has taken a different turn. Definitions of 'S knows that p' in terms of locutions pertaining to truth, belief, and justification are systematic-where 'p is true' and 'S believes that p' are members of the base locution sets. The so- called Gettier problem raises the question of whether a systematic definition of 'S knows that p' is possible. I take it that much of the recent work by Chisholm and others in attempting to deal with the Gettier problem constitutes a search for an adequate systematic de- finition. To adopt a causal theory of knowledge is to give up the search and opt for an extrasystemic account, since causal locutions</page><page sequence="7">ON PHILOSOPHICAL DEFINITIONS 157 are not contained in the preanalytic or base locution sets pertaining to knowledge. In the case of causation, debate has againjfocused on whether there is an extrasystemic definition available. In the remainder of the paper, I shall present evidence for the substantive thesis that there is no tenable extrasystematic definition of the key locution '(event) e caused (event) f.' If this claim is justified, explication of 'e caused f' must proceed systemically. A possible, but unacceptable, alternative is to dismiss all causal talk. This alternative is unacceptable because causal talk is in fact intelligible and part of our ordinary way of talk- ing about the world. The descriptive metaphysician is charged with mapping segments of our ordinary conceptual framework, not with prescribing massive alterations in it. - ~~~~~~~~III The first step in applying the method of locution sets to the pro- blem of causation is to specify the preanalytic locution set pertaining to the key locution 'e caused f.' As might be expected, the history of the discussion provides clues concerning the composition of this lo- cution set. In the Treatise, Hume says the terms of efficacy, agency, power, force, energy necessity, connexion, and productive quality, are all nearly synonymous; [Bk. I, Part III, sec. XIV]. The preanalytic locution set pertaining to 'e caused f' is, translated into contemporary terminology, the following: Ac = {e caused f, it is causally necessary that if e occurs, f occur, e is causally sufficient for f, e made f happen, L is a causal law, . . Most of the missing locutions can be easily supplied, such as 'e is causally necessary for f'. and 'f is the effect of e'. If it is controversial whether some locution, 1, belongs to Ac, two locution sets, AOF and AC, would have to be formulated, where Ac contains 1 and A.c does not. The definability of 'e caused f,' then, will have to be con- sidered separately for Ac' and A c The base locution sets of 'e caused f' include those pertaining to events, to temporal ordering, and perhaps to geographic locution. A base locution set pertaining to events is needed in part because the locutions in Ac. are formulated in terms of variables ranging over events. Formulating these locutions in this way makes explicit the view that an adequate account of causation is to be grounded on an account of events. I will not now attempt to justify this claim, though</page><page sequence="8">158 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH it is of interest to note that an adequae account of human action also depends on an account of eventsO Given Ac, the preanalytic locution set pertaining to causation, and the base locution sets of 'e caused f,' the next step is to deter- mine whether there are tenable extrasystemic definitions of 'e caused f' with respect to AC. Again the best place to begin looking for such definitions is in the history of the discussion. The major extrasystematic attempt to define 'e caused f was undertaken by Hume. He proposed to define this locution in terms of locution sets pertaining only to temporal order, geeographic proxi- mity, and recurrence. In a well-known passage in the Treatise, he says We may define a CAUSE to be 'an object precedent and contiguous to another, and where all the objects resembling the former are placed in like relations of precedency and contiguity to those objects, that resemble the latter.5 4 Donald Davidson in "Causal Relations," Journal of Philosophy LXIV (1967), 691-703, argues that causation talk presupposes event talk; and Alvin Goldman in A Theory of Human Action (Englewood Cliffs, 1970) argues that human action talk presupposes event talk. The issue of the definability of 'e is an event' is also interesting in its own right. Presently, three extrasystemic views of events are being discussed in the literature. The first is that event talk is explicable in much the same way as physical object talk. Donald Davidson has defended this view in, among other places: "Events as Particu- lars," Notus IV (1970), 25-32; "Eternal vs Ephemeral Events," Nous V1 (1971), 335-48; "The Individuation of Events," in Nicholas Rescher, et al., eds., Essays in Honor of Carl G. Hempel (Dordrecht, 1969); "On Events and Event-Descriptions," in Joseph Margolis, ed, Fact and Existence (Oxford, 1969); and "The Logical Form of Action Sentences," in Nicholas Rescher, ed., Tke Logic of Decision and Action (Pittsburgh, 1967). The second view is that event talk is explicable in terms of property talk, where events are, speaking ontologically, either properties of objects or spatiotemporal locations. This view has been defended by Alvin Goldman, A Theory of Human Action, pp. 1-19 and by Jaegwon Kim in, for example. "On the PsychoPhysical Identity Theory," American Philosophical Quarterly III (1966), esp. p. 231. The third view is that event talk can be assimilated to propositional talk. This view has been defended by Roderick Chisholm in, for example, "Events and Propositions," Nous IV (1970), 15-24 and "States of Affairs Again," Nous V (1971). 171-89. 5 Bk I, Part III, sec. XIV. It is sometimes claimed that Hume offers two definitions of "cause." Several sentences after this passage quoted in the text, he says "A CAUSE is an object precedent and contiguous to another, and so united with it, that the idea of the one determines the mind to form the idea of the other, and the impression of the one to form a more lively idea of the other." These two definitions are not cointensional, since the former but not the latter is consistent with: (i) (3 e) (3 f) (e and f are events that occurred in a way that is not observable by persons and e caused f). Moreover, these two definitions are not coextensional, since it is reasonable to believe that (i) is true. It is reasonable to believe, for example, that there were causally related events before men evolved and that there will be causally related events when men cease to exist. A sympathetic reading of Hume is that the definiendium of each</page><page sequence="9">ON PHILOSOPHICAL DEFINITIONS 159 (Hume might also be interpreted as maintaining an additional, stronger thesis, namely, that 'e caused f' is purely extrasystemically definable; but this is controversial.) We can formulate Hume's proposal in the following way: (DH) For every event e and every event f, e caused f iff: (i) the occurrence of e began before the occurrence of f began: (ii) e occurred in the immediate geographic area of f; and (iii) for every event similar to e that occurred, there is some event simi- lar to f that occurred in the immediate geographic area and after it. There is some- difficulty with the contiguity condition (ii). We re- cognize cases of causation in which the causally related events, are not geographically proximate: for example,- the war in Indochina caused the disorders~on American college campuses in 1969, or the hi- jacking to Cuba of the plane carrying the heart surgeon caused the death of Smith in New York. One way out of this difficulty is simply to eliminate condition (ii)-which' Hume does, perhaps for indepen- dent reasons, in the Inquiry. Another possibility is to reconstrue the definiendium of (DH) as 'e proximately caused f' and define 'e re- motely caused f' in terms of it. Perhaps: e remotely caused f iff I there is a nonempty ordered n-tuple of events-&lt;gi, g2, . . gn &gt; such that e approximately caused go and g2 proximately caused g2 and . 'and gn proximately caused f. I prefer the simpler procedure, that of elimi- nating condition (ii); but in any case, the success or -failure of (DH) does not depend on condition (ii). A more important criticism concerns condition (i). Although we might agree that no effect. precedes its cause, there are cases of si- multaneous cause and: effect. One example appears. to be Jack's going down on the seesaw caused: Jill's going. up. Here the event of Jack's going down endures for exactly the same period of time as the event of Jill's going up. It might be . objected that the seesaw bends slightly before Jill starts to rise and also; after Jack stops going down, and hence, the events are not exactly simultaneous. One might reply that we obtain definition is distinct. In the former definition, the definiendium is 'e caused f'; and in the latter, the definiendum is '(person) S takes e to have caused If,' or some similar epistemic locution (cf. Thomas Richards, "Hume's Two definitions of 'Cause,'" The Philosophical Quarterly XV- (1965)-, 247-53.) An interesting further point is that in the Inquiry, when Hume again proposes these two definitions, he adds immediately after the one corresponding to the definition quoted in the text: "Or, in other words, where, if the first object had not been, the second [would] never [have] had existed" (sec. VII). Here we seem to have a second, distinct rendering .of 'e caused f?,.and one more in line with a necessary connection view of causation.</page><page sequence="10">160 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH a genuine instance of simultaneous causation if we think of the see- saw as inelastic. However, this reply is not wholly satisfactory, since there are no perfectly inelastic seesaws in neighborhood playgrounds. A slight change of example is required in order to meet the ob- jection. The cause in this case is again Jack's going down on the see- saw; but the effect is the seesaw's going down. Since the objects that are moving in this case, unlike the case involving Jill, are contiguous, there is no temporal lag. A final, somewhat desperate objection might be proposed. We do not have a case of causation here at all, it might be said, since the situation described involves not two events but rather a single event. This objection rests primarily on the truth of the claim: (3) Jack's going down on the seesaw = the seesaw's going down. But (3) is false. The following principle concerning event identity is exceedingly plausible: ezf only if the spatial volume in which e oc- curs is identical with the spatial volume in which f occurs. Since the spatial volume in which the seesaw goes down does not include Jack, while clearly the spatial volume in which Jack goes down includes Jack, (3) is false. Definition (DH) has to be amended in order to accommodate cases of simultaneous causation. Leaving out the contiguity condition, the revised definition is: (DH') For every event e and every event f. e caused f iff: (i) the occurrence of f did not begin before the occurrence of e began; and (ii) for every event similar to e that occurred, there is some event similar to f that occurred simultaneously or after it. However, this revised definition is inadequate. One problem for (DH') is that in general it fails to make the distinction between cause and effect. If we let e=f, then the definiens is satisfied, since every event is simultaneous with itself and condition (ii) is trivially satisfied. But no event causes itself. at least if "cause" is taken in its ordinary sense. It might be replied that this objection can be met simply by adding to the definiens an additional condition, (iii) e # f. The objection, however, cuts deeper than that. In cases of simultan- eous cause and effect, counterinstances to (DH') can be generated when we substitute for "e" a description of the effect and for "f" a description of the cause. That is, in cases of simultaneous causation, cause and effect cannot be distinguished by an appeal to the tempor- al condition, nor can they be distinguished by an appeal to the pri- mary condition of the definiens, since, for example, seesaws going</page><page sequence="11">ON PHILOSOPHICAL DEFINITIONS 161 down also regularly accompany goings down on the seesaw. Another problem for this definition, one that was noted in the eighteenth century by Thomas Reid, is distinguishing genuine cases of causation from accidental correlation. Reid's well-known example is that, although the coming of this day was not caused by the com- ing of last night, the definiens is satisfied since the coming of night regularly precedes the coming of day and this day began later than last night. The coming of this day and the coming of last night have some common causal ancestor, namely, the movements of the sun and planets; but they themselves are not related as cause to effect. C. J. Ducasse has a version of this objection in which the events in question are not even ancestrally related: although Jones' normal birth did not cause the tenth return of the moon since his mother conceived, normal births regularly precede the tenth return of the moon since conception.6 A third problem is that (DH') is not adequate to deal with cases of unique events. Suppose that e and f are such that no events that in fact occurred are similar to e and f in the relevant respects. Suppose also that e and f are causally independent and that e occurred before f. This set of circumstances is clearly logically possible. But, contrary to hypothesis, (DH') yields the result that e caused f; for condition (ii) is trivially satisfied. A related difficulty concerns the notion of similarity.7 "Similar" in (DH') does not mean "exactly similar." There is one and only one event exactly similar to e and one and only one event exactly similar to if, namely, e and f respectively. Hence, if "similar" means "exactly similar," (DH') yields the untoward result that any two events that are simultaneous or such that one occurs prior to the other are caus- ally related. Further, "similar" does not mean "similar in most re- spects." Let e be the event of Jones wielding a knife; and let f be the event of Smith dying from a stab wound. Assume, however, that Jones failed to stab Smith and that Smith was stabbed instead by a second assassin, Robinson. Thus, it is false that e caused f. Nevertheless, the definiens is satisfied. There are events similar in most (but not all) respects to Jones' action that are followed by the victim's death by stabbing. What went wrong in this case is that the events adduced 6 C. J. Ducasse, Nature, Mind, and Death (La Salle, Illinois, 1951), p. 95. 7 Cf. Arthur Pap, "Philosophical Analysis, Translation Schemas, and the Regularity Theory of Causation," Journal of Philosophy XLIX (1952), esp. pp. 657-663 and Richard Taylor, "Causation," The Monist 47 (1962-3), pp. 239 ff.</page><page sequence="12">162 PHILOSOPHY AND PI-ENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH to satisfy (ii) are not similar in. the appropriate respects to e; in par- ticular, they are not similar in the causally relevant respects. How- ever, when "similar" in (ii) is interpreted to mean "similar in the causally relevant respects," definition (DH') no longer has extra- systemic status. Revision of (DH') appears hopeless. At best,. it seems that the definiens supplies an epistemic criterion for determining whether e caused t. We have good evidence, good reason to believe, that e caused f if, to the best of our knowledge, f did not occur before. e and each time an event similar to e occurred, an event similar to f occurred. But the definiens does not state a logically sufficient con- dition for the truth of a sentence of the form 'e caused f.' Claims are sometimes made to the effect that 'e caused f' is ex- trasystemically definable in terms of locutions pertaining to human activity. Causal talk, it is said, is anthropomorphic, in that our notion of causal relations among events results from our intervening into the normal course of events by performing actions. This view has been held by Collingwood, and has been recently defended by Doug- las Gasking.8 Gasking's idea is that we assert that events are causally re- lated when we have a manipulative technique for bringing about one event by making the other happen. For example, we claim that strik- ing matches causes them to ignite because we have techniques for striking matches such that the match ignites as a result of applying this technique. Reformulating somewhat, Gasking suggests: (DG) For every event e and every event f, e caused f iff: (i) the occurrence of f did not begin before the occurrence of e began; and (ii) there is a person S such that S used a manipulative technique for making e occur and f occurred. This definition, however, is subject to counterexamples from the preanalytic data. The pull of the moon.causes particular tide forma- tions on earth and the -coming of the ice age caused the extinction of dinosaurs, although no person can bring about the manipulations needed to make the moon exert a gravitational force or make an ice age occur.-. Forseeing this difficulty, Gasking argues that sometimes the manipulative techniques in question concern not individual events but rather sorts of events. Although we cannot bring about the extinction of a species by producing an ice age, we can bring 8 R. G. Collingwood, An Essay on Metaphysics (Oxford, 1962; first published 1940), Part III c.

But this revised definition shares difficulties with the Humean proposal (DH'). In the first place, it fails to distinguish between case of correlation and causation. For example, there may be, by sheer coincidence, some intricate and esoteric dance such that each performance of it has been followed by rain. In that case, the defin- iens of (DG) is satisfied, despite causal independence. Secondly, the second disjunct of condition (ii') is problematical. If "relevantly similar" means "exactly similar," then since only e is exactly similar to e and only f is exactly similar to f, (ii') collapses to (ii); and hence, the problem confronting Gasking's original definition remains. Further "relevantly similar" does not mean "similar in many (or, in most) respects." For if it did, counterinstances can be generated: events e and f might be causally independent even though events similar in many respects to them are causally related. In order to avoid the counterinstances, "relevantly similar" in (ii') has to be interpreted to mean "similar in the causally relevant respects." But in that case, the cost of avoiding the counterinstances is the failure to sustain (DG) as an extrasystemic definition. Another traditional extrasystematic attempt to define 'e caused f' is in terms of locutions pertaining to logical necessity. Brand Blan- shard is the most able recent defender of this view.10 Blanshard ar- gues that a person's way of thinking in moving from premises to conclusion in a valid deductive argument is exactly similar to his way of thinking when he reasons from cause to effect. Since his way of thinking in deductive argumentation depends solely on the logical- ly necessary connection between the premises and the conclusion, and since the way of thinking in causal reasoning is the same, there is a logically necessary connection between cause and effect. These claims are intended to justify the following (reformulated) defini- tion: 9 Gasking, p. 483. 10 See, for example, his Reason and Analysis (La Salle, Illinois, 1962), Chapter XI.</page><page sequence="14">164 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH (DB) For every X and every Y, X caused X iff: (i) X is not later than Y; and (ii) X is the set of conditions each member of which is logically neces- sary for Y and which jointly are logically sufficient for Y. Blanshard's justification for (DB) has strong overtones of idealism. It presupposes that we can determine what is the case by determin- ing our way of thinking about what is the case. However, even if the idealism-realism issue is left aside, this justification for (DB) is problematical. The way of thinking involved in causal reasoning is similar to, but not exactly like that of logical reasoning. In causal reasoning, if an appeal is made to laws, it is made to contingent, that is, factual laws. But such laws are not an indispensable part of logical reasoning. I can make successful armchair discoveries about logical matters; but I cannot make discoveries about causal connections without some experience of the factual conditions. In any case, the resulting definition (DB) is defective. The range of X and Y in (DB) is ambiguous. According to condition (ii), X and Y are sets of statements; for it is statements that are the arguments of ". . is logically necessary for . . ." and ". . is logically sufficient for ... ." But, according to condition (i), X and Y range over events or complexes of events; for it is events that are temporally ordered. More importantly, the definiendum of (DB) requires that X and Y range over events, or at least that they not range over statements, since the causal relation is a relation between events. Even ignoring this ambiguity, definition (DB) is problematical. It fails to account for the asymmetry between cause and effect. The predicate ". . . is later then . . ." is not asymmetrical; and the predicate ". . . is the set of conditions logically necessary and sufficient for . . ." is symmetri- cal. This objection to (DB) can also be made by pointing out that counterexamples arise in cases of simultaneous causation in which a description of the effect is substituted for X and a description of the cause is substituted for Y. Another extrasystemic attempt to define 'e caused f' is to claim that this locution is explicable by means of ostensive definition. Ac- cording to this view, 'e caused f' can be made intelligible solely by means of pointing to, indicating, cases of causation. By observing certain cloud characteristics and then the coming of rain, by observ- ing the drinking of certain quantities of alcholic beverages and the behavior of an individual, we learn to recognize causal connections. Causation can be made intelligible without specifying its relation to notions such as making something happen, being necessarily connect- ed, or so on. (I do not know of any treatment of causation of this</page><page sequence="15">ON PHILOSOPHICAL DEFINITIONS 165 sort in the literature; it is a proposal, however, that has been sug- gested to me several times.) It should be noted, first, that if this attempt to explicate 'e caused f' is correct, then, if every locution can be ostensively defined, it can be generalized to the claim that no locution is purely system- ically definable. However, this proposal confuses ostensive defini- tions with the sort of philosophical definition illustrated by (DH), (DG) and so on. The definiens of (D2), the definition of being extra- systemically definable, specifies that the locution I be definable using only the locutions of some preanalytic and basic locution sets. All extrasystemic definitions, that is, are in terms of locutions; they indicate, as it were, analytic connections. But ostensive definitions do not explicate one locution in terms of others. Ostensive definition concerns the applicability of a locution; it is concerned with deter- mining whether a locution, such as 'Y is red,' applies in some parti- cular case, whether that case is familiar or not. We use the technique of ostensive definition to teach others the range of applicability of some locution. Ostensive definitions are broadly epistemic: they do not state logically necessary and sufficient conditions for a locution. Pointing or indicating cases of causation does not specify the logical relations that the locution 'e caused f' bears to other locutions. Knowing the applicability of 'e caused f' is necessary for determining the adequacy of a philosophical definition such as (DG); but being able to point to cases of causation does not insure that we can spe- cify the logical relations of this locution. Probably the most interesting recent attempt to explicate 'e caused f' extrasystemically has been in terms of laws of nature. The core of this view can be specified as follows. Let L be a conjunction of sentences L,, L2, . . ., Ln, where each Li is a causal law that obtains in the world (i.e., the "real" world) and where for any L*, if L* is a causal law that obtains in the world, then L* LI v L'-L2 v . . . V L*;- Ln. Similarly, I is the conjunction of I, I2. In, where each Ii is a sentence describing an initial condition obtaining in the world and where for any I*, if I* is a sentence describing an initial condi- tion obtaining in the world, then I* _ II v I*-I2 v . .. v I* In. Also, let us introduce the predicate "O . . .," where ". . ." is replaced by the name of an event or a variable ranging over events and which is read ". . . occurs (occurred, will occur)." Now, to the temporal condition specifying that f did not begin before e began, we add (LN) H (L &amp; 1) D (Oe D Of) but not I- L v (Oe D Of), nor I D (Oe D Of).</page><page sequence="16">166 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH That is, e caused f just in case f did not occur before e and that e occurred only if f occurred follows from the causal laws of nature and the initial conditions. There are, obviously, problems for this proposal. One set of pro- blems concerns the initial conditions. For example, is a Carnapian state description adequate to specify the set of initial conditions? Is an initial-condition description ever in fact specifiable, since if rela- tional predicates are to be incorporated, it threatens to consist of an infinite number of conjuncts? However, I shall deal only with the is. sues concerning laws of nature, in part because these difficulties alone defeat this extrasystemic definition of 'e caused f.'11 If this definition is to be sustained as an extrasystemic definition, there must be some way to explicate 'L is a causal law' without ap- pealing to any other member of the preanalytic locution set AC. The situation is analogous to the attempt to explicate 'S is analytic' by using the notion of synonymy and then trying to explicate '(expres- sion) e is synonymous with (expression) e" without appealing to members of the preanalytic locution set pertaining to analyticity. It is clear that L is not the conjunction of all nomic universals, where "nomic universal" is taken to name any nonlogical law used by the scientific community in its scientific work. For not all nomic universals express a universal causal relation. Some nomic univers- als, for example, state a functional interdependence between magni- tudes. The ideal gas law, PV = nRT, does not say that a change in pressure, volume, or absolute temperature causes or brings about a change in the others; rather, it 'Asserts that a change in volume (or pressure) accompanies a change in absolute temperature. That the laws of functional interdependence do not express a universal causal relation is evident from the fact that these statements are symmetric- al, whereas statements of causal dependency are asymmetrical. Bio- logical development laws constitute another kind of noncausal nomic universal. For example, in the nomic universal "The formation of lungs in human embryos never precedes the formation of the circu- latory system," it is not being claimed that the formation of the cir- culatory system causes the formation of the lungs. Although the for- mation of the circulatory system and the formation of the lungs are 11 Hempel and others draw a distinction between law statements and law-like statements, where the latter are exactly like the former except that they might be false. See, for example, Hempel's "Studies in the Logic of Explanation," reprinted in Aspects of Scientific Explanation (New York. 1965), pp. 256 ff. Having noted this distinction, I shall for simplicity ignore it.</page><page sequence="17">ON PHILOSOPHICAL DEFINITIONS 167 the (remote) effects of a single cause, they merely accompany each other in a regular temporal pattern and are not related as cause to effect. In order to sustain (LN) as an extrasystemic proposal, the subset of nomic universals that are causal laws must be isolated without appealing to any causal notion. One defense - call it "the primary defense"- is that the causal laws are interstate laws. This view is widely held by philosophers of science; Philipp Frank, for example, says: We shall call every law a causal law which allows us to infer from information about one region of space and time some information about another region of space and time.l2 On this view the dynamical laws of Newtonian mechanics comprise the core of causal laws, the primary one being (NM) P=m d dt For it is these laws that enable -us to determine the state of the system at a time given its state at some other time. The laws of statics are not causal laws on the primary defense, since they are intrastate laws. The characterization of other kinds of laws as per., training to fluid continuia, fields, and so on, depends on the tenability of the special case of the Newtonian dynamical laws. The primary defense, however, is not adequate. Since all causal laws are intrastate laws, it follows that there are no causal laws concerning simultaneous causation, and hence, no true singular statements of simultaneous causation. But there are cases yf simul- taneous causation: one example is lack's going down on the seesaw caused the seesaw's going down. Statement (NM) and similar statements are formulated in terms of state variables. In (NM), the velocities and locations of the mass points are determined for an instantaneous time, where an instan- taneous time is a state of the system. On the commonsense view, causal laws are formulated in terms of variables ranging over events. Events endure; they take time to occur; they are not instantaneous. Some philosophers, for example, Ducasse and von Wright,"3 hold that some events do not involve change. They are, as it were, un- changes. Jack's remaining perfectly stationary on the seesaw is an 12 Philosophy of Science (Englewood Cliffs, 1957). p. 264. Similar views are held by Hempel, "Aspects of Scientific Explanation" in Aspects, pp. 347 ff. and Arthur Burks, "The Logic of Causal Propositions," Mind 60 (1951), 363-82. 13 Ducasse, Nature, Mind, and Death, pp. 108 ff; Georg Henrik von Wright, Norm and Action (New York, 1963), Chap, II.</page><page sequence="18">168 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH event, but not one involving change. However, both sorts of events, changes and unchanges, take time. Causal laws, conceived on the model of Newtonian dynamics, are laws for closed systems. The systems are closed in that the only variables taken into consideration are the variables of state. External factors, that is, the boundary conditions, are assumed to have no influence on the system. Laws such as (NM) are to be thought of as being qualified by a ceteris paribus clause saying that external factors are irrelevant. Since the system is closed, there is a positive and exhaustive formulation of this ceteris paribus clause. It says that the initial conditions and only the initial conditions, which can be exhaustvely given by assigning a value to every state variable, are to be the conditions used in determining the state of the system at any time. (It is true that in the Newtonian case certain other assump- tions are made. For instance, it is assumed that the bodies are negli- gibly small in relation to their distances. These additional assump- tions, however, are not to be included in the ceteris paribus clause. Rather, they pertain to the meanings of the terms in which the laws and initial conditions are stated. The assumption about the size of a body, for example, is included in the meaning of the term "mass point.") The situation is different for ordinary causal laws. Examples of ordinary causal laws are: (4) Throwing bricks against windows produces the windows' breaking; (5) Heart stoppage in normal persons produces death; (6) Conductors make orchestras begin playing by lowering their batons. These generalizations pertain to open systems. There is no explicit set of boundary conditions for an ordinary causal law. Statement (4), for example, must also be qualified by a ceteris paribus clause. But the factors that have to be taken into consideration in the clause are not definitely enumerable. Statement (4), as stated, is false. Some bricks are thrown against"unbreakable"windows; sometimes a brick's flight is interrupted, and so on. In order for (4) to be made true, a ceteris paribus clause must be added that excludes these and other interfering conditions. There is, however, no informative and sys- tematic way to do this. The best that can be done is to specify some vague clause saying that there are no extraordinary circumstances, or that background conditions are standard as compared with other</page><page sequence="19">ON PHILOSOPHICAL DEFINITIONS 169 situations, or some such. The ceteris paribus clause of an ordinary causal law is not even a promissory note; there is no expectation that the class of relevant factors can be informatively and exhaustively isolated. It should be emphasized that a terminological issue is not in question. I am not disputing the right to label nomic universals such as the laws of motion "causal laws." Rather, I am arguing for the substantive claim that the laws of motion and similar statements are significantly different from what we ordinarily and from the commonsense point of view take to be causal laws. If one were to persist in calling the laws of motion and similar statements "causal laws," then the claim is, stated somewhat paradoxically, that ordi- nary causal laws are not causal laws. No matter how valuable the laws of motion and similar statements are - and there is no doubt of their value, they are excluded from the class of genuine causal laws. That the range of the variables and the content of the ceteris paribus clause are not the same for ordinary causal laws as for causal laws on the primary defense is symptomatic of an even greater difference between these two kinds of laws. Statement (NM) occurs within a developed theory, The terms of this theory do not refer to the objects or phenomena of our ordinary experience. What we ordinarily understand by "force," for example, bears an intimate relationship to "F" in the equations of motion; but whatever exactly this relationship is, it is not one of identity. There are, presumably, metalinguistic statements that correlate or "bridge the gap" between "force" and "F." These bridge-statements are needed precisely be- cause "force" and "F" are not identical in meaning. We all know the advantages of refining and redefining our ordinary notions. But the fact remains that after this refining process, the resulting notion is distinct from the one with which we began. "Mass point" just does not refer to the sort of object we encounter in our daily lives. In short, the primary defense of (LN) as an extrasystematic proposal fails. Ordinary causal laws cannot be specified as the set of interstate laws, particularly Newtonian dynamical laws. A closer look at the structure of ordinary causal laws shows that this result is to be expected. The general form of an ordinary causal law is (7) (x) [Fx O) (y) (Gy :D xRy)] where 'x' and 'y' are replaced by descriptions of sorts of events. Ordinary causal laws have what I shall call the property of express- ing productivity. Statements of the form (7) have this property</page><page sequence="20">170 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH only if: (i) R is asymmetrical; and (ii) the statement entails, but not necessarily in virtue of syntactical considerations alone, that x is the producer and that y is produced. This second condition can be labeled the condition of producer isolation. Thus, for example, statement (4) meets both necessary conditions for having the prop- erty of expressing productivity. The relation ". . . produces . . ." is asymmetrical; and (4) entails that the throwing of the bricks is the producer and that the breaking of the windows is produced. The Newtonian laws of motion, however, satisfies neither condition. Written in standard form, (NM) is (8) (x) [x= F 2;(y) (y = m xt DX=y)]. In this case R is '=,' which is symmetrical. This statement, more- over, does not satisfy the condition of producer isolation; it fails to indicate which of several kinds of processes is taking place. It does not distinguish, for example, processes in which, for a constant mass, an increased force is producing an increased acceleration and process in which, again for a constant mass, an increased acceleration is producing an increased force. But now, if it is correct to charac- terize ordinary causal laws as having the property of expressing productivity, then no extrasystematic definition 'e causes f' in terms of 'L is a causal law' is forthcoming. For the locution '(statement) S expresses productivity' is a member of the preanalytic locution set pertaining to causation. Put another way, statements having the property of expressing productivity are perspicuously written when R is "produces," as in (4) and (5). The locution "(event sort) x pro- duces (event sort) y" is clearly a-member of the preanalytic locution set pertaining to causation. Let me briefly mention a related extrasystematic attempt to define 'e caused f,' namely, in terms of counterfactual conditionals. This definition is formulated by adding to the condition stating that f did not occur before e, the condition (CF) f would not have occurred if e had not occurred. A condition stating that e is not identical to f is also required. . To begin with, this proposal is subject to counterexamples de- riving from cases of overdeterminism. Suppose that our man Jones is shot to death by a firing squad. Assume also that being placed in front of the firing squad distresses him to the extent that he has a heart attack, such that if he had not died from the bullet wounds, it would have killed him. Now, let e be Jones' being shot by the firing squad and f be Jones' dying. Hence, the definiendum is satis- fied; but the definiens of is not, since (CF) does not obtain. Jones</page><page sequence="21">ON PHILOSOPHICAL DEFINITIONS 171 would have died even if the execution were cancelled at the last moment, for by that time he had had a heart attack which would have brought about his death. More importantly, this definition also fails to be extrasystematic; for the locution in condition (CF) is itself a member of the preana- lytic locution set pertaining to causation. An often defended view about the truth conditions of a counterfactual conditional is what I shall call the deduction theory, According to this theory, a counter- factual is true just in case the indicative of the consequent is deduc- ible from the indicative of the antecedent, the background condi- tions, and other statements. Leaving aside the difficult problems in specifying the background conditions, the specification of these "other statements" precludes an extrasystemic account.14 In parti- cular, these other statements must be the causal laws. But in that case, the account fails to be extrasystemic, since "L is a causal law" is a member of the preanalytic set of locutions pertaining to causa- tion and for which no extrasystemic definition is available. It is important to emphasize that no proof has been given for the claim that 'e caused f' is purely systemically definable. Rather, good evidence for this claim has been supplied. The evidence con- sisted in showing that all the available, plausible extrasystematic definitions of 'e caused f} are either subject to counterinstances or that they in fact fail to be extrasystemic. There would be conclusive evidence that 'e caused f' is purely extrasystemically definable if it were shown that all plausible extrasystemic definitions are unaccep- table. The possibility remains that some extrasystemic proposal, now unknown, will be adequate. The discussion about causation is then at the stage of supplying a systemic definition of 'e caused f.' It should not be thought, how- ever, that this task is easily accomplished. One recent attempt at a systemic definition has been in terms of causally necessary and sufficient conditions. Notice that the most straightforward such definition is inadequate: namely, (DC) For every event e and every event f, e caused f iff: (i) the occurrence of f did not begin before the occurrence of e began; and (ii) e is causally necessary and sufficient for f. The definiens of this definition fails to specify the required asymme- try between cause and effect, since the relation ". . . is causally 14 On the difficulties of specifying the background conditions, see Nelson Good- man, Fact, Fiction, and Forecast (Indianapolis, 1965), Chap. 1.

Moreover, definition (DC) fails to take into account manv ordinary cases. For example. it does not cover cases in which the cause is sufficient but not necessary for the effect. Suppose that the dropping of the lighted match causes the paper in the trash can to ignite. The dropping of the match is not sufficient for the igniting of the paper because oxygen must also be present. Some recent work has been done to repair (DC), most notably by J. L. Mackie.15 I will not here enter into the discussion of reconstructing definition (DC). Rather, I want to emphasize that the evidence is overwhelmingly in favor of defining 'e caused f purely systemically. MYLES BRAND.
