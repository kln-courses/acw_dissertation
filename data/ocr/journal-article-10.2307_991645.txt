<plain_text><page sequence="1">Nature and the Antique in the Work of Andrea Palladio BRUCE BOUCHER University College London Nature and the antique are themes inextricably woven into Andrea Palladio's career.' Of the two, the antique is one component that distinguishes Palladio's architecture from that of almost any other Renais- sance architect. So persuasive are his reconstructions of ancient buildings that they have often been regarded as objective, their authority seeming to foreclose discussion of any discrepancies. While modern scholarship has recog- nized that Palladio's reconstructions of ancient buildings are problematic, his reasoning has received less attention than his drawings and woodcuts per se; yet, when taken together, both graphic and written evidence indicates that Palladio evolved a theory in which ancient and modern buildings were subsumed into broader considerations of the mimetic character of art as well as the parallel processes underlying its operations and those of nature. Both the Quattro libri and Palladio's occasional writings provide a rich source of infor- mation about the assumptions underlying his response to nature and the antique. They also demonstrate a more doc- trinaire approach to good architectural practice in Palladio's later years, one in which his own works and those of Roman architecture fused into a seamless whole. Born in Padua in 1508 and spending the first thirty- three years of his life in the Veneto, Palladio did not have the immediate advantage of those architects with access to Rome and its antiquities, nor did he appreciate at first the significance of Roman architecture. In the introduction to his magnum opus, the Quattro libri, he tells us candidly that at first he was scarcely aware of how important ancient architecture was, and it was only the impact of successive visits to Rome in the 1540s-four in all, plus a later, puta- tive visit in 1554-that opened his eyes.2 An indication of the change in Palladio's approach can be seen in his early drawings of capitals and entablatures from Roman tri- umphal arches, now in the Museo Civico of Vicenza (Fig- ures 1, 2). Palladio probably copied these drawings when he was still a relatively junior member of a workshop in Vicenza during the 1530s, undoubtedly before his first trip to Rome in 1541. What is interesting about the sheets is the fact that Palladio went back to them later, covering up their original capitals with a second version that he made in light of his own studies in Rome.3 This process of criticism and refinement of his ideas stayed with Palladio throughout his career, although the end product did not always enjoy a straightforward relationship with the antique. Palladio's earliest surviving drawings after the antique show a penchant for telling details, a response conditioned by his long training as a stonemason.4 These sheets were filed away and later incorporated into his own architecture, as with the base moldings employed by Palladio for the Composite order of the Loggia del Capitaniato, which were adapted from the unusual profile of the Corinthian base of the Maison Carrie in Nimes (Figure 3).5 Initially for Palla- dio, the antique constituted a vast repertory of motifs that could be adapted to specific solutions in his own architec- ture, depending upon site, scale, and visibility.

Museo Civico, Vicenza (D10v) this was already established practice in the circle around Bramante at Saint Peter's, especially in the case of Raphael, Peruzzi, and Antonio da Sangallo the Younger.6 Like that of his predecessors, Palladio's interpretation of ancient architecture can sometimes seem arbitrary; yet he sought from it a validation of his own architectural theories, and, increasingly in the latter part of his career, he expanded these ideas to include the laws governing nature as well. A few examples of his response will have to serve for many others. The remains of one of the great monuments of the Roman Forum, the Basilica of Maxentius, were misread by Palladio and Baldassare Peruzzi who saw two apses on the north and south sides of the building, whereas subsequent studies have shown that there was actually a lateral entrance on the south side (Figure 4).7 This expectation of symme- try in classical architecture occurs often in Renaissance reconstructions since it was an aesthetic preference believed to have existed in ancient buildings. It was also the guiding r::::: -E c aglsrssglg~lll~"8B~,~ -~Y~~i;-:_: ': i I i: : ::~:: ~ei~-b ?:- ? i ?raE?rJarc~a~;aR?~?~?~pc~as~ar~?a~iJr::i : i ; -~a$PaB'~E~g~i~~:~~;~ ii: " "~:?i-- 1 BRIi,:Ii R,:' ai~ i_ i Figure 2 Detail of Figure 1 with flap in place showing revised capital principle behind Palladio's reconstruction of virtually all ancient complexes, like the fragmentary Baths of Agrippa, which he turned into a variation on better-preserved Roman structures like the Baths of Caracalla. There he went so far as to link up Agrippa's thermal complex with another beloved ancient building, the Pantheon, in a kind of summa summarum of Roman architectural forms (Figure 5).8 Pal- ladio's approach to reconstructing the antique shared Peruzzi's aesthetic bias, and both had few qualms about recasting such evidence in the light of their expectations.9 In a similar vein, Palladio followed the example of Pirro Lig- orio when he corrected "irregularities" in his reconstruc- tion of the small Temple of Clitumnus near Spoleto: he 17 IA -!- Figure 3 Palladio, detail of the base molding of the Corinthian order of the Maison Caree, Nimes, from the Quattro libri (1570), IV, p. 115 NATURE AND THE ANTIQUE 297</page><page sequence="3">I L~L -I\ 2 0 z~~r"^r~ ij .\10 7 ui~ I . ~i , i? itS(6? ic, Figure 4 Baldassare Peruzzi, plan of the Basilica of Maxentius, Rome, c. 1520, pen and ink.

Museo Civico, Vicenza (D33r) adjusted the proportions of the columns and gave them standard Corinthian capitals as well as regularizing the interpenetration of large and small orders; neither, for that matter, did Palladio give any indications of the temple's odd site or of its tympanum reliefs or Christian inscriptions (Figure 6).10 On the other hand, Palladio could be much more dili- gent in his reconstructions than many of his contempo- raries. An example of this can be seen in his reconstruction of the Mausoleum of Romulus on the Via Appia. Only the basement of the tomb to the deified son of Maxentius sur- vives, together with the precinct wall, of what was a sub- stantial complex." Palladio's ground plan does not differ very much from an earlier one reproduced by Serlio in his third book, first published in 1540, but it contains a wealth of detailed measurements not found on Serlio's woodcut (Figures 7, 8).12 Palladio not only draws the substructure but also proceeds to make a conjectural reconstruction of the tomb, which he believed to be a temple, and clearly its out- line put him in mind of the Pantheon. Thus, the plan of the main floor and its elevation resemble that most admired of Roman buildings in miniature. Surprisingly, when Palladio came to publish the work in Book Four of the Quattro libri, he omitted all but the slightest reference to his reconstruc- tion at the top of the woodcut. He may have felt there was too much of an element of wish fulfillment in it, for he changed the text referring to the portico several times. Ini- tially, he wrote, "I have placed the columns which were [truly] of this dimension because one sees the foundations and the distance from one to the other," crossing out "truly" in the manuscript version in favor of "I believe."" In the printed text, Palladio observed that the foundations of the portico remained even though the columns had been removed; "nevertheless," he added, "I have given them the size and intervals that the foundations suggest they had."14 Palladio concluded his remarks by stating that no elevation was given because no ornamental elements survived. Despite his hesitation, the consensus among later archae- ologists is that the building was Pantheonic in style, and eighteenth- and nineteenth-century elevations of the mau- soleum followed Palladio's intuition.is On some occasions, Palladio went farther than many of his contemporaries in projecting his own preconceptions onto the often ambiguous evidence of classical buildings. A significant example can be studied in his elevations of the Roman Theater at Verona. If we compare Palladio's draw- ing of the second terrace above the theater with an earlier study, ascribed to Giovanbattista da Sangallo and executed shortly after 1519, we find a much fuller reconstruction in the former than in the latter (Figures 9, 10).16 Both drafts- 298 JSAH / 59:3, SEPTEMBER 2000</page><page sequence="4">b ' i::i:::::i::- - . ... i: ::::: :-::---:-::_,i;--: ::: ::i iP - i ~-;-- I- iii '???::;: ?-??--- ?:.~?~: '-- '? .:... : : ::-1-:1::;_:1-:,-:;~iii~;-:::-: -:--::- .r .

In contrast, Palladio invests his order with a standard Doric frieze as well as ren- dering the brick bays more uniform, the opus reticulatum and opus vittatum more elaborate than seems to have been the case. Sangallo's drawing is closer to the evidence of the site as it survives, whereas Palladio has taken obvious liberties in order to endow the theater terrace with a more uniform fagade. As the measurements on Palladio's drawing are expressed in piedi antichi-a unit not employed by Palladio in his own drawings-it also seems likely that he based his elevation upon another architect's drawing, as Burns plau- sibly suggested." Palladio's major novelty lies in the substi- tution of cylindrical bases for the conventional Attic base, together with an extended plinth beneath, features that Pal- ladio also added to his companion elevation of the Tuscan order of the lower terrace at Verona.

Uffizi, Gabinetto dei Disegni (1349A) too, may have been conjectural because surviving evidence indicates that there was no base, only a small plinth running at ground level."' Palladio knew from Vitruvius that the Tuscan order could have a circular plinth, but he fused apophyge, torus, and plinth into a cylindrical whole in his reconstruction of the order here. Such a fusion ran counter to Vitruvius's advice in Book IV of the De Architectura, and Palladio's solu- tion here contrasted sharply with those published by Cesar- iano, Serlio, Barbaro, and Vignola as well as his own canonical presentation of the order in the Quattro libri.19 It was even more unusual to combine this with a Doric entab- lature as he did in the elevation of the second terrace at Verona, but Palladio obviously believed the Doric and Tus- can orders were interchangeable on the same principles as the Ionic and Corinthian orders were held to be. This same cylindrical base was employed by Palladio on the smaller order of his Basilica arcades where they not only enhanced the all'antica character of the whole design, but also avoided problems of tripping up pedestrians, as might have hap- pened with a base and square plinth.20 Palladio's advocacy of this base and plinth solution may be even more complex because there was a tradition of circular bases of this kind in Veneto architecture of the late fifteenth century in the cir- 300 JSAH / 59:3, SEPTEMBER 2000</page><page sequence="6">-i!!ii-iiii:iiil :ii-ii i-i ! ::r 3 : . . .iiiI Iii . ::.

According to Vitruvius, all the members of a tem- ple had to be in proportion to one another: "For without symmetry and proportion no temple can have a regular plan; that is, it must have an exact proportion worked out after the fashion of the members of a finely-shaped human body."25 This was a locus classicus for the Renaissance, and anthropomorphic analogies were frequently invoked in dis- cussions of architectural planning. Palladio endorsed the concept, although he did not employ the Vitruvian analogy in his account of temples in Book Four of the Quattro libri.26 Palladio's preliminary elevation drawing for the Quattro libri woodcut includes a detailed study of the column base and top of the pedestal, with a note to the effect that the remain- der of the pedestal was under earth and that there had been steps between the pedestals (Figure 11).27 Neither did he repeat this information in the Quattro libri-where he stated that the pedestals were as tall as the intercolumniation of the middle columns-nor did he mention that several other features had been changed to fit his aesthetic preferences. Here, too, a sketch of the facade by Peruzzi already antici- pated Palladio's solution by rectifying the proportions of the pedestals; yet other elements in Peruzzi's drawing remain more faithful to the actual temple faqade (Figure 12).28 The discrepancy between what Palladio presented in NATURE AND THE ANTIQUE 301</page><page sequence="7">....    ,  ,jgj? ?::: ::ij:i,ij   @ "=I ...:. tI~ I' Figure 13 Fagade of the Temple of Minerva, from G. Antolini, II tempio di Minerva in Assisi confrontato colle tavole di Andrea Palladio architetto di Vicenza (Milan, 1803) his treatise and the actual building posed a problem for his admirers ever since eighteenth-century travelers began vis- iting Assisi to inspect the temple. Goethe made a special pilgrimage there and was shocked by what he saw, conclud- ing that Palladio could never have visited the site.29 A few years later, Giovanni Antolini published detailed compar- isons of the temple with Palladio's woodcuts, which appeared to confirm Goethe's suspicions (Figure 13).30 Antolini's own measurements and plates bear eloquent tes- timony to how widely Palladio's version strayed from real- ity. This was not simply a question of the pedestals and steps but also extended into making the portico three columns deep, substituting his standard capitals for the squatter ones of the temple itself, and virtually doubling the height of the pediment. Antolini also believed that Palladio must have relied upon faulty information received at second hand. Evi- dence points, however, to Palladio's having visited Assisi, and one must assume his published alterations were delib- erate.3" The question then becomes, why did he take such liberties with the antique? As we have seen, Palladio did not hesitate to tailor the evidence to meet his expectations. With the Basilica of Max- entius or the Lateran Baptistery, this meant returning the building to its pristine state; with the Temple of Minerva at Assisi, it meant imagining what the Roman architect had done, or, perhaps, what he ought to have wanted to do.32 In other cases-like the Temples of the Divine Hadrian, Cas- tor and Pollux, and Venus Genetrix-Palladio exploited the ambiguous nature of the ruins in order to impose an ortho- dox reconstruction in light of Vitruvian theory.33 This cre- ative approach was by no means limited to ancient buildings, for Palladio could not resist cosmetic adjustments to the proportions of Bramante's Tempietto, which he intro- duced among the temples of Book Four.34 It was also the guiding principle behind the numerous changes imposed on his own buildings in Books Two and Three. For exam- ple, the Vicentine Basilica is shown as an ideal construction, with no indication of the problems of site that hampered the creation of a uniform faqade.35 Similarly, Palladio repro- duces the new faqade of Palazzo Barbaran da Porto, which 302 JSAH / 59:3, SEPTEMBER 2000</page><page sequence="8">::-::::-: :~: 5~i:--i-- ~I ': ~hV~ ~a~? ~.

A comparison of the actual plan with that in the Quattro libri shows almost painful discrepancies, and Bertotti Scamozzi, who first published the real ground plan in the 1770s, fretted over Palladio's disregard for the truth.36 The point is, however, that Palladio felt he was responding to a higher truth by presenting designs, whether his own or by other people, that corresponded to his own preconcep- tions rather than merely illustrating the accidental state of an existing structure. For the author of the Quattro libri, this procedure could be applied as easily to ancient buildings as to his own. Beyond that, Palladio was well aware of Daniele Bar- baro's observation on architectural license: "One does not always have to observe the same rules and symmetries because the nature of the site often requires a different kind !r ?e ?ir~ grlf5jt ~c* fl~ `li~Z~;j~?l~~EPd~iE;P)i~;~86 t~-;a r ?1 ~? o. *17~L~ ~t-1- i i?rr r L1 " t+r * T ?d- UItt bllj~ ~?9 %gE~`:_:-:;?-?--------?-?? ?u 4?jl --- ?? ??? - ? -?

However, in this case, as Vitruvius says, one recognizes the ingenuity and judiciousness of the architect, who, by taking away or adding more to the mea- surements, works in such a manner that the eye plays its part and governs necessity with fine and subtle reasoning.""37 Barbaro's remarks came in his notes on Vitruvius's discus- sion of proportion in architecture and the necessity for modifications to suit the site, but Barbaro turned the occa- sion into a caution against following Vitruvius slavishly, cit- ing examples of classical buildings that went against Vitruvian dicta but still had a pleasing effect. Palladio evidently approved of Barbaro's appeal to the eye and judgment of the architect, for he employed a simi- lar freedom when dealing with antique motifs in the latter part of his career, as, for example, with the use of a colossal order on the main facades of the Loggia del Capitaniato and the Villa Sarego at Santa Sofia.38 Despite this, his treatment NATURE AND THE ANTIQUE 303</page><page sequence="9">of the antique in the Quattro libri is governed by what could be called normative criteria. In Book One, Palladio presents standard versions of the five orders; the variations that he allows in Book Four are essentially limited to decorative motifs, the occasional capital-like those of the Temple of Fortuna Virilis or the Temple of Castor and Pollux-and, of course, a variety of Composite bases, whose profiles caught his eye.39 Inevitably, Palladio's vision of the antique as pre- sented in Book Four is much more homogeneous, much tidier than the real thing; neither is there, as Spielmann observed, a sense of historical development from Greek to Roman nor from republican to imperial architecture.40 Where Vitruvius recommended symmetry in temples, Pal- ladio, like Barbaro, felt it should be applied to the whole range of antique architecture, and the antique thus became a consistent phenomenon in which Palladio's theory found confirmation through his reconstructions. If the evidence did not square with his theories, then it could be changed accordingly. Palladio goes some way toward explaining his thoughts on these issues in chapter twenty of Book One of the Quat- tro libri. That chapter deals with the abusi, or departures from good architectural practice. Having presented the five orders according to the best ancient examples, he warns his readers against bad practices introduced by the "barbar- ians." Like all the arts, architecture imitates nature, and nothing could endure that departed from her instruction. He paraphrases the famous Vitruvian account of the origins of building whereby stone gradually supplanted wood and extends this point with an analogy between columns and trees, noting that both taper as they rise upward. To Palla- dio, the concept of structural supports that look plausible is essential since he inveighs against broken pediments or columns that do not seem sufficiently load-bearing. The whole passage ends with a famous peroration: "And although variety and novelty must please everyone, one should not do anything against the precepts of the art and against what reason makes manifest to us; hence one sees that the ancients also made variations, but they never departed from certain universal and essential rules of this art, as shall be seen in my books on antiquities."41 Such topoi were not unusual and were repeated in one form or another by many contemporary and classical authors. The main source for Palladio's critique of unnat- ural architecture was Vitruvius's famous contrast between acceptable and unacceptable sorts of wall painting: But these which were imitations based upon reality are now disdained by the improper taste of the present. On the stucco are monsters rather than definite representations taken from definite things. Instead of columns there rise up stalks; instead of gables, striped panels with curled leaves and volutes. Can- delabra uphold pictured shrines and above the summits of these, clusters of thin stalks rise from their roots in tendrils with little figures seated upon them at random. Again, slender stalks with heads of men and of animals attached to half the body. Such things neither are, nor can be, nor have been. . . . For how can a reed actually sustain a roof, or a candelabrum the orna- ments of a gable? ... pictures cannot be approved which do not resemble reality.42 Vitruvius's strictures should be understood in the context of the parallel orders of nature and architecture, which is a leitmotif of his De Architectura. As Ernst Gombrich pointed out, Giorgio Vasari interpreted this same passage in a sim- ilar way when condemning the monstrosities of Gothic architecture in the general introduction to the Vite, specif- ically noting that "the portals are ornamented with slender columns . . . which cannot have the strength to bear a weight, however light it may be."43 Imagery as vivid as that employed by Vitruvius can also be found in the opening lines of one of the most celebrated literary compositions of antiquity, Horace's Ars Poetica, in which the limits of paint- ing and poetry forbid the creation of monsters, "snakes paired with birds or lambs with tigers."44 Both the passages cited from Vitruvius and from Horace were of a kind famil- iar to Palladio from his years as prot6g6 of Giangiorgio Trissino and Daniele Barbaro. Palladio's earliest biography confirms that Trissino first expounded Vitruvius's treatise to the young stonemason, and Trissino's writings on archi- tecture and poetics are redolent of Horace and of Horace's source, the Poetics of Aristotle.45 Trissino also completed the last part of his essay on poetics around 1549, just at the end of his period of closest association with Palladio; as Bernard Weinberg has observed, the essay was almost a translation of the Poetics, particularly with its stress upon the organic development of poems and upon the concept of decorum or appropriateness.46 By the same token, Barbaro's literary dialogue, Della Eloquenza, explored the subject of imitation and the com- mon rules governing art and nature in a manner consonant with Palladio's opinions as found in the Quattro libri. Bar- baro's dialogue presents an Aristotelian theory of the oper- ation of the mind and passions in the context of rhetoric, stressing imitation and the rapport between nature and art in terms of a dialogue. Della Eloquenza was published in 1557, the year after the translation of Vitruvius to which Palladio contributed, and it seems likely that Palladio would have imbibed concepts of art imitating the laws of nature from his collaboration with Barbaro.47 More generally 304 JSAH / 59:3, SEPTEMBER 2000</page><page sequence="10">speaking, the organic nature of art and the dangers of trans- gression were general themes in classical literary theory from Aristotle to Quintilian and would have reinforced the lessons Palladio learned from Vitruvius. If the rapport between nature and art was, first and foremost, a classical precept, it was also a potent touchstone for Palladio, occupying a major place in his theory of good architecture.48 He not only compared columns to trees in Book One, but also claimed that the toruses and scotias of the columnar base reflected the weight borne by its shaft. In Book Two, he likened houses to bodies in which the most attractive features were on display and the more ignoble ones were hidden from view; when discussing stone bridges in Book Three, Palladio counselled that they should have an even number of supports because one never finds animals with an odd number of legs.49 The importance of nature for Palladio, as for most Renaissance architects, lay in its veri- fication of principles of stress and structure. Theoretical explanations of why arches and buildings stood up did not become a serious branch of study until the eighteenth cen- tury; hence, nature offered the only certain corroboration for questions on statics.50 In this context, Palladio's analogy between columns and trees repays careful consideration. It was probably indebted to two passages in the De Architectura, namely, the account of the Doric order in Book IV and Vitruvius's rec- ommendations concerning superimposed orders on the forum in Book V. With the second passage, Vitruvius made an explicit comparison between a column and a tapering tree, which is thicker at the roots: "Not less one ought also to imitate the natural growth of trees, as in tapering trees . . . of which every one is thicker at the roots. Then diminishing it rises on high, by a natural contraction grow- ing evenly to the summit."51 Daniele Barbaro also employed the comparison between columns and trees in his commentary on Vitruvius, but it occurred in his obser- vations upon the foundations of temples-not in connec- tion with the orders as such.52 Both Vitruvius and Barbaro drew different analogies between nature and architecture, focusing upon the human body, whether in discussions of symmetry or of columns; yet that comparison played little part in Palladio's writings, which adopted a more tangible, arboreal imagery. The difference emerges most clearly in Barbaro's commentary on Vitruvius where the stress falls upon the paramount role of design in architecture and the function of the architect as governor rather than fabricant. Barbaro's comparisons tend toward abstraction, as when he compares types of buildings with genres of rhetoric, and even his gloss on Vitruvius's criticism of wall painting com- pares grotesques with the distorted images of dreams or with dialect as opposed to the more elevated forms of poetry and oratory.53 Two final examples shed more light on the significance of the tree analogy in Palladio's writings: one is his report on the Doge's Palace, the second, his correspondence on San Petronio in Bologna. The Doge's Palace was damaged by fires in 1574 and 1577; the first caused localized damage in some of the ceremonial rooms on the first piano nobile, but the second one swept through much of the southern and western wings of the palace, devastating the oldest parts of the building. Palladio's brief was to report on the stability of the old building, a task he accomplished with several other architects and engineers.54The group was charged with find- ing some means of saving the palace, but Palladio charac- teristically went beyond this and argued for something more: a new building. A drawing at Chatsworth has been plausibly identified by Burns as Palladio's project for a new palace, and the sheet does correspond to the observations in his written report (Figure 16).55 The report begins with a lukewarm account of the old palace, and it is evident that Palladio lacked sympathy for the Late Gothic structure. He notes that the walls sustained heavy damage in the second fire and draws attention to an anomaly in the building's structure, namely, that the ground and first floors of the palace are composed of arcades, but the diameter of the columns on the first floor was less than those of the ground floor and also less than the thickness of the walls above. This meant that the building lacked a stable foundation; it "rests on air" as Palladio phrases it. Palladio proves his point by reference to nature where organisms with a fixed base, like plants and trees, become slenderer as they grow taller; neither, he asserts, does one find any natural organism with larger mem- bers (Palladio is thinking of branches here) above smaller ones. Interestingly, Palladio introduces the example of the human body but only as a means of forestalling a critique of his argument: the human body, Palladio reasons, is broader at the top than at the bottom because man is not stable like a plant but mobile; hence nature makes him lighter on his feet to facilitate movement from one place to another.S6 The echoes of Vitruvius are obvious, and Palladio clinches his argument by reference to ancient architecture, to the pyra- mids of Egypt and to the Colosseum and Pantheon in Rome where the floors and orders taper as they rise. The Chatsworth drawing does indeed resemble the Colosseum in having arches and engaged columns surmounted by pilasters on the top floor, and it could be seen as a logical extension of the theory of architecture outlined in the report. The facade of San Petronio also occupied Palladio dur- ing the 1570s, without any resolution. The Late Gothic civic church of Bologna already had the beginnings of a NATURE AND THE ANTIQUE 305</page><page sequence="11"> i ? ... i~iii~ii. ..........' ei ::ii;! ! i:l Iii i ..... .-:,: ::iiii_ P'V:'7 Long!,ii Figure 16 Ascribed to Palladio, elevation for a new Doge's Palace in Venice, c. 1577, pen and ink over incised lines. Chatsworth Collection fagade dating from the early fifteenth century, with some additional work from the early sixteenth. By the latter date, however, the great age of Gothic architecture was over, and the problem for potential architects and for the fabbrica of San Petronio lay in reconciling what already existed with a newer, more classical style.57 A number of architects made proposals that either aimed for a Gothic pastiche, as in the case of Peruzzi, or attempted a compromise between Gothic and classical, as with Giulio Romano or Vignola.58 Palladio's views were sought in 1572, when all the drawings were laid before him in Venice. Palladio's opening argument was unusual since he cautioned against completing the fagade in the Gothic manner; such a style was costly for the patron, he maintained, presumably through its detailed, carved ornamentation, and it would be cheaper to disman- tle what had been begun, reusing the same stones in a more "correct" classical mode.59 These remarks echo Palladio's caveat about the expense of the Gothic style in Book One of the Quattro libri, and although his more radical recommen- dations were toned down after a visit to Bologna to inspect the church, the compromise design, produced by Palladio with the local architect Francesco Terribilia, effectively reduced the Gothic lower portion of the fagade to a base- ment for the upper floors, which were conceived as a Renaissance church fagade (Figure 17). Obelisks supplanted crocketting, gables turned into pediments, and the central Gothic window became a Serlian one.60 This was wholly different from the previous solutions of Peruzzi, who cre- ated a Gothic pastiche, or Vignola, who tried to integrate the Gothic and classical styles. Not surprisingly, Palladio's subsequent proposals ignored the existing fagade in favor of something corresponding to his own style of church archi- tecture.61 Palladio took unkindly to criticism of his designs, especially those leveled at the early one combining Gothic and classical styles. In a letter to Bologna in 1578, he defended the Corinthian and Composite orders above the Gothic substructure by drawing a comparison with those classical buildings in which the orders surmounted a rusti- cated basement. Here, too, he referred to the example of trees: "The more polished and lighter would rest upon the more solid and weighty, imitating in this maner nature, mother and mistress of all good things, who has adorned the tops of trees with flowers and leaves and their roots with harsh bark."62 Thus, Palladio saw the Gothic as a rough, bark-like base upon which the more elegant classical forms of contemporary architecture could flower. In evolutionary terms, Palladio was placing the Gothic on a lower rung than the classical; it was an ingenious if fantastic distortion of the evidence, one aimed at deflecting criticism from his implau- sible compromise. When viewed in the context of Palladio's other writings, it adds to his thoughts on the classical style and its place in the natural hierarchy. Both San Petronio and the Doge's Palace show an evo- lution in Palladio's working procedure, away from practical considerations toward an ideal restatement of a project reflecting his own style. They also shed much light on his attitude toward architecture in the latter part of his life. The signs that could be read in nature, particularly trees, 306 JSAH / 59:3, SEPTEMBER 2000</page><page sequence="12">I RE~ All:: g, P ;---------- Figure 17 Francesco Terribilia and Palladio, Fagade Project, "D-D," for San Petronio, 1572, pen and ink. Museo dell'Opera di San Petronio, Bologna acquired something of a talismanic value for Palladio because they illustrated good practice in construction; they had been imitated by the ancients, whose architecture thus served as a touchstone for good art. Ultimately, Palladio's validation for good architecture, both his own and that of antiquity, rested upon nature as example and model for art. This was the foundation of the concept of mimesis, and it reinforced his belief in a set of common rules governing nature and art. It was, as well, a persistent theme in Vitru- vius's writings, where nature is synonymous with the uni- verse as cosmos, an ordered whole.63 Palladio drew together these ideas but gave them a distinctive interpretation in his writings and his architectural practice. Ironically, his quest for the laws of architecture led him to rewrite the evidence of antiquity as well as that of his own buildings: classical architecture served as the origin as well as the ultimate jus- tification for Palladio's own creations. Often this led to ten- sions and contradictions between the evidence of antiquity and Palladio's interpretations, between what he built and what he wanted to build, and it was this tension that cre- ated an architectural style that still beguiles us, not because it was rediscovered in the ruins of Rome so much as re- created in the mind of the architect.

The drawings in question are in the Museo Civico, Vicenza (D 10v, 13r, 15r). A similar case can be seen in another early drawing of three antique bases in Vicenza (D24r), to which Palladio later returned, adding further measurements and a freehand sketch of a capital in lead; see Lionello Puppi, Palladio: Corpus dei disegni al Museo Civico di Vicenza (Milan, 1989), 104-106 and 109, nos. 19, 23, 27, and 40, with further references.

It seems very probable that Palladio had access to Peruzzi's architectural drawings, which seem to have remained in Rome until their purchase for the Uffizi in the late eighteenth century. They were certainly copied by Gio- vanni Battista Montano and also consulted by Bernini and Borromini.

Sangallo's marginal notes establish that his drawing is of the second terrace and not the first, of which Palladio also made an elevation (RIBA X 13v). They are illustrated and discussed by Gunter Schweikhart, Le antichitl di Verona di Giovanni Caroto (Verona, 1977), 28-29; also Lanfranco Franzoni in his entries for the catalog Palladio e Verona, ed.

See Burns, "I disegni," 145; and also Schweikhart, Giovanni Caroto, 29. Franzoni, in Marini, ed., Palladio e Verona, 61, no. III/37, noted that a brick bearing the date 1536 was found in the niche of the first terrace of the the- ater and connected this with the archaeological interest in the theater in the circle of the Veronese scholar Torello Saraina and the artists Giovanni Carotto and Falconetto. This may explain the ultimate source of Palladio's drawings of the terrace as well as their detailed measurements. 18. The actual state of the lower terrace is illustrated by Luigi Beschi, "Verona romana: i monumenti," in Verona e ii suo territorio (Verona, 1960): I, 428-431 and fig. 18. 19.

Vitruvius goes out of his way to stress the sepa- 308 JSAH / 59:3, SEPTEMBER 2000</page><page sequence="14">rateness of plinth and base in this passage. For a review of the published versions of the Tuscan order in the sixteenth century, see Ackerman, "Tus- can / Rustic Order." 20. See Boucher, Andrea Palladio, 118-119. 21. Similar cylindrical bases can be found on the main entrance to the Scuola Grande di San Marco and on the arcade of Codussi's clock tower in Piazza San Marco, Venice. They are illustrated in Ralph Lieberman, Renais- sance Architecture in Venice (London, 1982), pls. 66, 74. 22. Beschi, "Verona romana," remarks that Palladio's drawings show the ter- race walls "con notevole esattezza," but presumably he was referring to the brickwork rather than the details of the Tuscan order. Ackerman "Tuscan / Rustic Order," 24-25, appears to endorse this conclusion and notes that Pal- ladio's are the only Renaissance drawings after ancient buildings that show the Tuscan order with a circular plinth; yet it seems highly unlikely that the two elevations were done on site. Despite their detailed measurements, they are not a faithful record what was there. Indeed, the inconsistencies in the treatment of bases and plinths in both drawings suggest a high degree of invention at work, and Franzoni's conclusions seem more appropriate: "Se i disegni delle due passeggiate furono preordinati al fine di giungere ad una pubblicazione, sembrerebbe di scorgere in essi l'intenzione del Palladio di falsare l'antico per creare comunque una convalida alla proprie invenzioni architettoniche" (If the drawings of the two passageways were destined for the scope of a publication, one would seem to discern in them Palladio's intention to falsify the antique in order to create, all the same, a confirma- tion of his own architectural inventions); see Marini, ed., Palladio e Verona, 62. Franzoni also draws attention to the similarity between the solution imposed upon base and plinth of the first passage of the theater in Verona and Palladio's solution for the uppper order of the Basilica in Vicenza. In this context, Spielmann's linkage of Palladio's fanciful reconstructions at Verona with his highly elaborate ones of Palestrina is also telling: "Gewisse Parallelen zur Rekonstruktion Palestrinas sind bereits hier nicht zu verken- nen"; see Spielmann, Palladio und die Antike, 121, n. 224. 23.

The following summarizes the salient points in Giovanni Antolini, Il tempio di Minerva in Assisi confrontato colle tavole di Andrea Palladio architetto di Vicenza (Milan, 1803). In a dedicatory letter, Antolini explains the dis- crepancies by supposing that Palladio relied upon second-hand informa- tion about the temple and "...l'imperizia di qualcuno che gl'invi6 i rilievi e le misure, non han permesso a quel grand'uomo di pubblicarlo con fedelth." 31. Palladio probably visited Assisi when he went to Spoleto on his way to Rome in 1545; see Zorzi, I disegni delle antichit?i, 17-18, and also Magagnato and Marini, Andrea Palladio, 542 (see n. 1).

These were identified by Palladio as the Temples of Mars, Jupiter Stator, and Neptune, respectively; see the important study on the last of these by Hans-Christoph Dittscheid, "Antikenrekonstruktion als Medium der Architekturtheorie der Renaissance: Ein Neptun-Temple auf dem r6mis- chen Caesar-Forum," in Christoph Andreas, Maraike Biickling, and Roland Dorn, eds., Festschriftfir Hartmut Biermann (Weinheim, 1990), 109-119. 34. Palladio, Quattro libri, IV, xvii, 64-66; see also Spielmann, Palladio und die Antike, 42-43. Raphael had similarly reworked Bramante's Tempietto in the background of the tapestry cartoon of St. Paul Preaching in Athens; see John Shearman, Raphael's Cartoons in the Collection ofH.M. the Queen and the Tapestriesfor the Sistine Chapel (London, 1972), 126. Palladio also made the plan of the garden loggia of the Villa Madama symmetrical in RIBA X/18; see the discussion by Christoph Frommel in Raffaello architetto (Milan, 1984), 339, no. 2.16.14. 35.

"... che non sempre si deve servare le istesse regole, e simmetrie, per- che la natura del luogo richiede spesso altra ragione di misurare, e la neces- sit6 ci astringe a dare o levare di quelle che proposto avevamo. Per6 in quel caso, dice Vitruvio, si vede molto la sottigliezza, ed il giudizio dell'Ar- chitetto, il quale togliendo, o dando di piic alle misure, lo fa in modo, che l'occhio ha la parte sua, e regge la necessith con bella, e sottile ragione." See Daniele Barbaro, I dieci libri dell'architettura (Venice, 1556), 171. On Bar- baro's theory of architecture, see the recent study by Pierre Caye, Le Savoir de Palladio: Architecture, Mitaphysique et Politique dans la Venise du Cinque- cento (St.-Julien-du-Sault), 1995. 38. On these examples of Palladio's late style, see Boucher, Andrea Palladio, 265-276. 39. On this point, see the recent, detailed analysis by Branko Mitrovic, "Pal- ladio's Theory of the Classical Orders in the First Book of I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura," ArchitecturalHistory 42 (1999): 110-140; and, more gen- erally, Hubertus Giinther, "Palladio e gli ordini di colonne," in Andre Chas- tel and Renato Cevese, eds., Andrea Palladio: nuovi contributi (Milan, 1990), 182-197. NATURE AND THE ANTIQUE 309</page><page sequence="15">40. See, especially, Spielmann, Palladio und die Antike, 97-101. 41. "E benche il variare e le cose nuove a tutti debbano piacere, non si deve per6 far ci6 contra i precetti dell'arte, e contra quello che la ragione ci dimostra, onde si vede che anco gli antichi variarono, ne per6 si partirono mai da alcune regole universali e necessarie dell'arte, come si vedra ne' miei libri dell'antichith." See Palladio, Quattro libri, I, xx, 51-52. See also Spiel- mann, Palladio und die Antike, 97-99; and also the notes in Magagnato and Marini, Andrea Palladio, 430-431 (see n. 1). Roberto Pane, Andrea Palladio (Turin, 1961), 78-79, gives a particularly sensitive reading of these issues. 42. Vitruvius, DeArchitectura, VII, v, 3-4. See, also, the more general obser- vations on classical uses of nature as normative and universal by Andre Pel- licer, Natura: itude semantique et historique du mot latin (Paris, 1966), 178-180, 218-225, 247-252, and 444-445. 43. ".. . le porte ornate di colonne sottili ... le quali non possono aver forza a reggere il peso, di che leggerezza si sia." See Giorgio Vasari, Le vite de'piiz eccellenti pittori, scultori ed architettori, ed. G. Milanesi (Florence, 1906), I: 137-138; and Vasari on Technique. .. , trans. Louisa S. Maclehose, ed. Gerard Baldwin Brown (London, 1907), 83. On this passage and Renaissance atti- tudes toward the Gothic, see Erwin Panofsky, "The First Page of Giorgio Vasari's 'Libro' . . ," Meaning in the VisualArts (London, 1970), 206-265. See also Ernst H. Gombrich, "Norm and Form: The Stylistic Categories of Art History and their Origins in Renaissance Ideals," Norm and Form: Studies in the Art ofthe Renaissance (London, 1966), 83-86. Gombrich goes on to observe that Bellori's criticism of Borromini and Guarini, as well as Winckelmann's of the rococo, returned to the same passage in Vitruvius for moral authority. 44. Ars Poetica, vv. 9-13: "... 'pictoribus atque poetis / quidlibet audendi semper fuit aequa potestas.' / scimus, et hanc veniam petimusque damusque vicissim; / sed non ut placidis coeant inmitia, non ut / serpentes avibus gem- inentur, tigribus agni." See also the commentary by Karl Oskar Brink, Horace on Poetry: The 'Ars Poetica' (Cambridge, 1971), 85-93. 45. See Giangiorgio Zorzi, "Paolo Gualdo: Vita di Andrea Palladio," Saggi e memorie di storia dell'arte 2 (1959): 93-104. When Trissino sketched an architectural treatise, he began with an echo of the Ars Poetica: "La architet- tura e un artificio circa lo habitare de li homini, che prepara in esso utilith e dilettazioni." The conjunction of utility and delight is Horatian and may have derived from the "qui miscuit utile dulci, / lectorem delectando pariterque monendo" (Ars Poetica, 11. 344-345). Trissino's fragment is printed in Lionello Puppi, Scrittori vicentini d'architettura del secolo xvi (Vicenza, 1973), 82-83. 46. See Giangiorgio Trissino, "La quinta e la sesta divisione della poetica," in Bernard Weinberg, ed., Trattati di poetica e retorica del Cinquecento (Bari, 1970), II: 7-90 and 653-654. Weinberg notes that Trissino made use of recent editions of the Poetics, and his account of decorum is almost a trans- lation of Aristotle (ibid., 14-17). 47. Cf., for example, these remarks addressed by Art to Nature: "imitando la Natura, la quale ama sopra modo il variare et mutare le cose sue ... O quanto io leggo sopra il tuo libro, O Natura .. .non ti dissi da principio che noi eravamo unite, e che cib che appare di varieth e di somiglianza tra noi &amp; in un principio ricongiunto? Chiunque opera alcuna cosa da me drizzato usa una regola commune et universale, che a molte e diverse nature ser- vendo, quelle unisce e lega in uno artificio medesimo..." (imitating Nature, who loves above all to vary and change her creations... This I read in your book, O Nature... did I not tell you from the beginning that we were united and that what seems both diverse and like between us is reconciled in one principle? Whoever, guided by me, creates anything, applies a com- mon and universal rule which, applying to many and diverse natures, unites and binds them in one selfsame artifice ... ) See Daniele Barbaro, "Della eloquenza," in Trattati dipoetica e retorica del cinquecento, ed.

Mainstone, "Struc- tural Analysis, Structural Insights and Historical Interpretation," JSAH 56 no. 3 (1997): 316-340. 51. Vitruvius, Quattro libri, V, i, 3: "Non minus quod etiam nascentium oportet imitari naturam, ut in arboribus teretibus .. . e quibus nulla non crassior est ab radicibus, dein decrescendo proceditur in altitudinem natu- rali contractura peraequata nascens ad cacumen." The translation quoted here is by Granger in the Loeb Edition (I: 257). See also Vitruvius, De Architectura, IV, ii, 1-3. 52. Barbaro, Dieci libri, 83: "... Dimostraci adunque prima quello, che sotto le fabriche deve stare, &amp; vuole, che imitando la natura, che negli alberi fa le parti inferiori piu grosse, che le superiori, percioche meglio si sostentano i carichi .. ." [Vitruvius, III, iii = III, iv, in modern texts]. 53. The gist of this argument comes in Barbaro, Dieci libri, 26-28, but see, inter alia, 7, 9, 41, 63, and 187-188. For a recent discussion, see Caye, Savoir, 265-266 and 281-282 (see n. 37). 54. On Palladio and the Doge's Palace, see Giangiorgio Zorzi, Le operepub- bliche e i palazziprivati di Andrea Palladio (Venice, 1965), 137-167. The two versions of Palladio's report have also been published by Puppi, Palladio: Scritti, 151-159. 55. See Burns et al., Andrea Palladio, 158-160, no. 279. For an opposing argument, see Manfredo Tafuri, "I1 disegno di Chatsworth (per il palazzo Ducale di Venezia?) e un progetto perduto di Jacopo Sansovino," in Andre Chastel and Renato Cevese, eds., Andrea Palladio: nuovi contributi (Milan, 1990), 100-111. 56. "... e sebbene alcuni dicono che l'uomo ha pur le parti di sotto, che sono sotto le gambe piui sottili che il resto del corpo, si risponde ch'essendo fatto l'uomo non stabile come le piante, ma mobile, la natura lo fece piui agile in quelle parti che per il suo movimento aveano a condurlo facilmente da un luogo all'altro, il che nelle fabbriche che hanno da essere stabili non si ricerca."

Palladio's initial observations and his first report were published by Giangiorgio Zorzi, Le chiese e i ponti di Andrea Palladio (Venice, 1966), 105-107, nos. 1, 7. The report is also published by Puppi, Palladio: Scritti, 129-130. 60. Burns has recently compared the Palladio-Terribilia project with Mauro Codussi's intervention on the fagade of San Zaccaria in Venice although Palladio's written comments and the elevation in question do not suggest great concern with preserving the fifteenth-century fagade of San Petro- nio; see, however, Howard Burns, "Gli architetti rinascimentali e gli edifici preesistenti: il contesto dei progetti per la faccaiata della basilica di San Petronio," in Fanti and Lenzi, eds., Una basilica per una citts, 259-262. 61.
