Lao tzu, ^Tecmi. sixth century BC Times have changed, And we've often rewound the clock... But now, God knows, Anytnmg gOeS.Cole Porter, Anything Goes, 1934 So often has the death of painting been proclaimed that the very notion of its demise has become something of a cliche, an unfulfilled fallacy that re-emerges periodically with much sound and fury. Paul Delaroche, upon seeing a daguerreotype in 1839, famously pronounced that "from today painting is dead." In 1920, Kazimir Malevich wrote that "painting was done for long ago"; Ad Reinhardt claimed he was "just making the last paintings anyone could make"; Douglas Crimp, when discussing the work of Daniel Buren in 1981, wrote that "painting's terminal condition finally seemed impossible to ignore."1 Conversely, much has been said of a resurgence in painting in recent years. It should be noted, though, that Charles Saatchi's Triumph of painting series of exhibitions, for example, is essentially misplaced in its proclamation that painting has somehow survived a sustained attack: for painting to 'triumph', there must be something for it to overcome, something for it to battle against. Nonfigurative painting in particular has long been tied up with notions of the death of painting, largely due to its position in Clement Greenberg's formalist narrative of modernism, which saw abstract painting - specifically abstract expressionism and later colour-field abstraction - as the inevitable culmination in the development of art through history. While his theories exerted great influence in the 1950s, the Greenbergian grand narrative was later challenged with the emergence of Pop and conceptual art and as artistic media and processes proliferated and diversified throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Painting was thus viewed as losing its place at the pinnacle of art history and, for many, lost its relevance and purpose. But claims of the death of painting, or notions that it no longer has significance, are themselves rooted in Greenberg's theories. As Arthur C Danto notes in After the end of art, the very idea that painting had come to an end actually subscribes to a Greenbergian viewpoint, even as it rejects it: The power of Greenberg's vision is nowhere better testified to than through the radical critiques of painting itself which began to develop in the 1980s. Ironically, these critiques were more or less based on the Greenbergian account, though advanced by critics for whom Greenberg was anathema. They took it for granted that the production of pure painting was the goal of history, that it had been reached, and hence that there was nothing left for painting to do.2 Danto instead ascribes to the belief that we are now living in a post-historical or "post-narrative" world, in which the very question of the 'relevance' of painting is in itself irrelevant. So while painting may have lost its claims to greatness in the Greenbergian context of the grand narrative, this has also liberated abstraction from its historical burden. Instead, there is an 'anything goes' freedom for artists, who can pick and choose an approach to their practice and for whom painting has become simply one of many forms of expression. While it must be admitted that with this comes a potential void of significance, a fear that nothing has value if everything is possible, it also means that art has, in a sense, become democratised. 35</page><page sequence="3">36 This freedom is not particular to abstract painting, but is paradigmatic of contemporary art in general in a 'post historical' age. The practice of art becomes instead a question of individual impetus, a personal drive to create by whatever means necessary. As Danto notes: [Robert] Ryman's work takes on a very different meaning depending upon whether one sees it as the last stage of the modernist narrative, which after all had painting as its standard-bearer, or as one of the forms painting began to take in the post-narrative era when its peers were not paintings of other sorts, but performances, installations, photographs, earthworks, airports, videos, fibreworks, and conceptual structures of every stripe and order. There is, one might say, an immense menu of artistic choices, and an artist can choose as many of these as he or she cares to.3 It is in this context that Unique act at Dublin City Gallery the Hugh Lane could be considered. This group exhibition features five contemporary nonfigurative painters - Sean Scully, Frederic Matys Thursz, Carmengloria Morales, Sean Shanahan and Ruth Root. All but Thursz, who died in 1992, are living and working today. The initial motivation for the show is the gallery's centenary celebrations, for which a series of exhibitions are taking place throughout the year that look both backwards and forwards - reflecting upon the Gallery's collections and its past, while at the same time engaging with contemporary practice and current critical debates. Unique act, then, was inspired by one of the gallery's most significant acquisitions in recent years: Sean Scully's donation of eight major paintings. Considering Scully is one of the world's leading abstract painters, it seemed timely to host an exhibition that explored contemporary nonfigurative painting. Thursz, a generation older than Scully, could be seen as a bridging point between modernism and the other artists in this exhibition, and between American and European approaches. Morales, through the use of tondos and diptychs, engages with modernist abstraction while reinventing classical forms that are steeped in history. Shanahan and Root, meanwhile, are a generation younger and, coming from a post-conceptual background, take the dialogue with abstraction to a new level through their use of nontraditional materials such as MDF and aluminium and through their overt engagement with space. None of the artists are simply formalist in their approach; they absorb influences from the world of art, the world around them and their personal experiences. Interestingly too, they engage with and are inspired by both modernist abstraction and the 'grand masters' of art history: while Rothko looms large as an influence among these artists, for Scully there is also Cezanne and Caravaggio; for Thursz there is Rembrandt; for Morales there is Piero della Francesca and El Greco; for Shanahan there is Delacroix. Unique act does not argue for or against a particular form of art. It does not proclaim the survival or revival of modernist abstraction, nor does it lament its demise. Rather, according to curator and Hugh Lane director Barbara Dawson, it is an open-ended "celebration" of the individualised practices of five contemporary painters who have chosen to work in abstraction. Each has independently, and deliberately, decided to use limited means of expression, adopting a condensed vocabulary for their artistic explorations. Yet each practice is also highly distinctive, addressing different concerns and with divergent results, thus demonstrating that abstract painting continues to offer new avenues of discovery. None of these artists is part of a movement or affiliated with each other in any way. Indeed, this is a diverse, one could almost say 'arbitrary', choice of painters. But, in a sense, it is the very arbitrariness of the selection, and the curatorial openness this suggests, that is the crux of the exhibition. These are individual painters, working freely and independently in pursuit of their own, self-imposed 'unique' goals. What is evident from the practices of these five artists, then, is that painting is not in competition with other media; nor is there a conflict between the merits of figurative versus abstract painting. Rather, I would argue, working in abstraction is a deeply personal activity for them, but not in an autobiographical or egoistic sense. Free as they are from participating in a movement or in some grand narrative, their explorations in abstract painting are individual, personal and often detached from the mainstream. Yet while they have sometimes worked against the tide of fashion, their work is very much connected with their experiences and with contemporary life - it is part of, indeed a product of, today's world. As Scully has said: "Everything we do, no matter how universal, has its feet planted on its own time and its own place."4 The process is thus fundamental to their practice - the daily work, the continuous exploration, the journey towards an elusive end point. Engagement with the medium - with issues of colour, form, surface and support - and the drive to push abstraction down new avenues of expression are crucial aspects of this work. The title of the exhibition, Unique act, articulates the individuality of each artist, but also underscores the importance of the act of painting and everything surrounding it. Central to this is the work in the studio where, for example, Shanahan mixes his paints and Morales stretches her canvases.</page><page sequence="4">HBHHWiP Morales BBBBBBBBBBBBBBb\^BBBBBBbWB*w?^B Diptych S 00-8-1, 2000-03 BBBBBB9BBBBB9BBBBBBBMm^M^^m metallic and dry pigments, BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBaSB^^^m on canvas BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBbWBbBBHb!^ courtesy Arte ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^BBH Lane ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^rajtlSjj ^kj^Lw^Lw^Lw^Lw^-v^Lw^Lw^Lw^LwBmj^ Sean Scully ^BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB&amp; grey _______________________________________________BBBNn 2004 Ci^^^^^^^^^^^^Bi^l on canvas ^^^BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBamB^^ IN^^^^^^^^^^^B';' &gt; courtesy/ collection Dublin City F^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^__^"i/^ t? &lt; Gallery The Lane -ay^^^^^^^^^^^^^^BHtnt Si ^bbbbbbbbbbbWP</page><page sequence="5">38 David Carrier, in his accompanying catalogue essay, argues that abstract painting has replaced religious art as icons for a secular age - that the viewer can obtain a sense of meaning through contemplation of such 'unique' works. I would argue, rather, that it is the artists who have embarked upon an individual search for meaning and fulfilment through the practice of painting. This can of course be said of any artist working in any medium. These artists, though, have adopted abstraction as opposed to any other art form out of some personal, inner necessity - as the best way with which they believe they can express their concerns. I quote Scully again: "Often I long to return to figuration...But right now my need to paint everything rather than something or one thing makes it impossible."5 Frederic Matys Thursz was an artist whose life, as Lilly Wei notes in her catalogue essay, revolved around his studio. There, he worked steadfastly and with great single mindedness in his pursuit of pure painting. As fashions developed and changed throughout his forty-year career, Thursz continued on his own path, often in obscurity, until his death in 1992 at the age of 62. Born in Morocco in 1930, Thursz emigrated with his family to New York in 1941 at the age of eleven. He studied art in New York and, in the late 1950s, went to Paris on a Fulbright scholarship. Thus he was exposed to both abstract expressionism in New York, and to the post-war School of Paris and the 'art informeP movement. While he was influenced by the likes of Henri Michaux, ChaYm Soutine, Nicolas de Stael and Jean Fautrier, Rothko played a decisive role in his development - for Thursz, Rothko's canvases were "the essence of paint as meaning."6 Diverse influences such as the light in Chartres cathedral, Rembrandt's Jewish bride and Grunewald's Isenheim altarpiece also infused his work. And, in addition to such art-historical reference points, his personal history - in particular his experience as a Jew and the loss of family members in the Holocaust - frequently emerged as a theme. Thursz is often classed as a monochrome painter, although such a description is misleading. For while he is interested in colour, light and surface, his oeuvre is primarily an investigation of the physicality of paint and a romantic search for transcendence in art. Thursz painstakingly built up hundreds of layers of paint to create a translucent, enigmatic, sensual prism of colour. At once transparent and impenetrable, these works often took several years to complete. Indeed, some paintings - even those finished in the 1980s - are still not completely dry. Thus the process of creating the work is made physical in its manifestation. As Wei says: "Paint was his muse, both his subject and object, and the changes that occurred in the paintings were for the most part internal, precipitated by process, steady but not extravagant. His ongoing dialogue with paint was sufficient."7 For Irish-born Sean Scully (b 1945), the process is also of crucial importance. Taught in London but based mainly in New York since the mid-1970s, Scully is well aware of the fact that he, like Thursz, has spent his career working independently: "I find myself historically in the position of an individualist," he says.8 He too took inspiration from both European and American modernism: Mondrian and Matisse are touchstones, and Rothko again is a significant influence. Indeed, Scully sees himself as continuing the tradition of heroic, monumental abstraction. He, like Thursz, is a self-confessed romantic, and he too aims for the transcendental and the spiritual in his painting. But Scully's work is also grounded in reality - in felt experience, in emotion, in contemporary life, in a form of storytelling that expresses a universal shared experience. New York city life, the dynamics of relationships, and the visual expression of that which cannot otherwise be articulated - this is the subject of his art. Rather than submitting to formalism, Scully's works are teeming with associative, suggestive elements that provoke a deeply personal response. "I'm not making mere paintings. I want them to be more than that," he has said. "I want them to be humanistically expressive."9 The lack of geometric perfection in the lines, the building up of paint wet-on-wet, the seeping through of layers of colour - all this underscores the process of creating the works while also adding to their 'humanistically expressive' power. And although Scully has since the mid-1970s used a relatively limited formal vocabulary - that of vertical and horizontal stripes and blocks - within this he has continued to develop new means of expression. The stripes are, in a sense, like musical notes, from which endless compositions can be derived. For him also, structure, rhythm and relationships of colour and form are of great importance, and lead to endless variations on a theme. Scully's practice is an ever-evolving search for enlightenment, a deeply spiritual quest. This is particularly evident in his recent Wall of light series, which has been described by David Carrier as "visual Utopias." In these works, figure and ground, visual hierarchy and internal tensions are abandoned in favour of an 'all-overness' in which verticals and horizontals become equal, harmonious elements that express the inexpressible.10 These works underscore his belief that "to paint abstractly is to paint pure feeling and to try and set the spirit free in a totally direct way."11</page><page sequence="6">Matys Thursz ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^B ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^B on ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^| ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^B Estate ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^1 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^B Lane ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^B ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^B Ruth Ruth ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^B ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^B ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^B _^^^^^^^^^^^^^^B 150 x137 cm ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^B ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^B courtesy GALERIE ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^B ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^B Lane ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^H ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^H aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaal aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaB ^m^_mmMMMMMMMMMmm^^mm^^Wm m^^m^^^^m^^^^^^^^m^~~ ^^Baaaaaaaaaaaaai&amp;s'PMi*^^^*--?,. %, A^^EWMm\M^?MMm-Mm^:: : ':' : : &lt;.**-..' aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaVlK* *^ * ^ * &lt;= * aBBaaaaaaaaaaaaBK^-^ts^i'^^w^. ^a^aaaaaaaaaaaaiBB^pr^^ PafAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaffS^^'^^' aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaae|/;f?s ^ r., aBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBi%?i7# ?aaaaaaaaaaaaaaajHfrv TaaaaaaaaaaaV ^ * ^aaaaaaa_aaaaa&gt;&gt;'^:;:</page><page sequence="7">40 Carmengloria Morales (b 1942) has also been decidedly independent and single-minded in her practice. Her approach too can be seen in terms of a quest: she has said that her practice involves "a journey in search of what you do not know, though you know it is there."12 Originally from Chile, she moved to Milan in the 1950s and then to Rome in 1960. It was seeing a Rothko exhibition in 1963 that was to prove decisive in her development - both in assimilating and rejecting aspects of his work. "I liked the elemental structure of the painting, classical and centred. However... unconsciously I was looking for something else, for a less sublime reality, more frontal and earth bound."13 For Morales, the "structure of painting" is central.14 It is perhaps for this reason that she has adopted the diptych and tondo formats and, more recently, rectangular works curved at the top like altarpieces. These forms draw attention to the support itself, to the objectness of the painting. They also initiate a dialogue with the art of the past, but are here stripped of all content. In the diptychs, the left-hand canvas is painted; the one to the right is left blank. This has a decentring effect for the viewer, yet there is also a sense of balance in their juxtaposition: the painting is accompanied - and completed - by its absence. The process of painting thus comes to the fore, and the time and energy spent in the creation of the work is underlined. Its history is foregrounded, as Morales has said: "In one painting you can find 1,000 paintings."15 Giovanni Maria Accame argues in the catalogue that Morales' work encapsulates both action and thought, both gestural and conceptual approaches. Morales moved from monochromatism in her early work to a gestural, layered approach, for which she adopted a standardised brush size. Thus the physical process is evident in the application of the paint, with her movements revealed in the controlled, tight, overlapping brushstrokes, applied at right angles to each other. The size of the canvases themselves often relates to her bodily presence, corresponding as they do to the span of her arms. And, like Thursz, work in the studio is central to her practice. As Accame notes, she "is the kind of artist whose work is closely bound up with a way of being."16 For Irish-born Sean Shanahan (b 1960), who is based in Italy as well, painting is also "a way of living, it is not mere dialogue with the visible, but distils emotional experience."17 Shanahan's works defy conclusiveness, defy interpretation. They are the manifestation of an inarticulate, internal need: "I have a picture that I want to see, a wordless need that I want to visualise...! want to see what I feel, I want to make it present, manifest it."18 His works are a contained distillation of means, material, colour and form, the result of concentrated attention and deep consideration. But rather than being reductive, they are in fact expansive and suggestive. They are both geometric and intuitive, simple and complex, still and dynamic. Like Thursz, he often gives his works evocative titles; also echoing Thursz, he dislikes the designation of monochrome artist. But unlike Thursz, or indeed Scully, he does not aim to achieve transcendental art; rather, as Gavin Morrison argues in the catalogue, his works are always approaching, but never quite reaching, balance, finality, resolution. "There's nothing definitive or final about the finished painting. I'm not interested in making definitive paintings that are 'relevant'. I want my painting to be undogmatic and non-conclusive," Shanahan says.19 A strong tensional balance is established between the simplicity and banality of the means and the intensity of the paintings' experiential qualities. On a mundane, mass-produced support of MDF, he creates a single layer of intense colour. This smooth, precise, opaque surface has been applied using a rubber wiper, thus suppressing any overt expression of the 'hand' of the artist. The tensional balance is intensified further by bevelling the edges of the MDF so that the painting seems to float from the wall, and by leaving unpainted strips at the margins which disrupt the 'purity' of the painted surface by underscoring the workaday material of the support and highlighting the process of creation. Recently Shanahan has made works for specific architectural locations, which emphasise the paintings' relationship both with the space itself and with the other works in the space. Indeed, he has described his paintings as "fugue-like" - each work complements and relates to the others, as though part of a contrapuntal composition within space. New York-based Ruth Root's (b 1967) works also engage directly with the spaces in which they are displayed. For her, the gallery wall is in a sense part of her work. I came to a more 'really abstract' abstraction, by emptying my paintings out. Then sort of filling them back up. I think I started thinking about all the elements that make a painting a painting; negative and positive space, background and foreground relationships. I started to isolate the object in the foreground and then just took out the background, made the white gallery wall the space that would function as a background.20</page><page sequence="8">Root plays with traditional figure/ ground relationships to create works that contain no relief. While previous works featured anthropomorphic details such as eyes or cigarettes, these are absent in her more recent paintings. Rather than use canvas, she has chosen aluminium as a support for the enamel paint of her compositions; thus, like Shanahan, she rejects traditional materials, choosing instead a support that is mass-produced and wholly contemporary. She also eschews the traditional rectangular format of painting, creating irregularly shaped forms with curved edges that could almost be described as flat sculptures. Her works comprise geometric squares, rectangles and oblongs that abut each other to create dynamic internal interactions of colour, line and shape. Any potential severity in the geometric shapes and straight lines is set in counterpoint to the alternately soft and rich shades of colour. Like Scully's work of the 1980s, they evoke the dynamism of contemporary urban life, but at the same time they reference such artists as Mondrian, Ellsworth Kelly, Richard Tuttle, Blinky Palermo and Thomas Nozkowski. While playing with the legacy of hard-edged abstraction, her works also evoke nineteenth century cut-outs, contemporary signage, advertising and graphic design. Frederic Matys Thursz, Sean Scully, Carmengloria Morales, Sean Shanahan, and Ruth Root each work independently, rigorously and steadfastly in nonfigurative painting. An analysis of the practices of these five artists reveals certain points of contact and divergence in their approaches and concerns. But what emerges most forcefully from such a discussion is the fact that they all possess a unique form of expression. Each practice, defined in its own terms, achieves its own validation and legitimacy. The fact that they work in such different ways and produce such distinctive paintings reflects both the inclusive freedom of choice within contemporary art, and the continued vitality of abstract painting, where endless discoveries can be achieved through deliberately limited means - discoveries that are personal, individual, and freed from notions of historical progress. Times have changed. These artists act alone. They act, but they do not compete. Unique act runs at Dublin City Gallery the Hugh Lane from 12 March to 25 May.
