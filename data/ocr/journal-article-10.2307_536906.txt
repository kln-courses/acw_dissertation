<plain_text><page sequence="1">A FEW OBSERVATIONS ON THE WORT,D VIEW OF THE CLACKAMAS CHINOOK INDIANS BY MELVILLE JACOBS Y EARS ago my Clackamas Chinook informant, Victoria Howard, who died in 1930, dictated in the native language and then translated a short myth which at the time seemed to me dull, possessed of slight meaning, and bleakly ritualistic-a kind of abracadabra. Her own title for the myth was "Coyote Made Everything Good." The personal name for the Coyote of this myth differed from the names for the several Coyote actors of other myths. The inference is that the Coyote referred to here played no role in the other myths which I collected. The narrator asserted her inability to recall the entire myth. What she gave was therefore only a fragment of a story, the text of which will be published elsewhere. It is sufficient to proceed with the translation, followed by an analysis of certain portions of its content, which I wish to suggest is much more revealing than I supposed when I first noted it.' Brackets enclose additions which clarify meanings; the remainder is a close translation. They would say at about this time [March], now things in the ground are growing. Perhaps this present moon [month], or maybe the next one when it [the moon] will be standing [will be visible], the very first camas [flat like buttons] have come. It [this camas] said [to a fish person, maybe Salmon, which also appears at the same time of year], "Goodness! Were it not for me [the people would die]. I hold their breath [I keep the people alive then]. Long time ago your people died of starvation." He [Salmon person] said, "Indeed. What kind of looking person is talking?" They [the people] told him, "She is kind of flat and grey-white." "Oh. Poor fellow. Her name [is to be] camas. That is what they will be eating." Soon then another said, "It is [I am] visible now. Were it not for me [the people would die of starvation]. I keep their breath [I keep them alive during this season]. Long, long ago they might have starved to death." They [the people] said, "Who is speaking? What is that one's appearance like?" They [the people] said, "To be sure. Seems to be long-faced and flat." "Oh [Salmon said in pity]. Poor thing. But she is really speaking the truth. Her name is cat ear [a small long white camas]. They will dig her out, they will eat her [raw], and then they will also bake her in ashes" [after blooming]. "Oh indeed." Thereupon another [root] spoke. "She is [I am] visible [now]. Were it not for me, your people would have starved to death long ago." "Oh [said Salmon]. Who is speaking? What is that one's appearance like?" They [the people] replied to him [to Salmon], "Yes. Her head is kind of round." "Oh indeed [said Salmon]. Poor thing. Her name is camas [the staple type of camas]. Everyone will eat her. They will boil her [with hot rocks]; they will bake her; they will cook her on hot rocks [in an underground oven]." Shortly then another said, "Now I am visible. Were it not for me [the people would 1 This paper is a slightly altered version of one read at the annual Pacific Northwest Anthropo- logical Conference, held at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, May I954. 283</page><page sequence="2">Journal of American Folklore die of starvation]. I hold their breath [and save their lives]." "Oh [said Salmon]. Who is speaking?" "Yes [the people replied]. Her hair is kind of black. It is tied in a bunch on top. She is a widow." "Oh no! She is just saying that [untruthfully]. They will not eat her; she tastes bitter. When you put her in your mouth, she will make you vomit. She is medicine merely. Once in a while when a person has become ill, they will then mash her, they will drink her juice. Her name is... ." That is all [about her]. Soon then another one [a root] spoke. "It is visible now [I am visible]. Were it not for me [the people would be dying], I hold your people's breath [I save them from starva- tion]." "Oh [said Salmon]. What kind of person is speaking?" "[He is] someone who is sort of long." "Aha. Poor fellow. His name is wild carrot. He is speaking the truth." Soon again then another one said, "He has become [I am now] visible. Were it not for me [the people would die of hunger], I hold your people's breath [I keep them alive]." "Oh. What kind of appearance does the person have who is speaking?" "Yes. He has long legs." "Oh. Yes. Poor things. Their name is wild carrot. They will eat them. They will boil them. They will make boiled mash-cakes [with them]." Soon afterwards then he [another creature] said, "He is [I am] visible [about April]. Were it not for me [the people would die], I hold your people's breath [I keep them alive]." "Indeed. Who is the one who is speaking? What is his appearance?" They [the people] replied to him [to Salmon], "Yes. He looks sort of grey." "Oh. Poor thing. His name is grouse. They will eat him. They will make [grouse] soup [for] a sick person, he will drink it." Soon now then another one said, "He is [I am] to be seen [now]." "Oh. Who speaks? What is his appearance?" "Yes. The same as that [aforementioned one] again." "Oh. Poor thing. They will eat her, they will eat her eggs too. She is good for all sort of things. Her name is grouse." Soon again then one said, "He is [I am] visible. Were it not for me [the people would die]; I hold your people's breath [I keep the people alive]." "Aha. Who is speaking?" "Something is standing; it is standing on his head. It is a small person." "Oh yes. Poor fellow. His name is quail. They will eat him." Soon again now they were there. Someone said, "He is to be seen. Were it not for me, they would have starved to death long ago." "Indeed. Who is speaking? What does this one look like?" "Yes. It is small, [but] its head is big." "Oh indeed. He just says so [he claims his own worth, but he is wrong]. He will not be edible. His name is mudfish." "Very well." Soon then another one said, "He is to be seen. Were it not for me [the people would die]; I hold your people's breath. Long ago they starved to death [except for my aid]." "Who is speaking? What is his appearance?" "Yes. His mouth is small and sharp." "Oh indeed. Well then. Sometimes they will think that they might eat him, but others will not eat him. His name is chub." Soon then another spoke. "He is to be seen. Were it not for me [the people would die], I hold your people's breath [and save their lives]." "Oh then. What is his appear- ance?" "Yes. His mouth is rather sharp. He is good-looking." "Why yes indeed [rising then falling tone]. Poor fellow. She is edible. They will boil her soup for a sick person, he will drink it. Her name is trout." "Very well." Soon then another said, "It is visible. Were it not for us [the people would die]; we hold your people's breath." "Indeed. Who is speaking? What is his appearance?" "Yes. They are tall, sort of blackish persons." "Yes, yes. They will be edible. They will get them; they will roast them on spits beside the fire; they will smoke-dry them; that is what they will eat. Their name is eel." Soon then another said, "It is visible. Were it not for me [the people would die], I keep your people's breath." "Indeed. Who is speaking? What is his appearance?" "Yes. 284</page><page sequence="3">World View of the Clackamas Chinook Indians He is big [and] his body is light in color." "To be sure. Poor fellow. He is edible. They will boil him. And they will also smoke-dry him. That is what they will eat. His name is sturgeon." Soon then another one, he too said, "He is visible. Were it not for me, I hold their breath." "Indeed. Who speaks?" "Yes. He is a good person. Indeed. Poor fellow. He is edible. They will make all sorts of things with him." All sorts of things in the water like that, I do not know their names, I do not know what sorts of names [they had]. That is the way they all [all those edible and other water creatures] spoke. I think that I remember only that much of it now. My mother's mother would say Coyote did [named creatures] like that [not Salmon as indicated] to absolutely everything we eat here. On the other hand my mother-in-law would say, "I do not recall who made the things that were good to eat here." My mother's mother would say, "Coyote did like that to all these things here. He went past all the things that are berries. They [each type of berry] said to him, "I am going to pick [stab] you, Coyote!" [Whereupon] he would pull it [off its vine]. "Yes indeed, you are edible! Pretty soon now we [Indians] are coming [into this country]. First the wild strawberries [will ripen about the end of May]. Then also those blackberries, raspberries, small grey huckle- berries, mountain huckleberries, serviceberries, crab apples, chokecherries." All those things spoke to him like that, "I am going to stab you, Coyote!" That is the only way she [my mother's mother] told it [this myth] to me. I do not know whether she told me the [entire] myth, [and in any case] I do not remember it all. When all those berries ripened, then she would tell it to me at that time [saying], "Now Coyote went through [the land and] made all the things that are edible." While she [my mother-in-law] was telling the myth, now she would say, "They planned [made] all these things that are good, [so that] such things would be our foods. On the other hand these bad things that are inedible, these we do not eat." Each short episode, and there are over twenty in the narrative, treats of a food. The narrator said that at such and such a season a certain food grows and ripens, if it is a plant, or it comes up the river and becomes edible or obtainable if it is a fish. The food is anthropomorphic. It is a kind of person who speaks with utmost terse- ness. This food-person addresses both the assembled people and a male deity-like personage, Chinook Salmon in one version, Coyote in another; Mrs. Howard tele- scoped the two versions which she recalled. The deity-like figure, Salmon or Coyote, is right at hand, listening rather than looking. The food-being speaks out something as follows, if worded in more acceptable English style. Dear oh dear. It is during the present season that I appear each year. Were it not for me during this season, the people would be unable to keep their breath. That is, I am of decisive importance to the people right now. It is I who in coming days or weeks make it possible for the people to continue to breathe and therefore to live. Long ago before I came, the people used to die of starvation. Or, they nearly starved. The foregoing is the first stylized item in the recurrent literary form of each of the episodes of the myth. The second and following item within each episode is a succinct response by Salmon or Coyote, who has been listening. He asks in authoritative manner, Who speaks? That is, Who is this that claims such worth for himself? His reply is as if the wealthy headman of the village were asking his people regarding a visitor or newcomer, Who is this new arrival who claims high station? 285</page><page sequence="4">Journal of American Folklore The deity-like homologue of a village headman next asks, What is the physical appearance of this claimant? The third and succeeding item in each episode is a response by the assembled people of the village, a response to their leader's queries. For Salmon or Coyote does not himself yet see, or deports himself as if he has not seen, the food-person who has claimed value. The villagers now inform Salmon or Coyote regarding the overt appearance of the food claimant, but they cite only one or two physical charac- teristics of that individual. They say briefly and obliquely, She is round-headed- for Camas. Or, He is sort of long-for Wild Carrot. Or, His mouth is rather sharp, and he is handsome-for Trout. As in Pacific Northwest Coast sculpture, the literary artist has the people select for expression only one or two traits of each food-person, and omits all other traits. Salmon or Coyote at once responds, because he, like a village headman, immedi- ately comprehends what is right and good. He is the one to give utterance to the correct decision, unlike his villagers who can only report what they have seen or heard. But the leader on the one hand, and village members on the other, are inex- tricable one from another. A village headman or a deity-like figure of an active or otiose kind is unthinkable without his people. The fourth and last item in each episode is Salmon's or Coyote's quick announce- ment, I stress announcement not authoritative determination, of the future function and the name of the food claimant. We hear, pontifically enunciated, Yes indeed! Poor, poor person! He-or she-will be edible. The people will boil her with hot pebbles, bake her in an underground oven, and cook her on hot rocks. Her name shall be Camas. Or, for Trout: They will boil her to make soup for sick persons. Her name is to be Trout. The stylized utterances of deity-like person and food claimant, in each of the four successive items within each episode, are handled somewhat like sequences of minor variations on a single theme in a musical composition. From the varying manners in which the food-persons express themselves, are spoken to, and are discussed in this myth, as well as from a variety of other evidences in the Clackamas oral literature, I deduce that these Indians regarded their principal foods as persons of a special type. Their view was that these foods wish to attach symbiotically to and be of use and worth to human beings, almost exactly as spirit- powers wish to come to people in order to be accepted, possessed, and used worthily by them. I suggest that the main foods and the spirit-powers constitute conceptual extremes in a continuum of anthropomorphically envisaged spirit entities which need to relate to people and which are lonesome and unhappy when not related closely to people. The corollary of this formulation is that foods were not regarded as pitiable if and when they were cut up, boiled, mashed, roasted, or smoke-dried, to be used for and by people. All foods were warm, friendly allies and the major foods were a kind of kin to human beings. They saved people's lives, just as kin and spirit-powers saved lives. People, spirit-powers, kin, and many if not all foods were mutually inter- dependent and interconnected under certain conditions. These three categories of beings needed and wanted each other. They were sad indeed when they were unre- lated or unused, that is, when they were alone. Each food, as the myth says, holds the breath, that is, maintains the heart and life, of its people. Not every anthropomorphically conceived plant in this myth is a food. One is a 286</page><page sequence="5">World View of the Clackamas Chinook Indians bitter emetic. Sick persons drank its juice. But the point is that it was a highly regarded because much needed plant. Like the foods and spirit-powers, it saved lives. Therefore it too fitted in the category of animistic entities which related symbiotically with people. All such beings needed and wanted people, as people needed and wanted them. The emphasis upon each of the foods or food beings which are inventoried in this myth was such that Mrs. Howard's well-informed mother-in-law, whom she quoted, had actually lacked certainty concerning the identity of the deity-like personage, whether Salmon or Coyote, whose judgments and pronouncements constitute the principal portions of the expressive content which receives native verbalization. The anthropomorphized food beings who follow one another in the episodes of the myth include several kinds of Camas, a bitter emetic root, several Wild Car- rots, Bitterroot, Male Grouse, Female Grouse, Quail, Mudfish, Chub, Trout, Eel, Sturgeon, and various berries. Observe that roots, birds, and fish are included, not animals, I believe because other myths resolve problems of the advent, characteristics, and functions of animals that were significant in Clackamas life. If some of these deductions are correct, the problem arises as to why the Clackamas felt or thought both animistically about foods as anthropomorphic beings, and in terms of their own symbiotic relationship with those beings? In a way the Clackamas played safe in the matter of a degree of realistic response to the external world by locating each personified food in a precultural era, the Myth Age, before things became like the modern world. Presumably a rather hard day by day manipulation of reality, a response which is common human, got in the way of a frank placing of food anthro- pomorphizations in the contemporary period. No group of people lives all day long, least of all when they are procuring foods, in a dreamlike trance or communal psy- chotic disorientation. They do not dig up all the wild carrots and at once talk to them and relate to them as if such roots were persons. A few of the people might do so to a selected few of the carrots, or, a shaman or ritualist might behave in such a fashion during a special seasonal ceremony. But the ideological heritage functions with fewer questionings if its animistic projections are packaged and relegated, with literary stylization in the narratives of them, to an earlier epoch which leaves only some con- vincing and tangible evidences. We know well that animistic notions occur in our culture especially in infancy or early childhood, when things in a youngster's environment are responded to in much the manner in which he responds to his immediate guardians and suppliers of food. The tiny child reacts initially to important things as to important people, that is, as if they were people. He therefore tends to manipulate such things as he manipulates persons. He seeks attention, relationships, and strengths in things much as he finds them and wants them in human beings. Of course I wish to avoid any evolutionist or ethnocentric kind of implication that the Clackamas or any other non-European people had minds which can be equated, in terms of developmental level, with the mind of the child. Nevertheless, we may borrow analogies from our knowledge of processes that are operative in infancy, to see if they operate in another kind of prob- lem. Accordingly, I suggest that in Clackamas culture, the procuring of certain things which were important as well as tasteful and pleasurable, engendered responses of pleasure and security which are somehow comparable to the responses to the granting of relationships and favors by people, whether people as such or humanlike spirit- powers. Needed and wanted things continued to be responded to with a relationship 287</page><page sequence="6">Journal of American Folklore reaction of a sort that appears in early years of life and that is repeated and reinforced in later years. The anticipation, both anxious and pleasurable, that a food of a certain kind would be available during an approaching season, occurred many times each year. The multiplicity of such happy expectations was, of course, great in the non- agricultural groups of the Pacific Northwest-hence the extensive list of foods in this one fragment of a story. Each fresh food had its distinctive and often delicious flavor. Many of the foods that are listed in the myth followed an often long and uncertain winter over which hovered threats of famine. During such a season the various smoke- dried and other stored foods, which must have become progressively more monoto- nous and flat in taste, had kept the people alive. Now, one fresh thing after another appeared, voluntarily and happily on its part, and was eaten with avidity, delight, and gratitude by its human kin. The coming of each such food occasioned, I believe, emotional responses similar to those caused by visits of friends and relatives who also remained for only a short while and vanished for another year. Parallel emotional reactions characterized the annual coming of the spirit-powers, in the winter spirit-power dances. Like all their neighbors, the Clackamas were little if at all given to metaphysical theorization. But their strong responses to each valued food as it appeared, resembled their responses to wanted people and desired spirit-powers who also came seasonally. Brief and stylized as it is, this myth is therefore not an unimportant, theoryless, or stupid story. It expresses, because there is no other way of accounting for the people even telling it, an impressive intensity of feeling regarding relationships with food beings which were qualitatively like those which a person had to kindred and to spirit-powers with whom he was symbiotic. The role and function of Salmon or Coyote, in this myth, brings up a somewhat different kind of problem of the interpretation of expressive content within a myth. Again, in order to understand such content, deductions which are ventured must also be kept consistent with whatever we know regarding the culture and its oral litera- ture in general. Accordingly, I suggest that Salmon or Coyote amounts to an anthro- pomorphized representation of the cultural heritage itself, and that this representa- tion is integrated with a precultural symbolization of an idealized village headman- that is, a paternal figure. He represents and combines great spirit-power, wealth, beneficence, authority, and a modicum of safety for the residents of his village. It is neither necessary, nor will it ever be possible with the kind of ethnographic and myth evidence which we can hope to glean, to define with precision the relationships between any Chinookan village headman and the people of his town. But I think that there can be little reasonable doubt about the primarily village headmanlike role of interro- gation of visitors, decisions, and judgments for the sake of the community, that is played by Salmon or Coyote. It follows, then, that two distinguishable kinds of symbiotic relationships receive projective expression in the myth. The one has to do with the peculiarly intimate interconnections of foods, kindred, spirit-powers, and people. The other treats of the fatherlike authoritarian who heads the village, and his interconnection with his people. Indeed, foods, kin, and spirit-powers need people and vice versa. A headman, as well as Salmon or Coyote in the precultural era of myths, needs his village people too, and these people depend upon, identify with, and give willingly to their headman. I have tried to stress a few features of the Clackamas world view which are, I 288</page><page sequence="7">World View of the Clackamas Chinook Indians believe, covertly present in this myth. I am confident that they constitute concepts and relationships which were important in Clackamas culture and which alone put life and meaning for us into this seemingly bleak and aridly ritualistic narrative. Study of this myth suggests and reinforces one further inference about the Clackamas cosmology. Like many other evidences which anthropologists have as- sembled from the Clackamas and neighboring Indian groups, the myth suggests that all these Indians seem to have been more or less effectively blocked in a direction of achieving any kind of monotheism, whether pure or mixed, because of the manner of functioning of their network of symbiotic relationships and associated concepts which anthropological writers have long referred to under the caption of animism. Whatever the most pressing needs and fears of the Clackamas may have been, their security system appears to have been so well woven in the net of interconnecting and mutually interdependent beings which were all more or less humanlike, that some universal principle, power, force, or deity concept was at the very least difficult for them to comprehend. It, or he, could not easily be introduced or accorded feeling responses that would offer important additional increments of security. We also know that when Christian ideology was introduced among Indians of the Northwest States, it frequently took the initial form of mere supplementation of a few new spirit-power beings, not true deities. The added spirit-powers were for some time regarded as beings who had earlier related exclusively to the Whites and were only now brought into the country with the Whites. Before any Whites entered the Northwest States, the Clackamas and their neighbors seem to have been about as completely non- monotheistic, by any definition of the term monotheism, as a culture could be. The Clackamas oral literature offers manifold support to this deduction. University of Washington Seattle, Washington 289</page></plain_text>
