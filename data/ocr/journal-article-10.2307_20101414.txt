Printed in the Netherlands. 267 Questions of times: Conflicting time scales in historical perspective1 SYLVIE ANNE GOLDBERG EHESS, Paris, France/CRFJ, Jerusalem, Israel Abstract. The idea of "Jewish" time highlights many problems related to the conflict between Judaism and Christianity. This paper focuses on two points: the reckoning of the Jewish era and the interpretation of the notion of time in the Bible. Jewish time pulsates to a rhythm of temporal markers which also divide it into secular and religious time. This division, however, this dual register of temporality, also enables Jews to alternate a "Jewish" register with a "universal" one. Traditional Jewish sources indicate that the principle of determining the date by calculating from the creation of the world {anno mundi) appeared during the period of the Second Temple. The question of elapsed time, deduced from different readings of the Biblical text, launched Jews and Christians on parallel lines of time. The history of the genesis of the notion of time asserts that the circular representation of temporality, sometimes called indigenous to ancient societies, was replaced by a representation that was vertical, then linear. These stages served as a scale for measuring the progress and evolution of societies. The Christian notion was supposed to characterize European time as an "infinite line" along which events are placed, in contrast to Israelite time, identifiable through its contents, and in which time is "full" and concrete, with no room for (re)ordering or arranging its episodes. This article concerns what I call a "question of times" (une question de temps - indeed, times and not the singular time), a question in which time and, more specifically, competing ways of counting time are in conflict. As used here a "question of times" arises when, as a result of particular historical circumstances, a group of individuals is confronted with a conflict between their own time frame and that used by others. Such questions reflect attempts to resolve problems that affect the positioning of one group or the other in time and history. The arrival of the millennium did not set off any battle on the subject of the calendar: for most people today, it is clear that time is relative and that its various forms of reckoning, growing out of Hindu, Chinese, Muslim, Christian or Jewish traditions,2 can exist side by side within a "world" time that is itself a compromise between cosmic time and the age of the Earth, a compromise worth several millions or billions of years. The fact that we can now accept a multiplicity of social and religious times shows that the notion of time is no longer linked, as it once was, to concepts of theological uniqueness.3 Nevertheless, the disassociation of the notion of a</page><page sequence="2">268 SYLVIE ANNE GOLDBERG relative, infinite time from a religious and social perception of time, a time that furthermore is predetermined and divided into distinct epochs, can still create differences of outlook. Thus what may be called "Christian time" may be the predominant one in the world of today, yet this Christian time frame also rests on an urge to differentiate itself from Jewish time and has so been historically expressed over the centuries.4 I would like now to trace the birth of this historical differentiation and comment on some of its consequences. Any "question of times" be it a simple question of "when," involves an historical questioning of origins. For Jews and Christians, the question of origins traditionally revolves around conflicting Biblical interpretations. In this paper I will examine some historical effects of these interpretations, but I would also like to show that a questioning of time intertwines the past with the present. It is like an echo across the ages, with diverse objects and in distinct contexts. I will present two occurrences of this phenomenon, each with a different thrust. The first concerns the reckoning of the Jewish era, the second the interpretation of time in the Bible. Both these "questions of times" are also present in contemporary reflections on Jewish temporality, with historical precedents often used to resolve immediate issues. They also deal with three basic human forms of inquiry, namely, what it means to live in a specific epoch, how to situate oneself in time, and how to interpret time. As we shall see, answering these queries required the use of the notions of universal time, particular time and various combinations of the two, and eventually gave rise to the threefold time frame, which also forms the basis of a Jewish temporal register.5 Living in time Although the Hebrew Bible is the common heritage of the monotheistic reli gions, the question of its enduring validity is a highly subjective one. The New Covenant that marks this change of view appears simultaneously with the emergence of the Rabbinic period and the beginning of the diasporic history of the Jews. It was then that Judaism tempered whatever proselyt izing directions it had previously taken, substituting in its place a tendency to particularism, hoping thereby to endure over time. The modern discipline of Jewish Studies can illustrate how this works in reverse: it developed with the emergence of the Jews' political battle for emancipation at the price, if we are to believe Gershom Scholem, of a renunciation of many religious and cultural aspects: in the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries, it sacri ficed particularism to retain only the more "presentable" aspects of Jewish culture and religion.6 But the experience of time is one of the salient features of Jewish particularism throughout the centuries. Escaping in effect from the</page><page sequence="3">QUESTIONS OF TIMES 269 common time frame, Jews hold themselves outside the temporal order of the countries in which they live. But by doing so, they proclaim their singularity with regard to the conventions of history that govern the common system. Thus, as Jews integrate into the social world of non-Jews, how is it possible to interpret the notion of Jewish time and what may be done with Jewish temporality so as not to disavow it altogether? The phenomenon of double dating is a sign of the importance given to temporal positioning. Although in the distant past Jews had used multiple systems, referring simultaneously to the destruction of the Temple, the Seleucid era and Creation (all three taken as Jewish parameters of time),7 an ethical and theological problem was posed by the coexistence of the Jewish reckoning of time with the Christian reck oning based on the Incarnation. This coexistence, introduced in the historical chronicles of sixteenth century historians,8 spread in the West along with the emancipation of the Jews, starting with the Edict of Tolerance of Joseph II and the French Revolution.9 The use by Jews of a dual system of dating, which has become commonplace in the Jewish world today, appeals to modern notions that separate religion from civil laws, and marks the boundaries of public and private domain, religious denomination, and citizenship, while at the same time introducing a permanent interplay in the temporal experience. The experience of Jewish temporality can be seen in the reiterated reminder of time "markers," so much so, that Abraham Joshua Heschel could qualify Judaism as a veritable "Architecture of Time."10 Indeed, from the divisions of the day to those of the week, from the week to the month, from the month to the seasonal markers represented by the festivals, the Jewish year is firmly fixed to a rhythm of temporal markers.11 These signs also divide time as it is lived into secular time and religious time.12 These cyclical divisions are what form religious time as defined by Mircea Eliade: "Religious man experiences two kinds of time - profane and sacred. The one is an evanes cent duration, the other a 'succession of eternities', periodically recoverable during the festivals that made up the sacred calendar. The liturgical time of the calendar flows in a closed circle; Sacred time, appears under the paradoxical aspect of a circular time, reversible and recoverable, a sort of eternal mythical present that is periodically reintegrated by means of rites."13 This religious time, as also perceived by Heschel, is by definition unhistorical. To grasp fully the relationship of Jews to temporality, the most contem porary history of Jewish time can also be called upon to bear witness. The recent reunion of the Jews with the Land of Israel puts an end partially to what could be considered an incongruity: the perpetuation of a people without a state. However, it also accentuates the ambiguities and paradoxes that surround the evolution of conceptions of temporality in the modern history of the Jews. For while it re-enters the common framework of Western history</page><page sequence="4">270 SYLVIE ANNE GOLDBERG (which defines a nation through the three criteria of community - territory, language and history), Jewish history can also resume a linear course, which had been interrupted, if not cut off completely, during the two thousands years of the Diaspora. But the possibility to live according to a double register of temporality is now called into question by this reunion: the coexistence with a foreign time frame that had been made possible by cohabitation (at the price of integration) is more difficult to accommodate in the new context of political independence. Indeed it is easier to accept that different temporal registers can exist when they serve to distinguish between different groups, inhabiting the same space and united by geographic and historical contingencies, than to accept that these different registers can exist together within a single inde pendent people. The process of secularization that enabled Judaism to enter the university and to become an object of science, while remaining a living faith, is exemplified in the State of Israel today. Reading the books of the Bible traces out a geography that some proclaim and others ignore: some espouse it in the name of religious heritage, others ignore it in the name of historical reality. In both cases, Biblical interpretation is summoned to the tribunal of present time.14 Those who proclaim their messianic right to the land do it heads covered and Bible in hand; those who are willing to renounce these claims are often those who demand the right to civil marriage, the opening of shops on Saturday, in other words, the right to live in a temporal register not based on Jewish religious principles. The situation seems deadlocked, with two Jewish temporalities fighting each other, one eschatological, appealing to theological unity, the other, let us say, universal, appealing to a multiplicity of socio-cultural registers. This example, though taken from today's Jewish life, can be compared to the circumstances of the conflict of temporalities that led to the invention of the principle of the "world era" in Antiquity, and also illustrates the kind of arguments that were used in the controversies of the twentieth century. To situate oneself in time: Let us begin with the seemingly obvious questions: What day is today? And what is the year? The first question can have, among many others, three answers: today is the third day of the week of the Sabbath Be-Huqqotai, the 23rd of Iyyar and the 33rd day of the 'omen today is Tuesday, May 30th; and today is both of the above. The answer given reflects a combination whose harmony or dissonance indicates the commensurability between Jewish time and universal time. The second question elicits a far broader reflection, for between the years 5760 and 2000 there is a relationship with history that is much deeper than the difference between the third and the second day of the week, or whether it is set in a lunar or a solar month.</page><page sequence="5">QUESTIONS OF TIMES 271 If we accept that determining the era corresponds to situating it on the axis of time, then we must admit that the axis has a starting point.15 Geometry holds that a straight line can be of infinite length - as it is in secular or astronomic time. However, the Western world in which we live has traced an axis that is moving toward an end, envisioned either as the end of time or the Redemption. That an end to time must come - on this point Jews and Christians find themselves in agreement; what divides them is when it begins: what is the starting point from which time must be counted? For Jews the present year is 5760 and for Christians (and more or less for the world at large ever since it was propagated by the West) it is 2000. How did Jews arrive at their figure of 5000-plus years? Any linear reading of the books of the Bible shows that temporal landmarks are provided in the Pentateuch by the lifespan of various people: in the books of Kings and Prophets, by reigns of the kings of Judah and Israel, while in the books of the Diaspora (except for Ezekiel, which is situated in a time frame beginning with the deportation of Joachin), the alignment is with the reigns of the kings of Babylon and Persia.16 Traditional Jewish sources say the principle of determining the date by calculating from the creation of the world appeared already during the period of the Second Temple. It was born both from a wish to position the antiquity of the Jewish people in time and history and from eschatological expectations: whereas Jewish chronographers, on the one hand, tried to resolve the question of elapsed time until their present, the apocalyptics and pseudepigraphers, on the other, tried to pierce together the mystery of the end of time. Both types of texts take as their point of departure the information contained in the Bible. But whereas the chronographers deduce historic duration, the apoca lyptics and pseudepigraphers, for their part, draw out schemes and systems of a theological-mystical nature. A combination of the principles of duration with those of mysticism is found in the vision of time transmitted by Jewish tradition. Its precursor was the Seder Olam, a chronological account that the Talmud attributes to the Tanna Yose ben Halafta, who lived in the second century;17 and the principle is summed up in the Mekhilta de-rabbi Ishmael:1^ starting from the antediluvian genealogies given in Genesis19 and the ages cited for the patriarchs up to the descent of Joseph into Egypt, "Jewish" time is calculated on the basis of scansions between the exodus from Egypt and the construction of Solomon's Temple;20 then between the dates of the Temple's construction and destruction. These scansions are used again with the construction and destruction of the Second Temple. The era dated from the "creation of the world" emerged later from the conjunction of these durations and these principles.</page><page sequence="6">272 SYLVIE ANNE GOLDBERG This kind of temporal reckoning made sense in a Roman Palestine, which had been greatly shaken by the succession of military conquests, the multi plication of political rivalries and religious conflicts, and finally by the emergence of Christianity. As a quest to achieve a national construction of time, it grows out from the seek to put an end to the diversity of tendencies to particularize themselves within history. One can see this reckoning emerge in a corpus of texts that stretches present time between two temporal axes that mark the past and trace the future.21 The first axis constitutes a chain of chronological continuity that is found more generally in the context of the development of Hellenistic culture. Chronography makes historic persons and events correspond to absolute dates, and thus by dating national histories situates them within a vast chronological system.22 In this way it makes it possible to distinguish between mythic time and historic time, between epic and history.23 In this category can be included, in varying degrees, the writings of Demetrius, Eupolemus, Philo, Justus of Tiberias, and Josephus.24 The second axis of temporality is formed by the eschatological texts that set themselves the task of predicting the end of time and inscribing the hope of messianic redemption in a numerical scheme:25 the idea of chronology is therefore based on a deployment situated between the beginning and end of time. To this category belong the non-canonical writings like the book of Jubilees, the Apocalypse of Abraham, the books of Enoch, the Testament of Levi, the Assumption of Moses, the Pseudo-Philo's Liber Antiquitatum Biblicarum,26 as well as the biblical Daniel.21 With the exception of the Book of Daniel, all of this corpus was collected and transmitted via the Fathers of the Church, in quest of an historical continuum. For Jews and Christians alike, the origin of time is built on the biblical account of creation.28 The end of days rests on the apocalyptic visions in the Book of Daniel: "Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days ..." "Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks ... "29 The reinterpretation of the visions and the explan ations of this text could thus form a basis for messianic speculations: they made it possible to situate the end of time along an extension made up of fixed periods. To grasp the hidden meaning of the text, it would suffice to pierce the mystery of the duration of the periods.30 The speculative scheme transmitted by the Book of Daniel crossed ages and cultures and served as a basis for messianic computations, Jewish as well as Christian. Daniel poses the question of the end of time according to a simple formulation: knowing that the final redemption must be accomplished in a time predetermined by God, how is it possible, using the same sources, for one party to show that</page><page sequence="7">QUESTIONS OF TIMES 273 it is imminent but not yet accomplished and for the other to prove that the Savior did come at the predicted time? The Yeshiva of Elijah says: the world is destined to last 6000 years. Two thousand years of chaos [tohu], two thousand years of Torah, two thousand years of the days of the Messiah. God finished his work in six days ... That means that in 6000 years God will bring all things to completion, because for him 'a day of the Lord is as 1000 years.' Therefore, in six days, that is, in 6000 years, the universe will be brought to its end [for] 'On the seventh day he rested' ... Many computations are based on these two quotations. The first is Jewish, cited many times in the Talmud,31 the commentaries and the midrashim. The second is part of the Christian heritage. The Epistle of Barnabas,32 written in the Second century of the Common Era, although fervently anti-Jewish, follows an apocalyptic structure deeply anchored in Jewish temporality and raises a "question of times."33 There was no problem predicting when the end would come if only we knew how much time had elapsed since the beginnings. From the account in Genesis 5 it is not difficult to add up the time passed from the dawn of creation until the flood.34 It is also not so difficult to calculate from the flood to the exodus from Egypt, since the ages of all the Patriarchs are given. Most of the problems concerning the reckoning of elapsed time arise from the contradictions found in the Bible about the length of the events described.35 From this point, that is, the Exodus, the reckoning of the elapsed time begins to be a subject of serious debate in Jewish circles, as we can see from the traditional discussions related to the reading of the Passover Haggadah, when is discussed the period of slavery from the birth of Isaac on or from the seventieth year of Abraham's life.36 On the other hand, the first Christians, the Church Fathers, tried to build a chronology relying on the Greek translations of the Bible, claiming that six of the seven millenaries announced in the Apocalypse of John and based on the verse in Psalm 90 had really elapsed between the Creation and the birth of Christ. The reckoning of elapsed time starting with the creation of the world became an arena of confrontation between Jews and Samaritans, as well as between Samaritans and Christians, each of whom believed they held the authentic truth based on their interpretation of the Bible. At the begin ning of the eleventh century, the Arab scholar Al-Biruni, a contemporary of Sherirah Gaon and Ha? Gaon, writes that the Jews evaluated the period elapsed between Adam's expulsion from Eden and the Flood as 1656 years; the Samaritans reduced this figure to 1307 years; while for the Christians it was 2242 years.37 Partially obtained through numerical variations found in the Septuagint - which systematically adds a hundred years to the lives of</page><page sequence="8">274 SYLVIE ANNE GOLDBERG the antediluvian generations - this temporal inflation can, of course be seen as a response to theological motivations, as Heinrich Graetz suggested.38 But it may have had a completely different origin out of which the divergences were crystallized. Confronting each other on the terrain of homiletic and hermeneutic history, the two religions fought one another, the one to acquire, the other to defend its status as the "chosen people." By extending the interval between the flood and Abraham to 1015 years, Julius Africanus was able, in his chronicles, to situate the death of Joseph in the year 3565 of the Adamic era, despite the masoretic number of 2309 years. Adding to this the 210 years that the Hebrews spent in Egypt, the 1235 years that are supposed to have elapsed between Moses and Cyrus, and the 490 years since Cyrus, according to the prophecy of Daniel, the birth of Jesus took place in the year 5500 after the creation, the exact midpoint of the messianic millennium.39 However, one must not forget that Flavius Josephus, in the first century, had already proudly proclaimed that the history of his people covered five thousand years.40 This would tend to show that the use of these inflated figures, which Jewish tradition would later reject, was not limited to only gentile circles, but that they are probably rooted in traditions existing since Antiquity - traces of which we find in the Jewish chronographers. The survival and theological utilization of fragments from ancient Jewish chron iclers in Christian sources can render them suspect as being tendentious interpolations or interpretations. As for the biblical sources used by Jewish authors, the few fragments of biblical chronography that have come down to us can be divided into two sorts: those in the Septuagint and those later found in the Masoretic text. The durations of the Septuagint are found continu ally in Demetrius,41 intermittently in Eupolemus,42 and not at all in the rabbinic chronology of Seder 'Olam.43 The variations found in the writings of Josephus can give rise to different hypotheses.44 Throughout his books, he oscillates between different figures, some of which are adjusted to those in the Septuagint, others to the masoretic text, while still others seem to be mere errors. It is probable that Josephus, in writing his various works, used numerical evaluations taken from different versions of the biblical text.45 They show that the divergences of biblical chronology in the first century must have been conveyed by versions following either the Alexandrian tradi tion or the Hebrew tradition. This oscillation between traditions is supported by the work of Eupolemus and also attested in Palestine, from a historic viewpoint, by archeological discoveries in caves dating from the Bar Kochba revolt as well as the discoveries at Qumran's vicinity.46 In short, the chrono logical activity expressed in the writings of this period could be the result of historic activity, identifiable with the Hellenistic world, as well as masoretic activity, which attempts to render the sacred sources fixed and uniform. The</page><page sequence="9">QUESTIONS OF TIMES 275 Greek translation, hailed in the Letter of Aristeas and glorified by Philo as a "splendid mission,"47 was later likened by the rabbis to idolatry of the "golden calf,"48 a judgment that succinctly sums up the transformation in Jewish atti tudes that took place between the third century BCE and the second century CE. The revised translations of the Greek text by Aquila,49 Symmacus and Theodotion,50 that attempted to adjust the Septuagint version to follow the Hebrew text as closely as possible,51 were intended to put an end to the circu lation of this mixed tradition52 based on different versions that preexisted the masoretic text and that was henceforth considered harmful by the rabbis. Thus, the question of elapsed time, deduced from different readings of the biblical text, was able to accomplish its historic destiny and set Jews and Christians along parallel lines of time. From the time of the Seder 'Olam, we can see in Jewish literature that landmarks are instituted by key moments in Jewish history: the exodus from Egypt, the building of the Temple, deport ation, reconstruction, destruction, the Seleucid era53 - Judaized by being identified with the end of prophecy - and creation.54 If the elements formed by the landmarks of biblical and Temple history are inserted in the numer ical scheme set forth by prophecy,55 the introduction of the Seleucid era and the era of creation attests to a singular chronological-historic thought which shows that a transition has taken place between the epochs of Judaism. This is clear in a writing of Saadia Gaon, who dates a work by saying that it "was written in the fourteenth year, 1200 years elapsed since the prophetic vision" although he was in fact referring to the Seleucid era.56 As rabbi and astronomer, Abraham Bar Hiyyah explained later: "the era of contracts is the closing of the prophecy, which ceased at the time of Haggai, Zachariah and Nehemiah, 40 years after the building of the Second Temple, and it is the beginning [of the period] of the men of the Great Assembly. According to our calculation, 3449 full years elapsed between the creation of the world and the end of prophecy, for those of the Orient who reckon the creation of the world from 3448, and between that date (the date of the exodus from Egypt) and the end of prophecy 1000 full years have elapsed."57 Once the Jews had worked out the amount of time elapsed since creation, it still took a few more centuries before the era of creation came into regular use in the Jewish world. This happened in a slow process over the period of the Middle Ages, perhaps in response to the choice made by the Church to situate its history in the era of the Incarnation and to the Muslim's determin ation of the Hegira.58 In this way, the question of when, emerging from the respective readings based themselves on the Scriptures sufficed to justify a schism. The present figure used for the Jewish era is thought to be a result of the computations of the Sages who, in the period after the destruction of the Temple, sought to establish a coherent chronology of the past in order</page><page sequence="10">276 SYLVIE ANNE GOLDBERG to evaluate the probable coming of the Messiah in the course of History.59 Having thus started out on the same temporal axis, responding to a universal eschatological quest, Jews and Christians would henceforth follow parallel, but never converging lines of time. A striking illustration of this evolution - and of its consequences - can be discovered in the realms of thought and intellectual life: Biblical Criti cism, was instituted as an academic discipline in the nineteenth century, in the same period of time when the Jews were struggling to obtain equal rights in the civil domain and were also seeking to gain recognition for the contribution Judaism had made to Western civilization. One of the expres sions of that struggle was the emergence of the Science of Judaism. The scientific study of Jewish texts which included an emphasis on the Hebrew Bible, was pursued by Jews in part as an attempt to show the universal scope of Jewish intellectual endeavors and perhaps also to further Jewish social integration.60 The scientific study of the Bible directed new attention to old Biblical notions. One area of this research stemming from Biblical Criticism, which not surprisingly was first elaborated by Christian scholars, was the Biblical notion of time. How to interpret time For over a century the work of Bible critics took it for granted that there was a profound difference between representations of time perceived by Indo European and Semitic peoples. This difference is founded on a demarcation stated in terms of either a geometric or an anthropomorphic metaphor: in the geometric metaphor, the distinction is one between the circular and the linear; in the anthropomorphic metaphor, it is one between the eye and the ear.61 Various scholars claimed that it was impossible for the Israelites to represent time otherwise than through the subjective perception of events, as opposed to the Greeks' ability to distinguish between "absolute time" and "space-time," and presumed that the Hebrews could not conceive abstract representations.62 The usual history of the genesis of the notion of time suggests that the circular representation of temporality proper to barbarians and archaic societies was,63 with the emergence of monotheism and later of Christianity, replaced by a representation that was vertical, then linear. These alleged stages in the notion of time served as a scale for measuring the progress and evolution of societies.64 The Christian notion was supposed to characterize European time as an "infinite line" along which events are placed, and this was contrasted with Israelite time, identifiable by its contents,65 which forms a time that is "full" and concrete and leaves no place for ordering or arranging its episodes.66</page><page sequence="11">QUESTIONS OF TIMES 277 It has become commonplace, ever since von Orelli, to compare the Hebrew and Greek Bibles as well as the New Testament, term for term with the lexicon of philosophical temporality. The analysis is based on a compar ison of vocabulary describing time: the biblical Hebrew mo 'ed, 'et, zeman and 'olam with the Greek chronos (interval, instant), aion (passage, gener ation), and kairos (rectitude of time).68 From this comparison come several common ideas on the notion of biblical time: the Hebrew conjugations do not distinguish past, present and future; the world is made of flesh, which implies a concrete vision of time; time took on meaning only at that point in history that God brought the Hebrews out of Egypt. For the Greeks, time is essentially cyclical,69 for the Hebrews, time is the equivalent of substance;70 the Greeks are dominated by a spatial vision, the Hebrews by a temporal vision.71 Thus, in their interpretation of the notion of time, the Christian Bible scholars echoed the theological clich?s about the superiority of the Christian over the Hebrew religion. But they also used the framework of evolutionist thinking that was then in vogue, establishing as a qualitative norm the ability of societies to think in abstract terms. The divergent opinions and contradictory visions of the philological and linguistic approaches lead to some very surprising results. For example, the time expressed in Ecclesiastes is understood by some as recurrent and without meaning; for others, it shows the importation of non-Hebrew thought.72 Opin ions also diverge on the proper geometric figures for time's representation: the circle is seen as defining Greek time for some and Biblical time for others; and one of these eminent specialists states that although cyclical time is indeed Greek, linear time is still not biblical, because it is a result of the (Greek?) introduction of chronological time into the understanding of biblical material.73 Some see the Greek vision as being at the same time linear and circular.74 In other words, no vision of time is really identifiable in the Bible,75 which grasps only "moments" and "decisive" times. All agree, however, in reaffirming the differences between Greek and Biblical visions and Von Rad states that, in contrast to the Bible, the western conception of time is more or less consciously linear.76 James Barr opens another path. Because Biblical language as we know it comes from a distant past, from a foreign idiom and a different culture (and this has been true ever since Jews started using other languages than Hebrew),77 we are faced with a real problem of translation and transculturation. But nothing proves that the gap between the time perceptions of Biblical Hebrews, ancient Greeks (non philosophers, that is) and the Western peoples of today is so great that we will never manage to understand or identify them. By his explanations, Barr exposes the biases and the incoherence of the theological approaches based on the methods of linguistics and Biblical philology.78</page><page sequence="12">278 SYLVIE ANNE GOLDBERG When Christian theologians attributed to the religion of Israel the paternity of the notion of temporal creation, thereby bestowing on it the merit of being the first historic religion,79 they did so primarily in order to demonstrate the immaturity of its monotheism. Surprisingly, while Bible criticism was debating the authenticity of the divine word in the Hebrew Bible by looking, as James Frazer put it in his time, at a succession of components clumsily placed end to end,80 few Jewish studies defended the traditional Jewish view, and accepted de facto the principle of a text revealed first and completed by corpus,81 within which the notion of temporality really made no sense, since the biblical text had been formed over the centuries by the multiplicity of cultural systems at work in it, just like the Hebrew people itself. In this sense, philological study in the service of a theological interpretation of a notion considered as philosophic or anthropological could be seen as a kind of rear-guard combat: for Christians it could justify (just at a time when the entry of Jews in the social world of Europe was challenging the established relationship between the religious groups) the creation of a pseudo-scientific safeguard intended to maintain the historic positioning of the one and the other in determined cultural and social spaces. The historic dimension of time would thus remain the contribution of Christianity, and it goes without saying therefore that the Jews, by remaining faithful to their religion, also remain outside of the Western frame of history and time. This position can be summed up by one sentence from Jacques Le Goff's seminal work on time: "The New Testament brings, or specifies, a new element in relation to Jewish thought; the appearance of Christ, the realization of the Promise, the Incarnation gave time a historic dimension, or rather, a center. Henceforth 'from the creation to Christ, all the history of the past, as it is related in the Hebrew Bible, becomes part of the history of Salvation'."82 For Jewish historians, Jewish attempts at socialization were accompanied by a consensus aiming to rethink the historic framework imposed by the emer gence of national histories. In order to integrate Jewish history into that of the countries in which they lived, they gave great importance, with the help of the Philosophy of History,83 to the notion of Geistesgeschichte, which made it possible to emphasize the universal aspects of Judaism.84 Rereading with a wary eye the period of transition between ancient and rabbinic Judaism, they supported the principle of a definitive rupture in the continuity of the history of the Jews. Accepting the idea that the Jews exited from conventional history when they lost their state after the destruction of the Temple, they focused on the messianic impetus in Jewish history. Revisiting the early centuries in this light, the Jewish people (a historic people if ever there was one, for the Hebrew Bible, evidence of its covenant with God, testifies to the work of the demiurge of History), during the transition to rabbinic Judaism, were held to</page><page sequence="13">QUESTIONS OF TIMES 279 have deliberately exited from history by voluntarily neutralizing messianic activism, which the rabbis would henceforth consider either as responsible for their earthly woes or, even worse, as utterly useless. In order to avoid any messianic policies that might endanger the survival of Judaism, the rabbis would follow the option proposed by Yohanan ben Zakkai:85 once divorced one from the other, history and events dissolve themselves in a fusion of ethics and eschatology, now detached from any historical contingency. Moreover, when the Talmud forbids the calculation of the time of the coming of the Messiah and speculation about the time left until the advent of the Messianic era,86 it does quite seem that history has lost its meaning. Is it because it is stripped of this ultimate interest that it seems so vain? In any case, historical activity is indeed presented by Maimonides, as scholars like to recall, as a "waste of time."87 From that point on, the scholars notice that the represent ation of time produced by rabbinic literature - midrash, aggadah or halakhah - is a static one. Containing neither past nor future,88 it is detached from the linear conception of time traced by the Bible and now mixes present and past,89 while temporality takes on a mythic quality in which everything is part of eternity. This is what Jacob Neusner means when he states: "the rabbis thus traded history for eternity."90 Thus, for very different reasons, scholars, Jews and non-Jews, historians, Bible scholars and specialists of Antiquity, proclaimed the same certainties, all supporting, with individual nuances, the idea that the Hellenist scholar Martin Hengel sums up with a postulate: "The Torah became an 'essentially unhistorical entity' " or, in another formulation, "The moment the Rabbinate achieved its final rule over Palestinian Judaism after Jabneh, the almost thou sand year old tradition of Israelite and Jewish History writing came to an end (...) Under the guidance of the Rabbis, the pious Jew found his satisfaction in preoccupation with what for him was the unfathomable Torah, unfathomable because it encompassed God's very wisdom itself."91 In this sense, the inter pretation of the notion of time from the Bible to the Talmud leads directly to the idea of interdependence between time and history. But whereas Philippe Aries could declare that "the idea of a close dependence between man and history is the true contribution of Christianity,"92 the singular relationship of Judaism to history and time that we see in the ancient texts remains an unsolvable problem for Jewish scholars. Thus Heinrich Graetz proclaimed that "Judaism is not a religion of the present but of the future".93 And when, in the same wake Jewish scholars invented a universalistic Judaism, stripped of all nationalism, possibly read in the light of the works of Philo of Alex andria, they hoped perhaps to rescue the future of the Jews of the historical withdrawal what had been instituted during the Talmudic period, as defined or stigmatized, among others, by Marcel Simon.94</page><page sequence="14">280 SYLVIE ANNE GOLDBERG To conclude, let us return to the threefold conception of time in Judaism. First, the will to define a specifically Jewish chronology appears to have grown out of a universal orientation, based on the common idea that the end of the world means the end of mankind. Subsequently, the attempt to identify the notion of Biblical time by studying the source texts turned into a theolo gical discussion. Biblical Criticism, in its attempt to affirm the supremacy of Christianity over Judaism, chiefly brought out, thanks to Julius Wellhausen95 emphasized the cultural contributions of the ancient world within Judaism and stressed the difficulty inherent in understanding the notion of time in a simple linear time frame.96 Yet, the two "questions of times" one could also say of "when" analyzed in this article are contemporary. One may say that the first of them emerged from an eschatological quest, a quarrel between heirs, and that the second showed that the controversy, even when displaced to another terrain, is still purely theological in nature. Nevertheless, one may suggest that these two "questions of times" have been indeed reactivated in the divisions that are splitting the temporality in contemporary State of Israel, caught as it is between theological and historical legitimacies, particular and universal time, eschatological expectation and the constraints of the modern world.

See the fine study of Etienne Nodet, Le Pentateuque de Flavius Josephe (Paris, 1996). Scholars agree on the fact that he uses the Septuagint figures for antediluvian generations, B. Z.
