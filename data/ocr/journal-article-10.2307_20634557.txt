<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS THE MAKING OF THE AUSTRALIAN CONSTITUTION The Making of the Australian Constitution, by J. A. La Nauze. (Melbourne University Press, 1972.) Pp. xi + 369, illustrated. Price $15.00. Words, not the deeds of history, have generally been the canons of judicial interpretation of the Australian Constitution. In 1936 the Privy Council, while determining a celebrated case on freedom of inter-State trade and commerce, James v. The Commonwealth, made clear the re strictions which lawyers impose upon history as a constitutional inter pretative aid. "The true test," said their Lordships, "must, as always, be the actual language used. Nor can any decisive help here be derived from evidence of extraneous facts existing at the date of the [Commonwealth Constitution] Act of 1900; such evidence may in some cases help to throw light on the intention of the framers of the statute, though that intention can in truth be ascertained only from the language used." That literalistic approach has tended to dissuade such constitutional historians as this country has possessed from delving deeply into the antecedents of our Constitution. Lawyers wishing to add a discreet flavour of history to forensic arguments on constitutional points have not needed to go far beyond The Annotated Constitution of the Australian Common wealth by Quick and Garran, published in 1901. Professor La Nauze has now produced what he describes as "a kind of supplement" to that monu mental work. It is not a lawyer's, nor a constitutionalist's supplement, but the contribution of a historian. It covers much of the ground traversed by Quick and Garran, yet differs materially. The history which they wrote was impersonal and, in humanity, almost sterile. Professor La Nauze writes the human story of the attainment of federation by the Australian colonies, and thus goes significantly further than do the "sober pages of Quick and Garran", as he calls them (p. 225). His access to previously confidential or restricted public and private papers has also enabled him to attain a wider perspective than was open to Quick and Garran. The book bears the customary hall-marks of its author's scholarship. 122</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEW His penetrating analyses of events, assessments of individuals, felicitous style, and wedding of clarity with compression (the text itself has less than 300 pages), all make for easy and informative assimilation. The reader, sheltered from the heat of the day under which the labour of research was carried out, might almost become forgetful of the amount of toil and preparation which the project has required. The range of the annotations serves as an effective reminder. There are seventeen chapters in the book, and eight appendices of contemporary documents. The chapters, in general terms, trace the con stitution from conception, which was perhaps as early as 1847, to birth in 1900. The significant stages of gestation were the 1890 Conference of colonial delegates in Melbourne, the 1891 National Australasian Con vention in Sydney, the 1897 Conventions in Adelaide and Sydney, and the concluding referenda campaigns in the colonies. The author early makes the point that federation was a measure of self help?"after 1850 it was certain that no scheme of federal government would ever be imposed by Britain upon the Australian colonies; if they Wanted one, they would have to work it out for themselves and the im perial Parliament would be concerned only to give it legal sanction" (p. 4). The working out was largely the contribution of individuals. One of the most notable was Henry Parkes, that master politician whose participation was so essential to the inaugural meetings that "a convention without Parkes was inconceivable" (p. 23). His role, however, was rather that of entrepreneur than of constitution-maker for, when it came to details, he had only "misty notions". The detailed work of devising a constitution, naturally enough, came from lawyers. Alfred Deakin, who had been a barrister, was able to absorb, digest and derive ideas from the three volumes of Bryce's cele brated American Commonwealth while attending to his duties as a Vic torian cabinet minister. Andrew Inglis Clark of Tasmania was to go beyond theorizing to produce a draft Constitution, an effort which would be seen by other lawyers as "mainly scissors-and-paste work . . . but skilfully arranged to give at least a convincing ground-plan for the kind of structure they were to build" (p. 26). The greatest role in framing the Constitution was to fall to Samuel Walker Griffith, one of Australia's legal giants, of whom a definitive biography is much needed. He revised Clark's ground-plan, turning it into a solid foundation on which others would build?among them Barton (whose reputation for indolence the author well refutes, at least as regards his part in the campaign for federation), Symon, O'Connor, Wise and, al though exposed to humiliation by being excluded from the Drafting Committee, Isaacs. Of Isaacs, Professor La Nauze discerns the "tinge of patronage in his voice when he noticed loose drafting . . . [He] would never find it easy to let pass words that could conceivably have large 123</page><page sequence="3">THE AUSTRALIAN QUARTERLY, MARCH, 1973 consequences in the future, and he was anxious to share his apprehensions with the Convention. Thus the most acute constitutional lawyer among them, and the best informed about American precedents, would gain the reputation of crying wolf too often. It was unfortunate, for some of his wolves were real enough" (p.151). One point, strikingly made, is a comparison between the quality of debate in the Conventions and in the colonial legislatures. The author demonstrates that "as to 'Hansard', anyone who has found it necessary to glance through the record of trivia, vulgarity and mediocrity which comprises more than a fair share of the contemporary parliamentary de bates will realize that by contrast the members of the Convention were conscious that among their audience was the muse of History" (p. 83-84). Some valuable analysis is made of portions of the debates but a complete study of them obviously could not have been made within the scope of this book. Professor La Nauze contents himself to join those constitutional lawyers and historians who have sunk shafts in that imperfectly worked field, and to commend further excavation to the student (p. 115). There is a sense of excitement in the following and re-living the vicissi tudes of the federal movement through such episodes as the 'Yes-No* equivocations of Reid, the fatherly minute-writing of the Colonial Office which "provided practice in writing prose; [and] some relief in an ex asperating job, for colonials could be very trying" (p. 173), and the final confrontation in London between Chamberlain and the Australian delegates over appeals to the Privy Council from the High Court. In a compressed work such as this, there is little room for pen portraits, but Professor La Nauze has sketched some excellent pen caricatures. Take, for example, the cases of Griffith, depicted as "courteous, patient but always authoritative, he dominates the proceedings in print as he did in the eyes of his audience" (p. 78); of Forrest, "a blunt, strong man, not versed in constitutional niceties and not yet deeply experienced in parliamentary politics" (p. 81); and of Higgins, "an obstinate individualist radical, by birth an Irishman, though not a Catholic; though always courteous he was not given to compromise if he was, in his judgement, in the right; and this usually was his judgement" (p. 102). It is good to have such sustained human interest as this study has, even though its evocation is sometimes forced. Thus it is diverting to be told once that "the Constitution emerged from the labours of an overwhelming majority of hairy men" (p. 12), but the second time, when recounted with details of their weights and heights (p. 30), it palls, and one is almost relieved to find that the same "meticulous anthropomorphic data" was not conveniently preserved in respect of the 1897 Convention delegates (p. 104). Of them the reader must be satisfied to know that they wore "bright bouquets in their button-holes" (p. 107) and were entertained by an Indian juggler (p. 109). More relevant is the occasional remembrance of the 124</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEW state of the weather and of the trying effect upon public debate, in those un-air-conditioned days, of heat and humidity, with a consequent shortening of speakers' tempers and distracting of listeners' concentration. Paradoxically, the end of this excellent volume has overtones of gloom. Although the author admits that "the conclusion of a study of the em bryonic development of the Constitution is no place for hasty comment on its post-natal life", he assesses its current state of health as "not well" (p. 287), and is even doubtful that it will survive another fifty years (p. 271). That must surely be too pessimistic. The Constitution certainly needs revision, and the Commonwealth and States are now committed to examining how, and in what ways, it should be revised. Their spokesmen, it may be hoped, will be guided to success by the same good qualities and high principles which were in evidence amongst the constitution-makers eighty years ago, and of which Professor La Nauze's book is such a salutary and timely reminder. ?J.
