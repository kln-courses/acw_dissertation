<plain_text><page sequence="1">PATRICK H. HUTTON The New Science of Giambattista Vico: Historicism in Its Relation to Poetics FOR THOSE who have been willing to fol- low him through the eccentricities of his ponderous, baroque style, Giambattista Vico has always been a revelation. Undenia- bly, his New Science is a seminal tract, suggestive for more than one field of intel- lectual endeavor, as the retiring Neapolitan scholar himself was well aware.1 Vico has been a genuine source of inspiration to scholars of a variety of philosophical per- suasions. Edmund Wilson recounts how the New Science completely captivated Miche- let, enabling him to reconceive his theory of social history.2 H. Stuart Hughes offers an appealing discussion of the activist implica- tions of Vice's theory of cognition for the Sorelian anarchist tradition, while Robert Clark has attempted to establish the indi- rect connections between Vico and the Ger- man Romantics.3 Nor has Vico's signifi- cance been lost upon Marxist scholars, who have generously found a place for him in their pantheon of early heroes.4 Yet it has been among the idealist historians that the debt to Vico has been most completely ac- knowledged. Benedetto Croce and R. G. Collingwood have loudly proclaimed how Vico anticipates the better part of nine- teenth-century historicism.5 Erich Auerbach PATRICK H. HUTTON is assistant professor of history at the University of Vermont. modestly comments that his methodology of "aesthetic historism" is but an elaboration of Vico's theory of art as imagination.6 Even Arnold Toynbee has acknowledged the degree to which Vico's theory of history approximates his own, if only at the prod- ding of his ever zealous critics.7 Indeed, one is left breathless before the array of intellec- tual movements with which his name has been ingeniously linked. One wonders if, like the idealized man that Vico uncovers for us, we are not making Vico the "meas- ure of all things." Historians, philosophers, and theologians alike pay homage at the shrine of Vichian wisdom. All too frequently, however, the intent of the scholars' eulogy has been to use Vico for their own purposes. Portrayed as a kind of Prometheus rekindling for modern man the poetic fires of his pri- mordial ancestors, Vico has perennially been cast in the role of precursor. Vico may well have been ahead of his time in many respects, yet surely we cannot excuse in Vico's case what he himself demanded of every ancient poet and sage: namely, that the expression of the creative individual is in some sense a genuine expression of the mental world view of the age in which he lives. It must be remembered that Vico was thoroughly a man of the eighteenth cen- tury. His literary idiom was that of the neo-</page><page sequence="2">360 classical rhetorician; his view of history was providential; his view of man Augustinian, Crocean and Marxist protestations notwith- standing.8 It is generally conceded that the New Sci- ence is nothing less than an attempt to ex- plain historical causation as a function of poetic creation. 'Curiously, little effort has been made critically to evaluate Vice's theory of poetry in terms of its own inner resources. Such an analysis, I would suggest, might enable us to arrive at a more bal- anced judgment of his contribution to our understanding of the relationship between artistic creation and historical change. Vice's place in the history of poetic theory has clearly been underestimated, yet not for the reasons customarily presented. As a theorist, Vico does not really strike out in new directions. Indeed, his theory of poetry exhibits all of the limitations of the neo- classical tradition in which he had been ed- ucated. What Vico offers is a perspective on continuity and change in the classical crit- cal tradition. What else would one really expect from a scholar who better than any- one else in his age understood that the his- torical process is all of one fabric? Just as Vico proposes that Homer's genius was "in- vention," i.e., giving a new turn to old myths, so I would suggest that what Vico offers is a new perspective upon traditional ways of asking questions about poetry. What does it mean to say that poetry is an imitation of nature? Is poetry rationally or inspirationally conceived? Is poetry simply for pleasure or has it a civilizing function? Vico was not attempting to present cate- gorical answers to such questions. Such an attempt was by his standards irrelevant. More important was a judgment concern- ing what the questions themselves indi- cated. By removing such questions from the timeless vacuum in which they had tradi- tionally been discussed and casting them in- stead in a historical context, Vice implicitly suggests why these particular questions arose in the first place, how the answers to them evolved, and why they had ceased to have meaning for his own century. The critics of the eighteenth century, des- perately aware of the extent to which neo- classical poetic theory had become anach- PATRICK H. H UTTON ronistic, were thoroughly prepared to enter- tain new critical questions. However sugges- tive scholars may have found his theories two centuries later, it was not Vice's task to ask new questions. Vico's arguments were specifically directed against the "conceit of scholars" of his own era "who will have it that what they know is as old as the world." 9 But his orientation was toward classical antiquity, whose culture he studied devotedly throughout his life. For this rea- son, it would perhaps be more appropriate to associate Vico not with Prometheus but with Minerva-for like her owl, it is the seemingly oblivious night of the past which engages his interest, a past which he shows may still be evoked from the deepest re- cesses of our own minds.'0 VICO'S THEORY OF HISTORY- THE ADVENT OF HISTORICAL IDEALISM Vice's insights into the social role of poetry are made possible by his radically new for- mulation of the theory of human cognition. He begins by distinguishing the phenome- nal and ontological realms of existence. The ontological world, i.e., the ideal world of man's preordained eternal history, is God's creation, and hence unknowable.1l Hence man's ultimate nature and destiny are beyond the ken of his own powers of understanding. But the phenomenal world, i.e., the sensible world in which man has developed historically, is man's own crea- tion, and, accordingly, can be recon- structed. Thus Vico limits the problem of cognition to the possibility of knowledge of the phenomenal world. The relationship between man's consciousness and his exis- tential situation is therefore a historical rather than a metaphysical problem. For Vico, man's nature is initially indefinite or potential. Immersed as he is in an infinite flux of relationships, he becomes aware of his nature only insofar as he defines it by acting to meet the challenges of his environ- ment. Thus far the Marxists would be in agreement with Vico's theory of human cog- nition. Marx said essentially the same thing when he speculated that man, enmeshed in the ensemble of his social relationships, ful-</page><page sequence="3">New Science of Giambattista Vico fills and defines his own nature by appro- priating physical nature through his labor.l2 But Vico is in fact the first representative of a decidedly different philosophical tradi- tion. For Vico, it is not man's existential involvement with the physical world as such which is crucial for the way in which man fashions his own nature. Man is no psychological automaton reacting in a nec- essary way, rational or otherwise, to his en- vironment. Rather the environment is only the potential occasion for a process of crea- tion which is entirely the product of the imagination. It is in his capacity to create images that man comes to create his own world and hence to know himself. Vico develops his argument in the follow- ing manner.l3 Primitive man in his igno- rance imposes anthropomorphic forms upon phenomena which he does not under- stand, and thus makes himself "the measure of all things." Hence to know and to create become synonymous, i.e., imaginative crea- tion is the means by which man's conscious- ness of the world unfolds. Initially, and by implication for every extension of human consciousness, such imaginative creations are expressed in the form of myths or fa- bles. Myths are prerational archetypal pat- terns of thought, composed of poetic char- acters, which in turn are the basic concrete units or models of human thought. Myths hew explicit modes of perception out of the flux of reality, and thus establish necessary directions for all subsequent development of human consciousness, even as it becomes reflective. Such myths are the imaginative creations of an elite of poetic genius. But each man must recreate or re-enact these same thought processes to develop his own consciousness. Thus myths become the ideal models for all social institutions, as all men continue to use these original forms of thought as a basis for their perception of reality and their description of social inter- course. In this sense, men live according to their myths. Providing the frame of refer- ence for the choices that man must make as he confronts the challenges of his environ- ment, myth becomes the ultimate basis of historical causation. An analogy may help to explain this 361 process of the development of human con- sciousness. In each historical epoch, man stands on the arc of an expanding circle of consciousness. The circumference of that circle of understanding expands in a series of concentric circles as the result of each new poetic creation. The horizons of knowl- edge are thus extended by an elite of ge- nius. But to reach the circumference of the new circle thus achieved, each individual must recreate for himself the original men- tal processes of the creator. Thus society imitates the myths of its poets, just as it regularizes its activities through the institu- tions which such myths naturally signify. The above analysis of the relationship be- tween the causal and the creative process in human endeavor is not intended to suggest that Vico conceives of the advancement of civilization as a unilinear progression along a radial axis of expanding consciousness with poetic creation as its constant motor force. Thus far we have examined only Vice's theory of cognition. When that theory is related to his wider conception of the historical process, another dimension is added to his conception of the social role of poetry. For Vico contends that as man's consciousness expands through poetic crea- tion, so also expands his capacity to reason. In a rough way, he argues that the poetic and rational components of the mentality of a society are inversely proportional at any given moment in the historical process.l4 Vico poetically qualifies this gen- eralization by suggesting that poetic expres- sion continues for a long time into a histor- ical epoch, "much as great and rapid rivers continue far into the sea." 15 Moreover, the abilities to reason abstractly and to create sublime poetry seem to be mutually exclu- sive for any single individual.l6 As a society develops, the philosophers with their ab- stract reasoning play a more and more cen- tral role, while the poets surrender their civ- ilizing mission and drift to the peripheral tasks of adorning that society's splendor.17 It is important to note, however, that ab- stract reasoning is never the basis for the creative expansion of the circle of knowl- edge. For "poetic wisdom," i.e., the capacity to divine practical knowledge, at the outset of an epoch adumbrates all of the possibili-</page><page sequence="4">362 ties of that epoch's subsequent "esoteric wis- dom." 18 The philosopher, whose modes of thought are conditioned by, and whose con- cepts are abstracted from, the poetic fables, merely organizes and clarifies what is al- ready implicitly contained in these myths. To return to our analogy, reason only ex- plores the circumference of the circle upon which the poet has already situated his so- ciety. Each circle represents the life cycle of a historical epoch. Each epoch must pass through the full circle from barbarism to the highest stage of civilized refinement and back again to a corresponding state of bar- baric dissolution before another poetic leap to a new circle of consciousness becomes possible.19 It must be stressed, however, that man's modes of expression and his institutional relationships do not change during the evo- lution of this epochal cycle. For the institu- tions, and the myths which signify them, created at the outset of an epoch are pre- served intact.20 What changes is the human perspective upon them as man passes through the successive stages of a cycle. For it is axiomatic that each man, wherever he stands in the historical cycle, ascribes to all men of all ages his own way of looking at the world.21 In his initial barbarous state, man creates his institutions and his fables out of necessity. But as his life becomes in- stitutionalized and hence secure, necessity yields to utility, then to pleasure, and fin- ally to the new barbarism of oversophisti- cation. While the original fables were a genuine expression of man's response to the challenge of his environment, the original meaning of the fables is altered and eventu- ally lost with the passage of time and the changing interests and values of man. As a civilization becomes more refined, poetry surrenders its civilizing function and be- comes a hollow and superfluous embellish- ment. The original forms of the myths re- main to baffle a posterity which cannot pos- sibly comprehend their meaning. The origi- nal institutions grow unwieldy, vex, and eventually spur man to destroy them so as to create them anew. In light of Vice's theory of historical change, it is easy to understand his explana- tion of why the neoclassical critics of the PATRICK H. HUTTON eighteenth century found it impossible to fathom the meaning of the rhetorical termi- nology of the ancients. The once evocative terms were now but vestigial forms devoid of their poetic substance. Standing in the sophisticated, waning arc of their own epoch, these critics simply assigned to these terms meanings drawn from their own ex- perience. Deceived in their overweening confidence that their knowledge bore a timeless character, they failed to grasp the mentality of the ancients in its concrete, historical setting. Vico's originality lies in his argument that modern man can compre- hend the mentality of his ancestors only if he is willing to proceed back through the cycle of the evolution of human conscious- ness to its earliest stage. At that level, he must recreate the thought processes of men whose language represented a natural and spontaneous signification of a meaningful confrontation with the problem of exist- ence. The implications of Vice's theory of his- tory for poetic theory must now be exam- ined in detail. The strengths and weak- nesses of his historicist argument in its rela- tion to poetics will be assessed in the fol- lowing sections with reference to two en- during concepts in the classical critical tra- dition-the concepts of mimesis and of the sublime. In the final section, an effort will be made to evaluate Vice's theory of poetry in its relation to his wider conception of the life cycles of civilizations. To do so, we must begin where Vice began-with the poets who asserted their humanity by un- folding in song the potentialities of their own consciousness. MIMESIS-THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN IMITATION AND IMAGINATION IN POETIC CREATION Throughout the history of classical and neoclassical poetics, critics conceived of po- etic creation as an imitation of nature. As a man of the eighteenth century, Vico is no exception. Vico, however, is the first such critic to explain why and how the concept originated, and thus to restore significance</page><page sequence="5">New Science of Giambattista Vico to a concept which had become virtually meaningless by the eighteenth century. His argument may be reconstructed briefly as follows.22 Entering the world in mute ignorance, yet impelled to express himself out of religious fear and natural curiosity, primitive man finds security in mimicking the sensory world which sur- rounds him and in which his own mind is totally absorbed. This mimicking, first in gestures and hieroglyphics, and then in ar- ticulate sounds, is the first stage of an imag- inative or creative imitation of nature. These mimes Vico calls "poetic characters," intensely expressive figures of speech which constitute the most elementary forms of pri- mitive man's response to the phenomenal world. Primitive man mimics because he is unable to abstract forms from the phenome- nal world around him. As he mimics, he begins to differentiate himself from the phe- nomenal flux in which he is immersed. First, he defines himself in terms of poetic characters. Then he extends his field of per- ception by imposing these anthropo- morphic forms upon phenomena external to himself. In this sense, "nature" is noth- ing but a process of naming, or interpret- ing, the external world through poetic characters.23 Read herein the origins of metaphor. Primitive man was a poet not out of genius, but out of necessity. Once primitive man has created poetic characters, the intelligible units of thought, and related these in myths, the basic pat- terns of thought, the preconditions for ra- tional abstraction have been created. Rap- idly, myths begin to lose their imaginative impulse, but they endure as the ideal mod- els which society imitates in order to give structure to its perception of the world.24 Originally born of religious fear, myths re- tain their poetic meaning and expressive- ness as patterns for the ritualistic re-enact- ment of the religious auspices they were originally intended to fulfill for a consider- able period of time in any given historical epoch.25 But as myths subsequently provide the institutional patterns for what is clearly secular endeavor, their expressiveness dimin- ishes and their meaning becomes obscure. As civilized man's rational abstractions be- come more complex and self-generative, 363 they become divorced from the mythic pat- terns of thought in which they originated, and as a consequence sever all relations with the sources of their imaginative forma- tion. Henceforth, the myths themselves be- come progressively more corrupt, perform- ing for awhile a figurative or anagogical function, but ultimately degenerating into meaningless forms (i.e., the pejorative sense in which we usually understand the term). Vico seems to be arguing that the ra- tional critic of the eighteenth century is left without intelligible touchstones by which to interpret the concept of the poetic imita- tion of nature in a definitive way. As the real essence of nature is beyond the ken of human understanding and known only to God, and as the causal origins of the con- cept are lost in the oblivion of the past, the critic is thrown back upon the resources of his reason, which, of course, are unequal to the task. Is poetic creation an imitation of empirical nature, or the general nature of essences, or nature as it ought to be? The question cannot be answered in rational terms. Therefore, Vico concludes, the critics judge poetry in accordance with the values and prejudices of their age.27 Vico thus offers a perspective by which to judge the critics of the classical and neo- classical traditions. That perspective on the development of the concept of mimesis pro- vides a basis for appreciating the preoccu- pations of the critics in any given historical era. It suggests why poetry was originally associated with religious ritual and why im- itation, i.e., mimicry, was a necessary mode of poetic creation for the first poets. It also goes far toward explaining why the critics of the more reflective ages of both Greek and Roman civilization (Aristotle and Hor- ace, for example) stressed "invention," i.e., the manipulation or arrangement of poetic elements, rather than imaginative creation, wlhy they conceived of figures of speech as ornamental rather than as necessary modes of poetic expression, and why they paid close attention to plot development while adhering almost blindly to the mythic leg- ends for these plots. Furthermore, it ex- plains why the rationalist Plato believed that Homer told lies about the gods and why Plato rejected poetic imitation as an</page><page sequence="6">364 inferior form of cognition. Whether or not one accepts Vico's historicist contention that the historical process itself provides the ultimate standard for evaluating poetry, his precept that a historical perspective is an indispensable aid for interpreting the way in which past generations have evaluated poetic creation is a significant theoretical contribution to our understanding why cer- tain critical concerns have waxed large in classical and neoclassical poetic theory. But now we must turn to the limitations of Vico's theory of poetry. THE SUBLIME--THE NATURE OF POETIC EXPRESSION Paradoxically, the strength of Vico's con- tribution to the history of poetics is predi- cated upon the weakness of his theory of poetry as such. Because the causal principle in his theory of history requires the sudden expansion of human consciousness through poetic creation followed by the gradual ex- ploration of the potentialities of that con- sciousness through rational abstraction, his conception of poetry is of necessity static. Poetic expression for Vice is essentially the eighteenth-century equivalent of Longinus' concept of the sublime. Poetry is narrowly defined as the prerational creation of poetic characters, concrete, imaginative expres- sions of intense feelings of fear and wonder.28 Vico's theory of history does not permit him to provide for the possibility that poetic creation might develop further out of its own inner potentialities. For Vico, poetry can have no end in itself. Po- etic creation is strictly tied to its civilizing function, which Vico defines as "wisdom," i.e., the intuitive grasp of useful knowledge, and furthermore can perform that function only in certain historical contexts.29 Poetry is a spontaneous product of curiosity, "the daughter of ignorance and the mother of knowledge."30 Serving primarily as the midwife to civilization, poetic creation in effect makes further poetic creation impossi- ble. The problems involved are obvious. As poetic beauty is equated with richness of expression, and such expression is possible only in certain historical contexts, Vico is PATRICK H. HUTTON unable to account for the seeming inability of poets to create masterpieces in the proper chronological sequence. He attempts to resolve this dilemma by arguing that poetic expression endures far into the pe- riod of reason in the life cycle of any given civilization.31 This is made possible by the capacity of the original fables, and of the poetic characters of which they are com- posed, to fire the imagination of listeners long after the era in which they were cre- ated. For imagination is closely linked with memory, i.e., with the mimetic re-enact- ment of the poets' spontaneous creations.32 It is in this context that Vico offers his appreciation of Homer's genius.33 Homer's talent, Vico concludes, was not in poetic creation. By the time that he composed his epics, the heroic age of Greek civilization was already in its waning stages and fast approaching the stage of its rational matu- rity. Rather, Homer's talent lay in his ca- pacity to weave the intensely expressive po- etic characters of an earlier age into new kinds of harmonious configurations, charac- ters transmitted over half a millenium by the wandering rhapsodes of Greece. In this sense, Homer's poetry was the common cre- ation of the Greek people. Vico describes Dante's genius in similar terms by explain- ing that Dante, although skilled in philoso- phy, nonetheless wrote in the robust idiom of the common man.34 Vico's argument here displays his remarkable insight into the origins of epic poetry. His analysis of the way in which Homer used poetic for- mulas transmitted across the centuries by peripatetic bards has been confirmed by the modern scholarship of Parry and Lord.35 Still, Vice's historicist definition of poetic value requires that the poet of genius emerge within the early stages of a civiliza- tion's development, however flexible his definition of these stages may be. Thus he concedes that Aristotle and Horace gave sound advice to their respective contempo- raries when they admonished aspiring poets to adhere closely to the old plots (i.e., fa- bles) and shows himself to be decidedly skeptical about the possibility of genuine poetic creation in the rational stages of a maturing civilization. "... he who is not a poet by nature can never become one by</page><page sequence="7">New Science of Giambattista Vico art," Vico asserts dogmatically.36 For better or for worse, he has tied the possibility of poetic creativity to the "spirit of its age." The roles of metaphysician and poet are not interchangeable. For all of his insights into the origins and development of poetry, Vico is first a histo- rian and a critic only when it suits his pur- poses. As his primary concern is to recon- struct the spirit or ethos of an age, he must find a touchstone by which to gauge that ethos. This he finds in the process by which the human consciousness develops toward rational maturity.37 In this sense, Vico is the first cultural historian, i.e., the causal principle in history is to be found in "the modifications of the human mind." 38 The implication is that all man's conscious en- deavor, creative or imitative, imaginative or rational, poetical or philosophical, is equiva- lent in terms of its value: namely, its efficacy in providing institutional patterns for the realization of social ends. Linked to such a utilitarian function, poetry has no potentialities for the development of its own resources. The task of formulating a theory of poetry which adequately ac- counted for the independence of poetic val- ues would be taken up by the scholars of the following century, particularly by Im- manuel Kant. The shortcomings of Vico's theory of poetry, however, ought not to di- minish the significance of his seminal in- sights into the relationship between the arts and social change. It is to that problem that we must finally turn. C O N C L U S I O N -THE S O C I A L USES OF POETRY IN VICO S THEORY OF HISTORY Among the ancient critics, none thought harder about the place of the poet in so- ciety than Plato, and none was more skepti- cal about the poet's social role. Thus in the Tenth Book of the Republic, he banished poets from the ideal City-State under a threefold indictment: poetic imitation is in- ferior because it imitates only the appear- ance and not the essence of reality; the poet's objective is only to produce an emo- tional effect, which can but debilitate the moral fiber of the citizenry; poetry is a 365 deception in that it tells lies about the gods. By tracing the origins of these propositions, Vico meets Plato's objections, and in effect brings the debate about the central ques- tions of classical and neoclassical criticism to a close.39 Plato's misunderstanding of the problem of mimesis, Vico would argue, stems from his inability to appreciate the tasks of the first poets. These poets were not learned philosophers-from the rationalist's stand- point, they were thoroughly ignorant men. But what they had to say was in a sense true, for it was through their poetic crea- tions that the phenomenal world was hence- forth to be perceived. For these poets were seers, i.e., mythmakers. Through their myths, they translated their response to their existential situation into archetypal patterns of thought, patterns which set the form and limits of subsequent rational re- flection about the nature of the external world. The poet does not imitate the ap- pearance of reality but, rather, evokes its form from his own consciousness. In this sense, poetry is man's essential metaphysical activity.40 With Plato's second objection, Vico would likewise take issue. Poetry, contends Vico, is expressive of intense emotions, but its effect is to reinforce rather than to weaken the moral character of the listeners. For the emotions which the first poets evoked were those of fear and wonder, and these poets were held in religious awe be- cause of their capacity to divine the hidden nature of reality. The poets were teachers -they provided ignorant men with mythic explanations in the face of new experience. Out of their mythic improvisations, they in- tuitively grasped the rudimentary necessi- ties of social organization, and so provided primitive man with "wisdom," i.e., the rit- ual forms with which to regularize his so- cial intercourse. The effect of poetry, then, was not to promote anarchy but, rather, the social discipline which enabled primitive man to enter into civilization. In response to Plato's third objection, i.e., that poetry tells lies about the gods, we find Vico at his most masterful, for he goes to the heart of his deepest religious commit- ments. Poetry is based upon a deception,</page><page sequence="8">366 but it is an honest deception. For man is by nature weak and subject to corruption. To embark upon the path toward civilization, he needs the security of belief and the dis- cipline of social institutions. The practical wisdom which the myths provide may not correspond directly to God's eternal wis- dom, but it nonetheless permits the fulfill- ment of God's providential plan: the pres- ervation of the human race upon the earth.41 The myths of the poets provide pri- mitive man in his barbarous ignorance with the illusion necessary for his redemption as an individual, i.e., with the mythic institu- tionalization of man in society to permit his progressive development toward rational consciousness. Is Vico, then, a philosopher of progress? Despite his objections to Plato's analysis of the social role of poetry, would he not have agreed with Plato that the poet, having ac- complished his primordial tasks, ought to be banished from the ideal City-State? It is here that we must take issue with those who stress Vico's modernity. To answer these questions, one must appreciate Vico's pro- found Augustinianism. The paradox for Vico is that, as civilized man grows in ra- tional maturity, he becomes estranged from the passionate ground of existence. In time, his literary creations become drained of their poetic content; his myths cease to pro- vide a basis for belief. It is a predicament from which civilized man cannot escape. The dissolution of his civilization is a neces- sary process. The necessity lies not in his material environment but in his human nature.42 The mythic ethos of a civilization cannot be extended; it must be created anew. The dignity of man lies not in prog- ress for its own sake but in the creative process by which man refashions his world in each historical epoch. In this enterprise, the role of the poet is central. 1 For a biographical sketch of Vico and a brief but excellent discussion of his influence, see the in- troduction by Max H.
