<plain_text><page sequence="1">720967 Injury Frequency and Head Restraint Effectiveness in Rear-End Impact Accidents John D. States, John C. Balcerak, James S. Williams, Alexander T. Morris, William Babcock, Robert Polvino, Paul Riger and Raymond E. Dawley Research Accident Investigation, University of Rochester REAR-END IMPACTS are one of the most common of all ac- cidents, and whiplash injury is the most commonly occurring injury from such an accident. Hype rex tension of the cervical spine causes whiplash in most instances, and head restraints have been designed to prevent whiplash by preventing hyper- extension in rear-end impact accidents. These statements are examined in the light of past research and of an epidemiological study of rear-end impacts in an urban area (Rochester, New York). LITERATURE REVIEW REAR-END ACCIDENT FREQUENCY - The National Safety Council estimates that 24% of all accidents are rear-end impacts. In these totals, it is estimated that 27% of urban acci- dents and 18% of rural accidents are rear-end impacts (1)*. Considering only fatal accidents, 4.7% are caused by rear-end impacts. Of these, 4.2% occur in urban areas and 4.8% in rural areas. Locally in Monroe County, which excludes the city of Rochester, 32.7% of all accidents are rear-end impacts (2). Of these, 32.4% resulted in injury and 0.3% caused death. In the city of Rochester, 29% of all accidents were rear-end impacts in 1970 and 31% in 1971.

ABSTRACT All of the rear-end impact accidents occurring in the city of Rochester, New York, in a three-month period were surveyed by tabulation of the police accident reports. Special police in- formation forms, telephone interviews, and mail questionnaires were used for further data acquisition. Vehicle photographs and medical examinations were conducted for approximately every 20th vehicle. During the data collection period, 69 1 rear-end impacts occurred. Although a computer program revealed 1371 acci- dents, defects in the program accounted for the large differ- ence. Whiplash injury frequency based on telephone inter- view and mail questionnaire data obtained one to seven days after the accident revealed a whiplash injury frequency of 38%, which was approximately twice that determined by on-scene police investigators. Head restraints reduced whiplash fre- quency by 14% and fixed head restraints appeared to be more effective. Seventy percent of adjustable head restraints were in the downmost position. Women sustained whiplash injury more frequently (51%) but benefited from head restraints more (whiplash injury frequency 38%). An extensive review of the literature related to whiplash in- jury and head restraint design and effectiveness is presented. 2847</page><page sequence="2">2848 J. D. STATES, ET AL. of the Highway Safety Research Institute (HSRI) of the Uni- versity of Michigan determined in 1971 that 40.1% of multi- vehicle accidents were rear-end collision and that 33% caused injury, while 0.12% caused death. Rear-end impacts were the second largest group of collision types, the largest being angle collisions, which accounted for 50.8% of all multivehicle colli- sions. In March 1970, the Ford Motor Co. Automotive Safety Re- search Office (5) reported that 7.04 million accidents out of a total of 14.6 million property damage, injury, and fatality ac- cidents in 1968 were rear-end impacts. During that same year, in which over 46,800 fatal accidents occurred, 4500 or 9% were rear-end impacts. Mackay of the University of Birmingham, United King- dom (6), reported that 9.8% of a group of 643 accidents occur- ring in the Birmingham area were rear-end impacts. The high- est percentage, 1 1.3% occurred in a rural area, compared with 9.4% in a metropolitan area and 5.3% on limited access high- ways. New York State statistical data for 1970 (4) reveal that 38.4% of all accidents were rear-end impacts, which consti- tuted the largest single group. Angular impacts accounted for 33.2% of the total. Nationally, it is estimated that there are four million (7) rear- end impacts each year and that such accidents are more com- mon in urban areas. INJURY INCIDENCE - The incidence of injury occurring in rear-end accidents has never been conclusively determined. In 1963, based on a review of 575 patients with neck injuries, McNab (8) estimated that neck injury occurs in one-fifth of all rear-end impact automobile accidents. Carlson, in his anal- ysis of the National Accident Summary Data (3), cited an in- jury rate of 33-1/3%, but the basis for the rate was not speci- fied. O'Neill, et al., of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (29) in 1971 determined an injury incidence for drivers of 24% for head restraint-equipped cars and 29% for un- equipped vehicles. This study was based on a review of 67,000 insurance claims in which 5663 were rear-end impact accidents. Passengers were specifically omitted from the study because seated location data were not available. Kihlberg, from Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory's (CAL) Automobile Crash Injury Research (ACIR) files (45), revealed an overall incidence of approximately 15%. This study used data collected in 1968 before headrests became mandatory equipment. Although not specified in the paper, the time period for determination of injury was restricted to 24 h in past ACIR studies. NATURE OF WHIPLASH - Two factors have made the de- termination of an injury rate in rear-end impacts difficult. Symptoms of injury resulting from rear-end impacts are often delayed hours or days so that the injury is not evident at the scene of the accident and cannot be reported to police acci- dent investigators (20, 80). Most data on which currently available statistics are based are derived from police accident investigations and do not reflect the true incidence of neck injury. The second factor is the lack of a definition of whip- lash injury. Objective clinical evidence of injury does not exist in a typical case, precluding a strict definition of injury. The clinical entity of whiplash injury has never been strictly defined in the medical literature. Many physicians object to the use of the term "whiplash" because of its lack of objec- tivity and definition. In 1928, Crowe (9) presented eight cases of neck injuries resulting from traffic accidents and used the term whiplash for the first time. Since then, he has per- sonally regretted the use of the term and has been joined by other physicians (10-13). Two misleading studies were reported in 1956 and 1959 that received wide attention in the medical and legal communities. Braunstein and Moore (85) reviewed 144 neck injury reports from ACIR and reported that 46 had no objective evidence of injury but were reported to have whiplash injury. The authors concluded that the conscious or unconscious desire for gain on the part of patients may motivate them to exaggerate their in- juries and disabilities. Gotten (86) reported a review of 100 patients with neck injuries from rear-end impact automobile accidents in which 88% recovered after litigation was settled. He stated that 85% of the patients had psychosomatic com- plaints. These studies were not immediately refuted because the pathological anatomy of whiplash injury was not known at that time. Beginning in 1960, systematic research was under- taken that has clarified the pathology of whiplash by estab- lishing an anatomical basis for the diagnosis. McNab (14, 15) dropped supine anesthetized monkeys down an elevator shaft with their heads unsupported, producing hyperextension of their cervical spines. The animals were dropped from different heights producing injuries of varying severity. Autopsy studies revealed muscle injuries ranging from minor tears in the sternocleidomastoid muscles to partial avulsion of the longus colli. Tears of the longus colli were associated with retropha- rangeal hematomas and hemorrhages in the muscularis of the esophagus. Separation of the intervertebral disc from the adja- cent vertebra was also noted. Subsequent studies were performed by Wickstrom, Martinez, Rodriguez (16), and others conducted acceleration studies of rabbits and monkeys in which the animals were accelerated in a forward-facing direction (G + X) while in a sitting position. Biopsy and autopsy studies revealed that only 8% of the for- ward-facing and 10.7% of the rearward-facing animals sus- tained no injury. Injuries reported included multiple ligamen- tous, muscular, and bony injuries of the neck and cervical spine, hemorrhage and scarring in surviving animals in the brain, and hemorrhage in the thyroid gland and behind the esophagus and larynx in the neck. Electroencephalographic studies of surviving animals revealed multiple abnormalities (16-18). Luongo (19) in 1969 autopsied an automobile driver who died of a myocardial infarction immediately prior to impact and who was determined to have sustained hyperextension of the cervical spine as evidenced by the vehicle and occupant kinematics and associated injuries. This victim sustained mul- tiple ligamentous and muscular tears in the middle and lower cervical spine. Other human clinical data are lacking because of the rare association of death with whiplash injury. CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM INJURY IN WHIPLASH -</page><page sequence="3">INJURY FREQUENCY IN REAR-END ACCIDENTS 2849 States (20) in a clinical review of 60 rear-end impact accidents reported that concussion occurred in 10 accidents. On the basis of animal studies, Holbourn, Ommaya, Hirsch, and Mar- tinez (21-25) have revealed that significant angular accelera- tion due to head rotation occurred and caused concussion. Ommaya and Yarnell (26) reported two case histories of pa- tients who sustained subdural hematomas, without impacts, from whiplash injuries. VanGijn and Wintzen reported a case in which a 53-year-old man sustained an extracerebral hema- toma confirmed by surgery that was sustained in a side impact accident causing head rotation but not contact (27). An ex- tensive review of the literature concerning the significance of rotational versus linear acceleration in the causation of concus- sion and other central nervous system injuries is contained in two recent publications (28, 88), and readers are referred to these for a more detailed review. OTHER CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM INJURIES - Sev- eral authors have reported alteration in the electroencephalo- gram in clinical and experimental studies. Torres in 1961 re- ported 21 abnormal EEGs in 45 patients with whiplash injuries (28). Gilbert in 1969 reported that EEGs, if taken within 24 h after injury, usually showed some slowing but the abnormali- ties cleared within a week (29). An experimental study per- formed by Hiyama utilizing rabbits revealed that fast-wave changes attributed to the neocortex appeared within a few hours after injury but subsided in two to five days. In con- trast, high-amplitude slow waves and spikes occurred in the hypothalamus but did not appear for 7 days and lasted for as long as 45 days (30). Toglia, et al., reported dizziness and hearing losses in 35 of 50 patients who sustained head trauma or whiplash and had been examined utilizing audiometrie and caloric test proce- dures. One patient was found to have a fracture through the right petrous pyramid and a secondary dislocation of the incus and stapes (31). Visual disturbances, diplopia, irregularities of pupils, distur- bances of visual acuity, and pain symptoms have been reported by several authors. Gibson reported three case studies of pa- tients who had difficulty focusing, diplopia, and ocular pain (32). Roca in 1971 presented a series of 16 patients with many different eye symptoms and signs following whiplash injury (33). Yamaji found a majority of 42 truck drivers who had been struck from behind had defects in dynamic visual acuity and horizontal phoria and width of fusion (34). CLINICAL EXAMINATION AND FINDINGS OF WHIPLASH INJURY - The physician caring for a patient with whiplash injury is restricted in his diagnostic armamentarium to those diagnostic methods suitable for a patient with a medi- cal injury of minor severity. The investigative armamentarium includes the medical history, physical examination, and x-rays. In the more prolonged and/or disabling case, special x-rays in- cluding cervical myelography and various blood chemistries may be utilized in attempting to make a definitive diagnosis. EEGs are occasionally used when there is evidence of concus- sion. However, the clinician is severely limited in his ability to diagnose the precise anatomical structure injured in whiplash and revealed by experimental autopsy studies previously cited. Reviews detailing the clinical symptoms, physical examination, and x-ray findings are detailed in publications by DeGravelles and Kelley (35), Goff, Aides, and Alden (36), States, Korn, and Massengil (20), and Gurdjian (37). The medical history reveals that the onset of neck, shoulder, or head pain may begin immediately but may be delayed sev- eral hours or days following a whiplash-producing accident (80). Location of pain is typically in the back of the neck but may occur in the front and sides of the neck as well as in the shoulder girdle and dorsal spine extending distally to T7. Pain may also occur in the occipital region of the skull frontal re- gion (eyebrows) and throughout the calvarium as a headache of nonspecific nature. Disturbances of perception include visual changes previously cited, disorders of hearing and bal- ance previously cited, difficulty swallowing, as well as stiffness and pain with motion of the neck. Injury to the nerve roots of the cervical spinal cord will cause symptoms of pain, paren- thesias, and weakness in the upper extremities, particularly the hands. INJURY OF INTERVERTEBRAL DISC OF CERVICAL SPINE - Cervical nerve root irritation may be caused by her- niation of the intervertebral discs. Minor disc extrusions or herniations heal spontaneously. More persistent disc extru- sions that cause significant disability (weakness in hands, per- sistent severe pain) require localization by x-ray myelography and surgical excision (38). Minor neck injuries in which there is no evidence of bone or disc injury may cause persistent and severely disabling symp- toms. In a review of 10,000 neck pain problems treated at the Mayo Clinic between 1956 and 1963, James presented 32 who required posterior cervical spine fusion for relief of symptoms. Surgery was deferred an average of 28.3 months after injury. Pathological findings at the time of surgery were marked hy- permobility of one or two cervical vertebrae in 13 cases, rup- ture of the interspinous, superspinous, and ligamentum nuchae and interspinous ligaments, calcification of ligaments, and degenerative changes in the ligaments (39). CLINICALLY DETECTABLE SEVERE MUSCULOSKELE- TAL INJURIES DUE TO HYPEREXTENSION - Many cases of fracture-dislocations and severe disc herniations resulting in cervical spinal cord injury have been reported (40-43). No large series of rear-end impact accidents has been statistically analyzed with respect to the nature and severity of injuries, however. Small series are contained in papers by States, et al., (20) and Gurdjian (37). A review of the available medical literature reveals no cases of paraplegia following rear-end impact acci- dents. Miller and Schultz (44) reported three cases due to hyperextension, but in each instance hyperextension was caused by forehead impact and only one occurred in an auto- mobile accident. The kinematics of this type of hyperexten- sion injury are probably different from simple whiplash caused by rear-end impacts without head contact. MECHANISM OF INJURY - Neck motion is normally lim- ited by the chest and shoulders, which become anatomical blocks to forward and lateral flexion. The normal range of motion of the neck is reported as follows (46-48):</page><page sequence="4">2850 J. D. STATES, ET AL. 1. Flexion: 54-67 deg. 2. Extension: 61-93 deg. 3. Lateral Flexion: 41 deg. 4. Rotation: 73-76 deg. All of the subjects in the above determinations ranged in age from 18-40 years, and the majority were males. Ferlic (50) determined the total range of flexion and extension in a group of subjects ranging in age from 15-64 years. He noted their range decreased from 139 ± 19 deg for age 15-24 to 116± 22 deg for ages 55-64. Gadd, Culver, and Nahum (51) in 1971 determined the bending moment of four unembalmed cadavers. Injury did not occur in any of the cadavers until the necks were extended beyond 70 deg. The effectiveness of the chest and shoulders as anatomical blocks has not been assessed in the available literature. How- ever, the number of whiplash injuries occurring in head-on and side-impact accidents is small, constituting not more than 30% (20, 37, 40, 49). The implication of these findings is that the neck is usually protected against injury caused by motion ex- ceeding its physiological range by the anatomical blocks pro- vided by the chest and shoulders. Portnoy, et al., (53), in a clinical review of 55 serious neck injuries caused by automobile accidents, demonstrated that hyperextension neck injuries may occur in head-on automo- bile accidents. Forehead contact occurs, causing rearward dis- placement of the neck and extension of the cervical spine. The majority of whiplash injuries appear to be caused by ex- tension beyond the physiological range of neck motion, in contrast to forward and lateral flexion, which are blocked by chest and shoulders. There exists no block for extension. Tuell (52), an orthopedic surgeon, in 1958 allowed himself to be experimentally rear-ended at 20 mph. He was seated in a 1951 Ford that was struck by a 1948 DeSoto sedan. High- speed movies revealed that Tuell's head and neck extended 120 deg. His neck was painful for a few days but he denied any significant disability. HEAD RESTRAINT DESIGN - A device to prevent neck ex- tension beyond the physiological range appeared to be the ob- vious means of preventing whiplash. Ruedemann (54) in 1957 proposed that a padded 6-in fixed headrest be attached to the top of automobile seat backs for neck protection. Severy, et al., (55), after testing a variety of seats, seat backs, and head restraints in crash tests utilizing 1967 full-size Ford sedans, concluded that a 28 in high seat back would protect up to the 95th percentile male occupant. Higher seat backs would pro- tect taller occupants, but rearward and rear corner vision of the driver and forward vision of rear seat occupants would be severely compromised. Severy also demonstrated that head offset of up to 6 in did not significantly reduce the effective- ness of the head restraint. Berton (56) determined the neck extension limiting capability of various head restraint heights in sled tests utilizing anthropomorphic dummies. Twenty- eight inch high head restraints permitted only 20 deg neck ex- tension in spite of a 4 in offset. FMVSS 202 made head restraints mandatory equipment for passenger cars sold in the United States after December 31, 1968. The majority of headrests installed to meet this stan- dard initially were adjustable. In a study by CAL (57), adjust- able head restraints, found in 72.6% of head restraint-equipped cars, were in the up position in only 17.7%. The examination of the heights of headrests in the down position relative to a 95th percentile occupant revealed a significant difference in height relative to the occupant. The lowest head restraint, which extended to the spinous process of the third thoracic vertebra, was installed in the American Motors Matador model. In contrast, the American Motors Ambassador was equipped with a head restraint that in its lowest position extended to the height of C5 spinous process. The highest headrest in the down position was that installed in the Ford Motor Co. Thun- derbird, and was at the C3 spinous process level. In an effort to make head restraints less objectionable, de- velopment of déployable headrests using airbag technology has begun. Melvin, et al., (58), using two airbag head restraints and a mechanical sliding head restraint, demonstrated that effective protection could be achieved. INJURIES FROM HEAD RESTRAINTS - States, et al., (20) demonstrated through case studies that whiplach injury oc- curred in spite of the presence of head restraints. The exact mechanism of injury is not always apparent. Tall occupents receive injury from neck hyperextension over the top of the adjustable head restraints. Beatty (59) reported an odontoid fracture that occurred with the head restraint in the down po- sition from this mechanism. States also reported the occur- rence of whiplash injury in a vehicle equipped with fixed head restraints; the authors hypothesized that hyperextension oc- curred because of differential rebound of the head and chest from the seat back and restraint that had vastly different spring rates. Severy, et al., (55) noted an alternative mecha- nism in which dummies slid upward permitting neck hyper- extension over the top of the head restraint. The third injury mechanism was noted in a multidisciplinary accident investigation (MAI) case study RAI 69, University of Rochester (60), in which a torsion injury of the neck occurred. In this rear-end impact accident, a middle-aged male sustained a whiplash injury due to a torsional strain that occurred when he impacted his shoulder belt after rebounding from the seat back and head restraint. Back seat occupants have sustained injury from impacting head restraints. Fetterman (61) reported that a 14-year-old girl sustained bilateral midshaft clavicle fractures from striking the back of a head restraint in a head-on collision. A review of the MAI cases automated file of the HSR1 in mid- 1972 by J. Fell (92) revealed that of a total of 1777 ve- hicles, 930 were involved in head-on impacts between 10 and 2 o'clock. Eighty of the vehicles were equipped with head restraints and contained rear seat occupants. Eighteen re- ported head restraint contact. The majority of injuries were head or chest and appeared attributable to the head restraint. Injury severity (Abbreviated Injury Scale) ranged from 1 to 6 and damage severity (last digit of Vehicle Deformation Index) from 2 to 8. KINEMATICS AND TOLERANCE FOR INJURY OF HUMAN NECK - An early and persistent obstacle in head re- straint design is the lack of knowledge of the kinematics and</page><page sequence="5">INJURY FREQUENCY IN REAR-END ACCIDENTS 285 1 tolerance for injury of the human neck. The complex anat- omy of the neck has made investigative approaches difficult. Limited static test data of isolated components of the neck are available (62-65), but provide little useful information be- cause of the complex kinematics and dampening of the hu- man neck. Far more sophisticated analysis has been undertaken by Martz and Patrick (66) and Gadd, Culver, and Nahum (51). Mertz and Patrick, utilizing dynamic sled testing, compared the injury tolerance of human volunteers and cadavers and concluded that a 50th percentile male can tolerate a moment of 44 ft-lb about the occipital condyles without injury: Sled accelerations of up to 6.8 G did not cause symptoms, but an acceleration of 9.6 G caused neck and back pain lasting several days. This paper is prefaced by an excellent engineering de- scription of the anatomy of the human neck. Gadd, Culver, and Nahum (51) dynamically tested four elderly cadavers and determined that neck injury occurred with as little as 160 in-lb moment. In an earlier study in 1967, Mertz and Patrick (66) compared the kinematics of volunteers, cadavers, and dummies. Neck rotation in cadavers (83 deg) was twice that of volunteers (41 deg), establishing limitations in the use of cadavers in hu- man kinematic research. The authors concluded that neck ex- tension should be limited to 80 deg and preferably to 60 deg to avoid injury. In a recent series of sled tests of airbags by Clarke, et al., (68) utilizing volunteers, it was revealed that neck extension caused by face impact on the bag beyond 68 deg resulted in whiplash injury symptoms, confirming Mertz and Patrick's conclusion. MATHEMATICAL MODELS OF NECK - The advent of volunteer, cadaver, and animal dynamic tests permitted the development of mathematical models of the human cervical spine. These models can be expected to greatly facilitate and accelerate head restraint development and design. Parameters for such models and an injury threshold have been delineated by Mertz and Patrick (66). Martinez (87) developed one of the earliest models, which had an articulated cervical spine. Subsequent models have been developed by Furusho (69), Higuchi, et al., (70), and Pontius (71). Pontius's model is noteworthy because each vertebra is separately considered in the model. NECK DESIGN IN ANTHROPOMORPHIC DUMMIES - Most experimental full-scale vehicle crash research in rear-end impact accidents has required the use of anthropomorphic dummies. Although much of our present knowledge of occu- pant kinematics and head restraint effectiveness is based on this research, dummy neck design remains primitive. Anthropomorphic dummies were first used as human simu- lations in aviation design in the early 1920s (72) and for auto- mobile design since the early 1950s (73). Early dummies were essentially articulated sandbags with dimensions similar to the human head, torso, and extremities. More sophisticated dummy design began in 1949 when Ritterrath of Sierra Engi- neering Co. (74) undertook the design and manufacture of an anthropomorphic dummy. Other design and construction ef- forts were undertaken by Mathewson and Severy in 1951 (73), Alderson in 1952 (75), Aldman of Sweden (76) in 1960, and Mira of the United Kingdom in 1972 (77). Dummy necks most often have been rubber cylinders or stacks of rubber washers tethered by a cable passing through the center anchored to the headform and to the top of the chest. Sierra and General Motors have used a series of ball- and-socket joints with adjustable friction devices and with rub- ber washers in between for shock absorption. Although these devices approximate the normal range of motion of the cervical spine, little else in the kinematic per- formance resembled the human neck. The rubber block or washer types have the problem of a linear load deflection curve in contrast to the human neck, which flexes through its full range of motion with little increase in load until the physiological limit of motion is exceeded, at which time the load rapidly increases (51). Both types lack stretch in the vertical axis and dampening in all directions. Recently, manufacturers have had difficulty meeting the head acceleration requirements imposed by FMVSS 208, which requires performance testing utilizing a 30 mph barrier impact equivalent for belt restraint systems (79). The high accelerations may be attributable largely to failure of dummy necks to stretch and to absorb energy as occurs in the human being. FACTORS PREDISPOSING TO WHIPLASH INJURY - The majority of occupants of vehicles struck from behind do not receive neck injury (3, 8, 20, 29). Several factors may modify an occupant's risk of injury: 1. Human or medical factors: sex, age, body build, cervical spine arthritis, seated position in vehicle, and position at mo- ment of impact. 2. Vehicle factors: seat back failure, vehicle crush, and head restraint. The sex of the vehicle occupant is a relevant factor. O'Neill et al., (20) reported an injury rate for the driver of 37% for fe- males and 24% for males in vehicles without head restraints. Schutt and Dohan (80) reported a much higher neck injury rate for female factory workers than for male factory workers, particularly in urban areas. The rates were 4.8 times the male rate in the urban areas and 1.7 times the male rate in rural areas. Rates for other types of automobile accident injuries were about equal and did not reflect a sex difference. Kihl- berg (45) in an analysis of ACIR data in 1969 reported that the female injury rate was twice that of males. The reasons for this difference in injury frequency are not known. Male necks are larger in circumference than are female necks (81). Using data from military anthropometry studies (81), the ratio of neck cross-sectional area to head volume can be calculated; for the 50th percentile male, it is 1: 135 and for the comparable female it is 1:151. The ratio is determined 3 ? by the formula head circumference /neck circumference = ratio. This ratio quantitates the observation that females have smaller necks relative to head size. It appears reasonable to as- sume that head weight or mass is directly proportional to head volume because there is little difference in the material struc- tures. Taller occupants may be more vulnerable to whiplash. Kihlberg (45) reported "a faint suggestion of a positive corre-</page><page sequence="6">2852 J. D. STATES, ET AL. lation" for the increased risk of neck injury for taller occu- pants. Seated position is another factor. Front seat occupants more often sustain neck injury than rear seat occupants in his study. Other factors such as age, body build, presence of arthritis in the cervical spine, muscular tone and conditioning, and occu- pant position at impact have not been conclusively examined to date. Wiggins (82) reported a prolonged, above-average con- valescense of patients with preexisting degenerative disease or arthritic changes following whiplash injury. He reported an average recovery period of 6.1 weeks for 313 patients injured in rear-end collisions who were treated in his office. VEHICLE FACTORS - Seat back failure appears to protect occupants from neck injury by allowing the torso and shoul- ders to move rearward with the head (20, 29, 45). O'Neill, et al., (29) reported that the frequency of neck injuries increased with the introduction of the headrest in 1968 model Volks- wagens. A group of 767 rear-impacted VWs were reviewed and 50 seat back failures were identified. These were not a suffi- ciently large number to explain the low incidence of neck in- jury (15%) in VW drivers in pre- 1968 models. Vehicle crushability may also be a factor in whiplash injury causation; some vehicles have "softer" rear ends than others and might be expected to protect the occupants from whip- lash injury. However, O'Neill, et al., (29), who presented data that classified cars by make, did not establish this. Classifica- tion by model and structural type would be necessary to ex- amine this question accurately. Severy, et al., (55, 83), in a series of comprehensive experi- mental crash tests, reported that occupant compartment accel- erations of up to 8 G occurred in rear-end impacts of speeds of less than 10 mph. Little vehicle damage was reported in these impacts. In an unreported case (84), a 43-year-old athletic male sus- tained a whiplash injury when he was impacted from behind while driving a 1967 Oldsmobile station wagon equipped with a frame-mounted trailer hitch. There was no damage to the occupant vehicle. He had experienced two previous rear-end impacts without neck injury but in cars without trailer hitches sustaining minor bumper and sheet-metal damage. The rigidity of the trailer hitch apparently resulted in higher occupant space acceleration and protected the vehicle from damage but did not protect the occupant from injury. METHODOLOGY FIRST-LEVEL DATA ACQUISITION - Police accident re- ports (Appendix A) of all rear-end impact accidents occurring within the city of Rochester were obtained for a three-month period beginning Jan. 17, 1972. All police reports were re- viewed by RAI investigators. and those accidents selected in which one vehicle was impacted between five and seven o'clock. (SAE J224a) by another vehicle. A special informa- tion form for rear-end impact accidents (Appendix B) was de- vised and the members of the Rochester Police Bureau were instructed in its use. The form was appended to routine acci- dent reports for rear-end impact accidents. SECOND-LEVEL DATA ACQUISITION - One to seven days after case pickup, vehicle occupants were contacted by tele- phone or postcard questionnaire (Appendixes C and D). THIRD-LEVEL DATA ACQUISITION - Approximately one out of 20 cases were randomly selected for vehicle analysis, which was performed by a two-man team. The rear-end im- pacted vehicle was examined and photographed to record ex- terior and interior damages. Pertinent measurements were taken and recorded on a special vehicle analysis form (Appen- dix E). All occupants contacted by telephone were asked to contact the medical office of the senior author for a medical examination and x-ray without cost to the occupant. A spe- cial medical history, physical examination, and x-ray form were devised and used for recording of these data (Appen- dix F). INJURY DETERMINATION - Whiplash injury was defined as any injury that caused neck pain and/or stiffness resulting in either disability as evidenced by loss of time at work or sig- nificant loss of ability to perform necessary activities of daily living or necessitating medical treatment such as medications, neck support, or physiotherapy. Excluded were injuries that did not cause significant disability and did not require treat- ment, although the patient may have visited a physician. Whiplash injury determinations were made on all levels of data acquisition. Police investigators necessarily could use only the criteria of neck pain and/or stiffness because dis- ability could not be evaluated at the accident scene. In sec- ond- and third-level data acquisition, treating physicians occa- sionally were called to corroborate or elaborate on patient statements. SPEED ESTIMATES - No attempt was made to obtain speed estimates in first- and second-level data because such estimates do not routinely appear on police accident report forms in Rochester. Additionally, the 5 mph increments necessary for analysis were considered beyond the expertise of police inves- tigators. Third-level estimates were made using photographs generously loaned by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety of experimental crash tests of 1972 vehicles that were impacted at speeds of 5, 10, 15 mph by the front ends of identical 1972 vehicles. RESULTS Six hundred and ninety-one accidents that met the study criteria occurred during the data collection period. Three hundred and sixty special information forms (62%) were filled out by police investigators, but not all forms were completed. Two hundred and ninety-seven (38%) occupants in impacted vehicles were contacted, 183 by telephone and 1 14 by mail. Twenty-two occupants received medical examinations, and 24 cars were examined in depth. Six hundred and nineteen accidents were two-vehicle colli- sions, and the remainder involved three or more vehicles (Ta- ble 1). A computer program designed to retrieve rear-end im- pact accidents from the Rochester Police Bureau accident case data bank revealed a total of 1371 accidents. Case-by-case analyses of these accidents revealed that the 1371 cases in-</page><page sequence="7">INJURY FREQUENCY IN REAR-END ACCIDENTS 2853 eluded a majority of accidents that did not fit the study cri- teria. Such accident configurations included side impacts on the rear half of the vehicle, impacts with parked cars, and backward-moving vehicle impacts with fixed objects and parked vehicles. INJURY FREQUENCY - Whiplash injury was the principal injury occurring in the struck vehicle (vehicle 2). Only three injuries (0.7%) other than whiplash occurred in the series. These were of a minor nature. Occupants of vehicle 2 sustained injury in 16.6% of the police-investigated accidents (level I). In contrast, level II data revealed an injury rate of 38% (Table 2). Symptoms of whip- lash injury were delayed in onset in a majority of the cases, accounting for the difference in frequency between level I and level II data. HEAD RESTRAINT EFFECTIVENESS - Head restraints were effective for both the driver and the right front seat occu- pant. The whiplash injury frequency (WIF) was 37% for head restraint-equipped vehicles and 43% for unequipped vehicles*. The beneficial effect was more noticeable for the female occu- pants (38% for head restraint-equipped positions versus 51% for unequipped positions). OTHER FACTORS IN WIF - The WIF for the center front and for all rear seat occupants was unusually low (22%), al- though none of the seats were equipped with head restraints. This may be explained by the fact that these seats were more often occupied by younger and smaller occupants whose necks would be protected by seat backs of standard height. *None of the level II data were found to be statistically sig- nificant. Sex was a significant factor in WIF. The overall WIF for fe- males was 44%, 51% for unequipped vehicles and 38% for equipped vehicles and seated positions. The female WIF ap- proached the male rate of 35% for head restraint-equipped vehicles and seated positions. Age, height, and weight did not exert a detectable influence on WIF nor on head restraint ef- fectiveness. Head restraint position did not have a statistically demon- strable effect on the WIF based on level I data. The sample size for data in these categories was small and precluded analy- sis. However, it was determined that 73% of the occupants did not elevate their adjustable head restraints, which were present in 72% of vehicles equipped with head restraints. The re- mainder of the vehicles had fixed head restraints. Occupants in seats with fixed head restraints appeared to receive additional protection, as evidenced by a WIF of 13% versus 16% overall rate and 21% for vehicles equipped with adjustable head re- straints. These percentages are based on level I data. Seat damage was noted in 13 vehicles (5%) of a sample of 279 vehicles examined by police investigators. Seat backs were bent backward in seven vehicles and pulled off the fore- aft adjustment tracks in six vehicles. This did not have an ap- parent effect on WIF (Table 3). Vehicle age, model, and make did not have a statistically significant effect on WIF based on level I data. Surprisingly, the highest WIF was 21% for 1971 model vehicles. This was higher than pre- 1969 vehicles, except for the 1963 group, which comprised only 22 out of a 691 vehicle sample. LEVEL III DATA - Level III data acquisition was limited be- cause of the limited capabilities of the research team, which was primarily concerned with level I and II data collection and the failure of occupants to submit to a medical examination.

D. STATES, ET AL. However, examination of 24 vehicles permitted speed esti- mates, which were made by comparing vehicle damage with an album of photographs of vehicles experimentally impacted at known speeds of 5, 10, and 15 mph (Table 4). Unfortunately, medical examinations were performed on only 22 occupants. None of these occupants were in the group of vehicles subjected to level III examination. This pre- cluded correlation of vehicle damage and injury severity. DISCUSSION The discrepancy in the number of rear-end impact accidents determined by hand-sorting to meet the study criteria of rear- end impacts and those derived from the computer program is a cause for concern. The Rochester Police Bureau uses the stan- dardized report form based on New York State Department of Motor Vehicle recommendations. These reports are the basis for state and national accident data compilation. This finding cast doubt on the reliability of rear-end impact accident analy- ses utilizing data derived from police accident reports similar to the Rochester Police Bureau form. The reliability of injury data derived from level I is doubtful because of the delayed onset of symptoms experienced by a majority of the whiplash-injured occupants. Although the symptom onset delay may appear suspect, it is a common find- ing in medical practice and is verified by level II data. There were insufficient level III cases to determine the significance of the immediate onset of symptoms. It was not established that these patients had more severe whiplash injury than those who experienced a delayed onset. The overall WIF determined by level II data compares favor- ably with O'Neill, et al., (29), who determined an incidence of 28% based on insurance claims. The difference can be ex- plained by the fact that not all injured occupants file insurance Table 4 - Impact Speeds- Level III Data Impact Speed No. Vehicles Up to 5 mph 1 0 6-10 mph 8 11-15 mph 4 16-20 mph 2 Table 5 - Whiplash Injury, Head Restraint, and Restraint System Use Whiplash Injury No. Injury No head restraint 6 6 Head restraint up 1 0 Head restraint midway 0 1 Head restraint down 3 3 Position unknown 2 1 Seat belt in use 4 0 Seat belt not in use 4 9 Unknown 4 1 claims. This is particularly true of vehicle occupants who are members of the vehicle owner's family. The head restraint's injury-reducing effect was determined to be 14% (37% WIF for equipped vehicles, 43% WIF for un- equipped vehicles). This is comparable to the findings made by O'Neill, et al., (29). Head restraint effectiveness is much less that can be anticipated because most occupants do not raise their head restraints, leaving them in the downmost posi- tion. Fixed head restraints appear to be more effective, but whiplash injury still occurred with this type of head restraint. Studies by States (20) and Lange (91) reveal a need for further research in head restraint design with respect to occupant kine- matics. Level III data revealed suggestive evidence that the use of lap belts may increase WIF (Table 5). This can be explained by the alteration in occupant kinematics imposed by the belt, which prevents the occupant's pelvis from moving forward and which would relieve hyperextension of the neck over the top of the seat or head restraint. CONCLUSIONS 1. Seventy-three percent of adjustable head restraints are left in the down position and not adjusted by users. 2. Head restraints reduce the frequency of whiplash injury by 14%. This disappointing finding is attributable in part to the failure of users to adjust their head restraints actively and to less than optimal head restraint design largely caused by in- adequate knowledge of human neck kinematics. 3. Fixed head restraints appear to be more effective than adjustable head restraints. 4. Women sustained whiplash injury more frequently than men (44% WIF versus 37% WIF for males). 5. Head restraints decreased WIF for women (51% to 38%) more than for men (40% to 35%). 6. Center and rear seat occupants have an unexpectedly low WIF (22%), possibly because children more often occupy these seated positions. 7. The overall WIF was 38%, 37% for head restraint- equipped seats and 43% for unequipped driver and right front seats. 8. The actual number of rear-end impacts meeting the study criteria was approximately half that retrieved by a computer program from an accident report data bank. Data derived from such computer programs should be used with suitable caution and constraints. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors are indebted to James C. Fell and Eugene E.
