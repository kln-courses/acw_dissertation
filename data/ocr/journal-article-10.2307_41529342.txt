<plain_text><page sequence="1">Paulinus of Nola and the Diction of Christian Latin Poetry In the course of her detailed and illuminating investigations of the ec- clesiastica loquendi consuetudo that obtained in the early Western church, Dr. Mohrmann has given evidence of an independent attitude on the part of the Christian poets ( 0. Words which had been rejected by most Christian prose writers by the end of the fourth century - in order to create a vocabulary unsullied by pagan connotations and one that was easily taught - were taken up by the poets. The dichotomy can be clearly seen in the two major works of Sedulius, who wrote, during the fifth century, a Carmen Paschale in verse and then paraphrased it closely in an Opus Paschale in prose. Dr. Mohrmann concludes that the poets scrupulously avoided any word that might destroy the illusion of classical poetry (a policy followed also by Claudian in his non- religious works), and so were led to reject the common and standard words of the faith. This article examines in detail the practice of Paulinus of Nola, a man of sensitive and independent feeling, who was steeped in classical learning by one of the greatest teachers of the time, but became disillusioned by the contemporary idea of the cultured life and turned in middle age to the monastic way of life. It is from his retirement - not entirely removed from outside influences - that all but a few lines of his extant poetry arose ; it was greater in quantity than previous writing and distinguished by its com- mon subjects and reflexion of the religious life. As pointers to the character of his work and diction the following twelve words are taken as significant : numen, genitor, sator, tonans, natus, suboles, unigena, spiramen, ara, uates, nuntius, Tartara . Numen in non-Christian writers can be said to have had two main sen- ses, connoting 'divine power' or the wielder of it, especially one of the less definitely conceived deities. The difference between these two senses was of- ten deliberately blurred by writers who preferred the hypothetical concept of a single deity to traditional expressions (e.g. Livy, 1.21.1, Ammianus, (1) Revue des Études Latines, 25 (1947), pp. 280-97, also found in Études sur le Latin des Chrétiens, 1.150-68.</page><page sequence="2">80 R. P. H. GREEN 19.1.4) or who took advantage of the term's vagueness to soften the roughness of certain anthropomorphic conceptions - two examples are Oviďs numinis ira and numinis onus accipit (of the boat that conveyed Asclepius, in Met., 15.693). The Christian poet Juvencus manipulated the word less delicately : he used numen of God engaged in the most explicitly expressed human relationships, for example, numen uidisse supernum (1.45), mater numinis alti (1.89), numine iussa (1.219). It is this use of numen to denote the Christian God, a use peculiar to the poets, that will be investigated here. Genitor was a word applied to Jupiter by virtue of his paternity of the other gods, but a few instances are quoted by Blaise-Chirat and the Thesaurus from Christian prose. In some of these another word is added : in Arnobius, 1.29, 2.15 we find fabricator and pater respectively, and in Filastrius, de Haeresibus, 127, pater. The reference in Maximinus ( contra Ambros ium, 101) occurs soon after the verb gigno, and those in ps.- Ambrose, Sermones e codice Sessoriano, 1. p. 114a, and Lactantius, In- stitutes, 4.25.3, also have this exact sense. These examples show the disfavour of the word as a synonym for deus, especially when we consider that Arnobius and the Sacramentaries - also quoted by Blaise-Chirat - are in various ways independent in their styles (2). On the other hand, it is found in the verse of Ausonius, Aratus, Hilary and Juvencus. Sa tor was used occasionally by Vergil and later poets in the sense of 'creator' ; Blaise-Chirat quote Arnobius only (1.34, sator ac conditor ; 2.45, fons rerum, sator saeculorum ac temporum ), apart from the poet Prudentius. Tonans, expressing an idea both pagan and Christian, was taken up by the Christian poets from their pagan counterparts. Both words occur in the Car- men Paschale of Sedulius (2.20 ; 1.27, 5.17, 5.72), but not in the Opus Paschale. Natus for 'son' was a common classical usage, and played an important part in the Aeneid in the formulaic phrase nate dea. As we should expect, the Christian poets made use of it because filius was metrically unsuitable in most cases. Suboles, favoured by the classical poets and used in the fourth Eclogue of Vergil (1.49), which became so popular with the Christians, does not seem to have become a common title for Christ. (Juvencus used it once, in 4.357). Unigena, formed like many adjectives in poetry (e.g. Troiugena) was probably a Christian invention. It is found in a hymn of Hilary, whereas Christian prose saw no reason to vary the credal unigenitus.

The Christians felt a strong preference for altare over ara, although the latter is found in Augustine, Sermones 318.1 and Ambrose, de uirginibus 1.11 .65, with altare or altaria nearby. For similar reasons they also rejected uates (in Ambrose, de Helia et ieiunio 6.18, Helisaeus uates is followed by and contrasted with filios prophetarum ), a word which recalled a process unworthy of the Jewish prophets, who were seen as prophets of Christ. Nuntius , well established at an early stage, yielded to angelus, which offered a less ambiguous image than the pre-existing word, which might indeed have still been felt as pagan, for a religious sense is present in Varro's quotation from the Censoriae Tabulae in de Lingua Latina 6.86, Plautus, Stichus 274 and Tibullus 2.1.26. The last word, Tartara , had a popularity rather greater than we might ex- pect ; it is found in Augustine and Jerome, without qualification, although after appearing four times in the Carmen Paschale (1.221, 3.337, 5.31 1, 5.428) it vanished from the Opus Paschale without trace except for tartarei in the rendering of 3.337. In Paulinus' writings of over 8,000 lines numen is used only four times in the sense which we are investigating : quamque exorabile numen (6.103) ; mens numine firma (10.187) (these phrases echo Juvenal 13.102 and Vergil, Aeneid, 8.78 respectively) ; iras numinis (22.1 17) ; numine agente (10.159). In these places it is essential to the argument that numen be un- derstood as the Christian God. The word occurs more frequently to connote the quality of divine in- fluence : it is ascribed explicitly to Christ in 14.1 19, 22.2, 16.172, 19.440, 27.508 ; to God in 15.145, 21.9 ; to Saint Felix in 14.29 ; to an altar in 19.400 ; to a cross in 19.686 ; to a feast day in 14.37 ; to pagan deities in 10.115, 19.17516. In 18.380-5 we find: ecce gerens duce numine mentem ... uenerat ... sponte quasi, non sponte tarnen, quia numinis actu egerat occultis Felix moderatus habenis. In the first of these lines numen is best taken as an abstract noun on the analogy of the phrases spe duce (31.216) and duce lege (27.630) ; in the second it is a mysterious power exerted by Felix. Genitor appears four times in Paulinus : in 20.39 and Epp. 292.16 - the latter of these is an inscription which Paulinus hoped to put up in a</page><page sequence="4">82 R- P. H. GREEN prominent place in the church at Fundi - it occurs in contexts describing the Trinity ; in 10.137 and 22.59 Paulinus offers no explanation to his correspondents, except in so far as summus in the former distinguished Paulinus' heavenly father from Ausonius who assumed the title (3). Sator occurs, followed by mundi, at 10.50, 29.19; with summus, at 17.164 ; with hominum, at 19.307 ; with deus, at 31.485. Tonans is found only at 22.149. The noun natus is found in two passages about the Trinity (21.697, 6.3), and in 6.317 and 31.84. Although Juvencus had used the word even in the nominative case, where filius would have been metrically possible, (e.g. 2.216, 2.555), Paulinus uses filius ten times, including six times in the natalicia. Suboles is found at 22.135, and of the unborn Christ at 6.139 ; unigena at 27.93. Spiramen occurs three times, but only once as a title of the Holy Spirit - in 22.42, where man is said to have been made limo et spiramine sancto, a reference to the beginning of Genesis, in which con- temporary commentators believed the Holy Spirit to be active. In 27.99 and 29.7 spiramen is used in the sense of 'breath' or 'inspiration'. Ära occurs in three descriptions of heaven (Epp. 281.22, 27.208, 31.550), but only once in the literal sense of 'altar', and then of a Jewish altar (6.39). There are as many as seventeen occurrences of altare or altaría. Vates occurs at 6.165, 6.308, 6.146, 17.133, 24.205, 31.369, 31.395, and appears to be excluded from the natalicia, unlike the com- moner propheta. No distinction in the sense or reference of the two words can be detected. Nuntius is not found outside poem 6, where it occurs twice (39,90) ; angelus occurs five times (thrice in natalicia) and angelicus eleven times. Tartara occurs once in a natalicium (21.542, with infernum in the previous line), and thrice elsewhere (6.246, 31.103, 31.333). The noun in- fernum occurs in two other places (16.154, 21.227), and the adjective in- fernus is common in paraphrases such as infemis tenebris (15.140). Certain of these words, then, appear to have been totally excluded from the natalicia, namely tonans, suboles, spiramen, ara, (in its literal sense), uates, nuntius, numen (in our second sense) ; the others are rare and are found with an explanation in the immediate context : genitor, sator, natus, unigena, Tartara. On the other hand, the natalicia are liberally sprinkled with the commonest Christian words, of which only a few can be adduced here. In addition to those already mentioned as synonyms of the 'poetic' (3) Ausonius, Ep. 28.6 ; 28.32 (Peiper's edition).</page><page sequence="5">PAULINUS OF NOLA AND CHRISTIAN LATIN POETRY 83 words, we can note ecclesia , which is very common and never apparently avoided ( adytum is used by Paulinus, as by Juvencus (1.10), of an inner shrine (18.324, 28.187, 31.342)); episcopus occurs thrice in natalicia, euangelium thrice, and its adjective five times ; apostolus once, and its ad- jective nine times. Martyr is also very common, and when it is replaced by testis (14.22, 21.139), explanation is added. Oro occurs ten times, and the frequency of other words for prayer is similar. Why should Paulinus keep more strictly to conventional ecclesiastical diction and avoid the preferences of other poets in his natalicia ? The an- swer lies in the nature of the audience before whom the poems were read. Paulinus addresses them familiarly (16.17, 18.21 1, 19.383) and appeals to their knowledge of some of the events he describes (19.383, 402 ; 23.82, 111). They must have been numerous, even when we allow for the exaggeration of poem 14 (his most Vergilian work), and many were wor- shippers of Venus and Bacchus (27.549, 19.169). His poems were meant to serve the same purpose as his illustrations of scriptural stories on the church walls : the instruction of the simple (27.540 ff.). This explains the com- parative simplicity of his narrative style and his frequent didactic digressions ; the complexity of the natalicia is syntactical, arising out of the didactic motive. There are no allusive periphrases such as ueteris prophetae (17.29) or profugus Tharsum uates (22.105), and echoes of the classical poets are on the whole channeled into certain contexts. Is there any evidence of a contrary inclination in the other poems to ban the more usual manifestations of the Christian sermo humilis ? These were addressed to individuals of similar standing and inclinations, apart from poem 6, an early essay (4) and 7, 8 and 9, paraphrases of Psalms. Poems 24 and 31 abound in catenas of scriptural quotations, usually reproduced as faithfully as possible ; poem 25, an epithalamium, anticipates the service and uses such words as ecclesia (167, 197), baptisma (185), episcopus (199), apostolicus (218) ; poem 17 includes the word monachus (17.219), angelus (17.226, 154) and such stanzas as: interit casu Satanae uicissim inu idus Cain, rediuiuus Abel pascit effusi pretio redemptos sanguinis agnos. (233-6). (4) As Paulinus implies in line 175. For the chronology of his writings, see P. Fabre, Chronologie de l'œuvre de Paulin de Noie, Paris, 1949.</page><page sequence="6">84 R. P. H. GREEN The inscriptions enclosed in letter 32 (5) illustrate Christian beliefs with no avoidance of common words, although the complexity of their symbolism appeals to a more sophisticated taste than the natalicia ; and the protrep • ticus to Licentius in letter 8 (6) centres on a Biblical quotation (11.27/8) and does not exclude Christian terms, although they are less frequent, and classical echoes more common, than usual. There remain three poems, to which we found nine of the twelve words to be restricted. Poem 22 contains common Christian words such as pro - pheta (102, 114) ; euangelicae (155) and caro (71), but also numen , ge- nitor, tonans, suboles, spiramen. The appearance of these 'poetic' words can be explained by the character of the recipient and the purpose of the poem. It was a protrepticus by which Paulinus hoped to wean the poet Jovius from mythological to scriptural themes. While not ashamed to use Christian language - for Jovius was a Christian, albeit one with in- tellectual difficulties, to which Paulinus addressed himself in letter 16 (7) - Paulinus was eager to give Jovius a glimpse of new horizons and not restrict his vocabulary. This is illustrated by the striking paraphrase of the first words of John's Gospel in 11.54/5: principio uerbum, inquit, erat ; deus obside uerbo gau debat uerbumque dei simul et deus idem uerbum erat. Poem 10 was written to Ausonius to explain Paulinus' new way of life. Ausonius' poems suggest that he was a Christian who chose not to repudiate Rome's traditional religion ; but his letters to Paulinus show little understanding of Paulinus' motivation, and when he prays to the Father and Son (8) it is in reply to Paulinus' injunction to rely on them and not the Muses (9). Paulinus selects simple, but vivid terms. Spes, fides (169) and diffidentia (324) could be understood easily; sub nomine (186) occurs rather than in nomine ; participantum (156) expresses the monastic ideal ; God is rex (1 18, 287, 314, with an adjective each time), and exercises im- périum (168, 280). There is one notable passage in which Christ is praised in a medley of terms only partly scriptural (44-50) but this occurs in the iambics which precede the brunt of Paulinus' argument. In the shorter Poem 1 1 the notions of saeculum (50), career (57), axis (59) are all pagan as well as Christian. (5) Pp. 277-293 of C.S.E.L. Vol. 29. (6) Ibid., pp. 48-52. (7) Ibid., pp. 114 ff.

He clearly felt no need to restrict himself, even in a work that was Vergilian in many respects, such as its phraseology and tricóla. This combination of classical form and sermo humilis is characteristic of all Paulinus' poetry, a novel recipe for didactic writing in which the ingredients were mixed not according to convention or personal taste but according to the various needs of their recipients.
