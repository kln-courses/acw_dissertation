Weber gives several striking examples, unsystemat- ically arranged. Besides the rational organization of national administra- tions and the rational, capitalistic organization of nominally free labor, Weber emphazises above all the rational structure of law, the existence of an expertly trained stratum of jurists, and the emergence of a rational, "methodical way of life." Among these cultural manifestations he postu- lated relationships for which he reserved the Goethean term, "elective af- finities. "2 We shall also be concerned in what follows with "elective affinities," this time, however, between those subject areas where one must not at first sight presume there to be an adequacy relation either. Thus we are in- terested in the question of whether there are certain "inner" parallels, that are not purely coincidental, between the explanatory model that We- ber reserves for the religious rationalization process and that explanatory model that he applies to the legal rationalization process. Weber frequently uses the term "elective affinity" in the sense of a topos; and since topoi often lie near the boundary between linguistic dic- tion (Sprachlichkeit) and figurativeness (Bildlichkeit) they become clear to the reader above all because of their figurativeness. The use of topoi, Technische Universitdt Hannover, West Germany.</page><page sequence="2">810 however, is also due to the fact that, as linguistically fixed "abbrevia- tions," they represent a relatively clearly defined stock of concepts, points of view, and theses. This is a stock that has, for example, come into existence in the course of scientific studies, and that, as a result of these studies, must be regarded as relatively "secure." If one looks at it this way, Weber's use of the term "elective affinities" appears to be an "abbreviation" for certain methodological principles, which, however, he did not always observe. Thus the topos "elective affinities" usually calls to mind contents and meanings moulded by common-sense (parallelism, correspondence) and appears as the "padding" within a train of thought with a large number of gaps. In addition, there is a large number of places in the text that seem to point to an extremely arbitrary usage of the term "elective affinities."3 The significance of the term "elective affinities" as a serious "abbrevia- tion" for some of Weber's methodological considerations is revealed above all through the investigatory stages that formed the basis for the Protestantism study.4 1. Weber presumes a connection between the individual characteristics of modern capitalism and a specific conviction concerning economic ethics (vocational ethics) that is mainly based on "ascetic Protestan- tism.' 2. The connection is specified by his dealing with "reality" on the basis of value-related abstractions and syntheses - ideal types5 - by the construction of an adequacy relation: in this case the meaningful cor- respondence (sinnhafte Entsprechung) "that exists between capitalis- tic economic action and the practical maxims of Protestant economic ethics in its individual forms."6 Here it is by no means implied that the inner correspondence that has been intellectually constructed "is necessary even in the majority or the average of the cases.";7 i.e. the intellectually constructed possibility of an "inner correspondence" may not be made into the principle of the explanation. It is only a "preliminary step" to this: adequacy relations thus constitute a com- plex of subjective meaning (Sinnzusammenhang), a unity between "constituent parts" of reality viewed in isolation to which the researcher attributed significance; at the same time they also make the "general direction"8 clear, within which a causality is to be thought within this intellectually constructed unity. However, this must first be separately "tested" with the aid of the "uncertain means" of the "intellectual experiment."</page><page sequence="3">811 3. This "test" consists of the logical operation of "causal attribution" (kausale Zurechnung).9 It operates in such a way that "of the actual causal components of the course we think one or some in a particular direction and in a changed form, and ask ourselves whether, under the conditions of the process that have been changed in this way, the (as regards the "essential" points) same success or what other success would 'have been to be expected.' "10 The causal attribution thus makes use of objective possibility judgments' on the basis of "nomo- logical knowledge." It constructs an unreal course in order to com- prehend the actual causal connection. 12 In addition to the comparison with the intellectually constructed possible success, whose causal ex- planation is in question, there is thus the comparison with the "actual success," which, in the example of the study of Protestantism used here, is additionally supported by the proof of temporal priority. 3 "Elective affinity" thus assumes the function of a scheme of interpreta- tion; it stands for an intellectual construct for producing easily compre- hensible connections, which are to be changed into causal relations if possible. In our example, this means that first an "inner correspon- dence" is produced by means of the "common denominator" of the methodical (rational) way of life between the economic rationalism of modern capitalism and the rational ethics of ascetic Protestantism. This adequacy at the level of meaning (sinnhaft addquat) is then conceived as a causal relation14 and tested. "Elective affinities" are thus produced as affinity as regards content be- tween phenomena that are processed into ideal types. "With this kind of hermeneutic adequacy" we are dealing with "similarities between characteristics that are found in two subject complexes that can be sepa- rated sufficiently from one another (hermeneutic: "individualizable") and which cannot be substituted by each other"15. This means that the characteristics belong together in an immediate relation that cannot be explained through a third factor!6 However correct it may be, on the one hand, to trace the term "elective affinity" back to Goethe,17 it is, on the other hand, misleading to make use of Goethe's meaning of the term (the assumption of a kind of "compulsion" that divides couples and creates reciprocal new relationships) to interpret the term as used by Weber. 18 In his "Anticritical Last Word on the Spirit of Capitalism," Weber himself provides a graphic example of the way he wants the term "elective affini- ty" understood - an example that has not received attention so far. In this contribution, Weber undertakes the task of "drawing a parallel in essentials"19 between Catholic monastic asceticism and Protestant</page><page sequence="4">812 asceticism. Here it must be remembered that the ascetic way of life (of both kinds) Weber refers to is not subjective acquisition by single in- dividuals, but rather "a form of attitude held by groups of people";20 this means that the significance of propagating strata (Trdgerschichten) also becomes clear here (see Table 1).

"21 "Elective affinity" is "affinity of essence" and it can be graded in steps.22 It is in precisely the sense of "drawing a parallel in essentials" that the following is to ascertain the "elective affinity" between the two explana- tory models that Weber employs for his analysis of the religious and legal rationalization process. First evidence for such an "elective affinity" is found in the great em- phasis that Weber placed on the significance of propagating strata (Trigerschichten) in both bodies of work, a perspective that recurs in his sociology of domination.23 In his Sociology of Law, for example, he writes: We shall see that a body of law can be rationalized in various ways and by no means necessarily in the direction of the development of its "juristic" qualities. The direction in which these formal qualities develop is, however, conditioned directly by "intrajuris- tic" conditions: the particular character of the individuals who are in a position to in- fluence by virtue of their profession the ways in which the law is shaped. Only indirectly is this development influenced, however, by general economic and social conditions.24 The parallel perspective that Weber adopts in his Sociology of Religion can be inferred from the following passage: "The destiny of religions has been influenced in a most comprehensive way by intellectualism and its various relationships to the priesthood and political authorities. These relationships were in turn influenced by the provenience of the stratum which happened to be the most important carrier of the particular in- tellectualism"; by intellectualism Weber understood "the metaphysical needs of the human mind as it is driven to reflect on ethical and religious questions, driven not by material need but by an inner compulsion to un- derstand the world as a meaningful cosmos and to take a position toward it. "25 This first evidence of an "elective affinity" is substantiated by the history of Weber's work and ideas,26 through which the assumption seems to be justified that the studies (in the sense of the setting down of results in writing) of the central sections of the sociology of law and religion were written very close to each other. If one leaves aside the inevitable prelimi- nary work, then they were written between 1911 and 1913. Thus the search for "elective affinities" does not appear to be pointless.</page><page sequence="6">814 The search aims at a comparison between the explanatory models that can be identified in the sociology of religion and of law. Because law and religion are distinguishable partial orders of social formations, it is not obvious that the rationalization processes there are "subjected" to an identical explanatory model. Because Weber nowhere made explicit the explanatory models he preferred in the sociology of law and of religion, it is necessary first to identify those explanatory levels on which Weber's ideal-typical developmental constructions are based, and then to deter- mine the relations of the relevant explanatory levels to each other. This demands an intermediate step that impairs the inner unity of the paper and that is responsible for its length. This intermediate step, which we regard as necessary, undertakes the task of outlining the reconstructions of the religious (chapter 2) and legal rationalization process (chapter 3) put forward by Weber. It has the sole purpose of revealing the relevant explanatory models by using substantive analyses of the two rationaliza- tion processes. This intermediate step of analysis reveals that Weber operated with three levels of explanation - his three-level model - that includes (1) the propagating strata, (2) the political conditions obtaining, and (3) the economic conditions obtaining, in order of explanatory potential. Specific combinations or constellations of factors on the first two ex- planatory levels that created "relationships of tension" were held largely responsible - despite the open-endedness of rationalization processes per se - for the direction eventually taken by the process of legal or religious rationalization. The dominance of the first two explanatory levels be- comes immediately clear because propagating strata are embedded in or- der configurations; the effect of the third explanatory level, which is to a large extent indirect, is at first sight surprising, but it has something to do with the fact that - at least for the developmental levels of Primi- tive civilization and Archaic and historical civilization - the economy is "embedded" in the political structures (Polanyi), insofar as these have become differentiated (cf. Excursus below). This way of doing things is also suitable because the process-like aspect of the (increasing) rationalization of religion and law must also be reflected in the explanatory model that is to be revealed: as a "stage mod- el" with clearly distinguishable developmental stages according to the degree of disenchantment and to the degree of systematization and with the tendency to flip over into the irrational (a manifestation of the "para- doxical consequences" of historical developments that Weber continual- ly emphasized).</page><page sequence="7">815 The dynamics of rationalization in the religious sphere point to the con- sistent work27 on the theodicy problem, which is subject to the principle of what he called the "inherent laws governing (actualized) ideas" and which points up Weber's view that (religious) ideas were relatively in- dependent. Religious rationalization, which is also connected with the consistent development of the theodicy problem, thus pursues a "mini- mal program of evolutionary theory" (Seyfarth) - an approach that is unusual for Weber.28 This marks the decisive difference between that body of work and Weber's developmental reconstruction of the legal ra- tionalization process, whose dynamics, he believed, resulted from a di- alectical tension between formal and substantive rationality (see Table 2). The intermediate step that is regarded as necessary is illustrated in a rough outline both of the religious rationalization process (ch.2) and the legal one (ch.3). The outlines are presented one after the other,29 because the revelation of each explanatory model is to take place independently, TABLE 2 Religion and Law Characteristics Elective affinity between Explanatory Explanatory model I &amp; model II (religion) (law) I.

The attempts at reconstruction that are presented with the two outlines first have to be "reconstructed" themselves; this applies, above all, to the sociology of law, but also to the sociology of religion, because an interpretation that is devoted solely to the "Introduction" and "Intermediate Reflections," as is undertaken by Tenbruck,30 overlooks the idea of "attributing a dual role" to the "Introduction" and "Intermediate Reflections" - an idea that is clearly suggested by a systematic analysis of the history of Weber's work. "In it both the first results of former specialist research and the reference framework for future research are formulated.""3 This means, however, that "Economy and Society" and "The Economic Ethics of the World Religions" (Introduction, Intermediate Reflections) are in a com- plementary and interpretive relation to each other,32 a circumstance to which the attempts at reconstruction presented here are indebted. Apart from this, the method of procedure sketched out here has the advantage that the thoughts put forward regarding the elective affinity thesis can be followed and checked by those readers who do not consider them- selves to be experts on Weber. But even for the latter, the path that has been taken ought not to be completely without interest, because the few attempts at reconstruction presented by interpreters of Weber mainly outline the religious rationalization process in the light of specific cogni- tive interests. If the elective affinity thesis should prove true, then this would mean, among other things, that access to the sociology of law would have to take place via the sociology of religion. This very unusual approach pro- vides the explanatory model used in the sociology of religion with an ex- emplary function; not only because Weber worked at the sociology of religion until the end of his life and because a "coherence of fundamen- tal ideas" becomes visible in the three sections of the "Author's In- troduction," "Introduction," and "Intermediate Reflections," but, above all, because this explanatory model is more "complete" within itself, par- ticularly due to its dependence on considerations of evolutionary theory. The result is that the concept of propagating strata, which also has con- siderable significance in the sociology of law, is more systematically es- tablished, which is illustrated by the fact that approaches to a theory of professionalization33 take it as their starting point. From this point of view, "priests" and Western legal experts (Fachjuristen) can be consid- ered to be prototypes of "professionals" who have an ambivalent rela- tionship to the process of (increasing) rationalization: on the one hand it has produced them, and on the other they have had an influence on it.</page><page sequence="9">817 On Weber's Reconstruction of the Religious Rationalization Process Weber's "Minimal Program of Evolutionary Theory" Weber conceived the process of religious rationalization as two inter- related processes: one of increasing disenchantment and one of increas- ing systematization of belief resulting from the need felt by civilized men "... to understand the world as a meaningful cosmos and to take up a position toward it."34 To judge the level of rationalization a religion represents we may use two primary yard- sticks which are in many ways interrelated. One is the degree to which the religion has divested itself of magic; the other is the degree to which it has systematically unified the relation between God and the world and therewith its own ethical relationship to the world.35 On the connection between disenchantment and systematization, Weber wrote elsewhere: The intellectual seeks in various ways, the casuistry of which extends into infinity, to endow his life with a pervasive meaning, and thus to find unity with himself, with his fellow men, and with the cosmos. It is the intellectual who conceives of the "world" as a problem of meaning. As intellectualism suppresses a belief in magic, the world's processes become disenchanted, lose their magical significance, and henceforth simply "are" and "happen" but no longer signify anything. As a consequence, there is a grow- ing demand that the world and the total pattern of life be subject to an order that is significant and meaningful."34 Before we proceed to reconstruct the "minimal program of evolutionary theory" (Seyfarth),37 which Weber applied to the religious rationaliza- tion process, let us turn to his work for a definition of "intellectualiza- tion" or disenchantment: The increasing intellectualization and rationalization do not, therefore, indicate an in- creased and general knowledge of the conditions under which one lives... It means something else, namely, the knowledge or belief that if one but wished one could learn it at any time. Hence, it means that principally there are no mysterious incalculable forces that come into play, but rather that one can, in principle, master all things by calculation. This means that the world is disenchanted.38 Implied here as well is the gap between Weber's "cultivated" or civilized man and the specialist; between those who attempt to understand the universe as a meaningful cosmos and those who believe that it can be grasped and mastered by technical means. Weber's limited evolutionary view of the process of religious rationaliza- tion amounts to a theory of rationalization stages39 with the stages or</page><page sequence="10">818 developmental plateaus being classified, first, by degree of systematic unity of their world view and, second, by the degree of its magical con- tent.40 Religious world views are subject to an "inner compulsion to ra- tionalize" not only in the sense that they represent comprehensive and unified attempts to explain the universe - a "reducing to principles,"41 and systematization of beliefs, which implies following given meanings and values out to their logical ends.42 Such world views must simultane- ously conform to the need to rationalize that arises from the notion of theodicy, that ancient question that has always troubled mankind as to the incongruence of fate and human merit. The rational compulsion, to which religions have to accede, derives from the need to possess a rational answer to the problem of theodicy. The stages of religious advance are the more and more articulated conceptions of this problem and its solution.43 In terms of world view and theodicy, each stage of religious rationaliza- tion brings with it certain consequences for practical behavior, which in turn is subject to a process of rationalization.44 The systematization of cosmologies and theodicies is bound up with a systematization of action - at least in the West, whose development is characterized by a growing methodization, as Weber called it, of life styles.45 In any case, elective affinities exist between certain images of the world and projected solu- tions of the theodicy problem and certain paths or means to redemption, and these in turn have always been strongly influenced by the social situ- ation of the predominant strata that advance them.46 The further rationalization progresses, the more difficult it becomes to frame comprehensive and unified world views and to find satisfying an- swers to the problem of theodicy. This process indeed takes a highly complex course, being doubly subject to the "law" that the effects of an idea or action are often quite opposite to those intended. To the same degree as world views (and concomitant solutions to the theodicy prob- lem) are rationalized, religion tends to grow irrational,47 at least from the standpoint of rationally formulated views of the world and theodicies. Furthermore, the more effort socially privileged intellectual strata invest in rationalizing these problems, the more difficult it becomes for them to satisfy their elementary human desire to seek meaning and to under- stand the universe as a "meaningful cosmos." The process of religious rationalization should not be reduced to a mere phase in the history of ideas. Genesis and acceptance of projected world views and theodicies are always dependent, among other factors, on the stratum that advances them - on its social constitution and particularly</page><page sequence="11">819 on its position in the social order. Among the determinants of the social position of this promulgating stratum are "whether it addresses problems of internal need or external want, whether it is supported by monks, priests, or laymen, whether these come from positively or negatively privileged strata, and whether it is politically disenfranchised or must face the competition of ethical prophets."48 The link between religious rationalization, which conforms to an inher- ent dynamic, and the strata that effect the rationalization process is a complex one. Weber rejected the hypothesis that a world view or theodicy could be understood as a mere function of the social position of its promulgators. Rather, he saw the problem in terms of reciprocal effect: not only do these strata rationalize religion but existing conceptions of the universe also shape their material and ideal interests: Interests, material as well as ideal, not ideas directly control action. But world images, which are the product of ideas, have often served as the channels along which action is moved by the dynamics of interests. After all, it is in response to an image of cosmo- logical order whence the question arises from what and towards what one needs to be saved.49 Thus to Weber, world views and theodicies were not simply a function of the social position of those who advanced them. He countenanced a (vulgarly) materialistic explanation just as little as "spiritualist" doc- trines that cite the "subversive force of ideas.' What he did suggest here was that the causal chain of ideas leading to interests should be sup- plemented by the reverse - an investigation of the sociogenesis of ideas (and norms). Schluchter was not mistaken when he wrote that We cannot attribute a priori primacy to either class of causes. We must assume that both originated at the same time. When human beings began to interpret their interests, they postulated the possible autonomy of interests and ideas. This assumption of the simultaneous genesis of interests and ideas permits Weber to state at the end of The Protestant Ethic that the materialist and spiritualist interpretations of history are "equally possible." However, for the same reason, he also says that each interpretation, "if it serves not as the preparation, but as the conclusion of an investigation, accom- plishes equally little in the interest of historical truth.50 Weber's limited evolutionary theory begins to coalesce when we divide the process of religious rationalization into the stages he outlined in the "Introduction."51 He distinguished four developmental stages: a magic level, the level of salvation cults, that of prophecy (where "channels were determined"), and the level of ethical religions of salvation. On the first level a magic world view predominates. What appear to be simple abstractions are conceived that, however, contain in embryo fur-</page><page sequence="12">820 ther and more logical abstractions (e.g., the notion of supernatural pow- ers that can intervene our lives). A belief in spirits and animistic notions are two of these abstractions that as Weber says, only appear to be sim- ple.52 Toward the end of this stage the highest form of abstraction even- tually emerges - the notion that there is a world behind or beyond the world of things and events, a realm populated by souls, demons, and gods that is accessible via the intermediaries of symbols and sig- nificances.53 This notion of the world as an "enchanted garden:' howev- er, does not lead to a radical separation of this world from the world be- yond.54 This monistic world view is characterized by a "straight-forward attitude to suffering, in which the sufferer is considered to have been struck down by an angry god or possessed by a demon."55 By searching for expe- riences and states (charisma) that transcend the everyday, people at this magic stage attempt to escape temporarily from this world of pain and injustice and in so doing to master it. On this level, it is the means of magic by which a supramundane state can be evoked (a dimension of means to salvation).56 By performing magical and ritual acts, the de- mons and "mythical beings" may be placated or "bribed." This is a question of success, as Weber writes: "Whoever possesses the requisite charisma for employing the proper means is stronger even than the god, whom he can compel to do his will."57 This "coercion of the gods" re- quires no priests, no religious organization, no congregation, and hence no cult; concomitantly, worship and sacrifice are also unknown on this level. Cults of salvation, Weber believed, marked a qualitatively new stage. Though their world view was still basically monistic, they bore within them the seeds of a dualistic philosophy with its tendency to exalt the occult world above the real world. The developmental factor inherent in this change of world view was the notion, characteristic of this level, that realms existed within this one world over which gods reigned. As mythi- cal beings gradually took on the contours of gods, the division between gods and men, between the Beyond and the Here and Now, grew sharper. And "Because the division is sharper the need for a communication sys- tem through which gods and men can interact is much more acute."58 This function was performed by the religious cult, a special form of wor- ship with its characteristic traits of prayer and sacrifice. Thus the emer- gence of true cults was the defining factor of this stage of development, and, indeed, gave it its name. The ongoing nature of this form of wor- ship also helped insure the continuity of the deities worshipped, which</page><page sequence="13">821 in turn increased the chance that these complexes of ideas would be sys- tematized. The principal objects of such attempts at systematization were the relations of supernatural beings to one another. With the emergence of cults, the chance also increased that functionaries - priests - would establish themselves to organize the ongoing business of influencing the gods. As they took advantage of their opportunity, the priest-functionaries began to perform the characteristic task of deter- mining what factors were to be blamed for human suffering and of giv- ing advice on how to alleviate it by certain actions.59 If the priesthood determined that ritual commandments had been broken, as a rule they advised conformance to ritual and prayer or sacrifice in order to placate the gods and avoid their wrath - in the sense of a do ut des. This anticipated the next step in the development of religions of salva- tion, the transition from ritual to ethical demands as the condition of redemption. This development arose from the altered view that "the ex- perience of suffering was not simply tolerated or ordained by gods who might be placated by precautionary sacrifice, but represented a well- earned punishment for breaking the fundamental commandments of a personal deity. This would mark the beginnings of an ethical religion - the next step...."60 One important condition for this development, as suggested above, was a systematization of conceptions of deity. This was furthered, among other things, by the priest-functionaries conducting "a regularly or- ganized and permanent enterprise concerned with influencing the gods"60 and possessing "rational training," specialized knowledge, and a fixed doctrine. The motor of this development was the formation of a pantheon, a rationalization of the magic realm of spirits and deities. This entailed a specialization of the gods: their spheres of action were limited; they assumed anthropomorphic shape and were personalized; and finally they were arranged in a hierarchy.62 All these changes, in turn, brought about an ever-increasing rationalization of the manner of worship or conception of deity per se. This topic deserves discussion in more detail. Weber's reconstruction of the development of conceptions of god in the Middle and Far East is of interest in this connection because it illustrates the interpretive model he favored in his sociologies of religion and law.</page><page sequence="14">822 Excursus: Reconstruction of Middle and Far Eastern Conceptions of God on the "Three-level Model" A digression on this point would seem useful, because Weber demon- strated the advantages of his three-level model by means of a concrete example - the differential development of the Middle and Far Eastern conceptions of god from similar initial premises. Weber believed that three complexes of variables - (1) the social position of the propagating strata, (2) political and military conditions, and (3) economic conditions, in that order - were decisive for the circumstance "that out of the notion of a King of Heaven there developed in China the notion of an imper- sonal god, but in Israel that of a personal deity; and that in China the relation of this heavenly power to the world was conceived as harmoni- ous while in Israel it was conflict-ridden."63 The idea of a King of Heaven was widespread both in China and the Middle East, which led Weber to state: "the contrast between the Middle and Far Eastern con- ceptions of deity was by no means sharp from the beginning."64 The Middle Eastern, or more precisely the ancient Israelite, conception of deity involved the key notion that God was responsible for bringing rain - a god of irrigation. Wherever chronic lack of water was a problem, as in the arid and semiarid regions of the Near East,65 heavenly spirits or deities supplanted chthonic deities,66 thanks to the belief that "the gods of the mountains and rivulets rule the world because rain comes from the mountains."67 But wherever, as in Egypt, Mesopotamia, and China, the problem of water supply was solved with the aid of artificial irrigation systems elaborated by a powerful administration68 to which the ruler owed much of his despotic power, this circumstance encouraged "the conception of a god who had created the earth and man out of nothingness and not procreated them, as was believed elsewhere. After all, the king's irrigation produced a harvest out of nothingness, too - out of the desert sand."69 This allows Weber to conclude: "The god of the Middle East was fashioned on the model of the King."70 The significance that Weber attached to geographic and ecological fac- tors is revealed even more clearly by his distinction between inland (ripar- ian) and coastal cultures. The geographic and ecological term "coastal culture" of course implies the ancient Mediterranean system of trade and relations, which is quite comparable to the model that M. Malowist71 de- veloped to describe the seaboard civilization of the Baltic Sea region and on which Wallerstein72 based his conception of a "world system."</page><page sequence="15">823 Despite their similar initial situations, the Middle East and Far East (China) developed the two quite different conceptions of deity described above. According to Weber, this difference was due primarily to the different political and military conditions obtaining in the two regions. Thus the special political situation of ancient Israel, a small state sur- rounded by belligerent empires, a region of unabated conflict and unrest, encouraged the development of the Lord of Heaven into a supramun- dane god of war. Jahwe, orginally "a mountain deity of storms and natu- ral catastrophes," who as "a God of the extraordinary, that is, of the des- tiny of his people in war" made foreign affairs his main concern, "could only become a 'world God' as a supramundane ruler of destiny" because "his people could not create a world empire of their own and remained a small state in the midst of world powers to which they finally suc- cumbed."73 This worldly god then chose Israel of his own accord (as Jahwe had been freely elected by "his" people) and entered a covenant with the Israelites. The special character of this "contractual relation" gave rise to a propensity to "conceive religious acts in ethical terms."74 By contrast, the particular political situation of China after the third cen- tury B.C., its development into a peaceful empire, encouraged a concep- tion that raised the King of Heaven to a supradivine and impersonal power and guarantor of heavenly order.75 The fact that Jahwe was con- ceived not as a god of the "everlasting order of nature" but as a god of natural catastrophes who eventually, as a god of historical action, inter- vened in the events of this world, was not exclusively attributable to the political conditions obtaining. Nor was it only "a result of a concrete historic event - the formation of a confederacy."76 It was also, and for Weber primarily, the achievement of those various promulgating strata who determined the direction taken by their religious attitude to the world, out of a need to find its meaning in the face of concrete political and often irrational experiences. Significant, in other words, were the achievements in terms of reception and structuring of those strata that as cultural agents steered religious developments and altered the social situation in which they found themselves. If in ancient Israel it was the priesthood, (ethical) prophets, and scribes77 who promoted this recep- tion and structuring - the contractual relation between God and the Chosen People (berith) being the specific achievement of these "sacred elites,"78 in China it was primarily apolitical intellectuals whose class ethic - almost congruent with Confucian ethic, which advocated a "ra- tionalism of order"79 - required them to polish the art of creating and maintaining harmony. In Israel, the primeval notion of a King of Heaven became a supramundane, personal Creator; in China an impersonal god</page><page sequence="16">824 of an eternal order: "a supradivine, impersonal, forever identical and eternal existence was felt to be the ultimate and supreme. This was to sanction the validity of eternal order and its timeless existence."80 Thus Weber operated with three levels of explanation, each of which was extremely complex. He employed (1) the propagating strata, including their patterns of religious interpretation and constructs in the area of traditional, "projected theodices"; (2) particular constellations on the level of political conditions obtaining; and (3) structural conditions (in- cluding geographical and ecological conditions) on the level of economic conditions obtaining. It is striking how often he emphasized the sig- nificance of the propagating strata and political conditions81 to explain the emergence of those conceptions of deity eventually, starting from similar premises, diverged in the Middle and Far East. The explanatory value of economic conditions was by comparison low. Their influence was only of an indirect nature, since even these highly developed cultures largely retained the system of "domestic production" which came with the Neolithic revolution, at the most allowing a "politi- cal apparatus" to separate from family and religious structures in which the economy remained "embedded" (Polanyi). In the example under dis- cussion here, political conditions take on explanatory value because the geographic and ecological situation - desert land in need of irrigation - made the formation of a bureaucracy necessary to deal with it. Hence, political conditions,82 which would rightly include the existence or non- existence of urban civilization, go far toward explaining the rationaliza- tion process here. Indeed politics, especially in Israel's case, comprised experiences that were religiously interpreted with the aid of existing or traditional ideas, in the sense of "projected meanings" which had hither- to satisfied the human need to find a meaning in the cosmos. However, as Schluchter83 points out, the solutions offered were not determined by the social problems as perceived, nor by traditional notions about the world. Rather, both current problems and inherited ideas were linked by means of specific "reception and construction achievements" which in turn were dependent on the character - habits of mind, training, and so- cial station - of the strata which typically produced and "administrated" these achievements. From Ritual to Ethical Religions of Salvation and Increasing Ration- alization in the Context of the "Three-level Model" It was the emergence of ethical prophecy84 that sparked the transition to</page><page sequence="17">825 the next stage of development, the stage of ethical religion. If in priesthood-oriented religions what counted for salvation was observance of ritual, the more a religion of salvation turned to prophecy, the stronger were its promises tied to ethical commandments.85 "Sin" was now no longer a transgression of ritual or magic rite, but represented dis- belief of the (ethical) prophet and his commandments, a situation that gave rise to a specific attitude of piety furthering a methodical and ra- tional way of life. An inspired prophet was a revolutionary who aimed at revaluating all values, and as such, for Weber, the prototype of the charismatic personality.86 As against the priesterly casuistry that it sup- planted, ethical prophecy created a specific type of rationality87 that both reduced the power of magic,88 and increased systematization, af- fecting above all the people's style of life.89 "A true prophecy creates and systematically orients conduct toward one internal measure of value. In the face of this the 'world' is viewed as material to be fashioned ethically according to the norm."90 Ethical prophecy sparks an all-important "es- cape from magic,"91 and it was this, together with its specific conception of deity, on which rested "the uniqueness of the Near Eastern and West- ern choice of paths."92 A choice, remarkably enough, that was made on the cultural periphery,93 not lastly thanks to the determining influence of certain observable configurations of the promulgating strata that were subject to the political conditions at the time. With the "escape from magic" the demand for a solution to the problem of theodicy grew, as became particularly apparent during the next stage, ethical religions of salvation. This stage was characterized by a dualistic world view with a tendency to exalt the occult world above the real world. As a realm of universal reality commensurate with the real world, it became an object of the highest esteem (giving rise to the propensity of ethical religions to reject or wish to escape the real world). One important prerequisite of this de- velopment, outlined above, was a systematization of the concept of deity in the direction of a universal, ascetic monotheism; a rationalization process that, historically, only the Jews carried through according to the "dictates of consistency" and that elsewhere bogged down.94 The more this rationalization process "tends toward the conception of a transcen- dental unitary god who is universal, the more there arises the problem of how the extraordinary power of such a god may be reconciled with the imperfection of the world that he has created and rules over."95 Thus, what was previously a difference of degree between this world and the world beyond, became a difference of principle, which had "to be</page><page sequence="18">826 bridged by thought and action"96 - thought in the sense of constructing a more rational theodicy, and action in the sense of performing the "techniques of salvation" of that theodicy. Intellectual attempts to bridge the gap between the two realms were subject to a peculiar dialec- tic: "the further the disenchantment of the world advances, the more dif- ficult and intellectually demanding it becomes to construe a unity, and the more consistent the solution, the more does it contribute in turn to progressive disenchantment."97 According to Weber, there were three rational forms of theodicy by which the tension between this world and the Beyond was consistently resolved: Zoroastrian dualism, Calvinist puritan predestination, and Indian Kar- ma - spiritualistic, ethical, and ontological interpretations respectively of the dualism between this world and "the world behind the world." Weber outlined a typology of world religions. The traits of his typology, which are characterized by reciprocal correlation, are:98 1. A dualistic world view that separates this world from the Beyond; 2. A conceptualization of the Beyond; 3. Specific type of "conception of deity"; 4. A supportive construct for the dualism (a theodicy); 5. Method of achieving salvation; 6. Reward for living well (type of salvation and type of religious source); and 7. Definition of human identity. The Judeo-Christian and Indian religious traditions are the only ones in which these traits are characterized by consistent, internal correlation. The Indian conception of deity, of Brahma as an impersonal god of an eternal order, corresponds to a cosmocentric conception of the Beyond, likewise thought of in terms of an eternal order. This conception of deity and the cosmo-centric notion of the Other World possess in turn an elec- tive affinity to the predominant definition of human identity and to the methods preferred to reach salvation. The idea of deity as a timeless or- der corresponds to the idea of a human being as a "vessel," and both no- tions have a great affinity to the prime means to salvation, namely con- templation. This method, being a perfection of self, in turn relates to the reward promised for living the exemplary life - salvation through rebirth, which the virtuosi of this religion raised to a practical and rational re- jection of the world in order to escape it. By contrast, the Jewish conception of Jahwe as a personal god of action corresponds to a theocentric conception of the Beyond. This conception of deity and its theocentric Beyond in turn show a great affinity to the</page><page sequence="19">827 idea of people as "tools," which correlates with the practice of asceticism as a means to salvation. The religious virtuoso in this case, molding his or her practice along the lines of practical rationality, denies the world in order to master it. Now, if to determine the level of rationality achieved by these two religions we apply the measurements Weber suggested,99 (namely, degree of systematization of world view and theodicy, and degree of disenchant- ment of the means to salvation), we find that the Judeo-Christian tradi- tion evinces a higher rationalization level than the Indian tradition. In the former, degree of systematization and disenchantment correspond, while in the latter they do not.100 This dualistically constructed typology of Asian and Western (Europe- an) salvation religious is closely linked to a typology of the strata that promulgated them: 1. Religious position ("virtuoso" or "unmusical" in religious matters); 2. Social position (positively or negatively privileged strata); and 3. Nature of task (problems of internal or external need, solved by acting or contemplating).101 Weber characterized the salvation religions of Asia as "apolitical"'02 and as "pure religions of intellectu- als. "103 This also held for Hinduism, whose protagonists, the Brahmans, were a noble and educated class of "aristocratic literati."'04 Thus Weber could conclude: "Asia, and by that I mean India, is the typical country of an intellectual struggle for one thing and one thing only, for a 'world view' in the true sense of the word - the meaning of life in this world. "105 As regards their religious position, then, the Brahmans can be described as "religious virtuosi" who originated from positively privileged strata (the indicator of social position) and devoted themselves to the task of dealing with problems of "inner need" by thinking about them, i.e. by attempting to conceive a meaning for the universe.10 On one hand, the Brahmans are considered to be depoliticized "literati";107 on the other hand, they were saved the fate of having to compete over the long run with a powerful stratum of "secular" intellectuals. Even more fraught with consequences was the complete lack of an ethical, missionary prophecy, 108 the emergence of which is historically linked to the existence of an urban civilization. Its development was impeded in Asia, "partly by the unbroken power of the clans and partly by the separation of the castes."'09 Another impeding factor was the impassable barrier of com- mensality, which was a religious precondition for the rise of the Western bourgeoisie. 110</page><page sequence="20">828 The unique social character of the Indian intellectual stratum of "world- ordering magicians," '' was not inconsiderably influenced by the politi- cal conditions at the time. Weber sees a close adequacy relation between the specific social characteristics of this cultured status group and the in- tellectual products created by them; as he points out very clearly: The truly ingenious link between caste legitimacy and Karma doctrine, and thus with the specifically Brahman theodicy, was at bottom merely a product of rational, ethical thinking and not of some economic "condition" or other. And it was not until this product of thought was married to the actual social order by promises of rebirth that this order gained irresistible power over the minds and hopes of the people who were embedded in it.'2 Quite different was the social character of the strata that propagated the Judeo-Christian tradition. In the case of the Brahmans, where all three dimensions (religious position/social position/nature of task) have traits that act in unison (special religious qualification/membership in elite/concentration on problems of inner need) in the direction of a theo- retical rationalism,1 3 a typological location would produce a picture of a more or less tension-free intellectual culture. By contrast, a typology of the Judeo-Christian propagating strata would give an image of a tension-ridden web of relations - which for Weber was an important prerequisite for innovation: the occidental religious doctrines are more frequently products of the perennial compe- tition among prophets, priests, monks, and lay intellectuals, who are recruited not only from privileged ranks but also from petty-bourgeois and even quasi-proletarian strata. The knowledge gathered by them is not only reflective but also productive, and thus can serve practical concerns in the world.14 The same tense, competitive relationship existed in the West between secular and hierocratic authority, which possessed a monopoly on means to salvation and could grant or deny them at will. "1 Indeed the unique- ness of political conditions in the West, conditions that helped shape these strata, lay in competition or even conflict "between chiefs and their administrative staffs for appropriation and expropriation in relation to one another."1 6 Finally, this political struggle, which led to a social form favorable to innovation, (tenure) feudalism (Lehensfeudalismus) cor- responded to the bloodless struggle for exchange opportunities on the market.17 This was an indicator of the special political and economic situation of Western cities, whose autonomous middle class produced the new mechanism of market consociation.118 The elective affinity between religion and propagating strata possessed a high explanatory value for Weber, because it partially determined the</page><page sequence="21">829 direction in which a religious attitude, born of such "irrational admix- tures" as type of religious source (e.g., the notion of salvation), would develop into a rational image of the relations among god, man, and the world. Decisive here were the interests or social position of the promul- gating strata involved, particularly the difference between elite and "ple- bian" strata.19 The process of religious rationalization follows an "inner logic" of ideas.120 But because this inner logic or dynamics is one of actualized ideas, it always involves "interests and institutions."121 That is why Max Weber attributed such a high explanatory value to the strata that propa- gate religions and take up and advocate material or ideal interests, as well as to the general political conditions in which they must function. Characteristic of religious rationalization is that the disenchantment re- ligion both gave rise to and furthered eventually robbed it of its "vital force."122 With the advance of rationalization, as Weber put it, religion was increasingly "shifted into the realm of the irrational."123 When relig- ion relinguished its role as propagator of the processes of rationalization and disenchantment, its place was taken by secular powers with their own, inherent laws (e.g. those of economics, politics, science and art). 124 In the following excursus, based on the example of the secular power of science, we will outline the course and structure of the rationalization process following the abandonment of religion as a vital force, to identi- fy typical structural characteristics of logical rationalization processes - particularly their mechanism of "inner logic" that "compels" them to give rise to irrationality - by taking a fundamental instance of the disen- chantment to which both religion and science were subject. Disenchantment of the World through Science The disenchantment brought about by scientific rationality, which to- gether with modern capitalism and bureaucracy decisively shaped West- ern civilization ran in parallel to the process of religious disenchantment and continued where it left off.125 Like other "secular authorities," science possessed its own inherent disenchantment potential, which was triggered by religious disenchantment and let to specific, autonomous, "internal" developments. 126 Just as scientific rationality - which Weber describes as godless - made religion appear to be "the irrational or anti- rational supra-human power,"127 the process of scientific rationalization itself brought forth a countermovement of irrationalism.128</page><page sequence="22">830 This "internal autonomy" of the scientific rationalization process may be taken to stand for a general tendency of all such processes: "Every radical rationalization (creates) irrationalities with the necessity of fate."'29 This paradoxical reversal, inherent in every radical process of ra- tionalization, changing it "into its own opposite and creating a senseless 'irrationality' of autonomous and autarkic 'conditions' which now dom- inate human activity,"130 was demonstrated by Weber, using the example of economic and political rationalization processes and their characteris- tic reversal of means and ends. The machinery in a rationally organized factory, conceived as means of production to master nature, can "re- verse" and become an instrument of discipline; just as rational bureaucracy, designed to objectify the rule of men over other people, can become an end in itself, a "shell of bondage""'3 that imprisons and dominates its makers. Though the origins of science, as Weber says,'32 were bound up with a search for the meaning of life (and death), and though in the seventeenth century science was even expected to reveal a "path to God," its later development increasingly obscured its original task - to "teach mean- ing." Modern science is a "specifically irreligious," or more precise- ly, a godless power; and as such it can teach nothing about the meaning of the universe and even teaches that the question of meaning itself is absurd. Because it can make no statement about a timeless meaning of existence, science cannot produce values by which people can orient their lives. Ultimate judgments can never be proven by recourse to tradition or to science; they are a personal matter and they involve taking a stand. The need to take a stand, to express what Mommsen called "aristocratic in- dividualism," reflects with rare clarity the function of the "ideal type": The ideal-type construct is motivated by the stand taken by a person who has lost his illusions, who finds himself in a world that has become objectively meaningless and very sober, and who, thrown back on himself, is forced to conceive the meaning of things and even man's relationship to reality as, basically, his own problem, and to "cre- ate" meaning, both practical and theoretical.'33 The disenchantment hypothesis follows from the premise on which em- pirical science bases its view of the universe, the assumption that in prin- ciple "there are no mysterious incalculable forces... and that one can, in principle, master all things by calculation. "134 As Weiss elaborates, the assumption "that the world itself places no fundamental restrictions on human beings' calculating and dominating will implies... just as fun-</page><page sequence="23">831 damentally that from this world no points of reference can be derived for 'objectively' binding meanings and values."'35 To arrive at a notion of the world as generally predictable and controlla- ble, its "transformation into a causal mechanism" must first be posit- ed. 136 This empirical interpretation of the universe as a "cosmos of natu- ral causality" supplanted that advanced by religious and philosophical thinking, namely a cosmos of ethically compensated causality.137 "The concepts of 'causal mechanism' and 'natural causality,'" writes Weiss, "thus describe a universal cause and effect relation, on the assumption that... all moral interpretations or connotations are discarded. "38 These concepts also point to the essence of the demand that science be without presuppositions, which is the term Weber used in "Science as a Voca- tion" in place of "Value-free science." The ethical correlate of this de- mand is the injunction to think lucidly and to be intellectually honest. For what remains after religion and science have split apart inexorably is the compulsion of method, in which concepts play the role of "logical thumbscrews" with the aid of which "we can coerce ourselves and others into thinking clearly."139 This duty of intellectual honesty is also a lega- cy of religion or the religious ethic,140 a thought that Weber apparently found in Nietzsche.14' Nietzsche wrote that "the conscientiousness in small matters and the self-control of religious people was a training ground for the scientific character - especially the frame of mind that takes problems seriously aside from any personal gain that might arise." 142 Weber's Reconstruction of the Legal Rationalization Process Explanatory Potential of "Intrajuristic" and "Extrajuristic" Relations Anyone who attempts to trace elective affinities between the processes of religious and legal rationalization must take two things into account: first, Weber's notion that the stages of religious rationalization could be distinguished by degree of disenchantment and degree of systematiza- tion;'43 and second, the high explanatory value he attached to the propagating strata. Legal rationalization thus also involved a process of increasing disen- chantment and systematization, whereby the direction in which the for- mal (rational) qualities of law developed was directly influenced - as We- ber explicitly stated'44 - by what he called "intrajuristic" conditions. These conditions were the distinguishing traits of the promulgating stra-</page><page sequence="24">832 ta and especially the type of legal training that practitioners of law had received. "Extra-juristic" conditions, meaning political and economic conditions, by contrast, could exert either a direct or indirect effect on legal rationalization. In his Sociology of Law, Weber demonstrated the direct effect of in- trajuristic conditions on the formal or rational qualities of law most clearly by comparing Continental with English developments. This com- parison followed both the model he used to elucidate the differing con- ceptions of deity in the Near and Far East (cf. "Excursus" above) and that logical argument by which he coupled his dualistic typology of Asiatic and Occidental salvation religions with a typology of the strata that propagated them - indeed, the ideal types he postulated for this pur- pose were invariably constructed as contrasting pairs.145 Weber distinguished between empirical and rational law training, that is, between training through practice of the law and theoretical training at university. 146 The first type is related to the teaching of law in England by a guild of barristers;147 the second describes university training of the Continental type. Weber drew parallels between these two types of legal training and the bodies of law they gave rise to, which differed accord- ingly in the level of rationalization achieved.148 Empirical law training was responsible for a "formalistic treatment of the law, bound by prece- dent and analogies... [which] did not aim at all at a rational system but rather at a practically useful scheme of contracts and actions, oriented towards the interests of clients in typically recurrent situations..."1'49 Theoretical law training at university by contrast produced concepts that "bear the character of abstract norms, which, at least in principle, are formed and distinguished from one another by a rigorously formal and rational logical interpretation of meaning."150 These, in other words, were general concepts formed "by abstraction from concreteness or by logical interpretation of meaning or by generalization and subsumption" and used "in syllogistically applicable norms." These norms tended moreover to diverge ever further from "the everyday needs of the pub- lic. "151 The legal products of these two different types of education diverge with respect to their level of rationalization. This is given by the rationaliza- tion differential a/b in Field A in table 3, which was compiled with the aid of Weber's classification.152 It is the differential that exists between casuistry and systematized law:</page><page sequence="25">833 TABLE 3 Classification of Law Rational Irrational A Formal law: takes only unambiguous general characteristics of the facts of the case into account B Uses means other than those which can be intellectually tested to order problems of legislation and adjudication E either a O legally relevant &gt; characteristics are perceptible as sense data casuistry or b they are derived from logical analysis of meaning, giving rise to fixed legal concepts in form of highly abstract rules legal system C Decision of legal problems influenced by . norms beyond those obtained by logical . generalization of abstract interpretations % of meaning - ethical imperatives, n utilitarian or other expediential rules, political credos D Concrete evaluations of individual cases - ethical, emotional, or political - are crucial for decisions rather than general norms "Kadi-justice" Empirical jurisprudence gives rise to formal law to the extent that the "legally relevant characteristics are of a tangible nature; i.e., that they are perceptible as sense data";'53 the rationalization level which it can achieve depends on the intellectual manipulation of generalization. The legal propositions or axioms thus derived will generally in turn affect the specification of the relevant characteristics of the facts. This intellectual effort both rests on casuistry and promotes it, and the work of analysis may go hand in hand with the synthetic work of constructing legal rela- tions and institutions. In contrast to empirical jurisprudence, which sets up casuistries at the basis of analytic and synthetic thought, theoretical jurisprudence, by subjecting its materials to logic, is in a position to construct legal systems characterized by an extreme degree of formal rationality.'54 Disregarding for the moment Weber's typical caveats, the hypothesis may be advanced that, first, as legal training approaches the "academic model" (i.e., an ongoing enterprise with primarily theoretical tendency), the rationalization chances will increase, by the following steps: analytic Oracles</page><page sequence="26">834 effort of generalization/casuistry/synthetic effort of legal structur- ing/systematization. Each of these steps will be encouraged by the extent to which secular law succeeds in separating itself from canonical or ec- clesiastical law. Second, a rationalization differential will exist between the academic model and the practical training model with its active professional practitioners, this being expressed in terms of the difference between casuistry and legal system, which Weber equates with that be- tween English and Continental law. 55 According to Weber, there is an affinity between training in theoretical, deductive thinking and formal legal logic on the one hand, and on the other between training in empirical, inductive thinking and a lack of for- malism. The further the practical training model develops in the direc- tion of the academic model of literary education, the greater will be the chance that the formal and rational qualities of law will be augmented. This level of explanation is clearly linked to a second level, that of gener- al political conditions, particularly to structures of domination. The in- troduction of this variable set156 into a sociology of law - Weber treated it systematically under the headings of theocracy, imperium, and democracy'57 - has various functions. First, it renders the explanation more complex by distinguishing between the formation and the dissemi- nation of new legal institutions and by relating this distinction to the variable set of intrajuristic and extrajuristic (i.e., political) conditions. In the end, the variable set of political conditions serves to answer whether the development of law and legal institutions is primarily economically determined. This involves the concomitant question of how the develop- ment of the formal qualities of law came about, a question that for We- ber meant the unfolding of a dialectical process between formal and sub- stantial rationality - not independent of the given political conditions. Closely allied to this view is the thought that the potential for unification or systematization of law can, in a sense, be "borrowed" from estab- lished political, economic, or religious enterprises, insofar as these are interested in rational administration. Bureaucratic patrimonialism in particular, due to its interest in a unified and closed system, can contrib- ute to this unification of law. Weber's "secret theory" of legal rationalization as an interplay of in- trajuristic and extrajuristic conditions (whereby he continually empha- sized the dominance of the former) attributes to inherent factors the in- vention of legal institutions, but their dissemination to external factors:</page><page sequence="27">835 Like the technological methods of industry, the rational patterns of legal technique to which the law is to give its guaranty must first be 'invented' before they can serve an existing economic interest. Hence the specific type of techniques used in a legal system or, in other words, its modes of thought are of far greater significance for the likeli- hood that a certain legal institution will be invented in its context than is ordinarily be- lieved. Economic situations do not automatically give birth to new legal forms; they merely provide the opportunity for the actual spread of a legal technique if it is invented. Many of our specifically capitalistic legal institutions are of medieval rather than Ro- man origin, although Roman law was much more rationalized in a logical sense than medieval law. While this fact has certain economic reasons, it is also due to a variety of reasons deriving entirely from differences of legal technique.'58 And, as Weber adds, Western legal thought during the Middle Ages, due to its very lack of logical formality, allowed a diversity of forms that the given political conditions assured of acceptance, e.g. the diffuse power relations of estate patrimonialism. The relationship between intrajuristic and extrajuristic conditions will be discussed in detail below based on a comparison between English and Continental models of legal training and thinking, an opposition typical of Weber. It remains to be shown that the connection described above between kind of training/promulgating stratum and the specific nature of rationalization (casuistry versus legal system) was crucially influenced by the complex of variables of political conditions. Weber emphasized over and over again, in varied phrasings, the significance of this set of variables for the differential development of legal rationalization in England and on the Continent (in Germany) (see Table 4). These differences have sprung from the autonomous development of the respective structures of domination: In England, centralized justice and rule by notables; in Ger- many, absence of political centralization in spite of bureaucratization. England, which in modern times was the first and most highly developed capitalist country, thereby re- tained a less rational and less bureaucratic judicature.'59 It is also of note that Weber held political factors responsible for the es- tablishment and duration of administration by honoratiores160 in Eng- land (advancing the prognosis logically suggested by his argument that as soon as these reasons ceased to be effective, England would also be caught up in the general trend to bureaucratization).161 Weber explained the evident stability of the English administration by notables in the face of bureaucratization trends by saying that such older structures retained their significance when they were "technically highly developed and functionally particularly well adapted to the requirements at hand."1162</page><page sequence="28">836 TABLE 4 Intrajuristic and Extrajuristic Variables in England and Germany England Germany (Continent) Political conditions .

The frequently reciprocal dependencies among intrajuristic and ex- trajuristic variables that Weber applied to the diverging levels of ration- alization in English and Continental law, i.e., their differing content of formal qualities, may be tabulated as in Table 4. What must be remarked first of all is that the respective political constel- lations, particularly the presence or absence of early political centraliza- tion, affected the social constitution of the propagating strata involved, i.e., the legal notables responsible for shaping the law in each country at each stage of the development. This brought about an indirect influence on rationalization - in England, through the failure of attempts to ra- tionally codify law and the failure to accept Roman law. In contrast to the German (Continental) jurist class, a socially powerful stratum of legal notables was able to establish itself in England, bar- 1 t</page><page sequence="29">837 risters organized in close-knit corporations from which emerged the judges of the High Courts. This estate developed law education along empirical lines and defended their creation against attempts to scientifi- cally rationalize law on the part of canonical courts and universities. Their resistance was conditioned by economic and material interests, as well as by an interest in retaining the status quo - by questions of status and group interests, in other words. 163 In England moreover, unlike the Italian notaries and German jurists, the notables could promulgate a na- tional law, since national unity in England was embodied in the concen- tration of adjudication in the Royal Courts at London.164 In England the consolidation and unity of the Empire, embodied in a central govern- ment and judiciary, was initially far greater than on the Continent. As additional and closely interrelated indicators of the different initial political conditions in England and on the Continent, Weber employed, first, the structure of the corporation, which in England was much more elitist and more strictly determined by jurists than in Germany;165 and second, the inception and course of the process of nationalization of those associations.166 The relatively early existence of patrimonial bureaucracy in England is held responsible for the fact that there, despite the predominance of empirical legal thought, a unification and sys- tematization of the law was attempted via the unity and centralism of the Empire, symbolized by the central political and judicial powers. This process of rationalization, however, bore a material character;167 i.e. it was an attempt to adapt the law to substantial demands, whether of a practical and utilitarian or of an ethical nature. Hence, insofar as appeal was held to material justice rather than to formal regulation of conflicts of interest, "Kadi-justice" was the suitable form of adjudication - at least vis-a-vis the economically less privileged strata (a topic treated in more detail below in the context of the "England problem"). In other words, even traditional law, when its basic orientation is material, is sub- ject to the dialectic of substantive and formal rationalization, and the direction this dialectical process takes will depend, among other things, on the structure of domination. In Germany, the opportunity to advance formal rationalization within traditional structures of domination was particularly good - if at a later date than in England - due to the political conditions obtaining and to the predominant type of legal thinking, theoretical and deductive; first, thanks to the trend to bureaucratization (from estate patrimonialism and absolutism to the bureaucratic administrative state).</page><page sequence="30">838 The princes, and especially the absolute monarch, desired order, unity, and cohesion in their realms. 168 Thus princely, fiscal, and administrative interests, not to mention those of official spheres, combined to produce attempts to codify the law, or, as Weber puts it, to unify and systematize it. However, the rationalization potential of such ongoing political enter- prises is limited. 169 The argument is further complicated by the fact that Weber in reality traces the rationalization wave as regards the formal qualities of law not so much back to the rational structures of the ad- ministration as to its functionaries, by introducing the term "rationalism of officialdom." In this context, "official" has two connotations: first, a socially powerful estate of jurists, and second, the theoretical schooling of these official jurists. In other words, Weber combined the trend to bureaucratization with the trend toward professionalization - the forma- tion of specialist man. Seen in this light, behind the rationalization differential between England and Germany was mainly the difference be- tween administration by notables and administration by career officials (which in turn is overlaid by the difference between well-rounded and specialized man).170 Here, too, Weber has oriented his discussion to the three-level model that proved so useful in his sociology of religion. The intrajuristic conditions correspond to the interpretive level of propagating strata, and extrajuris- tic conditions to that of political conditions (whereby the two interpre- tive levels overlap at certain points and certain differences with explana- tory value are relativized, e.g. that between administration by notables and by trained officials, by means of borrowings from traditionalistic ar- guments such as that notables had a highly developed adaptability to ex- isting needs). Finally, in the context of extrajuristic conditions, Weber pointed to the significance of economic interrelations for the develop- ment of the formal qualities of law. Some of Weber's statements create the impression that the three com- plexes of variables can be ordered in a clear hierarchy, with the third complex, that of economic conditions, assuming a special place. As will be shown in the section on the "England problem," however, the inde- pendent meaning of economic variables was later qualified. Quite in keep- ing with the explanatory model just outlined, Weber writes: "Formally, on the other hand, rationalist bureaucracy" - a few lines earlier he had still spoken of the "rationalism of officialdom in absolutist states":</page><page sequence="31">839 had a heartfelt interest in the compendious collection of statutes, in the ubiquitous em- ployability of the official, in homogeneous law, above all, in the paramountcy of authoritative enactment over inviolate tradition and over the arbitrary autonomy of lo- cally and socially differentiated law. Bureaucracy, wherever it held sway alone, was not only interested in the juridical perfection of legal forms but rather in their substantive "justice" which alone could correspond to the immanent ethos of bureaucracy. Bureaucracy has substantively rationalized and systematized law unless checked by eco- nomically powerful capitalist interests or a socially powerful estate of jurists. Other- wise bureaucracy has destroyed formal juristic technology which is indifferent to sub- stantive "justice."'71 The chance that formal rationalization would overcome substantive ra- tionalization under the structural conditions of traditional domination, was largest, according to Weber, when the interest of the imperium in abolishing estate rights coincided with an interest particularly on the part of the middle classes in calculable jurisprudence and govern- ment. 172 To the degree that the imperium (i.e., bureaucratic patrimonialism) was then transformed into the rationalized, institutionalized state, the tension173 grew within the predominant basic orientation between the ab- stract formalistic character of the bureaucracy and the demand that law fulfil substantive postulates, which was raised principally by democratic mass movements. In this way the dialectic between formal and substan- tive rationality was transformed into a tension between bureaucratiza- tion and professionalization on the one hand and democratization on the other.174 We shall return to this problem below. Weber's Discussion of the "England Problem" as an Index of the Significance of Economic Conditions In the context of comparing England and the Continent (Germany), what has come to be known as the "England problem" is a good point of departure for discussing how economic factors influenced legal ra- tionalization.175 The interesting question is why England produced capitalism despite its law not being characterized by fully developed for- malism.175 Or to reverse the question, why did capitalism not first arise on the Continent or in Germany, where law was marked by a high degree of logical formalism? Weber's discussion of this problem also sheds light on the question of interest in the present context, namely the significance of economic con- ditions within the three-level model he favored.</page><page sequence="32">840 The England problem seems especially thorny when it is considered in light of the connection Weber repeatedly emphasized between bureaucracy and rational law on the one side and capitalism on the oth- er. This connection had to do with the circumstance that the principles of market consociation were thought to be identical with those of mod- ern bureaucracy and modern, rational law. In both, impersonal objective rules guaranteed a high degree of calculability or predictability. Nevertheless, what Weber called the "separate developmental directions of capitalism" - exchange capitalism and industrial capitalism - depend- ed on predictability to different degrees. Exchange trade was less sensi- tive to legal imponderables than industrial capitalism, which was and is more dependent on the continuity warranted by a rational legal order: The universal predominance of market consociation requires on the one hand a legal system the functioning of which is calculable in accordance with rational rules. On the other hand, the constant expansion of the market... has favored the monopolization and regulation of all "legitimate" coercive power by one universalist coercive institu- tion through the disintegration of all particularist status-determined and other coercive structures which have been resting mainly on economic monopolies.'77 A note is perhaps in order here concerning the status of the term "con- nection" introduced above. Weber preferred the expression "internal cor- respondence" or "elective affinity," which of course has a different sta- tus from that of a causal relation. Elective affinity in the present context may be defined thus: The calculability of concrete legal decisions based on a closed, formally rational legal system, from whose general norms and logical coherence unambiguous solutions for particular cases may be derived, corresponds or is meaningfully intellectually related, to the strictly calculated and predictable economic administration of a developing capi- talist market economy. Moreover, this kind of economy requires a legal practice which is rationally calculable on the basis of codified general norms.'78 The use of the category elective affinity indicates an "analysis in the mode of possibility,"179 which means that "this correspondence (is not) necessary realiter or (is present) generally in concreto; or in other words, that certain more or less developed capitalist economic situations "cre- ate" a formal legal rationality corresponding to that situation."'80 As modern developments have shown, the possibility of such an elective af- finity has been actualized only in this one, historically unique case, al- lowing Weber to write: "Today, however, capitalism and bureaucracy have found one another and belong intimately together."'18 That is, the general possibility or necessity of elective affinity cannot be raised to an explanatory principle. The unimpeachable historical facts that early capitalist development in</page><page sequence="33">841 England was not linked to achieved level of formal legal rationalization'82 and that, vice versa, in Rome the highest degree of le- gal rationalization, thanks to an immanent development in the schools and to the needs of Justinian absolutism, was reached only after "capi- talist development" had run its course,'83 allow us to conclude'84 that without the foregoing, not always primarily economically conditioned and sometimes purely immanent legal developments... no capitalist interests, no matter how power- ful, and no "correspondence," intellectually convincing as it may be, between the eco- nomic form of capitalism and a formally rational law, could conjure up a law of that type of their own accord. The fact that this law existed in quite developed form and was capable of further development, and that it was at the disposal of modern capital- ism, even becoming one of the prerequisites of its unfolding, was the result of a com- plex historical development, among the factors of which were, besides economic needs and interests, most particularly the immanent requirements of the princely city ad- ministrations, the reception of Roman law (which was by no means primarily economi- cally determined), of Canon law, the inherent development of jurisprudence in the schools, and other factors. 85 It must also be granted, however, that the "immanent development of certain (particularly religiously conditioned) forms of law inadequate to capitalism frequently hindered its development."'86 A prime and often- cited example of this is Islamic law.187 But to return to the England problem. In solving this problem, Weber relied primarily on the notion of "calculability." This was largely a result of his considering that factor the characteristic trait of modern culture par excellence: The increasing intellectualization and rationalization do not, therefore, indicate an in- creased and general knowledge of the conditions under which one lives. It means something else, namely, the knowledge or belief that if one but wished one could learn it at any time. Hence, it means that principally there are no mysterious in- calculable forces that come into play, but rather that one can, in principle, master all things by calculation. This means that the world is disenchanted. One need no longer have recourse to magical means in order to master or implore the spirits, as did the sav- age, for whom such mysterious powers existed. Technical means and calculations per- form the service.188 The peculiar nature of modern capitalism, especially its technical and economic substructure, requires that success be calculable, and law figures as one means to assure this. However - and this is decisive to the argument - in England and Germany the chances that law and adjudica- tion would be rendered calculable depended on different premises. Mod- ern capitalist operations, says Weber, can emerge only in such circum- stances as 1) In England, where the development of the law was practically in the hands of the lawyers who, in the service of their capitalist clients, invented suitable forms for the</page><page sequence="34">842 transaction of business, and from whose midst the judges were recruited who were strictly bound to precedent, that means, to calculable schemes; or 2) where the judge, as in the bureaucratic state with its rational laws, is more or less an automaton of para- graphs: the legal documents, together with the costs and fees, are dropped in at the top with the expectation that the judgement will emerge at the bottom together with more or less sound arguments - an apparatus, that is, whose functioning is by and large cal- culable or predictable.89 Despite the rationalization differential between England and Germany with respect to the formal qualities of law, legal proceedings were pre- dictable in both places due to the predictability of the judges, though this may have been assured in different ways.190 Weber expanded this ar- gument by an important mention of the dualism of adjudication, which in England was never threatened by revolution.191 This dualism consisted in a formal justice for conflicts within the economically privileged strata and an informal or Kadi justice - which amounted in practice to a denial of justice - for the economically weaker strata, which "was in close con- formity with the interests of the propertied, especially the capitalist, classes."'92 These circumstances favorably affected the development of capitalism in England, together with the further factor that "Legal train- ing has primarily been in the hands of lawyers from among whom also the judges are recruited, i.e., in the hands of a group which is active in the service of propertied, and particularly capitalistic, private interests and which has to gain its livelihood from them.193 Above all, that trait of Anglo-American law that differentiated it from Continental law - its lack of strict logical construction despite its achieved level of formalism - was responsible for the great practical applicability that English law re- tained from the viewpoint of the middle classes. This "regressiveness" of English legal formalism makes possible "a far greater wealth of practi- cally useful legal devices"'94 with whose aid judges could react flexibly to the needs of middle-class capitalist interests. In other words, this in- terest in a flexible and adaptable yet predictable adjudication, "as ex- perience shows... may be gratified quite as well, and often better, by a formal, empirical case law."'95 Such law, moreover, encourages the im- aginative faculty of its practitioners in whose hands the formation of new law primarily lies; as vice versa, a highly developed legal formalism tends to gratify the abstract intellectual needs of legal theoreticians, giv- ing rise to the frequent charge that the purely logical law is remote from life. On the one hand, Weber outlined the conditions that lent law in England a high degree of adaptability to economic and capitalist development, via the interests of its middle-class propagating strata and served by the innovative thinking of legal practitioners, which always held close to the</page><page sequence="35">843 practical problems of their middle-class clients. On the other hand, how- ever, he also pointed to the restrictions inherent in adjudication by honoratiores, saying that in the long run, modern capitalist operations would be better served by formally highly developed law with a high de- gree of predictability, whose judges and administration functioned like "legal automata." Weber reduced this to the homily that today, capital- ism and bureaucracy were good bedfellows,196 just as rationally struc- tured administration went hand-in-hand with rationally structured law. Quite in keeping with this but-and type of argumentation, Weber could write: In any case adjudication by honoratiores inclines to be essentially empirical, and its procedure... may thus well stand in the way of the interests of the bourgeois classes and it may indeed be said that England achieved capitalistic supremacy among the na- tions not because but rather in spite of its judicial system. For these very reasons the bourgeois strata have generally tended to be intensely interested in a rational procedural system!97 It is part of the logic of this view that Weber not only predicted an in- creasing bureacratization'98 and formalization of legislation in England but also a change in the formal qualities of the law, saying that "the traditional position of the English judge is also likely to be transformed permanently and profoundly."199 Disregarding for the moment the significance of the Protestant ethic for the development of a methodical pattern of life "spiritually adequate" to the capitalist economic system200 and a personality structure that could stand the tensions of modern life, the so-called England problem again points up with superb clarity that in Weber's explanatory model, economic conditions played a strangely secondary role. They were at best indirectly effective201 or took the form of elective affinities, e.g., between market consociation and formal law, a category of great insight and sug- gestive force but nonetheless relatively low explanatory value (unless this mere approximate relationship can be transformed into one of cause and effect). Weber's Rudimentary Theory of Stages and Directions in Legal Ra- tionalization As in his sociology of religion, Weber employed a three-level model in his sociology of law whose explanatory potential derives largely from factors on the two levels of propagating stratum and political conditions obtaining. And as before, stages and directions were distinguished within the formal and substantial process of legal rationalization. In analogy</page><page sequence="36">844 to the religious process according to degree of disenchantment (or sloughing off of magic) and degree of systematization Weber gave the following developmental stages for legal rationalization: first, charismatic legal revelation through "law prophets"; second, empirical creation and finding of law by legal honoratiores, i.e., law creation through cautelary jurispru- dence and adherence to precedent; third, imposition of law by secular or theocratic powers; fourth and finally, systematic elaboration of law and professionalized adminis- tration of justice by persons who have received their legal training in a learned and for- mally logical manner. From this perspective, the formal qualities of the law emerge as follows: arising in primitive legal procedure from a combination of magically condi- tioned formalism and irrationality conditioned by revelation, they proceed to increas- ingly specialized juridical and logical rationality and systematization, sometimes pass- ing through the detour of theocratically or patrimonially conditioned substantive and informal expediency. Finally, they assume, at least from an external viewpoint, an in- creasingly logical sublimation and deductive rigor and develop an increasingly rational technique in procedure.202 Weber's reconstruction of the religious rationalization process in terms of a "minimal evolutionary program" (Seyfarth) had the advantage of being centered on an "internal compulsion to rationalize" arising from the need to solve the problem of theodicy. This minimal program was built on a theory of the inherent logic of ideas, or, more precisely, of ac- tualized ideas,203 such that the inherent laws governing these ideas al- ways pointed to external conditions of a political or economic kind. Moreover, the actualization of these ideas depended on the propagating strata that were responsible for thinking out projected theodices to their logical ends. By contrast, Weber's reconstruction of the legal rationalization process appears to have no "functional equivalent" for the theodicy problem. Driving force behind legal rationalization was the dialectic of formal and substantive rationality.204 Put differently, Weber's view was dominated above all by analyses "of juristic conditions and their connections to the respective social and cultural environment not from the outside, but from the inside, in terms of their typical, system-specific 'inherent laws."205 Particularly enlightening for the structure of Weber's argu- ments is not only the comparison already made between law and relig- ion, but a comparison between law and music. Both were social, cultural phenomena that had developed into relatively autonomous realms of life and unfolded a specific, inherent dynamic: In the case of music, the tension between expressive or pragmatic (e.g., cultic) musical rationality on the one hand and "pure" rationality devoted to perfecting tone systems and techniques on the other; in the case of law, the tension between "material" ration- alization emerging from legal interests and corresponding to extant ideas of justice on the one hand, and a "formally" rational perfection based on traditions in thought and the needs of legal specialists on the other.206</page><page sequence="37">845 It might seem profitable to look for the functional equivalent of the the- odicy problem and its development in the notion of natural law and its development. For as one author has said, "a not inconsiderable part of the religious rationalization process drew sustenance from the need for a both theoretically and practically unified interpretation of the universe, just as the classical ideas of natural law must be conceived as a signifi- cant attempt to find a meaningful place for man in the universe and to interpret that universe as in itself meaningful."207 This assumption also finds support in two indications Weber gave that the legitimacy lent to positive law by natural law was itself subject to a tension between formal and substantive rationality208 and that, very much in the sense of his out- lined "developmental stages of legal theory," "this charismatic glorifica- tion of 'Reason'... is the last form that charisma has adopted in its fate- ful historical course."209 Despite the multifarity of conceptions of natural law, their development can be related to specific propagating strata - Welzel210 distinguishes, for instance, between theologists, philosophers involved in politics, and jurists involved in philosophy. It can also be related to the products of their thought and the reception of those products, and cannot be seen in isolation from the political conditions obtaining and the predominant social form.211 Nevertheless, since the idea of natural law was peculiar to the West,212 the at first so tempting solution of reconstructing the le- gal rationalization process in accordance with the "inherent logic" of the natural law idea must be abandoned. The "secularization of the law and the growth of a strictly formal mode of juridical thought"213 was a process that ran through various develop- mental stages and was subject to a dialectical tension between formal and substantive rationality.214 The direction of this rationalization process was determined primarily by intrajuristic conditions - type of propagating stratum, type of legal thought - and by extrajuristic con- tions, primarily by the political conditions, which in his sociology of law Weber treated in the sequence of historically actualized notions of order (theodicy, imperium, and democracy). In the modern age, at the peak of formal rationalization, the piety prin- ciple has been replaced by the legality principle and the culture is charac- terized by formal, rational law, with a formal, rational bureaucracy made up of expertly trained officials. Here Weber observed, as a result of an increasing democratization of government and society, a remanifestation of the tension between formal law and substantive justice,215 of the type</page><page sequence="38">846 demanded particularly by intellectuals and by the negatively privileged who have begun to unite in mass organizations. This tension simultane- ously represents a tension between legal security (calculability) and equality on the one side and substantive justice on the other. In that sense it reflects the conflict of interest between the middle classes - the administrators of ongoing political and economic enterprises - and propertyless lower classes.216 The result of which, according to Weber, is a tendency to dissolution of strict legal formalism - a change of direc- tion towards the resubstantiation of law. This change of direction marks another parallel between the processes of legal and religious rationalization. Because of the inherent develop- ment of scientific thinking, religious rationalization also experienced a turn toward irrationality at the peak of the disenchantment process. And where rational science has succeeded in completely demystifying the world, "religion is increasingly displaced from the realm of the rational to that of the irrational, and only now becomes the irrational or antira- tional suprapersonal force."217 In the case of legal rationalization, this turnabout is among other things the result of an "internal development in legal thinking,"218 and thus a possible consequence of the tension be- tween an interest in predictability and an interest in substantive justice. The inexorable trend to bureaucratization is manifested above all in the bureaucratic institutional state,219 which Weber raised to the incarnation of formal rationality by giving absolute status to the results he obtained by comparing it in terms of rationality to patrimonial bureaucracy and in terms of effectiveness to administration by notables. This bureaucratic institutional state doubtless guarantees an extremely high degree of cal- culability, but if its formal rationality should become absolute,220 it runs the danger of turning into a "shell of bondage" and creating Egyptian conditions in modern society. To meet this danger, if for no other reason, the modern bureaucratic state cannot afford to waive substantively ra- tional points of view, which prevent a reversal of means and ends. This is expressed, for example, in "the tendency of officials to treat their offi- cial function from what is substantively a utilitarian point of view,"221 which however tends to remain hidden because their practical thinking often takes the material form of formal rules. To the extent that the ongo- ing political operation of the bureaucratic institutional state increases the tendency toward a predictability of administrative action (a tendency furthered by those strata that run rational economic operations), an in- terest also grows in the "specialist expertise" of administration and adju- dication, and thus in "specialist man" per se. One consequence of this development is an exacerbation of the difference between experts and</page><page sequence="39">laypersons, which becomes so radical that it recalls the contrast between religious virtuosi and amateurs.222 This in turn gives rise to a counter- movement, a popularization or amateurization of law and administra- tion,223 which is definitely comparable to popular religious movements that attempt to close the gap between "virtuoso" and mass religiosity. In summary, the tension between formal and substantive rationality in the modern age finds multifarious expression: first, on the level of legal thought itself, then as a tension between legality and morality and thus between bureaucratization and democratization. It is not lastly ex- pressed, however, in a vertical direction, as a tension across social classes from trained officials (experts) to laypeople which is overlaid by that typical shaping factor of Western culture, the struggle between the spe- cialist and the traditionally educated or cultivated man224 whose educa- tional ideals, compressed into the pattern of the conventional English gentleman, still lived on in the English administration by notables. On the Continent, the development of rational objectivity led to the estab- lishment of a stratum of officials and trained experts and thus to a pre- dominance of behavior according to the written code - to the "perfec- tion of the membership mentality" (Griinberger). This too was a victory of capitalism, if a belated one, over the soul of man. An Afterword that Can be Read as a Foreword This study deals with Weber's sociology of religion and law in two longer sections, which are connected by a series of points of comparison. It aims to prove a significant correspondence between these two specific so- ciologies of Max Weber's with regard to the chosen reference framework. Thus some peculiarities of his sociology of law are made less unusual. This applies in particular to Weber's statement, which at first sight is sur- prising, that "the direction in which these formal qualities (of law) de- velop is... conditioned directly by 'intrajuristic' conditions: the particu- lar character of the individuals who are in a position to influence by virtue of their profession the ways in which the law is shaped."225 Weber operated in both his sociology of religion and sociology of law with an interpretive model that united complex constellations of factors on the three levels of propagating strata, political conditions, and eco- nomic structures in "relationships of tension" that bore an inherent potential for innovation and progressive rationalization. Of the factors Weber used to analyze the processes of religious and legal</page><page sequence="40">848 rationalization, those related to propagating stratum and to dominant configurations of social order took up the largest space. In his writings on the sociology of religion, he subsumed both dimensions under the concept of social constitution. Those factors generally classified under economic conditions, by contrast, played a comparatively subordinate role (in his sociology of law Weber referred either to economic influences of a concrete kind, which were not capable of generalization, or he had recourse to the very general image of an "elective affinity" or relation by choice between rational law and market consociation). The rather marginal role of economic conditions resulted not only from the circum- stance that, thanks to the embedding of economy in politics, the process of economic rationalization could unfold only partially over long peri- ods of social history. It was also a function of Weber's view that certain types of living have their affinities to certain types of economic behavior, more in consequence of ethical, rational influences than in consequence of economic pres- sure and despite the fact that most all ethical rationalities must be seen as arising in large part from economic factors. For Weber, ethical, substantial rationalities are equipped with a superior and more lasting ability to rationalize action.226 To which must be added that this ability depends on these rationalities being advocated by a powerful social class or classes. The frame of reference outlined above implies a number of difficulties. Weber's attempts to put the factors of each variable set in a systematic order were insufficient. His limitation of the number of factors per set was based on a pragmatic criterion: the points of comparison by which he had organized his typological models (in longitudinal and cross sec- tions). Still largely unanswered is the question of the type of relation be- tween the three sets of variables and the concomitant question as to their autonomy. The question arises here, for example, whether there might not be con- cealed behind the complex variable of propagating stratum some theo- retical conception, perhaps very rudimentary, which would open a rela- tively independent path toward the explanation of religious and legal rationalization. That Weber attributed a high explanatory potential to the concept of propagating stratum was involved with the way he recon- structed the process of religious rationalization, as a stage-model with clearly distinguished developmental stages, and tied these stages together by logically constructed (thoroughly rationalized) statements of the the- odicy problem and its solutions, which conformed to the "inherent logic of ideas." Admittedly - and in this lies the significance of the notion of</page><page sequence="41">849 propagating strata - such "internal" rationalization processes appeared and became socioculturally significant only when they were propagated by certain social strata. In these cases, besides political and economic factors, the specific characteristics of the propagating stratum - a certain constellation of factors that Weber generally used to typify it, e.g., kind of ideal and material interests, type of schooling, degree of political dis- franchisement - also influenced the direction the rationalization process developed. This influence is quite obvious in the case of primarily apolit- ical intellectual strata that propagate theoretical rationalization or, in other words that attempt to master reality by inventing and elaborating increasingly abstract and precise concepts, and raising them to ultimate principles. Propagating strata are embedded in configurations of order. For this rea- son alone, the concept of propagating strata is closely linked to the varia- ble set of political conditions (which is why Weber goes at length into the social constitution of India and China in his writings on the sociolo- gy of religion). This close link results, among other things, from the fact that the process of the development or spread of ideas is in reality a proc- ess involving actualized ideas. Though ideas may gain an inherent power, according to Weber they can only spread and become effective over the long run if they are propagated by established strata and become institu- tionalized. Indeed this link between ideas and those who advance them is so close as to be indissoluble, which leads to difficult demarcation problems when it is a matter of determining the type of influence - direct or indirect - exerted by the two sets of variables. This problem gave Weber considerable trouble particularly in his sociol- ogy of law. Though he never questioned the direct influence of propagat- ing strata, his opinion as regards the direct influence of political condi- tions was not always so unambiguous as in his analysis of the formation of a "logical utopia of law" against the background of a comparison be- tween continental and Anglo-American legal developments. True, this comparison relates to a relatively high developmental stage of legal ra- tionality, which corresponds to a high degree of differentiation in the area of political conditions. The comparison also includes a mention of the indirect, weak effect of economic structures, in this case those of capitalism, which are brought in with the aid of the argument to calcula- bility, a factor that on the Continent was assured by the fiction of logical stringency and in England by that of historical continuity by precedent. A further link was found in the economic interests of the middle classes.</page><page sequence="42">850 Weber's differentiated view of economic influence (as can be seen in his essay on Roman and German law, written in 1895 for Christliche Welt),227 can be traced back to his appreciation of the "peculiar effect" of sophisticated legal techniques, that is, their tendency to work in favor of the economically privileged. He took this tendency into account in or- der to skirt the dangerous circumstance "that the symptoms of economic phenomena are frequently confused with their reasons."228 As so of- ten, here again Weber advanced an argument that bristled with recipro- cal effects of a very complex kind: This is not to say that the social tendencies contained in those shifts of economic power would not perhaps have been strengthened by the legal forms in which they were clothed, in this case by Roman law. Rather, that was doubtless the case. Nor can there be any question that the application of Roman law had decisive effects even in those cases where it was not put consciously in the service of class interests but taken over on account of its higher technical perfection - not because it was "Roman" but because it was in a juristic and technical sense more perfect. These effects rested on a general axiom that applies not only to the law. Improvements in technology tend initially to favor the economically better off, and what holds for tooling technology holds as well for law.229 Both in religion and in the field of law, Weber traced the final products of the two processes of rationalization - Karma and predestination in the first case, and a formal, rational casuistry accompanied by a formal, ra- tional legal system in the second - back to a special constellation of fac- tors that, in the shape of propagating stratum and political conditions, he classified according to the predominant configurations of order (whereby some of these factors were dependent variables). It would ap- pear that Weber's explanation was based on the assumption that both the sociocultural level (covered here by the concept of propagating stra- tum) and the level of political conditions possessed an autonomous potential for innovation that was largest when the level-specific factors had achieved a certain constellation with respect to one another. This constellation was most favorable to innovation leaps when field-specific and field-transcending tensions had built up. This assumption was involved with Weber's view that rationalization processes take place independently of one another, specifically to certain fields, and follow their own inherent laws. He saw his view confirmed by, among other things, the historic fact that rational law did not emerge in England, the country that produced capitalism, but in Rome. Thus it is no accident that more recent theoretical efforts have seen the mutual interpenetration of such field-specific processes as the characteristic trait of Western rationalization.230</page><page sequence="43">851 Religious and legal rationalization processes are processes of disen- chantment and systematization, which evince clearly distinguishable de- velopmental stages. Weber himself outlined the stage-model to charac- terize the religious rationalization process. Above, following Bellah, Schluchter, and Tenbruck, we called Weber's attempt at reconstructing the religious rationalization process a "minimal program in evolutionary theory," and the main reason for this was the orientation of his stage- model to the paradigm of an inner compulsion towards rationalization. Weber did stipulate developmental stages of legal rationalization that were subject to the dialectic of formal and substantial rationality, a dialectic process in which intrajuristic (propagating strata) and extra- juristic factors (especially political conditions) were equally involved in aiding formal rationalization to victory "over law-immanent and law- transcendent substantive rationalization."231 Yet what Weber's theory of legal development lacks are premises of the kind he stipulated, in his "Introduction," for the religious rationalization process. What it lacks above all is a developmental foil comparable to the development of the theodicy problem, a foil that the idea of natural law cannot supply. A number of impressive attempts have been made to reconstruct the le- gal rationalization process,232 which interestingly enough take Weber's sociology of domination as their point of departure; yet these attempts give little or no weight to the concept of propagating strata (and Schluchter moreover employs the Kohlberg scheme of preconventional, conventional, and postconventional stages, which we have rejected). Like every logical rationalization process both the religious and legal processes trigger irrationalities "with the necessity of fate" (L6with). The main expression of this is that religion, once a central force in life, is in- creasingly displaced from the rational realm into that of the irrational, and that formal, rational law releases a tendency to a re-substantiation of law. With this theme, Weber left a problem for the sociology of law the investigation of which will have to go far beyond his beginnings.

G. Wagner and H.

T. Burger, Max Weber's Theory of Concept Formation (Durham, N.C.: Duke Univ. Press, 1976). G. Wagner and H.

In this essay Schluchter deals with F. H. Tenbruck's theses on the history of Weber's work ("Das Werk Max Webers," Kolner Zeitschrift fur Soziologie und Sozialpsychologie 27 (1975), 663-702), the va- lidity of which he puts in great doubt. However, Tenbruck's theses are regarded as a correct interpretation of the history of Weber's work by those English-speaking authors who are unable to read the original German texts (F. H. Tenbruck, "The Problem of Thematic Unity in the Works of Max Weber," British Journal of Sociol- ogy 27 (1980), 316-351); cf. ed. W.

On the thought about the consequence, illustrated by the example of Weber's sociol- ogy of music, compare W. Schluchter, "Weltfliichtiges Erlosungsstreben und or- ganische Sozialethik.

The application of the three explanatory levels (propagating strata/political condi- tions/economic conditions) as the ordering scheme would raise the consistency of the representation if the comparison also covered the dimension as regards content of the sociology of religion and of law. However, the two explanatory models are the subject of this analysis, so that it is not acceptable to use the categories on which they are based for the purposes of systematization of this article. 30.

Bellah, "Religious Evolution," American Sociological Review 29 (1964), 358-374, has undertaken an attempt of this kind to reconstruct the development of religion in terms of an evolutionary scheme, which in turn has been critically ana- lyzed by R. Dobert, Systemtheorie und die Entwicklung religioser Deutungssysteme (Frankfurt: Suhrkamp, 1973). As the reception of Kohlberg's work has shown, Bel- lah's statement had considerable repercussions. His procedure: "is a theoretical con- struction against which historical facts may be illuminated. The logic is much the same as that involved in conceptualizing stages of the life cycle in personality de- velopment" (ibid., 361). This point has since been taken up and followed by J.

Habermas, Theorie, attempted to solve this paradox by suggesting a change of paradigms - from instrumental reason to communicative reason. Habermas's theory of communicative action attempts, via a specific reception of the classics based on Piaget's decentration theory, to approach the rationalization potential present in the structures of capitalistic society via a con- ceptual and practical coupling of life world and system, while simultaneously decolonizing the life world from the dominant integration mechanisms of the politi- cal and economic subsystems - power and money. As B. Freitag, "Theorie des Kom- munikativen Handelns und Genetische Psychologie," Kolner Zeitschrift fur Sozio- logie und Sozialpsychologie 35 (1983), 555-576, 570f, has convincingly shown, the apparently compelling notion of a homology between ontogenesis and sociogenesis based on Piaget (or Kohlberg) leads to a number of problems, e.g. to a personifica- tion of society, or to a belief in progress as represented in the history of species or theory, which can be traced back to a "mechanistic" projection of psychogenetic stages onto the process of social development and the development of scientific thought, as well as back to the "built-in" optimism of child psychogenesis, which is increased even more by Piaget's cybernetic view of the process. Under these cir- cumstances misinterpretations of historical processes are not unlikely. It is worth recalling at this juncture that Max and Alfred Weber largely agreed in their evalua- tions of the negative consequences of bureaucratization. If Max Weber cautioned against the emergence of "regulation-men" who like Chinese mandarins made a per- fection of the status quo the first maxim of their behavior (cf. GASSp, 413f), Alfred Weber feared the type of person created by bureaucracy and who might be character- ized as "German, faithful, and eligible for a pension" - to borrow from a 1909 caricature by Olaf Gulbransson in Simplicissimus, where the young lady says: "I'll only love a man who's German and faithful and blond and eligible for a pension." A fundamental source here is an essay entitled "The Official," published 1910 by Alfred Weber in Die Neue Rundschau, where, similarly to Alexis de Tocqueville (1833), he described "how a huge machine looms up in our lives... how the popular mind adjusts to this machine." As A. Lange-Kirchheim, "Franz Kafka 'In der Straf- kolonie' und Alfred Weber 'Der Beamte,' " Germanisch-Romanische Monatsschrift N.F. 27 (1977), 202-221, has shown, Franz Kafka's story "In the Penal Colony" was inspired by his university supervisor Alfred Weber's essay, both in terms of content and style. This criticism of an impersonal bureaucratic machine articulates a wide- spread dissatisfaction with society via which it flows into general cultural criticism, which has much in common with the reflections of a late-bourgeois consciousness.

Taking as an example the reception of Roman law, which "created a new stratum of legal honoratiores, the legal scholars who, on the basis on an education in legal literature, had graduated from a university with a doctor's diploma" (WuG, 491 (853)), Weber again demonstrated the relationship between "literary" training (the academic model) and the specific formal, rational quality of the law. Compared to the academic model of the Imperial Age, the literary training of the universities in the (Continental) West that received the Roman law, represented a qualitative leap that affected the formal qualities of law - initially in the direction of an increasing abstraction of the legal institutions themselves, then in terms of creating purely sys- tematic categories (WuG, 491 (854)) from which to argue deductively. This specific form of legal logic (WuG, 492 (855)) furthered a conception of law as a logically clear system of rules, free of contradiction and without gaps (WuG, 394, 504 (656)). 149. WuG, 456 (787). 150. WuG, 457 (789); there can be no doubt that this formal and positivistic notion of law implies what is known as "conceptual jurisprudence." Cf. G. Abramowski, Das Geschichtsbild Max Webers (Stuttgart: Klett, 1966), 144, note 82. Abramowski ex- plains Weber's bias toward a strictly formalistic and positivistic jurisprudence in terms of his conception of science and his view that positivistic legal formalism guarantees "an optimum of legal security and of 'calculable', consistent, objective application of law 'without respect of person'" (ibid., 144). He supports this argu- ment by two references to Weber: first, by reporting that Weber, in a discussion, once cited Ihering as having said of formal justice that "form was the enemy of arbitrariness, and the twin sister of freedom" (GASSp, 480); and second, by citing Weber's review of P. Lotmar, Der Arbeitsvertrag, vol. 1, in Archiv fur soziale Gezetsgebung und Statistik 17 (1902), 723-734; summarized in Baumgarten, "Max Weber," 440f. 151. WuG, 458 (789). 152. WuG, 395f (656f). This four-field table is a classification scheme, that is, the sepa- rate fields stand for classes and not scales, as D. Trubek, "Max Weber on Law and the Rise of Capitalism," Wisconsin Law Review 3 (1972), 720-753, 729, mistakenly assumed. The fields can be related to the theoretical developmental stages of law giv- en by Weber (WuG, 503): Field B to the stage of charismatic revelation of law; Field C to the takeover of law by secular imperium and theocracy; Field Aa to that of em- pirical legislation and adjudication by legal honoratiores; and Field Ab to the stage of systematic codification by trained jurists. Field D has proven useful to provide a limit between modern law and pre-modern law. 153. WuG, 395 (657).</page><page sequence="51">859 154. WuG, 395, 492, 504; H. J.

WuG, 509 (890). 156. General political conditions basically include the following: 1. type of political pow- er relationships (a dimension of structure of domination); 2. the power relationship between theocratic and secular powers (decisive among other things for the opportu- nity for the divergence of 'sacred' and profane law); and 3. variations in structure of legal honoratiores responsible for shaping the law, influenced by 1 (WuG, 504). In the case of this last factor particularly, it is extremely difficult to distinguish be- tween intrajuristic and extrajuristic conditions. Evidently, the sociologies of law and domination belong together. 157. Schluchter, Die Entwicklung, 136f. 158. WuG, 426 (687f). 159. WuG, 663 (977); 448 (721); 508 (889). 160. GPS, 522 (93). 161.

With one exception: Weber attributed a high potential for rationalization to the administration-type organization of the Catholic church (WuG, 467, 479f, 799, 804). 170. WuG, 677 (1001). A number of references can be cited in support of this statement, for instance: WuG, 488f (850), 490f (853). 171. GARS I, 438 (China, 150). 172. WuG, 467, 468f (809f). 173.
