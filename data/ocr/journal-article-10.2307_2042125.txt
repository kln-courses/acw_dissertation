We show that if there is no family of cardinality less than c which dominates ', then the box product of countably many compact first-countable spaces is paracompact; hence the countable box product of compact metrizable spaces is paracompact if 2w = W2. We also give classes of forcing extensions in which many box products are paracompact. 0. Introduction. In the last six years there have been many proofs showing that various classes of countable box products were consistently paracompact. The methods of these proofs are two: the tree argument used by van Douwen, and the stratification argument used by everyone else. Here we generalize the latter technique to show: THEOREM 0. (a) If no family of cardinality less than c dominates 's, then the box product of countably many compact first-countable spaces is paracompact. (b) If C = W2, then the box product of countably many compact metrizable spaces is paracompact. We then generalize the method further to show that a simplified version of the principle implicit in [Ro] also implies that the box product of countably many compact first-countable spaces is paracompact. From this we find a wide class of forcing extensions in which various box products are paracom- pact, thus pointing out where not to look in trying to give a negative answer to the following open questions: A. Is [LJ"o + 1) paracompact? B. Does the existence of a X-scale for some X imply that the countable box product of compact first-countable spaces is paracompact? Thanks are due to William Mitchell and Saharon Shelah who pointed out that the proofs in this paper did more than they were expected to do. 1. Preliminaries. All spaces are assumed to be Hausdorff. A space X is paracompact iff every open covering of X has a locally finite refinement. The lettersf, g, h are reserved for functions from w to w; A, B for infinite subsets of . Let I be an index set, Xi a topological space for each i E I. Then the box product [li , Xi consists of all points in HiiE, Xi under the topology whose Received by the editors February 6, 1978 and, in revised form, May 1, 1978.

If x = &lt;xi: i &lt;w&gt; andy =K&lt;y1: i &lt;w&gt; are in ~ C&lt;,, Xi, we say x _y iff {i: yi # xi} is finite. Vi C Xi is the quotient topology on the equivalence classes of Ei,, Xi generated by-. The connection between g and V, and the reasons V is nice to work with, are made clear by the following theorem of Kunen: THEOREM 1 (KUNEN). (a) If each Xi is compact, then Ei , Xi is paracompact iff V, I, Xi is paracompact. (b) G8's in any V1, X, are open; hence if each Xi is regular, the G8's of V, E,X, are clopen, and the space is 0-dimensional. (c) V, E, Xi is paracompact iff every open cover has an open disjoint covering refinement (such a space is called ultraparacompact). Because of Kunen's theorem, for the rest of this paper we work with V, and will prove that under various circumstances V, , Xi is paracompact, where each X, is regular. The reader can then conclude that if each Xi satisfies the desired hypotheses and is also compact, then gi , Xl is paracompact as well. The connection between V and the structure of 'ww is made clear by the following notation and definitions. Suppose, for each i E w, Xi is first countable. For each xi E Xi, we fix ux a function from w such that { ux (j): j E w} is a descending neighborhood basis for xi. Then givenf: w -&gt; wand x E ViE, X,, we define uxf = ViE, u" Xi)). Given f, g, A, we say f &lt; g on A iff { i E A: f (i) zk g(i)} is finite. Then the following fact is immediate: FACT 2. If x, y E V, E-, X, and f, g E Ww, then letting C = {i: ux (f(i)) n uy(g(i)) =0), C is infinite iff uf Xn uy,g =0; and if uf n uyg =0 and h &lt; f on C, then ux,h n uy,g = 0. The careful reader will observe in the preceding sentence a slight confusion of events in FIXi and VX,. Such confusions will continue to occur for the sake of readability. F c (ww is a dominating family iff for every f E (wh there is some g E C, g &lt; f on w. A X-scale is a dominating family well ordered by &lt; of order type X. The space w + 1 is the order type w + 1 under the interval topology. Wewrite 6Da, 6D, a &lt; X,iff 6D = U a&lt;X 6Da and a &lt;K &gt; / D C 6 2. Combinatorial proofs. In this section we state two combinatorial princi- ples and prove that they establish paracompactness. DEFINITION 3. Let 6Y c @w, C c ' (w). We say F is cofinal on C iff for every f there exists an A c eB and a g E 6 such that g &gt; f on A. The principle (*) says: If I f 1, I C I &lt; c, then 6 is not cofinal on C. FACT 4. (*) is equivalent to the assertion that there is no dominating family of cardinality &lt; c.</page><page sequence="3">MORE PARACOMPACT BOX PRODUCTS 173 PROOF. One direction is trivial. We prove the not-quite-so-trivial direction. Suppose (*) is false via C, C and we have some g E t%o. We may assume that each function in 6 is increasing. There exists an f E C, and an A E C, with f &gt; g on A. Suppose A = { ao, a,, . . . } in increasing order. Define h to be constantly equal to f(a, +) on the interval [an, a,,+, ). Then h &gt; g on w and there can be at most 16 l I C I &lt; c such h's. Notes on (*). 1. (*) =X there is no X-scale, for X &lt; c. 2. By Fact 4, (*) is true if there is a c-scale and c is regular, hence under MA. By Fact 4 and Theorem 1, Theorem 0 (a) will be proved by the following THEOREM 5. (*) implies that Vi E Xi is paracompact if each Xi is first countable, Lindelof, and regular. PROOF. By a well-known theorem of Arhangel'skii, each Xi has cardinality &lt; c, hence X = Vi C Xi has cardinality c. We construct a refinement of a given cover 91 by an induction of length c. Suppose we have assigned X some well ordering of type c and have already covered the first ,B elements of X by clopen sets, where this covering 91/3 refines 91, I 9e I &lt; f I &lt; c, and each vE9I3 is of the formn uyf, where {f: i E w} is an increasing sequence. Let x be the next point we have to cover. If x is already covered, we simply let q/31, = + Otherwise, for each v E 91/3 we can find a gv so that Ux,g n v =0. Hence, where v = ni i, uyf, we can find an iv so that UX'g" n Uyj =0 (this is because thef's are increasing). Hence by Fact 2, Av = { k: uxk( gv (k)) n uyk(fil (k)) =0) is infinite. By hypothesis we can find a single h so that for every v E 91, gv jk h on AV. Hence by Fact 2, UXh n v =0 for all v E9= . Let hi be an increasing sequence, ho = h. We let 91+I = 91 U { n i e ux,h } Theorem 0 (b) then follows from Theorem 5 by the following theorem of van Douwen: if there is a X-scale for some ordinal X, then the countable box product of compact metrizable spaces is paracompact. PROOF OF 0 (b). Assume c = 02. If (*) is false, then there is a dominating family of size ol, which is easily seen to contain an w1-scale. So we are either in the situation of Theorem 5, or the hypothesis of van Douwen's theorem. (*) is a statement about wo and the power set of c; no topological spaces are mentioned. (*) is also implicitly a statement about VlW(wo + 1): it says that: (t) there is a basis J3 so that the union of less than c sets from Ji is closed. The proof of Theorem 5 is also a proof that (t) holds for any Vi,, Xi, if each Xi is first countable, Lindelof, and regular. For our next principle we are not so lucky. We need to know about more than the structure of @ and the power set of w. We want a method of proof that stratifies a space X under consideration so that we may simultaneously</page><page sequence="4">174 JUDY ROITMAN cover each layer. Therefore we do not have a general combinatorial principle, but one which depends on the particular space. DEFINITION 6. Let X = View X,. (**)x is the statement that for some ordinal A there exist X?X, a &lt;A; c&lt;, '(4), a &lt;A; C- , a &lt;A; and 6 = {fa: a &lt;A}) c wsuch that (l)a &lt; /3 = f1 E (2)f EC a2, A E d of Xfa onA, (3)f, g E a f + g E Ca, (4) X&lt;, is Hausdorff under the topology generated by all u, f, where x e X,, f E CO, (5) if x,y E Xa,f,g E C, and u~[fn uyg =0, then {i: uf((i)) n uy(g(i)) 0) Ec a. Notes on (**)x. 1. Clauses 3, 4, and 5 simultaneously stratify X, %,, and Cf (X) so that if we only know about the functions and sets on the ath layer, we already know that X is Hausdorff. Clauses 1 and 2 connect this stratifi- cation with a sequence of functions which may not be dominating, but which no level can dominate. 2. (**)x is a simplified version of the combinatorics in [Ro]. 3. (*) implies (**)x if X = V1^ Xi and each Xi is first countable, Lindelof, and regular. Also the existence of a A-scale for some A implies (**)x if X = V'(W + 1). 4. As the complication of Definition 6 and the anthropomorphism of Note I indicate, (**)x is designed to tell us when a forcing extension makes box products paracompact. THEOREM 7. Let X = Vi, Xi, where each Xi is regular and first countable. Then (**)x implies that X is paracompact. PROOF. Again we proceed by induction, this time on the A of Definition 6. Let '7t be an open covering of X. Suppose at stage a &lt; A we have covered a subset of U,&lt;,,a X,3 by a disjoint refinement qta of 1t, where each v E (?- is clopen and of the form nfl ,, u,nf for some x E U#f&lt;aT X1, f E Ua / ta (and nf(j) = n f(j) for all j c ). Let 'V be the collection of all uyg. for y E Xa, g 6 Ca, By (**)x, 'V separates points in X. If y 6 Xa has not been covered yet, let h &gt; fa where uy refines a neighborhood in 1\1, hy E a,+ I, if such an hy exists. (The problem is that no candidate for hy may be in C(, 1.) If hy exists, let uy = nn u,yn and let G?la+I = 1a U {uy: y E Xa- U3?la and h5 is defined). Clauses 2, 4, and 5 of the definition guarantee that 9ta+I is a disjoint refinement. Clause 3 says that each nhy is in Ca2+i. That everyy is eventually covered follows from 1, 3, and the fact that Ca? 'ho. 3. Forcing extensions. In what models of set theory do (*) and (**)x hold? We partially answer this question with two propositions, the first a simple criterion for (*), and the second a criterion for (**)x. We give examples in each category so the reader will know what we are talking about.</page><page sequence="5">MORE PARACOMPACT BOX PRODUCTS 175 First, some definitions. Let B be a complete Boolean algebra. B has K-CC iff every set of mutually incompatible elements has cardinality &lt; K. Note that K &lt; X and B has K-cc =&gt; B has X-cc. The density of B, d(B), is the least cardinality of a dense partial order in B. B has cofinality 3 iff there is a sequence of algebras Ba A B, a &lt; X, where cf(X) = 3 and each Ba is a complete proper subalgebra of B. Note that the cofinality of B is not unique. Let V be a model of set theory, B E V, and {Ba: a &lt; X} E V be a witness that B has cofinality 3. We define V0 = V, and Va = VB_ c VB for a &gt; 0. A functionf in VB is free over Va iff for every A, g E V, f &lt; g on A. Otherwise f is dominated by Va. VB is dominated by Va iff every f in VB is dominated by Va. Otherwise VB is free over Va. A peculiar aspect of forcing is that V often knows the size of the continuum in VB. That is, there is usually a K E V SO that V z K = cV. Call this cardinal cB. LEMMA 8. Suppose V t [B has cofinality cB and VB is free over all Va]. Then (*) holds in VB. PROOF. If (*) fails, there is a dominating family which is contained in some Va, contradicting the freedom of VB. EXAMPLES. 1. Any direct iterated wl-cc B with cofinality d(B)w. 2. Mixing things up: e.g. CH is true in each Va, 3 = 02, and each B,a is a product or iteration of two algebras, one adding at least one free function, the other adding no new reals. Mathias and Laver forcing are examples. LEMMA 9. Suppose V k [B has K+ -cc and cofinality 3 &gt; K+; VB is free over all Va]. Then (**)x holds in VBfor every X = Vi, Xi where each Xi is regular, first countable with weight &lt; 3. PROOF. The point of the hypothesis on 3 is that we can then repeat the construction of [Ro] to stratify X into Xa's. A sketch of the construction is: To each Xi we associate Li, the lattice of basic open sets. By hypothesis, each Li is small enough so any countable descending chain is an element of some Va. We identify a point in Xi with some countable descending chain converging to it. Then (Xi)a is the collection of such chains which are elements of Va; Xa = Va n V i Ew (Xi) a i @ n VB and 0'(X) n VB are already stratified by the Va's, and this natural stratification, together with the Xa's as above, makes clauses 3, 4, and 5 of (**)x true. Because VB is free, we can find an 6Y satisfying clause 2; we can then skip up the levels to satisfy 1. EXAMPLES. 1. Any direct wl-cc extension with uncountable cofinality. 2. B = C x D, C stratifies so that it is free over each VC_xD = Va, and every real is in some Va. Candidates for such C's are wl-cc algebras, and for the associated D good candidates are Solovay, Sacks, or Silver forcing which</page><page sequence="6">176 JUDY ROITMAN all have the property that new functions in 'w are dominated by old functions. 3. B is an iteration C * D, and defining Da = {p: Vc' k p E Da), each real occurs in some V, = Vc'xD- and VC is free over each VJ. The same candidates for C and D in 2 are candidates here, although care must be taken so that Ca x DaA/ B. Looking at these and other examples, the following questions occur: C. Must reals be added to destroy paracompact box products? (Yes if, say, (*) or "there is a X-scale" hold in the ground model. What about other cases?) D. Can an xl-cc extension by itself destroy paracompact box products? BIBLIOGRAPHY [A] A. V. Arhangel'skii, On the cardinality of bicompacta satisfying the first axiom of counta- bility, Dokl. Akad.
