All those frivolities of summer, the light and shadow, the living mask of green that trembled over everything, they were lies, and this is what was underneath. This is the truth.' - Willa Cather, in My Antonia The Nebraska prairie is more than just a backdrop for the action in many of the novels of Willa Cather; it participates in that action. Like man, the prairie is terrible and beautiful at the same time. In My Antonia we can't ignore the tragedy that exists or originates in the most beautiful settings and events. Antonia is beautiful and optimistic, yet she has to work like a man in the fields. Her brother goes mad; her father commits suicide; her Russian immigrant neighbors hide their past as murderers; she herself loses an illegitimate child. Antonia grows old and her beauty fades, yet the red grasslands bloom each spring, the blizzards howl in the winter, the children grow toward the sun; they go to town and fall ¡in love or remain on the prairie, dying from the elements or poverty. People and nature seem to absorb a bit of each other: The windy springs and the blazing summers, one after another, had enriched and mellowed that flat tableland; all the human effort that had gone into it was coming back in long sweeping lines of fertility. The changes seemed beautiful and harmonious to me; it was like watching the growth of a great man or of a great idea 1 Artists perceive in extreme natural surroundings a vital kind of geography. In Cather, it motivates, enfolds, and reflects the people. The emphasis is not on the heroism of battling the elements but the recognition and mutual participation of living with them: never is there outright despair at the primitive environment; the wildest blizzard surrounds Antonia s father's suicide and a quiet Christmas celebration alike. It is enough if man can, like Thoreau, rejoice that his hut has no yard or fence, but is part of unfenced nature itself. The application of moral laws to nature, as in Wordsworth, is only done to the extent that they are recognized in man himself. Nature is not supremely indifferent as long as man is not. We can only regard it the way G. K. Chesterton regarded truth: we never come so near to a well-rounded view of things as when we see them paradoxically. Because of space and natural environment we can recognize the 251</page><page sequence="3">importance of scene. The blasted heath in Macbeth is not merely a place where some witches happen to gather: it is their rightful habitat; it is the sort of context that produces witches; it is a symbol within the pattern of a play. Scene is not, as R. W. B. Lewis says: . . the simple ^geographical location of some thing, person, or act. but rather the qualitative and qualifying context. In the hands of the expert, the scene' can thus contain the act of the character - and can be substituted for either, or become a metaphor for either. 2 Before 1928 America had produced a number of films in which nature had played a major part in motivation and identification. Griffith's use of pastoral lyricism in True-Heart Susie and Romance of Happy Valley contrasted with the cathartic use of the snow storm in Way Down East a storm which at once reflected the turmoil between the outcast girl and the family, threw together the various divisive forces, and finally swept away the barriers between the characters. Thus, it both separated and (united , the | protagonists, providing solid drama along the way. William K. Howard's classic White Gold had Jetta Goudal isolated on a sheep ranch, the grand drama of passion enacted upon a stark and bare stage. William Beaudine made The Canadian in 1927 (a film similar to The Wind), utilizing a hail storm as the dominant force behind and within the action. And of course there were others like Henry King's Tol'able David and Ingram's Mare Nostrum. I'm even tempted to mention a slighter effort like Fairbanks Down to Earth (1917). where the restorative effects of natural surroundings cure all society's ills, both real and imagined. The Swedish director Victor SjcfetrÖm was concerned with aspects of "scene*' - as reflection, motivation, and symbol - in many of his films. This is particularly evident in The Wind ' made in 1 928. Earlier in Sweden he had made The Outlaw and His Wife , one of cinema's classic attempts to unite man and nature - not in some kind of fond embrace but more in the Cather sense of mutual participation. The coming of winter in Outlaw reflects not only the crushing nature of the elements upon man. but also the steadily stiffening distrust and animosity between the once-happy couple as they try to flee the village to seek moral and territorial refuge in the mountains. The subtle relationship between the human and natural order constitutes the value of the film; i.e., their desire for freedom motivates their flight to the mountains; that environment provides their refuge but - because of its isolating tendency - turns them back upon themselves toward mutual suspicion and dread. Before our eyes we see the innocence of an idyll destroyed. The snow that swirls and forms a shroud for them at the end is much like, as has been pointed out by Peter Cowie. the inexorable force of sand that unhinges Letty in The Wind. SjöstrÖm's Ter je Vigen. made one year earlier than Outlaw in 1916. sets its protagonist within a world of storms and the sea: here, too, they are his refuge and final judgment - only in this case they are his rejuvenation also. In both examples the scene actively shapes events and characters. Nature both identifies and reinforces events in Girl from Stormycroft. The film uses natural elements in a much more restrained and gentle manner than the other two films. The delicate bucolic breath that breathes over the whole of the film enables the slight tale of a young man's relationship with a young mother of an illegitimate child to proceed lyrically and unpretentiously. The quiet trust and faith found by two people is admirably felt in the quiet images of rustic countryside. The Wind takes place, oddly enough, not in the fastnesses of his beloved 252</page><page sequence="4">Sweden or Lappland, but in the windy deserts of western America. The natural elements are not comprised of steep cliffs and peaks, gorgeous valleys and waterfalls, quaintly dressed Swedes, and raging seas; the natural element here is invisible - wind. Moreover, the film is compounded of darkness; in fact, such a large part of it takes place in darkness that one sees hardly any scenery at all I Such audacity on the part of a scenic artist! One is reminded of Claude Debussy's little prelude for piano which, by means of a bare handful of notes, attempted to suggest or evoke "footprints in the snow." Well, this is Sjostró'm's "footprints in the sand' film. Seastrom's (to use his Americanized name) invisible wind has become a real and challenging presence. When Letty Mason (Lillian Gish) arrives at a whistle-stop town in the middle of a vast, windy desert, she exclaims. "My. this wind is awful isn't it? I wish it would stop." At once we meet the two antagonists. Letty and the desert wind square off immediately with her opening statement; the struggle begins. Antagonists they stay until the end of the film. In another five minutes we are introduced to the secondary characters. Lige Hightower, the cowboy (portrayed by Lars Hanson, a favorite actor used many times by Seastrom in Sweden) and the "city man," Wirt (Montague Love). Wirt, incidentally is one more in that series of movie rascals in the Twenties who swooped in from the decadent city to lure winsome heroines into moral ruin - another prime example being Lennox Sanderson in Griffith's Way Down East. Letty has come to live with a cousin and his wife and children. After a brief stay she is forced to look elsewhere for shelter because her cousin's wife grows jealous of her, imagining some sort of liaison between Letty and her husband. Letty's search for shelter forces her hand, and she accepts the proposal of the cowboy Lige. The marriage is a loveless one. Because of her frigidity their relations grow worse and the wind grows stronger, as Letty's delicate sensibilities begin to erode. Enter Wirt, whom Lige has found injured from a fall and has brought to the house to convalesce. While Wirt is there a terrific storm comes up, and he and Lige leave to recapture some strayed cattle. Wirt secretly returns and in a night of violence assaults Letty. She shoots him and tries to bury him beneath the blowing sands. When the wind persists in uncovering the body, she goes mad. Nothing less than the invisible wind is made animate and tangible throughout. Every device possible is employed to provide this effect; there are visual metaphors, wherein the wind is personified first as a wild animal, then as Letty herself, and finally as her guilt. The wind is further defined through its function, in its effects on things and people. And finally it is visualized through camera technique and frame displacement. Use of the visual metaphor occurs throughout. An early title likens the wind to a great, careering stallion, and we see a series of ghostly double exposures of a fiery white horse rearing through the clouds. Later this symbol of wild and free fury, this near anthropomorphic treatment of an elemental force, is ex- tended to Letty herself, as when the burning image is superimposed over her face in the climactic moments of the film. This metaphoric treatment of a horse galloping through the heavens is incomparably superior to a similar effect in Ingram's Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Under Seastrom's hands the image seems to burn as if it were shot in negative; the coordinated fury of its galloping seems caught in slow motion. The introductory shots of the train arriving at night seem to give form to the wind. The blowing white dust defines the silhouette of the train with tunnel 253</page><page sequence="5">shapes of cloud, just as the characters are continually surrounded by rough mantles of blowing dust. In many other ways is the wind intensely visual. It is felt by its function. In this way it is present at all times, even when the action is inside. When Letty brushed dust off the wedding bed, we feel at once not only the pervading presence of the wind, but also recognize an effective symbol for the sterility of her marriage with Lige. The total permeation of the element into her life is implied. In the climactic scenes the implied presence of the wind is most effectively felt, not only through its effects on material objects, but through a masterful treatment of the camera and the frame. Wirt's return to the house and his attack on Letty seem to unhinge the whole frame from its supports. The entire frame seethes and sways. The single slatted lamp sways in the darkness, the striped shadows crawling over Letty's huddled form. We seem to float in a series of dizzying arcs; her form slowly appears at the corner of the titled frame, then moves away as if floating aimlessly in a vortex. All anchors are loosed; there is only a kind of freefall, of vertigo. ,We are one with Letty, and for us, as well as for her, the wind has swept away all supports of gravity; we exist in a silent and slow vacuum. As if by accident, fluid and offhand camera movement catches her swaying form as well as the movement of the lamp and the shadows, conveying the final shattering control the wind exercises over her. Complete fantasy takes over and the interior seems to crumple and break up before our eyes, as if shaken apart by some vast supernatural agent. The sequence culminates in a series of dissolves of the interior and her swaying form to fantastic slow-motion shots of the aforementioned galloping stallion. Everything has led to this final unification of her mind with the elemental force of the wind. It is a striking metamorphosis. In superb contrast to the fury that went before it, the mute eloquence of the following sequence conveys a cold kind of madness. It is morning after Wirt's vicious assault and Letty's final breakdown. The first shot is a high-angle dolly moving in and down upon the back of her head to a holstered pistol lying in dust on the table. The dust, our inability to see her face, her motionlessness, the pointed observation of the camera, overwhelm us with its cumulative suggestive power. The complete silence and quiet of the scene provide one last respite before the wind's final bow, as it were, when all suggestion and metaphor are dropped and the wind, like a master thief in a melodrama, doffs its disguises and strides to center stage toward the denouement. This is of course the most famous scene in the film, when Letty's attempts to bury Wirt's body are thwarted by the wind. Her back to us, we see the shovel lifting and falling past her shoulder, the sand and dusting arching up from it in little spurts. Then we see her face pressed against the window pane watching in stupefaction as the blowing wind slowly reveals Wirt's face underneath a layer of sand. It's as if Wirt were partially submerged in a running sea, as if something has ascended from the depths. of a nightmare and were taking form before us. The wind, through magnificent indifference (or in moral judgment) to Letty, reveals her deed. The wind seems human, to act with a purpose, to have knowledge we don't, to use that knowledge to both reveal and destroy. We are enlightened while Letty goes mad. At the same time the wind represents her inability to escape her act, that moment in all our lives when fears long submerged begin to take familiar shape again. Seastrom's treatment of the wind has proceeded inexorably from the opening visual metaphor of the stallion, to the linking of that stallion with Letty in the afore- 254</page><page sequence="6">mentioned series of dissolves, and to the final identification of it with her conscience. That the wind has assumed this moralistic role along with its other motivational and identifying ones - that it is now a cathartic element in Letty's mind - represents the film's peak achievement. As I pointed out earlier, nature has become not only the geographical location that surrounds her, but the dramatic and transforming element of the narrative. In this way it is fully Seastrom's work, linking indirectly with the earlier Outlaw and His Wife. Although the tacked-on ending at first seems ludicrous, it does fulfill the Catheresque idea that acceptance means sanity and life. Letty's frigidty was a brittle kind of barrier like her defiance of the wind. The wind's revelation of Wirt's buried body breaks that symbolic resistance. One might fancifully imagine a cold blast churning its way through her, or a white light dispelling an attic's shadows and cobwebs. When Lige returns, he calms her and they stand together in the doorway facing into the wind. It whips her hair back and billows her skirts. As it plays about her, molding the skirts to her slim body, we experience the light-headed feeling that a nightmare has recently been exorcised. It is not the same wind that evoked Letty's opening exclamation: it gently enfolds her body now; it is almost as if through her own transformation it, too, were subtly changed. It is one of the strangest victories in cinema. Sometimes the farthest vistas of nature tell us something about the neighbor next door. When an artist reveals the participation and interaction of man and nature, he deals with an ever-changing aspect. So, too, is the wind an ambiguous presence, its lineaments ever changing as it moves over and defines form. It is capable of all shapes, just as truth finds its many expressions. John C.
