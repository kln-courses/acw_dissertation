<plain_text><page sequence="1">Susan S. Lanser (Im)plying the Author Few terms have stirred narratologists to so much vexation?and passion?as implied authorship. Since Wayne Booth's coinage in the 1960s, the "implied author" has been attacked, defended, deconstructed, resurrected, refined, and redefined as theorists explore the structures and strategies through which texts mean.1 Debates have turned upon both parts of the coinage: we have asked whether there is an im plied author separate from a real one (or whether "author" already suffices to de scribe the entity readers construct as the originator of the text), and we have asked whether there is an implied author, an anthropomorphic persona (or simply an im personal structure of values and norms). And although theorists have tried repeatedly to put the term to rest, the author keeps getting "implied" even in essays that question it. My hope is less to resolve the debate than to suggest why we cannot resolve it, and to propose that moving beyond singular concepts of implied authorship might shift the conversation onto different if not less controversial ground. I will begin by observing that the persistence of the author in a supposedly post modern moment is not peculiar to narratology; despite the deconstructive challenges of such theorists as Michel Foucault and Roland Barthes, authorship still dominates the study and the consumption of literature. Devotees meet as the Pirandello Society, the Browning Institute, the Mark Twain Circle, the Friends of George Sand. Essays appear in The Age of Johnson, the Wordsworth Circle, and Studies on Voltaire and the Eighteenth Century. MLA panels explore "New Approaches to Boethius," "Faulkner at One Hundred," "Simone de Beauvoir and the Other," and "The Long Arm of Kant." Publishers insist there is no market for reprints of anonymous novels; fans flock to bookstore readings and line up for authors' autographs; scholars bitterly contest the authorship of Shakespeare's plays. In short, what Foucault called the Susan S. Lanser is Professor of Comparative Literature and English and Affiliate Professor of Women's Studies and French at the University of Maryland. She is the author of The Narrative Act, Fic tions of Authority, three editions, and numerous essays. She is currently completing a book on representa tions of female homoeroticism in the eighteenth century. NARRATIVE, Vol. 9, No. 2 (May 2001) Copyright 2001 by The Ohio State University</page><page sequence="2">154 Susan S. Lanser "author-function" still thrives as literature's "mode of existence, circulation, and functioning" despite efforts to dismantle and displace it. One consequence of this practice is the tautological constructions of author and text. I am likely to approach Roxana as a metonym of Daniel Defoe, creating Roxana through (my understanding of) Defoe and recreating Defoe through (my reading of) Roxana. If a possible Defoe manuscript turns up, I probably decide whether or not to accept it by comparing it to the "Defoe" I already know. And when an anonymous text frustrates my need for an author, I eagerly pursue potential candidates.2 Implied authorship has not saved us from this circularity. If Booth's formulation was de signed to evade biography, it nonetheless preserves the author-function by relocating it "inside" the text. Booth's implied author is a writer's "second self," "usually a highly refined and selected version, wiser, more sensitive, more perceptive than any real man could be" (Rhetoric 71-86, and "Distance" 87). The Company We Keep reinforces this notion by describing implied authors as "comradely companions," "gurus," and "friends" (185-87), a stance that makes Booth's argument for implied authorship strikingly like Genette's argument against it, for both posit a textual au thor who is the writer's truest self. This tautological relationship is not a critical failing; it is encouraged by the on tology of authorship. As the OED reminds us, an author is an "inventor" or "pro ducer" and thus definitionally tied to what gets produced; if texts exist only when there are authors, authors exist only when there are texts. This symbiosis, as several theorists have noted, produces the chicken-and-egg dilemma of authorship: having produced the text, the author must surely exist outside and before the text; yet if the text produces the author, then the author can only be found in the text. Further to complicate matters, this author who is everywhere is also nowhere, since the author in effect is the text rather than existing as an identifiable entity within it. Thomas Hobbes's Leviathan already articulated this tension in the seventeenth century, as England struggled with new questions of authority and representation in both its troubled government and its incipient print culture. Even as Hobbes tried to pin down the authority invested by "natural persons" (authors, representers) in their "ar tificial" representatives (actors, deputies), he exposed the tenuousness of representa tion as a guarantor of the repr?sentera intent. For authors can be known only through their "personations"; what they represent is what represents them.3 Thus the implied author is not?and by definition cannot be?a specific textual entity. Such a condition is understandably frustrating to narratologists, whose enter prise has been conceived through a careful attention to a text's formal and structural properties. If the implied author exists "in" a text, it exists as inferred and imagined: the implied author is a reading effect. This effect cannot be guaranteed, for the im plied author is essentially a matter of belief, existing only when and where readers construct it. This point was brought home to me at the 2000 SSNL conference when, following my presentation, Seymour Chatman put the issue to a vote: "How many of you," he asked the assembled scholars, "believe in the implied author?" If believers outnumbered skeptics two or three to one, we may recall Voltaire's comment that "Si Dieu n'existait pas, il faudrait l'inventer" (404). We can never settle the question of</page><page sequence="3">(Im)plying the Author 155 an implied author's existence because that existence is the effect of particular read ing practices in which some but not all readers believe and engage. I want to propose that not only the existence but the nature of implied author ship is a matter of belief, though I also suggest that texts manipulate?ply and imply?a range of strategies that may evoke different notions of authorship. Some texts or situations of reading may foster the sense of the deeply personified implied author that Booth imagined, while other texts or situations may imply the kind of au thorship Ansgar Niinning describes as an impersonal "totality of all formal and struc tural relationships in a text" (115). There may be individual readers who would construct more or less personified authors from the same text, and there may be texts that interpellate readers to read in one and not the others of these ways. For even if implied authorship operates through texts, its nature cannot be proven by texts. This does not mean, however, that we cannot attempt to specify conditions and conventions under which different kinds of implied authors are likely to be pro duced. In the brief space available here, I want to speculate that novel readers who believe in a personified author construct such an entity when the text does not thwart this construction. Such readers, I expect, build their conception of authorship incre mentally and fairly automatically while engaging in the other kinds of interpretive processes Barthes described in S/Z. As I read, I infer a sense of the author who could have produced this text, and through accretion and revision I attach to that image cer tain (moral, political, social, aesthetic, and/or personal) values, norms, perspectives, concerns. Any knowledge I may possess about the historical author and the cultural context operates in tandem or in tension with my reading, colluding, and colliding to produce my sense of the text's producer. And I am probably more conscious of this process when collisions rather than collusions occur. I want to speculate further, however, that for such readers this process is gov erned by an Ur-principle concerning the relation between the implied author and those personae (narrators, characters) formally inscribed in the text. I propose the following axiom that cuts against the grain of convention: that insofar as implied au thorship is a function of textual personae, under ordinary circumstances a text's im plied author will be associated with the persona(e) occupying the text's highest level(s) of authority. This authority is constructed from at least two hierarchical in dices, corresponding fairly well to what I named in The Narrative Act as "diegetic" and "mimetic" authority. Diegetic authority encompasses the type and level of narra tion, and I would argue that in the absence of countervailing conditions, extradiege sis will hold higher authority than intradiegesis, and heterodiegesis prevail over homodiegesis. Readers are thus more likely to equate the implied author with a voice both extradiegetic and heterodiegetic than with an intradiegetic and homodiegetic voice; certainly we have all been well trained to separate homodiegetic narrators from those who created them. I will nonetheless argue that where a text's highest level is homodiegetic and even intradiegetic, implied authorship will normatively be allied to the highest diegetic authority when conditions support it. Those conditions are a function of what I call "mimetic" authority, a second hi erarchy operating in tandem with, and probably outstripping, the first: the authoriza</page><page sequence="4">156 Susan S. Lanser tion emerging internally as the narrative establishes the credibility, wisdom, and reli ability of various narrators and characters. Voice(s) with the greatest mimetic author ity, I suggest, are more likely to be equated with, or to coconstruct, implied authorship; voices carrying both diegetic and mimetic authority will have the edge. I may construct an implied author not simply from one voice, but synthetically, from an amalgam of a narrator and a particular character, or dialogically, from the inter play among several characters, or privatively, from a negative or ironic rendering of diegetically authorized narrators or characters. In other words, a blend of diegetic and mimetic factors create pointers encouraging readers to identify authorial posi tions with particular narrators and characters or with specific aspects of these narra tors and characters. I think this process may operate even when I "know" that the historical author is different from the authorized narrator or character, for it is not that I believe one to be the same as the other, but that I accord the character(s) so privileged a relationship to the author's consciousness that I barely need to distin guish one from the other, even if I acknowledge that author and character have dif ferent textual functions and of course different ontologies. One might compare this process of authorization to the authority believers might invest in a religious leader, who is revered as (re)presenting God's word even if the believers "know" that she is not God and that God indeed created her; still, in inferring the qualities and values of divinity, we might well invent our God in her image. If I am right about this process, then even?or especially?autodiegetic narra tors may be more closely tied to implied authorship than we have wished to believe. Take, for example, crime writer Patricia Cornwell's best-selling novels, which fea ture Dr. Kay Scarpetta, chief medical examiner of Virginia and all-encompassing au todiegetic narrator whose voice is never superseded or displaced. We have been taught that such a narrator and her author must never be confused. But when both the movements of plot and the other characters repeatedly certify the narrator's author ity, what keeps readers from implying an author who "is" the narrator-character and whose norms are the narrator's norms? The Scarpetta books exploit just this link on their back covers, where Cornwell?who physically resembles Scarpetta?is pho tographed in scenes represented in the novels: she lingers on a Paris street in Black Notice, pores over law books in Unnatural Exposure, gazes from a Manhattan bridge in From Potter's Field, and stands before a helicopter in Point of Origin. And at the end of Scarpetta's Winter Table, Cornwell's kitschy Christmas story-cookbook, the text even produces the signature of JUapSav^etta, Jffl.53., as if to suggest that Scarpetta is the author of both the book and the recipes. Surely such practices encourage read ers to turn Kay Scarpetta into the author despite the ontological groundlessness for such a move. Perhaps, then, implied authorship?distinctly unlike real authorship? complicates the axiom that narrators are not to be equated with authors. This situa tion argues precisely for the differentiation between implied and real authors that Genette would disavow. This gap between real author and implied author is evoked for me in a provoca tive moment in Cornwell's Point of Origin (1998). Completing an errand in a hard ware store, Scarpetta overhears a conversation in which a store clerk advises an</page><page sequence="5">(Im)plying the Author 157 elderly man to "check with your doctor before using a snakebite kit." The customer retorts, "How the hell am I supposed to do that when I'm out in the middle of the woods?" at which point Scarpetta can no longer listen to their "backward logic" and delivers a medical lecture: "Snakebite kits are not only useless, but they're harmful," I said. "Tourni quets and local incision, sucking out the venom and all that just make matters worse. If you get bitten ... what you need to do is immobilize that part of your body, and avoid damaging first aid, and get to a hospital." The two men were startled.... "You some kind of doctor?" the clerk asked. "I've dealt with snake bites before." (318-19) Patricia Cornwell is not a physician, as any reader of the book's blurb will know. Yet here is Scarpetta authoritatively dispensing medical advice to ordinary people like those who read Cornwell's books. (There are similar pronouncements elsewhere, such as the advice in Unnatural Exposure about treating influenza.) This passage, with its potential for real-world authority, asks me to evaluate not only the narrator's but the implied author's expertise. It is as if "Cornwell" is impersonating Scarpetta by dispensing medical advice to the public; if Scarpetta is wrong, then the implied author has overreached her expertise. If the narrator is a doctor and the real author is not, which is the implied author, and what is the status of the narrator's medical ad vice? The passage itself brilliantly begs the question when Scarpetta, usually eager to assert her medical credentials, sidesteps the query "You some kind of doctor?" and thus evades a certain medical responsibility. But as a reader, I may need to con struct "Cornwell" as "some kind of" doctor in order to believe the text at all. Moments like this one, where the text's word has direct implications in the reader's world, may be particularly likely to bring implied authorship to conscious ness. So are moments in which an authorized voice that has implied itself into authorship confounds us with irreconcilable views. Narratologists have long maintained that an "implied" author is the property of a single text, and cannot be extrapolated to a writer's entire oeuvre; thus Booth argues that the "Fielding" of Tom Jones and the "Fielding" of Amelia are quite different entities. The "Cornwell" of various Cornwell novels is similarly variable, but I want to challenge the critical ten dency?my own previous work included?to assume that a text has a singular, co herent implied author, what Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan earlier called the "governing consciousness of the work as a whole" (86 emphasis mine). This notion of coherence has dominated the concept of authorship, although at least two recent writings?re spectively by Elizabeth Preston and by Ruth Ginsburg and Shlomith Rimmon Kenan?have mounted important challenges. I think we need to pass beyond the notion of the unified and coherent author in which Western culture has been invested at least since Hobbes, and recognize that implied authors can be?and perhaps more often are?multiple personalities. Cornwell's treatment in Black Notice of Scar petta's lesbian niece Lucy is a useful case in point.4 First the text sets up a broad minded Scarpetta, whose sidekick Pete Marino, once a "consummate bigot" (61), is</page><page sequence="6">158 Susan S. Lanser praised for accepting Lucy's sexuality. Later in the novel, however, Scarpetta is angry when her (thoroughly awful) sister Dorothy, who is also Lucy's mother, de scribes Lucy's as a "lesbian relationship," hardly a slur in 1999: "I wish you wouldn't use that word" [Scarpetta speaks]. "Well, that's what they are. Descended from the Amazon types on the island of Lesbos in the Aegean ..." "You ever heard of Sappho?" "Of course I've heard of him," Dorothy said. "She was a Lesbian because she lived on Lesbos. She was one of the great est lyric poets in antiquity." (259-60) Why does Scarpetta reach for a bizarrely antiquated authorization of Sappho as Great Poet and, in effect, nonlesbian? This passage ruptures my confidence not only in Scarpetta but in the author, and leads me to wonder what is at stake beyond the text; I construct from it a "Cornwell" who is much more distressed about lesbianism than the "Cornwell" who corrects Marino's bigotries. Trying to resolve either the narrator or the implied author into a single "general consciousness," let alone a "better self," or reaching for a simple charge of narrative unreliability, seems to me less productive than thinking about the different ideological clothing the author is trying on. If we forego the need for coherence that has dominated our discussions of im plied authorship, if we read textual surfaces instead of attempting to resolve them into a noncontradictory deep structure, we might figure the implied author not as a body but as the clothes the body wears?clothes that can be altered, discarded, tried on, changed before or behind our eyes. This need not mean that a particular writer is capable of producing an infinity of "implied authors," like an endless Barbie wardrobe, but that our current notion of implied author has been too small, too tight, too circumscribed. This is true whether we have conceived the implied author in per sonal or impersonal terms: the notion of "wholeness" has governed both arguments. The play in my title is meant to encourage the more multiple view?suggesting a plied and plying as well as /mplied and implying author producible in various and complicated versions by real writers and real readers as we ply our respective trades. Even to speak of the implied author, as I too have done here, is to structure author ship as a mass, as my allusions to divinity, however well they might describe a read ing practice, likewise risk reinforcing a sense of infallible wholeness. To consider implied authoring as an incoherent project might begin to lead us out of the tautology by which authors and texts are mutually confirming, liberating the (Foucauldian) "author-function" to readerly plurality. And if we consider some texts, some readers, and some settings more likely than others to produce the sense of an author-as-persona and others more likely to produce the sense of an impersonal structure at work, we might be freed to begin asking when and how readers are likely to construct, or to believe in, these different authorships. We might then explore dif ferent genres, different structures of representation, and different stylistic practices for their generation not only of differing profiles of implied author but differing con</page><page sequence="7">(Im)plying the Author 159 cepts of implied authorship itself. Perhaps the Kay Scarpetta novels occupy a pole of extreme personalization, while texts with multiple focalization or ironizing practices occupy a middle ground, and certain other texts?Raymond Queneau's Exercises in Style comes to mind?generate less a sense of personal author than a sense of imper sonal form, or less an ethical divine than an aesthetic wizard. Perhaps the particular investments in authors by literature scholars and novel readers encourages the per sonification of authoring in ways that television shows and advertising do not. If we put aside our binary debates, we might begin with new depth and specificity to (im)ply authors and to learn how authors (im)ply. ENDNOTES 1.
