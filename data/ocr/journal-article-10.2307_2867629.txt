<plain_text><page sequence="1">Shakespeare's Miracle Play HOWARD FELPERIN LTHOUGH the view has been advanced that Shakespeare is responsible, directly or indirectly, for the first two acts of Pericles and that he certainly wrote the last three,' there is still a lingering critical and theatrical tendency to give the play short shrift. E. M. W. Tillyard, for example, speaks for most who have written on the last plays when he dismisses Pericles as a tentative, unrealized, unsuccessful essay in the process of formal experimentation which produced Cymbeline, The Winter's Tale, and The Tempest: Although it is likely that the last three acts are mainly Shakespeare, there is no proof that he handled them seriously enough to justify our basing any elaborate theorising on them.... It is wrong to extract from this novelty of music any more complex fact than that Shakespeare at the time of Pericles was being impelled along some new way of expression. The other features of the play are too hap-hazard and ill-organized to give any sure informa- tion whither that way was tending.... He may have approached it with the vaguest notion of what he might make of it. Nor is there the least rea- son to be sure that an incident occurring in Pericles bears the same signifi- cance as it does when repeated in a later play.... As a seminal play, rich in undeveloped possibilities, we may heed it, but not as something embody- ing any fully formed experience in Shakespeare's mind.2 Tillyard's caveat should be heeded when he suggests that Shakespeare's cul minating vision was dynamic-growing, changing, seeking new forms of ex- pression-but this in no way undermines the dramatic, visionary, and thematic integrity of Pericles itself. That the play is poetically coherent in detail and as serious as anything Shakespeare ever wrote has been eloquently demonstrated by Wilson Knight, and if certain potentialities were later developed at the ex- pense of others (the same could be said in turn of each of the last plays, in fact, of every play in the canon), this is merely what we must expect from a drama- tist who never simply repeated himself. The play's popularity with Shake- speare's audience should itself alert us to the existence of an internal coherence, then immediately intelligible and still accessible through the historical imagina- tion.

Wilson Knight, The Crown of Life (London, 1947), pp. 32-75.

E. K. Chambers hazards this extreme theory: The profound cleavage in Shakespeare's mental history about I6o7- i6o8 must have been due to some spiritual crisis the nature of which it is only possible dimly to conjecture; some such process as that which in the psychology of religion bears the name of conversion; or perhaps some sick- ness of the brain which left him an old man, freed at last from the fever of speculation and well disposed to spend the afternoon of life in unexacting and agreeable dreams. This latter hypothesis would help also to explain the marked change of style which accompanies the change of dramatic pur- pose in the romances.3 It is indeed hard to imagine a virtually lobotomized Shakespeare writing the in- tricately constructed and harshly actualized plays of Cymbeline and The Win- ter's Tale, but the alternative theory of "religious conversion" commands more respect, and is, in fact, the avenue of approach taken by the most sympathetic modern interpreters. T. S. Eliot owlishly remarks that the characters of the final romances are "the work of a writer who has finally seen through the dramatic action of men into a spiritual action which transcends it."4 Kenneth Muir distinguishes Peri- cles from all previous Elizabethan dramatic romance, including that of Shake- speare, when he asserts that it is not the conventional wheel of Fortune that controls the action, but the "wheel of Providence", while for Wilson Knight, Pericles is Shakespeare's attempt "to create a morality play around his own po- etic symbolism as dogma" (p. 36). The evidence for such pronouncements is pervasive. All the last plays posit a beneficent supernature which regularly in- trudes into, while presiding over, the natural world of action. Its dramatic rep- resentations are the recurrent theophanies, resurrections, oracular predictions, and its representatives, spirits and magicians. Prodigies of one kind or another occur frequently in the Histories and Tragedies, but there their miraculous na- ture is emphasized: they stand out as deviations from a more or less naturalistic norm of action. In the last plays the miraculous comes very close to becoming the norm of action. The hypothesis that Shakespeare experienced some sort of religious conver- sion, intuition, vision, or inspiration about i607-i608, which remained with him until the close of his career, is, of course, merely a critical convenience. It is use- ful only in so far as it illuminates the marked change of style and change of dramatic purpose in the last plays, to which Chambers alludes, and it is valid only in so far as it derives from the plays themselves. The change of style which Pericles announces seems all the more radical if we remember that it almost certainly follows Coriolanus. From the most naturalistically earth-bound of the Tragedies, we move to the stagy fairy-tale of the first of the last plays. A lucid, chaste, Virgilian rhetoric gives place first to a gnomic, archaic, brittle verse and then, by the end of Pericles, to Shakespeare's final, magical speech-music; tight 8 Shakespeare: a Survey (London, 1925), p. 293. 4Quoted by Kenneth Muir, Shakespeare as Collaborator (London, 1960), p. 83.</page><page sequence="3">SHAKESPEARE'S MIRACLE PLAY 365 dramatic structure to slack, episodic, narrative structure; psychologically com- plex personalities to simple character-types; and so on. Rather than be baffled or exasperated we must assume that Shakespeare, at this point in his career, knew what he was doing: that the marked change in style is accounted for by a change in dramatic purpose, and the change in purpose, by a change in his poetic vision of life. When Ancient Gower walked onto the stage as Chorus, a Jacobean audi- ence would have been immediately aware of the archaism of the device. The convention of the poet as Chorus had been all but brushed aside by the mo- mentum of increasing naturalism, and plays at this point in the development of the drama often began in mid-dialogue ("Tush, never tell me!", "Nay, but this dotage .. ."). The technique of poet as Chorus originates in the medieval religious drama, specifically in the saint's play, of which lamentably few in Eng- lish have survived. The late-fifteenth-century The Conversion of St. Paul illus- trates the technique; there, the Poeta introduces and recapitulates each scene, apologizes for breaks and leaps in the action, but, most importantly, acts as, moral interpreter to the audience. Even if Shakespeare was unacquainted with this play, similar miracle or saint's plays were performed well into the late six- teenth century on their appropriate festival days. Of course many plays closer to Shakespeare still used the choric device, usually to compress a sprawling ro- mantic action-Barnes's The Divils Charter and Day's The Travailes of the Three English Brothers, both produced shortly before Pericles, used the device -and Shakespeare himself had used a choric narrator in Henry V. But in none of these precedents is the primary function of the Chorus moralistic and didac- tic. In this element of his role Gower is closer to the medieval Poeta, and in his constant moralizing over the action he presents, Shakespeare catches his his- torical identity as a child of the Middle Ages. Obviously Shakespeare would not deliberately cultivate an archaic medieval- ism at this stage in his work without very sophisticated ulterior motives. Gower's first speech is shot through with clues to Shakespeare's intentions: To sing a song that old was sung, From ashes ancient Gower is come Assuming man's infirmities, To glad your ear, and please your eyes. It hath been sung at festivals, On ember-eves and holy ales; And lords and ladies in their lives Have read it for restoratives: The purchase is to make men glorious, Et bonum quo antiquius eo melius. If you born in these latter times When wit's more ripe, accept my rimes.... The imitation of Gower's jingly rhymes, archaic diction, and simpleminded didacticism is itself skilful, and who but Shakespeare could have introduced so, unobtrusively, yet purposefully, the main themes of the play, "man's infirmi- ties", resurrection, and restoration, within the first eight lines? The humorous Latin tag, the contrast between "these latter times" and a "song that old was</page><page sequence="4">366 SHAKESPEARE QUARTERLY sung'-', a contrast embodied in the resurrected Gower himself, serve to surround the tale with an air of vague antiquity. "It hath been sung at festivals,/ On ember-eves and holy ales"-all occasions in the Church calendar. In short, Shakespeare is telling us that the story we are about to witness will be a timeless parable for our spiritual enlightenment-like the miracle play-and that to learn from it we must unlearn our sophisticated notions of dramatic story- telling. Aware of the difficulties that this request involves, he makes Gower humorously self-conscious in his demand. Like the long-suspected chorus of Time in The Winter's Tale, Gower's speeches are not intended as great poetry -why do we insist that Shakespeare always sound like Shakespeare?5-but as dramatically appropriate poetry calculated to persuade us to accept certain im- possibilities, to establish on the spur of the moment a convention crucial for our understanding of what is to follow. In the case of Gower, the convention was partly established in the mind of the audience already, trained as it was on an earlier drama. What follows in the first scene explains Shakespeare's choice to resurrect a dead poet and a dead convention. Pericles, full of hope and bound for adven- tbre, seeks the hand of the daughter of King Antiochus. About to attempt the riddle on which marriage or death depends, he prays to the gods: Per. You gods, that made me man, and sway in love, That have inflamed desire in my breast To taste the fruit of yon celestial tree Or die in the adventure, be my helps, As I am son and servant to your will, To compass such a boundless happiness! Ant. Prince Pericles- Per. That would be son to great Antiochus. Ant. Before thee stands this fair Hesperides, With golden fruit, but dangerous to be touched; For death-like dragons here affright thee hard. Her face, like heaven, enticeth thee to view Her countless glory, which desert must gain. (I. i. 20-32) This passage has no counterpart in any of the play's sources. The Hesperides, the daughters of Night, were in the Renaissance confused with the garden of the gods where Zeus espoused Hera, commonly seen as a classical prototype of Eden. The delicate tissue of allusion-"golden fruit", "celestial tree", etc.-can- not fail to suggest the myth of Eden and the fall into knowledge. The Chris- tian overtones of the dialogue must thunder, if not in ours, certainly in Jaco- bean ears. Antiochus' daughter, whose beauty "enticeth" Pericles to "view", "touch", and "taste", is a symbol of forbidden experience, and the riddle, which he solves easily enough, teaches him his first lesson in distinguishing good from evil, a theme developed in the black-and-white division of characters after the fashion of the morality play. The world of moral symbol is immediately established. Antiochus' incestuous daughter represents essential evil, sin plated with gold. She is more an abstraction than a character, and I suspect that is why she is nameless and silent. Incest had been used to represent essential sin in See Hardin Craig, "Shakespeare's Bad Poetry", in Shakespeare Survey z (I948), pp. 51-56.</page><page sequence="5">SHAKESPEARE'S MIRACLE PLAY 367 at least one medieval interlude, Duk Moraud, and the subject enables Shake- speare to treat simultaneously his two main concerns: the regenerative, redemp- tive love between father and daughter and the perversion of that love into self- consuming, self-destructive evil. Gower will contrast the two pairs of fathers and daughters in his final chorus. The technique is to be allegory. Pericles in his first scene is derived from Everyman through Juventus of the neo-moralities. Unlike his Christian prede- cessors, however, he is not culpable but eminently virtuous; yet we shall see that his play also is to be concerned with redemption. In the next of the hero's episodes (I. iv) the allegory becomes more conven- tionally Christian in theme and less poetically subtle in treatment. Pericles, haunted by Antiochus' murderer Thaliard, forgets his own misfortune long enough to relieve Tharsus, whose former wealth and glory have, in the course of worldly affairs, changed to famine and squalor. Gower tells us (II. Chorus) that a monument is raised to him by the grateful king and queen, Cleon and Dionyza, "to make him glorious"-the "purchase" of the story itself, Gower has already informed us. Leaving behind the scene of his charity, Pericles launches out onto the sea of life once again, endures his first tempest and shipwreck, and is cast up on the coast of Pentapolis. Even in the naturalistic scene with the Fishermen (II. i. I2- i65) the didactic, parabolic strain is kept up: 3. Fish. Master, I marvel how the fishes live in the sea. i. Fish. Why, as men do a-land: the great ones eat up the little ones. I can compare our rich misers to nothing so fitly as to a whale: a' plays and tumbles, driving the poor fry before him, and at last devours them all at a mouthful. Such whales have I heard on a'th'land, who never leave gaping till they swallow'd the whole parish, church, steeple, bells, and all. (II. i. 26 ff.) To which Pericles remarks, "A pretty moral", and continues aside: How from the finny subject of the sea These fishers tell the infirmities of men. (II. i. 48-50) Unafflicted with man's infirmities, the honest fishermen retain a Biblical sim- plicity and wisdom-in contrast to the ruined luxury of Tharsus. Though the seas threaten, they are merciful, and Pericles' fortunes now be- gin to brighten. His father's rusty armor is cast up, and he embarks on a second wooing. Pericles is still a kind of idealized Everyman, now about to experience the secular, but sacramental, event of love and marriage. The scene of the feast is ceremonious and spectacular, quite like a scene in Spenser. The feast is em- blematic, as often before in Shakespeare, of the joy and festivity in life itself- one thinks of Macbeth (III. iv) and Coriolanus (IV. v)-from which Pericles, like Macbeth and Coriolanus, has been exiled. He stands apart in his rusty armor from the procession of glittering knights bearing elegant devices. But his natural grace and virtue outglitter them all, "like diamond to glass" (II. iii. 36), and when he presents a withered branch, green only at the top, with the motto, "In hac spe vivo" (II. ii. 43), Simonides comments to Thaisa:</page><page sequence="6">368 SHAKESPEARE QUARTERLY A pretty moral; From the dejected state wherein he is, He hopes by you his fortunes yet may flourish. (II. ii. 44-45) Meanwhile divine justice is working itself out. We learn from Helicanus, the just and loyal counsellor sprung from the stock of Escalus and Kent, that Antiochus and his daughter have been struck in all their pomp by a thunder- bolt and left shrivelled and stinking (II. iv. io). "So bad a death argues a mon- strous life", says Warwick of the corrupt Cardinal Beaufort in 2 Henry VI, and the principle holds more or less rigorously in Shakespeare all the way to the bloody suicide of Goneril. Evil characters until now have directly or indirectly destroyed themselves by their wild, hybristic identification with chaos. But never before has the retributive efficiency of heaven borne such an emphasis: Sim. And yet but justice; for though This king were great, his greatness was no guard To bar heaven's shaft, but sin had his reward. (II. iv. i3 a.) A pretty moral indeed. If we hear the machinery clanking, it is because Shake- speare intends us to, and before the end of the play we will not only hear it but see it in the form of the goddess Diana. Pericles wins Thaisa and marries her, but not before Simonides has "tested" his love by impugning it as witchcraft, a sequence (II. v) which may be seen as the germ of Cymbeline, and which threatens to turn the scene into one more painful adventure. Shakespeare seems to be reminding us that Joy's hand is ever at his lips bidding adieu. With the third act the allegorical method undergoes a sea-change; instead of presenting a string of archetypal moral episodes in the life of Everyman, Shakespeare refers the increasingly personal experience of the hero to the gen- eral experience of men by means of oblique suggestion within the language it- self. Embarked for Tyre, Thaisa now with child, Pericles encounters another tempest. When Lychorida, the nurse, hands him a daughter, "this piece/ Of your dead queen" (III. i. i7-i8), he cries out: 0 you gods! Why do you make us love your goodly gifts, And snatch them straight away? (III. i. 22-24) "To make my gift,/ The more delay'd, delighted", Jupiter will reply at the end of Cymbeline, and the same answer will be implicit in the ending of Peri- cles. With his "fresh-new seafarer" (III. i. 4), Marina, he makes for Tharsus. Wilson Knight hits the mark when he says, "the storm is generalized; the child's birth shown as an entry into the turmoils of nature, widely understood, an entry into storm-tossed mortality recalling the crying child of old Lear's luna- tic sermon (King Lear IV. vi. i87); and when the child is called 'this fresh new seafarer' (III. i.41) only a response most insensitive to Shakespeare's storm- poetry, in general, and his use of it in Pericles in particular, will limit the mean- ing to the immediate occasion" (p. 42). Thaisa's coffin is washed up at Ephesus, where we meet Cerimon, a white magician who looks backward to Friar Lawrence and forward to Prospero:</page><page sequence="7">SHAKESPEARE'S MIRACLE PLAY 369 Cer. I hold it ever, Virtue and cunning were endowments greater Than nobleness and riches; careless heirs May the two latter darken and expend, But immortality attends the former, Making a man a god. 'Tis known I ever Have studied physic, through which secret art, By turning o'er authorities, I have, Together with my practice, made familiar To me and to my aid the blest infusions That dwells in vegetives, in metals, stones; And can speak of the disturbances that Nature works, and of her cures; which doth give me A more content in course of true delight Than to be thirsty after tottering honour, Or tie my treasure up in silken bags, To please the fool and death. (III. ii. 27 if.) Unlike Faustus, who also believed a sound magician is a demi-god, he employs the god-like offices of life and death to purely Christian uses. His rejection of riches and worldly power recalls the brittle glory of Cleon and Dionyza as well as the essential virtue of the fishermen. His last lines must have called up in the mind of a Renaissance audience the numerous woodcuts, paintings, and windows representing the Danse Macabre, in which the Fool and Death were regular companions. Several moralities and early interludes contain one or the other of the figures, and others, now lost, undoubtedly contained both. F. D. Hoeniger, the editor of the New Arden Pericles, cites the wagon-load of stage players in Don Quixote which includes the Devil, Death, and a Fool.6 In a scene strikingly reminiscent of the raising of Lazarus in the Digby Mary Magdalene, Cerimon raises Thaisa, who vows herself to Diana's temple, supposing her husband dead. The entire scene, with its magic and music, is otherworldly, and Cerimon is clearly a descendent of the miracle-play Christ. Pericles, supposing his wife dead, vows himself to a state of penitential with- drawal. He delivers Marina to the "charity" of Cleon and Dionyza, to whom he moralizes: We cannot but obey The powers above us. Could I rage and roar As doth the sea she lies in, yet the end Must be as 'tis. (III. iii. 9-i2) Till she [Marina] be married, madam, By bright Diana, whom we honour, all Unscissor'd shall this hair of mine remain Though I show ill in't. So I take my leave. (III. iii. 27-30) Cataracts of ink have been spilled in the effort to find in Pericles' experience up to this point at least one specific sin which will explain his self-imposed penance. Needless to say, there is none, and that is the very point. Thaisa's death is not simply the death of a wife but the final overpowering evidence of worldly 6London, i963, pp. 87-88n.</page><page sequence="8">370 SHAKESPEARE QUARTERLY mutability and loss. Like Mankind in The Castle of Perseverance, Pericles and Thaisa withdraw from the pain and flux of the Earthly City into a decidedly medieval asceticism. The theme will be climactically realized-and modified- in the terrible penitential figure of Pericles in the last act. Act IV belongs to Marina, the first of Shakespeare's idealized portraits of young womanhood in the last plays. Dionyza's love for her own daughter, Philoten, has festered into a murderous jealousy against Marina, who obscures Philoten in the arts of music and weaving. Marina's grace and innocence are revealed as she recounts what she knows of her life: Ay me! poor maid, Born in a tempest, when my mother died, This world to me is as a lasting storm, Whirring me from my friends. (IV. i. 17-20) The kind murderer Leonine, a preliminary tracing of Antigonus, is about to carry out his command when Marina is snatched away by the men of "the great pirate Valdes" (IV. i. 96). Undoubtedly the name alludes to Pedro de Valdes, an admiral in the Armada, and, as Malone commented, would have been rel- ished by a contemporary audience.7 But Valdes is also Dis, who seized Proser- pine gathering flowers and carried her off to the underworld (cf. W.T. IV. iv. ii6-ii8). The underlying myth employed by Shakespeare is that of a figure of innocence transported to a realm of darkness, where she eventually becomes its ruler. The moral allegory is mythologically sustained. In the underworld of Mytilene the flawless virtue of "absolute Marina" is threatened and tested by the surrounding sordor; by contrast she emerges still more resolutely chaste. "Did you ever hear the like?" one patron of the brothel asks his companion, "But to have divinity preached there!" (IV. v. I-5). Even Boult, diligent bawd that he is, is impotent to ravish her and winds up consenting to secure her a place in "an honest house" (V. i. Chorus). The governor of Mytilene, Lysima- chus, is also converted by this "piece of virtue" (IV. vi. iii). E. M. W. Tillyard comments: The brothel scenes . . . are not ultimately effective. The brothel is superbly described, but, seeing it primarily through Shakespeare's own sympathetic eyes, we can find little use for Marina in that setting. When Marina preaches at Boult . . . , it is Boult rather than Marina who catches our sympathy. We cannot indeed be at ease simultaneously with Marina and the other inmates of the brothel; and end by thinking her a prude, however strongly our reason insists that she would in point of fact and in all decency have been horrified at her plight and have behaved precisely as she is made to behave. (P. 23) Even after allowing Tillyard the benefit of the doubt-that that he means Shakespeare's esthetically "sympathetic" eyes-we must conclude that he is quite literally speaking for an age, his own, and not for all time. Exemplary virtue, though it may strike us as prudish, could not have struck Shakespeare's audience that way. Marina culminates a long tradition of incorruptibly virtuous heroines from the saint's legend of St. Agnes through Chaucer's Virginia, "Constance, and Griselda to Marston's Sophonisba (i6o6). The immediately 7 Hoeniger, p.

Act IV of Pericles is a miniature miracle play portraying the triumph of Chastity over Lust. The Renaissance, which still delighted in didacticism, had often "heard the like" and enjoyed hearing it again. In the final act, which many will agree is one of the finest things in Shake- speare, the religious vision implicit throughout is focused and articulated. "God Neptune's annual feast" (V. Chorus) is the occasion. Pericles is revealed on board his ship, clad in sackcloth, fourteen years unshaven, fasting, and vir- tually insensible. He has been brought to this living purgatory by the false news of Marina's death, and though he has committed no specific sin, still Everyman, he is guilty of mortality, cause enough for penance and self- mortification in this play. Marina is brought on board to try to arouse this ruined piece of nature with "her sweet harmony/ And other chosen attractions" (V. i. 44-45). "Behold him", says Helicanus, "This was a goodly person,/ Till the disaster that, one mortal night,/Drove him to this" (V. i. 34-36). Gradually, as she plays and speaks, he revives: Tell thy story; If thine consider'd prove the thousandth part Of my endurance, thou art a man, and I Have suffer'd like a girl; yet thou dost look Like patience gazing on kings' graves, and smiling Extremity out of act. (V. i. I34) A monument had been raised to Pericles for his charity at Tharsus, "the belching whale/ And humming water" (III. i. 62-63) had been Thaisa's "monument", and now Marina becomes a monumental carving, a symbol of endurance beyond the tragedy represented by "kings' graves", beyond the misfor- tune, misery, and loss inherent in all mortal experience. Endurance and sub- mission to the will of the gods had been stressed throughout, out of all propor- tion to the play's sources, and Pericles, like Oedipus, achieves blessedness through the terrifying ordeal of suffering he has undergone. Antiochus' incest, Dionyza's treachery, even the death of Thaisa are, in the words of Eliot's poem "Marina", "by this grace dissolved in place": O Helicanus, strike me, honour'd sir! Give me a gash, put me to present pain, Lest this great sea of joys rushing upon me O'erbear the shores of my mortality, And drown me with their sweetness. 0, come hither, Thou that beget'st him that did thee beget; Thou that wast born at sea, buried at Tharsus, And found at sea again. 0 Helicanus, Down on thy knees! thank the holy gods as loud As thunder threatens us: this is Marina. (V. i. i90-i99) She is "another life" (V. i. 207) to him, and, in an extended sequence (V. i. 220- 233), he hears the music of the spheres. If this is not Shakespeare's attempt to present a secular version of the salvation occurring at the end of countless mira- cle plays, in which the saint or the enlightened is translated to heaven to the</page><page sequence="10">372 SHAKESPEARE QUARTERLY accompaniment of songs of angels, it is at least one of the most spiritualized representations of earthly bliss in literature. Reunion of father and daughter after long separation and suffering becomes Shakespeare's poetic analogue for the post-mortal reunion which is the afterlife. The scene began with a purga- torial vision and ends with a heavenly one. Neptune and Diana preside over the action; they are Shakespeare's meta- phors for the controlling powers of human life, for Hamlet's mysterious di- vinity that shapes our ends. In Cymbeline they will be replaced by Jupiter, and in The Winter's Tale, by Apollo. Diana appears to Pericles in a dream and has him repeat his story at her temple in Ephesus. There follows a second reunion, necessarily diminished in effect, but nevertheless moving. "Did you not name a tempest,/ A birth, and a death?" (V. iii. 33-34) asks Thaisa, now a nun at the shrine, and Pericles exclaims, "Immortal Dianl "-now Diana of the Ephesians, significantly, a fertility goddess of numerous breasts. His words to the Christ- like Cerimon are appropriately hyperbolic: Reverend sir, The gods can have no mortal officer More like a god than you. (V. iii. 6i-63) "Why this is hell, nor am I out of it", says Mephistophilis in Faustus, and Giovanni in 'Tis Pity, "A life of pleasure is Elysium." A straight line connecting these ontological propositions runs through the Tragedies and last plays of Shakespeare. Faustus tries to create a heaven on earth, to translate the Christian notion of heaven into secular terms, but at the end of his play we see him damned for his endeavor. Hell may be a state of mind for the spirit Mephis- tophilis, but it is a physical place for the man Faustus. Giovanni repeats Faustus' moral experiment; he dies, like his prototype, persistent and unrepent- ant in his course. But we never find out the results of that experiment in terms of an afterlife. The Christian absolutes have faded into the background. There are no good and bad angels to remind us of a transcendent metaphysical reality beyond the ephemeron of life. They have been banished from the stage forever, and, for all we know, at the end of Ford's play heaven and hell are merely states of mind. Shakespeare stands mid-way in this process of gradual secular- ization of Christian eschatology. The tempest weathered and dying in the background, reunited with Desdemona in Cyprus, Othello's soul "hath her content so absolute/ That not another confort like to this/ Succeeds in unknown fate" (II. i. i85-i87). "Whip me ye devils. . . . Blow me about in winds! roast me in sulphur!" (V.ii.279ff.), he cries in the terrible counter-moment. In their scene of reunion (IV.vii.45ff.), Cordelia is "a soul in bliss", while Lear is "bound upon a wheel of fire." Cleopatra has "immortal longings" (V. ii. 283) in her moment of death. In the Tragedies, even the pre-Christian tragedies, the Christian cosmology of heaven, purgatory, and hell and the Christian dogma of salvation and damnation are invoked as metaphors for earthly states of feeling and being, often with the suggestion of meeting after death. Love is heavenly, and abuse of love is infernal. The Tragedies move toward a final reconcilia- tion and reunion of lovers beyond this world where content so absolute meets only persecution and frustration. In Pericles the eschatological metaphors become reality. The world becomes,</page><page sequence="11">SHAKESPEARE'S MIRACLE PLAY 373 ultimately, the place of love's fulfillment rather than defeat, and with an in- tensity so perfect it becomes salvation, the state which is the goal and justifica- tion for all previous states. Cordelia is a figure of grace who redeems the cursed and brutal Nature of the play, but the redemption she offers the ruined Lear is fugitive, lifting him out of purgatory but into no abiding heaven within the play. The salvation that Marina and Thaisa bring to Pericles is absolute and enduring, a beatific love-vision realized on earth, while the gods, previously in- different, hostile, or non-existent in Shakespeare, become benevolent, working inevitably to bring that final fulfillment about. And as we should expect, allu- sion to an afterlife disappears. There is no suggestion of Christian eschatology in the last plays-how could there be when salvation becomes an earthly des- tiny?-while the Christian values of faith, patience, charity, chastity, take on a new teleological significance in Shakespeare's mind. The religious drama of the Middle Ages and early Renaissance was pred- icated on the belief in a single transcendent reality behind the world of appear- ances in which we live. It knew not seems. The characters of Shakespeare's earlier plays, notably Hamlet, live and die knowing only seems. Kent says, "it is the stars that govern our conditions", while Cassius insists that "the fault . . . is not in our stars but in ourselves". Macbeth comes to believe that life is "a tale told by an idiot", and Edgar that "ripeness is all", though Malvolio would have it that "all is fortune". Gloucester thinks at one point that the gods "kill us for their sport", while Hamlet, approaching the mood of the last plays in his final scenes, says, "there is special providence in the fall of a sparrow." The very absence of a single theory of reality in these plays is the precondition for their naturalistic technique, which, paradoxically, presents things only as they seem. When an artist believes he has apprehended the unalterable laws that govern the moral and mortal world, he must resort to the dark conceit of allegory, which is alone capable of presenting things as they are, given the belief that things are a certain way. Wilson Knight summarizes the esthetic problem fac- ing Shakespeare in the last plays in a passage which deserves to be quoted at length: The artist expresses a direct vision of the significance of life, and for his materials he uses, for purposes of imitation, the shapes, the colours, the people and events of the world in which he finds himself. But in the course of the spiritual progress to which he is dedicated, it may happen that the implements of outward manifestation in the physical universe become inadequate to the intuition which he is to express. Art is an extroverted expression of the creative imagination which, when introverted becomes re- ligion. But the mind of man cannot altogether dispense with the ma- chinery of objectivity, and the inwardness of religion must create, or discern, its own objective reality and name it God. Conversely, the artist, in process of growth, may be forced beyond the phenomena of actuality into a world of the spirit which scarcely lends itself to a purely artistic, and therefore objective, imitation. In Cymbeline Shakespeare is forced by the increasing inwardness of his intuition to a somewhat crude anthropomorphism in the Vision of Jupiter; and this anthropomorphic theology is inimical to artistic expression. Cymbeline contains a personal god called in to right the balance of a drama whose plot, like that of Pericles and The Winter's Tale, is in- compatible with the ordinary forms of life; but this god, true enough to the</page><page sequence="12">374 SHAKESPEARE QUARTERLY religious intuition of the author, yet comes near to exploding the work of art in which he occurs.... In [The Tempest] Shakespeare looks inward and, projecting perfectly his own spiritual experience into symbols of objectivity, traces in a compact play the past progress of his own soul. (Pp. 22-23) The medieval Christian drama had two assets in presenting its religious vision which Shakespeare lacked when faced with presenting his own: an aud- ience which already accepted its Christian vision and a readily available set of "symbols of objectivity", also shared with the audience, with which to project it -an anthropomorphic Christ, a whole bevy of saints, angels, devils, personified virtues, and so forth. If Shakespeare lacked an audience already schooled in his own epi-Christian intuition, however, he had the advantage of an audience trained on a Christian allegorical drama and, hence, potentially responsive to his own allegorical technique. The co-existence of allegorical-religious and naturalistic-secular drama in Shakespeare's age corresponds to the co-existence of two potential responses in Shakespeare's audience. The author who, earlier in his career, could jibe satirically at a moribund dramatic tradition-it out- herods Herod-was to depend on that tradition to express his final vision of life. The gnomic, end-stopped, frequently rhymed verse of the opening scenes of Pericles, it has been remarked, seems earlier than the earliest Shakespeare we have. We know from the play-within-a-play in Hamlet that he was perfectly capable of resurrecting a more primitive verse style for his own specific pur- poses. There, the archaic style serves to differentiate "The Mousetrap" from his own play, in fact, to make it seem like a play and the remarks of Hamlet, Ger- trude, and Ophelia, which frame and interrupt it, seem like life. In Pericles the deliberate archaism of the first acts serves to tell his audience, already put on guard by the figure and speech of Gower, not to respond as they would to a typical naturalistic play, but to call up that other response still potential in their minds, the response inculcated by religious drama, which accepts and inter- prets the allegorical technique, and through which the resurrections, theoph- anies, exemplary figures, sea, storm, and music symbolism of Pericles-of each of the last plays-become intelligible. Despite the considerable theatrical success of Pericles in its first days, Shakespeare deviated from the allegorical method in his subsequent efforts and reverted at least part-way back to naturalism. The process of selective simplifica- tion which represented life as a tempest, a birth, and a death and human be- ings as passive emblems in an eternal metaphysical drama may have struck him as inadequate to the increasing complexity of his vision. We value the later plays more highly, I suspect, partly because of their reversion to a causal, consequential, and recognizable world, to a more naturalistic mode-the dra- matic style and substance in which we have been schooled-and also, perhaps, because they are simply better plays. Yet Shakespeare's audience did not, alive as it still was to the proposition that the phenomenal world is but the shadow of a magnitude and to the dramatic technique which that proposition implies.
