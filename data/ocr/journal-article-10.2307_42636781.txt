K. Mendenhau,, Law and Covenant in Israel. are few scholars who at this date are unfamiliar with Prof. Mendenhall's ideas on law and covenant. Their summary here therefore would be pointless. His areas of disagreement, at least on major issues, the review- er also finds are few, and in the rare cases where they do exist they are such that their treatment would exceed the limits of a review. However, though neither herald nor critic, he hopes that two considerations will render this review not entirely otiose. The first is that some very impor- tant aspects of Mendenhall's work have been either misunderstood or rejected on insufficient grounds. The second is that in the last six years our sources for the study of covenants in both the first and second millen- nium have increased considerably, and we are in a position to test the results of Mendenhall's study in the light of further evidence. One misunderstanding is evidenced in A. Jepsen's review (OLZ 1959, 37) when he asks if the Gcttesberith in Israel was not something essentially different from a Hittite treaty. Of course it was, but it is difficult to see how Mendenhall can be accused of saying, even by implication, that it was not. In fact, he is explicit on the matter, expressly stating that to say religion is based on covenant is an anthropomorphism (p. 24, n. 3). This, however, is of the very nature of religious and theological expression (cf. his citation of Luther). One might cavil over the term anthropomor- phism, and prefer instead analogy, but surely the only real problem is to discover what anthropomorphism (or analogy) the Israelites employed to describe their relationship to God. The principal contribution of Menden- hall has been to show that the Mosaic covenant, formally and juridically, was modelled on the suzerainty treaties found in Hittite sources of the second millennium. This is no way means that a Hittite treaty and the Mosaic covenant are univocal terms, but it does mean that the model can throw a great deal of light on the nature and the subsequent history of Moses' work. Not less serious is D. J. Wiseman's objection that, contrary to what Mendenhall maintains, from the second millennium on the covenant form " remained basically unchanged through Neo- Assyrian times " (Iraq 20 [1958] 28). This, if true, would nullify one of Mendenhall's most impor- tant conclusions, namely, that the Mosaic covenant finds its only true parallels in the covenants of the second, not of the first, millennium. But Wiseman is simply wrong, for no covenant of the first millennium contains an historical prologue. This, it must be insisted, is not merely a question of form; it concerns the basic conception of the covenant. As Korošec has shown, the historical prologue constitutes das rechtliche Rückgrat of the Hittite suzerainty treaties. It is on the basis of his and his predecessors' unmerited favors towards the vassal king and his subjects that the Hittite king grounds his claim to acceptance of the co- venant and the vassal's loyal service. To establish this right to service on the basis of Yahweh's saving acts is also the function of the introduc- tion to the Decalogue and of Jos 24,2-13, and hence the relevance of the Hittite treaties in a discussion of the Mosaic covenant. Since, however, such an historical prologue is absent from the covenants of the first mil- lennium, we must see in this difference evidence of an essentially diverse</page><page sequence="3">O. Kaiser, Die Mythische Bedeutung des Meeres in Ägypten 299 conception of the nature of a suzerainty treaty, and hence the irrelevance of the later covenants for the problem Mendenhall confronted in his inve- stigation of the origin and history of the Mosaic covenant. This is why, this essential difference established, Mendenhall pays so little attention to the later material, even though it is of unquestionable importance for the study of covenant vocabulary, rites, etc. On this crucial point our most recently published material confirms Mendenhall completely. Aside from a few fragments in Hittite, for the second millennium we now have the texts published by J. Nougayroi,, Le palais royal d'Ugarit IV, Paris, 1956; by D. J. Wiseman, The Alalakh Tablets, London, 1953 (texts 2-4), and cf. also JCS 12 (1958) 124-129. For the first we have, in Aramaic, the new Sefire stela published by A. Du- PONT-SOMMER, Bulletin du Musée de Beyrouth 13 (1956) 23-41 (id., Les inscriptions araméennes de Sfiré , Paris, 1956; cf. also J. A. FiTzmyer, CBQ 20 (1958) 444-476); in Assyrian, D. J. Wiseman, The Vassal Trea- ties of Esarhaddon , Iraq 20 (1958) 1-99. In the later suzerainty treaties (Esarhaddon - the beginning of the Sefire stela is missing) there is no historical prologue; in the earlier ones (Nougayrol) there is an historical prologue. If we stress this point it is because in our opinion it is essential to our understanding both the nature of the Mosaic covenant and the evi- dence for the date of its introduction into Israelite religion. As Wiseman's opposition makes clear, it may be obscured by the many and at times striking similarities which the later covenants bear to the earlier ones. W. Iy. M.</page></plain_text>
