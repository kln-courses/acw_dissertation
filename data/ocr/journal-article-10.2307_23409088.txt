<plain_text><page sequence="1">Report on the Marquesas Islands Rock Art Projectz THE MARQUESAS ISLANDS Rock Art Project was started in 1985 by Maeva Navarro, director of the Department of Archaeology, Tahiti. Our team con sists of Edmundo Edwards, chief archaeologist of r . i r\ rii • . . i 3U1 Vt^ lui LUC IV &lt;11 LI 11 CI 11, &lt;t 11C1U diMildlll, VUiUll teers, local workers, guides, and myself. To date, five field trips have been conducted to the six presently inhabited islands. We have documented over 6000 individual petroglyph motifs, and 77 tiki, (sculp tured images) from 38 valleys. In addition, six rock shelters containing some 99 painted figures in red pigment were documented by our team in 1985. These are the onlv Dictoeraohs known in French Polynesia so far. Further, many of the associated architectural stone structures (paepae) have been mapped. Most have been discovered as a result of our work. The vast majority of rock art was previ ously unrecorded. An island-wide typology has been constructed based on similarities of motifs, and the rock art from Hatiheu Valley, on the north coast of Nuku Hiva, has been analyzed. The goals of the projects are to: • Scientifically document all existing rock art and associated archaeological structures, • Interpret the data, • Preserve and restore rock art sites whenever possible, • Inform the local community of methods to pre serve their cultural heritage, • Share the resul t of the research with local inhabitants. This paper is a condensed report of our work in the Marquesas Islands. Stylistic similarities of the mata komoe (human-like faces) with that of similar types elsewhere in the Pacific will be discussed briefly. Because we now have accumulated a sizable rock art inventory, we are in a position to assess the condition of the ancient stone work. Thus rock art will be addressed within the context of conservation.

Few petroglyphs were found in and parts of the valley. 1 he overwhelming number or carved rock art pan els in Hatiheu Valley face north. The reason for this is uncertain. As the petroglyph material from other valleys are entered into the data base, we will be able to tell if they follow the same patterns as for Hatiheu Valley. Contrary to early accounts, the islands are rich in petroglyphs. It is thought that anthropomorphic fig ures are tne most prevalent island petroglypn motir. However, curvilinear geometric designs rather than linear ones are by far the most common design ele to have developed into intricate curvilinear asym metrical forms. We can see the same pattern in tat tooing designs from the early period of Western con tact.4 Spirals, a tattoo motif, are practically absent in the petroglyph inventory. Other rock art motifs include different variations of human forms, marine animals, terrestrial animals, and birds.

The word mata komoe refers to tattooing, accord ing to Dordillion (1931). Karl von den Steinen (1925, vol.i:i72) called the face motifs in tattooing and wood carving mata komoe. Suggs (1959) uses the term to describe anthropomorphic petroglyph faces. Mata can mean eye, face, genealogy, and the stitch or link in a net (Ivory 1990). The developed mata komoe petroglyph motif in the islands has been rouna in two aisuncc types ^ng.z;. wnne styie a is rare, style b is very common and can be found from the most simplistic carved petroglyph to the more complex motif in bas-relief. The seemingly omnipresent mata komoe motifs are interesting as they are strikingly similar to an incised face on shell from Collinewood Bay, eastern New Guinea (Fig. 3, see Bellwood 1979:267), Lapita pottery sherds from Santa Cruz Reef Islands, and the make-make race so common in taster Island (rig. 4)&gt;5 In Easter Island some of the faces are carved on cor ners of rocks as well. So far only one face and a pair of eves have been documented bv Lee (iqqo-iqqi) at 'Anaeho omalu, Hawai'i. Based on stylistic similar ities alone, if annears as if the mata, hnmne ran he traced from Melanesia across the Pacific to different parts of eastern Polynesia. As yet there are no dates that can be assigned to different types of petroglyph motifs. But rock art may eventually supply archae olopy with additional information about migration routes.

VANDALISM: Some of the pictographs have been outlined by sharp rocks and a few petroglyph pan els have chalk marks. Recent nicks and cuts from machete can be seen in several red volcanic statues after a much visited site was cleared of overgrowth. An attempt to remove rock art with a chain saw resulted in the loss of bas-relief figures at me'ae Menaha, Hakamoui, Ua Pou. ENVIRONMENTAL: Pictographs have been rlamacxed hv wafer seen acre, wasn nesrs. and hv onats rubbing their flanks over the paintings. One large petroglyph boulder—about 8 feet long—lying in a seasonal river bed in Teieto Vallev turned over dur ing a cyclone in 1983. Most of the figures are now buried underneath the boulder. Many of the statues located in the humid forest are covered with lichen. Plants with extensive root systems are growing in cracks of some of the statues of porous volcanic tuff breaking off small pieces of the statues.6 Atmospheric deterioration is more difficult to assess. However, some fragmentation and disinte gration can be detected. A small statue located on top of a raised platform at Paeke, Taipivai Valley, was fragmented in 1986. It is now a heap of rubble.

Work in Australia demonstrates that the most successful pro grams preventing vandalism involve the communi ty. If the local people have a sense of ownership they feel responsible for protecting the sites and become the caretakers.10 I propose that the motifs at the most spectacular ana most visicea petrogiypn sues De paintea wxtn a colored oil base paint. Petroglyphs are notoriously difficult to see by an untrained eye. By clearly mark ing the design it should be unnecessary for others to chalk or scratch up the carved figures in order to highlight them. The paint must be applied by trained neonie under the sunervision of an acrenrv whose job it is to protect the islands cultural her itage. This can only be done after the site has been carefully mapped and recorded. Many view this practice as a form of authorized vandalism. However, in Scandinavia petroglyph sites are rou tinely painted by specialists. This does nothing to protect the carving from erosion but makes them very visible for photographers.

This paper was presented in session i, "Ancient Traditions in a Modern "World", of The Museum and Cultural Center as a Focus for Pacific Arts, the Pacific Arts Association's sessions of Cultural Issues in a Changing Pacific, a section of the XVII Pacific Science Congress in Honolulu on 31 May 1991. [See Pacific Arts 5:6]. 2. F. Oilier, Department of Archaeology, Tahiti, is the only person to have recorded rock art in Fatu Hiva. An unusual 12-meter long, red tuff panel with pecked anthropomorphs and birds was doc umented in the early 1980s in the interior of Hanativa Valley. 3. A notable exception is A'akapa Valley, Nuku Hiva, where our local guide showed us the majority of the sites that we subsequently recorded. 4. The tradition of tattooing in the Marquesas Islands is a complex issue that will not be dis cussed in this paper. 5. Makemake represents the principal god of the Miru tribe in Easter Island, according to K. Routledge, 1919. 6. Atmospheric deterioration of the statues is of great concern to the Department of Archaeology and should be addressed, but this is outside the scope of this paper. 7. Chalk is not readily available on the islands and it is not for sale in the stores. Only the schools appear to be supplied with it. 8. When it was pointed out to the persons involved that this was an unacceptable practice it was dis continued. 9. When working on Dr. Lees Easter Island Rock Art Project in 1982, the petroglyphs appeared for 'A July 1992</page><page sequence="7">the most part in pristine condition. Since anthro pologists have focused on Easter Island research in the last decade, tourist visitation of rock art sites has dramatically increased. As a conse quence, to accommodate the demand local guides have re-carved many of the figures for bet ter viewing. Unfortunately, since most of the original carvings are difficult to see, some of the figures have been misinterpreted and new lines have been carved that have little to do with the original figure. 10. A biennial festival organized by members of Moto Haka, a local cultural group, has done much to educate people and make them proud of their enormous patrimonial wealth.
