<plain_text><page sequence="1">MUSIC AND LETTERS Pencil Portraits of Concert Celebrities. By Hilda Wiener. pp. I99. (Pitman, London, 1937) 25s. It is not, perhaps, by chance that the artist among Madame Wiener's subjects who has been singled out, we are told, as " the new Paganini " should be of such cosy and well-nourished aspect. The type has changed. That virtuosos continue to derive inspiration direct from Hell is most probable, but their diabolism is expressed in terms of music and not, for the most part, in the writhing figure, the flashing eye, the storm-tossed forelock of an earlier day. Caught though many of them are wearing loose lounge coats and, like Don Juan, "very spacious breeches ", Madame Wiener's fiddlers prudently suppress the slightest inclination to writhe; even the infant prodigies stand four-square, as though anti- cipating the burden which Time, or the artist's pencil, will in due course lay upon them. As with fiddlers, so with conductors, singers and pianists -strangely enough in that ascending order of magnitude. We had hardly realized before by how much almost every master pianist overflows the piano-stool; compared with one or two represented here, the concert grand itself lacks substance. But Madame Wiener's line, though it may sometimes parody a waist- coat, is happy in crystallizing a gesture or in finding truth behind some chance physiognomical trait. The poise of Rachmaninov's fingers on the keyboard; Heifetz's notable left arm; Horowitz's pale profile; the stiff, emphatic set of Furtwangler's shoulders; Ravel's trim balance, one hand thrust into a pocket while the other gently moves the stick-the proper emphasis and no more is laid upon such details as these. Even portraits marred by the grossness to which I have already referred-and they include such eminent figures as Schnabel, Gieseking, Milhaud and Kreisler-usually have some strokes of fine characterization, and in fact among the male subjects only Enesco (carved, apparently, out of teak) and Ansermet (with a false beard usurping the place of the true) can be accounted actual failures. Feminine sitters seem to have caused Madame Wiener much more trouble; and, curiously, the stronger the personality among them, the fainter the record we are given of it. D'Aranyi is too dim, Cohen too precise, Fachiri too sombre, Schumann too common- place; Landowska is amusing, but near to caricature; Miiller is obviously in pain. Only the dignity of Leider shines undiminished. Each of Madame Wiener's drawings has been fitted with a paragraph of text which, short as it is, usually finds room for a good many trivialities. Apart from this, one has nothing but commendation for the large, handsome volume and for the idea which inspired it. D. M. F. D. M. F. Songs of Wild Birds. By E. M. Nicholson and Ludwig Koch. Introduction by Julian Huxley. pp. xxxi., 216. With two gramophone records. (Witherby, London) I5s. Fully to benefit from this book, which is unlike any other, the reader must be both musician and ornithologist. Only then will it be possible to measure the scope of the inquiry and to realize the possibilities latent in this first attempt to free the discussion of bird song from the vaporous approximations that so far have enveloped it. Mr. Nicholson, who is responsible for the major part of the letterpress (Mr. Koch contributing one chapter where he tells all that can be told of the making of the 300</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS OF BOOKS two records) goes an appreciable distance ahead of any other known writer on the subject. It could have been wished that he had gone a step farther and pruned his adjectives a hint more stringently. To one who has never heard a black redstart it is little help to be told it has a " wild, penetrating warble ". Again it is useless to say that the stonechat's song is "a brief, scrappy, warbling affair ", though as soon as one is told that the song is " often uttered on the wing, in a jerky hovering song-flight " one is immediately provided with valuable data. Admittedly the task is difficult, as difficult as the concert reporter's nightly job of describing varieties of the human voice in song. Perhaps it cannot be done in any way. Certainly the use of abstract adjectives (joyous: for the wren, not for the bird but for its performance in song; cheerful: for the dunnock; spirited and not unmusical: the wheatear; dashing: the chaffinch) hinders because no two readers will agree as to the precise meaning of such terms, and precision is indispensable. It is here that Mr. Koch's records come in, for they render unnecessary any attempt to translate bird song into verbal symbols. They give the ear, as nearly as can be demanded, the real right thing. The surface scratch of these records is their only blemish and one wonders why this need be so exceedingly harsh. It is to be hoped that means will be discovered by Mr. Koch and the Parlophone engineers to alter this, for at present one seems to be hearing some of these birds but a foot or so off the main London-Portsmouth road with its continual stream of lorries and traction engines. Nevertheless, that, like the matter of Mr. Nicholson's adjectives, is a small point in comparison with what this book and its accompanying records give one. As regards the book, we welcome a method as free as is Mr. Nicholson's from the anthropomorphic approach. The birds are treated as birds, not as friends, dependants, enemies or other peripheral appendages of the human race. The records mark the beginning of an almost endless activity, since there is no saying where the recording of bird song is to stop. The vista opened before us is fascinating apart from its more obvious scientific value, and one looks to the day when the record library will gradually become enriched with the thousands, the millions, of bird voices from the whole of the earth's surface. With a Nicholson to aid us we shall begin to understand hidden aspects of the matter -why, for instance, some birds sing with a closed bill. Finally, to the notice of bird lovers is commended the delightfully mischievous implica- tion (or does the malice exist only in the mind of one reader ?) that, since " many species are stimulated to song when they are disturbed ", a judicious balance between marauding cats (certainly not their present merciless extinction) may help to increase the bird song in our back gardens. S. G. Origine des instruments de musique: introduction ethnographique da 'histoire de la musique instrumentale. By Andre Schaeffner. pp. 405. (Payot, Paris, I936.) With one of the great ethnographical collections of Europe at his command and a personal acquaintance with primitive peoples both in Africa and America, M. Schaeffner has been able to present to us in this treatise a remarkable survey of man's earliest efforts in music-making; 301</page></plain_text>
