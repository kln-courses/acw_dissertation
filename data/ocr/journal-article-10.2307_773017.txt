Larkin 9 SMITH COLLEGE Rarely does a publisher have the privilege of presenting a book as i broad in its scope, as searching and perceptive in its analyses of artistic theories and developments as ART &amp; LIFE IN AMER- ICA. This is a new kind of history of art . . . a book that goes deep into the mores, philosophies and culture of a growing America. Each Book within the book comprises a period of art and life in America with a movement and character of its own. Each Introduc- tion summarizes important cultural developments; discusses critics and art historians; shows the conflicts among artistic theories and practices and the status of art patronage; and explains the constant interplay between art of the New World and the Old. ART &amp; LIFE IN AMERICA, though scholarly and comprehen- sive in content, is amazingly exciting reading . . its 417 faithful reproductions in themselves represent a graphic outline of American functional and fine art. 547 pages, $6.oo. complimentary examination copy on request IRINEHART &amp; CO. 232 madison ave., n.y. 16</page><page sequence="7">A classic publication in the field of graphic arts has been revived PCQ: THE PRINT COLLECTOR'S QUARTERLY founded by Fitzroy Carrington in 1911 and published succes- sively in New York, Boston, London, and Kansas City; edited by Campbell Dodgson, John H.
