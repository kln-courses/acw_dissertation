<plain_text><page sequence="1">Milton Quarterly, Vol. 41, No. 3, 2007 "Thou Serpent That Name Best": On Adamic Language and Obscurity in Paradise Lost Christopher Eagle Of that vexed history of Milton's reception once named the "Milton Con troversy," a history which originates with figures such as Thomas Newton and Samuel Johnson, develops with Leavis and Eliot, and culminates in Ricks and Fish, we might say that it has run a course as tortuous as Milton's own infamous syntax. While Newton, in his renowned edition of Paradise Lost (1749), once admired Milton's use of "words in their proper and primary signification," Dr. Johnson not too long after (1779) ranked Milton below Shakespeare because Milton's "images and descriptions of the scenes or operations of nature do not seem to be always copied from original form. [. . .] He saw nature, as Dryden expresses it, through the spectacle of books" (178). Over a century and a half later (1936), F. R. Leavis followed suit, faulting Milton for his focus "rather upon words than upon perceptions, sensation or things," noting that in the "Grand Style," "the medium calls pervasively for a kind of attention, compels an attitude toward itself, that is incompatible with sharp, concrete realization" (49, 50). Milton, in sum, "exhibits a feeling for words rather than a capacity for feeling through words" (50). That same year, T. S. Eliot's "A Note on the Verse of John Milton" took sides strangely with Johnson and Leavis, strangely because what is criticized begins to sound like Milton's overly modernist tendencies. Because Miltonic syntax "is dictated by a demand of verbal music, instead of any demand of sense," Eliot informs us that these "mazes of sound" have subjected the English language to "a peculiar kind of deterioration" (14)' The obscurity so often attributed to Milton resounded rather loudly for T. S. Eliot with James Joyce's nonchalance about signification, and Eliot based this connection between Milton and Joyce on what he had read (or must we say heard) thus far of Joyce's final work, Finnegans Wake. Citing their biographical similarities, "musical taste and abilities, followed by musical training, wide and curious knowl edge, gift for acquiring languages, and remarkable powers of memory perhaps fortified by defective vision," Eliot gave Joyce the nod over Milton, because "Joyce always maintains some contact with the conversational tone" (16). In addition to their biographical similarities, Joyce's era shared with Milton's a similarly intense preoccupation with pinpointing the "perfect language," a lan guage in which word corresponds to thing adequately and with clarity, with the specificity of a proper name, or the irrefutability of a logical syllogism. In both, this preoccupation was rooted in the biblical terms of a lost Adamic language and the possibility of its retrieval, and furthermore, this tension between pre- and postlap sarian language plays out, in a manner befitting two blind poets, through the interplay of clear and obscure modes of signification. While these parallels may not require that we locate in Paradise Lost something like "an all-pervasive syntactical 183 © 2007 The Author.

The extent to which we read Milton this way is, of course, the extent to which we read obscurity as an indispensable part of Paradise Lost. To determine the role obscurity plays in Milton, however, we must revisit his model for a specifically poetic prelapsarian language, based upon Adam's naming of the animals in Genesis 2.19. "Naming Rightly" in Genesis 2.19 That moment in the Bible in which God bestows the power of naming upon Adam was well known to Milton and his contemporaries as the scriptural basis for an understanding of language in a prelapsarian state. In Leviathan, Hobbes reminds us that "The first author ot Speech was God himself, that instructed Adam how to name such creatures as he presented to his sight" (100). John Wilkins, in An Essay Towards a Real Character and Philosophical Language (1668), feels "tis evident enough that the first language was con-created with our first Parents, they immediately understanding the voice of God speaking to them in the Garden" (1.1.2). Numer ous others (including Newton, Webster, Bishop Sprat, Jean Le Clerc, even Locke) took up the thought-experiment of Adam's language in Eden not only as a past reality, but as a potentially recuperable future.1 Wilkins, who engaged in the most comprehensive attempt to reconstruct a perfect language, believed "that if men should generally content upon the same way or manner of Expression, as they do agree in the same Notion, we should then be freed from that Curse in the Confusion of Tongues, with all the unhappy consequences of it" (1.5.2). Although he admitted only "slender expectations" for his success, he still toiled ad absurdum to codify the prerequisites for what he understood to be prelapsarian perfection, namely, "a just Enumeration and description of such things [. . .] that they may be full and adequate, without any Redundancy or Deficiency as to the Number of them, and regular as to their Place and Order" (1.5.3). If recovered, many hoped this lost art of naming would unlock the same accuracy and precision of thought, both in philosophy and in science, that were said to follow from Adam's intrinsic knowl edge of the things he named. While disagreement has traditionally reigned over which historical language Adam actually spoke (Hebrew, etc.), its content has generally been conceived as a nomenclature of essences, in which word would have reflected thing with perfect accuracy. It is important to note that some of the very same linguistic vices attributed to Milton by Johnson, Leavis, and Eliot throughout the history of the "Milton Controversy," in particular his visual/semantic obscurity, were considered by many of Milton's contemporaries symptomatic of the postlapsarian or post Babelian status of language. By contrast, a recreated Adamic language, it was thought, would be characterized by the linguistic virtues of accuracy and clarity. In the various theorizations of prelapsarian language, a conviction in the fundamental Tightness of Adam's names, in the Cratylist sense (which would require a Hermogenist consensus to recreate artificially) was therefore "taken to be proof of Adam's superior knowledge, and the names he gives the animals are thought to be © 2007 The Author.

Adam's knowledge is infused into him directly by God, and the names he imposes, like God's, are accurate, intensively and extensively" (Fish 114). While Adam is ordained with the task of naming in Genesis 2.19, evidently, the power of nomination is first and foremost the supreme function of the divine. In Milton's rendering of the moment of creation, God divides primeval chaos into light and dark, night and day, specifically by naming them as such: "And light from darkness by the Hemisphere / Divided: Light the Day, and Darkness Night / He nam'd" (Paradise Lost 7.250-52).2 Like God's names, it was supposed that "Adam's names must be perfectly congruent, the name with the notion with the thing," and therefore, they could never be arbitrary but must truly and accurately announce the essential nature of each thing named (Fish 117). Careful attention to Genesis 2.19, however, as well as to its treatment in Paradise Lost, does not bear out quite the same assumption that the Tightness of Adam's names is primarily a matter of the accuracy of his knowledge. In the King James Bible, the Lord God "formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them, and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof." Robert Alters recent translation is nearly identical: "And the Lord God fashioned from the soil each beast of the field and each fowl of the heavens and brought each to the human to see what he would call it, and whatever the human called a living creature, that was its name" (9; emphasis added). If we go back to the Vulgate (Biblia Sacra), we find in Genesis 2.20 that Adam is said to name the animals in a sense tautologically, that is, to name them according to their names: "Appelavitque Adam nominibus suis." In The Search for the Perfect Language, Umberto Eco explicates the entangled sense of "rightness" that emerges from the biblical sources: The Vulgate has Adam calling the various animals "nominibus suis", which we can only translate, "by their own names." [. . .] But Adam might have called the animals "by their own names" in two senses. [. . .] The names that Adam gave the animals are either the names that each animal intrinsically ought to have been given or simply the names that the nomothete arbitrarily and ad placitum decided to give them. (8) Evidently, the dichotomy described here runs exactly parallel to the Platonic one, where names are either thought to reflect a natural correctness (phusei) or a conventional agreement (nomos). In either case, reading the biblical sources, one cannot help but detect an unusual note of divine curiosity at what Adam, so to speak, will come up with. Coupled with this is the assurance that God will abide by Adam's choice of names, an act of divine lenience God will repeat much later for Peter, in Matthew 16.19, making that which is bound on earth bound in heaven as well. On the question of the knowledge behind Adam's naming, Milton himself asserts in De Doctrina Christiana that Adam "could not have given names to the animals in that extempore way, without very great intelligence" (6: 324).3 He treats the subject at greater length in Tetrachordon, making his most explicit remarks concerning Adam's knowledge: © 2007 The Author. Journal compilation © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.</page><page sequence="4">186 Christopher Eagle Adam who had the wisdom giv'n him to know all creatures, and to name them according to their properties, no doubt but had the gift to discern perfectly, that which concern'd him much more; and to apprehend at first sight the true fitness of that consort which God provided him. And therefore spake in reference to those words which God pronounc't before. (2: 602) Based on this, many critics have logically assumed that the Adam of Paradise Lost must "name the animals in just this way," that is, knowing the essence prior to the instant of naming (Leonard l).4 However, if we resist allowing Milton's remarks in Tetrachordon to close the discussion too quickly, we find that Paradise Lost, much like Genesis 2.19, does not definitively endorse the assertion that the rightness of Adam's names is predicated on his a priori knowledge. Again, as Eco points out, the primary ambiguity of the claim stems from whether Adam (human though as yet unfallen), should be said to have named rightly (de Veritas), or only by right (de ordinatio), or more playfully, as he pleases (ad placitum). In Platonic terms, the question is whether Milton's Adam is a Cratylist knower of essences, imbued with a priori knowledge, or a Hermogenist name-maker, imbued with authority over consensus.5 While Paradise Lost does offer interpretations of Adam's knowledge, during his extended conversation with Raphael, there is a consistent hesitation on Milton's part to assert what the exact nature of that knowledge might be. Take, for instance, Raphael's recounting to Adam of the story of Creation, in which he touches in passing on Adam's giving of names: the rest are numberless, And thou thir Natures know'st, and gav'st them Names, Needless to thee repeated. (7.491-93; emphasis added) Syntactically, it would seem here that Adam "knowst" the natures then "gav'st" the names, though the "and" might be operating either as ton-junction or ^-junction, through an employment of apposition that both joins and separates what Adam can be said to know from what Adam can be said to say. Milton might also be invoking here the Hebraic rhythmic model of parallelism {parallelismus membrorum), in which the rhythm of language is intended to replicate the rhythm of thought, typically through an anaphoric repetition of the copulative conjunction. Adam's knowing naming (or naming-knowing), then, would seem to be a matter of process, of coming-to-know, of knowing by naming, and not a priori at all. In Book 8, Raphael again appears to take the knowledge behind Adam's names for granted, although the a priori status of this knowledge remains ambigu ous by virtue of the freedom with which Adam, as reported by God, is also said to name; Thus far to try thee, Adam, I was pleased, And find thee knowing not of Beasts alone, Which thou hast rightly nam'd, but of thyself, Expressing well the spirit within thee free, (437-40) © 2007 The Author. Journal compilation © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.</page><page sequence="5">Milton Quarterly 187 Though Raphael believes Adam "hast rightly named," he was at the same time clearly free to name "wrongly," just as he is free to fall, for as Raphael will remind him shortly thereafter, "to stand and fall / Free in thine own arbitrement it lies" (8.640-41). In Naming in Paradise, John Leonard connects these two moments through the issue of arbitrariness which underlies both. While the so-called arbitrariness of the sign has always stood as the hallmark of Hermogenism (from Hermogenes to Locke to their twentieth-century descendant, Ferdinand de Saussure), Leonard points out that arbitrariness also implies the "discretion of an arbiter," meaning one who is simultaneously constrained by reason yet free to improvise. This leads in Paradise Lost, according to Leonard, to an Adamic naming that is neither Cratylist nor Hermogenist, but rather located in the Socratic "middle ground of wise arbitrary impositions in which both nature and convention play a part" (6). In the above passage then, the epistemological connotations of rectitude behind the word "rightly" would not delimit Adam's choices to a single "right name" for each thing, but rather, more in keeping with the biblical sources, would allow for a certain degree of linguistic improvisation on Adam's part.6 In Adam's own recounting of the moment of Genesis 2.19, the issue of the order of his naming and knowing remains entangled, due to another temporal disjunction between his naming of the living creatures and his "sudden apprehen sion" of their natures: As thus he spake, each Bird and Beast behold Approaching two and two, These cowering low With blandishment, each Bird stoop'd on his wing. I nam'd them, as they passed, and understood Thir Nature, with such knowledge God endu'd My sudden apprehension (8.349-54; emphasis added) The reference to "apprehension" here recalls, and in a sense reverses, the description of Adam's knowledge in Tetrachordon cited above as an apprehension "at first sight," in which Adam recognizes the fitness of Eve as his consort, immediately after he has named the animals. It also importantly reverses the order suggested in Raphael's earlier recounting (7.491); now Adam seems to "giv'st the names" and then "know'st the natures," or again, to know the natures specifically by naming. The recurrence of the conjunction "and" here, along with the arrangement of the syntax (with "as they passed" further bifurcating the two moments), both separate the naming from the knowing, suggesting that rather than truly possessing an intrinsic knowledge of the things he names, Milton's Adam might instead be guided by an inspiration closer to that of the poetic muse of invention. This would make Adam, then, neither the first philosopher nor our very first zoologist, but a poet. Epistemologically, this would mean that while he names, Adam exists not in a state of a priori knowledge but in state prior to knowledge, a prelapsarian innocence where his Tightness would not be found in the agreement of his names to things, but in his aisthesis, that innocent form of tightness which belongs to sheer sensory perception. But if naming "rightly" is insufficient as a category for under standing the prelapsarian state of language, then the model of clarity that goes with it is also presumably insufficient for understanding poetic naming in Paradise Lost. © 2007 The Author.

It is a metrical truism that Milton generally places content words in strong positions; however, in the case of the primary signals of onomastic invocation, naming and calling, there is an even stronger thematic emphasis on these words by virtue of their metrical weight. Milton further intensifies moments of naming and calling by often placing these words in the strongest position of any pentameter line, that of the fifth (or final) foot.7 Not only does closing the line with a Name or a Call add a certain symbolic integrity to the act of invocation, but it can be said to add a syntactic integrity to the moment as well, since the very position of the word dictates a prolonged attention to it. Of the 59 instances of the word "name" (including "names" and "named") in all of Paradise Lost, there is but one occasion where the word falls into a metrically weak position (its integrity further weakened by the use of enjambment). This might appear accidental, or even frivolous, if not for the decidedly posdapsarian context in which the single exception comes: Out of my sight, thou Serpent, that name best s w w s w s w s w s (10.867) In this remark made by Adam to Eve, there is a progressive weakening of Adam's faculties from the paternally charged imperative ("Out of my sight") to an active (but metaphoric) nomination ("thou Serpent") which also doubles as a use of apostrophe or epic invocation to the absent Satan, down to an altogether passive nomination ("that name best / Befits thee") which does not name Eve so much as conditionally suggest what the best name for her would be. Is there not also a syntactic vagueness to line 867 leading us momentarily to attribute the naming best not to Adam but to serpentine Eve? This vagueness, from Milton's suggestive manipulation of positional syntax, might for a moment trip the reader into parsing the line as a complete phrase. If "that" is read as a subordinating conjunction (i.e., "who" or "which"), we might, in the spirit of Richard Bentley, rewrite the line: "Get out of my sight, you Serpent, who are better at naming than I am." Undoubtedly, the same tension exists here between the improvisational side of naming (Gen. 2.19), where "name" would function as transitive verb, and a priori naming (John 1.1), where "name" would act as the Noun of all nouns. In either case, Adam, having eaten of the tree, is suddenly bereft of the befitting name for things, the Edenic mot juste. This is not to argue that his names were right before the Fall either, but rather, just as "the knowledge of good and evill as two twins cleaving together leapt forth into the World," so too the befitting and un-befitting names, as if derivative of a more primordially true naming, come about simultaneously (Milton, Complete Prose 2: 514). Thus, the Cratylist/Hermogenist debate of naming as done rightly or by right is transposed in the above line into a new (and highly aesthetic) category, that of naming best, which reintroduces the problematic possibility suggested above, of there being different degrees to the Tightness of names. If before the Fall, the possibility existed for more than one name potentially to be right, now the more tragic possibility exists for any name potentially to be wrong. © 2007 The Author. Journal compilation © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.</page><page sequence="7">Milton Quarterly 189 Milton's use of the mvocational "call" is no less privileged in Paradise Lost; hence, in the 76 instances of "call" or "called," only three occupy weak positions in the metrical template.8 The most interesting case of a weak calling comes, not surprisingly, in the context of the angelic fall that precedes the human one: There the companions of his fall, o'erwhelm'd With Floods and Whirlwinds of tempestuous fire, He soon discerns, and welt'ring by his side One next himself in power, and next in crime, Long after known in Palestine, and named Beelzebub. To whom th' Arch-Enemy, And thence in Heav'n call'd Satan, with bold words Breaking the horrid silence thus began. (1.76-83) In what we might call a moment of divine nicknaming, the arch-enemies of Heaven receive their new appellations: Beelzebub and Satan. Then, from line 82, Satan performs the first "bold words" of postlapsarian speech: And thence in Heav'n call'd Satan, with bold words w s w s w s w w s s (1.82) Metrical resolution being typical of Milton, Heaven resolves here into the weightier monosyllable "Heav'n," thus occupying one single strong position. With the scan sion ot this line being noticeably at odds with the regular iambic template, there is an obvious undercutting effect in making the boldness of Satan's "bold words" mimetically bold from within a metrically weak position. Moreover, because this is one of the extremely rare instances where any act of calling is deprivileged, or weakened, at the level of the meter, the fact that this is a divine act of nomination is also significant. Although Beelzebub is strongly named with endline stress two lines above, the mere act of calling Satan "Satan" somehow implicates even the Divine in a process of weakened nomination.9 For readers reluctant to grant such interpretations of Miltonic meter, we should also point out that Adam's rhetoric in the confrontation with Eve bears out the same lapse of accurate signification as well. In the world's first domestic squabble, we find a cuckolded Adam making the metaphoric connection of Eve to Satan: Out of my sight, thou Serpent, that name best Befits thee with him leagu'd, thyself as false, And hateful; nothing wants, but that thy shape, Like his, and color Serpentine may show Thy inward fraud, to warn all Creatures from thee Henceforth; lest that too heav'nly form, pretended To hellish falsehood, snare them. (10.867-73) In what many critics consider to be Adam's weakest moment as a character, we have already noted the progressive weakening of his nomination. In the lines that © 2007 The Author. Journal compilation © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.</page><page sequence="8">190 Christopher Eagle follow, Adam tropes Eve's serpentine deceitfulness as the disparity between her mward and outward shape, evidently contrasted with what he hopes is his ever present wholeness. The glaring irony here, of course, is that Adam's likening of Eve to the Serpent is a figurative act (metaphor), itself an equally "serpentine" use of language. Because the possibility of figurativeness depends upon a disjunction from the literal, a disjunction between the inward reality and the outward shape of things, Adam's words would seem not to be ontologically possible before the Fall, because such a split between being and appearing would not yet have taken place.10 For this reason, it is often said that in Paradise Lost, "with the Fall of man, language falls too" (Ricks 109). Like Eve's outward shape, words now pretend, in the "proper and primary signification" of the word, meaning they stretch in front as a covering. They assume this covering-over of their proper and primary signification (the linguistic fig leaf, so to speak), not only by meaning figuratively, but by meaning obscurely, and in this, we should agree with T. S. Eliot that visual opacity is an inevitable by-product of Miltonic diction through which a dislocation takes place, through the hypertrophy of the auditory imagination at the expense of the visual and tactile, so that the inner meaning is separated from the surface, and tends to become some thing occult, or at least without effect upon the reader until fully understood. To extract everything possible from Paradise Lost, it would seem necessary to read it in two different ways, first solely for the sound, and second for the sense. (16) Eliot is right that a double work is required of the reader of Milton, though for him, this comes only from Milton's failure to fuse image, meaning, and sound. In this light, however, one might justifiably reverse Eliot's terms, treating the separa tion of "inner meaning" from the imagistic surface, and the obscurity of diction that stems from that separation, not as an unforgivable gap in Milton's repertoire, but as part of the very "accuracy" of his depiction of the nature of postlapsarian language. As Leonard has noted, "Milton's withholding is often as significant as his giving of names in Paradise Lost" (21), and in terms of Adamic language, the linguistic "darkness visible" (1.63) that results from this dislocation of sound and sense (and which Eliot associated with the tradition of obscure poetics culminating in Finnegans Wake) results in the same sense in a poetics not of naming but of the obscuring of names. One of the more fascinating instances where Milton can be said to conceal or obscure the name comes in the simile of Satan's spear, considered by Stanley Fish one of Milton's most emblematic moments: His Spear, to equal which the tallest Pine Hewn on Norwegian hills, to be the mast Of some great Ammiral, were but a wand, He walkt with to support uneasy steps (1.292-95) From this, Fish claims we are meant to ask the awkward question "How large is Satan's spear?" and from the unanswerability of such a question, to experience the effect of Miltonic accommodation (27). Milton is said to present us with an image © 2007 The Author. Journal compilation © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.</page><page sequence="9">Milton Quarterly 191 similar or approximate to the thing we can never see, then to disclaim the image's inadequacy. Through this refusal of the temptation to aid us, by way of an anthropomorphic reduction of what we cannot grasp, Milton is said to better instruct us as to our own fallen condition. In the case of the spear simile, clearly, by his mis-naming of it, by his saying what the spear is not, his goal is to obfuscate our sight of it. But what if there is a more deliberate connection between Milton's specific choices of seemingly unrelated comparisons? Following the sequence of the vehicle (Spear —&gt; Tree —&gt; Mast of Ship) with the Satanic context in mind, one finds an intriguing similarity between the tenor of the spear simile and the various definitions for the Latin word Malus: (1) evil, troubles; (2) apple tree; (3) mast of a ship. This lurking allusion to the proper and primary significations of the word Malus, a word that remains nowhere named but everywhere suggested, seems all the more plausible when we consider Milton's source text for his depiction of Satan's spear, that is, Virgil's portrayal of the cycloptic shepherd Polyphemous in the Aeneid: Vix ea fatus erat, summo cum monte videmus ipsum inter pecudes vasta se mole moventem pastorem Polyphemum et litora note petentem, monstrum horrendum, informe, ingens, cui lumen ademptum trunca manu pinus regit et vestigial firmat; lanigerae comitantus oves ea sola voluptas solamenque mali. (3.655-61) [He scarce had said, when moving o'er the crest of a high hill a giant shape we saw: that shepherd Polyphemous, with his flocks down wending to the well-known water side; huge, shapeless, horrible, with blinded eye, bearing a lopped pine for a staff, he made his footing sure, while the white, fleecy sheep, sole pleasure now, and solace of his woes, ran huddling to his side.]11 Here the term Malus appears, in its genitive form ("mali"), to describe Polyphe mous's many woes or maledictions. The alternate definitions—of a tree or a ship's mast—however, were equally immediate throughout Latin literature, and so Virgil as well would seem to be playing on the arboreal resonance between the pine tree in "trunca manu pinus" and the tertiary sense of a tree in "mali" just two lines later. Without explicitly including malus in his own simile, Milton follows much the same course, having the "tallest pine" stand in metonymic relation to Satan's malediction, just as the "trunca pinus" upon which Polyphemous bears his maledictions metonymically relates to the maledictions themselves. This operation—the lurking resonance of an absent word around which other words orbit in a kind of gravitational association—epitomizes Miltonic obscurity. Malus is nowhere visible but everywhere present, once the fallen reader glimpses the connection, at which point it can be said to show itself in its own absence. In this respect, Milton's "malus simile" in a sense performs its own etymology, with the Greek "melas" (meaning "black" or "dark") being the even more "proper and primary signification" of the term.12 © 2007 The Author. Journal compilation © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.</page><page sequence="10">192 Christopher Eagle In his similes, writes Dr. Johnson, Milton "does not confine himself within the limits of rigorous comparison; his great excellence is amplitude, and he expands the adventitious image beyond the dimensions which the occasion required" (179). It is true that Milton habitually takes images beyond their required dimensions but not only by epic catalogue or prolonged conceits. In addition, he does this by orbiting around meanings that should remain unspeakable. This emphasis on unspeakability evidently forms part of a Yahwist poetics, in which the utterance of the divine name would shed too much light for human eyes to bear. It is, at the same time, very much a Satanic poetics (putting Milton even further in the devil's company) because the proper and primary signification of Satan's ignominy literally means that his original name is just as unspeakable as that ofYHWH. There is a wonderful irony in the Malus example because this Latin word already existed as a problem-case for Milton's peers, John Wilkins in particular. In Essay Towards a Real Character, Wilkins uses Malus as a prime example of what is wrong with language, namely, the equivocation of meanings which allows one word to stand for many things or notions simultaneously. What acts as the symptom of language's fall for Wilkins, Milton turns in the spear simile into the perfect means to redeem it poetically, making words resonate with each other by revealing the connections behind what would seem to be otherwise arbitrary equivocation. What seems at hrst to signify the Fall (Adam's resorting to figurativeness) instead pro duces a new model for poetic rightness, and the means to this possibility would seem to include the most obscure forms of figurative language. Through its obscurity, Miltonic diction can be said to draw things out in relief, to brighten them by darkening what surrounds them, or, in the case of Malus, to lighten around what is dark. University of California at Berkeley Notes 1 Although Locke was one of the most adept at describing what an Adamic language would be like, in his chapter On Words, he still eschewed the various attempts of his peers to retrieve the prelapsarian language of Eden. 2 All quotations from Paradise Lost are from Merritt Hughes's edition of Milton's complete poetry. 3 All quotations from Milton's prose are from the 8-volume Yale edition. 4 In the introduction, Leonard argues for the viability of a third or "middle" position for the theory of Adamic names in Milton, a position which he associates with Socrates himself in the Cratylus. 5 It should be asked what a Hermognist consensus would mean in an Edenic context where Adam is yet the only human. It seems therefore significant that upon naming the animals, Adam immediately discovers there is no help meet for him. In the very next verse, Genesis 2.20, Eve is created to share in his newly vocalized language. 6 The OED defines "rightly" as (1) "in accordance with equity or moral rectitude," (2) "properly in the right or proper manner," and (3) "in accordance with truth or fact, correctly, accurately, precisely." © 2007 The Author.

In the case of the word "name," there are 12/34 instances of endline stress; of "named," 7/11; and of "names," 6/14. In the word "call," there are 10/32 final position stresses, but almost half of all usages of "call'd" (21/44) come in the final position. 8 ) The other two examples are 3.603 and 12.584. Depending on one's iambic model, the line 11.411 ("Call El Dorado: but to nobler sights") could be added to this list; however, most would consider this just an example of line-initial trochaic substitution, an exception regularly allowed for in Milton. 9 Not coincidental^, we find a similar syntactical vagueness in this line which might lead us, if only for a moment, to confuse the addressor and addressee and attribute the act of calling to Satan, not God, who would stand as "arch-enemy," with Heaven as dependent clause filling the position of "to whom" in the prior line. 10 See Eco, "Possibility." 11 The translation is Dryden's. 12 In Virgil's Georgics 1.118, while describing a kind of primitive paradise untouched by men, he also associates the darkness of "malus" specifically with serpents: "He to black serpents gave their venon-bane" ("malum virus serpentibus").
