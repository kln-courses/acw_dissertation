<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CULT OF THE COMPLEX IN POETRY EDWIN BERRY BURGUM I trend in recent American criticism has been toward an emphasis on the semantic. In academic circles the Brooks and Warren texts on the interpretation of poetry and fiction appear on the surface to have replaced long dominant traditions. The hostility between traditional scholarship and traditional criti- cism bids fair to end in an indifference to both. The movement that calls itself "the new criticism" has little use either for the scholars buried in the tangential facts of biography or texual accuracy, or for the Arnoldian emphasis on those abstract ideas that make litera- ture a "criticism of Life." Great Books programs which began as the revival of Arnold's concern for ideas are coming more and more to be taught as though literature were no more than a record of the zestful variety of human experience. The new emphasis is on the imme- diate examination of the poem or novel as a verbal construction, through which alone such extensions of his experience can reach the reader. It assigns as the first duty of both reader and critic the discovery of the meaning of particular combinations of words. So far, so good. The need for the new emphasis has been con- vincingly expressed by the man who, more than any other, is re- sponsible for the whole movement. I. A. Richards, in his Practical Criticism, laid bare the surprising fact that only a tiny minority is able to read a poem correctly. We might have assumed his findings true of a popular audience, unprepared by education and corrupted by what our presses encourage the man in the street to take as poetry. 31</page><page sequence="2">32 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY But Richards finds equally illiterate Cambridge University under- graduates who certainly come from homes of wealth and what is ordinarily called culture, and who certainly are receiving the best sort of education our civilization is capable of affording. Richards, as usual, does not go into the social causes for such a phenomenon, even though the state of affairs he exposes cries for explanation. It is highly probable that his Cambridge undergraduates failed so abjectly not because they were incapable of attention and understanding, but because they brought no initial interest in poetry to his project. I doubt very much that a similar inquiry into the meanings of prose fiction would have disclosed a similar incapacity. But, whether this be so or not, Richards took the occasion as an opportunity to stress the need for accurate reading of a work of art as preliminary to any judgment of its value. And this is a necessary emphasis if art has any value, as most of us believe. It is significant, though, that most of Richards' disciples have followed him in applying his method to poetry rather than to prose, and that, in a rebound, perhaps, from the common failure to find any accurate meaning in a poem, they find poetry packed with the most complicated and allusive meanings conceivable. Facing squarely the challenge that poetry has become the cultivation of unintelligibility, they seem bent upon proving that no poem is un- intelligible provided one works over it hard enough. William Emp- son's Seven Types of Ambiguity , for instance, almost begins a new era in the criticism of poetry. Every one interested in poetry will come away from its reading a better qualified critic. But it is heady wine and sets up so obsessive a search for meanings that many are discovered, even by Empson himself, which are probably not there. Such a charge has already been brought against Empson. It has been claimed that some of his meanings are idiosyncratically personal re- actions resulting from his use of psychology. I would modify this criticism by complaining not that he uses psychology, but that he uses it the way Richards does, in a vacuum. Empson's method, like Richards', ignores the social or historical referent. This weakness of his book, therefore, is concrete illustration of the weakness of Richards' use of psychology in his Principles of Literary Criticism. Once you make psychological laws a new kind of philosophical abso- lute (and especially intriguing because it seems to be a scientific</page><page sequence="3">THE CULT OF THE COMPLEX IN POETRY 33 absolute), their application to poetry is bound to turn up a great variety of meanings, all of which will seem to the individual con- cerned of equal value and validity. At the same time, to another per- son some of the meanings will appear valid, others fantastic. And the criterion for distinguishing between the two will not be merely the other reader's reaction, but the discovery that the fantastic mean- ings have neglected the social referent, whereas the valid ones will have taken it into account. Though the critic will be unconscious of the distinction and all his meanings will seem to him equally universal, these responses of other informed readers, in the process of proving they are not universal, expose the methodological principle that psychological laws have no meaning when divorced from the social context. When divorce is attempted, the result will be the paradox: that the method chosen precisely to do away with unin- telligibility has only introduced a new instance of it. In fact, the very title of Empson's book illustrated the pull to- ward the esoteric set up by his use of his method. For Empson pre- fers not to use the word ' 'ambiguity" in its popular sense, but to transform it into a technical term of his own. Popularly, an am- biguity is unfortunate because it means a statement that is mis- leading because it contains unresolved contradictions. The words "democracy" and "freedom," for instance, are prime examples of contemporary ambiguous statement since they hold opposite mean- ings latent within them, so that we come more and more to associate ambiguity with hypocrisy. But Empson means no such thing by it. He employs the word solely to denote the fact, quite correctly, that a poetic statement holds in suspension a great variety and in- tricacy of interpretations. But this is all that has been traditionally meant by the word "metaphor." There is no little pretentious- ness in twisting ambiguity to mean metaphor; so that, in one prone to psychological interpretations, the suspicion arises that such a mind is bound to wring far-fetched meanings out of the poetic phrase, as well as entirely plausible and helpful ones. And this is just what Empson does. But Empson's provincialism is more than an instance of the cult- ism of so much contemporary criticism of poetry, that sense of form- ing a superior professional elite. This elite exists today in its own estimation, and Empson's second evidence of provincialism is his</page><page sequence="4">34 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY taking over its peculiar taste in poetry. It should put the reader of his Seven Types on guard that almost all the poetry forming the basis for his interpretations is the highly cerebral poetry of the Brit- ish seventeenth century, not Shakespeare, not Milton, not Words- worth, not Whitman, but Donne and Vaughan and so forth. His preference is for the poetry of the casuist, and he sets it neither against any objective audience of its readers, nor against the poet's sensi- tivity as disclosed by his own biography, but against his own sensi- tivity as an audience of one. The poem for him is thus objective in only one sense, as a pattern of words. It is a communication in the single sense that it is a communication to Mr. Empson, whose reactions are supposed to represent, without discrimination, all the possible meanings the poem can hold for anyone at any time. Thus there is very little reference in his criticism to the changed meaning of words, very little use of the New Oxford Dictionary. The result is not merely the imposition upon the poem, by an over-clever mind, of meanings no one else can be certain are there. A worse conse- quence is a misconception of the fundamental nature of poetry itself. For although poetry may be, and the poetry Empson prefers cer- tainly is, a kind of superior cross-word puzzle (each phrase a diamond flashing its nuances of color and the whole a ring of enchanting de- sign demanding and rewarding the most delicate attention)- char- acteristically poetry has not been of so limited and so strenuous an appeal. This is a reflection hardly discoverable by a critic who tears a poem from its context, who bases his method on the poets who ap- peal to him and not on the entire history of poetry. Let me take as an illustration of meanings in poetry that Empson misses, a line revered by a critic whom Richards, if not Empson, would surely respect. Matthew Arnold found one of the lines of greatest poetic value Dante's "In Thy will is our peace." Such a line becomes almost banal when subjected to Empson's method. Not much dissection of it is possible within its limits. On the contrary, to Empson the line must seem scarcely poetry at all, only a theo- logical statement so put as to awaken an associated emotional re- sponse. I think Arnold overrates the line because he, in his own way, like Empson, reads without a sense of history, which becomes, in literary criticism, an insensitivity to reactions different from one's own. To neglect the historical approach (hoisting Arnold upon his</page><page sequence="5">THE CULT OF THE COMPLEX IN POETRY 35 own petard, if you please), is to fall victim to history by promoting the fallacy that one's contemporary estimate represents a universally valid interpretation. To the historical approach, on the contrary, Dante's line is great poetry for men or cultures that have a spontane- ous belief in a monolithic, omnipotent, just and kindly God. To such a God the merely human individual submits his will; or, if he doesn't, gets a reaction of having sinned; he knows he should have. However (for I do not reject Empson's method, only his non- social use of it), there is an "ambiguity" in the line. Persons who are so captivated by the authority and the benevolence of an earthly dictator may get a similar response. Having virtually deified, say, a Hitler, an individual may get a reaction similar to Arnold's. We may believe there must be a qualitative difference. The peace Hitler brought to a devout follower, we may feel, was only of the surface, temporary. Beneath it was a sadism at war with the whole intention of the line which he showed in insane attacks upon Jews and other "inferior" races. (But perhaps earlier Christian pogroms were not so different in psychological motivation.) At all events, Arnold was not only incapable of understanding such an interpretation as this second one; he would not have believed that an individual in his right mind and unperverted by sin could have rejected Arnold's own interpretation of the line. Yet for many persons today, not merely for the one-third of mankind that has adopted a materialistic philosophy of life, but for the many religious sceptics who are not behind the Iron Curtain, the line must awaken a response of distaste, to say the least. To those inhabitants of the globe who believe that organized religion is the opium of the people, the line must appear a subtle attempt at enslavement. It does not matter to my argument whether they are right or wrong. The fact remains that for them the line is not a poetic statement at all. It is one they entirely reject, both with their minds and with their emotions. Nor, I should add, has the line ever appealed without special reservations to the Puritan mentality with its stout individualism, its demand to find its own way to God, its conviction (to put the line in the best light) that peace comes not from submission here and now but from struggle toward an ulti- mate state that might be characterized as submission. The Puritan substitute for the line is Milton's "They also serve who only stand</page><page sequence="6">36 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY and wait," with its ill-controlled impatience at the temporary im- possibility of individual activity, of turning individual initiative into channels of cooperation with the divine will. To work with God rather than under God has always been the Puritan tendency, so that the Puritan generally seems arrogant and, when he tries to as- sume the mantle of humility, appears the hypocrite. II Now I aver that these various interpretations of the line Arnold so much admired are beyond the scope of Empson's understanding of an "ambiguity." They have nothing to do with the meaning of a line as Empson generally interprets it. For, according to his use of his method, the line is fairly bare of "ambiguity." Its philo- sophical meaning is clear. It is Thomism making its fundamental statement to the man in the street. Its effect upon personality is equally simple. The state of tranquility the line assumes is not a complex one, but instead recommends the eradication of complexity, of those ambiguities which Dante, as a scholastic, unlike Donne (who however crabbed in manner could not be a scholastic in sub- stance), differs from Empson in regarding not as delightfully com- plex, but as consequent upon the conflict in man between sin and virtue (which, in our psychological language, set up inner conflicts preventing a life of virtue). According to Dante's line everything Empson stands for, his paralyzing ambiguities, is delusion that leads to sin. The power of the line, then, for those who can accept it, lies squarely in its contradiction of everything that according to Empson makes a poem interesting and hence valuable, in its overwhelming rejection of those psychological conflicts which on the level of "poetic meanings" are ambiguities, and in its complete attainment of an unambiguous simplicity of meaning. It is true that Empson does not extend his method into a philosophy of art, but it is equally true that his method sets up a tendency to regard the value of a poem as proportional to the quantity of ambiguity in it. In terms of the life situation to which the poem corresponds, this is tantamount to saying that the most disturbed and wayward eras, those least cer- tain of their direction, the most paralyzed in their capacity to act, produce the greatest poetry.</page><page sequence="7">THE CULT OF THE COMPLEX IN POETRY 37 We are caught in such a world now. It is one in which the ab- sence of any generally accepted orientation of attitude is as con- spicuous as its presence was characteristic of the Middle Ages of Dante. At the very time when its absence is making for a ruinous complexity in our practical affairs, Mr. Empson, with his refusal to look beyond the impression which the immediate verbal construc- tion of the poem makes upon him as a highly gifted individual, can hardly be aware of the parallel between his approach to poetry and the state of the world of practical affairs. He can hardly recog- nize that his method, when applied to modern poetry like that of Hart Crane or the French Symbolists, sanctions and promotes what in the life of the streets is the malady itself. It was, in fact, I be- lieve, the nature of the contemporary scene and the poetry that re- flects it, which led him (as it has done his generation) back to Donne, to the most complex and representative poet of a similarly disorganized period, as the exemplar of what poetry essentially is. But if one has regard for these socio-psychological factors I have been stressing, he will recognize that the problem of poetic mean- ing, like all problems of meaning, is fundamentally sociological. With such an orientation, he will reach an evaluation of poetry the opposite to Empson's. He will find that poems which are rela- tively bare of significance according to Empson's canons become rich with meaning, unfold a different order of complexity, once these sociological perspectives are applied to them. As illustration I should like to refer to one of Wordsworth's Lucy poems, which Empson would find scarcely worth talking about. And, since I have used a single line from Dante, it might be well to begin with the analogous lines in Wordsworth's poem. But she is in her grave, and, oh, The difference to me! Now these lines surely present no appetizing complexity to awaken the interest of the acute dissecting intelligence. Nor do they attract by the slightest distinction of language. Wordsworth is here using the diction of the common man with a vengeance, and the common grammatical structure of prose speech. Nor is there any trace of metaphor. Taken by themselves, the lines are plain prose state-</page><page sequence="8">38 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY ment. Thus taken, indeed, they set up a rather feeble poetic re sponse. The situation changes, however, when they are read, not by themselves, but as the conclusion of a whole poem. (For readers familiar with the poem, they cannot, in fact, be otherwise read since remembered associations cannot be put out of mind.) She dwelt among the untrodden ways Beside the springs of Dove, A Maid whom there were none to praise And very few to love: A violet by a mossy stone Half hidden from the eye I -Fair as a star, when only one Is shining in the sky. She lived unknown, and few could know When Lucy ceased to be; But she is in her grave, and, oh, The difference to me. Now it seems to me that this is one of the finest of British poems. Although of no complexity according to Empson's seven types, when approached, not through analysis of the phrase, but in the light of its total impact, that is to say, by another and a more normal criterion of criticism, it surrenders an important meaning of another order of complexity. It communicates a particular type ol personality in a particular state of feeling. And it is not possible even to begin explaining this type of complexity without making an initial reference to history. Such a poem does not exist, so far as I know) in the world's literature before Wordsworth, and could not exist before for the simple reason that such a type of personality could not exist before. There is a new type of duality in the speaker. He is a man conscious of his unimportant place in society, and yet unrepressed, speaking, that is to say, having enough confidence in himself and his own values to utter them, and permitted by his society to have both the inner confidence and its outward expression. The poem is built upon a clear, unambiguous recognition of two</page><page sequence="9">THE CULT OF THE COMPLEX IN POETRY 39 contradictory objective facts: the one, the values prevalent in society, prevalent in the dominant class; the other, his own, different set of values, as representative of a social minority. In the previous history of poetry it would be virtually impossible to find a poem in which the person speaking rejects in advance the possibility of one-ness with his audience. The poet is not even con- scious of his being representative of an oppressed group- the poor, unfashionable, country people. He is conscious solely of his isola- tion, even within his minority, as an individual. It is Byronism in reverse. The individual here seeks not to win the majority to his individual attitudes (assuming the possibility of one-ness by the very fact of his appeal), but rather he assumes the permanence of his iso- lation. In the period immediately preceding Wordsworth, a man who felt as he here does would either not have had the courage to speak or would have spoken with a note of eccentricity. If he spoke, it would be as a Stephen Duck. When he was silent, he might be pitied by his betters, as Gray pities his mute inglorious Miltons. Go further back, into periods when democracy and individualism have not yet written themselves into the human consciousness, and such an attitude does not appear in any form. It is a phenom- enon distinctly of our modern world, even though, of course, a minority phenomenon still. It testifies to a kind of relationship between an individual and a society, which, though doubtless existing before, could not become distinct and verbalized until the soil was ready for it. For this is fundamentally a poem of an era of rapid social change. The broader meaning of the poem contrasts two sets of values belonging to two social classes. Its blend of shyness, modesty and at the same time complete self-sufficiency guarantees that the audience the poet rejects will not reject his poem. But it is not a matter of the proper values being the property of the poor and the neglected, and the superficial worldly ones being conspicuous in the lives of the very audience the poet addresses, as the book- buying public of his time. He can count on his audience not having entirely rejected his sense of values. The proper values, as he sees them, thus cut across class lines to the extent that the well-to-do, in his generation, once having been poor, having risen, so to speak, from the log cabin, will retain in their inner hearts</page><page sequence="10">40 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY some repressed belief in the values they no longer practice. But this background of the poem is not stressed in it. Instead, against it, the poem develops as a highly individualistic perform- ance. Even within his class, the poet thinks of himself as an indi- vidual. He is almost as isolated from his class as his class from the audience of the poem. And it is by using both types of isola- tion that the poem gains its climax of tremendous power. By assuming that no other person, no audience of any sort, can com- prehend his personal reactions, and yet by expressing his reac- tions with complete sincerity in terms of observable details, whose validity no one would dispute, he manages to move us deeply by what he tells us we cannot understand. It is, essentially, within a small compass, the method of Dante. For Dante, by using detail in such a cumulative way, at the end of the Paradiso, by merely con- fessing as a theological fact the impossibility of describing the union with God, secures an overwhelming sense of its power and its reality. Of course, there is a limit to the validity of this analogy. There is a difference between saying: I cannot describe union with God adequately either to you or to myself, and saying: I cannot convey to anyone else my emotions at the death of this young girl. Of the two, I must confess I draw the greater intensity of impres- sion from Wordsworth. Since we are here dealing with a human situation, the type of situation is quite within our comprehension. We cannot, indeed, fully respond to this particular source of grief, but if we have had a similar one, we will similarly understand its incommunicability. It has often been said that every man has to die alone. Here we are told that he has to grieve alone, that no other person can penetrate the particularity and hence reproduce the intensity of emotion in a situation where intimate love or friendship has been irrevocably broken. Indeed, through this most extreme example, Wordsworth states a truth that becomes more important with the progress of man- kind. For we have a sense of our individuality today of an in- tensity unknown in previous history. The burden of our con- sciousness of ourselves as individuals is no longer lightened by any strong sense of belonging within a class or group. Our knowledge of psychological principles makes us more aware than ever before of what goes on within us as separate persons. Especially when a</page><page sequence="11">THE CULT OF THE COMPLEX IN POETRY 41 competitive society reinforces this sense of our separateness, our sense of being alone in situations of negative emotional impact, situations of grief rather than love, becomes acute in proportion to the degree of emotion. As far as these meanings of the poem are concerned, Wordsworth has written one of the distinctive and significant poems of our whole era. And if we no longer take it as such, it is, I think, that we are no longer capable of the degree of self-control Wordsworth in his earlier period was able to achieve. There is, however, a hint of what I should call a more modern meaning to the poem in the lines A Maid whom there were none to praise And very few to love: These lines suggest that, if Lucy had been loved by few and praised by none, she had been neglected for other reasons than living in a remote place and sharing its minority position. She was not so much a person of commonplace and unfashionable exterior as possessed of certain traits making her generally unpopular in all circles. In proportion as the poet loves a girl who is not even liked by persons of similar social position and simplicity of life on the farm, his poem goes beyond a rejection of the conventional for its superficiality and states a preference not so much for pro- found sincere inner qualities of personality as for detachment and waywardness. It idealizes a girl who is not merely shy at first sight, but whose shyness conceals an unpleasant rejection of other peo- ple. The "modern" note, therefore, is this choice for a heroine of a neurotic personality. Under the poet's own shy and tranquil wording is an identification with attitudes not alone valued as right in themselves, but primarily valued because they express a defiance of society. If these lines are significant to the poem, the emphasis on class interpretation I have been making becomes invalid. But it turns out they are not so. Not only does the poet's overt manner of expression shift the emphasis away from any neurotic content; the poet himself takes over the poem. It is not Lucy's disposition that comes to count, but the poet's reaction to her death, and this reaction, as I have said, is not a limited neurotic one, but one virtually universal in our modern western world.</page><page sequence="12">42 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY III In such interpretations as these I fail to see anything "simple/ On the contrary they show that the simplest combinations of simple words procure effects as complex in their own way as Donne's ironies and cerebrations. Such a poem as this, instead, seems to me of a healthier and more nearly universal order. Most great poetry has been closer in method to Wordsworth than to Donne, as Wordsworth himself knew. Let me take, for instance, the closing lines of Aeschylus' Prometheus Bound. 'Tis Zeus who driveth his furies To smite me with terror and madness. O Mother Earth all-honored, O Air revolving thy light A common boon to all, Behold what wrongs I endure. Here, as in Wordsworth, the immediate meaning of the lines is not involved or obscure. They present no difficult metaphors, but come very near making a plain prose statement. They state the fact of Zeus' persecution of Prometheus in an appeal to earth and air, that, since they provide a common boon to man, are presumed sympathetic. Nor is the philosophy latent in the lines obscure. There is an unresolved contradiction in it, but one not expressed in an * 'ambiguous" way. The powerful divine person, Zeus, has acted in retaliation while earth and air (who are now being appealed to) have been passive. The lines take for granted that Zeus is a god. They do not with equal clarity define earth and air in the same fashion, though both are personified by the word "mother." But a little knowledge of Greek philosophy demolishes any apparent ambiguity here and justifies our taking the words spontaneously in modern fashion. They represent the tradition of Greek mate- rialism, according to which the earth is mother in the sense that men are part of a universal order of nature. The contradiction is, there- fore, between two philosophical systems, the religious and the ma- terialistic, both existing in Greek society and hence in the conscious- ness of Prometheus.</page><page sequence="13">THE CULT OF THE COMPLEX IN POETRY 43 Complexity enters when it is recognized that the play is ending with this contradiction, however clearly put, unresolved. However it may or may not have been resolved in the lost plays of the trilogy, this play by itself seems to be representative of the Greek state of mind. The contradiction could not be resolved because each system is mutually exclusive and neither adequately explains the nature of human experience. Greek materialism, which ought to show men happy in the bosom of nature, fails to explain the unhappiness which is certainly an aspect of human life. But the religion that explains the unhappiness contradicts certain convictions of Prometheus which become clear when these lines are taken in their context as con- clusion to the tragedy: that is to say, man accepts as good rather than evil, his ambition to better his lot in nature by using nature with the completest freedom from taboo and superstition. Prometheus has inherited two concepts which are in fundamental contradiction, and if he is different from other men, it is that he has acted in response to the less popular one. These are the verbal meaning of the lines, and they are getting fairly complex. But again their complexity is not in the phrasing (as Empson would have it), but in the fact that the simplest idea becomes complex when related to human experi- ence. More specifically in regard to this play, it lies in the fact that ideas which are invalid or only partially true become particularly Talmudic when brought into touch with life. The dilemma of the play disappears with a more adequate definition of materialism. The play does not, however, become worthless to one who reads it in the light of this more adequate definition of its inner antithesis which would allow for human suffering. But it does change its meaning. To such a reader (as distinguished from Prometheus), it is not Zeus and the religion he represents that has caused the suffering. Zeus must now symbolize the opposition within society to progress. The dilemma has disappeared and a clear differentia- tion of right and wrong has taken its place. Wrong has triumphed in the external situation. But right, now represented by Prometheus' continued defiance of Zeus even though he still fears and suffers from his power, remains indomitable in his personality. His stand remains, for instance, the opposite to that of Dante. Prometheus, both by his activity and in his final state of mind, has unqualifiedly protested the validity of Arnold's quotation. He has not believed</page><page sequence="14">44 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY that the fulfillment of the good life can be found in submission to the will of God. To him suffering is preferable to such a conception of peace of mind. In our day the temptation is strong to reduce all conflict to the subjective, to take the play of Aeschylus like a novel of Kafka, as a picture of "inner conflicts"; but this is to defy its text. This text, like all texts, sets limits to the number of symbolic interpreta- tions made tempting and indeed necessary when a quite different society reads it. Here the limit is the fact that the play is so written that the conflict must remain in the objective world. The suffering must remain physical, imposed from without. It is distinctly not Prometheus' inner personality that is torn apart. The gulf is be- tween him and something outside himself. His belief in progress is no rationalization to conceal a masochistic need to defy in order that he may perversely enjoy suffering. This is not to say that Prometheus is entirely free from anxiety, only that he is not mastered by it. "Terror and madness" are what Zeus intends his furies to impose. The final lines give evidence that the strength of Prometheus' personality will defeat the inten- tion. But whatever anxiety there is in Prometheus must have been of a different order from that any modern reader can secure. To the modern materialist who must take the furies as the religious symbol for social pressures, they become quite literally the forces of reac- tion. As storm troopers translated by an act of the imagination into specific material uniforms, they will be feared and defied without a trace of superstition. But to Prometheus, of course, such an inter- pretation was impossible. The philosophical dilemma that existed for him necessitated a certain acount of belief in the legitimacy of the powers of Zeus, and hence a certain amount of anxiety, such as, for instance, Luther, fresh from rejection of Catholicism, felt when he threw the inkwell at the devil. These residues of superstition in him must have given the phrase, "the furies," a different and richer meaning than any modern reader can draw from it. Even moderns in whom religion is still active find a different meaning for it in their different social setting. Their religion is associated with personal virtue and accepts the ideal of progress. They might have similar reactions of anxiety in connection with the concept of "the furies," if that concept were associated with blasphemy or adultery, but since</page><page sequence="15">THE CULT OF THE COMPLEX IN POETRY 45 it is instead associated with a concept they accept, the emotive con- tent of superstition evoked by the phrase dwindles to next to nothing and leaves them in practically the same state as the modern sceptic. Such meanings as these, however, cannot be turned up by a criti- cal method content with the immediate personal reactions of an ob- server under the guidance alone of his personal experience of life. They emerge only when the critic has involved in his interpretations the fullest information of which he is capable regarding the meaning of words as they have been actually used by human beings. For any past literature the anthropological approach is obligatory if it is im- portant to avoid giving our contemporary meanings to older texts. If it be granted that poetic meanings are powerfully emotional and that emotional responses are less conceptual than psychological in quality, the obligation grows more imperative. Such an approach applied to this play, would begin with a recognition that the Greeks although further away from primitive man than any other ancient people, remained closer to him than has any modern. Although of all ancient peoples, the Greeks grounded themselves most in the ob- served fact, "accepted the universe" of nature, to aid them in es- caping anthropomorphic fallacies, they relied chiefly upon systems of logic and had only rudiments of scientific method. The area of superstition surviving among them must thus have been greater than ours in proportion as logic falls short of scientific method in giving security by its successful control over nature. If this is so, the phrase regarding the furies must have carried for them an emotive meaning both more intense and of a different quality from any we can draw from it. It could not become a merely poetic abstraction. It must have represented the very real survival of primitive fears, ordinary suppressed by a rational, logical view of experience. It set the limit to the utility of logic working upon direct observation of nature as a mechanism for gaining security in nature. Most of the "poetry" of these lines concerning Zeus has been drained away by the very triumph of that conception of progress Prometheus espoused. I know that I am treading upon ground that many scholars and critics consider to offer no secure footing. And I accept their criti- cism that, despite the aid of anthropology or what not, such interpre- tations as I have been making are at best inferential. But the critic</page><page sequence="16">46 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY has only the choice of limiting himself to certainties without any considerable value or hazarding valuable interpretations which must remain probabilities. We know well enough from our extensive investigations into contemporary responses to art that these less tangible factors, because of their high emotional potential, are basic in its appreciation. The bare idea in art is nothing without these overtones which register convictions as to its value and validity. In art, value and validity are not proved by intellectual processes whether logical or scientific, but by the presence of these very emo- tive elements which record man's degree of belief in his assevera- tions. We may rationalize our motives, but we never can so ra- tionalize these overtones of our statement, and our actions always correspond to them and but rarely to our rationalizations. Hence any investigation into the way in which we take art is itself of value only as these factors are taken into account. In such a situation I prefer to rest in the probability rather than confine myself to state- ments of no significance for our actual spontaneous experience of the arts. To neglect to follow this course lands us unwittingly in the fallacy of imposing upon the art of the past our spontaneous con- temporary understanding of it and thus smuggling into both our theory and our appreciation of art an invalid universal. By mis- understanding the value of past art to those who enjoyed it, by fail- ing to apply to it the canons of interpretation which we accept as in- controvertible when applied to our own art, we merely project our attitudes upon the past and conclude we are dealing with universal reactions. As an instance of this fallacious approach, I should like to refer to a recent New York performance by the Old Vic Players of Sopho- cles' Oedipus Tyrannus. There was a consensus of opinion in the press that the play had been superbly presented by this talented British stock company. There was no doubt that the American audi- ences had been deeply moved by the play. But, as I listened to re- marks between the acts and sensed the temper of the audience as it left the theater, I began to wonder if its impression of the play was at all similar to that which the Athenian audience probably, in the light of Aristotle's comment, got from it. I could see no trace in the New York audience of a therapeutic purgation.

If it had been purged, it would not have been depressed; there would have been the usual conversation one hears upon leaving the theater instead of this morbid silence, this difficulty even of physical movement as though no one could detach himself from what he had seen without a conscious effort. Unless Aristotle was a less keen observer and more of a spinner of abstract speculations than I believe him to have been, I could not conceive of an Athenian audience leaving the amphi- theater in a similar state of mind. My observation craved an explanation. I found it in the proba- bility that the very factors which permitted a purgation to the Greeks forbade one to the Amercian audience. The play had depressed the Americans not because there was so much blood on Oedipus' face, but because it had revealed to them the impossibility of their own purgation. The Athenian audience could come away with its state of tension broken because, bringing to the play a functioning belief in certain principles of conduct, the spectacle of these beliefs working in society was highly reassuring. What the play brought home to the American audience was the fact that its spectacle of beliefs work- ing in another society only reminded them of the absence of similar belief to work for them. The logic of the play was simple. Oedipus had broken the taboo upon incest; he had acted in a significant situation from rage rather than seasoned judgment, and by so doing had brought harm upon a people for whom he was responsible as their ruler. The universal acceptance of these prescriptions was made plain by the fact that it did not matter that their violation was in ignorance and the fact that Oedipus anticipated by his own action the social penalty whose legiti- macy he thus advertised to the whole society. The play therefore only reminded the American audience of the relativity of our prin- ciples of conduct and the inconsistency of our laws. We drew from it only the reminder that there are few situations in which any one of us could act with the certainty and dispatch of an Oedipus. I did not note that there was any class division in the audience. Poor and well-to-do alike left depressed. Whatever principles either group may have had as a group did not serve them in this context since the play thrust upon their attention the necessity for a whole society to have</page><page sequence="18">48 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY its integrity if the individual would feel secure within it. If these interpretations of mine were correct, the meaning of the play had reversed itself over the centuries. The words remained the same. But a difference in the objective social situation had reversed their significance. Such examples not only clarify our definition of poetry, but change our basic attitude toward it. They remind us that, contrary to a delusion established for centuries, it is prose rather than poetry which keeps its meaning. Prose is so written that little or no latitude of interpretation is possible. Its meaning remains intact for us to accept or to reject it. There is scant possibility of difference of inter- pretation of the Satyricon or Moll Flanders. The fact that these novels were products of two different societies is self-evident. It is this very rigidity of meaning that reduces our freedom in the use of them and forces us into awareness of our own differences of atti- tude. Poetry seems the more universal precisely because its com- pression of meaning, its more general statement, affords us much latitude in reading our own attitudes into it. The process is so spon- taneous that we seldom stop to inquire whether these attitudes of ours are the same as those other audiences have drawn from the same text. But when we do inquire, our reward is much more important than any criticism of the universality of poetry as an artistic prin- ciple. By becoming aware of the rich meanings the apparently simplest verbalizations of poetry hold for us, when it is studied in the light of its social relations, we also become the more fascinated by those equally rich but somewhat different meanings it can hold for other audiences. Poetry may no longer in the old fashion receive the awe of the immortal. It has taken on a greater significance as a revelation of how men live and act together.
