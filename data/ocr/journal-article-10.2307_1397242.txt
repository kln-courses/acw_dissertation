<plain_text><page sequence="1">HARIDAS CHAUDHURI Existentialism and Vedanta EXISTENTIALISM is a very significant philosophical move- ment of the present age. It focuses attention upon the predicament of modern man, his alienation from existence, his loss of contact with Being. It calls at- tention to the fundamental crisis of the present age, which consists in man's experience of the metaphysical void, his radical doubt and despair, his horror of "the death of God," and his disenchantment with the glamor of material- ism and technology. It lays stress upon man's essential need for a restoration of his sense of the mystery of Being, his compassionate participation in the joys and sorrows of fellow beings, and his active realization of full freedom and responsibility inherent in existence. The development of philosophic thought in the West has, over the cen- turies, turned full circle. It started with the pre-Socratic Greek philosophers' concern with the nature of Being and Socrates' critical inquiry into the self or the mystery of human existence. Then it entered into a long phase of ob- jective exploration. It set out to investigate the transcendent realm of essences, ideas, universals, and structural principles of the objective world. It bent its energies toward the construction of massive metaphysical systems, intellectual schemes, rigidly defined ideologies, and ethical codes. Having lost contact with pure existence, it erected all manner of false absolutes. It lent logical support to the theological absolute of an anthropomorphic or supernatural God, the intellectual absolute of universal reason, the political absolute of the state or ideology, the ethical absolute of duty or right, the scientific abso- lute of objectivity, and the technological absolute of the machine. A long history of conflict and suffering, domination and destruction, doubt and despair, has slowly cast a thick shadow of doubt upon such absolutes. Pseudo- absolutes have the effect of dehumanizing man in the name of the supra- human. Consequently, attention is being directed once more to the imperative need for man's reunion with Being, reintegration with pure existence, or the re-discovery of his pure subjectivity. An emphasis upon the need for orientation toward pure existence or Being has always been the dominant characteristic of the wisdom of the East. It would be interesting, therefore, to institute a brief comparison here between existentialism and Vedanta, the most coherent philosophic expression of the spirit of Indian culture. Vedanta has always stressed the need for man's re- 3</page><page sequence="2">4 HARIDAS CHAUDHURI integration with pure Being (Sat, Brahman) or with the inmost center of his own existence (atman). Pure Being has been regarded as the source of all values and of the supreme fulfillment of human life.' Now, there are different philosophical schools of Vedanta, such as those of Samkara, Rdmanuja, Madhva, Nimbdrka, Vallabha, Caitanya, and others, which interpret in various ways the original teaching of the Vedas and Upanisads. In modern times, Swami Vivekananda popularized the message of the Vedanta in the West, with special emphasis upon its universality of out- look and its ability to harmonize the different historical religions of the world.2 In still more recent times, Sri Aurobindo presented Vedanta as an all- comprehending dynamic outlook on life which is capable of reconciling, not only different metaphysical schools and systems, but also such divergent values of life as the material and the spiritual, the intellectual and the in- tuitive, the humanistic and the transcendental. Turning to existentialism, we find that this also is a very broad philosophi- cal movement covering a wide variety of concepts, insights, and tendencies. There is the Christian existentialism of Soren Kierkegaard, Karl Jaspers, Gabriel Marcel, and others. And there is the non-Christian existentialism of Martin Heidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre, Albert Camus, and others. After one existentialist philosopher has defined existentialism in a particular way, others have felt like denouncing the label and keeping free of all association with it. But underlying its wide divergencies of viewpoint there are some broad tendencies and basic insights which have brought together Christians and non-Christians, theists and atheists, theologians and Godless metaphysi- cians, novelists and ontologists, within this most vital and thought-provoking existentialist movement of contemporary times. The purpose of this paper is to concentrate on some significant concepts of existentialism and to consider how they can be related to the corresponding essential concepts of the Vedanta. While calling attention to noteworthy points of similarity, some essential differences also will be indicated. By the Vedanta, we mean here the original teaching of the Upanisads and the Bhagavad Gita as understood by the author. 1 Taittiriya Upanisad II.i.1. 2No editor listed, Letters of Swami Vivekananda (Mayavati: Advaita Ashram, 1948), pp. 222-223. 3Sri Aurobindo, The Life Divine (Pondicherry: Sri Aurobindo Ashram, 1955), Vol. I, chaps. 2, 3, 4.

Modern man seems to have lost the ontological sense, the sense of his organic relationship to Being. Uprootbd from the matrix of existence, he is plunged into an age of anxiety, doubt, and despair. Thousands upon thou- sands of people are experiencing today what has been called "the shattering of existence"' under the impact of the ringing words of Nietzsche, "God is dead."5 Man finds himself a stranger in an alien universe. He is faced with a world from which the old gods have disappeared, the ancient all-too-familiar traditional values have been liquidated, and, in consequence, a terrifying metaphysical void has been created in the minds of those who think. This estrangement of man from the ground of existence has been oc- casioned by different factors. The first contributing factor has been the trend of intellectualism, rationalism, or preoccupation with the false metaphysic of essences. Plato's doctrine of Ideas, Aristotle's theory of a logically defined hierarchy of substances, the medieval theory of universals, and the massive metaphyical systems of Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Hegel, and others have presented intellectual constructions as the essence of Being. But no trans- cendent realm of essences can be a fit substitute for the true essence, "the essential essence," of Being. No system of ideas and concepts, however vast and ingeniously constructed, can reproduce the infinite fullness of concrete existence. "Existence precedes essence."6 Edmund Husserl, following the method of "phenomenological reduction,"7' called attention to the basic reality of the subject and its intuitive consciousness. But even Husserl eventually fell into the snare of essentialism by reason of his ecstatic pre- occupation with the description of objects and phenomena as his main in- tellectual concern. What is of fundamental importance in life is to be able to exist: to exist in the presence of God, as Kierkegaard would say, freely choosing between the unauthentic natural life and the authentic religious life;" to exist as a "guardian of Being," as Martin Heidegger would say, seeking to unveil the 4F.

The individual feels utterly helpless in the grip of colossal organized structures. Instead of being able to say, "I am what I am," he Ihas to say, "I am as you desire me."'13 He experiences what may be called the loss of substance or the eclipse of the soul. Wherever he looks he is over- whelmed with the sight of big corporations, big labor unions, big political parties, big power blocs. He realizes that the best way of survival is to be able to sell himself to the highest bidder. Thus he develops the marketing orientation. He looks upon himself as a marketable commodity, with a price tag determined by the interplay of the forces of supply and demand. He tries to forget his intrinsic value. He suppresses the voice of the inner self, ignoring the aspirations and potentialities of his inmost nature. But as soon as he is enrolled in one of those highly organized structures he feels doubly lost. He is reduced to a number, to a registration card, or to a certain unit of energy to be utilized in some specific ways. Big business wants him not to develop his exceptional qualities but to remain mediocre and to follow the safe path of automaton conformity. Big politics does not want him to follow his own sense of spiritual values but to improve his efficiency as a useful cog in the political apparatus with which his fate is irretrievably bound up. This is especially true of dictatorial organizations. But in competing with dictator- ships even democracies have to mobilize all their resources with an urgent demand for conformity. There are parties and slogans and states and ide- ologies. The smartest individuals are those who know how to fit into such 9 Martin Heidegger, Existence and Being, D. Scott, R. F. C. Hall, A.

The third factor in the situation of alienation is the dazzling glamor of materialism. It is important, to be stre, to have a fairly good standard of living and to secure improvement in the material conditions of existence. But overemphasis upon materialistic pursuits and embellishments has a degrading effect upon human nature. Having produced a passionate attach- ment to material possessions, materialism blinds men to the higher values of life. It prompts men to fight for vested interests at any cost. Thus mutually destructive forces are released. Uncompromising war-mentality is generated. Annihilation seems preferable to non-possession, because one who has noth- ing is nothing. People become possessed by matter. Their personalities are "devoured" by their accumulated property. They lose their sense of "being" and are dominated by the spirit of "having."'"5 The unceasing striving for "having" sets the pattern of living. The sense of the holy and of the sanctity of existence is destroyed. Reverence for life as such is considered foolish sentimentality. And thus the ground is prepared for man's callous inhumanity to man. The fourth factor in the modern predicament is the unprecedented techno- logical revolution of the present age. Technology has mechanized life on an enormous scale and has in consequence brought about a tragic depersonaliza- tion of human nature. A high premium is set on the nature of man as a tool- making animal. But the gigantic tools of his own creation have a tendency to go out of control. Man, the master of machines, is faced with the danger of becoming a victim and helpless slave of machines. Overemphasis upon the technical know-how has the effect of obscuring the intangible spiritual dimension of existence, which is the source of all higher values. The de- humanization of man emerges as a necessary sequel to the deification of the machine. But technology has invaded not only the physical existence and the eco- nomic-political sphere of man; what is still more dangerous, it has also in- vaded the realm of deeper philosophic thinking. Many philosophers today are busy inventing an appropriate logical technology to handle effectively the spiritual and philosophical problems of man. Such technological trans- formation of philosophy has reduced it to the status of a mere technique for the clarification of linguistic usage and elucidation of the various proposi- 14 Heidegger, Existence and Being, p. 389. 15 Heinemann, Existentialism and the Modern Predicament, p. 143.</page><page sequence="6">8 HARIDAS CHAUDHURI tions embodied in the sciences. Thus philosophy is degraded to an empty "talk about talk." It is in danger of losing all vital contact with existence, which is the true source of all creative inspiration and cultural efflorescence. Herein lies the reason for the increasing popularity of existentialism, which is a spirited protest against the technological alienation of man. Philosophy is nothing if it does not call man back to a renewed contact with the ultimate source of all Being. Its historic mission is to produce "a transformation, re- generation and renewal of the spirit in its deepest root."'"1 Direct insight into the heart of existence does not depend upon a logical apparatus, however wonderful. It depends, on the one hand, upon loving participation in the being of the world and, on the other, upon detached contemplation of the meaning of life in the context of the eternal. This is where the wisdom of the ancient sages as embodied in Vedanta, Tantra, Zen, Taoism, etc., has a rich contribution to make. True wisdom is not the product of any techno- logical procedure. It dwells in the heart of existence itself, and shines out when the artificial constructions of the human mind are set aside. As against logical positivism's overemphasis upon logical technology, it is so refreshing to hear a philosopher like Martin Heidegger declare: "Language is the home of Being." "Language has the task of making manifest in its work the existent, and of preserving it as such."16' It is, indeed, vitally important to supplement the program of formal-linguistic analysis by the principle of existence, and to reorient philosophic thinking to the ultimate goal of unveiling the light of the truth of Being. THE CONCEPT OF AVIDYA (NESCIENCE) IN THE VEDiNTA The problem of man's alienation from existence in various directions, then, is the stimulating starting point of the modern existentialist movement in philosophy. This problem has, indeed, assumed fearful proportions in modern times as a result of the industrial, political, and technological revolutions that have taken place. But this is a problem essentially co-extensive with the history of man. It is the problem of what the Vedanta calls metaphysical ignorance (avidy?, nescience). It consists in man's ignorance of the true nature of his own self and his relationship to Being (Brahman). He is essentially rooted in the unfathomable depth of Being, and so his inmost self is identical with Being." Alienated from his true nature, he develops an 16 Ibid., p. 204. Fichte's remark quoted. 17 Chandogya Upanisad III.xiv.4.</page><page sequence="7">EXISTENTIALISM AND VEDANTA 9 isolating, egocentric consciousness (aham)."s He sets himself up as a separate, self-enclosed entity, a sort of spiritual atom, separate from Being, separate from the external world, and separate from the rest of humanity. Thus, by the force of his own ignorance, he creates a prison for himself, condemning himself to live in a world of his owrf, cut off from the broad currents of uni- versal life. Estranged from existence through nescience, man's sense of "being" is replaced by an overriding urge for "having." He frantically runs after ma- terial possessions. He relies upon constant accumulation of means and things. And he develops a strong attachment (asakti) to them all. Such attachment is the objectified form of primal ignorance. Attachment further widens the gulf between him and his fellow beings. It prevents his free participation in the lives of others. It obstructs his free thinking in the search for truth. It stands in the way of his courageous vindication of the higher values of life, such as justice, righteousness, peace, etc. Attachment to property intensifies the longing for power, because power is needed to safeguard vested interests. An overriding will to power completes the process of self-alienation and de- humanization. It clears the ground for inhuman atrocities perpetrated in the name of humanity or of some supra-human deity or destiny. The Veddnta maintains that, if nescience in its negative form is alienation from existence, in its positive form it is false knowledge and dualistic think- ing. What is the nature of this false knowledge? It is the false knowledge of division, duality, separation (dvaita), and the knowledge of wrong super- imposition (adhyasa). Ignorance in this positive form of division and illusory superimposition is called maya in the Veddnta. Each individual human being in his isolated ego-consciousness lives in a world of his own. That is why the problem of communication is such a baf- fling one. He looks at the universe through the distorting medium of his own wishful thinking. He beholds his surroundings through the colored glasses of his own unconscious motivations and secret desires. This subjectively colored world springing from his primal nescience is unconsciously super- imposed upon Being. The world characterized by the dichotomies of his limited understanding is wrongly superimposed upon the real. It is like the illusory superimposition of the snake upon the rope in darkness. Owing to primal nescience, the true nature of Being is concealed (avarana), and the subjectively constructed world is projected (viksepa) thereupon. The intel- lect tries to penetrate to the heart of reality with the help of different thought- systems. But the intellect, which is unconsciously influenced by emotional 1s Swami Vireswarananda, Brahma-Sftras (Mayavati: Advaita Ashram, 1948), p. 4.</page><page sequence="8">10 HARIDAS CHAUDHURI factors, can hardly cut through the fallacy of false superimposition. The intellectually constructed systems of ideas and essences so often act as so many more barriers or veils interposed between man and Being. A particular metaphysic of essences represents at its best a particular aspect or perspective of Being. But Being, according to the Vedanta, is multiform and multi- dimensional. "There is one Being which sages call by various names.""1 So, no one metaphysical system, nor any number of systems combined, can ex- haustively express the fullness of Being. That is why the Vedanta holds that one must go beyond the realm of ideas and essences to attain an immediate contact with Being. One must transcend the trammels of the ego and the intellect in order to realize the self (dtman). One must tear the veil of mdya (the false superimposition of idea upon existence) in order to contact the real in its eternal freshness. The point of similarity here between the Veddntic approach and the existentialist protest against essentialism is obvious. There are also some points of distinction, however, which should not be ignored. The Vedanta and existentialism seem to be agreed that direct con- tact with existence can be achieved only by transcending the realm of uni- versals and essences. But still, the Vedanta repeatedly affirms the relative validity of different Weltanschauungs, or world views, as useful aids to man's search for Being. They are necessary phases of his response to the call of existence. Different intellectual systems try to articulate different aspects of life and reality. So, there is no doubt that they have pragmatic validity. They satisfy the psychic requirements of different types of people. They fulfill the needs of different classes of society. They represent the dominant hopes and aspirations of different historical epochs. Reflecting the passing winds of the intellectual climate and the changing faces of human society, different world- views serve the purpose of human evolution. But tragedy arises when a particular system of thought obstinately claims to represent the final and absolute truth. A grievous error is committed when a particular individual or group becomes fixated on a specific idea or conceptual scheme, failing to comprehend its relativity, refusing to advance beyond it, and violently op- posing all other viewpoints. Existentialists seem to lack the breadth of vision and the spirit of toleration which are characteristic of the Veddntic teaching. The Vedantist is eager to appreciate the truth, the relative truth in all philosophical systems, in all historic religions, in all political ideologies. In maintaining this comprehen- sive outlook, he often pays a price in terms of lukewarmness in the field of action. But he avoids the violent aggressiveness of fanatical action. He be- 19 Rg Veda I. 164.46.</page><page sequence="9">EXISTENTIALISM AND VEDANTA 11 lieves that it is possible, on the basis of genuine self-integration, to combine comprehensive understanding with effective action. Existentialism has a tendency to lay greater stress upon choice, commitment, and action, at the cost of comprehensive wisdom. It sets itself in sharp opposition to the es- sentialist modes of thinking. From the non-dualistic standpoint of the Vedinta, existentialism minimizes the importance of essences on account of its pre-occupation with the principle of existence. This creates a false dualism. If enchantment with ideas and essences amounts to an alienation from existence, their deprecation is decidedly harmful to the cause of civilization. Comprehension of essences provides us with objective value-criteria. In the absence of such value-criteria, our choice or freedom in the field of action becomes arbitrary. To be sure, we cannot reconstruct Being in terms of es- sences. But, also, we cannot deny the value of essences as significant elements in the structure of Being. They are practically useful perspectives of Being. They crystallize the deepest aspirations and dynamic potentialities of man. They provide valid standards of ethical action. Essences in the form of transcendent values, objective thought-systems, ethical principles, socio- political ideologies, etc., are essential factors, indeed, in the growth of civili- zation. The second aspect of false knowledge is reflected in ordinary dualistic thinking. This is what the Veddnta calls the deluded sense of duality (dvaita).2o According to the Veddnta, reality is non-dual (advaita).21 This does not mean that the dualities of our experience such as subject and object, mind and matter, spirit and Nature, God and the world, infinite and finite, etc., are not real. They are real insofar as they have relative validity. But they are not ultimately real inasmuch as they fall within the comprehensive unity of the same Being (Brahman). False knowledge, or ignorance, consists in losing sight of the fundamental unity of Being and in consequent bestowal of ultimate significance upon the dualities of common sense. THE FIRST STEP IN PHILOSOPHY Let us now look briefly at the dominant spirit of modern Western thought from this standpoint. Rene Descartes, the father of modern European philosophy, placed dual- ism at the center of his thinking. Starting with the cogito ergo sum, he af- firmed the radical dualism of mind and matter, soul and body, God and the world. Since the time of Descartes the problem of the interrelationship of 20 Vireswarananda, Brahma-Sitras, p. 4. 21 Mundaka Upanisad VII.</page><page sequence="10">12 HARIDAS CHAUDHURI these dualities has been one of the greatest philosophical problems. Our con- crete experience bears testimony to the constant interaction between mind and body, etc., but the dualistic assumption prevents a rational comprehension thereof. Some contemporary philosophers have tried to solve the problem by re- jecting the primacy of the cogito. They have tried to reduce the thinking spirit to the status of a mere function of the objective world. The cogito has been replaced by the primacy of sense-data or sensibilia in different forms of realism, neutralism, panobjectivism, etc. But that, again, seems to be an over- simplification, if not an evasion, of the basic philosophical problem. The sense-datum, or the objective phenomenon, is essentially relative to con- sciousness. Every attempt to deduce consciousness from objectivity unavoida- bly involves the mistake of putting the cart before the horse. The greatness of Descartes lies in his brilliant attempt to provide philosophy with a firm and unshakable foundation, to secure an incontestable point of departure. He discovers this foundation and starting point in his cogito ergo sum. He reminds us in this respect of the dictum of the ancient sages of both India and Greece: Know thyself. The absolute certitude of self-consciousness, the indubitable existence of the self, can alone function as the basis of all philo- sophical reflection and existential insights. Man cannot jump over his own shoulders. He can advance in his search for truth only by holding the light of the self ([itman) in his hands. A DEEPER ANALYSIS OF THE COGITO The fault of Descartes does not lie in his affirmation of the cogito as the first step in philosophic inquiry. It lies in his imperfect analysis of the cogito, his inadequate comprehension of its vast significance. Modern existentialist philosophers have shown profound ontological insight in their re-interpreta- tion of the cogito. First, the cogito which can reveal the light of truth must not be under- stood as abstract intellectual thinking. It is an act of the total personality. It has to be existential thinking, that is to say, the thinking of one who lives in the categories of his thought and who thinks out the facts of his concrete ex- perience in the quest of truth. The trend of detached, objective, and abstract thinking initiated by Descartes and completed by Hegel can hardly penetrate to the heart of existence. So, Kierkegaard stresses the need for existential thinking,22" the total thinking of the total self bent upon encountering the 22 Perry D. Le Fevre, ed., The Prayers of Kierkegaard (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1956), pp. 188-189.</page><page sequence="11">EXISTENTIALISM AND VEDANTA 13 total truth. Analyzing the existential cogito of the total personality, Kierke- gaard discovers that a genuine relationship to the Transcendent is a con- stitutive factor in the very structure of the thinking individual. The individual can discover his true unique self only by virtue of this relationship. The Cartesian dualism of God and the human individual conceived as a separate spiritual substance is thus overcome. But it is overcome only partially. Kierke- gaard could not quite satisfactorily overcome the dualism which he inherited from Christian theology. The latter postulates a radical opposition between the finite, sinful man and the infinite, divine perfection, between eternity and time. So, the manifestation of the eternal in time, as in Jesus Christ, is for Kierkegaard an obvious fact, but a supreme paradox, an irrational absurdity. It can be accepted only by an irrational act of faith. Similarly, it is only through the medium of prayer and self-surrender to the Transcendent that man can exist. But such a relationship to transcendence is, again, an element of absurdity, an affirmation of irrational faith, in the structure of human per- sonality. A more fundamental questioning of the basic consciousness of man leads both Karl Jaspers and Martin Heidegger, further, to overcome the dualism of the Transcendent and the individual. For Jaspers, the Transcendent is the Comprehensive, the Encompassing. It transcends both man and Nature, sub- ject and object, and yet, at the same time, it encompasses and comprehends them both.23 So, the individual is inseparably united with the Comprehensive. He derives his true freedom and his sense of values from his direct relation- ship to pure Transcendence. According to Heidegger, the ontological structure of man may be defined in terms of his ecstatic and self-transcending relationship to the truth of Being. Man is essentially a "shepherd of Being.'"24 He exists insofar as he "stands out" in the overtness of Being and unveils the light of the truth of Being. His cogito reveals his "the belonging-together of man and Being"2" in a common concern. Heidegger expresses here a profound truth regarding the ontological significance of the individual. His view bears close resemblance to the teaching of Krsna in the Bhagavad Gitil, that the individual self should freely co-operate with the supreme Being for the good and progress of man- kind.2 The idea of "the belonging-together of man and Being" in a common 23 Karl Jaspers, Way to Wisdom, pp. 30-34. 24 Heidegger, Existence and Being, pp. 154-156. 25 Heidegger, Essays in ,Metaphysics, Kurt F.

(New York: Philosophical Library, 1960), pp. 22-24. 26 Bhagarad Gita VII.8.</page><page sequence="12">14 HARIDAS CHAUDHURI concern has been presented in the Gita in a very dramatic form. Arjuna, the human hero, represents the higher aspiration of mankind. Faced with a crucial decision, he turns to Krsna for guidance. Krsna, the divine teacher, is an embodiment of the call of Being in a historical situation. He reveals to Arjuna the truth and cosmic purpose of Being. He then urges Arjuna to fulfill his historic mission, namely, the establishment of the kingdom of truth and justice in human society by subduing the forces of darkness and evil.27 EXISTENCE AS MULTIPLE RELATIONSHIP The cogito of Descartes has also been re-interpreted in other respects. Descartes understood it as the isolated thinking substance of the I. Starting from such an abstract self-consciousness, he found that the problems of the reality of the external world, the existence of other selves, the interaction between matter and mind, etc., had assumed formidable proportions. But existentialism rightly points out that the true starting point in philosophy is provided, not by the abstract and isolated consciousness of the epistemological subject, but by the concrete experience, the total consciousness, of the total man. As the existentialist analyzes his concrete experience, he finds that he exists in the midst of the world; he is thrown into the uinverse; he is sur- rounded and sustained by a multitude of things organized around him through his consciousness. This being-in-the-world,28 or being-thrown-into- the-universe, is an essential factor in the structure of his existence. It is a primordial datum of his consciousness. Similarly, being-with-other-selves is another primordial datum of his consciousness, another essential factor in the Dasein of man. A careful analysis of the cogito reveals that it is not in the nature of a self-enclosed subject but an intersubjectivity. Sartre has elab- orately dwelt upon the point that awareness of the Other29 is an essential condition, not only of a man's knowledge about himself, but also of his very existence. I am aware of the other self, not only as an object, but also as a subject, as a freedom placed in front of me, as a "look" staring me in the face. It is this immediate awareness of the Other as a "look" which primarily turns my attention to myself and enables me to acquire some knowledge about myself. The consciousness of the Other as a free agent and critic pro- duces in me the feelings of shame and guilt, which are characteristically 27 Ibid., IV.7 and 8.

Thus the false dualisms of I and Thou, and of I and the world, are replaced in existentialism by the non-dualistic affirmation of man's being-in- the-world and being-with-other-selves. MULTI-DIMENSIONAL EXPERIENCE IN THE VED.ANTA Turning to the Vedanta, we find that the basis of philosophic reflection should be sought, not in any one-sided or abstract mode of consciousness, but in the fullness of human experience in its multi-dimensionality. It is only by a careful analysis of such different dimensions of experience as waking (jagrat), dream (swapna), profound sleep (susupti), and transcendental awareness (turiya or samadhi) that we can obtain a fairly comprehensive understanding of the meaning of life and of the nature of existence."3 Waking consciousness reveals the reality of the visible and tangible world comprising material objects and other finite selves. I live in the world as one among many, closely interdependent with other selves and interrelated with various things. The objective world is the sensuously accessible manifestation of Being. It is called the vir,?t, i.e., the vast sensuous total. As an embodied being, I am part and parcel of this sensuous total. But an analysis of dream reveals another aspect or level of my existence. It reveals my subtle being (sz~ksma deha), which is endowed with the power of free imaginative crea- tion and with irrepressible urges and drives. This, my subtle being or un- conscious psyche, is also not an isolated entity. It is the individualized crystalli- zation of the cosmic unconscious, which has a profound wisdom of its own (prajia). The cosmic unconscious is another form of manifestation of Being on the subtle and invisible plane. Analysis of dreamless sleep reveals the reality of the unobjective witness- consciousness. After an hour's deep sleep, I say, "I had a very peaceful sleep and enjoyed it very much. I knew nothing of what happened around me." It is possible for me to say this because I had some sort of awareness even in my profoundest sleep. This awareness is essentially different, of course, from the objective consciousness of the mind which is awake and which dreams. But, nonetheless, it is a kind of objectless consciousness capable of apprehending nothingness as the absence of all mental agitation and the peace that ac- companies such nothingness. Thus, sleep reveals my mode of existence as the unobjective witness-consciousness, which remains awake even when the mind is at rest.

TRANSCENDENTAL CONSCIOUSNESS: HUSSERL, SARTRE, AND THE VED.NTA Now, waking, dream, and dreamless sleep do not exhaust the possibilities of human experience. Transcending them and yet embracing them all is what is called turlya, i.e., transcendental consciousness. Testimony has been borne to this consciousness by mystics and sages the world over. It has been the source of the profoundest spiritual intuitions of mankind. It has ben enshrined in the great scriptures of the world such as the Upanisads, Giti, Dham- mapada, Bible, Koran, etc. According to the Veddnta, the transcendental consciousness transcends the dualism of subject and object, I and Thou, or I and This. It is therefore ego- less and impersonal. Husserl maintains that by putting into brackets the natural world the boundless realm of essences is discovered as relative to transcendental consciousness. The empirical ego which feels itself as part of the natural world is also an object to this transcendental consciousness. So, Husserl conceives of the transcendental consciousness as the pure Ego."3 But, for the Veddnta, even the transcendental Ego cannot be accepted as the Absolute, for the transcendental Ego is relative to the realm of transcendent essences as much as the latter is relative to it. Both are interrelated aspects of the world of relativity. Both shine through the light of a common substratum, pure impersonal consciousness (cit) beyond all distinctions and relations. In the egoless transcendental consciousness of the Vedinta, the dichotomies of subject and object, ego and non-ego-and consequently all I-sense-are dissolved.32 Sartre has rendered signal service to modern philosophy by showing that consciousness in its inmost structure is egoless.3" The ego, the I-sense, belongs to the objective side of consciousness, to thought thought and not to thought thinking. When I am angry, my mind is merely a wave of anger. It is riveted upon the object of my anger. A strictly phenomenological analysis of my anger reveals that while I am angry there is no I-sense present.

The "I" always refers to a mental state of mind or to my body which is objectively contem- plated as engaged in the world and concerned with some objective affair. Since the "I" implies my relationship to the objective world, it is revealed as an objective content of consciousness. Pure consciousness is egoless or void of any I-sense. But, whereas, according to the Vedanta, consciousness in its inmost struc- ture is of the essence of Being, Sartre affirms consciousness as a Nothingness,34 which is also a revelation of Being. In the Vedinta, consciousness shines out in its complete purity and grandeur on the attainment of sam&amp;dhi, the funda- mental ontological dimension (turiya) of human experience. It may be called being-consciousness (sat-cit), which is realized as the sustaining background of all other phases of experience, such as waking, dreaming, and dreamless sleep. Being-consciousness is not the monopoly of a privileged few. Every human individual possesses it as the profoundest spiritual potentiality of his existence. He wakes up on the level of being-consciousness on the attainment of the complete integration of personality. It happens when the apparent darkness of the unconscious mind is removed and the bonds of egoism and emotional attachment are cut asunder. According to the Vedinta, the light of being-consciousness reveals human reality as being-with-others-in-That. The integrated individual realizes his essential identity with That (Being), his essential togetherness with others, and the rootedness of all in the unity of That.85 Such existential relations as I-That, I-thou, and thou-That are interrelated in the unity of the formula I-and-Thou-in-That, which reflects the structure of existence as a multiple relationship. Being is the transcendent and comprehensive unity of this rela- tionship. Human existence is an effort to manifest Being through conscious realization of this relationship. 34 Sartre, Being and Nothingness, p. 78. See also translator's Introduction, p. xxi. 85 Man's essential identity with Being is expressed in such statements as "I am Brahman," and "That art Thou." See Brhaddranyaka Upanisad I.iv.10, and Chandogya Upanisad VI.viii.7. A man's togetherness with others and the rootedness of all in the Supreme are most clearly stated in Bhagavad Gita VI.29 and 30.</page></plain_text>
