This question has not only been asked at various times but has also been answered in the affirmative by several scholars captivated by this, the most powerful of all Old Norse poems. Most recently the idea has been?understandably?adopted by feminists.1 It may seem superfluous to add to the vast scholarship on Vglusp?, but in this generation a more important, although related, issue demands attention. This is the perception of females in the poem, and it may throw light on the elusive question of the poet's gender. Couched in the words of a vglva or prophetess (pi. vglur), the poem traces in swift strokes the history of mythological and human figures since creation, and predicts in powerful images the destruction of the known universe and the arrival of a new world.2 Chronologically the poet distinguishes between the mythical Past, consisting of the crea tion of all things and creatures (str. 1 ? 20), the mythical Present, * A shorter version was presented at the Seventh International Saga Conference in Spoleto, Italy, September, 1988.

Focusing on the female element, we shall first probe the audience for this great drama and then examine the actors and the events in which they are involved. AUDIENCE Although the sibyl's prophecy is prompted by OSin's question (str. 28), she initially addresses herself to a larger audience. Asking for silence, she calls the assembled multitude [helgar] kindir and m?go Heimdalar,3 and either of these terms is then further defined by the expression meiri ok minni. Scholarly discussion has dealt with whether this group consists of gods or humans.4 Our question is whether women are in cluded, either as goddesses or as humans. While the poet clearly is aware of social distinctions, differentiations by gender are harder to determine. Theoretically both males and females can be included in the feminine word kind 'offspring' but mggr normally denotes male only. In that sense the word is used by our poet to indicate the advanc ing army of giants (str. 51). Although the parallelism between the two expressions in the first stanza might suggest that mggo here include both sexes, the association with Heimdallr?understandable only from the poem Rigspula?stresses the male connotation.

The audience's composition can be further illuminated from that part of the poem dedicated to the creation of dwarves. According to stanza 14, liona kindom should be informed of a certain dwarf lineage. Likewise, stanza 16 states that another dwarf lineage will be remem bered medan gld lifir.5 While it seems clear that the poet has humans in mind in both cases, the specificity of gender is less obvious. The first expression is more clearly focused on the audience than the second, which also involves the actors in the drama. Since the latter expression implies human reproduction, it is obvious that women must be in cluded in the term gld. Women may be included among the liona kindom, although in the Old Norse tradition girls never were consid ered as seriously as boys. Returning to the first stanza, we notice that the setting is similar to that of the performance of a human vglva, or reminiscent of either a Norwegian court with the skald asking for silence or the meeting of a ping with the law speaker ready to cite the law. Only women per formed as vglur, but in the two other cases the actor was male. Con cerning the audience, a human vglva had a narrow inner circle with out whose assistance she could not perform, and a larger audience for whom the performance was staged. Women clearly belonged in the first group.6 The true audience, however, was the larger group, and judged by the general terms used?menu, alpyda?it is possible that both men and women were present at the s?ance and used the vglva's skill to find out about their future, although only men are mentioned specifically.7 The audience for the ping or court setting would have primarily consisted of men, and the female presence would at best have been minimal and passive.8 We must conclude that the setting 5 Steinsland, p. 84. 6 In Eir?ks saga rauda ?orgbjprg l?til-vplva specifically asks for women who knew the lore necessary for the performance (ed. Einar Ol.

[Islendingasagna?tg?fan (n.p.: n.p., 1954], 11, 2.205. In some texts this group is called raddlid. 7 In Eir?ks saga the vglva predicts the future for Gu?ri?r as a special favor to thank her for her singing. 8 Seven female skalds are known, but they seem almost to be anomalies and they did not perform in the self-conscious way of the male skald.

GIANTS If the audience remains vague, the sex of the actors is clearer. The vglva relates that O?inn has given her the task of telling what she best remembers of forn spigllfira (str. 1). The word firar is normally taken to mean beings in human form, including giants, gods, dwarves, and humans, the usual division of anthropomorphic creatures in Old Norse mythology.9 We shall examine the female elements in these four groups through the ages. In order to convince O?inn of the truthfulness of her prophecy, the sibyl begins by telling about events in distant times, reaching beyond even O?in's own experience. Although she is not of giant stock her self, her first memories concern the giants among whom she was raised (str. 2). This information enables us to explore the earliest perceptions of reproduction. Although it seems reasonable to assume that the sibyl during her youth must have encountered parenting and fostering giants of both sexes, Vglusp? (str. 3) and other Eddic poems indicate that at the beginning of time the first male giant reproduced without female assistance. In Vafpr?Onism?l (str. 33) Ymir's (or Aurgelmir's) one leg begot a six-headed son with the other and a male and a female child grew under his arm. The first metaphor clearly suggests an ex clusively male procreative role and even the underarm hardly implies female participation. It is obvious that the original reproductive model among the giants was not hermaphroditism, which would allow the female principle under male control, but male parthenogenesis. Although female reproduction is absent among the first giants, fe male nurture is present, not in human form but represented by the cow Au?umla (mentioned only by Snorri, 13 : 19). Feeding Ymir from her teats, at the same time she licked the salty blocks from which emerged, fully formed, a strong man named Bur. He gat, or engen dered, the son Bor (14:3), and the normal heterosexual reproduction suggested by this expression is made clear in the next generation when Bor marries Bestia, the daughter of the giant Bol[x&gt;rn. To gether they had three sons, ?oinn, Vili, and V?. In other words, nor mal procreation involving females seems to have been introduced by The poem has a fleeting reference to elves in stanza 48.</page><page sequence="5">348 Jochens the enigmatic Bur from whom it passed to giants and gods. By the time the v?lva arrived in Giantland, therefore, giantesses had taken on the normal female reproductive role. It is even suggested in some sources that they reproduced in huge numbers into old age.10 The most startling information about female giants in the Past is found in stanza 8, where it is affirmed that the Golden Age of the gods lasted "unz J^ri?r kv?mo / J3ursa meyiar /. . . / ?r iotunheimom." These women are often assumed to be identical with the norns men tioned in stanza 20. The description ?m?tkar migk does not fit the nor mal image of the norns as stern but impartial powers. Nor is there evidence that the norns come out of Giantland. It is therefore better, with Nordal (pp. 36?37), to associate these women with the establish ment of difficult exogamous marriage alliances between the gods and the giants reported by other sources. In order to obtain the giantess Ger?r, Freyr had to give up his sword. Moreover, the marriage be tween Ska?i and Nipr?r did not work out. Although these named giantesses eventually became absorbed into the family of the gods, the v?lva clearly blamed the cessation of the Golden Age on the three unnamed giant women. The Present contains only a single fleeting glimpse of giants when the gods discuss their dangerous promise of giving OS's wife (Freyia) to tt i?tuns (str. 25). Since marriage with Freyia was the object (Snorri, 45:17), this issue is of special interest to male giants, but the ex pression implies generations and again suggests a gendered society of giants. Because the sibyl enjoys a special ability to predict the cataclysmic events of the Future, she conjures up vivid images of the final struggle between the gods and the giants. As might be expected in any war, all the actors, individually and in groups, are male, several designated by name or lineage (str. 46, 50, 51, 52). Their success is so terrifying that they, their divine adversaries, and indeed the whole universe disinte grate into a huge conflagration. The female giants, however, are not forgotten. One designated as in aldna (str. 40) gives birth to monsters, of whom one, in the shape of a wolf, will swallow the sun. Perhaps the same giantess is mentioned in stanza 42 as a gygr, or troll, in connec 10 Some scholars prefer Snorri's version of this stanza, eliminating reference to the giant Ymir (see Nordal, p. 27). The giant is also mentioned in Vafpr?Onism?l (str. 21) and his role further elaborated by Snorri, pp. 12-14. The fear of the giants' numerical superiority is expressed in H?rbarOsli?d (str. 23). On this issue, see M. Ciklamini, "The Chronological Conception in Norse Mythology," Neophilologus, 47 (1963), 138?51, esp. p. 141.</page><page sequence="6">Vglusp?: Matrix of Norse Womanhood 349 tion with her shepherd. As victims of the war the giantesses also fall in the end when the mountains tumble around them ("gr?tbjprg gnata, en g?fr rata" [str. 52]).u GODS Of giant lineage, the gods are the second group to emerge from the primeval chaos. The Vglusp? poet is silent on how the gods are cre ated, but that the first ones are male is clear from the expression Burs synir (str. 4). Snorri knew their names as O?inn, Vili, and V? (14:5). Apparently more gods appear during the Past, since in stanza 18 an other male triad is mentioned, consisting of O?inn, H nir (present again in str. 63), and Lo?urr. During the Present and Future other male gods are mentioned by name, I&gt;orr (str. 26, 56), Heimdallr (str. 27, 46), Baldr (str. 31, 62), Hp?r (str. 32, 62), Loki (str. 35), and Vi?arr (str. 55), and there are several circumlocutions for O?inn and I&gt;?rr. Although goddesses have not specifically been mentioned as yet, the poet often uses collective terms to designate the deities. A closer look at these terms as well as at the gods' activities may help us to determine whether, in the poet's mind, females are included in these groups. The Vglusp? poet uses the words regin (str. 6, 9, 23, 25), cesir (str. 7, 17, 23, 48, 60), and god (str. 9, 23). In addition, other collective words for gods, such as bgnd, hgpt, and tivar are found in the poetry.12 Most of these cannot be used in the singular and are not gender spe cific, but designate impersonal powers in charge of the universe. It might be argued that given sufficiently ancient roots?as is the case with regin?such words could have at some point reflected mother goddesses, or at least the transition from this stage to patriarchy, as suming that the Germanic peoples underwent developments similar 1 ' Bj?rn M. Olsen has suggested that g?fr is here used about giants or trolls in general (p. 155), but Nordal (p. 104) maintains the usual limitation to females. This fits the image of giant women remaining in their dwellings during the struggle and forced out only when the mountains collapsed. 12See Maurice Cahen, Le mot "dieu" en Vieux-Scandinave (Paris: Champion, 1921); A. M. Sturtevant, "A Study of the Old Norse Word regin" JEGP, 15 (1916), 251-66; A. M.

The original meaning of the Indo-European root of regin referring to "greatness," "power," or "authority" is conceivable in such a setting. While this meaning may also have been original among the Goths, Wulfilas restricted the word to "council" and "deliberation" in his Bible translation.13 In the Ger manic context, where patriarchy was strong, it seems reasonable to assume that such concepts took on male shapes, when they became personified at the divine level and were reified among humans. The emergence of the rarely used word ?synja 'goddess', the feminine form of ?ss 'god', would suggest as much.14 The deeds and actions of the deities will further help us to deter mine whether goddesses are included in the collective terms. The set ting for many of the divine activities is described in the following terms: "M gengo regin pll / ? r0kst?la / ginnheilog go?," a refrain used both during the Past (str. 6, 9) and the Present (str. 23, 25). This exalted place must have been reminiscent of a meeting of the ping. In fact, in stanza 48 where the sir have a final meeting to decide on action against the incoming army of giants, the ping setting is specifi cally mentioned. In this location we see the gods giving names to things and concepts (str. 6)?like Adam in the Christian tradition? deciding on who is to create the dwarves (str. 9), taking counsel in a particularly difficult situation (str. 23), and discussing who is behind the irresponsible promise to give Freyia to the giants (str. 25). Since all these activities are political in nature, it is hard to imagine that they would not?as in human society?be solely the prerogative of males. Two other poems use a slightly different formula in similar situa tions: "Senn v?ro aesir / allir ? [ringi / ok ?synior / aliar ? m?li / ok um J)at r??o / r?kir t?var, . . ." (Prymskvi?a, str. 14; Baldrs draumar, str. 1). Here the setting of the ping is clear, and the goddesses are designated by the special female term ?synja, suggesting that they are not in cluded among the sir and the t?var who sit in judgment and make decisions. Like Icelandic women at meetings of the earthly ping, how ever, they are present for social reasons and seem to have been in cluded for consultation. That the gods were under exclusive male leadership is also understood by the author of Gautreks saga (ch. 7). At 13Sturtevant, pp. 251-52. 14 In Lokasenna, str. 53, the goddess Sif includes herself among the cesir, indicating that the word was not used consistently, and that goddesses could be subsumed under the male term. The philological literature rarely deals with the problem of gender. Kuhn noticed (p. 145) that god in the older poetry is used about female divinities such as the sun and the goddess Ska?i.</page><page sequence="8">Vglusp?: Matrix of Norse Womanhood 351 a meeting of the twelve male gods summoned to decide on the fate of the hero Starka?r, O?inn took the last empty seat. At best the god desses could only have been present among the assembled fjolmenni.15 Outside their seats of authority the gods engage in other important activities. Having decided on the creation of the dwarves, three male gods (O?inn, Hcenir, and Lo?urr) give life to two humans whom they find on the ground as inanimate bodies (str. 17, 18).16 They also erect shrines and temples and build forges on which they fashion adorn ments and tools (str. 7). When all is done, they amuse themselves by playing a board game, until, as we saw, the peace is broken by the arrival of the three giant maidens (str. 8). The conclusion is hard to escape that these creative and recreative activities are entirely within the male domain. Male gods are specifi cally named in the creation of humans. Moreover, building and metalworking have been male occupations in all societies, undoubt edly for reasons related to men's greater physical strength. In the Old Norse context the association between metalworking and males is par ticularly close, because dwarves, who are exclusively males (aside from this passage), have the monopoly on metalworking as the artisans of the cosmos. Also suggesting male pleasure, the board game became part of male education after its adoption from the south. With a single exception (Gunnlaugs saga, IF, 3:4.60), all participants in similar games in the sagas are men.17 If male gods are the actors and agents in the Past, can it neverthe less be assumed that goddesses are present, as suggested by the term ?synior in other poems? We find the words hgrg ok hof (str. 7) included in the building activities. Distinguishing between them, Snorri uses the latter in connection with gods (20:8) and the former with god desses (20: 11). If Snorri's interpretation is correct, the Vglusp? author is implying the silent presence of goddesses in the mythical Past, since it was necessary to build a special domicile for them. When hgrgr is occasionally connected with the male god Njor?r, it can be explained by the fact that he was most likely identified with the older female Nerthus known from Tacitus, for whom it would have been correct to use the term. As shown by Turville-Petre, however, hgrgr can have l5FSN, iv, 7.29. 16 See Steinsland's perceptive analysis of this part of the poem. Based on the femi nine pri?r in both principal manuscripts, some scholars see in stanza 17 the activities of three goddesses. If such a thesis is accepted, it becomes necessary to eliminate stanza 18, which specifies the role of the three male gods. Most scholars, however, agree to change pri?r to the masculine prir; see r?sum? of discussion in Steinsland, p. 94. 17 A. G. van Hamel, "The Game of the Gods," ANF, 50 (1934), 218?42.</page><page sequence="9">352 Joe hens designated structures intended for goddesses only toward the end of the pagan period when the texts were composed, since older place names in Sweden make it clear that the term was also associated with male gods.18 In other words, it is not possible to reach any firm conclu sion about the existence of goddesses during the mythical Past. As sumptions about their presence must be adduced from silence. We are aware, of course, that the Nordic pantheon includes god desses. In the sections devoted to the Present and the Future the author of V?lusp? mentions several female deities by name or circum locution. Included among the clearly identifiable goddesses tradi tionally incorporated into the sir family are Freyia (Ods mey [str. 25]), Frigg (str. 33, 56 [here called Hlin]), and Sigyn (str. 35). Among these, Freyia originally belonged to the rival group of gods, the vanir. Her arrival among the sir is presumably described in the two stanzas dealing with Gullveig and Hei?r (str. 21, 22), probably other names for Freyia.19 The poet also describes Hei?r as angan illrar br?dar (str. 22). While the cosmological position of this figure is open for discus sion, there is no question of her gender, and the expression is un doubtedly to be understood as a collective term for women. Although the goddesses do not participate in the many collective activities undertaken by the gods, the V?lusp? poet does ascribe cer tain actions to goddesses. As to Frigg, O?in's wife who, according to Snorri, had been with him from the beginning, the poet remembers her tears over the loss of her son Baldr (str. 33) and her grief at O?in's death (str. 53). A similar conjugal role is attributed to Sigyn as she sits, "J^eygi . . . velglyio?" (str. 35) over her bound husband Loki. These three passages, testifying to an awareness of female sorrow, prompted Bj?rn M. Olsen to suggest female authorship of the poem.20 It is safer to interpret these passages as the first evidence of the new emotions that gained entry into the Edda corpus and reached maturity in the Gu?run songs. It is worth noticing, however, that the V?lusp? poet ignores Frigg's imaginative plan to protect Baldr and her forceful attempt to rescue him from Hel, as well as Sigyn's constant interference to assuage her husband's pain. Excluded are also Freyia's vociferous objections to the 18E. O. G. Turville-Petre, Myth and Religion of the North (London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1964), p. 240. Hgrgr is used about Njpr?r in Vafpr?dnism?l, str. 38. 19 These stanzas have received an enormous amount of attention from scholars. See bibliography in Harris, pp. 154-56. I am here following the interpretation of Turville Petre, pp. 158-59, 175-79. 20 See Olsen, passim. As an alternative he suggested that the author, "med fin be regning," let the v?lva express herself in this way because of her gender.</page><page sequence="10">Vglusp?: Matrix of Norse Womanhood 353 gods' plan of giving her to the giants in return for the building of a stronghold (str. 25). These features, ascribed to the three women from other sources, suggest more energy and initiative than our poet credits to them. While the known goddesses are thus depicted as passive or at most showing feelings for kin and family, the situation is different for the enigmatic female person(s) known as Gullveig and Hei?r (str. 21, 22). We recall that giant women bring an end to the gods' first happiness, which implies that these women are evil. This impression is rein forced by the description of them as ?m?tkar, a term normally used for witches. In the divine world, we now see evil associated with Gullveig and Hei?r. It is unimportant in this connection whether we assume that both names indicate Freyia, perhaps at the moment of her entry into the world of the sir from her native family of the vanir. The essential feature for our inquiry is that the two new names stand for female beings who are associated with evil. Hei?r may simply mean "witch." Gullveig, the personification of gold in female shape, brings into the world the first war. Appearing among the gods, she is burned three times, "?&gt;o hon enn lifir" (str. 21). As Hei?r she offers magic to the gods, and her art is appreciated by "wicked women."21 Whether these women are goddesses or humans is not clear, but the association between females and evil is unambiguous.22 In other words, when fe male figures stray beyond displaying emotions for their male kin, the author of Vglusp? suspects their actions as evil. Not only do anthropomorphic beings perish in the final destruc tion, but the whole universe is destroyed. Yet for the second time the sibyl sees the earth emerge. In beautiful and poetic images the poet 21 This stanza, especially line 4: "vitti h?n ganda," has elicited widely varying transla tions of which the most interesting from th? viewpoint of this article is "to influence the penis through magic" (see Hugo Pipping, "Eddastudier II," Studier i Nordisk Filologi, 17 [1926], 1-138, esp. p. 71). Male fear of impotence would thus be blamed on female magic. Rolf Pipping has taken this interpretation one step further and wants to inter pret "afr?O gialda" in stanza 23 as "unlawful sexual relations" (see Rolf Pipping, "Om Gullveig-stroferne i Vplusp?," in Festskrift til Finnur J?nsson [Copenhagen: Levin og Munksgaard, 1928], pp. 225-28).

Several of the old gods return, talking about former times. They find in the grass the golden game boards on which they had played in the first age (str. 47, 48). That the new world is better than the old is indicated by Baldr and Hp?r ap pearing together, victim and killer in their former incarnations. Neither giants nor dwarves are mentioned in this new world. Since both male and female giants are considered evil, there is, of course, no room for them in this better world. It is difficult to say whether the dwarves are left out intentionally. More puzzling, however, is the ab sence of the goddesses. Perhaps the poet meant them to be subsumed under the term sir in stanza 60, or perhaps the brevity of this part of the poem (seven stanzas with one additional stanza in the Hauksb?k version) did not allow their inclusion. Nonetheless it is difficult to avoid the impression that the poet considered goddesses too unim portant to mention. One might even argue that having identified fe maleness with evil, he expressly excluded goddesses, on the ground that the new world would be better without them. DWARVES Little remains to be said about the last groups, dwarves and humans. As mentioned, the universe of the dwarves is entirely male, as indi cated by their names.23 Created at the beginning of time in full num bers, they do not reproduce. In spite of their maleness they are pas sive in the final struggle, and only groan when earthquakes prevent their return to their mountain dwellings (str. 48). Their reproductive and sexual interests appear only in later sources.24 HUMANS In contrast to the dwarves, humans were created with specific genders in the Past. As we saw, three male gods endow two inanimate bodies named Askr and Embla with life (str. 17). The recognition of them as 23 Lotte Motz, "New Thoughts on Dwarf-Names in Old-Icelandic," Fr?hmittelalterliche Studien, 7 (1973), 100?117. 24 In the post-classical poem Alv?ssm?l a dwarf marriage is presented as a possibility, and the late prose account Sgrla p?ttr endows dwarves with sexual appetite. Numerous dwarf children appear in some of the fornaldarsggur, but the authors have given no thought to the dwarf women one would assume necessary.</page><page sequence="12">V?lusp?: Matrix of Norse Womanhood 355 the first human couple is undoubtedly helped by the fact that their names begin with the same letters as Adam and Eve. While Askr is normally associated with the ash tree, there is no agreement over the meaning of Embla.25 The gender differentiation is apparently not yet sharp, since the term (firl?gslausa is used about them in the masculine plural inflection, although the neuter would have been expected for two beings of different sex. In the following stanza (str. 18), where the neuter pronoun pau is used, gender equality is stressed when they receive the same four gifts from the gods (?nd, o?r, l?, and litr). Nothing is related about humans in the Present. That they are affected by?or perhaps even share responsibility for?the final dis aster is clear from stanzas 39 and 45, where crimes of perjury, mur der, and adultery are reported to occur both outside (str. 39) and within (str. 45) human families. These transgressions, however, are committed by men, even those involving sexuality. Masculine plural forms are used throughout. In the passage describing adultery (str. 39), the subject is masculine and the object a term for wife or female friend (eyrar?na). The whole passage runs as follows: "ok |)annz an nars glepr / eyraruno." This bias, however, does not allow one to con clude superior moral standing for women, nor does it suggest female passivity. Like the Ten Commandments, it indicates a culture inten sely focused on males and their activities. Scholars have used the sexual transgression in these two stanzas to evaluate Christian versus pagan elements in the poem. Crucial to the discussion are three terms: eyrar?na (str. 39), sifiom spilla, and h?rd?mr (str. 45). If the poem reflects Christian marriage policy, the first means "wife," the second "commit incest," and the third "lack of sex ual morality." Outside our poem eyrar?na is found only in H?v?m?l (str. 115), where the meaning clearly is "mistress." In the stanza in V?lusp? this would define sexual transgression as involving a man and a woman who is not the wife but the mistress of another man. Sug gesting casualness in both unions in which this eyrar?na would be in volved, it implies sexual unions between women and men that hardly deserve the term marriage. If the meaning of "wife" is accepted, it still denotes a far less stable notion of marriage than that advocated by churchmen. It is generally agreed that the second term, sifiom spilla, does not refer to incest as defined by churchmen and found in the law codes, but to the breaking of kinship ties (Nordal, p. 44). This is also the way Snorri understood the passage (70:13). Since V?lusp? may 25 See discussion in Steinsland, p. 91.</page><page sequence="13">35^ Jochens preserve the oldest known use of h?rd?mr, it is difficult to determine the origin of the word.26 It is most likely of Christian origin, and in accordance with Christian principles of reciprocity in the marital union the partners also shared responsibility for adultery. This notion is conveyed in Old Norse by the existence of the gender specific terms h?rkarl and h?rkona, in addition to the general h?rd?msmadr. Although our poet chose h?rd?mr over the usual term legor?, found in the Ice landic law and used only in connection with male perpetrators, he is not implying any sharing by the partners of the responsibility for sex ual transgressions, since h?rd?mr in our stanza is surrounded by words with strong male connotations. In other poetic texts it is also con nected with men.27 The sexual behavior glimpsed from these passages is clearly more pagan than Christian. Women are not identified with sexuality, and they are seen in passive roles as objects of men's desires. When the earth reappears, humanity also returns. Covering the same events, the poem Vafpr?dnism?l indicates that a human couple named Lif and LifJ)rasir survive the catastrophe and repeople the earth (str. 44, 45), a detail adopted by Snorri (41 :*j6). The Vglusp? poet, on the other hand, describes the new generation of humanity in enigmatic terms: "burir byggja / brce?ra tveggja" (str. 63). These lines are not clear as to who these brothers are.28 For our purposes it is only important to notice that the earth could be repopulated by a pair of males without the mention of women. The poet, of course, was aware of women's functions in his own society, but the poem's view is nonetheless strikingly male. Envisaging Giml?, a marvelous gold-covered hall, as the domicile of the new hu manity, the prophetess decribes the inhabitants as "dyggvar / dr?ttir" (str. 64). While we may be permitted to interpret this as meaning "good people" or "blameless crowds" with Nordal (p. 112) or as "worthy people" with Paul Schach (p. 108), the traditional meaning of dr?tt is "warrior host." In paraphrasing this stanza Snorri renders it as "g?Oir menn ok r?ttl?tir" (26: 2), probably in opposition to the (male) 26Rudolf Meissner, "Zum Wortschatz der Vplusp?," ZDP, 43 (1911), 449-50.

In other words, only through half-closed eyes and by a generous extension of the meaning of the word dr?tt is it possible to glimpse women among the happy crowds in Giml?.29 SUPERIOR FEMALE BEINGS So far, the poet has neglected females, relegated them to the periph ery of the action, or attributed evil actions to them. Beyond his strati fied cosmos, however, we can catch sight of certain figures, ancient, powerful, and perceived only as females. Most closely associated with the gods are six named valkyries (str. 30). In other sources they are given the task of choosing who is to die on the battlefield and of bring ing these men to O?inn, thus forming an important link between the divine and the human worlds. Introduced in V?lusp? as a prelude to the Future, their arrival signals the beginning of the final struggle. Their association with O?inn is clear from the expression n?nnor Herians. While the valkyries owe allegiance to the chief god, the norns, an other group of female beings, are totally independent and their active realm is vaster. The valkyries decide on men's luck in battle, but the norns preside over the entire fate of both humans and gods. Accord ing to stanza 20, they are "margs vitandi" and "J)aer lpg lpg?o, / [}aer lif kuro / aida bprnom, / 0rlpg seggia." Their names, Ur?, Ver?andi, and Skuld, are often seen as reflecting the three chronological stages of the Past, the Present, and the Future. Since the word Skuld carries a stronger connotation of obligation than of choice, the three norns seem to symbolize events that have taken place, that are in the process of happening, and that of necessity must occur.30 Even the gods' ac tions are ranged under the authority of these female powers, al though they are not directly in control of events. Both the valkyries and the norns appear in groups. The v?lva her self, the most impressive figure in the whole poem, however, emerges alone. The phrase "ein sat h?n ?ti" (str. 28) is the technical term for 29 Adding the words "of aliar aldir" (26: 2) to his paraphrase, Snorri may have imag ined Giml? as a new Valhgll for the happy dead, a concept that also would imply only males, since the old Valhgll was reserved for warriors who had died in battle. 301 am here following the perceptive analysis of Paul C.

Face to face with the chief god she withstands his fierce look as he tries to gain from her knowledge about the future (str. 28). Just as Norse farmers had to give presents to human vglur before they would predict the future, so O?inn offers "hringa ok men" (str. 29) to this ancient and superior vglva in return for prophecy. Scholars have often, but without grounds, interpreted the relationship between the two as one in which O?inn is able to force her to speak.33 Neither is there reason to assume, with de Vries, that her questions to O?inn, "hvers fregni? mik? / hvi freisti? min?" (str. 28), betray despair on her part. O?in's epithet, yggiungr, suggests that this emotion should be ascribed rather to him. Her next statement, "alt veit ek, O?inn," including where he has hidden his eye, is indica tive of the self-assurance and superiority that is veiled in her rhetori cal questions. The poem Baldrs draumar presents a situation where O?inn, concerned about Baldr's bad dreams, travels to the under world where he summons a vglva from the dead and, against her will, makes her predict the future. While O?inn is in charge of the sibyl in the Baldr poem, the vglva in our poem emerges clearly superior to the chief god, and in both poems he is obviously ignorant about the fu ture.34 Still alive, the sibyl in Vglusp? is sought out by O?inn, and she convinces him of her authority by willingly telling him events that he could verify from his own knowledge. Thus vindicated, she spends the longest part of her soliloquy unrolling the dreadful happenings of the Future in powerful images, leaving only the promise that some 3 'The setting recalls the importance of the desert for Jewish prophets; see Maurice Blanchot, Le livre ? venir (Paris: Gallimard, 1959), pp. 98?107. 32See, for example, R.

Suggesting a new disaster, the coming of a dragon, the v?lva finally sinks away, but of her own volition. CONCLUSION The V?lusp? poet does not attribute importance to females, either in his own society or in its current mythological superstructure. While human women barely enter his field of vision, a few goddesses are remembered for their attachment to male kin, but in general both female gods and giants are associated with evil. The poet shows aware ness of an older order, however, a mythology in which female powers had been important, and a society where male leaders, when faced with difficult decisions, would have asked advice from women. A mil lenium before V?lusp? was composed, Tacitus had afforded a brief glimpse of such an era.35 We may speculate on the connections between this previous order and the age of V?lusp?. While the author of the poem knew only of valkyries and norns, groups of additional female figures, disir and fylgjur, do appear in other Old Norse sources. The disir are normally interpreted as fertility goddesses and the fylgjur are female protective spirits.36 Also antedating the Nordic pantheon, these groups of female divinities link our poem to a religious system where goddesses had been prominent, suggesting that the worship of mother goddesses had been a universal European phenomenon and not just limited to the Balkan area.37 Now more elusive than the reigning celestial hierar chy of asir and vanir, however, these female figures are given added weight in the poem by the appearance of the v?lva herself. By making knowledge of the Future available to O?inn only through the mouth of this prophetess, our poet connects his own society with the older 35 Besides the goddess Nerthus, Tacitus also reports on sibyls.

Like the ancient Germanic tribes and his contemporary Icelandic farmers seeking out human vglur, he identified wisdom and knowledge with femaleness. Not limited to the Germanic world, sibyls or prophetesses can also be found in Mediterranean cultures.38 When the study of Vglusp? be gan in earnest, scholars immediately discerned connections between the sibylline oracles in Greece and Rome and the Nordic vglva.39 De spite similarities, however, it seems likely that the union between fe maleness and wisdom appeared independently in various cultures. Looking at the problems presented to these women might suggest an answer to why certain women in patriarchal cultures came to be seen as prophetesses and identified with wisdom. In this long tradi tion the questions posed, with few exceptions, pertain to male activi ties, such as travels, wars, treaties, and politics, areas high in unpredic tability. Concerns universally attributed to women?the production of food and clothing?receive little attention, probably because they occur regularly and, as it were, automatically. Only where climatic conditions caused prolonged famine or when plague raged would everyday problems be brought to the sibyl's attention.40 In the Nordic context, extremely bad weather and famine in Greenland was the oc casion for the fullest description of the activities of a human vglva.41 Predicting the future naturally involved magic.42 It is not surprising, therefore, that childbirth, the chief female activity open to unpredic tability, is occasionally included in magical incantations. Given the strongly patriarchal tenor of all cultures in which sibyls are found, it seems unlikely that women themselves invented female prophetic abilities, and even less likely that women convinced men to accept them. Unable to choose between political alternatives or fearful of their outcome, men occasionally sought advice from "the others," that is, women. Allowed little choice, women did their best to accom modate the demands. Enough cases turned out well so that the prac tice caught on, thus giving rise to the permanent feature of the proph 38 The best recent treatment is Bernard McGinn, Visions of the End: Apocalyptic Tradi tions in the Middle Ages (New York: Columbia Univ.

On the other hand, occasional bad advice resulting in failure and disaster, or vague answers replacing the responsibility for a wrong decision on the men themselves, provided an excuse to accuse women of bad judgment, resulting in the evil stain that is often associated with wise women. There is an inner rationale to the existence of a female sibyl in societies where males dominated politics and religion but had not yet achieved kingship on earth and monotheism in heaven. Leadership, of course, must come from their own gender, but not yet attuned to obeying a single male in political or religious matters, and recalling memories of powerful goddesses in the distant past, men turned to the female half of society, imagining that a few women possessed the supreme wisdom and knowledge they wished to obtain. In the mytho logical realm such a figure could not be one of the regular goddesses, since that would demean the male gods, but she had to be found from an entirely different race. The ancient v?lva of giant stock, or, at least, giant culture, admirably fits the requirements. Although no evil is discernible in the sibyl of V?lusp?, most other references to sibyls in the Old Norse context are negative; thus in Baldrs draumar OSinn ends his dialogue with a v?lva by accusing her of being the mother of trolls (str. 13).43 By associating evil with giantesses and goddesses, however, the author of our poem obviously has associ ated females not only with wisdom but also with evil, arguably to the degree of envisaging the new world of the gods as being free of fe male divinities. At the same time, while neglecting females in the col lective efforts of the gods and recalling only the grieving of a few goddesses, he ignores the more active and positive roles played by these and other ?synjur. Human women barely enter his field of vi sion, and do so only as objects of men's actions. The identification of females with evil also recalls Christianity. In both traditions women are associated with evil, but, while Christians saw human women as responsible for bringing evil into the world, in the Nordic tradition this role is performed by supernatural female beings.44 In contrast to Christians pagan women are not charged with responsibility for sex ual transgressions. These perspectives lend little support to the hypothesis of a female author for our poem. Women may have shared its cultural outlook 43 See references to other sibyls in the article Vglva in Vol. xx o?

We are on firmer ground if we see Vglusp? as a repository of many conflicting ideas concerning women as seen by a man around the year 1000. Substantiated by later authors, these ideas were to remain un reconciled in Old Norse literature. Working with both ancient and contemporary perceptions, the poet's vision included human and di vine society. Although aware of an older order of female prominence in myth and society, he chronicles the relatively neglected position of women in his own world and its mythology and may, at the same time, have suffered from an ubiquitous male fear of women.45 He nonethe less perceives new, albeit contradictory, roles for women by allowing them deeper emotional expressions and, possibly, burdening them with responsibility for sexual transgressions. Just as Vglusp? has been rightly recognized as the font of Nordic myth and religion, so it also serves as the matrix of Norse womanhood. 45 The connection between Gullveig (known only from this poem) and evil would suggest that the author suffers from this.</page></plain_text>
