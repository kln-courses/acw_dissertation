<plain_text><page sequence="1">Abraham Schwadrort On Religion Music and Education IT IS BOTH STRANGE and unfortunate that the subject of religion and music, as applied to public education, has not at- tracted the proper research it warrants. The ecumenical movements of our age seek not only to establish better tolerance of religious ideas and beliefs, but also to expand interest in and understanding of one anoth- er's positions. Responsible music educators, concerned with both Consti- tutional legalities and musical values, are raising a variety of rather per- ceptive questions that pertain in large measure to Jewish outlooks and the Judaic-Christian heritage. What are the roots of the Jewish objec- tions in sacred music? What is the advisable role of education in the common school? What is Jewish music? What are the common gTounds and differentiations of the two faiths? What can be done to promote a better ecumenical awareness? Some important historical and theological information should be established and extended in personal relation- ships and, consequently, in educational practice. The study of comparative religions-especially of Christianity's Judaic origins-has reached a notable summit of interest. There are also many indications for a "new understanding of what Judaism has to teach.''l Coupled with the recommendations of the Tanglewood Symposium for the examination of all types of music in education, the subject of this article is most appropriate. In spite of the sensitivities and diiculties of discussion, two major areas need to be considered: (a) the liturgical and musical interdependence of Church and Synagog, and (b) the impli- cations of religious music in the public schools. The first of these obviously requires the comprehensive methodologies of the historian, the musicologist, and the theologian for a thorough scholarly treatment. The lack of extensive and detailed research is most obvious: The question of the interrelation between Church and Synagog has often been put by laymen and scholars alike.... Notwithstanding the individual efforts of some scholars during the last two or three centuries and their . . . necessarily limited studies, comparative liturgy is a rather virginal field and has not been treated comprehensively as yet. This must be stated in view of the tremendous output dealing with the strictly theoretical side of our problem, "Christians and Jews," Time (April 5, 1968), 48. 157</page><page sequence="2">158 JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN MUSIC EDUCATION especially the theology of Early Christianity and its relation to Rabbinic Judaism.2 Werner's study on the common bases of Jewish and Christian liturgies expands the earlier research of Idelsohn, especially during the first mil^ lenium. The findings of both these scholars helps to shed much light on the important relationships between both the music and liturgies of Christianity and Judaism, and thereby account for their common bases. "The first Christians were Jews, both by faith and nationality; their rit- ual was the Jewish cult, their language Hebrew and Aramaic. While ac- cepting the Jewish institutions of their time, they expanded and rein- terpreted them under the influence of their new message of salvation."3 To this day a careful examination of Church and Synagog will show a number of interesting links in liturgical texts, hierarchy, ceremonies and rituals, and organization of the ecclesiastical year, as well as both the ethics and aesthetics of music. To be sure, there are some sharp theolog- ical differences between Christianity and Judaism (and these warrant clari-fication), but the similarities are far more in number and in impor- tance to the educational purposes intended by the ecumenical movement. The musical comparatives are worthy of investigation: 1. The problems of cantillation and accentuation (both older than notation) are fundamental to any understanding of the early Judaic- Christian musical liturgy. 2. The ethos-doctrine that differentiates the modal cantillations in the Torah used for ordinary Sabbatical chant from those used on the high Holy Days is quite similar to the doctrine that differentiates the Roman lectio ordinaria and lectio solemnis. Appropriate analogies can be made with music of the Syrian and Armenian churches.4 3. Both accept a similar aesthetic and ethical attitude toward sacred music in general that parallels Plato's Kalokagathia. "Jewish and Greek conceptions of the aesthetically valuable are very much akin; as in pla- tonic philosophy the truly Good is also the truly Beautiful, so in Juda- ism, the genuinely Holy is also the Beautiful and the Good."5 4. Both have traditionally held to the preeminence of men and the ex- clusion of women in the chanting of the liturgy; and both have experi- enced numerous reforms that seek various forms of social change. 5. Both maintain roots of similarity in the wearing of priestly vest- ments, in certain traditional practices such as the head coverings, symbol- isms, hymns, prayers, blessings, amens, and hallelujahs. 6. Both share a common and broad heritage in tlle development of the modes, chants, psalms, liturgical texts, and so forth, and also tend to point up some interesting oddities. "Frequently Hebraisms in early Irish 2 Eric Werner, The Sacred Bridge (New York: Columbia University Press, 1959), p. xv. 3 Ibid., p. 17. 4 Werner, p. 103. s Ibid ., p. 314.</page><page sequence="3">159 ON RELIGION, MUSIC, AND EDUCATION monody . . . seem to have originated with Eastern, mainly Greek monks and missionaries who visited Ireland between the sixth and tenth centuries."6 Considering all these (and they merely scratch the surface of inquiry), it is sometimes difficult to understand why religious antagonisms as well as social and physical abuse have been the earmarks of religion in history to the present. No exhaustive answer can be proposed here. Yet several pertinent ideas need to be reviewed: 1. The essential doctrinal dissimilarities between Christians and Jews are stated in the Catholic Credo and the Jewish Shema.7 The significant differences center about the acceptance or rejection of the Messianic role of Jesus. Trinitarian beliefs, however, when closely examined are funda- mentally monotheistic. 2. Interpretations and reinterpretations as these became necessary in the constant process of strengthening the early Christian church caused ecclesiastical authorities to banish certain Jewish nomenclature because these might "Judaize the Church." There is sufficient reference in the Old Testament to the use of instrumental music in its "proper" setting. There is further substantiation for the primacy of vocal performance be- cause of textual considerations. Yet after almost a thousand years follow- ing the prohibition of instrumental music in Judaism, the emotions ex- pressed by the Church Fathers still displayed a naive attitude of opposi- tion. "The authorities were more or less afraid of it since it carried too many reminiscences of pagan cults or of the ritual of the Jewish Temple.... The Synagog had banished all instrumental music with^ out exception as a symbol of mourning over the destruction of the Temple; this fact shows that the alleged Christian fear 'lest the Church become Judaized' was not the real reason after all."8 3. Through the centuries the common links of Judaism and Christi- anity have lost meaning despite occasional statements such as that of Pope Paul XI-"Spiritually we are all Semites." By the time of the estab- lishment of Charlemagne's Holy Roman Empire in the eighth century, mass Tewish migzations to Spain, Italy, and the Rhineland were neces^ sary. Werner states that from the time of the First Crusade (and the pogrom in Blois), little, if any, mutual understanding remained. Numer^ ous pretexts for consequent Jewish pogroms-Black Death, Poisoning of Wells, Ritual Murder, and so forth, were often manufactured to arouse hatred, so that "life for European Jewry became a veritable century- lasting, agonizing crucifixion." Small wonder that Jewry detested and hated everything connected with the Church, so that the Book of the Pious, during the fourteenth century, expressly forbade the teaching of Synagog melodies to a Christian. Only during and after the Renaissance there prevailed especially in Italy a somewhat milder 6 Ibid., p. 572. (Some distinctive features of Jewish chant, such as improvisation and embellishment, were eliminated in the Gregorian Chant.) 7 Shema Yisrael: "Hear O Israel, the Lord our God; the Lord is One." 8Werner, p. 318.</page><page sequence="4">160 JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN MUSIC EDUCATION climate in the relations between Church and Synagog: yet even this short glimpse of light vanished before the lasting darkness of the Ghetto"9 A gifted and prolific Jewish composer who lived in Mantua during the Renaissance, Solomone Rossi composed both sacred and secular music. It is interesting to note, however, that while serving as composer, singer, and violinist at the ducal court he "was privileged to dispense (in 1606) with the yellow badge that all Jews were ordered to wear at that time.''lÂ° When one considers the sociocultural effects of the Diaspora of the Jews from the days of the Exile to today, the problem of establishing a universal definition for what constitutes Jewishness is most complicated. Is Judaism a religion? A culture-a way of life? A nationality? A lan- guage? Can Judaism be identified with certain foods and prohibitions of the Sabbath? By characteristic physiognomical features? By particular moral and social practices? By a basic belief in the monotheistic teach- ings of the Old Testament? By the observances of certain traditional re- ligious customss Holy Days, attitudes of behavior? Is the Reform Jew as "Jewish' as the Orthodox Jew? The answer is obviously difficult and sub- ject to much interpretation, but surely all these are mutually involved. One wonders why Felix Mendelssohn's "Jewishness" is even mentioned in so many conventional historical treatments. He was deliberately sepa- rated from Jewish influences and both educated in and converted to Christianity. Yet by some definition Mendelssohn, notwithstanding con- version, is still traditionally listed along with Meyerbeer, Offenbach, Mahler, Schoenberg, and other Jewish composers. And what constitutes Jewish music? Certainly not mere titles. Bruch's Kol Nidre "is German-European in spirit and style.... In Bruch's con- ception the melody was an interesting theme for a brilliant secular con- certo.ss1l The same might be said of Bloch's music in spite of its abun- dance of augmented steps and minor keys. Honegger's Kirlg Davisl or Handel's Israel in Egypt cannot be considered Jewish music simply be- cause they are based on Old Testament themes. Nor can Marcello be considered Jewish or a composer of Jewish music simply because his fifty Psalms are based on llenetian synagog melodies. Certainly Schoen- berg's style and ideas offer little help even with appropriate themes and texts. Does Israeli music satisfy the search for definition, or should we first examine the folk motives of the Spanish, Russian, Polish, and Ger- man Jews for proper clues? Does the answer lie with the utilization of the particular modes of sacred music, or with the degree to which the music tends to express spiritual contemplation and exaltation in the lit- ugical service? The two questions-what is a Jew and what is Jewish music-reqwlire plofound levels of inquiry Involved are all that has been stated and more-a complex whole of related ideas and sources of knowledge. 9 Ibid ., p. 571. 10 Abraham Z.

Scam- man has done the necessary job of reviewing the Constitutional and ju- dicial aspects that bear upon the delicate relationships of music and religion in the public school: Many questions are still to be answered in the area of religion and govern- ment, especially with regard to music. Those dealing with these problems would do well to explore all available sources to determine the attitudes and modes of the community and the religious makeup of the indivitluals involved before proceeding.... Prudence and sound judgment exercised in the selec- tion and use of sacred music can greatly enhance experiences of students without violating the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.l2 The court issue before the public school is not the study of religion or of sacred music per se) but with the worshipful use of these in nonsec- tarian educational settings. But where is the line of separation between sacred music used for study and that used for worship? Is not perform- ance a facet of musical studies whether in formal concert or in the class- room? Just what are the objections? Of main concern is the violation of minority rights, whether Jewish, Christian, agnostic, or atheist. Scamman analyzes the Jewish position correctly. Since views differ depending upon orthodox, conserarative, or reform beliefs, a single posture is difficult to ascertain. The mainstream of Jewish thought, as expressed by the American Jewish Congress in 196S, has been summed up as follows: The Jewish community is generally opposed to the practice of holding cele- brations which have a Christological connotation in the public schools. They point out that such practices are deeply offensive to children who are non- Ghristians. "Jewish parents are often made resentful and apprehensive because their chilvlren are forced either to participate in Christological observances or, what is equally hurtful and injust, to isolate themselves by abstaining from participation. No public school pupil should ever be invited to isolate himself from his classmates and to stand alone during the festivities and the celebra- tions which in many schools encompass a major part of the school programs during the month of December.... The Jewish child, or his parent in his be- half, is left with the cruel choice of participating contrary to belief or of stand- ing exposed as odd and nonconformist.''13 The objections are derived from past historical and religious sensitivi- ties that Jews, in general, still feel today. The persecutions of the Cru- sades, the Spanish Inquisition, the Russian Pogroms, the ghetto conEne- ments, and the mass genocide in Nazi Germany-all engendered because of religious identification-cause the modern Jew to participate in Chris- tian affairs of a sacred nature only with mixed emotions. The elementary student may recognize the tune of "O Come, O Come, Emmanuel" as being somewhat similar to "God of Abraham" (Yigdal), 12 James Scamman, "Religious Music in the Public Schsols," M2"ic Educators Jour- nal, LIII (May 1967) 49. 13Ibid., 48.</page><page sequence="6">162 JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN MUSIC EDUCATION but the Christian message in the former will disturb him because of Judeo-Christian link and point of difference. Similarly, while the metody of "Silent Night" may be perfectly delightful to him, the text is an in- fringement on his beliefs. In some orthodox Jewish homes even the hum- ming of this melody (because of conditioned association with the text) is often forbidden. Difficulties of this sort do not exist with songs such as "Deck the Halls" or "Jingle Bells" except by particular association. If such problems arise with the singing of carols, what problems will arise with the textual considerations in larger works derived from and based an the Christian liturgy? Are more mature students (or even adults) immune from sensitive feelings about the crucifixion, for example? Conductors sometlmes try to produce special musical effects by spoken word-pictures (e.g. "Can you get the hate of the crowd into that 'vah'?"- Dubois, Seven Last Words).14 The "hate of the crowd" will have unique meanings for the Jew. To adorn this idea with special musical effects is a rather bitter emotional pill to swallow on any reasoned basis. One can develop an intellectual and cultural immunity to the biased epithet of "Christ-Killer," but to participate in an artistic reenactment-no matter how "beautiful" the work-tends to add insult to injury. Objections that transcend mere emotionalisms should also be understood by all con- cerned: 1. The last words of Christ were probably rendered in Hebrew. This ancient lament is still heard today-Eli, Eli, Lomo Azartoni. 2. A careful study of Jewish culture and history at that time will show that there were a number of messianic personalities who were highly questionable individuals. 3. The dogmatism of the ancient Sanhedrin (council of Rabbis) war- rants comparison with the questionable behavior of church hierarchy through the ages. A recall of the death of Toan of Arc, or the bitter blood shed because of the Church Militant under the banner of Divine guid- ance, or the persecutions that followed various movements for reform should be sufficient to draw religious and historical parallels. 4. The accounts of the birth, life, and death of Christ differ with hu- man interpretations. To nurture any one interpretation as "truth" is educationally dangerous. How much meaning and truth has been lost in translation we may never know. 5. To sing sacred literature, no matter how artistically significant, without due attention to textual interpretation would tend to create an aesthetic or spiritual void. To cause anyone to sing a sacred text in which he cannot believe spiritually or approve of intellectually is a violation of his religious beliefs. Attendance to musical and interpretative details is the responsibility of the director. On professional levels he can assume the comfortable pos- ture of the musical purist. But the director-educator has the added, albeit 14 Karl D. Ernst and Charles L. Gary, Music in General Education (Washington, D.C.: Music Educators National Conference, 1965), p. 77.</page><page sequence="7">163 ON RELIGION, MUSIC, AND EDUCATION diEcult, commitment to consider the spiritual feelings of the individuals that comprise the group as well as the general functions of education in a democratic society. He is in the unique position of fostering the spirit of ecumenism, of exposing feelings, of correcting the iniquities of biased thought, of imbuing students with a new kind of understanding that will enable them to rise above personal prejudices, so that the study and per- formance of sacred music can be welcomed appropriately on both educa- tional and artistic grounds. Spiritual values through music education are subject to further ques- tion: The word "spiritual" may require definition.... If spiritual means incor- poreal or nonmaterial, then music does have great spiritual value, and offers the students a worthy experience with something nonmaterial. But if the word "spiritual" is used to mean sacred or ecclesiastical, then the claim, along with the claim of moral value, is on shaky ground.... The principle of the separa- tion of church and state prohibits the public school from delving deeply into this area. If a religious number is sung in the public school, it is for the musical value of the song, and not for its religious message.15 Hoffer proposes an educational approach that is by and large a reflec- tion of conventional thought: If in a particular school it appears that there might be a religious problem, the teacher should talk with the superintendent or principal to find out what policy exists regarding religious music. If the school has no specific position on it, then the teacher should quietly discuss the matter with the student officers of the group. Generally, the student can simply refrain from singing, and this lack of participation will in no way affect his grade.... The less religious differences are emphasized, the better it is for everyone. The teacher should explain that the song is chosen for its musical values, and not for its religious message. The class is not seeking to promote religion, and the singing of a religious song does not mean that the singers are endorsing the theology of the text.... For the sake of religious broadmindedness and good music education, the music teacher should select a variety of good music from differing denominations and faiths.16 Both this analysis and proposed solution tend to oversimplify issues on several grounds: 1. Separation of musical values from a religious message involves more than mere explanation. The proper study of Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice, for example, requires an adequate understanding of the socio- cultural status of the Jew in that day. 2. An endorsement of the theology of the text is not the issue. 3. The student officers of the group may not be the logical individuals to be approached. The possible resentment by one's peers could be the result. 15 Charles R. Hoffer, Teaching Music in the Secondary Schools (Belmont, California: Wadsworth Publishing Company, Inc., 1964), p. 20. 16 I^id -} pp. 74-75.</page><page sequence="8">164 JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN MUSIC EDUCATION 4. The use of music to promote religion, patriotism, political reform, and so forth, is a matter of history. How this is to be avoided, or whether it should be avoided in public education, are the issues. 5. To invite a student not to sing is to admit that the religious over- tones are present and that music education is Janus-faced. 6. Religious differences do exist. Rather than a deemphasis of differ- ences (and similarities), the school has the ecumenical obligation and Constitutional right to study these. 7. The student's grade is a minor matter. But it does motivate some hard thinking about spiritual values in music education and the means of evaluation. 8. "Religious broadmindness" and "good music" are relative terms, not easily defined, especially for educational purposes. However, Hoffer does suggest a general procedure for a unit on "Music in Religion" that is worthy of further study in terms of ecumenical awareness: Present musical high points of Protestant worship service, Catholic mass, and Judaic service. Show how the text affects the music used. Sing and hear re- cordings of Protestant hymns, chorales, or anthems; chants from the Catholic mass and chant-like melodies in modern notation; and musical portions of the Jewish service. Examine songs that have a background in more than one faith.t7 Such units are most appropriate for general music or humanities classes. The Court has not banned historical and religious study and dis- cussion, provided instruction remains objective and ideas not coercive. Questions of sacred music should be examined openly utilizing, without limitations, Old as well as New Testaments. This concept was reinforced in reply to a letter written to the Music Educators Journal: The Court had no intention of excluding the study of religion or the use of religious materials from the schools. As Paul Freund, a professor of Constitu- tional law at Harvard Universtiy, said, "The school prayer decisions are more im- portant for the doors they leave open than for those they shut." School adminis- trators have been given the responsibility for deciding what doors to keep open to allow teachers to present Western culture with some degree of comprehen- siveness: Justice Brennan wrote in a concurring opinion in 1963: ". . . it would be impossible to teach meaningfully many subjects in the social sciences or the humanities without some mention of religion. To what extent and at what points in the curriculum religious materials should be cited, are matters which the courts ought to entrust very largely to the experienced officials who superin- tend our Nation's public schools." But the issue is still a delicate one. Brennan added, "If it should sometime hereafter be shown that in fact religion can play no part in the teaching of a given subject without resurrecting the ghost of the practices we strike down today, it will then be time enough to consider ques- tions we must now defer." The role of the music educator is clear. He has a professional duty to use sacred music . . . but he must use it educationally in a way that does not assume the character of a religious observance.18 17 Ibid., pp. 339-340. "Readers Comment," Music Educators Jourrlal, LV (September 1968), 11.</page><page sequence="9">165 ON RELIGION, MUSIC, AND EDUCATION There are both cultural and religious reasons that explain why Jewish composers and artists have emerged only in comparatively recent history. The complexities of Jewish secular and sacred music should be studied so that new understandings are permitted to emerge. Are Israeli songs re- ligious? Is Hebrew a religious language? Are there secular songs sung in Hebrew? What is the origin of the Jewish language and how has it in- fluenced Jewish music as well as Tin Pan Alley? Why is the text to the hymn "Rock of Ages" suitable for all three denominations? What are the social, political, and religious pressues that have banned or reformed re- ligious music in the past? In what ways is the folk mass both religious and secular? Can you think of commonly known folk songs containing texts that may be offensive to some races} College as well as high school students in humanities or appreciation courses should become involved in applicable politicoreligious issues- socialist realism, Kulturbolshewismus, and so forth. Appropriate text- books, including music series books, need to be developed at all levels that will point up critical and valid understandings of problems of both religion and race relationships. Legal entanglements arise in the public schools when performing groups become involved with worship services. The religious connota- tions of Nativity plays or vesper services, for example, are violations of the Constitution. It follows that music teachers, notably choral directors, must question both the occasion for performance as well as the specific literature used. While the legalities apply to public school, textual prolb lems in sacred music persist even in higher education: In much sacred music the theology or the symbolism or both is offensive to many, even though they are by training and native bent spiritually minded. Changing taste has removetl "There is a fountain filled with blood" from the repertoire of most colleges, so we are spared that gruesome horror and most similar ones, but many stumbling blocks remain. What many feel to be the anthropomorphic symlsolism of the Trinity, which persists in the texts of much sacred music, including many of the hymns that are musically of the first rank, e.g., Nun Danket and All Creatures of Our God and King, is disturbing to those who find it a clumsy and primitive way of suggesting the many-sidedness of God. Texts which contain phrases like "The Lamb of God" which presuppose orig- inal sin and the vicarious sacriSce offend others. Such phrases from the creeds as "He descended into Hell" or "I believe in the resurrection of the body" cause even greater difficulty in some quarterss while the terriSed egocentricity of "Libera Me" and other parts of the requiem mass are not only unacceptable theologically, but a source of acute dislike.19 Obviously, the key to an adequate solution rests ultimately with the sensitive and well-informed music educator. Of singular importance is the development of the attitude that participation in actual perfonnance produces a better grasp of the aesthetic import of great music than mere listening or nonparticipation. Thus, our general goal must necessarily '9 Joseph S. Daltry, Religious Perspectives of College Teaching in Music (New Haven, Connecticut: The Edward W. Hazen Foundation, 1951), p. 23.</page><page sequence="10">166 JOURNAL OF RESE:ARCH IN MUSIC EDU(:ATION be positive rather than negative. Perhaps interfaith progzams planned discreetly to include materials-both musically and spiritually valid- would provide one possible positive approach.20 Here, too, care must be taken to avoid triteness or misrepresentation. All final questions of interpretation, implementation, and responsibil- ity seem to center on the nature of the desirable kind of teacher. Are music educators willing and able to accept the ecumenical challenge within the democratic prohibitions of the First Amendment? Will they recognize the unique position of public education in our society as the logical agency for the exploration of issues and the development of understandings? If it is possible to study Communism without indoctrination or to ex- amine the ills of contemporary society without prornoting the seeds of revolution, then it must also be possible to study sacred music (with per- formance-related activities) without parochialistic attitudes and sectarian * ^ - polnts ot vlew.
