<plain_text><page sequence="1">Evolution of the Palaeolithic in Central and Eastern Europe by Karel Valock HYPOTHESES ON PROCESSES of cultural evolution in the Old Stone Age always reflect the known facts concerning the temporal divisions of the Palaeolithic and the content of its cultural stages. A survey of present knowledge on the Palaeolithic occupation of Central and Eastern Europe will probably be of interest to a broad range of specialists. The most important base for knowledge of the temporal sequence of all the occupation phases is the geological stratigraphy of the Pleistocene (See Table 1). Since there is considerable difference of opinion on various problems in this special area, I consider it necessary to emphasize that I have used here largely Zeuner's (1958) system of division, supplemented by Movius' (1960) detailed divi- sion of the last Ice Age and the palynologically demon- strated anaglacial temperature fluctuations of Amersfoort and Brorup of Andersen (1961), and Zagwijn (1961). The geographical area included here extends from Ger- many, Austria, and Yugoslavia in the west to the Urals and Caucasus in the east. THE EARLY PALAEOLITHIC Chronologically, the Early Palaeolithic comprises the immensely long period of time from the appearance of the first human tools up to the development of the poly- KAREL VALOCH was born in Brno in 1920.

In terms of stratigraphy, this is the time from the beginning of Pleistocene until the beginning of the next-to-last glacial (Riss or Saale). In Central and Eastern Europe, finds of artifacts from this period are very rare, and the oldest of them tend to be highly problematic. Presumably the oldest traces of human activity in this area consist of broken bones of animals from the Villa- franchian stage from Bugiule?ti, Rumania; these have been compared by the excavators to the osteodontoceratic culture of the Australopithecines (Nicolaescu-Plopsor and Nicolaescu-Plopsor 1963). Shattered bones of animals suggesting human activity were found in an Old Pleisto-- cene fauna complex similar to the Cromerian on the peninsula of Taman, Kurgan Cimbal at the Kerc Straits; (Verescagin 1957). From terrace gravels of the Giinz/ Mindel Interglacial from Mauer, near Heidelberg, Ger- many, (known as the site of the discovery of the Heidelberg lower jaw), come some pieces of quartzite sandstone which show percussion traces and have been proclaimed by Rust (1956) to be artifacts of the so-called Heidel-- bergian stage. Of the seven type groups distinguished by Rust, the "nose side-scrapers," suggesting the rostro- carinate forms of the Old Pleistocene of England, are the- most remarkable. Rust presumes the Heidelbergian to. have spread all over the north of Germany; H. Mohr and M. Mottl found pebbles deformed in a similar manner in the Old Pleistocene Danube terraces near Vienna, and K. 2ebera found them in Central Bohemia. It is virtually impossible to determine whether these bone fragments and pebbles were really fashioned by man or whether they are only products of nature, since we lack any unequivocal criteria by which to evaluate them. Such forms could undoubtedly have originated naturally, as^ has been proved satisfactorily in the case of the old con-- troversy over eoliths. On the other hand, it seems very- probably that the earliest human tools and products were simple forms of this kind. The first unobjectionable human artifacts in Central Europe, and at the same time the oldest habitation in situ, occur in the Mindel (Elster) -age travertines of Vertes- szollos, North Hungary (Kretzoi and Vertes 1965a).

Chrono- logically it belongs to the Intermindelian warm period, according to Kretzoi. Both of the culture layers contain a large number of artifacts and waste material as well as shattered bones of animals.; somewhat burnt bones con- centrated in some places provide evidence for the use of fire. Vertes (1965) suggests that the artifacts be called the Buda industry, after the small number of artifacts, associ- ated with a similar fauna found in Budapest in the 1930's. Of about the same age is a pebble shaped like a chopping- tool which I found myself on a Mindel terrace of the Danube at Pestlorinc, near Budapest, in 1964. A little later, genuine pebble-tools appear in Central Bohemia. K. Zebera was lucky enough to find numerous choppers, chopping-tools, and Clacton-like flakes on the surface of a Mindel terrace of the Moldau within the brickworks of Sedlec, near Prague. This important strati- fied industry corresponds to the rich surface finds made at Mlazice near Melnik (Zebera 1952), and Zebera (1965) wants to term it Bohemian. The spread of a pebble-tool industry over vast areas of Central Europe is also shown by the many recent surface discoveries in the Oberhessen and Bavarian regions of Germany (Krtiger 1959, Freund 1963). Artifacts of a civilization different from that of the pebble-tools appear in Central Europe for the first time in the great Interglacial (Mindel/Riss or Holstein). They are hand-axes of the Western European Abbevillian/ Acheulean groups. A morphologically rather primitive object was picked up from gravels corresponding to the layer of human remains at Steinheim on the Murr, near the discovery site of the Steinheim skull, a few years ago 352 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="3">:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I Fig. lb.

Toward the end of the Holstein Inter- glacial or the beginning of the Riss (Drenthe) Glacial, industries appear in Germany that contain, in addition to the fine hand-axes, numerous Levallois forms (such as flakes, blades, points, cores), some variously retouched points, side-scrapers, and occasionally other types. The most important sites are situated in Leine gravels around Hannover (Ddhren, Rethen, Arnum, and Henningen [Jacob-Friesen 1949]) and in Pleisse gravels near Leipzig (Markkleeberg, Cr6bern, and Zehmen [Grahmann 1955]). Some smaller finds, similar typologically, come from river gravels at Hundisburg, Wangen, and Wallen- dorf (Toepfer 1961 a, b). Bosinski (1963) was the first to remind us of the fact that the open habitation of Leben- stedt (Tode et al. 1953) and the lowest layer of the Balve cave (Gunther 1964) correspond typologically to the industries of Hannover and Markkleeberg, irrespective of their being dated back to the early Wiirm and to the late Eem respectively. Together they form a homogeneous group which corresponds to the French Acheulean, and which Bosinski would like to designate as Lebenstedt. Rust puts the artifacts of the Altona stage of Witten- bergen, near Hamburg, which he considers to be a con- tinuation of the Heidelbergian, into the Holstein Inter- glacial. In addition to many pieces resembling the moraine eoliths (cf. Adrian 1948), this complex seems also to contain unequivocal Clactonoid flakes (Rust 1962). In Southeastern Europe, too, pebble-tools represent the most primitive stone tools known so far. Nicolaescu- PlopFor and Moro?an (1959) have reported an industry containing choppers, chopping-tools, and blade-like flakes from a secondary deposit found in the valley of Dirjov, a tributary of the Olt in Rumania; Ba.rta (1965) mentions some similar finds in Farka?ele, which is also near the Olt. A crudely shaped piece of andesite from very old gravels at Capusulmic in western Rumania (Breuil 1925) and the fragment of an artifact of unknown age from Monastir, Serbia (Patte 1918) can be considered as hand- *axe-like.

Early Palaeolithic. =Hand-axes |||||||| Flake industries ///,gPebble-tools The Early Palaeolithic of Eastern Europe is still in- suficiently studied; only a few unstratified finds can be included in its framework, and these only with reserva- tions. In a recent survey of finds from the region of the Dniestr, Cerny's (I1965) considers as lower Palaeolithic the sites of Luka Vrubleveckaja I and III, as well as finds from the surroundings of the site Babin I in the western Ukraine and the new sites of Vychvatincy I-III, Gura Kamenka IV, Rogoz'ana, and Poiana in Moldavia. The artifacts are largely only flakes retouched of necessity, some a smooth Clactonoid type (especially at Luka Vrubleveckaja I), some with a simply prepared striking- platform, and they are accompanied by a few irregular cores. Gura Kamenka IV has also produced the fragment of a biface-fashioned artifact, but true hand-axes have not yet been found anywhere. The industries of Vych- vatincy I-III correspond to the gravels of the third Dniestr terrace (average height of 50 m.) , which is con- sidered to be of the Riss stage (Cerny's 1965). Finds of Clactonoid flakes and isolated pebble-tools have also been reported from the territory of the rivers Oka and Moskva (Krasnyj stan on the Moskva, Kamir on the Oka Rivers, respectively) , probably corresponding to the river deposits up to a point (Potockij 196 1). A richer source of Early Palaeolithic finds is the eastern coast of the Black Sea, from the river Kuban to the pro- montory of the Caucasus. The unstratified complexes found in this region-at Fortepianka (Formozov 1952) and at Abadzechskaja, in the area of Majkop (Autlev 1963)-consist of Clactonoid flakes , some of them re- touched in the manner of side scrapers, some notched, and hand-axes or hand-axe-like artifacts, cores, and isolated chopping-tools. Although the Early Palaeolithic is not very well represented in Central and Eastern Europe, the known -findsq don permit so'me interpre-tations. Tn the- first place, the biface group of the AbbevilianAhuen,dmnn FiG. 4.ser EarlypPlacoisthic. tdnyslgtyee Thouhte ERlyialedolihi notfor Easen Europue isostill in- the spread of hand-axes, as was once suggested, biface industries east of the Rhine are still very, very rare, and one gets the impression of radiation from the area of the Acheulean, gradually decreasing as one proceeds east- ward. There are quite a lot of characteristic hand-axes at Hessen and Hannover, very few at Markkleeberg and the rest of the middle German sites; the accompanying flakes and cores of Clactonian or Levalloisian form define per- fectly their typological picture. It is quite reasonable to annex these industries, which undoubtedly were under the influence of the Western hand-axe group, to the Acheulean. The exact dating of this Lebenstedt group (in Bosinski's sense) can be considered one of the main questions of the Early Palaeolithic in Central Europe, for though R. Grahmann and F. Hamm have suggested an ante-Saale-period age (before Drenthe) for the finds of Markkleeberg and Hannover respectively, various doubts and objections have been raised against such a date. Early Palaeolithic remains from Germany to Rumania belong to the pebble-tool group (Zebera's Bohemian) that existed here independent of the biface-group; one can substantiate it as early as the Mindel (Elster) Glacial (not only in Hungary, but also at Achenheim on the western bank of the Rhine in Alsace [Wernert 1957]). One could see its origin in the pebble-industry of the Heidelbergian if it were possible to prove that the latter is in fact of human origin. As far as the possible connection with the first Clactonian stage is concerned, let us refer here to Vertes (1965). Vertesszollos occupies a special place in this pebble-tool group on account of the unusually small implements. The question must remain open whether this is only a local circumstance due to the availability of only small pieces of flint, or whether this industry represents an independent facies of small forms. So far not a single hand-axe or other unobjectionably stratified Early Palaeolithic industry has come from Eastern Europe as far as the Urals. The flake industries of the Dniestr in West Ukraine and of the Moskva and Oka, which clearly belong to the Early Palaeolithic, can be designated as Clactonoid. The markedly richer source region on the eastern Black Sea coast in the northern foothills of the Caucasus, which has produced Clactonoid industries accompanied by a few hand-axes, was un- doubtedly influenced directly by the richly developed Transcaucasian Early Palaeolithic of Abchazia, Georgia, and Armenia. THE MIDDLE PALAEOLITHIC The immensely rich Middle Palaeolithic of France has been shown, with the aid of Bordes's (1950) statistical method, to be a richly divided complex of industries differing both typologically and technologically. The Middle Palaeolithic of Central and Eastern Europe, which is much poorer, will perhaps not be able to be divided into so many facies, yet here also some internal differences can be discerned (Valoch 1965a). One can presume that as early as the Riss (Saale) Glacial, typo- logical and technological diffierentiation took place among the Early Palaeolithic complexes, creating the basis for the development of the various industries known today. However, we still lack any unobjectionable finds, stratified 354 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="5">Valoch: PALAEOLITHIC IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE and therefore dateable, that would document this typo- logical evolution. Scattered finds such as those from the brickworks of Bockingen and Murg, from the cave of Hunas in South Germany, and from the area of Raciborz in South Poland indicate that the area was inhabited during this cold time and its warm Interstadials. In the subsequent Riss/Wuirm (Eem) Interglacial there appear some relatively well-defined complexes of industries, pre- supposing evolution from the Early Palaeolithic. The evolution of the Middle Palaeolithic covers a period of ca. 150,000 years from the beginning of the Riss Glacial to the Middle Wuirm-Interstadial Podhradem. A more significant group, appearing fairly frequently in the western part of Central Europe, is one that corres- ponds to the biface group of Western Europe. It contains industries distinguished by largely sharp-pointed hand- axes with a thick base, hand-axe-leaves, and small hand- axes, and designated as Micoquian or, in the later phase of their evolution, as Charentien of Micoque tradition. For the period of the last Interglacial, we have as yet insufficient proof of the existence of this Micoque group, yet such industries appear in several localities of South and West Germany in the late Eem, and reach their climax in the early Wurm. In these industries, side- scrapers of various forms predominate, among which those with surface retouch (either uni- or bifacial) are typical. Typical Mousterian points are very rare, repre- sented by a single example in most cases, and the Levallois types (points, blades, cores) and the Levallois technique (prepared striking-platform) are almost completely ab- sent. The shape of hand-axes is very variable; only excep- tionally are bifaces of various kinds more frequent than other shapes (e.g. at Bocksteinschmiede in Wuirttemberg, [Bosinski 1967]). The number of hand-axes is usually smaller than that of the side-scrapers (e.g., at Klausen- nische in Bavaria, and at Balve, layer II, Illa, b, in Westfalia) or they appear only singly (e.g., at Vogelherd and Heidenschmiede in Wiirttemberg). The finds of the Balve cave are of importance for the temporal limitation of this Micoquian, insofar as they overlie strata containing industries of the Lebenstedt group of the Acheulean (Gunther 1964). The above-mentioned sites of the Micoque group are essentially limited to the western margin of Central Europe. It is only in very recent years that a similar industry was discovered at K6nigsaue, near Aschersleben, Central Germany. According to a preliminary communi- cation by Toepfer (I 965), the lower layer of K6nigsaue is distinguished by a strong Micoquian tradition. Farther east, in the region of Krakow, South Poland, the caves of Ciemna and Okiennik and the loess dwellings of Piekary and those on the Wawel have produced numerous racloirs dejetes a retouche biface, designated as "Pradnik knives" by Krukowski (1948), as well as hand-axes. Chmielewski (1965) has recently been digging the small cave Wylotne, situated in the same region, and has uncovered a sur- prisingly rich industry on three horizons, with many bifaces, a number of them of considerable size, side-, point- and transversal-scrapers, treated on both surfaces, and fairly frequent use of the Levalloisian technique. Wylotne is the richest hand-axe site in the eastern part of Central Europe today. These Polish finds belong to the Low and Early Wuirm, with the possible exception of the Wawel site, which may belong to the Eem. In Moravia, Czechoslovakia, excavations in the cave of K Oulna have, for the first time uncovered a Charentien of Micoquian tradition, represented by one fairly large hand-axe and numerous smaller axes. On the basis of their stratigraphical position, these finds pertain to a fairly recent phase near the end of the Lower Wurm (Valoch 1967). Another group, which is to be considered preliminarily as independent, is formed by very rich quartzite industries of Hessen, West Germany (Lenderscheid, Reutersruh, R6rsheim), in which there occur, in addition to the typical hand-axes of the Acheulean, axes of Micoquian tradition, leaf-point forms, tortoise cores, Mousterian and Leval- loisian points, Levalloisian flakes, and side-scrapers of various forms. There is another facies, this one closely connected with the biface groups, which I shall call (following G. Freund and H. J. Muller-Beck) the Middle Palaeolithic with leaf- points. In Central Europe, it is essentially limited to southern Germany (see Muller-Beck 1957). It can be placed in the early Wiirm due to its clear stratigraphical position in the lower layer of the Weinberg caves near Mauern (Zotz 1955). It is also represented in the caves of Middle and Upper Klause, Kleine Ofnet, Oberneder, and Haldenstein and the open site of Kosten. This type of industry has so far been unknown in the rest of Central Europe, but our recent excavations in the Kfulna cave produced two leaf-points from a layer beneath the Charentian of Micoquian tradition, a layer which may possibly belong to the early Wurm. This group is distin- guished from the Micoquian by the absence of hand-axes, which are replaced by leaf-points; the accompanying industry consisting of side-scrapers seems not to be too different. Obermaier and Wernert (1929) found a gradual morphological transition from hand-axes to leaf-points in the finds from the Klaussenische cave. An analogous development can also be observed in Eastern Europe, where the centre seems to have been situated in the Crimea. In contrast to Central Europe, here hand-axes and leaf-points co-occur in the Micoquian facies, but since the morphological difference between the types is relatively small it is impossible to distinguish hand-axe and leaf-point groups. The accompanying industry differs insignificantly from that of Central Europe, except for the greater proportion of blades and the more frequent occurrence of Mousterian points. To the well-known finds from the upper layer of the cave Kiik-Koba can be added finds from the caves of Cokurca, Volcij grot, Kabazi, Bachcisaraj, Cholodnaja balka, and the newly examined site at Staroselje (Formozov 1958), all probably belonging to the lower Wurm. West of this Crimean centre, similar finds occur in the cave of Vychvatincy on the Dniestr, Moldavia, (containing ele- ments of a temperate fauna, [Sergejev 1950]) and the open sites of Gorodisce, near Zitomir, and of Antonowka, Ukrainia. Still farther to the east, this group is enriched by finds from the site of Ilskaja on the Kuban and from the important site at Suchaja Mecetka in Volgograd (Zamjatnin 1961). Still other typologically clearly defined groups of in- dustries occur in Central Europe in the Eem Interglacial. One of the best-known is to be found in the travertine Vol. 9 ;No. 5 December 1968 355</page><page sequence="6">deposits of Weimar-Ehringsdorf, Middle Germany. Behm-Blancke (1960) distinguishes here three stages of evolution for the industries designated by him as the Weimar culture: Stage I, from Taubach, coming from the first third of the Eem; Stage II, in Weimar, from the first half of the Eem, and Stage III, in Ehringsdorf, from the second half of the Eem. The first two stages are classed typologically with the Tayacian, and stage III is con- sidered as the Interglacial root culture of the later leaf- points. In both of the earlier stages, there are scraper-like retouched flakes, implements fairly frequently dentate and notched, end-scrapers, borers, retouched blades, Tayac points, and prepared striking platforms in most of the artifacts. Pieces of stag antler employed as choppers are notable. In stage III, in which side-scrapers pre- dominate, double-points (limaces or protolimaces), and, later, points showing uni- or bifacial surface retouch are characteristic. Other types (such as end-scrapers, borers, burins) are infrequent. Some of the artifacts have faceted striking platforms. According to Behm-Blancke, there are ten artifact-bearing layers at Ehringsdorf, not only in the lower travertine, but also in the clayey interlayer (Pariser) and in the upper travertine. On the basis of comparison of the Ehringsdorf section with that of Amersfoort and also with the loess sections of Moravia, one can assume that the upper travertine I corresponds to the Amersfoort Interstadial and the upper travertine II above the Pseudo- pariser to the Brorup Interstadial (Musil and Valoch 1966). It would be possible, therefore, to observe a very long industrial development at this site. A less clear group is formed by industries of the west of Central Europe, which contain neither hand-axes nor leaf-points, and in whose techniques there are only weak tendencies toward surface retouching. The absence of these types and techniques may be due only to the small number of finds; while they do not appear here until the Lower Wtirm, they must surely have existed as early as the Interglacial. In this group Mousterian side-scrapers of various shapes predominate, characteristic Mousterian points and also double points are represented, and the Levalloisian technique is used. There are also some elements of the Upper Palaeolithic (such as end-scrapers, burins, blades) to be found in some of the more recent of these industries (the upper Lower Palaeolithic with end- scrapers, according to Muller-Beck [1957]). Here impor- tant sites are the caves of Sirgenstein (Layer VII), Schulerloch, and Irpfelhohle in South Germany, and the lower layer in the clay pit of Rheindalen in the Rhineland (Bosinski unpublished), which overlies Wiirm loesses. Only a thorough statistical treatment of the material could show to which group of the Mousterian complex the isolated finds belong; yet it seems likely that a Central European facies of the Charentian is frequently repre- sented here. The majority of the Middle Palaeolithic of eastern Central Europe can be described as a regional represen- tative of the typical Mousterian. It is distinguished by the presence of side-scrapers with surface retouch, partial or total, uni- or, less often, bifacial. This retouch, however, never leads to genuine leaf-points or even hand-axes. The number of artifacts with surface retouch varies greatly from isolated examples to as much as 2O0%. The pre- dominate type is the side-scraper; dentate and notched pieces occur fairly frequently; Mousterian and Leval- loisian points are very rare or absent; faceted striking platforms are infrequent. Two facies can be distinguished, for the time being solely on the basis of morphological criteria. The one is strikingly small-sized, and is made of river pebbles of various materials, among them quartz, quartzite, hornstone, radiolarite, andesite, etc. This facies appears as early as the Eem Interglacial in the travertine beds of Slovakia-Ganovce, Ondrej, Bojnice, and Beha- rovce; the site in the travertine of Tata, northern Hun- gary, which is the best known, belongs to the period of the Brorup (Vertes 1964); the sites of Bojnice-Prepostska' cave, Predmosti II, Jislova cave, and Slany in Czecho- slovakia pertain to the very end of the Lower Wurm. I would term this facies Tata type after the site at which it was discovered (Kormos 1912). The other facies, con- sisting of rather larger artifacts, is characterized by the use of a single kind of raw material predominantly and by a greater proportion of dentate artifacts (&lt;20%). It is found at the best-known sites in this area. The Gudenus cave in lower Austria is notable in that, contrary to the original report by Obermaier and Breuil, no marked hand-axe tradition can be found here, but only side- scrapers finished on both sides and mostly showing only partial surface retouch. The Interglacial stage of this facies might perhaps be represented by the well-known Krapina in Yugoslavia, provided that the dating by Gorjanovic-Kramberger (1906) is correct (cf. Guenther 1959). A late stage reaching into the Middle Wiurm Interstadial Podhradem is also known from the Sipka cave in Moravia, and again it contains a considerable proportion of Upper Palaeolithic types (nearly 150% end- scrapers, burins, and borers). Since this latter site was the first to produce this facies (Maska 1886), I would like to term the facies the Sipka type. To it can be assigned the important Hungarian site of Subalyuk cave, upper layer, and those of the Carpathian region of Rumania-the caves of Bordul Mare near Ohaba Ponor, Baie de Fier, Curata near Nandru, etc., and the open site of Boine?ti. (A statistical study of these great complexes offinds might, of course, lead to completely different and perhaps contradictory conclusions.) A number of sites in Central Europe can be identified as Tayacian. We have already seen that Behm-Blancke assigned Taubach and Weimar to the Tayacian group. The important Alpine cave Repolust, in Austria, has an industry dated on the basis of its fauna into the Eem, and ascribed to the Tayacian (Mottl 1951). The tools, made predominantly of quartzite, include in addition to the usual side-scrapers, dentate, and notched pieces, distinct end-scrapers, and burins. In Moravia, I have distinguished preliminarily two Tayacian facies, viz., the Baume-Bonne type (according to de Lumley and Bottet 1960) and that of Fontechevade (according to Henri-Martin 1957). I have assigned the pre-Wiirm industry from the deepest layer of the K Oulna cave to the Baume-Bonne facies. Made of brook pebbles, the industry contains small tools of rather atypical form, most of them flakes with border retouch; true side-scrapers are not very frequent. Similar finds are reported by L. Zotz from his recent excavations in the Sesselfels cave, Altm+ihl Valley, Bavaria, where there are many atypical small flake implements in addition to classic side-scrapers. Some artifacts are finished with a bifacial surface retouch. End-scrapers and burins occur singly. On the basis of the 356 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="7">more developed types, I consider the Sesselfels a bit younger than the lower layer of the KPlna.1 The Font'- chevade facies includes the surface finds of Vedrovice in South Moravia, consisting of big chopping-tools, cores with blade-like flakes, a few side-scrapers, and dentate tools; the Levalloisian technique is absent almost entirely. Another interesting group of finds was discovered by Krukowski, in the bottom Interglacial layers of the Okiennik cave in southern Poland, beneath the Pradnik (Micoquian) industry. It consists of flakes and a few blades with very steep margins, often notched, likely to be explained as side-scrapers, notches, borers, etc. The majority of artifacts have platforms faceted by the Leval- loisian technique. Edges are frequently rounded, suggest- ing the possibility that the secondary operation of mechanical or chemical processes has produced a number of pseudo-artifacts. This group was designated as "Dupi- cian" by Krukowski (1948). The same sort of industry, here termed "Tayacian," was found recently by Chmie- lewski (1965) in the Interglacial layer of the Nietoperzowa cave near Jerzmanowice, and accompanied by an in- dustry of the biface-Mousterian of Wylotne.2 In Southeastern and Eastern Europe, still another group is recognizable. In contradistinction to the Mousterian complex of Central Europe, this group is distinguished by a relatively large proportion of narrow Levalloisian blades, often retouched bilaterally as points, and of the Levalloisian technique. The sites Molodova I and V on the Dniestr offer an insight into these industries. Cernys (1965) was able to find four horizons of the Mousterian in Molodova V and five in Molodova I, as well as the ground-plan of a habitation in the next-to-lowest horizon. The industries of the various layers are apparently genetically related. All of them are characterized by a strong Levalloisian character in their technology (i.e., prepared striking platforms, typical cores) and typology (many blades, typical points, and flakes). The age is attested by C14 data: layer 4 of Molodova I is dated at 44,000 B.P. (GrN 3659) and layer 11 of Molodova V at 40,300 B.P. (GrN 4017). It may reasonably be assumed that this group also includes the rich Middle Palaeolithic of eastern and southern Rumania, as well as the lower layers of the caves Bacho-Kiro and Devetaki in Bulgaria and of the rock shelter Crvena Stijena in Yugoslavia. Its influence in Central Europe can be observed in the lower pre-Wurm layer of Subalyuk cave, in Hungary, whose industry includes the Levalloisian technique as well as blades retouched on both sides. This division of the Middle Palaeolithic of Southeastern and Eastern Europe, however, cannot be considered satis- factory. Bonc-Osmolovskij (1940) has identified the lower layer of Kiik-Koba as Tayacian; Nicolaescu-Plop?or re- ports a Clactonoid industry, probably of Eem age, from Malul Galben near Mitoc; a Tayacian (?) with leaf- points has been reported from Mamaia on the Black Sea; and a Middle Palaeolithic specimen showing leaf-points is reported from Pantanassa, Macedonia. Extensive recent excavations by A. Paunescu have uncovered a rich multi- stratal site at La Izvor-Ripiceni in Rumania. P. I. Boris- 1 I am very much obliged to the late Prof. Zotz for kindly letting me see the finds. 2 Reported by W.

Middle Palaeolithic. lI Finds from the Riss Glacial Micoquian Leaf-points M||||Rousterian of western European character /////"Tayacian" \\\\\\\Eastern Middle European Mousterian JEastern Mousterian F Middle Palaolothic of unknown appurtenance kovskij and N. D. Praslov have investigated several new sites on the Dniepr and on the coast of the Asovian Sea. A preliminary attempt at a division of the Middle Palaeo- lithic in the Crimea and on the Russian Plain has been made by V. N. Gladilin (1966), using Bordes's statistical method. The results of this and similar studies might well change in many respects the picture given here and might also lead to the establishment of new groups and facies. My descriptions of different groups here can therefore be only rough characterizations. In spite of the many unknowns, let us consider some typogenetic connections. In the west of Central Europe there is, as in the Early Palaeolithic, an influential hand- axe group, undoubtedly dependent upon Western Europe, yet here serving to define an independent Micoquian group. The Micoquian wave becomes ever weaker as one proceeds eastward until, in southern Poland, another, perhaps secondary, centre of development appears. The typogenetic relationship between the Micoquian and the Middle Palaeolithic with leaf-points, seems to be close, and they cover approximately the same area. Another great centre of the hand-axe/leaf-point Middle Palaeo- lithic is the southern part of Eastern Europe, especially the Crimea. It is not out of the question for this group to have had its roots in the hand-axe Early Palaeolithic of Asia Minor, spreading northwest as far as the Ukraine and northeast as far as the middle Volga. Many characteristics of the as yet unpublished Fonte- chevade facies of the Tayacian of Moravia lead us to consider a typogenetic relationship with the pebble in- dustry (Bohemian) of the Early Palaeolithic. If we suppose that the strikingly small implements of the micro-chopper facies (Buda industry) are definitive and not simply con- Vol. 9 N No. 5- December 1968 A* 357</page><page sequence="8">ditioned by the raw material, then we can trace their survival in the small tools of the Middle Palaeolithic. This survival is the more significant in that it is contrary to the general line of evolution of the stone tools; during the Middle Palaeolithic, stone tools generally became slimmer whereas these became larger. Similar relatively small- sized industries, also made of quartz, are found in the Mousterian of the Tata type and in the Baume-Bonne facies of the Tayacian, making it possible to exclude an a priori relationship between these groups. It seems that the industries of the Mousterian complex in the west of Central Europe (Germany) were closer to the various facies of France and perhaps influenced directly by them, while the east Central European Mousterian of the Sipka type gives a more "atypical" or "primitive" impression. It is, however, fairly certain that a true Levalloisian facies in Bordes' sense is thus far absent in the whole of Central Europe and that the Levalloisian technique is represented to a relatively small extent. This is one of the most striking differences between the Middle Palaeolithic of Central and Eastern and of Western Europe. The more remarkable, then, is the fairly strong survival in Southeastern Europe of Levalloisian forms and technique and a relatively large proportion of blades. Special attention should be paid to the question of the natural origin of pseudo-artifacts, or the natural deforma- tion of true artifacts, by mechanical (cryogenic) or chemi- cal processes, especially in connection with the "Dupi- cian" or "Tayacian" of southern Poland and many phenomena within the Sipka facies. The relationships between the many contemporaneous groups of industries are completely unknown. Investiga- tion of the meaning of technique and typology in the identification ofEarly Palaeolithic cultures of civilizations is of the utmost importance. Important unknowns are to be sought in the crowded area of Western Europe. THE UPPER PALAEOLITHIC We have seen that during the Middle Palaeolithic there came a widespread diversification of industries, both technological and typological. The evolution ofthe Upper Palaeolithic was a continuation of this process under somewhat altered conditions. The remnants of material culture, which had previously consisted almost exclusively of stone artifacts, were now enriched by objects of bone and by art objects, as well by ground-plans of habitations. The appearance of the Upper Palaeolithic in Central and Eastern Europe is associated with the climatically favor- able period marked by a soil in loess sections and by dark loam in cave sediments of the Middle Wurm Interstadial Podhradem. According to radiocarbon data, the Upper Palaeolithic begins a bit after 40,000 years B.P. and ends in the Upper Wuirm, ca. 12,000 B.P. It is interesting that only a few of the earliest industries of the Upper Palaeolithic are clearly linked to the Middle Palaeolithic typologically and technologically; the rest are made up of quite new elements. The only convincing example of typogenetic connection between the Middle and Upper Palaeolithic is provided by the leaf-point industries, among them the industry from the Szeleta cave in Hungary. The name of this cave has in recent years become the term applied to the early Upper Palaeo- lithic with leaf-points of the circum-Carpathian territory in the east of Central Europe (Gabori 1953, Prosek 1953). The technology and typology of the Szeletian have strong Mousteroid traditions; flakes exceed true narrow blades in most cases, the Levalloisian technique appears occa- sionally, and side-scrapers of various Middle Palaeolithic forms are represented in considerable numbers. Upper Palaeolithic types are represented primarily by end- scrapers, some with dorsal surface retouch; high end- scrapers (carenoids) even make an appearance. Burins are always few and are usually represented by quite simple types. Some sites also contain massive bores. The shape of leaf-points is very variable (double-pointed with circular or straight base). In surface treatment, every transitional type can be found, from unifacial retouch to a fine retouch of both surfaces. I do not consider it useful to establish local facies with names based on the varying form of leaf-points (Vertes 1958, Kozlowski 1961, 1965). The local groups of the Szeletian complex may have undergone various specific processes of evolution, but they are united by the common characteristics just mentioned. Of the numerous well-known sites of this group, the following should be mentioned here in addifion to the Szeleta cave: thejankovich, Balla, and Puskaporos caves, in Hungary; the open sites of Moravany-Dlha and Vlckovce and the Certova pec cave (stratigraphically situated in the Interstadial, 38,320-2,480 B.P.), in Slo- vakia; the Podhradem cave (stratigraphically situated in the middle of the Interstadial (Valoch 1965b) and the surface finds of Ondratice, Neslovice, Orechov I, II, Jezeirany I, II, and Modrice, in Moravia; the open site Dzierzyslaw, in southern Poland; the caves La Adam (stratigraphically in the Interstadial, Dumitrescu et al. 1963) and Spurcata, as well as the open site ofJosasel, in Rumania, and the caves of Samuilica II and V. Levski, in Bulgaria. Another important site is Lovas on Lake Balaton in Hungary, where a paint mine was found to contain a number of grave tools made of stag antlers (Meszaros and Vertes 1955). There are so far the only bone tools of the Szeletian. The development of the Szeletian is still un- known, but there are signs that it survived until the Stillfried B oscillation (at Rozdrojovice, Moravia). A facies of the Central European leaf-points group designated as the Jerzmanowice occurs in layers 4-6 of the Nietoperzowa cave near Jerzmanowice in southern Poland. The technique used here is of special interest: the points which have only partial surface retouch are mostly made from blades. The lowest of the three layers (6), from a cold moist period, has been dated at 38,160 ? 1,250 B.P. (Chmielewski 1965a, Kozlowski 1965). Typological ana- logies with this industry can be found in the second layer of the Ilsen cave near Ranis in Middle Germany, in some artifacts of the Szeletian of Ondratice, Moravia, and in the Aurignacian of the Vogelherd cave in southern Germany-(Muller-Beck 1965). The western part of Central Europe has an industry called the Praesolutrean (Freund 1952) which corre- sponds to the Szeletian and occurs in the same Middle Wurm Interstadial Podhradem (proved stratigraphically in the Weinberg caves near Mauern [Zotz 1955] and in the Ilsen cave near Ranis) . As in the Szeletian, Mousteroid types predominate, but in contrast to it there is here a lack of Upper Palaeolithic types. The leaf-points are 358 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="9">Valoch: PALAEOLITHIC IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE double-pointed, almost as a rule, and they attain con- siderable size because of the high quality of the raw- material. Since the presence of new types was criterial for the assignment of the Szeletian to the Upper Palaeolithic, it is questionable whether the Praesolutrean should rather not be considered as a late Middle Palaeolithic containing leaf-points. Both Zotz and Freund do this, even though the Praesolutrean is contemporary with the rise of the Upper Palaeolithic. (Incidentally, the name "Praesolu- trean" becomes misleading under these circumstances.) An important group of the early Upper Palaeolithic of Central Europe is the Aurignacian, which can be divided on a typological basis into four stages, at least in the eastern part of the area. The stone industry corresponds essentially to that of the French Aurignacian: the lower stage contains largely end-scrapers (carenoid forms), whereas the middle stage shows an increasing number of burins, and the upper and late stages contain more burins than end-scrapers. Among the burins, the proportion of arched burins (burins busque's) increases gradually, reach- ing its climax in the upper stage and then declining very sharply as well as degenerating morphologically. There is a relatively large number of archaic, Mousteroid types (such as side-scrapers and points), sometimes as much as 25% in the lower stage. The lower stage is represented by Malomerice-Obciny and Kirepice in Moravia and by Barca II in eastern Slovakia; the middle stage by Willen- dorf II/2-4 and Getzersdorf (and Krems-Hundssteig?) in Lower Austria, Stra6nska' skala and Podstransk6a in Mora- via, and Kechnec I in eastern Slovakia; the upper stage byMalomrnice-Borky II and Tvaroznain Moravia, Gross- weikersdorf in Lower Austria; and the late stage by Langmannersdorf in Lower Austria and Tibava in eastern Slovakia. The only bone implements known are the awls and two points of the Mladec (Lautsch) type from Willen- dorf II, layer 4. Willendorf II has also provided a secure basis for the dating of the Aurignacian. Layer 4 has been dated at 31,840 ? 250 B.P., which accords with its strati- graphical position between the Middle Wiirm Interstadial and the following stadial (Felgenhauer 1959a). We can thus presume that the lower stage existed during the Podhradem and that the late stage may possibly have survived into the Stillfried B. Another Upper Palaeolithic group is the Olschewian, established by Bayer (1929). The Olschewian consists largely of the Mladec-type bone-points (pointes losangique aplaties and pointes a section ovale), usually accompanied by a scanty and not very typical industry (e.g., at the Potocka cave in northern Yugoslavia). The occurrence of such sites is confined to caves, very often high in the mountains (see map in Vertes 1955a). More recent excavations in North Yugoslavia (the cave Mokriska jama) have shown that pointes a basefendue can also occur with Mladec-type points. On the basis of this discovery, Brodar (1960) would in- corporate the important finds from the Istallosko cave, Hungary, into the Olschewian. Vertes (1955a, b) has distinguished two layers with numerous bone-points at the latter site, the lower with pointes a base fendue and the upper with points of Mladec-type and has designated them as Aurignacian I and Aurignacian II/Olschewian. On the basis of the results of the Yugoslav excavations, however, it is possible to combine the two layers in one culture group and to consider the Istallosko cave to be the richest and most important Olschewian site. The upper layer of the Ista6llosko cave has been dated at 30,710 ? 600 B.P. and for the Podhradem cave in Moravia at 33,300 ? 1100 (GrN 848). During the Middle Wiirm Interstadial, then, there existed in the east of Central Europe a keeled scraper/ arched burin-group of the Aurignacian and a bone-point group of the Olschewian in addition to the leaf-point group of the Szeletian (cf. Narr 1963). The relationships between these groups are unknown, but the Aurignacian and the Olschewian were probably closely related. There is no evidence at present for the hypothesis that the Olschewian sites were simply the camp sites of the Aurignacian hunters. It does seem, however, that within a short period of time fusion of the two type groups took place; this is perhaps substantiated by evidence from Willendorf II/4. The result of such fusion would be a classic Aurignacian with bone-points predominating. The distribution of the two civilizations in Central Europe is not quite the same. The Olschewian, which populated the caves, covers a large territory from the caves of Mladec (North Moravia) and Mamutowa (South Poland) in the north, southeast across the Eastern Car- pathians (Haligovce in eastern Slovakia and Baia de Fier in Rumania) to the Balkans (Morowitza and Bacho-Kiro in Bulgaria), across Yugoslavia (Potocka, Mokriskajama, Lokve near Trieste) and the Alps (Badel and Tischofer caves) to the upper Danube (Bockstein) and as far as the western German Lahntal (Wildhaus). The occurrence of the Aurignacian is less well known. Typical industries have in fact been provided solely by the above-mentioned open sites of the Moravian, Lower Austrian and eastern Slovakian regions, associated with some of the sites in southern Poland (such as Pulawy on the middle Vistula, Piekary II, and Sowiniec near Krak6w). New investiga- tions at Boine?ti and Ceahlau in Rumania have uncovered quite a rich Aurignacian from what Nicolaescu-Plopaor (1962) and Bitiri (1964) judge to be the Middle Wiirm Interstadial. A typological comparison with the Aurig- nacian of Central Europe is, however, not yet likely to be carried out. In the western part of Central Europe, too, the Aurig- nacian is quite rare. In Middle Germanv, only Breiten- bach can be included in it. In southern Germany, there are some artifacts from the Fischleiten cave and some from the Hohler Stein cave near Happurg. A special and important position within the framework of the Aurig- nacian of western Central Europe is occupied by layers 4 and 5 from the Vogelherd, South Germany (Riek 1934). The industries designated as Middle and Upper Aurig- nacian by Riek were recently studied statistically by de Sonneville-Bordes (1965). This study demonstrated their Aurignacoid character, on the one hand; on the other, it showed fairly great differences between these industries and the French Aurignacian (e.g. the small number of keeled scrapers-which are not very typical in any case- the lack of arched burins [burins-busques], the large number of burins with end-retouch, and the many arti- facts retouched bilaterally). Even the above-described Aurignacian of the eastern part of Central Europe has only a few typological correspondences with the Vogel- herd (cf. Valoch 1964). This favours a special position for the Vogelherd-Aurignacian, whose relationship to layer 3 Vol. 9 ;No. 5 December 1968 359</page><page sequence="10">of the Ilsen cave near Ranis, in Thuringia has already been reported by Zotz (1951). Muiller-Beck (1965) has attempted to prove typogenetic connections between the Vogelherd and the Jerzmanowice leaf-point industry. According to the morphology of the stone tools, Vogelherd 5 and 4 could probably be classified withJerzmanowice 4; this, however, would suppose a lesser age of the Vogelherd than has been suggested so far (the Middle Wurm Inter- stadial according to Riek); Muller-Beck places it in the upper part of the oscillation complex, thus perhaps in the Stillfried B, making its position correspond to the upper Aurignacian of France. We must still take into account other finds of the Vogelherd in addition to stone artifacts. From layer 5 came 14 typical pointes a base fendue, which are characteristic of the older Aurignacian of France and may have come from the Olschewian. Besides this, how- ever, this same layer produced fragments of points of ivory and roe-antler reminiscent of forms of the later Upper Palaeolithic. Bored pieces of ivory and animal figures came from both layers. Accepting Riek's earlier date, these works of art would have no analogies. The later date suggested by Muller-Beck would allow us to think of them contemporaneous with the Pavlovian of Moravia. Thus the finds of Vogelherd cannot be easily classified, for they contain elements of the Aurignacian, Jerzmano- wice, Olschewian, and Pavlovian in addition to being placed in a long span of time. Similar to this industry in some features are the finds of the Csoklovina cave and of the open site Szitabodza in Transylvania (Rumania). These were also once designated as Aurignacian and are represented by bilaterally retouched blade artifacts with- out the true types of Aurignacian. Stratigraphic co-respondences between the Eastern European sites and those of Central Europe have only recently been established. Rogac'eV, on the basis of his excavations at the multistratal site of Kostjenki on the Don, compared the stratigraphical positions of the various layers and drew conclusions as to the descendance of different industries (Rogacev 1953, 1957; Delporte 1.959a). At the same time, a thorough geological descrip- tion of the excavations was made (Lazukov 1957). Later geological studies of the Quaternary have included the Palaeolithic sites of the Dniestr region (Ivanova 1961) and of the Russian Plain (Velicko 1961). They suggest a connection between the beginning of the Upper Palaeo- lithic and the period of soil formation during the Middle Wurm Interstadial Podhradem in Eastern Europe. Of great importance, however, is the fact that the evidence from the Kostjenki area argues quite convincingly for the co-existence of various groups of industries. The excava- tions in that area contain a striking horizon of double humus soil divided in some places by a layer of volcanic ash. Rogacev has determined that these fossil soils contain different industries throughout a distance of ca. 4 km. along the right bank of the Don. There are already more than 20 important sites known there, some of them quite close one to another. As in Central Europe, there is here a leaf-point industry in the lower zone of humus, but it differs from the Szeletian. Its typological nature can best be seen in the finds from layer 5 of Kostjenki I (there the deepest layers have so far been excavated only in small areas, so the number of finds is relatively small). Numerically pre- dominant are end-scrapers on short, flat, or fairly thick flakes with retouched length edges and their ventral surface fashioned. Burins occur seldom and only in quite simple diedre-forms. Borers and esquille's are also repre- sented here. Mousteroid side-scrapers and points form the archaic part. The thin leaf-points finely worked on both sides occur both in the form of triangular points with concave base and in double-pointed and irregular forms. At Streleckaja II, a similar industry comes from the same zone of humus (Rogacev 1957). Bader (1965a) has uncovered some surprising finds in Sungir, near Vladimir (about 200 km. northeast of Moscow). In addition to the triangular leaf-points with concave base just described, there are end- and side- scrapers, rarely simple burins, fairly many esquilles, and isolated retouched blade points. This stone industry, al- ready known from Kostjenki 1/5 and Streleckaja, is here accompanied by objects of bone, jewelry, and art objects. There is a fragment of an artifact reminiscent of a Mladec point made of mammoth ivory, and there is a polishing tool made of roe-antler and one made of bone (unpub- lished; autoptically examined). The jewelry is made of bored pieces of bone, fox teeth, and flat pebbles. Most important is the figure of a horse, 5-6 cm. long and a maximum of 4 mm. thick, made of bone, decorated on both sides and bored through the hind legs in order to be hung (Bader in Abramova 1962). According to a repor-t by Boriskovskij (1965), the 1964 excavations produced skeletal remains of two men in addition to some richly ornamented pieces of art and decoration. The section of Sungir contains two fossil soils like those of Kostjenki, but here the culture layer is in the upper soil. However, the C14 dates of 16,200 ? 400 B.P. for the soil and 14,600 - 600 B.P. for the culture layer (Serebrjannyj 1965) are in con- tradiction with the geological dating of the soil to the Podhradem period. According to geological dating, the art works of Sungir would be the oldest in Eastern Europe and the only ones so far from the leaf-point civilization of Central and Eastern Europe. The morphological simi- larity between the horse of Sungir and that of Vogelherd layer 5 is obvious. In both cases, a later data for the appearance of a developed art would be more intelligible. It might well be possible, following a proposal made at the 1963 symposium, to term this leaf-point industry the Streleckaja-Sungir type. To this type might also belong the third layer of the lower soil of Kostjenki XII-Volkov- skaja as well as the considerably younger third layer of Anosovka II (Kostjenki XI). An essentially different industry was found by Boris- kovskij (1963) in the same lower soil (according to Velicko) in Kostjenki XVII-Spicyna. It is an Upper Palaeolithic industry without archaic elements and with- out leaf-points, with the burin by far predominating (160 pieces). Blade scrapers are to be found in considerably smaller numbers (22 pieces). There are some blade-points, slightly retouched, and a few bigger blades and cores. Bone implements are represented only by two awls and some unidentifiable fragments; decorative objects are represented by bored fox teeth, belemnites, pieces of shell, and pebbles (Boriskovskij 1963). The upper soil contains various complexes of finds which can be divided typologically into perhaps 2-3 groups. The richest and most interesting is the second layer of Telmanskaja: in addition to 5 end-scrapers, there 360 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="11">Valoch: PALAEOLITHIC IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE were 70 burins, 17 notched and dentate blades, and about 350 fine tools. Among the latter, tools of the micro- gravette type predominated, often showing partial ventro- basilar or ventroterminal retouch; also represented by a few pieces each were trapezoid, triangular (notched point- like ?), and rectangular forms and lamelles tronque'es. There are only a few fragments of bone tools. In terms of the ratio of end-scrapers to burins and the absence of esquille's, this industry resembles that of Spicyna, but the micro- gravettes are a completely new element. The second group is distinguished by the absence of burins and the occurrence of esquille's and of archaic types. About 200 end-scrapers were found in Markina Gora (Kostjenki XIV), layer 2, along with some esquille's, fairly many ancient side-scrapers, points fashioned of fine quartzite, and some retouched blades. Gorodcovskaja (Kostjenki XV) provided 85 end-scrapers, 8 atypical burins, 108 esquilles, 14 archaic implements, and 6 blade- points. Kostenjki XII, Point B, produced 12 end-scrapers, 17 esquilles, 11 archaic forms, 3 burins, and some retouched blades. Also of importance is the accompanying bone industry: Markina Gora has some carved and ornamented artifacts; Gorodcovskaja has two shovel-shaped tools made of mammoth bones, analogous to a piece found in the same upper humus zone in an isolated shaft at the site of Kostjenki XII. Two pieces of roe-antler with their ends sharpened were found, as well as some awls, points, and needles, three of which had eyes. Decorative pieces were represented by bored fox teeth. The third group consists of two sets of finds distinguished by similar bone artifacts, but thus far poor in stone tools. Markina Gora, layer 3, and Telmanskaja, layer 3, pro- duced long stick points made of tusk, with round cross- section and a unilaterally cut carved base. At Gorod- covskaja and Markina Gora, layer 3, human skeletal remains were also found (Rogacev 1957). An insight into the typological situation of the early Upper Palaeolithic is offered also by the multistratal site of Molodova V on the Dniestr. Here again, two fossil soils appear. The Upper Palaeolithic appears only in the upper soil, but there are four Mousterian horizons in the sedi- ments underlying the fossil soils. Cernys (1961) discerned two find horizons, 10 and 9, in the upper soil; unfor- tunately, however, both these horizons provided only relatively few implements in contrast to a rather large amount of waste material (see Table 2).

As we have already mentioned, the C14 date for the second but uppermost Mousterian layer under both the soils is about 40,300 years. The find layer 7, located in a slightly humus sediment, has been dated to 23,700 ? 320 B.P. (Ivanova 1965). This date is a bit lower than the dates for the Late Wuirm Stillfried B oscillation in Central Europe, and the question arises whether the humus formation represents this oscilla- tion, or another climate fluctuation. In any case, the two soils of Molodova are presumably incomparable with the double soil complex of Kostjenki, as the lower zone of humus there already contains an Upper Palaeolithic. The habitation discovered near Radomysl a few years ago is also of importance for the typology of the early Upper Palaeolithic in Ukrainia. According to Sovkopljas (1 965a), the culture layer, containing numerous mam- moth bones, is not datable stratigraphically. The stone industry consists of burins of the diedre-type, blade- scrapers, retouched blades, massive borers, and numerous Mousteroid side-scrapers and points. It can be seen that the beginning of the Upper Palaeo- lithic in eastern Europe is as complicated as it is in Central Europe and at the same time distinct from it. The early Upper Palaeolithic industries can be divided into numer- ous typologically different groups; although these groups cannot yet be strictly defined, the simultaneous appear- ance of an archaic industry with leaf-points (the Streleck- aja-Sungir type) and a progressive burin industry without archaic forms (the Spicyna type) would seem to be of essential significance. Velicko's (1961) attempt, by geological stratigraphic comparison of the later loesses of the Desna area with those of Czechoslovakia, to establish a chronological re- lationship between the Eastern and the Central European Upper Palaeolithic has been called into question by newly published radiocarbon dates. The lower soil of Sungir has been dated at 20,540 ? 120 B.P.; the two humus zones of Kostjenki XVIII-Spicyna provided almost the same date, 20,100 ? 350 B.P. for the upper soil, 20,100 ? 100 B.P. for the lower soil. In contrast, the upper soil of Kostjenki XII- Volkovskaja was dated at 23,060 ? 300 B.P. and the same upper zone at Markina Gora (Kostjenki XIV) at only 14,300 ? 460 B.P. Layer 10 of Molodova V, which lies in the middle of a soil, has been dated at 23,100 ? 400 B.P. (O,erdyncev et al. 1965). Allowing for some unreliability in the samples (samples of humus were measured every- where except at Markina Gora where bones were dated), it is still striking that the dates from various sites, all indicating a warmth oscillation, center around 20,000- 23,000 years, and that none of them is as early as the- Central European Stillfried B or even the Podhradem. On the other hand, there is no stratigraphic evidence in Central Europe for a warmth oscillation between the Stillfried B and the Late Glacial (B6lling, Allerod). Is an early Upper Palaeolithic corresponding chronologically- to those of Central and Western Europe perhaps absent in Eastern Europe? In the course of the further development of the Upper^ Palaeolithic in the East European lowland, represented stratigraphically by culture layers above the double- humus zones in the Kostjenki area, we can presumeb Vol. 9 No. 5- December 1968 361</page><page sequence="12">internal differentiation of the original groups, influenced strongly by the relations among them. Thus the upper layer of Telmanskaja offers us a leaf-point industry with numerous burins and archaic forms (Efimenko and Boris- kovskij 1957), and the upper layer of Kostjenki IV- AJeksandrovka provides isolated, but well-formed leaf- points accompanied by numerous micro-points, burins- cum-end-scrapers, and burins-cum-points. The lower layer of Aleksandrovka, in contrast, is distinguished by many genuine gravettes, backed penknives, saws (den- tate), esquillis, and a few burins and end-scrapers (Roga- cev 1955). In Kostjenki II, Zamjatnina was found, in addition to human skeletal remains, a possibly relatively late industry in which esquilles and burins, mostly diedre- form, predominate. End-scrapers, retouched blade- points, and backed penknives are represented only by a few pieces (Boriskovskij 1963.) The best-known industry of this area is that which comes from the uppermost layer of Kostjenki I-Poljakova and which is often termed the "Kostjenkian" proper. It is characterized by burins of various forms, often double or combined with end-scrapers, blades with ventroterminal flatly retouched notch, notched points, and blade-points showing partial ventral-surface fashioning. Backed pen- knives are quite rare; other small forms are missing. From this set of finds also come interesting bone implements, decorated objects, animal figures, and the famous repre- sentations of women (Efimenko 1958). The habitation of -Gagarino, also situated on the Don, provided an industry only slightly different, with burins predominating, end- scrapers declining, notched points in small forms only, and ventroterminal notched blades absent; on the other hand, numerous backed penknives appear. Figures of women corresponding to those of Kostjenki I were also found (Tarasov 1965). An independent group of sites between the Dniestr and the Don is formed by sites in the region of the Middle Dniepr and its tributaries, of which the Desna is the most important. On it lie Puskari I and Pogon, which can both be considered part of the stratigraphically older complex, according to Velicko (196 1). The much richer set of finds of Puskari I, to which that of Pogon perhaps corresponds, consists of 160 burins, 250 end-scrapers, 200 backed pen- knives, about 20 not very typical notched points, and 550 points, of which 280 are retouched bilaterally, 100 are terminal-obliquely retouched (truncated), and 170 have one side blunted (a' dos abattu), often arch-shaped. Among the latter, gravette-like forms and forms remini- scent of Chatelperron points can be found. Bone tools -were represented by hoe-liked used ribs (Boriskovskij 1953). At Avdejevo on the Sejm were excavated a rich bone industry, ornamented objects as well as two representa- tions of women, and a stone inventory in which pieces esquilles predominate, burins are quite numerous, and backed penknives, notched points, end-scrapers, and various blade-points are represented (Gvozdover 1950). Other industries to be found in this area (e.g., Mezin, Eliseevici, Timonovka, Kiev-Kyril Street), some without notched points or gravettes or backed penknives, all sug- gest the existence of still other typologically differing groups. The bone implements and works of art, however, are very much alike, and diffierent from their counterparts in Western Europe, and they provide the basis for the idea of a unified "East-Gravettian" which included the whole Eastern Upper Palaeolithic. In one of the few caves with numerous Upper Palaeo- lithic layers, Sjuren I in the Crimea, were three horizons in an interesting sequence. In the lower layer were found a number of variously retouched micro-blades, along with bladed end-scrapers, burins, and points, some of them ecaille's and Mousteroid forms. The inventory of the middle layer does not differ essentially; the ecaille's have dis- appeared, the number of micro-blades has decreased sharply, and the Mousteroid forms remain. Among the end-scrapers in both layers many Aurignacoid types are to be found. In the upper layer retouched and blunted micro-blades again predominate, Aurignacoid end-scra- pers become quite rare, and the archaic forms disappear; notched blades, gravette points, and fragmentary artifacts resembling Azilian points appearfor the first time. Theage of the habitations is unknown. The author assumes that these industries, which have analogies in the Caucasus, represent an evolution on the spot (Vekilova 1957). Inany case it is important that here fine implements made from micro-blades make their appearance in the lower layer. The Upper Palaeolithic on the Dniestr provides the picture of a rather quiet, continuous evolution, as far as it is possible to judge from the publications of Cernys on the multistratal site of Molodova V and on Babin, Vorono- vica, and others. Layer 8 of Molodova V contains essen- tially the same types as the deeper horizons. Considering layer 7, dated by radiocarbon at about 24,000 years, we must add various forms of micro-points, sticks with holes, Lyngby axe-like implements of roe-antler, and bored and sharpened pieces of soft stone. These finds resemble the Moravian finds of Dolni Vestonice, Pavlov, and Pired- mosti so much that they must be considered closely related. In layers 6-1, dated from 17,000-10,000 years (for exact C14 dates, see Ivanova 1965) the strongly re- touched points disappear, micro-points become rare, a few backed penknives can be added, and the rest of the inventory, consisting of burins and end-scrapers, becomes gradually smaller and finer. In the fauna the reindeer dominates, and antler is used to make a few tools (Oernys 1961). We can hardly doubt that the stone industry of all ten layers of Molodova V underwent a continuous develop- ment. In layer 7, a considerable flourishing of antler fashioning and of the carving of soft stone can be observed. The radiocarbon dates confirm the typogenetically based hypothesis that the Upper Palaeolithic of Eastern Europe reached its full development without having been influ- enced by the Magdalenian. The only Magdalenian tool type, namely the holestick, appears here as early as about 24,000 years B.P. Although the technology of splitting roe- antler is similar to that of the Magdalenian, the leading forms of the Magdalenian-borers, numerous penknives, and spear-heads with a gutter for blood-are completely absent here except for the borers found at Mezin (Sov- kopljas 1965b). In Rumania an evolution of the "East-Giavettian" also took place. Nicolaescu-Plopsor (1962) divides it into three stages, in the course of which there is a gradual trend toward microlithic forms. The most important type is the gravette-point, e.g., those at Ceahlau-Dirtu. More exact knowledge of types is to be expected from the extensive excavations taking place there. Like the multi- 362 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="13">Valoch: PALAEOLITHIC IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE stratal site of Molodova V, the four layers of the cave of Stanca Ripiceni, on the right bank of the Prut, give the impression of an evolution of a single group of industries. Layer 1 contains some thick Aurignacoid end-scrapers, numerous bladed end-scrapers, and a number of double angle-burins on concavely retouched blades, but on the whole a relationship with the Eastern Upper Palaeolithic is indicated. There are still several massive end-scrapers in the succeeding layer 3, yet narrow blades with blunted back surface as well as fashioned pieces of antler already make their appearance. Characteristic of layer 5 are, in addition to end-scrapers, strongly retouched bilaterally, and some blade-points, the increasing number of burins and especially two pieces of roe-antler fashioned in the manner of the Lyngby-axes of Molodova V, layer 7. Layer 7 contains an increased number of penknives and gravette-like points, corresponding to the upper layers of Molodova V (Moro?an 1938). The later Upper Palaeolithic of Central Europe in- cludes two large civilization groups: the Pavlovian (for- merly East Gravettian) and the Magdalenian. The Pav- lovian is known especially from sites in Moravia (Pried- mosti, Dolni Vestonice, Pavlov, Petrkovice), Lower Austria (Willendorf II, layers 5-9, Agssbach, Kamegg), and western Slovakia (Moravany-Podkovica, Moravany- Zakovska). The stone industry consists of numerous end- scrapers, burins, penknives, gravette-points; notched points (at Willendorf, Moravany, Petrkovice, Predmosti), micro-saws (at Dolni Vestonice), and small geometric forms (at Pavlov) also occur. The rich bone industry has some unusual forms: long ivory points of round cross- section, shovel-like implements made of big fragments of mammoth bone, many polished ribs, cylindrical rubbers of ivory, and numerous awls. The picture is completed by decorative and art works of perfect form: necklaces of fossil shells, animal teeth, and pebbles; pieces of bone and ivory ornamented with short lines; figures of women (at Dolni Vestonice, Petrkovice, Pavlov, Moravany, Willen- dorf) and of animals (at Dolni Vestonice, Pavlov, Pired- mosti); and exceptionally, a figure of a man (Brno II) and an engraving of a woman (Predmosti). Dolni Ves- tonice has provided, for the first time in the Palaeolithic, fired clay figures (women, animals). This advanced group, with undoubtedly close relations to the East European Upper Palaeolithic, was termed Pavlovian by Delporte (1959b) and by Klima (1963); it is dated back into the Stillfried B and the beginning of the succeeding loess period, some time between 28,000 and 24,000 years B.P. A late phase of this Pavlovian group of Central Europe has been found at Saigvair and Arka, in Hungary and dated at the end of the Upper Wiirm, between 19,000 and 13,000 years B.P. (Kretzoi and Vertes 1965b). Kozlowski (1965) has recently attempted a territorial and facial division of the "Gravettian" of Central and Eastern Europe by means of statistical indices. An essen- tially statistical treatment of all the well-studied Palaeo- lithic finds would be highly desirable and would, when combined with the corresponding list of types, serve as a useful basis for more general conclusions. Kozlowski has raised a new and very interesting problem for Central Europe by presuming an evolution in this area similar to that of the French Upper Palaeolithic, and by classing some of the complexes of finds (such as Jenerailka and Lubna in Bohemia, Stanca Ripiceni, layer 5, and Mobo- dova V, layer 9) with the Protomagdalenian (analogous with layer 4 of the Laugerie Haute and Abri Pataud). Disregarding the more general problems connected with the Protomagdalenian, I would like to point out that the above-mentioned layer of Stanca Ripiceni cannot be so interpreted because of its antler artifacts, which are con- sidered peculiar to the Pavlovian. It is remarkable that the Pavlovian civilization, so strongly represented in this area, barely extends to the western part of Central Europe. The only significant site here is the Weinberg caves near Mauern, in Bavaria, where a female statuette of limestone was also found (Zotz 1955). If the very simple industry of Mainz- Linsenberg, with fragments of three female figures, be- longs to the same group, then this would be its western- most appearance. Remarkably, though, some suggestions of the French Perigordian can be found in this western part of Central Europe. Quite isolated in Middle Germany (Ilsen cave near Ranis, layer 4), an industry appears showing typical Chatelperron points with no analogy at all in (except perhaps Puskari I?) the East. Typogenetically, this in- dustry can only be a descendant of the Chatelperronian of France. Zotz has also recently reported the single find of a double-notched point of the Font-Robert type in Dollnstein, Bavaria (Freund 1963), another type with no analogies in the East. The second large Upper Palaeolithic group of Central Europe is the Magdalenian, which is unequivocally of Western origin and whose eastern limits are marked by the caves of the Moravian Karst (Pekarna), of Lower Austria (Gudenushohle), and of southern Poland (Mas- zycka). The stone industry shows, in addition to the common end-scrapers, burins, backed penknives, and characteristic long borers, specialized forms such as Kent- type knives with broken backs (at Etzdorf in Thuringia, Burkhardtshohle in Wuirttemberg, Eilsbrunnh6hle in Bavaria, and Zitny cave in Moravia), arched knives (at Burkhardtshohle and Probstfels in Wiirttemberg), and burins with a deep notch on their left sides (at Olknitz in Thuringia, Pekafrna and Borky I in Moravia), which possibly indicate the existence of different facies. In con- trast to the ivory and mammoth bone of the Pavlovian, in the Magdalenian it is roe-antler that serves as the raw material for bone implements-spear-heads of oval to edged cross-section with a gutter for blood, hole-sticks, harpoons, and needles with eyes. Art is first of all repre- sented by engravings of animals (at Pekarna in Moravia, Kniegrotte in Thuringia, Mittlere Klause in Bavaria, and Petersfels in Baden) manufactured in the Franko-Canta- brian style. Bored and ornamented rings of bone (at Petersfels in Baden and Kri'z-cave in Moravia) also have numerous analogies in France. A specific way of represen- tation of women is found in the figurines of Petersfels (Baden), Olknitz and Nebra (Central Germany), and Pekairna (Moravia), and also in the engravings of Hohlen- stein (Bavaria), as well as of La Roche, Fontales, and La Gare de Couze (France). Another independent, but closely related, group is the Hamburgian, discovered by Rust (1937) in Meiendorf and limited to North Germany. The stone industry, with characteristic Zinken and notched points, is accompanied Vol. 9 -No. 5 December 1968 363</page><page sequence="14">by numerous implements made of roe-antler, of which one harpoon and the so-called strap-cutters deserve men- tion. Carvings of animal heads in amber and sandstone resemble those of the Magdalenian. Surveying the Upper Palaeolithic of Central and East- ern Europe, we may observe first of all that the typological differentiation of regional groups which began in the Middle Palaeolithic has increased in intensity. Only the Szeletian can be typogenetically assigned to the Middle Palaeolithic with any certainty; the Praesolutrean, con- temporary with the Szelatian, still has a decidedly Middle Palaeolithic character. The concentration of the Aurig- nacian in the eastern part of Central Europe and its com- plete absence in Eastern Europe seems to testify to a source in the inner Carpathian region. I have suggested elsewhere that the industry designated as the Tayacian, Fontechevade facies, would probably be that source (Valoch 1966). The Olschewian insofar as it can be con- sidered an independent civilization at all, is certainly akin to the Aurignacian, as is indicated, among other things, by their concentration in the same region. One might imagine that the typologically advanced Aurignacian + Olschewian influenced the more primitive contem- porary Mousterian and that this contact resulted in the Szeletian, a Middle Palaeolithic industry enriched with Upper Palaeolithic forms. This would also explain why a pure unmodified Middle Palaeolithic with leaf-points (the Praesolutrean) is maintained in southern Germany, where the pre- or early stages of the Aurignacian seem to be missing. The Szeletian appears to survive fairly long in Central Europe, as late as about the time of the Stillfried B, and it gradually incorporates more and more influences from the rest of the Upper Palaeolithic. The Aurignacian and A Al FIG. 6. Upper Palaeolithic. =-Leaf-point Industries Aurignacian + Olschewian Eastern Gravettian Complex \\\\\\\\Magdaleniari ...Hamburgian wUpper Palaeolithic from the. Crimea, Urals, and Caucasus *Rock-paintings from Kapova Cave in Urals Olschewian, at first quite distinct, eventually merge, occurring in France as the Aurignacian with bone-points predominant. On the other hand, there are isolated in- fluences of the western Perigordian in Germany. Similarly, in Eastern Europe the leaf-point industries of Streleckaia-Sungir can be associated with the Middle Palaeolithic with leaf-forms of that area; the latter may also have originated under the influence of an advanced Upper Palaeolithic industry. The origin of the earliest blade industry of the Spicyna type (Kostjenki XVII) is obscure, but the following possibility might be considered: In the eastern part of the Mediterranean, there is a com- plex of finds, stratigraphically in the middle of the Middle Palaeolithic industries, called the "Praeaurignacian." While studying the finds of Yabrud at the University of Cologne, I became convinced that we have here a true blade industry more progressive than the early Aurig- nacian of Central Europe, containing many flakes and Mousteroid forms, but at the same time lacking true keeled-scrapers, the minimum precondition for classifica- tion with the Aurignacian. A connection between this "Praeaurignacian" and the typical Aurignacian is hardly presumable, but the retouched blades and blade-points would permit further evolution to such an industry as the Spicyna type. In the course of further evolution, numerous typo- logically different groups of industries were established throughout the vast territory of the East-European Plain. They existed at the same time and influenced one another. The habitations known from many sites (huts, tents?) witness to a certain stability of settlements. In contrast to the area of Kostjenki on the Don, where a sequence of different industries is observable, there seems to be an essentially undisturbed evolution of a single group in Molodova on the Dniestr. The origin of the cultural stream called "East Gravet- tian," which flourished in the form of the Pavlovian in the eastern part of Central Europe, must be sought in this developed Eastern European Upper Palaeolithic. This civilization, penetrating from the east, may have followed the Aurignacian as it moved gradually westward and eventually met with the surviving remains of the archaic Szeletian during the Middle Wiirm Stadial. By the end of the Upper Wiirm, the Magdalenian had reached the eastern edge of Central Europe from the west. The regional groups pertaining to the "East Gravettian" de- veloped farther to the southeast, beginning with Hungary and Slovakia (Valoch 1960). THE LATE PALAEOLITHIC Only in the last 20 years have we begun to accumulate some knowledge of the industries which preceded the Mesolithic, falling into the late phases of the Wiirm Glacial and constituting the typological link between the Upper Palaeolithic and the Mesolithic. These industries are frequently denoted as the Epipaleolithic, but I prefer the term Late Palaeolithic, following the usage in Polish research dealing intensively with these questions. They cover a period of only about 3,000 years; Schild (1964) considers the lower limit to be about the middle of the Allerod (the time of the French Azilian) . 364 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="15">Schwabedissen (1964) provided the first survey of the Late Palaeolithic industries from northern Germany (which he called the "Federmessergruppe"), the charac- teristic type of which is a small knife with arched blunted back. The stages of Ahrensburg, Callenhardt, and Born- wisch (Rust 1951), all confined to North Germany and the adjacent regions, also belong here. Schild (1960, 1964) has intensively studied the very rich Late Palaeolithic of Poland and has distinguished several groups of industries there. He has also pointed out the typological significance of one of its most important elements the occurrence in great numbers of short flake end-scrapers. He discerns two great cycles of industries (or civilizations): (a) the cycle of Mazowsze, charac- terized by double-notched points with ventrobasal surface retouch of the Swidry type and divided into numerous typologically differing industries (Swidry, Dobiegniewo, Pludy types, etc.); and (b) the as yet little-known cycle containing industries of the Tarno6w and Witow types. The absolute age of the industry of Witow comes to 10,815 ? 160 years. Similar finds have been reported from Moravia (Tis- nov, Bucovice) by Klima and Valoch, and the strati- graphical position of such an industry was obtained for the first time from the excavation in the Kulna cave in Czechoslovakia. In close sequence with the Magdalenian, there are two layers containing an industry preliminarily designated as the Epimagdalenian and accompanied by remains of red deer. It contains, in addition to some other types, a number of short flake end-scrapers. Vertes has reported a similar industry from Szekszaird-Palank, Hun- gary, dated at 10,350 ? 500 years (Kretzoi and Vertes 1965b). Rumania has already produced two groups of the Late Palaeolithic (Nicolaescu-Plopsor 1952, 1958), the one, with double-notched points, pertaining to the Ma- zovsze cycle (at Scaune-Ceahlau), and the other desig- nated as "Azilian" (at the Hotilor cave near Baile Her- culane). The gradual development of a Gravettoid in- dustry up to the Late Palaeolithic or even into the Mesolithic is demonstrated through the many layers of the rock-shelter Crevena Stijena in Yugoslavia (Brodar and Benac 1958). This stage can be completed with numerous industries, some of them surface finds from the Donaumoos and from around Futrth (Freund 1963), and possibly also an Epimagdalenian with the head burials of Kaufertsberg, upper layer, Stadel am Hohlenstein in the Lonetal, and Grosse Ofnet( ?), in South Germany. That the Upper Palaeolithic groups of the southern plain of the U.S.S.R. also developed into a Late Palaeo- lithic seems to be indicated by numerous finds (e.g., the upper layers of Vladimirovka on the Bug ((ernys 1953) Bolsaja Akkarza and Amvrosievka at the Asovian See, layer 2 of Anosovka II [Kostjenki XI], possibly Zuravka, Borsevo II, etc. (Efimenko 1955). The exact temporal, stratigraphical, and typological position of these com- plexes, however, is not clear. To the north (e.g., on Lake Cvitjaz, and at Krumplevo and Neman in Bielorussia), we find characterized by double-notched points and pos- sibly connected with the Mazowsze cycle. The differently arranged Upper Palaeolithic of the Crimea (Krajnov 1960) seems to have reached the phase of the Late Palaeo- lithic with its industries showing arched knives suggestive of Azilian points (in the upper layer of Sjuren I, the lower layer of Sjuren II, Layer 8 of Tas-Air, etc.). In the north- FIG. 7.

The recognition of this Late Palaeolithic as a definite phase of evolution is very important. On the one hand, it bridges the typological and genetic gap between the~ Upper Palaeolithic and the Mesolithic. On the other hand, it automatically reduces both the age and the duration of the Mesolithic, since its lower limit can only be the end of the Late Palaeolithic, estimated at about 6, 000 B.C. With regard to culture we are dealing here with a continued evolution of the Upper Palaeolithic civiliza- tion, as well as that of the "East Gravettian" (in the~ broadest sense of the word) and of the Magdalenian and its North-European facies. THE FINAL PALAEOLITHIC The discovery of the Late Palaeolithic has shown more clearly than ever that the "Middle Stone Age" is sensu stricto no proper Stone Age period, but only a final phase, possibly quite short, of the Old Stone Age. Further, the typological diffierence between the Mesolithic and the~ Upper Palaeolithic, not to mention the Late Palaeolithic, is much smaller than that between the Middle and the Upper Palaeolithic, where new achievements (e.g., art, living facilities, funerals) changed the entire cultural picture.

The reason for this is that, at least in the better-known Euro- pean area, the microlithic material always presents essen- tially the same, or at least very similar, forms, with the result that some decades ago it was held that a unified Tardenoisian spread almost over the whole of Europe (or, perhaps, the Azilio-Tardenoisian in the west and the Swiderio-Tardenoisian in the east). Only well-stratified complexes of finds together with an exact statistical treat- ment of the types will make clear the difference among the groups. Schwabedissen (1944) surveyed and divided the Final Palaeolithic of northwestern Germany, outlining in par- ticular the Nordic groups with core- and ring-axes (Lyngby, Duvensee, Oldesloe, Ertebolle) and the micro- lithic groups (Kirchdorf, Halten, Boberg, Hiilstein). Gramsch (1960) has presented a picture of the Final Palaeolithic of the Mark Brandenburg, and Schuldt (1961) has published the important results of excavations carried on in the Hohen Viecheln, Mecklenburgia, of a habitation with rich stone, bone, and wood industries. The Thuringian industries have been treated by Feustel (1961), and W. Taute and F. Naber are now working on the Final Palaeolithic of western and southern Germany. This means that we shall very soon have an outline of the Final Palaeolithic in the western and northwestern part of Central Europe. There are a number of unpublished complexes of finds in Czechoslovakia, especially in Bo- hemia; in Moravia the discovery of Smolin is just being reported; and an upper Final Palaeolithic has been dis- covered at Sered, in Slovakia. Austria and Hungary have so far been able to report but a few surface finds. The Final Palaeolithic of the countries of Southeastern Europe is as yet insufficiently examined. FIG. 8. Final Palaeolithic. \\\\\\\\Microlithic Industries M Macrolithic Industries ~_Bone Industries 4~//////ndustries with GravettianT4radition inal Palaeolithic from the Crimea ||||Double-notched-point Industries The very rich Final Palaeolithic of Poland has been rather intensively studied. Wieckowska (1964) and Wiec- kowska and Marczak (1965) have attempted a typological treatment as well as a division of the finds. It is interesting that no double-notched points are known from the Polish Final Palaeolithic, despite the fact that it presumably develops out of the Mazowsze cycle. The U.S.S.R. has a fairly rich Final Palaeolithic (Beregovaja 1960). Formozov (1 954) has pointed out that the northern belt, up to the Oka and the upper Volga, has a group with double-notched points which can be connected with the Late Palaeolithic in Poland (at Borki, Jelin Bor, Sknjatino). Still farther to the northeast, on the Kama, there is a Final Palaeolithic containing long narrow blades, as well as the corresponding cores, bladed end-scrapers, and angle-burins; both geometric forms and double-notched points are absent there (Bader 1960). On the other hand, on the Desna, there existed groups with relatively few geometrically arranged microliths, and with an accompanying industry inclining toward the Upper Palaeolithic. Of course, the question remains open whether, in particular cases, this is not a Late Palaeolithic instead (e.g., Smjacka XIV). The Crimean Final Palaeo- lithic is well known. It consists stratigraphically of several layers (Tas-Air, Sjuren II, Murzak Koba, San Koba, Fatma Koba); typologically, it is a development of the Late Palaeolithic.3 To sum up, the Final Palaeolithic of Central and Eastern Europe can be seen as follows: Groups of crude tools containing core- and ring-axes and connected with southern Scandinavia reach up to North Germany. The bone industry of the Kunda type, from the Maglemosean (Indreko 1948), dominates the countries of the Baltic. In all of Central Europe there is only one microlithic inven- tory without any double-notched points; since it will probably be possible to divide this inventory into several typologically different groups, it should not be designated as Tardenoisian. In Eastern Europe, there seem to be at least one group with double-notched points and another with a stronger Upper Palaeolithic tradition. The Crimea presents an evolution of its own from as early as the Upper Palaeolithic. CONCLUSION The cultural development of the Old Stone Age appears to us, on the basis of present knowledge, to have been on the whole continuous. The distribution of particular typological groups became more and more restricted over time; in the Early Palaeolithic, a group might cover much of a continent, but by the Final Palaeolithic we have only local facies confined to narrow areas, for example those within the microlith circle of Central Europe. Large ethnic migrations over an area of several hundreds of kilometres, as were suggested some years ago for the Perigordian (from Asia Minor to France) are no longer hypothesized. Where a "wandering" of certain typological and technological elements is traceable, we 3 I have been unable to take into account any of the work reported in Materialy i issledovania po archeologii SSSR, vol. 126 (1966), U istokov drevnich kultur, epocha mezolita, edited by N. N. Gurina. 366 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="17">Valoch: PALAEOLITHIC IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE would now rather suggest only a slow and gradual penetration. It remains completely uncertain to what extent such influences represent trade and borrowing of cultural riches and to what extent an invasion by another ethnic group is indicated. Such changes are observable in all phases of the Old Stone Age. We can see the penetration of hand-axes from France to the western and northern parts of Central Europe as early as the Early Palaeolithic. Hand-axes seem to have come also across the Caucasus from Asia Minor. In the Middle Palaeolithic, the Micoquian spread from its centre in South Germany to the north (Hessen) and northeast, along the Bohemian massif as far as South Poland, and from there southward into Moravia. Another centre of the Micoquian that has been suggested is far to the southeast, perhaps in the Crimea, from whence it spread northeast to the Volga (?) and northwest into the Ukraine. The question of the origin, development, and relation- ships of the leaf-points is of continuing interest. According to present knowledge, it can be supposed that the estab- lishment of morphologically genuine leaf points, as well as of numerous more primitive preform,s, took place in- dependently in various places in Europe as early as the early phases of the Middle Palaeolithic (during the Eem Interglacial). This tradition developed in several groups of industries, so that toward the decline of the Middle Palaeolithic there were pure Middle Palaeolithic indus- tries with leaf-points in some regions of Europe. I would like to assume that these industries, like the Szeletian, not only were evolving toward the Upper Palaeolithic, but were already absorbing influences from neighboring groups of Upper Palaeolithic character. Consequently, the leaf-point would have to be considered as an achieve- ment of the Middle Palaeolithic. The Upper Palaeolithic of Central Europe may have influenced the evolution of the Aurignacian of France. On the other hand, weak influences of the western Chatelperronian and the Font-Robert stage can be seen in Germany. The western origin of the Central European Magdalenian and of the Pavlovian of Eastern Europe can be considered certain. Whether the early blade industries of Eastern Europe are to be traced to the "Praeaurig- nacian" of the eastern Mediterranean must for the time being remain a hypothesis only. Relations between the South-European (Yugoslav) Upper Gravettian and cor- responding phenomena irn northern Italy, and perhaps even the Grimaldian, are as yet unknown, but not excluded. All three great civilizations (Perigordian, Pavlovian, Magdalenian) took part in the establishment of the Late Palaeolithic in Central and Northern Europe; in Eastern Europe, the Upper Palaeolithic of the various regions provided the basis for similar development. The Final Palaeolithic can be interpreted as essentially a continuous evolution of the preceding Late Palaeolithic. In the northern part of Central Europe, there is an invasion of the Nordic crude tools (core- and ring-axes), but they disappear rapidly as one proceeds southwards. The bone civilization on the Baltic surely goes back to Upper Palaeolithic traditions (Magdalenian?). The shifting of the double-notched point group from Poland to the upper Volga is likely to represent the most significant migration Some phenomena may be explained by convergence, of which the Middle Palaeolithic provides two good examples: (1) the existence of two widely separated Micoquian centres, and (2) independent appearance of the leaf-points in several regions of Europe. Were related groups of people concerned here ? Other widely separated convergent phenomena can be understood as a general trend of evolution. These are the principal characteristics of the individual stages: the habit of Early Palaeolithic man of chiseling his tools from whole stones (choppers, hand-axes); the establishment of strongly differentiated Middle Palaeolithic flake industries, preceded by the Early Palaeolithic Clactonian; the origin of blade indus- tries, bone implements, and art in the Upper Palaeolithic; and finally the development of microlithic forms in the Late and Final Palaeolithic. The different ethnic groups probably maintained con- tact, whether on friendly or unfriendly terms, in all the stages and thus preserved some mutual influence in cul- tural forms. The significance of the many statistically demonstrated facies of the Middle Palaeolithic, differing both typologically and technologically, remains obscure. The groups lived near one another in a small territory (the southwest of France) during a relatively short period of time (in the Lower Wiirm); only in isolated cases do they constitute successive stages. The survival of the typical Middle Palaeolithic Levalloisian technique in some of the Aurignacian industries in Moravia shows that the role of technology in the definition of industries is far from clear. Is it possible in such a case to infer a genetic relationship, or is this a case of convergence (or, possibly, something else) ? I have nowhere touched upon the question of the association ofdifferent civilizations with particular human types or groups, for this is a matter ofpalaeoanthropology. If, however, one considers cultural evolution to be depen- dent upon the evolution of mankind, then some con- sequences would follow from the above deductions: the various morphologically different sapiens forms must have originated in different regions; some progressive types of Palaeoanthropines were probably the bearers of those industries which later developed into the Upper Palaeolithic blade industries; other Palaeoanthropines, while they may have reached a relatively advanced state of evolution within the limits of their primitive characters, remained bearers of the surviving modified (e.g., Szele- tian) or even retarded (the Mousterian and Praesolutrean of the Middle Wurm Interstadial Podhradem and the beginning of the Middle Wurm Stadial) archaic indus- tries. It is very questionable, on the other hand, whether the numerous facies of the Mousterian complex, distin- guished only technologically, or the typologically different groups of the East European Upper Palaeolithic or of the microlithic Final Palaeolithic of Central Europe, for example, represented distinct ethnic groups. (Of course, these three examples cannot be considered as either identical or equivalent.) The end of the Old Stone Age in the area under con- sideration is still very obscure. As we have already men- tioned, the lower limit of the Final Palaeolithic was reduced by the incorporation of the Late Palaeolithic. On the other hand, the Central European Neolithic has Vol. 9- No. 5 December 1968 367</page><page sequence="18">been radiocarbon-dated as early as the fifth millennium B.C., making the duration of the pure Final Palaeolithic only some 3,000 years. The hypothesis is being offered ever more frequently, however, that while the farmers were penetrating from the southeast, groups of hunters, fishers, and collectors with a purely Final Palaeolithic civilization continued to live on the banks of lakes and rivers and were only assimilated in the course of time. Such a symbiosis of human groups with different economic bases can be presumed to have existed in the border zones of the advanced agricultural civilization radiating from the high cultures of the Near East. It would seem prob- able that the Final or Late Palaeolithic human groups of Southeastern Europe, closer to the cradle of agriculture, themselves participated in the formation of the farmer tribes which penetrated into the north, and that these latter in turn incorporated other groups. May this perhaps be the explanation for the absence (??) of a true Final Palaeolithic in Southeast Europe and the presence there of a potteryless Neolithic? The new civilizations may have spread eastward into the Ukrainian steppes in the same way, possibly with even greater participation of the Final or Late Palaeolithic human groups. This change probably took place much more simply in the northern wooded areas (see Brjusov 1952). No economic shift was concerned there, for hunting and fishing remained the bases of the economy even in the Neolithic. The transition was accomplished in external characters of civilization (pottery, whetted axes and hatchets, etc.) without altering either economic base or ethnic composition. Comments by EMMANUEL ANATI* Jerusalem, Israel, 28 ii 68 It was a pleasure to read this stimulating, well-written synthesis of a broad subject. Central and Eastern Europe is an area of the utmost importance for the under- standing of Old World prehistory and can well be considered in the context of general cultural evolution in the Eurasian continent. I shall confine myself to a few general comments. Central and Eastern Europe lie be- tween two of the world's richest areas in Palaeolithic finds: Western Europe and the Near East. Any ethnic movement and any transmission of cultural traits from Central Asia and the Near East to West- ern Europe and vice-versa were bound to pass through this area. Traces of such movements, however, have not yet been clearly identified. Lower Palaeolithic men and their cultures did not originate in Europe, and if, as it seems, Central and Eastern Europe was an area of transit and of active human contact, one is surprised by the paucity of finds there as compared with the wealth of artifacts known from Western Europe and from the Near East. Most of the classic Lower Palaeolithic sites in the Near East have provided hun- dreds and sometimes thousands of well- shaped and well-defined bifacial tools and flake artifacts; the same abundance is observed in Western Europe. Such wealth contrasts sharply with the general pattern of scantiness appearing in Valoch's de- scriptions: "... a pebble shaped like a chopping-tool," at Pestlorinc; ".... a rather primitive object," at Steinheim; "... the fragment of a biface-fashioned artifact," at Gura Kamenka IV; "... isolated pebble-tools," at Oka and Mos- kva; ". ... not a single hand-axe or other unobjectionably stratified Early Palaeo- lithic industry has come from Eastern Europe as far as the Urals"; etc. It seems probable that in each major Palaeolithic period certain regions of Central and Eastern Europe remained uninhabited and untransited by man, perhaps mainly for ecological reasons such as the presence of marshes, deep forest, or extensive ice cover. An adequate mapping of such areas for each period would be a valuable contribution, as it would advance our knowledge of the pos- sible routes of ethnic movements and cul- tural connections. Still, no doubt can exist that man lived in much of the area, and used it for transit, throughout the Pleistocene. His needs and his techno- logical abilities are likely to have been broadly similar to those of his fellow men from Western Europe or the Near East. It is unlikely that the human groups were drastically smaller in Central and Eastern Europe than in Western Europe or the Near East. Some of the Lower Palaeo- lithic sites so far discovered may have been just way-stations and not steadily inhabited localities, but this does not seem to be the only reason for the paucity of finds in the area as a whole. It is reason- able to assume that for at least some of the living levels that have been studied, most of the material industry was not found because it was not preserved. This may point to the possibility that Lower Palaeolithic man in the area used wood and other perishable materials in a rela- tively higher percentage than did con- temporary men living in other areas. Considering past misuse of the idea of prehistoric migrations, it is understand- able that Valoch is so much opposed to it. Ethnic movements are, however, likely to have occurred in Central and Eastern Europe, just as they did in the Near East, Central Asia, North Africa, and Western Europe. They ought to be considered in terms of the way of life of the period under discussion and the Palaeolithic rhythm of cultural evolution. Various subtypes of humans are detected in Eur- ope, and it is highly unlikely that all of them originated there and that all evolved exclusively in Europe. Likewise, various types of material culture must have been introduced to Europe from outside, main- ly from Southwestern Asia. In the enor- mous length of time of each detectable period, the introduction of a new culture or the arrival of a new human group may represent a very slow process, lasting several thousands of years; on the other hand, in some cases the process may have been much more rapid. Distances be- tween Central and Eastern Europe and Western Europe or the Near East are rather small when compared with dis- tances crossed by prehistoric man else- where, for instance with those crossed by the early human groups who, from their original home in Asia, ultimately reached Tierra del Fuego. Even today, nomad Bedouins on the Arabian Peninsula may cover as much as 1,000 kilometers in a single season. There are evidences of large-scale migrations in post-Palaeo- lithic times, and there is no reason to be- lieve that similar happenings never took place in the area during the Palaeolithic. Considering the recurring patterns of material culture in Eurasia, it is hard to accept the presence of many Lower Pa- laeolithic localized regional facies in Cen- tral and Eastern Europe. Most of these facies are likely to be related to wider cultural patterns. In Eurasia in general, marked local facies usually show up in the Middle Palaeolithic and tend to be- come clearer and better defined in the Upper Palaeolithic, when the rhythm of cultural evolution becomes much faster and detectable changes in material culture representshorter time periods than before. Each major Old World region, e.g., Western Europe, the Near East, North Africa, or Central and South Africa, has made some major contribution to the general evolution of Palaeolithic material culture. Each area, sooner or later, has given birth to some new material pattern which reflected the use of new techno- logical inventions, new tools and weapons, and new methods of food-getting, and which projected its influence into neigh- bouring areas. Undoubtedly, one of the 368 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="19">Valochz: PALAEOLITHIC IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE major contributions of Central and East- ern European prehistoric man to the general evolution of material culture is to be found in the Szeletian (and Pre-Solu- trean, in their various facies and denomi- nations). The Szeletian seems to be one of the few cultural assemblages likely to have been born and developed in the area which definitely influenced further ma- terial development throughout Europe. As in the Kostjenki area, so throughout Eurasia in the Upper Palaeolithic, groups of people making certain material cultures lived in the vicinity of other human groups making different material cul- tures. For generations and perhaps for centuries, these various patterns of ma- terial culture evolved separately and co- existed in the vicinity of each other with- out mixing; they succeeded in maintain- ing their typological autonomy. As I had the opportunity of discussing some years ago (1963: 12 7-29), extremely significant conclusions must be drawn from this fact as to Upper Palaeolithic social structure and social relations. Indeed, only a very specific social pattern could have allowed such a situation. I have some difficulty in accepting the idea that Palaeolithic art developed in- dependently in different regions as a con- sequence of "widely separated convergent phenomena." The range of subject mat- ter, the approach to specific subjects, the recurrent patterns of symbols and the repetitious connections between specific figures and symbols, the use of similar "decorative" patterns in variou, areas, all point to the fact that Palaeolithic art, from the Atlantic coast of Europe to Cen- tral Asia, is the expression of the same well-defined and rather dogmatically conceived ideology. Art seems to have expanded with the ideology it reflects, and it is likely that Palaeolithic art and the con- cepts it illustrates originated somewhere and diffused from a core to the periphery. I am rather reluctant to accept the term "Final Palaeolithic" for "Meso- lithic," as these terms have a different significance in the current terminology. The problem of defining the cultures which are chronologically located be- tween the end of the Upper Palaeolithic and the beginning of Neolithic is a prob- lem facing prehistoric archaeology in various Old World regions; we should attempt to solve it in a way acceptable universally. Usually, early "Mesolithic" phases show general material charac- teristics quite similar to the Upper Pa- laeolithic, while final "Mesolithic" tends to have a great many Neolithic-like ele- ments. For most areas it is impossible to introduce this period en bloc into the Palaeolithic. Perhaps a suggestion I pro- posed ( 1965, 1968) for the corresponding Near Eastern cultures might be accept- able for Central and Eastern Europe and other areas as well: The term "Meso- lithic" should be used, not to define a period, but only to define material indus- tries of a transitional character which are predominantly microlithic. Contempor- ary industries showing belated and some- times degenerate Palaeolithic traditions with a predominance of larger flint tools should be termed Epi-Palaeolithic. In- dustries with Neolithic-like elements such as axes, adzes, sickle-blades, and arrow- heads of types non-existent in earlier complexes should be termed "Proto- Neolithic." The period as a whole is so diversified culturally that one cannot use the same term to define it and its cultures; the only safe term would probably be a geological one like Early Holocene or Early Post-Glacial. Valoch's article is highly valuable for the order it brings to an enormous quan- tity of data and for the up-to-date syn- thesis it provides. Scholars will disagree with it in minor details, but we can safely view it as a major contribution to the pre- history of Central and Eastern Europe. by FRAN9OIS BORDES* Talence, France. 28 iII 68 This is a long awaited and a very useful paper. I do not see anything especially "primi- tive" about the hand-axe from Steinheim; it looks to me like a good Middle Acheulean, the more so since it is made of Triassic sandstone. As a general rule, the Acheulean has pebble tools as well as hand-axes. One, two, three pebble tools found alone may just as well belong to the Acheulean as to a "pebble culture." They may even belong to the Upper Palaeolithic or later periods. Another old idea that should be dis- carded is that there are always many hand-axes in the Acheulean. The propor- tion may vary from 2 or 3% to over 40%, depending on the site, the part of the site excavated, the type of Acheulean, its stage of evolution, and the time, or the method, of making the collection. The term "Micoquian" should be re- stricted, for the present at least, to West- ern and German sites. The sites from Poland probably belong to another tradi- tion, and Kiik Koba is certainly not Micoquian. The confusion between "prepared striking platform" and "Levallois tech- nique" (predetermination of the shape of the flake by a special preparation of the core) has dangerous implications. Although I created the term "Charen- tian" for the Quina-Ferrassie type of Mousterian, I am at a loss to imagine what a "Charentian of Micoque tradi- tion" is, unless it is a Mousterian with a high percentage of scrapers and some hand-axes-an assemblage which is not unknown in France in the "eastern facies Charentian," the hand-axes being pear- shaped and only remotely Micoquian- like. On the basis of Behm-Blancke's pub- lication, the material from Ehringsdorf very strongly resembles the Quina type of Western Europe, in which bifacial types (not hand-axes in the Acheulean sense) are sometimes quite numerous. It does not seem to lead directly to the Blattspitzen cultures of Germany or to the Szeletian, at least no more than do the Micoquian of Klausenische type, or even the Mousterian of Acheulean tradition (which does exist in Central Germany, near Zigenhein, where it was found by A. Luttropp and where I have seen it). Tata, on the other hand, could be a diminutive offspring of Ehringsdorf, but is certainly a special type of Mousterian, while Subalyuk, from what I have seen, is much more Western-like. In assessing the Central European "Tayacian," one must keep in mind, as Valoch points out, the possibility of natural action on man- made flakes or tools. The absence of any "Levalloisian" facies in Central Europe is perhaps the consequence of the absence of an abundant and readily available supply of flint. I heartily agree with Valoch that there were several centers for the development of Upper Palaeolithic out of the Middle Palaeolithic. In the West, the Lower Perigordian comes out of the Mousterian of Acheulean tradition. It seems quite probable that the Szeletian has its origin in the Blattspitzen cultures. In Russia, the Kostienki-I-Sungir culture probably has a different origin, perhaps in the Mous- terian of Russia itself; at the same time, other types appear, whose origin is less clear. As to the Aurignacian, while there may be some Aurignacoid implements at Russian sites, I do not know of any Aurignacoid culture there. I do not think the distinction between Aurignacian and Olschewian in Central Europe is a valid one. At Istallosko, in the lower level, there are a good number of split-base bone points, identical with the ones from the French Aurignacian I, and while the flint tools are so few that it is obvious they would not suffice for the maintenance of even a very few men, all of them are such as might be found in an Aurignacian assemblage. This is clearly a hunting site, not a living site, and every- where the so-called Olschewian is repre- sented by the scanty flint assemblages with typical bone points that are to be expected from hunting sites. Further, the Olschewian assemblages are mostly found in mountain caves. Outside of France, I do not know of any true burin busqul. Although the keeled (or carinate) scraper is a normal con- stituent of Aurignacian assemblages, it is not always the dominant type. In the Old Aurignacian. on the other hand, scrapers Vol. 9 -No. 5- December 1968 369</page><page sequence="20">on retouched blades and retouched blades are common (in the Aurignacian I of la Ferrassie, carinate scrapers, typical and atypical, account for 3.04%, scrapers on retouched blades 14.9%, and retouched blades 6.8%; in layer 5 of Vogelherd, carinates account for 3.05%, scrapers on retouched blades 10.5%, and retouched blades 13.42%). The relationship sup- posed by Muiller-Beck between the "Aurignacian blades" from Vogelherd and the Jerzmanowice points is not valid and recalls the old confusion of these Aurignacian blades with the Solutrean "pointes a face plane." If the sculptures at Vogelherd seem "a little early," it is only from a theoretical point of view, since sculpture had to begin somewhere. I do not see any obvious relationship be- tween the horse sculptures from Vogel- herd and Sungir, except that they both represent horses. There would be much to say about the so-called Pavlovian. I do not know well the implements from Pavlov, but Klima's beautiful publication on Dolni Vestonice permits one to get more than a fair know- ledge of this site. It is clearly Upper Perigordian in the western sense. I can (with one exception) put a tool from the open- air site of Carbiac (Dordogne) on each of Klima's illustrations, and from Klima's count, the proportions also seem very much alike. The typological differences, for two sites so far apart in space, are so slight that it is amazing. The exception is the "micro-saw," which, however, does occur, though rarely, in France in some Upper Perigordian and in the "Proto- Magdalenian" (Final Perigordian). The bone tools from Dolni Vestonice can also be found in the French Upper Peri- gordian. Dolni Vestonice seems to be an eastern extension of the Upper Peri- gordian (which could even stretch to Kostienki IV). The term "Pavlovian" should be restricted to Pavlov, or to the Willendorf-Kostienki I (Upper level) complex. In 1954, I counted at least one carinate (plus two atypical) in the Pre-Aurig- nacian of Jabrud. The "hole-stick" (if this means the "baton de commande- ment") is already known in the Lower Aurignacian in France and Germany (Vogelherd) and is not specifically Mag- dalenian, and there are numerous Mag- dalenian sites without "spear-heads with a gutter for blood." Valoch seems to think that the idea of multiple cultures coexisting in a "small territory" (the southwest of France) pre- sents problems; but 10,000 to (at most) 20,000 people in an area bigger than Czechoslovakia would certainly have had elbow room. As for the significance of the different facies of the Mousterian "dis- tinguished only technologically" (and typologically!), I believe that although they probably do not represent great racial differences, they do represent dis- tinct ethnic groups. Any other explana- tion raises more problems than it solves, and if, even today-with books, easy travel, radio, television, population pres- sure, etc.-there are significant cultural differences between European subcul- tures, why not in Palaeolithic times? by DESMOND COLLINS* London, England. 14 iii 68 This article will clearly be valuable, since the literature of the Slavic languages sum- marised here is inevitably a closed book to most Western scholars. It is encourag- ing to read that "large ethnic migrations . . . as were suggested for the Perigordian (from Asia Minor to France) are no longer hypothesised," even though Valoch and other writers who have come to favour local cultural development have not en- tirely got away from the "Gravettian" terminology, which largely presupposes such migrations. Valoch follows other authors in dis- tinguishing a pebble-tool industry from a flake-tool industry. Mlazice, for example, is grouped with the pebble-tool industry. In the collections from there that I exa- mined in 1966, however, two typical chopping tools and nine rather more dubious choppers were accompanied by eighteen flakes which are Clactonian in character and compare closely with those of the Swanscombe Lower Gravels in spite of the difference in raw material. Following Warren (1951), it is clear that the Clactonian contains a typical, if small, chopping-tool component. Mlazice ac- cordingly differs little from the Clactonian and shares with it typical traits such as the Clactonian notch and biconical core. One may reasonably surmise that earlier occurrences of chopping tools in this area may be earlier stages of the Clactonian. Also, it is somewhat misleading to equate Wangen and Wallendorf with Hundisburg and Markkleeberg in a single flake-tool industry. While Hundisburg shares hand-axes and Levallois flakes with Markkleeberg, Wangen and Wallendorf have neither; they are purely Clactornian, as Toepfer (1961c) has pointed out, hav- TABLE 1 INDICES FOR SIDE-SCRAPERS AND PRADNIK KNIVES AT Two POLISH SITES Krakow- Ciemna Wavel Cave IR (Side-scrapers) 13.8 32.64 IRCP (Pradnik 1.8 34.32 knives) IR + IRCP 15.6 66.96 ing Clactonian flakes, Clactonian notches, and, at Wallendorf, the biconical core. Both are small assemblages (Wangen 38 artefacts, Wallendorf 86) and the absence of chopping tools may reflect the fact that in the later Clactonian, as from Little Thurrock (Wymer 1957), this type may form less than 1 % of the artifacts. I agree that Hundisburg may be grouped with the Acheulian. Metrical indices for the flakes come out very close to those for the Acheulian and distinctly outside the range for the Clactonian (see, for example, the figures for two of these in- dices given in Table 1). The five Clac- tonian sites seem to form a developmental sequence spanning the Holstein. I venture to doubt whether Markklee- berg and Hundisburg are really at all closely related to Lebenstedt, which seems to be of much later date, but they do seem to resemble the more nearly con- temporary assemblages from Bakers Hole and Ebbsfleet Lower Gravel, both typo- logically and in their fauna. Again, the view that Taubach and Ehringsdorf are part of the same development seems un- tenable. Ehringsdorf has limaces and Quina retouch and is typical of the Charentian, albeit quite strongly Leval- lois. Taubach, by contrast, lacks Charen- tian types. With denticulates and "de- generate" hand-axes, it groups much better on the Acheulian side of the spec- trum, and (along with Rabutz and per- haps French Levallois denticulate sites like Evreux II) can be conveniently labelled Taubachian.

The existence of a true Aurignacian here in the French sense remains disputed. Using figures for some of the Czech Aurignacian sites, one can, I think, make out quite a plausible developmental sequence (see Table 2). While this development is strongly Aurignacian in its earlier stages (con- sistently high values for Aurignacian re- touched blades and for the carinate group-buskoids), it is not identical to that of Western Europe and deserves a separate name. A second rather plausible evolution has been suggested by Grigoriev (1966) from Krems-Hundsteig via Willendorf II 5-9 and Pavlov to Kostjenki I 1. The "Du- four" assemblages of the Krems group are of course very widespread, and seem to be "Aurignacian" in origin. These "Aurignacians" of Obciny, Krems, and southwestern France may well have a common origin (say in Fossellone), but alternatively it could be argued that any Leptolithic trend in the Charentian will inevitably produce an "Aurignacian"; for the carinate is only a steep limace modified by lamellar retouch, and Aurig- nacian retouched blades are essentially Charentian. Furthermore, the lamellar retouch inevitably produces bladelets of the sort used to make the Dufours, Krems points, and backed bladelets as found in the "Pavlovian." None of these suggestions, nor the rather numerous misspellings and mis- translations, should be allowed to detract from the fact that this survey is a most valuable source of data on the present state of the Palaeolithic in Central and Eastern Europe, and a good starting point for the relevant critical discussion which characterises sciencc. by HENRI DELPORTE* Paris, France. 25 iii 68 Valoch's paper is a very interesting sur- vey of the Palaeolithic of Central and Eastern Europe, based on an objective view of the facts. For a long time, Central and Eastern European prehistorians have tried to find, in their excavations, exactly the same civilisations as in France; workers ofa newgeneration-among them Valoch-have succeeded in isolating for study the local and regional tool-assem- blages and so defining them as to con- tribute to an attempt at the precise state- ment of their relationships with the tool- assemblages of Western Europe. This new orientation demands the abandonment of the idealistic hypothesis of the eastern origin of the civilisations, a hypothesis formerly defended, mistakenly of course, by a number of French prehistorians. For the Upper Palaeolithic (which interests me particularly), Valoch's paper confirms the existence of three regional complexes, connected one with another by transitional zones: the Western, the Carpatho-Pannonic, and the Russo- Ukrainian. A very detailed analysis has permitted Valoch to establish new dis- tinctions and produce a more realistic view of the Palaeolithic industries and facies. Here I want to present a few observa- tions-not criticisms, but only notes and ideas: 1) In spite of a lot of C14 dating, the geological and chronological correlations between Western, Central, and Eastern Europe are still inaccurate. Valoch and Bordes (1957) have proposed a general relationship between the loesses of Central and Western Europe, but today it is apparent that the facts are more complex; and the work of Soviet students of the Pleistocene and prehistorians on correla- tions with Eastern Europe is still very limited. 2) The beginning of the Upper Pa- laeolithic seems to come at about the same time in Western, Central, and Eastern Europe: in the former Gottweig Interstadial, for which Musil and Valoch would substitute the Podhradem, and which recent work (by Leroi-Gourhan and the Dutch palynologists) has shown to be extremely complex in Western Europe. The :ituation is not yet very clear in the U.S.S.R., for one of the oldest assemblages, that of the lower level of Sungir, is dated to 20,540 B.P. 3) In Central Europe, the separation between Aurignacian and Olschewian is not absolute: the Olschewian could be a "facies de carence" of the Aurignacian. The hypothesis of a kind of merging of these industries to form the typical Aurig- nacian of Western Europe would, how- ever, be tempting if the dates obtained for the various industries were consistent withi it. 4) Western influences certainly oc- curred in the industries of Central Europe, but the example of Chatelperron points in level 4 of Ilsenhohle (Ranis) is not convincing; the Chatelperron points occur here in an evolved industry with Gravette points, relatively recent, and may constitute a recurrence, perhaps on account of a technical weakness or the characteristics of the raw material. 5) Valoch thinks that the Aurig- nacian does not exist in Eastern Europe; but the appropriately distiinguished Spi- cyna group seems to have Aurignacian af- finities (end-scrapers on retouched blades, more or less "burins busques," etc.). 6) I think that it is necessary to dis- tinguish, on the one hand, the Kostenkian proper, which is very homogeneous (Kostenki I, Gagarino, Avdeevo, etc.), and, on the other hand, a different facies, more evolved and certainly more recent (Mezine, Eliseevitchi, Kiev, etc.). Aside from the above remarks, I fully agree with Valoch's ideas, particularly on the origin in the Middle Palaeolithic of the Prae-Solutrean, Szeletian, and prob- ably the Russian Streletzkaia-Sungir group, a process which closely corre- sponds to the origin of the Western Chatelperronian in some final facies of the Western European Mousterian. by GISELA FREUND* Erlangen, West Germany. 20 ix 67 Valoch's article should be well received. It constitutes a step toward making the Central and Eastern European Palaeo- lithic better known, especially among our non-European colleagues. A detailed commentary on this complex subject, skilfully condensed by Valoch in these few pages, would be too voluminous and complicated. I would therefore like to restrict my comments to just a few points, drawing mainly upon my own experience. Naturally, in comparison with Western Europe, the Central and Eastern Euro- pean Middle Palaeolithic appears to be quite poor. This picture can be expected to change considerably, at least for the western half of Central Europe, after complete study of the Sesselfelsgrotto (actually a rock-shelter) in Neu-Essing on the lower reaches of the Altmuehl Valley (under excavation by L. Zotz and G. Freund since 1964) and the surface site on the Speckberg near Eichstaett in the Middle Altmuehl Valley region (under excavation by H. Mueller-Beck since 1964). Here also, a number of phases can be worked out-something which up to now was not believed possible. Contrary to Valoch, I would not in- clude the cultural remains of the Riss Glaciation in the Middle Palaeolithic. Further, as Zotz and I have pointed out to him on several occasions, the industries of the stratigraphically sub-divided Mous- terian of the Sesselfelsgrotto do not rep- resent a Tayacian. The small tools on flakes which he mentions in connection with the Sesselfelsgrotto are, to our know- ledge, very special elements of this par- ticular site, observed nowhere else; they are found alongside of the large classic scraper forms and at no time appear to represent a "Micro-Mousterian". (Inci- dentally, we would like to suggest washing the sediment over graduated screens as a very good method for recovering the smallest elements of a culture level. Only in this way were we able to recover the microlithic flakes.) Definite microlithic artifacts, the edges of which have a semi- steep angle of retouch, often alternated, are found in all five zones of the main culture level (see Freund and Zotz 1968). The artifacts from the Sesselfelsgrotto which Valoch saw and to which he refers in this article were recovered from the first test trench in 1964. Itl the meantime, Vol. 9 JNo. 5 December 1968 371</page><page sequence="22">the amount of material has increased tremendously. There has never been any reason to believe that a Tayacian existed. It appears to us that simply to rename the Eastern Gravettian of Eastern Europe, the onetime "Upper Aurignacian" of this area, "Pavlovian," without considering the fact that the industry of loc. typicus is neither published nor well known, rep- resents a rather unfortunate move. Also, the grouping together of such different industries as, for example, Predmosti, Willendorf II (levels 5-9), Moravany- Podkovica, etc. is an unsatisfactory approach. In considering the western ex- pansion of this "Pavlovian," we would like to mention the ca. 50-cm.-long "ivory spade" from Abri I in the village of Neu- Essing (next to Abri II = Sesselfelsgrotto; see Zotz 1960); it is the only known specimen of its kind from the western part of Central Europe, and its only satisfac- tory parallels are to be found in the bone material from Predmosti. In addition, the silex industry of Abri I shows a number of similarities with those of the Pavlovian. (Klima has recently undertaken a com- parative study of the Pavlov and Abri I sites.) As to the difficult question of the pro- gressive advance of the bearers of the 4'1eaf-blade groups," for example the Szeletian (which Valoch sees as a regres- sion), a number of positive things can be said when one considers the different leaf-blade groups and their Eurasiatic ,distribution (see, e.g., Freund 1952). The name "Szeletian" should, for con- venience's sake, be restricted to the Hun- garian complex, only, as was decided with good reason during the 1966 Szeleta Symposium in Budapest. by MIKL6s GABORI* Budapest, Hungary. 15 ix 67 Valoch's study-a valuable and interest- ing survey-shows at the same time that solutions to the problems of the Paleolithic depend very much on what part of the world these problems are viewed from. The author examines the development of the Paleolithic (or, to be more exact, its typogenetics) primarily in the north of Europe. The development of types may, of course, best be followed where the material is more abundant; but the study of biological evolution has shown that populations often decline precisely in the area in which they evolved and later re- establish themselves en masse elsewhere. The Lower Paleolithic is so varied and uncertain that grouping the industries is as yet impossible. For example, the micro- chopper industry of Vertesszollos cannot, in my opinion, be associated with the -Heidelbergian, even if such an industry as, the "Heidelbergian" should exist at all; it seems to me instead to carry southern impulses. The small size of the implements cannot be accounted for by their material; such an adaptation can hardly be expected in that period and at that level of human evolution (Kretzoi and Vertes 1965c). The possibility of a relationship between the pebble-indus- tries of the Lower and the Middle Paleo- lithic, suggested by the similarity between the Vertesszollos pebble-industry and the Middle Paleolithic of Tata, is not to be excluded, but the hypothesis of introduc- tion of a microchopper tradition from the south seems more appropriate in view of the fact that the temporal distance is still problematic. The evolution of microliths in the Lower Paleolithic can not be traced; thus it seems unlikely that Vertesszollos is the descendant of some other industry. The Lower Paleolithic covers a far wider field than that under discussion. The industries, of, for example, the Vallonet or-later-the Terra Amata (Lumley et al. 1963, Lumley 1966, Howell et al. etc.), together with other finds from Southern Europe, may account for the appearance of some of the Lower Paleolithic industries. Whether these in- dustries are related to the Middle Paleo- lithic of Southern or Southeastern Europe (Charentian, Pontiniano-Charentian, Pontinian, generally what is called "Pebble-Mousterian") is another impor- tant point to be further examined. In my estimation, the pebble-group first appeared in Europe in the South and from there gradually influenced the North; whereas the Lower Paleolithic with hand-axes gained ground in the northwestern territories. A similar re- gional distribution and a west-to-east ex- pansion may be observed in the Middle Paleolithic. The expansion may have taken place in several waves (Thoma 1962). I would not preclude the possi- bility of a certain amount of migration; Valoch's rejection of migration appears to me too rigid. Dividing the Middle Paleolithic in- dustries into facies, in the absence of a system for the eastern part of Central Europe and Eastern Europe similar to Bordes's, is uncertain and results in too many new group names. The statistical treatment which might clarify the situa- tion must await the development of a system of types covering this area. The division of the Central European typical Mousterian into two groups is also prob- lematic in the following ways: (1) I can- not place Gudenus and Krapina in the same facies ("Sipkian"). The latter seems to be a blend of two different industries, one approaching the typical Mousterian (in the Central European sense) and the other an Eastern or Southeastern Euro- pean Charentian (with pebble culture). The two may originally have been separ- ated stratigraphically. (2) I cannot accept the grouping of the industries of Sipka, Subalyuk, and the minor sites in Tran- sylvania in the same facies. Subalvuk is a rather typical (Central European Mous- terian), but the Transylvanian sites differ from it and seem to display Western in- fluences (perhaps from the direction of Yugoslavia?). These industries may have become "atypical" when they were shifted to the mountains. (3) Valoch has suggested that the industry of the recently excavated site at erd should be considered a separate facies similar to an early Charentian (in the Western sense). This site, where the development of a single culture may be observed in more than one level, throws new light upon the development of the Middle Paleolithic (Cabori and Csank 1966, 1967). Veter- nica cave (Malez 1958, 1959) in Yugo- slavia is also important in this respect. Here industry cf the lower bed is Charen- tian and that of the upper one resembles a typical Mousterian. Such a facies shift is assumed to have taken place in Betalov spodmol (Yugoslavia) as well (Brodar 1956). The material from Repolust and Gudemus, which is very important for defining the facies, must be re-examined in the light of these discoveries. The transitional industries of the southeastern Alps, best represented by Mixnitz, might be termed "defective Mousterian." They may have been represented at open sites as well as caves and are probably related to industries from northeastern Yugo- slavia. I agree with Valoch's summary of the Middle Paleolithic except for the fact that he concentrates, again, upon the northern part of Central Europe. The charac- teristic feature of Central Europe in contrast to Western Europe is indeed the absence of Levalloisian technique, where- as the outstanding feature of the Mous- terian of the northern Flachlandtundra is precisely the Levalloisian technique; at this point I revert to the hypothesis as to regional distribution and direction of expansion offered above. A brief and simple outline-hypotheti- cal and provisional, of course-under dis- cussion is the following: In Southern Europe (including the foothills, of the Alps, the northern part of Yugoslavia, the margins of the southeastern Alps, and the western part of Hungary) a Mous- terian with pebble culture developed (or was introduced?) in the Lower Paleolithic -analogous in developmental terms to the "charentien sur galet" version of the later Western Charentian. In the western part of the zone there were, of course, definitely Levalloisian-type industries as well. This vast group, if it was not autoch- thonous, must have been spreading in a west-to-east direction. North of the Danubian basin, the Mousterian was a Middle Paleolithic with leaf-shaped points, Levalloisian tech- nique, etc., the typogenetics of which has been excellently summed up by Valoch. The spread within this area has been dealt with by Bosinski (1963). Between 372 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="23">Valoch: PALAEOLITHIC IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE. the two areas, the interior of the Alps forms, as it were, an island, very seldom influenced by the West (e.g., Cotencher). These zones seem to represent not only typological or cultural, but also climato- ecological, relations. Local and often long-term internal development of the various industries and also, beginning with the last interglacial, some migration within these zones must (perhaps no more than infiltration or penetration) be taken into account. There is, as Valoch suggests, some possibility of influence from the opposite direction: the apparent effect of the eastern and southern Rumanian Middle Paleolithic on the industries of the Balkans and-at the same time-on that the lower bed of Subalyuk cave. In the Balkans, influences from a different direc- tion may also be assumed (Leroi-Gourhan 1962: 264). The genetic relations of the Mouster- ian-Szeletian have been established by myself. I think it impossible, however, that the Szeletian of Western Hungary or elsewhere should have developed out of a Tata-type, Micro-Pontinian-like indus- try. The basis of the Bukk Szeletian is the local Mousterian; the Transdanubian is related rather to the industry of the Ger- man Blattspzitzen. In my opinion these are industries of entirely different origin. As to the chronology of the Szeletian, I agree with the author: the earlier stage of the culture may have existed up to Stillfried B; This is supported by several typological observations. As regards ori- gin: if the Szeletian developed under the influence of the Aurignacian + Olsche- wian out of the Mousterian, why are there no bone implements in the Szeletian when the Aurignacian + Olschewian abounds in bone implements? The question may be raised whether or not it is proper to call all the industries with leaf-shaped points within and round the Carpathian basin "Szeletian." If so, this culture must have several (chrono- logical-local) variants. The Bukk Szele- tian constitutes an almost separate group; the Transdanubian (e.g., Jankovich cave, Dzerava skala) is typologically different, and so is the industry of Moravany-Dlha and Vlckovce in Slovakia. Again, there is another industry with leaf-shaped points from Northern Hungary which typo- logically points towards the western part of Central Europe with its earlier, Clac- tonian tradition. All these are variants of the Szeletian within the Carpathian basin alone. I do not think one is justified in replac- ing Gravettian by Pavlovian. Quite a number of sites drop out of the "Pav- lovian": Pavlov, Bodrogkeresztur, Saig- var, the Micro-Gravettian group of the caves (other than W 3, which might prove an exception), and the Istrian Gravettian cannot be connected, even typologically. Kamegg and Langmnan- nersdorf represent, again, different com- positions, different relations (Brandtner 1955, Angeli 1953). Even Willendorf 5-9 cannot be termed simply "Pavlovian." The Pavlovian is a special group, a highly developed form of the Gravettian; the industry or culture of the Gravettian cannot come under the general term Pavlovian, even though the two are in- separable. Kostjenkian, and later Mezy- nian, might be a proper designation. The constituents and the Eastern roots of that culture are obvious (Gabori and Gabori 1957, Gaibori 1960). Its appear- ance in Central Europe was a slow pro- cess, through successive migrations that can easily be traced. The migration wave seems likely to have come to rest before it reached the Eastern Carpathians (Ceach- lau, etc.). Instead of generalizing about the Gravettian, I think it more appro- priate to locate the various groups (cf. Felgenhauer 1959), if only because these groups may reveal the scope and direction of movement as well as the relations between the lesser and greater ethnic units. Again, I favor a statistical ap- proach, but with some such basis of classification as, for example, whether mammoth or reindeer was the principal object of the hunt (the difference being likely to represent different ways of living and thinking). In my opinion, the ultimate aim of research is to go beyond typo- genesis (which does not necessarily indi- cate the phylogenesis of the cultures) to paleoethnography and historical in- ference. A final note: a subject so highly differ- entiated and comprehensive both in space and in time is much easier to comment upon than to work up in all its details. Thanks are due to the author for this excellent survey. by ALEXANDER GALLUS* Melbourne, Australia. 19 ix 67 It is important for CURRENT ANTHRO- POLOGY to encourage synthetic articles on regional and topical units. My aim here is not so much to appraise the merits of the present paper, as to raise the question of methodology in general. Valoch saw as his main task a geo- graphical and morphological classifica- tion of tool complexes (types, facies, groups, industries etc.; he uses these terms rather indiscriminately, probably repeating the terms employed in his sources) and the enunciation of opinions about their origin, development, mutual influences, expansion, and place in space and time. The question I want to raise is whether there is any justification today for restricting oneself to a description and analysis of tool complexes and consciously leaving out what Valoch calls the "palaeo- anthropological" aspect. Should pre-"history" not be based on "palaeoanthropology"? Authors appar- ently tend to confuse the analysis of the- products of human creative activity with pre-"history." Such analysis leads only to meaningful assertions about the artifacts themselves and their development; that is, it leads to a history of technology, rather than to a history of mankind. The constructs developed so far and used by- Valoch and by many other modern authors are unable to raise our thinking to a higher level of abstraction than that of the documents we have gathered. The units of classification offered are not, ethnic units, but morphological types. The relation of these morphological units to ethnic units, specified in space and time remains unexamined, and the subject as a whole remains opaque to historical inter- pretation. Further, it is disconcerting to ponder- the outcome of a method based on the- statement of opinions, offered as simple judgments with no otherjustification than a survey of various authors and their views. By all means, Valoch may be right; but how are we to decide? Are we sup- posed to proceed to a show of hands-so many experts saying aye and a lesser number being against it-and all this in lieu of methodical proof? This, I fear, is a regressive step even beyond "Siedlungs- archaologie" or "Kulturkreis" theory (Closs 1956), the constructs of which have proved too sweeping, but which at least offered an ethnic interpretation of their morphological units and attemp- ted to develop a method of writing history. Approaches have been made, since the downfall of these schools, towards clarifi- cation of concepts (Tax et al. 1953, Kroeber 1953), but many authors are content to by-pass the problem by setting up morphological analysis as an appar- ently separate discipline in itself, one which threatens to absorb prehistory, especially aided by more sophisticated excavation techniques and by a mathe- matical approach (statistics, graphs, com- puters, etc.) which satisfies the need for objectivity. Periodicals are surcharged with this kind of work and even dis- courage attempts to transcend this level. They may be right in so doing, however, as long as the current vague "methodo- logy" of offering opinions about the anthropogeographic and vaguely his- torical meaning of morphologically classi- fied material prevails. One suspects an early connection with classical archaeo-- logy, especially with methods developed in the appreciation of art-styles, from Winkelmann to modern art-historians. The ambitious term "culture" for what is often no more than an assemblage- of human tools points in the same direction. Vol. 9 - No. 5- December 1968 373</page><page sequence="24">Perhaps a new beginning could be made if authors would insist on the following: 1) Selection of a minimum unit for analysis, such as (a) a living floor or settlement or (b) a cemetery. 2) Treatment of this unit in full, in- cluding (a) statistical analysis of the tool- complex as developed by the Bordes school; (b) typology and technology of the tools; (c) ecology of the biological niche-food, habitat, climate; (d) infer- ences about religious practices, etc. from grave-goods, art, and other available data. 3) Comparative analysis of such units and of their development in space and time, based on statistical and typological methods. 4) Formulation of a working hypo- thesis as to the ethnohistorical validity and an attempt at historical interpreta- tion. Perhaps by now I have succeeded in showing that treating one small aspect of man's progress through time (changing morphology of artifacts) is carrying specialization too far. These remarks have to be taken, of course, as a criticism of modern trends in general; they are not meant to detract from the usefulness of Valoch's catalogue or survey as a means of data organization. by ASOK KUMAR GHOSH* Cambridge, Mass., U.S.A. 27 in 68 This magnificent, extensive paper will be extremely interesting to prehistorians concerned with the typo-technological evolution of the Palaeolithic culture, es- pecially those who are not competent in Central and Eastern European languages. At the outset, I must admit that I have no practical field experience in the area which Valoch has described (although I have had the opportunity to examine some of the collections from both Eastern and Central Europe). I will therefore restrict my comments to general ones and leave the more detailed comments to others. If I understand Valoch correctly, he is primarily trying to establish that the evolution of the Palaeolithic in Central and Eastern Europe was a process of continuous cultural development. He considers the area as a single culture area, with some broad regional divisions. To my mind, the cultural unit should also include Western Europe, if not other sur- rounding regions as well. Valoch sees Western Europe, particularly France, as a separate culture area. How far is this correct in the light of the spatial distribu- tion of the Palaeolithic culture complex? In the Early Palaeolithic period, he sees two distinct cultures: the chopper- chopping (pebble) tool complex (or "group," according to Valoch) and the Abbevillian-Acheulian complex. He ar- gues that the "Early Palaeolithic remains from Germany to Rumania belong to the pebble-tool group that existed here in- dependently of the biface." Two similar hypotheses come immediately to mind: (a) the division of the Palaeolithic of India into two distinct cultures, the Soan pebble culture in the North and the Peninsular biface culture in the South; and (b) Movius' idea of a western bifacial and an eastern chopper-chopping tool tradition. Neither of these hypotheses is now considered valid. Valoch himself will probably soon point out a relation- ship between the pebble-tool and the Abbevillian-Acheulian "groups." Valoch has attempted to describe the spread of hand-axes in terms of "radiation from the area of the Acheulian, gradually decreasing as one proceeds eastward." In fact, hand-axes appear again further east, in the Middle East and in India. If the evolution of the Palaeolithic is to be considered a continuous process, then we need to know the criteria for defining its subdivisions. If geological stratigraphy is a criterion, then the arbitrary divisions of Early, Middle, and Upper should correspond to cultural horizons. Valoch's view that the Middle Palaeolithic evolved from the Early Palaeolithic should be supported with more evidence. The Middle Palaeolithic in the area concerned contains Early Palaeolithic culture traits (types and techniques) as well as new ones. Valoch has suggested some new terms for certain industries. He has retained such other terms as Mousterian, Aurig- nacian, Micoquian, Tayacian, etc. All of the latter terms, however, have definite cultural (techno-typological) and strati- graphic connotations, and the industries of Central and Eastern Europe so named may in fact be typological and or techno- logical mutations or variants. I think it would be appropriate to include in the designation of an industry a prefix de- noting the country in which it is found. The use of the terms "Late Palaeo- lithic" and "Final Palaeolithic" is a bit confusing. The bridging of the typological and genetic gap is evident; every archaeo- logist knows that the end of a cultural period does not necessarily mean the end of the culture and the extinction of the people. Moreover, the Mesolithic period denotes a new economic achievement, and that is the main basis for the tripartite division of the Stone Age. by FRANK HOLE* Houston, Tex., U.S.A. 8 iII 68 Valoch's review is important and useful for the large numnber of readers who do not have access to the voluminous litera- ture concerning Central and Eastern Europe. A careful and comprehensive review of this sort, however, raises as many questions about the development and interconnections of the industries in the Paleolithic as it answers. Chief among these is whether one can hope to under- stand the evolution of the Paleolithic by plotting the distribution of the types of tools in time and space. Clearly this is an important first step, but an explanation of the distributions requires another approach and the use of quite different sets of information. To avoid going into tedious detail, I shall only cite one example from the review. The Middle Paleolithic is treated like the other subdivisions by plotting the geo- graphic distributions of the industries. As Valoch points out, the Middle Paleolithic lasted for some "150,000 years from the beginning of the Riss Glacial to the Middle Wurm-Interstadial Podhradem." It must therefore be characterized by great climatic changes. It is also a period during which the industries became "richly divided." Obviously time can be controlled to only a limited extent in most of the sites; but both time and environment seem crucial to under- standing the possible relationships be- tween industries, the reasons for the geo- graphic distributions, and the causes for change in local sequences. Moreover, we must also try to see human groups carry- ing out their daily activities: e.g., what kind of game did they hunt? what kind of shelter did they need? how many people would the land support? in which areas was human occupation precluded at any time? Explanations for the observed distribu- tions are more likely to be found after a careful consideration of the topographic, climatic, and cultural factors than they are by confining ourselves to "typo- genetic" relations, although these are im- portant to know in the first place. To speak of waves of influence ("the Mico- quian wave becomes ever weaker as one proceeds eastward ... .") is to give a spurious life to stone tools and may have the effect of clouding our minds to more constructive thinking. It should be clear that I am not criticizing the job Valoch has done, for it is essential; I am asking that he or other workers take the next step of putting the data into a larger context that offers more explanatory opportunity. Aside from these general remarks, there are some particular points that need clarification. First, the term "typogene- tic" contains an implication of biological relationship which I think is unwar- ranted. The statement One might imagine that the typologically advanced Aurignacian + Olschewian influ- enced the more primitive contemporary Mousterian and that this contact resulted in the Szeletian, a Middle Paleolithic industry enriched with Upper Paleolithic forms. gives more flesh and blood to artifacts than many archeologists would admit. Related to the above criticism is the question of the advizability of calling end 374 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="25">Valoch: PALAEOLITHIC IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE scrapers "Aurignacoid." Giving a fami- liar label to artifacts that are similar typo- logically but not very close geographically tends to shift the focus of analysis away from the local situation to the possibility of obscure and remote relationships. Such a practice has a long tradition and we all resort to it for convenience on occasion, but the drawbacks may more than out- weigh the gains, especially in a com- parative treatment such as the one under review. Finally, the use of the phrase "all three great civilizations (Perigordian, Pav- lovian, Magdalenian)" is misleading, for the term "civilization" refers to much more complex organizations of people than are implied in the Upper Paleolithic remains. In the present context perhaps "technological traditions" or "assem- blages" would be more appropriate. by DAVID M. HOPKINS* Menlo Park, Calif., U.S.A. 4 iII 68 I would like to offer a speculation as to a possible relationship between increasing population density and the observed in- crease in cultural diversity during the Palaeolithic in Europe. If, as seems likely, the earliest human populations were all small, nomadic bands who lived by hunting and gathering then we might imagine that annual friendly meetings of different bands took place for trading and in order to acquire wives (the near- universality of incest taboos would suggest that from very early times human groups avoided inbreeding, for obvious adaptive reasons). The probability that contacts among human groups were friendly is perhaps enhanced by the fact that the sparse populations did not need to com- pete for territory and thus a central cause of intergroup hostility may not yet have existed. As the populations increased, they exerted more pressure on resources, and the utilization of one band's custo- mary territory by a neighboring band may have heightened intergroup hostility and reduced the frequency of friendly contacts; in the meantime, local popula- tions had increased to an extent that it became unnecessary to go outside the group for mates. Restriction of bands or groups of bands to increasingly well- defined territories may have contributed to a tendency toward regional specializa- tion of technology as a way of making maximal use of the resources of areas to which individual groups were now re- stricted. Increasing regional specializa- tion decreased the economic value of a wife from a different band equipped to cope with a somewhat different set of resources. These tendencies would height- en linguistic differentiation, which would feed back to reduce friendly contact and easy flow of ideas and technology. Thus increasing differentiation of local cultures would have continued until the time when early organized civilized communi- ties, with their homogenizing political and bureaucratic control of large areas, began to develop. A similar evolution seems to me to have taken place, much later, in the Americas: there, a fairly homogeneous "palaeo- Indian" culture existed over much of the hemisphere during the interval 13,000- 10,000 years ago and then began to differentiate very rapidly in the manner that cultural and technological differen- tiation seems to have taken place in Europe perhaps 50,000 years earlier. by I. K. IVANOVA* Moscow, U.S.S.R. 15 ix 67 Valoch's review is of great interest be- cause of the large body of evidence bear- ing on the European Paleolithic that it covers. Certain points, general as well as particular require comment. As far as the general problems of (Central and) Eastern European strati- graphy are concerned, it should be noted that certain indications of climatic fluc- tuations in the middle of the Wuirm, corresponding to Valoch's Podhradem Interstadial, are known from the Soviet Union. In fact, a clear transition from the Middle to the Upper Paleolithic appears to have been associated with this time (Ivanova, 1965b: 52-53). A more impor- tant climatic change seems to have occur- red, however, in the following Paudorf Interstadial (whicn Valoch considers only an oscillation). The widespread occurrence in the extraglacial area of the U.S.S.R. of a typical fossil soil of Paudorf age is sug- gestive of such a change. Radiocarbon measurements give the following dates for this soil: 29,000?1,250 (H-1866/1287) for a wood sample from the shore of the Belaya River in Bashkirya; 24,900 ? 1,800 (MO-337) for a humus sample from Bryansk district; 24,200 ? 1,680 (MO- 342) for humus from a loess section near Mezin village in the Ukraine; and 29,650 ?1,230 and 28,100 ?1,000 (H7P- 15) for charcoals from cultural layer IX of the Molodova V site near the Dniestr river (Ivanova 1966). A set of similar dates is known from Siberia, where a rise in temperature dur- ing so-called Kargin time was so impor- tant that it may even constitute an inter- glacial (Kind 1965). It is highly probable that a fossil soil dating from this time and later eroded provided material for those intercalations of washed-in humus from the Kostenki region which, as Valoch mentions, have been dated to about 20,000 years (no true fossil soils are known from the Kostenki area; the two bands of redeposited humus occurring there may, due to their transportation, produce age values lower than the true ones). On the whole, an important rise in temperature, interstadial in nature, is fairly well con- firmed for a period from 29,000 to 25,000 years ago. The change of climate corresponding to Valoch's Podhradem Interstadial is far less distinct in the U.S.S.R. It cannot be traced in platform sections and may only rarely be recognized in the slopes of the river valleys, as is particularly the case in the Dniestr river region. Soil formation processes were rather weak at this time. Both paleontological and paleobotanical indications for an important rise in tem- perature are lacking. Such a pattern is illustrated, by the profile from the Molo- dova V Paleolithic site, where this "inter- stadial" is most pronounced (Ivanova 1966: Fig. 20). As to the areal extent of the Paleolithic in Eastern Europe, without dwelling on the many uncertainties that still exist the following may be noted: The European part of the U.S.S.R. was widely occupied in Mousterian time, and man had by this time moved rather far to the north. Thus a rich Mousterian site, with a large body of unifacial and bifacial points, discoid cores, and side-scrapers and the remains of a mammoth, has been discovered in stratified position near Khotylevo, north- west of the town of Bryansk (Zavernyaev 1961, Zavernyaev and Schmidt 1961). This site is associated with a basal pebble horizon from the 25-meter terrace of the Desna river which contains a warmth- loving molluscan fauna (Motouz 1967); hence it probably belongs to the end of Riss-Wurm (Mikulino Interglacial). Iso- lated Mousterian finds are known from rather far to the north in the Oka River basin, near the town of Belev (Lyubin and Petrakov 1964). Mousterian finds are reported also from still farther north, but their reliability is not yet proved (as is particularly the case for the Early Paleo- lithic finds in the Moscow area mentioned by Valoch). In any case, Mousterian Man reached as far as 540 N. latitude. As to whether the Crimea was the center of development of Mousterian culture, as Valoch suggests, it is difficult to say. Certain paleogeographical features of the Crimea are important here: In pre-Karangat (pre-Riss-Wuirm) time, a deep regression of the Black Sea basin took place, and the draining of the shallow Asov sea made the Crimean peninsula part of the mainland. In Karangat (Riss- Wiirm) time, a large sea transgression occurred and the Crimea was undoubted- ly separated from the continent, forming a rather small island. It was inhabited by men as is confirmed by the finding of a Mousterian point in the Karangat de- posits (Gvosdover and Nevesskyi 1961), but it was isolated. Furthermore both in the Crimea and in the Russian Plain, Mousterian sites associated with Riss- Vol. 9 ;No. 5 December 1968 375</page><page sequence="26">Wurm time are rare and are mostly associated with the first half of the Wurm. Hence it would seem that the Crimea can hardly be assumed to have been a center of development of the Mousterian culture. As to the age of oldest Upper Paleolithic cultures from the Russian Plain, which occasionally do contain Mousterian-like and Szeletian-like artifacts: In the course of last year's geological investigations in Kostenki region, in the Desna basin, in Volyn, and elsewhere, no Upper Paleo- lithic strata older than Paudorf time were identified. This is in part corroborated by the radiocarbon dating evidence. Layer 5 of Kostenki I seems to be no older than Paudorf. The Sungir site near Vladimir is obviously of post-Paudorf age, although the culture layer may be somewhat older than the 14,600 ?600 years (Ivanova, 1965c; 148-52). I am far from the thought of solving the problems of the dispersal of Paleolithic cultures throughout Eastern Europe, but I would like to point out certain facts for the Russian Plain (without involving the regions far to the south): 1) This territory was rather densely inhabited in Mousterian time (Riss- Wurm? first half of Wiirm). 2) There is no reliable evidence for an Upper Paleolithic earlier than Paudorf time. 3) During the Paudorf and sub- sequent periods, distinctive Upper Paleo- lithic cultures developed over a large part of the Russian Plain. In certain of them, isolated archaic elements were preserved for a long time. 4) In late-glacial times (15,000- 11,000 years ago), the Russian Plain was extensively occupied by Late Paleolithic people. In this period, an earlier-con- ceived tradition of building dwellings out of mammoth bones became widely popular. by RICHARD G. KLEIN* Evanston, Ill., U.S.A. 13 iII 67 Valoch has admirably attempted to bring together in one article a large quantity of information on the Pleistocene prehistory of Central and Eastern Europe. The article is written in the respectable tradi- tion wherein it is supposed that the principal task of the Pleistocene pre- historian is to reconstruct culture history through an evaluation of differences and similarities among stone artifact assem- blages from various times and places. To the non-specialist, articles written in this tradition must appear to contain a be- wildering array of site names and tool types and very little about human beings and their activities in the past. Without wishing to belittle Valoch's splendid effort, I feel that if Pleistocene prehistory is to be anything more than an intellectual pursuit for a small number of highly specialized scholars, it is essential that more effort be directed towards gaining information about actual human be- havior in the Pleistocene. In my opinion, multivariate statistical procedures such as those used by Binford and Binford (1966) and Freeman (1964, 1966) offer the greatest promise in this regard. I will limit my further comments on Valoch's paper to one. This is that the humic beds encountered in the colluvial deposits overlying the second terrace at Kostenki on the Don are not fossil soils as stated by Valoch. Rather, they are beds of redeposited humuc (Lazukov 1957, Rogachev 1957, Velichko 1957). There- fore, they cannot be directly correlated with in situ soil formations elsewhere in European Russia or in Central Europe. Further, they cannot be assumed to have originated during an interstadial, and the cultural horizons which occur in them cannot constitute proof that the Upper Paleolithic began on the Don, as perhaps elsewhere, in an interstadial. All this should be made quite explicit in any discussion of the Kostenki group of sites. by B. KLIMA* Brno, Czechoslovakia. 20 xi 67 The author shows how Paleolithic re- search in the areas under consideration has changed in the past few years and how earlier conceptions of the chronology have been modified. Nevertheless, we can see in his article that some of the periods are still not clearly defined. Most of the cultures, if narrowly defined, can only roughly be placed in chronological order, and when an attempt is made to relate cultural-historical patterns, mainly classi- fied typologically, to stratifigraphy the results are sometimes even contradictory. For this reason, the author has often been forced to offer alternative hypotheses. How rapidly a conception can change is demonstrated in the fact that since the submission of Valoch's manuscript, new aspects have already appeared. One of these is the idea, quite correct in my opinion, that the typical mammoth-hunt- ing culture of the upper Paleolithic ori- ginated in Central Europe (Grigoriev, 1966). This idea, first offered some time ago, has recently been made more con- crete by C14 dates (Klima, 1967). The development of the cultures proceeded in a much more complicated manner than was earlier believed, due to a number of influences (among them natural factors) resulting in faster cultural change in par- ticular areas and periods and irregular distribution of settlements. Such cultural centers as, for example, the Kostienki region, Southern Moravia, the Dordogne, etc. developed independently of each other; one cannot underestimate this fact. How little research in the Paleolithic field has yet been done and how risky our deductions sometimes are is indicated by the fact that the discovery of new sites,. the collecting of new materials, or re-- search in other scientific disciplines can change the chronological system in just a- few years. Nevertheless, we are justified in, and even committed to, constructing- new conceptions. The compiling of this material by Valoch is the more worth- while for us because it also includes the East European areas, in which the Paleo- lithic often evolved along diversified lines. by JANUSZ K. KOZLOWSKI* Cracow, Poland. 15 VIII 67 So extensive is the scope of the paper by Valoch that it is impossible to discuss all the problems dealt with in it, however interesting and often controversial they may be. Therefore, I shall confine myself to several selected questions, especially those more closely connected with the territory of Poland. The Middle Paleolithic of Central and Eastern Europe has not yet been treated in a monograph based upon uniform criteria of typological and technological classification, for such criteria have yet to be developed. We need, for example, uni- form criteria for the typological classifica- tion of diagnostic forms for the Central European Mousterian industries, with special attention to such forms as the bifacial knife-scrapers of the Bockstein- schmiede, Konigsaue, Pradnik, Staro- selje, Sukha Metchetka, and other types. These tool types, mentioned here by way of example, have some characteristics in common, e.g., bifaciality, general shape, some asymmetry of the working part, and, in some specimens, truncated blades, but at the same time they differ in certain very essential typological and, especially, technological elements, e.g., the way of forming the tip, among other methods by the burin technique, as in the case of knives of the Pradnik type. The typology of indicators can not constitute a starting point for an adequate grouping of indus- tries until it has been standardized. This effort should be a collective one on the part of a number of investigators. The typological symposia initiated by Prof. Schwabedissen well illustrate the needs and enormous difficulties in this area. Under the circumstances, it is difficult to use statistical typological criteria for the classification of Mousterian industries in Central and Eastern Europe. The essential starting point for the generally accepted divisions of Mousterian indus- tries in Western Europe was the typo- logical index of side-scrapers (IR). This index shows far less stability in the indus- tries of Eastern and Central Europe, par- ticularly in inventories which are marked by the same group of indicators, e.g., the presence of knives of the Pradnik type. An additional difficulty arises from the fact that these tools are sometimes re- 376 CURRENI' ANTrHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="27">garded as bifacial side-scrapers, some- times as hand-axes. Even when they are classified with the side-scrapers, however, the indices obtained do not fall within the quantitative ranges characteristic of the IR in Western Europe. This situation is exemplified by two inventories marked by the presence of specific bifacial forms -and knife-scrapers of the Pradnik type, namely Krakow-Wawel (Ginter, Kowal- ski, and Kozlowski 1967) and Ciemna Cave (data after the paper by Morawski), which represent the two extremes of the vcycle of Pradnician industries. Both these inventories belong to the industries with Pradnik knives of the Levalloisian tech- nique (IL for Krakow-Wawel, 58.2; for Ciemna Cave, 43.07), the latter being, in addition, characterized by the Leval- loisian typology (ILty = 37.16). As re- gards the IR, on the other hand these inventories differ extremely (see Table 1). The difference between the IR within this one group of inventories and one technological facies is comparable to the difference between Mousterian Group I (Charentian) and Group III as defined by Bordes. Similar fluctuations can also be seen in the index of hand-axes (IB) and that of Group III, which, however, unlike IR, seem to proceed consistently as the whole industrial cycle evolves. A decrease in the IB with the evolution of the cycle is evidenced by the stratigraphic sequence of the Wylotne rock-shelter (Chmielewski 1965: 84-85) and by the zero value of this index in the upper layer of Ciemna Cave, which is the latest in the whole cycle. The index of Group III increases throughout the cycle, reaching 18.64 in Ciemna Cave. In view of these difficulties, one must be careful not to attribute too much uni- formity to groups of industries established on the basis of one set of indicators only (e.g.), Valoch's Mousterian group with bifacial tools. One should also be cautious when determining the relationship of such a group (or groups) to the Western European divisions, especially as regards units existing only in theory (e.g., Charen- tian with hand-axe tradition). The second group of Mousterian inventories distinguished by Valoch seems still more complex. He refers it to the typical Mousterian (dividing it into two subgroups, one with tools of small size and the other with tools of normal size), for the IR (ess) (e.g., Tata, 52.0; Krapina, over 55; Sipka, with an index of 37, is an exception) and are marked by the pres- ence of bifacial tools (Tata) or their absence (Bojnice) and often also by a high index (up to 15) of Group III. A common feature of these inventories (excepting Sipka) is the frequent production of tools on natural stones or pebble tools (e.g., at Tata, Krapina, Nandru, and sites in Western Slovakia). This last fact, along TABLE 1 COMPARISON OF FLAKES FROM EARLY PALAEOLITHIC SITES IN TERMS OF Two METRICAL INDICED MEAN MEAN SIZE OF SITES RELATIVE THICKNESS OF SAMPLE THICKNESSa BUTT (MM) Swanscombe Acheulian 23.37 5.36 235 Hundisburg 21.90 6.27 58 Swanscombe Clactonian 33.76 13.17 256 Mlazice 33.49 13.26 18 Clacton 31.08 9.78 177 Wangen 29.81 9.91 35 Wallendorf 28.43 11.47 76 a Expressed as a percentage of the longest dimension. with the presence of side-scrapers that resemble the Pontinian ones, suggests dis- tinct southern references. For this reason I should be inclined to treat it (except for Sipka), not as analogous to the typical Mousterian, but rather as a kind of southern variant, with specific typological and technological characters, of the "east- ern" Quina. (In this I agree with Gabori and Csank [1967].) Some of its inventories do include, in addition to tools typo- logically similar to these discussed above and a high IR (e.g., in Subalyuk Cave, lower horizon, 50, upper horizon, 60 [Kadi6 1940]), a fairly distinct group of Mousterian points (Subalyuk Cave, lower horizon, 24%, upper horizon, 7%) which on account of its Levalloisian technique gives these inventories a typical Mous- terian appearance. This may be due, however (and this seems to be Valoch's view insofar as Subalyuk Cave is concerned), to the influence the Moustero- Levalloisian industries of Southeastern Europe of the Dniestr, Bacho-Kiro, and Macedonian-Peloponnesian types. The territorial range of industries of this group and the range of those indus- tries which, taking into consideration all the qualifications, may be regarded as based on the inventories of the Antonow- ka I, Czokurcza, and Sukha Metchetka types are non-Levalloisian while those of the Antonowka II, Staroselje, and Khoty- levo types are Levalloisian (20 &lt;IL &lt;40). (Taking advantage of this opportunity, I wish to point out that the site of Kholodnaia Balka, often mentioned in the context of Staroselje, represents quite a different group, devoid of bifacial forms, with a fairly high IR and the Levalloisian technique of production of flakes and blades.) There is far less difference of opinion on the Upper Palaeolithic of Central and Eastern Europe than there is on the Middle Palaeolithic, largely because of the general agreement as to the main criteria of classification (Kozlowski 1965). Major controversies, however, do arise in connection with considerations of the genesis of particular Upper Palaeolithic complexes and the tracing of the autoch- thonous development of Aurignacoid in- dustries in Central Europe. Stipulating for the right to differ on these matters (Kozlowski 1966a), I shall, nevertheless, postpone the discussion of them for an- other occasion. Here, instead, I should like to draw the atuthor's attention to the fact that the Polish sites with Aurignacoid remains, which he listed in a single group, represent well-differentiated complexes (cf. Kozlowski 1966b). Piekary II (to- gether with Piekary V and the Upper Palaeolithic ensemble of Krakow-Wawel) belongs to a group marked by specific big blades, massive high flake end-scrapers, and fairly numerous burins, and in gen- eral refers to the early sites of the Dniestr Upper Palaeolithic (Babin phase). The industry from Krakow-Sowiniec corre- sponds very closely with the East Slova- kian Aurignacian ensembles (e.g., Tib- ava), whereas Gora Pulawska provides Aurignacian ensembles with a large num- ber of small armatures, something like Krems and Dufour lamelles hand-axe (? Micoquian) traditions partly coincide, namely, in Slovakia and southern Poland. Last year's discoveries in Raj Cave near Kielce indicate the presence of Mous- terian industries in the territory of Poland, going back into one of the Early Wurm interstadials (? Brorup) and charac- terized by a very high proportion of side- scrapers, especially those made on pebbles (in which they approximate typologically the sites on the Middle Danube), and by a non-Levalloisian technique, the ILam and IFs being, however, fairly high. On the other hand, I quite agree with Valoch that the presence of leaf-shaped points is not a distinctive characteristic of a separate Mousterian group, since both the groups of Mousterian industries known from Poland and distinguished here, i.e., the Prldnician group and the southern group of the "eastern Quina," Vol. 9 ;No. 5 December 1968 377</page><page sequence="28">contain leaf-shaped points (e.g., respec- tively, Okiennik Cave [Krukowski 1939: Table 4: 4] and, among other localities, Raj Cave near Kielce). These two groups of industries seem to have played some role in the genesis of the Upper Palaeo- lithic complexes with leaf-shaped points (the first of them, hypothetically, as regards the West Slovakian Szeletian, the other as regards the Danube and Bukk Mountains Szeletian). Valoch seems to have paid too little attention in his classification of Middle Palaeolithic industries to the technique of manufacturing of flakes and unretouched tools. A phenomenon similar to the division of Prldnician industries into the Levalloisian and non-Levalloisian groups (both of which arose under the same, as a rule, raw-material conditions) can be seen among the Eastern European Mous- terian industries with bifacial tools: whose statistical-typological parameters refer them to the East European facies of the Aurignacian with microlithic armatures (of Muralovka type). Now I shall deal rather at length with some aspects of the East European Upper Palaeolithic. One of the fundamental problems is the date of the beginnings of the Upper Palaeolithic in the Russian Plain. The opinion which has repeatedly appeared in literature is that the Upper Palaeolithic began later in that area than in Central Europe, i.e., not before the Paudorf ( = Stillfried B) Interstadial. However, at Gornova in the Byela River valley in the southern Urals, isolated tools, obviously Upper Palaeolithic in character, were discovered in a horizon underlying a fossil soil dated to 29,700 ? 1,250 years B.P., and thus placing the cultural horizon in the Arcy or Podhradem Interstadial (Bader 1965b). The use of the sites from the Kostienki- Borshevo region as a basis for a decision on the main geochronological problems of the Upper Palaeolithic seems, at the present stage of knowledge of their strati- graphy and geomorphology, premature. First of all, the synchronization of the sites that occur in these particular "fossil soils" is very difficult, because they are not soils formed in situ, but rather humus inter- beddings which came into existence as a result of the displacement of humus ma- terial from the slopes of the pre-Quater- nary rocks surrounding the Don valley. Moreover, the rhythm of these humus interbeddings is very uneven: two or several thin layers, varying remarkably in thickness, separated by a layer or several layers of volcanic ash. These facts, as well as the erosive processes which have disturbed the horizontal arrangement of all the strata (e.g., at Markina Gora), suggest that the classic synchronization of the sites of this region needs verification. This opinion is also supported by the radiocarbon datings obtained recently, among others those quoted by Valoch. A different situation has, however, been found on the middle Dniestr, where the profile of Molodova V exhibits a number of fossil soils formed in situ (only enriched by the solifluction from the slopes) which correspond to the pedocomplex of Still- fried B (cultural layers 7-10, the upper- most dated at 21,000 ?800 years B.P. and the ninth at 26,140? 1,000B.P.), the Pod- hradem Interstadial of the Middle Wurm (soil with cultural horizon 10a), and the Early Wurm climate oscillations (soils with Mousterian cultural horizons dated more than 40,000 years B.P.). Valoch is undoubtedly right in viewing as the foundations for development of the Upper Palaeolithic in the Russian Plain two groups of industries which evolved in that region over a comparatively long period: (a) the Kostienki-Strielecian (Sungirian) industries and (b) the "bur- in" industries with Upper Palaeolithic substrate tools-mainly burins (above all, truncated angle ones), end-scrapers, blades, and a small number of armatures on blades, but without steep retouch. To these two groups of industries I would, however, add a third one, namely, (c) the industries with Aurignacoid indicators, represented by Siuren I (lower and middle horizons), the Dniestr group (Babin phase), and possibly Radomyshl (where many Aurignacian remains are also encountered besides the Upper Pa- laeolithic substrate forms of Mousterian traditions). Further developmental stages of these industries are represented by Muralovka, Miusski Liman near Odessa, and horizons 2 and 3 of the Kostienki I site. The occurrence of Aurignacian diag- nostic artifacts in the group of end- scrapers, blades, and armatures is a dis- tinctive feature of these industries. The beginnings of this group were undoubted- ly in the cool phase (W2) preceding the Stillfried B oscillation (according to the nomenclature adopted for the Russian Plain, the Briansk Interstadial), perhaps in a Middle Wiurm interstadial (Arcy, Podhradem). Besides, the presence of one of the oldest art objects (at Muralovka, investigated by N. D. Praslov) is also associated with the Aurignacian group. The date of the appearance of the in- dustries with backed blades in the Russian Plain is controversial. The ensemble of the lower layer of the Telmanian site at Kostienki is particularly interesting in this respect. It occurs at the top of the humus interbeddings on the 18-24 m. terrace of the River Don and is marked by the presence of well-developed types of points and backed armatures and fre- quent geometric forms, also produced by the micro-burin technique. The differen- tiated typology of the backed blades and the advanced state of the technique indi- cate that this ensemble must have been preceded by a long period of develop- ment. Hence, it is very likely that the beginnings of industries with backed blades took place before the Paudor (Stillfried B) Interstadial, though we still lack material to document this develop- ment irrefutably. The further development of industries with backed blades followed several lines, based, in all probability, on their crossings with the "burin" traditions of substrate industries of Kostienki XVII type and industries with flake tools. Of the industries which developed the tradition of backed blades, the Kostienki- Avdieyevo cycle, which has not been defined clearly by the author, is of special interest. For lack of space, I can only mention, without describing in detail, the successive complexes of which this indus- trial cycle is made up: Berdyzh on Sozh, earlier than the steppe phase of Wiirm 3; Kostienki I (upper horizon, 11,750 years B.P.); Avdieyevo (? Bolling); Kostienki XIII; Kostienki XVIII; and Gagarino. The problems arising in connection with the Kostienki-Avdieyevo cycle are prob- lems of the relations between the Upper Palaeolithic of the Russian Plain and that of Central Europe and the role played in these relations by the Dniestr area; for in this area appeared the prototypes of the single-shouldered points (pointes d cran, in layer 7 of Molodova V) which later be- came common both in the Russian Plain and in Central Europe (where they occur in the West Slovakian and Lower Aus- trian groups of "East Gravettian" in- dustries). Other groups and cycles of industries with backed blades in the Russian Plain also have connections with Central Europe. Examples of such complexes in Poland are the ensemble of the upper ("East Gravettian") horizon of Mamu- towa Cave, which is fairly closely related to the sixth layer of the Molodova V site, and the industry of Maly Antoniow in the Swittokrzyskie Mountains, which corre- sponds to the late industries with backed blades and burins in the Russian Plain. Similar questions emerge towards the end of the Palaeolithic, as evidenced not only by remote influences of the Mazow- szan industries on the Crimean cycle, but also by the effects of the Grenian indus- tries of Byelorussia on the middle phase of the Mazowszan cycle in eastern and central Poland. It seems to me that Valoch has not stressed these very impor- tant instances ofconnections between Cen- tral and Eastern Europe strongly enough. by JiRI KUKLA* Prague, CZechoslovakia. 21 ix 67 Valoch's article will surely be of great interest, especially for scientists who can- not easily get publications from the Eastern European countries or who do not understand their languages. I would have welcomed, however, a slightly more critical approach to the data reviewed. Valoch might have pointed out, for 378 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="29">example, that although we know that special seasonal activities of Paleolithic man must have considerably influenced the nature of the tool inventories of briefly occupied sites, very little attention is generally paid to this fact. As for the stratigraphy, especially of the last glacial, Valoch's scheme is simple but not very fortunate. The Middle Wurm Interstadial, hinted at by so many, is here at last presented, under the title "Podhradem," as one of the most impor- tant episodes of the last glaciation. Un- fortunately, no clear evidence exists for such an interstadial in the Podhradem cave. The facts about the stratigraphy of Podhradem cave, as reported by Musil (1965), Valoch (1965b), Pelisek (1965), and Opravil (1965), are summarized in my Figure 1. The sediments which Musil and Valoch (1966) have considered as representing W 1/2, or the "Podhradem Interstadial," comprise a thick series of loam and limestone debris of unequal petrographical composition and paleon- tological content. In the inner part of the cave, the whole layer of sediments, almost 3 m. thick, has been exposed, underlying 0.6-1 m. of younger sediments layers 1-7 and resting upon 1.5-2 m. of yellow cave loess (layer 19). Two samples of charcoal embedded in soil have been dated. The first sample, GRN-1918, clearly corre- sponds to the well-defined fireplace at the base of layer 6, although the Groningen report indicates that the soil has been dated. The second sample consists of scattered charcoal fragments embedded in the humic soil of layer 8 (K. Valoch, personal communication) and not be- longing to any distinguishable hearth. These fragments were found only about 10 cm. below the intact surface of the cave fill and no more than 50 cm. above the rock base. Contamination is not only possible, but, according to Opravil (1965), more than probable; found here, far from the nearest mountains, were Pinus cf. mugo Turra, Pinus cf. cembra L., and Fagus silvatica L. Three sections may be clearly distin- guished within the so-called W 1/2 series of Podhradem cave: 1) Layers 8-10, containing fauna and flora indicative of a comparatively severe climate (Alopex lagopus, Microtus nivalis, Pinus cf. mugo). The few implements that have been found seem to correspond to the Upper Paleolithic, but they are not typical. The top layer, 8, is dated to 32- 33,000 years B.C. by a possibly contami- nated sample. 2) Layers 11-16, with a striking pro- portion of partly uncorroded limestone debris (95% at the base) and with black soils with humus content as high as 5%. A fauna which provides no evidence of climate and a few artifacts, possibly re- deposited and not indicative, were found in layer 15. This section is strongly dis- turbed by cryoturbation.

The fauna is one common in broadleaf forests (Sus scrofa) and in- cludes no elements indicative of a severe climate. At least the lower part of this section is strongly disturbed by cryotur- bation. I see no logical reason to consider layers 8-18 as corresponding to one climatic oscillation only, still less reason to date the complex by its uppermost layer and to assume that the faunal remains found are more or less contemporary. An analogous profile, in a very similar position, has been found in gve'diuv stul cave, in the neighbourhood of Podhradem (see Klima 1961, Musil 196 1). Here a dark-coloured series similar to layers 8-18 of Podhradem is dated to W 1/2, W 1, and RW and contains, in addition to Sus scrofa, Equus mosbachensis abeli, Equus hy- druntinus, and Homo neanderthalensis (Van- ur-a 1965). Dicerorhinus sp. is reported from unstratified position. All the avail- able evidence favours a parallel between this dark loam series and that of Pod- hradem. I must take this opportunity to warn once again against the danger of deriving incorrect stratigraphic schemes from the sediments in horizontal caves (Kukla and Lozek 1958). When excavated and evalu- ated by present methods, these sediments cannot yield detailed records of Pleisto- cene stratigraphy, for the following reasons: 1) Except in talus fans in the en- trances or under the chimneys, the sedi- mentation rate is very low, seldom ex- ceeding 5 cm. per 1,000 years, and it decreases rapidly with the distance from the entrance. Therefore the frequent retreat of the cave entrance caused by deepening of the valley results in low stratigraphical value of the older sedi- ments. 2) There is intensive redeposition of older sediments and theirfaunal and archeo- logical remains, increasing with distance from the entrance. Burrowing animals and collapse of lower levels of the cave system greatly contribute to the distur- bance of the fill. Since conditions favour the preservation of faunal remains, it is usually impossible to recognize bones as redeposited. 3) Cryoturbation deeply disturbs the fill (Alimen 1950, Prosek 1951). Slides of muddy soil are sometimes transported deep into the cave, slipping over the inclined icy bottom of the gallery. The methods of evaluation generally used are too rough for such complicated conditions. As a result, mixed faunas, in- cluding forest, steppe, and arctic elements (Musil and Valoch 1966), or mixed collections of implements are described. Only very careful separate evaluation of autochthonous finds, such as bones in Vol. 9 -No. 5- December 1968 379</page><page sequence="30">anatomical position, undisturbed accu- mulations of microfauna or molluscs, artifacts or burned bones inside hearths, etc., can show us the way out of this un- pleasant situation. Unfortunately, most of our information on the Middle and Early Wurm in Europe comes from caves. Substantial changes in our conception of this period must therefore be expected in the future. by G. C. MOHAPATRA* Chandigarh, India. 22 iii 68 A comprehensive study of the Central and East European lithic culture complex was long overdue. Valoch has rendered a valuable service to world prehistory by synthesising the latest results obtained from this region. In order to put the evolution of the Palaeolithic in Central and Eastern Europe in proper perspec- tive, he has compared his observations with the Western European material. Similar comparisons, however brief, with data collected from Africa and Asia would have been appreciated by those of us who are interested in general trends of develop- ment of prehistoric cultures all over the globe. Nevertheless, the detailed study of minute regional distinctions has its merits and will be appreciated by specialists. Such regional studies, which are steadily gaining popularity due to their critical approach, invariably highlight the pecu- liarities of each culture. These peculiari- ties are more or less due to different ecological setups, and therefore, if a cul- ture is to be interpreted in relation to its environment, it is they, and not the over- simplified general trends of prehistory of the textbooks, that should be magnified, analysed, and compared. On this account Valoch's efforts are praiseworthy. Valoch finds more differences than similarities in comparing the Palaeolithic cultures of Central and Eastern Europe 'with those of Western Europe. Of course the results are still far from crystalised; but if Valoch's views still hold good when lithic research in this region has reached maturity, a recasting of the lithic ter- -minology will become imperative. Some of us in India are trying to interpret the lithic cultures of this subcontinent against their own regional background. Like the Pan-African prehistorians, we have broken away from the conventional lithic terminology and have developed a new one strictly for use in Indian contexts. That Valoch is aware of the problem of terminology and is trying to take steps in this direction is attested by his substitution of the term "Final Palaeolithic" for "Mesolithic"; the latter term has, he says, "'only the authority conferred by tradi- tion." His own division of the Palaeolithic into five phases (Early, Middle, Upper, Late, and Final) is, however, neither -traditional nor discerning. The use of the term Palaeolithic in Western Europe has strict chronological implications: the end of the Palaeolithic coincides with the end of the Pleistocene. Therefore, Valoch's "Final Palaeolithic" should be termed something other than Palaeolithic if he intends to use the traditional Palaeolithic terminology in its pure form. In India we have faced similar problems and, in an attempt to deal with them, have coined the broad terms Early, Middle, and Late Stone Age, which roughly correspond, chronologically, to the Lower Palaeo- lithic, the Middle and Upper Palaeo- lithic, and the Mesolithic and Neolithic respectively (Mohapatra 1962: 59). I cite the Indian instance because at a number of points the Indian lithic indus- tries are closely comparable to the in- dustries in certain parts of Central and Eastern Europe. For instance, the pebble- tool industry with its characteristic plain wide-angel flake accompaniment (the Buda industry of the Germany-Rumania region) closely corresponds to the So- hanian pebble-tool industry of East Pun- jab (Mohapatra 1966). The Middle Palaeolithic of South and West Germany, in which "the Levallois types (points, blades, cores) and the Levallois technique (prepared striking-platform) are almost completely absent," is very similar to the Middle Stone Age culture complex in India; though not completely absent, the Levallois types and the technique are observable in negligible amounts here in what is predominantly a small flake-tool culture (Mohapatra 1959, 1962). The Upper Palaeolithic is a period of extreme specialisation in tool-types, as a consequence of the different environ- mental requirements of different regions. Therefore, it is very natural that the lithic industries of the Upper Pleistocene (Wiirm Glacial) should vary widely from region to region. This is observable in a comparison of the Upper Pleistocene lithic industries of India with those of Western Europe. Valoch's paper shows that, nearer home as well, the lithic in- dustries of this period are peculiarly local products. Therefore, Valoch's question, "Is an Early Upper Palaeolithic corre- sponding chronologically to those of Central and Western Europe absent in Eastern Europe ?", although very per- tinent, does not go far enough; for unless the "absence" of an Early Upper Palaeo- lithic is indicated by a cultural hiatus, then any local culture may represent it. As I have suggested above, it is futile to search for exact equivalents, since no two regions are alike. There has been in the past an uncritical overemphasis on gener- al similarities (sometimes superfluous) between industries found continents apart. This has obscured the true picture, especially of the genesis and the individual peculiarities of a culture, and has at various times been profitably exploited by the exponents of hyper-diffusionism. bY KARL J. NARR* Muinster/ Westfalen, Germany. 15 ix 67 Obviously lack of space prevented Valoch from adequately presenting either the material itself or even sufficient refer- ences; and the specialist who knows the basis of his views is similarly restricted by lack of space for an adequate discussion. To dwell on minor points would not do justice to Valoch's courageous essay, so I shall restrict my comment to some general remarks. 1) Valoch's chronology of the Pleisto- cene period is a serviceable working hypothesis for his purpose, though I think that the pre-Eemian part of his table is much too detailed in view of recent dis- cussions. I agree in general with his sub- division of the last glacial period, but I object to some of the terminology. Above all I think it is impossible to name the period between ca. 40,000 and 32,000 B.P. "G6ttweig." Here Valoch follows Movius (1960), who relied mainly on Gross and on Woldstedt and disregarded opposed views emerging from fieldwork in the Central European type regions (see also CA2:427-54). In the meantime, even Gross has discarded his old views, e.g., in a rather misleading article in CA (7: 239-42), on which I shall someday write a separate comment. 2) My opinion about the dating of several finds and archaeological entities differs from Valoch's. However, I shall refrain from a discussion since it would amount mainly to a shortened version of what I have said elsewhere (e.g., Narr 1963, 1967). 3) Valoch requests more statistical studies for the middle Palaeolithic of Central and Eastern Europe and suggests some statistical differentiations, e.g., the relative amount of side-scrapers. We do not know, however, what phenomena of the historical reality are reflected by such statistical data. I am not sure that the curves always represent groups or stages (see Narr 1956 and, for a general evalua- tion of the "statistical method," Narr 1967). The old cynical gradation "lies --damn lies-&gt;statistics" may well apply, to a certain degree, to some archaeo- logical statistics, whose basis is often not "objective" (e.g., Bordes's distinction between "pointe" and "racloir conver- gent"; see de Heinzelin 1960 and also the ironical illustration by Laurent 1965) and whose interpretation is at present one-sided. Incidentally, since Valoch pays due attention to the work of G. Bonc- Osmolovskij, it seems worthwhile to men- tion that this scholar used statistics, e.g., the different percentages of side-scrapers, to compare the strata of Kiik Koba with those of important sites in France as early as 1926 (see summary by Hancar 1937). 4) There is a current trend to reject the concept of "migration" and to restrict '380 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="31">Valoch: PALAEOLITHIC IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE "diffusion." This is a highly complex and difficult question. As I have said elsewhere (e.g., Narr 1963, 1966), I cannot help feeling that the term "migration" has become colored by the concept (or mis- concept) of "migration period" in Euro- pean history and that some authors equate "migration" with ,"mass migra- tion" or "conscious and purposeful migra- tion across long distances. " Climatic changes and the shifting of ecologic zones during the Pleistocene period must have caused, at least, much "migration" by slow drifting of small groups. (I am sure that only lack of space prevented Valoch from adequately evaluating the ecologic factors determining, fostering, or hamper- ing the course of events.) As regards "diffusion" versus "autochthonous de- velopment," Valoch obviously is fully aware that these processes do not exclude one another in the forming of cultural entities. However, when discussing such questions, we must not neglect a certain "hierarchy" of cultural elements and must place more emphasis on clearly defined types (e.g., keeled scrapers, split- base points, let alone styles of art) than on less definite forms, which are more likely to be "invented" or "developed" in more than one region and in more than one period. Some attempts to derive, e.g., the Aurignacian from "local roots" are neglecting this principle. (Statistics by their very nature tend to level the different values of phenomena!) 5) It is one of the most urgent, though difficult, tasks of Palaeolithic archaeology to desistfrom reconstruction of past events on the basis of mere typological (including statistical) analysis. We must try to con- sider all available information on the economy, habitat, settlement patterns, and even styles of art, hints on religion, and so on (see also Narr 1954: 30-34 and 1965: 9). Unfortunately these are scarce or even lacking in many instances and often enough remain very uncertain. Of course, a short essay like that of Valoch cannot aim at a detailed presentation and thorough evaluation of this kind of source. Nevertheless, it must be emphasized that the mere forms and techniques of artifacts may lead us to reconstructions of little bearing on relevant cultural conditions and historic events. Oakley (1952: 297) rightly stated that . .. if, with the aid of a Wellsian time- machine, we could actually meet Acheulian people in South Africa and compare them with their contemporaries at Swanscombe, we might be astonished by the differences. This certainly applies to other Palaeolithic industries and across shorter distances too. by JIRI NEUSTUPNII Prague, Czechoslovakia. 2 x 67 It seems logical that the pebble tools found across large expanses of Central Europe are variants of the most ancient form of man-made tools. The Vertes- szollos industry too seems to fit this primitive pattern, though its tools are made of much smaller pebbles than is usual. The differences between pebble industries may reflect the fact that the shapes of tools became set only gradually with the development of abstract thinking of their makers. We must be careful, however, in the search for the beginnings of tool production to concentrate upon the study of assemblages from camp sites with reliable stratigraphical data; at least some of the tools must show traces of intentional working; and the assemblage must be associated with other evidence of man's life and activity (bones of animals hunted, fire, etc). Isolated finds and finds that do not meet these requirements are nevertheless important in that they stimu- late further excavation and investigation. It is not possible to decide definitely whether the settlement of the Paleolithic was continuous or whether there occurred shifts or even replacements of populations in Central and Eastern Europe. The author rules out the possibility of large- scale and sudden migrations in the Upper Paleolithic, admitting only slow shifts and the diffusion of archaeological pheno- mena. Since mankind did not originate in Central and Eastern Europe, it is clear that people must have come there from elsewhere; but they hardly came in a single wave. We must always take into account the possibility of peripheral shifts resulting in the extension of the settlement area (Gjessing 1964). Large-scale and sudden migrations are not probable at such an early stage of mankind's develop- ment, except under unusual circum- stances such as environmental or climatic changes. The conclusive archaeological evidence is still missing, but it seems probable that the Paleolithic hunting and food-collecting populations and their archaeological industries developed with- in their original territories, if not during the whole Paleolithic, at least in its Middle and Upper phases (Zebera 1958, Neustupny 1961: 22, 26, 30). If the assumption of a typological de- velopment from the Lower Paleolithic hand-axes to the Middle Paleolithic points and further to the Early Upper Paleolithic leaf-shaped points is correct, then there is a gap in this development in Central and Eastern Europe, because hand-axes of the Abbevillian-Acheulean type are found in large numbers in the western part of Europe only. Further the author includes the Middle Paleolithic of the eastern part of Central Europe in the so-called East-European group of the typical Mousterian because it seems to have lacked the necessary preconditions for the appearance of leaf-shaped points -which, however, he considers as in- digenous. Does this mean that we are not yet sufficiently informed about the role of hand-axes in the Lower Paleolithic and of Mousterian points in the Middle Paleo- lithic in Central and Eastern Europe? There is no reason to suppose that there were large-scale migrations of populations bearing a Mousterian with bifaces to Central and Eastern Europe, where they might have given rise to the domestic development of leaf-shaped points. The Aurignacian, Szeletian, and Ols- chewian may have been contemporaries, but only in separate regions. In primitive hunting and food-collecting society, the coexistence of several alien groups in the same region is hardly probable. There are some indications, however, that these could be simply local facies of the same civilisation, for parts of the industries are identical (see Neustupny and Neustupny 1961: 22-23), indeed the author himself points out the close ties between the Aurignacian and Olschewian and hints at the possibility that they represent two facies of the same civilisation. In the future the historical relations between the Aurignacian, Szeletian, and Olschewian will have to be traced from all possible viewpoints: owing to the limited vari- ability of the material, the archaeological criterion is not necessarily decisive. Though the Balkan Peninsula belongs geographically to Southeastern Europe, I would like to draw attention to its ties with Central and Eastern Europe. A number of archaeologists (e.g., Milojcic 1958, de Sonneville-Bordes 1965, Puljanos 1963) have argued for the existence of Middle Paleolithic and Mousteroid in- dustries in Greece; but the finds from the Pineios River valley in Thessaly bear a surprising resemblance to the finds from the Aurignacian-Szeletian orbit in Cen- tral Europe, and the same seems to be true of the fnew finds from the western part of Peloponnesus (Servais 1961). The author divides his "later Upper Palaeolithic" into the Pavlovian (for- merly the Eastern Gravettian), dated 28,000-24,000 B.P., with a late phase (Sagvar and Arka in Hungary) dated to 19,000-13,000 B.P., and the Magda- lenian. He does not specify the temporal relations between them. He mentions the absence of Magdalenian sites of Lower Austria, Moravia, and southern Poland. Is it not possible that here the Pavlovian was not replaced by the Magdalenian, but only altered by Magdalenian in- fluences coming from the west (Neu- stupny 1963) ? A direct and simple suc- cession of the Magdalenian to the Pav- lovian would leave a gap in the settlement of the eastern part of Central Europe. It will be the task of future research to ascertain the relations between the Pav- lovian (Gravettian) and the western Magdalenian, and to establish every- Vol. 9 No. 5 December 1968 381 B</page><page sequence="32">where the late phases of the Pavlovian. Where neither the Magdalenian nor its influence is found, the late Pavlovian must have persisted. To the late Paleolithic groups discussed by the author must be added the Ostro- mer group, which in Bohemia and Moravia is very close to the Polish Tar- nowian, but which, according to Vencl (1966: 338), has no relation either to the Magdalenian, the Epi-Magdalenian, or the "Federmessergruppe." The author's introduction of the term "Late Palaeolithic" may be justified, because this period does have some features which set it apart from the pre- ceding Upper Paleolithic; it can appar- ently be defined archaeologically, geo- logically, paleontologically, etc. Renam- ing the period generally termed the Meso- lithic "Final Palaeolithic", on the other hand, seems at best premature. It is necessary to take into account not only the character of its industries but other important aspects as well: changes in the artistic expression, changes in settlement and economy, and the trend of further development. Like others, I used to speak of the Epi-Paleolithic instead of the Meso- lithic; but this was at a time when the classification of archaeological industries was considered the only criterion for the division of prehistory into periods. Using other criteria as well, the term "Final Paleolithic" might appropriately be ap- plied to the East and Central European Mesolithic. Any such change of name, however, must take into consideration the neighbouring regions too. The Near East, including the southern tip of the Balkan Peninsula, witnessed in the Meso- lithic, or perhaps as early as in the late Upper Paleolithic, that revolutionary change in the economy of prehistoric mankind, the transition from hunting and food-collecting to agriculture. The pre-ceramic horizon (the aceramic Neo- lithic) in the Near East may in fact be a developed Mesolithic, in which the changes that came into full view in the succeeding Neolithic were in preparation. That is why I think that the firmly estab- lished archaeological term "Mesolithic" should be retained. The renaming can wait until archaeology works out a his- torically based division of European and world prehistory into periods. So far few such attempts have been made (but see, e.g., Jennings and Norbeck 1964 for the New World). Valoch's concluding synthesis gives a clear overall picture of the stone indus- tries and thus forms the archaeological basis for a historical conception of the beginnings of mankind's development in Central and Eastern Europe. Such a historical conception, however, would have to comprise all the historically im- portant factors: the natural environment of prehistoric men, the means of sub- sistence, dwellings, arts, anthropological problems, and many others. The author could not include them in his work, because its extent is limited. This com- ment, too, had to be kept within certain limits, and therefore I have mentioned only a few facts supplementing the author's conclusions. I could not mention the many conclusions with which I agree. Some important works not included in the author's list of references deserve a brief mention here: Synthetic works: Banesz (1965c), Bairta (1954), Klima (1957), Neustupny (1959, 1962), Prosek and Lozek (1954), Zebera (1958); Mono- graphs: Bader (1965), Feustel (1959), Klima (1957), Kukla (1961), Neustupn'y (1963), Prosek (1961), Vencl (1966). Fundamental general works by the archaeo- logists of the last generation who laid grounds for the present development of archaeology: Absolon (1935, 1949), Bayer (1925), Breuil (1923-25), Obermaier (1928). The most important works on the Paleolithic of Greece are the following: Garrod (1939), Milojcic (1958), Puljanos (1963), Servais (1967), Skutil (1950), de Sonneville-Bordes (1965). by JOHN PFEIFFER- New Hope, Pa., U.S.A. 6 iii 68 As an up-to-date survey of the Palaeo- lithic in Central and Eastern Europe, Valoch's article helps fill a major gap in our knowledge; publishing such articles is just what CURRENT ANTHRO- POLOGY should be doing. It will be of special value to those attempting to fit information from Southwestern Europe, and particularly from France, into a broader framework. A most important point is alluded to in passing and perhaps merits further em- phasis. The fact that Bordes's statistical method has been used in a preliminary analysis of Middle Palaeolithic tool assem- blages in the Crimea and on the Russian Plain has significance as a move toward quantitative approaches which, we may hope, will be extended and make possible increasingly sophisticated comparative studies involving assemblages from differ- ent regions. It would be interesting to learn, either from correspondence or from another article, how extensively Bordes's method and related methods are being applied in Europe and elsewhere. by PHILIP E. L. SMITH* Montreal, Canada. 13 iii 68 Valoch is to be congratulated and thanked for this excellent work of syn- thesis. Prehistorians who are themselves residents and specialists in Central and Eastern Europe will undoubtedly be able to discover errors of fact or of interpreta- tion, but those prehistorians of other countries who are largely unable to visit the sites and collections or even, often enough, to read the publications must feel a debt of gratitude for what will surely be recognized as a classic survey article. From the substantive point of view it is a most valuable paper. Many of Valoch's hypotheses are stimulating and provocative, e.g., his discussion of the origins of the Aurignacian. His pc-ition on group movements vs. local develop- ments is a very reasonable one, and there is a welcome absence of polemics in dis- cussing the factors involved in cultural changes and replacements. His view that purely Western European terms such as Solutrean and Tardenoisian should not be pushed across to Eastern Europe is very sound; perhaps the same caution should be exercised for the term Tayacian, which Valoch does use freely. I shall limit my comments to a few points, although there are many others I should like to discuss, e.g., the present dispute over the nature of the Upper Palaeolithic "houses" in the U.S.S.R., or Valoch's use of the term Final Palaeolithic instead of Meso- lithic. I wish Valoch had spent a little time to indicate the methodological basis for his archaeological units, i.e., just what he means by such terms as civilization, in- dustry, etc. A number of prehistorians in the countries discussed in this paper are today examining and debating the use of archaeological terminology (e.g., Schild 1965); it would have been helpful in evaluating some of Valoch's statements to have had some idea of his own inter- pretation of such terms. Although I hold no particular brief for Kozlowski's hypo- thesis of Proto-Magdalenian in Central and Eastern Europe, I am puzzled that Valoch rejects its possible presence at one site (Stanca Ripiceni) "because of its antler artifacts, which are considered peculiar to the Pavlovian" (p. 363). If I understand his statement properly, surely this is taking a somewhat restricted view of the definition of prehistoric archaeo- logical units. Also, the meaning of his term typogenetic is not altogether clear to me. Valoch pays very little attention to en- vironmental and ecological aspects and concentrates almost entirely on typo- logical and chronological ones. Neverthe- less, even a necessarily condensed article such as this one could have benefited from a brief discussion of some of the studies which have already been attempted by prehistorians of Central and Eastern Europe: for example, the distinction which Boriskovski (1965) makes in the Ukrainian Upper Palaeolithic between two main groupings-one in the peri- glacial region, where mammoth was the main game and solidly built houses were used, the other in a less rigorous environ- ment on the southern fringes near the coast of the Black Sea, where cattle and bison were hunted and the groups were apparently more nomadic without solid or permanent structures. (One might see 382 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="33">Valoch: PALAEOLITHIC IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE in Eastern Europe another grouping as well, based on subsistence and environ- mental factors, in the Crimean and Trans- caucasian cave sites, where mixed game was the rule.) How meaningful do the typological distinctions become when ex- amined against these backgrounds? Valoch refers to the Upper Palaeolithic in theDniestr basin as exhibiting a "rather quiet, continuous evolution." On the other hand, Ivanova and Chernysh (1965) have indicated that there is a cul- tural hiatus, at least at the important site of Molodova V, between ca. 22,000 and 17,000 B.P. which was apparently the period of greatest cold in the region. I wonder if Valoch accepts his "hiatus," and if so whether it can be detected at other sites in Eastern Europe. Incident- ally, this hiatus, if generally confirmed, would be interesting insofar as a some- what similar hiatus related to climatic severity, and at approximately the same time, is claimed in the Upper Palaeolithic of the Zagros Mountains in Iraq (Solecki 1963). Indeed, the Upper and Late Palaeolithic industries (to adopt Valoch's terminology) of Eastern Europe present some very interesting analogies with the industries of the Zagros (e.g., the Bara- dostian-Zarzian group with the industries of such sites as Molodova V and some Crimean ones), and the very probable presence of the Baradostian and Zarzian in Transcaucasia indicates that Eastern and Central Europe constituted a region open at both ends-to the Middle East as well as to Western Europe-at this time. Perhaps this was less true in the Middle Palaeolithic, for the bifacial flaking and foliates found in Southeastern Europe (e.g., the Crimea and Volga regions) seem to be almost or completely absent in the Iraqi and Iranian sites. It is not clear that Valoch's comparison of the incidence of Levallois technique in Eastern and Central Europe with that of other regions is meaningful, for he gives the erroneous impression (pp. 355, 356) that prepared striking platforms are what characterize this technique. In the past a common interpretation of the Upper Palaeolithic of the South Russian Plain has been that it represented a stolid, conservative sequence of big- game hunters, remarkably homogeneous geographically and with relatively few changes occurring through time in eco- nomy, settlement locales, and even ideo- logy, i.e., a co-tradition with changes taking place throughout at roughly the same tempo (for example, see Boriskovski 1958: 319-20). There has been for some time reason to believe that this is not a wholly accurate picture. Perhaps the shifts and changes in artifact styles are less abrupt than they appear to be in WTestern Europe, but there has also un- doubtedly been a tendency in the past to play down this aspect and to emphasize cultural continuity and indigeneous de- velopments. In recognizing freely the co- existence of typologically different tradi- tions within restricted areas and in accept- ing the important role of diffusion (in- cluding "invasions" in some cases), Valoch goes a long way towards building a more reliable model of what really happened. This precision will be in- creased as finer stratigraphies are con- structed and chronometric data obtained, so that eventually the phenomena can be interpreted in processual terms accept- able to all prehistorians-that is, to pro- vide a genuine palaeoanthropology. In summary: this is a paper which furnishes very valuable information and gives us a great deal to think about. by GUNTER SMOLLA* Frankfurt/Main, Germany. 15 ix 67 Valoch must be congratulated for this very useful concise review. He is right to be as cautious as possible; but concerning the question of the earliest artifacts, his scepticism seems to me to be carried too far. G. Riek's excavations at Heidenheim- Schnaitheim should provide us with a sound basis for discussion of this question in Central Europe. Contrary to Valoch's suggestion, pebble tools and Middle Pa- laeolithic hand-axes occur together in Hessen, as in other regions of the Old World (Kruger 1962: 40). The quartzite sites in Hessen mentioned by Valoch are typical factory sites like those of Africa and Asia. I am not convinced that the term "Tayacian" is very useful for describing those tantalizing Middle Paiaeolithic in- dustries. The late M. Stekelis once told me that on the basis of his observations during the excavations carried out by Neuville, the "Tayacian" of the Oumm- Quatafa in the Judaean desert seemed to him to represent only a downward migra- tion of some of the smaller artifacts from the overlying "Acheuleen moyen" layer. I feel obliged to offer this observation without further comment. Valoch's views as to the genesis and connections of the Middle Palaeolithic industries are stimu- lating, but it must be kept in mind that they are no more than working hypo- theses. As to the duration of the Upper Palaeo- lithic, I shall say only that C14 years need not be solar years and that climatic changes may affect the time scale. I am not at all a doubting Thomas concerning C14, but I should not be surprised if the duration of some parts of the Upper Palaeolithic should prove to be some 1,000 years longer than it seems todav. Valoch likes to use the term Final Palaeolithic instead of Mesolithic; in his region this term is quite useful, but in others it is not (cf. Schwabedissen 1964). The "macrolithic" industries are not restricted to Northwestern Europe; while the term "Campignien" is gone, the crude artifacts remain in various parts of the Old World (Smolla 1960: 54-55; 1967). by D. DE SONNEVILLE-BORDES* Talence, France. 28 iii 68 The very useful paper by Karel Valoch calls for some observations about the Upper Palaeolithic in Central Europe. Aurignacian: Valoch reviews the statis- tical characteristics I established (1965) for the lithic material from layers 4 and 5 of the Vogelherd, Wurtemberg (excava- tions by G. Riek). To me, the lithic material of Vogelherd, the lower level of which has yielded numerous and typical split-base bonepoints, is typically Aurig- nacian and very homogenous. Muller- Beck (1965) finds typogenetic connections between this material and the Jerzmano- wice leaf-point industry. Indeed, he assi- milates the leaf-shaped points of the Jerzmanowician with the point-shaped, bilaterally retouched Aurignacian blades which are typical of the French Lower Aurignacian and which are represented at Vogelherd by some beautiful examples. These tools are absolutely normal in this context and have nothing to do with any cultural contamination. There are no typological reasons why the Vogelherd Aurignacian should be chronologically different from the other Aurignacian assemblages with split-base bonepoints in western Central Europe. We have established that this Aurig- nacian from Vogelherd, in contrast to the Aurignacian of Southwestern France, has no burins busques. According to Valoch, the Aurignacian from eastern Central Europe has burins busques; but are they indeed typical burins busques (bogenstichel, arched burins), that is, "dihedral burins with a burin blow opposite a series of convex-shaped burin blows, ending in a notch"? What some authors who use our typological classification have referred to by this term are in fact atypical burins busquds. From level 5 of Willendorf II, Felgenhauer (1959, part 3; Fig. 28, no. 9) shows a dihedral canted burin, with a slightly convex side, such as can be found in all the Upper Palaeolithic cultures. In his fine publication on Dolni Vestonice, what Klima shows as burins busques are also atypical ones (1963: Fig.23, nos. 273, 274; Fig. 45, nos. 663, 664). It would be better to call them "burins carenes" (cari- nate burins), as did, at the beginning of this century, the French typologists M. Bourlon and A. and J. Bouyssonie. The typological distinction is sometimes diffi- cult to make. We have discussed this prob- lem, describing and illustrating this type of burin, in a recent paper (Mommejeane Bordes, and de Sonneville-Bordes 1964). Vol. 9 No. 5 December 1968 383</page><page sequence="34">If the burins busques that Valoch indi- cates in the Aurignacian of eastern Cen- tral Europe all belong to this type, one must conclude that there are no typical burins busques in this part of Europe, just as there are none in Spain and Belgium (de Sonneville-Bordes 1961). Magdalenian: According to Valoch, the Magdalenian, originating in Western Europe, is one of the two important groups of the final Upper Palaeolithic in Central Europe (the other being the "Pavlovian"). The statistical and typo- logical study of several series of the Magdalenian from Southern Germany (de Sonneville-Bordes 1968) and Switzer- land (de Sonneville-Bordes 1963) pro- vides the following details: The Magdalenian of Southern Ger- many (Rhineland, Souab Jura) is late, as is the one from Switzerland (Schaffouse): its harpoons, its works of art (Petersfels), its lithic typology make it comparable to the Upper Magdalenian (V-VI) of France. This German-Swiss Magdalenian has some unique features as well: (a) its end-scraper, burin, and borer indices are more or less equal (each about 1/5 of the tool kit), while in France the burin index is always greater than the end-scraper index and the borers seldom account for more than 5%; (b) the indices of dihedral burins and burins on retouched trunca- tion are more or less equal, while in France the former is almost always greater; (c) parrot-beak burins, charac- teristic of the French Magdalenian VI, are totally absent; (d) besides Azilian points and thumb-nail scrapers, the series contains tools which seem more specific to this facies-rectangles; shouldered points, often with a distal truncation; and points with an angular back. It is incontestable that typological resemblances exist between the Aurig- nacian and the Magdalenian of western Central Europe and the corresponding cultures in Southwestern France and that this demonstrates cultural connec- tions between these two zones. On the other hand, these two great cultures present marked differences from those of the classical zone. Who could be as- tonished at the existence of distinct facies of cultures of such wide geographic ex- tension at a time when diversity in Europe was already well developed? by SLAVOMIL VENCL* Prague, Czechoslovakia. 7 ix 67 The general summary of the state of re- search on the Palaeolithic provided by Valoch's interesting article undoubtedly contributes to the elimination of mis- understandings caused by the traditional focusing on only a few European regions. In this respect, his paper differs rather significantly from other synthetic works, for example, Muller-Karpe (1966) and Leroi-Gourhan (1966), which are as a rule poorer in information as regards remote or linguistically less accessible regions and thus establish an erroneous idea of complete absence or paucity of Palaeolithic settlement in such regions. On the other hand, scope of this work has necessitated condensation of information to the extent that a number of important works have been omitted (for Czecho- slovakia, e.g., Banesz 1965, Klima 1961, Prosek and Lozek 1954, Zebera 1958). One would welcome, in the future, a discussion of the problems of each indivi- dual period, e.g., Late Palaeolithic, Mesolithic, at least as thorough as that of the Palaeolithic as a whole in this paper. I should like, instead of commenting on particulars, to advance a few general remarks concerning the present article as representing generally accepted opinions: 1) It is quite remarkable to observe that it is apparently easier to solve problems relating to the genesis of cultures (cf. Gallus 1966) in the Palaeolithic than to treat the same problems as regards the more recent prehistoric periods, in spite of the fact that the material sources avail- able for the Palaeolithic are considerably poorer both in quantity and in quality. While we do not know the origin of the Neolithic Linear culture or of the Bronze Age Unetice culture, in spite of the fact that thousands of stratified finds from settlements and cemeteries are available, the origin of some Palaeolithic industry (the material of which is often limited to mere surface finds or cave layers) can evidently be established simply by demon- strating some technological or morpho- logical similarity or even successive occu- pation of one and the same site (so-called geographical continuity of settlement). These "typogenetic" judgements are not even hampered by gaps of 10,000 years, as may be seen in a number of schemes linking the successive industries known today in narrow regions (such as Hungary or Central Germany) in local genetic chains (e.g., for Czechoslovakia, Zebera 1958 and 1965, and, in the present paper, the suggested relation of Tayacian and Aurignacian; cf. also Mottl 1951). It is however, obvious that the kind of judg- ment which cannot be made on the basis of richer sources, e.g., those for the Bronze Age, can hardly be made without exceed- ing the limits of the substantially poorer material sources for the Palaeolithic. The substantial reduction in quality and quan- tity of sources for this period must, on the contrary, necessarily be reflected in a reduced scope of interpretation as com- pared to the more recent prehistoric periods. The poverty of the sources (together with the inadequately detailed dating of the Palaeolithic) does not at present permit any more than very weakly supported alternative hypotheses as re- gards the origin of Palaeolithic industries (a better expression than "culture"; Narr 1963), and these hypotheses cannot pro- vide support for further interpretations (cf. in the present article the debatable opinion on the process of the origin of Homo sapiens derived from the very prob- lematic knowledge of the process of cul- tural development). 2) The meaning of such expressions as "tradition of leaf-shaped points" (often employed in connection with the genetic continuity of artifacts from the Eem and Gottweig periods) is unclear. If we con- sider the leaf-shaped point to be an im- plement (e.g., a sickle) and not a materi- alization of an abstract idea invested with an inherent will to develop, then what would the analogous expression, "tradi- tion of bronze sickles" mean in connection with the problem of the origin of indivi- dual prehistoric cultures? 3) The idea of convergent evolution, e.g., the independent origin of leaf-shaped points in various places of Europe at approximately the same time, is more an exaggerated a priori reaction to the for- merly generally accepted notion of large migrations than an objective interpreta- tion of the material sources. How, in fact, it is possible to speak seriously of conver- gent development if (a) the most accurate dating is maximally accurate within periods of a millenium, and (b) we know from the more recent prehistoric periods that a serviceable invention spreads and also changes at a rapid rate? Is it, on the basis of today's scattered sources, really possible to speak of continuity in the full sense of the word (i.e., without having to ignore gaps of several thousands ofyears) ? 4) The comparison of industries the characteristic feature of which is their atypicalness (in this article, e.g., the Baume-Bonne type of Tayacian and the Tata type of Mousterian) is questionable. Atypicalness as a basis for a comparison is in a certain sense an argument ex silentio: it does not permit one to ascertain the degree of similarity and therefore in- volves the danger that phenomena of only accidental similarity will be digested or genetically associated (Vencl 1964). 5) It is dangerous to interpret arch- aeological phenomena as substantial features of the historical process; an archaeological phenomenon can at times apparently bear witness to a situation that never existed. Valoch (1 965a) has observed that distinctive regional cultural groups (which later developed indivi- dually in the course of several more recent phases of the Pleistocene) took shape in the course of the Central European Middle Palaeolithic. The question must arise whether the existence of some of the archaeologically dissimilar cultural groups is not a pseudohistorical pheno- menon: if the Middle Palaeolithic of Central Europe employed exclusively local raw materials (hence materials differing in quantity, quality and dimen- sions) for the manufacture of industries, the archaeological difference need not 384 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="35">Valoch: PALAEOLITHIC IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE automatically signify a process of in- dependent development in a certain group of people, but may on the contrary sometimes be a purely archaeological phenomenon, demonstrating the imprac- ticability of perfectly identical shaping of raw materials of different qualities even by the same people. (There can, at the same time, be no doubt as to the objective existence of some distinctive Middle Palaeolithic groups in Central Europe.) 6) I consider the periodic succession (i.e., Upper Palaeolithic, Late Palaeo- lithic, Mesolithic) to be correct, and, in- deed, have been supporting it for some time (Vencl 1964). I doubt, however, whether it is right to replace the term "Mesolithic." It seems to me that if every shift or partial change in the meaning of a term resulted in its replacement by another one, our system of symbols would cease to be intelligible, since any change made only in consideration of present circumstances and not with a view to the future can only be a temporary one. What matters here is only the interpreta- tion of the term; Mesolithic is no longer to be considered as an independent unit on the level of Palaeolithic and Neolithic. Interest in the knowledge of historical processes has in recent years become general; but historical interpretation must correspond to the state of knowledge in the archaeology of the Palaeolithic and cannot be considered valid simply because it is an expression of contemporary, more or less generally accepted but still a priori, opinions or because it is diametrically opposed to similarly unsupported older opinions. Reply by K. VALOCH Brno, Czechoslovakia. 5 vi 68 I am very much pleased by the interest my article has evoked. I thank all the commentators for their-comments, agree- ing, complementing, and critical; I have found them very instructive. I have or- ganized my reply in terms of a number of issues under which most of the critical comments can be subsumed. I would like to say beforehand that my article was finished in the winter of 1965-66 and so does not contain sources later than 1965; that the volume of work in this area pre- cluded the detailed listing of references that Neustupny and Vencl would have wished; and that, as Collins has suggested, the translation from the original German may have caused some confusion. The over-all conception. I have taken as an indicator of the Palaeolithic of the region under consideration the stone and bone industries most frequently rep- resented by remains preserved from that time. This choice has led to a kind of history of Palaeolithic technology which lacks, as a number of the commentators (Hole, Klein, Narr, Neustupny, Smith) have correctly observed, the many other factors, ecological (topography, climate) and cultural (dwellings, funeral rites, ways of hunting, art, etc.), which must contribute to a history of mankind during the Palaeolithic period. To have included all these factors, however, would have expanded the article immensely; more- over, our concrete knowledge about most of them is so fragmentary, as Narr has pointed out, that the hypothetical charac- ter of the conclusions would not have been much altered. Even the apparently easy problem of the relationship of man to his environment is best approached by means Qf broad continental, or even supercontinental, surveys, where it is possible to speak of climatic zones, glacial or interglacial. The more detailed view with reference to specific cultures that this report would require would be diffi- cult to achieve, partly because of our lack of knowledge of the detailed chronology and of the conditions which in fact existed in the particular region, especially in such a morphologically complex region as Central Europe. In order to suggest, for example, that the concentration of sites of the Moravian Szeletian on the slopes is climatically conditioned, one must first know whether the climate of the time was a moderate, interstadial one (in which the valleys, at least, were surely wooded) or a cool, stadial one (in which either loess was being formed or the slopes were being denuded and the valleys filled by solifluction); lacking knowledge of the ages of the sites and their exact strati- graphic positions, it is impossible to say which climate prevailed, for the period these sites represent may have been as long as 10,000 years. Again, not knowing the ages of the sites on the Russian Plain, one should hesitate to interpret the differ- ences among them as regional, even with the considerable climatic difference that can surely be assumed between the area along the coast of the Black Sea and the regions to the north. Terminology. The majority of criticisms (Anati, Ghosh, Gallus, Hole, Koztowski, Mohapatra, Neustupny, Smith, Smolla, Vencl) were, quite justly, concentrated upon this point. The general lack of uni- formity in the terms used for the Palaeo- lithic and the confusion as to their mean- ings is accentuated in Central Europe by the habits peculiar to particular lan- guages. For example, in the Slavonic languages and German the term in gener- al use is "Palaeolithic culture"; in Polish, this is being replaced by "cycle" (Schild 1963, 1965), while in French the term "industry" is most frequent. My term "civilization" (once suggested by L. Zotz) is no less broad or inappropriate than the "culture" it replaces; possibly, however, the notion of "culture" in the specifically archaeological sense may yet be applic- able to the Palaeolithic (Fridrich, Klima, and Valoch 1968). The other terms I have used may be defined as follows: Industry-an assemblage of artifacts from a single layer of a given site; also, more generally, all the assemblages of a given period or region, as in the phrase "bone industry of the Magdalenian." Type-two or more industries similar both morphologically and typologically. Group-two or more industries similar in content, related (i.e., part of the same culture), and close together in time. Complex-two or more industries or groups differing in age but possibly part of the same culture. Facies-one aspect of a given culture, usually geographically defined and differ- ing typologically and/or chronologically from other aspects of that culture. The newly introduced Polish termino- logy is extremely detailed, and, in that it independently names each regional group (przemysl) of a certain cycle, it may be difficult to use, for on an all-European scale it could easily contain several hun- dred terms. Making the terminology of the Palaeolithic more accurate is an im- portant task, one that perhaps demands international co-operation (possibly with- in the framework of CA?). How difficult it is to reach agreement in such an area, however, has been shown with reference to a much simpler matter by the Sym- posium on Nomenclature of Types of Stone Tools for Central Europe to which Kozlowski refers. One of the motives for this symposium was precisely the fact that the Palaeolithic of Central Europe con- tains a whole series of forms which escape the terms and definitions valid in Western Europe. The term "typogenetic" is used by me in a double sense: (a) to describe an apparent relationship between tempor- ally consequent forms of a particular tool type (e.g., the couteau a dos of the Middle Palaeolithic and the couteau Chatelperron point of the Upper Palaeolithic in France); and (b) to describe the changes in industries from one phase to another in the quantitative representation and/or typological character of basic forms (e.g. the gradual decrease in number of scrapers and the concurrent increase in number of burins of various new forms from the Lower to the Upper Aurignacian in France and in Moravia). The conceptions "palaeoanthropo- logy" and "prehistory" have been used Vol. 9 No. 5 December 1968 385</page><page sequence="36">in the sense current in Czech and German. In English, in contrast, "Palaeo- anthropology" refers solely to the study of human skeletal remains and is in fact equivalent to "osteology of fossil man" ; "prehistory" deals with the evalu- ation of the material remains of human society from the time before written records (and is followed by protohistory and history); and "archaeology" is a set of methods for practical fieldwork the objects of which may belong to any time period, even the historical (cf. "medieval archaeology"). I am conscious of the fact that the term "Tayacian" is too vague and broad. In using it here (e.g., "Tayacian of the Baume-Bonne type, Fontechevade"), I only wanted to indicate the over-all simi- larity of these industries, not yet published or analyzed, to the published French in- dustries in order to allow the reader to form a kind of preliminary idea of their nature. I consider this to be only a tem- porary solution (cf. Valoch 1968a). The misunderstanding in the case of the Levallois technique is most likely attributable to the translation. Dibitage Levallois is apparent in the Middle Palaeo- lithic only in Southeastern Europe; in Central Europe, there is merely facettage in connection with debitage non-Levallois until the appearance of dibitage Levallois in some industries of the early Upper Palaeolithic in Moravia. The origins of the designations of the cultures of the region in question are as follows: Olschewian, from Mt. Olsheva in the Karavanki Mountains of northern Yugoslavia; Szeletian, from the Szeleta cave in Hungary; Pavlovian, from the site of Pavlov in Czechoslovakia; Kost- jenkian, from the site of Kostjenki, on the Don near Voronjezh, U.S.S.R.; Tarno- wian, from the site of Tarnow in Poland; Mazowian, from the Mazowsze region in Poland. Criticism of the terms "Late Palaeo- lithic" and "Final Palaeolithic" was ex- pected. The discovery of Late Palaeolithic industries during the past 20 years is a significant contribution of Central Euro- pean archaeology, rendering substantially more exact our knowledge about the decline of the Old Stone Age in this region. From the point of view of method- ology, the term seems to me to be fitting for the time being (cf. Neustupny, Vencl). In using the term "Final Palaeolithic," I wanted to indicate the absolute continuity of the Mesolithic with the preceding Palaeolithic, as well as the hiatus between it and the following Neolithic, in the regions described. The term cannot, of course, be applied in the Near East, where the Mesolithic really does form a link between the Palaeolithic and the Neo- lithic; nor can be applied in the more remote regions of Africa and Asia, where the concept of "Late Stone Age" has quite a different content. From the com- ments, it would appear that the Meso- lithic is defined in a number of different ways. On the basis of the geological criterion (less than 10,000 B.P.), the major part of our Late Palaeolithic would per- haps be Recent and thus Mesolithic; the climato-palaeontological criterion (the appearance of postglacial forest fauna) is conditioned by zonal distribution and therefore not usable; the much more reliable typological criterion (microlithi- zation of tools) cannot be applied here because of the uncertainty as to the occur- rence of microlithization in the Late Palaeolithic, despite the high ratio of typical microliths (triangles) in the Upper Palaeolithic (e.g., Pavlov et al.) I suggest that the economic base of society is the only division marker justified historically in this case. Muller-Beck, although he recommends retaining the term "Meso- lithic," nevertheless correctly says of the term "Neolithic" that its original chrono- logical-stratigraphic meaning has been overshadowed by its economic-cultural meaning (Grahmann and Muller-Beck 1967: 316, 319). It is only reasonable that an analogous economic-cultural meaning should be assigned to the term "Palaeolithic"; and the whole of the "Mesolithic" of Central and Eastern Eur- ope (excluding the eastern Balkans, where a pre-ceramic Neolithic appears) would fall into a Palaeolithic so defined. An alternative to this detailed division into more phases has been suggested by Lap- lace (1966), who combines the Upper, Late, and Final Palaeolithic under the single term "Leptolithic." Stratigraphy, chronology. Concerning the problems raised by Ivanov, Kukla, and Narr, I must report that recent studies in Holland (Hammen et al. 1967; Vogel and Zagwijn 1967) have demonstrated the existence of a Middle Wurm Interstadial, here called Hengelo, which coincides with our Podhradem. The somewhat more recent Denekamp Interstadial is then identical with our Stillfried B. Our hypothesis as to the existence of two such climatic oscillations in close suc- cession (Musil and Valoch 1966) is thus supported from another part of Europe. The radiocarbon dates for certain Central European sites-Dolni WVestonice brickworks, Pavlov, Podhradem, Willen- dorf II/4, Aggsbach-have been correc- ted in Groningen; a slight increase has occurred in all of them (Vogel and Water- bolk, 1964; Vogel and Zagwijn 1967). Kukla's comment is outside the frame- work of this article, as it primarily con- cerns my summary of the research done in the cave of Podhradem. Opravil (written communication) holds that dwarf mountain-fir and beech may well have occurred together in the complex conditions of the Moravian Karst and therefore their co-occurrence among the charcoal samples does not constitute proof of contamination. Musil (oral communi- cation) refers to his publication quoted above and repeats that the fauna is not redeposited (as is shown by finds of bones in anatomical position and a continuous evolution of cave bears from the lower to the upper beds). He explains the contem- poraneity of forest and steppe species as a consequence of ecological differences be- tween the Karst region and the non-karst environment. Migrations, evolution, relations. Com- ments by Anati, Gabori, Ghosh, Hopkins, Narr, Neustupny, Smith, and Vencl touch upon various aspects of these problems. One of the aspects of my refusal to employ the concept of "migra- tion" has been well grasped by Narr; the idea of diffusion seems to me more accept- able. This does not, however, at all ex- clude migration over many hundreds of kilometres within a given area (e.g., the steppes of Central Europe). I see con- tinuity of settlement also in terms of such an area. A hiatus of several thousands of years in one locality (Molodova V) does not prove that the wider area of Eastern Europe, and even the Dniestr region itself, did not contain some culture developing continuously. Again, there is for the time being a gap in the radiocarbon dates of at least 10,000 years between the Pavlovian and the Magdalenian in Czechoslovakia; in Hungary, however, Sagvar is dated in this range. In any case, the contem- poraneity of cultures (e.g., the Szeletian, the Aurignacian, and the Olschewian) in such a region must be seen in terms of a range of several thousands of years; at present there is no measure which might produce a more minute division. Vencl's critical considerations are cer- tainly justified in essence, and they are relevant not only to my article, but also to the manner of drawing conclusions from archaeological material in the Pa- laeolithic in general. Some of his com- parisons with examples of my work are not quite appropriate, but detailed dis- cussion of these is impossible here. His opinion must definitely be thought over and considered. Lower and Middle Palaeolithic. Besides the comments by Anati, Bordes, Collins, Freund, Gabori, Kozlowski, Neustupn', Pfeiffer, and Smolla, I have taken into consideration M. Brodar's letter (Ljubl- jana) and L. Vrtes' oral communication (Budapest). Brodar demands correction of the name of a site; what I have referred to as Monastir in Serbia should properly be Bitola in Macedonia. Vrtes tells me that in his opinion the chopper from Pestldrinc, which I have mentioned as a quite singular find from this site, is a pseudo-artifact, and further that he had already suggested (1965) the existence of the epi-chopper industry in the Riss/ Wurm Interglacial. Concerning the Heidelbergian, I now believe that the finds uncovered by Rust 386 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="37">Valoch: PALAEOLITHIC IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE and Zebera may be seen as human tools (cf. Grahmann and Muller-Beck 1967). It is a matter of fact that both Central and Eastern Europe are relatively poor in Lower Palaeolithic materials; but it is also a fact that the very extensive present- day research is continually producing new pieces of knowledge. In this connec- tion I might also mention the discovery of implements together with an Upper Biharian fauna at the site of Strainska skala, near Brno, Czechoslovakia (Musil and Valoch 1968). According to Musil, these finds may come from the Gunz/ Mindel Interglacial. I have used the term "Micoquian" in the sense of Bosinki (1967), a sense in which it fits into the framework of the Polish industries ("Pradnician") and those of southern Russia. I have referred to as "Charentian of Micoquian tradi- tion" an industry having essentially the same inventory of types as the Charentian (including typical, though rather rare, Quina scrapers) but containing in addi- tion some elements of the Micoquian. According to Bosinski's definition, this latter industry would be a Central Euro- pean Micoquian. Upper Palaeolithic. The comments by Bordes, Collins, Delporte, Freund, Gab- ori, Klima, Neustupny, Smith, and de Sonneville-Bordes are related to several questions. As regards the relationship be- tween Aurignacian and Olschewian, that these are two independent cultures is at present no more hypothetical than that they are two facies (hunting and dwelling) of a single culture. I have chosen the former alternative to point up the specific character of each of them as well as the differences between them. (According to Brodar, the site of Lokve cave is not "near Trieste," as I have stated, but near Rijeka.) The Upper Aurignacian of Moravia does in fact contain a majority of burins of the type burin carene'; I would argue, however, that the true burin busque' (arched burin) also occurs. The idea of a relationship between the Central European Aurignacian of the Krems Hundsteig type to the Pavlovian was presented, on typogenetic grounds, concurrently by Grigoriev (1966) and Laplace (1966). I have recently offered my own point of view, including a sum- mary of the chronological deficiencies of this hypothesis (1968b). At the same time, I expressed my opinion concerning the contents and volume of the Pavlovian suggesting that, within the framework of the gravettoid industries (industries d lame a dos) extending all over Europe, it constitutes an independent regional group. Its development, like that of all the other recent groups, includes a series of phases distinguishable chronologically and typologically. The question of simi- larity between certain of the industries (e.g., that of Dolni Vestonice) and the French Perigordian will still have to be studied. The problem of the Proto-Magdalenian involves chronology. If the French Proto- Magdalenian is, as Bordes suggests in his comment, the "Final Perigordian" (ca. 20,000 years B.P., abri Pataud), then layer 9 of Molodova V, dated to 28- 29,000 B.P. (according to Ivanova's com- ment), must belong to a very early phase of the "Eastern Gravettian." The "baton de commandement" (baton perce) occurs, even in the region described, earlier than in the Magdalenian (Molo- dova V/7, Predmosti, Pavlov), but along with several other bone objects it consti- tutes a set typical of the Magdalenian of Central Europe.
