Maurer, Director , University of Michigan Museum of Art The Department of African, Oceanic, and New World Cultures of the Detroit Institute of Arts has been fortunate to add to its growing collection of Native American art two outstanding carved and painted wooden masks from the Northwest Coast (figs. 1 and 6). The art produced by the peoples- the Nootka, Haida, Kwakiutl, Tsimshian, and others (see map, p. 91)- who inhabit the northern Pacific coast and its offshore islands has long been recognized as one of the most highly developed in the Americas, and in its technique and quality must be ranked among the world's most accomplished creative traditions. Masks have been an important type of ritual sculpture in cultures throughout the world - since the early prehistoric periods. As objects of mystery and power, they are the ultimate symbolic element in the dramatic transformation of the ritual performer into the character, spirit, or personification represented. Along the Northwest Coast, masks were made by all of the tribal groups and were used in a variety of ceremonies that celebrated the traditional myths and histories of the people. A special category of mask also served to represent the spiritual guides of the shamanistic healers. By virtue of their visual drama and sculptural excellence, such masks have long attracted the attention of both scholars and collectors. The examples that have recently entered the Art Institute's collection represent two of the major types of masks produced in the northern Pacific region. The Kwakiutl Dzoonokwa Mask (fig. 1) is the conventionalized image of a mythological creature and the T simshian Female Mask (figs. 6 and 8) is a more naturalistic representation of a human face, a type sometimes described as a 4 'portrait mask." The earliest European observations on these cultures were made by George W. Steller, the naturalist who accompanied Captain Vitus Bering's 1741 expedition from Russia that established the first European contact with northwestern America.1 Bering had been selected by Czar Peter the Great to explore the region beyond Russia's Pacific shores as the culmination of a steadily growing eastern expansion of his empire. The principal economic stimulus of these explorations was the lucrative trade in furs, which brought the first white men to the northern Pacific area and would quickly lead to an influx of Europeans and Americans that would have an enormous influence on the economy, culture, and art of the native populations. The records of these expedi- tions are a store of documentary evidence which provides valuable information about how the people lived before their extensive contact with Europeans. In 1778 Captain James Cook explored this coastal area during his third and last Pacific voyage. Reflecting the well- developed 18th-century European interest in the scientific gathering of empirical information, the records of Cook's expedition and many of those made by other Europeans provide us with a number of early descriptive acccounts of the natural environment of the coast and its native inhabitants. Many of the officers, naturalists, and artists who accompanied these voyages produced drawings and wrote diaries that record the land, houses, implements, clothing, physical features, art, and customs of the native peoples they encountered. The following passage was taken from the journal of David Samwell, who later became the surgeon on Cook's ship, Discovery. This is one of the earliest descriptions of carved masks as they were used in a native welcoming ceremony which took place at Vancouver Island's Nootka Sound in 1774. While Cook's ships were moored in a sheltered cove, the natives approached to greet them in beautifully crafted wooden canoes. The principal or indeed the only performer appeared in a mask which was made of wood, not badly painted in the manner they generally do their faces, of these he had two expressing different countenances which he changed every now and then. Over his body was thrown a fine, large wolfe Skin with Hair outwards and a neat border worked around its edges; thus accoutred he jumped up and down in his canoe with his arms extended, he moved his head different ways and shaked his fingers briskly, while he was acting in this manner all the other Indians sat down in their canoes and sung in concert and struck the sides of their canoes with the but end of their Paddles keeping exact time.2 The men of these expeditions were also engaged in the collection of natural history and ethnographic specimens, an effort that was often part of their official responsibilities. They also sought objects of native manufacture as curiosities, which made wonderful personal souvenirs of their long, exotic, and often dangerous voyages. As the frequency of visits by European fur traders increased, the demand for objects made by the local tribes also grew, resulting in an active commercial market by the first quarter of the 19th century. (The same phenomenon occurred among the Eastern Woodland tribes during the late 18th century, a process that resulted in the creation of new decorative styles to satisfy the aesthetic predilections of European patrons.3) The growth of a commercial European market was especially understandable in the Northwest Coast area, where a well- developed demand for ceremonial art objects was a traditional and integral part of the native cultural framework. This indigenous need for objects was sa great that it had led to the development of specialists in the arts of carving and 81</page><page sequence="3">Figure 2. Edward S. Curtis, American, 1868-1952, ^4 Tsunukwa at Kwaustums, 1914. Photo: Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago. painting. Artists whose skills and creative genius set them above the ordinary craftsman were competitively sought after and were even hired by neighboring tribal groups in the same manner in which the services of Renaissance artists were commissioned by various cities and princes throughout Italy in the 15th and 16th centuries.4 The collection of art objects from the tribes of the Northwest Coast by visitors to the area grew until, in the third quarter of the 19th century, museum expeditions systematically combed the region, gathering thousands of objects per year. The history of this process has been well documented and in itself provides a fascinating study of cultural interaction.5 As early as the 18th century, observers and collectors were aware of the high quality and aesthetic merit of the native arts of the Northwest Coast and realized that these objects belonged to a mature creative tradition. The English Captain George Dixon remarked on this in Voyage Round the World , his account of a visit made to the Northwest Coast in 1787: Whether or no they make use of any hieroglyphics to perpetuate the memory of events, I cannot say, though their numerous drawings of birds and fishes, and their carved representations of animals and human faces, might, perhaps, warrant a supposition of the kind. Many of these carvings are well proportioned, and executed with a considerable degree of ingenuity, which appears rather extraordinary amongst a people so remote from civilized refinement. But then we must consider that this art is far from being in its infancy; a fondness for carving and sculpture was discovered amongst these people by Captain Cook; iron implements were then also in use; ... at what period iron was introduced on this coast is very uncertain, but it must doubtless be a considerable time ago.6 (This acute observation was restated more recently by the French anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss, who wrote that 4 'we have no reason to doubt that this multiform art has been developed according to the same rhythm since its remotest origins, of which we are ignorant."7) Dixon was also quite correct in theorizing that the representational arts of the Northwest Coast people were part of an elaborate structure that was used to memorialize and symbolize a 4 'memory of events" which dealt with the myths and histories of the tribes. In these cultures dance, music, oratory, and the visual arts were integrated into a homogeneous system that supported the complicated mythologies and social order of the native populations. The all-important factors of family heritage, rank, and privilege were part of the basic fabric of people's lives, and the 4 "heraldic" arts were widely used to publicly proclaim the identity of clans, families, or individuals. Early European visitors who were themselves familiar with the public role of the visual arts in their own cultures and their classical precedents were impressed by the proliferation of art of high quality that they found in this area. At the end of the 18th century, the French surgeon Roblet wrote the following commentary after visiting Haida villages on the Queen Charlotte Islands: I remark, however, that voyagers who have frequented the different parts of the NORTH-WEST Coast of AMERICA, often saw there works of painting and sculpture in which proportions were tolerably well observed, and the execution of which bespoke a taste and perfection which we do not expect to find in countries where the men seem still to have the appearances of savages. But what must astonish most... is to see paintings every where, every where sculpture, among a nation of hunters.8 The two Northwest Coast masks in Detroit are fine examples of objects made by the Kwakiutl and Tsimshian tribes. The first one (fig. 1) is a striking example of a mask representing a mythological creature, in this case a Dzoonokwa, a very popular character in the mythology and art of the southern Kwakiutl people.9 This group is one of the major tribes of the southern Northwest Coast and is made up of a number of smaller units that share common cultural traits and a form of the Wakashan language. They still inhabit their traditional homelands on the Canadian Pacific Coast, from Gardiner Channel to Cape Mudge, and the north end of Vancouver Island, where they are making considerable efforts to maintain the proud cultural traditions of their predecessors. 82</page><page sequence="4">The masks of the Kwakiutl are part of the elaborate costumes worn by dancers in ceremonial events that dramatize hereditary myths. The rights to produce these mythical dramas and to use the various masks, costumes, and other objects associated with them are a jealously guarded privilege passed down from one generation to the next. The Dzoonokwa appears in both of the major dramatic complexes of this tribe, the Tseyka, or Winter Ceremonial, and the Tlasula, or Summer Ceremonial, which is sometimes called the weasel dance in reference to the abundance of white ermine skins that decorate many of the objects used in it.10 Both of these ritual events feature a number of characters and are very elaborate and costly affairs. They also share a structural tie of a more spiritual nature in that each contains the central theme of a ceremonial novice who is captured by spirit forces. This is followed by the novice's return, subjugation, and purification. In many ways the structure of these events is reminiscent of the ritual of a shaman's initiation and, in a manner, represents a communal expression of the healer's very individual spiritual experience. The Dzoonokwa who appear in these ceremonial cycles are characterized as a much-feared race of giants who are sometimes represented as male but are more often seen as female. Franz Boas, who produced a large and seminal body of work on the ethnography of the Kwakiutl, described these creatures as "a people who dwell inland or live on mountains. Their houses are far in the woods. . .the Dzo'noqlwa have black bodies; eyes wide open, but set so deep in the head that they cannot see well . . . .They are described as giants, and as stout."11 Bill Holm has related that belief in the Dzoonokwa still exists among the Kwakiutl, who now ascribe the isolation of their forest homes to an aversion to the noise and air pollution introduced by the motor boat.12 The female Dzoonokwa was the form most often used in the Tlasula. According to Boas' research, she was conceived of as a wild woman who resides in the woods. She is represented as having enormous breasts and as carrying a basket, into which she puts children whom she steals in order to eat them. Her eyes are hollow and shine with a wild luster. She is asleep most of the time. Her mouth is pushed forward, and she is, when awake, constantly uttering her cry, "u, hu, u, u." This figure belongs to a great many clan legends, and is often represented on house posts or on masks. 13 Figure 2 shows a large female Dzoonokwa statue photographed at the beginning of the century by Edward Curtis, the well-known artist who produced such an interesting record of Native Americans and their art. The photograph emphasizes the terrifying aspects of the Dzoonokwa, who emerges howling from the depths of the woods, eager to snatch up and devour unsuspecting children. It is small wonder that the threat of this creature was often invoked by parents in order to discipline misbehaving children.14 During the ritual dances the performer who represented the Dzoonokwa would wear a bearskin costume (fig. 3), a dramatic effect that certainly added to the dancer's fearsome image. The dances were held in large houses that displayed the heraldic images appropriate to their owner. The interior of such a house, showing a painted screen, carved poles, masked dancers of the Tlasula, and costumed family members, was captured by Curtis in a photograph published in 1914 (fig. 4). The people were formally Figure 3. Dzoonokwa Mask with Black Bear Skin. Photo: Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago. posed for the event by the photographer, but during the actual ceremony, their dance movements, songs, and music would have been combined in a closely choreographed dramatic presentation. Boas, who witnessed many Kwakiutl ceremonies at the end of the 19th century, has provided us with a description of the female Dzoonokwa' s performance: "When the dancer enters the house, a rope is stretched from the door to her seat, along which she feels her way. She does not dance, but walks once around the fire, attired in the complete skin of a bear which fits over her body and to which her mask is attached."15 Boas also recorded songs associated with the Dzoonokwa that enrich our conception of these mythical creatures and also serve to remind us of the integration of the plastic and 83</page><page sequence="5">performing arts among the Kwakiutl and other Northwest Coast tribes: She is the great Ts'o'noqua who is Trying to carry men on her arms, Who is causing nightmare, Who is making us faint. Great bringer of nightmares! Great one who makes us faint! Terrible Ts'o'noqua.16 The popularity of the Dzoonokwa image is also emphasized by the variety of ritual paraphernalia decorated with its features. These include sculptures of different sizes and types, ceremonial daggers, feast dishes, and ladles, which reflect another aspect of the Dzoonokwa character as a giver of wealth in the important social and economic complex known as the potlatch. The nature of this ritual was explained by Audrey Hawthorn in her study of the Kwakiutl: The Kwakiutl individual of rank was concerned that others should recognize, his claims and status. The same preoccupation was characteristic of the lineage group and of the villages in relation to each other. This concern was expressed in the institution of the potlatch, which provided a channel for claims to be made publicly, privileges to be displayed, and ceremonial hospitality to be offered.17 This bounteous aspect of Dzoonokwa is personified by the Gyikumhl or ' 'chief mask," which is worn by the chief who owns the privilege of personifying Dzoonokwa during speeches at the potlatch. In contrast to its female counterpart, the "chief mask" is often carved to produce a more realistic and threatening expression. Its maleness is emphasized by the moustache and beard that it wears. This facial hair is repre- sented by painted designs or by the addition of strips of black bear fur. In the Detroit Dzoonokwa Mask the majority of the fur originally placed in the channels carved around the chin and mouth has been lost, with only two small bits remain- ing in the ends of the channels near the ears. The Detroit mask is also adorned with long locks of black human hair that are attached to the top of the head by wooden pegs set into holes. In her study of the extensive Kwakiutl collection at the University of British Columbia, Hawthorn has given a good description of the "chief mask" and its close association with objects of great value such as the large metal plaques, known as "coppers," decorated with heraldic designs: In the role of wealth-giver, so important a theme in the potlatch, Tsonokwa is depicted as a male. He carried a basket in which were stored coppers, which he handed to the chief who was selling or giving them away. At a moment of climax in the copper dispersal, the chief put on a family crest mask called a Geekumhl, representing a male Tsonokwa .... This mask, characterized by a strong and vigorous face, usually had locks of human hair and was very carefully carved. As this creature, the chief "cut" the copper with a copper cutter, which often had the carved head of a Tsonokwa on its handle. 18 The art of the Northwest Coast Indians is controlled by a set of highly stylized conventions that describe the representa- tion of mythical creatures, animals, and humans. The Detroit Dzoonokwa Mask follows the general conventions of its type: a large, strongly structured face with a high, rounded forehead separated from the deep-set eyes by large, arched eyebrows. These elements are balanced by the pronounced sculptural ridges of the cheekbones, the hollow cheeks, and the pursed mouth that seems to utter its eerie cry. The strong sculptural quality of the mask was achieved by treating the eye areas and the cheeks as a balanced set of concave and convex planes in the wooden block. The curved recesses provide a forward thrust to the face, em- phasizing the powerful beaklike nose and large, pursed lips. This aggressive expression can be more clearly seen when viewed from the side, as the plane of the features slopes outwards from the fore- head to the farthest point of extension at the lower lip. This relationship between solid form and negative space also has the effect of adding to the sculptural mass inherent in the object. The faces of Dzoonokwa masks are commonly painted black (using powdered graphite) and highlighted by details in red, such as the lips, cheeks, nostrils, and ears. The use of red to emphasize the mouth also calls to mind the terrible appetite of these monsters who devour children. In the Detroit mask the eyebrows are emphasized by strips of copper set into the surface in place of the usual black bear fur. This reddish metal was highly regarded by the coastal tribes and its presence added to the value of the mask. Like aspects of personal adornment that will be discussed later, this use of color is integrally related to the Kwakiutl custom of face painting. The practice was described by Archibald Menzies, a naturalist and surgeon who accompanied George Vancouver on his exploratory voyage in 1792 and who gave us the first historical account of the Kwakiutl: "Some had ornamented their faces by painting it with red-ochre, sprinkled over with black glimmer that helped not a little to heighten their ferocious appearance."19 84</page><page sequence="6">Figure 4. Edward S. Curtis, Masked Dancers- Qagyuhl, 1914. Photo: Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago. While formal stylistic conventions exist for each type of Northwest Coast art object, the artist is free to exercise personal creative expression within these structural boundaries. Masks carved in the same area or village share elements of a particular regional style, but each object also remains a unique creation that reflects the individuality of the artist. An example of this stylistic freedom can be seen in the overall rectilinear form of the Detroit Dzoonokwa which can be contrasted to the frequently used variations on the oval . facial format.20 Many Dzoonokwa masks of later date have a more elaborate style of facial painting in which eyebrows, eyes, cheeks, and mouth are emphasized by the addition of white and sometimes gray to the basic palette of black and red. In this style of painting, as seen in the Mask Representing a Male Dzoonokwa from Hope Island carved by Willie Seaweed (fig. 5), the painted facial design follows the outlines of the principal anatomical features and is a supporting element perfectly integrated with the carving. As there is no collection data for the Detroit mask, we can only place it within a general stylistic area of the Kwakiutl region by comparing it with objects of similar formal features for which we have a more detailed provenance. One rather close example, now in the collections of the Museum of Anthropology at the University of British Columbia, is listed as being from Fort Rupert, an important village on the northeastern tip of Vancouver Island, whose people belong to the southern Kwakiutl group.21 While its overall shape is slightly less rectangular than that of the Detroit Dzoonokwa Mask , they share a very similar technique in the carving of the eyes and cheeks and seem to be identical in the way the channels cut to hold the facial hair are related to the shape of the mouth and chin. The secure dating of such carvings is often as difficult a problem as assigning them to a specific stylistic area. The year in which a particular object was collected may be known, but it is usually impossible to know how long it was used before it left the place where it was made. These ritual objects were recognized as valuable property and were often passed down from generation to generation for over one hundred years. The first record we have of the Detroit mask is from 1908, when it 85</page><page sequence="7">Figure 5. Willie Seaweed, Kwakiutl, 1873-1967 Mask Representing a Male Dzoonokwa (Gyikumhl); wood, human hair, and paint, h. 26.7 cm (lOVi in.). Museum of Anthro- pology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver. entered the collection of George Heye, the founder of the Museum of the American Indian, New York, in an exchange with the Free Museum of Science and Art in Philadelphia. We have therefore an established terminus post quern of 1908, and by the indications of wear and surface patination it may be assumed that the mask enjoyed several decades of native use. The Detroit Dzoonokwa Mask can therefore be dated to around 1870. The 19th-century Northwest Coast Female Mask (fig. 6) that has recently entered the collection of the Detroit Institute of Arts is more representational in style than the Dzoonokwa Mask. It is the realistic, though somewhat stylized, facial image of a woman whose generic type is principally found among the Northern Kwakiutl, Tsimshian, Haida, and Tlingit. Dixon provided an early description of Indian masks carved to represent the human face. The following excerpt from his journals was based on his personal experiences exploring and trading in the area around the Queen Charlotte Islands, whose principal inhabitants are the Haida: . . .the Indians are very fond of masks or visors, and various kinds of caps, all of which are painted with different devices, such as birds, beasts, fishes, and sometimes representations of the human face; they have likewise many of these devices carved in wood, and some of them far from being ill executed. These curiosities seem to be greatly valued, and are carefully packed in neat square boxes, that they may be more conveniently carried about. Whenever any large party came to trade, these treasures were first produced, and the principal persons dressed out in all their finery before the singing commenced.22 This journal entry could well describe a photograph of a group of dignified Tsimshian Chiefs of the Wolf Crest at Git- Lak-Damaks and their families taken about one hundred years after Dixon's visit (fig. 7). The men wear blankets, shirts, and headdresses decorated with their heraldic motifs and crests. The children wear the wolf skins of their principal crest animal, while two women in ornately decorated costumes sit at the right. The "neat square boxes" mentioned by Dixon are here beautifully embellished with carved and painted designs and inlaid with sea shells. Displayed on and around these wooden chests is a group of at least sixteen masks, two frontlets, a raven rattle, a large copper (in the lower left corner), and several blankets- great treasures, both material and symbolic, of the chiefs and their families. All of the masks in the photographs are anthropomorphic and the two at the end of the row displayed in front of the chief in the white blanket are especially close to the Detroit example. It is not known in what particular manner these masks were used. However, the physical evidence of a mouth grip on the inside of the Detroit Tsimshian mask, together with sets of long, leather thongs and pierced eye holes, indicate that the object was meant to be worn in some sort of ceremony. Perhaps these human face masks were used to portray the many family and tribal ancestors described in the mythology of this area. Women usually played an important role in these stories, where they are a key element in the tales relating the origins of the tribal units.23 The importance of the human face, or portrait, mask to the indigenous population was reflected in its popularity among European and American collectors. In his recent publication on this specific mask type, J. C. H. King has speculated that these objects might even have been stocked in fur trading company forts for sale to their white customers, a practice still commonly found in Indian trading posts in the southwestern United States. By the mid- 19th century, it seems that tribes like the Haida were producing the so-called "portrait" masks specifically for trade to non-Indians.24 One interesting example of this phenomenon is a group of masks representing high-ranking women, all of which are extremely close in carving style and might have been made by one artist between 1920 and 1940.25 86</page><page sequence="8">Figure 6.

Founders Society, New Endowment Fund (78.40). 87</page><page sequence="9">It is impossible to determine whether the Detroit Tsimshian mask is a portrait of a specific individual; more likely it is a general representation of an historical or mythical ancestor. However, we can be certain that it represents a woman because of the inclusion of the distinguishing feature of the lip-plug, or labret, in the lower lip. In the Northwest Coast area this object of personal adornment was worn only by women; because of its unusual character it attracted the attention of many early European observers. A description of this practice was recorded by Lieutenant Jacinto Caamano, who was on the Spanish frigate Nuestra Seflora de Aranzazu when surveys were made of the northern side of the Qtieen Charlotte Islands and the opposite coast in 1792. The people he met in this area were the Haida and the Tsimshian. After a general description of the men, he continued: The women are of the same color as the men, equally large framed, and are healthy looking creatures, with pleasing faces and well proportioned features. The mouth alone, disfigures them, since the lower lip is pierced at birth with a wire that is left in place, but from time to time changed for a larger one as the child grows; until finally, an oval piece of wood, concave on each side is inserted. This has a groove cut all around the circumference, into which fit the edges of the hole in the flesh.26 Dixon made a similar observation in 1787, but found that the labret was used as a symbol of rank. He wrote that 4 'This curious piece of wood is wore only by the women, and seems to be considered as a mark of distinction, it is not being wore by all indiscriminately, but only those who appeared in a superior position to the rest."27 In contrast to Caamano's record, Dixon found that the lip was not pierced at birth but at the age of fourteen or fifteen and speculated that the size of the labret reflected the social standing and importance of the woman who wore it.28 Another attribute of this mask that is common to most Northwest Coast masks is the addition of painted facial designs. On portrait masks, the design is directly related to the natives' custom of decorating their bodies and faces with various pigments. Once again, we can turn to 18th-century journals for a description of this practice before the process of acculturation began to influence the traditional mode of life. Caamano reported that "Both men and women are so addicted to daubing themselves with paint, that one rarely gets a sight of their actual face or com- plexion."29 His contemporary Dixon observed that the people of Port Mulgrave . . .like the rest of the inhabitants we have seen on the coast, are particularly fond of painting their faces with a variety of colours, so that it is no easy matter to discover their real complex- ion; however we have prevailed on one woman, by persuasion, and a trifling present, to wash her face and hands, and the alteration it made in her appearance absolutely surprised us; her countenance had all the chearful glow of an English milk-maid.30 Franz Boas investigated the subject of face painting on the Northwest Coast and explained that the designs were renditions of family crests that publicly identified the wearers to the other members of the community. Boas stated that like so many of the varied art forms used by these people, the nature of the facial decorations was integrally related to the social position of the individual: "The decorations differ according to the rank and wealth of the wearer. The full and rather realistic representations of animals are considered of greater value, and as indicating higher rank, than conventional representations which consist of symbols of the animals."31 Although it has not yet been possible to interpret what particular family crest the design on the Tsimshian Female Mask represents, the abstract symbol would seem to fit into Boas' second category. The large, curvilinear crest elements are painted in closely related shades of subdued blue and blue-green. The crest's pattern is a symmetrical one, dividing on a vertical axis along the middle of the face. The background areas and the details of the eyes, nostrils, lips, and ears are all painted red, while the long, subtly carved eyebrows and the delicate bas-relief ridges that define the shape of the eyes are black, the color usually regarded as the primary hue in low-relief carved and painted designs. This boldly painted face is set off by the addition of long strands of reddish brown human hair that echo the stronger red tones of the mask. Until recently, this mask was also adorned with a worn and rather sparse set of feathers that surrounded the head and were in part attached to the baleen strips fastened to the top of the forehead. A photograph of the mask with the feathers still in place was published by Steven Phelps in his catalogue of the James Hooper Collection.32 This form of decoration, which was the prime iconographic symbol of the American Indian in European art, is related to the actual styles of personal adornment found among the coastal tribes. As described by Caamano: "They commonly paint themselves with some black or red pigment, stick eagle's feathers in their hair, and all stink foully."33 The artist who created this mask achieved a final dramatic effect by setting lustrous pieces of abalone shell into the eyes. The 88</page><page sequence="10">Figure 7. Chiefs of the Wolf Crest at Git-Lak-Damaks. Photo: Museum of Northern British Columbia, Prince Rupert. multicolored inner surface of the shell was highly prized by the tribes of the Northwest Coast and was frequently used in the decoration of masks and other ceremonial objects, as well as being a popular form of jewelry when used by the women as earrings and nose decorations.34 Although it was originally thought to be from the Tlingit tribe,35 this mask has been re-attributed to the coastal Tsimshian who share the area with the northern Wakashan groups.36 Many face masks created by the artists of these tribes seem to follow a generally shared set of characteristics, and while we may have difficulty in differentiating specific tribal conventions, we can describe the attributes of a general style that was often shared by these groups. Briefly stated, this style features a broad, ovoid facial plane, clearly defined by a sharp outline. In his study of Tsimshian portrait masks Paul Wingert described another general characteristic as being the realistic treatment of the facial structure in relationship to the surface: These masks often evidence a remarkable expression of naturalistic bony structure and fleshy form. The orbital, jaw, and cheek bones are, for example, usually rendered with marked sensitivity. There is also a strong expression of fleshy forms and tightly drawn surface skin over these bony structures.37 This tense feeling of interior form pressing against a full, taut surface can certainly be seen in the Detroit Female Mask. It is also an observation that could be used to describe the faces of the Tsimshian people who appear in the group photograph discussed previously (fig. 7). Their broad, square faces, with skin tightly covering low, wide orbital bones, and a strong, full jaw provide a very striking resemblance to the structure and appearance of the masks themselves. Wingert also made an insightful observation on the relationship between the facial decoration and the sculptural forms of the masks that closely describes the effect of the painting on the mask now in Detroit (fig. 8). When the mask is observed frontally, however, the painted designs and the painted carved forms produce in many examples an appearance of flattened surfaces which conceal from this point of view the sculptural character of the forms. To see them successfully it is necessary to have at least a three- quarter frontal view of the mask.38 The combination of these sculptural and two-dimensional characteristics together with a refined surface treatment produces what Wingert has called "an art of restraint and of simplified clarity in both its style features and its expressive intentions."39 This statement succinctly describes the overall effect of this object as a highly successful and moving work of art that, together with the Dzoonokwa Mask , greatly enhances the museum's Native American collections. 89</page><page sequence="11">Figure 8.
