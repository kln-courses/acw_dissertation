<plain_text><page sequence="1">Transcending Weber's Categories of Modernity? The Early Lukdcs and Schmitt on the Rationalization Thesis John P. McCormick Max Weber's unrivaled standing in American social science is perhaps due as much to the ideological predicament of post-World War II aca- demia in the United States as to the staggering breath and depth of his writings. During the cold war, Weber's work was revived consciously, if not always explicitly, as scholarly validation of western liberal pluralism against eastern Communism and also as a methodological weapon against the perceived threat of orthodox marxist social science.1 It is a testament to the success of this enterprise that today Weber is consistently acknowl- edged as a "liberal" in north American scholarship.2 However scholarly approaches in other national contexts or from different theoretical per- spectives have long interpreted the ideological status of Weber's writings more fluidly: Weber's work is recognized not only as the source of con- temporary liberal social theory, but also as the principal intellectual mir- ror in which the most sophisticated theorists of this century's preeminent 1.

It explores how two of Weber's most famous students attempt to come to terms with their teacher's most important thesis: modernity as a process -of increasing "disenchantment" and "rationalization." In 1923, Lukics, in History and Class Consciousness, and Schmitt, in Roman Catholicism and Political Form, energetically confront Weber's thesis as expressed most notably in his Protestant Ethic collection, his essays on world religions, and his "Vocation" lectures.5 Both students had previously appropriated Weber's thesis of modernity as an increasingly formal, abstract rational- ization of society in their early socioliterary studies. Yet in the works from 1923 they come to view Weber's approach as insufficiently one- sided, for it cannot adequately account for the existence of the con- crete, qualitative manifestations of social reality, and relatedly, the per- sistence of the irrational, the romantic, and the mythical in modem 3. The intellectual relationship of Lukics and Weber is well-covered in the best English-language studies of the former's social and political theory: see Andrew Arato and Paul Breines, The Young Lukdcs and the Origins of Western Marxism (New York: Pluto, 1979); Stefan Breuer, "The Illusion of Politics: Politics and Rationalization in Max Weber and Georg Lukics," New German Critique 26 (Summer 1982); Martin Jay, "Georg Lukics and the Origins of the Western Marxist Paradigm," Marxism and Totality: The Adventures of a Concept from Lukdcs to Habermas (Berkeley: U of California P, 1984); and Andrew Feenberg, Lukccs, Marx, and the Sources of Critical Theory (Oxford: Oxford UP, 1986). Their personal relationship is examined in biographical studies of the respec- tive figures: Arthur Mitzman, The Iron Cage: An Historical Interpretation of Max Weber (Oxford: Transaction, 1985) and Arpad Kadarkay, Georg Lukdcs: Life, Thought and Poli- tics (Cambridge: Blackwell, 1991). 4. In a controversial statement, Juirgen Habermas remarked that Schmitt was a "true student," or at least a "natural son," of Weber. See Max Weber and Sociology Today (1965), ed. Otto Stammer, trans. K.

Weber claims that the phenomena associated with this latter category are either modem remnants of an irrational past or contempo- rary flights from an overly rationalized present. Lukics and Schmitt attempt to show that such irrationality and neo-mythology are intrinsi- cally linked to the abstract rationality that Weber describes - that modernity, rather than fostering the "disenchantment" of politics or the banishment of cultural superstition, itself rather manufactures them. Their evidence for this argument is in many ways derived from Weber himself: the battle of "warring gods" to which the discussion of values is reduced in Weber's theory is, for them, the latent irrational subjec- tive will that serves as a mere complement to the irresistible objec- tively-rational structures of the "iron cage" of modernity. I hope to explore these themes in a way that transcends the terms of the well- known debates over the normative and historical ramifications of the late Weber's theorizing of charisma and Fiihrerdemokratie. However, what must be addressed in the course of this analysis is the fact that Lukics and Schmitt themselves - each in their own way, to be sure - endorsed twentienth-century political mythologies that most vigorously championed political will: left- and right-wing authoritarianism in the forms of, respectively, Soviet Communism and National Socialism. Lukdcs, Schmitt, and Weber Andrew Arato and Paul Breines observe that in central Europe, "the early 1920s in general and 1923 in particular amounted to a vintage sea- son for intensive reflection on relations between consciousness and soci- ety."6 The work that they focus upon most extensively from this tumultuous period immediately following the conclusion of World War 17 is Lukics's History and Class Consciousness.8 A less well-renowned but nevertheless still significant contribution to social and political theory from this period - in fact this very same year of 1923 - is Schmitt's Roman Catholicism and Political Form.9 Indeed the relationship between 6.

The latter two points may serve alternately as a source of encouragement and a note of caution to those engaged in similar contemporary critiques. The parallels between Schmitt and Lukics actually exceed the shared influence of Weber, however much the latter's intellectual presence 10. An otherwise excellent account of the young Lukics's intellectual context does not mention Schmitt at all: Mary Gluck, Georg Lukdcs and his Generation: 1900-1918 (Cambridge: Harvard UP, 1985). Breuer and Ulmen are notable exceptions in this regard, but see also Agnes Heller, "The Concept of the Political Revisited," Political Theory Today, ed. D. Held (Stanford: Stanford UP, 1991). Heller compares the Schmitt of 1927 and after with the Lukics of this period leading up to 1923 in such a way as to draw sharper distinctions than would be rendered by a comparison of the thinkers in the early period. The connection between Schmitt and Lukacs's theoretical progeny in the Frankfurt School has been more widely discussed however: see the debate on the topic by Ellen Kennedy, Ulrich K. PreuB, Martin Jay, and Alfons S611ner in Telos 71 (Spring 1987); and more recently, see William E.

For instance, both detected and sought to better facilitate the opening win- dow of opportunities for elites for which Weber hoped.14 Both adopted short-lengthed works or collections of essays as their preferred vehicles of expression rather than the traditionally Germanic volume-length tome.15 Both recognized a kernel of truth in Weber's association of mod- ernization and Protestantism, yet sought to correct its exaggerations and broaden its scope from the standpoint of their own critical, outsider, theo- logical-political perspectives - political Catholicism for Schmitt and sec- ularly-messianic Judaism for Lukics.16 Both began their careers practicing the methodological neo-Kantianism dominant at the time and yet both wound up as two of its most radical critics. Neither seemed to be unconscious of each other's intellectual activities: Schmitt was an admirer of Lukics's essay, "Legality and Illegality" included in History,17 and 14. Arato and Breines call History "an appeal to the critical role of intellectuals" (ix). On Schmitt and intellectual-political elites, see McCormick, "Introduction to Schmitt's 'The Age of Neutralizations and Depoliticizations'," Telos 96 (Summer 1993). 15. Besides the short and forceful thrust of such a medium - which matches Schmitt's prose - Reinhard Mehring points out how the pamphlet expresses Schmitt's philosophical suspension between "system and aphorism," between "Hegel and Nietzsche"; see Pathetisches Denken: Carl Schmitts Denkweg am Leitfaden Hegels: Katholische Grundstellung und antimarxistische Hegelstrategie (Berlin: Duncker &amp; Humblot, 1989) 21. Arato and Breines remark on Lukics's essayistic approach: "the essay and the fragment, in their brevity and incompleteness, remain true to the living reality of their objects. Incompat- ible with intellectual synthesis and resolution of actual antagonisms, the essay and the frag- ment are, in an antagonistic world, the dialectical forms of expression par excellence" (4). 16.

Zohn (New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1975) 466. On the influence of Catholicism on Schmitt's early career, consult his biographies: Joseph Bendersky, Carl Schmitt: Theorist for the Reich (Princeton: Princeton UP, 1983); and Paul Noack, Carl Schmitt: Eine Biographie (Berlin: Propylien, 1993). Schmitt was still a believing Roman Catholic in the early 1920s, writing frequently in the Catholic press but never officially joining the Catholic Center Party. He became estranged from the Church in late 1923 and was ex-communicated in 1926 because of the complexi- ties of his marital situation. He apparently grew quite bitter toward the Church in the late Weimar Republic, publicly feuding with the more moderate Center Party. 17. See Ulmen 86, 115-24.</page><page sequence="6">138 Transcending Weber Lukics eventually wrote a serious review of Schmitt's Political Roman- ticism.18 In fact, long after Lukics had become a Soviet apologist, he was careful to distinguish Schmitt's intellectual efforts from those of other more vulgar Weimar conservatives in his account of German philosophical irrationalism, The Destruction of Reason: Observing the "special nuances" of Schmitt's thought, Lukaics remarks that "the overtly reactionary," yet "superior," Schmitt "perceived in the antithe- sis of liberalism and democracy an important present day problem."19 For Schmitt's part, just a year before he was to become a Nazi activist he devotes the longest and most substantive footnote in The Concept of the Political to Hegel and to Lukdics as the one who has kept the "actu- ality" of Hegel "most vitally alive."20 Indeed it is the similar and not so similar relationship to Hegel or at least the Hegelian method that proves the most interesting cross-com- parison of Schmitt and Lukdics as theorists of modernity and critics of rationalization.21 Schmitt once spoke of "a different lineage from Hegel," alluding of course to the leftist one that can be traced back from the Frankfurt School through Lukacs and further back through Marx, and at the same time intimating the existence of another intellectual line 18.

Ellen Kennedy (Cambridge: MIT, 1985). Lukacs had written his own critique of liberal parlia- mentarism in 1920: "Zur Frage des Parlamentarismus," Georg Lukdcs Werke, Band 2. Schmitt is still acknowledged by the left for his theoretical sophistication: Jean Cohen and Andrew Arato, while justifiably critical of Schmitt, laud his "dialectical virtuosity," in Civil Society and Political Theory (Cambridge: MIT, 1992) 236; and Chantal Mouffe identifies Schmitt as "a rigorous and perspicacious opponent" in The Return of the Politi- cal (London: Verso, 1993) 118. 20.

Under National Socialism Schmitt either refrained from citing LukAcs altogether or denounced him as a Jew and a Marxist: see "Der Staat als Mechanismus bei Hobbes und Descartes," Archiv fur Rechts- und Sozialphilosophie 39 (1937). He returned to more substantive consider- ations on LukAcs after the war: see Verfassungsrechtliche Aufsdtze aus den Jahren 1924- 1954: Materialien zu einer Verfassungslehre (Berlin: Duncker &amp; Humblot, 1958) 425- 26, 450. 21.

McCormick 139 that can be traced back on the right.22 Schmitt can be seen as the chief example of what might then be called the dialectical right. It is the early practice of dialectics by Lukics and Schmitt that at once points out the deficiencies of a Weberian liberal account of modernity and rationaliza- tion, but also the dangers of totalitarianism in attempts to transcend those deficiencies that are not themselves sufficiently "dialectical." In their cultural-political treatises from the late teens and early 1920s, Lukaics and Schmitt attempt to formulate critiques of modernity that properly apprehend rationality's role within it without either aestheti- cally valorizing nor fearfully fleeing from it - responses characteristic of most of their contemporaries.23 They are confronted with the prob- lem that modernity seems to have two opposite intellectual poles: the one, economic-technical thought, the abstractly formal rationality asso- ciated with economics, technology, and positivism; the other, the many strands of Romanticism, the highly subjective and aesthetic enrapture with specifically concrete objects. For both theorists, the task of a ratio- nality not beholden to either one of these particular opposites of moder- nity would be one that understands their interrelatedness and attempts to move beyond it. Just how the treatment of these poles changes at first reveals their great debt to Weber and then their harsh turn against him. According to Schmitt and Lukics, just as Kant poses an irresistibly formal rationality that remains (despite Herculean efforts) undisturbed by the sheer subjectivity of his ethics, Weber's calls to responsible indi- vidual stands in his political tracts remain ineffective vis-a-vis the objectively formal structures of society whose development he so care- fully delineates in his account of modernity. This "necessity versus free- dom" opposition is of course completely consistent with what is ever replayed in the more familiar language of mainstream social science as the opposition of "fact and value," or of "structure and agency." Per- haps even more problematic is the fact that the normative status of these personal subjective stands remains ultimately indeterminate as they are inaccessible to the rationality of the objective forms from which they are severed and against which they are posed. A related question there- fore regarding Weber's account that proves most pressing for the two 22. See Schmitt, "Die andere Hegel-Linie: Hans Freyer zum 70. Geburtstag," Christ und Welt 30 (25 July 1957). 23. Despite certain interpretive deficiencies, Jeffrey Herf's Reactionary Modernism: Technology, Culture and Politics in Weimar and the Third Reich (New York: Cambridge UP, 1984) provides many vivid examples of attitudes toward rationalization in this context.</page><page sequence="8">140 Transcending Weber primary subjects of this study is the following: if modernity is a totally rationalized process, how does Weber account for the subjective irratio- nality which seems to elude this process yet also seems pervasive in modem societies? Weber's theory generally perceives the elements of irrationality which inevitably confront his framework in three ways: as external or prior to the system of rationalism itself - "old gods" who "ascend from their graves [to] resume their eternal struggle" ("Science" 149); or merely as a "deviation" from the rational (e.g., ES 6); or as simply "reactions" to the process of rationalization.24 In their earliest literary studies, both Lukacs and Schmitt adopt Weber's theory of modernity as the culmination of a rationalization process driven forward by modem capitalism. They also reiterate Weber's frequent laments over the quantitatively impersonal forces that eradicate what is qualitatively specific about human existence. In these works from the late teens, briefly examined in the next section, Schmitt and Lukics enthusiastically incorporate much of Weber's thesis, while in their efforts of the early 1920s discussed in subsequent sections they demonstrate its one-sidedness by illustrating how the supposedly pre- modem or extrarational irrationality that remains impenetrable to enlightenment rationality is not in fact alien to that rationality but rather is an inherent part of it. In Weber's (in)famous call to politics (to lead- ership, to charisma, to elites) as a response to the impact of the ratio- nalization he had theorized in his social-scientific works and then applied to the context of post-World War I Germany,25 Schmitt and Lukics ultimately observe the romantic counterpart to the bureaucrati- zation that Weber's prescriptions are intended to solve.26 It is however a romantic reversion to which their own theories do not prevent them 24. Modern religious irrationalism, for instance, is conceived by Weber as an almost mechanical response to secularization: "This reaction is the stronger the more systematic the thinking about the 'meaning' of the universe becomes, the more the external organiza- tion of the world is rationalized, and the more the conscious experience of the world's irra- tional content is sublimated." See, for example, "Religious Rejections of the World and Their Directions," From Max Weber 357. The new emphasis on "mystical experience," according to Weber, is a backlash to an increasingly dominant "rational cognition and mastery of nature" ("The Social Psychology of the World Religions," From Max Weber 282). See also "Science" 143, 154. 25. Cf. "Politics" and the "Parliament and Government" lecture appended to Econ- omy and Society. Hereafter referred to as ES parenthetically in the text. 26. For instance, Weber characterizes charisma as pure substance, and charismatic authority as the concrete opposite of abstract bureaucratic authority (ES 1112, 1116), and hence an object for the aesthetic preoccupation of the mass.</page><page sequence="9">John P. McCormick 141 from succumbing in even more fundamentally radical ways. Lukics's initial theoretical confrontation with modernity in the stud- ies of literature and aesthetics, such as Soul and Form, "The Sociology of Modem Drama," and The Theory of the Novel has been well docu- mented, and I do not wish to merely recount in an inadequate fashion here what others have done so well elsewhere.27 Schmitt's almost iden- tical early approach in his extended essay-length commentary on the poem "Northern Lights" in 1916,28 followed by another socioliterary study from 1919, Political Romanticism has not been so extensively treated.29 I will not deal with these early works, especially those of Lukics, in the same depth as I will their flawed masterpieces of 1923, History and Class Consciousness and Roman Catholicism and Political Form. But some provisional observations on the former set of texts are nonetheless warranted. Neo-Kantianism and Socioliterary Studies In his study on modem drama which appeared in German in 1914, Lukics restates Weber's analysis of the increasingly abstract and anony- mous, that is impersonal and inhuman, character of industrial capitalism: From the individual's standpoint the modem division of labor essentially separates labor from the ever irrational and hence qualitative attributes of the workers and directs it toward objective, end-oriented criteria that remain external to and independent of their personality. Capitalism's pri- mary economic tendency is precisely this objectification of production, and its separation from the personality of the producer. In the process of the capitalist economy, capital, an objective abstraction, becomes the actual producer - yet it has no organic relationship to those who in fact own it. Whether the owners themselves have personalities at all becomes more and more irrelevant - consider joint stock companies. (SD 665-66) 27.

In fact the "fac- tory" appears to give the age its signature. As the imposition of func- tional means toward some wretched or senseless purpose as the universal urgency of means over ends, the factory so nullifies the indi- vidual that not once does he recognize his own eradication. (N 59) However Lukics and Schmitt in these writings not only appropriate the objective side of Weber's narrative - the "spirit of capitalism" com- ponent - but the subjective one as well: more specifically, his concern with personal individual dispositions like the Protestant ethic. Despite their own lapses into excesses characteristic of Lebensphilosophie [the philosophy of life], both, like Weber, would criticize it in others. There- fore in Lukics's case, long before he would make these opposing objec- tive and subjective categories famous in his "Antinomies of Bourgeois Thought" section of History, he was already juxtaposing these theoreti- cal moments of modernity in his studies of literature. However, still within the realm of the neo-Kantianism that he shared with Weber in these literary analyses of the early teens, Lukics's orientation toward these antinomies was different than they would appear in his Hegelian Marxist writings of only a few years later.31 In these early works he still adhered to a method that he would later find itself complicitous in the ills of modernity he had initially discerned via Weber's thesis. The crucial opposition of abstract, objective form and concrete sub- jective content is more or less treated in a way that actually privileges the former in Lukics's early literary works. For instance in Soul and 30. Theodor Johannes Adolf Ddiubler (1876-1934), born in Trieste, was known for his celebration of southern European life and culture over its northern counterpart. He published "Nordlicht" in 1910. 31. Weber's complicated relationship to Kantianism is examined in Christian Len- hardt, "Max Weber and the Legacy of Critical Idealism," The Barbarism of Reason.

McCormick 143 Form, he pursues a marriage of the timeless elements of his collection's title - "the mystical moment of the union of internal and external, the soul and the form" (SF 8) - but he does so in a way that prioritizes the latter, abstract forms over the substantive content of soul. Just as Weber deploys the formal, often transhistorically applied categories of the "ideal type" to impart meaning to empirical reality in his methodol- ogy,32 Lukics views literary genres, for example, as the frameworks that allow the substance of literary reality to emerge: "form sets limits round a substance which otherwise would dissolve like air .. ." (SF 7). More- over, much like Weber's famous social-scientific observer - the impar- tial, neutral, impersonal subject - who in effect creates meaning through interpretive analysis of material reality by means of the techniques of the atemporal formal types, Lukics's literary critic likewise draws reality from the chaos of literary material: "The critic is one who glimpses des- tiny in forms: whose most profound experience is the soul-content which forms indirectly and unconsciously conceal within themselves."33 In Weber the neutrality and atemporality of the methodology does not however prevent the emergence of a prejudiced disposition over his- torical specificity: that is, the melancholy of the conclusion of The Prot- estant Ethic and the "Science" lecture which fuels the call for responsible personal stands in the "Politics" and "Parliament and Gov- ernment" lectures. Lukics's early writings betray a similar lament over, and desire to actively transcend, the alienation brought on by a rational- ized modernity. In this regard he frequently exhibits an existential pathos derived often explicitly from Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and Dos- toyevsky. The Theory of the Novel, for instance, repeatedly praises the artists and thinkers of the Middle Ages for capturing what is simulta- neously transcendent and finite in their world: Giotto, St. Thomas, St. Francis, and most importantly, Dante, are praised for expressing a "wholeness" inaccessible to modernity.34 Weber lifts from Tolstoy the biblical image of the contented Abraham to contrast with the alienated citizen of modernity ("Science" 140); Lukdcs employs the literary fig- ure of Cervantes's Don Quixote to make a more sophisticated point. 32.

See Lukacs, Theory ofthe Novel 37, 101-02.</page><page sequence="12">144 Transcending Weber In Cervantes's novel, Lukics finds the last instance when objective reality and subjective experience, moments of the eternally unchanging and the fleetingly ephemeral, coexisted in the West before disintegrat- ing in modern history: The profound melancholy of the historical process, of the passing of time, speaks through this work, telling us that even a content and an atti- tude which are eternal must lose their meaning when their time is past: that time brushes aside even the eternal. Don Quixote is the first great battle of interiority against the prosaic vulgarity of outward life and the only battle in which interiority succeeded, not only to emerge unblem- ished from the fray, but even transmit some of the radiance of its trium- phant, though admittedly self-ironising, poetry to its opponent. (TN 104) After Cervantes, Lukics laments that the relationship of subjective disposition and objective reality, correlates to what he had theorized as "soul and form," is fractured, leaving individual consciousness alien- ated from the outside world and condemned to an "all-devouring con- centration on a single point of existence," a "narrowing of their souls" (TN 106). This is the frivolous enrapture with internal moods character- istic of Romanticism and Lebensphilosophie. In Soul and Form, Lukdcs had criticized modem aesthetics, particularly as manifested by Romanticism, as the appropriate expression of capital- ism despite its often self-understood opposition to it. Romantics promote an "aesthetic culture" whose passivity conforms perfectly with the help- lessness of the bourgeois and the unreflective activity of industrial produc- tion that for all its frenzy is still deemed passive by Lukics (SF 107-08). Less well known is Schmitt's delineation of this observed interrelatedness in "Northern Lights" and Political Romanticism and his attempt to work through the opposition of objective form and subjective content that he too inherits to some extent from the neo-Kantianism of Weber. In his analysis of "Northern Lights," Schmitt, like Lukacs, contrasts the social position of art in modernity to that in the Middle Ages. He too cites Dante's Commedia and St. Thomas's Summa as "fruits" of their age. And despite his sympathy with Daiubler's rather Weberian literary depiction of the effects of rationalization, Schmitt criticizes the poem for not being in fact a true expression of its own age, but instead only an insufficient "negation" of it. Schmitt finds it quite understandable that the crisis of modernity should be put in terms of "the opposition of mechan- ics and soul" - the lifelessly anonymous forms and the concrete life that</page><page sequence="13">John P. McCormick 145 rebels against them, as it is by Daiubler in "Northern Lights." But there are theoretical problems with this position that pertain to the very possi- bility of making such an assertion or acting to address it, according to Schmitt. As in the gnostic view of the world, which sees the earth only as "the complete work of the devil, in which eternal spiritlessness is tri- umphant over spirit," in the "mechanics versus soul" worldview there is no room for human activity or reflection that is then free of such con- demnation (N 63). In such a scenario, "we would be beyond help; we must at least see out of our prison to escape, so as to save the soul" (N 64). According to Schmitt, "dualisms" such as the one between soul and soullessness left as such will do nothing to help one theoretically appre- hend the age for what it is, or actively change it (N 70). Despite his repeatedly expressed admiration and respect for the poet Daiubler, "who grasps and portrays the present more comprehensively than a critical historian," Schmitt ultimately finds his work theoretically lacking because "a critical-historical standpoint cannot be found present in 'Northern Lights"' (N 66). Because Daiubler relies so heavily on dual- isms such as the mechanical world versus living soul and spirit, his work can be little more than "a compensation to the age of spiritless- ness ... a counterweight to a mechanistic age" (N 64). It is a negation of the age - perhaps "the last and most universal negation" - but not a real critique of modernity because it cannot itself transcend the dual- ism of soul versus soullessness which is itself characteristic of the age (N 65). Likewise, in his study of Romanticism, Schmitt acknowledges that the movement has legitimate complaints against capitalism, sci- ence, and technology but ultimately is only a complementary element to them in an overarching structure. Schmitt explicitly employs the Webe- rian method of "ideal types" (PR 57) and subtly draws upon the recently delivered "Vocation" lectures in carrying out his analysis. He does not yet in Political Romanticism, as he later will, expressly situate Weber within the theoretical complex of rationalization and Romanticism. Schmitt traces this oppositional structure participated in by Daubler and romantics to the very foundations of modem thought: early modem rationalism had already compromised a unifying vision of the world in the split between abstract scientific thinking, characteristic of Coperni- cus's objective approach, and the inward, individualistic rationality characteristic of Descartes's subjective approach (PR 52). This culmi- nates in the formal rationality of Kant that in order to maintain its uni- versalism must impute an inaccessible irrationality to concrete reality -</page><page sequence="14">146 Transcending Weber the world only exists as the product of human senses, as a collection of things-in-themselves whose quality is derived solely from the observ- ing subject and not from or by themselves: Natural Science ceased to be geocentric and sought its focal point beyond the earth. Philosophy became egocentric and sought its focal point in itself. Modem philosophy is governed by a schism between thought and being, concept and reality, mind and nature, subject and object, that was not eliminated even by Kant's transcendental solution. Kant's solution did not restore the reality of the external world to the thinking mind. That is because for Kant, the objectivity of thought lies in the consideration that thought moves in objectively valid forms. The essence of empirical reality, the thing in itself, is not a possible object of comprehension at all. Post-Kantian philosophy, however, made a deliberate attempt to grasp this essence of the world in order to put an end to the inexplicability and irrationality of real being.35 According to Schmitt, Hegel is the only thinker to nearly resolve this "duality of abstract concept and concrete being characteristic of abstract rationality," this "mechanistic worldview" most vigorously practiced by Descartes, Hobbes, and Kant (PR 53-54). As Schmitt remarks, "The Romantics were incapable of this sort of philosophical insight" (PR 82). The Romantics either accelerated the moment of subjective ego or related the two phenomena to each other in a purely literary way. Because the very structure of modem thought renders concrete reality irrational, the unrestrained subjective ego picks out various instances of it and imparts meaning to it; however this meaning, freed as it is from the confinement of cultural or religious prohibitions that obtain in the West before modernity, is derived not from any rational thought process but only arbitrary whim. Harmless objects such as a jewel, a book, a lock of hair become objects of intense subjective aestheticization, but so too do political-philosophical concepts such as "humanity" by the revo- lutionary left, or "history" by the conservative right (PR 59-60), with each side accusing the other of romanticism (PR 25). In Political Romanticism Schmitt identifies the romantic's arbitrary con- crete ascription of quality to objects - "romantic products" as he calls them - as encouraging in fact a commensurability of objects: "There is no possibility of distinguishing one romantic object from the another 35.

Every particular instance of the sensual world becomes ultimately the same because the individual's whim is the determining factor in defining reality such that "forms without substance can be related to any content. In the normative anarchy, everyone can form his own world, elevate every word and every sound to a vessel of infinite possibilities, and transform every situation and every event in a romantic fashion" (PR 76-77). There- fore activity that drains concrete specificity from the actual world so that it may manipulate its components, rationalization, is mirrored by activity that endlessly imputes a random concrete specificity to aspects of that world in a subjective scheme of manipulation, Romanticism. No matter how devoted they may seem to the object of their atten- tions, whether the affection of a beloved, the preservation of tradition or the emancipation of the people, romantics are in the end "always occu- pied with themselves" (PR 75). Romantics are incapable of substan- tially interacting with others or the world because of their fundamental self-absorption. The romantic's own emotions or affectations and the intensity thereof are all that give importance to the objects that arouse, or serve as "occasions" for such responses (PR 94, 100). The object in fact ideally ought not protrude anything of itself into the enraptured trance of the romantic, "who has no interest in really changing the world, [and] regards it as good if it does not disturb him in his illu- sions" (PR 98). The essence of Romanticism, and political Romanti- cism, especially, is hence passivity (PR 115), despite its feigned intense engagement with the world: it is "the unconditional passivism that destroys all activity" (PR 116). Schmitt thus thoroughly criticizes the same interiority and subjective preoccupation that fosters social passiv- ity identified by Lukaics in his own literary studies. According to Schmitt if romantics attempt at all to go beyond the rhe- torical "thunder" of their posed oppositions (PR 104), they often do so by appealing to a "higher third" (PR 66, 85): "the occasionalist does not explain a dualism, but rather lets it stand. He makes it illusory, how- ever, by shifting into a comprehensive third sphere" (PR 87). Adjec- tives like "true," "real," and "genuine" are often attached to one of the entities opposed to one another as a substitution for resolution (PR 92): e. g., "real soul" is meant to incorporate everything that is contrasted by the terms "body and soul." Such maneuvers, while appearing profound,</page><page sequence="16">148 Transcending Weber serve to "conceal the simple structure of the romantic mode of being" (PR 91, translation amended - JM). While carefully exposing the romantic's ineptitude in dealing with these oppositions, and suggesting that one must address them on the contrary with "mediation and interac- tion" (PR 88), Schmitt does not actually do so in the main text of Polit- ical Romanticism. He writes briefly in the Introduction about the need "to ascertain what is systematically essential by means of a conscious delineation to a specific historical complex" (PR 31, translation amended - JM). Yet each time he seems poised to undertake such a historicization he cites yet another example of romantic deficiency against which he himself proceeds to polemicize (PR 91). It is however especially the passivity encouraged by Romanticism that particularly rouses Schmitt's ire. Echoing Weber's "warring gods" for- mulation, Schmitt claims that "the essential feature of the intellectual situation of the romantic is that in the struggle of the deities he does not commit himself and his subjective personality" (PR 64). The romantic shirks the responsibility of engaging in the struggle of ideologies that is modernity and of choosing between right and wrong. Following Weber closely here in 1919 while he was still alive, the essence of non-roman- tic activity according to Schmitt is normatively responsible, as opposed to aesthetically whimsical, decision: "it should not be difficult to differ- entiate [romantic] organic passivity from the restraints of an active statesman that result from political experience and objectives. The crite- rion is whether the ability to make a decision between right and wrong is present" (PR 116). Romantics shy away from politics which means making value judgments which cannot be deferred into the quest for an ephemeral "higher third" (PR 117). The modem literary figure that according to Schmitt escapes the pas- sivity of the romantic individual is in fact the same as identified by Lukics: Don Quixote. This necessity of deciding and acting upon what is right and wrong leads Schmitt to the rather bizarre position of employ- ing Quixote as the model of political activity: Quixote is superior to romantics such as Adam MUiller and Friedrich Schlegel because "he was capable of seeing the difference between right and wrong and of making a decision in favor of what seemed right to him" even if he was driven "to a senseless disregard of external reality." Now violating rather than abiding by Weber's distinction of ethics of responsibility versus ethics of conviction set forth in the "Politics" essay, Schmitt blurs the two such</page><page sequence="17">John P. McCormick 149 that "fantastically absurd" activity is considered better by him than romantic activity because it is not inherently passive and is willing to take action for what it perceives as right. By this standard only does the often ecstatic theoretical efforts of the counter-revolutionaries he cites with favor, Edmund Burke, and especially Juan Donoso Cort6s and Joseph de Maistre - efforts that could easily be seen as extreme exam- ples of political Romanticism - qualify in Schmitt's account as non- romantic because of the deeply convicted quality of their conservative political attachments. In fairness Schmitt is willing to make concessions to the average revolutionary who himself holds such convictions. What is clear from Schmitt's account is the extent to which Weberian ethical stands, no matter how "responsible," may foster irrational activity by "a senseless disregard of external reality" (PR 147-48) when that reality is depicted as irresistible, unchangeable and impenetrable as it often is by Weber. A rationally justifiable normative viewpoint may not remain such within the dynamic that renders it inherently ineffective vis-a-vis the "real world." On the other hand, once Schmitt abandons Weberian neo- Kantianism because of its depiction of reality, it is questionable to what extent Schmitt has recourse to the Kantian categories of right and wrong. Here we may observe that in their early literary studies Schmitt and Lukaics focus on how the rationalized aspect of modernity abstracts away from all reality such that it can manipulate it, rendering all objects the same and hence meaningless, while interrogating the opposite side of this rationality that arbitrarily infuses all objects with aesthetic meaning by the subject such that it is equally irrational. The point of their early theoretical endeavor is to formulate within the Weberian framework a rationality that can overcome both, but not in the purely rhetorical or sentimental way of the romantics. Commentators find in the conclusion of Lukics's The Theory of the Novel a turn from Kant to Hegel.36 Oth- ers have found in Schmitt's post-Political Romanticism work a dramatic declaration of independence from neo-Kantianism.37 It is quite likely 36.

Beyond the Iron Cage By 1923, the publication dates of the two works that serve as the cen- terpiece of this study, both Lukics and Schmitt had only recently under- gone conversions of sorts. Lukics had joined the Hungarian communist party by 1919 and Schmitt had shifted from conservative neo-Kantian- ism to a more radical theoretical position of philosophical "decision- ism" by 1922.38 These new theoretical-political orientations entailed a new evaluation of Weber, the theorist who so influenced their develop- ment. This is signaled by a comparison of the titles of the two works from 1923 (History and Class Consciousness; Roman Catholicism and Political Form) with that of Weber's earlier effort: The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism. The significance of Lukics's title lies in the suggestion that capitalism has not facilitated the once-and-for-all constructed iron cage that perma- nently arrests historical development. Rather "history" continues to fos- ter social change because the agent of this change is not the, in Weber's estimation, now-exhausted Protestant sects and their ethic or values, but the still immanently active agency of productive labor now embodied in the proletarian class. Schmitt's title, on the other hand, does not so much refute the specifics of Weber's historical account of modernity as much as suggest a possible way out of the petrified theoretical-practical dead- end that Weber's thesis, its process, and its agents brought about: the residue of the inward perspective of Protestantism that had generated a process of social change through activity - the results of which it can no longer control - now seeks refuge more and more in types of pri- vacy, aesthetically manifested in Romanticism and politically in liberal- ism. This passive and stagnant retreat from the social world is countered by Schmitt with a Catholicism that supposedly transcends objective and 38. I will return to this below. Suffice to say here that the term decisionism empha- sizes the factual authority of an act over its relative adherence to abstractly rational norms.</page><page sequence="19">John P. McCormick 151 subjective antinomies rather than perpetuates them and whose public, as opposed to private, disposition is manifested in the primacy of politics rather than a sacred domestic or economic realm.39 Both theorists support their new positions by reassessing the form/ content, object/subject relationship that they tried to navigate within neo-Kantianism during Weber's lifetime. Rather than attempting to ascertain the liberation of the qualitatively concrete aspects of social life by applying the appropriate formally abstract a priori categories to it, both theorists pursue an approach that allows qualitative reality to emerge and itself determine and interact with the forms of specific con- crete existence - without lapsing into a romantic enrapture with such reality that cannot itself apprehend its qualitative existence. To prop- erly do so the individualistic characteristics of Weber's subjective standpoint - political and methodological - must give way to a theo- rizing of a collective standpoint that will not participate in a subject/ object dualism, but will itself be the identical subject-object that tran- scends it philosophically and politically. At the outset of the central essay of History, "Reification and the Con- sciousness of the Proletariat," Lukics embeds his analysis of modem rationalization no longer primarily in terms of Weber's account but now explicitly in terms of Marx's commodity form: its is the "commodity structure" of modem capitalism that facilitates the situation where "rela- tions between people take on the character of things" (HCC 83) and the consequent "progressive elimination of the qualitative, human and individ- ual attributes of the worker." The commodity form, according to Lukics, is "the central, structural problem of capitalist society in all its aspects.'40 Terminology familiar from Lukics's earlier analyses now take on new meaning: "With the modem 'psychological' analysis of the work-process (in Taylorism) this rational mechanization extends right into the worker's 'soul"' (HCC 88). What Lukdcs had previously theorized under the sway of Weber in his literary studies as transhistorical categories - form and soul - are now treated as a categories historically specific to modernity - hence the quotation marks around "soul" and the practical grounding of "form." In the course of his essay, Schmitt too, as we will see, explicitly refutes the categories of his former master, where he once had been silent. 39.

Fowkes (London: Vintage, 1976).</page><page sequence="20">152 Transcending Weber In both works the phenomenon of rationalization is by no means aban- doned as a social problem. Schmitt and Lukacs acknowledge the obvious hegemony of abstract-quantitative analysis in the social sciences and its ties to societal rationalization writ large. As Schmitt observes its influ- ence is nearly all-pervasive: "In almost every discussion one can recog- nize the extent to which the methodology of the natural-technical sciences dominates contemporary thinking" (RC 21). And Lukics remarks upon the infiltration of thought by the purely technical and the increasing "quantification" of rationality (HCC 98) in modem society: "the demand that mathematical and rational categories should be applied to all phe- nomena . .. interacts fruitfully with a technology becoming increasingly more rationalized. . ." (HCC 113). But again he now attributes the gene- sis of this rationality to a Marxian category and no longer a Weberian one: "The modem modes of thought already eroded by the reifying effects of the dominant commodity form" encourages purely "quantita- tive" analyses of society and not "qualitative" ones (HCC 84). Schmitt reiterates his reservations regarding a mode of production that offers no normative accounting for the products of that process whether they be used for decoration or death: Modem technology easily becomes the servant of this or that want or need. In modem economy a completely irrational consumption con- forms to a totally rationalized production. A marvelously rational mechanism serves one or another demand, always with the same ear- nestness and precision, be it for a silk blouse or poison gas or anything whatsoever. (RC 24-25) The irresistibly efficient and uniform logic of industrial production will provide whatever is called for by highly subjective consumptive demands, regardless of its impact on the very people who make such demands. The imperatives of economics and of technology are mere forms which ignore the significance of that substance upon which they act - humanity (RC 24). Because technology and economics remain normatively indifferent to the real nature of the demands they serve (that is, the demands of human beings) what is called "rationality" in Weber's scheme, according to Schmitt, is a reason become "fantasti- cally warped": "A mechanism of production serving the satisfaction of arbitrary material needs is called 'rational' without bringing into ques- tion what is most important - the rationality of the purpose which can make use of this supremely rational mechanism" (RC 26). One of the</page><page sequence="21">John P. McCormick 153 main theses of both works is still the fact that human beings them- selves in their limitless qualitative uniqueness become material objects for manipulation by an economic-technical rationality. Lukaics remarks how this rationality imposes upon society "a second nature" that is "a more soulless, impenetrable nature than feudalism ever was" (HCC 19). While this might sound like Weber's "shell of bondage" (ES 1402), Luk~cs and Schmitt both offer alternatives to this new form of domina- tion that are not available to Weber and his categories. The total commensurability of commodities in capitalism - the fact that a silk blouse can be equated unproblematically with poison gas - is grounded by Lukaics in Marx's analyses of the exchange-values and use- values of the commodity form: "The formal act of exchange which consti- tutes the basic fact for the theory of marginal utility likewise suppresses use-value as use-value and establishes a relation of concrete equality between concretely unequal and indeed incomparable objects" (HCC 104). It is the exchange value that conceals what is qualitatively specific about objects - a reduction of qualitative difference to the relative quan- titative amounts of labor hours it took to produce them and ignoring what is "organic, irrational, and qualitatively determined" about them.41 While both Schmitt and Lukaics criticize the romantic obsession with concrete particularity and its own manipulation of it through aesthetici- zation, both are sensitive to the vulnerability of qualitative reality in the face of the power of abstract rationality. According to Lukics, under the imperative of "technical" and "economic autonomy" in the sphere of production, "the human qualities and idiosyncrasies of the worker appear increasingly as mere sources of error when contrasted with. .. abstract special laws functioning according to rational predictions" (HCC 89). The principle of rationalization "must declare war" on these material manifestation of the "irrational" (HCC 88). But to discerning observers this is only part of the story: "The ratio- nalization of the world appears to be complete," says Lukaics (HCC 101). This only "apparently" omnipotent element of rationalization is in fact merely a component within a dualism that itself actually obtains in reality. It is a dualism, that according to Schmitt, has a structural basis in fact and takes on many incarnations: "Although it sounds improba- 41. Lukdcs, History and Class Consciousness 88.

Their point of departure is actually a real cleavage and division: an antithesis which calls for a synthesis" (RC 16). The economic-technical rational- ism of modernity, so entirely devoid of content, is interrelated with the very opposite of that rationalism, that in its role as opposite has as little valid pretense to reality as the rationality it opposes. One cannot appre- hend the whole by privileging one side as the superior or truer reality over the other. Hence Schmitt's earlier suspicion of Daiubler's ability to formulate an articulate rational standpoint when he opposes a tota- lyzing rationality with an equally totalized spirituality. Reiterating the arguments of Political Romanticism, Schmitt sets out the typology of the "radical dualism" that governs "every sphere of the contemporary epoch:" Its common ground is a concept of nature that has found its realization in a world transformed by technology and industry. Nature appears today as the polar antithesis of the mechanistic world of big cities whose stone, iron and glass structures lie on the face of the earth like colossal Cubist creations. The antithesis of this empire of technology is nature untouched by civilization, wild and barbarian - a reserva- tion into which "man with his affliction does not set foot." (RC 16-17) Likewise, Lukics points out in History that "nature is a social cate- gory" (HCC 130), reminding us that this untouched nature that suppos- edly exists outside the realm of modem rationalization is itself an ideological construct that conforms with rationalization. Schmitt points out the many variations that the oppositions, of which the technology/ nature one is just a single example, may take: Classicism/Romanticism, abstract/concrete, form/content, objective/subjective, rationality/irratio- nality, "mute practicality"/ "rapturously overpowering music", etc. - "A whole assortment of antitheses with which to play!" (RC 39) In Political Romanticism Schmitt observed how people latch on to one or another side of these antitheses and come up with "unexpected and absurd associations" (PR 6). The association that Schmitt finds par- ticularly irksome in both books is the romantic connection of Catholi- cism with the pole of nature, irrationality, and sentimentality. In Political Romanticism Schmitt expresses discomfort with the fact that the major examples of romantics that he analyzes such as MUller and Schlegel all converted to Catholicism (PR 32). He tries to dissociate</page><page sequence="23">John P. McCormick 155 them from "active" Catholics like Bonald, Maistre, Donoso Cortes, and the closet-Catholic, Burke.42 He angrily asserts no such correlation (PR 49) and points out how Protestantism as easily as Catholicism can be mistakenly identified as an expression of Romanticism (PR 12, 14). The romantic attempt to associate the Roman Church with the latter sides of these oppositions, "to make the Church into the antagonistic pole of the mechanistic age," only serves the perpetuation of the first side of the antitheses and the whole of the mechanistic age itself (RC 19). Like Ddiubler's poem, the Church would then be a mere "complement" to the age: "Were the Church to have rested content with being nothing more than the soulful polarity of soullessness it would have forgotten its true self; it would have become the desired complement to capitalism - a hygienic institution for enduring the rigors of competition, a Sunday outing or a summer sojourn of big-city dwellers" (RC 19-20). Drawing upon the origins of modem philosophical rationalism much as Schmitt did in Political Romanticism and continues to do in Politi- cal Form, Lukics describes how enlightenment philosophy from Des- cartes to Kant conceives of the world as the product of the knowing subject by means of mathematics and geometry which are derived from the "formal presuppositions of objectivity in general" (HCC 111-12). Unable to account for the thing-in-itself, enlightenment philosophy turns increasingly "inwards" to find the subject from which knowledge can be derived (HCC 122). But Kantian rationality illustrates not only how "every rational system will strike a frontier or barrier of irrationality," but also because of the penetration of abstract rationality into all aspects of society through the commodification of everything, why irrationality "erodes and dissolves the whole system" (HCC 114). Lukacs theorizes economic-technical rationality and romantic intui- tions as part of the same structure through the analysis of the Marxian category of the "fetish character of commodities" that takes on both "an objective form" and "a subjective stance" (HCC 84). The two poles are "inextricably interwoven with each other. For here we can see that 'nature' has been heavily marked by the revolutionary struggle of the bourgeoisie: the 'ordered,' calculable, formal, and abstract character [of nature, in addition to nature as] the repository of all the inner tendencies opposing the growth of mechanization, dehumanization, and reification" 42. See Schmitt, Political Romanticism 32. Schmitt goes so far as to suggest in 1919 that the counter-revolutionaries were "real" Catholics, something he retracts in 1922 when he acknowledges the apostasy of their insistence on the evil of human nature: see Schmitt PT 57.</page><page sequence="24">156 Transcending Weber (HCC 136). The non-rational is set forth by the rational system itself: "For irrationality, the impossibility of reducing contents to their rational elements . . . can be seen at its crudest in the question of relating the sen- suous content to the rational form.'43 Kantian rationality, rather than increasing rationalization, actually accentuates and encourages irrational- ity because 1) it cannot account for "the whole" - the source of the rational system in terms of the system itself; and 2) it cannot fully abstract from the concreteness of its objects (HCC 116). The unrational- ized nature is hence a source for a revival in "ecstasy," "resignation and despair," "irrational mystical experience" - "life" in the Nietzschean sense (HCC 110). In other words, that which is not rationalized is instead aestheticized. LukAcs speaks of the resulting "ever-increasing importance of aesthetics" in this regard and how this new social development "con- ferred upon aesthetics and upon consciousness of art philosophical impor- tance that art was unable to lay claim to in previous ages" (HCC 137). Typically less economically-sensitive than his marxist alter ego, Schmitt attributes the relationship of the poles of the antinomies to more voluntaristic sources. He however still emphasizes the importance of economics and aesthetics. Several years later, Schmitt describes how the nineteenth century is "characterized by the seemingly impossible combination of aesthetic-romantic and economic-technical tendencies," yet again demonstrates how in fact the two tendencies are conjoined. Romanticism, according to Schmitt, is only an intermediary step of the aesthetic situated in between the mor- alism of the eighteenth century and the economism of the nineteenth. It was only a transition which was affected easily and successfully by means of the aestheticization of all intellectual fields. For the path from metaphysics and morality to economics proceeds through the aesthetic. This path, traversing the most sublime state of aesthetic con- sumption and pleasure, is the safest and most comfortable path towards a general economization of the spiritual life and towards a state of mind which finds in production and consumption its central categories of human existence.44 The subjective morality of the eighteenth century, a subjectivity freed from the constraints of religion and dogma, gives way in the nineteenth- 43.

McCormick 157 century to the subjective aesthetic appreciation of objects, again a realm once governed by traditional restraints. The romantic, as Schmitt had observed in Political Romanticism, seeks out objects and situations as mere "occasions" for the expression of his or her subjective feelings. Lukics, following Marx, attributes this phenomenon to the other moment of the commodity. The use-value of the commodity is determined by the qualitatively specific and concrete modes of labor that produce it and as such invites an aesthetic absorption with the particular qualitative and concrete attributes of things - an arbitrarily subjective ascription of con- tent to particular objects.45 Schmitt recognizes, as did Marx and does Lukaics, that this aestheticization runs not in opposition to a simultaneous "economization," but is rather its "typical accompanying phenomena.'46 In the portions of Political Romanticism added to the edition pub- lished after Political Form, Schmitt describes certain ramifications of this subjectivity: "In this society, it is left to the private individual to be his own priest. But not only that. Because of the central significance and consistency of the religious it is also left to him to be his own poet, his own philosopher, his own king, and his own master-builder in the Cathedral of his personality" (PR 20). In other words, art, philosophy, politics, psychology, as well as religion become sites of subjective expression, of personal aestheticization. Anything, the revolution of 1789, or Catholicism itself, can become matter for aesthetic consump- tion (RC 20, 60). As Schmitt remarked in the 1919 text of Political Romanticism, there is nothing wrong with aesthetics qua aesthetics, pro- vided it remains in its appropriate field. However there are certain dis- quieting ramifications of the modem romantic tendency to aestheticize anything, indeed everything, and with this LukAcs fully agrees: in the aesthetic mode, conceived as broadly as possible, [the contents of life] may be salvaged from the deadening effects of the mechanism of reification. But only in so far as these contents become aesthetic. That is to say, either the world must be aestheticized, which is an eva- sion of the real problem. . . . Or else, the aesthetic principle must be elevated into the principle by which objective reality is shaped: but that would be to mythologize the discovery of intuitive understanding.

It remains to be seen whether expressions of Lukics's and Schmitt's thought ought not to be included in this group. Lukics remarks of Romanticism, "what would seem to be the high- point of the interiorization of nature [characteristic of Romanticism] really implies the abandonment of any true understanding of it. To make moods into the content presupposes the existence of unpenetrated and impenetrable objects (things-in-themselves) just as much as do the laws of nature" (HCC 214). Agreeing with Schmitt's criticism of the objects of "romantic productivity," Lukacs sees "irrational" aesthetic Romanticism itself as a form of positivism - an unreflected and mechanical accepting of what is given - as much as economic-techni- cal rationality, as stated previously, is a form of irrationality - an avoidance of a reality that must be taken into account in any serious theoretical endeavor. In such hyper-rational thinking "thought regresses to the level of a naive, dogmatic rationalism: somehow it regards the mere actuality of the irrational contents of the concepts as nonexistent. (This metaphysics may also conceal its real nature behind the formula that these contents are 'irrelevant' to knowledge)" (HCC 118). The persistence of positivism and Romanticism creates a problem for modem ethics and action: In the absence of a real, concrete solution the dilemma of freedom and necessity, of voluntarism and fatalism is simply shunted into a side issue. That is to say, in nature and in the "external world" laws still operate with inexorable necessity, while freedom and the autonomy that is supposed to result from the discovery of the ethical world are reduced to a mere point ofview from which to judge internal events... . [This] duality is itself introduced into the subject. (HCC 124-25) Ethics first becomes disengaged from the world and then becomes split into either a purely formal type which purifies the discourse of ethics 47.

This Kantian dilemma of a rationality that divorces ethics from the world and that generates irrationality within it, as elucidated by Schmitt and Lukics thus becomes played out in Weberian practice. Lukics writes: The reified world appears henceforth quite definitively ... as the only possible world, the only conceptually accessible, comprehensible world vouchsafed to us humans. Whether this gives rise to ecstasy, resignation or despair, whether we search for a path leading to "life" via irrational mystical experience, this will do absolutely nothing to modify the situation as it is in fact. (HCC 110) Lukics does not designate the irrational as does Weber as an emo- tional or psychological response to rationalization but rather as a differ- ent component of the modem mode of production that itself is misrecognized as having only a rationalizing effect by Weberian catego- ries: the celebration of the concrete qualitative elements of modernity by Romanticism are engendered by the use-value moment of commodifica- tion that, hidden by the quantifying moment of exchange-value, emerges inevitably in a non-rational as opposed to in a rationally mediated man- ner. However, irrationality's basis in a particular historical practice implies that it can be overcome by a change in that practice as opposed to being simply willed away by Weber's attempt to ridicule and sup- press the romantic impulse in others and force it to conform with the objective reality of the times by encouraging only appropriately "responsible" subjective stances toward it. This ridicule, suppression, and compulsion reveal the "rationality" of Weber to be itself latently irrational. According to Lukics, the fear of what cannot be apprehended through scientific means in the Weberian paradigm is sublimated into an increased reification of those means, which consequently ascertain less and less, further intensifying the original fear and demand more confor- mity with objective reality: The attempt to eliminate every element of content and of the irrational affects not only the object but also to an increasing extent, the subject. The critical elucidation of contemplation puts more and more energy into its efforts to weed out ruthlessly from its own outlook every sub- jective and irrational element and every anthropomorphic tendency; it</page><page sequence="28">160 Transcending Weber strives with ever increasing vigor to drive a wedge between the subject of knowledge and "man," and to transform the knower into a pure and purely formal subject. (HCC 128) Schmitt and Lukics would certainly have most readily recognized this disposition in Weber. In fact, the "Vocation" lectures make a perfect case study for this kind of dynamic: the more Weber champions the objectiv- ity of his scientific method in the "Science" essay, the more he must nec- essarily point up the drawbacks inherent in it. As a result, as his lecture continues, the scientific method is defended less as a rational procedure than as an existential stance. Consequently his attacks on those who he considers irrational become more personally polemical and themselves irrational: that is, "it is weakness not to be able to countenance the stem seriousness of our fateful times" ("Science" 149, emphasis added - JM). The result in the "Politics" lecture, the solution to a disenchanted, value-free world is the resolute, but still only subjectively justified, per- sonal stand ("Politics" 127-28). The ethics of responsibility supposedly entail more appreciation of objective reality than the ethics of con- science, but Weber gives no evidence of how this slips any less precipi- tously into a "warring gods" position. Hence Weber's attempt to purify his methodological standpoint (value neutrality) serves to intensify the potential irrationality of his own political positions (value stances).48 The failure of modem rationality to account for concrete reality - rationalization's reduction of it to quantitative measurements suitable for technological production and Romanticism's attribution of qualities gen- erated subjectively from the idiosyncrasies of the observer - has ramifi- cations for action. The only possible resulting activity is technical manipulation, however impressively carried out by modem machinery, or detached observation, however intensely experienced by the individ- ual subject. Like Schmitt who asserted that both the commercial activ- ity of industrialism and the aesthetic activity of Romanticism were 48. Along these lines, see Richard Wolin's criticism of John Patrick Diggins's cele- bration of Weber's "liberalism" in Max Weber: Politics: Politics and the Spirit of Tragedy (New York: Basic Books, 1996): Wolin, "Liberalism as a Vocation," The New Republic 215. 10 (2 Sept. 1996). The work of Stephen Holmes perhaps best exemplifies contempo- rary "Weberian" liberalism: Holmes prioritizes as the central task of liberal politics the containment and redirection of human irrationality in Passions and Constraint: On The Political Theory ofLiberal Democracy (Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1995), and he ruthlessly assails romantically-inclined critics of liberalism and the Enlightenment who he identifies as dangerous expressions of this irrationality in The Anatomy of Antiliberalism (Cam- bridge: Harvard UP, 1993).</page><page sequence="29">John P. McCormick 161 inherently passive in Political Romanticism, Lukics also claims that the Cartesian-Kantian rationality that makes possible the mere manipula- tion of objects stripped of quality is contemplative activity, not practice (HCC 89). As the worker contributes nothing intelligent to the mode of production, his or her work is reactive and not creative, conforming only to pre-existing forms, and hence is inherently passive: Neither objectively nor in his relation to his work does man appear as the authentic master of the process; on the contrary he is a mechanical part incorporated into a mechanical system. He finds it already pre- existing and self-sufficient, it functions independently of him and he has to conform to its laws whether he likes it or not. As labour is pro- gressively rationalized and mechanized his lack of will is reinforced by the way in which his activity becomes less and less active and more and more contemplative. The contemplative stance adopted towards a process mechanically conforming to fixed laws enacted independently of man's consciousness and impervious to human intervention, i. e., a perfectly closed system, must likewise transform man's immediate attitude to the world. (HCC 89) The idea of qualitative reality being realized in the a priori Kantian forms is abandoned here as a pacifying rather than realizing process: "the abstract, quantitative mode of calculability shows itself here in its purest form: the reified mind necessarily sees it as the form in which its own authentic immediacy becomes manifest and - as reified con- sciousness - does not even attempt to transcend it" (HCC 93). The "iron cage" is hence a misrecognition of the role of production in modernity. The predictability of the rationalization process narrows human activity to that which is already pre-ordained, blinding it to the fact that it could in fact actively change the process itself. How to overcome this passivity engendered by the ostensible cleavage of what Schmitt identifies as "totally rationalized production" and "completely irrational consumption" becomes increasingly a political as much as theoretical question in these works under consideration. The Pope and the Party In Political Form, Schmitt engages head on Weber's now chauvinis- tic, now repentant attributing to Protestantism the glories and horrors of modem rationality and poses a particular cultural-political alternative that 49. Cf. Feenberg 95, 104-05.</page><page sequence="30">162 Transcending Weber will transcend the ossified contradictions and the entrenched passivity of the rationalization thesis: political Catholicism. Economic-technical ratio- nality ushered in by Protestantism maintains rules which pertain not to people as such, but rather to objects in a scheme of production, consump- tion, and efficiency - mere "matter." Schmitt asserts that Catholic ratio- nalism, on the other hand, is not indifferent to what persons are or what they do, as are the "laws" of the market and of science. For Schmitt, there is a difference between rules that govern human behavior and those that deal with the inanimate - that which is without life. Schmitt, still in 1923 a believing Catholic, claims that in the valueless rationality of eco- nomic-technical thought is found the "fundamental antithesis to the polit- ical idea of Catholicism" (RC 23). He asserts that the rationality of the Roman Church, despite its universalism, has actually defended local par- ticularities of many sorts even when their enemy was not necessarily an enemy of the Church (RC 11). Schmitt finds it ironic that Protestant opponents of Catholicism would identify it as a mechanical force, "a papal machine," "a monstrous hierarchical power apparatus" (RC 6; see ES 809). Appropriating Weber into his apologia, Schmitt declares that it is of course Protestantism and its accompanying rationality that actually levels all the particularities of nature mechanically: The Huguenot and the Puritan has a strength and pride that is often inhuman. He is capable of living on any soil. But it would be wrong to say he finds roots on every soil. He can build his industry far and wide, make all soil the servant of his skilled labor and "inner-worldly asceticism," and in the end have a comfortable home; all this because he makes himself master of nature and harnesses it to his will. His type of domination remains inaccessible to the Roman-Catholic con- cept of nature. (RC 17-18) Catholicism accommodates and maintains all sorts of concrete partic- ularities, in spite of, or because of, its impressive universalism. The Protestants sought subjective substance when rebelling against the Church, whose dogma they deemed too formalistic. But it is the result of their asceticism that threatens the existence of concrete difference in the modem world from which they themselves now shrink back: It is a striking contradiction. .. that one of the strongest Protestant per- ceptions finds in Roman Catholicism a debasement and misuse of Christianity because it mechanizes religion into a soulless formality, while at the same time Protestants return in romantic flight to the</page><page sequence="31">John P. McCormick 163 Catholic Church seeking salvation from the soullessnes of a rationalis- tic and mechanistic age. (RC 19) The Church is neither the mechanically formalistic entity scorned by Protestants nor the haven of unconquered nature and irrational expres- sion lauded by Romantics. According to Schmitt, it stands above such antinomies, absorbs, maintains, and transcends them: "The Catholic Church is a complex of opposites, a complexio oppositorum. There is apparently no antitheses that it does not embrace" (RC 12). Roman Catholicism is a form not indifferent to content, nor is it an irrational elevation of content to an exalted level, according to Schmitt: From the standpoint of the political idea of Catholicism the essence of the Roman-Catholic complexio oppositorum lies in a specific, formal superiority over the matter of human life in a way no other imperium has ever known. It has succeeded in constituting a sustaining configu- ration of historical and social reality that despite its formal character, retains its concrete existence at once vital and yet rational to the nth degree. This formal character of Roman Catholicism is based on the strict realization of the principle of representation. In its particularity this becomes most clear in its antithesis to the economic-technical thinking dominant today. (RC 14) Unlike the quantitative methods of representing in modern politics and economics, Catholicism does not proceed by counting or measur- ing the numerical indications of its objects of concern, but rather emphasizes precisely that there is a quality inherent in them that tran- scends mere materiality: "Economic thinking knows only one type of form, namely technical precision, and nothing could be further from the idea of representation. The association of the economic with the techni- cal. .. requires the actual presence of things" (RC 15). Criticizing the kind of Marxism that Lukics was trying to elevate beyond crude mate- rialist dogma at that very moment, Schmitt mentions the Soviets' con- ception of representation which seeks to eliminate the "idea" lurking within traditional substantive theories: In the springtide of socialism young Bolsheviks turned the struggle for economic-technical thinking into a struggle against the idea, even against every idea. So long as even the ghost of an idea exists so also does the notion that something preceded the given reality of material things - that there is something transcendent - and this always means an authority "from above." To a type of thinking which derives its</page><page sequence="32">164 Transcending Weber norms from the economic-technical sphere this appears as an outside interference, a disturbance of the self-propelling machine. (RC 45) The Soviets' positivistic fear that material reality may be more than just that is aroused by a Catholicism, according to Schmitt, which is the only institution left that maintains the position within a rational scheme that there is more to material reality than what is positively apparent. For Schmitt, Catholic representation is able to maintain the claim that material reality, especially as manifested in human life, is more than quantitatively apprehended material, without at the same time slipping into the romantic and irrationalist random ascription of transcendent meaning to particular objects. Now rebelling against the ideal types that he once employed himself, Schmitt criticizes what Max Weber calls "disenchantment" without ini- tially reverting to a notion of enchantment. Through a "juridical," or "institutional" rationality, the Church asserts that life is not mere mat- ter while at the same time "knowingly and magnificently succeeding in overcoming Dionysian cults, ecstasies, [etc.]." This "juridical" rational- ity that navigates between positivism and irrationality is exemplified by the Catholic institution of offices: The Pope is not the Prophet but the Vicar of Christ. Such a ceremonial function precludes all the fanatical excesses of an unbridled prophet- ism. The fact that the office is made independent of charisma signifies that the priest upholds a position which appears to be completely apart from his concrete personality. Nevertheless he is not the functionary and commissar of republican thinking. (RC 23-24) Weber had recognized that the offices of the Catholic Church were not sources of what Schmitt calls "the fanatical excess" associated with charisma: "the bishop, the priest and the preacher are in fact no longer, as in early Christian times, carriers of a purely personal charisma, which offers other-worldly sacred values under the personal mandate of a master" (ES 1141). But Weber went on to write that "they have become officials in the service of a functional purpose, a purpose which in the present day 'church' appears at once impersonalized and ideolog- ically sanctified" (ES 959). In response, Schmitt wants to maintain that the Catholic "juridical" theory of offices falls between the poles of irra- tional devotion to the concrete personality of the priest, on the one hand, and the recognition of the purely formal function of the office, on</page><page sequence="33">John P. McCormick 165 the other. Such an office is not impersonalized in the hyper-rational way that Weber claims, yet nor is it an expression of irrationality. Catholic reality - transcending form/content oppositions as it does in Schmitt's theorization - eludes Weber's categories. Priestly office is not purely formal or functional precisely because of its connection to what might be seen, according to Schmitt, as a reason that human life can never be deemed "mere matter": "God become man in historical reality" (RC 32). As Schmitt writes, "In contradistinction to the modern official [the priest's] position is not impersonal because his office is part of an unbroken chain linked with the personal mandate and concrete person of Christ" (RC 24). Jesus Christ is the symbol of the divinity within humanity, the "dignity" that transcends biology. Thus, for Schmitt, the representative authority of Catholicism is a form that bears the qualita- tive substance that transhistorically makes humanity more than mere matter - materialized divinity: The political power of Catholicism rests neither on economic nor mil- itary means but rather on the absolute realization of authority. The Church is a 'juridical person,' though not in the same sense as a joint- stock company. The typical product of the age of production is a method of accounting, whereas the Church is a concrete personal rep- resentation of a concrete personality. (RC 22) Using the "Protestant Ethic" thesis against Weber's own position, Schmitt asserts that it is Protestantism that privatizes politics and hence extracts the concrete representative element from politics: Historically considered "privatization" has its origin in religion. The first right of the individual in the sense of the bourgeois social order was freedom of religion. In the historical evolution of the catalogue of liberties - freedom of belief and conscience, freedom of association and assembly, freedom of trade and commerce - it is the fountainhead and first principle. But whatever place is assigned to religion it always and everywhere manifests its capacity to absorb and absolutize. If reli- gion is a private matter it also follows that privacy is revered. The two are inseparable. Private property is thus revered precisely because it is a private matter. (RC 47-48) The sacralization of privacy inhibits the practice of displaying publicly that which is of importance and depreciates the public sphere which was once an arena for the representation of what is most important. The modem public sphere is a collection of private property owners vying to promote</page><page sequence="34">166 Transcending Weber their own material interests. Thus these participants are no longer "repre- sentatives" in any real sense. The result is a society devoid of fully sub- stantive figures; roles become economic-technical functions (RC 32, 47). The representational quality of Catholicism, on the other hand, expresses itself in "public" and especially "juridical" terms for Schmitt: the Church is "the true heir of Roman jurisprudence" and the embodi- ment of "Christ become man in historical reality" (RC 23). In History Lukdcs also addresses his analysis to the position of law in modem soci- ety without the Catholic dogma, but perhaps prologuing his own shift to a kind of theology. He draws upon Weber's sociology of law (ES, chap. 8) to again emphasize the correlation between modem rationality and irrationality: the law becomes increasingly suspended between a position represented by the "critical" (Lukdcs's own often ironic quotation marks) legal theorist Hans Kelsen, who theorizes law as a "gapless" system that is mechanically applied by jurists (HCC 95-97) or, on the other hand, a position that theorizes the judge as an arbitrary legislator acting differ- ently case to case (HCC 108) - that is., purely formally-derived versus purely content-derived adjudication: "In jurisprudence ... the question of whether the qualitative content can be understood by means of a ratio- nal, calculating approach is [seen] as a question of form versus content" (HCC 107), and it is here that the antinomies perhaps most starkly reveal themselves incapable of dissolution by "bourgeois thought:" Such a synthesis would only be possible if philosophy were able to change its approach radically and concentrate on the concrete material totality of what can and should be known. Only then would it be able to break through the barriers erected by a formalism that has degener- ated into a state of complete fragmentation. But this would presuppose an awareness of the causes, the genesis and the necessity of this for- malism; moreover, it would not be enough to unite the special sci- ences mechanically: they would have to be transformed inwardly by an inwardly synthesizing philosophical method. It is evident that the philosophy of bourgeois society is incapable of this. Not that the desire for synthesis is absent; nor can it be maintained that the best people have welcomed with open arms a mechanical existence hostile to life and a scientific formalism alien to it. But a radical change in outlook is not feasible on the soil of bourgeois society. (HCC 109-10) Schmitt, a lawyer by training and profession, also brought Weber's framework to bear upon his legal work before the 1920s.50 In fact these earliest legal treatises can be read as an attempt to carve out a place for</page><page sequence="35">John P. McCormick 167 the judge akin to Weber's sociological observer and Lukics's critic, and one that takes care that the judge neither degenerates into an "automa- ton" nor an unrestrained "legislator" - that is, one who is neither slave to the objective formalism of the law, nor one who reigns as the all-pow- erful subjective creator of it. In these early formulations, the judge only "creates" the law to the extent that he or she imparts some of their sub- jective personality to each concretely specific case, with attention to the forms of the law and the practice of other judges. But the inability to definitively solve the automaton versus legislator paradigm of Weber's formulation and its neo-Kantian methodology ignites a radically new methodology in his 1922 Political Theology. In this work originally writ- ten for inclusion in a volume dedicated to Weber,51 Schmitt explodes the Weberian dichotomy with its first sentence: "Sovereign is he who decides the exception" (PT 5). Reframing the methodology to give pre- eminence not to the a priori forms but rather to the concrete case which in its persistent novelty is ever an exception, Schmitt initiates a method where qualitative existence takes precedence over mechanically lifeless forms that Schmitt now deems wholly "torpid" (PT 15).52 In addition Schmitt criticizes the neo-Kantian jurist Kelsen even more harshly than does Lukacs as the foremost advocate of the excessive for- malism that banishes the personal element from the law: "The objectivity that he claimed for himself amounted to no more than avoiding every- thing personalistic and tracing the legal order back to the impersonal validity of an impersonal norm" (PT 29). Schmitt also accuses Kelsen, 50. See Gesetz und Urteil: Eine Untersuchung zum Problem der Rechtspraxis ([1912] Miinchen: Beck, 1969); and Der Wert des Staates und die Bedeutung des Einzel- nen (Ttibingen: Mohr [Siebeck], 1914). Ulmen discusses the impact of Weber's thought on these works: 108-10. See McCormick, Carl Schmitt's Critique of Liberalism, Chap. 5, for an account of Schmitt's legal theory. 51. See Schwab, "Introduction" to Political Theology xv nl1. 52. Many have hence interpreted this as a wholesale regression into irrationalism on the part of Schmitt, but the subsequent appearance of Political Form exhibits the norma- tive framework that Schmitt still maintained at this time. Rather than a totally unencum- bered official or judge dictating solely in accord with the irregularities of a particular exceptional instance, Richard Thoma had it more correct when he observed that Schmitt's ultimate aim was more likely: "An alliance between a nationalistic dictator and the Catho- lic Church that could be the real solution [to contemporary problems] and achieve a defini- tive restoration of order, discipline, and hierarchy" ("On the Ideology of Parliamentarism" [1925], trans. by Ellen Kennedy and included as an Appendix to her edition of Parlamen- tarismus 82). For a plausible interpretation of the relationship of Schmitt's Catholicism to his political orientation in this period, see Renato Cristi, "Carl Schmitt on Liberalism, Democracy and Catholicism," History of Political Thought XIV.2 (Summer 1993).</page><page sequence="36">168 Transcending Weber the hyper-rationalist, of fostering precisely an irrationalism in adjudica- tion and application by purging everything but the most formal require- ments from legal consideration (cf. PT 30). The formalist jurisprudence marginalizes so much concrete content from its supposedly purified legal system that this allows for it to reemerge as irrational content in unprincipled state activity at the non-juridical level.53 Having traced out the existence and effects of the dualisms or antino- mies in almost every facet of modem life (economy, philosophy, ethics, aesthetics, and the law) both authors approach a breaking point when it becomes clear that the transcending of these oppositions, for which they have consistently called, can no longer be avoided. This point is reached when the topic of leadership emerges. For the most important result of the ossified dualities of modernity is that they have fostered a vacuum of leadership, at precisely the moment when it appears that global domina- tion by the bourgeoisie has been achieved. As Lukics declares: "On the one hand, [the bourgeoisie] acquires increasing control over the details of its social existence, subjecting them to its needs. On the other hand it loses - likewise progressively - the possibility of gaining intellectual control of society as a whole and with that it loses its own qualifica- tions for leadership" (HCC 121). Kantianism has taken the antinomies, dualisms - contradictions - of bourgeois society as far as it can go "on the plane of philosophy. .. in thought" (HCC 121). Someone else must do so in action. Because of the inherent passivity of the kind of activity of the bourgeoisie - the technological transformation of the nature, the formal manipulation of matter, or the aesthetic enrapture with it - the most obvious manifestations of their thinking is positivism and Romanticism. The former position abstracts away too distantly from concrete reality, the other fixates upon it in its own subjective manner while not apprehending its concrete reality any better. The qualitative moments of modernity hence remain inaccessible to the bourgeois mindset and meaningful praxis beyond its ability: 53. In retrospect Luk~tcs remarks that Schmitt "was entirely in the right about liberal neo-Kantianism, as indeed he was in his sometimes ingenious polemic against liberal soci- ology. ... He often saw clear through the unsubstantiated dogmatism masquerading as strict epistemology by which neo-Kantians converted justice into an autonomous, self-legit- imizing area, on the pattern of its epistemology or aesthetics" (The Destruction of Reason 652-54). On German neo-Kantian, or "positivist," jurisprudence in general, see Peter Carl Caldwell, "Legal Positivism and Weimar Democracy," American Journal of Jurisprudence 39.1 (Spring 1995); on Schmitt and Kelsen, see David Dyzenhaus, "'Now the Machine Runs Itself: Carl Schmitt on Hobbes and Kelsen," Cardozo Law Review 16.1 (Aug. 1994).</page><page sequence="37">John P. McCormick 169 In order to overcome the question of the irrationality of the thing-in- itself it is not enough that the attempt should be made to transcend the contemplative attitude. When the question is formulated more con- cretely it turns out that the essence of praxis consists in annulling that indiference ofform towards content that we found in the problem of the thing-in-itself. Thus praxis can only be really established as a philo- sophical principle if, at the same time, a conception of form can be found whose basis and validity no longer rest on that pure rationality and that freedom from every definition of content. In so far as the prin- ciple of praxis is the prescription for changing reality, it must be tailored to the concrete material substratum of action if it is to impinge upon it to any effect .... Theory and praxis in fact refer to the same objects, for every object exists as an immediate inseparable complex of form and content. ... The very moment when ... the indissoluble links that bind the contemplative attitude of the subject to the purely formal character of the object of knowledge become conscious, it is inevitable either that the attempt to find a solution to the problem of irrationality ... should be abandoned or that it should be sought in praxis. (HCC 125-26) Since this "material substratum" is where all real activity and change occurs the bourgeoisie abdicate their position of leadership by ceasing to act upon it, or rather interact with it, in a substantive manner. We know from the titles of their works, who, Lukacs and Schmitt respec- tively, think is necessarily poised to fill this vacuum: the proletariat and the Catholic Church. Lukics wishes to appropriate the leadership of society through class conflict; Schmitt, the leadership of the state with Churchly authority, initially, and, as will be explained, nationalist con- flict, ultimately. How is the reactionary action of the Church and the revolutionary action of the Proletariat to be facilitated? Just a few pages before embarking upon "The Standpoint of the Pro- letariat" section of History, Lukics states that "in the case of almost every insoluble problem we perceive that the search for a solution leads us to history" (HCC 143). According to Lukacs, history points the way to the overcoming of form and content, sheer rationality and aestheti- cized whim: "It is only in history, in the historical process, in the unin- terrupted outpouring of what is qualitatively new that the requisite paradigmatic order can be found in the realm of things" (HCC 144). A quantitative rationality such as that manifested in at least certain aspects of Weber's methodology projects what is linearly derived into the future and cannot see qualitative change - hence the fatalism of his "iron cage" thesis. But qualitative reality makes itself known to those of a more dialectical theoretical orientation.</page><page sequence="38">170 Transcending Weber At times presented as thoroughly overwhelmed by abstractly formal and quantitative methodology, Lukacs declares that ultimately it is the awakening qualitatively concrete that will actually take vengeance on the abstract: "Since the method, having become abstract and contempla- tive, now as a result falsifies and does violence to history, it follows that history will gain its revenge and violate the method which has failed to integrate it, tearing it to pieces" (HCC 148). This is reminis- cent of Schmitt's account of how the political exception strikes back at a liberalism which had hitherto ignored or repressed it: "In the excep- tion, the power of real life breaks through the crust of a mechanism that has become torpid by repetition" (PT 15). In fact Lukaics's description of the economic crisis - the self-assertion of concrete life - functions in the same way towards the reputed "regularity" of the capitalist econ- omy as Schmitt's exception functions regarding liberalism: The disregard of the concrete aspects of the subject matter of these laws is based, makes itself felt in the incoherence of the system in fact. This incoherence becomes particularly egregious in periods of crisis. . .. In moments of crisis the qualitative existence of the 'things' that lead their lives beyond the purview of economics as misunderstood and neglected things-in-themselves, as use-values, suddenly becomes the decisive factor. (HCC 101, 105) "Things," once just relative amounts of labor time in a smoothly run- ning economy, become very real in times of economic "bust." Sud- denly they become an abundance of chairs, refrigerators, canned goods, etc. that suddenly are scarce or conversely overabundant. The most important object "thingified" by capitalism, the worker, also emerges as him or herself in a time of crisis and claims their right as producer and human being - the nexus where form and content/object and subject and historical change coincide: For the unity of the subject and object, of thought and existence which the "action" undertook to prove and to exhibit finds both its fulfillment and its substratum in the unity of the genesis of the determinants of thought and of the history of the evolution of reality. But to comprehend this unity it is necessary both to discover the site from which to resolve all these problems and also to exhibit concretely the "we" which is the subject of history, that "we" whose action is in fact history. (HCC 145) The proletariats who exist at the site of qualitative production -</page><page sequence="39">John P. McCormick 171 indeed are the actors of qualitative production - and whose concrete specificity is most dramatically converted into abstract quantity by capi- talism, become conscious of these realities and therewith take their place as knowing agents of historical change, the "we" of history: The social existence of the proletariat is far more powerfully affected by the dialectical character of the historical process. ... For the prole- tariat to become aware of the dialectical nature of its existence is a matter of life and death.... The quantitative differences in exploita- tion which appear to the capitalist in the form of quantitative determi- nants of the objects of his calculation, must appear to the worker as the decisive, qualitative categories of his whole physical, mental, and moral existence. (HCC 164, 166) When the worker knows himself as a commodity his knowledge is practical. That is to say, this knowledge brings about an objective structural change in the object of knowledge. In this consciousness and through it the special objective character of labor as a commodity, its "use-value" ... which like every use-value is submerged without a trace in the quantitative exchange categories of capitalism, now awak- ens and becomes social reality. ... The specific nature of this kind of commodity had consisted in the fact that beneath the cloak of the thing lay a relation among men, that beneath the quantifying crust there was a qualitative, living core. (HCC 169) When this "social reality" becomes apparent to the proletariat it is left for them to - perhaps violently - seize the reins of leadership from the now historically obsolete bourgeoisie: The instant that this consciousness arises and goes beyond what is immediately given we find in concentrated form the basic issue of the class struggle: the problem of force. For this is the point where the "eternal laws" of capitalist economics fail and become dialectical and are thus compelled to surrender the decisions regarding the fate of his- tory to the conscious actions of men. (HCC 178) Schmitt's depiction of Catholicism in Political Form, oppressively frightening even at first glance, becomes even more so when Schmitt's own polemical strategy becomes clear. Catholicism, which in Schmitt's estimation in Political Form is a perfect marriage of form and content, a "complex of opposites," by its nature makes frequent alliances with the most varied political entities - hence the constant charges of political opportunism leveled against it (RC 5-6). But</page><page sequence="40">172 Transcending Weber knowing who to make one's friend entails knowing who to make one's enemy, the former category having no meaning in Schmitt's world-view without the latter.54 Schmitt concludes the work with an exhortation to the now leaderless forces of Europe - liberal, social- ist, or conservative; Catholic, Protestant, or Jew - to unite under the banner of Catholicism in a cultural-political crusade against the "athe- istic-anarchistic" spirit of soviet Russia (RC 64). As Schmitt's rela- tionship with the church deteriorates over the complexities of his marital situation not long after the appearance of Political Form, he replaces the religiously organized, pan-European vision of the work with a more nationalistically driven one in the conclusion of the 1923 edition of Parlamentarismus. The Russian enemy remains the same.55 Both authors thus perceive a dramatic structural transformation in European society that most liberals - to some extent Weber included56 - sought to ignore. Recognizing that abstract and formal theories of society and politics were obsolete in the contemporary incipient welfare-state fusing of state and society,57 Lukacs and Schmitt sought to formulate theories that let concrete manifestations of social existence - substances whose actualities were occluded by the generalized categories of the nineteenth century - exert them- selves in the context of the emerging primacy of the political. Schmitt's solution58 is a top-down lending of substance to the previ- ously "neutral" state - be it through clerical sanction or nationalist fervor. Lukics's solution is bottom-up, "truly" delivering to the prole- tariat - the content that transcends form and content oppositions - 54. Schmitt is perhaps most famous for the friend/enemy thesis that he explicitly elaborated in 1927. See the full length version of Der Begriff des Politischen from 1932 (note 21).

Shut out by the laissez-faire and self-regulating ideol- ogies of the nineteenth century the place is now assured for intellec- tual-political elites to facilitate the aforementioned transformation: one a fascist fantasy, the other a communist one. Thus history is the facilitator of Schmitt's super-political theory and Lukacs's super-social theory, although Schmitt and Lukics understand "history" quite differently. Lukaics views this historical process as authored by humans, but without their knowledge. Schmitt came more and more to abandon Weber's account of rationalization as a spillover of Protestant anxiety and instead attribute it to the conscious choice of elites.59 Recall that Schmitt attributes the development of the "duali- ties" of modernity to the efforts of Copernicus, Descartes, and Kant; Lukaics treats them as subtle reflections of a socioeconomic structure. For Schmitt modernity is the product of conscious decision on the part of elites who sought to free themselves from the sanction of tradi- tional authority. Having rendered themselves superfluous in the self- regulating society of the nineteenth century that they themselves helped construct, they now have the opportunity to intervene - again consciously and decisively - to reassert their role. Lukacs under- stands history as labor coming-to-realize itself as the primary human condition soon to be consummated. But the process of reification that makes all qualitative entities appear as quantitative ones blinds the proletariat to its own proximity to this qualitatively preeminent activ- ity hence necessitating a vanguard party to spark their awareness.60 Nevertheless this difference may account for the greater extent of Schmitt's complicity with National Socialism a decade later than Lukics's with Lenin and then Stalin: Lukacs's task was merely to push the process of class consciousness - no doubt with the indis- pensable help of the Communist party - while Schmitt's was to aid in 59.

It is the differ- ence between awakening a will and generating it oneself.61 Both theorists necessarily promote conflict in their depiction of the cri- sis between the abstract and the concrete and their identification of the respective poles with specific social entities. Schmitt's conflict is nation- ally-culturally centered, Lukics's class-centered; Schmitt's anti-Russia, Lukics's decidedly pro-Russia.62 Therefore besides supplying the meth- odological-political framework that Lukics and Schmitt sought to over- come, Weber also provides the sociocultural agenda that both would use in that attempt at overcoming. Weber, as is well known, suggested that meaning was derived only through conflict, ultimately violent conflict;63 less widely discussed is his fairly serious obsession with Russia.64 Lukics adopts Weber's conflict theory and positively valorizes Weber's intensely ambivalent attitude toward Russia; Schmitt adopts the conflict theory and valorizes the attitude negatively. Many commentators have remarked how both take far too literally Weber's claim that politics involves the choice between "God" and "the devil" ("Science" 148), as well as the likelihood of "contracting with diabolical powers" ("Politics" 123). Unfortunately, few, however, especially in Schmitt's case, have bothered to interrogate how seriously they attempted to escape such ten- dencies before eventually accelerating them in theory and practice.65 To what extent then is Weber culpable in the behavior of his proteges by most clearly setting out the categories that they sought to overcome but only radicalized? Despite the long history of debates over this issue, it is still unclear whether Weber's irrational tehdencies can be identified as the source of the persistence of myth, explicit and implicit, in his stu- dents thought. As early as Political Romanticism, Schmitt reveals his proclivity toward myth by his exclusion of it from the structure of the dualisms he elucidates. Myth according to Schmitt, is not an example of 61.

That is because the creation of a political or historical myth arises from political activity, and the fabric of reasons, which myth cannot forego either, is the emanation of politi- cal energy. A myth arises only in the real war" (PR 160).66 Moreover even the most sympathetic commentators note the latent attraction to mythology that remained in Lukics's thought even after his turn to Hegelianism.67 Lukics's fascination with the "miracle," the "accident," the "marvel," that disrupts the order of every day life as far back as Soul and Form (e.g. 71, 153) was not sufficiently purged from his the- ory, as his exposition of "crisis" and the proletariat illustrates. All in all it would seem as though the activity of Don Quixote, so important to both of their early accounts of modernity, while haplessly tragic within a Kantian-weberian framework in which the objective world could not be changed by a subjective stance is rendered potentially radically destructive in the new paradigms of the authors, when it appears that such a change is in fact possible. Schmitt and Lukics, for their part, were not themselves willing to absolve their teacher of responsibility for generating the modem irratio- nality that they themselves would put into practice. Long after his Weimar career, his subsequent affiliation with National Socialism, and toward the end of his lifelong banishment from the academy in the Fed- eral Republic of Germany, Schmitt would offer a critique of the irratio- nalism that, according to him, necessarily erupts within Weber's rationalization thesis: The purely subjective freedom of value-determination leads ... to an eternal struggle of values and world-views, to a war of all against all, an eternal bellum omnium contra omnes which is truly idyllic in comparison with the old bellum omnium contra omnes and even the lethal state of nature of Thomas Hobbes's state theory. The old gods rise from their graves and fight their old battles once again, but now disenchanted and now, as should be added, with new means of strug- gle which are no longer mere weapons but terrifying means of anni- hilation and extermination - dreadful products of value-free science and the industrialism and technology that it serves. What is for one 66. On Schmitt's use of myth, see the last chapter of Parlamentarismus, as well as McCormick, "Dangers of Mythologyzing Technology and Politics." 67. Cf.

That the old gods have become disenchanted and become merely accepted values makes the conflict specter-like and the antagonists hopelessly polemical. This is the nightmare Max Weber's depiction presents to us.68 After World War II Lukics, remaining behind the Iron Curtain, would also criticize his former mentor, who, in struggling against irrational- ism, only "provided a bridge to a higher stage of it:" Max Weber banished irrationalism from his methodology and analysis of isolated facts only in order to introduce it as the philosophical basis of his worldview with a firmness hitherto unknown in Germany. Granted, even this elimination of irrationalism from the methodology was not total. Just as Weber relativized everything in sociology into rational types, so likewise his type of non-hereditary leader who attains office as a result of "charisma" was purely irrationalistic. That aside, however, imperialist neo-Kantianism really crossed the bridge into irra- tionalist existentialism for the first time in [the "Vocation" lectures].69 Schmitt and Lukaics had indeed effectively shown how Weber's stand of "ethical responsibility" was untenable in the face of his own rational- ization thesis. It is still an open question whether this gives them license to tacitly attribute to the "sins of the father" their own contributions to the "nightmare" of "irrationalist existentialism" that was twentieth-cen- tury totalitarianism, and thereby effectively forsake their own "responsi- bility" for such contributions. Conclusion I have examined the efforts of two engaged intellectuals coming to terms with the methodological-political framework of weberian social science in the midst of a radical transition in the relationship of state and society in early twentieth century central Europe. In the present sec- ond crisis of the state in this century - this moment of decline in national sovereignty and increased globalization of economic power the tension between the "subjective" and "objective" poles in culture and philosophy is again becoming acute and the need to overcome it urgent. Now reigning in the fields of the human sciences are the all too familiar debates, for instance, in law between formalism and antiformal- 68. "Die Tyrannei der Werte," Der Tyrannei der Werte, eds.

We may also observe in popular and political culture in the United States and abroad an intensifying fundamentalism, in some respects frighteningly reminiscent of Schmitt's fascism: attempts to stake secure positions against the rapidly changing socioeconomic land- scape in the supposedly timeless entities of family, nation, and faith. Another side of popular and political culture seems occupied by projects not unlike that of Lukdcs - a desperate search for the margin- alized concrete, qualitative essence from whose standpoint (of race, gender, ethnicity, etc.) the very real metaphysical aporiai of liberal the- ory and the even more real injustices of liberal-democratic society can be overcome. One of the tasks of social and political studies today, one that would escape the drawbacks of weberian social science, as well as the dangers exhibited by the work of its most radical discontented prac- titioners, should be an attempt to understand the relationship amongst the transformation, the academic debates, and the cultural stands, as well as the persistence of the oppositions, the antinomies, the dualisms explicated above, within them. It would certainly not be to attach one- self aesthetically to any particular aspect of this constellation, placing a rather heavy wager that it will serve as the door to a new conscious- ness. What should be clear after an examination of the efforts of the most brilliant critics of the Weberian world-view is that it is only after the most careful theorization of contemporary contradictions that pro- gressive praxis is really possible. As Hegel has so famously stated in The Phenomenlogy of Mind/Spirit, "To transcend such ossified antithe- ses is the sole concern of reason."70 70.
