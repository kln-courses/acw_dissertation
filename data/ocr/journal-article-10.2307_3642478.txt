<plain_text><page sequence="1">RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN TURKEY BOAZKO6YY1 The excavations of the Bogazkoy Expedition lasted from ist August to 12th November I965. They took place within an area of about 3,000 sq. m. and were concentrated mainly on three tasks, viz. : (I) exposure and interpretation of the post- Hittite stairway, (2) investigation of the Hittite fortifications, and (3) clarification of their connexion with and temporal relation to the so-called postern wall (Poter- nenmauer), i.e. with the defensive wall of the ancient Hittite city-area. The post-Hittite stairway came to light in a surprisingly good state of preser- vation, so that its original lay-out could be reconstructed without difficulty. This is a narrow path, at least 45 m. in length, enclosed between ashlar walls of about a man's height, leading by way of 13 steps at its upper end and a further 23 below, with a remarkably winding course, from the citadel gate (i.e. outside the defences) down to a well, constructed similarly of ashlar masonry at the foot of the slope. This well possessed at the level of the lowest step and hardly I"5 m. above the bottom of the well, a platform of wooden planks, recognizable by the ends of the planks and the beams on which they rested, an arrangement which prevented pollution of the water from outside and also provided those drawing water with the necessary space for their work and for the disposal of their vessels. An overflow in the form of a stone channel ensured that superfluous rain-water might drain away without causing damage. Undoubtedly this arrangement was intended for the supply of water, especially in times of emergency, to the thickly populated citadel- hill in the Phrygian period. Evidence of this may be seen in the massive tower erected outside the stairway at its lower end, and in the two niches for sentries above the inner face of the well-path. The path and the well alike were built by skilful utilization of the remains of previous Hittite structures-hence the winding course-and involved the abandonment of an ancient paved ascent. On the basis of a few finds in situ-four jugs or their fragments found in the mud at the bottom of the well, arrow-heads on the paving of the earlier road-and the observed stratification, the whole construction can be dated to a late phase of the Phrygian period of occupation of Btiytikkale, BK Ia. It is due to these circumstances that on the western slope of Buyiikkale a more significant proportion of the Hittite fortification was sufficiently preserved to allow the course of the walls and their function to be recognized. Unfortunately, however, the most interesting point of this section of the fortifications, namely a second gate- way leading into the Hittite royal citadel from the west, was destroyed at its crucial point by the deep well. None the less, sufficient remains survived, in the form of a threshold block, clearly marked as such by the ruts of chariot wheels, though in secondary position, and still upright door-jamb, to enable us to localize this second, more modest, gateway exactly at the point of the later well. From this gate a 3- metre wide chariot way protected by the 5-metre citadel wall and, on the upper side, by a mighty retaining wall crowned with orthostats led up into the interior of the citadel. Presumably its purpose was, apart from strategic considerations, to provide a private link between the royal palace and the great Temple, the national shrine in the lower city. Deep soundings in the region of the postern wall (bb-ee/20-24) have yielded decisive information about the temporal relationship of the fortifications of the citadel and the town respectively. The pointers to dating obtained in previous years can now be confirmed, in the sense that the construction of the citadel wall together with the two gates is to be dated principally to the period of the later Empire (after 1280 B.C.). The western range of the fortifications was at this time newly laid out, while the southern was constructed upon the foundations of the city 1 Translated from a report kindly provided by Herr P. Neve through Professor Bittel.</page><page sequence="2">26 ANATOLIAN STUDIES wall, which in this section at least had been abandoned. The city wall, with the so- called Lower Gate, arose in two building periods, distinguished by different ground levels with their respective settlements, the older of which belongs at the earliest, to judge from small finds, to the end of period IVc, but more probably to an early phase of Level IVb, i.e. the very beginning of the Empire. This important conclu- sion still leaves the question of the extent of the older Hittite city area and the loca- tion of any fortification it might have had unanswered. It is, however, certain-and this has been further proved by test excavations on the south-west plateau of the citadel hill-that the Old Hittite (karum-period) city occupied a more limited area and possessed its own defensive wall about 40 to 60o m. inside the later postern wall. KULTEPE-KANI$ 1 During the 1965 season work was carried out both at the Karum and on the h6ytik proper. The Karum excavation was developed along two lines: (a) In the central part of the city, which we know to have been the most densely populated of the I b period, i.e. on squares aa-ee/2o-24 of the plan, a district with all its foundations and in an excellent state of preservation, was found and all finds were left in place. We see that this district, consisting of small many-roomed houses, was planned along stone-paved streets, wide enough for a cart. The houses had been burnt, household goods left where they lay and most of the graves plundered, perhaps by the I a people. In this level, in the seventeenth year of excavation, yet another type of storage-jar was found, together with objets d'art of North Syrian origin. Important though the cuneiform tablets of level I b may be from the point of view of early Anatolian history, this level is just as important from the point of view of attempts to establish links with North Syria. Its documents, town plan and the condition of the small objects indicate that the I b level extends, in estimated date, back to the lower ones, and that the lacuna between it and the Labarna period was very short. In the quarter where the workshops were situated a work- place specializing in moulds for earthenware and metal objects was found. With the aid of this it has become possible to understand a considerable number of objects, the true nature of which was not formerly known. This year, in this level and in almost every house, a stamp-seal was found, also a very limited quantity of cylinder-seals. (b) This year building levels III and IV were rechecked in this part of the city, also the transition from III to II. The shape of the foundation of level IV on virgin soil and the measurement of its outline in relation to the h6ytik, already established as roughly parallel, were objects of special attention. In these two levels, representing the last period in central Anatolia prior to the introduction of writing, proto-Hittite pottery, a large quantity of vases with painted decoration and sherds of foreign origin were found. On the mound work proceeded on the great palace, contemporary with level II at the Karum, and on levels representing various phases of the Early Bronze Age. These excavations were very productive both from the aspect of the history of architecture and from the point of view of small objects. Kuiltepe continues to be the source of the most beautiful and plentiful objects of these periods in the Ankara and Kayseri Archaeological Museums. ALTINVTEPE ' In the excavation conducted at Altlntepe in 1965 investigations of the annexes at the front of the Apadana and of the inner part of the tripartite city wall were carried out, and a number of monumental relics of Urartian architecture were brought to light. The great courtyard in front of the Apadana was built on the debris of earlier buildings, contemporary with the temple. This shows either that there 1 Translated from a report kindly supplied by Professor Dr. Tahsin Ozgiiu.</page><page sequence="3">RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN TURKEY 27 are very important buildings underneath the Apadana, or that they were demolished in the course of its erection. In the next few years we shall try both to work on this matter, leaving the Apadana in place, and to maintain and restore both the Urartian cities on this " double-decker " site. It was established that to the north-east of the temple there were temple depots, demolished to make way for the later level buildings. The food-storage jars found here are identical with those found four years ago in the castle depot. These new discoveries show that the Altintepe temple belongs to the type of temple- palace found at Ere-buni. Altintepe, with its three tombs, Apadana, temple-palace, depot buildings and encircling walls, is an open-air museum open to the public. ACEMHO YUK 1 The excavations at AcemhbyUk carried out under the auspices of the Direc- torate-General of Antiquities and Museums and the University of Ankara were continued in August and September, 1965. This year Mahmut Akok (architect- archaeologist) Dr. Kutlu Emre and Onder Bilge (archaeologists) Selahattin Oztartan (photographer), Cengiz Erol (technical artist), Mehmet Ciyez (restorer) and two archaeology students, Giirkan Toklu and Erdo'an Engin were added to the staff. The trenches at Sarikaya and in the centre, where work has been going on for three years, were extensively dug. Excavations were also begun on the outskirts with the object of determining the extent of the city. In 1964 the excavation of Sarikaya, the citadel, revealed the brick-floored room of a large building and three rooms used by the people of level II. This year it was possible to expose a further portion of the building, which extends towards the centre of the h6ytik and was severely damaged by fire. This building is in level II of the Sarikaya but actually belongs to level III of the h6ytik. Its mud-brick walls based on foundations of large stones, could only be cleaned after the removal of the debris of burnt roof-pillars and wall beams. In parts the mud-brick walls have been preserved to a height of 2 - m. These high, thick walls and the dense conflagration debris have preserved the elevation of Sarikaya. After the blaze it was abandoned and not chosen again for a place of habitation for centuries. In the Hellenistic period a small house was built on the building debris. Wattle was used in the walls of this building, though not as closely woven as that in the level II buildings at Kanis Karum. Pieces of plates, earthenware and thick-sided kiip have been found on the floors of the rooms. The most significant of the smaller articles are some fragments of obsidian vessels which seem to come from three separate vases. One of these was a grooved vase, the second was a crystal-cut vessel, and the third a plain vase. When one realises that the only previous find of this sort has been a fragment of a small obsidian vase at Kiiltepe the importance of these finds is self-evident. A lion figurine of mussel-shell, burnt together with the building, resembles, from the stylistic point of view, the portrayal of animals in level II at Kanis Karum. It must have been part of the mosaic decoration of a box or other article. In one room of the same building a horse-shoe shaped portable oven, a type well-liked at Acemhoyik, was found on a rectangular platform. This form of oven is known to have been in favour in level II at Kanis Karum. Beside the building with the oven three rooms of level II were found. One of these rooms cut the level III street. On the floor of the room, in a portion near the bottom of a fairly high level, a bowl with a wide spout was found. Bowls of this type were located at a fairly high level above the floor in Kanis Karum Ib also, and are believed to have been used in workshops. Also in this level a " kantharos " 1 Translated from a report kindly supplied by Professor Nimet Ozgii.</page><page sequence="4">28 ANATOLIAN STUDIES was found, again in a Kanis Karum Ib form. Also found was a lamp with two spouts, one containing a filter, the first of this type to be encountered here. In the centre of the hb6ytk building levels III and IV were investigated. In a store-room connected with a kitchen in level III food storage jars of various sizes were found at the edge of a rectangular platform. Between the platform and the wall two painted vases, unique for the colonial period, were discovered. The spouts of these two-handled vases begin at the base and are attached to the lip. This sort of spout is a feature preserving the tradition of the shapes of vessels from the last phase of the Early Bronze Age at Alisar, and connects the colonial period with older civilizations. Apart from these there were also found here two-handled cups, grooved and having spiked bases. It was possible to examine a limited area of level IV. The painted and mono- chrome pottery of this level is a continuation of older levels. There was a small quantity of pottery with an inner lining of red and grey, comparable with Alisar III pottery. This corresponds basically with the situation at Kultepe. On the evidence of parallels established through the pottery, this level is contemporary with levels IV and III at Kanis Karum. The item that attracted most attention in level IV was a group of lead figurines portraying a god, a goddess and a girl. We may conjecture that the man and woman are the gods of plenty. The nearest parallel to this work is the group of figurines found at Kiiltepe and now in the Louvre. The Acemhyaik specimen is valuable for dating the other group. Excavation reached the floor of level III at the northern edge of the h6ytuk and showed that the floor level on the outskirts is the same as that on the top of the mound. In the light of the investigations to date it has been shown that, despite the great disasters which wrecked the cities, a basic continuity of local tradition in both form and technique was maintained. ADILCE VAZ, 1965 The excavation at Adilcevaz, begun in 1964 by Prof. Emin Bilgig and Dr. B. Ogin, was continued in 1965. (The 1964 results were published briefly in AS XV, pp. 27-29, and in greater detail in Anatolia VIII, under the title of " Kef Kalesi of Adilcevaz, 1964 ".) On this occasion, too, the excavation was conducted by Prof. Bilgig and Dr. Ogtn, on behalf of the Van and District Excavations Commission, which was established in 1959 for the purpose of excavation and research in E. Anatolia by staff of the Universities of Ankara and Istanbul. The excavation, which was made possible by the support of the Directorate General of Antiquities and Museums, the Rectorate of Atattfrk University, Erzurum and, in part, the Faculty of Arts of the University of Ankara, continued from the end of June until the middle of August. In the previous year two trenches had been dug on the upper part of the southern slope of Kef Kalesi htiyatk, 6 km. north of Adilcevaz. Trench A, which, on the basis of the first finds, had been enlarged to 10 X 20 m., was extended to the north, east and west, while trench B, 25 m. to the north and measuring 20o X 30 m., was extended on all four sides. The two shafts were thus joined. Trench B became a wide, flat-bottomed hole approximately 30 m. square, and trench A a terraced hole 25 m. square. The trenches were separated by a wall some 2-50 m. in thickness, on the north side of trench A and the south side of trench B. As the trench A side of the wall is terraced and very low, all the plaster had been exposed. The northern side, because of its comparative height, has not yet been cleared sufficiently to show the plaster. 1 Translated from information kindly supplied by Professor Emin Bilgig.</page><page sequence="5">RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN TURKEY 29 In 1964 two rooms, numbered I and 2, were excavated on the south and north sides respectively of trench A. This year a start was made on the excavation of Room 3, to the north of Room 2. In addition to the two carved blocks discovered on the east side and in the middle of Room i, a third was found on the west side. In Room 3, which is 2-40 m. in width, a fourth block was discovered in the middle and a fifth on the south side. If the block (Burney, AS VIII, p.217, Fig. 3 and Plate XXXIVa), which caused us to begin the excavation, be included, the number of such blocks rises to six. This year we obtained confirmation of the conjecture put forward on p. 28 of AS XV, that the blocks had the same relief on four sides. The reliefs show a fortified building with crenellations on its roof, and the windows of two storeys. Above the crenellations are two pairs of eagles, heraldically disposed about a central ornament. In front of the building are two gods, standing on lions and facing one another, with panels showing spears between and behind them. (See the account in Anatolia VIII, Fig. 2.) On the upper side of each block is a single line of cuneiform, running round all four sides, which reveals that this depot was established by Rusa II. (This inscription, together with the writing on some pithoi discovered, is being prepared for publication in Anatolia IX by Prof. Bilgi?.) In both trenches, various indications of the destruction of the site by fire have come to light. In trench A the southern walls of Rooms I and 2 lean appreciably to the south and are reddened and in places blackened as a result of this fire. The western wall of Room 2 was found, and an entrance discovered in the western wall of Room 3. A passage some 2 m. wide and about 2 m. from the western end was found in the dividing wall of Rooms I and 2, by which they seem to have been connected. It has not yet been possible to reach the west wall of Room I, but it has been observed that this narrow room and the row of pithoi inside it continue underground to the west as to the east. In 1964 two rows of five pithoi each were discovered in this room, and this year two rows of 21 each were found. The excavated length of this room is 25 m. Room 2, of which the west wall has been reached, and which has been exca- vated for more than 20 m. eastwards, contains a triple row of pithoi beginning 5 m. from the western wall. This year 33 of these were discovered. It is believed that at the bottom of Room 3, too, there is a double row of pithoi, but it has not been possible to dig down to their level. On many of them the contents are indicated in cuneiform. Last year four buttressed bases, measuring approximately 3-5 X 2'5 m., were discovered in a single row running east to west in trench B. This year, four more identical ones were discovered in a parallel row to the south. These bases, which are of cut stone and, as we pointed out previously, similar to those found at Karmir- Blur, must have supported an upper storey or terrace. To the south of these, three contiguous rooms, probably servants' quarters, with an entrance of smooth stone to the north-west have been found. To the west side of the area a wall, made of fairly smooth stone and mud-brick and some 23 m. long, has been partially exca- vated. On these indications, the palace itself is believed to lie on the west and north- west sides of the trenches. GEDIKLI (KARAHUTUK) 1 Excavations in the district of Isl~hiye in the Province of Gaziantep in southeast Turkey were continued on behalf of the Turkish Historical Society, of the Turkish Directorate-General of Antiquities and Museums and of the University of Istanbul. under the direction of Professor and Mrs. U. Bahadir Alklm. The work in 1965 was concentrated at Gedikli (Karahtlytilk) and had the follow- ing objectives: excavations on the eastern side and at the southeastern foot of the Huyiik. 1 Information kindly supplied by Professor U. Bahadir Alkim.</page><page sequence="6">30 ANATOLIAN STUDIES I. On the eastern side in two parts work was carried on: in the step-trench (=Sondage A) and in the pit adjacent and parallel to it (Sondage A1). (a) In the step-trench (=Sondage A) which yielded last year four cultural levels (Iron Age = Level I, a settlement of the 2nd millennium B.C. = Level II, Early Bronze Age with its six sublevels = Level III, and Chalcolithic [?] = Level IV), the present water level of the Plain of Sakgag6zti was reached at a depth of 21 m. from the summit of the Hyiiiik. This season excavations were continued down for a further 4 m. No traces of architectural remains were met, but many sherds of a burnished orange-brittle ware with geometric decorations were brought to light between the 21st and 25th metres. It appears from this fact that this type of ware, which seems to be a product of a regional culture (cf. Belleten XXX [1966], PP. 53-54), continued in a traditional manner to give samples from the late Chal- colithic Age on and was in use with slight variations throughout almost the whole period of the Early Bronze Age in this area (circa 3000-2000 B.C.). The fact that last year sherds of local Obeid pottery were found in the I Ith step (= IlIf), where fragments of this orange-brittle ceramic were also brought to light, supports this suggestion. It also appears that the home of this burnished orange-brittle ware, a few examples of which had been met in Amuq and in Tarsus (Cilicia), was the Gaziantep, Kilis and IslAhiye area. (b) Sondage A1 : In this pit, in which during the 1964 season two sublevels of Early Bronze Age (IIIa and IIIb) had been established, four more phases of the same period (IIIc, IIId, IIIe and IIIf) were dug. In all these sublevels the dominant pottery type was again the same reddish- orange coloured burnished ware occasionally with linear incised geometric orna- mentation. The discovery of a few fragments of local Obeid type pottery in IIId, the clearing of two intramural simple inhumations in IIIe and the finding of a bronze dagger (in pieces) with its handle made of bone in IIIf are worth mentioning among the finds of this Sondage A,. The floor of Sublevel IIIf is 19 m. deep from the summit of the hill. It is most likely that this phase belongs to Early Bronze I. During the coming seasons it is planned to dig deeper in this pit and try to elucidate the earlier sublevels or levels down to the virgin soil. II. At the southeastern foot (=Sondage C) : In this area, where a necropolis was discovered in I964, work was continued and further simple inhumations, rectangular cist-graves and cremation burials were brought to light. (I) Two simple inhumations were found on the upper level of the cremation sector of the necropolis. It is most likely that these belong to the same period (i.e. to the middle of the second millennium B.C.) as those which had been cleared in the past season (1964) in the southern part of the area. (2) Chamber-tombs -- cist-graves: During tile last season three tombs of this type (M1, M2, and M ) were cleared. In 1965 two more were discovered (M4, M5). (a) M4 - The tomb with dromos: It is orientated west-east. The length of the dromos amounts to 7 m. while its width is 080-100ioo m.; its walls are built of rough-stones and the roof is covered with large limestone monoliths showing a megalithic aspect; the small holes between the monoliths are covered with small stones. The dromos of the tomb opens to a rectangular subterranean chamber (length 3 m., width I"5 m. height I-50 m.) which lies about 7 m. below the level of the opening of the dromos. Thus as the inclination is considerable, originally there must have been steps leading from the opening to the tomb chamber. In the chamber nothing could be found but remains of reddish-orange brittle ware, this being the same traditional pottery of Early Bronze Age at Gedikli. The fact that nothing but ceramic fragments were encountered in the tomb chamber constitutes evidence that this grave had already been opened and robbed in ancient times.</page><page sequence="7">RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN TURKEY 31 Just below the floor of the tomb chamber the present water level was met. Below the water level excavations were carried out to a depth of o08o m., but there were no finds except a piece of wooden tie-beam which apparently was put horizon- tally and served for the strengthening of the stone-courses. This tomb with dromos belongs most probably to the same period as M1, M2, Ms, i.e. to the 24th-23rd centuries B.C. (b) M5 = Cist grave : This was cleared in the eastern end of the pit and shows again the same style of stone workmanship, and although it is smaller in size has again a megalithic aspect. As it was intact the following burial gifts were found in it: 15 complete pots (fruitstands, cups, bowls, juglets etc.) and two stone axes. The type and profile of the pottery do not differ from the traditional reddish-orange burnished ware of Early Bronze Age at Gedikli. As in the grave the remains offive skulls, and bones in greater amount were encountered, it seems that it was an anonymous tomb or was used for different burials. (c) The tomb of a sacred animal : This was uncovered in the area between MK and M, on the eastern edge of the " Trench C. " In this same sector there was also found in 1964 a grave of another animal. The head of the animal skeleton cleared in 1965 was orientated to west, it was placed into the pit in an arched position. As burial gifts there were brought to light four buff cups. This unusual burial leads one to wonder: could this have possibly been some sort of sacrifice ? Or was it actually rather the burial of some sacred animal, that is an animal sacred to some deity ? Because the skeleton had come to light complete, the latter alternative can be considered to be more probable. (3) Cremation burials in earthen pots: In I964 forty-three burials of this sort were discovered; 35 more were uncovered during the 1965 season. The multiplicity of burials one above the other had resulted in the crushing of the ossuary-vessels lower down: there had come into being here a virtual stratum of ash, bone and pottery fragments mixed together. Although the original number of these cremation graves must most probably have been at least a few hundred, only 78 could actually be counted in 1964 and 1965 as individual graves. The quasi-spherical cinerary-vessels found in 1964 were all black in colour and were ordinary wares. But some of the cremation-pots brought to light in 1965 were made of reddish-orange brittle ware (i.e. of the traditional pottery of Gedikli throughout the Early Bronze Age) and were encountered down to the present water level of the plain of Sakgag6zi!. It is most remarkable that some of the pots found in 1965, which had been used as liquid-holding vessels for the extinguishing of the pyre, were made of the same traditional reddish-orange burnished ware with linear incisions, which were found in the cist-graves M1, M2, M3, M4 and M5 dated to the 25th-24th century B.C. Thus the discovery of the same ceramic art both in some of the cremation burials in a deeper level and in the cist-graves at Gedikli leads one to the opinion that a part of the cremation-graves at least must have been contemporary with the cist-graves, and consequently some of the cremation-tombs belong to an earlier period. From this fact it appears that the cremation cemetery at Gedikli could have been used for several centuries. It is also to be noted that in the cremation pots were found small buff cups decorated over the entire outer surface with parallel little groves (= corrugation), a bronze toggle-pin in each of the cinerary-vessel, and that about ten depas amphiky- pellon fragments were found in the cremation area. The occurrence of small slender goblets with two handles in the so-called depas amphikypellon shape in great quantity is most remarkable. It seems that the cremation cemetery at Gedikli was in use at least between the 24th and 20th centuries B.c. Thus Gedikli has yielded the earliest cremation burials in the real sense of the term in Syria and also in Anatolia in the Early Bronze Age.</page><page sequence="8">32 ANATOLIAN STUDIES SUBERDE 1 A second and final season of excavation of the early neolithic site of Suberde in southwestern Turkey was completed in September 1965, under the direction of Dr. J. Bordaz of the Department of Sociology and Anthropology, New York University, with the assistance of eight students from Columbia and New York Universities. The site showed three distinct strata-a disturbed surface layer and two underlying prehistoric layers. The surface layer was grey loam, I-25 m. thick, and contained a large number of late burials. The majority of the finds in this disturbed layer consisted of sherds, apparently ranging from the 8th century B.c. to Islamic times. The layer also contained a number of prehistoric artifacts, which had been displaced upwards from the underlying prehistoric layer by the burials. The second layer, the upper prehistoric layer, was red-brown loam, -75 m. thick. It contained poorly preserved remains of prehistoric houses with plaster floors and mud-brick walls. Underlying this plaster floor layer was the third stratum, the lower prehistoric layer. It consisted of light brown loam that, in some places, was more than two metres thick. Hearths, lenses of ash and charcoal, and hard-burned loam were found throughout this lower layer. The first available radiocarbon date for the lower part of this layer is 6570 ? 140 B.C., (1-1867). A few remains of structures with unplastered walls, floors and benches were found in the uppermost part of the light brown loam. In addition, circular bins, or basins, lined with clay were found. They had been fired in situ and measured 8o cm. in diameter and 40 cm. in depth. Almost three-quarters of the chipped stone industry collected at Suberde in 1964 and 1965 has already been sorted. Predominantly of obsidian (ca. 90o%), it includes 2,500 tools, 230 cores and recognizable core fragments, 3,2oo00 blades and flakes with use retouch, and 24,000 waste pieces. The most important categories of tools are the following; approximately 445 unifacially pressure flaked points of 15 different classes, 282 circular scrapers of various forms, 154 end scrapers, 54 side scrapers, 271 sickle blades, 150 piercing tools of various types, Ioo backed blades, ioo notched pieces, 53 reamers and fragments of reamers, 76 blades with alternate retouch, and 45 micro-tools (bladelets less than 2-5 cm. in length). Polished stone artifacts include 63 small celts and other polished stone tools which seem to be associated with the plaster floor layer. Numerous stone beads and pendants were also found. More than 400 fragments of grinding stones of various types were collected from the prehistoric layers. An extremely fine bone industry, which included 40 piercing tools of various kinds was excavated. No ceramic vessels or sherds were found in the prehistoric layers. The coarse paste sherds reported to be part of large movable jars in the 1964 preliminary report on Suberde were actually shown, in 1965, to be fragments of the lining of the basins referred to above. However, other ceramic items did occur in these layers in the form of animal figurines, cones 2 to 3 cm. high, and a few anthropomorphic figurines. A piece of copper wire as well as what might be copper ore were found in the prehistoric layers. These are now being studied by Dr. Ufuk Esin of the University of Istanbul. On the basis of surveys and excavations at Hacilar and at qatal Huiytik, Mr. J. Mellaart, has suggested that two neolithic periods ought to be distinguished in Anatolia: an Early Neolithic, illustrated by levels II to X at 9atal Hiiytik East (5700-6500 B.c.), and a Late Neolithic period, represented by levels VI to IX at Hacilar (5600-5700 B.c.). Highly burnished pottery was very common at natal Huiyk in levels II to VIa, and well made painted pottery was found in abundance at Hacilar (VI-IX). The absence of pottery in the upper prehistoric layer at Suberde 1 Report kindly provided by Dr. Jacques Bordaz.</page><page sequence="9">RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN TURKEY 33 would suggest that it is certainly earlier than 9atal Hitiyak VIa, which has been dated to 5900 B.C., and probably even earlier than levels VIb-X (5900-6500 B.C.), where pottery sherds were found in small quantity. It might tentatively be proposed that the Suberdian plaster floor layer is contemporaneous with the aceramic levels at Hacilar. These were tentatively equated by J. Mellaart with the levels below Level X at gatal Haiyik. As yet there is no evidence at Hacilar or Qatal Htiytik for levels similar to the thick Suberdian lower prehistoric layer without pottery and plastered floors. A detailed comparison of the Suberde material with the earliest Hacilar and gatal Htiytik material should soon provide more data on the exact relationships between these three sites. A very large quantity of animal bones (approximately 25,ooo specimens) was collected in the prehistoric layers of Suberde. The collection includes numerous examples of hunted animals, such as red deer, roe deer, gazelle, and fallow deer, as well as potentially domesticable animals such as sheep, goat, pig, and cattle. The results of a preliminary study made by Dr. Dexter Perkins, Jr., the expedition's zoologist, seem to indicate that the prehistoric layers, which yielded the major part of the collection, did not contain any bones of domesticated animals. The large size of the Suberde faunal collection will make it possible to obtain valuable data on the use of animals in this prehistoric settlement, without fear of chance distortion. Furthermore, it is believed that this faunal collection will be, because of its age, size and variety, an indispensable collection for identification and comparative studies in future zoological work in the Near East. The excavation did not yield any clearly recognizable carbonized seeds. All of the ash found in the prehistoric layers was carefully examined and was found to contain only a small number of isolated specimens, which may still provide some botanical information pertaining to the problem of plant domestication. In addition, a large amount of hard-burned loam was collected for possible botanical impressions. Dr. Burhan Aytug, Laboratory of Palynology, University of Istanbul, has agreed to examine the hard-burned loam fragments as well as soil samples for pollen. A number of soil samples for pedological analysis, radiocarbon samples, plaster floor samples, and mineral samples have also been collected and are being analysed. Since no botanical or zoological collections seem to have been made in that part of Turkey, a collection of 50 plants representing the modern flora of the site has been sent to Dr. P. H. Davis, Department of Botany, Royal Botanic Gardens, Edinburgh, Scotland, for a Flora of Turkey, now in preparation. In addition, about 65 reptiles and amphibians from the vicinity of Suberde were brought to Mr. Charles M. Bogert, Curator of Herpetology at the American Museum of Natural History, New York. Parts of the skeletons of modern domesticated and wild animals (goat, pig) were also collected to be used as comparative material. The preliminary results of a surface survey of 40 sites made by the author in 1945, and of the surveys made previously by Mr. J. Mellaart, Institute of Archaeo- logy, and Professor Ralph S. Solecki, Columbia University, indicate the presence of neolithic settlements with pottery, chalcolithic, and other prehistoric sites, which are later than Suberde. Plans are being made for the study of a number of repre- sentative sites from this area. Taking Suberde as a base line, the study should lead to an understanding of the sequence of prehistoric cultural developments on a regional scale and provide comparative data for similar studies in other areas of Southwestern Asia. DID TYMA 1 In the year I965 the German Archaeological Institute carried out a mere sondage under the direction of K. Tuchelt in the axis of the great temple, outside and to the west of the modern enclosure-wall.

In the axis of the temple there ran a broad conduit covered with stone slabs obviously belonging to the Hellenistic temple, and built into its walls was a fluted torus fragment apparently belonging to the pre-Persian temple. Among other finds were a well-preserved clay model for the cheek-flap of a helmet with the representation of the monster Scylla, of Hellenistic date, and a fragment of a small votive relief with the Apollo Philesios. MYRELAION (ISTANBUL) 1 From October to December 1965 the German Archaeological Institute, in collaboration with the Istanbul Museum carried out under the direction of R. Naumann excavations at the Myrelaion in Istanbul. The excavations were limited to the rotunda found by Talbot Rice and Makridy in 1931 with its built-in cistern2 and were located on its northern, southern and eastern sides. This building, con- structed of great ashlar blocks, still stands for the most part up to a height of 3 m. and above this plinth there seem to have risen rubble walls interspersed with five courses of bricks. The average outer diameter of this building is 4 1 6o0 m., the inner diameter, and therefore the diameter of the dome, was 29'30 m. Inside, the building had four round niches and two rectangular ones, on the eastern and western sides On the northern side was the main entrance, the marble reveals of which are still in situ. In front of this was found the stylobate of a colonnaded hall with bases and the remains of a mosaic showing an arched portico. A second door was located on the south side and led to further rooms, of which, however, only a few walls, a column, and a threshold were found. On the basis of the manner of construction and a few architectural fragments which were found in situ, the rotunda can be dated to the second half of the fifth century. Clearly it formed the main room (" emphasized " triclinium) of a large palace. The outline, with two columns in each of the niches, resembles that of the Pantheon at Rome. Inside this rotunda there was later built a cistern, from the shape of which K. Wulzinger was able in 1925 to deduce the outline of a palace erected above it.3 This hypothesis was confirmed by the excavations, for on the stumps of the walls of the rotunda were found the foundation walls of a building of the tenth century, which obviously belonged to the palace erected by Romanus Lacapenus and the later convent of Myrelaion. Part of this palace is formed by the two-storey Myrelaion Church (Bodrum Camii) with its Macedonian plan. SARA QHANE (IS TANBUL) 4 Remains of the church of St. Polyeuktos, built by Anicia Juliana probably in A.D. 524-7, were recognized in I96O : grading operations at Sara&lt;hane had brought to light several large blocks of architectural carving, two carrying part of a long inscription known from the Palatine Anthology (I, io) to have been in this church (cf. DOP. XV, 1961, p. 243 f.). The potential archaeological importance of a major building in Constantinople, securely dated to the crucial period immediately before Justinian's great architectural programme, was quickly appreciated, and excava- tions, authorized by the Turkish General Directorate of Antiquities and the muni- cipal authorities of Istanbul, were organized by Dumbarton Oaks and the Istanbul Archaeological Museum. These excavations are under the joint direction of Mr. R. M. Harrison and Dr. N. Firathl, and the present report is a summary of the results 1 Translated from a report kindly contributed by Dr. R.

XIX, 1965, p. 230 f.). The site lies in open ground west of the new Belediye Sarayi, in the South- West quadrant of the Atattirk Bulvari--ehzadebasi Caddesi underpass. Prelimi- nary soundings disclosed 6th-century masonry immediately beneath the surface and indicated that only substructures had survived. Trenches over a wide area have provided the main lines of the plan: the church was a 52-metre square, with additional eastern apse and western narthex; the nave is c. 20 m. wide; the two foundation-walls of the nave-colonnades are each c. 7 m. thick and deep; and at the centre of the building there is a solid elliptical structure, probably for the ambo. These facts suggest that the church carried a central dome, a suggestion corroborated by fragments of a columnar exedra and perhaps by a sentence of the inscription (Anth. Pal. I, Io, 57). At this stage the possibility that St. Polyeuktos may have foreshadowed St. Sophia in design cannot be discounted. A deep and extensive destruction-layer has yielded evidence of the church's decoration: wall-revetment and opus sectile were of polychrome marbles from Numidia, Egypt, Caria, Phrygia and Greece; there are fragments of both wall- and pavement-mosaic and of painted plaster; fragments too of agate and petals of mother- of-pearl; more exotic are three marble columns (diam. c. o040 m., from the cibor- ium?) elaborately inlaid with green and gold glass and amethyst. Architectural members are all of Proconnesian marble and are often richly carved. The quality of the carving is consistently high ; and the variety of unusual motifs is extraordinary, and difficult to reconcile with the conventional picture of Constantinopolitan sculpture of this period, as represented by SS. Sergius and Bacchus and St. Sophia. These architectural members include a pier-capital identical in design and dimen- sions with the capitals of the so-called Pilastri Acritani in the Piazzetta at Venice, which once must have stood in St. Polyeuktos and which therefore lose their place as key-monuments of a Syrian School. The church was still visited annually by the Emperor in the early Ioth century (Book of Ceremonies, ed. Bonn, p. 75-6), but it now appears from archaeological evidence to have been abandoned by the i Ith. The site was used as a quarry for building-stone in early Turkish times, and robber-pits have provided a fine sequence of Iznik, Chinese and local pottery of the late-15th to early-I7th centuries. The pottery-Late Roman, Byzantine, and Islamic-is being studied by Dr. J. W. Hayes. Except for part of a domestic bath-house and a few foundations which can probably be associated with a mosque, structural remains of the Turkish period have been lost in successive levelling during the present century. 5th-century levels beneath the church have been penetrated, revealing walls (of an earlier church ?) on a different alignment. This early alignment corresponds with that of the Aqueduct of Valens, the Column of Marcian, and various important Early Byzantine structures recorded by us in the enormous roadworks-cutting for the underpass, adjacent to the site. Although the 6th-century church of St. Polyeuk- tos was set oblique to it, the earlier alignment was followed in the Turkish period, presumably preserved in the line of the main street, the Mese. Finally, the under- pass-cutting uncovered the massive foundations of the Ibrahim Pasa Hamaml. KARATAS-SEMA TYUK 1 The Bryn Mawr College expedition to Karatas in the Elmah region completed a third season in September-October I965. The site consists of a cemetery and a small mound of the Early Bronze Age. In 1963 and I964, a total of 137 pithos burials had been excavated in a field measuring about 35 by 70 m. The pithoi contain multiple burials and are oriented regularly with their rims to the east. 1 Report kindly contributed by Professor Machteld Mellink.</page><page sequence="12">36 ANATOLIAN STUDIES The tomb gifts consist mainly of pottery, copper or bronze pins, and marble idols. The plan of the Karatas cemetery will serve as a guideline for the interpretation and reconstruction of the lost and disturbed cemeteries of the Yortan and Burdur areas. In 1965, no additional excavation took place in the cemetery, but the skeletal material of the previous two seasons was studied by Dr. J. Lawrence Angel. The skeletons include 132 adults (48 male, 8o female, 4 unknown), 7 adolescents and 20 children. The Karatas skeletons represent a composite population and in this respect resemble the pre-Greek and Trojans. The small mound c. 150 m. to the north of the cemetery contains a rectangular house set in the centre of several enclosures. The house measures Io.75 x 7-20 m. It is built of mudbrick, as is its first, oval, courtyard wall which has interior spurwalls making niches. The courtyard wall was strengthened in several stages, growing to a pise rampart of 3.oo-4'50 m. thickness. Along this, a ramp led up to outer east and west courts. Ramp and courts were bordered on the outside by a retaining wall strengthened with exterior buttresses. Beyond the retaining wall, a rockcut ditch seems to have formed the outer perimeter of the complex, which has an approximate total diameter of 50 m. The initial building period (level I) underwent a repair at the beginning of level II, when the ramp was converted into a glacis. Level II ended in total confla- gration. Level III reconstructed the courtyard wall at a higher level and produced deep strata of wood ash (to I -80 m. depth) which lie on the south slopes. The centre of the mound and the place of origin of these ashes are missing due to erosion. Level IV, the final stage of the complex, saw the building of a thick pis' wall (4-6 m.) around the top of the hill, with a gate to the south. Levels I-IV belong to the Early Bronze Age, corresponding to Troy I and Tarsus E.B. II. The pottery found in Karatas level II has some correspondences with Troy I and Poliochni. The small finds are close to those of Kusura B. Level V is mainly represented in remnants of houses built on the south slope of the mound. The houses are rectangular on stone foundations. The most charac- teristic pottery of this level is a white-on-red painted ware of regional Elmah type. Pitchers, jugs and jars are decorated with chevrons and curvilinear loops on a red polished ground. Another typical decoration technique of the area is the application of relief ornament to large and small jars (quadrupeds, medallions). Nearly all of the pottery is hand-made. Terracotta stamp-seals, stone pendants, clay brush-handles, stone celts, hammers and axes, terracotta beads and spindle whorls are among the small finds. The incised designs of the spindle whorls are particularly neat and geometric in level III. The site came to an end early in the E.B. III period. The latest pottery comes from a well and includes a two-handled goblet of the depas family also known from Troy II and Tarsus E.B. IIIa. The material from this excavation is in the Antalya Museum. The work will be continued in I966. APHRODISIAS, 1964 and 1965 1 The fourth and fifth campaigns of excavations at Aphrodisias yielded important data concerning the history of the city, the antiquity of the site and of the cult of Aphrodite. Some of the most interesting finds were made in and immediately outside of the temple of Aphrodite, whose precise architectural plan, obscured by various Byzantine transformations, and date of construction had always been a matter of conjecture. Continued clearance of the nave of the temple-basilica and trenches revealed the foundations of the cella of the pagan building. The con- jectural plan of the building, based on the corner Ionic capitals presumably left 1 Condensed from a report kindly contributed by Professor Kenan T. Erim.</page><page sequence="13">RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN TURKEY 37 in situ by the Byzantine remodellers, and assumed to have consisted of 8 columns in front and rear and 13 on the sides, seems to be on the whole correct. The interior arrangement of the sanctuary proper, on the other hand, now appears to have been in a late Hellenistic tradition not uncommon in western Anatolia, and encountered, for instance, in the temple of Hekate at Lagina : namely, no opisthodomos, but a pronaos and a deepish cella. A date for the construction is suggested by the sherds found in the foundation trenches of the walls : indeed, most of these belong to late Hellenistic wares, Megarian bowls and other relief wares; but earlier types, local varieties of decorated wares akin to Protocorinthian and Protoattic, as well as Attic, Lydian and other East Greek wares of the sixth and even seventh centuries B.C. are also present. In short, not only the present temple of Aphrodite was probably begun in the late second or first century B.C., and not at the time of Hadrian, but the occupation of its site must go back to at least the seventh century B.C. An attractive small crescent-shaped gold pendant was discovered in 1965 near the north-east corner of the external wall. The rough-tessera-mosaic uncovered in the nave in 1962 and 1963 was further investigated in I964 and appeared to have been cut through in the laying of the pronaos foundations. Its technique seems to lie between pebble and true tesselate mosaics and could suggest an early Hellenistic date. Fragments of an emblema came to light, but proved to be almost impossible to understand. The position of this pavement also raises the problem of the location of the pre-Hellenistic temple that must have existed here and to which the mosaic may have belonged. In 1965 clearing work among the stone packing in front of the pronaos foundations brought to light a wall, or wall foundations, apparently parallel to the direction and the orientation of the mosaic. A sondage dug under the bedding of the same mosaic at a point where it had been lifted in 1964 yielded numerous fragments of gold leaf ornaments, including one or two identifiable floral patterns. A trench excavated in the eastern end of the Byzantine church revealed the presence of a pavement of rough stones beneath the level of the foundations of the bema. The antiquity of the cult of Aphrodite was also supported by the discovery of at least three terra-cotta figurines of the seated goddess type and a protome of the third quarter of the sixth century B.C., immediately behind the apse of the temple- basilica. There again the lower strata brought up an abundance of fifth-sixth and seventh century B.C. sherds, including Corinthian, Lydian wares and two fragments of a Kleinmeister cup. Many flints and small obsidian blades found simultaneously hint at an even earlier occupation, as may some of the pottery. The explanation of this very mixed ceramic and other material within as well as without the temple must be found with the levelling and filling activities of the late Hellenistic builders prior to construction. The northern section of the temenos wall, which was investigated in 1965 by means of several trenches, appears to be poorly preserved. Immediately to the north of its remains, part of a Byzantine house was excavated, including an attractive square peristyle court marked by four Corinthian columns of blue-grey Aphrodisias marble. All four columns found fallen near their bases were re-erected and two of them topped by their capitals. Within the same area, two beguiling pilaster capitals probably once decorating the revetted walls of a large marble- paved courtyard opening off the small peristyle were discovered. Both show in their centre female figures carved almost in the round and framed by outward curving acanthus leaves. One of the figures represents the familiar Aphrodite of Knidos of Praxiteles, while the other is a more sedate, draped lady holding out her right hand. She conceivably could be the Aphrodite of Kos of the same Praxiteles, thus forming a pair of artistically related figural capitals. In the area of the odeion, the excavation of all back chambers supporting the upper cavea was completed in 1964. A long stretch of the south portico of the build- ing behind the stage, or porticus post scaenam, was also cleared. At the opposite ends</page><page sequence="14">38 ANATOLIAN STUDIES of the portico, respectively by the easternmost and westernmost doors leading from the backstage corridor into the portico, two magnificent over-life-size and full portraits and their complete inscribed bases were found. The one, a lady by the name of Claudia Antonia Tatiana, seems to have been a benefactress of the city; her statue was furthermore signed by the sculptor, Alexander, son of Zeno. Her counterpart, a handsome gentleman named Dometeinos Diogenes, a prominent Aphrodisian of the late second century B.C. is wearing one of those interesting priestly head-dresses topped by the bust of Aphrodite and others. In one of the back chambers of the odeion, another portrait, ofJulio-Claudian date, and a fifth century magistrate were discovered. Humorous touches were added by the often unusual Byzantine graffiti found scratched on the stuccoed walls of a recess of the backstage corridor of the odeion. An array of line-drawings, " doodles ", caricatures and cartoons with inscriptions throw an amusing light on the artistic propensities of Aphrodisians. The porticus post scaenam behind the odeion was the scene of major trenches again in 1965. Work here, this year, was unfortunately impeded by seeping under- ground water, the level of which was raised by very heavy winter and spring preci- pitations. The portico appears to have consisted of two rows of columns; the Corinthian colonnade, gradually unearthed since 1963, acted as an interior row, which would explain the use of a wide intercolumniation and the absence of appro- priate stone entablature fragments. The exterior columns, three of which were found in situ, are of the same type as those of the agora of Aphrodisias situated in the nearby poplar groves, that is to say Ionic with their lower drums left unfluted. Along the backwall of the porticus in its western portion, two more statues toppled from their inscribed bases and worthy companions to the Diogenes and Claudia Antonia Tatiana of last year were uncovered. One is an exquisitely worked early fifth century chlamydatus of the type found by Paul Gaudin in I905 in front of the Baths. According to the inscription, the gentleman in question is named Oikoumenios and is praised for his equal familiarity with Greek and Latin. The octagonal base of the second statue proved to bear two inscriptions, the older one of which was probably cut in the second century and was turned against the back- wall. The outward facing, later inscription (probably third century) consisted of elegiac couplets extolling an Alexander Dikaios presumably portrayed in the himation type statue found fallen in front of the base. The inscription also states that it was the " Mother of Phrygia " which sent to the " Mother of Caria " this portrait statue of Alexander Dikaios. The heads of both statues are still missing. They may, we hope, turn up in the unexcavated portion of the southwestern portico. Excavations of the so-called " Bishop's Palace " discovered in 1963 were con- tinued. In 1964 the apsidal hall adjacent to the triconch and the peristyle in front of it, and the remaining portion of the same peristyle were completed. The western part of the Palace was investigated by means of several trenches in 1965. The rooms that eventually came to light here were apparently filled in the later history of the building, i.e., the twelfth century. Their floors consisted of delicately-hued geometric mosaics of the fourth century and an elaborate opus sectile type pavement. These seem to corroborate the idea that the original date for the building must go back to late Roman times, as already suggested by a number of details in the masonry and the content of the peristyle well excavated in I963. Several columns of the peristyle were re-erected with the financial assistance of the Department of Antiquities and Museums. Similar consolidation and restora- tion work was continued in the odeion. In and about the Water-channel area, a number of trenches dug in this north- east sector of the city brought to light portions of Byzantine private dwellings, including part of an earlier and more luxurious structure. The more interesting of the finds made here were an exquisite head of an Athena and a sculptor's bronze finishing tool.</page><page sequence="15">RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN TURKEY 39 Of the two trenches dug along the eastern and northeastern flanks of the hillock referred to as the " acropolis " of Aphrodisias, the most interesting proved to be the one intended to verify the location of the theatre. At first, the accumulation brought nothing of consequence. At a depth of over 5 m., however, large fallen architectural blocks began to appear. Beyond 6 m., the marble slabs of the pros- cenium floor were reached. A small opening due to a missing stone on the pavement led to the discovery of a perfectly preserved and only partially filled tunnel along the length of the stage. The tunnel proved to be a ca. 2 m. wide, barrel-vaulted corridor, running for a length of at least 25 m. and perpendicularly joined by another corridor ca. 15 m. long at the approximate centre of the width of the stage. Investi- gations were naturally limited here by the cramped space and uncertainty concerning the solidity of the tunnel. Eventually, in front of the proscenium wall, the drainage channel and the orchestra wall were hit in a small area freed from large architec- tural fragments fallen from the stage building. There can be little doubt that the theatre of Aphrodisias will prove to be extremely well-preserved and join the list of the great monuments of Asia Minor. The excavation of another imposing Aphrodisias monument, the Baths of Hadrian, whose entrance-court or palaestra was excavated by Paul Gaudin in 1904-5, and later on by the Italian mission in 1937, was begun last summer. Initial efforts, though confronted with the removal of many large tufa blocks fallen from upper walls, focused on the central gallery or presumed caldarium and some of the adjacent underground service corridors and tunnels. The latter are in excellent state of preservation and were shown to lead to a number of almost intact hypocaust chambers. Above ground, the marble pavements, revetments and hot-air circula- tion arrangements of the chambers also proved to be in excellent condition. Many fragments of sculpture and large marble slabs with lettering from monumental inscriptions were discovered in the tunnels and the gallery. Among the sculpture. a handsome male portrait of Claudian or Trajanic date formed a contrasting pair with a lively head of a satyr with puffed cheeks, playing the pipe. It is eventually intended to restore discreetly the Baths and transform them into a sculpture museum for the treasures of Aphrodisias. ARSAMEIA ON THE NTMPHAIOS, 1963-5 1 In 1963, for the first time, we were able to leave the area of the Hierothesion, or sepulchral shrine, erected by the Commagenian ruler Mithradates Kallinikos according to his own inscription " in the environs of Arsameia on the Nymphaios ", and to extend our investigations into the wide valley of the Nymphaios (Kahtagay) at the foot of the two hills, Eski Kale and Yeni Kale, which mark the ancient city area. Yeni Kale is crowned by a splendid Mameluk fortress, while the summit and flank of Eski Kale are occupied by the Hierothesion of Mithradates. Eski Kale.-Our most urgent task was to complete our work in the Hierothesion of Mithradates. In the first place we were able to clarify the line of the Processional Way which led up from the valley to the plateau of Eski Kale. It was found to culminate in a monumental stairway, originally 6.5o m. wide, parts of which were found in situ. On the top of the plateau we succeeded in gaining a clearer idea of the form and superstructure of the sacred buildings, which were only destroyed in the twelfth century A.D. The numerous architectural fragments recovered made possible a reconstruction of the whole complex of buildings, a task which was assigned to Dr. W. Hoepfer. The most important result of these excavations is the recognition that a number of colossal statues were erected on the plateau. Among the fragments found all over 1 Condensed and translated from a report kindly supplied by Dr. F. K. D6rner. The results of the 1953-1956 excavations are published in Arsameia am Nymphaios, Berlin 1963 (Ist. Forsch. Bd 23)-</page><page sequence="16">40 ANATOLIAN STUDIES the plateau and on its southern slope were numerous pieces of drapery varying in size and style, as well as a large piece of a male torso and many fragments of beard, also a hand and several fingers, which showed by their different sizes and treatment of the nails that there must have been at least three statues of three to five times life size, like those which gave such a characteristic appearance to the Hierothesion on the Nemrud Dag. As on the Nemrud Dag, so at Arsameia the row of colossal statues was framed by monumental representations of animals, for among the fragments there is a huge lion's foot, bound with rings like a table-leg, as was a lion at Nemrud Da'. Our first indication of the existence at Arsameia of life-size sculpture in the round had been a female portrait-head found in 1954. Now in 1964 there came to light a male head crowned with a tiara, which may certainly be placed alongside the portrait of Queen Laodike, wife of Mithradates Kallinikos and mother of Antiochos I (as the former piece has been interpreted). The new head consists of the same white limestone and is similarly life-size. It represents a very youthful face with full features in the late classical tradition. A careful investigation will be needed to establish whether this evident portrait represents King Mithradates himself or his son Antiochos I. Our newly gained detailed knowledge of Commagenian architecture has shown that Commagene was linked to the Hellenistic cultural milieu much more closely than had hitherto been surmised. The Nymphaios Valley.-Finds of numerous tesserae and sherds and a cylinder- seal scattered over the slope above the bed of the Nymphaios led us to undertake excavations at the so-called " field of mosaics ". A rather large room, with a mosaic floor in a geometric pattern and piers of a hypocaust alongside, has so far come to light. Its foundations consist of a strong filling of stone laid in whitish chalk cement. Soundings in the surrounding area revealed that the whole complex apparently served for commercial undertakings and comprised several building periods of Hellenistic-Roman date. Much pottery came to light, including many sherds of sigillata. Forging installation by Kilise Tepe.-Already in 1963 large quantities of iron slag had been found immediately south-west of the village of Eski Kahta. Here in 1965 a considerable area was uncovered, and found to comprise five adjacent workshops with furnaces. These furnaces each consisted of a huge base of rubble and rect- angular blocks supporting an oval hearth which in room 4 was 2 1 Io m. long and I -8o- 2.0 m. wide. The floor of flat slabs was enclosed by a raised rim of stone and clay, resulting in an oval tub-shaped hearth. The interior was then lined with clay, which was found in a heavily calcined and crumbly condition. The traces of heat were most marked by the western edge and in the middle of the eastern edge of Room 4. Moreover, on the western side accretions of slag showed that the work had been carried out at very high temperatures. An explanation of this was found when, after removal of the layers of ash, the well-preserved vents of two simultaneously operated bellows were revealed. In Room 5 was found a depot of about 400 various pieces of iron, for the most part thin rectangular iron plates, some curved, with iron and bronze rivets, which, to judge from the shape and the position of the rivets, could well have belonged to a plated cuirass. Chain links, ornaments of bronze, and other attachments were also found. Such potsherds, tools, nails, horse-shoes, attachments and Islamic coins as were found in the layers of ashes were so uniformly medieval that all these buildings and their technical installations must have been erected and operated during that time. Medieval Living Quarters and Industrial Area.-Separated only by a small depression from Kilise Tepe, an extensive area devoted to living quarters and industry was uncovered, immediately below the village of Eski Kahta. Here there existed from</page><page sequence="17">RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN TURKEY 41 the thirteenth century on a wide city-like layout, giving interesting glimpses of the everyday life and work of the Middle Ages. Teni Kale.-The ruins on Yeni Kale, even today, are extremely impressive.' Ever since our first investigations in 1938 it has been our desire to save this splendid building from delapidation, to uncover the layout of the building and make it again accessible. Our attention was further directed to this hill by the monumental rock-inscription discovered on the Eski Kale, which referred to Arsameia as a double city extending over two natural hills and extolled the strength of its fortifications. At last in 1965 it proved possible to begin a thorough investigation of Yeni Kale, consisting of both excavation and certain necessary measures of conservation. The whole of the outer defences of the citadel were exposed and a number of hitherto unknown rooms discovered. Prehistoric dwellings.-During work on the plateau and the south slope of Eski Kale and on Kadi Tepe pottery and stone implements of the Bronze Age had been observed. A trench cut in 1963 in a cave beside the Roman bridge over the Cendere Suyu (Chabinas Flumen) produced at a depth of 1-6o-2 m. rough stone tools of very good flint of the Early Bronze or Copper Age, and at 2-2 -3o m. neolithic objects. Two more prehistoric habitations within the area of Arsameia were located in 1965 by Dr. W. Nowothnig, one on the west slope of Kantasl Tepe and the other on the south-west side of Yeni Kale. SARDIS 2 The Harvard-Cornell-American Schools of Oriental Research expedition carried out their eighth campaign of excavation at Sardis in 1965, with the Corning Museum of Glass also taking part. The work was directed by G. M. A. Hanfmann (Harvard), A. H. Detweiler (Cornell), and D. G. Mitten (Harvard) ; J. W. Yarnell (Cornell) was in charge of restoration activities. More than a half acre has now been excavated in the commercial and indus- trial area of the Lydian city known as " The Lydian Trench." Here an important urban feature of seventh century Sardis was discovered by G. F. Swift, Jr. in the southwestern part of the trench, where a precinct wall of rubble and mud brick preserved up to aI -85 m. height has been traced for some 20 m. along the west and for nearly io m. along the south side. Two sizeable (9-5 by 4'5; 7'5 by 5 n.) rooms appear to have flanked an entrance from the west. The enclosure apparently encompassed the Lydian commercial and industrial bazaar area. Plan and execution fall around the middle of the seventh century. This re-planning of Sardis was necessitated by the violent destruction of the city before the middle of the seventh century, which we attribute to the invasion of the Kimmerians. The heavily burned destruction stratum was investigated in two large areas and confirmation of dating obtained from numerous Greek sherds, including Corinthian Geometric. After the Kimmerian destruction a heavy layer of clay (up to 0-40 m.) was laid down and numerous circular pits dug into it, for some as yet unidentified industrial activity. The area was then rebuilt as a bazaar. A find of unusual interest came from a floor datable around 650 B.c., a bone plaque with a griffin in unmis- takably Scythian animal style. On the eastern bank of the Pactolus (" Pactolus North ") R. and M. Ascher (Cornell) and M. Kunt continued the excavation of the Persian and Lydian resi- dential structures, which are seen to have been units of considerable size and sophistication. This quarter was destroyed by Antiochus III in 215-213 B.C. Discovery of floors which were in use immediately before the destruction has yielded 1 A provisional plan is published in F. K.

For the most part, the excavated levels range from 547 to 213 B.C.; one of the few earlier (pre-547 B.C.) findspots yielded a striking fragment of Late Geometric Eastern Greek deinos (ca. 650 B.C.) showing a hoplite in a ship going through a sea with dolphins. In the Bin Tepe cemetery tunnelling excavation was continued by C. H. Greenewalt, Jr. (University of Pennsylvania) at the great royal mound (BT 63.1) which is probably that of Gyges. It may be recalled that an inner mound is con- cealed within a gigantic outer mound (BASOR I77, February 1965, p. 27; AJA 69, 1965, 168). The limestone masonry crepis of the inner mound was followed northeastward for a total length of 78 m., to a point where for a short stretch its lower course is cut into rock. The wall then stops at a depression in the rock. West of the south axis of the mound the crepis picks up, after an interruption of ca. 5 m., but technical difficulties prevented its exploration. A number of tunnels dug in the central area of the mound failed to locate the grave chamber. In the gymnasium area, excavations were carried on by J. H. Kroll in the area of the presumed aleipterion, just west of the Severan " Marble Court, " which is the entrance court to the main gymnasium building. In the " South Hall ", a flanking unit of the entrance court, A. Ramage was able to define an earlier (fourth century A.D.) mosaic floor and a later (fifth century A.D.) marble floor, as well as a level attesting industrial activity after the destruction of the complex. Intensive investigation within the gigantic synagogue, as well as immediately to the east and north of it, was undertaken by D. G. Mitten and A. R. Shapiro, consulting architect for the proposed restoration. The earliest evidence for use of the site is a Late Hellenistic or Early Roman tile grave found some 5 m. below the floor of the synagogue near the southeast corner of the main hall. Over it lay a small structure with beautifully cut limestone steps. It served in part as footing for the south wall of the synagogue. A very complicated system of substructure walls and vaults erected by the Romans after the earthquake of 17 A.D. was un- covered in several places. Excavation was begun of the southern colonnade of the palaestra which adjoins the long northern wall of the synagogue. A Roman phase is attested by a Corinthian capital with a female head; the colonnade was rebuilt in the fifth century A.D. Fallen columns survive from this phase with Early Byzantine capitals of the highest quality. Past seasons' work indicates that the largest part of the synagogue as preserved belongs to an ambitious rebuilding of ca. A.D. 400 distinguished by extensive use of spoils which may include members of the earlier (ca. A.D. 200) synagogue. A small, Early Archaic marble lion from the foundation of one of the piers of the synagogue is the season's most important sculptural find. Of interest for Early Christian iconography is an Early Byzantine pilgrim flask found in the " House of Bronzes " area. It shows an Evangelist writing the Gospel on one side, and a bearded, winged frontal figure holding a book on the other. Undertaken in cooperation with the Turkish government, the restoration of the Severan " Marble Court " of the gymnasium has made good progress. One of the 8.64 m. high torded columns of the western gate was re-erected completely, another to a large part. Consolidation and restoration of the western wall of the court, to which this monumental arcuated gate is attached, has begun. UNDER W/A TER SURVEY 1 During two months of the summer of 1965, the University Museum of the University of Pennsylvania searched for two shipwrecks believed to be carrying at least partial cargoes of art works. One of the wrecks is that near Arap Adasi, not 1 Report kindly contributed by Dr. George F. Bass.</page><page sequence="19">RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN TURKEY 43 far from Marmaris, which yielded the well-known bronze Demeter, now in the Izmir Museum, to sponge-dragger Ahmet Erbil's net. The other produced a less- than-life-size bronze Negro youth, netted by Mehmet Imbat, and a bronze figurine of the goddess Fortuna, both of which are now in the new Bodrum Museum; these were found between Myndus Rock and Wreck Rock near Yalikavak. Both wrecks lie in approximately 275 feet of water, far too deep for searching with ordinary diving techniques. A number of pieces of equipment were tried in the search. An underwater television camera was dragged behind a locally hired Bodrum trawler, the Mustafa ; sometimes it was merely held about ten feet above the seabed, with a stabilizing vane attached to prevent its spinning, and sometimes it was floated about ten feet above a kangava, the axle and wheels to which the spongers usually attach their nets for dragging. One television monitor allowed the captain of the Mustafa to follow the seabed, and another enabled members of the staff in the cabin to keep a close watch on the bottom. With the television it was possible to see quite clearly at the necessary depths (a Roman wreck in I8o feet of water was examined), but vision was naturally restricted to a fairly narrow path. A second device, a recent invention, was a Towvane. This is a steel capsule with a 3600 plexiglass window around its top and large rotatable vanes on its sides. The capsule was towed with up to I,ooo feet of nylon line by the Mustafa. The observer sits inside at atmospheric pressure, breathing recirculated air with additions of oxygen; when he wishes to descend, he rotates the two vanes forward and simply planes down through the water. Since the capsule is slightly buoyant and must be held under water by means of the vanes, it will rise to the surface should the man inside become incapacitated for any reason. Tenders on the surface vessel, which is naturally always ahead of the Towvane, keep a careful check of the seabed with a fathometer and warn the man below of any sudden rocks or other dangerous obstacles by means of a telephone. A third searching device was an underwater proton magnetometer, which it was hoped would detect large masses of pottery; this was not, however, tested as fully as the other devices. Although scattered amphoras were seen, neither of the wrecks was located. The sponge draggers know the positions of the wrecks only within about two square miles in each case, and all of our methods were too limited in range to thoroughly search these areas. We did find, however, that the floor of the Mediterranean in both areas was quite flat, making them ideal places to test side-looking sonar which can scan greater distances quickly and which should point out any suspicious mounds in the future. These mounds may then be inspected with either television or from the submarine Asherah to determine if they are wrecks or only natural formations. SURFACE FINDS FROM VARIOUS SITES Central Anatolia (I) SAPMAZ KoY (YASTOREN)-AKSARAY. A low mound on a natural ridge ca. 22 km. N.W. of Aksaray, ca. I km. S.W. of Sapmaz, to the north-west of the main Ankara-Aksaray road; visited 26th June, 1965. The dimensions of the site are difficult to estimate in view of the natural rise in the ground, but the large quantities of obsidian-to be found mainly on the lower part of the ridge-indicate a sizeable industry. Eighteen complete and fragmentary implements with a high degree of retouch were found, the most complete being illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3. Com- paratively few sherds were found, and the evidence is too fragmentary to allow detailed comment; buff to light brown coarse ware is clearly in evidence, but in the finer wares light to dark grey and a medium brown are the most common colours, with only a few examples of a red burnished ware.

A small quantity of prehistoric and later sherds was found including a painted bowl rim (Fig. 4: 35). As is the case with the two sherds from Totak published by D. H. French (AS XIV, 1964, p. 35, Fig. 1-2) this sherd has affinities with the early Chalcolithic of the Konya Plain, but a later date is also possible. (3) ILICAPINAR-CiHANBEYLi. ca. 12 km.

This would seem to be the source of the implements published by J. Mellaart in Ist. Mitt. VIII, 1958, pp. 82-92, " The neolithic obsidian industry of Illcapinar and its relations ". Obsidian tools and weapons, some bifacially retouched, are to be found mainly on the south and east flanks of this htiyuik, but the area of the main scatter of the obsidian is very limited, and only a few pieces are to be found on the other parts of the Tepe. In such a poor area this Tepe is the natural location for a site of this type-near the lake and raised slightly above the surrounding salt flats, impassable in wet weather, and near the spring. It is also within fairly easy reach of the dry higher ground to the west of the lake. The eastern shore of the lake is very marshy, and is difficult to reach even at the height of summer.

The htiytik marked on the east shore of the lake is not natural, but here again there was nothing to be found on it. I visited the site on I I th June, 1965, and again on 26th October (accompanied by Mr. D. H. French and Miss Elizabeth Dowman) and found 33 complete or fragmentary implements with varying degrees of bifacial retouch (not illustrated because they do not add any new types to the series published by J. Mellaart) and a large quantity of blades and flakes. Once again there were no cores to be found. The interpretation of the site as an obsidian factory, as pointed out by J. Mellaart, is indeed difficult; the survey undertaken by the present writer in the Tuz G1al basin and surrounding areas has not led to the discovery of any sources of obsidian, and it is difficult to conceive any good reason for the establishment of an obsidian working community in such an unattractive area. The salt trade provides the most likely answer, but it is not easy to explain the apparent lack of comparable sites on the east side of the Tuz Go61u where conditions are comparatively favourable for early settlement. The only known neolithic site in this area is that near Sapmaz (see Note I) which is ca. 16 km. from the shore of the lake. To the north, nearer Sereflikoghisar, no evidence of neolithic occupation has yet been found. A small quantity of sherds was also found on the site (Fig. 4: 1-17) ; the finer wares are predominantly reddish-brown burnished, but grey to dark brown wares also occur. From the very limited sample found, here again it would seem that the hole-mouth vessel is uncommon. CATALOGUE OF ILLUSTRATED POTTERY (FIG. 4) All sherds are hand-made. I.

SERiFLi iFTLiK : This site was probably founded on a natural ridge or bank on the floor of a broad, flat valley. It lies ca. 20o km. east of Tekirdav and o km. west of Yenigiftlik ; ca. 400 m. north-east of the Serifli Qiftlik and just to the north of the main road from Tekirda' to Istanbul; ca. 500 m. from the west bank of a stream flowing down the middle of the valley; ca. 750 m. from the sea shore. A road to ?orlu leaves the main road opposite the giftlik and passes by the west side of the site. The probable extent of the site is ca. 2oo m. Prehistoric sherds (Fig. 5 nos. 1-25) from here are probably contemporary with Troy I. 2. DAMNARCA 9E?ME: The site occupies the end of a natural ridge which overlooks, towards the east, a broad valley and a stream. A minor road to 9orlu passes by the foot of the bluff; just across the road there is a large spring. The site is ca. 4'5 km. north of ierifli ?iftlik. Classical and Medieval pottery was found here together with a few prehistoric sherds. 3. TOPTEPE-MARMARAEREGLiSi : The site is situated on a narrow, isolated ridge overlooking the sea shore; ca. I km. south of the main road Istanbul- TekirdaV and ca. 5 km. west of Marmaraereglisi. The site lies at the tip of a slight promontory with shallow bays on either side. The promontory is called Karga- burnu. The ridge runs east to west and is ca. Ioo m. long; on either side there is a small gully. At the head of the eastern gully there is a spring. The pottery (Fig. 5 nos. 26-48 ; 6 nos. I-3 I) is probably of Troy I date but some material (Fig. 6 no. 34) may be later (i.e. Troy II or III-V). Other sherds (Fig. 6 nos. 32-33) are wheel- made and may belong to the Troy VI period or perhaps later. Anatolian Pottery in the Aegean Area I. Cos-SERAGLIO : This site has been known for some time. There have been excavations here and Mycenaean pottery has been mentioned. The sherd (Fig. 7 no. i) is much earlier than the Mycenaean period. In Anatolian terms it is identical, and contemporary, with pottery from Troy III-V, from Beycesultan XII-VI, and from Samos-Heraion III-IV. It is from the collection of the British School of Archaeology at Athens. Other sherds, without a recognizable profile, belong to the red or brown washed and (bone-) burnished pottery type which is characteristic of Troy (III-V), Beycesultan (XII-VI), Samos-Heraion (III-IV), Chios-Emporio, and other West Anatolian sites. 2. EUBOEA-MANIKA: The Anatolian pottery from the prehistoric tombs at Manika, north of Khalkis, has long been known (TTcarrac[othp\Eiou, TTEpi -rCv Ev Ei0oif &amp;PXcaicov -rTaco ['AOijval 910o]) and the relative dating has normally been given as Troy III-V. Despite excavations, no pottery of painted EH III ware or of any other EB 3 type has been published from the settlement at Manika, whereas there is good evidence of EH I-II occupation. A few sherds collected from the settlement site indicate Anatolian connections: plates (Fig. 7 nos. 3-5, in Anatolia found in Troy II-V or Beycesultan XIII-IX) but there are also pieces of beak- spouted jugs. Sherds of bone-burnished, red or red-brown washed pottery are com- mon. Open bowls with two vertical strap handles on the body (Hesperia XXIX (1960) 196 and pl. 70 i, " Two-handled bowls ") in dark burnished ware are also known from Manika. These bowls are typical of late EH III at Lerna (period IV). It should be noted that among the published finds from the EH II stratum at Manika there were no later pottery types, e.g. plates, beak-spouted jugs, two- handled bowls, nor the characteristic painted EH III wares nor the EH III/EB 3 pottery types of Boeotia and Phocis. These are, therefore, sufficient evidence of occupation at this site in a phase later than EH II (characterized by Urfirnis sauce- boats) contemporary with the Papavasiliou tombs, i.e. (Euboean) EB 3, This phase would be contemporary with West Anatolian EB 3, Troy III-V, Beycesultan XII-VI or Samos-Heraion III-IV. An interesting sherd from the settlement site D</page><page sequence="26">50 ANATOLIAN STUDIES is the fragment of a Humpen (Fig. 7 no. 6). This shape can be dated to EB 3 in Phocis or EH III/EB 3 in Boeotia. This sherd, together with the sherds of bowls of Lerna IV type, is therefore further evidence of the EB 3 occupation at Manika. 3. TENOs-AKROTERION OURION: This site has been discussed by Scholes (BSA LI (1956) 13). Grey Minyan and Mycenaean pottery have been found here. The sherd (Fig. 7 no. 2), from the collection of the British School at Athens, is however neither Middle (i.e. the period of Grey Minyan) nor Late Helladic. The nearest parallels are in West Anatolia where bowls of this shape and fabric are known from Troy (III-V), Beycesultan (XII-VI), and Samos-Heraion (III-IV).
