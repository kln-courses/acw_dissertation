<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ways of Seeing Italy: Landscapes of Nation in Goethe's Italienische Reise and its Counter-Narratives THOMAS O. BEEBEE The Pennsylvania State University Seit 1000 Jahren ist kein Problem mehr gelist worden, d.h. kein neues gestellt worden-ftir solche Erkenntnisse ist eine Reise in Oberitalien niitzlich. -Carl Schmitt an Ernst Jiinger (1935) Erfassung und Durchdringung einer geschichtlichen Landschaft lii3t sich in Deutschland nur anwenden, nicht lernen. -Rudolf Borchardt, "Worms" Wir [Deutschen], die wir auf einem bald schmutzkotigen, bald staubigen, far- blosen, die Wiederscheine verdiisternden Boden und vielleicht gar in engen Gemiichern leben, kinnen einen solchen Frohblick aus uns selbst nicht entwickeln. - Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Italienische Reise' Since the publication of Goethe's Italienische Reise in 1816/17, the Italian landscape has been extraordinarily important-more important, perhaps, than the German landscape-for German intellectuals' understanding of them- selves, of history, and of culture, as these quotations, drawn from a host of pos- sible ones, clearly show. Both Carl Schmitt and Rudolf Borchardt, in the first two epigraphs, emphasize the change in cultural epistemology that a trip to Italy-and only a trip to Italy-may bring about in a German intellectual. Both authors, in my reading, thereby take up a position that Goethe first trans- ferred from the relatively narrow realms of artistic training and elite Grand Monatshefte, Vol. 94, No. 3, 2002 322 0026-9271/2002/0003/322 c 2002 by The Board of Regents of The University of Wisconsin System</page><page sequence="2">Ways of Seeing Italy 323 Tour to the concept of culture as a whole. What Goethe saw in Italy between 1786 and 1788 did not merely add to his mental database of images; it actively influenced his "way of seeing," to use John Berger's simple yet powerful phrase.2 The way of seeing Goethe developed in Italy, notes Mikhail Bakhtin, "searches for and finds primarily the visible movement of historical time, which is inseparable from the natural setting [. . .] and the entire totality of ob- jects created by man, which are essentially connected to this natural setting."3 The quotes from the twentieth century seem merely to restate Goethe's basic idea, that the landscape of Italy exerts a special power to lift the veil from one's eyes, to change one's way of thinking, and to instill "la gaya scienza" in Ger- man culture. Together, the quotes argue that the Germans still have not learned to see in the proper way. Lack of the "Frohblick" provokes a defective mental map. I examine how this theme is expounded and founded by Goethe, and in particular, how he links ways of seeing landscape and geography with ideas of nation. Given that both Germany and Italy were "nations without statehood" in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, these linkages are im- plicit, and the bringing of them to light requires ancillary texts such as the Italian Reise-Tagebuch and some reception history of the Italienische Reise, as well as placement within the context of preceding and subsequent travel narratives in German. Comparing the Italienische Reise with its counter- narratives reveals more clearly the national ideas found in this narrative of the Italian journey, and the way Italy is played off against Germany, which are subtle, convoluted, and imbued, to use Borchardt's language, with "historical landscapes." I use the term "counter-narrative" to designate those narratives that deliberately invoke the Italienische Reise in order to contrest its narrative strategies with their own. As Goethe's Italienische Reise countered both ratio- nalistic and Romantic accounts of Italy, so too no more deliberate repeal of Goethe can be found than Rolf Dieter Brinkmann's Rom, Blicke. That contemporaries of Goethe discerned national themes in the Ita- lienische Reise can be seen in the contrasting reactions of the historian Barthold Georg Niebuhr and the writer Ludwig Tieck. Niebuhr wrote from Rome to Friedrich Karl von Savigny in 1817 to complain that Goethe "so eine ganze Nation und ein ganzes Land bloB als eine Ergotzung ftir sich betrachtet, in der ganzen Welt und Natur nichts siehet, als was zu einer unendlichen Dekoration des erbiirmlichen Lebens gehirt."4 Niebuhr's letter has often been cited as a severe critique of the Italienische Reise, which it certainly is, but I wish to point out here that in his criticism Niebuhr correctly identifies the pro- cess by which Italy as nation and country have been sublimated into the Goethean gaze, whose vision of Italy in turn became central to his conception of what Germany should be. In a long, detailed, and insightful review of the Italienische Reise at its first appearance, Ludwig Tieck was moved to comment on the relationship be- tween time, space, and nationality in the work:</page><page sequence="3">324 Thomas O. Beebee [Goethe] vergiBt [...], dab unsere reine Sehnsucht nach dem Untergegangenen, wo keine Gegenwart uns mehr stdren kann, diese Reliquien und Fragmente verklirt und in jene reine Region der Kunst hintiberzieht. Diese ist aber auch niemals so auf Erden gewesen, daB wir unsere Sitte, Vaterland und Religion deshalb geringschitzen diirften. [...]. Ich hatte auch die Antike gesehen, Sankt Peter, und konnte den StraBburger Miinster nur um so mehr bewundern. Nach dem auswendig gelernten Raffael verstand ich erst die Lieblichkeit und Wiirde altdeutscher Kunst-und dies waire Oberflichlichkeit, Einseitigkeit etc. in mir gewesen? Ich liebe die Italiener und ihr leichtes Wesen, bin aber in Italien erst recht zum Deutschen geworden. [...] Ohne Vaterland kein Dichter!5 Tieck uses the occasion of Goethe's Italienische Reise to restate the discovery of German art he and Wackenroder had staged in works such as the Her- zensergieJ3ungen eines kunstliebenden Klosterbruders (1797), a book gener- ally considered to be the beginning of the Romantic movement in Germany, and the first in modern times to posit that artistic genius arises from religious inspiration. In this passage, Tieck also begins a tradition of providing counter- narratives to the Italienische Reise: his true admiration for the wonders of the Strassburg cathedral takes root after his trip to Italy, thereby reversing the chronological order of Goethe's acquaintance with monuments. Goethe's career in art criticism had begun with the essay, "Von deutscher Baukunst" (1772), which used the Muinster as an example to praise the Gothic style at the expense of Italian classicism.6 Niebuhr's disappointment with Goethe's way of seeing Italy, along with Goethe's own disappointment with the failure of his Italianizing project for Germany, have proved prophetic for the reception of the Italienische Reise. From the late nineteenth century to today, its place in the curriculum of Ger- man gymnasia has remained at around 1% of the total time devoted to Goethe's works.] Given that Niebuhr chides Goethe for overlooking the Ital- ians, while Tieck censures him for neglecting the Germans, we may suspect that a more accurate evaluation of the Italienische Reise lies somewhere in the middle, or, more precisely, in a dialectical reading in which each vision of Italy implies a corresponding one of Germany, and vice versa. Tieck fails to see that his comment on how Italy made him a true German applies to Goethe in the Italienische Reise as well, in the process known as Bildung. Let us examine how this works. Landscapes of Nation Upon his return to Naples from Sicily, for example, Goethe wrote to his friend Johann Gottfried Herder in Weimar: "wenn ich widerkomme, sollt Ihr beur- teilen, wie ich gesehen habe" (322). Goethe's advice to his friend also provides a tip for the reader that one way of reading the Italienische Reise is as a non- fictional Bildungsroman. Landscape is clearly linked to the process of Bildung</page><page sequence="4">Ways of Seeing Italy 325 that Goethe repeatedly invokes throughout the Italienische Reise. For ex- ample, in 1788, near the end of his stay in Rome, Goethe reflects on a change in his perception of the Italian landscape: Jetzt fangen erst die Biume, die Felsen, ja Rom selbst an mir lieb zu werden; bisher hab ich sie immer nur als fremd geffihlt; dagegen freuten mich geringe Gegenstinde, die mit denen Ahnlichkeit hatten, die ich in der Jugend sah. Nun muB ich auch erst hier zu Hause werden und doch kann ichs nie so innig sein als mit jenen ersten Gegenstanden des Lebens. Ich habe verschiedenes beziiglich auf Kunst und Nachahmung bei dieser Gelegenheit gedacht. (351) Chloe Chard has noted that eighteenth-century travelers characteristically "construct oppositions between the foreign and the familiar even when com- menting on relatively trivial aspects of the topography of foreignness."8 But Goethe's remarks move beyond opposition to an involved dialectic of famil- iarity and strangeness. First of all, one notes the zeugma in linking rocks and trees to Rome. One would expect, of course, in the place of these elements of landscape, to encounter urban phenomena such as buildings and streets, and customs such as the festivals and daily life Goethe describes elsewhere. One would expect to find people. Secondly, the process Goethe describes in this ci- tation is that of Bildung: the incorporation of the foreign into oneself, which, to use Susan Bernstein's formulation, "involve[s] a moment of appropriation of sensuous material into a meaningful structure, or one of the incarnation of meaning in a sensuous body."9 Thirdly, Goethe considers the judgment by oth- ers of his own vision as integral to his project. His own self-fashioning was meant to have repercussions on the society he returned to, that of the Weimar court and its resident intellectuals. Hence the element of reflexivity in every vision he has. In Italy Goethe learned to "unterscheiden, was mir eigen und was mir fremd ist" (350). The Italienische Reise offers many examples of such sensu- ous material-art, architecture, volcanoes, carnevale, and so on-but all these can be subsumed under the category of landscape. The assimilation is never complete: Goethe does not become Italian. Rather, Italy allows him to recognize why "erste Gegenstinde" provide the steadiest landmarks for self- orientation and impede his full transformation. The Italian journey taught Goethe that an idea of nation involves not an unreflective adaptation of cus- toms, traditions, and language; rather, nation became for him the difference between Germany and Italy, between what is familiar and what is foreign. Bil- dung also became Goethe's codeword for the political and social renewal of Germany upon his return from the south. Rejecting the radical solutions of the French Revolution, Goethe stressed that Germans would only become capable of forming a republic once they had become educated. In 1795 he outlined a dialectical view of the relationship between national authors and the nations they represent: a national author is someone who actively participates in the ability of a nation to conceive itself and its goals. At the same time, a national</page><page sequence="5">326 Thomas O. Beebee author must find his materials in the thoughts and actions of his compatriots: "Wenn er in der Geschichte seiner Nation groBe Begebenheiten und ihre Fol- gen in einer gliicklichen und bedeutenden Einheit vorfindet; wenn er in den Gesinnungen seiner Landsleute Gr6iBe, in ihren Empfindungen Tiefe und in ihren Handlungen Sttirke und Konsequenz nicht vermiBt [...] wenn er seine Nation auf einem hohen Grade der Kultur findet, so daB ihm seine eigene Bil- dung leicht wird." '0 This list of prerequisites amounts to Goethe's ultimatum to Germany, and prepares his resignation from any attempt at becoming Ger- many's national author, since in Goethe's view, "the Germans were unwilling to perfect themselves; they lacked 'Bildung' and it was not apparent that they were about to acquire it. [...] Goethe clearly generalized and stressed that the Germans were unable 'sich zu bilden,' men and women, and that this lack of 'Bildung' was one of their major national faults." ' This lack in the Ger- mans contrasted to Goethe's experience of the Italians, who regardless of so- cial class had been formed by-indeed, who lived their lives surrounded by - their classical heritage, at least in Goethe's way of seeing as transmitted in the Italienische Reise. Hence the turning away from politics and the lack of pro- German nationalistic statements in Goethe's post-Italian works and letters, as noted by Wolfgang Rothe.'2 Near the end of his life, Goethe ascribed a somewhat different dialectic of Bildung to the Napoleonic wars and named its result Weltliteratur, thus pro- jecting his own biographical experience onto the larger dimension of cultural and historical developments: "Es ist schon einige Zeit von einer allgemeinen Weltliteratur die Rede, und zwar nicht mit Unrecht: denn die stimtlichen Nationen, in den ftirchterlichsten Kriegen durcheinander geschiittelt, sodann wieder auf sich selbst einzeln zurtickgeftihrt, hatten zu bemerken, daB sie manches Fremdes gewahr worden, in sich aufgenommen, bisher unbekannte geistige Bediirfnisse hie und da empfunden."'13 Perhaps because it was so dis- tasteful to him, Goethe does not mention here the other side of the dialectic, the rise of German nationalism as a reaction to Napoleonic imperialism. Goethe's admission here of the rearrangement of Europe through the Napo- leonic wars contrasts strangely with the narrative strategy of the Italienische Reise. The Verfremdungseffekt of the Italienische Reise is doubled by the book's publishing at such a distance-across the turn of a century and a rev- olution-from when the travel took place.'4 Goethe had seen his journey to Italy as a necessary beginning for the construction of a viable German modus vivendi, and thus his entire journey stands under the "never-severed ties to German conditions, a tension which unifies the entire book and which we would call in today's jargon the 'Weimar Syndrome.'" "5 The crisis that drove Goethe from Germany, and his efforts at incorporating his self-transformation into Weimar culture on his return, form a shadow narrative to that of the Italienische Reise proper. Heinrich Niederer posits a Goethean "Reisekunst" that stretches from the departure for Italy up</page><page sequence="6">Ways of Seeing Italy 327 to Goethe's largely unsuccessful reintegration into Weimar society.16 His few literary works completed in Italy, such as Iphigenie auf Tauris, as well as those completed after his stay there, were to serve as models for German literature the way his construction of an Italian villa in Weimar was to serve as a model for German architecture and the constitution of public vs. private space. The story of Goethe's return to Germany is told not in the Italienische Reise, but in one of the many apparatuses attached to the Metamorphose der Pflanzen, a book inspired by the trip to Italy. Complementary to the gradual coming into clarity of the trip southward, the return northward was a dissolution of form: "Aus Italien dem formreichen war ich in das gestaltlose Deutschland zuruick- gewiesen, heiteren Himmel mit einem dtisteren zu vertauschen. [... N]iemand verstand meine Sprache." 17 Everything related to "eigen und fremd" is re- versed in this passage, including the terms of at-homeness and strangeness in- dicated by the comprehension of language. It is as though Goethe had returned to Germany speaking Italian. This, too, is Bildung, in accordance with Hans- Georg Gadamer's idea that "nicht die Entfremdung als solche, sondern die Heimkehr zu sich, die freilich Entfremdung voraussetzt, macht das Wesen der Bildung aus."'8 Hence, the paradox of the Italienische Reise as a narrative of nationalism: like Dante's journey ad astram which must begin with a down- ward motion, so the journey of German renewal must pass southward before returning to its Northern home. "It was in the paradise of the south that Goethe began to accustom himself to life in the German north." 19 Germany and Italy are the two sides of a M6bius strip, different and yet the same. The Intercalated Self The complicated nexus of concerns in the Italienische Reise is reflected in its history of composition and publication. While in Italy, Goethe continually wrote letters home, and also kept a notebook and various other annotations. Upon his return to Weimar, he published a few scattered writings, such as the description of Roman carnival, in various journals. He eventually put together the bulk of the Italienische Reise from these heterogeneous writings.20 Melitta Gerhard has pointed out the systematic nature of the changes Goethe wrought in this material. Goethe systematically eliminates the dialogic aspects of the letters, for example, and turns their singular addressees into a indefinite, north- ern "Leserkreis" for his dispatches from Italy, with the result that "alles aus- serhalb Italiens Liegende wirdjetzt in die Ausstrahlung des italienischen Luft- kreises hineingezogen. Goethe gewinnt dadurch ftir seine Darstellung eine sehr viel grdssere Abgeschlossenheit als sie den ursprtinglichen Aufzeich- nungen eigen ist, eine stirkere Losl6sung und Freiheit."21 Corresponding to Goethe's symbolic appropriation of geodesic and topographic vocabulary into the cultural realm with which he is concerned, is his transformation of the ma- terial of his own writings for the preparation of his narrative. The effect, as</page><page sequence="7">328 Thomas O. Beebee several critics have noted, is to make the traveler reporting his Italian experi- ence into a fictional character equally different from the thirty-seven year-old who made the trip and the sixty-seven year-old who published the text.22 Reiner Wild notes that as an autobiographic text, the Italienische Reise adds a level of complexity to the standard and unavoidable tension between "erzihlendem Ich" and "erzahltem Ich." Unlike in many autobiographies, the narrated self of the Italienische Reise also narrates: "Das erzBihlende Ich, also der Autobiograph G[oethe], 'erzihlt' in der Bearbeitung der Zeugenisse von einem Ich, das seinerseits als ein erzahlendes oder jedenfalls berichtendes, sich in Tagebuch, Briefen und Aufzeichnungen AuBerndes Ich erscheint."23 Furthermore, part of the narration achieved by this narrated self involves its own process of construction under the rubric of "rebirth." Lilian Furst has called this dialectical construction of an alienated self in the Italienische Reise the "intercalation of the writing self."24 An example would be the "intercala- tion of the narrator" into the Italian landscape, as we have already seen in the description of Rome. Logically, there are two methods for intercalation: spa- tial and temporal. That is, Goethe can (verbally) paint a landscape or other scene in which he himself appears; or, he can tell a story in which he him- self enacts a role. So-called travel narratives nearly always present a compos- ite of narration (of events unfolding in time) and description (of characteris- tics arranged spatially), mixed in some proportion. Like modulation between keys in common-practice music, the rate and method of change from one mode to the other becomes part of the work's significance. Thus, we have four possible dispositions determined by the two binary choices: narrate vs. de- scribe; and be an engaged vs. objective narrator or descriptor. For example, the passage quoted at the beginning of this section describes rather than narrates, and definitely intercalates the narrator into what is described. Goethe does not report, for example, that he now understands Italian language and customs much better than he had in 1786, when he first trod Italian soil. Indeed, people and society are absent from this quotation, unless obliquely referred to in the locus "Rome." This is the side of the Italienische Reise that caused Niebuhr's reaction. But Goethe's most serious interactions with Italy are to be traced not in disengaged comments on local customs, but in the ways in which the nar- rator intercalates himself into Italy. The strategies for doing so change con- stantly throughout the narrative, and determine much of the texture of the Ita- lienische Reise in ways I will now analyze. Ways of Seeing, Ways of Narrating Goethe's approach to the temple of Minerva in Assisi shows the interdepen- dence of narrative and description in developing the character of the narrator. He leaves the coach, wishing "durch die fuir mich so einsame Welt eine Fugwanderung anzustellen" (116). He enjoys his view of the symmetrical ar-</page><page sequence="8">Ways of Seeing Italy 329 chitecture and the temple's location, the latter of which Palladio had left out of his drawing. He lets the view of the temple transform him: "Was sich durch die Beschauung dieses Werks in mir entwickelt, ist nicht auszusprechen und wird ewige Frtichte bringen" (118). This is the first of many "hidden" narra- tives Goethe keeps secret in a game of trompe l'oeil with his readers. He then chooses to narrate a story, in which reality intervenes to interrupt contempla- tion: "Ich ging am schinsten Abend, die r6imische StraBe bergab, im Gemuit zum schinsten beruhiget, als ich hinter mir rauhe, heftige Stimmen vernahm [. . .]" (118). The owners of these voices surround Goethe and question his presence at the Minerva temple. Goethe eventually calms their suspicions that he is a smuggler, but the incident gives the rest of his walking tour a peculiar, dark twist. In moving from description to narration, Goethe also places him- self more in the foreground, makes himself stand out dramatically from his surroundings, and thus heightens the tension between his foreignness and the Italy that will provide him with the contrasts against which he can mold him- self. From Greek architecture, life falls back into the prehistoric, as Goethe notes that the residences of this area resemble caves. Their inhabitants make no efforts to improve their residences, nor even to prepare for the winter. It is as though the "rauhe Stimmen" had condensed and concretized themselves into rough surroundings. Narrative has changed to description. Goethe further dramatizes the atavistic landscape by letting it affect his ability to write: "Hier in Foligno, in einer vi6llig homerischen Haushaltung, wo alles um ein auf der Erde brennendes Feuer in einer groBen Halle versammelt ist, schreit und lirmt, am langen Tische speist, wie die Hochzeit von Kana gemalt wird, er- greife ich die Gelegenheit, dieses zu schreiben, da einer ein TintenfaB ho- len lhBt, woran ich unter solchen Umstinden nicht gedacht hitte. Aber man sieht auch diesem Blatt die Kalte und die Unbequemlichkeit meines Schreib- tisches an" (120). The first words of the next entry are simply "Wieder in einer Hohle sitzend [ . .]" (121). Narrative, classical and Biblical allusions, and self- reflexive description of the conditions he writes in, all contribute to Goethe's intercalation into a landscape. In a similar fashion, Goethe moves between narrative and description in the pages he devotes to the Santa Rosalia church built into the cliffs above Palermo. After describing the technical apparatus used for carrying away the water from what is essentially a cave, Goethe approaches the altar with its statue of Rosalia: "Ein schi6nes Frauenzimmer erblickt' ich bei dem Schein einiger stillen Lampen. Sie lag wie in einer Art von Entztickung, die Augen halb geschlossen, den Kopf nachlissig auf die rechte Hand gelegt, die mit vie- len Ringen geschmtickt war. Ich konnte das Bild nicht genug betrachten; es schien mir ganz besondere Reize zu haben" (239). Goethe goes on to demon- strate the truth of his statement that he could not get enough of Rosalia's im- age. The description of his trance before the image forms perhaps the greatest time-dilation in the whole Italienische Reise. Goethe struggles against the nar-</page><page sequence="9">330 Thomas O. Beebee rative impedence caused by the fact that he is describing stillness and trance. The more nothing is done, the more words are needed to describe the satori that the meditator experiences. The monks enter and sing vespers. Goethe lis- tens awhile, and then approaches the altar again. He kneels, and tries "das schine Bild der Heiligen noch deutlicher gewahr zu werden. Ich iiberlieB mich ganz der reizenden Illusion der Gestalt und des Ortes. Der Gesang der Geist- lichen verklang nun in der HIIhle, das Wasser rieselte in das Behiltnis gleich neben dem Altare zusammen, die tiberhangenden Felsen des Vorhofs, des eigentlichen Schiffs der Kirche, schlossen die Szene noch mehr ein" (239). Goethe's description moves outward, from the momentary and transitory, such as the musical setting, to the essential, the telluric setting of the church. The totality of the aesthetico-religious experience, merging art, architecture, and music within a palpable topographic framework, and uniting present and past, is the equivalent of the Urpflanze that Goethe sought in Italy. There is a reason for the existence of this church, a reason allied with the earth and its secrets, yet found only in the experience of the moment, a moment which seems to ex- pand infinitely. Goethe ends his description with the notation that he arrived back in Palermo "erst in spiter Nacht" (240). The striking ellipsis between the few sentences of narrative and the end of the story encompasses this infinity. On the whole, then, the Italienische Reise tends towards engaged narra- tive. Missing from it is any extensive, objective, disengaged description of Italy as a whole culture or landscape. (The closest we get, as I will show be- low, is Italy as a climatological unit.) Herbert Lehmann has noted the Ita- lienische Reise's avoidance of totalizing description: "The Italienische Reise breathes Landscape in almost every line, but if one looks for quotes to confirm this overall impression, one finds a large number of exact observations, char- acterized for the most part by a lengthy, scientific description of landscape."25 Goethe himself says as much: "Wenn man hier nicht phantastisch verftihrt, sondern die Gegend real nimmt, wie sie daliegt, so ist sie doch immer der entscheidende Schauplatz, der die gr6Bten Taten bedingt, und so habe ich immer bisher den geologischen und landschaftlichen Blick benutzt, um Ein- bildungskraft und Empfindung zu unterdrticken und mir ein freies, klares Anschauen der Lokalitat zu erhalten" (122). The sentence seems to describe Goethe's training in landscape drawing, a major educational objective of his Italian sojourn. Very familiar with landscape painting-numerous individual painters find mention in the narrative, from Claude Lorrain to Aert van der Neer- Goethe intuitively recognized what the genre, a relatively new one in the history of painting, meant: the subordination of topographic and cultural features to a single, coherent, dominating gaze. Goethe interprets the social re- lations of the Italian villa through its organization under the dominant gaze of the signore: "Eine herrliche, obgleich nicht unerwartete Aussicht ward uns aus den Fenstern der Villa des Fiirsten Aldobrandini. [. . .] Es lai(t sich denken, daB man das SchloB dergestalt angelegt hat, die Herrlichkeit der Hiugel und</page><page sequence="10">Ways of Seeing Italy 331 des flachen Landes mit einem Blick tibersehen zu kinnen" (409). Here, land- scape equals control of the land and of the social system. Goethe intuitively grasps the "analogy between the rural estate and the state of the realm which is so frequently made in poetry and in the country house picture," an analogy that "reinforces the ideology of landscape in the service of absolutism. A well- managed country house and its lands form a self-sufficient world, a micro- cosm of the mercantilist state[ ... .] But [that world's] harmony rests ultimately on its subordination to the care and authority of one all-powerful lord, as the harmony of its landscape depends on the lordship of the eye."26 Goethe was not an apologist for absolutism as realized in either Germany or Italy; how- ever, as mentioned at the beginning of this essay, he did consider common Germans to be in need of guardianship by a powerful lord until the time when Bildung, cultural awareness, could elevate them to the necessary state of po- litical awareness where they could determine their own destiny. His descrip- tion of the aesthetically placed mansion parallels both the seemingly disinter- ested world of landscape painting, and a political view of order and control emanating from a single, elevated perspective. In contrast to these first-person descriptions and mini-narratives that "in- tercalate" the traveler into the landscape, Goethe resists those narratives that do not include him. For example, he rejects the efforts of his Palerman guide to vivify the landscape with a report of Hannibal's activities there: Die schinste Friuhlingswitterung und eine hervorquellende Fruchtbarkeit ver- breitete das Geffihl eines belebenden Friedens tiber das ganze Tal, welches mir der ungeschickte Ftihrer durch seine Gelehrsamkeit verkimmerte, umstindlich erzihlend, wie Hannibal hier vormals eine Schlacht geliefert und was ftir unge- heure Kriegstaten an dieser Stelle geschehen. Unfreundlich verwies ich ihm das fatale Hervorrufen solcher abgeschiedenen Gespenster. Es sei schlimm genug, meinte ich, da3 von Zeit zu Zeit die Saaten, wo nicht immer von Elephanten doch von Pferden und Menschen zerstampft werden miilten. Man solle wenig- stens die Einbildungskraft nicht mit solchem Nachgettimmel aus ihrem fried- lichen Traume aufschrecken. Er verwunderte sich sehr, daB ich das klassische Andenken an so einer Stelle verschmihte, und ich konnte ihm freilich nicht deutlich machen, wie mir bei einer solchen Vermischung des Vergangenen und des Gegenwirtigen zumute sei. (233) Goethe refuses to hear this story, refuses to mix present with past, geography with history. He wishes instead to hear the stories told by landscape. Goethe himself gives at least two reasons for banishing the story of Hannibal from the scene, both involving the principle of decorum: a feeling of peace should not be disturbed by stories of war; and present and past should not be jumbled to- gether. This incident should nuance the prevailing view of the Italienische Reise as a classicizing document. Here we see resistance to history's claims on the Sicilian landscape. Goethe turns instead to assembling pebbles which he</page><page sequence="11">332 Thomas O. Beebee will be able to shape into an ostensibly more useful narrative, that of the land- scape itself and of how it came to be: Noch wunderlicher erschien ich diesem Begleiter, als ich auf allen seichten Stellen, deren der Flu3 gar viele trocken lhit, nach Steinchen suchte und die ver- schiedenen Arten derselben mit mir forttrug. Ich konnte ihm abermals nicht er- kliren, daB man sich von einer gebirgigen Gegend nicht schneller einen Begriff machen kann, als wenn man die Gesteinsarten untersucht, die in den Bichen herabgeschoben werden, und daB hier auch die Aufgabe sei, durch Triimmer sich eine Vorstellung von jenen ewig klassischen HThen des Erdaltertums zu verschaffen (233) In the struggle between nature and culture, nature clearly wins in this example. Goethe's distaste for history was, as Hans-Dietrich Dahnke and Pierre Bertaux remind us, as deep-seated as his discomfort with cold and rainy weather.27 But beyond rejection of history, there is a constructive element in his preference for pebbles. Goethe, no less than his troublesome guide, links present and past in his own narrative. He uses the adjective "klassisch" again, but with its meaning now in the register of natural rather than cultural periodization, thus implicity establishing an opposition between narratives of historical actors in a natural setting vs. narratives of the actions of landscape itself. Bakhtin reads the incident as pointing out, first, Goethe's dislike of the "estranged past" in favor of understanding the "necessary place of this past in the unbroken line of historical development," and second, Goethe's principle that "the past must be creative."28 TO this we should add, however, that the narrative Goethe con- structs from pebbles belongs entirely to him. He does not even share it with his readers, keeping it as another, hidden narrative whose invisibility increases the narrator's power, just as the power of the landlord's gaze rests partly in its ability to conceal its own positionality. The aesthetic pleasure of the control- ling gaze from the Aldobrini house lies in part in one's ability to see without being seen, a principle articulated most notably by Jay Appleton.29 Geodetic Differences We might say that Goethe looks at Italy with multiple sets of eyes. Some of his perspectives are analytic in the original sense of the word: they separate a single aspect of the terrain and concentrate on it, at the expense of others. An easily identifiable way of seeing in this sense is the scientific. From time to time, Goethe singles out a particular aspect of the landscape for geological or botanical analysis, as we have seen in the story of the pebbles. The power of this way of seeing rests in its ability to screen out all others, such as the his- torical. Another set of modes comprises the synthetic aspect of experiencing landscape. It corresponds exactly with Gerhard Hard's definition of landscape as the conjunction of its parts.30 Goethe uses every possible vocabulary in his</page><page sequence="12">Ways of Seeing Italy 333 attempt to describe this relationship, from geology to art criticism. Goethe sees Sicily, for example, "with the eyes of Claude Lorrain," as a totality where nature and society are one: "Das Volk ist fuir ihn Teil der Natur, nicht der Geschichte."31 Goethe implies through his descriptions that the Italian people have achieved an identity through the conjunction of history, culture, and em- beddedness in the landscape that makes them a Volk. One can agree with Lil- ian Furst that Italy for Goethe is "a living present panorama, an actuality that has its concrete incarnation in the Volk."32 The price of changing this vision, Goethe never tires of repeating, is high, and the process lengthy: Wenn man bedenkt, da3 Jahrhunderte hier im hjchsten Sinne architektonisch gewaltet, daB auf uibriggebliebenen machtigen Substruktionen, die ktinstleri- schen Gedanken vorzuiglicher Geister sich hervorgehoben und den Augen dar- gestellt, so wird man begreifen wie sich Geist und Aug' entziicken miissen, wenn man unter jeder Beleuchtung diese vielfachen horizontalen und tausend vertikalen Linien unterbrochen und geschmtickt wie eine stumme Musik mit den Augen auffa3t, und wie alles, was klein und beschrinkt in uns ist, nicht ohne Schmerz erregt und ausgetrieben wird. (408) In a diary passage, Goethe notes that part of this "natural history" of Italian ar- chitecture is the public use of buildings erected by the upper classes: Doch weis ich nicht wie es im Innern ihrer Palazzi aussieht. Die Vorhi5fe, Siulenglinge p sind alle mit Unrath besudelt und das ist ganz natiurlich, man muB nur wieder vom Volck herauf steigen. Das Volck ftihlt sich immer vor. Der Reiche kann reich seyn, Palliste bauen, der Nobile darf regiren, aber wenn er einen Siulengang, einen Vorhof anlegt, so bedient sich das Volck dessen zu seinem BedtirfniB und das hat kein dringenderes als das so schnell als m6glich loszuwerden was es so htiuffig als miglich zu sich genommen hat.

An dffentlichen Gebauden laBt sich das Volck sein Recht nicht nehmen. Und so gehts durch ganz Italien. Noch eine Betrachtung die man nicht leicht macht.33 The two observations in these quotes seem to lie on the same order of dif- ficulty. Both are part of the process of Bildung, and implicitly compare Ger- man with Italian reality. We must ascribe the difficulty of arriving at this con- clusion to the difference between Italian and German "public spheres." Goethe counters here a number of "enlightened" or "rationalistic" travel narratives that point out the uncleanliness and laziness of the Italian people with a polit- ical interpretation of the relation between grandiose architecture and its ap- propriation by the people. The difference is captured by turning the descrip- tion of an architectural image into a narrative. The narrative Goethe gives here might stand for his conception of the best relation to be hoped for between</page><page sequence="13">334 Thomas O. Beebee ruler and ruled. Not democratic or egalitarian, but with the people retaining important powers and the nobility important obligations. Of course, the pic- ture is hardly ideal; the power of the people is expressed in their right to dirty the atria and colonnades of semi-public buildings, hardly an uplifting activity. It is also expressed in the thirty-eight official holidays, such as Carnival, re- duced from more than one hundred a few years before Goethe's visit. Goethe's striking of the passage from the Italienische Reise derives, among other fac- tors, from his hardened position against populism following the French Revo- lution and Napoleon. Well-known is Goethe's unease with the French Revolu- tion and with the "national idea," the latter of which he found "insufferable," despite his sympathies for the uniqueness of each "Volk."34 Consistent with this vision of a people imbricated in a landscape, Goethe insists on using spatial coordinates, whose largest dimensions are the lines of latitude crossed in his journey southward. The mentioning of parallels of lati- tude punctuates Goethe's account of his journey. He lends to each latitude line a significance that personalizes the contemporary scientific theories of ge- ography, geodesy, and climate that drew his attention to these phenomena. Goethe first ties the fifty-first parallel, where he had been living in Weimar, to the continual diminishment of his talent and personality in the attrition of governmental and bureaucratic activity: "ich mu3 gestehen, da meine Reise eigentlich eine Flucht war vor allen den Unbilden, die ich unter dem einund- funfzigsten Grade erlitten, daB ich Hoffnung hatte, unter dem achtundvierzig- sten ein wahres Gosen zu betreten" (18-19). Goethe goes on to explain that his travels have taught him that simply going south does not necessarily alter the weather picture. Already in the first entry of 3 September, 1786, the same day he steals away from his friends at 3:00 a.m., "weil man mich sonst nicht fortgelassen h~itte" (9), by noon he finds himself at the same latitude as his home town of Frankfurt, where "ich freute mich, wieder einmal bei klarem Himmel unter dem ftinfzigsten Grade zu Mittag zu essen," (9). On or about the 5th of September he enters yet another zone: "Heute schreibe ich unter dem neunundvierzigsten Grade. Er liBt sich gut an" (11), he reports. On the sixth, he buys a fig in Munich, but finds its taste unworthy of the latitude, widening the complaint to a general breach of geographical decorum: "das Obst tiber- haupt ist doch fir den achtundvierzigsten Grad nicht besonders gut" (12). Like the numbers one might use to count down from a state of tension to one of relaxation, Goethe uses these parallels to demarcate the stages of his own transformation and rebirth. They thus become yet another strategy for in- tercalating self into landscape. Just before he reaches the forty-sixth parallel, it seems to him that he has crossed the boundary of an entirely New World: "Geschrieben unter dem ftinfundvierzigsten Grade funfzig Minuten. In der Abendktihle ging ich spazieren und befinde mich nun wirklich in einem neuen Lande, in einer ganz fremden Umgebung. Die Menschen leben ein nachlis- siges Schlaraffenleben" (29). This is written in Torbole, where Italian has be-</page><page sequence="14">Ways of Seeing Italy 335 come the dominant language. Goethe has taken the latitudinal degrees de- signed to render continuous measurement, and converted them into a device for announcing sudden transformation. The comments of Italo Battafarano on this passage are of interest: Ausgangspunkt ist die Feststellung des Fremdseins der Ich-Person. Der Rei- sende unterstreicht dabei ganz entschieden, da3 die Differenz zwischen Deutsch- land und Italien keine quantitative oder graduelle, sondern eine qualitative ist. Anstatt wie tiblicherweise von einem "anderen" Land, spricht Goethe von einem "neuen Land," welches nicht fremd, sonder "ganz fremd" anmutet. Nicht an der Grenze zwischen den zwei Sprachgebieten, nicht bei der Bezahlung in einer fremden Devise, nicht im Verkehr und auch nicht beim Essen oder Schlafen konstatiert Goethe in einem fremden Land zu sein, sondern beim abendlichen Spaziergang am Ufer des Gardasees.35 Of course, only in a careless moment can a "careless life of ease" be perceived that seems to Goethe a remnant of an earlier stage of human existence, a fore- taste of the "Homeric" conditions of Foligno. After an extended stay in Venice, Goethe repeats the idea of the absolute alterity of Italy as he refers once more to latitude: "Ich bin nun in den ftinfundvierzigsten Grad wirklich eingetreten und wiederhole mein altes Lied. [.. .] Es ist denn doch ein ander Sein" (100). As he explains in the diary, Goethe measures parallels not to know the stations on the earth he is passing through, but the relation of earth to sky. Their conjunction now signal his finally reaching a land where the people live "unter einem glticklichen Himmel der Natur."36 Goethe's preoccupation with latitude may derive at least in part from the inadequacy of national boundaries in his period to define location. In Ekkehart Krippendorf's analysis, Goethe had numerous models of nation available to him, from the Kleinstaat of Weimar through the nation-states of France and Prussia, to the federative Holy Roman Empire. His choice was for the Kulturnation.37 Hence the erasure of political boundaries in the Italienische Reise. The fact that Goethe had left the kingdom of Bohemia (where he was vacationing at Karlsbad) and entered the state of Bavaria was unimportant to him, and he does not mention the fact. No moment of border-crossing and passport inspection is ever portrayed in the Italienische Reise, though such moments must surely have occurred. The fact is that German is still spoken in Munich, as it is in Bolzano, and hence these places are for Goethe stages on the way towards the new, which is defined in terms of language, culture, art, latitude, and landscape. Goethe deliberately left out of the Italienische Reise more directly po- litical statements about this "new land" recorded in the diary, such as the following: In einem Lande wo man des Tags geniett, besonders aber sich des Abends freut, ist es hochst bedeutend wenn es Nacht wird, Wann die Arbeit des Tages auf-</page><page sequence="15">336 Thomas O. Beebee hire? Wann der Spazierginger ausgehen und zurtickkommen muB.

Und was ein Tag sey wissen wir Cimmerier im ewigen Nebel und Triibe kaum, uns ist's einerley ob's Tag oder Nacht ist, denn welcher Stunde kinnen wir uns unter FREYEM HIM- MEL freuen?38 Goethe plays here with the double meaning of "free": without clouds; but also symbolic of political and social freedom. Klaus Kiefer comments that in this passage the "concrete utopia," Italy's "special feature, the climatic advantage, is made into a mytheme of general feedom through the anthropomorphic at- tribute 'happy.'"'39 Counter-Narratives The Italienische Reise can be considered a counter-narrative to selected Ital- ian travel books that came before it. Previous scholarship has provided a thor- ough listing of these narratives, but a true literary history constructed as a web of reactions, allusions, references, and interconnections remains to be writ- ten.40 In the space of this article I can only mention highlights and selected ex- amples that clarify the fact that Italian travel narratives evolve in a sequence of what Hans-Robert JauB would call "provocations," in which a particular narrative works against a horizon of expectations created by the existing nexus of texts to which it will be compared by its readers.41 Goethe takes aim at two main groups of texts on Italy, which Camillo von Klenze calls the Rationalis- tic and the Romantic. "Rationalistic" travel narratives tended to give small place to medieval and early Renaissance art, and to highlight the backwardness of Italian eco- nomic, social, and political institutions in comparison especially with those of England. D. J. J. Volkmann's Historisch-kritische Nachrichten von Italien served both as Goethe's main guidebook in Italy, and also as a main target of his counter-narrative.42 The passage on the presence of garbage in the atria and colonnades of great houses cited above furnishes a good example of Goethe's ability to insert behavior that a rationalist would simply criticize as deficient or uncivilized into a larger order where it becomes coherent and, in this case, a form of political accommodation. Another example is Goethe's observation of the "little people" of Naples whom Volkmann had criticized as "MiiBig- ginger." Citing Volkmann's critique directly, Goethe then notes: "Ich vermu- tete zwar sehr bald nach einiger erlangter Kenntnis des siidlichen Zustandes, daB dies wohl eine nordische Ansicht sein michte, wo man jeden fuir einen MiiBigginger hWlt, der sich nicht den ganzen Tag ingstlich abmiiht. [... Ich] konnte zwar sehr viel tibelgekleidete Menschen bemerken, aber keine unbe- schiftigten" (332). The so-called "Romantic" group of travel narratives are characterized by their confrontation with the French occupation of Italy, and by a subjective and</page><page sequence="16">Ways of Seeing Italy 337 often lyrical attitude that replaces the simple conveying of information. "Not information, but inspiration, dictates the records."43 We have already seen how Goethe counters the latter aspect by emphasizing the real as opposed to the fantastic. Despite its high degree of self-reflexivity, the Italienische Reise emphasizes exact observation rather than inspiration. In terms of the former characteristic, Hans-Georg Werner has noted that Goethe's sharp demarcation of Italy as "a new country" did not occur to the readers of the first published version of the Italienische Reise in 1816. The Napoleonic wars had impressed them with the overall unity of Europe, and with the invisibility and perme- ability of the borders between nations. Johann Gottfried Seume's Spaziergang nach Syrakus im Jahre 1802 exemplifies this perspective, recording at almost every station of his journey the presence of the French and the Italian reaction to them, as in this description of the shrine of Loreto, reporting the discourse of the local residents: "die entsetzlichen Franzosen, die doch sonst die aller- christlichste Nation waren, hatten sich nicht entblddet der heiligen Jungfrau offenbare Gewalt anzutun, wortiber die hiesigen frommen grote Klagelieder und Verwtinschungen anstimmen: aber die neue Salbung des grogen Dema- gogen gibt auf einmal der Sache fuir die Gottseligkeit eine andere Wendung."44 "Der grote Demagoge" is of course Napoleon, and his anointment refers to the concordat with Pope Pius VII. Concomitantly, Seume fills his narrative with the tiresome daily aspects of life that Goethe ignores, such as frequent passport control (together with the payment of bribes), beggars, the discom- forts of travel, and the like. Like Seume, travelers to Italy began seeing not the antique, but the modern, the political processes of invasion and later of nation- building.45 We have seen that Goethe recognizes these changes in other writ- ings, such as his discussion of Weltliteratur quoted above, which makes the publication of the Italienische Reise a deliberate act of nostalgia, or of subtle resistance to the new European order.46 Against this horizon of expectations, the Italienische Reise predictably failed to impress its initial reading public. Just as predictably, when Goethe was raised to the status of national author under the impetus of German unification, the Italienische Reise began to overshadow all other texts on that horizon. We can see this shift in the appearance of what might be called "para- narratives" to Goethe's, that is, of travel accounts that allow themselves to be completely guided by and absorbed into the Italienische Reise, as though the horizon of expectations of their readers had been formed solely through the reading of that classic. The title of Georg von Graevenitz's Goethe un- ser Reisebegleiter in Italien expresses this idea.47 Another example is Julius Haarhuis's "re-creation" of Goethe's journey in AufGoethes Spuren in Italien, published in 1896-7 as part of the series "Kennst du das Land. Eine Bticher- sammlung ftir die Freunde Italiens." Haarhuis alternates quotes from the text of the Italienische Reise with present-day observations of the cities and land- scapes described by Goethe. He contrasts the newness of engineering marvels, such as the railroad over the Brenner Pass, with the static nature of Italian agri-</page><page sequence="17">338 Thomas O. Beebee culture. The ability to become good engineers, he claims, is the only difference between the Italians of the 1890s and those of a century earlier.48 Cecilia Novero has analyzed other, post-war German narratives on Italy that perform much the same function, emphasizing Italian exoticness and freezing the na- tion in time. Indeed, Novero titled her essay, "Sleeping Beauty."49 Other post-war narratives of Italian travels, such as Rolf Dieter Brink- mann's Rom, Blicke (1979; hereinafter Rom), on the other hand, act as counter- narratives to the Italienische Reise by deconstructing the idea of nation. Brinkmann (1940-1975) focuses neither on the differences between Ger- mans, Italians, and Austrians, nor on the wonders of Roman architecture and city life. Even climatic observations- other than of smog and pollution- rarely appear in the course of more than 400 pages recording every detail of his months in Rome. Brinkmann places emphasis instead on the disappearance of all individuality under the triumph of international capitalism and its Massenkultur. Like Goethe, Brinkmann escaped from an uncomfortable situ- ation in Germany (including, in this case, both his married life and the fallout from the 1960s student movement) by spending several months in Rome-as a fellow of the German government, parallel to Goethe's generous support by the Duke of Weimar. The modern-day equivalent of Karl August was the in- dustrialist Eduard Arnhold, who in 1910 bought part of the estate of a former villa on the outskirts of Rome. Since then the Villa Massimo has been an art- ist's colony in Rome run by the German government, with its residents se- lected from the different Lander on a competitive basis. Every other year ten writers, artists, composers, and architects are chosen for this year-long fel- lowship. The visual arts and architecture seem to predominate, reflecting the unbroken attraction of Rome as a center of the plastic arts. Besides Brink- mann, who is probably the most famous writer to have lodged at the Villa Massimo, the poet Lioba Happel and the novelist Michael Wildenhain have also been fellows. Wildenhain's short memoir of his experience, published in the Tagesspiegel, indicates with its subtitle, "Neurosen bluihen im Park," that Brinkmann's account of a stressful living situation was par for the course.50 Like the Italienische Reise, Rom is constructed out of a variety of mate- rials: letters and postcards, diary entries, photographs, maps, restaurant bills, and excerpts from literature. Unlike Goethe, Brinkmann did not seek to hide the heterogeneity of this material. On the contrary, he deliberately made the text of Rom look like a scrapbook as the visible component of a technique called "cut-up." "Cut-up," borrowed by Brinkmann from the writing prac- tice of William Burroughs, seeks to juxtapose radically different texts, thus emptying them of meaning and allowing the language or image to speak "for itself." Letters alternate with diary entries, which in turn contain descrip- tions, theory, political observations, accounts of money spent, and stream-of- consciousness writing. In the opinion of Hermann Schl6sser, "Diese Wahrneh- mungsintensittit der Cut-up-Blicke ist es zu allererst, die das Rom-Buch als</page><page sequence="18">Ways of Seeing Italy 339 Reiseliteratur interessant macht, die schweifende, 'gleitende' Prosa, die ihr entspricht, ist dem Reiseverlauf direkt proportional.""' Implicitly, Brink- mann's text rejects any attempt at the "intercalation of the writing self," even though Brinkmann's perceptions and emotions are always the focus of our at- tention. The anchor of our reading experience of Rom, Blicke is not an inter- calated self, but rather the very principle and feeling of motion and in- betweenness that precludes a sense of self, what Hans Adler has called the "subjectively experienced lucidity of the here and now."52 A subjectivity con- cerned only with the present, occupied fully by aesthetic feelings, is of course not a product of Bildung and falls outside classical ideas of the subject, ap- proaching instead the deconstructive pyschoanalytic views of Jacques Lacan. In Sibylle Spath's words, "[v]on dem hochgestimmten Ton selbstbewuBter Subjektivitit des spliten achtzehnten Jahrhunderts ist die Auseinandersetzung mit dem modernen Subjekt, die auch in Brinkmanns Reisetagebuch eine zen- trale Rolle spielt, allerdings weit entfernt."53 The lack of a central conscious- ness in favor of, in Adler's reading, an aisthesis that always operates in the present, negates the Goethean linking of past and present. In Rom, Rome is not the "eternal city," but a jumble of images in which ancient and modern are jux- taposed, without history. It is well known that Goethe's expectations for Italy were shaped by the accounts of previous travelers, including his father. He traveled to Italy with a well-formed mental map of the landscapes he would find there: he found them because they were "on the map." Brinkmann fights such preconceptions in every sentence he writes. Goethe provides no graphic maps of Italy in the Italienische Reise, preferring mental maps such as the countdown of the lines of latitude analyzed above. In contrast, Brinkmann's text contains many pages with maps on them, most lined over with pencil to indicate routes that are never explained in the text. They represent lines of es- cape from the foregone conclusions imposed on the traveler by these maps. The effect is equivalent to the disjunctive leaps of Internet surfing. As Adler puts it, in Rom "[d]ocuments of history-such as the Roman forum-are for [the author] 'dead meanings' [toten Bedeutungen, p.56] 'rubbish' [Gertimpel, p. 58]-that is, prestructural material of perception that simultaneously im- poses on the perceiving subject, along with recognition of the parts, also the system within which they carry meaning."54 As Schl6sser points out, Brink- mann's use of the cut-up and his general preference for American literature and pop culture reflect his anxiety that the past is inescapable: "Die Beffirch- tung, da8 der Aufbruch umsonst gewesen sein kinnte, da3 keine Abwendung radikal genug sein kinnte, um dieser Vergangenheit zu entrinnen, geht auch in Brinkmanns Reisebeschreibung ein."55 Rom, Blicke, has with justice been called an "Anti-Goethe."56 Though the explicit references to Goethe are few (16, 34, 79, 115), they are pointed, as in the examples given above, and when Brinkmann turns the epigraph Goethe chose for his text on its head: "'Auch ich in Arkadien!' hat Gothe [sic]</page><page sequence="19">340 Thomas O. Beebee geschrieben, als er nach Italien fuhr. Inzwischen ist dieses Italien ganz sch6in runtergekommen und zu einer Art Vorhille geworden."57 Wolfgang Adam has analyzed the ways in which this direct allusion functions as a fulcrum for Brinkmann's "Destruktion des traditionellen Italien-Bildes." Adam traces the origins of the "Auch ich in Arkadien" quote from classical sources to the paint- ing of Nicholas Poussin, where it is spoken by Death and thus serves as a me- mento mori. Goethe's "uminterpretierende Ubersetzung" of the Latin saying as an epigraph emphasizes his experience of rebirth in Italy, while Brink- mann's recharacterization as a "Vorhi6lle" restores the idea of death, a death- in-life or a living hell.58 Brinkmann's other explicit mention shows the anx- iety of influence: "Man mtiBte es wie Goethe machen, der Idiot: alles undjedes gut finden / was der fuir eine permanente Selbsteigerung gemacht hat, ist un- glaublich, sobald man das italienische Tagebuch liest: jeden kleinen Katzen- schi8 bewundert der und bringt sich damit ins Gerede" (115). As with Nie- buhr and Tieck, Brinkmann's criticism does identify a crucial feature of the Italienische Reise. The later author degrades the high degree of reflexivity Goethe introduced into his travel account to a simple "sich ins Gerede brin- gen," as though this were simply a tic. Brinkmann identifies here his own method, with the affect reversed. For years the Italienische Reise maintained its difference from other Italian travel books through its relative lack of inter- est in the small details. An evaluation of Brinkmann's judgement would in- volve determining what counts as "cat-shit," and what plays a higher role. In Brinkmann's text, geographic movement reveals not the "new world" that Goethe delighted in, but a sickening sameness everywhere, as Europe dis- appears under the onslaught of mass culture. Borders between countries are exposed as phantasms: Ich fahre gegen die Grenze, als sei das eine korperliche Barriere-jaja, so ge- schickt waren die Saue der Menschen, daB sie imaginire Striche gezogen ha- ben und dann den Leuten eine Menge Begriffe in den Kopf gesetzt haben, die sich nun in ihnen stauen, daB sie Land, das einfach weitergeht, pl6tzlich mit- tels Wirtern und dahinter Interessen abgrenzen und man denkt: Die Grenze, jetzt kommt was Neues, das mich tiberwiltigt, haha, geschissen. Es geht bloB weiter. (164) What goes on and on are the processes of globalization and production of mass culture. Goethe elided the ideas of political boundaries in order to foreground the telluric differentiae that distinguish nations from each other. He thus shares with Brinkmann a tendency to regard borders as phantasms and to fa- vor cultural and geodetic differences as more meaningful. However, Brink- mann inverts Goethe's idea of the "ganz neues Land." Unlike Goethe, he re- marks on the passing of borders, the changing of money, the diet and the sleeping accomodations: the net result of these differences is, "es geht bloB weiter."</page><page sequence="20">Ways of Seeing Italy 341 Brinkmann explicitly examines and rejects Goethe's myth of "the South," formulated most coherently in the Italienische Reise: :WeiBt Du, warum ich weiter und immer nach Norden will? Weil da weniger Menschen sind. (Klingt bald so wie ein antiker Text.) :Einen "Stiden" gibts namlich gar nicht, auBer als geistig-verschwommene Vorstellung in den Zellen= ausbrtiten?, denn der ist der Aquator, da mochte ich nicht hin, wohl in den Norden, Nordpol. (187) Like Goethe, Brinkmann shows an interest in the numerical coordinates of his position. In place of the movement through different latitudes of the Ita- lienische Reise, however, these are stationary, and are part of a statistical analysis of the only place in his Italian journey that seemed to have pleased him a bit, the Olevano Romano, about fifty kilometers from Rome, where he spends Christmas and New Year's. The description--an excellent example of the "cut-up" style--shows not the uniqueness, antiquity, or isolation of the place, but its complete annexation into European history and politics: Der Ort liegt 41 Grad 51 Minuten 36 Sek. Breite, 34 Grad 48 Minuten Linge [...] stidliche Abweichung von Rom 1 Minute 8 Sekunden./Rome 54 Km ent- fernt. ...] 1944 sind hier deutsche SS-Soldaten herumgestiefelt, 1948, offen- sichtlich erste Wahl wieder, war die 1. Partei die Democrazia Cristiana mit der iiberwiltigenden Mehrheit von 2544 Stimmen, als zweite Partei die Kom- munistische mit 137 Stimmen, es gibt ein Bild, das den grinsenden Professor Heuss am 21.11.57 in diesem Ort zeigt neben einer Olga Baldi in localem Ko- sttim. (429) Theodor Heuss (1884-1963), was the first President of the Federal Republic of Germany after World War II. The allusion to the SS and to Heuss, together with the constant references to the German Romantic painters and writers- such as Ludwig Tieck--who have visited the Olevano Romano make it seem like a southern German health spa rather than part of a foreign country. No matter how far south Brinkmann travels, he cannot escape a Germanized land- scape. Brinkmann's cut-up is less a protest against globalization than a real- ization that it has been present forever, giving the lie to compartmentalized notions of national identity. The End of Landscape? Brinkmann's text represents the ultimate counter-narrative to the Italienische Reise because the whole of its "narrative" deconstructs the narrating self, which is, as we have seen in Goethe, also the perceiving self of landscape. Symptom or cause of this profound alteration in subjectivity is the inability of landscape to continue functioning as a totalizing vision. The gaze of the landlord or of the traveler has dissolved into a number of non-perspectival</page><page sequence="21">342 Thomas O. Beebee "-scapes." In Mike Featherstone's paraphrase of Arjun Appadurai's taxonomy, these new visions are as follows: Firstly, there are ethnoscapes produced by flows of people: tourists, immigrant, refugees, exiles and guest workers. Secondly, there are technoscapes, the ma- chinery and plant flows produced by multinational and national corporations and government agencies. Thirdly, there are finanscapes [sic] produced by the rapid flow of money in the currency markets and stock exchanges. Fourthly, there are mediascapes, the repertoire of images of information, the flows which are produced and distributed by newspapers, magazines, television and film. Fifthly, there are ideoscapes, linked to flows of images which are associated with state or counter-state movement ideologies which are comprised of ele- ments of freedom, welfare, rights, etc.60 If this parsing is correct, then by the end of the twentieth century the homog- enous space of nation had given way to other kinds of mental maps not de- pendent upon landmarks, natural features, or continguous space. Comparing Goethe's Italienische Reise with its reception and with its counter-narratives has revealed an intense struggle over the "proper" way of conceiving Italy and, by implication and in contrast, Germany. It has provided a small chapter in the "natural history" of ways of seeing landscape and nation, and of ways of con- structing the self at the focal point of these perspectives.

It is difficult to agree with Albert Meier's assessment that contrary to expectations, Goethe found Sicily to be an "Ort der Unbestandigkeit, des Zuftilligen und vor allem des Gewaltsamen" that contrasted with the aesthetic of vision and landscape I have been describing above.

Birbero's narrative participates in the extensive tradition of exchange of fictions between Italian and German authors, while rising above the clich6s of most products, just as Goethe's text transcends the travel narrative genre.
