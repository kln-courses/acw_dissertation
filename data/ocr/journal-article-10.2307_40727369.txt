Perhaps the most poignant scene of suffering in Confucius' s political life is the hardships he encountered in a place between the states Chen W and Cai Ü where, as legend has it, he and his followers did not have any grain to eat for several days. Whether or not this was a real historical event, it became a subject discussed by many ancient thinkers in the Mohist, Daoist as well as Confucian traditions. A notable fact is that the detail of that tragic episode is presented differently in each of these philosophical traditions. Why did the Chen-Cai story attract the attention of so many philosophers? Why are their accounts so different? Moreover, do these different versions convey any significance in understanding the history of Chinese philosophy? Jeffery Riegel has claimed that the Mohists and Daoists, who were hostile to Confucianism, took great liberties with the received tradition to create "a Confticius to serve as the butt of their criticisms."2 This point of view is acceptable as far as Daoism and Mohism are concerned; it soon becomes problematic when we take into consideration diverse versions of that story present in the Confucian tradition. 1 I would like to express my gratitude to the Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation for its financial sup- port and to Prof. Ku Mei-kao who generously mailed me a heavy copy of his valuable work on Lu Jia.

Investigating these solutions seems all the more important when we recall that Confucianism upholds a belief in moral re- wardism that regards suffering as a form of retribution. In light of this, how would the Confucians explain the affliction experienced by the Master between Chen and Cai? Was it also retributive? Of course not, but what then? To reject it as retributive, Confucian thinkers had to come up with other explanations that dealt with the problem of unmerited suffering. Therefore, different discussions by Confucians, Mohists, and Daoists on the Chen-Cai event reveal their understand- ing of and attitude towards the reality of suffering in general and the problem of undeserved suffering in particular. In what follows, I will investigate how pre- Buddhist philosophers in China addressed these problems. M ohist Interpretation Among major schools of thought in Eastern Zhou China (770-256 B.C.E.), only Confucianism and Mohism stood in relief as moralistic philosophies, and it is only in the two traditions that one finds the belief in moral rewardism. According to this notion, good conduct is rewarded just as evil conduct is punished by (a) supernatural power(s) either personal or quasi-personal. Generated by early Zhou rulers, this moral rewardism served as a political theory to legitimize the Zhou conquest of the Shang, but it was soon extended to apply to the life of individuals as an interpretation of their fortune and misfortune. Since both Confucianism and Mohism championed the force of a moralistic Heaven, it follows that both tradi- tions contained strong currents of moral rewardism. As is always the case with moralistic religions, the belief in moral rewardism inevitably gives rise to the problem of undeserved suffering. The problem is particularly expressed in the following passage of the Analects:3 In Chen when provisions ran out the followers had become so weak that none of them could rise to their feet.4 Zilu, with resentment written all over his face, said: "Are there times when even gentlemen are brought to such extreme straits?" The Master said, "It comes as no surprise to the gentleman to find himself in extreme straits (junzi guqiong fïTEIï?). The small man finding himself in extreme straits would throw over all restraint." While there is no doubt that the word qiong fif means "living in want," "in ex- treme straits," or "being blocked," and by extension, "suffering," the word gu H has been differently interpreted. Many take it to mean "yes, indeed," with ref- erence to Zilu's question. Some read it as being in the sense of "firm," meaning 3 D.C. Lau, The Analects (London 1979), p. 132 (15:2). 4 This passage mentions only the State of Chen rather than Chen and Cai. According to Cui Shu IEÌÈ, Confucius was travelling between the two sates and had no fixed place to stay. In each state, he suffered hunger. Cui Shu was cited by Cheng Shude íiUSfíÈ in Lunyujishi fÉiãíMS (Beijing 1990), p. 1051.</page><page sequence="3">CoNFUcius's Suffering in Chen-Cai 39 that the gentleman firmly endures hardships.5 Both positions would, however, agree with the following two implications that deserve special attention. First, it is obvious that Confucians regarded themselves as morally good, or "gentlemen," a term used in the Analects to refer to those who cultivated themselves morally in order to serve the society. Secondly, since they were morally good, they encoun- tered the problem of unmerited suffering as a corollary of moral rewardism. As E. Bruce Brooks and A. Taeko Brooks interpret, "There is always somebody who thinks that being good guarantees a good life. The real difference between the good people and the little people is how they take hardship. The little people lose their interest in good; the good stay firm."6 If we take, as did both traditional and modern scholars, this conversation as a record of a real event, the answer of Confucius would be the earliest Confucian response to the Chen-Cai suffering. Predating the Mohist and Daoist accounts of that event, the two messages conveyed by the passage outlined above must have caught the attention of the Mohists and Daoists, who then trumped up new ver- sions of that tragedy to voice their own views about suffering. I am of the opinion that the Mohists attacked the Confucian position of having claimed themselves to be "gentlemen" by roundly rejecting the "goodness" of Confucius, the sufferer, whereas the Daoists simply denied the existence of suffering by giving a new meaning to the word qiong, "being in extreme straits." In the Mozi Hi, the Chen-Cai story is told in a way considerably different from that of other sources:7 Once, when Confucius was in trouble between Cai and Chen, he lived for ten days on soups made of greens without any rice mixed in. His disciple Zilu boiled a pig for him, and Confucius ate the meat without asking where it had come from. Zilu also robbed someone of his robe and exchanged it for wine, and Confucius drank the wine without asking where it came from. But when he was received by Duke Ai of Lu, Confucius refused to sit down unless his mat was straight, and refused to eat unless the food was cut up properly. Zilu came forward and asked, "Why do you do the opposite of what you did when we were between Chen and Cai?" Con- fucius said, "Come here, and I will tell you. At that time we were intent upon staying alive. Now we are intent upon acting righteously." Thus when Confucius was starving and in trouble, he did not hesitate to grab at anything at all to keep himself alive, but when he was satiated he behaved hypocritically in order to ap- pear refined. What greater vileness and hypocrisy could there be? In this passage, Mozi did not deny the fact that Confucius suffered, but he por- trayed a selfish, hypocritical, and shameless Confucius. This depiction of Confu- cius serves not only as a butt of criticism but also as a possible interpretation of 5 Cheng Shude, Lunyu jishi, p. 1055; James Legge, The Chinese Classics.

Since Mozi was a staunch believer and vehement ad- vocator of an intending Heaven who was always swift to reward and damn hu- mans, it is quite possible that from Mozi' s point of view Confucius' s suffering was nothing more than a divine punishment for his immoral character and behav- ior. This point is made stronger when one pays attention to two other passages in the Mozi where the Master spoke of suffering in retributive terms. In both cases Mozi was asked the question concerning the suffering by those who had followed Mozi' s teaching to do good. In defending the validity of the doctrine of moral rewardism, Mozi pointed out, by way of nitpicking, the overlooked sinful inten- tion and deportment on the part of the sufferer.8 It is interesting that when Mozi himself was struck by a disease, a pronounced manifestation of divine punishment for evil conduct, according to his own teachings, retributive theory was com- pletely cast aside. Instead, he explained: There are many ways that men become ill. Some are due to cold or heated weath- er, and some due to physical exhaustion from hard work. It is just like shutting only one door of a one-hundred-door-house. How can one be sure that robbers will have no access to it?9 Why did the Mozi not speak of the Master's suffering in retributive terms? The answer is simple: he was a sage, and as such, was morally perfect and could not have done anything against Heaven's will. It is exactly for the same reason that Confucians adopted the retributive doctrine to explain misfortune of wicked indi- viduals, especially those who were notorious in history, but when it came to the thorny problem of Confucius' s suffering, they all turned to other interpretations. In spite of tangible differences in ideology between Confucianism and Mohism, their approach to the problem of suffering remains similar. Mohists, who were anti-Confucian, opportunistically resorted to depicting an immoral Confucius as a means of explaining this instance of seemingly unmerited suffering. From the Confucian point of view, however, the Chen-Cai suffering had noth- ing to do with Confucius' s personal character. In the biography of Confucius composed by Sima Qian ñ]^JS (145-86 B.C.E.) in his Shiji ¿12, for instance, it is said that Confucius individually summoned three of his disciples, namely, Zi- to "?!&amp;&gt; Zigong ^Jf, and Yan Hui ||[§I, to explain why they were distressed in Chen and Cai. Zilu's reply is that it was perhaps due to their lack of benevolence and wisdom that they failed in winning the trust of others, which reflects Mozi' s argument. Zigong's opinion is just the opposite. With the reasoning that Confu- cius' s teaching was too profound for the world to follow, Zigong suggested that it should be made simpler. Neither was accepted by the Master. Then came Yan Hui' s response. Subscribing to Zigong's reasoning but rejecting his suggestion, Yan Hui said, 8 Wu Yujiang, Mozi jiaozhu, "Gongmeng," p. 707; "Lu wen," pp. 737-738. For a discussion of these passages, see Chen Ning, "The Problem of Theodicy in Ancient China," in: Journal of Chinese Relisions 22 (1994), pp. 59-60. 9 Wu Yujiang, Mozi jiaozhu, "Gongmeng," p. 707.</page><page sequence="5">Confucius ' s Suffering in Chen-C ai 4 1 Your teaching, Master, is so profound that the world can hardly follow it. But all the same, you should continue to extend and carry it out. What does it matter if a gentleman is isolated by the world? Only in isolation does he distinguish himself. Yes, the fault is ours if we do not cultivate our doctrine. But if we do, and cannot get it accepted, that is the shame of the rulers. Yan Hui's answer, though not so much an explanation of the reason of suffering as an attitude towards it, echoing Confucius' s statement in the Analects, secured the Master's support.10 To Confucians, nothing could be more exasperating than the Mohist iconoclas- tic slander of Confucius; moreover, the flimsy inner logic with which Mozi fabri- cated the Chen-Cai story is too apparent to be neglected. For instance, the author of the Kong congzi ÎLUT, a work believed to have been compiled by Wang Su 3:j|î in the third century,11 points out an apparent contradiction in Mozi's ac- count. Namely, Mozi's admission of Confticius's hunger belies the author's entry about eating pork and drinking wine. In his words, This case of straitened circumstances refers to a time when there was no place to purchase food; they lived on pigweed soup without any grain mixed in it, and this food shortage lasted for seven days. Now, if a pig was boiled and wine was drunk there, in what kind of "straitened circumstances" were they? Hence, what he (Mo- zi) said was untrue.12 Daoist Interpretation Another ideological rival of the Confucian school, Zhuangzi ^±T and his Daoist school, often attacked Confucianism. Yet, in their writings Confucius did not al- ways serve as the butt of their criticism. As A.C. Graham points out, "Early Taoists (Daoist) stories sometimes make fun of Confucius, sometimes claim him as an ally."13 In the Zhuangzi, there are two occurrences of the Chen-Cai story, one in the "Outer Chapters," and the other in the "Miscellaneous Chapters," re- vealing two Daoist propositions. In one of the "Outer Chapters," the Daoists derided Confticius's obstinate ef- fort to practice the useless, outdated, and forsaken ways of the ancient Zhou Dy- nasty. Claiming that whoever tried to make such futile effort would be put in danger, they attributed the source of Confticius's suffering including the hunger in Chen-Cai to his own intention and action. This is disclosed in the following passage: Nothing is as good as a boat for crossing water, nothing as good as a cart for crossing land. But though a boat will get you over water, if you try to push it 10 Sima Qian f]IS, Shiji £gß (Beijing 1982), chap. 47, pp. 1930-1931. 11 Yoav Ariel, K'ung-ts'ung-tzu.

And are the past and present not like the water and the land, and the states of Zhou and Lu not like a boat and a cart? To hope to practice the ways of Zhou in the state of Lu is like trying to push a boat over land - a great deal of work, no success, and certain danger to the person who tries it.14 The second discussion that calls for special comment is a portrait of an en- lightened Confucius who served as a mouthpiece of the Daoist understanding of suffering. Centered on a redefinition of the often used word qiong "being blocked," "being in distress," "in poverty," or "suffering," the Daoist discussion attempts to establish one's correct and optimistic attitude toward one's life, how- ever difficult it may be. It is said that when Confucius was in distress between Chen and Cai, he sat in his room playing the lute and singing, which confused his disciples who followed him in the journey. Realizing that his followers could not understand his peculiar attitude, Confucius called them in. After having centered the room with others, Zilu said to Confucius: "I guess you could say that all of us are really blocked in (qiong) this time." Confucius replied, What kind of talk is that! When the gentleman gets through to the Way, this is called "getting through." When he is blocked off from the Way, this is called "be- ing blocked." Now I embrace the way of benevolence and righteousness, and with it encounter the perils of an age of disorder. Where is there any "being blocked" about this? So I examine what is within me and am never blocked off from the Way. I face the difficulties ahead and do not lose its Virtue. When the cold days come and the frost and snow have fallen, then I understand how the pine and the cypress flourish. The distress (ai g)15 here in Chen and Cai is a blessing to me! The men of ancient times who had attained the Way were happy if they were blocked in, and happy if they could get through. It was not the fact they were blocked or not that made them happy. As long as you have really gotten hold of the Way, then being blocked or getting through are no more than the orderly alter- nation of cold and heat, of wind and rain.16 Unlike the discussion in the "Outer Chapters" where the Daoists emphasized the various "difficulties" (qiong) Confucians encountered in their wanderings, includ- ing the suffering between Chen and Cai so as to demonstrate the futility of Con- fucianism, the gist of this conversation is whether the Confucians were really in distress. Zilu's words represent what common people thought of as suffering, which is rejected by the Daoist Confucius as incorrect. From the Daoist perspec- tive, external circumstances that bring about poverty, hunger, homelessness, dan- 14 Guo Qingfan ÎBJSiS, Zhuangzi jishi ÍEíltS (Beijing 1982), pp. 511-513.

They do not necessarily make one suffer. Though straitened circumstances do occur from time to time, they are only a precondition leading to suffering and no more. If one takes them seriously with the attempt to avoid them and to have something better, one is suffering, indeed. Only by recognizing them as an inseparable part of the natural world and acting spontaneously and purposelessly can one be free of any suffering. A man who has achieved such status is a man who is following the Way. Demonstrating equanimity towards life, and accepting whatever happens to him, he is always happy. In a nutshell, for the Daoist, suffering is derived from anxiety and frustration, and hence, it is only a subjective matter. More light can be shed on the Daoist understanding of suffering by comparing and contrasting it with a widely accepted modern definition of suffering and pain. According to Jack Bemporad, "Suffering may be defined as the experience of organism in situations that involve physical and mental pain, usually attended by a sense of loss, frustration, and vulnerability to adverse effect." And pain "is in- extricably linked with the sense of one's individuality. As such, pain can only be defined subjectively."17 Regarding the physical aspect of pain as unharmful or at least trivial, the Daoists only recognize psychological disorder as suffering. How- ever, it should be noted that this Daoist psychological pattern of suffering has nothing to do with the sense of loss resulting from various physical hardships. It is stringently cognitive. One genuinely suffers only when one is at a loss to un- derstand the underlying causes of the difficult circumstances. Our next question concerns the last sentence stated by the Daoist Confucius in the passage cited above that "The distress here in Chen and Cai is a blessing to me!" In what sense can distress be viewed as blessing? According to Cheng Xuan- ying /&amp;^^ (fl. 631), an important Tang annotator of the Zhuangzi, "[t]hat Con- fucius manifested his virtue in times of distress and difficulty can be said to be a blessing."18 This interpretation does not shed much light on the meaning of that statement, for one still cannot perceive a tangible connection between suffering and blessing. A possible interpretation could be that it was during the adverse journey between Chen and Cai that the mind of the Daoist Confucius became im- pervious to all these external difficulties, an indication that he had been in line with the Way. Hence, serving as a piece of evidence that Confucius was com- pletely free from any suffering, the Chen-Cai distress was a blessing for him. This interpretation can be substantiated by a reading of the same passage but with more information that appears in the Lüshi chunqiu Sft##l. As a reposi- tory of thought and knowledge of late Zhou Dynasty, the Lüshi chunqiu contains various major teachings from the schools of Confucianism, Daoism, and Legal- 17 Jack Bemporad, "Suffering," in: Mircea Eliade (ed.), Encyclopedia of Religion. Vol. 14 (New York 1987), p. 99. 18 See Guo Qingfan, Zhuangzi jishi, p. 982.</page><page sequence="8">44 Chen Ning ism. The Chen-Cai passage is derived from the Zhuangzi. The context of the statement at issue reads, In the past Duke Huan (of Qi) attained it (the Way) in Ju, Duke Wen (of Jin) at- tained it in Cao, and the King of Yue attained it at Guiji. The distress between Chen and Cai is a blessing to me!19 In this sentence the meaning of the pronoun "it" has been interpreted by tradi- tional scholars as the ambition to become a lord protector on the ground that it was used in that sense in the same passage that appears in the Xunzi ^T and Kongzi jiayu ilTWM.™ However, the word lord protector is not mentioned in the Liishi chunqiu passage, and here it would be inappropriate to have relied on Confucian works in searching for the meaning of a Daoist argument, for their views on suffering may not be the same. Placing "it" in its context, the pronoun most likely refers to the Way. With this interpretation it becomes clear that like the three prominent historical figures who attained the Way while in straitened circumstances and eventually became successful rulers, Confucius came to the understanding of the Way between Chen and Cai and hoped that his day would come sometime in the future, too. Thus interpreted, one more problem remains unsolved. We are unable to de- cide whether the three incidents cited in the Liishi chunqiu as context for the Con- fucian statement existed in the original Zhuangzi. It is possible that they were there originally and when the Liishi chunqiu was produced, its authors copied that part verbatim. It was only in later times that they were somehow missing from the Zhuangzi text. Equally possible is that the original Zhuangzi did not have the three incidents, and it was the authors oí Liishi chunqiu who interpolated them in their work so as to render the meaning of the succeeding Confucian statement more manifest. Since this interpolation did make sense, some later versions of the Zhuangzi adopted it.21 In each case however, the Daoists held that it was the suf- fering between Chen and Cai that enlightened the Daoist Confucius. Confucian Interpretation I Thus far we have seen the Mohist and Daoist accounts of the Chen-Cai story. Neither agreed with Confucius' s brief comment on suffering that "It comes as no surprise to the gentleman to find himself in extreme straits." From the Mohist perspective, Confucius was far from being a "gentleman," and for the Daoists, the concept of "extreme straits" was only a product of men's misled subjective activities. What then of other Confucians? As revealed in the Analects, Confu- cius's answer to Zilu's question deals with practical responses to the reality of suffering rather than its ultimate source and theoretical solutions. Likewise, Men- cius's account for the same story has nothing to do with the ultimate source as he 19 Chen Qiyou PÄ^fc, Lüshi chunqiu jiaoshi g ft#Afë§ (Shanghai 1984), p. 804. 20 Ibid., p. 812, n. 54. 21 For example, the Guzang ¿"Ä edition has them. See Guo Qingfan, Zhuangzi jishi, p. 982.</page><page sequence="9">Confucius 's Suffering in Chen-Cai 45 said, "That the gentleman was in difficulties in the region of Chen and Cai was because he had no friends at court."22 But it does not mean that other Confucians had no interests in tracing the origin of suffering. On the contrary, preoccupation with external or ultimate factors can be found in a number of pre-Buddhist Con- fucian works. In the "Youzuo" ^f¿£ chapter (composed by Xunzi's disciples) of the Xunzi, reasons for suffering in general and for the Chen-Cai distress in particular are discussed in a lengthy passage including two assumed responses of Confucius to Zilu's question and an editorial remark.23 ... Zilu stepped forward and asked: "According to what I have been taught, Heaven bestows good fortune on those who do good and disasters on those who do what is not good. Now you, our Master, have for a long time augmented your in- ner power through your daily conduct, accumulated acts of moral good, and cher- ished the beautiful. Why, then, do you live in obscurity?" Confucius replied: "You (Zilu's style name), you do not understand, and let me ex- plain it to you. Did you imagine that the wise are certain to be employed? But did not Prince Bigan have his heart cut out! ... From this it can be seen that those who have not met with the right time are legion. How am I unique in this regard?" Whether one meets with opportunity depends on the time; whether one becomes worthy depends on innate ability. Gentlemen of broad learning and profound plans who did not meet with the right time are numerous. ... The studies of the gentle- man are not undertaken in order to be successful, but so that in poverty he will not be beset with hardship, that in times of anxiety his sense of purpose will not dimin- ish, and that by knowing the factors for and consequences of fortune and misfor- tune, his heart will not suffer illusions. ... Just as whether one meets with success depends on the right time, so too matters of death and life depend on fate. Now if a man has not met with the right time, even though he is worthy, how would he be able to put [his ideas] into practice? ... Thus, the gentleman broadens his studies, deepens his plans, reforms his person, and corrects his conduct in order to await his right time. Confucius said: "... In the past Chonger, the son of the duke of Jin, conceived his ambition to become lord-protector because of the events in Cao. King Goujian of Yue conceived his ambition to become lord protector because of the events at Guiji. Xiaobo, the future Duke Huan of Qi, conceived his ambition to become lord protector because of the events at Ju. One who does not live in obscurity does not reflect on distant prospects; one who does not endure personal hardship does not have goals with wide aims. In what way do you know that I will not become suc- cessful from here by the Sangluo?"24 As a typical example of the problem of unmerited suffering generated by the doc- trine of moral rewardism, Zilu's question requires an answer to such a problem 22 D .

Translation is slightly different. 24 The term sangluo Ufé- rejects any precise interpretation. Whether it refers to the name of the place where Confucius made his statement or the season in which he was travelling between Chen and Cai, it would not be unreasonable to construe it as a witness of his suffering.</page><page sequence="10">46 Chen Ning with regard to the validity of that doctrine. In Confucius' s reply, the moral and intending Heaven is not mentioned. Instead, it is the working of time that deter- mines the success and failure of a person's political career, and it is fate that re- gulates a person's life span. Since time and fate are impersonal and self-moved cosmic forces, as the Chinese believed, they operate without any reference to a person's character and conduct. That is why there are moral people who suffer. The theme of time to explain undeserved suffering is also repeated in Xunzi's "Drastic Ode."25 To resort to the concept of impersonal forces to tackle the gravest problem of undeserved suffering is not unique to Confucianism, for it was one of the earliest solutions in ancient China.26 However, there are several points in the above-cited passage that need further discussion. First of all, in spite of the fact that in ex- plaining men's fortune and misfortune, the concepts of time and fate markedly run contrary to the doctrine of moral rewardism, they were adopted by Confu- cians not to forsake that doctrine but to sustain the faith in its validity. This is well illustrated by the "Rhapsody Chapter" of the Xunzi in which Xunzi, having similarly attributed the adversity of Bigan and Confucius to the working of time, wrote,27 That before a thousand years have passed things undergo reversal Has been the constant rule from antiquity. Students! Devote yourselves to study, For Heaven will not forget you. According to Yang Liang HßjC, a Tang annotator of the Xunzi, these lines were to strengthen the faith in moral rewardism in the face of injustice. He wrote, "Fear- ing that his disciples were suspicious that doing good was of no advantage and would thus become indolent and self-indulgent, Xunzi urges them on, which is why he says that Heaven 'will not forget you.'"28 If Yang Liang's interpretation is correct, then Xunzi is found to have embraced two mutually contradictory theories: moral rewardism and unalterable fate/time. Mentioning by pass, al- though the phenomenon of upholding the two believes can be found in some pre- Qin Confucian writings, the discrepancy was not openly criticized by Chinese thinkers until the first century when Wang Chong iEjfë (27-79) composed his renowned Lun heng frais.29 25 For a thorough study of the "Drastic Ode," see David Pankenier, "The Scholar's Frustration Reconsidered: Melancholia or Credo?" in: Journal of the American Oriental Society 110 (1990) 3, pp. 437-442. 26 Chen Ning, "The Genesis of the Concept of Blind Fate in Ancient China," in: Journal of Chi- nese Religions 25 (1997), pp. 141-167. 27 Wang Xianqian, Xunzi jijie, p. 482; Knoblock, Xunzi, Vol. Ill, p. 203 (26.6). 28 Wang Xianqian, Xunzi jijie, p. 482; Knoblock, Xunzi, Vol. Ill, p. 359, n. 31. 29 In his Lun heng, Wang Chong discussed three types of destiny held by Han Confucians. His definitions of "concomitant destiny" and "adverse destiny" are identical to moral rewardism and the amoral time/fate doctrine respectively. Having defined the notions, he wrote, "Con- comitant destiny excludes adverse destiny, and adverse destiny, a concomitant one. On what ba-</page><page sequence="11">Confucius 's Suffering in Chen-Cai 47 Secondly, in the assumed editorial remark between the two claims of Confu- cius, emphasis is placed on the importance of gentlemen's studies. In Confucian- ism learning is always emphasized as a way of self-cultivation in order to serve society, but here in this passage it is assigned a psychological function: to free one from bewilderment and frustration caused by iniquities and hardships. This constitutes an ideal illustration in Chinese tradition of what cultural anthropolo- gists have said of the function of religions, that is, to establish meanings by offer- ing explanations of events that beset humankind. That the ultimate purpose of learning shifted from the achievement of social harmony to individual psycho- logical freedom strongly indicates the extent to which the Confucians were eager to find a solution to the problem of unmerited suffering. A third point that is implied in the second statement by Confucius, and in the "Rhapsody" as well, is the idea that misfortune could be followed by good for- tune. It is only natural that the belief in the working of time to be the ultimate source for suffering eventually leads to a faith in a bright future on the part of the sufferer. Suffering does not last forever and hardships are often followed by hap- piness. Just as it is time that brings about the alternation of day and night, waxing and waning of the moon, blooming and withering of plants, summer heat and winter coldness observed in the natural world, so it is time that will replace mis- fortune with fortune for humankind. That is to say, the concept of time can serve as a psychological tranquilizer, paring down anxiety and bringing hope for those in distress. Therefore, with the reference to the historical cases where worthy individuals found themselves reduced to distress but eventually came to power, Confucius predicted that some day he could achieve the same political success, as the concluding sentence of that passage indicates. By all accounts, however, the Chen-Cai iniquities did not lead to any political achievement for Confucius thereafter and he never became a ruler himself able to put his teaching into practice. His inaccurate prediction given in that passage would render him less able to know about the future and the world, an ability that was assigned to sages by late Zhou and early Han Confucians. Given this, one may ask: Why did the Confucian authors of that passage make such a wrong pre- diction through Confucius' s mouth? One possible answer would be that they were less disposed to portray Confucius as the greatest sage than to place a premium on the importance of waiting for one's time and to bring hopes to those in the face of difficulties, including themselves, perhaps. Confucian Interpretation II Within the Confucian tradition, there are several different versions of the Chen- Cai event, especially found in Han literature. In the Shuo yuan Wltfi composed by Liu Xiang gij|p] (77-6 B.C.E.), there are two passages dealing with that event. sis can the scholastic distinction of three kinds of destiny then be established?"

It is said that suffering hunger between Chen and Cai, Confucius filled the days with music, which upset Zilu. Hard pressed for an explanation, he asked the Master if it was an appropriate time for playing music. Confticius be- gan his answer with the stories of Duke Huan of Qi, Duke Wen of Jin, and King Guojian of Yue who rose to power from obscurity, and then he continued, "In light of this, without having lived in obscurity one cannot reflect on distant prospects; without having endured hardships, one cannot develop profound wis- dom. In what way do you know that you will not rise to power from here in dis- tress?" The following day as they were out of the extreme straits, Zigong started driving the cart and said, "Gentlemen, do not forget that it is because we followed our Master that we encountered the hardships." Confucius said, "What kind of comment is that? Isn't it said that 'Breaking arms three times makes one a good physician'? In that sense the distress between Chen and Cai is a blessing to me; and you, gentlemen, who followed me here are all lucky men. Moreover, I heard that 'A [potential] ruler cannot become a ruler with- out having gone through hardships; a [potentially] distinguished man cannot estab- lish his distinguished character without having been distressed.' Remember, in the past Tang was distressed in Lu, King Wen at Youli, Duke Mu of Qin at Yao, Duke Huan of Qi at Changshao, Goujian at Guiji, and Duke Wen of Jin was dis- tressed by Lady Li. The ebb and flow of distress is comparable to the pattern of seasons: from coldness comes warmth and from warmth comes coldness. Thus only the worthy are able to understand but hard to explain.31 In the Confucian tradition, praise and honor are always heaped upon Yan Hui, an exemplary man of perfect virtue, whereas arrogance and selfishness are often as- sociated with Zilu and Zigong. The words of Zigong in this passage that show regret at having followed Confucius might be made up by Liu Xiang to usher in his pedagogical interpretation of suffering through the mouth of Confucius. Stress then is placed upon the importance of encountering and enduring suffering. Suf- fering can produce men of broadened views, deepened thought, and distinguished character, which are the qualities requisite for leadership. There is no doubt that this theme owes its origin to the Mencian comment on those who rose from extremely difficult circumstances that suffering is critical to the training of leadership.32 Our concern is whether Liu construes, as does Men- cius, Heaven as the ultimate source of suffering. It should be noted that the Men- cian explanation of suffering, as one of the fundamental attitudes towards suffer- ing in early Confucianism, has caught the attention of several modern scholars, 30 Liu Xiang gijfä, Shuoyuan WLÏÏL (Shanghai 1990), chap. 17, "Zayan," p. 144/a-b. 31 Ibid., pp. 143/b-144/a. 32 Lau, Mencius, p. 181 (6:B15).</page><page sequence="13">CoNFUCius's Suffering in Chen-Cai 49 who categorized it as pedagogical.33 In what they disagree on, however, is Heav- en's attributes depicted by Mencius in the words "Heaven, when it is about to place a great burden upon a man, always first tests his resolution, exhausts his frame and makes him suffer starvation and hardship, frustrates his efforts... ,"34 For Tu Wei-ming, the idea of a willful Heaven "is quite foreign to the Mencian intention."35 But from the perspective of Rodney Taylor, "Tu may be too ready to dismiss the role of Heaven as an acting and intending high god."36 It seems that Taylor is right, for the Heaven that transforms a humble man into a capable ruler by making him suffer must be willful, or at least semi-anthropomorphic. In light of this, it can be claimed that Mencius traces the reality of suffering to a moral and approachable Heaven, the same Heaven often depicted in moral re- wardism. What then of Liu Xiang? It is difficult to decide. In the passage cited above, he does not make any reference to Heaven, but elsewhere in his Shuo yuan an expression reminiscent of the Mencian one is found. It reads, "When Heaven is about to reward a man, it always first makes him suffer; when Heaven is about to destroy a man, it always first helps him succeed."37 Apparently, Heaven is held responsible for the reality of suffering encountered by the good; yet it is a worth- while suffering, for on its heels something good will follow. This, nevertheless, does not behoove one to claim that Liu Xiang particularly construes Confucius' s suffering between Chen and Cai as part of Heaven's training plan, simply be- cause the two passages are separately presented in his Shuo yuan. What can be said is no more than a possibility that he does. Whether Heaven is thought to have been involved, one thing is for sure: suffering of this type can take on a character of joy, for the harder the suffering, the better the chance one will have to become successful in the end. Confucian Interpretation III In the Analects, there is a unique account for the unemployment of Confucius known as the "wooden bell" metaphor. It was expressed by an official in the state of Wei who made a comment on Confucius' s loss of office in the state of Lu in the words "What worry have you, gentlemen, about the loss of office? The Em- pire has long been without the Way. Heaven is about to use your Master as the wooden tongue for a bell."38 The "wooden bell" refers to an instrument whereby government officials summoned the people to an important message. A possible 33 See for instance, Rodney Leon Taylor, The Religious Dimensions of Confucianism (Albany, N.Y. 1990), pp. 122-123; Tu Wei-ming, "Pain and Suffering in Confucian Self-Cultivation," in: Philosophy East and West 14 (1984) 4, pp. 379-380. 34 Lau, Mencius, p. 181 (6:B15). 35 Tu Wei-ming, "Pain and Suffering in Confucian Self-Cultivation, " p. 380. 36 Taylor, The Religious Dimensions of Confucianism, p. 123. 37 Liu Xiang, Shuo yuan, chap. 16, "Shuo cong," p. 133/b. 38 Lau, The Analects, p. 71 (3:24).</page><page sequence="14">50 Chen Ning meaning of the metaphor is that for Heaven, it is more important to spread Con- fucius's teachings than to put him in government, because, as Robert Eno inter- prets, it could contribute more to Heaven's teleological plan for a just future than his political success would have.39 That being so, Confucius' s political career was sacrificed for a more important mission that breaks the time and space limit. Had he succeeded in keeping an office in the state of Lu, the benefit that his policies could have brought about would have been restricted to that small state within the term of his service. By spreading his teachings, however, the entire Empire would greatly benefit for many generations to come. Moreover, Confucius's suf- fering, which is understood as part of Heaven's plan, is critical to the spread of his teachings. According to Eno, "It is precisely through political failure that Confucius is able to serve as Heaven's agent."40 As a powerful explanation of Confucius's political failure, this "wooden bell" theory developed into the concept of "king without a throne" (suwang jRïE), a title designated exclusively to Confucius in Han times. Though not necessarily understood as Heaven's plan, the role of the "king without a throne" was de- picted by Han Confucians as providing perpetual ideological leadership to guide the Empire to prosperity and harmony. Thus, the fundamental task, to which Confucius began to devote himself in the wake of his unemployment, was putting forward the guiding principles by producing Confucian classics. In light of this, an essential change in his life was made from seeking a state ruler who would hire him to bequeathing the world a set of guiding principles through the means of the brush pen. The results were the "six classics," namely, the Poetry, the Documents, the Rites, the Music, the Changes, and the Spring and Autumn An- nals. Of this shift in orientation, Liu Xiang wrote that after Confucius failed in gaining an office, "he gave it up and began to produce the Spring and Autumn Annals in order to manifest the Way of the king without a throne and to pass it on to later generations."41 Since Confucius's political failure culminated in the Chen-Cai event, a num- ber of Han Confucians directly linked it to the formation of Confucian written tradition. In Sima Qian's words, "Confucius, due to the distress between Chen and Cai, produced the Spring and Autumn Annals"*1 And Lu Jia Hi If (fl. 200- 179 B.C.E.) wrote, When Master Kong was in peril on his journey from the state of Chen to the state of Cai, he had only beans and vegetable soup for food, which were not enough to keep him from hunger. ... He traveled around the world and could not get a ruler who agreed with his opinions. So the great Way was neglected and not practiced. ... He traced and studied the events of the past to correct those of the future, he 39 Robert Eno, The Confucian Creation of Heaven.

He standardized and edited the six classics so as to place emphasis on the teachings of Confucianism. ... And the Poetry, the Docu- ments, the Rites and the Music, each had its proper position. All these are estab- lished by the Way of Heaven, and put into practice by great righteousness.43 With the connection between the Chen-Cai adversity and the production of the Confucian classics, Confticius's suffering came to be associated with an evidently positive side. It became a foundation of better things collectively rather than indi- vidually. Whether it had to do with Heaven's teleological plan, the Chen-Cai tragedy was viewed as a decisive contribution to the passing down of Confucian- ism. The Empire should feel lucky that Confucius had suffered, otherwise it would not have been able to receive the gift of Confucian ideological leadership. On the other hand, this benefit was great enough to compensate for the Chen-Cai suffering. Given that the ultimate goal of the production of the Confucian classics was to save the world from all ills, the Chen-Cai distress could also take on a redemptive character. Of course, only Confucians held such a view, and the Daoists evidently thought otherwise. They argued that now that Confucius was unable even to pre- vent himself from suffering political failure, how could his teachings solve the ills of the world and save the people from suffering? In the Liezi ^'JT, for example, there is passage in the form of a conversation between Confucius who represents Daoist proposition and Yan Hui depicted as an orthodox Confucian. The gist of that passage is that all moral effort of humankind to shape the future is unavailing at both individual and communal levels, and it is the force of fate that controls everything. We are told that Confucius was out of office and looked careworn. Yan Hui tried to cheer him up by mentioning the Master's own teaching that those who understood the working of fate could be free of care. With the inten- tion to correct this teaching by a new perspective, the Daoist Confucius ex- plained,44 The training of your personal character, indifferent to failure and success; aware- ness that the events which have happened and will happen to you do not depend on yourself, and should not disturb your thoughts; this is what you understand by the carelessness of rejoicing in heaven and knowing destiny. But not long ago, when I edited the Poetry and the Documents, and corrected the Rites and the Music, my aim was to restore order to the Empire and bequeath this order to future genera- tions; it was not merely to train my personal character and order my own state of Lu. Yet the ministers of Lu daily usurped more of their prince's power, morals steadily deteriorated, the good inclinations in man's nature grew weaker and weaker.

I knew for the first time that the Poetry, the Documents, the Rites and the Music, are of no help in restoring or- der; but still I did not know any method to replace them. This is what the man who rejoices in heaven and knows destiny has to care about. Conclusion The human effort to understand and explain the reality of suffering is universal, as David Little claims: "We could not imagine any of the world's religions with- out their preoccupation with the causes of and treatment for affliction, sickness, injury, deprivation, distress, and death."45 However, the Chinese understanding of suffering has not received the ftill attention of modern scholars.46 In this re- gard, the legendary Chen-Cai tragedy provides an ideal case where Confucius' s suffering is explained by different thinkers from three major schools of thought in early China. More or less, they presented not only accounts of Confucius' s unde- served suffering, but also their solutions to the problem of suffering in general. Besides, some of their discussions were not isolated expressions; rather, they were responses of one school to other schools, indicating that the discussion of the reality of suffering was a never-ending issue in ancient China. The Mohist approach is essentially an effort to sustain the religious faith in moral rewardism by exposing the sufferer's paucity of moral values. Hence, Con- fticius was described as a shameless hypocrite. The Daoist proposition is merely a denial to the reality of suffering by giving a new definition to that word. Constru- ing psychological anxiety alone as suffering, the Daoists claimed that nothing could make a man suffer so long as he was able to set his mind free from external circumstances. In full recognition of the fact that there were good people who did suffer but reluctant to apply the retributive theory to such cases, Confiician phi- losophers leaned heavily towards the notions of time/fate, pedagogy and contribu- tion to the spread of Confucianism. By recognizing the workings of such impersonal and amoral forces as time and fate, Confucians were able to demolish the link between one's suffering and one's conduct, a correlative characteristic of the doctrine of moral rewardism. It should be noted however, that the adoption of the notion of time and fate to ex- plain suffering was by no means to discard moral rewardism from Confucianism. Rather, the two notions were used to explain two different types of suffering: suf- 45 David Little, "Human Suffering in Comparative Perspective," in: Rodney L. Taylor - Jean Watson (eds.), They Shall Not Hurt. Human Suffering and Human Caring (Boulder, Colo. 1989), p. 53. 46 To the best knowledge of mine, so far only a handful of articles dealing with that subject have been published. Even for some scholars, ancient Chinese philosophers were not interested in addressing that subject. For example, Julia Ching claimed that the problem of evil in Confucian- ism refers less to the evils connected with human suffering than "to the problem of evil in the human heart." See Julia Ching, Confucianism and Christianity. A Comparative Study (Tokyo 1977), p. 73. And A.C. Graham even said, "Suffering does not preoccupy Chuang-tzu, or any other pre-Buddhist thinker in China" {Disputers of the Tao. Philosophical Argument in Ancient China [La Salle, 111. 1989], p. 202).</page><page sequence="17">Confucius 's Suffering in Chen-Cai 53 fering by the morally good and suffering by the wicked. Rarely to be seen in pre- Buddhist Confucian writings is the application of the doctrine of fate/time to cases where wrongdoers suffered. And it is not unusual that throughout Confucian his- tory both the doctrine of fate and moral rewardism were upheld by one and the same person. The Confucian educational theme of suffering directs one's attention to the constructive consequences of suffering. By enduring suffering, it claims, a man is able to widen his views, deepen his reflection, and enrich his wisdom. Such a theme is similar to its Christian counterpart that in Paul's words reads, "Suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope" (Romans 5:3-4). A unique feature in the Confucian perspective, however, is that it underlines the importance and necessity of undergoing hardships for those who are to become governmental rulers. In Mencius's discussion the indi- viduals in distress were all future ministers, and Liu Xiang's illustrations were exclusively state sovereigns-to-be. Perhaps this shows that Confucianism is more political than religious in orientation. Particularly applied to Confucius, the logic of the contributive theory runs like the following. Confucius' s suffering was associated with his pursuit of a political career. He suffered because no state ruler would hire him and use his teaching. As he failed and encountered hardships, he devoted himself to a mission that was more important in temporal and spatial senses. Whether or not the change was taken as Heaven's decree, it was precisely out of suffering that he began to ad- dress himself to the task of leaving behind a set of moral principles that would guide the Empire toward achieving harmony and prosperity. With the exception of the Mohist view, all these interpretations construed suffering as worthwhile and necessary. Suffering leads to success and happiness one way or another, and the harder it strikes one, the better the chance it provides to the sufferer to attain happiness. This is expressed particularly in the words that "The distress here in Chen and Cai is a blessing to me" by the Zhuangzi, that "In what way do you know that I will not become successful from here by the Sang- luo" by the Xunzi, and that "The distress between Chen and Cai is a blessing to me, and you, gentlemen, who followed me here are all lucky men" by the Shuo yuan; not to mention the contributive theory that treats Confucius' s suffering as a lasting blessing to the world. Though each of these views has its own reasons to be optimistic, together they contributed to the formation of the Chinese belief that "Out of the depth of misfortune comes bliss" (piji tailai ï5ÎÉ#2l$), a psycho- logical painkiller for those in distress. Moreover, this optimistic view is precisely what Clifford Geertz has said of religious response to suffering. He wrote, As a religious problem, the problem of suffering is, paradoxically, not how to avoid suffering, but how to suffer, how to make of physical pain, personal loss, worldly defeat, or the helpless contemplation of other's agony something bearable, supportable - something, as we say, sufferable.47 47 Clifford Geertz, The Interpretation of Cultures.
