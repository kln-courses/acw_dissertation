Wilhelm Jerusalem's "sociology of cognition" in context Thomas Uebel Published online: 23 February 2012 © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012 Abstract This paper considers the charge that - contrary to the current widespread assumption accompanying the near-universal neglect of his work - Wilhelm Jeru- salem (1854-1923) cannot count as one of the founders of the sociology of (scientific) knowledge. In order to elucidate the matter, Jerusalem's "sociology of cognition" is here reconstructed in the context of his own work in psychology and philosophy as well as in the context of the work of some predecessors and contemporaries. It is argued that while it shows clear discontinuities with the present-day understanding of the sociology of (scientific) knowledge, Jerusalem's sociology of cognition was not only distinctive in its own day but also anticipated in nuce a much-discussed theme in current history of science. Keywords Sociology of knowledge • Epistemology • Wilhelm Jerusalem • Ludwik Fleck Introduction: the enigma of a forerunner Readers who wanted to learn their history of the sociology of knowledge from Ludwik Fleck's Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact (1935) would receive a strangely slanted picture of the discipline up to then. The choice of writers that Fleck mentioned there - Emile Durkheim, Lucien Lévy-Bruhl, Ludwig Gump- lowicz, and Wilhelm Jerusalem - is rather selective.1 There is no mention of Karl Mannheim or Max Scheler, both of whom were then and are nowadays counted into the field. While this omission clearly indicates Fleck's own interest and focus - the 1 Fleck refers to Jerusalem (1924) and Jerusalem's edition of Levy-Bruhl (1910[1922]) as sources for his quotations from all four; see Fleck (1935 [1980, 46-50]).

Uebel analysis of medical research - it also signals the great variety of enterprises that were pursued at the time under headings such as Soziologie des Erkennens or Wissenssoziologie. Not only did Jerusalem, Mannheim, and Scheler pursue their studies with different methodological orientations, what they studied differed as well. Jerusalem and the school of Durkheim were widely considered to be positivistic in outlook, for they pursued their investigations into the evolution of human thinking by empirical means. This does not mean that they forwent speculation, but that they expected that, if true, some sort of confirmation from anthropology and/or developmental psychology would sooner or later be forthcoming. Scheler, by contrast, proceeded in a philosophical manner, pursuing phenomenological analyses of psychological habits and broad philosophical attitudes in order to identify their metaphysical commitments to self-consciously supra-empirical knowledge claims. Mannheim, meanwhile, developed a peculiar mixture of Dilthey and Marx by remaining distinctively geisteswissenschaftlich in his methodology, first separating the knowledge claims of the social from the natural sciences and then casting doubt on their objectivity due to the peculiar Seinsverbundenheit of the former, that is, their existential connection to the vital socio-economic interests of their proponents. This was not a happy pluralism. Despite having included Jerusalem's last paper in his Versuche zu einer Soziologie des Wissens (1924), Scheler made clear his opposition to Jerusalem's "Western positivism" and sharply differentiated his own initial exploits in the field in the Preface to that book.2 Since Scheler was concerned to oppose all "naturalistic theories of history, primarily the economism of Karl Marx," it is likely that he would have been strongly opposed to Mannheim's sociology of social knowledge as well.3 Scheler died in 1928 and did not participate in the wide debate around Mannheim's Ideologie und Utopie (1929).4 Mannheim, for his part, distinguished his own approach equally from "positivistic" and "idealistic" approaches to the sociology of knowledge.5 Jerusalem died in 1923, too early to have had an opportunity to contrast his own approach to Mannheim's or Scheler' s. Clearly already the earliest sociology of science was contested territory. The degree to which the sociology of knowledge began to assume an (albeit contested) unified identity can be gauged from a comment in what has been called "the first comprehensive critical survey" of the field, Ernst Griinwald's Das Problem der Soziologie des Wissens.6 Grünwald struck Jerusalem out of the discipline as defined in Mannheim's terms and instead termed the former's efforts as "part of social psychology."7 Against this it is to be noted that the border between 2 See Scheler (1924a, 4) and compare his (1921). 3 See Scheler (1926, vii) and compare his (1924b). 4 For documentation of the debate see Lieber (1974) and Meja and Stehr (1980). 5 See Mannheim (1925) and (1926). 6 Stark (1967, 477) on Grünwald (1934). 7 "Wilhelm Jerusalem, who in his sociological theories agrees with regard to many points with the French sociologists, especially with Durkheim und Lévy-Bruhl, has also developed a sociology of knowledge. His sociology of cognition (which he also designated as 'sociological epistemology') constitutes... a part of social psychology. It does not fall into the field of proper sociology and thus does not belong to the discipline that today is called sociology of knowledge. In particular, the concept of the â Springer</page><page sequence="3">Wilhelm Jerusalem's "sociology of cognition" in context 7 the social psychology of thinking and the sociology of thought is at best fluid if determinable at all. Moreover, while it is correct that little of Jerusalem's theory bears on questions of the validity of specific scientific claims and even less on the Seinsverbundenheit of social knowledge, he has much to say (as we shall see) about the social factor in human thought generally and the preconditions of scientific thought in particular. Yet Grünwald wasn't the only early sociologist of knowledge who banished Jerusalem from the discipline according tö his preferred understanding of it. Fleck chose to criticize Jerusalem for what he called his "excessive respect, bordering on pious reverence, for scientific facts" (1935 [1979, 47]). This judgment proved fatal for Jerusalem's standing among the more recent generations of sociologists of scientific knowledge who, enamored of Fleck's approach, have been concerned to reject not only Mannheim's idea that the sociological perspective is only applicable to the social or human but not the natural sciences, but also Robert Merton' s decision to limit the sociological focus to the investigation of the institutional settings of all sciences, leaving the evaluation of scientific validity claims to philosophers.8 There are, with apparently only one short exception, no recent discussions of Jerusalem's work in the sociology of knowledge.9 In recovering Jerusalem's views on "the sociology of cognition" - the title of his first paper on the subject - my aim is to reconstruct a perspective on human knowledge that found little continuation after World War I and was soon forgotten in the battles over Mannheimian and Marxist sociologies of knowledge.10 Yet with the concept of objectivity itself now being historicized by historians of science like Lorraine Daston and Peter Galison, the time may have come to re-read Jerusalem.11 If it can be shown that Jerusalem provided a sketch of the genesis and development of pre-scientific facts and the pre- history of objectivity (considered as a criterion of scientific thought), then Jerusalem can be seen to connect with present-day concerns - even if Grünwald' s judgment were to stand. After beginning with a brief overview of Jerusalem's work as a whole in order to motivate my strategy of exposition, I outline first his naturalistic approach to the Footnote 7 continued 'social factor', which according to Jerusalem the cognition of an individual person depends on, is not identical with the concept of 'Seinsverbundenheit' (existential connection), thus with the concept that so indisputably stands at the centre of the current sociology of knowledge that one could define it as the 'theory of the Seinsverbundenheit (existential connection) of human thought'." (1934, 20; all translations from sources where no English version is given in the references are by the present author). After the first sentence quoted Grünwald refered to Jerusalem (1923, 286ff), (1909a), (1921) and (1924), after the last one quoted to Mannheim (1931). 8 See Merton (1942).

No report of the results of the follow-up competition with a changed topic but also focusing on Jerusalem and with a due date at the end of 1934 were published, Kantstudien having been radically gleichgeschaltet as of vol. 40 (1935). 1 1 See Daston and Galison (2006). Ô Springer</page><page sequence="4">8 T. Uebel theory of knowledge and then his conception of the phylo- and ontogenetic stages of human cognitive development, both of which provide the framework for his sociology of cognition to which I then turn. I present Jerusalem's central idea for conceptualizing the influence of the social in the development of human cognition and consider its incisi veness before raising the question to what extent Fleck's and Griinwald's criticisms are justified. Digging still deeper into the background of his theories, we find Jerusalem at a significant junction in the development of sociology generally and the sociology of knowledge specifically. Wilhelm Jerusalem (1854-1923): an overview Jerusalem is little known these days, even though he was an important intellectual figure in fin-de-siècle Vienna during the last days of the Habsburg monarchy and the early days of the first Republic.12 Until his fifties a high school teacher who published on pedagogical matters, psychology and philosophy, he also lectured at the university as a Privatdozent in philosophy for over two decades, receiving an appointment as extra-ordinary professor only late in life (and becoming Ordinarius just weeks before his death). Jerusalem was also active in the adult education movement and was a founding member of the Ethical Society, a movement dedicated to promoting a secular ethics. His aim in these and related involvements was the amelioration of social ills which in turn were understood as afflictions of an ultimately moral nature.13 Philosophically, Jerusalem distinguished himself with lectures in the Philosophical Society at the University of Vienna and became known widely throughout the German-speaking world as the author of an introductory volume, first published in 1899, that went through ten editions and translations into five languages. In the first decade of the twentieth century Jerusalem attained notoriety by translating William James' Pragmatism. A New Name for some Old Ways of Thinking and promoting the pragmatist cause in the face of the mostly hostile idealist German academic orthodoxy.14 But Jerusalem was not just a philosopher and educator. Early on he also pursued research in psychology - he was the author of a textbook of psychology, first published in 1888, that went through seven editions, and a widely read study of the education of the blind deaf-mute, Laura Bridgman, in 1890 - to which later was added his interest in and promotion of the then new discipline of sociology. In 1907 he was a founding member of the Sociological Society in Vienna and sociological ideas became ever more prominent in successive editions of his Einleitung in die Philosophie , so much so that 3 years after this death these were published independently, slightly supplemented, as an Einleitung in die Soziologie. In his See Eckstein (1935) and the autobiographical Jerusalem (1922), part one of which was enlarged in (1925b). It may be added that being born a Jew in the multi-national empire of Austria-Hungary (in his case Bohemia), Jerusalem perfectly fits J. C. Nyiri's profile for founders of the discipline of the sociology of knowledge (1989). 13 Politically Jerusalem was no socialist and despite his concern for "just social policies" showed certain conservative tendencies; see, e.g., Jerusalem (1897a f 1905a, 229-230]). 14 See James (1907 [1908]) and Jerusalem (1908) and (1909b). â Springer</page><page sequence="5">Wilhelm Jerusalem's "sociology of cognition" in context 9 sociological studies, Jerusalem was a sympathetic reader of Durkheim and his school - he ably defended their conception of the social against charges of hypostatization and made their views his own15 - but he is best known, as noted, as a pioneer of the sociology of knowledge due to his "Soziologie des Erkennens" of 1909. 16 After reading this article, Durkheim gave a sympathetic analysis of it in his journal Année sociologique and started a separate rubric entitled "Les conditions sociologiques de la connaissance."17 In sum, Jerusalem combined philosophy, psychology, and sociology to gain a comprehensive view of the past, present, and potential future of humanity that encompassed evolutionary ideas but also left room for metaphysical speculation.18 To understand his disputed contribution to the sociology of knowledge, therefore, we must also venture to some degree into his philosophical and psychological theories. Jerusalem's epistemological naturalism Just as there have been doubts voiced as to whether Jerusalem's "sociology of cognition" was really sociology, there is likewise doubt whether his was instead an early stab at "social epistemology" - the study of the contribution of social factors to the justification of knowledge claims. There is relatively little epistemology in the current sense to be found in the different editions of in Jerusalem's Introduction to Philosophy. To be sure, the question of what, if anything, we may come to know of the world is addressed and the answers of different philosophical schools are presented, criticized or defended. Yet the issue of the justification of less global knowledge claims and the issue of the definition of knowledge are not discussed explicitly at all, and Jerusalem's positions on these issues require some digging out. Jerusalem's overall epistemological perspective is characterized by the dialec- tical contrast of the philosophy of his day, that between Erkenntniskritik (critique of knowledge) and Erkentnistheorie (theory of knowledge). The former, in line with Kant's critical philosophy, "asks after the possibility and the limits of knowledge," the latter inquires into the "origin, the development and the aims of human knowledge" (1899a, b, 48-49 and 1923, 45). Jerusalem rejected the Erkenntniskritik that denied knowledge of "things-in-themselves." X-rays were undetectable by the eye, and yet their existence was discovered due to their remarkable effects. ... In this way surely many more of the forces in nature will tell investigators of their existence by their effects and so will reveal ever new aspects of the 4hing-in-itself to humanity. 15 See, e.g., Jerusalem (1909a [1925a, 140]) and (1921, vi-vii). See, e.g., Kusch (1995, 15) who otherwise considers Jerusalem for his role in the psychologism dispute, or Stadler (1997 [2001, 41) who otherwise locates him in the intellectual background for the emergence of the Vienna Circle. 17 See Jerusalem (1909a) and Durkheim (1910). For the latter see Jerusalem (1899a, b, 177-178), (1905a, 213-244) and (1923, 358-365); cf. note 37 below. Ö Springer</page><page sequence="6">10 T. Uebel Critical idealism leaves aside the questions of the origin and development of knowledge since it is concerned to determine the conditions of its objective validity and to stress their a priori character. By contrast, critical realism admits of no a priori but bases itself entirely upon experience... Here the question arises, what are the elements of which experience consists and arises from, how does it develop further, in what connection does knowledge stand to other cultural factors of human life, and what are the ultimate goals of human cognition. (Ibid., 58) Jerusalem opted for the perspective of "critical realism" and pursued Erkenntnis- theorie , the investigation of the development of human cognition. To understand Jerusalem's perspective, it is also important to distinguish his naturalism from his undeniable psychologism.19 Once we look beyond Jerusalem's position in the debates about the validation of logical principles to his general epistemological methodology, however, we can recognize his epistemological naturalism.20 It shows itself in his rejection of appeals to a priori determinations of what knowledge and justification have to be, and in his attempt to build our conception of these on the basis of empirical research about human cognition.21 The genetic perspective demands that the process of cognition be investigated in connection with the rest of mental life. Epistemology {Erkenntnistheorie) must not sharply cut off cognition from its relations to feeling and volition, in short, epistemology must be built on a psychological foundation. (1899a, 75) To this "genetic" perspective Jerusalem added a "biological" one. One must not forget that the striving for knowledge originates in the need for self-preservation. Humans must find their way in their environment, they must know what to expect of the objects around them, must learn to understand and interpret their actual and potential behavior, if they want to survive in their midst and come to dominate them. (Ibid.) 19 For the latter see his (1905b). Even in his later sociological phase he claimed: "Even the most universal propositions of logic and mathematics are regarded" - by the evolutionist in contrast to the apriorist thinker - "only as sedimentations, as condensations ( Verdichtungen ) of earlier experience. The evolutionist sees in these propositions the adaptation of thoughts to facts and to each other (Mach), he finds in these valuable measures from the point of the economy of thought." (1909b, 809) For more on Verdichtungen see section "Jerusalem's sociology of cognition" below. 20 By contrast, in ontological matters Jerusalem was no naturalist. While Jerusalem subscribed to a conception of Geisteswissenschaft for which sociology was to provide the foundation (1926, 3-17), it is to be noted that he did not understand the distinction between Natur- and Geisteswissenschaften along Windelband's and Rickert's lines (1904 Г 1905a, 59-601), but as conditioned by the dualism of mind and body (1923, 362-363). "Evolutionist philosophy is not science without presuppositions.... These presuppositions, however, are not the result of a critical theory of knowledge ( Erkenntniskritik ), but they are rather heuristic principles, which the results of empirical science made highly probable." (1909b, 813) Husserl, his opponent in the psychologism dispute, was criticized for taking as essential structures of the mind what are but "associations that have become fixed and social solidifications ( Verdichtungen ), which are the result of the experiences and systematizing work of past generations" (1914 [1925a, 196]). Again, more on Verdichtungen in section "Jerusalem's sociology of cognition" below. Ô Springer</page><page sequence="7">Wilhelm Jerusalem's "sociology of cognition" in context 11 Jerusalem required that the phenomenon of knowledge be investigated empirically, with the survival function of cognition clearly in mind.22 Yet even from this naturalistic perspective Jerusalem did not pursue the normative aspect of epistemology very far, once he settled, without much argument, on the idea that knowledge is equivalent to something like justified true belief. Distinguishing between the criteria of truth and the nature of truth, he said little about the latter - at first only that it consisted in a "law-governed relation" of "correspondence" (Entsprechung) between "judgment and the process judged" - but concentrated on the former, distinguishing between the objective and intersubjective criteria of the truth of a judgment. Objective criteria consisted in the satisfaction of predictions, intersubjective criteria in the agreement of others (ibid., 80). In later editions Jerusalem was more explicit: Holding-true is given to us in both the experiences of knowing and believing. . . . We speak of knowledge if the passing of judgment is contemporaneous with the objective and intersubjective criterion of its truth being given, if the fulfillment of a prediction has been experienced and if agreement by our fellow thinkers appears to be a matter of course. If this not the case, however, but we are still inclined to consider a judgment passed as true, then we speak of opinion, of belief. (1923, 98) Despite some unclarity about the role of the intersubjective agreement - is it really needed in all cases of knowledge? - and about the reach of confirmed prediction - what about the underdetermination of theoretical claims by observational evidence? - it is clear that Jerusalem thought of objectively justified true belief as a necessary condition of knowledge and objective justification as reliance on objective criteria of truth. It is notable as well that Jerusalem rejected the Abbild or copy theory of truth without abandoning his realism. His "correspondence" ( Entsprechung ) did not deal in intuitive similarities: The judgment must be a function of an actual process in the sense that a change in the objective state of affairs would have as consequence a change in the judgment and that what the judgment entails proves itself valid and pertinent to the actual further development of the real events.(Ibid., 92; cf. 1924, 193) This may sound as if Jerusalem had some kind of causal conception in mind - which would render true judgments as appropriately produced belief - but he did not elaborate this thought further. What may fit Jerusalem's bill better than a straight causal account, however, given his pragmatism, would be an account of knowledge as produced by an appropriate rule-governed procedure, with objective justification playing its role. 22 Unlike most current naturalists, however, Jerusalem shared with contemporaries of his like Mach and Brentano the conception now known as methodological solipsism, the idea that our knowledge of the world was built up from phenomenalistic building blocks. â Springer</page><page sequence="8">12 T. Uebel Jerusalem's naturalism also required that the social dimension of cognition be taken account of. Jerusalem designated the mature stage of human cognition as "individualistic" and allowed much room for more-or-less traditional reasoning about justification. Even at this stage, however, he allowed a greater role for the social than was customary by recognizing and accepting the all-pervasive role of testimony: A large part of the judgments that we hold to be true was transmitted to us and made believable by the authority of parents, school, and church. So we see how our world view depends on education, environment, and tradition in many ways, i.e., how powerfully the social factor intervenes in the development of knowledge. (1899a, 80-81) Unlike most theorists in the tradition of Locke and Hume, Jerusalem did not withhold from testimony-derived beliefs the potential status of knowledge. Typical examples were perceptual testimonies, but a particularly important class were so-called conceptual judgments which formulate in lawlike form an essential feature of a concept (1902, 115). Learning from such testimony was "inevitàble, for otherwise we would be unable to internalize the intellectual labor of previous generations" (ibid., 119). It follows that for Jerusalem, "the social factor" in cognition was not only to be called upon when error crept in or mistakes had been made: "Error and truth are in equal measure the result of the collective work of humans." (1899a, 175) Clearly, "the social factor" was of primary importance in the early develop- mental stages, though its effects persist and condition the mature stages of an individual. Yet for epistemology as addressed by philosophers to make sense at all, it was required that individuals think for themselves, and that required the development of appropriate means. As we shall see, the individualism characteristic of the cognitive processes of scientists was for Jerusalem but the result of a long evolutionary development at the beginning of which stood early humans as nothing but herd animals. The very idea of truth, he insisted, could only be fully understood from this perspective. Jerusalem's conception of cognitive development Jerusalem's interest in sociology arose against the background of his genetic- biological perspective on knowledge which by then had produced a distinctive psychology. The psychological foundations required by his epistemology were provided by his theory of cognitive development which in turn was based on what contemporary psychology and ethnology as well as his own research presented as empirical results. As was not uncommon then, Jerusalem's developmental psychology assumed that the individual recapitulated the evolutionary development of the species in her own earliest years. Likewise empiricism's opposition to aprioricism meant that the mind started out as a tabula rasa endowed merely with certain dispositions to associate the contents that experience provided. Nonetheless, Jerusalem's psychological theory was distinctive in its day. Ô Springer</page><page sequence="9">Wilhelm Jerusalem's "sociology of cognition" in context 13 Concerning Herbart's psychology (still dominant in Austria in the second half the of nineteenth century) according to which mental life was accounted for wholly in terms of representations and their interplay - "their mutual impedance due to their contradictory nature and their fusion due to their agreement" (Herbart 1815 [1837/ 1993, 308]) - Jerusalem claimed that it "rarely agreed with what I discovered in my own inner life" (1897b [1905a, 168]). Jerusalem held that mental life was to be considered also apart from language: feeling and volition required separate investigation. To remedy what he considered Herbart's failings on the cognitive side, Jerusalem added, first, to the more passive associative mechanisms based on contiguity and similarity (linking intuitive presentations and conceptual judgments among themselves and with each other), an active psychological mechanism which imposed a certain structure on the cognized material. Second, Jerusalem postulated certain social mechanisms to operate alongside these psychological ones. Third, Jerusalem claimed that it was only due to the effect of these social mechanisms that individual cognition ever attained enough stability to undergo, again with intervention by the social factor, further development. In this overall development Jerusalem distinguished several stages. The earliest was a pre- conceptual stage, followed by a primitively conceptual and finally a properly judgmental stage, with the distinction between the latter two being that between the use of one-word-sentences and subject-predicate constructions. At the third stage, the constructive principle characterizing all human cognition - which Jerusalem claimed to have been the first to understand properly - finally found full expression: the "fundamentale Apperception " which we may call the "basic judgment function." At the most elementary level Jerusalem distinguished "typical ideas" (typische Vorstellungen) as the original elements of psychological activity. "The typical idea is not an abstraction, but a real experience and the objects thereby represented possess a living reality for us. Typical ideas are utterly different from logical concepts." (1902, 97-99) Typical ideas were conceived as pre-conceptual representations of objects by their biologically significant features. They assumed an important role in the earliest development of cognition because they combined what Jerusalem realized was typically opposed: intuitiveness and generality.23 The next stage inaugurated the development of language which started from a firm association of what so far had been merely expressive emotive sounds and typical ideas with the former becoming linguistic sounds. Here we arrive at so-called linguistic "roots" (Wurzeln), one-word phrases whose meaning gradually became separated from any onomatopoetic associations. These roots "designate neither things nor activities but processes in which thing and activity are not yet separated by consciousness" (ibid., 106). The most significant third step simultaneously involved the separation of the root into subject and predicate, the development of concepts and emergence of 23 Jerusalem presented an interesting example of their continued usefulness at later stages: "In teaching, typical ideas have great significance. All maps, all schematic drawings, models, portraits produce typical ideas of great vivacity and enrich our knowledge much more effectively than could be done by descriptions or definitions." (1902, 100). Springer</page><page sequence="10">14 T. Uebel judgments.24 All three developments were intimately tied up with each other. With the help of concept words it became possible to distinguish and represent among processes not only things, but also their properties and states and form judgments by stating their combination. The underlying separation of subject and predicate in turn was the result of the operation of the "basic judgment function" (fundamentale Apperception) which consisted in interpreting every happening as separated into the two elements of a "center of fore e (Kraftzentrum)" and an "expression of force (. Kraftáusserung )" such that the center of force has ascribed to it a "will" that wills the expression in question.25 By separating the root into subject and object we form, structure and objectivize the process at issue. Only then do we begin to interpret it in a way that is conducive to our own nature so as to comprehend and master it intellectually. We have, as it were, translated from the language of the universe into that of humans. (Ibid., 107) It is these anthropomorphizing apperceptions that constitute the early cognition of the natural world. Later on in development, judgments lose their anthropomorphic guise and the projected will becomes an impersonal force.26 As we shall see next, at all of these stages the social factor came to be seen as playing an essential role in providing the types of ideas and representations at issue with their intersubjective significance. Jerusalem's sociology of cognition Already before the turn of the century Jerusalem noted about the mechanism of the basic judgment function that it "explains in a purely psychological fashion the emergence of two of Kant's most important categories: that of substance and of causality" (1899a, 78). In his last essay, the demise of Kant's synthetic a priori determinations of the basic concepts of natural science was compared to the challenge to the apriorist's belief in "the timeless, unchanging logical structure of reason" by "modern ethnology." The task now was "to prepare, in place of Kant's transcendental analysis, a sociological analysis of human knowledge claims" and to work towards a "sociological critique of human reason" (1924, 183-184).27 24 The first of these three elements, the separation of the root into subject and predicate, Jerusalem derived from Gerber ( 1 884), as he himself noted repeatedly (1895, 34, 76-77), ( 1 905b, 148-149), (1922, 19). More on this background in §9 below. 25 See Jerusalem (1895, 78-180), (1899a, 77-80), (1902, 89-91), (1909a [1925, 142-143]), (1924, 190-ř91). 26 Compare Peter Strawson' s proposal that our knowledge of causality develops from imaginative projections on our part: "In a great boulder rolling down the mountainside and flattening the hut in its path we see an exemplary instance of force; and perhaps, in so seeing it, we are in some barely coherent way identifying with the hut (if we are one kind of person) or with the boulder (if we are another): putting ourselves imaginatively in the place of one or the other." (1985, 123). Jerusalem had high hopes for "modern ethnology", namely to replace European enthnocentrism by a "healthy scientific cosmopolitanism" (1897a f 1925a, 2341)-- even though he did not question but saw confirmed, by his theory of cognitive evolution, the widespread idea of a division between Natur- and Kulturvölker as propounded by Vierkandt (1886); see Jerusalem (1905b, 161). For some remarks on the problematical nature of this distinction, see Uebel (2003). Springer</page><page sequence="11">Wilhelm Jerusalem's "sociology of cognition" in context 15 Jerusalem provided a first sketchy formulation of this project in a review of a survey of recent ethnological research in 1897. 28 What was to become his guiding sociological concept was first employed around this time under its own (albeit partial) name without as yet showing its sociological colors: " Verdichtung " (later "soziale Verdichtung "). (I translate these terms as "condensation" and "social solidification," respectively, and note that the terms come with a characteristic product-process ambiguity.)29 The entire field of language, which after all has an immense influence on the acquisition of knowledge, is mainly of a social character. ... A good part of the development of the human mind is laid down in language and its alterations. This is where the result of the intellectual work of generations is condensed and children gain access to a good part of this treasure of thought through learning their mother tongue. (1899a, 81, emphasis added) Jerusalem's concept of condensation built on the principle central to Ernst Mach's theory of science, the "economy of thought" ( Ökonomie des Denkens ), which Jerusalem called the "economy of mental life" ( Ökonomie des Seelenlebens) (1902, 99).30 Thus he said this about learning from testimony: We accept the condensation of numerous experiences in a conceptual judgment as readily given, without experiencing the elements that therein were condensed. A large part of our knowledge consists of such judgments accepted already ready-made. ... We cannot have all the experiences which are condensed into conceptual judgments, because in that case we would never advance since we would have to use all of our time for achieving for ourselves what had been achieved already. We need not discover the laws of free fall and of gravitation, the grammatical rules of foreign languages, therefore, but we learn them. (Ibid., 119, emphasis added) Jerusalem's concept of condensation possessed not only a logical-economical sense but also a developmental dimension. It took some years before the concept of condensation was revealed as thoroughly sociological.31 28 "Religious ideas, mythological interpretations of the course of nature often emerge from the heads of single human beings. Yet they only gain historical significance if they are sustained by some community, become the common property of a clan, a tribe or a people. Once one adds that language too becomes capable of forming and transmitting thoughts only in this fashion, that it is social in its nature of connecting a group of people, then one becomes convinced that in the development of cognition too the social factor plays a role. It would be a task equally meritorious and difficult to characterize this social factor in its historical development." (1897a [1905a, 2381). 29 Literally meaning "thickening", "increase of density" and "compression" in technical contexts and "condensation" in figurative contexts, the translators of Fleck who twice quoted the term from Jerusalem used "consolidation" (1935 [1979, 47, 172]), while the translators of Freud who also used the term used "condensation"; see Laplanche and Pontalis (1967 [1980, 831). 30 On Jerusalem's very first use of Verdichtung in a review of Mach from 1897, see §8 below.

Uebel Then, in his first essay on the sociology of cognition, his aim was stated clearly: I will try to show that in cognition (Erkennen) the social and the individual factor always work together and that the content as well as the validity of human knowledge ( Erkenntnis ) is properly comprehended and appreciated only once it is considered in the light of the social development, especially of social differentiation. (1909a [1925a, 140-141]) In this paper, Jerusalem's results to date were retained but reconfigured under the heading of social solidification (soziale Verdichtung). Now condensation was given an explicitly södo-historical dimension, in part even on an evolutionary scale. For instance, now it was recognized also to have played a role already in determining the pre-conceptual typical ideas. They represent with their fixed tendencies of reaction the level of adaptation to the average environment that the herd achieved to date. Typical ideas are also social solidifications. The universal contained in them is a biological universal that was fixed by social solidification. (1909a [1925a, 146) And once the development of language was underway, the process of social solidification also applied to concepts: "The experiences that have been condensed in the concept word are the common property of fellow speakers and each individual partakes of it. The concept word too is a social solidification." (Ibid., 147) In sum, both typical ideas and concepts ... designate the level of adaptation and the total stock of experience of a human herd. At this stage of development the individual is socially bound in his thinking as in his willing and acting. This holds for the empirical observation of his environment as much as for religious ideas. (Ibid.) By means of social solidification, then, what would otherwise have remained merely ephemeral mental episodes of single human beings were rendered more substantial and provided with something like a trans-temporal and supra-individual permanence. Yet social solidification did not only play an indispensable role in the evolution of human cognition, it remained important to this day. Social solidification . . . plays a very great role also in the concrete experiences of everyday life, in the judgments based on these and the measures thereby taken. In life we nearly always make our decision on the basis of greater or lesser probabilities and can never wait until we have ascertained mathematical certainty. In such cases the fact that others think and act as we do assumes the greatest importance: therein lies the effect of the many social solidifications by Footnote 31 continued plain fact which may be neglected but not disputed, namely that the thought structures so formed are the products of common work, of the total experience of the tribe. They confront the individual as something supra-personal, he permanently remains subject to their suggestive effects and so grows unconsciously into the sociological universal which plays a role in building the self that cannot be considered too highly." (1909b, 812, emphases added). Springer</page><page sequence="13">Wilhelm Jerusalem's "sociology of Cognition" in context 17 which we are influenced. Thus our views about the usefulness or danger of alcohol and smoking, of different kinds of sport, are by no means the result of independent deliberation, but social solidifications which in these matters determine our opinions and our actions (1909a [1925, 144]; cf. 1923, 295) Social solidification operated not only in the formation of pre-historic myth but also in everyday cognition. Whenever we are faced with uncertainty, we tend to rely on beliefs shared with others. This is no different in science, Jerusalem suggested, for, he continued: Even scientific theories represent to considerable extent social solidifications that tradition has preserved and that manifest themselves as resistances difficult to overcome when confronted with new views. Phlogiston, action at a distance, and the 'horror vacui', even the atomic theory are well known examples.32 Social solidification operated even in science. Here it may be questioned whether, so understood, social solidifications are relevant to the idea of knowledge: are not myth, accepted opinion, and unreasonable scientific conservatism the very opposite of it? Social solidification involves something like social reinforcement or, as Jerusalem once put it, "reciprocal fortification" (1909[1925, 144]). What brings about the social solidification of an idea may be a more or less reasonable desire for agreement with others in a group, but it may also be coercive. The agreement itself concerns either (depending on the developmental stage) the appropriateness of a typical representation or an emotive sound on a given occasion, of a one-word sentence in application to a process or event, or of entire judgments about certain states of affairs.33 Social solidification makes for and sustains intersubjective agreement. Intersubjective agreement, of course, was one of the criteria of the truth of a judgment that were singled out by Jerusalem. A certain difficulty becomes apparent here. Objective truth comes into view only once the evolution of cognitive development has not only entered the third stage but developed still further, namely entered the individualistic stage. Only then can any merely coercive force of social solidification be broken. Human thought begins with social solidifications and only the emergence from the herd, only the formation of independent personalities by social differen- tiation, leads beyond social solidifications to the objective knowledge of facts and laws. The social factor must be accompanied by the individualistic one if true knowledge is to develop. ... Independent human beings strive to rid themselves of the ties of social solidification. They do not want to believe traditional opinions about things but want to get to know the things 32 Jerusalem (1909a [1925, 144-145]); nearly identical in (1923, 295) where the reference to atomic theory is dropped; briefer in (1924, 192) where the reader is referred to Mach's works on the history of mechanics, the theory of heat and optics.

Uebel themselves. They direct knowledge to what is objective. True' no longer is what is believed by all, but what has been established by careful observation and measurement of things. ... The place of the intersubjective criterion of truth, which consists in the agreement with fellow thinkers, is taken by the objective criterion of the fulfillment of predictions. (Ibid., 149-150)34 One is tempted to ask: when it comes to objective truth, if it becomes a matter of breaking the bonds of social solidification, is it not the case that at that stage it is the absence of a previously predominant social factor that really matters? Jerusalem may well have agreed - for him the very role that social solidification did play in science made it "necessary that the traditional concepts of a science must be revised from time to time" (ibid., 145).35 He recognized that the process of social solidification and the search for truth could conflict. However, Jerusalem did not regard as correct the objection that objective truth therefore had become independent of social processes. Truth is always a guide for human action. That is why the social factor retains its importance. An individual researcher may have discovered a new truth independently and all by himself, he may have proved incontrovertibly its objective validity by confirmed predictions. However, truth can become an effective force only by being recognized and translated into action. Even objective truths must become 'socially solidified' if they are to attain constancy and effectiveness. (1909a [1925a, 150]; cf. ibid., 152) If truths-in-themselves are only a philosopher's plaything, then whatever promotes the wider recognition of truths is essential to truths-as-we-know-them. It is not the task of social solidification to separate truth from falsehood, but to make beliefs causally effective by being shared - whatever their truth value. And this holds especially for science whose deeply social nature Jerusalem fully recognized. After all, early on in his paper he noted "that scientific research consists in collective work that is being organized in recent years ever more extensively, that no researcher could do without previously established results hardly needs to be stated" (ibid., 141). It was in order to deepen our understanding of the process that Jerusalem introduced the notion of social solidification. None of this, however, negates the fact that objective truth itself appears to stand apart from the social processes Jerusalem had identified as of central importance for cognition. And was this not the point of view that Fleck later criticized as more or less dogmatic? Indeed, was it not the very point of the individualizing tendency, culminating in the idea of objective truth, to leave behind the social influences in attaining objective truth? 34 In passing we note the potential tension in these passages with others (e.g., 1923, 98, quoted above) where the objective criterion does not altogether replace the intersubjective criterion but rather becomes the decisive one. 35 That the periodic need for the revision of scientific "auxiliary" concepts played a central role on Mach's historic-critical conception of science was noted explicitly by Jerusalem, but also independently by Frank (1917). Jerusalem here also credited Mach with the recognition that certain scientific principles (like that of the conservation of energy) are "pre-formed in instinctual, that is wholly socially determined thinking." Springer</page><page sequence="15">Wilhelm Jerusalem's "sociology of cognition" in context 19 Jerusalem on objective truth and the Cartesian revolution in philosophy It is at this juncture that Jerusalem's relation to pragmatism must be brought into the picture. I noted above that his psychologism must not be allowed to overshadow his naturalism. That said, it must also be noted that it was Jerusalem's intervention in the psychologism dispute with his Der kritische Idealismus und die reine Logik of 1905 that brought him to the attention of the Oxford pragmatist F.C.S. Schiller. His favorable review in the International Journal of Ethics led Jerusalem to inquire about pragmatism in a letter to William James with whom he had been in correspondence previously, which in turn led to his translation of James's book in 1908.36 Significantly enough, it was his pronouncements on truth that had attracted Schiller's attention: Truth ... is created only by the function of judgment. ... In judgment human beings of the most primitive level of development only adopt a stance, however. This adoption of a stance consists in the actions which are prompted by the completed interpretation of a perceived process. If the measures taken on the basis of that interpretation prove to be beneficial for life, biologically useful, then the interpretation was right; if they prove themselves to be superfluous or even detrimental then the interpretation was wrong. . . . The valuation which action is accorded due to the benefit or detriment it brings with it, this valuation and nothing else is the origin of the concepts true and false . (1905b, 162) So far, Jerusalem is (proto-) pragmatist and anti-Platonist: no judgment, no truth. But Jerusalem also wrote: Soon the function of judgment proves so valuable and beneficial for life that it is exercised even where there is no immediate employment of its interpre- tation. We pass judgments in advance for later, as it were, and store the results of the interpretations made in our memory. . . . This brings with it a change in the meaning of the concept of truth. A judgment is true in the first stage of development only in so far as it prompts us immediately to undertake measures that are useful and beneficial for life. As soon as we begin to judge for storage, however, this meaning becomes a broader one. ... In the beginning truth is decided still by the ultimate use, and the biological root of the concept of truth is still plainly evident. But the belief becomes ever stronger and more common that our judgments gain in utility the more the interpretation which they contain corresponds to the actual behavior of things. ... Purely theoretical, highly objective judgment is thus itself a product of the instinct of preservation, indeed one of its most valuable and significant products. . . . Such judgments are in fact possible - as proved by the emergence and development of science. There research into the laws governing physical and psychological processes is undertaken without concern for practical gain. Even if the results of these investigations in the end are destined to make the life of humanity safer, richer, and more pleasurable, the individual researcher 36 See Jerusalem (1910 [1925a, 158]) and (1925b, 32-33]). Springer</page><page sequence="16">20 T. Uebel can contribute to this last and highest aim only by proceeding strictly objectively. (Ibid., 168-169) Jerusalem did not deny "purely theoretical" truth (what he later was to call "objective truth"): "It is possible for us to think theoretically, but first we had to learn to do so." (Ibid., 170) Accordingly, when a few years later he asserted that "[f]or pragmatists, there is no such thing as a purely theoretical truth the content of which would never be practically discernible anywhere" (1908a [1925a, 138]), the emphasis lay on the final clause. What he and the pragmatists denied was a truth of which we could not discern any possible consequences - yet objective truth was not like that, for its consequences were discernible: The objective factor of knowledge-contents only becomes an object of awareness due to the individualistic tendency of development and so is appreciated only then. Thereby a totally new concept of truth is being created, one which science continues to develop ever more strictly. A judgment now is true only if it is possible to regard it as a function of the observed process. Only now is it possible to make predictions on the basis of objective observations and so confirm, by their fulfillment, the truth of the original judgment. (1926, 126) Jerusalem happily conceded "the need for a purely theoretical concept of truth for science" (1922, 75, 74). Concern with a better understanding of truth also has repercussions on the understanding of what knowledge is. On this point Jerusalem offered some striking considerations in his discussion of Hans Vaihinger's theory of fictions in Die Philosophie des Als-Ob (1911) - in part in defense of his own claim that "we must think illogically if we want to find something new" (as stated in his report on the discussions about pragmatism at the International Congress of Philosophy in Heidelberg (1908b) which scandalized the apriorist opposition). Jerusalem set out to "combine the fundamental idea of pragmatism and the philosophy of as-if" in order to "develop a new idea of the nature of science and the true task of philosophy" (1912 [1925a, 183]). It is the former that is of interest here. Stating facts is an ideal which we can approach but which we can never reach. From this follows an unbearable contradiction. Science is based on the assumption that humans are able to state the facts. If humans are unable to do so, then there can be no science. Yet science has proved its existence by the enormous consequences on our life which it has effected and continues to do. The philosophy of as-if offers a welcome resolution of this dilemma. Science with its bold daring makes the fictitious assumption that we are capable of stating facts and continues its steady work on this basis. The more intensive and successful its research, the more our intellect is schooled and the more we learn to suppress our feelings and wishes and to abandon our prejudices and approach the ideal of the purely objective stating of facts, just as a polygon becomes ever more similar to a circle by the further addition of sides. The assumption that we are capable of stating facts was at first an indubitable dogma and now, by virtue of a transfer of ideas, has become a fruitful and indispensable fiction. (1912 [1925a, 184]) â Springer</page><page sequence="17">Wilhelm Jerusalem's "sociology of cognition" in context 21 This potent fusion of pragmatism and fìctionalism coheres well with Jerusalem's evolutionism, but also casts serious doubt on the plausibility of the charge of simple dogmatism. Rather, the very idea of attaining objective truth - "stating facts" - emerges as a "tool for thought" ( Denkmittel ), somewhat similar to how "the forms of intuition of space and time, the concept of number, thing and substance, causality and existence" emerged (1902, 129). And whatever meta- physical significance these forms of intuition and concepts may possess - Jerusalem stressed that of the idea of substance and causality (1897b [1905a, 202]; 1916 [1925a, 210]) - like them, the idea of objective truth also has a psycho- social history. The idea of objective truth was not regarded as a logical or psychological primitive but as the result of a long social development. That said, Jerusalem clearly did not accept the ontological consequences of the Vaihingerian fictionalisation of scientific ideals, for he did not revise his own robust realism. For him, the idea of objective truth was not only "indispensible" but possessed reality as well. In this context it is also significant that Jerusalem was able to point to still another, entirely different but no less striking instance of the interplay of individualistic and social factors in history where the wider social recognition of its outcome is essential: the discovery of the phenomenal realm as a distinct realm of knowledge which in turn gave rise to the idea of humanity and universalist thinking. The individualistic developmental tendency also . . . opened up an entirely new field for thought and investigation that it had not been possible to turn into an object of reflection at the stage of social dependency. This is the humans' own inner psychic life which only personalities who had grown fully independent were capable and eager to explore. (1923, 297) For Jerusalem, the self-conscious, individualistic "inward turn" (1924, 195) already began with Herclitus in Greek antiquity and led to the idea of humanity as such in the thought of the Roman stoics, laying the foundation for the universalism of the Renaissance. This new access to a field of knowledge that in a previous stage of development had not been recognized as such provided not only for a quantitative increase of knowledge but also for what was considered a qualitative jump in our possible knowledge of knowledge; Descartes reached the firm conviction, based on his method of doubt, that in the depth of his own consciousness there existed a source of indubitable certainty and a guarantee of his own real existence. This very thought is of a strongly individualistic character. Descartes did not doubt for a moment that his inner self-certainty should make itself known to every human being. The individualistic tendency of his thought thus immediately turns him towards universalist claims, i.e. claims that hold for everybody. Only because of this is it possible to start from one's own consciousness to lay the basis of a new epistemology. (1923, 300) The history of philosophy itself, Jerusalem suggested here, cannot be understood without understanding the interplay of the forces of social reinforcement and individualist differentiation. Descartes' epoch-making work is viewed as a Springer</page><page sequence="18">22 T. Uebel "sociologically conditioned" "bold synthesis of individualism and universalism" (albeit one responsible to this day for "extensive and dangerous self-deceptions") (1924, 197). In philosophy, too, the idea of objectivity as universal validity became conceivable only at an advanced stage of social development characterized by increased individualist differentiation in cognition.37 Interim conclusion: Jerusalem as a sociologist of knowledge To show that, in so many words, the human understanding of objectivity has a history, indeed a social history, is one thing; to show that the justification of individual knowledge claims here and now is dependent on social factors is another. Jerusalem did not really engage with the latter question. But does this disqualify him, as Grünwald believed, from the sociology of knowledge altogether, or even convict him, as Fleck did, of "excessive respect, bordering on pious reverence, for scientific facts"? By focusing solely on Jerusalem's "social psychology" Grünwald overlooked the dimension of social history (and prehistory) within which Jerusalem considered the development of the tools of thought that are our concepts and theoretical conceptions. Likewise, by focusing, as Fleck did, on Jerusalem's treatment of scientific facts as objective he diminished his distinctive contribution to the reconstruction of the social construction of pre-scientific facts, his stress on the role of social solidification in periods of scientific change, and his argument that and how scientific facts are distinguished from pre-scientific fact, all of which bear significant sociological considerations. Yet that Fleck and Grünwald missed the measure of Jerusalem's work on the sociology of cognition does not mean that it stands above criticism. To locate its weaknesses we may follow Jerusalem's summary. In the emergence and development of human knowledge three factors work together which must be distinguished even though they permeate each other and intermingle in ever more complex ways. 1 . The social factor is there from the beginning and assumes importance in primitive collective representations and in 'social solidifications'. It is the indispensible condition for the constancy and practical employment of cognition. 2. The individual factor gives to cognition the direction towards objectivity and so is the precondition for the development of science. 3. The common human factor creates the original form of cognition in judgment and in the course of development allows ascent to ever greater generalizations. 4. All three factors are sociologically conditioned, because both the human individual and the idea of humanity as a whole are a product of communal living. (1924, 200 and 1926, 135) 37 That Jerusalem went further on this basis to develop and recommend the idea of humanity as an aspirational ethical ideal and telos of history, may be noted but cannot be pursued here. See Jerusalem (1923, 328-330, 350-351) and (1924, 204-206). â Springer</page><page sequence="19">Wilhelm Jerusalem's "sociology of cognition" in context 23 Correct in its description of the broad sweep of Jerusalem's theory, which still today is highly suggestive for its dialectic of social and individualistic factors, this summary suggests that, as always, the devil is in the details. On the one hand, it is easy to fault Jerusalem for mistakes that any naturalistic philosophy is liable to incur, namely faults stemming from the best science of its day. Some of Jerusalem's psychological speculations are clearly dated, none more so than the guiding principle that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny. Likewise, much of the ethnological and anthropological research that he based himself upon so enthusiastically has not stood the test of time, for a variety of reasons. But this would not appear to invalidate the whole of his "sociology of cognition." On the other hand, we noted that Jerusalem's work is a "sociology of knowledge" in only a very particular sense. Many of the concerns that nowadays are treated under this heading are not treated by him. Likewise, Jerusalem's work is also a "social epistemology" only in a limited sense. Despite his notable recognition of the central role of testimony, he does not wear that label comfortably either. But neither absence should rule him out from having made contributions to these disciplines. What does appear to be more damaging is the already noted tension between the force of and demand for the process of social solidification and that of individual reason. It's easy enough to envisage even an inversion of Fleck's criticism along the following lines. Jerusalem's central notion of social solidification seems to level unduly the difference between agreement into which an individual is in some sense coerced by the circumstances (the opinion shared with others in the pre-individualistic stage) and agreement that an individual freely reasons to (evidence-based hypotheses and theories in the individualistic stage). To put reasoned agreement about a scientific hypothesis on the same level of social solidification as shared belief in witchcraft would rather seem to obscure what makes objectivity possible. The process of soziale Verdichtung that early on creates shared typical ideas and later concepts would appear to be a different one from the process of soziale Verdichtung which allows the recognition of scientific truth to become shared. Now to make this criticism is neither to deny the deeply social nature of science nor to claim (falsely) that Jerusalem denied it. Rather, it is to hold that the central concept of his sociology of cognition is still too crude. While it captures nicely, on the one hand, the developmental process by which the past experience of the group is sedimented in its language and conceptual structure and, on the other hand, the process of social reinforcement that provides for still wider consensus about all sorts of subject matter, the notion of social solidification appears not to throw any light on the distinctive process of determining scientific truth in the first place. So Jerusalem's sociology of cognition bequeathed a problem to anyone who may have wanted to continue his program: the concept of soziale Verdichtung stood in need of further elaboration, whether it is looked at from the point of view of sociologists or of philosophers. Given its quasi-biological evolutionary origins, it is perhaps no surprise that this concept, like Jerusalem's broader anthropological concerns, fell by the wayside among all of his de facto successors in the sociology of knowledge - to the point of him being written out of the discipline. Yet beyond these concerns, some readers by now may also have begun to worry about the Ô Springer</page><page sequence="20">24 T. Uebel originality of Jerusalem's sociology of cognition. To begin with, he was by no means alone in employing the term Verdichtung. Another question concerns his relation to the Durkheim school. These questions suggest that our reconstruction of Jerusalem's work on the sociology of knowledge has not yet been sufficiently contextualized. Verdichtung in Mach, Simmel and Lazarus The term Verdichtung appears in Mach's address to the Imperial Academy of Sciences in Vienna in 1882, first published in English in 1883 and in German in 189638: No human mind could comprehend all the individual cases of refraction. But knowing the index of refraction for the two media presented, and the familiar law of the sines, we can easily reproduce or fill out in thought every conceivable case of refraction. The advantage here consists in the disburden- ing of the memory; an end immensely furthered by the written preservation of the natural constants. More than this comprehensive and condensed (verdich- tet) report about facts is not contained in a natural law of this sort. (1893 [1986, 193]). It appears that in just this sense the term Verdichtung gained wide currency.39 Jerusalem's review of the German edition of Popular Scientific Lectures (containing Mach's address) picked up on it - "We make use of the work of earlier generations and condense ( verdichten ) it in our concepts and formulas" (1897c [1905a, 188]; cf. 1916 [1925a, 208]) - and he went on, as noted above, to develop further the socio- historical dimension of the process in question.40 (For his part, Mach mentioned "the closeness" of his views to those of Jerusalem (in 1905b) in the Preface to the second edition of his Erkenntnis und Irrtum (1905 [1976, xxxv]) and credited it to their shared biological-evolutionary perspective.) But Jerusalem and Mach were not the only theorists to so use Verdichtung . Georg Simmel' s "formal" sociology consisted in the analysis of social forms, be they those of specific configurations such as various institutions of church and state or the general forms of social interaction, like competition, imitation, etc. Simmel suggested that society be thought of as a structure of reciprocal relations and effects ( Wechselwirkung ) which did not simply happen in society, but which constituted society and its socialized individuals through the process of "sociation." Simmel 38 The term Verdichtung does not, however, appear in Section 4.4 of Mach (1882), which is dedicated to the same topic, the economy of science* though the process and result designated by it is very well described there. 39 Precisely in this sense it was also employed, for instance, by Friedrich Adler in his German translation of Duhem's La théorie physique, son object et sa structure when the latter speaks, with reference to Mach, of the "doubling" of the economy of thought first afforded by the replacement of individual facts by laws, namely by "laws being condensed in theories" (Duhem 1906 [1908/1978, 24]). 40 In his translation of James's Pragmatism. , Jerusalem used the term " verdichtet " for "funded" as in "funded truths" and "experience funded" (1907 [1908/1994, 142, 148, 170]). &lt;0 Springer</page><page sequence="21">Wilhelm Jerusalem's "sociology of cognition" in context 25 distinguished between the "form" and "content" of these sociations. "Content" was whatever was required to realize a social relation, i.e., persons, their interests, etc. Their reciprocal relation created and sustained the categorically distinct "form" by a process of "condensation" ( Verdichtung ) (1890 [1989, 134]; cf. 1898 [1992, 315] and 1908 [1992, 604, 608). The forms of sociation - "the embodiment of social energy in structures which exist and develop beyond the individual" (1908 [1992, 15]) - were defined in terms which abstracted from the particular individuals entering into these relations. These abstract terms first made possible the classification of apparently disparate social phenomena by their means.41 But Simmel too was not the first to employ Verdichtung (or, indeed, Wechselwirkung) in a sociological sense. As Klaus Christian Köhnke has shown, Simmel derived that concept from a scholar much discussed at the time, but rarely mentioned by name: Moritz Lazarus, the originator of the widely misunderstood discipline of Völkerpsychologie which aimed to provide both a psychology of social life and a theory of socio-cultural evolution.42 Together with the linguist Heymann Steinthal, Lazarus founded the Zeitschrift fur Volkerpsychologie und Sprachwis- senschaft in 1860 and thereby created what Jerusalem called "the first forum for ethnological research providing a great service for it" (1897a [1905, 232]). Already in Lazarus and Steinthal's introductory article in the first issue the term Verdichtung appears. To understand what is involved in the concept, they suggested considering ... the comparison of the trained mathematician and the beginner: what the latter has to work out most laboriously for himself in order to think it clearly and securely, the former condenses ( verdichtet ) in great sweeps and still thinks more securely, more distinctly, and more definitely. (1860, 65). This use of Verdichtung is illustrative of the economy of thought thematized by Mach, but where the latter is an impersonal, quasi-logical matter, for Lazarus Verdichtung is a highly personal affair. This becomes clear in a paper of his in which he sought to distill his further remarks about Verdichtung in his sprawling Das Leben der Seele (1856/1858). There Lazarus distinguished different forms of Verdichtungen. We must distinguish between two types of condensation of thought. One is individualistic, subjective, such that the condensed product of thought emerges from one's own efforts, one's own slow process of condensation. The other is universal, objective, such that it is only the result of a historical process that is taken into one's mind. The former shows the culture of the individual, the latter the public culture of an age. (1862 [2005, 35]) Importantly then, Lazarus too used Verdichtung in different senses but already tried to systematize these. There was the individualistic, subjective sense of learning just 41 For further uses by Simmel of Verdichtung , see (1892a [1989, 28-29]), assigning to it the job of solidifying morals in customs, and (1892b [1989, 318]), implicating it in the empathetic understanding of other minds. Köhnke (1996, 346-348) points to a use which denotes the Verdichtung of intuitive ideas in abstract concepts. 42 See Köhnke (1990) and (2005a). The characterisation of Völkerpsychologie given here - which restores it against much misrepresentation of varying sorts - is his. Ô Springer</page><page sequence="22">26 T. Uebel noted and there were objective senses of it, where the intellectual labor of past generations is laid down in concepts or seemingly self-evident judgments or in firm customs reflecting a certain moral standard attained by previous generations (cf. ibid., 31-32). Unfortunately, however, Lazarus gave no account of how the advance made by personal Verdichtung was translated into the objective Verdichtungen of definitions, platitudes and expected behaviors. That, of course, is just what Jerusalem's concept of soziale Verdichtung promised to achieve but it did so, apparently, only for the price of glossing over the complexity of hypothesis formation and acceptance in science. Jerusalem and Völkerpsychologie Whether Mach adopted the term Verdichtung from Lazarus is unclear - the term Denkökonomie which he used more often was derived from the Austrian economist Emanuel Hermann, the inventor of the postcard43 - but what is of interest is whether Jerusalem did. Indeed, given the origination of the concept of Verdichtung by Lazarus and the importance it plays in Jerusalem's sociology of cognition, one question now imposes itself: does Jerusalem belong to those not insignificant thinkers who learnt much from Lazarus and Steinthal's Völkerpsychologie but who, for reasons best known to themselves, did not tell their readers about this background?44 Here it must be noted first of all that Jerusalem by no means failed to mention the founders of Volkerpsychologie. They are named repeatedly in his writings when the development of language is discussed and Jerusalem even published a Nachruf for Steinthal. Yet Lazarus was not credited as a forerunner of Jerusalem's own sociology of cognition, even though he was credited for introducing the concept of Verdichtung 45 So there are three aspects under which our question must now be considered. First, there is the issue of the theoretical proximity or distance between the psychological conceptions adhered to by Lazarus and Steinthal on the one hand and Jerusalem on the other. Second, there is the question of how Jerusalem understood the Völkerpsychologie of Lazarus and Steinthal. Third, there are the explicit criticisms that Jerusalem made of Völkerpsychologie. To begin with, it is important to note that Lazarus and Steinthal stood squarely in the tradition of Herbart's psychology. As already noted, Jerusalem dissented from 43 See Mach (1910); on Herrmann, see Haller (1986). 44 For thoughts on why Dilthey and Simmel, among others may have failed to mention Lazarus, see Köhnke (2005a). One of these is unlikely to apply in the case of Jerusalem. Not only was he, like Lazarus und Steinthal, Jewish himself but his Nachruf for Steinthal made a point of recounting his lectures to the Hochschule für die Wissenschaft vom Judentum (Academy for Jewish Studies) in Berlin (cofounded by Lazarus) and compared him to Lessing's Nathan the Wise (1899b [1905a, 210-211]). 45 See Jerusalem (1895, 150). Jerusalem once compared Lazarus to Steinthal as possessing the greater "gift of subtle psychological analysis" and referred to his Das Leben der Seele, Band 2: Geist und Sprache in support (1899b Г 1905a, 207]). That, of course is just the book in whicH" Lazarus had first formulated the ideas of his later paper on Verdichtung published in 1862: Eckstein (1935, 90) identified Jerusalem's mention (at 1895, 150) of Lazarus's origination of the term as pointing to Lazarus (1856-1857, vol. II, 160). Ô Springer</page><page sequence="23">Wilhelm Jerusalem's "sociology of cognition" in context 27 Herbartian psychology.46 This difference is significant. But Jerusalem also still shared with those working in the Herbartian tradition the anti-apriorist zeal for replacing the "pure reasons" of their transcendentalist or idealist opponents by something more concrete.47 Moreover, Herbart himself foreshadowed the concept of Verdichtung already in §359 of his Lehrbuch 48 Over the centuries, the human race gets ever older; every age transmits to the subsequent one its most worked out ideas and its stock of language, together with its inventions, arts, social institutions. From these there emerge gradually phenomena which an individual psychological mechanism would not have been able to produce by itself. In each of us lives the entire past! ... Cut off from the history of the human race , empirical psychology will remain incomplete ... (1815 [1837/1993, 318-319], orig. emphasis) So while Jerusalem nursed equally important methodological disagreements with Lazarus and Steinthal's Herbartian psychology, he also still shared important philosophical points of view with them. What then did Jerusalem learn from Lazarus and Steinthal? Here it must be noted that Jerusalem's main point of reference was Steinthal, not Lazarus, and his main concern the study of language as such, not Volkerpsychologie in the wider sense. Thus he reported in his autobiography: The intensive study of language led me to psychology with Steinthal as my first guide. From his writings I first learnt that not the logical but only the strictly psychological perspective on linguistic matters allows the complete comprehension of language-based thinking and creating. (1922, 54 and 1925b, 2) It was in connection with his "study of the relation between grammar and logic in Aristotle," in the early 1880s, that Jerusalem "got to know Steinthal's book on the history of the study of language in antiquity and was thus directed to the other writings of this deep thinker which also later provided valuable suggestions" (1925b, 18). Lazarus and Steinthal were praised for having been the first to note that the "linguistic roots are not words but sentences" (1895, 20), thus opening the path for Gerber' s conception of judgment (ibid., 76) which, he acknowledged, his own idea of the basic judgment function was built on. More generally, Lazarus and Steinthal were praised for having stressed that "language is by far the most 46 See §4 above. Elsewhere he also criticized Vaihinger for adopting "the mechanics of mental life introduced by Herbart and developed by Steinthal" that unduly postulates wholly separate elements unable to merge with each other (1912 [1925a, 179-180]). Jerusalem also rejected Herbart* s principle - endorsed by Lazarus and Steinthal (1851 [2005, 22])- -of the "limitation of the human mind" ( Enge des Geistes ) and instead accepted Wundťs "law of the growth of mental energy or the new creation of mental powers," interpreting the creation of new tools of thought as the "enlargement of mental powers" (1897b [1905a, 173]). 47 "Nothing is more ridiculous than the attempt to explain the mind of an educated person in terms of his inborn mental powers. Even so, just about everything that's been said about reason in recent times has to be classed as such patent foolishness."

Uebel important factor in the development of knowledge" (1905, 155), that only language allows the development of cognition beyond typical ideas to concepts (ibid., 159). It was with regard to the detail of the answer to the question of "how the originally emotive sounds become language sounds" that discord arose. According to Jerusalem, that question was "not solved correctly by Steinthal" (1899b [1905a, 206]), for "emotive sounds become language sounds through the process of emotion fading and the sound entering into a closer association with the designated event" (1902, 105). Steinthal, by contrast, had interpolated an onomatopoetic stage. Jerusalem reports (1925b, 22) that whereas Lazarus reacted with a friendly letter to his study of Laura Bridgman in which Jerusalem first made this criticism and proposed his solution (1890 [1891, 41-43]), Steinthal took exception and published a dismissive review. His Nachruf shows that Jerusalem did not bear a lasting grudge, but also spells out his considered criticism of VÓlkerspy citologie: For more than a quarter century [Lazarus and Steinthal's] journal served as the center for the investigation of the mind of a people ( Volksgeist ). Yet it must be said that the appealing and large-scale project of the two scientists did not succeed completely. To this day, Volkerspychologie has reached neither secure results nor a settled methodology. For over the recent decades it has become apparent that while language is a very important product of the mind of a people it is not its only one, and especially also that the structure of language does not allow the certain derivation of the elementary thoughts of peoples. Modern ethnology therefore aims to make the primitive ideas and thought processes of the original peoples ( Urvôîker ) the focus of research, independently of the linguistic form in which they are clothed. The journal founded by Steinthal and Lazarus became a victim of this change of direction in science, but all the ideas stored therein are by no means lost. Yet another fact may also have contributed to this partial failure. On the whole, Lazarus and Steinthal occupy, despite their determined emphasis on the social nature of man, the standpoint of the eighteenth century and remained individualists. Peoples are for them large individuals and they believe that the laws of individual psychology must also hold for the investigation of the soul of a people ( Volksseele ). But modern sociology and ethnology teach that even the independent, autonomous personality is but the product of social development, and that in a certain sense the human herd preceded the individual. For this reason Volkerspychologie must start from the hardly conscious, instinctive drives rather than the clear and self-conscious thoughts of cultured man. But any future Volkerspychologie will still have much to learn from the founders of this science. (1899b [1905a, 209-210])49 Once we add that the Zeitschrift für Völkerpsychologie und Sprachwissenschaft, which existed from 1860 to 1890, was edited mainly by Steinthal (who represented the Sprachwissenschaft) and that the contributions by Lazarus (who represented 49 Note that, by contrast, Jerusalem criticized Wilhelm Wundt's later version of Völkerpsychologie not only as still much too individualist but also stated that - unlike with Lazarus and Steinthal - he "missed the constant attention to the social nature of language" (1905c, 281). Springer</page><page sequence="25">Wilhelm Jerusalem's "sociology of cognition" in context 29 Völkerpsychologie) ended around 1865, 50 then the stated differences in this passage make clear that around 1900, even less in 1909, Jerusalem did not have an obvious reason to think of himself as an heir to Lazarus and of him as his forerunner, especially once he had introduced the notion of social solidification. With this in mind we may reconsider the timeframe of Jerusalem's theoretical development. As we saw, the term ' Verdichtung ' first appeared in his writings in 1897 in connection with Mach and was integrated into his existing theory of cognitive development by 1899. The first use of the term 4 soziale Verdichtung ' signified the inception of his sociology of cognition in 1909. In between lay the publication of Jerusalem's major contribution to the psychologism debate which not only prompted his involvement with American pragmatism but also featured an extremely long quote from (the first edition of) Simmel's Die Philosophie des Geldes (1900 [1989, 101-102, 749-750, 103]), followed by the comment: "Here for the first time the concept of truth has been traced back to its biological origin along with a suggestion of how from this theoretical truth develops." (1905b, 164) That Simmel's ideas broadly agreed with his long-standing biological perspective may well have encouraged Jerusalem to study the former's works in greater detail - and may have lead him to discover Simmel's distinctly sociological use of Verdichtung. Certainly, Jerusalem's posthumous book on sociology shows his familiarity with and appreciation of also Simmel's Soziologie (1908) and his Soziale Differenzierung (1890); it also lists his Probleme der Geschichtsphilosophie (1892b) and Grundfr- agen der Soziologie (1920) (see Jerusalem 1926, 63, 70, 212). What remains unclear, of course is just when Jerusalem studied these works. Yet what we do know strongly suggests that, if external stimuli prompted Jerusalem's introduction in 1909 of soziale Verdichtung and the sociology of cognition that it signifies, then it is highly likely that one of them was his encounter with Simmel's use of Wechselwirkung and Verdichtung .51 In light of the marginalization that Lazarus' s pioneering work for a science of culture has suffered, this suggestion does not lack in irony: Simmel, after all, was an attentive student of Lazarus whose own use of Verdichtung in Das Leben der Seele. Geist und Sprache Jerusalem had either overlooked or forgotten. Yet we should also note that Jerusalem's approach remains distinctive even in comparison to Simmel's. He criticized Simmel for taking into account only the reciprocal interactions of individuals and hardly ever investigating the reciprocal relations between individuals and the group as a whole (ibid., 63, 70). Just that of course had become Jerusalem's own distinctive focus.52 50 See Köhnke (2005a, xl and xxxi). 51 Of course, Lazarus too employed Wechselwirkung to describe the interaction of individuals in society but not as explicitly as Simmel as constituting both individuals and society. See, e.g., Simmel (1890 [1989, 129-131]), a section summarised elsewhere as: "The unity of society as the reciprocal action of its parts. The condensation of this reciprocal action into objective structures." (Ibid., 111). To be sure, Simmel's project of a sociology of culture in its most general sense is a much richer sociology than Jerusalem's more anthropological account which, as we saw, mostly leaves off where more modern sociologies of knowledge start, but even the latter pale in comparison with the range of Simmel's enterprise. Ô Springer</page><page sequence="26">30 T. Uebel Jerusalem and the Durkheim School Worries about Jerusalem's originality vis-à-vis the Durkheim school may appear to be less recherché. It is clear that Durkheim' s thesis of the division of labor as the mechanism of social differentiation and development provided Jerusalem with a central point of reference and led him to further acquaintance with his work.53 Jerusalem also sympathized with Durkheim who "regarded the categories, which for apriorists originate within reason, as the results of human sociality, as products of society" (1924, 184), though he stressed that, to his mind, Durkheim did not effect the compromise between apriorists and empiricists that he claimed to have provided, for he only explained the origin but not the validity of the categories (ibid., 186). Jerusalem also agreed with Durkheim's conception of collective representations as vehicles for the social that, much like the social itself, were not independent of their manifestation in individuals but remained irreducible to them.54 Yet Jerusalem also in effect offered, in his theory of cognitive development (which was developed wholly independently of Durkheim), a more differentiated theory of what these collective representations were.55 Moreover, Jerusalem's own sociolog- ical rendition of his previous theory of cognitive development under the heading of "sociology of cognition" may be thought of as his alternative to Durkheim's attempt to explain the social origin of basic categories of human thought.56 In place of Durkheim's plainly obscure account of the causal origination of these categories by the social order itself, Jerusalem offered at least the beginnings of a mechanism (or set of mechanisms), namely social solidification. Between Jerusalem's first use of the term' Verdichtung ' in 1897 and its integration into his theory of cognitive development by 1899 and the first use of the 53 "Only once humans emerge from the herd, once they become individuals, do they begin to create more precise instruments of thought. ... In this the most significant alteration in the nature of man is due to the social differentiation by the ever increasing division of labour." (1909a [1925a, 146]) In his Preface to his edition of Lévy-Bruhl he wrote, referring to the period before Durkheim had reviewed his 1909 paper: "I had already become familiar with the works of the French school of sociologists led by Durkheim and recognized how closely their point of view was related to mine. It was especially the works of Hubert, of, Mauss, and those by Durkheim himself, which provided me with rich instruction and stimulation." (1921, v) This suggests (as does a passage in 1924, 184) that he had been aware of Durkheim and Mauss (1903) for some time though it does not indicate since when exactly. But Jerusalem did not have an infallible grasp of the details of the Durkheim school: Lévy-Bruhl was not a student of Durkheim's, contrary to Jerusalem's assertion (1924, 186). 54 See Durkheim ( 1 898). Although they play a large role there, collective representations do not appear as such in central passages of Durkheim and Mauss ( 1 903) - though "states of the collective mind" do (ibid., 85) - but they do so in Durkheim (1912 [1915, 16, 436-4381). 55 Significantly, Jerusalem speaks of the typical ideas of early man as "collective representations" only in (1924, 187-188), but not in (1909a). However, that Jerusalem earlier picked up on the Durkheimian idea of collective representations is suggested by his mention of not only Mauss but also Hubert in his recollection (1921a, v). Henri Hubert and Mauss had published "certain seminal observations on time and space which are direct precursors of the [Durkheim-Maussl essay on classification {Année sociologique , vol. V, 1902, p. 248)" (Needham 1963, xxix-xxx). 56 See Durkheim and Mauss (1903 [1963, 85)) and Durkheim (1912 [1915, 440)). That Durkheim's explanation fails is widely acknowledged; see, e.g., Needham (1963) or Bloor (1982), and not that Schmaus's critique of Bloor's interpretation of Durkheim does not dispute this point (1994, 66, 259-260; cf. his 2000). Springer</page><page sequence="27">Wilhelm Jerusalem's "sociology of cognition" in context 31 term' soziale Verdichtung ' signifying the inception of his sociology of cognition in 1909, stand two significant events: not only did Jerusalem's become acquainted with the work of Simmel, but he also (perhaps previously) came in contact with Durkheim' s and Mauss's study of primitive classification. Their speculations concerning the role of the social in generating the categories of logical thought most likely prompted Jerusalem's own socialisation of Verdichtung by way of a sophisticated response. Soziale Verdichtung , by working through the previously delineated three developmental stages, provided an alternative to Durkheim' s suggestions of social effervescence as a mechanism for the emergence of the categories So while there exists an undeniable family resemblance between their theories, Jerusalem's differs significantly - and was meant to do so - from Durkheim' s when he developed it. In light of Durkheim's appreciation of Jerusalem's 1909 paper one may even go further and speak of a mutual influence between them. We must note, however, that Durkheim qualified his "in principle" acceptance of Jerusalem's thesis with some criticisms. One of these was that its author underestimated the social nature of science. For Durkheim, science was "an eminently social matter," first, because "it is the product of an overt cooperative effort," second, because "it presupposes certain methods and techniques that are the creation of an authoritative tradi- tion, "and third, because its ideas "dominate all thought and seemingly condense - clarify by categories - the whole of civilization" (1910 [1980, 109]). That the first and third of these criticisms fail to engage with Jerusalem's thought and the use to which he put the notion of social solidification already in his 1909 paper is evident. Indeed, were it not for Durkheim's review, one would be tempted to claim that three important points for the sociology he raised in Les Formes élémentaires de la vie religieuse derived from his study of Jerusalem's paper: the thought that in collective experiences is contained "all that wisdom and science which the group has accumulated" (1912 [1915, 435]), the recognition that language and concepts play an essential role in mediating collective representations (ibid., 432-434), and that to the emergent logical way of thinking corresponds "a social life of a new sort" (ibid., 445). (Certainly neither of these ideas found expression in Durkheim's study with Mauss.)57 This is not to discount the validity of Durkheim's second criticism that Jerusalem's sociology of cognition lacks an account of the internal institutional workings of science. Yet neither should Jerusalem's aforementioned criticism of Durkheim's mistaken sympathy for aprioricist philosophy be discounted nor his criticism of Lévy-Bruhl's failure to explain the development from "primitive" to scientific thought (1924, 186-187). As the evidence stands, it would appear to remain justified to speak of a mutual influence between Durkheim and Jerusalem. Conclusion Jerusalem saw his task in "investigating the origin, the reach, the realm of validity, and the true meaning of the sociological determination of thought" (1924, 57 Pickering (2000a, b, 16) also noted the novelty of the first of these points in Durkheim (1912). Springer</page><page sequence="28">32 T. Uebel 182-183). It is clear by now that neither his questions nor his answers are shared by most sociologists of knowledge today. Yet as argued earlier, given his interest in the development of pre-scientific facts (the latter understood in the sociological sense) and the evolutionary pre-history of objectivity, it may be argued that Jerusalem was a pioneer of the sociology of knowledge more broadly understood. What we can add now is that one thing of particular interest about Jerusalem's sociology of cognition is its context in the early history of sociology as an independent discipline. Emerging from the crisscrossing streams of nineteenth century philology and language theory on the one hand and early social and evolutionary psychology on the other, Jerusalem built on elements of Durkheim' s sociology and Simmel's early works. Like Durkheim and Simmel - and also like Lazarus (though neither Durkheim nor Jerusalem noted this) - Jerusalem was concerned to explore the distinctive nature of the social and its indispensable yet irreducible contribution to human life. Unlike Simmel who sought to exhibit the distinctive and all-pervasive workings of the social in the most varied aspects of the culture of modernity, Jerusalem even more so than Durkheim turned to the distant past to show the constitutive role of the social, looking to ethnology for evidence about the genesis of scientific thought and its psycho-social preconditions. Yet Jerusalem was not wholly concerned with the past. Jerusalem also raised the issues of knowledge by testimony and the cooperative nature of science. Unfortunately he raised the issue of testimony only to point out its actuality first in the course of epistemological discussions (1899a, 80-81) and later recognize it, alongside he social nature of science, as a "banal triviality" that furnished the background for his anthropological exploration (1909a [1925a, 141]). (What Jerusalem did not make explicit was that knowledge by testimony may be considered another type of social solidification, even though he got close to it when he stated repeatedly that "[o]bjective truths must become social solidifications because only then can they have consequences" (1909a [1925, 152]).) Clearly, the two issues Jerusalem considered trivial have since moved to center-stage in contemporary social epistemology and the sociology of knowledge, while what he emphasized (the essentially social nature of language and social dependency of thought) has long since become, albeit independently of him, the default position in philosophy and social science. Returning to our earlier query we may note that the complementary criticisms of his deployment of the notions of objective truth and social solidification by sociologists and philosophers suggest that already Jerusalem had arrived at the crossroads for the sociology of knowledge as we know it, the controversial distinction between rational and social causes. In his comparison of mythical and scientific belief formation such a contrast seems presupposed (certainly Fleck read him as a straight philosopher), but many contemporary sociologists of knowledge would deny that such a distinction can be drawn at all. (This is shown, in albeit very different ways, by the well-known conceptions of Mannheim as well as Fleck and the post-Mertonians.)58 But maybe Jerusalem deserves some interpretive charity 58 Prior to more recent post-Mertonians only Reck spent much time on the shaping of the perceptual sensibilities of experimental scientists. This marks him out in the classical period of the discipline and â Springer</page><page sequence="29">Wilhelm Jerusalem's "sociology of cognition" in context 33 here. The very ambiguity of his account of social solidification may point us instead to a challenge that was left unarticulated by Jerusalem himself but already was implicit in the outlines of his account, namely that the distinction between rational and social causes is not a categorical one. (Such a rejection of the simple dichotemy of the rational and the social - along with their equally simplistic equation - is evident in the attempts made by two members of the Vienna Circle who were familiar with Jerusalem's ideas and sought to integrate certain sociological perspectives into their theories of science.)59 Are there grounds to justify this interpretive charity? In his last essay Jerusalem stated that "it will be one of the most important tasks of a future sociological theory of knowledge (soziologischen Erkenntnislehre ) to analyse the manifold forms that social solidifications take and to investigate their consequences in the different fields and areas of cognition and life" (1924, 193). So Jerusalem was not unaware then of the difficulty which his all too inclusive use of the concept of social solidifi- cation faced. That Jerusalem's soziologische Erkenntnislehre contrasted with Erkenntniskritik and thus came into line with Erkenntnistheorie (1923, 286-302) shows that his "sociologism" was philosophically informed, pointing towards a position equidistant from the traditional aprioricism concerning the tools and forms of thought and more recent sociological relativisms. Again, to be sure, Jerusalem himself did not formulate such a position. Nevertheless, having noted that "only internally independent individuals discovered the objective criterion [of truth] and thereby science was rendered possible and actual," Jerusalem continued: But we must never forget that even independent and self-determining personalities are unable to cut entirely the bonds with their social commu- nities. We know, rather, that the onesidedness which led to the division of labor increased the dependence of the individual on society and that the ever increasing complexity of organizations results in every one of its members being bound into the whole in ever new ways. The independently acting individual is no less bound by social solidifications and this holds today still of the scientifically trained man of culture. Thus it becomes understandable that the intersubjective criterion of truth retains its power alongside the objective one and continues to exercize a strong influence on the beliefs and actions of individuals. (1924, 194) Clearly, Jerusalem perceived a dialectic here that did not leave objective truth freestanding and unchallenged in the domain of scientific enquiry. Footnote 58 continued links him by anticipation to Kuhn' s idea of the central role exemplary problem solutions in the social- ization of scientists and by continuation to Jerusalem's notion of Verdichtung as a process creative of shared typical ideas and concepts. (For Fleck's own adoption of Jerusalem's conception of Verdichtung in his own account, see his (1935 [1980, 37]) where the term is rendered as social reinforcement). 59 Philipp Frank and Otto Neurath set out to explore how Duhem's underdetermination of theory by evidence - a phenomenon not taken account of by Jerusalem - allowed social factors to play a role in the acceptance of theories; see Uebel (2000). Neurath' s distinctive addition to this consisted in placing testimony in a central place for the epistemology of science; see Uebel (2009). Springer</page><page sequence="30">34 T. Uebel In sum, having explained the origin of concepts like truth and objectivity, Jerusalem's sociology of cognition did not address the social dimension of their employment once they were in place. This made it the perfect stepping stone for more familiar versions of the sociology of knowledge that self-consciously pursued a demarcation dispute with philosophy over who correctly dealt with the processes and products of intellectual labor. To return to our starting point: if Jerusalem had not existed, Fleck would have had to invent him. Since he did exist, all Fleck needed to do was to caricature him.
