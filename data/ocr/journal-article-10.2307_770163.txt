Coburg House, New St John's Road, St Helier, Jersey, JE2 3LD, Channel Islands SOLLY ZUCKERMAN was born on 30 May 1904 and died following a heart attack almost 89 years later, full of honours and though becoming frail, still at work. I was moved along by one accident after another with little or no idea of who I was or of what I would become and with little notion of what the morrow would bring. Up to the time of the Second World War I should have laughed if anyone had suggested that in the years ahead I would become involved in public events. Both sides of his family had come to South Africa from Eastern Europe in the 19th century. His father ran a furniture business in Cape Town. He was a gentle and unambitious man who demanded little. His mother, on the other hand, was a busy taskmistress who was always wanting more from a boy who was aloof, uninterested and reserved. School had to be survived and organized games were disliked. His substitute was mountaineering and this activity led to his observing the social behaviour of the troops of baboons that he encountered on his climbs and hence to his earliest and constantly recurring scientific interest. His unexpected success in examinations gave him the top prize scholarship and entry to the University where he registered as a medical student. In those days it was impossible to do one's clinical training locally and the resources to cover a visit to England were not immediately available. To save money for the journey he took a job as a demonstrator in the Anatomy Department and undertook two years of research based on a detailed examination of the baboon material in the Department. In particular he concerned himself with the growth process which transforms the shape of the young baboon's skull to the adult shape. With further scholarship funds he set off for London and hospital work in 1925. Fortune favoured him immediately he arrived in England. He was introduced to Grafton Elliott Smith ? 1995 The Royal Society 577</page><page sequence="2">,</page><page sequence="3">Biographical Memoirs who was interested in his baboon skull paper and proposed that he should submit it for publication in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society and extend his observations to the chimpanzee. Soon he was immersed in and exhilarated by an atmosphere of critical scholarship. He was also introduced to an intensely active social life in the Bloomsbury area where there were life-long friendships to be made. In due course he qualified as the doctor he never intended to be and was chosen to become Prosector or Anatomical Research Fellow at the London Zoo. He realized that the colony of baboons on Monkey Hill provided the raw material for a study of family life in captivity which could be compared with the understanding of social life in the wild which he had already achieved in South Africa. It soon became clear that the troop was organized into a series of harems headed by a dominant male and that the precedence of the mature females in the harem depended on the stage of the menstrual cycle which was indicated by the appearance of the characteristic and very visible sexual skin swelling. The male was most interested and mated more readily with whichever female had reached the stage of maximum swelling which occurred mid-cycle. It seemed probable that ovulation was taking place at this time and evident too that he must acquire more detailed information about the monkey's reproductive physiology. More good fortune led him to meeting A.S. Parkes (later Sir Alan Parkes, F.R.S.) and G.F. Marrian (later F.R.S.) in 1928 and a collaborative and intensive histological programme on the material from deaths on Monkey Hill began. There followed a series of papers '4 6, 7* bringing together all the available information from as many species as possible to explain the homologies between oestrous and menstrual cycles. Whereas the lower mammals only mated at the time of oestrus that was induced by the increasing secretion of oestrogen by the growing ovarian follicle, monkeys did not have a clear cut restricted period of oestrus but had outward markers of maturing follicular growth in the sexual skin swelling or colouration. The first papers were reviews of existing knowledge followed by more detailed observations on the behaviour and histological changes in the female reproductive cycles especially in baboons on Monkey Hill and in the wild in South Africa where he had returned in 1930 to collect specimens. At the same time he was finishing the Social Life of Apes and Monkeys5. He sent the manuscript to the Liverpool zoologist Mrs R.C. Bisbee who had been an inspiration to him in Cape Town. He ruefully writes 'she was tireless and ruthless in her criticism. Draft after draft would come back scored through and often with sarcastic comment'. Solly's colleagues and pupils agree that this attitude to manuscripts was so impressed on him that they were subjected to similar treatment in later years. They agree with him too that there is no better way to make one' s writing clear to the reader. The Social Life of Apes and Monkeys was published in 1932 and has become a forerunner in the study of primatology. A new edition with a new foreword and postscript appeared as recently as 1981, some 50 years after its first appearance. In it he defends his original positions and criticizes vigorously the anthropomorphic attitudes of later students of primate behaviour. He also set about collecting for the first time all the information about physiological parameters amongst the various primates. The differences and similarities between species were set out and made available for comparisons of taxonomic and phylogenetic relationships. This compilation was published in 19338. *Numbers in this form refer to entries in the bibliography on the accompanying microfiche. 578</page><page sequence="4">Solly Zuckerman The suggestion came from Professor John Fulton in 1932 that he should consider taking a post at a new Institute to be set up under the direction of Robert Yerkes, to study the behaviour of the Great Apes. His meeting with Yerkes indicated that they were likely to be incompatible and after a short stay in Florida, where the station was being developed, the proposal came to an end, as did another suggestion that he should take a Chair of Anatomy at Harvard University. Finally a Rockefeller Research Fellowship allowed him to continue in Fulton's department at Yale for another year and to enjoy himself at weekends in New York where friends were to be made and he was to find himself the only scientist among a galaxy of artistic talent. Then he began to worry about his future career. The Chair of Anatomy in Peking, which was supported by the Rockefeller Foundation was vacant and Elliott Smith wanted him to take it. But by this time Solly had become more of an experimental physiologist and less an anthropologist interested in fossils and their relations as possible ancestors of man. An appointment to a Beit Research Fellowship became available and he returned to England to follow Le Gros Clark to his new Department of Human Anatomy in Oxford in 1934. While he had been in the U.S.A. he had spent much effort trying to establish specific nervous pathways controlling or influencing the reproductive cycles and the production of sex hormones. Surgical expertise and much information about the distribution of the autonomic nerves in the pelvis resulted but though he continued with the effort on arrival in Oxford the attempt was confounded by non-specific influences and the problem was finally abandoned. 9 10 This period before the war was the classical Golden Age of Endocrinology and Reproductive Physiology. The steroid hormones were being isolated, their structure elucidated and pure preparations made available. The control of reproductive activity by the anterior lobe of the pituitary also became clear. An outstanding group in the U.S.A. notably Edgar Allen, George Comer (later For.Mem.R.S.) and Carl Hartman were laying the groundwork for greater understanding. Solly's previous studies had concentrated on the histological changes taking place during the normal menstrual cycle. He had shown that ovulation was a mid-cycle phenomenon. Using the pure sex hormones now available he sought to reproduce the normal cycle in spayed monkeys by appropriate regimes of oestrogen and progesterone. 13, 14, 15The sensitivity of the endometrium to varying dosage and combinations of hormones was established 21-23 and inherent cyclical variations in overall responsiveness to oestrogens identified and ascribed to the modulating influence of adrenal cortical hormones. 31-34 The profound cyclic effects of oestrogens on water metabolism in species with large sexual skin swellings were also demonstrated. 19, 20, 30 Pure androgens had become available and the effects on the ovary and the cycle were studied. Male hormone administration might lead to amenorrhoea, to inhibition of ovulation, the absence of large growing follicles. The impression was gained that male hormone might stimulate the formation of new small follicles (see later for post-war developments in this area). Together with A.S. Parkes the effects of hormones on the prostate were studied in the hope that they might help in understanding factors leading to benign enlargement of the gland in Man. 11, 12, 15-17 The monkey gland contains an embryonic rudiment, a uterus masculinus. It was thought that this might grow if stimulated by unbalanced amounts of female hormone and that an enlargement might, therefore, be treatable with androgen. A form of hypertrophy also occurs in dogs and this too was looked into. 18 It does not appear that he was concerned with questions of malignant hypertrophy at that time and the idea of treating prostatic growths with androgen never fulfilled its promise. The work led to a long review paper on 579</page><page sequence="5">Biographical Memoirs the histogenesis of tissues sensitive to oestrogens which implied that remnants of the Mullerian system responded with a glandular proliferation while Wollfian tissues behaved like the vagina with a cornified epithelial proliferation. A landmark in the development of reproductive physiology was the Singer-Polignac Conference on sex hormones in Paris in 1937, arranged by Courrier, to which Solly was invited. He reported his findings on simulating the menstrual cycle 24 and summarized the incomplete work on the influence of nervous stimuli on normal cyclicity. 25 On the way home some of the participants considered starting a Journal of Endocrinology. Ten of them guaranteed the necessary funds. The first number appeared in 1939 with Sir Charles Dodds, F.R.S. as Editor, and it is hard to imagine a worse time for the first appearance of a specialist journal. It did, however, survive the war and in 1948 Solly became Editor and by obtaining contributions especially from his newly expanding department in Birmingham the journal kept afloat and eventually flourished. He remained Editor until the Journal was taken over by the newly formed Society for Endocrinology that owed its start to his active support. There are only a few survivors of that pre-war period who can recall their impressions of the young man. Dr L. Goodwin, F.R.S. later to be closely involved with him at the Zoo first met him in 1935-37 while doing a physiology course at University College London. 'We got a series of lectures from SZ - an almost incoherently enthusiastic young man who danced around and told us doubtful stories about the sexual cycles and activities of baboons. None of us guessed at the time what a breakthrough it was'. Lord Healey was an undergraduate at Oxford and he remarks 'I listened to Solly Zuckerman on the social applications of hormone research. I had heard a lot about Solly's brilliance. He had already made his name with his book on the Social Life of Monkeys. As always he was spell-binding that evening'. Professor J.Z. Young, F.R.S. remembers him when he first came to Oxford in 1934. 'We collaborated then on a study of certain details of the dorsal nerve roots of monkeys and published a paper together. He had a wide knowledge of the techniques needed for anatomical studies. He was a good surgeon and I learnt from him the complicated techniques needed for experiments on the mammalian brain and spinal cord'. The following year was a disturbing one in which his research productivity was at a peak and his contribution to reproductive physiology recognized. The University of Birmingham had offered him the Chair of Anatomy. He was very hesitant but Birmingham was determined to have him and regarded him as 'titular' head until the war finished. As Michael Abercrombie told Professor Eayrs, then a student at the University and later Solly's successor 'He is a high flyer' and he spoke with awe about 'this wizard that the University was hoping to recruit'. It took the Munich Agreement to start him on the path that was to lead him away from the orthodox track of a research scientist. He and Bernal wrote 'Science and National Defence' emphasizing the special skills and attitudes of scientists that could be applied to the needs of defence. Later this interest led to the production of a Penguin Special on Science in War which was published in 1940 with contributions from many of his fellow members of the Tots and Quots dining club. He was responsible for editing the volume and for an anonymous editorial in Nature at the time of publication. In the midst of the turmoil at the start of the war he married Lady Joan Rufus Isaacs, daughter of the Marquess of Reading. 580</page><page sequence="6">Solly Zuckerman INVOLVEMENT IN THE WAR EFFORT Beral had been invited by the Ministry of Home Security Research Department to study the physical effects of bombing on buildings and he proposed that Solly should look into the effects of high explosive on humans. The official view of human vulnerability was then much influenced by anecdotal information from the Spanish civil war. The first experiments in which animals were exposed to blast were carried out in the Winter of 1939 and extended throughout the next two years. He was soon involved in controversy with the MRC who claimed responsibility for any such work. They had to be convinced too that the effects of exposure to blast were not mediated through the nasal passages and bronchi nor as a result of the suction wave which follows the first positive pressure wave but by the impact of the wave on the chest wall. By using animals of differing sizes it was possible to develop an empirical relationship between body weight and the overall pressure needed to kill an animal or to cause minimal haemorrhagic damage to the lung.35 36 Extrapolating this relationship up to Man produced a figure for the LD 50 high enough to make it clear that the direct effects of the blast wave would only be found very close to an explosion where the dangers from other effects were much greater - either from fragments of the bomb itself or from broken glass, or from being thrown or crushed by falling debris. Bernal had been calculating the size of the weapon from the damage caused to surrounding buildings. It was obvious sense to survey, at the same time, the position and fate of all human beings involved. Yates provided suitable statistical methods and produced an index of weapon effectiveness - the standardized casualty rate which took into account the distance everyone had been from the point of impact. The first air raids showed that fragments from the bomb casing as small as 50 mgm could cause incapacitating injury. The Ordnance Board did not take account of the wounding power of such small fragments and were therefore disregarding much of the effectiveness of those weapons such as cast-iron mortar bombs which broke up into many smaller fragments than did the steel casings of artillery shells. 29 Zuckerman recruited a small team of medically qualified personnel who concentrated on the biological effects of blast and the wounding power of fragments. The report on this work was a classic example of the development of new techniques and analytical methods to meet the requirements of urgent problems. Miss Vidal-Hall, his personal assistant in Oxford at the time, remarks Solly's vitality was astonishing. I do not know how much sleep he managed to fit in but in view of his normal programme it cannot have been much. From 1940-41 onwards his visits to London became increasingly frequent. He would set off to drive up the old road to London including the notorious long and narrow stretch through High Wycombe. He soon worked out a time schedule for the different stages of the journey and, if he fell behind, drove fast and furiously to catch up. After an extended day of meetings and discussions he would drive back to Oxford, have supper and often ask me to go round and do some work with him. At about 10 p.m. he would break off, announcing that he would now go round to the laboratory in the Anatomy Department to do some experimental work to 'relax'. Statistics and reports were often required urgently so there were late night sessions involving the unit as a whole sometimes lasting until dawn. There was no side about him. If, for instance, the typists could not cope with the load of work, he would sit down and bang away on his rather primitive typewriter. He certainly drove himself harder than he drove us. Above all he managed to 581</page><page sequence="7">Biographical Memoirs communicate to us his enthusiasm and his own sense of excitement as untrodden paths of research opened up. Finally he had an outstanding virtue as a 'chief' - he would delegate freely to anyone he trusted while being ready to help sort out any errors that might be made. By the summer of 1941 he and Beral had been invited by Mountbatten to serve as scientific advisers to COHQ. This was the start of a close relationship with Mountbatten leading to a friendship of two seemingly diverse personalities which blossomed in the post- war years when Mountbatten was Chief of the Defence Staff and Zuckerman once more his scientific adviser. Tasks of all sorts were thrown at him. Some could be handled by the unit in Oxford, others he had to handle himself. He was asked to prepare a bombing plan for a proposed attack on Alderney. No one knew what was needed to 'neutralize' a gun battery but by making reasonable assumptions about the number of sorties needed to provide a concentration of bombs per acre he worked out a plan for the attack. The assault never took place but the experience was of value when he was asked for a similar plan for the reduction of the garrison of the island of Pantellaria before the invasion of Sicily. Meanwhile he had responsibility for a survey of the consequences of air attacks on Birmingham and Hull, both on structures and the population. It was hoped that the information would serve to indicate what might be expected when large RAF attacks on German targets began. A preliminary report was taken out of context by Lord Cherwell, Churchill's personal adviser, and used to justify a campaign of intensive bombing of German cities. It was said that the available tonnage of bombs would seriously affect morale and bring industrial production to a halt. In fact there was no evidence in the final report to show that either morale or production in the two cities had been significantly affected by the German raids. In January 1943 Zuckerman and Bernal left for the Middle East to see what lessons could be learnt from the air attacks which had failed to prevent the escape of the Axis forces after the battle of El Alamein. Bernal was called away almost as soon as they arrived in Egypt. This left Zuckerman on his own and he went to Tripoli hoping to be able to compare the damage done, as detailed in Italian records, with the supposed damage claimed by the RAF on the basis of photo-reconnaissance. The result was discouraging but at least led to alterations to the fusing of the bombs. In May he returned to the Middle East and was given the opportunity to carry out for the first time a controlled experiment in the use of air power, to prepare a bombing plan for the reduction of Pantellaria without the need for ground troops. For the first time a military operation was directly controlled by a scientist who had the authority to give instructions to the air forces. The plan succeeded and the island surrendered. The successful conclusion of the experiment established his reputation and earned him the complete support of the Commander of the Air Force, Tedder, for extending the method of assessment to future targets in Italy. After the invasion of Sicily a large team was assembled to report on the effects of allied attacks on airfields, roads, shipping, ferry terminals and the railway network. The results convinced him and Tedder that railway targets were the single most important objective for the use of air power. Thus Lord Tedder in his autobiography says 'one lesson of real importance we began to learn. Concentrated precise attack upon railway targets scientifically selected would probably produce a degree of disruption and immobility which might make 582</page><page sequence="8">Solly Zuckerman all the difference between success and failure. I had complete confidence in Zuckerman's knowledge and judgement. It was a fortunate day when he was sent to the Mediterranean. His services were of incalculable value'. He returned to England to prepare for the invasion of France. There followed an intense struggle between him, still regarded by many as that 'Professor of Anatomy', and Bomber Command which wished to continue relentlessly with their area attacks on centres of population. The story has often been told and it is now generally accepted that the final decision to concentrate on the railways and to involve Bomber Command in the attacks was the right one. All the surveys after the war and the German railway records confirmed the conclusion that the assaults on the railway centres had virtually paralysed the entire system, and much of the credit must go to Zuckerman. THE ANATOMY DEPARTMENT, UNIVERSITY OF BIRMINGHAM So the war was finished and he was free to return to his academic life. He had no wish to leave Oxford but it was clear that scope for his work would be severely restricted in the Department of Anatomy. So it was that after receiving assurances of support in building up a new department in Birmingham he finally became active rather than titular head of the Department of Anatomy there. His new department was spacious but virtually without equipment or animal accommodation. The budget was ?5500 and there were three academic staff and three technicians. He rapidly recruited staff from among his wartime colleagues and, fully supported by the Medical Faculty, he set about the creation of an active research department which 15-20 years later had a staff of 125. While the plans for expansion were developing he reorganized the pre-clinical curriculum. He drastically curtailed the time spent in the dissecting room learning anatomical detail and began a project for a new anatomy textbook to accompany the new course. The final text was published in 1961. He emphasized the importance of radiological anatomy and a fully equipped x-ray unit was installed together with a radiologist. Before long steroid chemists and psychologists had been recruited as well. He wanted to improve the preclinical teaching in other ways too. He tried to interest the Physiology Department into integration of the two departments so that courses would include coordinated lectures on structure and function by members of both Departments54. The idea may seem commonplace now but at the time it was way ahead of attitudes and the proposals, though acquiesced in, met with no enthusiasm in the Physiology Department. But his most far reaching innovation was the course in which a small number of medical students who had completed their preclinical studies were invited to spend a year in the department before going on to clinical work. Up to 4 or 5 students were apprenticed to members of the staff, were treated as junior members of the department and spent the year on a research problem that was of interest to their tutor and themselves. Distinguished scientists were invited to give them seminars and they produced a thesis at the end of the year embodying the results of their work. Success in an enterprise such as this depends not only on the dedication of the students but on the willing cooperation of the tutors. Here his inspirational leadership ensured a successful outcome. As the years went by more than 100 students profited from the course. The results showed that undergraduates in the right environment and properly cared for can 583</page><page sequence="9">Biographical Memoirs do good research work and the number of published papers is a mark of the success of the scheme. Inevitably his new commitments and the work he was already undertaking in Whitehall limited the amount of time that he could devote to 'hands on' work at the bench and he depended on his colleagues for much of the actual experimental results. But it was he who formulated the problems, set out the ways of tackling them and found the money and technical help. There were three widely disparate fields on which he concentrated. Oogenesis Before the war he and others had tacitly assumed that new oogonia were formed in each reproductive cycle and then developed further into oocytes and follicles. This view had replaced the earlier opinion that the ovary was endowed with a fixed number of germ cells at the time of birth and that these were gradually used up during the lifetime. Further it was believed that the germinal epithelium covering the surface of the ovary was truly germinal in character. He had tentatively concluded before the war that treatment of monkeys with androgen increased the number of oocytes and he thought that such treatment might be a way of prolonging the reproductive lifespan. As it turned out this hope was not realized. A very extensive series of experiments with Dr Anita Mandl 37 42-46, 50, 52 showed that the number of oocytes was not influenced by the presence or absence of the germinal epithelium and further that there was an inverse exponential relationship between age and numbers of oocytes. He became convinced that Waldeyer's original belief that oogenesis was restricted to a period in embryonic life was correct and he put forward his evidence at the 1951 Laurentian Hormone Conference. It is now clear that oogenesis unlike spermatogenesis is not a continuing process throughout life. Primate Evolution The discovery of new fossil remains in South Africa brought him back to his earlier interest in the origins of Man. He was especially critical of those who thought that the eye was sufficient to decide whether differences in size and shape between fossil Man and moder apes could be called significant and to contribute to views on the evolution of Man. Rigorous statistical analysis of precise measurements was required and his close friendship with Yates and the Rothamsted team of statisticians provided the necessary expertise. Indices that could be used to characterize the shape of the skulls or pelves of fossils, apes and monkeys were used to show in what respects the three differed or were similar. One of the consequences of the work, 38-41 47-9 in which the late Professor E. Ashton played a large part, was an embittered relationship with Le Gros Clark that was never resolved. His plea for disciplined analysis in the fields of physical anthropology and palaeontology has gone largely unheard. Yet his influence has convinced his students and in turn their students to continue on the same path despite the indifference of other workers. 584</page><page sequence="10">Solly Zuckerman Hypothalamic/Pituitary relationships His third topic was the control of the anterior lobe of the pituitary by nuclei in the hypothalamus which secreted releasing factors that were transferred through the portal vascular system. Work by G.W. Harris, F.R.S. indicated that direct access between the hypothalamus and the hypophysis was necessary if the pituitary's response to stimulation was to be retained. SZ brought to the controversy preparations in which, he believed, there was an impenetrable barrier between the two organs. Nevertheless the early onset of oestrus after exposure to light was not prevented. 53 55. 56 He emphasized, perhaps too vigorously, the logical importance of even a single observation which contradicts a previously accepted hypothesis. The differences between the Birmingham workers and Harris's group which came to a head at a Ciba Foundation Symposium in 1964 were never explained and despite a rearguard action by him the endocrinological world has come down in Harris's favour. Professor Bernard Donovan who worked with Harris comments Zuckerman's contribution to the whole problem was directly very small, for the Birmingham studies have led nowhere. Indirectly though they triggered a considerable amount of work and generated a much needed re-evaluation of the field. He was a sceptic who demanded attention and was right in being critical over the highly specific nature of the releasing factors, though it has become clear that the story is more complicated than those working in the field at the time imagined. THE UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR IN BIRMINGHAM AS SEEN BY COLLEAGUES AND STUDENTS In recollections of him when he was leading the Birmingham Anatomy Department several facets of his personality are emphasized over and over - his speed in reaching the core of a problem, his interest in individuals and his willingness not only to discuss their ideas and aspirations but actively to foster their careers. Dr Anita Mandl, his close collaborator in all the work on oogenesis recalls the high standard of what is now called accountability. If you reported a finding it had to be repeatable and the evidence had to be watertight. He was a past- master at delegating and he demanded, and commanded, great loyalty. He was quite terrific in the early post-war years at the B.Sc. students' seminars. He spotted flaws in argument, evidence or logic with incredible speed and sure touch. He would sum up, tear up (with charm and good humour) and then rebuild from the ruins. He did not like to be on bad terms with people. He was always showing signs of being interested in people around him. 'What makes a person tick?' He would ask. He discovered that one member of the research staff was a committed Catholic and immediately asked 'Is he really unhappy about research on contraception?' He had the gift of being able to talk to anyone about anything at their own level whether it was the man in charge of the dissecting room, the photographic technician or the lady responsible for cleaning his room and keeping his white coat clean. Sir Richard Harrison, F.R.S. says of him: He appointed me or got me involved in almost everything I have really enjoyed in my life even into an enquiry into the Loch Ness Monster, which latter incident was responsible for my second marriage. I recall playing golf one afternoon and being called by the Secretary, to be told that some madman had phoned to say that a helicopter would land at the Club to take me with SZ to collect a whale for 585</page><page sequence="11">Biographical Memoirs the London Zoo from a desolate island in Scotland where it was stranded, and would I tell the same madman that the Club was not in favour of such unwanted advertisement. Professor Gabriel Horn, F.R.S., Master of Sydney Sussex College, Cambridge recalls: When I was coming to the end of my clinical training and had decided that my future should be in the academic world, I made an appointment to see him late one Friday afternoon. Solly was a man of considerable influence who did not forget how important it was to relate kindly and compassionately to his students. With the enormous pressures on him there is no doubt that he could have filled the time with me in many other ways - and in many more important ways - but he chose not to do so. Instead he talked about a career in Anatomy, the future of the subject, the likelihood of a Chair becoming available and helped me to an appointment. Professor J.T. Eayrs, who was his successor in the Chair of Anatomy says: I, along with so many others owe him a tremendous debt in the formulation and forwarding of my career. He owed much to his rapid grasp of facts and figures and his amazing ability to pick out the important information from a mass of verbiage. He was a rotten teacher and often inarticulate but he was a good Chairman and masterly in his summing up. This quality was picked by Sir Gordon Wolstenholme who was Director of the Ciba Foundation and says of him His greatest strength lay in his ability to master a scientific brief, an almost impromptu drawing together of conclusions, not infrequently to the surprise of other participants who often failed to see where their own researches were heading. He was less impressive in presenting his own work, often doing so with surprising diffidence and his speeches on social occasions were sometimes embarrassingly poor. But no one else could compare with him in concentrating the full power of his intellect on the problems before him and bringing all the salient points into brilliant focus. Tom Spence came to the Department as a junior technician with no formal qualifications but with a determination to get on. A paper written by him describing the process of head shrinking in South America came to Solly's notice and he decided to foster Spence's development and a career which ended with a senior lectureship in the department. Spence writes From first to last in my association with Solly he always treated me with kindness and consideration. Strangely, unlike his way with some other people he never hurried me. He never talked down to me and always treated me as a social equal. Later he pressed me to apply for an official degree. The committee that considered such applications felt that I would have to take a special written paper. Solly was angry about this. He said 'Do they want blood? I should have thought that as you have gone to further education courses in subjects from English to Genetics and the fact that you have had twelve papers published would be good enough for them.' RETURN TO THE LONDON ZOO He renewed his direct connection with the London Zoo in 1955 when he was invited to join the Council. Two years later he took on the function of Secretary in the belief that it would be something of a sinecure. It could not have been farther from the truth. In effect he became Chief Executive Officer. The Zoo was already in poor shape, its buildings 586</page><page sequence="12">Solly Zuckerman dilapidated, its staff underpaid and its finances strained. He soon established that if the public were allowed into the Gardens on Sunday mornings the revenue would enormously bolster the financial position. Such a move, however, would infringe the long-standing privilege of Fellows to have Sunday mornings to themselves. Nevertheless he was determined to make the change. It caused bitter rows between supporters and objectors and the change only went through after a successful appeal in the High Court to reverse an earlier ruling in favour of dissidents. The way was then clear to modernize the Zoo, to house the animals in more suitable buildings, and to add research facilities which would allow new research in Comparative Medicine, Reproductive Physiology and Animal Welfare. These ambitious plans required money. He was an adept fund raiser and he pointed out that the Zoo was a National Landmark and about the only major Zoo in the world which did not receive government grants. Substantial amounts came from the LCC, individual donors like Cotton, Clore and Sobell as well as the Ford, Wellcome and Nuffield foundations. As soon as he became Secretary he realized that many species of animal, especially breeds with commercially less useful characteristics, were endangered. Space was available in Whipsnade Park where they could be conserved and so preserve the genetic diversity of the species. Special characteristics of no value today might prove valuable if circumstances altered. By 1959 a Breeding Policy Research Committee had been set up . The gene 'Library' was established in 1961 and April 1964 saw the publication in Nature of an article drawing attention to the new material - two breeds of cattle, seven of sheep and five of poultry. But the scientific world was uninterested. Costs were rising and by 1966 the Society was looking to transfer the stock of rare genes to the agricultural world. Finally they were dispersed to the Royal Agricultural Society of England and this, in turn, was followed by the formation of the Rare Breeds Survival Trust and the fulfilment, to some extent at least, of his original initiative. He remained Secretary until 1977 and then succeeded Prince Philip as President. It was not until 1984 that he finally retired. Dr L.G. Goodwin F.R.S., who became the first Director of the Nuffield Institute of Comparative Medicine says of him I found him a splendid boss to have. He gave me a long lead and let me get on with it. He did not want or expect to be consulted on details. I always knew where I stood with him; he was sometimes rough but usually right and never unfair. He loved the Zoo; he rescued it and gave it international recognition as a major scientific institution. The part he played and his influence were so great that it is not very surprising that, since his retirement, the institution has found it difficult to stand on its feet. Miss Shirley Deer who was his secretary at the Zoo for many years says of him: At the Zoo too he dealt with whatever was uppermost in his mind. This ranged from a memo to the Prime Minister on nuclear policy, a speech in the Lords, to a letter in support of a candidate for Royal Society Fellowship. Some of the work was even concerned with the Zoological Society. Lord Zuckerman had enormous charm but did not suffer fools gladly. I think that he was uncomfortable with people who showed that they were afraid of him. When he was 76 he was having trouble with a replacement hip as well as with his eyes. He began to be irritable and at times unreasonable, autocratic and impatient. His very long association with the Zoological Society, the fact that he gave so much time to its business tended to make him give the impression that only he knew what was best for the Society. He 587</page><page sequence="13">Biographical Memoirs became less and less prepared to take into account views other than his own. Not surprisingly one might think, considering that he had effectively saved the Society from disaster. But his behaviour led to disagreements and resignations which were regrettable and might have been avoided. INVOLVEMENT IN WHITEHALL Even before his bombing survey unit had been disbanded he found himself involved in the affairs of Whitehall from which he was never going to extricate himself. He was eager to see more use made of scientists in public affairs and he was sure that the provision of trained scientists had to be expanded if Britain was to maintain its position in the world. He was appointed to the Barlow Committee whose remit was the use and development of scientific resources particularly of manpower. An Advisory Council on Scientific Policy was also set up and before long he became the deputy chairman and remained so until the council disbanded in 1964. One of the matters raised was the best way of allocating resources to the institutions responsible for research - whether by direct grants to the universities from the UGC or via the Research Councils. At that time, and perhaps he was influenced by the differences of opinion he had with the MRC, he felt that the Councils should be restricted to the control of their own Institutes. In his autobiography he remarks with some humility 'Some years later I realized that my elders and betters had been far wiser than I on that particular subject'. The economic circumstances of the U.K. were grim and it made sense to decrease the amount of imported materials by making better use of indigenous resources. An Imports Substitutes Committee which he chaired was set up and he became aware for the first time of the complexities of agricultural policies. He became convinced of the contribution better management of the nation's grassland and the conservation of grass by means of silage or drying could make to lowering the import bill for feeding stuffs. Years later he remarked that his backing for better farm management was as important as anything else for which he was responsible. It also brought the problems of the environment to his notice. This field became a major preoccupation in his retirement. After he refused Tedder's invitation to join him in Whitehall as his scientific adviser immediately after the War, he had very little to do with Service matters for some years. The formation of NATO brought him back to the problems of Defence. Many of his old colleagues during the War were in positions of influence and when a NATO Science Committee was set up to expand scientific resources among the member states it was natural for him to become the U.K. representative. The International Institute of Science and Technology was proposed and he did his best, without much encouragement, to get the Institute sited in the U.K., but he failed. It was at a meeting of this NATO committee that he first met Rabi who was the U.S. representative. They continued to work together for many years especially over matters of nuclear policy. A programme of symposia and summer study groups was one of the successes of the committee in its attempts to foster the development of the alliance's potential. The remit of another committee was the management of government research and development. The committee concentrated on defence as the major field of government expenditure on R and D and was critical of the lack of control of expenditure. Procedures 588</page><page sequence="14">Solly Zuckerman were outlined for the better definition of operational requirements and the stage-by-stage monitoring of programmes. His involvement in the study of nuclear weapons came about slowly. As the man with the widest experience of the effects of blast he was asked by the Americans to advise them about a programme to study the effects of the much longer duration blast waves created by a nuclear explosion. A small programme was also begun in the U.K. and in Australia. Now came an invitation to stop being an amateur doing the work because it was interesting and to become a fulltime civil servant as Chief Scientific Adviser to the Ministry of Defence. After some agonizing and with reservations about his academic links he was finally persuaded by Mountbatten who had become Chief of the Defence Staff. Sir Robert Aitken was Vice-Chancellor of Birmingham at the time. He comments: Solly was a remarkable phenomenon. He could pick up an outline and at least something of the essence of a problem or situation extremely quickly. His interests, both medical, academic and political were wide, his memory capacious and his mental energy prodigious. His personal style was engaging and invigorating, a stimulus for many people although too powerful for some. Then came a government request that he should become a full-time scientific adviser to the Cabinet. He asked me if he could accept this without sacrificing his academic standing and activity. Therefore he virtually wanted two full-time jobs. The Government appointment I felt must be nationally and even internationally important. The academic one was valuable and was going well. He had the exceptional capacity and energy for both so I agreed with the anomalous arrangement. With his change in status he began a never-ending struggle to see that military and non- military R and D expenditure was controlled within affordable limits. The services demands were too big for the resources of a middle sized power and something had to be done to alter the commitments. There followed a series of battles over the R and D programmes which did not endear him to the service chiefs and led to the cancellation of such projects as the TSR 2 aircraft, the PI 1154 jump jet and rocketry. He was also the prime mover in seeking to rationalize the services needs by unification, a goal in which he fortunately had the backing of Mountbatten. There was no overall MOD strategy while the technicians kept on running weapon development ahead of military understanding and usefulness. Much of his time at the MOD was spent on the controversy over atomic weapons and the validity of their use as a deterrent. He was never a nuclear disarmer but realized that atomic weapons had deterred and could continue to deter only as long as they remained unused. If they were used control would be lost and the world as we know it ended. The military continued to believe that 'small' nuclear weapons should be designed and used as tactical weapons in a land battle. He countered this view by initiating a series of 'war games' in the operational research establishment in which the two commanders fought a battle in Europe. The outcome was total loss of control of the battle scene and complete destruction of the extended battle field and everyone in it. Throughout this period he was able to use his friendship and personal contacts with the American scientific advisers, Rabi, Wiesner, Kistiakowsky and Brown in joining efforts to stabilize the nuclear weapon build-up and, if possible, to get an agreement for a total ban on testing. This was also the wish of the Prime Minister, but his friends in the U.S.A. and he were unable to overturn the scepticism of Russian intentions shown by the American weapon designers. Years of argument led to a partial test ban treaty but at least testing was confined to underground. He was accused by the military of arguing from an emotional and 589</page><page sequence="15">Biographical Memoirs humanitarian point of view rather than from that of pure scientific advice on defence. He defended himself saying 'I may have humanitarian instincts but my concern was that the army planners were living in wonderland. It was not arrogance which made me think that I could see farther than my critics but my suspicion of conventional wisdom and the fact I knew as much, if not more, than most of them did about realities of destruction'. In October 1964 Labour won the general election and Harold Wilson asked him to join the Government as Minister of State at the Foreign Office with charge of disarmament talks. He firmly refused. His new Minister of Defence was Dennis Healey whose immediate task was to carry out a review of Defence. SZ recognized that we had to cut back our commitments to match our economic strength but felt that schemes for maintaining an effective worldwide presence which depended on the use of a chain of island airbases to support airstrike craft were unrealistic. His clash with Healey over his right to express his opinions openly based on their merit and to lobby for them made it impossible for him to remain at the MOD. He admitted that 'from his (Healey's) point of view his behaviour was intolerable'. Lord Healey says of him in his autobiography: He never hesitated to tell Mountbatten when he thought he was wrong and often succeeded in making him change his mind. He was intolerant of people he regarded as less clever than himself - a very large group - but could always be relied on to think outside the ruts in which the rest of us were too often stuck. Unfortunately Solly's mercurial nature did not make him an ideal Chief Scientific Adviser for me. He was liable to change his position without warning and to reject advice which his own staff had given me. If I did not accept his advice he would go behind my back to the other ministers for help. Instead he became Chief Scientific Adviser to the Government as a whole and left the MOD for the Cabinet Office. His influence became more generalized as the topics on which he was asked to advise widened. Thus he was involved in particular problems such as the oil spillage from the Torrey Canyon tanker and the Thames Barrage scheme, to wider issues like the future of North Sea oil where he remarks that 'my prognostications could not have been more off the mark', or the effort the U.K. should put into a space programme. Overall he continued to be concerned with the use of our scientific and natural resources, the world's expanding population and the safeguarding of the environment. THE PUGWASH MOVEMENT Solly became an important participant in the Pugwash movement which had started in 1957 and which sought to unite prominent scientists the world over in recognizing the danger posed by nuclear weapons. The forum was closed to the Press so that everyone could speak out as individuals and not as representatives. His first meeting was in 1961 and thereafter he was a regular contributor to the Pugwash Workshops on nuclear forces in Europe. He was a Trustee of the British Pugwash Trust and presided over its meetings. In 1990 he acknowledged the movement's success in bringing to fruition a treaty which helped to prevent nuclear proliferation. Dr Richard Garwin, previously Director of the IBM Watson Laboratory, first met Solly when he was a member of the President's Scientific Advisory Committee in 1962. He describes his first encounter with 'the knowledgeable, influential and irreverent man. He goaded us by example and by direct request to do something about some particular inanity and I was able to deepen his thinking on some of the more technical points of nuclear weapons or space based defence systems'. 590</page><page sequence="16">Solly Zuckerman THE WOLFSON INITIATIVE Towards the end of the 1960s it seemed that despite good science and more scientists, increased spending on research and development was not being reflected in industry's standing in the world. Solly who was a trustee of the Wolfson Foundation from 1967 to 1984 persuaded it to support projects intended to bring universities and industry closer together in development programmes. The Wolfson initiative ran for 15 years and devoted more than ?20,000,000 to the programme and by the end had stimulated other bodies to concern themselves with university/industry relations. Over 100 grants were given and the resulting industrial units have become self supporting. Though the scheme was perhaps a little in advance of the times, the grants seem to have been more successful than many of the commercial venture capital funds and have helped to remove the prejudices of academics against a career in industry. Professor Rotherham, F.R.S. who was responsible for much of the organization of the scheme writes The grants were a great help in maintaining people of high quality when direct university appointments were unavailable. My only regret was that the scheme was ended rather too soon and too abruptly. HIS CONNECTION WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF EAST ANGLIA When new universities were being established in the 1960s each had an Academic Planning Committee and he became one of the founding fathers of the University of East Anglia. Professor Thistlethwaite, the first Vice-Chancellor says I wish that I had been present at early meetings of the Academic Planning Board when Sir Solly Zuckerman (as he then was) was speculating about what a science curriculum might be at a new university. Both he and Sir Christopher Ingold, a physical chemist, were at one in the ambition to establish a widely ranging science course. In Solly's case this embraced all the natural sciences. He thought it was a great pity that there was a divorce between the natural and the physical sciences and that if this could be broken down it would be a major step. Biological students should concentrate on living systems and all natural science students should know the size of the living world. And so the first scientific discipline to be established was the School of Biological Sciences. It was the first such school in the U.K. The time was ripe for the development. Old divisions and their institutional framework were becoming obsolete and inhibiting. They should be re-grouped as undifferentiated departments or schools. In a letter to Sir Christopher Ingold, Solly wrote If one had it in mind to do something absolutely new and fresh in science I am wondering whether Norwich could not embark in its faculty of Science, on a Division of Environmental Sciences - meteorology, oceanography, geology, conservation etc. It if were, I am quite certain that nobody would ever be able to say that scientists were trained in a narrow way. Conservation would lead to the social sciences, population studies etc. and so over into the preoccupations of at any rate one sector of those who teach the humanities. In due course such a School was established and Solly's hopes fulfilled. When he retired and lived in the holiday house at Burnham Thorpe which he had remodelled during his time in Birmingham he became closely involved in the affairs of UEA. 591</page><page sequence="17">Biographical Memoirs He helped to secure funds and made use of his connections to set up seminars in which subjects like population growth, or pollution were discussed by a wide range of experts. Finally his large archive was bequeathed to the University Library together with a substantial endowment. THE WHITEHALL WARRIOR Sir Frank Cooper, Permanent Under Secretary of State at the Ministry of Defence, has this to say of him: His war-time experiences made him a persuasive advocate of the need for analysis and rationality in defence decision making. He also became very aware that, in a military environment, he needed to convert one or more influential decision makers to his way of thinking in order to ensure a sensible decision on a change of policy. Technology changes so rapidly that some weapon systems were obsolete or the counter was in sight before they were developed. Hence the drama, culminating at Nassau in 1962 - where he was a senior adviser - when the U.S. agreed to Britain having the Polaris sea launched weapon system. He played a major part in all the various arguments, always in favour of flexible systems, of not spending too much on nuclear systems and on surviveability. His relations with colleagues from America were especially important and the respect and affection in which he was held over there increased his influence. He was one of the relatively few people - at a time when the U.S. defence thinking was on a very much stronger intellectual and innovative base than anywhere in the world - who was welcome in the U.S. because of the contribution he could make to the debates there. He certainly believed that the 'men in the laboratories' and not the soldier sailor or airman, started the process of formulating military requirements. He felt that scientists had a special responsibility and a personal conscience which they needed to expose, explore and explain to others less well equipped to understand the issues. His task was to bring some cool analysis and rational argument to bear on the wide range of heated arguments about the role of the individual services in the country's external commitments. This was a virtually impossible remit. Somewhat perversely the continued use of analysis and quantitative studies probably prolonged the arguments but were particularly successful in demolishing some of the wilder claims which emerged from all three services. He did not have an easy time in the MOD. In his earlier years he was suspect because of his friendship with Mountbatten - this did not endear him either to the Army or to the RAF. Within the Ministry some took the view that he had a tendency to hold things back rather than move them forward. To the extent that there may be some truth in these assertions, none of them is to his discredit. He was there to give advice which was as far as possible non-partisan. He found considerable intellectual difficulty in producing a degree of confidence and certainty with which he was satisfied and which others were looking for. There can be no doubt that he made a quite outstanding contribution during his years in defence. He was sometimes almost the one small voice of reason in a room full of unwilling listeners. He had great skill in challenging people's thinking and of making them justify their arguments. Dr Terry Price joined him from the Atomic Energy Authority about a year after he became CSA. I immediately got the impression that he was at war with those administrators in the Civil Service whom he called the 'interpreters': people whose expertise lay not in doing for themselves but in interpreting and relaying the expertise of others. He distrusted the Scientific Civil Service believing them to be for the most part, obedient serfs, prepared to create new technological marvels without questioning their utility. 592</page><page sequence="18">Solly Zuckerman He was dazzlingly quick to grasp a point, and avoided as far as possible the painstaking and time- consuming preparations for important occasions that other men would make. The fact that Solly could continue with his own fiercely independent approach was due in no small part to his attitude to nuclear weapons. He knew a great deal about war and planning during it. His abiding impression was that however carefully one did the planning what happened thereafter was always fundamentally unpredictable. The fact that he came from the often chaotic life sciences rather than from the more deterministic world of physics was probably an important and necessary preparation. During World War II Solly had been a leading exponent of Operational Research and he was determined to take control of the operational research teams of the three Services. The tri-Service Defence Operational Analysis Centre at Byfleet stands as a legacy of his conviction that nothing is more necessary than the free exchange of objective information from wherever it can be garnered. His relations with the defence industries and their sponsors in the Services were less happy. It would have happened anyway but he was regarded by many as personally responsible for the cancellation of several weapons systems. There are those who feel that several of these systems could have been brought to success given time and application. But Solly was fundamentally sceptical about our military-industrial capabilities. Not all the service chiefs were antagonistic,thus Air Marshal Sir Christopher Hartley says: By the time I returned to the Air Ministry in June 1961 Solly was Chief Scientist MOD and an object of grave suspicion to the Service Chiefs because of his refusal to accept their statements without query. From 1962 to 1966 I sat on the Defence Research Policy Committee where Solly was chairman. It was not his fault that he arrived too late to influence some of the major errors of the 1950s, but his scrutiny of the subsequent Defence programmes put the country, not to mention the public purse, in his debt. Sir Alan Cottrell, F.R.S., his successor at the Ministry of Defence remarks: Solly in Whitehall was a thorn among the decision-makers. His role was that of fierce critic of their various plans and proposals, often using arguments of unfathomable depth and subtlety; many decisions had to be made in the teeth of his opposing advice. The incompatibility between this underlying attitude and his official position left him with only one option for his Whitehall role, that of relentless critic. At least this had one benefit; it forced the defence planners to hone their schemes to maximum intellectual sharpness in order to minimize his attacks. Dr Harold Brown, a senior American defence scientist recalls that I first met Solly in the late 1950s when I was Associate Director of the Livermore Laboratory. A resumption of cooperation between the U.S. and the U.K. on nuclear weapons development and the issue of nuclear testing were the focus of our interaction for the first two years. Concurrently Solly worked hard to move British policy towards limitation and ultimately elimination of nuclear tests as part of his strong belief that nuclear weapons were of extremely limited military and political utility while at the same time posing enormous dangers. During the Eisenhower administration I think Solly felt at home with the PSAC and with Herbert York, the Director of Defence Research and Engineering, but not with the Atomic Energy Commission people or the rest of the Defence Department. When the Kennedy Administration arrived in Washington, with Wiesner as Science Adviser, Solly's connections in Washington became even more extensive. He and Kennedy got along well and his access to Wiesner and McNamara was both deserved and substantial. His experience in operations analysis and his understanding of the limitations of nuclear weapons gave significant weight to his views. Though his expertise on specific weapons systems, nuclear and conventional did not carry the depth that comes with having designed them, his World War II experience of the gap between what is promised and what is delivered and what the system will actually accomplish in the field usually brought him out on the right side of issues like Skybolt or TSR2. 593</page><page sequence="19">Biographical Memoirs Another exceptional form of the U.K.-U.S. 'special relationship' was provided by his contact with Admiral Rickover, the father of the American nuclear-propelled fleet. In 1962 when the Royal Navy was seeking help from the Americans during the development of the British nuclear submarine programme Rickover took the highly unorthodox decision that his channel of communication would be through Solly and not through the official naval channels. Lord Dainton, F.R.S. says that: In some ways Solly's period as Chief Scientific Adviser to the government, which is when I really got to know him, gave him less satisfaction than might have been expected from the science supremo. One cause of this was his frustration that in a period of decline of the U.K. economy his views on what could and should be done through science, though courteously heard, rarely found expression in action. No scientist this century can match him in the timespan and weight of his influence on governments in peace and war. Embraced by the Establishment, he could yet stand aloof from it and be its severest critic. Not always an easy colleague and sometimes irascible in argument he could still listen attentively and patiently to a young colleague. He was truly sui generis. RETIREMENT By 1971 he was 67 and it was time to retire but this was to be no gentle relapsing into old age. Created a life peer he was given the unique distinction of retaining an office in the Cabinet Offices and there was no diminution in his activity. There were the Zoo's activies to oversee and he did not retire from his connection there until 1984. There were also his three abiding preoccupations. First, the need to bring scientists and the scientific approach into the affairs of Industry and its technological base. Second, the problems of protecting the world's environment from the consequences of pollution and over population. Above all there was his passionate advocacy of a rational approach to the control of nuclear weapons and his opposition to the Strategic Defence Initiative. On the role of scientist advisers he felt that it was not their primary function to teach their masters about science and they were unwise when they became mere propagandists for more resources for science. Their main duty was to use the scientific approach to matters which require decisions by government. They must be as dispassionate as possible and not be influenced in the advice they give by political considerations. Inevitably increasing age brought disabilities. A hip joint needed replacement and it took some time before he bounced back from a period of inertia post-operatively. His eyesight weakened and there were other medical problems but nothing was allowed to interrupt his continued interest in his chosen courses. Nobody could have hoped for a longer or more productive old age and death when it came was quick. His last major contribution to the nuclear debate before his death was published in Nature in February 1993. In an article entitled 'Prospects for a comprehensive test ban' he summarized the moves towards an international moratorium on the development and testing of nuclear weapons which had been his goal ever since he and Macmillan failed to achieve it during the Kennedy Presidency. He was cheered by the relaxation of tension brought about by the political changes in Russia which led rapidly to mutual reductions in conventional forces and emphasized the importance of dismantling nuclear arsenals as well. He detailed the differing views on the need for continued safety testing of weapons and came out strongly on the side of those who did not think that it was necessary. He was saddened by the U.K.'s failure to move forward with the other nuclear powers towards a complete test ban 594</page><page sequence="20">Solly Zuckerman and a strengthened Nuclear Proliferation Treaty. The end of the Cold War had not made the world a less turbulent place. Swords can only be turned to ploughshares with great difficulty and he ended by hoping that the nuclear enthusiasts who now stand in the way of a complete test ban could be induced to become the necessary monitors. Lord Jenkins in his address at Solly's Memorial Service remembered being dazzled by Solly's intellectual discipline and vitality, which in no way detracted from his ability immensely to enjoy himself. I always found him a loyal friend and ally although I could see that it was easier to feel affectionate towards him if he was on one's side rather than against one. What exactly were the qualities which made him such a universal adviser? The most obvious explanation would be that he had an exceptional capacity to explain one discipline to those trained in another. I do not think that it is true. In fact he was not particularly lucid. In speech more than on paper he could be quite difficult to follow. His choice of words and phrases was sometimes opaque. But he had a perceptive intuition which enabled him to go with great speed to the heart of a problem. Having got there he sometimes found it more difficult to explain how he had done so. No one, coming unknown and from far outside, ever more completely stormed every bastion of the British establishment. As a Whitehall scientific advisor he was in the unusual - and powerful - position of knowing the great world better than almost any minister he served. He never allowed the Establishment to conquer him. If anything, he got more radical, certainly more critically iconoclastic, as he got older. He was, therefore, a very remarkable man. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Lord Zuckerman outlived most of his contemporaries and many younger colleagues. I have depended on his volumes of autobiography for much that happened in pre-war years. My debt to colleagues in Birmingham and subsequently Whitehall will be abundantly clear. The frontispiece photograph was taken on 6 July 1978 by Bern Schnartz and is reproduced with permission.
