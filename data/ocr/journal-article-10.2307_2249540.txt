<plain_text><page sequence="1">IV.-PROBLEMS RAISED BY THE KANTIAN A PRIORI IN KNOWLEDGE. BY G. GALLOWAY. RATHER more than a generation ago the Kantian theory of knowledge was widely accepted by philosophical students in this country. A well-known writer concluded a volume on Kant, published in 1881, with the words: "The categories and the particulars of knowledge are therefore simply the various real relations in which intelligence manifests its acti- vity, and builds up for each of us the fair fabric of nature."' And Kant himself had declared: "We ourselves introduce into the appearance that order and regularity which we term nature."2 It is perhaps symptomatic of a change in the philosophical climate-that Prof. Whitehead, in his recent book, Science and the Modern World, lays it down that nature is a self-contained system whose mutual relations do not require the expression of the fact that they are thought about. And probably maany will now agree with him. Realism, for a time moribund, has been showing signs of a renewed vitality. There are, however, various reasons for a change of attitude, to Kant. For instance, it is clear that he tends too much to regard knowledge as a stereotyped whole, so ignoring its plastic character and its long development as a social function. Along with this, and in part explained by it, he makes as- sumptions which are psychologically untenable. Thus he takes it for granted that the knowing process begins with a mani- fold of unrelated sense-data which are somehow present in the mind. But against this it is convincingly maintained that the chaotic manifold is a false abstraction, arid for it we must substitute the psychological con-tinuum which is sub- jected to a gradual process of differentiation. Ih the circum- stances it was natural that Kant's conception of knowledge as a process of synthesis exercised on, unordered sense-data, a process which has a constitutive character, should be doubted or denied.

GALLOWAY: THE KANTIAN A PRIORl IN KNOWLEDGE. 307 It is not necessary here to state Kant's theory of know-- ledge, so I confine myself to one or two points which ought. to be kept in mind. He sometimes speaks of the a priori as the factors contributed by the mind to experience, but it is more accurately defined to be those elements which are pre-- supposed by the consciousness of self as related to an orderly world. In other words the a priori elements are involved in the structure of self-consciousness, and it is due to their function of organising experience that the ego comes to be conscious of itself as at once related to and distinguished from. objects. Just because they are implied in the structure of the conscious self these elements go to constitute our orderly world of experience which becomes an object for the mind. The a priori factor, therefore, while it is meaningless apart from experience, is not evolved from experience: its opera-- tion is presupposed by the fact that experience is an ordered and connected whole. It is true, however, that a category, taken in abstraction, would be a priori for Kant, though not constitutive, because it had merely reference to a possible experience. At the same time he holds that a priori cate- gories are constitutive in the determinate form of schematised judgments, and if we are to be accurate, it is the category schematised' in time, and expressed in judgment, which organises our world. It would now be widely admitted that space and time, re- garded as inclusive wholes, are not, as Kant supposed, forms of intuition, but are conceptual elaborations. Kant himself recognised that the space and time of experience only come to be known in and along with objects, and this really implies that the form of intuition is not to be taken in abstraction from the categorial determination. Nevertheless Kant clings to the idea that mathematics derives its certainty and neces- sity from the a priori character of space and time-intuition. Here the recent trend of mathematical thought has been decidedly against him. As Whitehead remarks, " The cer- tainty of mathematics is due to its complete abstract general- ity." 1 It deals with abstract conceptions of order and class, and from its presuppositions develops with certainty and necessity the implications of its data. Its conclusions have no necessary reference to a world extended in space and time, though, as Kant saw clearly, they are a priori in the sense that they are not empirical generalisations. The cardinal number two is not a concept generalised from the observation of pairs of things in nature and does not depend on them. o Op. cit., p. 33.</page><page sequence="3">308 G. GALLOWAY: The necessity that the angle in a semi-circle should be a right angle follows logically from the definition of the construction of a circle through its equation: its truth is not affected by the possibility that there are no real circles in nature, nor by the conclusion that the space of nature is non-Euclidean. To put it otherwise, the certainty of mathematics is due to its exhibition of logical implications or functional correspond- ences based on its definitions, and its validity is not derived from the constitution of the world of sense-perception. In fact we may generalise and say that all abstract and logical thinking which deals with universals is a priori, by which we mean that its operations and inferences flow from the general character of thought, a character which is not empirically de- rived. But conceptual processes of this kind, whose validity in no way depends on sense perception, can never be taken to constitute the specific relatedness of things in the spatio-tem- poral world. Let us now turn to consider how Kant's argument in the Transcendental Analytic fares. There it is contended that the schematised categories, expressed in judgment and all resting on the unity of apperception, are forms of synthesis which are- constitutive of our orderly experience in space and time. Unity and plurality, substance and attribute, cause and effect, are forms of synthesis logically presupposed by self- consciousness: they are the work of understanding without which there would be no objects and so no consciousness of a self in relation to objects. To put it briefly, the analytic unity of self-consciousness presupposes the synthetic unity of the manifold brought about by the intelligence. This is too familiar to need elaboration. It is noteworthy that Kant always assumes that the representation of what is combined can never be derived from sense-experience which, he believes, can only supply a chaotic manifold. This leads straight to the conclusion that the understanding makes nature, for nature is an ordered whole. There are various objections to this theory, some of which need not be urged at present. Here I desire to consider more particularly the problem of universals, and especially the question of qualities and relations as uni- versals. It is of course evident that for Kant the category as applied predicate is a universal, and goes to fashion the object to which it is referred in the act of judgment. Where does this lead ? It is easy to see that the logical conclusion of this train of thought is the reduction of the object to a system of uni- versals. The substance to which attributes are referred, since it is a category of the understanding, is itself a uni-</page><page sequence="4">THE KANTIAN A PRIORI IN KNOWLEDGE. 809 versal, and can confer no specific individuality on the object. The result is, to use the words of Bradley, that "all the qualities of the ostensible subject pass into the condition of a universal connexion of attributes ". The inevitable corollary is that the ostensible subject becomes a mere appearance, and the true subject of all predicates is the absolute Individual or Reality. Yet to say that the true meaning of every judg- ment is the reference of an ideal content to reality is certainly not what we intend in most judgments, and it ignores the practical and specific interest we have in making any given judgment. Our purpose and interest in judging is not to refer to reality in general but to some special aspect or feature of reality. Moreover, if all the contents of the pheno- menal world are merely adjectives which qualify the one Real, it is inexplicable why the mind comes to be confronted with a plurality of objects which seem to have a character and individuality of their own. Perhaps it may be objected that Kant is not committed to the conclusions of speculative idealism, because he usually assumes that sense-affection points to something beyond itself, and there is a Ding an sich in the background. And it is plain that in his Refutation of Idealism he was much concerned to differentiate his own standpoint from that of Berkeley. He seeks to do this by showing that inner experience as the consciousness of succes- sion in time is only made possible by the reality of outer experience, which supplies the permanent and co-existent in time. To put it generally, inner experience is a development which presupposes outer experience as its basis. But after going over again Kant's own words in the Refutation and the Preface to the second edition of the Kritik, I cannot help feeling that he does not face the issue quite fairly, and there is an ambiguity in his statemeents. At one point he argues that this permanent must be due to a thing outside me, and not to mny representation of such a thing.' Here one concludes he has the' thing in itself 'in view. On the other hand it is obvious that on his own theory substance as the permanent in time is a category of the understanding, and so does not belong to the 'thing in itself'. If so, then Kant does not show, what he ought to have shown, that mind which schematises its categories in the form of inner sense or time could, in terms of its inner process, possess the idea of a per- manent in outer experience in contrast to which it could reach the idea of itself as a centre of inner experience. Kant evades this difficulty by referring to something which is not I 'Kritik, ed. Kehrbach, p. 209.</page><page sequence="5">310 G. GALLOWAY: a mere representation. The trouble is that he thus implicitly casts a burden on the 'thing in itself' which that colourless residuum is incapable of sustaining. The problem with which Kant was here struggling is important, and it meets us in other forms of idealism. For -instance, one cannot find in Lotze and in Ward a satisfying explanation of the permanence of co-existing elements in outer experience in terms of their own idealism. Thus Lotze states that the relation of between which connects a and b is only for consciousness, and so far as it exists objectively the relation stands for the reciprocal influence which they exert on one another.' This view, it seems to me, is only super- -ficially plausible because it tacitly presupposes that a and b, regarded as interacting, are already presented as co-existing. A like difficulty is involved in Ward's endeavour to interpret co-existence in space in terms of a monadistic idealism. We agree with him that our conceptual space has its precursor and condition in the much more elementary experience of extensity, which is connected 'with the body and its qualita- tive differences of 'local signi'. But while this is important psychologically, the epistemological problem of what is im- plied in the feeling of extensity remains. We have to ask how the individual experient, whose inner life has only protensity or duration, can evolve from the succession of its inner states the very different experience of permanent and co-existing elements. The psychologist will perhaps say that this is given by the " local signs " of the body, but it is evident the bodily experience is only possible because a real co-existence was already there to interpret. The idea, in short, is implicitly presupposed, not derived and explained. And it is even doubtful if the elementary feeling of duration could be given in experience apart from that original togetherness of elements -which the feeling of extensity pre- supposes. Hence to say with Lotze that the objective counterpart of the experienced togetherness of a and b is merely the reciprocal influence of -a and b upon one another gives no answer to the question how the experience of a succession in consciousness can create the consciousness of co-existence. Our conclusion therefore is, that a more realistic theory of the object as a unity of -qualities and relations is necessary than any which can be given in terms of the Kantian theory. Kant himself admitted that we only know the definite I Logic, Eng. trans., p. 480. Op. the statement in the Microcosmus, Eng. trans., vol. i., p. 230.

It is a priori that a given object should be qualified, not that it should have this specific quality. The point which first demands consideration is the so-called constitutive function of universals.' Here we have to recall the fact, that to show that a universal is not reached by empirical generalisation is not to show that it enters as a constitutive element into particular objects. I agree with Prof. Stout that the characters and relations of a particular thing are as particular as the thing itself.2 About his theory that class-universals denote a peculiar type of dis- tributive unity not further analysable I do not feel convinced. For it is hard to suppose we reach the idea of \a class of this sort by a kind of immediate intuition; and if the idea is gained by a selection of relevant resemblances identity as a univ'ersal is implied.3 But it is not necessary for our argu- ment to dwell on this point. The important thing is that we can never reach the particular entity which exists unless its qualities and relations are as particular as it is itself. If a particular individual can only be known by its qualities, and these are universals, then the individual as such cannot be known. Hence these qualities and relations cannot be the product of the synthetic and universalising activity of the understanding: they must already be involved in the pre- sentation to sense, and afterwards be interpreted by the cognising mind. If it be true then, as it appears to be, that the Kantian theory breaks down before the particular and concrete facts of existence, it follows that we must reconsider the implica- tions of sense-data or sensa on the one hand, and the status and function of universals on the other. Let us begin with the former problem. Now in this- connexion it is not enough to offer, what Kant neglected to do, a view of the evolution of experience from sense, through perception, to conceptual or rational know- ledge. Nor is it sufficient to posit the irreducible basis of The difficulty that emerges here is an old one, and Plato, in the Parmtenides, showed the perplexities which attach to the Oe$tLS of the particular in the form or universal. Whitehead treats the universal as an eternal object which has ' ingression' into the particular event, and this means the way in which the event shapes itself owing to the being of the object. The conception is difficult, and it leaves various aspects of the problem of universals untouched. 2 Vide his paper on The Nature of Universals and Propositions. 3 Op. Husserl, Logische Untersuchungen, pp. 113, 147.</page><page sequence="7">312 G. GALLOWAY: experience inma Vorstellung, or in a feeling-continuum which undergoes differentiation. We must be sure the basis is adequate, and if it is adequate we ought to be able to show that the features of experience as it develops do not pre- suppose more than this. But, we have already urged, more is presupposed. Here it may be argued that the sensa are in all respects identical with the qualities we sense, and form the data beyond which we cannot pursue our analysis. But, if so, we appear to be committed to the view that the function of the experient individual is simply by an act to apprehend the sensa, which are independent of the apprehending and already complete in themselves. This is a difficult position to maintain in its entirety. But, it will be said, if you deny this you are committed to some kind of theory of representa- tive perception in which the representation plays the part of a peculiar tertiu;m quid intervening between the subject and the extra-mental reality. This too would be a difficult concep- tion which accords ill with our habitual ways of acting in which we assume we are in direct relation to things. On the other hand this objection has less force when we hold that the extra-mental real must be conceived as active, and directly reveals its own nature through its interaction with the ex- perient subject. On this view our sensa would be the expression of what things are, for a thing discloses itself in its way of acting. But it would also be true to say that sensa reveal the nature of the experient subject as he expresses himself in his reaction to things. They are real, though not real apart from the interaction of the two factors in ex- perience. The point I wish to press is, that while from the psycho- logical standpoint we may take the presentation-continuum and the sensa which emerge within it to be ultimate, we cannot do so from an epistemological or metaphysical stand- point. We are bound to ask whether our sense-data do not carry with them implications which point beyond themselves. The answer must be that they do. For it is undeniable that all experience is selective, and presupposes an environment which is continuous with but extends beyond what is actually experienced here and now. The reality of things of which we are not at present conscious, but of which we may become conscious, is a constant implicate of our experience. If this be so, the realm of possible experience must have a reality and unity of its own which does not depend on the fact that it may come within the sphere of cognition. In other words, the realm of existence, whether an object of actual or possible knowledge, must possess in both cases a common character</page><page sequence="8">THE KANTIAN A PRIORI IN KNOWLEDGE. 313 that does not depend on its being known. Further, the differentiation and integration which mark the expansion of knowledge are only possible if there be unity and structure in the trans-subjective reality: a formless 'thing in itself ' cannot by any manipulation of categories be transformed into an orderly realm of phenomena. The question is, What does experience, regarded psycho- logically, presuppose epistemologically ? Here let me recur to the problem of extensity and the related problem of duration. An independent co-existence or togetherness of elements, we concluded, was presupposed in physical experience. This togetherness is not the creation of relating knowledge but its condition. We may be tempted to speak of an original spatio-temporal continuum as the ground of what in the pre- sentational continuum stands for, the relatedness of elements. The objection to this is that space and time are not primitive data : as comprehensive wholes they are conceptual products only made possible by developed thinking. If we take the notion of extension to be more elementary we may speak of the original continuum as extended, so that, to use White- head's phrase, every event extends ov-er other events, and is itself extended over by other events. This is true alike of that which we describe as spatial or temporal location. On the other hand, an event in this connexion seems merely a limiting idea reached by abstraction, and the trans-subjective basis of knowledge must possess unity and structure, at least implicitly, if it is to be the datum which thought interprets in the form of an orderly and connected world. One may also affirm that the original continuum must possess activity, if it is to stand in living relation to experient centres of experience. Only on this view are we entitled to speak of the extra-mental revealing its nature in experience. Whether this activity is to be regarded as intrinsic or deriva- tive I do not discuss at present. It is also evident that if the continuum possesses the characters of unity and activity, it carries within it the fundamental feature of exhibiting change. Our developed ideas of space and time are intimately linked with the fact of change, and are ways in which we give con- ceptual expression to the meaning of change. Our reflective consciousness of the changing is possible because the reality which reveals itself in our experience is a reality which changes. The permanent in time is presupposed by inner sense, as Kant recognised; but there would be no conscious- ness of the permanent, if the pernianent did not contain within it or stand in contrast to the changing. The trans-subjective basis of experience, one would con- 21</page><page sequence="9">314 G. GALLOWAY: elude, though not to be described as mental, has some inner affinity with mind. Otherwise it could not be the medium within which minds are emergent. In his Analysis of Mind Mr. Russell remarks: " The stuff of which the world of our experience is composed is neither mind nor mnatter, but some- thing more primitive than either ".l If this is meant to suggest that some neutral tertium quid from its own inherent resources has developed into what we call matter and mind, we should disagree. At the same time it is true and important to realise that the conception of matter is a complex product of experience, and it would be a mere confusion to apply the term to the basis of experience itself. In any case it is ap- parent that an experient centre and the medium within which it emerges cannot be externally or accidentally related to one another. There must be an intrinsic or organic connexion between the subjective and the trans-subjective, otherwise mind could not find itself in nature or nature be a basis for emergent mind. This is implied by Plato's thought that viXq is the ' nurse of form,' or, as we might put it, the objective order is organically related as a means to the ideal order as end. So far I have been trying to indicate certain data which experience presupposes but which it does not create. On the other hand, experience involves experients, and the emergence of experients is the critical fact in the process of development. We may agree that the fact must have a sufficient reason, though it does not follow that a complete explanation is possible. That a primordial space-time continuum should by some inexplicable restlessness develop emergent qualities which take shape as the realms of life and mind, and should do so from its own intrinsic resources, is a theory which has been put forward in these days by Prof. Alexander. Yet it makes even heavier demands on faith than the older theism which it is designed to supersede. But this opens up a large subject, and I desire here simply to set on record that the continuum within which experient centres emerge should not be taken to be the ultimate explanation of their emergence. The fact of emergence has to be accepted, with 'natural piety' if you like, though it is not possible to trace the emergent qualities back to the elements on which they super- vene. What emerges must in some sense, no doubt, be pre- pared for by what has gone before, but this is not to say that it can be explained by what has gone before. Indeed it will be generally recognised that, where there is creative evolution, 1 op. cit., p. 10.</page><page sequence="10">THE KANTIAN A PRIORI IN KNOWLEDGE. 315 the strict continuity of determinate development cannot be maintained. The growth of experience through the activity of experient centres or individuals is a movement on which recent psy- chology has shed much light. It is not necessary for us to follow out the process by which the presentational continuum is gradually differentiated through the operation of attention, assimilation to prior experience, association and reproduction. But as the ideational activity develops, and, through the medium of free ideas and generic images, the mind by the aid of language advances to generalised conceptions of things and relations, the contribution of thought to the world within which it finds itself becomes -increasingly important. The mind is relatively passive in sensation, and at the stage of sensation and sense-perception we can speak of the extra- mental real revealing itself in the reaction of the experient. But at the higher level the contrast has developed between mental process regarded as inner and the world of outer experience, and the mind is essentially active at the stage of conceptual thinking. The problem we have to consider is the relation of conceptual thinking to existence. We have accepted the view that a substance, along with its qualities and relations, is not universal but particular. The mind does not fashion them by its own activity: it would be truer to say that it finds them and proceeds to interpret them in terms of its own experience. It is aware of itself as a unity possessing its own states which exhibit continuity, and so it proceeds to construe objects as substances to which attributes belong. The concept of the ' thing and its qualities' is not a casual device of language: it is the expression of a universal and almost instinctive use of analogy already opera- tive in primitive animism. It is the construction which man is impelled to put on something with which he is dealing. The same is true of cause and effect considered as a dynamic relationship in which the cause brings about the effect; for the idea of a force in the cause which produces the effect is an interpretation based on our volitional activity. The energy by which we bring about effects in nature we instinc- tively transfer to things which appear to bring about like effects, And though this use of analogy in the case of sub- stance and cause may be defective, it is at least an endeavour on man's part to construe the world with which he is con- fronted. The important point is that the process involves a principle of interpretation, not a constitutive principle. If there are substantial unities in nature, this is not due to the synthetic activity of mind: it is because the structure of</page><page sequence="11">316 G. GALLOWAY: nature is such that these types of unity have developed within it. And if there is that continuity and order of change in nature which is termed cause and effect, this does not depend on a necessity of thought. If there be necessity at all in the objective causal nexus, it will flow from the intrinsic nature of the factors involved, although Kant had persuaded himself that necessity was due to mind. Is there, then, it may be asked, any sense in which the universal falls within the order of existence, and can be spoken of consistently as existing? The answer will depend on the way in which the universal is understood. The uni- versal man, applicable to the whole class of human beings, certainly does not exist in the sense that the concrete in- dividual John Smith exists, though such a universal may be real in the sense of subsisting. On the other hand, writers like Bradley and Bosanquet have distinguished what they term the concrete universal from the abstract universal. From the former standpoint the individual man, who is a unity or identity that maintains itself in its changing states, is a concrete universal. The identity as distinguished from and related to the differences would be such a universal. To put it more generally, a law of nature conceived to be a unity which is realised in a changing group of phenomena is uni- versal. If we understand the term in this sense, there can be no dispute that this type of universal exists, for this particular kind of unity constantly meets us in the world of phenomena in space' and time. For this is the universal regarded as individual, and. individuality has an undoubted place in the world of existence. If we choose to call a type of unity which owes its unity to an intrinsic organising principle a universal, we may do so; but it is essential -to distinguish this pattern from the generalised or class-universal. Hence the category that stands for a universal type which has many instances must be differentiated from the universal which is the law or immanent principle of a determ-inate existing object or group. At this point we can see more clearly where some of the difficulties in the Kantian epistemology arise. Kant himself denied that we reach the categories by any process of generalising thought working on experience, for any experi- ence we could generalise already involved in his view categorial elements. On the other hand, the category for him is a universal concept which, taken by itself, has merely a possible application to experience. The category of cause, for instance, is a concept which can be applied or is realised in an indefinite number of specific situations, and as such is</page><page sequence="12">THE KANTIAN A PRIORI IN KNOWLEDGE. 317 not identical with any of its specific instances in the spatio- temporal world. The problem is to see how we pass from the concept to its specific embodiment in a concrete setting. Kant, as we know from his criticism of the Ontological Argu- ment, explicitly denied that we can pass from the idea of an object to the existence of the object. It is relevant, therefore, to enquire how we are to pass from the category as concept to its specific expression in the sphere of existence. It is only to evade the difficulty to say that the category or uni- versal is nothing apart from its particulars, and is somehow present in each particular. Kant might have escaped this awkward problem, though at the expense of finding himself confronted with a more formidable one, if he had gone over wholeheartedly to the idealistic position; if he had denied that anything is merely given to mind, and had affirmed that existence falls completely within the synthetic unity of ap- perception. He did not adopt this hazardous alternative, and consequently in his work there always survives the contrast between sense-perception and conception, between the realm of conceptual thinking and the realm of existence. As a re- sult the final synthesis between thought and things is never really achieved despite his laborious introduction of mediating terms. His schematism is an ingenious but highly artificial attempt to bridge the chasm between conceptual thinking and particular existences. For it does not help us in this dilemma to be told that the category is schematised in time, which is the common form of outer and inner experience. It does not help us because outer experience must, as we have seen and as Kant virtually admits, be conditioned by a reality beyond itself. It may be worth while to illustrate a little more fully the perplexities which arise from Kanat's endeavour to bring together disparate elements in his theory of knowledge. Consider the case of the transition from the general category of cause to its definite expression in a particular experience. The category, we are told, working through the schema of order in time, makes the knowledge of objective or necessary sequence possible. Yet the schema of an order determined in time by the productive imagination remains general.; It does not contain in itself any ground for deciding that a suc- cession of presentations is merely a succession, while another reveals a causal relationship, in other words that the one order is contingent and the other necessary. If we decide that the parts of a house apprehended successively do not exhibit a causal connexion, while the successive positions of a boat floating down a stream do, we so judge not because</page><page sequence="13">318 G. GALLOWAY: we recognise the category as immanent in the latter situation and not in the former. - The test of reversibility in the order of representations which we apply, in order to decide, is reached empirically by observation of the two cases. In fact we may generalise and say, that the presence of the category in a given experience can only be known from considerations based on the experience itself. Moreover, as has often been pointed out, the category as universal determines nothing in regard to the specific relation in any given instance. That heat is the effect of friction is only known by observation. Now the connexions in nature are all of this specific kind, and we could never know nature as an orderly whole apart from the knowledge of these definite connexions. Far from introducing order into phenomena by universal categorial judgments, we only recognise order in nature because it is already there in the form of definitely specified relations. These relations we treat as instances of universals, but they are not themselves universals. The difficulty involved in the Kantian theory of caus4lity may be put in this way. If any two events are in causal relation, the relation is categorially determined, according to Kant. But in actual experience the general principle, if a then b, appears always in the specific form, if am then bn, which is known by experience. From this the contradictory result emerges that the category determines a merely general connexion which does not exist as such, while the specific connexion is not constituted by the category. To be con- sistent here Kant would have required to abandon his main contention. He would have had to treat causality as a regulative principle which guides our investigation of nature, a principle which impels us to proceed on the rule that every event must have a cause, though it does not constitute the particular causal connexions we find in nature. Kant regards reason, which is directed to systematic unity in experience, as a regulative or methodological principle merely: it is not constitutive. For such a systematic unity is not a possible perception, and so does not fall within the sphere of knowledge. But if his theory of knowledge breaks down, as we think it does, under close scrutiny, if he has failed to show that the categories are really constitutive, then we may well ask if there is any justification for the contrast in character between understanding and reason. For reason is just the fuller development of what is implicit in under- standing, and whether we seek order in experience or systematic unity we are following a principle which is regula- tive of the procedure of mind. In either case we are giving</page><page sequence="14">THE KANTIAN A PRIORI IN KNOWLEDGE. 319 effect to a postulate of our thinking, and we are stating what we expect to find. We are not imposing conditions to which any possible experience must conform, but we are illustrating the method in which our minds have to proceed when they interpret in general terms the order and connexion which already exist in experience. It remains to cdnsider a little more closely the status which. the realm of universals or of conceptual thinking has in our universe. Lotze, it may be recalled, declared that it had validity, and the phrase is.convenient but the meaning is obscure.' The process of knowledge as a historic develop- ment involves a constant modification and revision of previous. conceptions, and in its nature remains partial and imperfect. Just because the interpretative element bulks so largely in the process of knowing, the possibility of error is always present. Certainly all conceptual thinking cannot be valid in view of the fact that errors take place, and there are degrees of truth and error. And if we say that conceptual thinking, so far as it is true, is valid, there remains the problem how we are to conceive the relation of validity to existence. That existence, must conform to our thought because our understanding is constitutive, we have seen reason to deny. On the other hand, it is not disputed that we organise our experience by means of universals which, though they do not exist in the phenomenal world, have a reality of their own. That we should be able to do this is due to the fact that in the spatial and temporal continuum various types of unity, which include related elements, exist, and these lend themselves to expres- sion in conceptual terms. These universals guide the mind in its dealing with things, and the development of the generic image into the concept through language was undoubtedly stimulated by practical needs. Man had to find hilmnself in his environment: he had to manipulate it in the interests of life, and the original function of knowledge was instrumental. Hence the concepts by which man interpreted his experience, if they were not empirical generalisations, were universals. which had to fulfil the function of guiding him in dealing with the experienced world. The impulse to generalise was. stimulated by the forward trend of mind, which is always much concerned to anticipate the future so as to meet it when it comes. The process of discovering meaning in experience is implicitly a process of universalising where the individual case or relation becomes an instance of a universal, while the universal attains the status of a principle in the light of which I Logic, Eng. Trans., p. 437 ff.</page><page sequence="15">320 G. GALLOWAY: fresh experience may be interpreted and understood. Through our conceptual thinking- we express what things and events mean for us; and meaning lies at the root of co-operative social life, which rests on an organised body of meanings. But if the world of concepts and the world of existences are different, why is our conceptual thinking applicable to existence, and a guide to our dealing with it? If concepts are not immanent in external objects and events, we are driven to the conclusion that there is some community of structure between the realm of existence and the cognising mind in virtue of which the former becomes irAtelligible to the latter. If, for example, the conceptual thinking of the man of science, following the line of logical ground and consequent, enables him to predict the acting of elements in nature and his prediction is subsequently verified, then there must be a conformity between the natural and the mental order. Otherwise verification would have been impossible. Here let us keep in view the fact that the extra-mental sphere of existence already possesses the character of unity and internal relatedness. Only idealism run mad will deny that a natural order was there before there were minds to know it. This natural order was the basis on which new emergent wholes in the form of those specific types of unity called organic developed. This type of unity, call it in- dividual or organism, while it displayed a complex and in- timate internal relatedness of its own, none the less conformed to that more general type of unity involving relations on which it supervened. And this conformity is maintained in that still higher type of unity revealed in the thinking subject whose states fall within and are sustained by the unity of the self. So far, then, we may say there is a community of pattern between the form of thinking, as a process of relating within a unity, and the structure of things. This conformnity of pattern, however, does not imply an identity which extends to details. This will appear if we consider the manner in which the mind works with the con- cepts of substance and attribute and cause and effect. There can be no doubt why we habitually construe phenomenal objects as substances which possess qualities or attributes. Our use of the category of substance rests on the conscious- ness that the self owns and unifies its own states, on the experience that the self maintains itself in its changing states. This experience is the basis of the process by which we -ransfer the pattern of substantial unity to things without us, and so there has developed the traditional idea of substance as " the support of qualities ". It is, of course, easy to show</page><page sequence="16">THE KANTIAN A PRIORI IN KNOWLEDGE. 321 that this is a very crude way of putting the case, and that substance and attributes are not separated in this fashion. The important point, however, is our own procedure. What in fact we do is to ascribe to things without us the same kind of unity that we are conscious of in ourselves. The house or the stone which we speak of as possessing certain attributes cannot be substances in the sense in which we may speak of ourselves as substances. The type of unity revealed in the mind is not possessed by all the objects in nature to which we uncritically transfer it. On the other hand, our anthropo- morphic procedure cannot be entirely false, else it would -not prove serviceable to us in our transactions with the objects in our environment. To treat things as possessing qualities which differentiate them from other things would prove a futile business, if the very notion of a thing and its qualities were a contradiction. The truth seems to be that the concept we apply in this case to objects is a higher type of unity than is found in the extra-mental realm of existence as such, though in the organic world we find something which more nearly corresponds to it. But even in the sphere of spatio-temporal existence there must be already present that more general pattern of unity which involves an internal relatedness of elements. And this original togetherness of elements within a unity which is the ground of their related- ness appears to give at least a degree of relevancy to our extended use of the more developed category of substance in our thinking about and our dealing with things. It will be evident, if this line of argument is justified, that substance, regarded as a constitutive principle, would not be a category in the Kantian sense. It would not be a form by which the mind determines phenomena: it would be the principle of individuality in the world which is the condition of the emergence of mind itself. Kant, connects the notion of causality with that of substance, which is the permanent in time; and it is clear we can only think of an orderly process of change in relation to a unity which persists. Mr. Johnson has recently introduced the more useful idea of the 'continuant' in place of substance, of which the simplest illustration is the path of a moving particle. Now it is quite possible to give expression to the way in which thought generalises the relation of occurrents to the continuant through the mathematical notion of a functional correspondence which reveals itself in the deter- minate values which the variables may assume. This, I I Johnson, Logic, Pt. III, p. 96.</page><page sequence="17">322 G. GALLOWAY: take it, is what Mr. Russell mea.ns when he says that the traditional conception of -causality has to be replaced by that of " a law of change ".1 Nor does Kant himself imply more when he treats causality as a determinate or necessary order of change referred to the permanent. Certainly the Kantian theory of phenomenaal causality conveys no implication of dynamical efficiency. This dynamic oharacter which we habitually attribute to the causal relation is, we have already said, due to an inreading of our own experience into our en- vironment. This anthropomorphism colours our whole view of the world. Yet it cannot always be relevant, for we cannot suppose that every event in the natural world reveals the very same kind of activity of which we are conscious in ourselves. Our habitual language about things acting and reacting on one another is readily understood, and I believe there is some- thing which corresponds to it in the natural order. But the analogy involved cannot, in the nature of the case, be strictly accurate. If the Kantian theory of causality will not work, is it possible to replace it by a more adequate theory? The scientific value of the conception is patent and therefore must have some justification; but when we begin to reflect on the issues raised by the problem we all find it perplexing and difficult, and no solution is perhaps adequate. It has often been noted that the concept of cause expands under examina- tion into that of sufficient reason. Yet in this form it becomes unworkable for scientific purposes, and the scientific man to reach results is compelled to envisage the event in abstrac- tion from most of its implications. Hence the dilemma that the conception of cause which will work, to that extent ceases to be quite true. In dealing with the whole question we have to accept at the outset the fact of change to be fundamental, for change is presupposed by any experience of it or by any idea of suc- cession in time. Further when there is a definite order of succession, the connexion belongs to the changing elements themselves, and is not due to the cognising mind. These connexions, however, as they exist in definite and concrete instances, are specific and particular, and no one situation is the exact replica of another. But our thought, in universal- ising the relation of the two successive occurrents a and b, ignores the details of the situation in which they appear, and regards it as a type. It states the relation in the hypothetical form, if a then b, and treats it as a methodological postulate 1 Analysis of Mind, p. 93.</page><page sequence="18">THE KANTIAN A PRIORI IN KNOWLEDGE. 323, with which to work. Though the practical value of this pro-- cedure is undeniable, it does not exactly correspond to what happens in the natural order, for there the working of the relation is constantly modified by surrounding conditions- The supposed necessity of the connexion of a with b in any given case is due to the process of abstraction Which isolates the elements from their context and then universalises them.. The position seems to be like that of mathematics, where the necessity of the conclusions is due to the abstract generality of the subject and its consequent hypothetical character. Nonie the less it is plain that the scientific conception has an important working value, and the postulate that every event must have a cause is justified as a principle to guideh investigation. Yet this would not be the case if there were not some conformity between the process of mind and the process in nature, between the connexion which thought de- mands and the kind of connectedness which nature exhibits, The complexity of nature no doubt baffles thought; but the fact that an abstract view of nature, in the form of a mechanical system of continuously 'varying quantities, is. susceptible of mathematical treatment which enables us in certain cases to predict the future behaviour of things, is only intelligible if there be a harmony between the order of mind and the order in objects. So at least we shall conclude. We may express the result by saying, that there is a continuity a.nd uniformity in the working of the natural order which re- sponds to the demand for continuity on the part of the mind. The uniformities of succession in nature have a counterpart in the movement of thought which proceeds in a determinate order from logical ground to consequent. The necessity, however, which the mind attributes to the relation cannot be validly transferred to the order of nature, which reveals uni- formity of conjunction though not intrinsic necessity. On this point Hume, I venture to think, is to be preferred to, Kant. If we predicate intrinsic necessity of the natural order it must be on the assumption that that order forms a systematic whole within which every occurrent is in the end mechanically determined by the whole. And since this is merely a hypothesis, the inference which is derived from it also remains hypothetical. On the other hand, if we treat the causal nexus as itself necessary and immanent, after the fashion of Kant, we ought to recognise that we are really construing it abstractly as a hypothetical universal isolated from the phenomenal complex. Whether b will succeed a, within that existing complex in any individual case will depend on a number of factors operating within the complex.</page><page sequence="19">324 G. GALLOWAY: And we are not entitled to translate a hypothetical necessity into a factual one. We may now try to state in a more general way our con- clusions in regard to the functions of the universals of thought in relation to the organisation of experience. The office which they fulfil is not to constitute experience but to supply forms by which the mind can describe and deal with it. While conceptual thinking enlarges the outlook on the world, and by so doing gives a very different view of it from any view' which is possible to a purely perceptual consciousness, it does not mould and fashion the world of existents: it generalises, and by generalising interprets. But its general- isations are not arbitrary, for they arise out of the conformity between- the order of existence and the process of the mind. In the evolution of experience the transition from the per- ceptual to the conceptual stage is imperceptible, and where- ever a rudimentary meaning is realised, the mnovement has begun which reaches its ultimate fulfilment in conceptual thinking. The expansion of outlook which conceptual think- ing brings about will be realised when we bear in mind that it is at this, later stage that the universal relation of the subject to the object becomes explicit, and inner is con- sciously differentiated from outer experience. Now the discernment of mneaning in the world is essential to a self- conscious being, and it is through the medium of the concept or universal that developed mind reads meaning into phenomena. A continuity of events and the relatedness of elements in the environment of the subject is the condition of .his finding meaning in them; and the discovery of meaning implies the process of assimilating the present to the past experience. But without order in the behaviour of things there would be no learning by experience, and this because there would be nothing to learn. The important point is, that the mind's act of universalising stands for the mode in which it construes its data, and cannot constitute the data themselves; for these in the end are not facts in our mind or facts which only exist for our mind. To this extent at all events we have to part company with idealism. Thought takes the character of a particular thing or a particular event as an instance of a universal. In the light of this universal it goes on to construe similar things and events, and the individual has a methodological postulate by means of which he seeks to deal with future' situations when they come. The specific instance may be the quality of an object, or it may be the relation of one object or event to another, but the procedure of the mind remains the same. The postulate as</page><page sequence="20">THE KANTIAN A PRIORI IN KNOWLEDGE. 325 a universal has a reality of its own, though it does not exist within the sphere of spatial and temporal existence. That the process of the mind and the order of nature conform to one another has its ground in the teleological structure of the universe which includes all orders of reality. The realm of conceptual thinking is of a higher order than the realm of existence, but there is an inner adaptation of the one order to the other.</page></plain_text>
