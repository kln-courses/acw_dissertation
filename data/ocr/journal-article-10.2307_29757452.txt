<plain_text><page sequence="1">Bactria and Margiana Seals A New Assessment of Their Chronological Position and a Typological Survey by Sandro Salvatori It is worth mentioning that one of the most intriguing problems in the archaeology of Central Asia is still presented by the unusually varied archaeological assemblage which, since the early seventies, has flooded the antiquary market of Kabul and from there private collections and museums all over the world (Pottier 1984). Thousands of objects from pillaged graves from Dashly, Doulatabad, Farukhabad and Nichin oases in Northern Afghanistan have now been published, while as many are dispersed in several private or museum collections and are still waiting to be published. That large number of objects is clearly connected with a flourishing urban society (see, for instance, the strong narrative symmetry between the scene portrayed on a Bactrian silver vessel (Amiet 1986: fig. 202) and one of the panels of the famous Ur standard) which shows strong and firmly consolidated links with most of contemporary political or cultural aggregates of the Middle East, from Elam (Amiet 1986) to the Indus Valley (Pottier 1984; During Caspers 1994a), from central Iran (Ligabue &amp; Salvatori 1979; Amiet 1986) to the Gulf (Potts D.T. 1994; Crawford &amp; Al Sindi 1995) and possibly beyond. In this respect some scholars have suggested possible connections with Anatolian seals to the west (Poetto &amp; Salvatori 1981) and with the so-called Nestorian seals from the Ordos, to the east (Biscione 1985; Brentjes 1987; Kohl 1981). Excavations carried out between 1969 and 1979 by V. Sarianidi and the Soviet Academy of Sciences in northern Afghanistan oases ? the same area from which the so-called Bactrian graves assemblage arrived at the Kabul antiquary market ? brought to light some of the larger Bronze Age settlements of the region south of the Amu darya and at the same time, by means of regional surveys of varying intensity, revealed there the presence of a large and complex settlement pattern dating back to the Bronze Age (Sarianidi 1977a) in the large deltaic fans of the rivers rising from the northern cliffs of the Hindu Kush. On the opposite bank of the Oxus river, during the same period, some important settlements and cemeteries dating back to the same cultural horizon were investigated, e.g. Sapalli depe and Dzarkutan, in southern Uzbekistan (Askarov 1973, 1977). Though extensive and impressive, Soviet scholars' activities in northern Afghanistan, failed to solve one of the main problems: [1] 97</page><page sequence="2">the building up of a chronological and cultural frame for the rich archaeological assemblage from the plundered graves of the region (*). Only very few objects from the deepest layers of Dashly 3 palace can be compared with materials from the plundered Bactrian graves. Among these a handful of open? work geometric compartment seals (Sarianidi 1977a: figs. 45-46) and fragmentary cylindrical schist poles (Sarianidi 1984: fig. 17 at p. 24; cf. Pottier 1984: fig. 7.29-35; Salvatori 1993: 10). This scarcity of elements traceable to cemetery complexes is highly suspicious. As has already been pointed out (Salvatori 1995b), this can be accounted for only by postulating that the settlements referring to the plundered graveyards have not been identified or that the earlier levels of the excavated settlements have barely been touched upon (2). With reference to this kind of problem, the research carried out by Soviet researchers starting in the 'fifties in the Murghab delta (the Margiana of the historical period) in southern Turkmenistan proved to be of the greatest importance. In this region reconnaissance campaigns often alternated with excavation projects (3). The latter involved the performance of sondages in numerous sites as well as more extensive research that brought to light monumental complexes and entire villages (Kelleli 1, 3, 4, 6; Togolok 1, 21, 24; Gonur 1 south and north; Auchin 1; Takhirbai 3; Adzi Kui 8). The great merit of the Murghab delta excavations is to have presented us with a clearer sequence of the Bronze Age developments in the area, which have important implications also for the neighbouring Bactria. It became increasingly clear that the settlements, or rather, the levels of settlement, excavated in northern Afghanistan were situated in the Late Bronze Age horizon, and had very strong links with a considerable body of Margiana evidence. But what was even more important, it clearly emerged that in Margiana there was a numerically significant presence of earlier settlements datable to the Middle Bronze Age as well as scanty but undeniable evidence of the presence of Ancient Bronze Age and Final Chalcolithic settlements (NMZ III-IV) (Masimov 1981a, 1981b, 1984, 1986; Udeumuradov and Masimov, personal communication). The Middle Bronze Age settlements yielded material that showed an immediate similarity with the despoiled cemetery complexes of Bactria, thus contributing to a chronological and cultural relocation of this complex material in a more comprehensive framework and enormously expanding the decidedly narrow context to which it had been relegated in earlier interpretations (4). f1) Preliminary attempts have been worked out by Pjankova 1993. (2) This seems to be the case of Dashly 3, a site that has however been only partially and inadequately published: Sarianidi 1977a, 1984. (3) For the history of research in Margiana before the early '80s see Kohl 1984: 143-50; for the following period, until 1989, see Hiebert 1994a and for subsequent research see: Salvatori 1993, 1994a, 1994b; Gubaev, Koshelenko &amp; Tosi 1998; Sarianidi 1990b, 1998. (4) For a discussion of the problem cf. Salvatori 1995b. 98 [2]</page><page sequence="3">It is in this context that it is necessary to view the initiative of the Ligabue Study and Research Centre which in 1991 began to focus its activities on identifying and excavating the cemetery that could be traced back to the great Middle Bronze Age settlement of Gonur 1 North. The graveyard, discovered in 1991 on the western side of the settlement, although also systematically plundered in ancient times like many other Central Asian cemeteries (see Kohl 1984: passim), has yielded precious and decisive information related to the problem of the reconstruction of the picture of the development of Bactro-Margiana civilization between the Fig. 1 - Open-work compartment stamp Middle and the Late Bronze Age, as we have seal from Grave 91, Gonur 1, Middle emphasised in previous contributions (Salvatori Bronze A8e cemetery. 1993, 1994a, 1994b, 1998b, n.d.). With reference to the aim of the present work, three graves, two of which intact and the third plundered, have yielded three bronze open-work compartment seals displaying a direct and close kinship with similar materials from the Bactrian graveyard complex (5). These materials, already published (Salvatori 1994b, 1995a), are important not only per se but also because they can be traced back to definite grave contexts in which they are associated with grave goods of great interest owing to the fact that also the latter display strong similarities with the materials of the plundered Bactrian graveyards. Thus grave 91, as a well as an open-work compartment seal with geometric motif (Fig. 1) also yielded a sub-cylindrical alabaster vase of a type that was extremely common in the mid 3rd millennium B.C. (Casanova 1991: Type IV pp. 33-35; Salvatori 1995a: 12). In Margiana only a few fragmentary specimens were found during reconnaissance campaigns carried out within the framework of the Murghab archaeological mapping project (Masimov, Salvatori &amp; Udeumuradov 1998), together with others from the KeUeli area (Masimov 1979: fig. 12.14), Togolok 15 (Sarianidi 1990a: table XXVII.2), Togolok 1 (ibid.: table XXVII.l) and Gonur South (Hiebert 1994a: fig. 9.10:7). With the exception of specimens found out of context, at the present state of our knowledge it appears that the production of alabastrine calcite vases must be situated within the chronological span of the Middle Bronze Age. An apparent exception is the (5) We reiterate that, when we speak of Bactrian graveyard complex, we are referring exclusively to the materials from the plundered necropolises of North Afghanistan which are today scattered among numerous private collections and American and European museums. [3] 99</page><page sequence="4">fragment attributed by Hiebert to a dwelling context in Gonur South. Nevertheless, it must be pointed out that also other types of calcite containers from Margiana can be attributed with certainty to the Middle Bronze Age. This is true of the twin-vase from the Middle Bronze Age graveyard of Gonur (Salvatori 1993: figs. 9, 12.G.C.2/12), of a tall stemmed cup from a grave of the same period at Takta Bazar (Udeumuradov 1993: fig. 34) and a tall stemmed cup from Gonur North (Sarianidi 1990a: table IV.2 room 22). A number of specimens of cylindrical vases with horizontally flared rim made of alabastrine calcite have been found in Bactria (Pottier 1984: figs. 26.203-204, 21.205; tables XXV.203; XXVI.207). One interesting detail concerning the Gonur graveyard specimens is the knobbed inner bottom. For the time being this feature appears to be typical of the Bactria and Margiana production, although it will be recalled that it is found also on alabastrine calcite vases known to have been imported into the Mesopotamian area and dating to between the Early Dynastic III period and the post-Sargonid Akkadian period. This is true for instance of a specimen from Ur dating to the Early Dynastic III (Heinz 1989: fig. 11) and several mottled alabaster vases, again from Ur, bearing Rimush and Naram-Sin dedicatory inscriptions that identify them as part of the booty from the eastern campaigns of the two Akkadian kings (Potts T.F. 1989: figs. 1, 6, 11; Potts D.T. 1986: table XXIV). While this feature, as may be inferred from the thorough investigation by R. Ciarla (1979, 1981. See also the absence of knobbed bottoms in the Site 109 specimens in the Gardan Reg survey by Fairservis 1961: fig. 29), is completely extraneous to the Sistan production found at Shahr-i Sokhta, where vessels of similar shape were indeed found, for example in Graves 712 and 725 Lower, both dating to phase 4 (2500-2400 B.C.) of the site sequence, as well as in other sites in the Hilmand Delta, it is instead found on at least one specimen of high-stemmed cup from the Shahdad necropolis (Hakemi 1997) and on one specimen of cylindrical vase with horizontally flared rim from this deposit known as 'Vase ? la Cachette' from Susa dating to around 2400 B.C. (Amiet 1986: fig. 96.7). It is found in Turkmenistan on a low sub-cylindrical alabaster vase from Grave 843-845 at Altyn Depe (Kircho 1988: fig. 4.7), a grave dating to the beginning of the Namazga IV period. Similar items come from the furniture of unpublished graves (Graves 677, 634-638, 526-627) from Excavation 5 at Altyn Depe which cover all the chronological span of the Namazga IV (6). The Mesopotamian specimens and the Susiana one provide a sure chronological reference for this product characterized by the knobbed internal bottom shared by several different shape types such as the cylindrical vase with horizontally flared rim, high-stemmed cylindrical cups, twin-vases, etc. Grave 37, as well as an open-work compartment seal with a geometric pattern (Fig. 2) (Salvatori 1994b), yielded also a bronze hemispherical bowl, a bronze cosmetics (6) L. Kirtcho, personal communication. 100 [4]</page><page sequence="5">Fig. 2 - Open-work compartment stamp-seal from Grave 37, Gonur 1, Middle Bronze Age cemetery.

XVI. 104-8) and elsewhere (Altyn depe: Masson 1981a: pi. XV and fig. 14, Grave 252; Quetta: Jarrige 1987; Jarrige &amp; Hassan 1989). Lastly, grave 72 yielded a third open-work compartment seal (Fig. 3) bearing a motif represented by an eagle with spread wings (Salvatori 1994b: fig. 13.6) identical to numerous Bactrian examples. The same grave also contained half a ceramic twin-vase (ibid.: fig. 13.5) of a type known both at Kelleli (Masimov 1981a: fig. 3) and at Atyn-depe (Tosi 1973-74: figs. 54, 56; Kohl 1984: 147) again from NMZ V contexts, as well as a baked clay version of a cosmetics flacon (Salvatori 1994a: fig. 14.1). The graveyard we excavated at Gonur (Salvatori 1993, 1994a, 1994b, 1995a) is on the whole located in the same chronological and cultural horizon as the Kelleli area settlements (Udeumuradov 1993) in the north-western sector of the Murghab delta, and the large settlement of Gonur 1 North (Sarianidi 1990a: 13-33; 1998) in the central sector, while the deeper levels of Togolok 1 (Sarianidi 1990a: 34-44) are found in the centre-south sector. Numerous other sites may certainly be attributed to the same horizon, as has been shown by recent reconnaissance work performed within the Murghab delta Archaeological Map project (Salvatori 1998a). With reference to the absolute dating to assign to this cultural period, to the previously published C14 datings (Sarianidi 1990a, 1993a, 1998; Kohl 1992; Hiebert [5] 101</page><page sequence="6">1993; Salvatori 1995b), it is necessary to add an important determination obtained directly from the Middle Bronze Age graveyard of Gonur 1 (Table 1).

This confirms what had already been inferred from stylistic and formal comparison of materials from different but substantially contiguous geocultural situations. A somewhat similar picture is provided by the C14 datings available for the Bactrian sites (Brentjes 1987) (Table 2), which allows us to substantiate also by radiometric data the hypothesis of a widespread Bactro-Margian cultural koine, as least as far as the Middle and Late Bronze Age is concerned (7). It is in any case interesting to note how much are (7) Obviously, our position, based as it is on increasingly abundant, comprehensive and univocal evidence (Salvatori 1995b, 1998b, n.d.) clashes with that of those who would like to relegate to the Late Bronze Period alone the rise of a cultural koine of these two regions (e.g. Hiebert &amp; Lamberg Karlovsky 1992; Sarianidi 1993a, 1998; Jarrige 1994). The two different interpretations of the archaeological evidence are by no means incompatible at the level of the historical reconstruction as the former, by not undergoing any interruption of the cultural evolution of the two regions even in earlier periods, acknowledges that the mechanism of protourban development in Margiana and Bactria has local roots; the latter, on the other hand, by placing the beginning of the Bactro-Margiana civilization in the Late Bronze Age, implicitly or explicitly, depending on the authors, advances the hypothesis of the intrusion of groups of external populations to explain the extraordinary developments of civilization in those two regions. 102 [6]</page><page sequence="7">increasing, as research continues, the dates from both Margiana and Bactria levels, which are concentrated in the first half of the 3rd millennium B.C.

To this end we have endeavoured to identify several formal categories that could in some way facilitate a classification of these materials and enable their distribution and chronology to be followed, at least partly, as well as to ascertain whether these formal categories have a discriminating function also as regards chronology and the definition of production sub-provinces: (8) We lay no claim here to completeness, being fully aware that much of the Bactrian material is still unpublished. A bibliographic and museum survey was recently published by S. Baghestani (1997), while V.l. Sarianidi is currently engaged in studying rich, mainly private, American collections. It is to be hoped that our Russian colleague will soon publish also the extensive unpublished Margiana material. Although the situation regarding the Bactrian material is still highly fluid, we believe that what has so far been published can be considered sufficient in order to attempt a some sort of typological and chronological categorization of Bactrian seals and to submit it to debate in the scientific community.

Hissar HIB has now been dated, thanks to the new C14 determinations, to between 2500 and 2300 B.C. (Dyson &amp; Lawn 1989: 143), while for the NMZ V of the Turkmenian piedmont zone, the numerous radiometric determinations available so far more or less converge on a bracket between 2500 and (n) This specimen is much akin to a Bactrian open-work compartment seal now in the Ligabue collection in Venice (Salvatori 1978: fig. V.l). It must also be pointed out jhat unlike what During Caspers (1994b: 85) claims it is not possible to make a comparison between this seal and Shahr-i Sokhta specimens. The reference During Caspers makes to Tosi, ed. 1983: pi. LXXX, fig. 106 is incorrect as the illustration refers to a pin. The author probably meant to refer to pi. LXXII, fig. 73, middle row, right, which is a stone compartment seal from Room CCXXXII.4 dating to Period II Phases 6-5 (second quarter of the 3rd millennium B.C. and not mid-late 3rd millennium as During Caspers states on p. 86). (12) These are linked to two specimens from Hissar IIIC (Schmidt 1937: fig. 118.H3J15, H4886). [11] 107</page><page sequence="12">Fig. 4 - Metal stamp-seal impression on a pottery shard.

On the basis of the evidence provided by the specimens from Altyn, Shahr-i Sokhta and Shahdad a dating of between 2600 and 2100 B.C. may reasonably be proposed.

(15) The seal may be dated to the first quarter of the 3rd millennium B.C. (Quivron 1994: 269).

[15] 111</page><page sequence="16">As noted and emphasized by Winkelmann (1996: 47-53), the radiant animal motif is extremely interesting and is spread over a rather wide area. It is noteworthy that it is found on both stone and bronze seals, probably with different chronologies. On stone it is found in the Indus Valley (Joshi &amp; Parpola 1987: M-417) at Mohenjodaro, and among the Gulf seals at Failaka and Bahrain (Kjaerum 1983: nos. 1-3; Beyer 1986: 103 no. 176 from Tell F6, level Vb; Mortensen 1970: 392 fig. 8 right). In sealing form we find it on several clay seal impressions from Acemh?y?k (Ozg?c 1968: pi. 104,4, 5) and B?y?kkale IVd (Bittel 1970: fig. at p. 40 second row, right) probably made using seals similar in certain respects to those of Failaka and Bahrain. Lastly, we find the motif on a biface stepped lozenge seal from Sapalli depe (Brentjes 1987: fig. 6.3). All stone specimens, including that of Mohenjodaro, and the Anatolian clay sealings, are easily dated to around the early 2nd millennium B.C. and so the bronze ones may be considered as precursors. In any case the motif is present in much earlier periods, as is shown by a clay sealing from Tall-i Malyan (Sumner 1976: fig. 4.1 and pi. Ilia) bearing the impression of a cylinder seal dating to about 3000 B.C., and by the pattern on a vase from Miri Qalat, in Pakistani Makran (Besenval &amp; Marquis 1993). The latter specimen comes from sondage III Level I dating to between the end of the 4th and the first half of the 3rd millennium B.C., that is, to the same chronological context as the Malyan clay sealing. The Dilmun specimens may have acted as intermediaries in the transition of the motif into the Anatolian environment, and perhaps the Dilmun world was the receptor for the motif which, in Bactria-Margiana, we observe to be present over the entire time span of the Namazga V and VI periods, although displaying substantial variation in the type of support material. An alternative hypothesis, and one that is equally possible at the present state of our knowledge, is the transition of the motif from Turkmenistan to the Syro-Anatolian area and thence to the Dilmun area. The first of the two directions remains the more preferable as the motif was already present in the Indus Valley not only as a specific theme (e.g. the above cited Mohenjodaro seal) but also as related themes. 4.p Indeterminate animals S.

Another plausible hypothesis is that the specimens displaying a more massive configuration, i.e. greater thickness of the segments comprising the collar and the inner partitions, belong to the earlier phase (this is true of the Shahr-i Sokhta specimen with the leonine figure and that from Nausharo, to which I would add also the specimen depicting a bovine from southern Bactria). These specimens are easily datable to the second quarter of the 3rd millennium B.C. The others, with a thinner surrounding collar and thinner linear elements of the inner partitions, can be dated to the third quarter of the millennium. 5.

Hakemi (1997) for the Istituto Italiano per l'Africa e l'Oriente types. Fortunately, in this we are helped by the 'Bactrian' type seals, which are present as grave goods in several burials that are easy to date using other elements in the goods themselves, as we shall see in the course of the present treatment. For the time being, we simply anticipate that the 'Bactrian' type seals and sealings are found in graves all of which datable to between the 25th and 22nd century B.C. (19) Among the grave goods are numerous elements linking the grave to the NMZ IV/V of southern Turkmenistan. [17] 113</page><page sequence="18">2 3 4 5 6 10 11 12 Fig. 10-1.

In particular, the seals can certainly be dated to the Middle Bronze Age as a result of the certain and rigorous comparisons that may be made with similar from the NMZ V levels of Altyn-depe.

Metal Open-Work Compartment Seals A second large class is the one represented by open-work compartment seals. This is-without doubt one of the most important aspects of the rich assortment that has reached private and museum collections all over the world after passing through the Kabul market. Also for this class we suggest a basic typology in which the mass of material belonging to it can be organized.

What is certain is that presumably quite substantial differences exist in the shape of the suspension loop, which varies from a simple circular ribbon shaped ring to a definitely square raised shape. 12. Circular open-work compartment seals This is without doubt the quantitatively best represented type, both overall and in its various different shapes and forms. The range of decorative motifs is rich, complex and certainly represents a distinctive element in the Bactro-Margiana seal production. The mass of materials coming under the general type label has been subdivided here not only in accordance with the lines of generic shape variation but there is also a subdivision that takes the decorative systems into account. 12.a.a: Simple single collar 1 - Geometric (Fig. 12.6) S.

In addition to these specimens from a well-defined context, there are three other surface specimens from Gonur 1 North, a mound mainly formed during the Middle Bronze Age. In this type the geometric motifs are by far the most frequent, the same ones that are found in the numerically more common double collar variant. The non geometric subjects . are comparatively rare and unfortunately all come from the antiquarian market. 120 [24]</page><page sequence="25">The distribution is currently limited to southern Turkmenistan, Margiana and southern Bactria. The only specimen I am familiar with, which comes from other regions and could be included in this type, is a Yahya seal, although it is also conceivable that this type also spread as far as Shahdad, as is indicated by the impressions found on the pottery in that graveyard. One quite common motif is the cross composed of four semi-circular segments hanging from the collar, found both in Margiana and Bactria, both in the double collar type and in the continuous plane compartment class. 12.a.b: Single profiled collar (Fig. 12.* S.

The type is dated with certainty to the second half of the 3rd millennium B.C. by the Takhta Bazar specimen, the one from Grave 37 of the Middle Bronze Age graveyard of Gonur 1 and that of Grave 166 of Shahdad, to which may be added a specimen from Dashly 3. A seal [25] 121</page><page sequence="26">of this type was found also at Pirak, unfortunately out of context. The distribution of this type outside South Bactria and Margiana takes in Susa, Shahdad and the Kerman, Pirak. It must be pointed out that the distribution of this type of seal with anthropo? morphic or mixed zoo-anthropomorphic figures is limited to South Bactria, which is true also for the entire class of open-work and closed back compartment circular seals, with very few exceptions. 12.b.b.a: Complex double collar 1 - Geometric (Fig. 12.12) S.

Disregarding the chronological problem, they are of particular interest in that one specimen in the group (Pittman 1984: fig. 25c) lends itself to a detailed comparison with the Acemh?y?k sealings, certainly dating to between the 19th and the 18th century B.C. (?zg?c 1968: 319-20, pi. 104.2-5). The formal similarity between the Bactrian seal in the Metropolitan and the above cited Anatolian sealings is quite strong, both displaying also a guilloche-shaped collar as well as the radiating motif which is found, as mentioned earlier, on an impression from B?y?kkale Ivd (Bittel 1970: fig. at p. 40 second row, right). Nevertheless, the impressions were made using stone stamp seals and not a metal compartment seal. As other authors have pointed out, the type of seal used to produce the impressions is apparently comparable with the class of Dilmun seals of the 19-18th century and in any case several specimens actually display the radiating animal motif (Kjaerum 1983: nos. 1-3; Beyer 1986: 103 no. 176 from Tell F6, level Vb; Mortensen 1970: 392, fig. 8 right). However, to my knowledge the guilloche motif on the edge of the stamp is not to be found on any of the hundreds of Dilmun seals known so far. In all likelihood, therefore, the seals used to produce the Acemh?y?k impressions were of Syro-Anatolian manufacture and as such may be considered the prototype of the late Hittite production (see for instance the fine Tyszkiewicz stamp-cylinder in the Boston Museum: Frankfort 1939: pi. XLIIIn, o). This thus leaves open the question of the relationship between this 19-18th century B.C. Syro-Anatolian production and the metal Bactrian specimen in the Metropolitan which, being part of a certainly dated seal class belonging to the second half of the 3rd millennium, is earlier than the Syro-Anatolian and Dilmun series. General Typological Considerations The chronological indications obtained from archaeologically checked finds leave no doubts as to the dating of the type and its variants in the NMZ V horizon and thus over a time span running from 2400 to 2100 B.C. However, it is clear that as regards figurative complexity inside the Bactria-Margiana macro-region, at the present state of our knowledge, Bactria takes on a configuration of its own that is to some extent distinct from that of Margiana. This obvious situation at the level of seal production is in our opinion to be interpreted as a definite indication of an expected phenomenon, that of regional specificity within a substantially macro-regional cultural koine. The possible determinants of these regional differences is still a field to be explored at the level of both the mechanism of relations with other regions and perhaps also as regards the levels of socio-economic structuring inside the two regions. What appears undeniable is the fact that, from the point of view of the material culture in its broad outlines the two regions display a clear-cut and substantial homogeneity during the second half of the 3rd millennium B.C., which justifies speaking of a Bactro-Margiana civilization until this period. 124 [28]</page><page sequence="29">13.

They too are worthy of close attention as they are representative of a long tradition in the Middle East area.

The Harappan art is stylistically highly characterized although, as also During Caspers (1994b) pointed out, it still remains to address the problem of possible stylistic, and we add ? chronological ? distinctions within this important production. The definition of different stylistic and/or figurative 'raditions' within the large corpus of Indus seals could perhaps lead to a better understanding of the international trade routes of the 3rd and early 2nd millennium B.C., allowing the Indus seals found in regions different from their original one to be included in any such tradition. The Harappan seals found outside the regions covered by the Indus Civilization have been described by researchers (During Caspers 1994b) on a number of occasions and so we shall mention here only two specimens found at Altyn-depe in Turkmenistan, together with other materials probably imported from the Indus Valley and in a context that may be dated as Period NMZ V (Masson 1981b). No other specimen of this class of seals has yet been found in Margiana or Bactria, except for the one at Shortughai (Francfort 1989: pi. XLI.2). However, this is without doubt a colonial settlement (Id. 1984) or rather, as Lyonnet (1997: 74) suggests, the peak reached by a much earlier peopling phenomenon, the traces of which may today be followed clearly from the Middle Chalcolithic thanks of the Sarazm excavations in Tadjikistan (Isakov &amp; Lyonnet 1988; Lyonnet 1996). 19.

Sarianidi, who stressed the Margiana origin (Sarianidi 1981b) insofar as it is present in equal proportions both in Margiana and in southern Bactria. It thus represents further evidence of that strong cultural koine that still covers the two areas during the first half of the 2nd millennium.

Market Knox 1994: fig. 32 The stamp-cylinder has a long-standing tradition in the Near East area, as does the practice of stamping jars, particularly in the Syrian area. The distribution of the stamped jars and the long history of this practice were recently subjected to a very thorough and complete study by S. Mazzoni (1992). We shall therefore limit ourselves to making a few observations concerning the evidence provided by the Margiana and Bactria finds (Sarianidi 1992). With reference to the area with which we are concerned, the practice of stamping jars before firing seems to have been a local phenomenon in view of the association of impressions and seals. Furthermore, the fragments of stamped jars belong to local vase types in both shape and paste used. However, the presence of stamp cylinder specimens of the Bactro-Margiana type at Sibri, in the Quetta Valley, in contexts apparently datable to the late 3rd-early 2nd millennium B.C. cannot be linked to the Bactro-Margiana evidence in the specific sense of trade relations probably based on the presence of groups of merchants from Central Asia. The relations between the urban communities of the Bactro-Margiana area and the Indus Civilization are difficult to trace although they were certainly quite substantial during the NMZ V period, as is shown by the presence of Harappan seals at Altyn depe (Masson 1981a, 1981b), and Bactro-Margiana seals at Mohenjodaro (During Caspers 1994a, 1994b). To this must be added the find of a typical etched carnelian bead at Togolok (unpublished), the presence of several vase forms of obvious Harappan inspiration in the grave goods in the Middle Bronze Age cemetery of Gonur (Salvatori 1994b: fig. 5.1; 1995a: fig. 18; cf. Vats 1930: pi. XXIX c, d). Mention must also be again made of the stamp-cylinder with Harappan inscription in the British Museum (Knox 1994). Although the tradition of stamping jars with a cylinder stamp has been shown to have only a local dimension, the question of the origin of this tradition remains an open question as the cylinder seal is definitely an element that is culturally extraneous to the Central Asian area (see below). V. Sarianidi (1993a: 12-13) has already pointed out several affinities between the figures on the Gonur impression and Syro-Anatolian glyptic art. These affinities, for example, in the Taip specimen, were acknowledged by Mazzoni: *[...] in the Syrian animalistic repertoires of the second half of the 3rd millennium, particularly in a series of seals bearing tiny figures, often [37] 133</page><page sequence="38">having two registers separated by a guilloche' (Mazzoni 1992: 134). There is no doubt that, although the material elements testifying the relations between Bactro-Margiana and the Indus Valley are comparatively scarce, those referring to Syria are practically non existent. The only other element I am aware of, except for the evidence provided by the stamp-cylinders and their impressions on pottery, is the presence at Mari of a cross-shaped compartment stamp seal (Beyer 1989). 20.b (Fig. 15.8 Cylinder-seals S.

The seal, of which Sarianidi publishes only a modern impression, depicts a female figure seated on a snake, from the body of which emerge sprigs of vegetation. Before the seated figure there is a caprid squatting on another animal (? impression not clear enough). The seated figure is without doubt a vegetation divinity, the same as that appearing on a Tepe Yahya seal dating to the Akkadian Period (Potts D.T. 1981: fig. 1) and on two seals from Shahdad, Grave 163 (Hakemi 1997: p. 320 obj. no. 1792) and Grave 166 (ibid.: p. 324 obj. no. 1824). In both these Shahdad graves the cylinder seal is associated with a bronze open-work compartment seal of the Bactro-Margiana type (ibid.: p. 320 obj. no. 1791, p. 324 obj. no. 1830). The above three seals belong to a group that is extremely coherent from the stylistic and iconographic point of view and dating to the Akkadian period (Amiet 1986: 165-70; Winkelmann 1996: 159-60). A comparatively large number of cylinder seals come from Shahr-i Sokhta, while they are completely absent at Mundigak, the opposite pole of the Helmand Civilization. The majority of the Sistan finds, if not gathered on the surface, come from dwelling levels and graves dating to Period I of the Sistan city sequence (3400-2800 B.C.) (Amiet 1979, 1983; Amiet &amp; Tosi 1978; Piperno &amp; Salvatori n.d.). This corresponds to the phase of the great Proto-Elamite expansion towards the northeast quadrant and it is thus not surprising to find that one of the Bactrian cylinder seals displays a distinct Proto-Elamite affinity (Amiet 1977: 120-21) and that also the Sarazm specimen should belong to the same style class. (27) For a treatment of cylinder seals from Indus Civilization sites see During Caspers 1994b. 134 [38]</page><page sequence="39">The end of this expansionist thrust in around 2800 B.C. is followed by a rapid transformation that is recorded at Shahr-i Sokhta by the imposition of the compartment stamp seal tradition, while the use of the cylinder seal becomes decidedly more sporadic and secondary. Only five specimens can definitely be assigned to Period II, four of which from graves (Graves 17, 19, 738 inf., 749: Piperno &amp; Salvatori n.d.) and one from the Jar House in the Central Quarters (Room CDLXXIII,4) (Salvatori &amp; Vidale 1997: fig. 251.8). Already at the end of Period II the stamp seal had completely replaced the cylinder seal and there are no known specimens of the latter for Periods III and IV. The history of Shahr-i Sokhta sigillography is, in its exceptional nature, of significance for the entire Central Asia area. But it is precisely in such a framework that the presence of the cylinder seal in the Bactro-Margiana area in the late 3rd-early 2nd millennium B.C., in spite of the small number of finds must be viewed, despite its exceptionality, as a very significant fact that in all likelihood implies cultural and economic relations that today may be barely glimpsed or rather merely guessed at. 21.

LXXXI.4 Oman *Maysar During Caspers 1983: fig. 2 Conclusions Summarizing what has been outlined above, we can now state that the recent acquisitions yielded by stepping up research in Margiana, the systematic publication of the Shahdad necropolis in Central-Eastern Iran and the fresh evidence coming from the French excavations in Southern Baluchistan (Besenval &amp; Marquis 1993) provide a sure chronological and cultural framework for a large part of the materials from the graveyards plundered in the '70s in northern Afghanistan (Fig. 16). The Middle Bronze Age graves excavated at Gonur in the graveyard that extends westward from the larger depe (Gonur 1 North) have provided the expected confirmation of the direct association between the Bactrian type seals and the Namazga V cultural horizon of the southern Turkmenistan sequence (Salvatori 1994b, 1995a). This framework finally provides a suitable and non contradictory setting for a number of point source data from research carried out as part of the Murghab Archaeological Map project. Also from surface collections it in fact clearly emerges that an association exists between the bronze compartment seals and ceramic of the Middle Bronze Age in many sites discovered in the region (Masimov, Salvatori &amp; Udeumuradov 1998; Salvatori 1998b). Of comparable importance is the finding of fragments of composite Bactrian-style chlorite statuettes during the excavation of the palace of Gonur 1 North (Sarianidi 1998: fig. 18.8), that is, at Middle Bronze Age levels, together with bronze [39] 135</page><page sequence="40">compartment seals bearing both geometric and animalistic figures (ibid.: fig. 24.1-4). As mentioned earlier, a particularly significant event is the finding, againg at the Palace of Gonur 1 North, of a cylinder seal bearing the figure of a female divinity seated on a snake from the body of which emerge sprigs of vegetation. The seal belongs to the well-known group dated with certainty to the second half of the 3rd millennium, which includes specimens from both Tepe Yahya and the Shahdad graveyard. These and many other elements lead us to conclude that the characteristic production of metal compartment seals that was widespread in the piedmont zone of southern Turkmenistan, Margiana and Bactria, despite the clear-cut regional peculiarities reflected also in other classes of contemporary materials such as the production of terracotta female statuettes (Salvatori 1998b), is only one of the various elements characterizing a cultural koine that united the above three regions as early as the second half of the 3rd millennium B.C., and perhaps even earlier (although in this case the data are still scanty and fragmentary). It is thus necessary to radically revise the hypothesis expressed in the past by many researchers (e.g. Hiebert &amp; Lamberg-Karlovsky 1992; Sarianidi 1993a, 1998; Jarrige 1994) which situated this phenomenon of cultural affinity between the regions of Bactria and Margiana during the first half of the 2nd millennium B.C. as the virtually unexpected result of environmental crises and population migrations that occurred from time to time from southern Turkmenistan or Bactria or even Baluchistan. We now know that ever since the Chalcolithic, Central Asia, as confirmed by the recent Sarazm excavations in Tadjikistan (Lyonnet 1996), was the theatre of cultural events in the tradition of both southern Turkmenistan and Baluchistan. Consequently any overhasty and simplistic interpretation of a phenomenon so variable in time and space cannot describe events that take on an increasingly complex significance as the research progresses. Returning to the topic of seals and a more general framework it may be concluded that the area of the cylinder seal is strictly limited to the Mesopotamian and Proto Elamite regions between the end of the 4th and the 3rd millennium B.C. To the East the Proto-Elamite, and to a lesser extent, Sumerian, thrust, although limited to several Northwest Iranic directions, which spreads, and in some cases, imposes the cylinder seal which thus penetrates what would later become the unchallenged area of influence of the compartment stamp seal. Shahr-i Sokhta seems to mark the eastern boundary of this Proto-Elamite penetration: the Period I of the Sistan city is known not only to have yielded a Proto-Elamite tablet but also a substantial number of cylinder seals and clay impressions (Amiet 1979; Amiet &amp; Tosi 1978). Only incidentally and occasionally did this thrust take a more north-easterly direction, as is suggested by the seal published by P. Amiet, coming from Bactria and the specimen from Sarazm in far-off Zarafshan. Southern Turkmenistan, the Iranic North-East, Afghanistan and the Indus Valley are not included in the sphere of direct Proto-Elamite influence. The cessation of the phenomenon outside the consolidated boundaries of the Elamite world in around 2800/2700 B.C. was accompanied, also at Shahr-i Sokhta, as well as in the above-mentioned northern and eastern regions, by the introduction 136 [40]</page><page sequence="41">3800 3000 2600 2000 1600 I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I f ! ? Store cornportrrent nob Fig. 16 - Chronological assessment of the main classes of seals. of the compartment stone seal tradition (but also, albeit to a lesser extent, of the bone and ceramic tradition). Towards the mid 3rd millennium B.C. this was paralleled, in the southern Turkmenistan, eastern Iran and Afghanistan regions, by a metal version (28). In the Indus Valley itself another mainly quadrangular carved stamp seal with quite peculiar stylistic features was to prevail. The second half of the 3rd millennium B.C., at least as far as the still fragmentary documentation seems to indicate, saw the rise of different stylistic traditions in metal compartment seal production. In this the Bactro-Margiana area was to stand out alone, itself apparently characterized by aspects of regionalization that took on considerable significance in the field of open-work compartment seals. If what has been found for this type of seal is not the result of an uneven archaeological documentation, it must necessarily be inferred that, within the Bactro-Margiana macro-region, Bactria stood apart in that both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of its production was much richer and varied as far as the iconographic themes used and developed were (28) The specimens excavated by Besenval at Miri Qalat in southern Baluchistan may be considered forerunners of the type. [41] 137</page><page sequence="42">concerned. This Bactro-Margiana production is seen to be even more significant when it is found to be linked to widespread forms of trade and cultural exchange such as those suggested by its significant presence at Shahdad, the Iranic centre that without doubt represents the easternmost outpost of the Elamite world during the second half of the 3rd millennium B.C. Apparently less massive, although no less significant, is the presence of typically Bactro-Margiana seals at Tepe Yahya and Susa itself, on the one hand, and in the Indus Valley, on the other. At the end of the millennium a number of significant changes in the organization structure of the Central Asian urban communities led to the introduction of substantial variations also in seal production. The open-work compartment seal typical of the Bactro-Margiana macro-region was replaced by a variety of different forms, the chronological position of which has so far been understood only in broad outline and not in detail. During the 21st century B.C. a new type of metal stamp seal apparently appeared which was no longer compartment and bore carved figures on the flat surface (lost-wax casting) which thus produced an effect closely resembling that of the carved figures on stone seals. The shapes varied from circular to stepped lozenge. This was accompanied by the introduction of pin-head seals, if this was actually their function, made of bronze as well as a whole new series of stone seals, mainly quadrangular in shape but also in the stepped lozenge form, which often have a motif carved on both faces. As we pointed out above, in view of the fact that this type is distributed throughout the Bactro-Margiana area, it would seem incorrect to attribute a regional significance to these seals, as some have done by calling them Murghab seals. Over the same time span, which appears to take in the 21st and 19th century B.C., a group of cylinder seals with a stamp base. The commercial capacity of the Bactro-Margiana civilization again appears significant in this Period as is shown by the presence of this type of seal both in the Quetta region in Pakistan and in the Indus Valley. It is thus not surprising to find several specimens both in western Iran and on the western borders for the Dilmun kingdom, at Failaka, that is, in an area in which, between the 24th and the 19th/23rd centuries B.C. a very peculiar glyptic tradition was gradually established which, during its two great stylistic and chronological phases, was known as Gulf and Dilmun glyptic (Kjaerum 1983; Crawford 1991). Less clear is the chronological position of other types that are nevertheless abundant in the Bactro-Margiana area, above all round biface seals displaying a more cursive style, in which the figures, often limited to a small number of zoomorphic and occasionally anthropomorphic motifs, are obtained mainly using the drill-hole juxtaposition technique. As they are widespread throughout the Bactro-Margiana macro-region they cannot be linked solely to regional or local aspects. Furthermore, as their stratigraphic position is not clear, they cannot be generically included in the Late Bronze Age horizon. 138 [42]</page><page sequence="43">REFERENCES Amiet, P.
