GILL AND CHRISTOPHER CHIPPINDALE Abstract The purpose of this paper is to document the conse- quences, material and intellectual, of a recent rising re- gard for Cycladic figures as objects of the connoisseur's zeal. It explores the nature of the known corpus, which is composed of figures that have either come to light through archaeological excavation or by "surfacing" on the art market. The growing esteem for Cycladic figures has had certain material consequences for their study: archaeological contexts have been destroyed, the means of developing a reliable chronological sequence have been lost, regional variations in figure types have become blurred, and finally, the opportunity to understand the function of the figures has been missed. The intellectual consequences of the loss of archaeological information lead to a distortion in the perceptions of Cycladic prehis- tory and society. Attempts to identify the hands of "mas- ters" of sculptures appear to be misplaced: the underlying "canon" of Cycladic sculpture can be shown to be little more than a creation of chance. For the connoisseur, the value of a Cycladic figure largely resides in the object itself. For the archaeologist, the information immanent in the object provides elements of a larger story, the rest of which resides in a knowledge of context. The material consequences of the connois- seur's esteem, as we have been able to document them, are calamitous to the archaeological interest. The previ- ously fruitful three-way marriage of connoisseur, market- maker, and scholar is now coming under strain as the interests and motives of the three partners have become distinct.* INTRODUCTION: CONNOISSEURSHIP, ARCHAEOLOGY, AND CYCLADIC FIGURES An interest in ancient things has been, and is, di- rected by two modern concerns. Connoisseurship we define as esteem for, and appreciation of, beautiful artifacts, especially those that seem to fall into the domain of the fine and decorative arts. Archaeology we define as the study of past societies by means of * We thank the editors of AJA and Cyprian Broodbank, Brian Cook, Jack Davis, Rick Elia, Lesley Fitton, Pat Getz- Preziosi, Wolf-Dieter Heilmeyer, A.C.

In the field of Classical studies, connoisseurship has the longer history, going back to the regard for Hel- lenic arts that was the motive for Roman collection, removal, and copying of Greek decorative arts. For the most part the two concerns have gone harmoni- ously together in the hybrid discipline of Classical art history (so often effectively equated with Classical archaeology), which has been central to Classical learning over the last centuries. But they are distinct studies, and their distinct concerns and priorities have distinct consequences. Many elements of Classical ar- chaeology have no part in connoisseurship-the rub- ble masonry, fragmentary coarse ceramics, and animal bones that make up the bulk of surviving material remains from Classical antiquity. Equally, elements of connoisseurship provide no information about an- cient societies: the aesthetic regard held since the Renaissance for the surface qualities of bare white marble is a recent pleasure, quite separate from the ancient appearance of Hellenic statues that were ac- tually decorated in bright polychrome paint. The carved marble figures from the Cycladic ar- chipelago are instructive about the differing concerns of connoisseurship and archaeology. The figures were not part of the Greek canon that provided an ideal through the Roman period, the Renaissance, and into the 19th century.' They first came to light when the Hellenic ideal still dominated the Western aesthetic of sculpture, with the result that they were dismissed as unlovely curiosities. Within a few decades, however, the course of Western art chanced to take a path toward aesthetic forms that mimicked elements in the Cycladic figures. Accordingly, the 20th century, and especially the years since 1945, have seen the Cycladic figures, while remaining an important aspect of pre- historic archaeology in the Greek archipelago, move decisively into the connoisseur's domain. Cycladic ar- chaeological research in those decades has been no- table for aspects of excavation2 and field-survey of a considered thoroughness,3 in studying the special place of the Cycladic sequence in the larger develop- ment of Aegean cultures,4 and in concern for the maritime aspect of the archipelago and its settlement.5 The connoisseurship of Cycladic figures has seen grand exhibitions with large catalogues,6 a collecting Getz-Preziosi P.

Cycladic fig- ures are beginning to acquire names, like "Cycladic Statue of a Reclining Woman,"'2 to fit their standing as modern masterpieces. The same period, especially the decade of the 1960s, saw illicit looting of cemeteries and other places on the islands where figures and other fine artifacts may be found.'3 In this, Cycladic archaeology has suffered in the manner of other areas in the Classical world, notoriously the tombs of Etruscan Italy; in turn it is a prototype for what is now inflicted on, among many instances across the world, sites yielding terra- cotta figures in Mali, West Africa.'4 For these reasons, the prehistoric figures of the Cyclades offer a case study in the material and intel- lectual consequences of aesthetic esteem for a partic- ular class of antiquities. For many classes of Classical antiquities, whether sculpture, painted pottery, or bronze castings, the aesthetic interest has long run alongside the archaeological; for coarseware and farm implements, the interest still remains archaeological alone. The Cycladic case is unusual in that a long- standing archaeological concern has recently been joined by a new respect for its aesthetics, which has moved it decisively from an archaeological backwater into the aesthetic mainstream.'15 This accident of his- tory allows the two traditions, so often melded in Classical archaeology, to show some of their distinc- tions. Part of the story is the renewed cult of the collector as celebrity and of the museum as spectacle, as much concerned with show business as with schol- arship.'6 Some of what is set out here is well known. We excuse the necessary length of the paper because we think the whole picture, or as much as a long paper will hold, amounts to very much more than the ob- vious pattern of the few fragments that are common knowledge. We have occasionally gone beyond the narrow Cycladic story when it is relevant to some more general issue; to keep the discussion in bounds, we have generally taken examples or quotations for those larger issues from a small number of representative sources. One of these ethical issues concerns the view that museums take of looted antiquities, an important la Collection N.P. Goulandris" (Paris: Grand Palais, 1984); catalogue in English, C.

Most museums no longer pre- tend they can ignore the history of objects they wish to acquire or display on loan. While some museums persist in exhibiting antiquities of unknown, and therefore dubious, recent history,'s others have pub- licly distanced themselves from the looting.'9 This paper begins with the material consequences, the issue museums recognize, and goes on to the intellectual consequences, which raise many equivalent questions that the academic community is reluctant to notice. Many of the recent publications on Cycladica, and the new regard for its aesthetics, are due to a small number of scholars who have specialized in the sub- ject, especially Getz-Preziosi, Renfrew, and Thimme. Our paper therefore depends on, and makes frequent reference to, their work. Each of them, like other scholars with Cycladic expertise, has made their own decision about whether or not to participate in advis- ing, assessing, or valuing for the market, their attitude toward Cycladic figures of uncertain history, and their relation to private, public, and quasi-public collections of Cycladic artifacts, of varied history. The strains of balancing these several and difficult ethical and prac- tical interests are evident in Renfrew's recent Cycladic Spirit.20 One of us, Chippindale, has no experience himself of working in a field infested by looted and smuggled objects; and neither of us wishes to preach. We are fond of these objects ourselves, and part of that fondness is in our finding them strange and alien; but we do think that our response, founded in our individual selves and for the larger part in the aes- thetics of our present society, has little to do with the meaning of Cycladic figures in their own age. THE MATERIAL, INTELLECTUAL, AND MARKET DISCOVERY OF CYCLADIC FIGURES21 Cycladic figures have no part in the common canon of ancient treasures22 in the era of the grand tour, although reference to them can be found at an early date. Italian travelers refer to idoli and idoletti in 1771;23 an early scholarly reference to a Cycladic figure dates to 1818, a figure discovered by the Earl of Aberdeen in a grave near Athens.24 Two were part of the collection, formed in Greece, of the sixth Vis- count Strangford (1783-1855), ambassador there,25 and one was left to the British Museum in 1840.26 Prominent in the earliest Cycladic material to find its way to European collections are the figures that came to light a little over a century ago, excavated by James Theodore Bent during his travels in the Cyc- lades, 1883-1884,27 and subsequently acquired by the British Museum. The Museum built up its collection of Cycladic material in the later part of the 19th century;28 some purchases have been made subse- quently.29 The university museums of Cambridge (Fitzwilliam Museum) and Oxford (Ashmolean Mu- seum) seem to have derived their Cycladic collections in part through the good offices of members of the British School at Athens. The Fitzwilliam acquired its first Cycladic figures through R.C. Bosanquet in 1901 and its last in 1934.30 The Ashmolean started its col- 17 See esp. K.D.

The Staatliche Kunstsammlungen in Dresden had Cycladic figures by 1841,32 and the Badisches Landesmuseum in Karls- ruhe by the early 19th century; Karlsruhe followed with a burst of acquisitions from the 1960s, when the Cycladic figures had gained their new and higher status.33 First perceptions of Cycladic figures were hostile to their aesthetics, which is why the intellectual context of these first acquisitions was more archaeological than artistic. The Karlsruhe catalogue is introduced with early opinions such as "small monsters made of bits of marble," "ugly," and "barbarian."'4 Greek and ancient, they came by degrees also to be "art," making their entry into studies of ancient Greek sculpture in 189235 and of ancient Greek art in 1894,36 at first generally qualified by the word primitive;37 one finds the word "primitive" again in the British Museum catalogue of 1928, which places Cycladic figures along with some from Anatolia and one from Cyprus into a class of "primitive idols."38 Important to the growing appreciation of the artistic value of the figures were the opportunities for some great European sculptors of the 20th century to see and be inspired by them. Modern artists' discovery of the Cycladic figurines dates to, and is part of, a general turning to non- Western art as inspiration for artists of the new cen- tury. Jacob Epstein discovered early Greek works and Cycladic sculpture displayed in the Louvre in 1902- 1905.39 The work of Constantin Brancusi so evokes the Cycladic in its simplicity of form and restriction of detail that Epstein and others believed Brancusi to have been inspired by the Cycladic figures that he could have seen in Paris.40 Henry Moore acknowl- edged affinities of his work to the Cycladic figures he saw in the British Museum from 1920,41 later writing of their force among the many ancient things he valued in the British Museum collections.42 Moore owned three Cycladic figures himself.43 Picasso owned one and reputedly said of it, "Better than Brancusi. Nobody has ever made an object stripped that bare."44 Barbara Hepworth's work is seen to echo the Cycladic, directly or via the Cycladic look of Moore's,45 and Alberto Giacometti acknowledged affinities between his own work and Cycladic art.46 In due time these young sculptors became the ma- ture masters of the modern movement, and with es- teem for their work came esteem for the primitive and prehistoric figures that the modern masters echoed or followed. It is immaterial whether Cycladic sculpture influenced the moderns consciously or un- consciously, or whether the coincidence of forms is a mere happenstance; it suffices that the Cycladic fig- ures fall within the same aesthetic frame. Accordingly, they are treated as belonging together, and those modern collections interested in non-Western ana- (GR.53.1902); 1924, one figure (GR.17.1924); 1933, six fig- ures (GR.8c.1933, 8a, 8b, 8d, 8e, 8f); 1934, one figure (GR.4.1934).

GILL AND CHRISTOPHER CHIPPINDALE [AJA 97 logues to contemporary sculpture like the Sainsbury Collection at the University of East Anglia, Norwich, give Cycladic art special attention.47 Cycladic art has come to find a natural home in collections primarily of modern or tribal art. When the collecting of mod- ernist sculptures in North America began after the Second World War, the collecting of Cycladica fol- lowed, well after the time when the main British collections had been formed.48 A great many figures surfaced in the 1960s;49 as Getz-Preziosi has re- marked,50 this was in part due to the publication in 1957 of C. Zervos's study of Cycladic art.51 There are two views of this coincidence between ancient Cycladic and early 20th-century aesthetics. Either it is largely coincidence, the modernist search for pure forms underlying surface complexity hap- pening to arrive at geometries to represent the human form similar to those reached in Cycladic art, or it expresses controlling universals in aesthetics and a unity of human spirit. With Renfrew, we favor the former view, which is why we are puzzled that he invokes a mystical Cycladic spirit in terms drawn from the latter.52 Table 6 (infra p. 616) documents the dates when some major museums acquired Cycladic figures. The British collections, established early, contrast most with those in the United States, which echo the boom of the last three decades in private American collec- tions. In addition to the archaeological collections in Greek public museums, mention must be made of the Goulandris Collection.5 This important collection, after special exhibitions in Japan, the United States, and Europe,54 has been installed in a fine new building in Athens. It has served the purpose, important for the Greek authorities, of keeping Cycladic figures in Greece, though it is composed of objects that have lost their archaeological context. During the period of intense looting in the 1960s, Christos Doumas ex- plains, "individuals were encouraged to collect Cy- cladic objects and so prevent them from being taken out of Greece. Thus several private collections ob- tained figurines and vases: the most notable of these is the Goulandris Collection which was begun at this time and subsequently enlarged to the point where it has become the largest and finest private collection of Early Cycladic art in the world."55 The Goulandris, with official encouragement, has kept Cycladic figures in Greece, specifically in the mainland capital of Greece-not in the Cyclades. They have been removed to the controlling center of the modern nation-state, where they help extend the modern national self-esteem and identity. When pho- tographed against the intense color of the Aegean Sea,56 the Cycladic figures make a physical prehistory for the blue-and-white colors of the modern national flag. If one chooses to question those identities, one may doubt if Athens, Greece, really is a more natural resting-place for a Cycladic figure than Athens, Geor- gia. The role of the Goulandris Collection, in gathering together "orphaned" figures, may provide an effective floor for the market, if the market-makers believe that the Goulandris is always alert to acquire Cycladica at some agreed fair price. In so doing, the Goulandris mission may inadvertently support the market and encourage the flow of new finds into the marketplace. Ricardo Elia, reviewing The Cycladic Spirit,57 says: "Renfrew asks the reader to think of the formation of the Goulandris Collection as 'rescuing' Cycladic figures from the international art market: more likely, looters plundered Cycladic graves with the specific intention of selling their booty to the Goulandrises." Permission was refused by the Greek authorities for a few important Cycladic objects to travel from "a private collection in Athens"58 to the 1976 Karlsruhe exhibition, despite "years of petitioning." This, the exhibition organizers' "one severe disappointment," prevented these items, held legitimately within Greece, from being put on display in Germany along- 47 The Sainsbury Collection has 10 Cycladic figures, ac- quired between 1955 and 1977: UEA346, UEA348, UEA358, UEA352, UEA340, UEA339, UEA341, UEA668, UEA350, UEA342; also a marble ring with spouted bowl, two carved marble vessels, and a ceramic vessel.

After court action before the Sothe- by's sale of the Erlenmeyer Collection in July 1990, three items were withdrawn from the auction, and purchased by the Greek government;60 they are now in the Goulandris Collection.61 Sotheby's went to great lengths to reassure collectors and dealers that no pieces on offer would be further pursued by the Greek government; responding to market concern, a Sotheby's spokeswoman said, "As the Cycladic pieces were actually sold to the [Greek] government there is nothing to be nervous about." We have noted above the role of quasi-official purchases by the Goulandris as supporting the market; these three pieces were bought, according to Sotheby's, "at prices that re- flected their market value."62 Others were purchased for the Goulandris from those that remained in the subsequent July auction, and from another Sotheby's sale of Cycladic items from the Erlenmeyer Collection in December 1990.63 Discovery by the public and private market of Cy- cladic figurines has matched the rise in other interests, as the trade has widened the old aesthetic range to include non-Western visual arts, ancient and recent, as well as other "collectibles," like classic cars, not previously thought of as art objects. Cycladic figures have not yet passed through public sales in sufficient numbers and for sufficient years for it to be possible to construct a reliable index of their rising values over the years, as in Reitlinger's Economics of Taste,64 but their rising status over the decades is plain enough. One of many evident signs that the most expensive Cycladic figures have now reached a major art league is the treatment given to the star item in the Erlen- meyer sale, lot 137 at Sotheby's, 9 July 1990, "a Cy- cladic marble fragmentary male figure, Early Bronze Age II, said to be from Amorgos, Spedos Variety, circa 2600-2400 B.C." No estimate is printed in the catalogue, an indication that a serious sum was ex- pected, but "estimate on request"; the estimate given, when one of us requested, was ?250,000-300,000, this although the piece is fragmentary and its security of provenance, "said to be Amorgos," was further weakened by the catalogue comment that "it is quite possible that it was actually recovered on Keros."65 The first stage of the aesthetic discovery of Cycladic art, then, was to recognize its high place in the prim- itive world of "the other": Cycladic art from the Sainsbury Collection was shown at the Museum of Primitive Art, New York, in 1963.66 A second stage is perceptible now, as Cycladic begins to fall also within the domain of the Classical, if one goes beyond an old and narrow definition. In its first years' purchases after its founder's endowment became available about 1981, the J. Paul Getty Museum enlarged its Classical holdings within the conventional Graeco-Roman range collected by J. Paul Getty himself; recently it turned toward earlier Greece, to the Archaic, with a controversial purchase of a kouros of unexplained history,67 and to the Cycladic with the 1988 purchase 59 Petrasch (supra n. 8) 10. 60 K.

GILL AND CHRISTOPHER CHIPPINDALE [AJA 97 of five figures from the Steiner Collection.68 Its direc- tor, John Walsh, remarked in 1990 of one of these: "There is a wonderful Cycladic figure of a harpist, now part of a distinguished group of prehistoric Ae- gean objects of the sort that did not interest Mr Getty at all."69 Shelby White and Leon Levy began their celebrated New York collection by purchasing Clas- sical art; then their curiosity led them to wonder about the antiquities that came before and that followed ancient Greece, and led them to acquire Cycladic and Neolithic objects from Greece.o7 At the same time, the new esteem makes the Goulandris Museum, devoted to Cycladic art alone, a treasure as fine as any other in Athens. It is said that the presence of works of a single "sculptor" such as Getz-Preziosi's "Goulandris Master" in the "great" museums of the world neces- sarily implies the figures are themselves great.7' As Cycladic figures now possess such virtue that they deserve fine museums, so it follows that the presence of Cycladic figures makes a museum fine. And as the presence of a Cycladic Master's work in a great mu- seum validates the standing of both the Master and the museum, so may the association of a dealer with a museum validate by its purchases the dealer's stand- ing and judgment. These motives and interests for the rise of Cycladica concern the aesthetics of the figures. A separate con- venience arises from their size. Typically, Cycladic figures are only about the length of one's forearm, or rather less. In the heyday of collecting, the acquisition of fine antiquities went with the building of grand houses, or even whole landscapes to fit the Classical manner. Now that houses are smaller, and the wealthy live more often in city apartments, finding house- room for works of art encourages the private collector to prefer the smaller object, old or new. The same pressures even affect the museums, increasingly feel- ing the cost per cubic meter of their galleries and fearing they will run out of space. But smaller objects, often delightful, and more practical to manage, lose by their smallness; they are less sublime, less able to impress with bulk and grandeur. Here, the Cycladic figures provide an admirable way forward. They are physically small, just the right size to stand on a Manhattan mantelpiece,72 yet they contrive also to be monumental in manner; well lit to make the best impression, as in the fine photographs, they look very much larger than they actually are. Where a Rothko requires a wall five meters square, and a Moore de- mands a floor reinforced to bear a couple of tons, the Cycladic figure is domestic in its needs. A finer view of Cycladic figures is part of the present privileging of the pretty portable object. THE KNOWN CORPUS AND ITS PROVENANCE Getz-Preziosi estimates the total corpus of known Cycladic figures as 1,600.71 This corpus of figures has come to light, and then to public notice, in various ways: by casual finds; by legitimate archaeological investigation; or by "surfacing" in collections. Casual Finds Archaeologists, on systematic survey, or walking at known sites, have occasionally come across figures, or figure fragments, as surface finds. A "stray find" from Trypiti on Melos is reported by Zapheiropoulou.74 In 1963, Colin Renfrew collected four fragments75 from the surface of the site at Dhaskalio in Keros. For centuries, farmers must have turned up stray figures; in 1884, Bent reported of Arkesine on Amorgos that "ancient tools, vases, and statuettes are turned over every time [the old farmer who owns the place] ploughs."76 A very few of these older finds may have been conveyed into the corpus.77 Archaeological Investigation We have attempted to gather together, as table 1, a list of Cycladic figures from archaeological excava- tions, or other findspots of reliable security. It has proved difficult. Many figures are published or re- ferred to in ways that leave their recent history ob- scure. 68 "Cycladic Sculptures amongst Getty Museum Acquisi- tions," Minerva (June 1990) 46, following GettyMusJ 17 (1989). 69 J.

GILL AND CHRISTOPHER CHIPPINDALE [AJA 97 Legitimate archaeological excavation of the Cy- cladic cemeteries has provided many examples of fig- ures, beginning with Bent's work at two cemeteries on Antiparos in 1883-1884.95 Excavations on the is- lands of Paros, Antiparos, Despotiko, Naxos, Amor- gos, and Syros have recovered approximately 143 examples from among the grave goods in more than 1,600 graves. One figure of the Cycladic type has been found on Crete in a communal tomb at Koumasa.96 Figures are not, however, confined to graves. Some 43 examples were found at Ayia Irini on the island of Keos,97 a probable thigh from a figure at Mikre Vigla on Naxos,98 and several at Phylakopi on Melos, in domestic or quasi-domestic contexts.99 One of the largest concentrations was found on Keros where "dozens" of fragmentary folded-arm figures were found by Doumas and Zapheiropoulou, with four further fragments and one complete figure found at later dates;'00 this has been seen as either a cemetery or a sanctuary deposit.1'0 Doumas reported "hun- dreds of fragments of figurines" from this site, a number that would cause an upward revision of present notions about the size of the Cycladic cor- pus.102 The ground at the site is littered with human bone, as well as figure fragments; whatever the site amounts to, it was in part funerary. "Surfacing" In addition to the excavated material, the corpus of known figurines has been swollen by the numerous examples that have "surfaced" in the art market dur- ing, mostly, recent decades. By "surfaced," we refer to the first appearance as a work of art of an object whose finding or excavation in the field has never been reported. These objects, which appear in an exhibition or sale without history, previous publica- tion, or other account, we take to have surfaced there for the first time. There are essentially three sources for this: the illicit excavation of archaeological sites; the modern creation of objects; and the reemergence of figures from the obscurity of "old collections" where they had been forgotten. Illicit Excavation Since the end of the 19th century it has been rec- ognized that archaeological sites were being looted to provide figures for museums and collectors. Bosan- quet reported in 1897 that "still more necessary [than museum study] is the systematic excavation of ceme- teries, a branch of research which Greek archaeolo- gists have too often left to peasants in the pay of dealers."103 Occasionally, illicit finds end up in museums when confiscated by the authorities,'04 such as two figures from Naxos (Phionta).'05 The rest go into that pool of unprovenanced and uncertainly provenanced Cy- cladic figures in which the private and public collec- tors fish. Christos Doumas vividly remembers the looting craze: "They were everywhere. On moonlight nights they were digging everywhere, and so I was running behind to rescue what I could. There must be hundreds of cemeteries from the late 1950s, early 1960s onwards and some of them, they have been totally ruined. We don't know any existing cemetery that has not been touched."'06 These illicit excavations continue to dog Cycladic studies. In 1987 Paul N. Perrot, Director of the Vir- ginia Museum of Fine Arts, noted in his foreword to the exhibition catalogue Early Cycladic Art in North American Collections that the qualities of Cycladic sculpture "have caused decades of clandestine looting, abuses that make it so difficult today not only to trace the evolution of the producing society but also to gain any understanding of the relationships among the various forms that have been preserved." Getz-Pre- ziosi, writing the same year, identified the new pop- ularity as the specific cause of the new destruction: "to meet the strong demand, unauthorized excavation of Cycladic sites has flourished uncontrollably and, 95 Bent 42-59.

Not one of the figures in the Virginia exhibition is of a known provenance; rather more than a third are "said to be" from island x or y, and the provenance of nearly two-thirds is unknown. The Cycladic artifacts are even less securely tied to origin. In the exhibition catalogue, Getz-Pre- ziosi looks to quite a different cause for so many unstated provenances: "Very few recently acquired works are fresh finds. Many of them have come to the United States from European collections."'09 Whether this is an adequate explanation depends on whether they were transferred from old European collections where they had been many years, or whether they were themselves recent European ac- quisitions; we give cause below to doubt whether old European collections can be a source of Cycladic fig- ures in such quantity. Getz-Preziosi's statement is sup- ported by a note: "a majority of the objects in the exhibition are in compliance with the resolution passed by the Council of the Archaeological Institute of America on December 30, 1973."110 The assurance is cheering, but no evidence is offered to support it. The resolution, the AIA's second on plundering and looted artifacts, commended museums to coop- erate in endeavors to prevent illicit traffic in cultural property by "refusing to acquire through purchase, gift, or bequest cultural property exported subse- quent to December 30, 1973, in violation of the laws obtaining in the countries of origin.""' So Getz-Pre- ziosi's reassurance, "a majority ... are in compliance," misses the point of the AIA resolution, which was to stop the entry of all smuggled items into museums- not to ensure that smuggled items made up only half of their acquisitions. Even in her terms, it is not an 107 To attempt a consistent classification for security of provenance throughout this paper, we have adopted a set of four categories: "known"; "said to be"; "possibly" or "per- haps"; and "unknown." Different catalogues from which we have drawn up the tables use phrasings that do not always exactly correspond to these, such as "probably," or the plac- ing of inverted commas around a provenance, which we take as equivalent to "said to be"; in these cases we have endeav- ored to place these as fairly as we can into our four-category schema. In all cases we depend on the authority and judg- ment of the cataloguers, whose own points of reference may vary. Anomalies will remain; for example, in considering the Karlsruhe exhibition we class provenances for figures of Anatolian style that are declared as "from Asia Minor" in the "known" category, although such a vague provenance may not amount to much more than a restatement of their having a distinctive Anatolian style. Again, provenances in the Karlsruhe catalogue rarely fall into the "possibly"/"per- haps" category. 108 SC x. See also Doumas, in Renfrew 1991, 28. 109 ECANAC 84. 110 ECANAC 89 n. 34.

The other 33 have a de- clared provenance-that is, some declared place of origin-though not a single piece comes from a se- cure, properly described archaeological context; there is simply a "said to be," the usual undocumented and unsubstantiated assertion that the item in question comes from somewhere or other. Whether an item falls within or beyond the AIA pale (equally, whether within or beyond the Greek law) depends on when it left the Cyclades and Greek territory, so statements that are vague as to place and silent as to date are not material. The Virginia exhibition is a major event in Cycladic scholarship, so the status of its contents is important. We asked Dr. Getz-Preziosi about this, and reproduce her reply of 4 June 1993 in full: By "fresh finds" I mean objects that are not in com- pliance with the resolution passed by the AIA on 30 December 1973. Many of the works that have come to the U.S. in recent years were previously in European collections formed after WW II (but before 1973). As for individual figures in the Virginia Museum catalogue and exhibition, I find 21 whose history I cannot trace back to 1973 or earlier. Some of them may very well be in compliance; I simply do not have the necessary information to state whether they are or not. One of the figures was recently given to the Benaki Museum. For the rest, information in the form of acqui- sition numbers in the case of museums, actual or closely approximate years of purchase in the case of private collections, publication prior to the date of the resolu- tion, or inclusion in my doctoral dissertation of 1972 are clear indications that they had left Greece before the cut-off date. I should mention that all the pieces included in my dissertation were seen by me outside Greece and in the 1960s. Further, pieces said to be from Keros belong to the "Keros hoard" which left Greece c. 1960 or before. In two cases, nos. 52 and 83, I now have information unavailable to me when I wrote the cata- logue entries: no. 52 had left Greece at least by 1972, perhaps considerably earlier; no. 83 belongs to the Keros hoard and joins no. 82. If I do not have full information on the history of every piece, this is because some collectors cannot recall when they acquired their objects or do not know their prior history, or because I neglected to ask for specific information. To me, an orphaned Cycladic figure is just as much an orphan whether it surfaced in 1874 or 1974, whether it is in a Greek collection or an American one. However destructive illicit digging may be for the ar- chaeological record, I believe the objects found in this way deserve full scholarly attention. Although the cir- cumstances of their recovery may be illegitimate, the objects themselves are not. They should not be ignored because their discovery context is lost or because they were unearthed in an unethical fashion, or because they lack the credentials conferred by authorized excavation to assure their authenticity. I regard it as my responsi- bility to learn as much from the illicitly found material as possible and to share the objects and my ideas about them through publication. This does not mean that I condone the looting of sites. I do not. Some of the declared Karlsruhe provenances may not be correct. Take for example the pair of marble figures (cat. nos. 9 and 10) and the pair of marble pyxides (cat. nos. 138 and 139). These first "surfaced" in 1971, in the gallery of an antiquities dealer in London.112 The objects were displayed at Karlsruhe in 1976; appendix 5 to the Karlsruhe catalogue has a discussion of "an early Keros-Syros grave group 'from Marathon'.""3 By 1987 Getz-Preziosi had doubts on the security of this archaeological grouping, although she repeated the provenance of Marathon. She pointed out that although the figures belonged to the EC I horizon (ca. 3000-2800 B.C.), the pyxides be- longed to EC II (ca. 2700-2200 B.C.)."4 Either this was a grave used perhaps over 800 years, or the objects were not found together; if the latter, then the statement of association falls, and the provenance of Marathon is suspect.'5 In regard to provenances in general, Getz-Preziosi says that "for the great majority of the known pieces of sculpture the precise find- places have been lost (or, worse, falsified).""6 A previous AIA resolution, of 1970, condemned "the destruction of the material and historical records of the past by the plundering of archaeological sites both in the United States and abroad and by the illicit export and import of antiquities.""'

Further fragments from Keros were dispersed, although in 1975 Getz-Preziosi was able to study many pieces with the "original" owner.119 The passing of time and the association of the frag- ments with a named collection were not sufficient to prevent criticism and even outrage when the Erlen- meyer Collection came up for auction at two sales at Sotheby's in London during 1990.120 The North American Cycladic exhibition demon- strates how museums and private collectors alike have ignored the loss of context when faced with the op- portunity to acquire. Sixteen figures in the exhibition are said to have come from Keros.121 The provenance of one of these, no. 73 (acquired by the Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco, in 1981), is stated in the catalogue as "reputedly found on Keros"; this figure was published elsewhere by Getz-Preziosi as coming not just from Keros, but specifically from the Keros hoard.122 The dates of acquisition of "Keros" figures (table 3) are instructive, remembering that the Keros 118 Getz-Preziosi 1983. A site on the southwest coast of Keros, opposite the islet of Daskaleio, is reckoned the likely place of origin of the Keros hoard, as a great many fragments of figures, marble vessels, and pots (also one whole figure) were found in 1963 and 1967 haphazardly scattered there, "strewn about the surface, in the fill, at no consistent depth, rather like potatoes in a field": SC 136.

The match between finds from this site and those of the hoard is very good: SC 136. 119 Getz-Preziosi 1983, 37. It should be noted that the "original" owner, who wished "to remain anonymous," still had the potential to release fragments from the Keros de- posit as late as 1976. Whether these fall within the letter of the AIA resolution depends on whether these had been acquired before 1974. In any case, the export was still illegal under Greek law. It is not clear who Getz-Preziosi refers to by the words "original owner"; if it is a looter, a dealer, or a collector outside Greece to whom the items were illicitly conveyed, then this person(s) is in no sense the "original" proprietor. 120 Sotheby's, 9 July 1990; further items from Keros were auctioned at Sotheby's, 13-14 December 1990.

Since there was once a time when Cycladic figures, like other antiquities, could be moved more freely among nations, a breakdown of when the figures in the exhibition first surfaced is of relevance (table 4). Using the 1970 AIA resolution as a watershed (as Getz-Preziosi suggests), some 47% (43 out of 92) of the figures surfaced after the resolution.125 The ma- jority of these are in private American collections. Their appearance in an exhibition such as this publi- cizes, celebrates, and legitimates the pieces, to some extent making them authentic and respectable; rather than just "from a private collection," they may now be said to have been "exhibited at the Virginia Mu- seum of Fine Arts, the Kimbell Art Museum, or the Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco." This celebrity raises their value should their owner wish to dispose of them. Attribution to named masters has the same effect. The history of the Hunt Collection well illustrates this point. The Hunts' Greek vases and Greek, Ro- man, and Etruscan bronzes were celebrated in a 1983 exhibition at the Kimbell Art Museum, Fort Worth, entitled "Wealth of the Ancient World," the catalogue of which was published in association with Summa Galleries of California, from which some of the pieces had been acquired. 26 When hard times and tax de- mands overwhelmed the Hunt brothers, the collection was sold in New York in June 1990 in a much-hyped sale that achieved exceptional prices.'12 The Hunt Collection did not include Cycladic pieces. The Thetis Foundation Collection, which followed much the same route of public celebration before a dispersal sale, did. Exhibited and celebrated at the Mus&amp;e d'art et d'histoire, Geneva, in 1987, it was auctioned in London in May 1991;128 the first 22 items were Ana- tolian and Cycladic items. The auction catalogue in- dicates that they surfaced in the usual way. Of the 14 Cycladic items, the only references offered in the sale descriptions for 13 are to the catalogue of the 1987 Thetis exhibition in Geneva;129 the 14th, an anthro- pomorphic beaker, was in Karlsruhe in 1976, when its provenance was declared as "unknown."'30 The prices achieved for fine Cycladic figures, such as those from the Erlenmeyer Collection, reflect their pro- motion. The 1976 Cycladic exhibition at Karlsruhe itself contained a high percentage of objects without secure provenance or coming from illicit excavations such as Keros. The pattern of security of context for the Karlsruhe show is given in table 5. Of the Cycladic figures, more than half are of unknown provenance, and scarcely more than one-eighth of known prove- nance. For the show as a whole, well over half the items are of unknown provenance, and less than a quarter are of known provenance. Since the Karlsruhe loans were largely from Eu- rope, and the Virginia loans from North America, we find telling the strong pattern, evident in both exhi- 123 Subsequent investigation of the findspot of the Keros hoard tells more of the context, but neither identifies deci- sively the character of the archaeological context nor--of course--defines just what the hoard contained.

During the 1960s, some mitigation of the loss of information was provided by archaeological salvage of what looters had overlooked or left in their holes, on Herakleia, Keros, Melos, and Naxos,'32 including figurines and fragments. Is it possible to quantify the damage caused by illegal excavations? We think not. No cause has been offered to contradict Broodbank's view on the plundering of Dhaskaleio-Kavos-"most dismal of archaeological prospects: the virtual bomb-site incon- gruously overlooking the brilliant blue sea, with the wreckage of material spread over the churned-up slopes of what was once the most extraordinary loca- tion in the Cyclades."'33 New Manufacture A natural context for forgery is the emergence of a demand that no conventional supply can meet. In- terestingly, the Cycladic supply did indeed change along with the demand: it was "the 1960s, especially, [that] saw a burgeoning in ... the availability of objects 131 We have taken an insecure provenance to be one that is placed within inverted commas in the catalogue as well as those reported to come from the Keros deposit. 132 Doumas (supra n. 2) 186.

It is remarkable that the best pieces did not appear before the 1960s. Could it be, as Getz-Preziosi has noted, that this phenomenon is linked to the higher incidence of forged statuettes? In 1971, H. Hoffmann offered the following advice to prospective proprie- tors of Cycladic figurines: A New York dealer confided a "foolproof" test for Cycladic idols to me, and I shall pass it along for what it is worth. Hold the object between thumb and forefin- ger and strike it lightly on a doorsill, like a tuning fork. A forgery will emit a clear bell-like ring, whereas a genuine idol emits a dull thump. It is, of course, nec- essary to experiment with both genuine and imitation idols in order to accustom one's ear to the proper sound. (I must admit that I have not yet mastered the tech- nique.)'38 The Karlsruhe exhibition drew attention to the growing problem of forged Cycladic figures. As early as 1967, J. Thimme had reportedly grown suspicious of "a group of 'Cycladic' idols" whose authenticity he doubted on a number of grounds: the figures either were of exceptionally large size-up to 120 cm in height-or else represented rare forms (e.g., double idols and musicians) which commanded especially high prices.139 Their surface was of peculiar appear- ance, they were all broken at head and knee, and they had been repaired with the same adhesive. Various aspects of the figures (features of execution, compo- sition of the stone, surface encrustation) were studied with different techniques-geochemical analysis, x- ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, and ultraviolet light analysis. Among further figures examined after 1969 was a group of three "unbroken and unusually refined figures which one was inclined to consider too beautiful to be genuine."'14 Thimme's and Riederer's methods of 20 years ago were intended to develop a knowledge of surface encrustations that would authenticate ancient marble objects.'4' Others we have consulted who have also explored the detection of fake marble objects have less or little confidence that fakes can be identified in this way; marble figures in the early 1990s remain beyond authentication by methods of physical sci- ence-the famous "Getty kouros" is suspected of being fake, but it has not yet been decisively authen- 134 British Museum, Ashmolean Museum, and Fitzwilliam Museum. 135 Dresden and Karlsruhe. 136 ECANAC.

We are reliably told that the surface of modern Cycladic figures can be enhanced to a helpful "age" by wrapping in whole- wheat spaghetti, whose strands leave marks happily like those left by roots in the ground.'42 Mild acid is also recommended. A celebrated Cycladic collector, we are reliably informed, was persuaded that the appearance of a figure under ultraviolet radiation would show if it was genuine, and added an ultraviolet lamp to the collecting equipment on the yacht. Old surfaces fluoresce under ultraviolet light, new ones do not. Fakers who keep up with science in archae- ology, however, know that the fluorescence of age can be mimicked by heating a new figure.'43 The known period of busy faking is the 1960s. Doumas notes that fakes were so numerous--or fear of fakes so prevalent-that the level of looting of Cycladic sites was reduced in the 1970s.'44 Hood wrote in 1978 that "the problem of forgery cannot be ig- nored in considering them. Demand has clearly ex- ceeded supply, and modern workshops in Athens and Naxos are reported as happily responding with figu- rines made of the same island marble."'45 Doumas thinks the forgeries come "probably from artists' ate- liers in Paris or other centres in the international art market."'46 John Hewitt, a London dealer of long experience, remembers a whole group of forgeries that came out in the early 1950s, which had been made in Greece (he does not know where); the group was so large that he thinks of several master forgers rather than just one, the work of whom is still fooling people today.4"' The ready modern availability of marble from the various islands also ensures that typing of the marble sources by chemical signatures distinctive to an island or deposit, as has been at- tempted,'48 would not assist in recognizing fakes. Getz-Preziosi was careful in her study of the presumed sculptors: "I have resisted all temptation to reproduce figures of unusual types or unusually large size- forgers' favorites-that I have not had the opportu- nity to study 'in the flesh'."'49 Getz-Preziosi goes on: "Even so, one can expect a skeptical reaction to some of the more unusual pieces, at least, on the part of some readers, particularly those who find it difficult to accept as incontestably genuine sculptures that do not come from documented exca- vations or whose pedigrees do not extend back into the last century."'50 The figures with history known back to the last century are, as we have seen, very few. Unhappily, we cannot presume that objects acquired before the 1960s' boom, or even before the more modest collecting prior to the Second World War, are immune from suspicion. Take, for example, the small figurine in the Fitzwilliam Museum, acquired in 1934 and said to have been found on the island of los.'55 The type is rare, and its genuineness has sometimes been brought into question. The body is similar to a large figurine now in a North American private col- lection (and on loan to the Cincinnati Art Museum), which is also said to have been found on los.'52 That figurine had surfaced by 1925 when it was displayed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. It is especially close to the Fitzwilliam piece in the detail of having the hands raised diagonally on the chest. A third figure with breasts like the Fitzwilliam figure and hands brought up to the chest is now in a private collection; it has no known provenance.'53 This last falls into a group of six figures, the so-called "Goulan- dris Hunter/Warrior Group"; the other five are in the Goulandris Collection in Athens.'54 Four are said to have been found in the same grave, but Getz-Preziosi has thought this unlikely as at least one "was probably carved several generations before his time."'55 Even the findspot has been disputed: Naxos, Spedos on Naxos, Phionta, and Keros have been mentioned.'56 Thus, the parallels do not provide secure archaeolog- 142 Eleni Vassilika, Keeper of Antiquities at the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, in discussion after a version of this paper was presented at a seminar. 143 For the use of the ultraviolet light, see D. von Bothmer, "The Head of an Archaic Greek Kouros," AA 1964, 615- 27. 144 Doumas (supra n. 2) 189. 145 S.

This inescapable doubt over an item that has indeed been in an "old European collection" for nearly 60 years shows how an attractive route to authenticity, privileging items known from before the market in Cycladic art prospered, in fact offers no security. 157 Fear arises especially for those classes of figures of which not one example comes from a secure context. For these, inescapably, there is a substantial chance that the whole class is bogus. Most Cycladic figures, if gendered, appear female. Male figures (table 7) are less common, but Getz- Preziosi calls the male warriors "a firmly established," 157 See K. Butcher and D.W.J. Gill, "The Director, the Dealer, the Goddess, and Her Champions: The Acquisition of the Fitzwilliam Goddess," AJA 97 (1993) 383-401, for a salutary tale of a beautiful prehistoric Aegean figure, which "surfaced" on the market about 1925, and which appears to be fake.</page><page sequence="19">1993] CONSEQUENCES OF ESTEEM FOR CYCLADIC FIGURES 619 if rare, "type."'58 Rare, yes-but how firmly estab- lished? The recognized male classes are standing male fig- ures, warriors, and musicians. All 13 standing male figures, of five types, are of unknown findspot or, at best, "said to be." The warrior figures are "said to be"; their early recording will encourage some to believe the class is genuine. The "musical figures" of harpists have also been a matter of controversy. Eight are known in good preservation.159 The pair in Karlsruhe are "reliably reported"'60 to have come from Thera; they are recorded as early as 1838. The example now in the National Archaeological Museum at Athens, said to come from a tomb on Keros where it was found with a flute-player, was first reported in 1884.161 One in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York was acquired in 1947. Renfrew has had "grave doubts" about its authenticity, although others have felt that it is genuine.162 The pair in the Shelby White and Leon Levy Collection are said to come from Amorgos.163 One now in a North American private collection surfaced on the London antiquities market in 1971,164 and the J. Paul Getty Museum acquired one in 1985 from a "private collection"; the Getty figure is also said to have been found on Amor- gos.165 A fragmentary example has also been found in the Aphendika cemetery on Naxos;166 Getz-Preziosi notes that this is the only Cycladic harpist "found in a controlled excavation."''67 Despite the sketchy archaeological contexts, Getz- Preziosi declares the authenticity of these nine to be "assured," and proposes that these harpists were "pro- duced over a period of perhaps two hundred and fifty years by unusually confident sculptors."'68 This un- usually confident estimate may create its own puzzle: how did the type come to be known to later sculptors when the earlier examples had been deposited in graves?169 We are glad there is (slight) evidence of a harpist in an archaeological deposit. The examples of Piltdown, Iolo Marganwg, and Ossian should remind us that forgery has many motives beyond those of the cash market.170 An Early Cycladic Arcadia of simple and happy fishers who played harps and pan-pipes is uncomfortably congruent with Romantic conventions fashionable in the mid-19th century-when the first of the Cycladic musicians surfaces. We therefore dis- agree with Renfrew, who thinks that documentation of special and seated figures in 1838 and 1884 amounts to certainty they are genuine.'171 In 1897 Bosanquet had already noted peasants in the pay of dealers;172 the market-makers were there first! A particular fear surrounds the larger, grander figures (table 8), so distinctive, sought after, and ex- pensive, for whom the cash stakes are so much higher. Not one of those comes from a secure archaeological context, and it is disconcerting that this class of figures waited until the market boomed before surfacing. Are they looted? Are they faked? Some? All? Consider the best course of action for a forger, or his representa- tive, who wishes to be well rewarded for his work. A routine piece, for example, a small folded-arm figure, will not stand out, but it will not command a special price. A figure of unique form or uniquely large size risks discovery through the interest it will raise; its special price may not cover the special risk. The best course may be to push "at the edge of the envelope," to make a figure that is special enough to push up the market price, but not so special to be scrutinized with 158 Getz-Preziosi 1980, 25.

And once a few extra-large figures, or extra-delightful musicians, have been taken into the corpus of accepted figures, the way is open for more of these special forgeries to be welcomed by precedent. If the large figures are all genuine, the chance of a large figure being recovered from an archaeological context remains. Until then, the large figures are a puzzle. The small figures, found in graves and at settlement sites,"73 are regarded as grave goods that previously had a function during life, perhaps in some household cult, suffering breakage and repair. 74 The big statues, up to 140 cm'75 or 148 cm'76 tall, are suggested by Renfrew'77 to have been used in some more public cult, perhaps in a separate shrine. With- out evidence of context, the idea is obliged to be a "pure hypothesis."'78 Renfrew has observed that ears, otherwise not pro- vided on Cycladic heads, exist on some of these un- usual large figures. One's confidence in the observa- tion as a truth of prehistory is-again-necessarily at the same level as one's confidence in the authenticity of the figures.179 The history of faking suspected for Cycladica dis- concertingly resembles the known story of the Neo- lithic figures from Hacilar in southwest Turkey, which followed the course of discovery, publication (which brought its delights to the attention of collectors), 173 Davis (supra n. 123) 15-23. 174 P.

Many museums were deceived, including the British Museum and the Ashmolean before thermo- luminescence tests resolved the Hacilar collections into ancient and modern; 48 out of 66 Hacilar pots tested at the Oxford Research Laboratory were mod- ern.'18 The Cycladic story has been obliged to take a different turn, as no comparable technique exists to detect faked marble carvings. Drifting Provenances Comparison of information about pieces exhibited more than once shows that Cycladic provenances are subject to "drifting," as stated findspots change with time. Documentation, new information, or reason for the drift is not given. These transformations are illus- trated by the Karlsruhe (1976) and Richmond (1987) exhibitions (table 9). The Karlsruhe exhibition dis- played some 20 or so fragments that were reported to come from the looted deposit on Keros.'18 The Richmond exhibition catalogue, which highlights the looting of Cycladic sites in its foreword,'82 chooses to play down this provenance. Sixteen pieces in Rich- mond are "reputedly from Keros,"'83 an unforthcom- ing remark as to where they came from on Keros, and when they were found. Yet the bibliography of one, no. 73, plainly shows that it was in this looted deposit, and two (Richmond nos. 75 and 82; Karls- ruhe nos. 178 and 173) had been published in the Karlsruhe catalogue as "from Keros-part of a large deposit," the orthodox euphemism for the Keros hoard. Indeed, another fragment of the hoard had trickled out between the exhibitions; Richmond no. 75 (originally in the Erlenmeyer Collection), was headless in Karlsruhe, but had its head back in place in Richmond. A head in the University of Missouri- Columbia Museum of Art and Archaeology was of "provenance unknown" in Karlsruhe (no. 177); in Virginia (no. 81), it was "reputedly found on Keros." A provenance also surfaced for an abstract figure in a private collection: Karlsruhe no. 41 was listed with unknown provenance (ownership stated as Houston, D., and J. de Menil Collection CA6253); in Richmond it was no. 8, "reputedly found on Naxos" (private collection, acquired in 1962). A marble spool pyxis in the same collection also gained a Naxian provenance between Karlsruhe and Virginia: Karlsruhe no. 343 (Houston, D., and J. de Menil Collection CA5207) became ECANAC no. 134 (private collection, acquired in 1952). Drifting findspot also affects a remarkable group of marble figures, regarded as Neolithic in date, which first appeared in Karlsruhe. When the pieces-a sit- ting female figure, two squatting female figures with children on their backs, and an animal and a bowl- were loaned to the Karlsruhe exhibition, nos. 4, 24, 25, and 429, they were unpublished and in the pos- session of "Switzerland, private collection I"; they were said to be "from Attica-part of a grave group," the knowledge that they were found together coming from "a credible source."'84 The group itself received a full discussion, was "subjected to x-ray analysis," and "the encrustation of all five pieces was pronounced to be typical of that found on genuine marble objects."'85 180 S.

GILL AND CHRISTOPHER CHIPPINDALE [AJA 97 No specific findspot for the group was mentioned other than "Attica." When one of the figures appeared in Richmond, no. 2, by then in the collection of Shelby White and Leon Levy, it was stated that the group was "reputedly found on an islet near Porto Raphti, At- tica."'86 In 1990 the group was exhibited again, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the history had changed once more. The group was "said to be from Euboea, or the east coast of Attica opposite, near Porto Raphti, perhaps from an islet attached to the main- land in prehistoric times."'"' Normally, the findspots of prehistoric artifacts (as distinct from their supposed places of manufacture) only move when clear information becomes properly available to revise the known history, or when decisive analytical evidence contradicts the supposed story. Not so with Cycladic figures. Of the Karlsruhe group, Getz-Preziosi states: "While a Euboean or an Attic provenance is quite possible for this marble group, these are not the only places with rusty-that is, iron- rich-soil."'88 Indeed these are not. Most of Morocco has rusty, iron-rich soil. Without real information Cycladic students must listen to whatever "said to be" is said to them, while the reasons that govern the "said to be" are unknown; their scholarship is thereby re- duced to clutching at rusty straws. And the politics of display have a clear role. If it is tactless to remind curators, owners, and the public that items originate in the Keros hoard, a deposit that is commonly known to have been stolen and smuggled, then let the prove- nance be reticent; "reputedly from Keros" will do nicely. One may see a pattern in attributions over time that amounts to a kind of fashion; in Bent's day figures were "said to be" from Antiparos, now they are "said to be" from Keros. Reemergence of Forgotten Collections: A Convenient Fiction When travelers like Theodore Bent brought back Cycladic figurines, interest in them was limited-even if that limited interest did extend to their notice by discerning collectors. Two in the Ashmolean once belonged to the Rev. GrevilleJ. Chester, an important 19th-century academic collector. Many of the donors to British museums acquired the figures with the intention of conveying them into a museum. Notice the museums where Cycladic figures are first found- the British Museum, the Ashmolean, and so on: the figures were never curios in the provinces. In the new century they had an artistic importance to the great sculptors. Yet it was only in the period after the Sec- ond World War that Cycladic figures came into artistic fashion as "collectibles" of importance. Nevertheless, one is given to understand that figures in North American collections came from European collections of the previous generation; as Getz-Preziosi plainly says of the general pattern, in the remarks quoted above: "Many of them have come to the United States from European collections."'89 The Erlenmeyers' in- deed was a European collection, formed "between the late 1940s and the early 1960s,"190 but Getz-Preziosi indicates that a very large part of it came from the illicit excavations on Keros; and if part comes from illicit excavations then which part of their collection is safe to acquire? Greek laws to protect antiquities go back well into the 19th century;191 a collection begun in the 1940s may be "old" in the perception of a contemporary collector, but it is not old enough to predate the Greek legal process. Perhaps the odd Cycladic figure, picked up on a grand tour that went beyond the more obvious sites of Classical Greece, did find its way to some forgotten attic, where it can one day be "discovered" and re- emerge on the art market. At least three Cycladic figures are in fact documented to have "sunk" from view during the 19th century, two folded-arm figu- rines from Naxos, whose whereabouts were unknown as early as 1888,192 and the Caria harpist. But it is hard to believe that many hundred Cycladic figures took this route-and all in such an obscurity that none of them were celebrated, or even recorded, in the catalogues and the sale catalogues of the "old Euro- pean collections" before they moved into newer hands. 193 The place of the "old European collection" as a source for Cycladic figures follows that of the wider antiquities market. Consider the patterns. Everyone involved with, and knowledgeable of, the business is 186 ECANAC no. 2. 187 Getz-Preziosi, in Glories 115, no. 8. The catalogue also supplies the information that the pieces were originally in the Charles Gillet and Marion Schuster Collection. 188 Getz-Preziosi, in Glories 13. 189 ECANAC 84. 190 Antiquities from the Erlenmeyer Collection, Sotheby's, 9 July 1990, p. 60, a specific reference to the Cycladic collec- tion. 191 The principle of state control over antiquities was es- tablished under the Kapodistrian government in the 1820s, following earlier precedent in the Turkish era. 192 P. LeBas and S. Reinach, Voyage archeologique en Grkce et en Asie Mineure (Paris 1888) 111, pl. 123, II-III. 193 A more recent manner of sinking is modern theft of figures from collections. A figure, said to be from Naxos and attributed to the "Steiner Master," was stolen from the Naxos Museum in 1977: SC 158.</page><page sequence="23">1993] CONSEQUENCES OF ESTEEM FOR CYCLADIC FIGURES 623 aware that a great many objects are looted and smug- gled; they are to some degree "hot." A small number of these are stolen from museums or other places where they are published or publicly known; in that way, the Kanakaria Byzantine mosaics from Cyprus'94 and the Roman Medusa mosaic from the Sparta Mu- seum were in recent years identified, and safely re- claimed by their proper owners.195 But these are unusual; most antiquities that are for sale have never been published, accessioned into a museum, or come to public scholarly attention. Who can report a Cy- cladic figure as stolen when it has been lying unseen in a grave for more than 4,000 years? And which agency is to investigate its movements between the ground and its display in a Swiss or a North American private collection or the London salesroom, when neither Swiss nor American nor British legal practice takes note of the unlawful acts under Greek law that its recovery and export involve? Some figures are fake. Because marble figures are not amenable to an analytical determination of age, there are no statistics for how many marble items have been tested or found wanting, as there might be for ceramics.'96 The Ox- ford University Research Laboratory for Art and Ar- chaeology, which authenticates ceramic objects by thermoluminescence, has reported 40% of the ce- ramic works submitted to it are not ancient.197 And what proportion are smuggled? Geraldine Norman, who has many years' experience in reporting the Lon- don art market for The Times and the Independent, says that "eighty per cent of all antiquities that come on the market have been illegally excavated and smug- gled."'98 In October 1990, the science journal Nature pub- lished a color illustration of a feather tabard of likely date between 200 B.C. and A.D. 800, on sale at a London dealer.'99 It comes from the Nazca culture of desert Peru, an area notorious for looting and smug- gling. When one of us inquired, the dealer said the items were indeed of good provenance; they came from a "collection." How often does one hear those phrases-"from a collection," "from an old collec- tion," "from an old European collection." But just which collection? Where are all those old collections? Why were the treasures they contained never known to the other old connoisseurs? Ricardo J. Elia, of Boston University, recently remarked that "the deal- er's usual explanation about coming from an 'old European family collection' has become a trite cyni- cism since it was exposed more than 15 years ago by Karl Meyer.'"200 The phrase has now so lost meaning that it has begun to fade from sales of many Classical antiquities. The most celebrated antiquities sale of the year 1990, dispersing the Hunt brothers' vases and bronzes, included 53 lots; just one of these, in the Brummer Collection (Zurich) by 1922, was docu- mented as from an old European collection; of the rest, two had surfaced in the 1960s, and the other 50 yet more recently.201 There was no mention of any "old European collections"; the sources of the other 52 were not revealed. Will the idea persist for Cycladic antiquities, although even less credibly since connois- seurs' esteem for them is so recent? Wish Fulfillment In addition to complete figures, the Cycladic corpus includes a great many fragments that are recognizably portions of incomplete or broken figures. Even some complete figures are of simple form: the "violin" var- iant of Cycladic figure has no distinct head, an elon- gated neck, broad shoulders, narrow waist, broad hips, and a rounded legless base, so it can only be recognized with reliability as depicting the human body because it fits the larger Cycladic pattern of 194 The Kanakaria mosaics, published in A.H.S.

But simplicity and abstraction, at an extreme, make a sculpted figure indistinguishable from a stone that was worn or shaped by human hand for reasons other than rep- resentation, or even from a pebble worn and shaped by natural causes alone. Without a documented ar- chaeological findspot and context, it is not always clear that the form alone reliably identifies the object as a figure fragment or other Cycladic antiquity. Now taken into the Cycladic corpus, therefore, are shaped pieces of stone that may not be sculptures, but objects that modern possessors, whether purchasers or vendors, wish to treat as sculptures.204 That is what they then become. "Sinking" Figures not only surface without earlier history, but also can disappear without subsequent history. The theft from the Paros Museum in 1992, for example, targeted 18 "collectible" Cycladic works of art. Whether for the market or by commission for an individual customer, these are figures known to be stolen and therefore impossible to refer to or resell openly; they are said to have gone to a private collec- tor in the Far East.205 They are "sinkers" from the corpus. So are figures sold at auctions or privately, in cases where the new owners do not choose to make available their identity. MATERIAL CONSEQUENCES Impact on the Archaeological Context of Cycladic Figures The small number of figures recovered from secure archaeological contexts in itself raises questions about the damage inflicted upon the archaeological record by illicit excavation. If we take Getz-Preziosi's upper estimate of 1,600 for Cycladic figurines of all types,206 then we can gain some idea of the number of graves that have probably been looted to service the demand by museums and collectors. Since figures are present in only a proportion of the graves, each figure may represent a certain number of looted graves, and some estimate of that number can be made from those archaeologically excavated cemeteries that record the ratio between numbers of graves and numbers of figures (table 10). The numbers in table 10 need to be reduced by whatever proportion of the figures are fake. The arithmetic is further upset if the number of figures contributed by the Keros site is other than has been thought: Broodbank guesses that a third of the 1,200 known folded-arm figures derive from Keros, with the other two-thirds representing equally grave goods and fakes.207 Doumas thinks fakes were so widely diffused that a decline in illegal diggings came about.208 Not all of these 1,600 figures came from graves. One can attempt some arithmetic for the conse- quences. If we remove those from the Keros deposit, perhaps some 350;209 from excavations on Keros, approximately 50;210 from Ayia Irini on Keos, some 43;211 and from Phylakopi on Melos, recorded as 11 by the excavators,212 then some 450 are not from graves. The remaining 1,150 figures of the corpus known in 1987 were probably taken from graves. Of these, only some 143 seem to have come from the controlled excavation of more than 1,400 graves. This works out as approximately one figure for every 10 202 Cemeteries where figures have been found. 203 Or about 1,600 if one includes cemeteries without fig- ures on Naxos. 204 For the converse, archaeological objects of the simplest forms that are lost from the corpus, see below, p. 626. 205 FLOM: said to the program makers by we know not whom with we know not what motive or source of informa- tion. 206 SC 130: "roughly twelve hundred extant Cycladic folded-arm figures . . or substantial fragments of such figures," and p. 141: "approximately 1,500 or 1,600 Cycladic figures of all types are known." 207 Personal communication. 208 Doumas (supra n. 13) 29. 209 Getz-Preziosi 1983, 37.

Thus, some 85% of the funerary record of the Early Bronze Age Cyclades may have been lost through this unscientific search for figurines. And, of course, for that large portion of the graves with figures that were emptied by loot- ers, we have only the figures, or other saleable arti- facts, without knowledge of their association or context. One of the best-explored islands of the Cyclades is Naxos.214 Some 577 Early Cycladic tombs from 10 cemeteries have yielded some 75 figures, a ratio of about one figure per eight graves.215 Not all cemeter- ies on Naxos yielded figures, however, in part because they had been already looted.216 Thus, for every eight or nine Early Cycladic graves opened, a single marble figure has been redeemed. A very similar ratio may be obtained for the island of Amorgos.217 The island of Antiparos was the location for some of the earliest excavations by Bent;218 if we take this island with the neighboring ones of Paros and Despotiko, some 280 graves have yielded approximately 58 figures, about one figure per five graves.219 A greater imbalance between numbers of graves and figures was found at Chalandriani on Syros where only six figures were recovered from more than 600 graves, one figure per 100 graves. These figures suggest that for the islands of Naxos, Amorgos, Paros, Antiparos, and Despotiko, each figure represents approximately seven graves opened; on adding Syros to the numbers, each Cy- cladic figure with a secure provenance is found to represent some 10 excavated graves. The estimate of 12,000 for the number of looted graves has a large uncertainty; even a lower, and less insecure, estimate of 10,000 graves, however, has large implications for Cycladic archaeology. This number would be the equivalent of 16 cemeteries of the size of that excavated at Chalandriani. This cem- etery, however, was exceptional in its size; it is one of only three that contained 100 or more graves.220 Even if one large cemetery of, say, 100 graves has been rifled, the remaining tombs may represent 500 to 660 small cemeteries of 15 to 20 graves each-a more usual figure. Destruction on this scale would be sure to distort the picture of settlement in the islands. This arithmetic shows that one cannot accept Getz-Prezio- si's comments in the epilogue of her Sculptors of the Cyclades: "Surely the Cyclades have many secrets still to be revealed."221 Rather, every sign points to the obvious cemeteries in the Cyclades-which are small islands with much barren rock and shallow soil cover-now having been in large measure quarried out.222 Most of these figures are of the folded-arm type and thus belong to the EC II horizon (some 300 years), a phase with one of the more intense levels of occupation.223 Melos, for example, is thought to have had a population of only some 400 at this time, and estimates for the whole Cyclades during EC II range from 6,600 to 34,400.224 These figures presume an even distribution of fig- ures throughout the Cyclades. It seems that for the EC I horizon, however, most figures have been found on Naxos and Paros, and for the EC II horizon, on Naxos and Keros. Some islands that lacked marble sources, such as Thera and Melos,225 rarely seem to yield figures in funerary contexts. If this is the case, then the 10,000 graves of our estimate must be located on even fewer islands. Getz-Preziosi notes that "the distribution of marble objects within the Cyclades has been badly blurred by extensive illicit digging and the corresponding paucity of documented finds."226 Some pattern may survive in the blurring: the illegal digging is in pursuit of antiquities, and must generally follow the looters' experienced knowledge of where the goods are to be found. Another effect can arise from accidents of geography, and the modern trading ports. At one time Keros belonged to the Panagia Hozoviotissa monastery on Amorgos; in addition, 213 As some graves were found to contain several figures, however, this ratio is a minimum. 2'4 V.

GILL AND CHRISTOPHER CHIPPINDALE [AJA 97 Keros is far nearer to the main town on Amorgos than it is to the capital of Naxos, way up the west coast. Amorgos forms a natural outlet during the early stages of discovery and dispersion. These known, or perceived, patterns do not always fit the information offered for individual figures, and the literature therefore sometimes provides an alter- native to a "said to be," when the "said to be" is thought unconvincing. A headless and legless marble figure formerly in the Erlenmeyer Collection was once said to have been found on Amorgos227 but the sale cata- logue comments that "it is quite possible that it was actually recovered on Keros."228 Context is important for the most schematic figures. Take, for example, the three pieces of marble sold at the Erlenmeyer sale, December 1990, as its lots 134- 36.229 Published by the Erlenmeyers in 1965,230 they had been "authenticated" by appearing in the Karls- ruhe exhibition of 1976, where they were described as "abstract-schematic idols."231 One is a conical piece of marble 9 cm high, identified in the 1990 auction catalogue as a pestle, although the description is more cautious.232 The second, a subrectangular block, also 9 cm high, is identified as a baitylos (sacred stone);233 the description is again more cautious.234 The third, a subtrapezoidal pebble 8 cm high, which to our eyes has very little in common with Cycladic representa- tions of the human body, is called a "highly schema- tised marble figure"; the description, again more cautious, only claims that the "small object of simple form and strong tactile appeal resembles the torso of a normal Cycladic folded-arm figure."235 The object does to a certain degree resemble that shape, but so does many a pebble that lies along any of the shingle beaches of the world, radiating the strongest tactile appeal to the eye of the passing connoisseur. It is well known that marble pebbles were placed in Early Cy- cladic graves,236 but they can only be identified as artifacts of human interest by a secure knowledge of that context. When that context is lost, they lose their standing and are, once more, beach pebbles. The Erlenmeyer "abstract-schematic idols" are not known for certain to come from a grave, because their history is unknown. Without history, they become beach peb- bles once more.237 The same is true of the "knob (?)" in the George Ortiz Collection in Geneva,238 an object of no known provenance whose declared history con- stitutes no proof that it is a genuine Cycladic antiquity. Yet it is seen as art: "The form of the object is perfect, the workmanship of superior quality. It is at present unique. What its purpose was is not known."239 These objects by their lack of history are reduced to mean- ingless curiosities, "things sold under the belief they are works of art." A possible corollary to these revered objects without history is found in those objects scorned because they lack sufficiently distinctive form. What is a looter to do with beach pebbles or "abstract-schematic" figures found in a grave that do not by their form sufficiently announce themselves as Cycladic antiquities? As the form is not diagnostic, and as the history-the only true proof for items of these undiagnostic forms-is untellable, we fear objects of these kinds are left in the grave or otherwise discarded by those without the authority to declare them to be of a perfect form. Finally, one may notice the effect of a changing climate for the open sale of classes of antiquities, like Cycladic, where there is some fear that items may be of unreliable history, whether through faking or through illicit export.

If silence is in order for some items, then reticence may be a prudent habit in general. Certainly, one can notice that published sales catalogues of recent years seem to be less forthcoming about the history of items than was once customary. Table 11 summarizes the accounts offered for the 40 items in the selling exhibition at Galerie Heidi Vollmoeller, Zurich, 1989. No account is offered for 34 of the objects. A history of the other six is offered as far back as the Karlsruhe exhibition of 1976; two of these were already in the gallery's ownership at that time; the history of none goes beyond Karlsruhe. Consequences for Chronology Insecure provenances are also common outside the area of Cycladic art. Some basic tenets of later chro- nology are, like Cycladic, dependent on "said to be" and the vagaries of mobile collections. For example, the key pieces for the study of early Greek pottery from the Black Sea are an MG II hydriske purchased from a dealer in 1909 and "said to be" from Berezan (yet no examples of such pottery have been found in excavated contexts), and LG kotyle and kantharos fragments in the Museum of Classical Archaeology, Cambridge, perhaps from Istria but possibly slipped into the wrong drawer from the Al Mina finds.240 As the context for so many Cycladic figures is lost, the framework depends on the 10% of the corpus that has been found in secure archaeological contexts. A figure without context can only be dated by refer- ence to other figures that have a secure provenance. With the present evidence a schema has been created to trace a progression from the Abstract through the Hybrid and the Precanonical to the Canonical and then on to the Postcanonical of the Chalandriani type.241 However attractive this theoretical outline might be as an abstract of an artistic cycle, it is nec- essarily remote from the evidence that ought to be available. Are Precanonical figures consistently found in early contexts? Are Postcanonical consistently in late? Are different types contemporary, or do they follow in a distinct succession? If they overlap, do the contemporary types fit with the scheme of things? The other 90% of the corpus might have answered these questions but their evidence has been lost for- ever. Barber comments: "Our understanding, both of the chronology of types and of the ways in which these objects were used, is slight by comparison with the total number of finds, though just enough figu- 240 J. Boardman, "Early Greek Pottery on Black Sea Sites?" OJA 10 (1991) 387-90. 241 Such a scheme, set out in much detail, may be found in ACC 48, fig. 21.</page><page sequence="28">628 DAVID W.J. GILL AND CHRISTOPHER CHIPPINDALE [AJA 97 rines have been found in systematic excavations to provide a key."242 We think Barber's view of the weight of evidence is too generous; we are not con- vinced that "just enough figurines have been found in systematic excavations" to carry the schema that has been built upon it. Within the Keros-Syros phase, Broodbank notices, the case for an increasing "ab- straction" for folded-arm figures depends on a rela- tive chronology for the figure types that derives entirely from a priori evolutionary assumptions, and is supported by neither stratigraphy nor seriation; this proposition seems to relate to no empirical infor- mation at all.243 We fear that ideas about Cycladic chronology have now come to depend too much on preconceptions about the range of types and variants that ought to be in production at any one time, and about the stages through which those types and variants ought to pro- gress in a highly disciplined aesthetic order. The fig- ures that do not fit are set aside as late, decadent, or aberrant, in order not to challenge the studied truth of the aesthetic. Those elegant schemas sort and order the figures into a chronological pattern, a pattern that can then be depended on as confirming the historical truth of the schemas.244 "Workshops" and Regional Variation A further problem is created by the attempt to isolate the areas where different "sculptors" were op- erating by comparing findspots. From her eight "clas- sical sculptors" and five "late classical sculptors," Getz- Preziosi produced a pattern of distribution of the works.245 Seven different islands are represented: Paros, Naxos, Keros, Amorgos, Keos, los, and Crete. Of these, Paros, Amorgos, and los have no secure findspots, and Naxos and Keros dominate those with secure ones. This lack of secure provenances and archaeological contexts deprives scholarship from the opportunity to discover if the "Masters" are masters or whether in fact the groups represent regional styles, a point made by von Bothmer.246 An equivalent point may be made by way of distribution over time: if there were good evidence of context and therefore Table 12.

Size and Function of the Figures One question about the use of the figures has fo- cused on whether or not the large examples were used in effect as cult statues whereas the smaller ones were usually confined to graves. The range of size for the works attributed to Getz-Preziosi's 16 "sculptors" is a guide (table 12).247 More than half of the EC II figures are less than 40 cm high, and more than 80% less than 60 cm. Of the tall figures-those supposed to be cult statues- not one has a secure provenance, although one is said to come from Amorgos.248 Getz-Preziosi comments, in respect to their size, that "the purchaser of a piece probably neither commissioned it to conform to a precise measurement nor would he have paid for it 'by the centimeter', a method of pricing rumored to have been in use among grave robbers in recent years."249 By the time the figures reached New York in the 1960s, the price per centimeter was around $1,000.250 Again, it proves hard to find certain knowl- edge in a mass of uncertain reports. 242 Barber 121. 243 Broodbank 544-45. 244 This may be an especial danger for the scholar who favors the Modernist aesthetic: see below, p. 658. Renfrew, studying the Indo-European question, has noticed a recip- rocal dependence between the archaeological and the lin- guistic opinions, in which each builds a view in the light of the other's beliefs, depending more on a mutual deference than empirical data.

A first and immediate consequence of the circum- stances under which some 90% of known Cycladic figures have been removed from the ground and moved around the world is a total loss of reliable information about their archaeological context. For those examples whose archaeological context was a tomb, the loss is quantitative rather than qualitative. There remain a variety of possible non-funerary con- texts for figures that have not been available to ar- chaeological study: which classes of figures, if any, come from sanctuaries or other types of sacred places? And what kind of deposit is the Keros hoard-an immense tomb- or cemetery-group? A sanctuary de- posit? Or something else again? Conversely, there are some types of figures unknown or barely known from archaeological contexts, such as the harpists; we there- fore do not know if that class of figures comes from tombs like the others, or whether there is a different pattern of context, to go with the different form, and reflecting a different prehistoric purpose and mean- ing. The corpus of figures is vastly enlarged by the recent surfacings, but the information about context has scarcely changed. And for every tomb that was destroyed and yielded a figure, perhaps 10 others were destroyed without even producing that. Many figures have surfaced with a declared prove- nance, the island of Naxos, say, but without support- ing evidence-understandably, if to document their history is to admit to improper acts. These corrupt the record, for it is in the interests of the seller to give information that the buyer will be happy to hear, and which offers no clue by which the buyer-or any agent of the Antiquities Service-can trace back the figure's movements from the earth. Forgeries corrupt the record whenever they are declared as having a prove- nance. The Keros hoard offers particular opportu- nities for the forger, as it is a shadowy collection, understood to be very large and diverse, never fully or securely documented. The hoard provides a con- venient alibi under which a forgery, whether ortho- dox or novel in its form, can be offered as both plausible and impossible of being authenticated. Given the chain of intermediaries through which a figure may pass between the hole in the Cycladic ground and the connoisseur's cabinet-none of whom have necessary good cause faithfully to pass on what they hear-one can have no confidence that any knowledge of provenance that the figure may chance to carry at the start of the chain will in fact arrive unchanged at the end. The phrase "said to be from .. ." that one sees in the catalogues means just that. One must ask, as a historian does of the words a document offers for study, Said to whom? By whom? When? With what purpose?251 Nevertheless, the connoisseur, concerned to be cer- tain that his252 purchase is what it is supposed to be, has good cause to wish to know that provenance to be correct, for the same reason that he wishes the object to be genuine. It is also in the interest of the dealer of integrity to offer reliable information.253 Unfor- tunately, the circumstances of sale, whether in an open market or privately, rarely offer any full reliability. The recent example of the Sevso treasure-a hoard of late Roman metalwork put on sale as coming from 251 On this problem see 0. White Muscarella, "'Ziwiye' and Ziwiye: The Forgery of a Provenience,"JFA 4 (1977) 197- 219. 252 Following contemporary norms, we do not generally use in this paper pronouns or phrases that presume male or female gender. The use of "his" here to refer to the con- noisseur is a reminder that collectors are, in the majority, men, and that the atmosphere of collecting is a masculine one, which echoes the idiom of the hunt, as the patient collector stalks his prey with cunning patience until he can leap to grasp and take it. See, e.g., this metaphor in T. Hoving's account of collecting art at the Metropolitan Mu- seum of Art in New York, entitled The Chase, the Capture: Collecting at the Metropolitan (New York 1975). In the alternative metaphor, the desired object-so beau- tiful, so alluring, so passive-seduces the collector who is driven by passion to reach for his beloved, whatever the cost. The metaphor is sexual desire, and the collector is again cast in the masculine role. 253 See O. White Muscarella, "Unexcavated Objects and Ancient Near Eastern Art," in G. Buccellati, Mountains and Lowlands: Essays in the Archaeology of Greater Mesopotamia (BibM 7, Malibu 1977) 160: "Many times one encounters the use of terms such as 'honest dealer', 'dishonest dealer', or a statement that an object was bought 'in good faith' from 'a reputable dealer'. However, most of the public and very few scholars know what these terms actually signify when em- ployed by museum curators or directors: an 'honest' or 'reputable' dealer is no more or less than one the purchaser believes will never intentionally sell a forgery, a 'dishonest' dealer is one who will knowingly sell forgeries. But most dealers are not experts in ancient art-although they usually claim such expertise-and they will often sell forgeries, albeit sometimes unintentionally. 'In good faith' seems to mean only that both purchaser and vendor mutually agree on a price, agree that the objects are genuine, and confirm that the object has successfully passed through the local customs. It must be understood that the use of the honorific adjectives mentioned with regard to dealers does not speak to the methods used by the latter to acquire their material, methods that more often than not involve not only the destruction of archaeological monuments, but smuggling and bribery to remove the object from its country of origin."</page><page sequence="30">630 DAVID W.J.

Lebanon and with a Lebanese export certificate, but claimed also by the Yugoslavian government to be from its territory, and "reliably rumored" ("said to be") also to come from Hungary258-is but one ex- ample that shows why declared provenance is a matter subject to many influences beyond the actual place where an object first surfaced. The same corruptions of reliable knowledge, aris- ing from the existence of uncertain and false objects with uncertain and false contexts and provenances, afflict all classes of antiquities. Take an example that could be repeated from any one of many recent sale catalogues: "Two Danish flint axes, Neolithic period, circa 2500-2000 B.C., one from Store Jyndevad .... Another, circa 2500-2000 B.C., from Alslev v. Hjord- kaer."259 Perhaps, even probably, these axes are what they say they are: a reliable history may be available from the previous owner; some Danish axes are thought distinctive in their shape and in the appear- ance of the flint, providing confirmation of the de- clared provenance; there is little risk that an agency fearing illegal or unethical elements to the history will take a suspicious interest. No obloquy will go with their sale, no visits will be made from the Danish Embassy to the auction house, no injunctions will be sought from the High Court. A great many polished axes from the European Neolithic were privately col- lected in the last century, so there are indeed many "old European collections" in which the axes can be found in quantity, and polished axes are common stray finds across northern Europe to this day. Yet our corpus of finds with documented and reliable contexts and provenances for the Danish Neolithic may seem sufficiently large, and our knowledge of the Danish Neolithic may appear sufficiently broad- based, that it might be able to withstand the loss of knowledge that could once have gone with the quite large number of flint axes and other artifacts now in 254 National Museum. 255 Metropolitan Museum of Art. 256 Acropolis Museum for 2 items, Benaki Museum 2, Ecole franraise d'Athenes 1, National Museum 50, Chania Museum 3, Delos Museum 2, Delphi Museum 2, Kos Mu- seum 3, Melos Archaeological Museum 1, Olympia Museum 8, Paros Museum 1, Rhodes Museum 2, Samos (Vathy) Mu- seum 15, Thasos Museum 4, Thera Museum 5. 257 Brooklyn Museum 1, Metropolitan Museum of Art 45. 258 Chippindale (supra n. 201) 704-707, esp. 705. 259 Sotheby's (London), 31 May 1990, lot 227.</page><page sequence="31">1993] CONSEQUENCES OF ESTEEM FOR CYCLADIC FIGURES 631 Table 14.

The same may appear true of some classes of Classical antiquities, despite so many centuries of collecting before archae- ological excavation in the modern sense began: those that surface now are "just more of the same." It is certainly not true for the figures from the prehistoric Cyclades or for our understanding of Cycladic pre- history. Although esteem for Cycladic antiquities is a recent phenomenon, and with it looting on the larger scale, it has the appearance of affecting a greater proportion of the total corpus than is usual for Classical antiqui- ties.260 In the absence of any published statistics to show what proportion of the Classical antiquities in major museums and private collections are of a secure history, the point can only be illustrated on a small scale. The 1979/1980 loan exhibition "Greek Art of the Aegean Islands," the first ever sent by the Republic of Greece to the United States,26' brought together 193 items262 from the Cyclades, early and later, with material of Mycenaean, Geometric, Archaic, and Clas- sical periods from Crete, Rhodes, and other islands. The major collections lending were the National Ar- chaeological Museum of Athens, the Louvre, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Table 13 shows the provenance listed for the items divided first by its 10 sections, and then by the lending museums.263 Table 14 shows the provenance for some classes of Archaic sculpture. 260 Some categories have suffered worse than others. One could compare the plight of the Cycladic funerary record with that of Boeotia. It has been estimated that between 8,000 and 10,000 graves were looted in 1872 and 1873 around the city of Tanagra in Boeotia to supply the demands for the clay figures of Hellenistic draped women, known as "Tanagras" (R. Higgins, Tanagra and the Figurines [Prince- ton 1986] 30). Here again is a problem of authenticity with many figures being forged. Indeed it has been reported to us by Lucilla Burn of the British Museum that not a single known "Tanagra" comes from a recorded tomb group. 261 D. Dillon, "Preface," in Greek Art of the Aegean Islands (supra n. 6) 9. 262 Numbered 1-191 but including 172A-C, so making a total 193. 263 This was a general exhibition of varied objects, with figures and other items from the Cyclades, not of Cycladica alone. The classification of security of provenance is that offered in its catalogue. The statistics are also affected by the particular choice of items for each section, which may have produced a different pattern than that based on a larger sample or one systematically put together in another way.</page><page sequence="32">632 DAVID W.J.

The pattern that is visible largely follows from the date of acquisition. The supply of legitimate antiqui- ties has dried up; as demand has continued, it has been supplied increasingly by illegitimate means. Pri- vate collectors of Greek antiquities in North America, as the newest class to pursue that demand, have nat- urally had to depend more on illegitimate sources. The proportion of unprovenanced or doubtfully provenanced items in some North American private collections of Greek painted vases is correspondingly as high as for the North American collections of Cy- cladic figures.264 Of the items from the Shelby White and Leon Levy Collection that were exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1990, 94% are of unknown provenance (table 15). When it comes to the European collections, which may be "older" in the generality of Greek antiquities, the recent promotion of Cycladic figures into the desired canon of collect- ibles shows itself again in the high proportion of unprovenanced or doubtfully provenanced figures. B.F. Cook, Keeper of Greek and Roman Antiquities at the British Museum, recently set out his view of the market in Classical antiquities: Given the known pillage of archaeological sites and the flood of unprovenanced antiquities on the market, there is clearly reasonable cause to believe that a consid- erable number, if not the majority, of these unprove- nanced objects have been clandestinely excavated and illegally smuggled out of their countries of origin. Un- der these circumstances all unprovenanced antiquities are tainted with suspicion (cf. Chippindale 1990: 704), and objects considered for acquisition should therefore come with some evidence that they have not recently come into the market through the hands of criminals abroad.265 The British Museum policy, therefore, is as follows: "Objects of foreign origin are only acquired if the laws of the country of origin allow it, a point cleared as a matter of routine in any report submitted to the Trustees on a purchase or gift."266 For this reason, Cook explains, "relatively few objects have been ac- quired by the British Museum's Department of Greek and Roman Antiquities in recent years."'267 The re- marks apply a fortiori to Cycladic figures, and here is the problem for any collection, private or public, less favored by chance and history in its assets than the British Museum. It seems to us that there is no supply, practically, of first-rate Cycladic figures that "come with some evidence that they have not recently come into the market through the hands of criminals abroad," despite Getz-Preziosi's observation that "many of the works that have come to the U.S. in recent years were previously in European collections formed after WW II (but before 1973)."268 If a mu- seum or a collector decides a Cycladic figure must be acquired, then choice has usually to be made among unprovenanced antiquities that are variously tainted with suspicion. The unacceptable alternative is no Cycladic figure at all. Ricardo Elia, reviewing Ren- frew's Cycladic Spirit, notices that the odium thrown over looters is not extended to the collectors.269 The one is "bad," the other "good." It is not clear to him or to us why. Art, Eternal Value, and the Idea of Redemption It seems to us a remarkable fact that the history of esteem for Cycladic figures, as we have documented it, has led to so many actions on, or beyond, the margins of legality. Esteem for so many other classes 264 W.G.

As elsewhere in this paper, we try to confine ourselves to observa- tion and restrained comment. Yet consider the re- spected place in Western society that the connoisseurs and the museums hold; these are indeed the pillars of society. The discrepancy is so striking between that standing-and the correctness of moral behavior that goes with it-and the reality that lies behind "no history" that one must look for motives by way of explanation that reach into the domain of the psycho- logical. What are those motives? A first element is the wish to acquire. Sir Robert Sainsbury says of his collecting: "I have, for over forty years, been a 'passionate ac- quirer'-a passionate acquirer of works of art that have appealed to me," and he goes on to quote a more explicit statement by Thomas Hoving of the Metro- politan Museum: "If something is truly grand it has a kinetic effect. Something akin to being physically impelled. It is, frankly, a charge, both cerebral and viscerotonic, not unlike a sexual experience."270 The Metropolitan Museum press release for the catalogue of the White and Levy Collection is headed with a quotation from its foreword: "True and Passionate Collectors." Going with this passion is the competitive framework within which collecting takes place. There are only so many Cycladic figures, or only so many great Cycladic figures, only eight-just eight harpists--and some of them are spoken for! Each that another has, I cannot have for myself.271 This is the old motive, "the chase, the capture,""272 that drives the spirit of acqui- sition by museum and by individual collector. Dietrich von Bothmer, Distinguished Research Curator of Greek and Roman Art at the Metropolitan Museum, remarks: "The creation of the great museums of the world-the Metropolitan Museum of Art is no excep- tion-and their continued existence and well-being owe much to a special breed of individual: the collec- tor. No matter where or when they plied their trade, these individuals are linked by a common thread- the ardent desire to own works of art."273 Alan Shes- tack, Director of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, says, in his important essay in The Ethics of Collecting Cultural Property: Museum professionals are acquirers; we are inher- ently greedy collectors. Most of us go into the profession because the desire to accumulate and bring together objects of quality is in our blood. We are personally and professionally devoted to adding to and improving our holdings. That is what makes us tick. And to consciously or intentionally turn down a highly desirable object we can afford to buy on the basis that we suspect that it might have been removed illegally from its country of origin-and also knowing that it will end up in the collection of a rival institution or an unscrupulous pri- vate collector is a very hard thing to do.274 Despite these pressures, museums are by degrees coming to follow a common policy that rules out the acquisition of newly surfaced antiquities.275 In the museum world, acquisitions have now become "sub- ject to the constraints of committees, to financial re- strictions, and to the relative academicism of many of their curatorial guardians."''2 In the private field, the spirit of chase and capture can still prevail. As the Metropolitan's Director puts it, "in the assembling of private collections every whim can be exercised at will, and the preferences of the collectors tirelessly pur- sued and indulged: the result is fresh and often sur- prising because it reflects the collectors' personal taste and a sense of risk and adventure."277 It is also per- tinent that the curator, at the British Museum at least, is obliged to guarantee the good history of a planned acquisition,"27 whereas the private collector has a wider freedom. Indeed, as museums become reluc- tant to be seen to acquire works of uncertain history, then the private collections-acquired outside the gaze of the public or of trustees, unsupervised by an apparatus of formal codes of conduct, and then trans- ferred to the museum--can instead be the means by which the great museums can satisfy their ardent desires. The pattern now begins to be discerned for Cycladic art that goes from the ground279 through intermediaries and across frontiers to a private collec- tion in a "safe" country in Europe or North America, and then by loan, gift, bequest, or purchase from private collection into a museum. Dividing the route into distinct stages in this way serves to distance the museum, as ultimate recipient, from those successive and "separate" transactions by which the stolen and smuggled object is made into a civic treasure. 270 R.

GILL AND CHRISTOPHER CHIPPINDALE [AJA 97 In the case of Cycladic art, there is a large possibility that the supply, by new manufacture or by surfacing or otherwise, could outstrip demand. A considerable time sometimes has been known to elapse between some objects becoming known and being available for sale; Cycladic figures and other antiquities, lent by Galerie Heidi Vollmoeller (Zurich) to Karlsruhe in 1976, were available at the gallery's stand at the Basel art fair in 1989.2s80 More of the Keros hoard trickled out subsequent to the release of what had seemed its entirety. Cycladic market-makers are clearly aware of the danger, and adjust the supply accordingly. If the cemeteries are in large measure quarried out, as sug- gested above, one means of supply has naturally dwin- dled. Another aspect may be that antiquities, like other works of art, are one means by which mere money, even if vulgarly acquired, can become a fine propri- etorship; the celebrated way in England for the rising new rich to meld into the old rich is to buy or to build a country estate, and thereby to join the aristocratic ranks of the landed gentry. A connoisseur's regard for fine old things makes the same statement. There is nothing necessarily special about Cycladica here; they are just another class of possessions to esteem. Yet some collectibles are grander than others; enthu- siasts for philately have to live with the derogatory phrase "stamp-collecting"; there is no equivalent dis- missal of "Cycladic collecting" or "Old Master collect- ing." We think we can perceive, in the rising tide of regard, a place for Cycladic not as just one more ancient class of art to go alongside Cypriot pottery, South Italian red-figure vases, or little Etruscan bronzes, but as an art whose special and higher status is demonstrated by its sharing its remarkable aesthetic with the modern masters. It takes a special connois- seur properly to appreciate the refined quality of Cycladic sculpture, so cool and understated by the side of the more florid Classical forms. For this reason, we expect Cycladic art to continue to rise in esteem and, by degrees, for its market value to overhaul longer-established classes of "easier" Classical collect- ibles. Although archaeology and art history are newly awash with self-conscious theory, not much is written on the philosophy of contemporary connoisseurship. J.T. Spike, "an independent art historian specializing in Italian paintings," remarks while writing about a contemporary-art dealer's exhibition, which included Cycladic figures: "Questions of quality are not often addressed in writing as those responsible for much of what is written-art historians and archaeologists- regard works of art more as documents or facts than as objects of aesthetic appeal."281 Arguing that we can enjoy things without their context, Spike says of the "Cycladic idols": "To return to idols, we need not apologize nor feel discouraged by the realization that we will never understand these ancient terracottas and stones with anything like the meaning that they held for the worshipper who reverently gave them as of- ferings .... Great art is large in spirit: it is sufficient and little short of miraculous, come to think of it, that these works of art can seize the imagination of persons inhabiting any part of the world in 1990 A.D." All this is true and fair, in our opinion, provided it is clearly understood that the connoisseur's appreci- ation, in a place, time, and intellectual climate far removed from those of the object's maker, may inter- sect little or not at all with the meaning, function, or vision that the same artifact held in its own place, time, and society. But does thatjustify the connoisseur of this eternal value in seizing the treasure without respect for the rights of persons inhabiting other parts of their world in A.D. 1993? The conventional motives, like the two outlined above, do not seem so strong that they sufficiently explain the disregard of private collectors and of some museums for the actions to which, by their purchases, they become accomplices. Perhaps too little notice is taken of the power of a vision and a spirit of redemption in these matters. Consider. An ancient genius, gifted by providence with the skills to craft Cycladic figures of museum quality and graced with a society in which his genius was nourished and succored, contrived enduring masterpieces out of the base rock of a tiny, dry, poor island. The figures, "austere and stylized yet delicate and fully formed,"282 which in their own time may have been idols, gods, demons, or images of the dead, are eternal as Art. That is why, in the 1920s it was Moore and Modigliani, artists not schol- ars, who rediscovered the incomparable beauty of these works, why Pablo Picasso viewed a Cycladic sculpture he owned as finer than a Brancusi.283 In ancient times these masterpieces came to be lost to 280 J.

Buried, the figures may be lost forever. Yet for a fortunate few, there is the chance of redemption from that fall into earth, to be taken up once more out of the base clay of an Aegean island, to enjoy again an intimacy with a human mind and a human spirit that can reach out to its high and enduring art. What honor for a Cycladic figure could be greater than to be owned by Picasso or esteemed by Giacometti! This is the vocation of the modern connoisseur of Cycladic art, to recover that which is lost, to esteem it for its greatness, and by that spiritual communion to make the figure come to glory again, and so to let the spirit of the master who made it live once more: master shall speak to master across so many remote centuries in the language of masterpieces, the shared language that needs no common tongue! If the impulse behind the pursuit of Cycladica is of this nature, then several consequences follow. First, the essence is in the fact of redemption, the bringing again from the darkness of earth into the light. The circumstances of redemption are a lesser matter. It does not matter much whether a figure is retrieved by archaeological excavation, by chance discovery, or by archaiokapiloi; and there is nothing of special merit about an archaeological recovery over any other. Second, it is then of the essence that the figure newly redeemed from the earth be conveyed into the possession of a person who shares the grace fully to grasp its aesthetic nature, to respond to its eternal virtue. An archaiokapilos does not qualify, although he will suffice as the vehicle by which the figure is redeemed. An archaeologist may suffice-but not if, instead of bringing the figure to light, he then con- signs it instead into the modern darkness of some remote, closed storeroom. Nor will he qualify if he overlooks the spirit of the figure and insists on a narrow, materialist attitude in which this figure of grace is just a physical object, more unfelt data. Third, it is immaterial where the redeemer chances to reside. These values are of the eternal, and may equally be found in Fort Worth (Texas) or Ludwig- shafen-am-Rhein; they are as likely to inhabit Athens, Georgia, as Athens, Greece. After all, providence chose to endow the people on some dry, scruffy, barren Aegean islands with the ancient grace to create these spirits out of the pebbles on the beach. There is no special claim of descent or geography that privi- leges the claim of persons or authorities in the Cyc- lades, or elsewhere within the modern state of Greece, over those of other lands. Rather, the higher calling of the connoisseur, and the obligation to take the act of redemption to its completion, requires that the finest figures be taken before those rare eyes that can grasp their deeper meaning. It is in this way that the human spirit is communicated, from age to age, de- spite the petty obstacles invented by those to whom it is not given to understand these deep matters.284 A different view of redemption is clearly held by the Greek authorities who seek the return of these figures from alien lands to the museums and collections of their native country.285 We do not think the motivations sketched above fully account for the desire of some collectors and museums to override the legal and ethical obstacles to looting and export of Cycladic figures from Greece. But we do think that this is the spirit that stands behind the realities of the trade; we see it as explaining why little weight is given to the archaeological wish that Cycladic figures be recovered in a controlled manner that allows knowledge of context, and why the Greek government's efforts to keep Cycladic fig- ures in Greece are regarded by some in the collecting countries of Western Europe and North America as no more than a tiresome and parochial possessiveness. It is also to be remembered that the figures were put into graves. Private collections, and even museum collections, of human bones are increasingly regarded as morally dubious. With good logic, some indigenous groups aspiring to recover and rebury human re- mains they regard as their own have come to regard the grave as encompassing the grave goods, and there- fore require reburial to include artifacts along with 284 From the dream of higher purpose follows a real di- lemma: how is one to discriminate among the various claims of would-be redeemers? This is where the market comes in, and the market values, as the means by which the sole redeemer will come to be chosen. One could say-having observed the manners, financial rectitude, and fate of some of the active players in the antiquities game-that winning the capture in the financial chase does not necessarily imply possessing the higher morality that goes with the role of redeemer. 285 Returned to Greece, or redeemed from export out of Greece, they do not belong specifically to the Cyclades. There are museums in the islands, but the main collections, like the National Museum and the Goulandris Collection, are on the mainland. Excavated material from the Cyclades is now generally held on or near its island of finding, though con- cerns for security may take some pieces to Athens.</page><page sequence="36">636 DAVID W.J. GILL AND CHRISTOPHER CHIPPINDALE [AJA 97 the bones. On this view, the Cycladic figures should go back into the ground, except where they can be unambiguously traced to a non-funerary provenance, and may properly remain above the ground.286 One man's redemption is another man's grave-robbing. Comparative moral values in these matters throw up some anomalies: Cycladica from the Erlenmeyer Collection were auctioned to fund the Erlenmeyer Stiftung, "a foundation for animal welfare," which funds such ideals as "Save the Elephant" and "Save the Rain Forest."287 Another charity might equally choose to sell smuggled ivory and rhino horn in order to safeguard the welfare of Cycladic archaeological sites. Shelby White and Leon Levy say of their collection: "The excitement of collecting has been not only the joy of possessing a beautiful object but the fascination of discovering the links between that object and its place in history."288 What are the histories of the objects in their collection, where are their places in history? Our table 15 (p. 632) shows one kind of an answer: 2 "known," 10 "said to be," 1 "possibly" or "perhaps," 217 "unknown"; 230 total. With so much information lost in the discovery, export, and acqui- sition of these beautiful objects, there are indeed many links between those objects and their place in history to be fascinatingly remade as best can be done from the fragments. Identifying the Masters of Cycladic Art: The Available Information We have described, and attempted to quantify, the degree to which provenances of Cycladic figures are lost or may have been falsified. That lost knowledge damages the potential for recognizing patterns among the figures, whether in morphology, in context, or in distributions in space and time, and particularly afflicts Getz-Preziosi's identifications of individual masters among the Cycladic figure-makers. Getz-Pre- ziosi's suggestion that her "Goulandris Master" was a Naxian289 may be interesting but it is unprovable. Certainly a figure attributed to "his" hand was found in tomb 23 of the Aplomata cemetery on Naxos, but others come, or are said to come, from Amorgos and Keros. Until such time as more of these figures are found in a secure archaeological context, and when they form a large percentage of the pieces attributed to the "Master," ideas of this nature remain in the realm of unprovable speculation. We may have dem- onstrated, above, that destruction of graves is now sufficiently extensive that such time will never come. The attribution of hands presumes that these fig- ures were the works of single people. Yet there is a possibility that the picture emerging is one of regional styles290 and that instead of talking about, say, "the Fitzwilliam Master," we should be talking about the regional characteristics of the island of Amorgos. However, so few of these figures have held their provenance (and alleged provenances are of little help) that these differences may now be beyond iden- tification. Oustinoff's experiments in making Cycladic figures show that the labor held in the known corpus is far from sufficient to make demands on an estab- lished corps of specialized full-time sculptors.291 The corpus itself is not to be trusted, as we have shown. In consequence, an attempt to identify indi- vidual hands and even the characteristics of the sculp- tors within the corpus must be treated with caution. How are we to know if the works attributed to the Goulandris Master reflect "l'expression condens&amp;e du calme, de l'Yquilibre et de l'harmonie des formes sim- ples et complkmentaires que le terme 'idole cycla- dique' voque aujourd'hui"?292 Getz-Preziosi explains her purpose in identifying masters: "A number of sculptors with easily recogniz- able styles are now known from two or more published works. In an attempt to rescue them from total ano- nymity and to facilitate identification, I have named the sculptors after museums (or museum locations) or private collections that contain one or more well- preserved examples of their work; occasionally I have used the name of an archaeologist who has unearthed important pieces attributable to a particular artist."293 The lack of secure provenance for such a high proportion of these figures must cast doubt on their authenticity. If different "sculptors" (or perhaps re- 286 E.g., the Pequots of Connecticut: see the film by C. Chippindale and A. West in the "Down to Earth" series, Thames TV/Channel 4, December 1991. See also "'Shared Principles': A Cooperation Agreement between a Native American Group and Archaeologists," Antiquity 65 (1991) 917-20. "Shared principles," an agreement for the state of Washington, defines the term "human remains" as referring "not only to the interred remains of human beings but also to any ceremonial or funerary remains associated with them." The issue seems never to have been raised in respect to Cycladic antiquities and we do not think it will be. We mention it because it underlines how a virtuous act by one set of morals-redemption of lost beauty from the earth-is a wickedness by another-respect for all that the grave holds rightly in the ground. 287 Sotheby's sale, 13-14 December 1990, catalogue. 288 White and Levy (supra n. 70) ix. 289 Getz-Preziosi 1984, 47; ECANAC 81. 290 Discussion in Fitton 1984, 73 (in the context of Beazley and hands). 291 E.

Possible extra items, which Getz-Preziosi notes as potential candidates for each corpus, are excluded.

Of Getz- Preziosi's 16 "sculptors," six have the potential of not being ancient; one piece attributed to the "Metropol- itan Museum Master," however, was said to have been found on Delos in 1860, and the "name-piece" of the "Ashmolean Master" is said to have been acquired on Amorgos at the end of the 19th century. We address below the intellectual framework within which the identification of masters takes place. For this portion of the paper, we do not dispute whether or not the masters did exist, or whether or not their work indeed holds an individual signature that the educated eye can grasp. The question, however, of "how many works suffice to define a master" arises. A master who exists in a single work is not a master, but a single figure, as the point of the concept is to define an artist's style as evident in a range of work. Two might suffice, but make for an artistic personality too slight to be useful.294 We insist on three as the minimum number of works that can define a "Mas- ter." Knowing the difficulty with fakes, we also request that those works be genuine, for what could be easier than to fake a work in the style of a single genuine figure? No certainty exists as to what in the Cycladic corpus is good, but our best guide will be those figures that are of a secure documented context, for the most part an archaeological excavation. We therefore are obliged to set aside the works that are "said to be," "perhaps," "possibly," or "unknown" in provenance, as capable only of providing circumstantial evidence, and require that a Master offer three or more works of a secure context. Table 16 sets out the works of the masters, as Getz- Preziosi recognizes them, together with their security of provenance. In it, we find two secure masters, the Doumas Master and the Naxos Museum Master; for each there are five works of secure context. There are eight masters we class as insecure because they offer only one or two works of secure context. And there are six masters we reluctantly call inadequate because they offer no works of a secure context; these are the masters whose entire corpus is built on provenances of sand. If we were to ask, not unreasonably, for 8 or 10 pieces as necessary to define masters, then even the two secure masters become insecure. 294 Getz-Preziosi is content with a minimum of two works, the number that defines her Berlin Master.</page><page sequence="38">638 DAVID W.J. GILL AND CHRISTOPHER CHIPPINDALE [AJA 97 Identifying the Individual Craftsman in Prehistory By definition, no actual named individuals can be recovered from the material objects of a truly prehis- toric context, and no prehistoric artists can be named.295 What can more often be isolated, perhaps, is a corpus of work with a range of distinctive and idiosyncratic traits, which may appear to approximate the range of variability of the work of a single indi- vidual, as has been done for Cycladic figures, and also for Benin bronzes and West African woodcarving.296 But it will never be clear that one of these "analytical individuals"297 ("Master of the Cow Sacrifice," "Master of the Uneven Eyes") actually is a single person, or whether the work represents in fact either less than a single craftsworker (whose work actually runs to a wider span of variation) or more than a single crafts- worker, perhaps a workshop, a local or regional tra- dition, or a particular chronological horizon; or whether the distinctive idiosyncrasies actually arise from a particular function or purpose, or some other factor quite extraneous to the personality of the maker. Hill and Gunn's The Individual in Prehistory offers a range of studies in this pursuit for several prehistoric technologies.298 Its authors generally find the identification of an actual individual an unhappy ambition, since the best that can be managed will always be the analytical individual. In our opinion the success of the identification of unnamed masters in Renaissance painting does not indicate that the am- bition, or the method, has equivalent value for pre- historic study. What is available for the Renaissance, and unavailable for Cycladic, is a documented body of work for many named artists, so one can judge the possible corpus of an unnamed master by reference to the range of the known Daddi, Gaddi, or Botticelli; a prehistoric context offers no such prototypes for how an individual personality does or does not show itself in visible and distinctive traits of the body of material in question. Redman's essay in The Individual in Prehistory is skeptical of the value, as well as the possibility, of advancing from the "analytical individual" to the ac- tual individual in prehistory. He remarks: "I believe that a preoccupation with identifying individuals will lead to debates over the validity of identification dis- placing our primary concern-for the processes to be explicated with this information. All too often it seems as though scholars who study the behavior of partic- ular individuals do so at the cost of more general investigations. "299 We are less gloomy than Redman, who thinks his own skepticism "may be excessive," because we can see one good route to testing whether an "analytical individual" in prehistory may actually be one human being. Take a body of material, like Cycladic figures, that seems to show a variability of a kind amenable to identification of the individual. Identify within it an "analytical individual." Then examine the distribution in space and in time of the individual corpus, and see if that matches the range to be expected from the output of a single craftsworker. In the Cyclades, as elsewhere, there are some obstacles. In a small archi- pelago known to have had networks of exchange and trade, spatial distribution may not be decisive. Chro- nological resolution is more promising, but may be blurred if figures are in circulation for any prolonged period, rather than going rapidly into the ground upon their making. Resolution of this important intellectual issue is made impossible by the material consequences of es- teem for the Cycladic masters. As is shown above, the independent evidence for the distribution in space and in time of the figures is vanishingly small: 14 of the 16 masters are insecure or inadequate (table 16), and the information available for the two secure mas- ters (the Doumas and the Naxos Museum) is not sufficient to address their distribution in space and time. The identification of individual Cycladic mas- 295 A remarkable special case from the edge of prehistory is the ancient tradition of painting on rocks in Arnhem Land, northern Australia, which persisted so close to the present that the distinctive style of the painter Najombolmi, who died as recently as 1964, can be recognized on a great many surfaces, which together provide an identifiable corpus of the work of a named yet "prehistoric" artist.

But the idea of the Cycladic masters is central to the esteem now held for Cycladic figures, and provides insights into the treat- ment of prehistoric artifacts as objets d'art, and we therefore explore here its very considerable intellec- tual consequences. We should first remind ourselves of the point and value of identifying the individual masters, as that is expressed in the literature. J. Frel, introducing Getz- Preziosi's 1985 essay on EC sculpture in the Getty Museum, says: "Instead of anonymous marble figures, we can see real people at creative work, communicat- ing in spite of the passage of time and different ways of life."300 Getz-Preziosi herself says that studying sculpture is thought "to identify the personal styles of many individual, if anonymous, sculptors and, in some cases, to trace their development from novices to consummate carvers."'30 And the Virginia exhibi- tion was perceived as making possible a one-man show "devoted to a particularly important sculptor."'302 In literate civilizations, it is the signature that stands for the individual artist; Coe, following Alsop, notes that signed art is known only from six art traditions- the Graeco-Roman world, China, Japan, the Islamic world, Renaissance and later Europe, and (following recent research) the Maya.303 All other traditions have not seen fit to sign as the authentic mark of the individual creator. Identifying the Masters of Cycladic Art: Premises and Consequences of the Method The exemplar for the identification of masters in ancient Greece, of course, is the study of painted pottery, in particular black- and red-figure, as per- fected by Sir John Beazley and his followers.304 Beaz- ley was famously reticent about his methods,305 though confident his eye could distinguish fine grades of distance between artistic personalities and saying "that 'manner', imitation, following, workshop, school, circle, group, influence, kinship are not, in my vocabulary, synonyms."'306 Some of the Beazley attri- butions have been challenged or revised, either by Beazley himself or subsequently.307 In fact, since we do not know fully what criteria Beazley used,308 one cannot apply the same criteria fairly in attempting reattribution. Brian Cook draws our attention to Hadra vases, where different expert eyes have seen different patterns of artistry.309 For an authoritative statement, we therefore go back to the original field where this Morellian method was perfected, the iden- tification of masters in Renaissance painters, and in particular to the classic statement in Berenson's essay, "Rudiments of Connoisseurship.'"'31 The starting point is an identified corpus to gauge the range of a known artistic personality in the ma- terial under study: "To isolate the characteristics of an artist, we take all his works of undoubted authen- ticity, and we proceed to discover those traits that invariably occur in them, but not in the works of other masters." This first condition is violated by the Cy- cladic corpus, for we have, and can have, no indepen- dently identified sets of works of "undoubted authenticity" by any one master of the kind that is provided for Renaissance painters by signed, identi- fied, and documented pictures, and for Greek vase painters by signed pots. The next step is to isolate those little details of form that may unconsciously be characteristic of the hand of an individual painter-the manner of the ears, the hands, the folds of drapery, or the landscape behind the figure.31 The most revealing of all elements in Renaissance art is the manner of painting an ear: because it is part of the head, the ear is invariably painted by the master, rather than assistants, yet it is inconspicuous, unremarked by painter or by patron. This makes it "more characteristic, indeed, than any other detail of the human figure."312 Berenson notes 300 J. Frel, "Introduction," in P. Getz-Preziosi ed., Early Cycladic Sculpture, an Introduction (Malibu 1985). 301 ECANAC 50. 302 ECANAC 50. 303 M.D. Coe, Breaking the Maya Code (London 1992) 24. 304 D. von Bothmer has drawn attention to the difficulties in applying the Beazley methods to Cycladica: Fitton 1984, 73. 305 D. von Bothmer, "Beazley the Teacher," in D.

The Ly- sippides Painter was first identified by Beazley as a black- figure painter, and noted as perhaps the same as the red- figure Andokides Painter (J.D. Beazley, Attic Black-Figure: A Sketch [London 1928] 25, 38-41); later he felt the two were the same (ARV, 1941); and later still, he once more identified them as two different persons (ARV2 2). 308 For Beazley's working methods, see D.C.

GILL AND CHRISTOPHER CHIPPINDALE [AJA 97 that "the Italian painter kept on through a lifetime painting the same ear, because there was absolutely no call for changing it."'313 What are the characteristic details in Cycladic fig- ures that are equivalent to Renaissance ears? There are none! They do not offer significant details at all, because the stylized and simple form of Cycladic sculpture does not provide an aspect to the figures of that nature.314 Usefully, Berenson, as well as providing an account of what is reliable for identifying the individual, also plainly states what is not to be trusted: "The chin, the jaws, the neck, are all too typical, too easily copied, to be a ready indication of precise authorship . .. the followers and copyists of these masters share the same peculiarities, which can therefore serve only as indi- cations of school, and not of the individual artist.""315 The least applicable, then, are these larger features, those that define "structure and movement in the human figure."316 Yet the identification of Cycladic masters rests on exactly those features, of the overall proportions, of the structure and movement in the figure, which are defined by Berenson as no means of diagnosis. Notice also that both Berenson and Beazley ad- dressed painted objects, and painting styles that pre- sent much detail of form and technique in the visible particulars. Many of the Cycladic figures were origi- nally painted, but the sculpted forms with which Getz- Preziosi has worked offer no kind of small-scale vari- ation of the kind the method requires.317 It might be that a sculptural equivalent of the significant painted detail does exist-a recent study of Viking runestones, for example, hopes to distinguish individual carvers by the "signature" left in the cut profile by a carver's tool and his manner of working with it.318 No attempt, however, has been made to show that such a signature exists for Cycladic sculpture. In summary, it seems to us that the identification of the Cycladic masters rests on a misunderstanding of what the Morellian method consists of in any of its established uses. No significant details have been used. Instead, the larger features of morphology have been used to identify groups of figures that are, if anything at all, the Cycladic equivalent of Berenson's schools, "varieties" within such larger groupings as folded- arm figures. The recovery of many hundreds of Keros fragments by Zapheiropoulou and Doumas, and from other fieldwork on Keros, may clarify the issue. But it is not helpful to approach this real variation with a frame of supposed masters in mind. The identification of masters, and the planning out of their artistic biographies, brings with it three fur- ther difficulties. A first, noticed by Beard in respect to Beazley's vase painters, applies with greater force to Cycladic art. As we have no information about vase painters other than what we see in the paintings, any discussion of the personality of the artists is, necessar- ily, a discussion of the paintings themselves conducted by proxy: "There is nothing to be said about them that cannot be said about the pots themselves."319 This is even more true of Cycladic figures, which are less forthcoming in what they seem to say to us.320 Beazley was again wisely reticent on this matter; he ends his essay on the Berlin Painter, written after 55 years of enjoying his "friendly presence," by remarking "per- haps I ought to conclude with a characterization of the artist," hesitates, and makes no attempt.321 Getz- Preziosi has no such reluctance, and fashions not just a characterization but a biography for the Goulandris Master-a modest beginning without self-assurance, sharpening skill and the confidence to essay larger figures, a mature accomplishment in his finest period, less ambitious projects in the declining years of an unusually long or concentrated career.322 This human story is in fact a set of comments on a set of figures chosen by Getz-Preziosi and arranged by Getz-Preziosi in a certain order. The second difficulty is whether the frame of Cy- cladic society, as that is understood from a broad 313 Berenson 129. 314 Painted vases do provide detail that may be significant. Kurtz (supra n. 308) 69 notes: "Five of the nine human figures [on Gorgos's cup] are nude males with a wealth of inner detail, finely painted, describing musculo-skeletal fea- tures." 315 Berenson 132-33. 316 Berenson 144. 317 Renfrew 1991, 116. 318 H.

The Cycladic islands-though falling between mainland Greece and Crete, and in later prehistory therefore placed between two regions of early states- have been economically marginal, with small popu- lations. Broodbank has shown that the little "frying- pans," identified as depicting ships, correspond to boats with a crew of some 25 paddlers. Yet Broodbank suggests that even that complement is so much larger than the population of a prehistoric Cycladic village or hamlet that the boats must have been shared among several villages, which could, together, provide suffi- cient oarsmen to man the vessel; a ship from Melos would command as its crew a third to a half of the male labor force of the island.323 This is a society of subsistence farmers and fishers that has very little in common with those of the ancient world, in Egypt or among the Greek city-states, where there developed a social role for the maker of fine objects that might bear comparison with the artist's position in later European societies. A model for the place of art and of the artist in society that derives from the prosper- ous city-states of Classical Greece or Renaissance Italy is not appropriate. A third, yet simpler, explanation of close similarity in figures is given by Renfrew: "One piece resembles another very closely for the very good reason that it is a direct and recent copy of it."324 Identifying Canonic Proportions in Cycladic Figures The matching innovation in the study of Cycladic sculptures, to go with the identification of the masters, is the identifying of a geometric canon in their di- mensions. The search for a prehistoric canon of course follows from the canonic ideal as a known element in the Classical Greek aesthetics of the later period. The figures are said to be planned by the division of their height into a whole number of equal units, usually three, four, or five; the more complex figures, the harp players, are said to be planned on a rectilinear grid of units; and the angles of the figure follow a harmonic principle of the "golden triangle." This proposition, again due to Getz-Preziosi,325 has been endorsed by other Cycladic specialists.326" Ren- frew notes "Dr Preziosi's important discovery ... that canons of proportion were used in the setting out of the figurines themselves. This is clearly fundamental to our understanding of Cycladic art."327 Getz-Preziosi explains how the formula worked, in her view. In the archaic phase, the sculptor conceived the human form as falling in three equal parts-one for head and neck, one for torso, and one for the legs. Arcs drawn with a primitive compass ensured that certain key points of shoulder and hip fell in with the formula. Later a four-part division was preferred, marked either with a curve or with a straight line, and a few sculptors experimented with three- and five-part designs.328 These propositions need to be examined in terms of two aspects. First, do the dimensions of the figures actually follow these canonic divisions and harmonic proportions? A second is as essential: if they do seem to us to accord with a canon and a harmony, does it then follow that they were designed by artists according to those principles? Figures la and ib, after figures 17a and 17b of Getz-Preziosi's Sculptors of the Cyclades,329 are identi- fied as late classical figures of the Dokathismata vari- ety, whose length is divided into four equal parts. In la, a compass is used, working to a radius of one- quarter the length; and in lb a straight-edge held perpendicularly to the axis of the figure, again divid- ing the figure into four parts. Let us examine the divisions on each figure, starting at the feet. The lower division, marked "3" on figure ib, falls about the middle of the legs in both figures; as the legs are drawn as even tapering curves, without distinct knees or other intermediate features, so di- vision 3 is not a significant point in the composition. The middle division 2 falls, in figure la, well above the pubic triangle, just below the folded arms. In figure lb, it falls just above the pubic triangle, well below the folded arms. In figures 2a and 2b, after Getz-Preziosi's figures 18a and 18b, printed in Sculp- tors alongside 17a and 17b,330 the corresponding ca- nonic division is set, in the case of 2a on the line of the folded arms, and in the case of 2b, below the belt. The canonic division in the middle part of the body, then, is not a distinct point nor does it mark a distinct edge or feature in the composition; it is simply some level or other in the middle zone of the figure. In figures Ic and Id, therefore, we strip out the lower 323 Broodbank (supra n. 5). 324 Renfrew 1991, 115. 325 SC 36-47. 326 E.g., Barber 124-28. 327 A.C.

In each figure it falls neatly at the top of the shoulders, at the figure's widest point. In Ic, it is marked with a curved line, in Id it is marked by a straight-edge.

We notice that the curving line of division 1 in figure Ic falls happily along the profile of the shoulders, where a straight-line construction (le) marks only the outer points. The curving line of division 2 in figure la, however, falls awkwardly across the folded arms and coincides neatly with none of their vertices. In</page><page sequence="44">-H. A.5- a b c Fig. 3.

For division 3, we provide a curved line. In figure lh, we provide a straight line for division 1, and a curve for division 2; for division 3 we use both a curved and a straight line, inter- changeable as this marks nothing in the figure. Getz- Preziosi's canonic analyses use only curves or only straight lines in analyzing any one figure; if individual sculptors are permitted to use one or the other system in different figures, why are they forbidden to use both in the same figure?33 That flexibility in allowing straight/curve hybrids within the canon of 3 or of 4 makes them fit more varied shapes. Figure 3a, after figure 21 la of Getz-Preziosi's Sculp- tors of the Cyclades, is a harp player said to be from Amorgos.332 Getz-Preziosi identifies it as made on an even grid of 6 x 8 squares. A certain number of points and lines in the composition indeed are seen to fall on or not far from the intersections of grid squares. Figure 3b reproduces the same figure, but the even grid is of 5 x 7 squares. Fewer points and lines seem to fall just on or not far from the intersec- tions of grid squares than in figure 3a, but this grid provides 35 rather than 48 points of intersection, so that might be expected. Figure 3c reproduces the figure with a different grid, which like figure 3a has six divisions on one side and eight on the other; instead of being of an equal length as in figures 3a and 3b, the divisions are of different lengths. Again, however, a certain number of points and lines in the composition fall on or not far from the intersections of grid squares.333 Comparing figures 3a, 3b, and 3c, one finds some degree of fit in each case. It does not seem to us that the fit of figure 3a is so decisively better than that of figure 3b as to show the figure was made to a grid of 6 x 8 rather than 5 x 7. Nor does it seem to us that the fit of figure 3a is so decisively better than that of figure 3c as to show the figure was made to a grid of regular rather than irregular divisions. An equivalent analysis can be made of the angles incorporated into the figures, which Getz-Preziosi sees as following the later aesthetic principle of the "golden section." Certainly golden angles can be found in some figures, but no attempt has been made to show they occur so often and so exactly as to prove that the figures were made according to those angles. Various researchers have attempted to recover units of length or geometrical regularities of compo- sition from assemblages of prehistoric or protohistoric objects. The common method is that followed by Getz- Preziosi, to explore a body of material and to see what repetitive multiples of a unit length, or what repeated geometries, declare themselves. The most thorough studies, and the ones most explored for the mathe- matical basis of the method, are Alexander Thom's studies of stone rings and other megalithic monu- ments in northwestern Europe."34 Thom's scheme allows for the rings to have one of several different geometries. The goodness of fit varies; a certain num- ber follow one or another variant in the scheme closely, some deviate by a little, some fit poorly. These discrepancies can be accounted for by the vagaries of constructing with large stones, by their being masses of a certain size rather than exact points, and by the many vicissitudes of subsequent damage, subsidence, and human interference that might shift one or sev- eral stones out of their ideal place. Further, some rings that fit no standard geometry are shown to have a separate order of their own. In its essentials of method, Getz-Preziosi has taken an equivalent ap- proach to Cycladic figures; in a body of material that presents the appearance of a geometric order, there has been found a small variety of canons, which in this case can be applied in two ways (curves and straight-line constructions), to which some figures fit closely, some fit less well, and some do not fit at all. Some of the exceptions, like the harp players, can be accommodated by geometries of their own. The com- mon lack of fit can be accounted for in a reasonable 331 The authorities already permit modifications of the canon, allowing figures with, for example, longer thighs and shorter calves than the narrow canon specifies. 332 SC 42. 333 A mathematical measure of goodness of fit could be constructed to measure distance between "significant" points (lines) and vertices (lines) of the grid. 334 The major publications include A. Thom, Megalithic Sites in Britain (Oxford 1967); A. Thom, Megalithic Lunar Observatories (Oxford 1971); A. Thom and A.S. Thom, Me- galithic Remains in Britain and Brittany (Oxford 1971); and A.

Chippindale, "Archaeology, Design Theory and the Reconstruction of Prehistoric Design Systems," Environ- ment and Planning B 13 (1986) 445-85, discusses the general question and makes further remarks on the megalithic issue. Cherry's study of Minoan units of length is a local example of the narrower question, more easily stated in arithmetical terms, of deriving units from their multiple occurrence: J.F.

About half of the classical four-part female figures are found to follow the canon, and about half do not. Some of these, Getz-Preziosi argues, "were probably laid out quite carefully according to the canon, but as finished works carved in differing planes they no longer reflect the precision of the preliminary drawing made on the raw flat slab." Other works show "a conscious application of the canon but with modi- fications"; these "departures from the norm were probably made deliberately" by an experienced sculp- tor, not a "servant of the formula," who could "adapt the formula to his own aesthetic sensibilities." Quite another interpretation of the geometrical regularities in stone rings is possible. Suppose their builders did not intend exact geometric shapes at all, but simply laid them out by eye into rough circles? In a convincing study, Barnatt and Herring simulated the laying-out of stone rings by placing markers in a circle they judged by eye. They found it was hard to judge an exact circle visually, and the plans of rings that were arrived at in this simple way turned out to contain those geometrical regularities that Thom had thought to arise from a conscious mathematical canon.335 Two hypotheses therefore can be advanced to explain the regularities in the stone rings: either they arise from variability within some craft tradition in which placing is judged by eye; or they arise from the application of a body of complex and formal mathematics. We prefer the former view, by Occam's razor as the simpler explanation of the observed phe- nomena, and because it meshes better with our un- derstanding of the nature of society and of knowledge in later prehistoric northwestern Europe. We should prefer the latter view only if it is shown that 1) a very much greater proportion of the ring plans actually follow closely the formal geometries than would be expected to arise by chance; and 2) the geometrical characteristics of the rings are such as would arise only by a conscious application of those geometries, and could not arise casually in some other way, by accomplished ring builders working within a tradition of strong visual conventions. We believe that a similar and simpler explanation exists for the geometries of the Cycladic figures than Getz-Preziosi's theory of the canon. In their common proportions, the figures do follow the proportions of the human body, as that has often been adapted in craft and art traditions. Her archaic three-part canon gives equal space to neck-and-head as to legs, as in other drawing and carving traditions that also reflect in their preferred geometries the greater importance of head and face than legs in encounters between human beings. We notice the flexibility of fit, as illus- trated in our figures 1-3, which reproduce those figures that constitute the exemplars of canonic ge- ometry in Getz-Preziosi's main publication on the sub- ject; we noted that if one permits divisions by different units and use of curved and straight-line geometries, and if one permits figures to deviate considerably from the canonic ideal, and allows half the population of figures not visibly to follow the canon at all, then the canonic ideal becomes very flexible-dangerously so. Add "a generous allowance for 'sculptor error"' and one can produce "all manner of plausible ratios that are no more than the artifact of our approximate procedures.""336 Getz-Preziosi and others who have searched for-and found-the Cycladic canon have also permitted themselves parallel groups of non- canonical figures, which do not have to follow even these flexible rules. As in the case of the stone rings, it has not been shown that 1) a very much greater proportion of the figures actually follow closely the canons than will be expected to arise by chance; and 2) the geometrical characteristics of the figures are such as would arise only by a conscious application of those canons, and could not arise casually in some other way, by accomplished carvers working within a tradition of strong visual conventions. Following Occam's razor, therefore, and because the abstract principles of academic aesthetics embod- ied in the proposed canon do not mesh well with other evidence for the nature of Cycladic society, we prefer the simpler idea, that these canons of propor- tion did not exist in the minds or the hands of the carvers of the Cycladic figures.337 The same can be said for the angles of the golden section. A good instance of canonic principles can be found in Egyptian art, especially in its earlier periods to the high Old Kingdom, or to about 2100 B.C.-much the same period as Cycladic. But see how varied is the iconographic evidence itself, how exactly it follows canonical rules, and see how many and how compel- ling are the circumstantial sources of evidence that the highly evolved and structured Egyptian civiliza- 335 J.

Yet even there, as Davis's new study of the Egyptian canon notes at its very beginning, the invariance of Egyptian art "cannot simply be taken for granted."338 It simply will not do to assert, without well-founded proof, that Cycladic art follows a canon because a few chosen figures seem to fall near one. Yet a growing literature, as recently as Renfrew's Cycladic Spirit,339 discusses the supposed canon without the necessary first step of showing that the canon exists; let us not commend the canon as "a line for further investigation,"'34 and at the same time act as if it had been proven to exist in such full complexity. Birth of the Genius That Was Greece One reason that Cycladic figures appeal to modern aesthetic taste is that they are perceived as being in some way precursors to Western art. Thimme has commented: "Today, four and a half thousand years later, they enchant us again with the purity of their forms, their freshness, and their perfection. For us they radiate vigor and originality-and they mark the beginnings of European art."34 For Colin Renfrew "these Cycladic marble maidens mark the birth of western art. For we see in them some of those same qualities which so delight us in the korai of the Acrop- olis."342 Or again, "In the art of the Cyclades there is something fresh and arresting, as we see the first steps being taken towards the creation of a European civi- lization."343 Yet it has not been shown that these Bronze Age figures from the islands are directly linked to the continuous tradition that indeed links the kouros sculpture of the island and mainland Greek Archaic, a millennium later, right up to the sculpture of the late 20th century. No continuous sculptural tradition from the Early into the Late Cy- cladic period has been shown, let alone one from Late Cycladic into the Archaic and Classical periods. Cy- cladic figures were known to some individuals in Clas- sical Greece, for a certain number have been found in archaeological contexts of the Classical period,344 but there is no evidence to suggest these in any way influenced the art of the later period. One figure was later built into the wall of a Turkish-period house at Grotta on Naxos: is Cycladic then to be taken as the birth of Ottoman art? It is essential here to distinguish a historical succes- sion, a chain of connections by which one aesthetic is transformed into another, from a chance precursor that happens to prefigure a later, or to echo an earlier, aesthetic. For an example of the former, one has only to look at the Classical sequence in Greece or the aesthetic chain from Greece to Rome and then to Renaissance Europe, and to think of the way the Renaissance was a conscious rebirth of ancient aes- thetics. But a simple coincidence of place that involves cultural traditions at distinct and distant periods does not of itself amount to a continuous tradition. No evidence links the Cycladic carvings of the Bronze Age to, even, the Archaic of the Greek mainland some 15-20 centuries later. The chain of Classical Greek sculpture goes back continuously to the kouros and beyond that, to a disputed extent, to sculpture in Egypt and elsewhere outside Greece. The aesthetic of both the kouros and the Cycladic figures is "simple" or "primitive," but the two traditions are different in all particulars, and they have no historical connection. The Cycladic figures thus are not the first steps toward the traditions of Western art that grew in and from Classical Greece. They are early steps in a direction that happened later to be followed by the traditions of Western art. That, and only that, is why they seem familiar to us, why "we see in them some of those same qualities which so delight us in the korai." Since there is no real historic continuity between Cycladic and Archaic sculpture, the enthusiast who wishes to join them must instead assert a universal aesthetic, take an indirect route, or prefer a more mystical argument. It is this view that these prehistoric figures indeed spoke to the sculpture of the Archaic and Classical periods of Greece and then somehow to us today that Joseph Masheck, Professor of Art His- tory at Hofstra University, takes in his essay "On Neolithic Ultramodernity," remarking that "in them, it is sometimes as if the Greek archaic proper, that first dawn of classicism itself, were still just beneath the horizon.'"345 338 W.

GILL AND CHRISTOPHER CHIPPINDALE [AJA 97 This desire to find the roots of Western civilization extending into the fisher-farmer societies on the bar- ren soils of rocky islands in the middle of the Aegean is curious, when there are developed states and civi- lizations across the eastern Mediterranean-in Ana- tolia, the Near East, Egypt-with documented links to Greece. The diagnostic clue is, Masheck explains, in the values of marble: "Marble: raw substance of entire mountains, sea-smoothed pebbles washed ashore. Marble catches the light and the imagination. It invites touching and handling. The bright, often translucent appearance and tactile properties of white marble are very compelling indeed."346 Although the medium of marble might touch both the third millen- nium B.C. and the second millennium A.D., this does not demonstrate that the roots of Western civilization lie in Greece. This attempt to privilege Greece is not uncommon. In the history of Western art, Gombrich looks back to the "Greek revolution" with the introduction of nar- rative art.347 Yet many of the motifs used on painted pottery in early Iron Age Greece were merely bor- rowed (and misunderstood) from the Near East.348 The Greek alphabet derives from the Levant coast.349 The introduction of monumental sculpture to Greece in the Archaic period, notably the striding youths, or kouroi, has long been seen in the light of possible influence from Egypt. It is, however, the "Greek ge- nius" that has been emphasized: in democracy, in theater, and in philosophy. In this improving story it is easily forgotten that Greece also "gave us" slavery and that the ability of Athens to beautify itself was built on a consuming imperialism. It is the visible attempt to isolate Greece from its eastern (and cer- tainly southern) links that has surfaced in the contem- porary debate about Martin Bernal's Black Athena.350 The collector, like the Getty Museum and like White and Levy, who wishes to extend backward from a nucleus of Classical material, has a choice between a cultural continuity, which leads toward Egypt, and a geographical continuity, which leads toward Cycladic. The Getty, like White and Levy, has chosen Cycladic. What perspective does the cool historian of art take, recognizing the chronological gap to be bridged in linking the Cycladic genius to the Classical? Martin Robertson takes "art in Greece before the Iron Age" as the "prologue" to his History of Greek Art.351 He identifies the Cycladic marble figures as "the first sustained production of objects of aesthetic interest in Aegean lands,"352 and notices that the figuring of musicians provides evidence of two civilized crafts: "The quality of these figures, and the evidence they give of musical attainment, suggest that quite a for- ward stage of culture had been reached in the Cyc- lades at this time."353 Without a documented link, a bridge must be made in a slightly mystical manner from Cycladic to the Late Bronze Age, Mycenaean world: "These are not cases of 'influence', but per- haps of some kind of inherited slant."354 An aspect to this issue is the changing relative values given to European and to non-European cultures, as the modern age of empires comes to an end. In the first half of this century, the British and French em- pires spanned the globe, and Europe saw its cultural roots also to lie at a distance, in Childe's "most ancient east." It remains the case that the first fundamental of European later prehistory, the adoption of agri- cultural ways of life, came into Europe from Asia, although megalith-building and some aspects of met- alworking--other imported skills in the old diffusion- ist view-are autonomous European inventions. The bundle of traits we call "civilization" in the Greek city- states also derives in large measure from the East. These facts of history fit less comfortably the mood of the early 1990s, when the Soviet Union, last of the modern empires, has unbundled itself, and when Eu- rope envisions its fine future as a strong confederacy of autonomous nations freely joining to work to- gether, a Europe independent of other continental powers and self-sufficient in its spirit. Archaeological proofs of a united, autonomous, and pan-European history are welcome. The strongest precedent is of- fered by the Celts, a distinctive and fine artistic tra- dition and ethnic identification that is pan-European 346 ECANAC 46. 347 E.

The whole story is safely, reas- suringly contained within the boundaries of European civilization, in the lands of the European community as we wish to define it today. It is not a coincidence that the wish aesthetically to vault from Classical Greece back to Cycladic is strong in 1993. This takes us back to Winckelmann's view of the world: "Good taste . . . first began to emerge on the soil of ancient Greece."356 Renfrew has taken particular note of the big Cy- cladic figures, the largest now approaching life-size. Noting the rarity in early artistic traditions of life-size human depictions, and its importance as indicator of a precocious and advanced aesthetic, he regards the scale of these eccentrically large examples as essential to Cycladic esteem.357 Setting the questions of prove- nance and authenticity aside, we instead agree with Broodbank, who comments: Is it realistic to look upon the equally uncommon monumental figures as the outcome of heroic and pre- cocious attempts at a life-size portrayal of the human form ... ... what we really see is a scaling-up sequence from the smaller pieces, via intermediate examples of unusual but sub-human size. Is it therefore not more plausible to view the largest works as an outcome of status-driven competitive emulation-of a species of Peer Productivity Interaction? This is not to belittle the skill needed to make them, nor to deny that the by- product is indeed a life-size rendition; it is merely to distinguish between ancient intention and modern con- ception.358 Conceptions of Cycladic and Historical Scholarship: The Case of the Baitylos The Cycladic industry is funded by the collectors, their singular passions, judgments, and concerns. Naturally, many take an amateur interest in what they collect, and wish to learn more. The museums and the market-makers are encouraged, even obliged, to take notice of these well-meant enthusiasms, and a perceptible respect is therefore offered to the collec- tors' ideas about their treasures, even when they bear little relation to any reliable historical scholarship. The collector may be the patron of the scholar. And a primary obligation of the museum curator is to acquire and, in the present mood, this means humor- ing and nursing the collector in the hope that a pres- ent expectation may be turned into a real acquisition. The point is illustrated by the identification of some Cycladic artifacts, those that seem to be simple, shaped pebbles rather than naturalistic sculptures, as "sacred stones," or baetyls. In following this religious interpre- tation of small pebbles in Early Cycladic graves, the Erlenmeyers359 and others360 have looked to Classical cults of Asia Minor and Cyprus where sacred rocks were worshipped as deities.361 These baetyls were usually conical in shape, and their images are often found on the coinage of the city. One of the most famous stones was that at Perge in southern Turkey, which was identified as the goddess of hunting, Ar- temis. Another was located at Paphos on Cyprus, and was worshipped as the goddess of love, Aphrodite. Elsewhere on Cyprus, near Amathus, an inscription indicates a cult place of "the Seven within the Stelai," presumably a group of seven baetyls, perhaps also dedicated to Aphrodite.362 The presence of baetyls in several cities in the eastern Mediterranean during the Classical period gives us no ground to interpret these polished marble pebbles-which are considerably smaller than Classical baetyls-as sacred rocks so many centuries earlier. This confusion-between very large stones in An- atolian temples of the Classical period with known function and meaning, and very small stones in Cy- cladic graves of the third millennium with unknown function and meaning-rests on the most elementary 355 See R. and V. Megaw, "The Celts: The First Europe- ans?" Antiquity 66 (1992) 254-60, on the great Celtic exhi- bition ("I Celti") in Venice, 1991. 356 J.J.

GILL AND CHRISTOPHER CHIPPINDALE [AJA 97 error of scholarship. By chance, it recapitulates a previous error of research, in which the idea of baetyls again was the source of confusion. Late in the 19th century, the senams, certain stone monuments of the North African littoral, were identified as sacred stones of some kind.363 Large, rude, and erected in the form of doorways, they were also connected to the prehis- toric megalithic structures of Europe, and specifically to Stonehenge in southern England, whose stone tril- ithons they seemed to match closely in their form. Decent archaeological fieldwork soon showed them to be ruins of Roman olive presses, not baetyls, not prehistoric, not anything to do with Stonehenge.364 A century on, the collectors' fancies drag into Cycladic studies an equivalent error--or a worse one, since at least the Libyan senams were much the same size and shape as Stonehenge trilithons. The errors in the logic of the baetyl are clear. More subtle are the discrepancies in reasoning like the fol- lowing: Since I view the canonical figure as a portrayal of the Great Goddess of the Cyclades, and since her image was found in at least one case (on Keros) in a grave with two musician figures, it seems to me logical to suppose that the Cycladic harpists, flautists, and syrinx-players were closely connected with the goddess. Representations on Sumerian reliefs of the third millennium provide the closest parallels for the Aegean harp-form and repeat- edly show harpists present at cult banquets. Anton Moortgat regards these scenes on votive reliefs as rep- resenting the Feast of Spring and the New Year. Ac- cording to Marie-Louise and Hans Erlenmeyer, the reunion of the goddess with the god newly returned from the lower world was celebrated at the New Year's Feast. This celebration, as it is shown in the Sumerian representations, must have resounded with harp music. It does not seem to me too far-fetched to associate similar religious practices with the Cycladic musician figures and to view them as attendants of the Great Goddess who accompany her with music as she rises from the underworld and ascends to the heavens.365 Notice that the well-meaning and ill-informed con- cepts of the Erlenmeyers, amateurs in these matters but-importantly-wealthy patrons in the Cycladic industry, figure with a large respect in this specula- tion, which mashes together a variety of fragments (rather far removed in space, time, and social context from Cycladic) and some fictions (like the nature of New Year's Day ritual) into an ancient vision that is based more on soul than on scholarship. The only authority for the New Year reunion of goddess and god is the suggestion that two collectors believe it- yet it is made the base of a scholarly sounding hy- pothesis about the meaning and role of the musicians, which is endorsed and printed in a standard scholarly work on Cycladic art. Again, from the same source: The hypothesis that Cycladic idols serve the cult of the Great Goddess and Mother, the Queen of Heaven who descends to the underworld and from it ascends to new life, who possesses a daughter and is occasionally accompanied by musicians: such an interpretation, I believe, is in complete accord with all the different forms of the canonical idol known to date.366 Flattering the Collectors It is agreed a great many Cycladic figures are fakes. But the discussion of individual figures proceeds, sin- gle figure by single figure, single collection by single collection, on the assumption that each one is genuine. To admit to having bought a fake is, for a museum, to declare itself professionally incompetent or, for a collector, to announce one has been made a fool. When the spirit of acquisition is the connoisseur's instinctive recognition of quality, to be duped is very much to admit to a personal failing of character. Elia remarks of The Cycladic Spirit: Doumas, who, like Renfrew, owes a debt of gratitude to the Goulandrises for being allowed to publish their collection, never mentions what troubles this reader: Since a flood of fakes was infiltrating the art market when the Goulandris Collection was being formed, is it not possible, even likely, that some of the Goulandris marbles are fakes? Unfortunately, Renfrew, who else- where shows a keen awareness that in archaeology all assumptions must be made explicit and all evidence carefully evaluated, here simply ignores the question and presumes that all the objects in the Goulandris Collection are authentic.367 Elia thinks reticence about fakes goes with the un- equal relation between collector-patron and scholar- consultant: The reluctance of scholars to deal with the problems that are inherent in the study of private collections springs from the fact that the relationship of scholar to 363 H.S.

The obligation owed to the collector-for hos- pitality, access, and sometimes financial support-tends to compromise the researcher's objectivity and corrupt his or her intellectual honesty. An added complication is the fact that the scholar's publication of a collection inevitably serves to authenticate the collection and in- crease its market value.368 Elia might have listed other facets, such as the financial arrangements for Renfrew's Cycladic Spirit, whose copyright is owned by the Nicholas P. Goulan- dris Foundation or the commissioning by the Goulan- dris Museum of a monograph on the Goulandris Master by Getz-Preziosi.369 Presentations and Perceptions in Cycladic Studies: The Choice of Words and the Values They Carry It has recently been fashionable to emphasize the subjective element in how we view the past, the role of our values and preconceptions; in the more radical view, we construct a past in the present to suit our- selves. It is certainly true that we reconstruct the past within, necessarily, a modern world; we make sense of the past insofar as it intersects with our modern perceptions. We express our perceptions about the Cycladic world in what we say about the objects, and in the way we look at them. Running through the newer literature on Cycladic sculpture is a vocabulary of fine art, and with that vocabulary is carried along some conceptions about Cycladic society as a fine society, a vision that is at odds with the archaeological picture of poor islands with small populations living at a simple subsistence level, without great towns or patrons of the visual arts. Many words in the literature can be explored. We indicate first the general point by offering a choice of sentences to describe the man- ufacture of a Cycladic figure, and then address three examples only, two in words and one in the physical: the words "Master" and "civilization," and the habit of displaying Cycladic figures upright. Consider these three short sentences: "The Master sculpts the idol in his workshop." "The carver crafts the figure in his hut." "The rustic shapes the pebble in his hovel." Each sentence describes the same act in words that are near-synonyms in their first meanings, but they make the act high, middle, or low in its social impli- cations, level of artistic refinement, and social and physical context of labor. The placings of high, mid- dle, and low are themselves statements of attitude, setting craft as a respectable skill but a lesser gift than a fine art. "Master." Let us consider the word "Master" in terms of a maker of Cycladic figures. The Oxford English Dictionary defines "master" in this sense as "an artist of distinguished skill, one of those who are regarded as models of excellence in their art," and the ideal of the master with his school or workshop, as the social framework where the making of fine things can best be accomplished, of course derives from the practice of medieval and Renaissance Eu- rope, as Alberti and others describe it. So the word "Master"-not quite the same as the word "master," since the initial capital itself carries meaning-refers to more than accomplishment; it goes with the word "masterpiece," the piece made expressly to use and to show off the Master's skills.370 And it also goes with the places of art, of the artist and of the connoisseur of art as these have been experienced in the Western world these last few centuries. When the Morellian method, and a fuller knowledge of the historical au- thorities, made it possible to define unnamed hands and personalities, distinctive in the manner of the known, named masters, they could therefore be de- fined as Masters, the "Master of Fl6malle" or the "Master of the Life of Mary." J.D. Beazley, applying Morelli's method to Classical Greek painted pottery, identified named and anonymous potters and paint- ers, like the "Berlin Painter," together with their con- comitant satellites of "group of," "class of," "circle of," and "manner of," following the medieval and Renais- sance model again of "school of," "workshop of," and "manner of"; a parallel framework has been followed for the study of the Greek Classical sculptor. In this way, the context of artistic production in later Western societies has been projected back onto the Classical world. Perhaps pots were made and painted in Clas- sical Greece in a context of masters, assistants, work- shops, and schools so closely resembling those of easel painting, sculpture, and decorative arts in postmedi- eval Europe that just the same words are in order; but that similarity needs to be demonstrated, rather than carried in as the intellectual hand-baggage of a convenient set of words. In a further projection, the later Western frame- work has now been projected back onto the Cycladic 368 Elia 67. 369 See ECANAC 233 in the discussion of the Goulandris Master. 370 See subtitle to Renfrew 1991: Masterpieces from the Nicholas P.

The first-which frankly puzzles us-is that the carvers are called Mas- ters with a capital M. Although Classical Greek painted pottery is one of the most technically accom- plished of all ceramic traditions, and although Beazley had the highest regard for the great hands in Classical pottery, he stopped short of the word Master in his later writings," preferring the more reticent "Potter" and "Painter." We think he was right, for "Master" carries with it certain implications of a social frame- work that the more neutral terms of potter and painter, and for Cycladic figures the word "carver," do not bear. Getz-Preziosi, fully understanding how small the populations of the Cycladic islands may have been, and therefore how few and solitary may have been the carvers, nevertheless chooses the word "Mas- ter," a word that is high rather than middle in its aesthetic and social implications. Other projections from later aesthetic traditions have come to be applied to the Cycladic figures in the same way. Getz-Preziosi divides her sculptors into "archaic," "classical," and "late classical" phases.372 Thimme follows a similar scheme, defined by a formal aesthetic progression from a Precanonical, through to the Canonical, and then the Postcanonical.373 Pre- canonical figures lead to "the establishment of the canonical type," including "the hesitant beginnings of the folded-arms position."374 This series of projections depends for its safety on a series of premises, which deserve notice. A first is that the model of master and workshop indeed fairly represents the conditions under which works of art were made in early modern Europe. We here accept that it does, but also notice the intellectual context under which this ordering was made. Just as the 19th century saw the ordering of the collected objects of archaeology, with the three-age chronology imposing system on prehistory and the essential frameworks of Classical archaeology being built, so the same period saw an equivalent chronicling, cataloguing, and or- dering of the subjects of the art historian's study. There the essential framework was authenticity, to define the central corpus of the named masters, and the penumbra of other and lesser works-"school of," "copy of," "after," "in the manner of"-that surround it. Now, this intellectual need, to bring order into the multitude, found a corresponding need to establish an equivalent order in the artistic marketplace, to sort out which of the countless paintings "said to be by Rubens" that had been carried proudly home from the Grand Tour really were works of the master, and which were simply "bought as Rubens." Out of it came the clear hierarchy of quality, and correspondingly of price-a hierarchy that goes from the summit of a certain work by the master to the trough of a copy made by an anonymous hand at some subsequent time and in some distant place-which structures the art market to this day. It is expressed for example in the variety of phrases in customary use in the auction catalogues that run from the artist's full name, indic- ative of a secure attribution to the master's hand alone, down to "manner of" for the least authentic.375 The orderly running of the market enjoys this familiar structure, which is duly emerging for Cycladic figures. As well as the named "Masters" of Cycladic art (whose reliable identification we addressed above, pp. 636- 37), the attributions are now being extended to the followers of the Masters: a 1991 Christie's sale cata- logue identifies one figurine as "in the style of the Schuster Master,"376 duly beginning to extend out to Cycladic the salesroom structure of art. The concept of the Master is itself embedded in the larger scheme 371 "Master" is to be found in early Beazley writings, and from 1911 to 1914, he consistently defined painters in this fashion, e.g., "The Master of the Berlin Amphora,"JHS 31 (1911) 276-95; "The Master of the Troilus-Hydria in the British Museum," JHS 32 (1912) 171-73; "The Master of the Boston Pan-krater,"JHS 32 (1912) 354-69; "The Master of the Achilles Amphora in the Vatican," JHS 34 (1914) 179-226. In 1916 he turned to the term "Painter," e.g., "Fragment of a Vase at Oxford and the Painter of the Tyszkiewicz Crater in Boston," AJA 20 (1916) 144-53. The classic reference books on red- and black-figure pottery use the terms "Potter" and "Painter." See also M. Robertson, "Beazley and Attic Vase Painting," in Kurtz (supra n. 305) 26-27. There is now a return to the word "master" in connection with vase painting; Theodorou recently described decorated potsherds "attributed to Euthymides, Makron, the Tripto- lemos Painter, the Pan Painter, the Brygos Painter, the Co- penhagen Painter, and Polygnotos" as works of "Red Figure masters of the archaic and classical periods": J. Theodorou, "Ancient Art at Princeton," Minerva 2.3 (1991) 22.

Rubens, of course, means something else again). The Cy- cladic Masters do not, yet, have first names. 376 Christie's sale catalogue, 10 July 1991, lot 130.</page><page sequence="53">1993] CONSEQUENCES OF ESTEEM FOR CYCLADIC FIGURES 653 of an artistic life cycle of birth, florescence, and de- cline, which is shared by the archaeological expecta- tion of three-phase early, middle, and late (or pre- Classic, Classic, and post-Classic) structures. Both the scholar and the market have a need for a secure order, and a hierarchy of values, but there are two dangers in that coincidence of interest. The more obvious danger is a direct corruption. Tragedy came to Bernard Berenson, the greatest master of the Mo- rellian method in its first application to European painting, when he allowed the two interests to be fused together, the market interest corrupting, and overrid- ing, the scholarly interest. He became associated di- rectly with transactions in the market, so that his scholarly eye was turned also by a personal market interest, and his intellectual ruin followed.377 No such public calamity has been seen to occur in the study of Classical pottery, fortunately,78" and no public scandal has followed from the many close associations of con- sultancy, identification, and writing of sale catalogues between scholars and market-makers in the Classical field, or in Cycladic. Yet there is a real conflict. Distin- guished scholars identify, authenticate, and explore the items in-to name one of many-the White and Levy Collection; great museums celebrate them in the finest of public places. Auction houses employ the scholars to write catalogue entries, or refer to those scholars' works as good authority for opinions of provenance and attribution. The market value of the pieces depends on those catalogue entries and opin- ions. The identification of named masters is surely a factor in building the standing of the whole market in Cycladic art, as well as giving pieces named for masters a standing above the anonymous masses. To identify a figure as by a named master is an act with financial consequences. A new profession of "ancient art consultant" lives by this interest. It is significant, we think, that the senior Classical archaeologists who direct the Beazley Archive at the University of Oxford, a world resource for the attri- bution of Classical ceramics, in 1991 made public their concern about how its resources are used: "The Beaz- ley Archive has been increasingly concerned about protecting its reputation in the scholarly world against appearing to condone the trade in illegally exported antiquities, by allowing the use of its resources for the enhancement of the value of Greek vases of no clear origin."79 Accordingly, the Archive has resolved: "Our intention is to ensure that the Archive is not, and is not seen to be, used in any way which might lead to the commercial enhancement of objects which may be suspected of having been removed illegally from the country in which they were found."380 Also at Oxford, the University Research Laboratory for Archaeology and the History of Art has decided not to perform thermoluminescent testing to authen- ticate terracotta figures from West Africa, specifically Mali, which are being looted and smuggled for the market in much the same way as Cycladic figures.381 We do not suggest in any way that there is any direct scholarly corruption in respect to Cycladic fig- urines. But we do think that the coexistence of the different interests is becoming more difficult. In Cy- cladic, as in other fields, one notices that the same experts are active in scholarship, in the museums, and in advising for the market. And one notices how many of the attributions include and depend on "probably," "possibly," "perhaps," and the insidious "said to be." "Said to be"-by whom, to whom, with what motive, on what authority? And how often may "said to be" stand for "wanted [by whom?] to be"? The less obvious, and the more real, danger is the treating of the two interests, those of the present market and those of the historian of the past, as if they were wholly equivalent. There is no harm in building a structure for the Cycladic market entirely to suit the market's convenience, with its greater and lesser Masters, its enigmatic masterpieces that have yet to find an identified Master, its school of this Master, and its style of that, provided it is also and always understood that the whole masterly structure may be a modern public convenience, not a re-crea- tion of the social and intellectual realities of the pre- historic Cyclades. Yet, in a real world in which the scholars and the market-makers live closely together, the convenience of one comes to be imposed on the other. Renfrew reminds us of an important aspect to the "striking progression" of the kouroi of Archaic Greece from the very schematic to the relatively naturalistic: "The relative dating of the kouroi depends almost entirely upon these stylistic criteria, so that the im- 377 C.

Behrman, Duveen (Lon- don 1952). 378 Sir John Beazley, whose eye and judgment came to have an equivalent authority for Greek painted pottery, has a reputation for having been scrupulous in not giving opin- ions for the benefit of the market. 379 Policy statement 1991, signed by John Boardman, J.J.

GILL AND CHRISTOPHER CHIPPINDALE [AJA 97 pression of a well-dated evolutionary sequence is a spurious and circular one, the product of the precon- ceptions of the modern scholar."382 Here is a coinci- dence of interest; it is convenient both for the market and for the analytical art historian to regard stylistic development and chronological date as synonyms; it helps neither for some kouroi to be "schematic and late" or "naturalistic and early." Yet the historical reality might be less straightforward; if the evidence for it were to come to light, the scholar's duty would be to follow it, however upsetting to a neat analysis. The market might see benefit in the precocious genius of "naturalistic and early"; for the rest, we would expect it to stick to the old and convenient equation of style and date, because it is directed by market- making convenience more than historical accuracy. The earliest classification of Cycladic figurines named its identified types after the sites where ex- amples were found,383 the Plastiras type for a ceme- tery on Paros where four such figurines were found in a single grave,384 the Louros type for a grave at Louros Athalassou on Naxos where seven of the fig- ures had been placed in a niche.385 From a scheme that named the figures by archaeological context, con- noisseurship has preferred a framework that is linked to possession. The use of the term "Master" by Getz-Preziosi in itself might suggest that these figures were created by a single man.3"6 Her 16 "sculptors" are named in two ways. The two in the first group are named after excavators in the Cyclades: C. Doumas and N.M. Kontoleon. The 14 in the second group are named after the present or previous proprietor of type-fig- ures, either museums387 or private collectors.388 The original masters, those of Renaissance painting, are generally named after the subjects of defining pieces, like the Master of S. Giles for the painting of the Legend of S. Giles, or the place where the defining piece resides, like the Master of Moulins. The new habit for Cycladic follows the place or the present private proprietor:389 we have a Steiner Master as well as a Naxos Museum Master, but we have no Master of the Folded Arms, or Master of the Biggest Ears. This is a small matter, but one that tells of the modern dominance of the proprietor over the character of the thing he possesses.390 To name a Master after the collector who is the present proprietor is another means to flatter the patron-connoisseur. See how the greatest and most productive of the Masters, the Gou- landris, is named for the greatest and most successful of the collectors, Nicholas and Dolly Goulandris. To have a Master named for one, says Dolly Goulandris, is "rather fun."'39 "Civilization." A division between the civilized- "we"-and the barbarians-"they"-was central to the Classical Greek and Roman views of their world, and the higher ideals of their own societies. That division, and attitude, remains with us: we are proud of our civilized societies, but conscious that the barbarian forces may at any time mass at the gate to pillage and burn us out. Barbarian remains a term of denigra- tion. The archaeological definition of civilization is in other terms, by reference to a number of definable traits, the traits that go with cities and with state societies-a large population of 20,000 plus, a class- based hierarchy under king or emperor, an army, centralized bureaucracy, tribute-based taxation, estab- lished law, urban settlement, frontier defense, roads, a priestly class, pantheistic or monotheistic religions, palaces, temples, and other public buildings.392 These primary traits are, for the most part, evident in Clas- sical Greece. All are absent from the Bronze Age Cycladic islands. By this conventional definition Cy- cladic was a barbarian society, not a civilization. Davis remarks, of the inappropriate term "Cycladic civili- zation": Life in the islands in the Early Cycladic period bore none of the hallmarks of civilizations: no, or few, large communities, no written records, no spectacular build- ings, and no palaces of the sort built later on Crete and 382 Renfrew 1991, 129. 383 Renfrew 1969. 384 SC 9. 385 SC 11. Other types are Drios (Paros), Kapsala (Amor- gos), Spedos (Naxos), Dokathismata (Amorgos), and Cha- landriani (Syros). 386 We presume that the term "mistress" could be misun- derstood, e.g., "The Copenhagen Mistress," although the possibility of craftswomen should not be excluded. 387 E.g., the Metropolitan Museum Master, and the Athens Museum Master. 388 E.g., the Steiner Master (Paul and Marianne Steiner, New York), and the Goulandris Master (N.P. Goulandris, Athens). 389 As individual proprietors, rather than museums and institutions, are naturally transient beings, the defining pieces will by degrees come no longer to be found in the possession of those after whom they were named. 390 Does one have a choice in these matters, as one has when made a British lord? 391 FLOM. 392 Generally following Service's four-part division of hu- man societies.

On the contrary, Early Cycladic settlements were small, the buildings modest--of small stones set without mor- tar-and graves were seldom richly furnished. (Modern visitors to an excavated settlement or cemetery would find little to hold their attention.) It is likely that all or most settlements were independent, and no evidence points to the political unification of an entire island, let alone of the Cyclades as a whole.393 Of course, if one follows the woolly notions of space and time that are evident in dreaming of the baetyl in Cycladic prehistory, or of Cycladic peasants follow- ing Sumerian state theology, one may look to a society a little removed in space, whether on Crete or on the Greek mainland, and more than a little removed in time, and-finding it agreeably civilized---choose to regard Cycladic society as civilized, which by any proper historical scholarship, it is not.394 Cycladic Figures: Lying Down or Standing? We previously linked the rise in esteem for Cycladic figures to their convenience in a modern era of smaller dwellings (supra p. 608). We see Cycladic figures as having the presence of large objects, yet they are small enough for the mantelpiece: "These Cycladic figures, though small in size, have a monu- mental, hieratic presence."395 On the Manhattan man- telpiece, or in the museum display case, Cycladic figures are invariably placed upright.396 Yet they do not stand upright unsupported, and are now always held in the vertical by mounts or by wires round their necks. Clearly, this is how we choose to see Cycladic figures today, and the vertical rule derives from the upright figure as the common form of the large, grandiose, heavyweight sculpture, whether one of a thousand Lenins leading the masses to a proletarian victory, or a Winston Churchill in Parliament Square. The monumental miniature follows the upright model of the full-scale monumental. Whoever saw a massive Lenin lying down, except in disgrace after the fall of the Communist Party monolith? What about the way the figures were held in pre- history, whether in life or when placed in the grave? For the reasons exhaustively discussed above, the di- rect evidence is slight. One can begin with the obser- vation that figures do not stand safely on their own feet, nor are the feet set in or on a base. Yet the feet of the figures are carved with care and detail, with individual toes even on small figures. It therefore appears that most397 figures were made neither to stand by themselves, nor to be inserted into stands or pierced holes that would support them upright. Getz- Preziosi,398 using what evidence there is, envisages the figures as being held or carried in a horizontal posi- tion, small figures in the hand, larger figures on the two outstretched palms of the bearer.399 In Early Cy- cladic Art in North American Collections, Getz-Preziosi says of their presentation: "One or two of the char- acteristic folded-arm figures are shown in the reclin- ing position intended by their sculptors ... but, for reasons of visibility ... , the majority of the works in the exhibition are displayed and illustrated in the conventional manner."400 Getz-Preziosi again: "In the sterile environment of a display case, the figure looks stiff and fragile, unnaturally-and, I dare say, incor- rectly-posed on the tips of its toes."401 Against this, Renfrew sees the figure as intended to be upright, "figures whose down-pointed toes allow them very conveniently to be propped up against a vertical sur- face and thus seem upright"; he thinks the double figures, of one standing on another's head, clinches 393 Davis, "Perspectives" (supra n. 2) 6. The concept of a Cycladic civilization is used, Davis notes, by Doumas and Papathanassopoulos (a recent example is Doumas [supra n. 13] 25-31). It is, in Davis's view, a poor translation of the Greek word 7toXkLTLJi6og, long used to describe the culture of the Cyclades in the EBA. A similar confusion can arise with the French word "civilisation," which properly describes those less urban, less differentiated, and less complex soci- eties of later prehistory that in English are not civilizations. The "Bell Beaker culture" of Anglophone prehistory is "La civilisation des vases campaniformes" in Francophone pre- histoire. Commonly, it is the assemblages of the Late Neo- lithic, Copper, and Bronze Ages of Europe--of which Cycladic is a regional variant-that are divided by the lan- guages in this way. 394 Notice, in this respect, the choice of title and subtitle for Renfrew's Emergence of Civilisation: The Cyclades and the Aegean in the Third Millennium B.C.; he reminds us (in a letter of 14 November 1992) that the word "civilization," defined in much the manner as we use it, is not applied in that book to the third millennium B.C. 395 Perrot (supra n. 182) viii. 396 The title page spread to ECANAC illustrates a figure set horizontally. It does look different in this pose. 397 Most, not all. Some figures, the harp players among them, rest happily on a flat base with the figure sitting upright. 398 SC 52. 399 For Cycladic figures sitting comfortably in the hand or along the arm, see C.

GILL AND CHRISTOPHER CHIPPINDALE [AJA 97 the point.402 Museums and auction catalogues invar- iably depict the figures upright, which flatters them as monumental miniatures.403 The vertical pose of the Cycladic figure today, then, arises from modern habits in monumental sculpture rather than such clues to prehistoric attitude as we have. And because Cycladic figures will not stand up on their own, they are now inserted into molded perspex blocks to hold them upright: the physical aspects of their presentation begin to follow the intel- lectual consequences. Cycladic Figures: White or Colored? One of the best-known instances in all archaeology of a discrepancy between ancient reality and modern perceptions concerns the color of Classical marbles. Originally painted, they have since lost their color, so that Classical revivals have, over the centuries, revered the surface qualities of clean, austere white marble rather than the painted ancient ideal. Even today, when one has knowledge of that transformation, the sight of a Classical figure painted in its original bright finery shocks;404 it is so different, so alien, so removed from what one has become used to. Precisely the same story applies to the Cycladic figures. Many bear traces of blue and red paint, or "ghost" areas where the paint has left a different surface texture.405 Renfrew says of our high regard for the simple power of the whitened figures: "We see Cycladic figures as pure in their whiteness. The absence of surface detail emphasizes the simplicity of form and all is reduced to clean lines and the polished surface of Cycladic marble, but it was not always so."406 Broodbank comments: Let me suggest a visual experiment. Trace a figurine on white paper. Add (not in time-faded hues or modest black-and-white stippling, but bright hematite red and azurite blue): head and pubic hair, lycanthropic eye- brows and staring almond eyes, densely tattooed dots or vertical gashes over most of the face, and necklaces and bracelets at throat and wrist.407 Alternatively, look at the rare figurines that do depict features such as eyes, ears or baldric in relief; these get a hard time for their 'fussiness', but in fact tell us much about how their bleached sisters once looked. Whichever method one chooses, what looks back at us is something extraordi- nary but utterly 'other'. Detail in no sense intends to emphasize form or line, and, if anything, distracts from it. Rather, its aim is to send out messages significant to an early Cycladic observer. Indeed, the range of tattooed motifs and hair arrangements attested408 may indicate that the painted surface records crucial messages con- cerning diversity over the neutral and standard canvas of the marble form.409 Broodbank notices that other Cycladic artifacts, such as the vessels densely covered with elaborate painted or stamped and incised designs among the prestige pottery of the Keros-Syros culture, suggest that great importance was attached to surface de- tail.410 If the Cycladic figures were commonly painted, and if their simple beauty is unusual in Cycladic ma- terial culture, the loss of paint may be the central issue in understanding them. The simple forms, and the lack of detail, may arise only from their being taken back, by the chance of time, into an unfinished state: what we see and delight in are the plain, preliminary blanks that were made primarily in order to carry the essential variability of colored decoration-the mean- ing that mattered. If that were the case, then the whole modern apparatus of regard for Cycladic simplicity is in error. Instead of Modern Masters having arrived at the same aesthetic as the supposed Cycladic Masters, it is simply chance that unfinished Cycladic figures resemble finished 20th-century sculptures. Modern Perceptions of Ancient Cycladic Society We have looked behind the words "Master" and "civilization," and at the upright attitude that Cycladic figures are now required to adopt. Many other words that run through the newer Cycladic literature--enig- matic, inscrutable, hoard, idol, sculptor, art-will on examination be found to bring with them a variety of meanings and nuances that may not be applicable to Cycladic figures in their prehistoric context. Since all words hold meaning beyond their dictio- nary definition, anything whatever that is said about Cycladic figures (or anything else!) will bear nuances. To speak neutrally of them is to be silent. Yet it is inescapable that the vocabulary of Cycladic art to- gether provides a certain atmosphere, perhaps al- 402 Renfrew 1991, 92-94. 403 Chippindale is responsible for Cycladic display in the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology at Cambridge, and he has recently removed its (cast of a) Cycladic figure from its upright perspex stand and laid it flat. 404 Such as the painted Classical cast in the Museum of Classical Archaeology, University of Cambridge.

Here is a sample of the atmosphere created by the style, when some questions of chronology are addressed: "While the earlier part of the second phase was a time of exuberant self- confidence and virtuosity in Cycladic sculpture, to- ward the end of the period the spirit of the times seems to have changed, to judge by the radical differ- ences of iconography and style now seen in the sculp- ture."411 The vocabulary sets the frame of thought. It pre- disposes one to the idea that Cycladic figures might have been idols;412 it predisposes one against other interpretations for which there is equal evidence. Sometimes, the frame of thinking is more explicit, and seems more directly to steer thought in a certain way. Getz-Preziosi subtitles her study of the sculptors "Individual and Tradition in the Third Millennium B.C.," and elsewhere talks of the Cycladic figures as "orphans": "With orphaned Cycladic images, as with orphaned images from other regions, one can never be certain in what context they were used, although the chances are good that it was a sepulchral one."413 Is there not to be heard here an echo of that common choice of the word "individual" in contemporary North American society, a different word carrying different nuances, where in other times and places the words "person" or "people" might have been used? In contemporary Western culture, an orphan is a little soul, lost through misfortune, who cries out to be adopted and given a home; a good home will compensate for what it has already suffered. Does not the word "orphan" carry a similar burden, behind it the fear of losing self, losing the individual, becoming nameless and lost? In these ways we take the figures from their makers in prehistory and bring them into the values and psychologies of our own worldviews. To note the proprietorship of a figure as being in the "Mr. &amp; Mrs. Stanley Marcus Collection of Fertility Figures" at the Dallas Museum of Art414 is to make a statement about their ancient and modern meanings. Art, Aesthetics, and Human Universals A recurrent element in the evocative strain of Cy- cladic literature is an appeal to timeless universals: the figures speak directly to us across the centuries because they share an eternal language for all hu- manity: "With minimal means, they attain an intensity of abstract expression and subtlety of form that, though totally idiosyncratic, have universal appeal."415 This encourages a rhetoric that leaps from islets of the prehistoric Aegean to societies of a very different character. Here is that jump in the annual report of a famous American museum: The fall began auspiciously when John Coney's mon- umental silver punch bowl, acquired through the Theo- dora Wilbour Fund in memory of Charlotte Beebe Wilbour, was placed as a centerpiece of the special ex- hibition of American silver. Coney (1655-1722) was a Boston craftsman who brought Georgian British stan- dards of work in the precious metals to the Colonies. His bowl is the forerunner in size and simplicity of what Paul Revere was to create decades later in the eighteenth century for the Sons of Liberty in Massachusetts. The Coney bowl's shape compares provocatively with two marble vases of about 2400 B.C., found years ago with two Cycladic idols of elementary form in an early Bronze Age tomb at Marathon on the eastern coast of Attica.416 Why do these things compare? Why is the compar- ison thought provocative? First, one must take full account of the essentials of three-dimensional geom- etry. It is a restricted system; it permits only a certain range and variety of forms. Second, even that range of forms is vastly reduced, for practical purposes, by the physical constraints on the form of the artifact that follow from simple requirements of function, by the physical properties of the materials of which it is made, and by the functional requirements of a human user. A bowl or vase made of silver or of marble that is to work well is likely to be held within a narrow vocabulary of forms. It does not follow that there is any close link of character or of spirit between the maker of the one and the maker of the other. A similarity of form does not make the Israel Museum Master into the twin of Brancusi. And because time has direction, the similarity of the Cycladic to the Brancusi is not to be equated with the similarity of the Brancusi to the Cycladic. Esteem for Cycladic art is one of many examples of a broadening of aesthetic tolerances among the con- noisseurs of this century. With that broadening of aesthetic tolerances there needs to go a matching recognition that there is no simple and close coupling between art of a first-class quality, as we choose now to perceive it, and the virtue of the society that made it.

GILL AND CHRISTOPHER CHIPPINDALE [AJA 97 be a violent, deranged person. The society of the prehistoric Cycladic figure makers was the world of subsistence fisher-farmers on marginal little islands; they were none of them people exactly like us. Yet Dolly Goulandris, greatest of Cycladic collec- tors, explains the genesis of her collection in terms of the immediacy with which she can comprehend Cy- cladic art: "Slowly we started buying Cycladic art and we got fascinated with it. It became a passion for us. First, because they are so simple and so abstract, and so close to modern art that we did not need any special knowledge for it. We could appreciate immediately what they stood for. And each one is different and each has its own special appeal."'417 Time has now chosen to give a curious twist to these ideas of timelessness. The "Modern movement" of the early decades of the century itself has become a historical phenomenon. Modernist buildings have be- come period pieces, the masters of Modernist archi- tecture are out of fashion, and a Postmodern archi- tecture follows other values. The same goes for the sculptures of Brancusi and Modigliani and Moore, although the critical view of Modernist sculpture is kinder in the 1990s than it is to Modernist architec- ture. Just as the comparison of Cycladic art with the Modern movement has become more compelling, so has regard for the Modern movement become less compelling; no longer where the best of artists are, it is merely a point where some artists once were. While Modernism respected the eternal verities created by the rule of a form that followed function, Postmod- ernism in the 1980s took to arbitrary games of pas- tiche and play, the breaking of rules, the mixing of different orders, the reviving of any historical style that takes the fancy. The Modernist aesthetic of Getz- Preziosi, Renfrew, and Thimme has set aside the ec- centric, anomalous, and unconforming figures; it has corralled the whitened Cycladic figures that it prefers to revere within a set of austere rules and placed them within a narrow historical trajectory of forms consid- ered acceptable at a given stage of their forward evolution. A Postmodernist view of Cycladica rejoices instead in the garish colors, regrets the clean neatness of the scrubbed white surfaces, celebrates the quirky and the unusual, delights in the breaking of the ca- nonic rules (if such rules existed)--especially if done with a mischievous purpose-and enjoys the knowl- edge that some of them are fakes. CONNOISSEURSHIP AND ARCHAEOLOGY: AN ESSENTIAL ASYMMETRY? The purpose of this paper is to document the con- sequences, material and intellectual, of a recent rising regard for Cycladic figures as objects for the connois- seur's zeal. In closing, however, it is right to identify a fundamental asymmetry in the consequences for the object, and for our knowledge of it, between the archaeological and the connoisseur's view. For the connoisseur, the value of the object largely resides in the thing itself; a knowledge of context is a useful accessory to that knowledge, in telling of its background and in reassuring that the object is not a fake. Nothing fundamentally differs between a Cy- cladic figure recovered in a controlled archaeological excavation and a Cycladic figure that "surfaces" in Switzerland. From the archaeological viewpoint, the information immanent in the object itself is one element of a larger story, the rest of which resides in a knowledge of context. The material consequences of the connois- seur's esteem, as we have been able to document them, are calamitous to the archaeological interest, because they have led to so many Cycladic figures being taken out of context that many roads to a secure knowledge of the prehistoric Cyclades, as once available in the archaeology of these figures, have been closed. More- over, it is impossible for the words and ideas in which a modern esteem for Cycladic figures is commonly expressed not to be cast back to divert and to cloud our grasp of the realities of human life on the Cycladic islands, of which the secure evidence of figures and their contexts is so great a part. It is evident how great are the intellectual conse- quences that follow from the material consequences of esteem for Cycladic figures. Bereft of secure find- spot, context, associated objects, or date, they have only been made intellectual sense of by abstract frame- works of idealized canons and wished-for Masters in imagined studios. Yet intellectual consequences in turn create the material consequences. It is because the intellectual framework of Cycladic study so much depends on characteristics of the figure itself that each new example that "surfaces" without trace is regarded as of value, with just a passing aside or footnote to notice its lack of history. As the material creates the intellectual, so does the intellectual create the mate- rial. 417 FLOM.</page><page sequence="59">1993] CONSEQUENCES OF ESTEEM FOR CYCLADIC FIGURES 659 We close by reprinting the catalogue entry for a recent sale of a Cycladic figure, Christie's, New York, 15 December 1992, lot 6, which epitomizes the inter- actions among collector, market-maker, and scholar: S 6 A LARGE CYCLADIC MARBLE RECLINING FEMALE FIGUREa SPEDOS VARIETY,b EARLY BRONZE AGE II, CIRCA 2500 B.C. With lyre-shaped head, a long nose in relief, a shallow chin, the broad neck with incised grooves at the join to the torso, sloping shoulders, the breasts small, the arms folded right below left, with the right extending to the left elbow, fingers and wrists indicated by incised lines, the waist narrow, with a horizontal groove across the abdomen, the pubic area defined by an incised "V", a deep cleft separating the legs, the knees slightly indented, the feet angled downward with deeply incised toes, the spine indicated by a vertical groove, and with a horizontal buttock line--21 in. (52.5cm.) high PROVENANCEc Mathias Komor, "From an English private collection. The previous owner obtained it shortly after the end of World War II while stationed on one of the Cycladic Isles." In personal correspondence between Dr. Getz-Preziosid and Mrs. Rodgers shortly before her death, the present figure was identified as the work of an accomplished sculptor with an individual style, by the same hand as a figure in the Goulandris collection and another from a private collection. It was suggested that this anonymous sculptor be called the Rodgers Master,e as this example was pivotal in linking the three sculptures to the same hand. For the Goulandris figure,f see no. 173 in Doumas, Cy- cladic Art, Ancient Sculpture and Pottery from the N. P.

The accompanying two color photographs do not depict the figure as reclin- ing. It is fixed by an acrylic and metal mount to stand upright. Where the text follows a flattering phrase, the picture follows a flattering pose-even though the two flattering accounts contradict each other. bVariety after Renfrew's classification.

Although the names are particular to contemporary views of Cycladic art, this catalogue entry follows the spirit of a fruitful three-way marriage of connoisseur, market-maker, and scholar that has been a common- place of Classical archaeology since its beginning. The issues explored in this paper document how this old alliance is coming under strain as the interests and motives of the three partners have become distinct.
