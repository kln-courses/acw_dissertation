<plain_text><page sequence="1">JUDAH HALEVI AS PHILOSOPHER By ISIDORE EPSTEIN, Jews' College, London THE human mind in its approach to religion has invari- ably followed two distinct paths: The one taken by Philo- sophical Theology with intellect as its weapon; the other by the Philosophy of Religion with Revelation as its basis. The method of Philosophical Theology has been to direct attention to the manifestations of beauty and order that pervade the world of phenomena and that point to the existence of a Supreme Being sustaining and upholding the universe, arranging and adapting its myriad of forms into one harmonious whole. The contemplation of the majestic glory of the starry heavens and the mysterious workings of nature reveal the handiwork of a Great Author, the essential truths concerning whom, it is held, can be appre- hended by the mere faculty of the human intellect and by the exercise of the powers of reason. But on the other hand there is the Religious Philosophy that distrusts entirely reason and so far as it philosophizes proposes to erect religious faith on philosophical scepticism. The attitude adopted is that the human intellect is inade- quate for penetrating at the ultimate heart of things, and that unaided reason can only serve to discover that God is unknown and unknowable. The latter method of approach relies in its religious quest on historical and experimental data which have borne witness to a close relationship between man and the Divine and falls back on Revelation, the experience of an individual or a people, for all knowledge about God and human destiny.

Paterson, The Nature of Religion, pp. 13-20. 201</page><page sequence="2">202 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW It is commonly maintained that Judah Halevi belongs to the latter class of religious philosophers who decry all attempts of the intellect to discover anything positive in matters of religion. He is described, for instance, by Kaufmania as having in reality banished speculation com- pletely from the domain of religion and denied philosophers the right to affirm or negate anything in regard to God. For Guttmann,2 Halevi is in a sense the forerunner of Jacobi whose Gefiihlsphilosophie, summed up in his declara- tion that "a God who could be proved would be no God," has its counterpart in Halevi's statement that for man to grasp the true nature of God would imply a defect in Him.3 Wolfson presses Halevi's scepticism in regard to philosophy to a further extreme. He holds that Halevi in his distrust of human reasoning does not accept the argu- ment of design. "Harmony and beauty and unity," he writes (basing himself on a passage which, as it will be shown anon, he misunderstood), "need no explanation. They are self-explanatory. For they contain nothing problematical."4 As over against such views, Neumarks swings to the other extreme. After marshaling a number of passages which unmistakably prove that Halevi, far from being antagonistic to philosophers and their specula- tions, had rather a high regard for them, and their activities and contributions to religious thought, he insists that Halevi is an adherent of an eternal hylic6 principle which in its potential being is self-sufficient and independent of God; and he thus proceeds to construct Halevi's meta- Ia D.

Such sharp divergence of opinion justifies the examination of the problem anew. The key to the understanding of Judah Halevi's attitude to the problem thus raised is provided by the title which appears in the Arabic original of his masterpiece, Al Khazari. It is A Book of Argument and Demonstration in Aid of the Despised Faith.7 This designation clearly indi- cates the aim and purpose of the work. It is not intended as a humble apology or a defense of Judaism in the face of the attacks of a rational philosophy. Its object is to demonstrate the transcendent excellency of the truth of the Jewish religion over and above that of other religions- Christianity and Mohammedanism. Not that general philosophical problems affecting the whole spirit of religion are ignored. Equipped as he was with the full scientific apparatus of his age, its theory of knowledge and its specu- lative researches in the nature of God and the human soul, he could not but seek to apply this equipment for the enforcing of a point and affirming of an opinion. However at bottom he is not concerned with philosophy, but with Judaism. He is not merely interested in a theory of the world considered in a theistic aspect, but in religion. The "plot," round which the dialogue between the Sage and the King running through the book is woven and on which the whole Kuzari is reared, serves only to strengthen this assumption. The King of the Khazars who comes to the Jewish Sage for help is evidently a deeply religious person. He may be, nay, he is, an idolater, but he is far 7 I,'-5 1 "lr n '9 'L5aID nlnm m Sn.

On the contrary he holds a firm belief in a future state and in the communing during this life between God and man. He has a dream that perplexes his mind and troubles his soul. "Thy intentions," he is told by an angel who appeared to him, "are pleasing to God, but not thy actions."8 It is a kind of dream that can obviously affect only a tender soul, alive to the sense of God and duty, with a deep abiding faith in a Personal Providence who can be pleased or displeased with human actions and endeavors; and his devout mind is thus disturbed with the thought that the religion in which he had been nurtured and which he had practiced hitherto was not after all the true religion pleasing to God. In his perplexity he turns to the Philosopher. This one, however, opposes to his religious outlook the philosophic attitude that denies in a most radical manner the fundamentals of all religion. There is no Providence, no Omniscience, no Immortality, and thus no room for religious devotions, worship and prayer. No wonder that the King finds little comfort in the words of the philosopher. "Thy words," is the King's rejoinder, "are convincing, yet they do not correspond to what I wish to find. I know already that my soul is pure and that my actions are calculated to gain the favor of God. To all this I receive the answer that this way of action does not find favor, though the intention does!"9 And in his dilemma he applies finally to the representative of Judaism, the Haber. Proceeding from this line of thought, it becomes evident that the task of Halevi, as far as the relations of philosophy 8 , 1. 9 , 2.</page><page sequence="5">JUDAH HALEVI AS PHILOSOPHER-EPSTEIN 205 and religion were concerned, was truly an easy one. He had in fact his interlocutor as an ally in that respect. In other words, he did not feel called upon to defend Judaism against the onslaughts of a critical philosophy that ques- tioned the validity of all religious beliefs, and as such did not constitute a peculiar Jewish problem. Nor was he particularly anxious about the issue, for there were many among other faiths who did battle with all the resources at their disposal for the common cause of religion; much less did he see the necessity of offering a syncretism embracing Judaism and the advanced thought of the day. His was essentially a Jewish problem. Given all the fundamental truths of religion common to Judaism, Mohammedanism and Christianity, was there any means of establishing the supremacy and the truth of the "despised faith," Judaism, as against her two daughter religions? This is the central problem which Halevi set himself to tackle in his Al Khazari, and which forms the point of departure of all arguments on the book. Let us just consider briefly Halevi's answer to the main question, which will enable us to appreciate Halevi's originality as a religious philosopher. What is the test of religious truths?-is the question which forms Halevi's starting-point of his solution. Can the truth or falsity of any particular religion be established by any means, which would in turn make us competent to pronounce one particular religion as the only true religion? Are we to apply philosophic standards and measures to the process? This leads to another question. Is religion reduc- ible to philosophic concepts? Let us just examine the contents of religion. Is it to teach mankind the existence of a God, a Ruler and Organizer of the World? "No," declares Halevi, "this could be known by the mere exercise of</page><page sequence="6">206 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW discursive reason."Io The arguments from order and design, the cosmological and teleological, do establish beyond peradventure the existence of a First Cause upon which the world is dependent; and no intelligent person, save of the Epicurean type, reflecting upon the marvels of existence and the order in nature as described in the grand Psalm 104, will refrain from exclaiming with King David, "How manifold are Thy works, O Lord!"" But however irrefutable these arguments must appear, they still consti- tute a philosophical problem only, and do not touch the fringe of religion. For the teachings of philosophy in regard to the existence of a Being who is the Ultimate Cause of all being do not meet the religious claim. The unique and distinguishing feature of religion is the conception of a close relationship between man and God, a relationship which is personal. The God of philosophy may be proved to be One and Infinite, but the attributes that testify His nearness to man, remain undefined, and flow only from the inspiring fount of living religion. This distinction between the teachings of philosophy and that of religion is, Halevi maintains, clearly denoted in the names of God. The original and positive content of YHWH lies in the relation of God to man rather than His Oneness. God is One. This may be denoted by the term Elohim, signifying the sum total of all forces controlling the universe. But the idea of Oneness does not suffice for religion. In its struggle with polytheism Judaism had to deal not only with o1 IV, 15: nIrDDrnl 1n 6liy W', n-rmo n 'O. It becomes evident that Halevi in declaring: i lpiDn nr '"n (nnp'pn) innr Da,, l,rv n 15 , o (V, 21; see n. 3 above), does not refer to God's existence, but to His essence, His true character and nature. This view, it is instructive to note in this connection, is also shared by Bahya and Ibn Zaddik, see Kaufmann, op. cit., p. 240, n. 232. Halevi is thus not to be compared with Jacobi (s. above, p. 202) whose Gefiihlsphilosophie does not admit the possibility of proving the very existence of a Supreme Being. xI V 8-10.</page><page sequence="7">JUDAH HALEVI AS PHILOSOPHER-EPSTEIN 207 the idea of the plurality of gods. There came also the necessity of supplying a new conception of the Divine Relation to nature and to man as Creator, a conception radically different from that of polytheism that compounded its gods with nature. This new idea was disclosed in the name YHWH, a proper name defining the personal nature and character of God;12 and it is a name which none can invoke except he who enters with Him into a close rela- tionship, "who hears His address, command and prohibition, approval for obedience and reproof for disobedience."'3 And it is this same conception that separates religion from philosophy, which beholds the relation between God and the world as one of cause and effect, and which teaches the existence of an impersonal and undefinable First Cause, who "neither benefits nor injures nor is cognizant of our prayers, offerings, obedience or disobedience,"'4 and who cannot be conceived as possessing the essential attributes as taught by religion, the close and intimate inward pres- ence. The acceptance of such a God is thus purely a question of speculative interest without any value to human life and conduct, without effect on human destiny, and for all practical purpose is as good as non-existent. The denial of the God offered by philosophical speculation is accordingly held by philosophers to be no less harmful than the refusal to consider the earth round, merely a mark of ignorance that delights in untruth;'5 and Halevi, anticipating Kant,'6 rightly maintains that the mere admission of the existence of a First and Supreme Being with a character wholly unknown does not differ from the rejection of all belief in God.

But the adoration of a God imper- vious to human needs and aspirations is but a matter of temperament, a mark of refinement and culture, a trait that delights in all things great and wonderful, and extols God in the same way "as the sun because it is placed on a higher level than other visible things";18 in no case can it however rise to the level of worship and prayer. Nor does philosophy admit in its scheme of thought the conception of the fear or love of God; the veneration which it extends to the Supreme Being is determined by the demands made on the philosopher's love of convenience and ease.'9 Philos- '7 V, 6.

This is the passage in question which Wolfson (see above, n. 4) paraphrases: "If the possibility of change and the creation of new things in nature be not granted, then 'thy opponent and thou might agree that a vine e. g. grew in this place because a seed happens to have fallen here'." Whilst the rendering is accurate, the inference that Halevi does not accept the argument from design is untenable, particularly in view of the explicit statement to the contrary somewhat later, V, 8: "David's allusion in the words 'How great are Thy works, O Lord!' serve to refute Epicurus' view that the universe arose by accident." What Halevi does mean is that once deny the possibility of change and the creation of new things by God, that is, once reduce the universe to fixed inexorable iron laws, shutting out all supernatural, there is no point in attacking the propo- sition that the world has no Creator, as the question of the origin of things is of no value to religious belief except in so far as it leads to the affirmation of an Almighty, and All-powerful Supreme Being, able to create new things and produce changes in the natural order. i8 IV, 15. g IV, 16.</page><page sequence="9">JUDAH HALEVI AS PHILOSOPHER-EPSTEIN 209 ophy moreover refuses to recognize the claim of any single religion to the possessing of the sole truth.20 One religion, in its view, is as good as another; men might follow any creed they fancy. It is all a merry as-you-like-it, a matter of taste, and speculation. This opportunism characteristic of philosophy extends to the domain of its moral judgments. Philosophers, it will be conceded, recommend good living and dissuade from evil, and, further, contrive laws and regulations for human conduct, but these have no binding force and can be superseded at will. Thus it is that philos- ophy even in its loftiest sphere goes no more than this- that law is precept and morality duty, but it cannot create really new values with a compelling force to produce saints and martyrs.21 Nay, even those among philosophers, who have, with the sole help of their reasoning powers, attained sublime religious heights, cannot entirely rid themselves of the taint of scepticism, and lack the certitude which religion alone is capable of yielding.2 The masses moreover distrust philosophy, not merely because they are denied by it the bliss of immortality,23 a gift (in a sense) which philosophy reserves for philosophers, and determined, in its view, by the acquisition of knowledge. They somehow cannot help perceiving that, withal its impressiveness and grace, there is somewhat lacking in the apparent fullness of philosophy that makes its attitude unacceptable to the plain, unsophis- ticated man or woman.24 It becomes clear from all this that philosophy affords no sure basis for the specific teachings of religion. We are thus carried away irresistibly elsewhere in our search for such a basis; and the conclusion borne upon us is that 20 II, 49. 21 IV, 16. 22 IV, 13. 23 I, 10. 24 IV, 17.</page><page sequence="10">210 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW religion has its own source, independent of logic, specula- tion, research and investigation. It offers, that is to say, its own evidences in support of its claims, disclosures through historical happenings of Divine truths and teach- ings-in a word, revelation. This however only serves to aggravate the main question propounded as to what is the test of religious truth. Is it not a fact that each of the higher religions insists on some historical event or events as vital to itself, from which there have proceeded its rule of life and mode of worship? But, argues Halevi, there is always the suspicion in the claim to revelation of subjectivism. Not a few, he states, have conceived out of their inner consciousness a religion and framed laws and said, in all honesty, that the laws emanated from God.25 And thus the problem resolved itself into the more precise one, how can we be sure that the assertion of the various founders of religious systems of having had their teachings and messages communicated immediately from God is not grounded after all in self-illusion? And the question of all questions is: has God really spoken to them? Some will appeal to the miracles, which religious founders are said to have per- formed, to prove the genuine nature of their mission. But, declares Halevi, apart from the fact that miracles are associated with all religions, they have not the slightest evidential value, except to impress the credulous, as they may be the products of magic.26 Something more than the mere miraculous must be adduced to substantiate the claim to Divine revelation. And the only religion that holds such credentials is Judaism. For the revelation of Israel's faith was not vouchsafed to a single individual, but to a whole nation. The revelation at Sinai was an experience 25 1,87: 'ramtHN t Wmn r1,n= yWim ily -im n '- 't ... i nn,tw -tW91 iDy i1=i bil1nn ' IDCD' t1i ...inr' mlDl. 26 I, 8: wDwzts it? Irn -rw T.</page><page sequence="11">JUDAH HALEVI AS PHILOSOPHER-EPSTEIN 211 that penetrated the consciousness of a whole people; but if an individual may be subject to delusion, it is another thing to say that the collective consciousness of a myriad- souled people, among whom there were, as Halevi is careful to point out, not a few scoffers and unbelievers, was subject to the same self-delusion and self-hallucination.27 The Sinaitic revelation accordingly becomes for Halevi the only unassailable foundation and fount of all religious truth, and in turn the unrivaled guarantee for the supremacy of the truth of Israel's faith as over and against that of others. Having established revelation as the basis of all religion, a basis which should compel religionists, if not sceptical philosophy, to accord first place to Judaism, Halevi seeks to explain the relation of revelation to philosophy. On this he is quite explicit. Although, he states, the teachings of revealed religion do not fall within the domain of philos- ophy, yet neither they nor the conception of revelation itself do violence to reason. On the contrary, they include human reason, which they transcend. "Heaven forfend!" he exclaims, "that the Torah should admit aught which reason rejects."28 Surely God who is Reason29 itself could not act irrationally; nor dare the true servant of God, the ideal Hasid, craving after perfection and Divine nearness neglect reason as an important constituent of his mental and spiritual make-up. Reason is, indeed, no mean rung in the ladder leading up to God.30 It occupies the first place in our daily supplications, when we recite "Thou grantest knowledge to man"; and follow this up by "He who takes delight in repentance," thus praying to be 27 I, 87. See IV, 3, where Halevi regards the harmony and agreement among all the prophets as being the best proof that they were not victims of self-illusion. 28 I, 89; cf. I, 67. 29 V, 20. 30 III, 5.</page><page sequence="12">212 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW brought nearer to God by means of "wisdom," "knowledge" and "intelligence."31 Yet withal the undoubted potency of reason, it cannot be made by itself the measure of all human knowledge. For all knowledge comes to us by means of sense data. It originates in perception and sensation. But the senses can perceive only the particular and outward form of an object; and it is reason abstracting the testimony afforded by the senses that deduces the real nature of the sensory object. The sense of sight, for instance, perceives a king; namely, his external and visible figure and propor- tions. He is seen clad in one uniform in peace, in another in war; in the city in one, in his palace in another. But surely it is not to these external paraphernalia, that are so easily divested, that homage is paid. These serve how- ever as means whereby our knowledge as to the bearer's kingship can come to us; and it is reason utilizing the data supplied by the senses which determines our final judgment in regard to the true nature of the king as a rational and intellectual being who rules and gives commands. But the very fact that our knowledge is mixed up with the senses circumscribes the limits of our knowledge, and affects prejudicially the working of reason.32 Thus it is that human reason, although it serves as a useful canon in rejecting what is totally inadmissible, cannot be considered a cri- terion in religious matters. It is only with the elect souls, dowered with a clear vision, an "inner eye", untrammeled by the influence of the senses, that reason is competent to apprehend the things of the spirit in their true light and nature. It is true that even those who are gifted with 31 III, 19. 32 IV, 3. Cf. also III, 49, where he shows that imagination and "opinion" are no criteria of truths, as these very often contradict discursive reasoning; and he instances the sun which the ordinary man thinks it is against reason that it should be larger than the earth, but this proposition is reasonable to the learned.</page><page sequence="13">JUDAH HALEVI AS PHILOSOPHER-EPSTEIN 213 that inner eye cannot divorce themselves entirely from the imaginative faculty that presents to their mind grand and awful sights, bringing them in touch with things of the intelligible world and revealing to them unmistakable Divine truths, but these are entirely under the control of the intellect.33 This relation of religion to reason necessitates a rational basis on which religion can rear itself; and Halevi accordingly formulates five principles as a rational approach to religion and in regard to which research is to be commended.34 1. The existence of a Prime Cause whose wisdom is revealed from the contemplation of the marvels of creation. 2. The existence of intermediary causes or natural laws through which God operates, plans and purposes all things; the causes however are not self-agents but merely means of Divine activity. 3. Divine wisdom is revealed in all creatures, great and small; in the gnat no less than in the higher things in existence. 4. The existence of beings of higher and lower ranks in the scale of existence, the mineral, the vegetable, the animal and man, each of which being possessed of faculties corresponding with the rank it occupies. The higher the rank, the nobler the faculty. Man endowed with reason is the noblest of all, since his reason makes him most akin to the Prime Cause who is Reason itself. And the nearer man approaches God through following the Divine law the higher is the place he attains. 5. Reproof has the effect of enkindling a spark in the human soul, enabling him to become conscious of his shortcomings, and thereby stimulating him to virtue. 33 Ibid. 34 V, 20-1.</page><page sequence="14">214 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW 6. Free-will: the power to do good and to avoid evil. In the principles outlined above we have presented Halevi's philosophical basis of religion. It involves the acceptance of the argument from design, but it is richer than a mere intellectual pursuit. Its scope is enlarged by the inclusion of moral and religious values from which metaphysics in the system of Halevi cannot be separated. This distinguishes his principles from the ten axioms of the Kalam,35 which he criticizes as mere unprofitable dialectics.36 Nor does the problem of relation, that is, God's relation with matter, which exercised so much the mind of the Kalam philosophers, enter into his consideration. Whether or not the world was created out of nothing is, in his view, irrelevant to religion. He boldly declares: "Should, after all, a believer in the Torah feel compelled to admit an eternal hylic matter . . .this would not injure his belief that this world was created a certain time ago."37 Religion's great concern is the recognition of God as the Ultimate fact of existence and bringing this fact into closest connec- tion with life. It is true the existence of intermediary causes-natural forces-is recognized, and the acceptance thereof constitutes as we have seen the second of the five 35 V, 18. 36 V, 16: irn:n n-lnn nirl nmyin nr: 1,H. 37 , 67: b7 ... plp. . m inn mn l' n min y: 'l'Do nmn I inmD: m D" : rarn'. Neumark, op. cit., p. 241, basing himself on the Arabic original, q'8 for the Hebrew, l-Drn, concludes that Halevi is an adherent of an hylic eternal matter (see above, p. 202). Granting, as he states, "the believer cannot be 'compelled' by other means than logical ones," it does not follow however that the means appeared to Halevi logical. The other passage which he appeals to in support (IV, 25) does ndt speak of an eternal hyle, hfi,'rp ,'r,n, but of a first matter, 5'iH r,i'D' which does not imply an eternal principle co-existent with and independent of God. The other passages adduced by him in this connection are likewise unconvincing. Abraham Shalom b. Isaac in his Neveh Shalom, p. 26b, Venice, 1575, has certainly a right understanding of Halevi when he writes: wnl1m 1D "n' nnt ' v '131 n3lrHl rrcA '89w "W ... ."Dp.</page><page sequence="15">JUDAH HALEVI AS PHILOSOPHER-EPSTEIN 215 principles formulated by Halevi. But it is God who is over and above them all and whose activity, which he designates as the mLk 13y,38s is discerned in a different measure and degree through their agency. Along the normal level of existence, natural to the four classes of beings, the mineral, the plant, animal and man, the mnl 1]3Y operates through the mediacy of the natural forces. He, however, who is in perfect fellowship with God, brings himself directly under the activity of the Divine and breaks through the bounds of the natural forces that hem all other classes of beings. He comes, in other words, under influences that are not contrary to those controlling the laws of nature, but such as are produced in nature by intensified spiritual power. Thus there is room left for direct Divine operation in the course of history, and for man's spiritual regeneration, through repentance and good living, and his enjoyment even in this life of the nearness of God-a greater bliss than which even immortality, Halevi declares, cannot bring.39 Halevi's conception of the ,mrn 14y governing the whole warp and woof of existence, from the highest to the lowest, constitutes one of the most characteristic and original achievements of his way of thinking, and is basic to his philosophical approach to religion in general and to Judaism in particular. With it, he counters the arguments of the rationalism or naturalism that would limit unduly Divine activity in the universe. Granted, Halevi argues, all phenomena in the spiritual as well as in the corporeal world are traceable to natural laws, physical and psycho- logical. But are these natural laws self-sufficient to explain 38 On the term irnt lpY, applied to all the forms of natural class of beings, the mineral, the vegetative, and the animal, as well as to that of man, see Neumark, op. cit., pp. 267 ff. 39 I 103, 109; III, 20.</page><page sequence="16">216 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW everything that happens in the world of matter and mind? Let us see, he asks, what is nature? Can we ascribe to it the qualities of wisdom and intelligence, with power of determining and purposing, so that it could be considered more than a function? Or is it not more true to assume that it is nothing but the manifestation of the activity of the All-wise and Almighty, from whom everything that is ultimate, fundamental, and mysterious, defying any explan- ation through natural science proceeds? Away therefore with all dualism that would set nature over against God! All that occurs in nature is ultimately the work of God. There is no clear cut distinction between nature and the supernatural. All is conceived as being in one continuous order. There is nothing absolutely natural. The whole creation is embraced by the unceasing and unfailing, ever- active and ever-sustaining m%S 13Y. The fact, for instance, that the child has come into being through father and mother, as part of the natural order, does not at all imply that God Himself did not create and endow it with life. We should thus look no longer for God in that which is exceptional and miraculous only, but rather learn to refer everyday course of events to Divine causality and regard the most trivial matter as part of the Divine ordering.40 Nor is there anything absolutely supernatural. It is all a question of the degree of correspondence between the being and the Divine activity, a degree which in turn is determined by the receptive powers of the being. Just as the rays of the sun, to mention the simile employed by Halevi in this connection, are reflected in varying intensity and character according to the nature of the bodies receiving its light, so is the extent of the manifestations of the 1"Y ,mS dependent on the disposition of being.41 Thus is 40 I, 71-7. 41 IV, 15.</page><page sequence="17">JUDAH HALEVI AS PHILOSOPHER-EPSTEIN 217 offered a solution to the greatest problem which revealed religion, implying as it does that God has spoken to man, presents to the rational mind. Halevi did not underrate the difficulty involved in the acceptance of revelation as the sole basis of religion, and as defense of the primacy of the "despised faith." So incredible, indeed, has this funda- mental belief appeared at all times, he writes, that when Moses brought first the Divine message to the people, announcing their impending deliverance, they refused to give him credence, because they could not conceive the possibility of God disclosing His will to man.42 And whilst their subsequent experience at the foot of Sinai served to silence all scepticism and quiet all doubt, the apparent violence it does to reason makes revelation problematic even for the adherent to the Torah, which in accordance with Halevi's dictum cannot include anything which reason rejects. "How has the great conviction become fixed in the mind that the Creator of body and mind and soul, and intellect and angels-He who is too holy and exalted high for the mind still less for the senses-that He holds intercourse with this creature (man) low and contemptible in matter, although wonderful in form"43 are the words in which Halevi expresses the strain which the implications of revelation impose on the human intellect. Given however the conception of the rmn 1'3Y, that relates the world to the spirit and the spirit to the world, and which is the eternal groundwork of all that is and exists, and all the arguments against the possibility of the intense display of spiritual powers within nature itself vanishes into nothingness. "Deem it not, therefore, improbable," states Halevi, "that exalted Divine traces should become 42 I, 49; cf. also I, 89. 43 I, 68.</page><page sequence="18">218 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW visible in this material world, when the matter is prepared to receive them."44 The secret of provoking this intense manifestation of the m6n 1'3Y, Halevi continues, does not however lie within the power of natural man to discover; even as God alone holds the secret of the final process that imparts the function particular to each class of beings. And just as science will battle in vain to wrest out from existence the mysterious principle of life, so it is beyond man to determine the ways and means whereby this Divine disclosure can be realized, bringing with it the awareness and enjoyment of the nearness of God. For this end one has to seek illumination from above, a revelation which bestows a new power not shared by other human beings. And the only people to whom this heavenly illumination has been vouchsafed is Israel; and the only place fitting for the reception thereof is the Land of Israel. Israel has by reason of heredity and nature been the specially favored nation upon whom the mrn 1l'Y can become attached directly; and the land of Israel, "the air of which makes wise," is especially distinguished by reason of its character and climate to have become the center of intense manifes- tation of the m p1'Y. This does not exclude the possibility of other peoples and other lands having shared that supreme gift. But whilst to others it came casually and accidentally; to Israel and Israel's land it came naturally and intimately. The question why it has not been bestowed equally on all men and all peoples becomes identical with the more general problem why men everywhere and at all times are not equally favored with other good gifts, or, as Halevi puts it, with the question which a worm can ask: "Why didst Thou not create me a human being."4s But such 44 I, 77. 45 V, 20; cf. I, 103.</page><page sequence="19">JUDAH HALEVI AS PHILOSOPHER-EPSTEIN 219 questions admit of no solution, except that "the difference of things is the outcome of their substances according to the disposition of the Creator." Israel thus becomes the people of Revelation, the people to whom there has been a disclosure of the means whereby the requisite immediate correspondence with the m%m 1"'Y can be effected. These means run in the direction of thought, and in the direction of action. The recognition of God's Sovereignty, His Eternity, His Providence, and His Revelation-are the four articles constituting the high fruits of Israel's faith.46 They all answer the test of reason.47 Admitted that the existence of evil in the world produces difficulties in accepting Providence, the preponderating existence of good, rendering as it does the difficulties in- volved in the denial of this teaching far greater than those that might be occasioned by the assent thereto, points to a Providence.48 The attestation of history, however, which the Exodus particularly furnishes, confirms this belief beyond the peradventure of a doubt. All right thought, however, proceeds from Revelation as embodied in the Torah. Based as it is on reason, it becomes a source of theoretical knowledge, and thus offers guidance and enlightenment on disputed problems of philosophy. The question of Creation is a case in point. Philosophers cannot escape the dilemma with which the problem con- fronts them. The difficulties are immense either way. But with the teachings of Revelation, reason will endeavor to produce plausible arguments that will confirm the truth of Genesis. Even Aristotle, had he an incontestable tradition in regard to this question, would have acted likewise 46 III, 17: n'rnl;l 'inpp i1w, nn iv n ni'pn. See Kaufmann, JQR, I (1888), pp. 441-2.

One has only to think of the anxiety of all his predecessors, Saadia among others, to supply demonstrative proofs for the beginning of the world in time to realize that Halevi's declaration, that all arguments in this connection are unconvincing, and that apart from the teachings of Revelation, the problem of the beginning of things belongs to the realm of the unknowable,' was indeed a distinct advance in religious thought. Theoretical knowledge, although a product of Revelation, is nevertheless, in the view of Halevi, only secondary to right action and religious life and conduct. To love God, to trust and serve Him with the whole heart and soul is more important than to know Him. He even regards anthropomorphic conceptions, such as are to be found in the esoteric work Shiur Komah, of inestimable value as a road along which the devout mind can travel from super- stitions to real facts.50 Such perfect love and trust can find expression only in obedience to the revealed laws and precepts. These regulate all human actions, religious and social, and embrace all the activities in the life of a son of Israel. The reason of these laws may not be always appar- ent, yet the place of reason must be recognized even here. On this Halevi is insistent.5' The fact that the rational, i.e., the moral and ethical laws are assigned preference, "naturally and in point of time," and are considered indispensable for righteous and religious living, clearly indicates that none of the laws of the Torah are opposed to 49 I, 65. so IV, 3. 5s III, 4, 7; II, 48; cf. III, 47.</page><page sequence="21">JUDAH HALEVI AS PHILOSOPHER-EPSTEIN 221 reason.52 Their supreme aim and purpose is to enable the devotee to realize God in his life, so as to become worthy of the highest good and blessing which religion can bestow on man. The due observance of them establishes a close relationship between God and man, and secures for man the possessions of the highest blessings and the participation of life eternal. How this perfected bliss can be accomplished by the exercise of religious duties must elude all human research and investigation, even as man can never discover the final process that imparts function to the least particle of matter; yet no one will on that account maintain that the groundwork of the world of matter is irrational. Thus it is that there is nothing arbitrary in the commands of the Torah; all has been determined by the Infinite Wisdom of the Creator, and there is a reason for everything He has ordained.53 The primacy of place which Halevi assigns to the love of God rather than the knowledge of Him is really what distinguishes him from Maimonides with whom he is being generally compared and contrasted. Husik, who fairly represents the views held in this connection, writes: "Judah Halevi agrees with the other Jewish philosophers that true reason cannot be controverted. He differs with them in the concrete application of this abstract principle. He has not the same respect as Maimonides for the actual achievement of unaided human reason and an infinitely greater respect for the traditional beliefs of Judaism and the biblical expressions taken in their obvious meaning. Hence he does not feel the same necessity as Maimonides to twist the meaning of scriptural passages to make them 52 II, 48; cf. the same idea in practically the same words in Bahya's nu'pn to his nl::n nlin. S3 Cf. III, 11.</page><page sequence="22">222 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW agree with philosophical theories."54 Wolfson, in his pene- trating essay on Maimonides and Halevi, expresses the same opinion: Maimonides is a rationalist, Halevi an empiricist. Maimonides subordinates everything to reason which for him is alone the master of man. Halevi too serves only one master, but he recognizes and regards the other."55 Such summing up however contains an inexact thought and does an injustice alike to Maimonides' faith and to Halevi's rationalism. The limitations of the human intellect for grasping certain objects is the theme to which Maimonides devotes a whole chapter in his Guide,56 and recurring throughout his works. Nor does he subordinate everything to reason when he declares that no demonstrative proof in the world would make him accept the eternity of the universe in the Aristotelian sense, having regard to the teachings of his faith.57 Likewise Halevi, in his treatment of the attributes of God and his explanation of anthropo- morphic expressions in the Bible,s8 shows that he too was capable of "twisting," to use Husik's phrase, the meaning of scriptural passages and of applying philosophic judg- ments to spiritual realities. It thus becomes evident that so far as the relation of reason and religion is concerned, Maimonides and Halevi were on common ground. Halevi did not dethrone reason from its rightful position, nor did Maimonides make reason the mistress. For both religion, and religion alone, was the final arbiter. The prominence which one gives to reason and the other to religion is merely due to the difference in aim and scope of their respective 54 I.

The real and distinguishing point of divergence between Halevi and Maimonides is centered in the problem of the highest good which religion promises to man, and for which this life is but a preparation and discipline. The question -what is the end of man?-is one that has never ceased to engage the mind of all thinkers throughout the ages. This has been invariably answered by one word "happi- ness," meaning the attainment of the summum bonum. This evidently does not take us far, as the nature of the summum bonum, the highest good, has so far been left undefined. It has however been the persistent and most prominent claim of religion that man can find his highest good only in God, and that this can be won and kept through its instrumentality. But here again there has been difference of opinion as to the content of the highest good which religion holds out. In what does it consist? And Halevi and Maimonides are clearly representatives of two distinct attitudes. Maimonides, following Aristotle who holds that the end of man is the perfection of his specific form, his intellect, considers intellectual knowledge, the knowledge of God and the contemplation of Divine things to be the condition of attaining the blessings which religion assures. Such knowledge is in itself a possession of immense value, bringing happiness on earth and a perfected happiness in the hereafter. Halevi on the other hand, whilst prizing knowledge and contemplation as a means, does not regard it as indispensable for the attainment of the highest good. The secret of the happiness and perfection of man lies in the love of God, expressed through worship, service, loyalty</page><page sequence="24">224 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW and obedience to the laws which Divine wisdom has thought best to ordain.59 These two estimates of the last end of man, not whether religion is grounded in reason or in faith, constitute the distinctive principles which stretch them- selves across the Guide and the Kuzari, and which give direction to the positions taken up respectively by Mai- monides and Halevi in their treatment of a number of prob- lems of the Jewish religion. This indeed is a subject that could be discussed at greater length. But for our purpose one illustration will suffice, the conception of the laws of the Torah. Maimonides, regarding the whole matter from the standpoint of theoretical knowledge, sums up the primary purpose of the Laws as educative. They are designed to infuse right knowledge, to inculcate truth, and correct error. The mere practice of the Laws, whether ethical or ritual, without a proper understanding of their reason, does not conduce to the highest perfection. Hence the endeavor of Maimonides to explain rationally the signification of the Commandments. Halevi, taking love as the main center of gravity and of human aspirations, whilst not disputing the educative influence of the precepts, nor the value of accounting, as he himself attempts now and then, for the reason of them,60 considers theoretical knowledge as secondary and preparative. The real goal of the Laws is God and His love, and the Laws themselves are looked upon as channels of communion and worship, with a positive power of inspiring and deepening the love of man for his Creator, realizing thereby for himself his true and final end, which imparts the sole and absolute value to his being and existence. Divine love, which makes us undeviatingly desire our last end, constitutes for Halevi the very bond of human 59 See II, 2-4; IV, 1-3, 16-7. Cf. also Crescas' Or Adon., II, 6; 1. 60 1, 115; II. 26; III, 11.</page><page sequence="25">JUDAH HALEVI AS PHILOSOPHER-EPSTEIN 225 perfection. It occupies the pride of place over the whole of our individual and social life. The distress of the modern world derives from the fact that man in his cultural advance- ment and scientific achievements has begun to regard himself as self-sufficient and is losing all sense of an abso- lute value, of an ultimate end to which all other ends are subordinated-the sense of eternity. Science has become, as Bertrand Russell has reminded us recently in his work, The Scientific Outlook, the pursuit of power; and its goal is not knowledge for its own sake, nor for the sake of love or contemplation, but for the sake of exploitation, condemning humanity to a life of tyranny, cruelty, to something joyless, without beauty, without love. There may appear an exaggeration in this prognosis; but a science divorced from conscience must inevitably lead down to these gloomy depths. Truly in the words of our sages "Condemned is the dough, the condemnation of which is proclaimed by its baker" (Gen. Rab. 8.21). Thinkers and philosophers realizing the terrible prospect created by modern thought, grope for an ideal, but without success. The world at large, sick at heart, vainly endeavors to satisfy its spiritual hunger on the husks of discredited philosophies and decadent perversions of religion. Human- ity for its salvation must go back to the resilient and sparkling spring, from which Halevi had drunk so deeply, which makes a life with God the ground for all reality. His scientific equipment may be discarded, the thought-forms of his philosophy may be antiquated, but his metaphysical and religious outlook has lost none of its freshness, effective- ness and vigor, and holds out a message for mankind generally, and for the Jew in particular even to this day.</page></plain_text>
