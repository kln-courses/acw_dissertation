THROUGHOUT the recent discussions on the priority of causes to their effects' there has been much emphasis on causal ' effectiveness ' ; and by no one has the conceptually central position of this effectiveness been stressed more strongly than by Professor A. G. N. Flew. Thus he talks of Mr. Michael Scriven's ' mistake' of insisting " on talking misleadingly of causation where he has subtracted an essential part, the idea of effectiveness, from the meaning of' cause' " ;2 he speaks of " the fact that causes are and must be (even if in practice unpullable) levers " and quotes with approval Professor Toulmin's description of the investigation of causes as an investigation of " what in the antecedents God or man would need to manipulate in order to alter the spot-lighted event " ;3 " causes ", he maintains, " bring about their effects "4 and it is he, not I, who has underlined the words ' bring about '. Yet in spite of this, in other contexts, in contexts where he is concerned to show that there is no necessary incompatibility between deter- minism and free will, he has familiar recourse to what Mr. B. A. 0. Williams has recently called " the fashionable anodynes of prescription v. description and constraint v. cause " ;5 " determinism only commits us to saying that 1 See in particular the symposium by Mr. A. E. Dummett and Professor A. G. N. Flew on " Can an effect precede its cause?

It is not even relevant ... "56 For the sake of one argument causes are levers which ' bring about ' their effects ; for the sake of another, to show the cause of an event is to show how it might have been predicted, and predictions, notoriously, in general neither compel nor constrain. Whatever else may be uncertain about this situation, one thing at least seems tolerably clear ; Flew cannot easily have it both ways at once. Nor, of course, can anybody else. For though I have picked upon Flew for the sake of bringing this conflict squarely into the open, he is far from being alone in his uses of the two arguments in question, (a) that causes bring things about but (b) that they do not compel. And this indeed, the fact that there is a conflict, is the main point on which I wish here to insist. As to what exactly is to be said next I feel considerably less confident. But first determinism. The initial, and probably most formidable, difficulty about determinism is to formulate it in a way that will at one and the same time meet modern standards of precision and satisfy somebody whom it seriously worries that his worry has not been simply reformu- lated away. All sorts of formulations exist, of course. But there are flaws, some of which have been pointed out in a recent article by Professor D. J. O'Connor,7 even in the popular predictability-in-principle version, on which so many people agree with Flew in relying to dispel the apparent incompatibilities between determinism and free will. The fundamental reason why none of these formu- 6 " Crime or Disease ", The British Journal of Sociology, Vol. V. No. 1, March 1954, p. 55. 7 " Determinism and Predictability."

'Modern standards of precision', on the one hand, are almost inextricably bound up with a view of philosophy that in one way or another links the meaning of the different sorts of statement of fact with the observations on the basis of which their truth or falsity might be accepted or disputed observations which have as a matter of fact been made or observations which in appropriate circumstances might be expected or predicted. ' Necessary connexions ' cannot, as Hume pointed out, be observed; 'predictability', how- ever, seems to fit very nicely into the language of the observer or spectator. The language, on the other hand, in which what is probably the most familiar form of the deterministic worry arises, is not that of the spectator at all, but rather that of the agent, in whose language causes are levers that he may try and pull.8 In this language the suspicion that everything may have a cause is a suspicion that everything may be levered into position and not merely preceded by something else, the levers themselves being levered by other levers and so on back to the problematical beginning of the whole process of leverage. The notion of ' lever ' is, of course, no more exact than the language to which it belongs. In a rough and ready way we may say that it is something by which something else can be or is brought about or made to get into position a cause has its effect simply because it is as a lever ' effective'. But at once it is natural to ask how this whole family of notions, 'lever', 'effectiveness ' and the rest, might be made more precise ; and to interpret this request as being for something more than an account of their mutual relation- ships. But what more can this be ? If what is wanted are the precise observational requirements for a definite decision whether something is a causal lever or not-or, in more sophisticated cases, whether a given family of phenomena 8 The paragraph that Flew concludes with the reference I have already quoted to " the fact that causes are and must be (even if in practice unpullable) levers ", begins " Now, it is significant that Hume presents ' cause ' as an observer's not as an experimental enquirer's or an agent's concept: his might irreverently be called a paralytic's eye view." Q2</page><page sequence="4">128 ALAN MONTEFIORE. are definitively describable in terms of the sort of theory in which the outcome of one event may be uniquely deter- mined by the outcome of certain other events-the answer is likely to be that in the last resort such requirements do not exist to be given. However often and under whatever conditions one observes B's following upon A's, one can always ask ' But is B really caused by A or is this just a very extraordinary coincidence? ' ; however well a given theory may work, no series of observations can ever provide the final incorrigible guarantee that it will always go on working. In an agent's language there is an irreducible difference between causes and coincidences, however extraordinary and however many times repeated. In an observer's language, on the other hand, one has the choice between saying that causes as the agent understands them simply do not exist or that coincidences which are extraordinary enough no longer differ from causes. Thus it is also open to the observer first to purge and then by appropriate analysis to absorb into his own language the whole family of terms associated with ' cause ', such as ' lever ' and ' effective ' and ' bring about'. In this way the observer may pay due respect to certain well-established rules of implication or quasi-implication of ordinarily accepted speech, and, perhaps, soothe the doubts of any agent who may have begun to suspect that his language was under attack, by disguising the emptying of its content behind the retention of its form. Of course, terms such as ' necessary connexion ' can only be taken over like this on certain conditions and if certain distinctions are maintained. Thus it is common- place to find (observer-)philosophers insisting that they can admit when they are speaking strictly only one sort of necessity, that which belongs to logic or at any rate to analytic propositions ; ' causal necessity', the relationship between a lever and that which is levered, is expressible only in synthetic propositions and so is really contingent- ' necessity' only by a sort of traditional and paradoxical</page><page sequence="5">DETERMINISM AND CAUSAL ORDER. 129 courtesy. Undoubtedly, the fact that A causes B is one that might have been different in a differently constituted world and which is independent of language in the way, at least, in which an analytic proposition is dependent. But as against this it is also worth remembering that, while it may always be possible that A should after all turn out not to be the cause of B, nevertheless if it in fact is the cause, then B must follow A as a matter of (informal) logical necessity ; for if sometimes it did not, we should no longer talk of A as its cause. This is, obviously, a very crude way of putting the matter and cannot mean that we are not able to say things like " Throwing lighted cigarette stubs about will often cause heath fires ", leaving it clearly understood that 'often' is not 'always' and that what happens may depend on a multitude of other factors as well, some known and many most probably not. In fact, when people try to speak accurately about this sort of situation, they tend to start talking of partial causes and total causes and other such things which may, for a good many reasons, be most unsatis- factory expedients to adopt. But there is no need to explore alternative possibilities here ; for whatever terminology may be preferred, it will satisfy the agent only if it shows sufficient respect for his principle that like causes give rise to like effects, for a lever that will work at one time and not at another, though the relevant circumstances are the same, is hardly a lever at all. How very difficult it is for an observer completely to forget that he is also an agent is shown by the fact that the relationship between ' cause' and ' effect' remains, even when transposed into his language, one of constant or invariable and not merely of exceedingly frequent conjunction.9 In this way, causal necessity retains if not the substance, at any rate some shadow of logical sanction. All this makes for a somewhat peculiar situation. If we are to try once again to provide a formula for determinism within the (apparently) preciser language of the observer, 9 ' Constant conjunctions ' may be paired off with' causes' ; but ' an almost constant conjunction ' is hardly parallel to ' almost bring about '.</page><page sequence="6">130 ALAN MONTEFIORE. the best way of keeping up appearances seems to be to say that if anything has a cause, there is something on which it must necessarily follow, and to add that there is in fact a cause for everything. But whatever sting this may have is at once withdrawn when we explain that the 'must necessarily follow' refers only to what must happen if the term ' cause' is to remain properly applicable. Severely conscientious observers have a natural tendency to nominal- ism. But even if we are prepared, on the other hand, to revise some of our demands for precision, it is clear that we cannot without paradox set out to formulate determinism within the language of a man who thinks of a lever as something that he as an agent might pull. For in the world of determinism there are no genuine agents ; nothing but levers all pulling each other in the one inevitable pattern, the means by which each is made by another to take up its determined position. It begins to look-not, indeed, for the first time nor solely for the reasons that I have been sketching here-that there can be no way of formulating determinism without either emasculating it in the process of precision or plunging into imprecision and paradox. To turn now for a moment to the puzzle of backward causation. It goes without saying that Flew is right to insist that it would be absurd to talk of doing anything that might alter the past, either by adding to or by sub- tracting from it; for to describe any such manipulation would involve saying both that something had happened and that it had not. So certainly it follows that if causes are levers by which we may hope to bring about alterations in things, no effect can appear before its cause. It is equally certain, of course, that if effectiveness were to be left out and causes taken as sufficient conditions interpreted as ' inference tickets', there would be nothing to stop them appearing after the events of which they were the sufficient conditions. The question is whether there is any room for an inter- mediate sense of ' cause ' to be located, perhaps, in the gap between the language used by an agent as a constructor of experiments and the language that -he may use to report</page><page sequence="7">DETERMINISM AND CAUSAL ORDER. 131 his observations once his experiments have been carried out. The favourite example of possible backward causation seems to be precognition. It is in some ways an awkward example to take. There are for one thing the conundrums associated with the distinction between knowledge and belief, and for another the objections to describing even past events as causes of my present knowledge that they have occurred. Still, for present purposes these qualms may be ignored ; precognition or pre-vision, something of this sort will do. In the ordinary non-experimental sort of way, people who claim to be able sometimes, though not always, to foresee the future are not often concerned with such things as a series of tosses of a penny. A more typical claim might be to a vision of somebody's death in certain definite and peculiar circumstances. But not everyone, of course, who claims such second sight, goes on to claim that what he has seen in his vision is bound to take place whatever anyone may do about it ; (and I doubt if any of them suppose that it might be possible, by killing a man for example, to bring about their having had a vision if they had not already had one in the original version of the past.) Indeed, many people believe that the whole point of such a vision is that it should be taken as some sort of warning, whose function is to enable the recipient to prevent the causes, of which his vision may be supposed to be an effect, from ever coming about. Suppose that his precautions succeed. In such a case, their success is unlikely to be taken as proof that the occurrences that he has prevented from taking place could not after all have been among the causes of his earlier warning vision, but rather as the most appropriate way of making use of the alleged causal relationship and the fact that the prior ' effect ' has already taken place. It is clear that if we are to talk of causes at all in this sort of connexion, we must say that what has caused the vision is not the future as it is in fact going to be, but the future as it would be if nobody intervened with preventive causal</page><page sequence="8">132 ALAN MONTEFIORE. action of the ordinary forward-looking type. It is also clear that this sort of future, which, if made the subject of deliberate experimental control, will never take place and so vanish from the experiment, can hardly be used in order to manipulate or to lever anything. Nor could it make a direct appearance in any constantly correlated observations; for the nature of the case is such that whenever the warning has been successfully heeded, there will be no such corre- lation to be observed. The best possible evidence for the validity of such visions would be their correspondence with subsequent events when the warning had not been heeded, and the discovery on other occasions of conditions which almost certainly would have led to the fulfilment of the warning if it had not been taken in time. (To act on a warning is itself, of course, to act in accordance with a fully lever-like sense of ' cause '.) Such evidence would be by no means negligible, but it would naturally be taken as evidence for the causal association rather than as constitutive of its meaning. The man who claims that what he has seen is the future as it will be whether anyone tries to interfere with it or not, is making quite a different sort of claim and has certainly to be more careful in hedging it about. Nobody could prevent the future-as-it-was-going-to-be-if-he-had-not-inter- fered from being as it was going to be if he had not interfered by in fact interfering. The future as it is said to be going to be anyhow is, on the other hand, clearly vulnerable to experimental interference. Consequently, for reasons that Flew and others have explained, this sort of seer can hardly afford to foretell events of a type that are normally open to control. Nevertheless, this restriction would still leave him with a certain amount of scope. He would be unwise to predict somebody's death in too precise a manner or that it will not take place before a certain date, since a ruthless experimenter might always step in and try to kill off the person concerned in some other way before the prediction had time to work itself out. But there remain a number of ways in which he may predict that a man will not die-</page><page sequence="9">DETERMINISM AND CAUSAL ORDER. 133 peacefully and naturally is one that is frequently ruled out; or he may simply say that his death will take place before a certain date. If he fails, he has fewer available excuses than the seer who only reports the future as it would be if nobody interfered ; but as against this his predictions may seem more readily impressive if and when they are successful. I have already agreed that if any causal or quasi-causal relationship were to be said to exist between a vision of the future and the event envisaged, it could not be such as to provide a lever for altering what has already happened. Which is all the more reason, if it is needed, why we could not afford to abandon the rule about like causes' producing like effects. In face of these requirements it might be possible to argue something like this: The future only produces visions of itself, we might not implausibly say, under certain special conditions. (There is nothing peculiar about this. Nearly every causal generalisation-and if formulated in terms of expected observations, every causal generalisation-is protected by some sort of ceteris paribus clause. The lighted cigarette end, carelessly thrown away, often causes a heath fire, but not by any means invariably; it can only be thought of as the sufficient condition of a fire in a context where the other necessary conditions are taken for granted.) Some of these conditions might relate to the nature of the events foreseen, others to the circumstances of the vision itself; the seer, for instance, may have to be in a certain state of undisturbed sensitivity. So anyone who wished to provoke a vision of the future by deliberate experiment, would have to produce at the appropriate different times both an event of a type that might be the subject of visions and whatever conditions of sensitivity and so on were necessary for a vision to occur. The future as it would be if nobody interfered is in any case unavailable as a lever. But even in the case of the future that will be as it will be whatever anyone may do, it could still be that some of the necessary conditions for the occurrence of a vision are for one reason or another impossible to produce at will under perfect experimental control. Once in a while</page><page sequence="10">134 ALAN MONTEFIORE. we may perhaps manage to produce the necessary conditions of sensitivity and the rest, and thanks to some lucky and coincidental shot in the dark actually obtain a vision ; but in doing so we shall have done nothing to alter the past. If, on the other hand, we choose and are able to bring about an event of the type that is the normal subject of visions on an occasion when we know that no previous vision has taken place, the only thing that we shall conclusively have shown will be that, whatever we may have thought, the conditions necessary for a vision of the future could not all on that particular occasion have been present. All this goes to show that though there are a number of indirect checks that can be made on phenomena of the type alleged-investigating possible sources of information other than the future itself, estimating the intrinsic probabilities1O of whatever event is predicted, clarifying or showing that it is impossible adequately to clarify the meaning of the prediction, and so on-though these checks are by no means negligible, yet Flew is unquestionably right in complaining that there is here in principle no possibility of full scale and direct experimental control. If anything in the future ' causes ' anything in the past, it cannot do so in a fully lever-like sense, the sense in which a lever is something that an agent may try and pull to change or control his environ- ment, to realise one practical possibility rather than another. Yet if a ' cause' is, on the other hand, to lose all idea of effectiveness, then the possibility of talking intelligibly about backward causation will seem to have been bought at the price of giving up most of the point of doing so. Insub- stantial clarity as one alternative; incoherence and paradox as the other. This brings us back to where we left the problem of determinism. Determinism, I suggested, is typically the worry of a man who is used to what I have been calling the agent's sense of ' cause '. Yet it is hard to see how an agent, qua agent, can be a determinist at all. His ' cause ', the 10 If I may here be allowed the use of this somewhat debatable phrase.</page><page sequence="11">DETERMINISM AND CAUSAL ORDER. 135 determinist's ' cause ', must be at best some sort of derivative from the full agent sense, in which to pull a lever is to bring about a situation different from what it would have been if the lever had not been pulled, as, but for the agent, it would not ; for in a fully determinist world, the pulling of the lever is itself just part of the total situation, as determined as anything else. Of course, any such derivative sense of ' cause ' is bound to be frustratingly elusive. Because it is not fully experimental, it cannot be translated into terms of possible control by possible agents ; but because it retains the element of ' making things happen', neither can it be translated into a pure observer's language. It might well be argued that there can be no ' real ' justification for a sense of ' making things happen' which is radically inaccessible or irreducible either to experimental control or to observa- tion, and so, perhaps, radically imprecise. On the other hand it is not too difficult to see how the derivation might work. For though it is no doubt true that an important part of the experience out of which we learn to use notions such as 'cause' is our own pulling of levers; another, and at least equally impressive, is our experience of being on the other, levered end of the stick. " Causes ", said Flew, " bring about their effects." Quite so ; but this only makes them available to bring about clhanges in what would otherwise be the case if they are themselves open to some form of practical control. To people who are accustomed to talk of causal chains or to make distinctions between causes that are proximate or remote, the fact that a cause is something that makes something else happen will not generally seem incompatible with the inevitability of its own operation. This, then, seems to be the sense of ' cause ' that belongs to ordinary causal determinism, a sense in which to say that everything is caused is to say that everything is made to happen as it does, but specifically not to say that everything is in principle open to deliberate control. It may be a sense incapable of precision, it may scarcely be justifiable ; but, however anthropomorphic and vague, it is yet undeniably</page><page sequence="12">136 ALAN MONTEFIORE. familiar. And it must be a closely allied sense which will do, if any will, for the alleged quasi-causal relationship between a future event and a present vision of it. The future, either as it would be if nobody interfered or as it is going to be anyhow, may be somehow responsible for bringing about the antecedent vision-in conjunction, of course, with whatever other conditions may be necessary; but even if this future might in some sense be the cause of earlier happenings, it would remain wholly unavailable as a lever by which to alter the past. In the first case because it could not even be made to appear as a potential lever ; and in the second because it would not be possible to pull the lever while ensuring at one and the same time the presence of the conditions necessary for it to work. Somebody will probably object to all this that it is pointless to make a fuss over the possibility of talk about altering the past, since it is impossible to talk (seriously) of altering even the future. If causes can no more change what is going to be than they can what has already taken place, there is nothing to worry about in the idea that they might work backwards. This, however, is essentially an observer's argument. For an observer, causal levers are indeed nothing more than particular instances of observed generalities, which can be formulated equally well from either direction in time ; and ' change ' is an intransitive verb. This is the point of view from which it has seemed easy to show that there is no con- flict between causal explanations and voluntary action conceived as action that is performed under no sort of compulsion ; for observed generalities are clearly not the sort of things that might compel or bring about particular events. For an agent, on the other hand, to change some- thing is to ' cause ' it to be otherwise than it would have been had the cause not acted as it did. The idea of the ' future as it might have been ' is in this way essential to an understanding of the agent's view of causal change. By pushing his lever, he selects one among the possibilities of</page><page sequence="13">DETERMINISM AND CAUSAL ORDER. 137 the situation for actualisation ; he changes the course of events from what it was previously going to be. In practice it may be easy enough to bully an agent into thinking that there must be something wrong with his language. ' Change ' can be a tricky term, and once one has slipped into talking of abstractions like the present and future it can soon be made to seem absurd to talk of changing either. Admittedly, too, one can perfectly well talk of the ' past as it might have been'; and to the observer the main difference between past and future may appear as the almost accidental, personal one that in the case of the future he cannot yet say which of the various possibilities is in fact to come about.11 To the agent, however, the difference lies not in what he may know, but in what he might do. He cannot, of course, do anything to add a further and different future to the one that is already going to happen. But he can in some circumstances add to the particular events that the future would otherwise have held, or deter- mine which of the possibilities is to come to pass-because in this case, unlike that of the past, there is not, even unknown to him, already a winning candidate in the field, or rather, perhaps, a candidate that has already won a race that has already been run. (This brings out again the way in which the causal lever of determinism is only a sort of derivative from the lever operated by an agent. In the determinist world, too, there may be logical, but there can be no practical ' might be's or ' might have been's. Backwards and forwards, one can but observe the sequences. But this still does not make it a purely observer's world. The levers that can be. observed at work really bring about their effects and are not just followed (or preceded) by them. Similarly, if any influence may be exercised by a future, backward-working cause, it cannot be thought of as operating any sort of selection among as yet-i.e., up to the time of the cause- 11 cf. Professor A. J. Ayer's The Problem of Knowledge, Ch. 4, section vii. Ayer's view seems to be that it is only because of this discrepancy in our knowledge of the past and the future that we regard ourselves as agents at all.</page><page sequence="14">138 ALAN MONTEFIORE. unactualised 'might have beens '. The most one could say would be that if the future had been going to be different from what it was, the past would have been different too.) Mr. Pears has already provided, of course, a series of intricate and subtle arguments against the view that the future and the past are for all explanatory purposes strictly symmetrical.12 The reason why I have not simply cited his authority, leaving the matter at that, is partly because I am not sure whether I have fully understood all his argu- ments and partly because I have anyhow to disentangle myself from one aspect of them. For it might well seem that even if I have perhaps just managed to steer round the logical immutability of the past, I shall still find myself caught in contradictions about the future. For according to Pears " determining is something which is done in time ... . When an event has already happened, either it has already been determined by an earlier event or it has already determined itself. And in either case there is no deter- mining left for its later sufficient condition to do." If anything is to be capable of determining anything else, it must itself be something ; but so far as the present is con- cerned, the future is as yet nothing. " For those who say that the future determines the past forget that ' the future ' is a phrase of success which must not be used prematurely." It seems as if the suggestion that something in the future might determine or bring about something in the present or past is to suggest that something which is not yet anything is already-prematurely-something; which is hardly any better than saying that something which has not happened has happened, or vice versa. This is such an abstract argument that it is a little difficult to estimate its force. One thing, however, that it does seem to show is that there may sometimes be differences between the terms 'determine' and ' make happen'. An 12 ' Time, Truth and Inference' in the Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, 1950-51. The following quotations are all taken from this paper. See also Dummett's contribution to the symposium on " Can an effect precede its cause? ", pp. 40-41.</page><page sequence="15">DETERMINISM AND CAUSAL ORDER. 139 event which has not already been determined by an earlier event may, if one likes, be said to have determined itself; but though it has certainly happened, it has not made itself happen. So perhaps there is a lurking discrepancy between the two uses of ' determine ' in the previous sentence; and in this gap there might after all be room for something- imprecise, maybe-for the later sufficient condition to do. Though of course, what is left to the later condition is not left to be done later. It is only the sufficient condition itself that happens later on-or, alternatively, would happen if nobody intervened. All the same, there is no denying that the future cannot be present without ceasing to be the future. The question is rather whether we are bound to assume that nothing can determine or make anything else happen unless it is itself present at the time of the determining ? In one sense at any rate the answer is obviously not ; we frequently talk of events having their causes in the more or less remote past. But perhaps we have to say that such causes work through chains of intermediate causes, so well constructed that everywhere there are links and nowhere temporal gaps? But again it is not easy to say what this stipulation would amount to for, for example, many of the explanations that we habitually use for human behaviour. At any rate Flew is prepared, within a slightly different context, to regard it as within the bounds of logical possibility that we should not insist on this assumption " Russell once discussed the idea of mnemic causation: a cause in this sense could operate over a time gap ; and this notion may find appli- cation if the search for the engram is ever abandoned."13 Not everyone, of course, is prepared to contemplate causation over a time gap. Dummett, for one, was very dubious about it ;14 and J. W. Dunne, who believes in precognition, has felt driven to say therefore that the future must be present only somewhere else. But Flew anyhow saw " nothing peculiarly catastrophic about such speculations ". So "I " Can an effect precede its cause? ", page 47. 14 " Can an effect precede its cause? ", page 33.</page><page sequence="16">140 ALAN MONTEFIORE. presumably he would reject the argument that for anything to be able to determine anything else, it must be something, if to be something is to be something present. And if he is ready to reject it as it applies to the past, I can see no reason why he should not reject it, so far as it goes, as it applies to the fiuture too. Argumenta ad homines may be all very well, however, but they are not on their own good enough. Would one be justified in rejecting the argument, applied as it may be either to the past or the future or both ? In fact it seems to be one of those initially persuasive arguments that become less and less clear the more carefully one tries to study them. For if one does say, in one way or another, that for anything to be able to determine anything else, it must itself be something, what exactly is one saying? If ' be something' merely means ' be (something) actual or present ', then one's assertion would do no more than express that aspect of cause which Flew, the precogniser and others might be prepared to consider inessential, and so could not count as an argument against them. Alternatively, to decide whether anything is something may involve some sort of ontological decision, (based, perhaps, on currently accepted principles of natural science). But now the assertion that past or future are really nothing is no longer the temporal tautology that neither is present, but rather a denial of ontological status. Questions of ontological status are nearly always fairly obscure ; here there is a suspicious likelihood that it will in the end itself turn out to have some connexion with capacity to act as a cause. In which case the assertion that past or future has not got this status would again turn into a mere assertion of the very aspect of ' cause ' that is in dispute, and so again could not count as a reason for regarding it as essential. But still, it may be said, all this is just as fallacious as any other argument dependent on a parallel treatment of the past and the future ; for although there is a sense in which the past is not anything now, what it was is now definite, while the future, either as it will be anyhow or if</page><page sequence="17">DETERMINISM AND CAUSAL ORDER. 141 only nobody intervenes, at this moment is not. But this is simply another version of the very point at issue all over again. For if all the levers that are needed to produce the future have already been pulled, by agents or by each other, then it is perfectly definite. And even if some levers are yet free to be pulled, those that are already in position may be sufficient to determine a future that will be if nobody interferes; and although the word 'determine' could not here carry a full determinist sense, this possible might-be future could still be definite enough in its own non- determinist way. The whole question still turns on what sorts of levers there are. It may still no doubt be objected that all I have done is to have produced a particular silly instance of sticking to ' ordinary language'. For of course causes are familiarly thought to 'bring about' their effects in a way which, strictly speaking, may be neither that of observer nor agent. Even philosophers are aware that nobody in practice treats the past and the future as equally inaccessible to causal control. But the proper question is ' Why shouldn't they?' If common thought and talk are unclear or confused, it is not for the philosopher to insist on the confusion ; his task is rather to seek by his analysis for what can clearly and justifiably be said. To this I may reply by way of a coda that we are inescapably both agents and observers and sufferers and that our language is compounded accordingly. Three standpoints at least and as many in between positions; and why should any one of the standpoints be more justifi- able than the others? Perhaps this depends on the nature of the inescapability. That it is practically so is obvious enough. But in theory? Even in theory I am doubtful whether it is in the end possible consistently to work out the idea of a pure observer's language-(still less that of a language of a pure agent or sufferer). At any rate, by accepting, as I have done throughout this discussion, the easy ready-made reference to agent-language and observer- R</page><page sequence="18">142 ALAN MONTEFIORE. language as if they were two distinct and identifiable systems, I have in effect been begging what is the funda- mental question, namely the nature of the relationships between these different standpoints. Perhaps, indeed, the question is so fundamental that I should have started by discussing it thoroughly before even attempting this paper. But in such a case I do not know when the paper would have got itself written-; for on the fundamental questions, I am far more sure that they are fundamental than I am as to what to say about them.", However, be all this as it may, it seems clear meanwhile that any view one may have on questions of determinism and the like should depend on how one thinks the different standpoints may be related. It may be possible, of course, to avoid thinking about this at all ; but then, unless one is lucky, one's resolution of one problem is liable to turn out inconsistent with one's resolution of another. This is why until and unless it is possible to show that one of the stand- points ofTers more precise and dependable access to informa- tion about the world than does any other, it will remain necessary to insist on the tensions and interdependence between them. Which is, from one point of view, what I have been trying to do in this paper. It may seem philosophically defeatist to cling on to a set of concepts that can only be thought indirectly, half in the shadows and only partially open to observation. But then in the last resort, too sharp a clarity can be in its own way misleading. 15 So after all I seem here to end very much where Flew ended in his original paper on " Can an effect precede its cause? ": " This is, unfortunately, not the place to go through variations on this theme; such an exploration might bring out a lot about, for instance, the differences between the standpoints of agent and spectator and the interrelations of our functions as doers and knowers, helping us to make more of Kant's insights here; which surely involve something which will have to be incorporated into even a sketch-map of the territory in which the freewill puzzles arise."</page></plain_text>
