GROVE University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Faces of the Earth at Chalcatzingo , Mexico: Serpents , Caves , and Mountains in Middle Formative Period Iconography The monuments ety Olmecs to create were monumental are one the first of their Mesoamerican art, indisputable and those stone soci- dis- ety to create monumental art, and those stone monuments are one of their indisputable dis- tinguishing traits. The presence of such monu- ments within a limited geographical area of Mexico's southern Gulf Coast has enabled ar- chaeologists to define and delimit the basic Olmec realm and to identify the three sites with the preponderance of monuments - La Venta, San Lorenzo, and Laguna de los Cerros - as major Olmec centers. While stone monumental art seems to have been exclusive to the Olmecs' Gulf Coast realm prior to c. 800 b.c., a limited number of sites in Central Mexico and along the Pacific Coast of southern Mesoamerica also erected somewhat similar carved stone monu- ments during a two- or three-hundred-year pe- riod after 800 b.c. Because there are no known antecedents to monumental art in Meso- america other than those of the Gulf Coast, the carvings created at the Pacific Coast and Central Mexican sites were most probably pro- duced using a technology ultimately derived from Olmec roots (see Clark and Pye, this vol- ume). The additional fact that the non-Gulf Coast monuments also adhere to many of the basic stylistic canons of Olmec monumental art reinforces that observation. The site of Chalcatzingo, in the highlands of Central Mexico, has more than thirty Forma- tive period carvings, the largest quantity known outside the Olmec domain. Archaeological re- search conducted at Chalcatzingo over the last few decades has shown that those monuments were displayed in and around a major village site (fig. 1) (Grove 1984, 1987a). That ancient vil- lage is situated on the terraced hillslopes at the base of two massive stone hills - the Cerro Chalcatzingo and the Cerro Delgado - that dominate the flat landscape of the surrounding Amatzinac valley. A settlement had existed at Chalcatzingo as early as 1500 b.c., but all archaeological and stylistic data indicate that the site's monuments were created c. 700-500 b.c., the period during which the settlement also reached its maximum size and impor- tance. The 700-500 b.c. temporal range for Chalcatzingo's carvings makes them contem- poraneous with many of the monuments at the Olmec center of La Venta, Tabasco. Indeed, although Chalcatzingo is situated more than 250 mountainous miles west of that Olmec center, there are specific iconographie motifs that occur on monuments only at Chalcatzingo and La Venta (Grove 1989), suggesting that sig- nificant interaction took place between the two centers, yet the form of that interaction remains to be determined. However, Chalcat- zingo also shares equally distinctive but different iconographie symbols with the Formative pe- riod centers of Teopantecuanitlán and Oxto- titlán, Guerrero, to the southwest, indicating interaction with that region as well. At Chalcatzingo there is a direct correlation between the themes communicated by indi- vidual monuments and the area of the site at which they were erected (that is, displayed), thus facilitating an understanding of Chalcatzingo's 277</page><page sequence="3">i. Chalcatzingo, a schematic map of the site showing monuments and site locations discussed spatial organization or "sacred landscape" (Grove 1999). There is a thematic dichotomy to that organization. In the southern site sec- tor, carvings occur on the cliffs and talus slopes of the Cerro Chalcatzingo, a mountain that was clearly sacred to the ancient villagers who lived at its base and at settlements in the sur- rounding region (see Angulo 1987: 140; Cook 1967: 63-64; Grove 1987b: 430-432). The carv- ings on that sacred mountain convey mythico- religious themes, and many depict supernatural animals. In contrast, the monuments erected in the northern site sector, within the actual village area, portray particular personages and contain iconography that is related to rulership (Grove 1984: 449-468, 109-122; 1987b: 431- 432; 1999). This essay uses a set of iconographie images at Chalcatzingo, the "earth monster faces" of Monuments 1, 9, 13, 21, and 22, to address two significant topics. The first is the nature of the site's monumental art: just how Olmec are those images? The long-held notion that the Gulf Coast Olmecs substantially influenced contemporaneous societies across Mesoamerica has understandably led scholars to focus on what is "Olmec" about monuments at non- Gulf Coast sites. In doing so, we have perhaps neglected to inquire whether there is also any- thing non-Olmec about them. The second topic pertains to the iconographie aspects of the monumental art. Early scholars described many of the images in Olmec art as "feline" or "jaguar" (see Covarrubias 1942, 1944, 1946; Saville 1929; Stirling 1940, 1943), and those generic "feline" identifications still heavily influence perceptions and interpretations of Formative period art today. Nevertheless, var- ious studies over the past few decades have demonstrated that a variety of supernaturais, in zoomorphic and anthropomorphic form, are represented in the images that are labeled as "jaguar" (Joralemon 1971, 1976; Stocker et al. 1980; Joyce et al. 1991; also Bonifaz Ñuño 1988, 1989; Lückert 1976). In the following pages, Chalcatzingo's five "earth monster face" carvings are individually analyzed and their important iconographie mo- 278 GROVE</page><page sequence="4">tifs are discussed in detail. The analyses often utilize iconographie data from sites other than Chalcatzingo when such data are useful to an understanding of Formative period iconogra- phy, and thus the discussions of individual Chalcatzingo monuments will sometimes make momentary digressions into those other data. The results of that overall examination not only highlight the eclectic nature of Chalcat- zingo's monumental art, but also provide evi- dence that the site's "earth monster faces" are not jaguars, but instead carry the iconography of serpent supernaturais, one of which is even further distinguished as a sky serpent. On a more general level, the analyses also offer some new and different insights into certain widely spread Formative period motifs. In this regard, some of the interpretations presented here are significantly different from the iconographie identifications made by friends and colleagues (including some contributors to this book) whose work has helped illuminate our under- standing of Formative period iconography. The analysis begins with the first major monument discovered at Chalcatzingo, Monu- ment i, located at the southern periphery of the site, and concludes with Monument 22, one of the northernmost carvings. 2. Chalcatzingo Monument i, Middle Formative period, granodiorite Chalcatzingo Monument 1 The largest and most famous of Chalcatzingo's carvings is Monument i, a large bas-relief exe- cuted on a vertical rock face high on the Cerro Chalcatzingo. Monument 1 is an appropriate starting point for discussing the site's five "earth monster faces"; it is the best known of those images, and its iconographie details also aid in understanding aspects of the other faces. The overall scene of Monument 1 depicts an elaborately decorated personage seated within a U-shaped niche (fig. 2). Large scrolls issue outward from the niche, plants grow from its exterior surface, and trilobed rain clouds with falling raindrops float above it. An oval eye motif with crossed-band, on the upper side of the niche, distinguishes the U-shaped niche as an "earth monster face" shown in side (profile) view. Ever since the discovery of this magnifi- cent carving (Guzmán 1934), it has been recog- nized that the U-shaped "earth monster face" symbol represents a cave. Most discussions of Monument 1, while describing the cave/niche, have nevertheless focused primarily on the personage seated within the cave (for example, Angulo 1987: 135-141; Guzmán 1934: 238-243; Oliveros 1996). However, by studying several motifs "decorating" the "earth monster face" niche, additional details about the image's sym- bolism can be ascertained. Serpent Attributes The identification and understanding of For- mative period supernatural imagery was greatly facilitated by the discovery in 1965 of a large greenstone statuette at the site of Las Limas, Veracruz, on the southern periphery of the Olmec domain (Beltrán 1965; Medellín 1965). That carving, "El Señor de Las Limas," is a per- sonage holding a supernatural baby. The per- sonage is decorated with engraved iconography that includes a different supernatural face on each shoulder and each knee (see Medellín 1965 : fig. 10). The four faces shown are those of super- naturals commonly depicted in other Forma- tive period art, and thus Michael Coe (1968: 114; 1972; 1989: 71-76) and other investigators have found the Las Limas representations to be extremely useful in their interpretations of various aspects of Formative period art and iconography. Over the last two decades the supernatural faces have been identified. They grove 279</page><page sequence="5">include a saurian (or " dragon"; left shoulder; fig. 3b), a serpent (right knee,- fig. 3c), and a fish (or "shark"; left knee; fig. 3d) (Grove 1987c; Joralemon 1971: nos. 126, 232, 249, 253; Joyce et al. 1991; see Joralemon 1996: 53-54 and Reilly 1 9 91: 154 for alternative interpretations of the upper images). The fourth face (fig. 3a) is more anomalous, but a face with similar icono- graphie attributes is depicted on a jade plaque in the collection of the Museo Nacional de Antropología in Mexico (fig. 4) (Benson and de la Fuente 1996: 138, 247; Joralemon 1971: no. 233), where it occurs in a Maya-like "Jester God" position. The fourth Las Limas face may therefore have carried a similar rulership- related value in Middle Formative period art. The positioning of the supernatural faces on the statuette is important, for if the body of the Las Limas personage is seen as a simple cosmological model ("upperworld": shoulders/ earth's surface: waist/"underworld": knees), then the location of the saurian, serpent, and fish supernaturais within the basic "upper- world/underworld" dichotomy of the For- mative period cosmos is clarified. It is also informative that the supernaturais of the under- world (serpent and fish) are legless, and the upperworld (saurian [and/or bird]) are legged (see below). Two decades ago I characterized Monument i 's cave/niche image as an "earth monster mouth" (Grove 1968: 486) and as a "jaguar- monster mouth" (1972: 159-161). A reexami- nation of the carving in the light of the Las Limas faces indicates that the cave/niche is neither a generic "earth monster" nor is it a "jaguar monster" image but is instead the face of the serpent supernatural. Serpent iconogra- phy, as elucidated by the face on the right knee of the "Señor de Las Limas,"1 has three distin- guishing attributes (figs. 3c, 5): (1) the distinc- tive upcurve in the corner of the mouth (fig. 5d); (2) the unusual shape of the elongated eye, narrowed by the upcurved mouth (fig. 5 c); and (3) the oval eyeball containing a crossed-band motif (fig. 5b). Although those three attributes appear together on the Las Limas engraving, they do not always co-occur in every icono- graphie representation of the serpent super- natural. For example, the serpent painted deep within Juxtlahuaca cave, Guerrero (fig. 6) (Gay 1967: 30; Grove 1970: fig. 35; Joralemon 1971: no. 248), exhibits only the curved eye and the eyeball with crossed-band motif.

Painting 2, Juxtlahuaca cave, Guerrero, Middle Formative period stances, a single attribute can function to iden- tify the complete image (pars pro toto), and that is true in the case of Chalcatzingo's Monu- ment i. Although an upcurved serpent mouth and elongated eye are absent from the U-shaped niche face, the presence of the eyeball with crossed-band motif nevertheless identifies the image as a serpent face. That the cave/niche is symbolized as a serpent face should not be surprising since the metaphorical relationship between serpent and cave is ancient in Meso- american iconography (for example, Gillespie 1993)- Fang Motifs A second detail of the Monument 1 face is elu- cidated by analogous representations on the large polychrome mural (Mural 1) painted above the south grotto of Oxtotitlán cave, Guerrero (figs. 7, 8) (Grove 1970: frontispiece). That mural depicts a personage seated upon a large frontal supernatural face, and the latter clearly exhibits the distinctive mouth, eye, and eyeball attributes of the serpent supernatural (Grove 1970: fig. 4f, g). The location of that mural above an actual cave mouth reiterates the correlation of serpent mouth and cave in Middle Formative art. The Oxtotitlán serpent face also displays two large fangs that protrude down and outward from the upper jaw row. It has been my observation over the years that in frontal views of supernatural images, such fangs can often be a significant cosmological referent: outcurved fangs indicate that the im- age is that of a "sky" supernatural or within the sky register, while incurved fangs denote the earth register and its associated super- naturals.2 Those fang referents are particularly evident in Late Formative monumental art at Izapa (fig. 9) but appear to have carried the same symbolic significance in Early and Middle For- mative art and in the art of later periods as well. The outcurved fang motifs of the Oxtotitlán serpent face therefore identify it as a sky ser- pent supernatural. Viewing Chalcatzingo Mon- ument i with that insight, it can be noted that fangs - albeit curled fangs - occur at both the upper and lower inner extremes of the U- shaped mouth (fig. 2). Significantly, they curl outward, again presenting a sky referent for this large supernatural serpent face.

Both occur high on the sides of mountains, above the terrestrial plane. They are caves within the sky realm. The Quatrefoil Motif Kent Reilly and I (working together and also independently) have reached several similar conclusions about the significance of the "U- shaped" form of the Monument 1 face. The first is also the most apparent - that the U- shape is a half-sèction or "profile view" of a quatrefoil face, such as the image shown in full frontal view on Chalcatzingo Monument 9 (fig. na) (Reilly 1994: fig. 15.18). Second, the frontal quatrefoil face, when sectioned horizontally (as if buried in the ground to its midpoint) (fig. 11b) (Reilly 1994: figs. 15.20, 15.21), has a close iconographie counterpart in the mountain- glyph/place-glyph utilized at Monte Albán (and some other sites in the Oaxaca area) during periods Monte Albán II and IE (fig. 12) (see also Gillespie 1993: 88-89; Marcus 1980: 59; 1992: 395-396, figs. 11.36-11.44; Marcus and Flannery 1996: 196-198, figs. 233-236, 256, 258-260). In line with my comments above regarding fang motifs, it is worth noting that the Monte Albán II period mountain-glyph/place-glyphs on Building J at that site are also often marked by outcurving fangs, indicating that they too symbolize "sky mountains" (fig. 12) (Marcus 1992.* 395-396, figs. 11.36-11.38). A major iconographie meaning of the quatrefoil motif at Chalcatzingo is clearly that of mountain. The quatrefoil face displayed on Monument 1 is therefore not only a sky serpent cave, but also specifically a mountain cave. Susan Gillespie (1993: 74-75) has discussed the quatrefoil motif as a cosmogram and the quatrefoil's interior as symbolic of the "cosmic center" (see also Angulo 1987: 140, for Monu- ment i as "heart of the mountain"). It is signifi- cant that the creators of Monument 1 made the quatrefoil shape the dominant image - to the point that two major iconographie attri- butes of the serpent supernatural, the upturned mouth and elongated eye, could not be accom- modated to the rigid quatrefoil form. The utili- zation of the quatrefoil face as the primary image is particularly significant in view of the fact that it is not an icon used by the Gulf Coast Olmec in their monumental art. In fact, the serpent eye and sky fangs that reiterate the overall meaning of the "mountain cave" im- age are, themselves, relatively rare in Olmec monuments. Chalcatzingo Monument 13 A fragment of another "earth monster face" carving, Monument 13, was found on the lower slopes of the Cerro Chalcatzingo in 1972 (fig. 13) (Grove and Angulo 1987: 122, fig. 9.13; An- gulo 1987: 141, fig. 10. 12; Grove 1984: fig. 32). The bas-relief image is executed on a rock slab, and, although incomplete, it is in many re- spects a smaller version of Monument 1. It de- picts an anthropomorphic figure seated within a quatrefoil mouth, and plant motifs "grow" from the exterior of the quatrefoil.

Only a small section of the upper area of the quatrefoil exists, but two features barely visible on that section suggest that the iconog- raphy of this face differed from the Monument i face: a narrow "slit" eye and a large "flame- eyebrow." Unfortunately, little more can be said about this carving beyond the fact that it is a second example of a quatrefoil face. Chalcatzingo Monument 9 The broken fragments of this carving, a bas- relief on a thick stone slab, were unearthed in the 1960s by a farmer preparing the upper sur- face of Chalcatzingo's massive Middle Forma- tive period earthen platform mound (PC-4) for planting (Grove and Angulo 1987: 124). The carving was illegally removed from the site and now resides, reconstructed (fig. 10) (Ben- son and de la Fuente 1996: 178-179; Grove and Angulo 1987: fig. 9.17), at an art institute in the United States. The monument's image is a full frontal quatrefoil surmounted by two large oval eyes, unusual eyebrow motifs, and a circular motif between the eyes and nostrils. The carving is unique among all known Middle Formative monuments because the center of the quatrefoil - the mouth - is hollow and passes entirely through the stone. If the carv- ing had been erected in a vertical position at the northern upper edge of the PC-4 platform mound (its location when discovered), its great quatrefoil image would have been easily visible to the peoples living in the ancient village sur- rounding the mound, and any ritual activities associated with the monument would likewise have had community visibility. Such ritual ac- tivities may have included the passage of ob- jects or people through the supernatural^ open "cave" mouth (for example, Grove 1972: 161; 1984: 50), and, as Gillespie (1993: 75) has com- mented, "to go through this doorway was to enter the supernatural world at its cosmic cen- ter and to have access to the power . . . there." In the first published description of this monument, I characterized the image as a "jaguar's face" (Grove 1968: 489-490) and soon thereafter as a "jaguar-monster mouth" (Grove 1972: 159-161). I now believe that this carving is also more likely the face of a serpent super- natural. The quatrefoil is again the dominant icon. David Joralemon (1971: no. 141) illustrates crossed-band motifs within the oval eyes, yet if crossed bands were once present, they have since eroded to the extent that they are not readily apparent today. Nevertheless, even in their absence, a second feature of the face also suggests that it is a serpent image - undulating eyebrows that end in outturned cleft motifs. Eyebrow Motifs For at least fifty years scholars have recognized the prominence of flame-eyebrows in the de- piction of Formative period supernatural im- ages. Any inspection of images with such flame-eyebrows reveals variation in eyebrow treatment, yet little attention has been paid to those differences, and the term flame-eyebrow continues to be used generically. Recently, however, the correlation of different eyebrow treatments with particular supernaturais has been made possible through another "mini- Rosetta Stone," an anthropomorphic stone figurine referred to in the literature as the grove 285</page><page sequence="11">"Young Lord" (Benson and de la Fuente 1996: 213-215; Joralemon 1996: 53-56; also known as "Slim," Reilly 1991: 152-166). Like the Las Limas statuette, the "Young Lord" is decorated with engraved designs that include a repre- sentation of a legged zoomorph (a caimanlike creature) on the figure's left leg (fig. 14b) and a legless zoomorph (serpent and/or fish) on the right leg (fig. 14a). As noted above, the dichotomy of legged versus legless supernaturais seen on the "Young Lord" is also a structural principle exhibited in the supernatural faces on "Señor de Las Li- mas." Associated with each zoomorph depicted on the "Young Lord" are six unique anthropo- morphic faces in profile, each with distinctive eyebrow treatments. Many of those profiled faces have counterparts in Formative period portable art, and thus their association here with either the legged ("upperworld") or leg- less ("underworld") zoomorphic supernaturais is instructive. Of interest to this essay is the fact that eyebrows ending with outturned cleft motifs occur only on the faces associated with the legless/serpent zoomorph (fig. 14a). The eyebrows of the serpent zoomorph itself are undulating and also terminate in an outturned cleft; thus they are similar to the eyebrow treat- ment on Chalcatzingo Monument 9. Therefore, although the dominance of Monument 9's qua- trefoil motif lends the appearance of a jaguar- like cave-mouth face, the image may instead be a serpent face.3 Chalcatzingo Monument 21 The face images and archaeological contexts of Monuments 21 and 22, displayed in the northern sector of the site, differ markedly from those described above. Monument 21 is a carved stela and had once been erected beside a small, low, rectangular stone-faced platform construc- tion on Terrace 15. Similar low stone-faced platforms, with stelae, also occur on adjacent terraces, and all are Middle Formative period in date (Grove 1984: 57-65; Prindiville and Grove 1987: 65 ). The "earth monster face" found on Monument 21 is of secondary importance in the bas-relief scene. The primary image is that of a woman whose outstretched arms touch a tall vertical object (fig. 15). She is one of the few known females depicted in Meso- american monumental art of this early time period (see Clark and Pye, this volume), and Ann Cyphers (1984) has suggested that her por- trayal on this monument may have commemo- rated a marriage alliance between elite families at Chalcatzingo and those at another center. In this regard, it is worth observing that the tall vertical object she touches contains a motif known at only one other site, Teopantecuanitlán, Guerrero (Grove 1987b: 429; 1989: 142-145, fig. 7.14). The "earth monster face" forms the lower register of the scene and acts as an earth ref- erent. The woman stands upon the face, and thus she stands upon the surface of the earth. The "earth monster" face is not a quatrefoil. Instead, it is primarily created by extremely large incurved fangs and unusual trilobed "eyes" or "eyebrows." It lacks any obvious attributes 14. Zoomorphic motifs engraved on the legs of the "Young Lord" figure, Middle Formative period, greenstone: (a) legless serpent and/or fish zoomorph, right leg; (b) legged saurian, left leg After Benson and de la Fuente 1996: 213 286 GROVE</page><page sequence="12">of a serpent supernatural, probably because in this context the face is not communicating the idea of an entrance into the earth but rather serves to denote that the woman stands on the earth's surface. Chalcatzingo Monument 22 The "earth-monster" face located on Terrace 25 differs from the others at the site in that it is not carved on a stela or rock face, nor was it apparently intended to have the wide visi- bility of those other monuments. Instead, the face decorates an "architectural" construction, Monument 22, the only Olmec-style tabletop altar (throne) ever found outside the Gulf Coast (fig. 16) (Fash 1987; Grove 1984: 65-68). The relative "invisibility" of this monument is due to its positioning: it is situated within a large sunken rectangular stone-walled patio, and its upper surface (metaphorically the "earth's sur- face") is level with the top of the patio wall 15. Chalcatzingo Monument 21, a woman standing on an earth image, Middle Formative period, granodiorite Drawing by Barbara Fash and the modern ground surface (fig. 17). Monu- ment 22 was built into the sunken patio's south wall and therefore is also part of the wall's architecture. Beyond the fact of its uniqueness outside the Gulf Coast, Chalcatzingo's tabletop altar presents several inconsistencies when com- pared to its Olmec counterparts. Gulf Coast tabletop altars are monolithic carvings that were created from multiton blocks of stone brought to Olmec centers from distant stone sources at a great expenditure of human labor. Monument 22 is a more modest construction created by stacked stone slabs - even though suitable altar-sized boulders occur only a few hundred meters away. The front sides of Gulf Coast tabletop altars are characterized by a central niche (symbolic cave entrance) with seated personage (see fig. 18). Monument 22 lacks such a niche (and personage), and its front surface is decorated only with a pair of distinc- tively shaped elongated eyes carved in bas- relief: the eyes of the serpent supernatural (figs. 1 6, 17). However, even those serpent eyes are unusual, for the oval eyeballs within the eyes do not contain the crossed-band elements that occur on the Las Limas serpent face, Oxtotitlán Mural i, Juxtlahuaca Painting 2, or Chalcat- zingo Monument 1. The most economical explanation for the absence of a central niche on Monument 22 and its replacement with a partial serpent face is one of symbolism vis-à-vis context. The faces of Chalcatzingo Monuments 1, 9, and 13 are iconographically identified as entrances into the earth and underworld, specifically via mountain caves. The frontal niches of Gulf Coast tabletop altars similarly symbolize en- trances into the earth and underworld (see Gillespie 1993: 76; Grove 1973, 1981). Chalcat- zingo Monument 22 lacks entrance symbol- ism in its iconography, yet it is placed within a sunken patio, and that subsurface enclosure is itself a symbolic entrance to the under- world.4 Thus, just as the south grotto of Oxto- titlán cave substitutes for the mouth of the great serpent face painted above the grotto, the sunken patio serves as Monument 22's mouth/ niche, making an actual niche in the tabletop altar both redundant and unnecessary. The absence of crossed-band motifs in Mon- ument 22's serpent eyes is perhaps also expli- cable as due to the monument's subterranean context. Crossed-band motifs occur in the eyes grove 287</page><page sequence="13">288 GROVE</page><page sequence="14">i6.

La Venta Altar 4, Middle Formative period, basalt of Monument 1 and Oxtotitlán's Mural i, im- ages that are located on mountains and that also carry additional motifs linking them with the sky realm. From these two examples it could perhaps be inferred that their crossed bands carried a sky symbolism (as the motif does much later in Maya iconography). From such a perspective, the absence of crossed bands in association with Monument 22 could be considered appropriate because the monu- ment is not in a sky context. Such an explanation is not entirely satis- factory, however, for a far more common use for crossed-band motifs in Formative period art is as the symbol for entrances into the earth and otherworld (Joyce 1980). An excellent ex- ample of that iconographie use is found with the image of the supernatural "jaguar"5 face that decorates the tabletop ledge of La Venta Altar 4 (fig. 18). That image, with a crossed- band motif in its mouth, occurs directly above the altar's central niche, and the crossed band apparently marks the niche as an entrance. The same iconographie meaning occurs earlier in images on Early Formative period pottery (c. 1100-900 b.c.). Perhaps the most explicit example is found on a cylindrical pottery bowl from the site of Tlapacoya in the Basin of Mex- ico (fig. 19) (Benson and de la Fuente 1996: 201; Joralemon 1971: no. 120). This vessel carries two images: a saurian head in profile (fig. 19a; often labeled as a "fire serpent") and a frontal face with a crossed-band motif in its gaping mouth (fig. 19b; often termed a "were-jaguar" face). The images actually represent two views of the same saurian earth supernatural. Signifi- cantly, the profiled head of the supernatural is raised upward at an angle, showing that its mouth is open - and in its frontal image the open mouth is marked by the crossed-band mo- tif to show that it is an opening, an entrance into the earth (see also fig. 20a). Thus, as Rose- mary Joyce (1980) has noted, the crossed bands in the eyes of Chalcatzingo Monument 1 may have symbolized entrance rather than sky. However, such openings are not always expli- citly marked (for example, fig. 20b), and, as discussed above, the absence of crossed-band motifs on Monument 22 may simply reflect its association with the large sunken patio. This discussion not only shows that the symbolism of motifs can vary over both space and time, but, in the case of temporal change, highlights an important transformation. Ser- pent images are extremely rare in the art of the Early Formative period (c. 1100-900 b.c.), and the iconographie data indicate that "earth en- trance" iconography was associated with the saurian supernatural during that period (for ex- ample, figs. 19, 20). In contrast, overall serpent imagery and the serpent association with "earth entrances" is more common in the Middle Formative period (c. 900-500 b.c.) and supplants the saurian imagery, particularly in elite monumental and portable art. That trans- formation, one of many aspects of the social evolution that took place over those six cen- turies of the Early and Middle Formative pe- riods, is significant. However, it is also beyond the scope of this essay (but see Grove 1993). Mountain Faces, Mountain Symbols Various facial images in Early and Middle For- mative period monumental and portable art have been identified as "feline," yet, as the iconography of those periods becomes better understood, most of those identifications be- come questionable. In particular, there seems little evidence beyond superficial appearances to support the notion of jaguar imagery in "earth entrance" iconography during those pe- riods. Chalcatzingo's three complete major "earth monster faces," Monuments 1, 9, and 22, carry attributes of the serpent supernatural as expressed on the Las Limas figure. In Meso- american cosmology, serpents have a symbolic association with caves and entrances into the earth (or sky), particularly as conduits between realms (Gillespie 1993). Entrance into the earth and underworld relationship is clear for the images discussed above, in spite of the icono- graphie differences in their images. Many of those differences seem directly correlated with the location of the images within the site's nat- ural sacred geography and constructed sacred landscape. The quatrefoil mountain-cave motif is the dominant icon of the two images displayed on the Cerro Chalcatzingo (Monuments 1, 13), while monuments on the flat terraced hillside away from the cerro (Monuments 21, 22) lack the quatrefoil mountain form. However, the one exception to the latter is Monument 9 (fig. 10), the quatrefoil image erected on the PC-4 platform mound, near the midpoint of the ancient village (fig. 1).

If correct, the act of using monumental art to identify major mounds as "sacred mountains" has interest- ing implications beyond Chalcatzingo. The 195 5 research at La Venta disclosed two large stelae, Monuments 25/26 and 27, at the southern base of the site's 100 foot-tall earthen pyramid (Mound C-i; Drucker et al. 1959: 204- 209). The major image on both stelae is a large frontal supernatural face with outcurved (sky) fangs (fig. 21) (Drucker et al. 1959: figs. 59, 60 [shown upside down], pls. 53, 54; Porter 1992: figs. 7, 8). The faces also have eyebrow elements with outturned cleft elements (see discussion of Chalcatzingo Monument 9, above). Recent excavations by Rebecca González in the area immediately adjacent to those 1955 discover- ies have uncovered two additional - and nearly identical - stelae, Monuments 88 and 89 (González 1996: 76). Therefore, four large ste- lae with identical face images had been dis- played in a line along the southern base of the pyramid, facing out toward Plaza B, the site's major "public plaza." If Chalcatzingo's Mon- ument 9 symbolically identified that site's plat- form mound as a "sacred mountain," then it is equally probable that La Venta's four stelae depict "mountain faces" that likewise served to designate Mound C-i as a "sacred moun- tain" (Grove 1999). The La Venta "mountain faces" are remarkably different from those at Chalcatzingo, yet both can be considered re- gional Middle Formative equivalents to the witz (mountain) faces that decorate some Maya pyramids and distinguish those structures as sacred mountains as well. The display of four "mountain face" stelae has additional implications. In Mesoamerican cosmological concepts, sacred mountains (or similar geographic features) are positioned at the four cardinal directions. If the La Venta ste- lae are mountain symbols, then the set of four may likewise symbolize the sacred mountains of the four cardinal directions, even though displayed in an alignment at the front of the site's pyramid. Reilly has arrived at a similar conclusion regarding the set of four Middle Formative face images at the site of Teopante- cuanitlán, Guerrero (see Reilly 1994: 252-255; Martínez Donjuán 1982, 1985, 1986, 1995). grove 291</page><page sequence="17">These carvings, four large inverted T-shaped monoliths, each with virtually identical bas- relief faces (fig. 22), were set within the north and south walls of Teopantecuanitlán's large stone-walled sunken patio,6 and, as Reilly (1994: 255) has observed, "the monuments . . . could have represented the four directional mountains to the priests conducting rituals in the sunken patio." Few scholars would have doubted the pres- ence of such common Mesoamerican cosmo- logical principles of directionality among Formative period societies. However, the var- ious mountain images discussed here seem to document their presence and also indicate that by the Middle Formative period the concept of sacred mountains in the four cardinal di- rections was beginning to be incorporated into the programs of monumental art and archi- tecture of diverse Mesoamerican societies. Conclusion Because of the attention that the Olmecs have received over the last half century, scholars have generally focused on what seems "Olmec" about the images on portable and monumen- tal art found at the sites outside the Gulf Coast. Yet it is equally important to understand what is also non-Olmec about them, for without a balanced perspective we can never expect to understand the cultural interactions and mo- tivations that led to their creation. In the case of Chalcatzingo's carvings, there are numerous obvious similarities with Gulf Coast Olmec monumental art, but there are also some remarkable differences, such as the use of the quatrefoil motif. Archaeological re- search at Chalcatzingo suggests that the site's inhabitants were part of the indigenous high- land population (Grove 1987b), and linguistic research (Hopkins 1984: 30-52; Manrique Cas- tañeda 1975: maps 5, 7) indicates that they probably spoke a language related to the Za- potee and Mixtee languages of Oaxaca. As a major Formative period highland center, Chal- catzingo interacted not only with Gulf Coast centers but also with chiefdoms in Guerrero, the Valley of Mexico, Puebla, Oaxaca, and along the southern Pacific Coast of Meso- america (Grove 1987dl 434-437). That "inter- nationalism" seems to be reflected in the eclectic mix of iconography that characterizes Chalcatzingo's monumental art. 292 GROVE</page><page sequence="18">NOTES i. This Las Limas face was first recognized as a serpent by David Joralemon (1971: 82-84). 2. See also Miller (1996: 256 note 17). 3. A colleague has remarked that Monument 9 's face could not be a serpent because it has prominent nostrils. However, nostrils are depicted on the ser- pent of Middle Formative period La Venta Monu- ment 19 and on numerous serpent images in later Mesoamerican art, including Postclassic serpent balustrades, and the serpent heads adorning Teoti- huacán's Temple of the Feathered Serpent. 4. The sunken patio's stone wall also incorporates two quite simple niche faces (see figs. 16, 17, and similar motifs in fig. 20b). 5 . Although the face on the tabletop ledge of La Venta Altar 4 looks jaguarlike, its mouth symbol has an upward curve similar to that of the serpent's mouth. 6. Teopantecuanitlán's sunken patio is larger in size than Chalcatzingo's. BIBLIOGRAPHY Angulo, Jorge 1987 The Chalcatzingo Reliefs: An Icono- graphie Analysis. In Ancient Chalcat- zingo, ed.
