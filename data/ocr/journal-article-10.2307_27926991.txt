<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES AND NEWS EXCAVATIONS AND SURVEYS Tel Yarmut, 1999* The thirteenth season of excavations at Tel Yarmut took place between 1 July and 31 August 1999 under the joint auspices of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (UMR no. 7041, Maison de l'Arch?ologie et de PEthnologie, Nanterre) and the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The work was directed by P. de Miroschedji (CNRS). Area supervisors: M. Jasmin (University of Paris I and UMR 7041), aided by E. Langiu and G. Pinard, in Sub-areas Be, Bh, Ja and Jb; S. Guiriec (?cole Normale Sup?rieure, Paris), aided by G. Charloux (?cole du Louvre), in Sub-areas Ba and Bb; and M. Deckers (Univ. libre de Bruxelles) in Area . . de Miroschedji was administrator, with the help of M. Couylas. M. Jasmin was also in charge of the volunteer programme. The technical staff included D. Ladiray, E. Comte and A. Andr? (architect-surveyors); C. Lawniczak (registrar); N. Rashmawi (computer registration); and I. Ali (field technician). L. Vrydaghs (Univ. libre de Bruxelles) spent some time with the expedition to recover samples of phytoliths. A total of 105 volunteers participated in the excavations, which were financed by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Excavations The excavations were primarily concerned with the area of the Late EB III Palace (Area B) and its immediate surroundings (fig. 1). Three major goals were pursued: 1. To complete the excavation of Palace (Stratum B-l); 2. To continue the excavation of the building remains immediately under lying Palace B, which correspond to a proto-palatial building identified in 1997 (Stratum B-2); 3. To resume the excavation of Sounding Ja, begun in 1997, in order to expose the structures located on Terrace J immediately south-west of Palace B. General Stratigraphy of Area The general stratigraphy of this area is now established on the basis of numerous observations. Four strata can be distinguished: 50 000 ? 20 Mt * Cf. IEJ 48 (1998): 136-144. 87</page><page sequence="2">88 NOTES AND NEWS Fig. 1. Tel Yarmut, 1999: aerial view of Area (view to north-east). Stratum -0 is represented by remains of agricultural terraces of Byzantine and post-Byzantine (notably Mamluk) periods, which cut the north-eastern part of the palace obliquely (see fig. 1) and whose walls have penetrated the underlying strata, sometimes deeply. Stratum B-l corresponds to Palace Bl. Stratum -2 was termed Intermediate Stratum B-l/B-2' in previous reports, since it had been recognised after the identification of the so-called 'Stratum B-2' (now called Stratum B-3), whose remains were initially found immediately underneath those of Stratum B-l. Stratum B-2 corresponds to a proto-palatial building (Palace B2), whose walls were both re?ut and levelled when Palace Bl was built. Strata B-l and B-2 are considered to be contemporary with Stratum G-2 of Area G, adjacent to the north-east. Stratum B-3, called 'Stratum B-2' in earlier reports, is represented by domestic dwellings, some of which were forcefully destroyed. This stratum corresponds to Stratum G-3 in Area G. Although the underlying strata have not been reached this season, they are already known from excavations in the northern corner of Palace Bl (Sounding B) in 1980 and along the north-eastern fa?ade of Palace Bl (Area G) in 1984-1992.</page><page sequence="3">NOTES AND NEWS 89 Excavations of Palace Bl (Stratum B-l) (figs. 1-2) The Alignment of the North-eastern Peripheral Wall of the Palace (Sub-area Be). The aim of the excavations here was to trace the exact alignment of the north eastern peripheral wall of the palace near its eastern corner, where it presents a kind of zigzag. After clearing the entire length of this wall, it was evident that it actually consists of two walls: The peripheral wall stricto sensu is Wall 1247, attested as a single wall along a length of 80 m., from the northern corner of the palace until Square W 39. Its line is perfectly rectilinear until Squares W 37-38, where it changes course in order to join Wall 1533 at the junction of Squares W 39-40. Wall 1533 in Squares W 40-42 has different masonry and another orien tation in relation to the Hypostyle Hall. In a building as carefully planned as Palace Bl, these two changes in the orientation of the north-eastern peripheral wall are difficult to explain, unless one admits the possibility that the Hypostyle Hall was built before or separately, or that a change in the plan of the palace was decided upon in the course of construction. Another observation that remains unexplained is that Wall 1533 continues in Square W 42 beyond the supposed junction with the south-eastern wall of the Hypostyle Hall, and that it stops suddenly, without making a corner (W 1967). The Hypostyle Hall and the Main Entrance to the Palace (Sub-area Bh). The removal of the Byzantine terrace wall, which destroyed the north-eastern half of the Hypostyle Hall, has revealed a seventh column base in situ and a third column base out of context. Thus, it is now certain that the hall originally had a total of twelve columns, organised in four rows of three columns each, instead of only nine columns, as we presumed in 1997. The entrance to the Hypostyle Hall, i.e. the main entrance to the palace, was discovered in Square V43 (fig. 3). Since it was obliquely re?ut by the Byzantine terrace wall, only its south-western door jamb and part of its raised threshold are preserved (S 2415). The threshold was reached from a vestibule (see below) by means of two steps composed of large stone slabs polished by use (S 2416). On the basis of the length of the lower step (entirely preserved), one can determine the original width of the door ? 2.6 m. ? and the location of the destroyed north-eastern door jamb. From this we can deduce that the two doors of the Hypostyle Hall (S 2415 and S 1979) had the same dimensions. The fact that the south-western door jamb is aligned with the third row of column bases found in situ allows the positioning of a fourth row of column bases aligned with the restored north-eastern door jamb ? in the same way as the door jambs of the south western door of the hall (S 1979) are each aligned with a line of columns. On the basis of the distance between the south-western wall of the hall (W1982) and the first row of columns, it is also possible to locate the position of the north-eastern wall of the hall in relationship to the restored fourth row of columns. The result is the plan illustrated in fig. 2. The existence in this hall of a fifth row of columns is most improbable for metrological reasons. One should therefore assume the presence of a corridor (1544) between the Hypostyle Hall and the north eastern peripheral wall. The clearing of the plastered floor of the Hypostyle Hall has brought to light all the stones of the south-eastern bench (S 2404), which stops in a curve near the south eastern door, as well as the drainage channel S 2406. The latter was destined to</page><page sequence="4">-:-1 VO I I 35 36 I 37 I 38 I 39 I 40 I 41 I 42 [ 43 I ? X -J- Qq HH restored ^ llll excavated ggggg watercbennei Fig. 2.

It goes through Wall 1982, following the north western bench (S 2418) of the hall along a preserved length of c. 7 m. Its bottom and its sides are made of large stone slabs. The Area to the South-east of the Hypostyle Hall (Sub-area Jb). The entrance to the palace and the Hypostyle Hall was through a vestibule (2112) located to the south-east (Squares S-V 42-43). The excavation of the south-eastern sector of the palace is still incomplete and the observations are inconclusive. From the line of Squares 43, this sector rises sharply to the south-east. At the time of Palace Bl it apparently went through two stages. Initially, it may have been devoid of any construction; this was surely the case along Wall 1973. Later, houses were added to the south, in Squares S-T 42-43, where they present two phases of construction. There are also indications of a second phase in the use of the peripheral south-eastern wall of the palace (M 1952) in Squares S-T 41 and Q 41; this second phase is represented by the addition of a stone coating against the outer face of the wall. It may be that the construction of the two walls (M 2111 and M 2122), which together form the boundary of Vestibule 2112, also dates from this later phase; these walls are actually coarsely built terrace walls separating the entrance to the palace from the debris accumulated higher up to the south-east. Forecourt 1970 (Sub-areas Bh/Bb). The discovery in Square R 38 of a wall segment (W 2595) resting against the south corner of Hall 2011 entails a substantial modification</page><page sequence="6">92 NOTES AND NEWS of the plan of the eastern part of the palace. This wall clearly corresponds to Wall 1961, discovered in 1993 in Square Q 40, resting against the outer face of buttress 1959. These two wall segments have the same orientation and the same thickness (less than 2 cubits, which is the standard thickness for the inner walls of the palace), and both are a late addition. Wall 1961 + 2595 was destined to isolate the extension of the main courtyard in Squares R-T 38-41 and to create a closed forecourt. This discovery confirms that the eastern sector of the palace was indeed an area distinct from the other parts of the palace, as suggested by the architectural features of its components (fig. 2). It consists of the Hypostyle Hall; Forecourt 1970, separated from the main courtyard by Wall 1961 + 2595; Reception Hall 2011; and the rooms accessed from the latter hall (2012, 2015 and 2051). The Clearing of the Built Spaces inside the Palace (Sub-areas Ba and Bb). To the north-west of the forecourt, the excavation of Sub-areas Bb and Ba involved the opening of additional squares (in 33, 35 and S 35), the removal of baulks and the clearing of floors (fig. 4). The clearing of the floor of Reception Hall 2011 was completed, as well as that of Rooms 1708, 1783, 1749 and 1636, in which many complete pithoi were found. Several additional door thresholds were uncovered. In Square 35 the continuation of a pavement was found, obliquely crossing the north-eastern courtyard of the palace. In Square Q 27, the excavation of Locus 91 was completed and the central column base was discovered, together with two cooking areas; this locus may have been a kitchen. Several new observations were made concerning the chronology of these constructions. It is now obvious that Palace Bl went through two major phases of use. The second phase is marked by the addition of some walls (in Squares O-Q 28-29) and above all by changes in the organisation of the circulation between the spaces: some doors were blocked, others opened and partition walls built in order to sub-divide spaces. These observations complement those mentioned above regarding the area located to the south-east of the Hypostyle Hall and the late modification of Forecourt 1970. The Western Corner of the Palace (Sub area Bf). The excavations of three semi squares in H-J 26-27 were aimed at determining the organisation of the western corner of the palace, especially the nature of a large stone structure identified in Squares G 25-26 (Area E) in 1981, which had originally been interpreted as a monumental platform; a sounding made in 1990 in Square J 24 had shown that it could not be a platform, since it did not extend under the western corner of the palace. This year's sounding in Squares J 26-27 has revealed the continuation of the south western peripheral wall of the palace, together with the beginning of two buttresses; this confirms the validity of the restored plan proposed since 1990, which left no opening for an entrance door. In Square H 27, the sounding has also revealed the south-eastern extremity of the pseudo platform and has shown that it is linked to the peripheral wall of the palace; these two structures were built together with foundation trenches which also penetrate the stone fills of Phase II of the fortifications. These observations suggest that the pseudo platform is in fact a stone reinforcement built around the western corner of the palace (see fig. 1), possibly because this corner was resting on fills and therefore required consolidation. The south-eastern boundary of this structure is</page><page sequence="7">1 27 ? ? ?j" , .81 i82 88 i * 87 w i~~?j ?j ! ! i + + + +&lt;?V~t + + ? -f?*-~+ + + v ?

It should be borne in mind that a similar structure ? albeit smaller and less elaborate ? had been observed around the western corner of Building in 1997. The Northern Corner of the Palace (Area N). To complete the plan of the northern corner of the palace, it was necessary to examine whether the north-western peripheral wall (W 51) indeed extends beyond its junction with the north-eastern peripheral wall (W 52), as suggested by surface observations. The excavation of an area of 80 sq.m. in Squares X-Y 21-24 has shown that the two peripheral walls are actually bonded, forming a perfect right angle. The apparent prolongation of the north-western peripheral wall (W 51) was in fact the extremity of a perpendicular wall (W 2509) of the same thickness (1.85 m. or 3.5 cubits), resting against the corner. This wall was followed for a length of 10.7 m. up to a large stone, which could be a cornerstone marking the return of the wall to the south-west. As the orientation of W 2509 is slightly different from that of W 52, it may be assumed that its construction was not part of the initial building plan of the palace. This thick wall suggests the presence of an important construction resting against the northern corner of the palace. Unfortunately, the very strong erosion present in this area makes it unlikely that its contemporaneous floors are preserved. Excavations of Palace B2 (Stratum -2) (figs. 1,4) An important objective of the excavations was to establish the plan, limits and character of a proto-palatial building identified in 1997 immediately below Palace Bl. It corresponds to Stratum B-2. The excavation is a problematic one, since it requires the removal of the floors of Palace Bl, a procedure which is not possible in all parts of the building. Palace B2 is attested today on an area of c. 1,000 sq.m. (fig. 4). It is possible that its north-eastern limit was identified in Squares U 31-35 and its south-eastern limit in Squares R-T 35, but its south-western limit remains uncertain and its north western boundary is unknown. Since the levelled remains of the underlying Stratum -3 sloped down to the north-east, Palace B2 was established on a partially artificial terrace, built with fills accumulated over Squares S-T 30-35. The walls are preserved for a height of only one or two stone courses above the floors and sometimes have foundations up to one metre deep below the floors. The latter are usually located only about 20 cm. beneath those of Palace B. In plan and architectural character, this building is comparable to Palace Bl. The careful planning is manifest in the symmetry of the rooms and the regularity of their layout. Rectilinear walls are attested for lengths of over 20 m. A total of approximately 20 spaces have been identified, including at least two which represent inner courtyards with pebble floors (in Squares 30-31 and P-Q 32). The existence of a drainage channel (S 1562 in Square U 33), similar to that of Stratum B-l, is also noteworthy. The precise date of this building is difficult to establish. The rather scarce pottery recovered on its floors does not appear to differ from that of Palace B, so that it is not necessary to assume that a long lapse of time separates the construction of the two buildings. Their similarities in terms of construction methods and planning, coupled with the fact that Palace</page><page sequence="9">notes and news 95 Bl immediately follows its more modest predecessor after a forceful levelling and a systematic plundering of its building material, suggest that Palace B2 was a first effort, soon replaced by a more ambitious prince with a more monumental building project. The Sounding to the South-east of Palace (Area Ja) The sounding that was begun in 1997 on Terrace J (Square 42) was extended to Squares 40-41 in order to examine the relationship of the thick wall 2102 with Palace Bl and Building K. This wall was partially visible on the surface with an orientation grosso modo north-west to south-east. It turned out that Wall 2102 was cut by the foundation trench of the south eastern peripheral wall of Palace Bl; hence, it may be part of a building contemporary with Stratum B-2. Wall 2102 is linked to Wall 2103 which, in 1997, had been erroneously ascribed to an earlier stratum called J-2. The latter wall is oblique, oriented more or less east-west, thus forming an angle of 130? with Wall 2102. These two walls isolate a locus (2104) which included at least two pillar bases resting on heavy stone foundations, approximately one metre deep. This locus was found filled up with a thick layer of pulverulent black ashes and with partially burnt bricks fallen from the walls (?), some of them still attached together. The stratification allows a distinction to be made between the material in situ on the floor and that fallen from the roof. The abundant archaeological material found in this locus includes several complete vessels, notably 'giant' platters, pithoi, jars, holemouth jars and a twin vessel, basalt grinding stones and a basalt tournette, with its two discs found together ? the second complete tournette of this kind discovered at Yarmut in the last two seasons. As this locus has been only partially cleared, its function remains uncertain. pierre de miroschedji CONFERENCES The Fifty-Sixth Annual Convention of the Israel Exploration Society, in which 165 members took part, was held in Turkey on 4-11 October 2001.

OBITUARIES GLADYS DAVIDSON WEINBERG, one of the world's foremost authorities on ancient and medieval glass, died on 14 January 2002 in Columbia, MO, at the age of 92 years. After completing her undergraduate studies at McGill University, Toronto, and at New York University, she began her career in classical archaeology as a member of the Johns Hopkins University expedition to Olynthus in 1931. She became a Fellow of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens and was a member of the American School Excavations at Corinth between 1933 and 1937. She first became interested in glass objects and their manufacture while working on her Ph.D. on minor finds from Corinth at the Johns Hopkins University. Her book, The Minor Objects (Corinth 12,1952) is a monumental volume. In 1942 she married Saul S. Weinberg, an equally distinguished classical archae ologist. Following World War II, when they both served in Europe in the Secret Service, they undertook further archaeological work in the Mediterranean. They moved to Columbia, MO, in 1948, following Saul Weinberg's appointment as a faculty member of the University of Missouri. Between 1952 and 1967, Gladys Weinberg was the editor of Archaeology magazine, published by the Archaeological Institute of America. In 1957, together with her husband, she founded the Museum of Art and Archaeology at the University of Missouri, where she served as Curator of Ancient Art, and later, in 1962, as Assistant Director, a position she held until 1977. During the 1960s and early 1970s Gladys and Saul Weinberg lived in Israel, where, following a surface survey in 1963, she excavated two ancient glass factories: one at J?lame (15 km. south-east of Haifa), and the other at a site near Shavei Zion in Western Galilee. She studied a large slab of glass (3.4 1.95 m.) at the necropolis of Beth Shecarim (Glass Factories in Western Galilee, IEJ 14 [1964]: 286-288; G.D. Weinberg [ed.], Excavations at J?lame, Columbia, 1968 ? a monograph which became a text book). She also worked at Beth-Shecarim and Kafr Yasif (1966), continuing her investigation of ancient glass factories (ZEJ 16 [1966]: 283-284), and at es-Samariya, where a twelfth</page><page sequence="12">98 NOTES AND NEWS fourteenth-century glass furnace was found (IEJ 18 [1968]: 198-199; A Glass Factory of Crusader Times in Northern Israel, Preliminary Report, in Annales du 10e Congr?s de l'Association Inter nationale pour l'Histoire du Verre, Madrid ? Segovie, 1985: 305-316). Together with her husband, she directed five seasons of excavations at Tel Anafa in Eastern Galilee (Hellenistic Glass from Tel Anafa in Upper Galilee, Journal of Glass Studies 12 [1970]: 17-27). Gladys Weinberg was made an honorary life member of the Archaeological Institute of America and received a gold medal for Distinguished Archaeological Achieve ment. She also received the Percia Schimmel award from the Israel Museum, Jerusalem, in 1986, together with her husband Saul. Gladys Weinberg's pioneering work helped establish the study of ancient glass in general, and in Israel in particular, as an important archaeological discipline. Although her published work focused on glass, she was a scholar with insatiable curiosity and love of all things antique. She was a constant and intrepid traveller. Those who knew her will remember her as a vastly entertaining raconteur of her adventures and a loyal friend to all who shared her love of antiquity.</page></plain_text>
