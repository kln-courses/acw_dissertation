Barba THE folk art of the Pennsylvania Germans has in the last two decades received nationwide recognition. Popular writers have stressed its decorative qualities and found in it a refreshing note in this epoch of decadent art. Its motifs have invaded the arts and crafts from wallpaper to playing cards and paper nap kins. But few writers were concerned about the origins of these motifs and their deeper implications, although some tried to read into them a popular Christian symbolism. During the past fifteen years we have visited a hundred rural churchyards in the counties of eastern Pennsylvania and have made many sketches of the designs that adorn our early tomb stones. We restricted ourselves to the period, roughly from 1750 to 1850. We related these designs to those found in other media: on jraktur baptismal and birth certificates, on iron stove plates, but ter moulds, textiles, ceramics and on our painted barns. We found the same familiar motifs: always there were sun-wheels, radiating half- and quarter-suns, six-point compass stars, confrontal birds, trees of life, hearts and tulips. It was of course very tempting to ascribe to them a simple Christian symbolism, especially when on birth certificates and on tombstones. But we were soon confronted with a number of stubborn questions: Why are there always sun symbols, trees of life, confrontal birds, hearts and tulips? Why this tenacious adherence to a few *A paper read on October 14, 1955, at the annual meeting of the Pennsyl vania Historical Association. Dr. Preston A.

Why are these designs characteristic of our Penn sylvania German folk art rather than some others? How did they come to be used in the first place? Why and whence their origin? If they are popular expressions of Christian symbols, why are they not used by other racial elements in America? And why, if religious in nature, are they found on secular objects, on cooking utensils, on painted barns? Why is the Latin cross, the very symbol of our Christian faith, notably absent? Why are they found abundantly on tombstones in Lutheran and Reformed churchyards? Why not on those of the Amish and the Moravians and only rarely upon Mennonite tombstones? These were some of the questions that confronted us when we started out upon our long search for satisfying answers. It seemed a certainty that a people who had for a full century and a half maintained here in Pennsylvania a cultural island, so to speak, where they adhered to the language and the ways and traditions of their fathers, could not have originated these designs. It was but a matter of course to seek their origins in the an cestral homeland. Our search took us several times to the Rhenish Palatinate and adjacent areas. There we found the same designs and symbols on every hand, on doors, on lintels, farmyard gates, and keystones; on baptismal certificates and on tombstones. But we also found them elsewhere and nowhere more profusely and in greater diversity than in the northern Saxon lands, in Lippe Detmold and Herford, in areas that had held out longest against conversion to Christianity. The trail, at first so clearly marked, now led into still other areas and then became divided and ob scured. It was disconcerting, to say the least, to find the same motifs in Persia, in distant India, yes, even in the ancient civili zations of Sumeria, Assyria and Egypt. It became apparent that we had to do here with certain basic concepts that had emerged from out of the elemental experiences and observations of man kind before recorded history. However modified such motifs may have become through the accidents of time and place, they have continued down the corridors of the centuries and have found continued expression on the tombstones as well as in the other manifestations of folk art among the Pennsylvania Germans. Let us digress briefly to regard the general nature of folk art, a term which came into usage only toward the end of the nine</page><page sequence="4">SYMBOLS AND STONES 243 teenth century. Until recently works on the history of art did not even include any consideration of folk art and could hardly have done so asi long as "folk" and "art" expressed concepts that re mained in opposition to each other and as long as art was looked upon as an individual achievement without any more immediate national, racial or sociological relationship. Since folk art took the form of applied art, it was difficult to grasp its deeper signif icance. Then too the fact that it receded so rapidly under the im pact of our technical and industrial civilization was accepted as proof of its inferiority. There was a time when we associated archaeology only with Rome, Greece, Egypt and other ancient civilizations in the East. But thanks to the far-reaching discoveries archaeologists have made in the countries of northern Europe, and particularly in the Scandinavian countries and northern Germany, we have today a far better understanding of the nature and the origin of Ger man folk art. We have had in consequence numerous valuable publications about the origins of the designs and symbols common to the folk art of the Germanic peoples. However they may vary from each other the consensus is that the principle of folk art, as of folklore and folk litertaure, is associative rather than logical thinking. We must consider folk art as a result and not a product, instinctive and communal; as a living link in the long chain of a people's social existence. Its inner nature is not determined by individual expression; the individual is only the medium or vehi cle for the common expression of a people. It is impersonal and must remain folk-bound. It possesses a tenacious uniformity, al lowing only diversity within the framework of such uniformity. That which gives it uniformity is the employment of certain age old motifs or patterns. These motifs, antedating the recorded word, were the simple ideograms of our remotest ancestors. Through succeeding generations they held a continuity of con cepts which united them as a folk with their long past. It becomes evident that if in the course of time this racial or communal con tinuity should be broken by far-reaching social, religious, political or economic changes, then folk art must of necessity languish and perish. That is what has indeed happened to the folk art practiced by the Pennsylvania Germans. It is the reason why our study of Pennsylvania German tombstones is confined to the years</page><page sequence="5">244 PENNSYLVANIA HISTORY between 1750 and 1850, from the burials of the first pioneers down to the threshold of the new industrial era. Let us now consider briefly certain basic designs or motifs that underlie the folk art on our Pennsylvania German tombstones, no matter how diversified they may have become in the course of a century. For early man the sun was the hallowed force which affected his life from birth to death. Traces of sun worship are to be found among all the ancient civilizations and are the earliest evi dences of religious expression. But especially for our primitive pre-Christian ancestors in northern Europe, with its long winters and short summers, the greatest phenomenon in nature was the sun, and observation of its ever-recurring annual course across the sky was life's profoundest experience. In the light of the warmth-giving sun Nordic man saw the manifestations of a benev olent Life-giver. That he did not deify the sun in anthropomorphic form but expressed his reverence in the use of symbols is indicated on the rock writings in southern Sweden with their circles, sun wheels and sun-chariots; and on the rock carvings of the Extern steine, an early center of the sun cult in the Teutoburger forest; and especially in the ancient Roman quarries near Bad D?rkheim in the Palatinate, on the walls of which Germanic laborers em ployed by the Roman legions in the third century of the Christian N era carved sun-wheels and swastikas. The study of these monu ments makes it clear that primitive man in northern Europe prac ticed heliolatry. It was the sun that remained paramount in the lives of the people of northern Europe. The annual course of the sun, the winter and summer solstices, the vernal and autumnal equinoxes and the changing seasons that came with them, all these deeply stirred primitive man to express himself in signs that denoted these changes. Circles, spoked wheels within circles, six-point compass stars, spirals, radiating half- and quarter-suns, the Ur bogen, the lowest arc the winter sun describes against the sky, all these were letters in a sign language in which he expressed his adoration. In his own obscure way he beheld in the sun the glory and effulgence of Divinity. In the course of time he placed these signs upon the objects of his everyday life, upon the lintels of his doors, upon his beds and cradles, upon his barns and upon</page><page sequence="6">SYMBOLS AND STONES 245 his tombstones as a benediction, a benison or invocation, yes, even as a defense or talisman against the powers of evil and darkness, just as many centuries later the cross of Christ came to be used. And all these are found in the folk art of the Pennsylvania Ger mans and nowhere more strikingly than on their tombstones. Among these sun symbols the most widely spread is the hooked revolving cross or swastika, one of the oldest known symbols. It was revered as a sacred sign in India, China and Persia three millenia before the Christian era. It was known among the aborig ines in pre-Columbian America. The early Christians used it as a mark of distinction. In later centuries it was often used in Northern Europe as a talisman and} placed on houses and barns and household objects invoking blessings or warding off evil. It is today the universally favored good-luck charm. Less ancient in origin but next to the swastika the most widely disseminated symbol is the six-point compass star. I have seen it on the temple steps of ancient Ephesus; on the walls of the little Byzantine Metropole Church of Athens; on the bronze doors of the shrine of Eyoub Ensari, standard-bearer to Mohammed at Istanbul; on a bake-oven door in Lehigh County. In German folk art one sees it everywhere. Like the swastika it is frequently used as a benison or talisman. Together with the whirling swastika it forms the two basic designs on our painted barns. It is of fre quent occurrence on our tombstones. Less frequent is the spiral. It is found among the Bronze-Age rock-writings of southern Sweden and has remained a favored sun symbol among the Indogermanic peoples of northern Europe. For the peasant working in his fields the spiral seemed a natural symbol of the sun's course, now rising each day further north and higher until the summer solstice, then reversing its course as it approached once more the winter solstice. Two opposing spirals, the ascending and descending movements of the sun upon its annual course, are also found on our tombstones. After the life-giving sun nothing so engaged the mind of prim itive man as the processes of life itself?the seed, birth, growth, florescence, fruition, decay and death, and out of death a new life?a constant dying and becoming?an eternal cycle. This continuity of life wakened in him a sense of immortality, that precious pos tulate of the human heart which sets man aside from all other</page><page sequence="7">PENNSYLVANIA HISTORY Tombstone, 1780, Christ Union Church, Lower Saucon Township, Northampton County.

For him nothing was more symbolical of life's proc esses than the tree, earth's oldest living thing, silent witness of the passing of the generations of men. The sacred tree, the tree of life, was born out of the needs of the heart of man and be came one of the two most widely spread themes in the art of na tions. The tree of life has its roots in the infancy of the human race. When recorded history begins it is already deeply estab lished. The concept of the tree of life was old when the Pentateuch was written. Our first parents chose to eat of the tree of knowledge and their children's children have ever since eaten of it in toil and sweat and sorrow. But the sons of Adam have ever cherished in their hearts the vision of the tree of life. Evidences of tree wor ship abound in the art and literature of the oldest races. We find it among the Assyrians and Chaldeans and other Semitic tribes; in Egypt, Greece and Persia; and among the Indogermanic races of northern Europe. The pre-Christian Teutonic tribes worshipped in their sacred groves. Despite the efforts of the Church later cus toms and superstitions continue to reflect the tree cult of the pre Christian centuries. The tree of life with its many modifications and, mutations became the dominating motif in the German folk art of the latter seventeenth and through the eighteenth century. Thence it was transported to Pennsylvania by our early German pioneers and here it continued for a full century to flourish as a vital part of their communal folk expression, and nowhere more articulate than on our tombstones. My allotted time does not permit discussion of additional motifs such as the heart, the tulip, the solar arc, confrontal birds and animals, all of which we have considered and illustrated in the 18th Yearbook of the Pennsylvania German Folklore Society. I have tried to indicate briefly that the basic motifs on our Pennsylvania German tombstones have engaged the minds and hearts of man through ages past and over vast areas of the earth. I recognize the dangers in assuming that they carried with them the same connotations as they came wandering down the centuries. Sometimes new wines were poured into the old skins. But one cannot escape sensing in them a unifying thread, a timeless af firmation of life and eternity.</page></plain_text>
