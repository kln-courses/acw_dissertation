The classical injunction to combine instruction with delight is beautifully exemplified in these dialogues. They are skillfully contrived and abound in original insights as well as in stimulating formulations of familiar opinion. The dramatis personae, Meredy and Hardith, are full-fledged characters of pointedly different commitments. These commit- ments are gradually revealed and developed as the conversations on the nature of art and on the relation of art to life proceed. The author admits that the two characters are facets of himself. At the outset one sus- pects that they may represent his routine and professorial self pitted against his inspired self. The former, Meredy, elaborates with easy dialectic the distinction between immedi- ate and infallible experience of pleasure in art and the fallible judgments about that ex- perience of value. Thus he attempts to clarify the exuberantly intuitive but naive beliefs of Hardith in the identity of aesthetic, technical, cultural, and even of the religious values in art. As their characters develop it is not difficult to conclude that Hardith, powerfully persuaded of the analogy of art to nature and of the truth of the philosophy inherent in Greek drama, represents a kind of Dionysus, while Meredy is the Apollo who soberly argues that this alleged analogy of art to nature is merely a phase of anthropomorphism, and distinguishes between the philosophy in art, which performs nothing beyond an aesthetic function, and philosophy about art. However, this Dionysus never learns to speak with the tongue of Apollo. Instead the breach between them widens as the argument probes funda- mental assumptions. Meredy is revealed as the naturalist convinced of the subjective na- ture of values and of the non-human character of the universe, while Hardith admits to belief in a rational and moral fate reaffirmed in the catastrophe of every tragedy.

If the two are ever united, theirs is a Kantian union in which experimental knowledge of the phenomenal world differs in standards and in kind from the transcen- dentally inspired beliefs of the realm of art and moral action.
