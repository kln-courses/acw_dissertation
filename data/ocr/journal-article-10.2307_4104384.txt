According to Tavy D. Aherne, Nakunte Diarra: Bogolanfini Artist of the Beledougou (Bloomington, Ind., 1993), the first pattern suggests the strength of a warrior going to battle, and the second refers to the wealth that Mauritanian women are perceived to have; see pp. 18, 21. 4.

In discussing these opposing approaches, which they traced to the early twenti- eth century, Kris L. Hardin and Mary Jo Arnoldi used the terms "ethnographic" and "aesthetic"; see Hardin and Arnoldi, "Introduction: Efficacy and Objects," in Arnoldi, Christraud M. Geary, and Hardin, eds., African Material Culture (Bloomington, Ind., 1996), p. 4. Hardin and Arnoldi also made the crucial point that "this split is not necessarily a split between art historians and anthropol- gists" (p. 23 n. 7). Among the studies that take an "ethno-aesthetics" approach to African art are: D. J. Crowley, "An African Aesthetic," in Carol E Jopling, ed., Art and Aesthetics in Primitive Societies: A Critical Anthology (New York, 1971), pp. 315-27; Jean Laude, "Esthtique et systime de classification: La statu- aire africaine," Sciences de l'art 2 (1965), pp. 57-85; in Jacques Kerchache, Jean- Louis Paudrat, and Lucien Stiphan, Art of Africa, trans.

(New York, 1987). 2. The name of this headdress is problematic because it has been used by dif- ferent ethno-linguistic groups. Thus, the Baga Sitemu people call it d'mba, the Baga Pukur yamban, the Nalu mnimba. Nimba, as the mask has commonly been known, seems to be the Susu word for it (Susu being the lingua franca of the regions where the headdress is worn). Frederick Lamp, who has done extensive work on the Baga Sitemu, has recently adopted the word d'mba to refer to the mask; see Lamp, Art of the Baga: A Drama of Cultural Reinven- tion, exh. cat. (New York and Munich, 1996), pp. 156-63, i71-76. However, since we are not dealing with any group in particular, we will continue to employ the generic nimba as a shorthand for d'mba, yamban, mnimba, and other possible names. 3. The paradox of the Fulbe reference in the nimba headdress and its symbolic dimensions has been explored by Frederick Lamp in his recent book on Baga art; see Lamp (note 2), pp. 176-80.

Many of the designations that we use today are predicated on these early European attempts to write down African lan- guages based upon European phonetic rules. Such designations were made more complex by the fact that often Europeans were getting information from various sources with various points of view, including people of different ethnicities who spoke markedly different languages. Hence the nimba mask in the writings of Coffiniires de Nordeck is called by the Susu name simon guind. 9.

In his recent work on Baga art, Frederick Lamp places little emphasis on this difference, instead proposing a far more elaborate taxonomy that distinguishes between three different types of female busts: d'mba (or yamban among the Baga Pukur); d'mba da-tschol (described by Lamp as ugly, in contrast to the beautiful nimba mask); and zigiren-wuonde (a smaller headdress representing a young woman). It is possible that the mask some Baga refer to as d'mba defet is in fact this last one, which would thus require an analysis in its own right, beyond the scope of this article.

It is possible that the use of the word nimba to refer to initiation spirits (or to the masks representing them) was a general rule in different Guinean groups, independent of the use of the headdress. Even among the Baga, the Susu phrase nimba fouri (the nimba's belly) was once reported to designate a spirit of initiation, without a distinct evocation of the headdress; see M.

Obeng noted that the term abusua is not equivalent to clan because, unlike the latter, which describes "four or five different groups of abusua or families with one recognized head," it denotes a "group of people descended from one great- grand-mother on the maternal side." Endogamy is allowed within clans. 4. J. K. Fynn, Asante and Its Neighbors, I700-i807 (London, 1963); and Adu Boahen, "The Origins of the Akan," Ghana Notes and Queries 7 (1966), pp. 1-3. 5.

The early seventeenth-century refer- ence by de Marees suggests that the convention of funerary terracotta art must have evolved as a byproduct of Akan state formation, which resulted in a num- ber of profound transformations in art, aesthetics, and culture. This process is confirmed by informative oral histories collected from among Akan subgroups such as the Wassa, Sefwi, and Aowin; see Quarcoopome (note 23). The prepon- derance of evidence suggests that the burial customs described here certainly predated the westward migration of Akan forefathers from an area of Adansi, a region considered pivotal by most historians of the genesis of Akan culture; see Boahen (note 4). BLACKMUN, "Icons and Emblems in Ivory: An Altar Tusk from the Palace of Old Benin," pp. 148-63. I. Historically, the Edo have valued brass, bronze, and other copper alloys for their reflective surface and reddish color, and have preferred to keep their sculptures bright rather than to create the dark patina admired by Europeans. In the twentieth century, European preferences have influenced Edo taste, and Benin bronzes are often darkened, as they appear in fig. 2. 2. For a brief account, from the British point of view, of the British Punitive Expedition and the events leading to it, see Henry Ling Roth, Great Benin: Its Customs, Art and Horrors (Halifax, 1903), pp. 3-4, and appendix, pp. ii-xvii.

The estimated number of altars in the palace in 1897 varies, as recorded by members of the British forces who took part in the conquest. Compare, for example, Charles H. Read and 0. M. Dalton, Antiquities from the City of Benin (London, 1899), p. 8; and Roth (note 2), p. 184, fig. 18o. 4. In my continuing study of Benin ivories, I have received valuable assistance from many sources. In I98o a Dickson History of Art Travel Grant from the University of California, Los Angeles, funded the initial examination, measure- ment, and photography of altar tusks in American and European collections. A Fulbright Dissertation Research Grant financed my fieldwork in Benin City during i98i and 1982. I am grateful to Ekpo Eyo for the sponsorship of the Department of Antiquities in Nigeria, and to the University of Benin for the use of facilities. I also owe a large debt of gratitude to Chief David Omoregie, who is now the Ineh, or leader, of Igbesanmwan, and other knowledgeable spe- cialists who assisted me in Benin City. The several travel grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities I received between 1987 and 1992 have supported archival study, further collection research, and the ongoing analysis of these materials. In 1993 and 1994, I was greatly aided by a research grant from the Joint Committee on African Studies of the Social Research Council and the American Council of Learned Societies, and also by an NEH Interpretive Research Grant for additional study and fieldwork in Nigeria, in collaboration with Kathy Curnow of Cleveland State University. I have also profited from the kindness, knowledge, and insights of many individuals, too numerous to mention here. I particularly wish to thank His Highness Oba Erediauwa, Oba of Benin, for his interest, encouragement, and generosity. 5.

(Leipzig, 1891), Hermann von Wissmann usually called the Luluwa "Baluba." For general ethnographic information, see Leo Frobenius, "Bena Lulua," in Hildegard Klein, ed., Leo Frobenius: Ethnographische Notizen aus den Jahren 19o5 und 19o6 (Stuttgart, 1988), pp. 3-29; Prosper Denolf, Aan de rand van de Dibese (Brussels, 1954); David A.

In Unter deutscher Flagge quer durch Afrika von West nach Ost von i88o his 1883 (Berlin, 1889), Hermann von Wissmann described how he saw chief Chinkenke and his first wife and children invoke the ancestors while standing before a small earthen mound behind his house (p. lO6). The ancestors were rep- resented as little zoomorphic mud figures; they received millet beer and pieces of meat as sacrificial offerings. Similar mud constructions, often representing quadrupeds, are found among the Chokwe and the Luba-Shaba. See, for exam- ple, Hermann Baumann, Lunda: Bei Bauern und Jdgern in Inner-Angola (Berlin, 1935), figs. 33-34; and William E P.

Rafael van Caeneghem stated over half a century ago that the term bhwanga cannot be translated adequately. He rightly proposed that scholars and others should not translate such terms; see van Caeneghem, "De psychologie der Baluba in hun spreekwoorden over de ziekten," Congo 21, 3 (Mar. 1940), p. 287 n. i. In Les communications des indigines du Kasai avec les dines des morts (Brussels, 1939), J.-A. Tiarko Fourche and Henri Morlighem point to the unmis- takable analogy between bwanga and lupingu among the Luluwa and nkishi among the peoples of the Sankuru River (pp. 57-62).

As Luc de Heusch has shown, the power of the bishimba can best be under- stood on the basis of the concepts of "metaphor" and "metonvm"; see de Heusch, "Pour une Approche structuraliste de la pensie magico-religieuse bantoue," in Jean Pouillon and Pierre Maranda, eds., Echanges et communica- tions: MIlanges offerts d Claude Livi-Strauss (The Hague and Paris, 1970), vol. 2, pp. 81o-13.

See Tshisanda Ntabala-Mweny (note 3), pp. 62-88; and Albert Maesen, "Statuaire et culte de ficondit6 chez les Luluwa du Kasai' (Zaire)," Quaderni Poro 3 (1982), pp. 55-57. Among the Luba-Lubilanji, the term bwanga bwa nmbombo is more current. See Alidoor Samain, "Zeden en gebruiken der Baluba's," Congo 2, i (Jan. 1921), pp. 23-24; Fourche and Morlighem (note 4), pp. 53-55; and Rafael Van Caeneghem, "Godsgebeden bij de Baluba," Aequatoria 7, I (I944), p. 29. 7. The cibola cult is part of the wide range of fertility and healing cults shared by various Bantu peoples in central and southern Africa. See esp. John M. Janzen, Ngoma: Discourses of Healing in Central and Southern Africa (Berkeley, Calif., 1992); and Reni Devisch, Weaving the Threads of Life: The Khita Gyn-Eco-Logical Healing Cult Among the Yaka (Chicago and London, 1993). The bwanga bwa cibola of the Luluwa is apparently closely related to the jebola (or zebola) cult of the Mongo. For instance, Tshisanda Ntabala- Mweny (note 3) mentioned possession by the cibola spirit as a possible way of becoming a cult member (pp. 64-65). For a discussion of the Mongo cult, see Edmond Boelaert, "Yebola," Kongo-Overzee i, 1 (Oct. 1934), pp. 16-19; and Piet Korse, Mondjulu Lokonga, and Bongondo Bonje wa MpayJehola: Textes, rites et signification (Bamanya and Mbandaka, 19go). 8. The Royal Museum for Central Africa in Tervuren holds a schematically carved, small half-figure that was collected among the Luluwa by Henri Morlighem in 1934 (RG. 38816; h. i6 cm [6Y4 in.]). Identified as a cihola figure by the collector; it was probably meant for a woman initiated in the cult to wear at the belt. 9.

Thanks to the wood analyses conducted by Roger Dechamps, we know that the figures in the Royal Museum for Central Africa in Tervuren were made of mutoci wood (Crossopterix fehrifuga) (RG. i8805; De Deken) and of lukwanga wood (Hymenocardia acida) (RG. 43863; Fourche); see Gustaaf Verswijver et al., eds., Treasures from the Africa-Museum Tervuren, exh. cat. (Tervuren, 1995), cat. nos. iio-ii. While the figure collected in the region between 1933 and 1936 by Dr. Tiarko Fourche looks used and weather-beaten, the one acquired by Father Constant De Deken at the end of the nineteenth century is remarkably unblemished. Perhaps Father De Deken got it shortly after it was made, hut it may very well he that this refined, almost manneristic figure was being carved specifically for sale to Europeans. This would also explain why no cavity was made at the top of the figure's head to hold the hishimha. ii. Rafael van Caeneghem wrote that when a man dies without having fathered children, "a sharpened end-piece of a boxwood sprig is driven into his hack," and that a woman who dies childless is buried "with a piece of pottery on her head"; see Van Caeneghem, "Het vrijgezellen-leven in de spreekwoor- den van Luha- en Movo-volk," Congo 21, 1 (Jan. 1940), p. -O5 See also Remi Mbiyangandu, "Le But du mariage," Bulletin do Centre d'6tude des prob- limes sociaux indigines 17 (1951), p. 23. Figures holding a small cup filled with porcelain clay in one hand also tend to symbolize fertility and pregnancy. They are called lupingu la bhwimpe hy the Luluwa; the Luba-Lubilanji, who apparently imported their sculptures from the Luluwa, prefer the name hulenga. These figures were made specifically whenever children deemed beautiful were born and were primarily intended to safeguard and foster the beauty and the health of such newborns. See Maesen (note 6), pp. 52-54; and Tshisanda Ntabala-Mweny (note 3), pp. 89-92. 12. See Marie-Louise Bastin, "A Propos du Panier divinatoire tahokwe," Arts d'Afrique noire 68 (Winter 1988), pp. 19-27- In several villages, I was told that the Luluwa placed small, anthropomorphic figures in the divination basket. See Fourche and Morlighem (note 4), pp. 21-22; and David A. McLean and Ted J. Solomon, "Divination Among the Bena Lulua," Journal of Religion in Africa 4, 1 (1971), p. 34. 13. This is probably the aqua lustralis (osompo), meant to ward off and neu- tralize negative influences, described by Leo Stappers in his studies on the BaaMilembwe (Songye) of eastern Kasai. The author distinguished between sprinkling and washing, which is always done in a centrifugal motion, and emphasized that the salutary effect of the potion is due to the intervention of the ancestral spirits; see Stappera, "Naompo, het aqua lustralia bij de BaaMilembwe," Kongo-Overzee 16, 5 (June 1950), P. 299; and idem, "Priires luba-kasaayi datant de 1912, Cahiers des religions africaines 3, 5 (Jan. 1969), p. 115. 14. Muteba Nzambi Mushipula wrote about the cizaha receptacle that the Luba-Lubilanji used in their kukoholola ritual, which was meant to remove impurities from newborn children. Impurities (mikiya; singular, mukiya) may be a blemish, an irregularity, or "moral ugliness" sustained at birth. The actual kukoholola denotes the lifting of the mother's sexual abstinence and the presen- tation of the newborn child to the ancestors. Special births are accompanied by particular mikiya and a separate kukoholola; see Muteba Nzambi Mushipula, "'Mukiva,' 'Tshibau' et 'Tahibindi': Sanction sociale et morale chez lea Luba du Kaasai," Zaire-Af~rique 27 (May 1987), pp. 277-79.

Such special births, which are generally called mapanga (singular, bupanga), entail observing specific prescriptions and prohibitions. Still, a number of sources clearly distinguish between manga children and mapanga children.

The contextual information on fig. 6 in the present article, which was photographed during linguistic field research by Professor Amaat Burssens among the Luluwa in 1937, is based upon Albert Maesen's field notes of 1954 (notebooks no. 29, p. 36, and no. 30, p. 70, Ethnography Section, Royal Museum for Central Africa, Tervuren). 18.

In Negerkunst und Negerkiinstler (Braunschweig, 1960), Hans Himmelheber, referring to the Luba-Shaba and the Fang (Gabon), intuitively stated that such half-figures end- ing on a point might be intended for a "fetish basket" (p. 399). However, during his visit to the Luluwa in 1939, Himmelheber did not himself see half-figures in context. The woven baskets collected by Albert Maesen in 1954 for the Royal Museum for Central Africa in Tervuren were not large enough to contain any- thing but bishimba and small cibola sculptures (see RG. 53.74-432o and RG. 53-74-4323). 20. Contrary to what Paul Timmermans suggested, it is unlikely that large half- figures in a refined style, such as the one in the Brooklyn Museum of Art (fig. 7), were also meant for women to wear at the belt; see Timmermans (note 9), p. 24. 21. See Louis De Brandt, "Het heelal van den Muluba," Congo 2, 2 (Feb. 1921), pp. 250o-51; and J.-A. Tiarko Fourche and Henri Morlighem, "Architecture et analogies des plans des mondes, d'apris les conceptions indigines du Kasai et d'autres regions," Bulletin de I'Institut royal colonial belge 9, 3 (1938), p. 633. The Luluwa, much like many other Bantu peoples, attribute special cultural meaning to the moon (mwenshi). They believe that the moon cycle influences human fertility; the reappearance of the moon after a moonless period is wel- comed with dances of joy. For further information, see Theodore (Jacques) A. Theuws, De Luba-mens (Tervuren, 1962), pp. 300o-30o5; and Allen E Roberts, "Social and Historical Contexts of Tabwa Art," in Roberts and Evan M. Maurer, eds., The Rising ofa New Moon: A Century of Tabwa Art, exh. cat. (Ann Arbor, Mich., 1985), pp. 1-3. 22. Maesen (note 6), p. 53. The figure in the Art Institute originally had a waxy" patina as well. The only existing photograph prior to its "cleaning," is not clear enough to draw definite conclusions as to the patina's composition. See Sotheby's, New York, Fine African and Oceanic Art (Nov. 14, 1980: lot 227). 23. See August De Clercq, "Lubavolkeren in den spiegel van hun spreuken," Onze Kongo 2, 2 (Sept. 1911), p. 96; Alidoor Samain, "Geschiedenis der Bena Lulua's," Congo 3, 2 (July 1922), p. 232; and Fourche and Morlighem (note 21), p. 637. The Luba-Lubilanji call the original inhabitants and landowners basan- gana and distinguish them from the bakalenga, the rulers from outside the area; see Denolf (note I), pp. 349, 388. 24. The lwendu lea mucipu ritual demonstrates that women have always had an unobtrusive though profound influence on political decisions. When a series of accidents or problems beset several villages at once, the chiefs will jointly perform the cipumba ritual. If this fails to achieve the desired results, the chiefs will turn to elderly women and widows. These women come together in secret at night and hold a "cursing-march" through the village. Almost naked, with the exception of a small loincloth, their bodies painted white with lupemba kaolin, they sing songs and march to a crossroads at the edge of the village. While pronouncing secret spells and formulas, they sacrifice a dog, which is buried at the crossroads. See Badibanga Kantshama and Tshishimbi Katumumonyi, "Le R81e de la femme dans la societe luluwa," Les Cahiers du CEREKA I, I (June 1988), pp. 88-90. 25. In this regard, I believe it useful to refer to the distinction made by Roberts (note 21) in his discussion of the Tabwa between "statement" and "process" arts (pp. io-16, 23). Statement art is concerned with perpetuating an existing order and the glorification of an existing authority, while process art is directed toward making change or solving problems connected with change. Inspired by the anthropologist Victor Turner, Roberts associated statement art with cer- emony as "confirmatory," and process art with ritual as "transformative." Among the Tabwa, statement art "rose in the specific politico-economic condi- tions of the mid-nineteenth century, when Tabwa chiefs sought to consolidate their power" (p. iO). However, among the Luluwa there are no ancestral figures that "represent their lineage and are a focus of prayers to ancestral spirits." 26. A similar distinction between figures made for the whole community by professional sculptors and figures made for individuals by religious specialists was described in the case of the neighboring Chokwe and Songye. See Marie- Louise Bastin, "Les Styles de la sculpture tshokwe," Arts d'Afrique noire 19 (Autumn 1976), p. 17; and Hersak (note 5), pp. 140-6o. 27. The Luluwa's preference for women as art subjects is strongly reminiscent of the Luba-Shaba. See Mary H. Nooter, "Secret Signs in Luba Sculptural Narrative: A Discourse on Power," Iowa Studies in African Art 3 (1990), p. 45; and idem, "Fragments of Forsaken Glory: Luba Royal Culture Invented and Represented (1883-1992) (Zaire)," in Erna Beumers and Hans-Joachim Koloss, eds., Kings ofAfrica: Art and Authority in Central Africa, exh. cat.

Rafael Van Caeneghem's monograph Hekserij bij de Baluba van Kasa* (Brussels, 1955), which for the most part applies to the Luluwa, is probably one of the most thorough studies on this subject. 32.

The erotic conno- tations of the tactile aspect of the scarifications again remind us of the Luba- Shaba. See Mary Nooter Roberts and Allen E Roberts, "Body Memory," in Roberts and Roberts, eds., Memory: Luba Art and the Making of History, exh. cat. (New York, 1996), pp. 111-12. The Luluwa also apply scarifications for healing purposes. See Diambila Luboya (note 15), pp. 165, 169. 34. Von Wissmann (note I), pp. 166-67. Frobenius (note i) mentioned that Chokwe decorations gradually took the place of Kuba elements in scarification, especially among the western Luluwa (p. 13; compare figs. 9 and 34, and see also fig. 430o). At the time of Frobenius's visit, elderly people among the north- ern Luluwa apparently still had elaborate curvilinear nsalu (p. 14 and figs. 9-13). 200 Museum Studies</page></plain_text>
