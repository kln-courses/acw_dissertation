(Kritik der reinen Vernunft, B692; the italics are again mine) Understanding constitutes an object for reason just as the sensory [does] for under standing. To render the unity of all possible operations of the understanding systematic is an affair of reason, [just] as understanding structures and brings under empirical laws the manifold of appearances. The operations of the understanding, however, without schemata of what is sensory, are undetermined', just as the unity of reason in itself is undetermined with respect to the conditions under which and degree to which understanding is supposed to structure and interrelate its concepts. But though no comprehensive schema of systematic unity of all concepts of the understanding can be found in intuition, an analogon of such a schema, namely the idea of the maximum of (sub)division and unification of conceptual knowledge in a principle, can and must be found. Abstract In this essay, I 1 conjecture that Galileo's "book of philosophy" (not "nature") may not be written in Galileo's mathematics, but in Hilbert's and Godel's metamathematics; 2 outline a common metalogical analysis of four 'cogito'-like arguments: Descartes' original, Berkeley's (1979) 'master-argument', and Kant's 'metaphysical' and 'tran scendental' 'deductions'; 3 advocate a 'skeptical'2 form of 'transcendental idealism', which 'locally' dis tinguishes 'experiential' assertions from metatheoretic 'preconditions' for their 'intended' interpretation; 4 and argue (i) that "experience" is a rational but inherently 'problematic' regulative ideal (cf. KdrV, 1956, B100); (ii) that the integrity of'essentially incomplete' but' intelligible' inquiry is the only 'unity' such "experience" could have; and 2 The "skeptics" were "reflective" ("skeptikoi") "seekers" ("zetetikot"'), who "sought" to ".see (more)" ("skeptesthai"). What they "sought" was not 'the' "truth"—ironically, derived in English from a Germanic word for "trust" or "belief—but 'locally' adequate "vantage-points" ("skopoi"skopia") of "insight" ("skemma") and conceptual 'tranquility' ("ataraxia"). *fj Springer</page><page sequence="3">Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 4255 (iii) that 'almost all' 'maximal limits' to which such 'experiential' inquiry might converge would be intrinsically 'unintelligible'. ("Es ist das Mystische....") 1 Introduction 'Neo-Kantians' such as Hermann Cohen and Ernst Cassirer 'relativised' Kant's attempts to 'ground' "Erfahrung" (experience) in an "Architektonik" derived from Newtonian spacetime, in an effort to refine his 'critical' presuppositions, and accom modate more recent mathematical and scientific inquiries into the 'hermeneutics' of differential geometry and mathematical physics undertaken by Gauss, Lobachevsky, Poincare, Lorentz, Hilbert, Einstein and others. In this essay and a pair of sequels I 'relativise' Kant's attempts to explore ascending levels of 'reflective inquiry' and 'regulative principles' in his three Critiques, in an effort to refine his"dialectical","practical" and "teleological" extensions of the first's 'theoretical' "Architektonik" of (Newtonian scientific) 'experience', and accommo date more recent metalogical and metamathematical inquiries into the 'hermeneutics' of concept-formation undertaken by Hilbert, Skolem, Godel, Tarski, Keisler, Scott, Solovay and others. In potted-historical terms, a preliminary rationale for such a ' relativisation', and for the 'skeptical' as well as 'locally transcendental' idealism' I will derive from it, might be sketched as follows. There is a sense—to which people like Cassirer were particularly attentive—in which Kant 'merely' emulated Leibniz' and Leonhard Euler's impassioned attempts to respond to the metaphysical resonance of Galileo's (often-misquoted) suggestion in the Assayer (Opere 6:23:2): that the "vast book" of "philosophy" would be "written in the language of mathematics". More than a century later, working scientists and historians of science among Cas sirer's predecessors and contemporaries such as Hertz, Helmholtz, Duhem and others also attempted to respond to Galileo's dictum in new ways, and Peano, Frege and Rus sell more or less simultaneously formalised the 'neo-Leibnizian' recursive framework of a quantificational logic, which gave rise rather quickly to intriguing "semantic paradoxical" refinements of Kant's "mathematische und dynamische Antinomien". During the twentieth century, 'logicists' and 'logical positivists'—most of them convinced that such paradoxes would be swept aside by a new 'empiricist' synthesis— drew on work of Duhem and others to propose 'reductive' translations of Galileo's "vast book" into rudimentary forms of first-order logic, Russellian type-theory and Zermelian set theory, and sidestep skeptical implications of these antinomies implicit in the work of Skolem and Godel. Against the grain of this (admittedly partial as well as summary ) historical sketch, I wish to suggest that 1 efforts on the part of the logical positivists' more nuanced 'analytical' successors to titrate conventional empiricism with a bit of 'logic' have not yielded a stable response to these and other antinomies (and never will), and propose a conjectural'metalogische Wende', or (in more pretentious emulation of Kant's preface to the first Critique (cf. B XVI ff.)), "Revolution": that 4D Springer</page><page sequence="4">4256 Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 2 future 'books' which record inquiries into boundaries of (inquiries into (boundaries of(.... 'philosophy'))) will be 'written in the languages of metamathematics'; and that 3 the 'texts' of such 'books'will be 'intelligible' (recursively axiomatisable, essen tially incomplete) theories, representable as 'closed' subsets of a 'universal' topo logical and measure-space adumbrated in the 'dyadic' writings of Leibniz (1978), and reintroduced in nineteenth- and twentieth-century guises by Cantor (1933) and Marshall Stone. In opposition to Kant and his empiricist successors' efforts to 'define' or 'demar cate' a' canonical' or'surveyable' "Bereich der Erfahrung" ("range of experience")— via 'critical methods', 'transcendental' analyses or more alembicated ad hoc method ological 'titrations' of 'empiricism' of the sort just mentioned—I will also 4 outline 'locally transcendental' rationales for the epistemic and metaphysical ade quacy of essentially incomplete (first-order) theories; 5 interpret Kant's "kritische Methode" and 'constitutive'/'regulative' distinction as partial anticipations of metalogicians' 'theory'/'metatheory' distinctions; 6 invoke well-studied arguments to argue that such 'local' distinctions and method ological principles generate 'heuristic' iterative hierarchies of concept-formation4, and 7 characterise (but not 'define') "experience" as a 'heuristic', distributive, 'prob lematic' (cf. KdrV, B100) and 'merely regulative' temporal process of ramified 'ascents' within such hierarchies. A few preliminary remarks may anticipate immediate and obvious objections to these proposals, and my eclectic and 'impressionist' use in them of metalogical terms of-art such as 'object-' and 'metatheory'. Philosophers often find such 'technical' terms-of-art reductive; and logicians, for their part, find philosophical uses of them jejune. Perhaps eclectic uses of them fall into the sort of conceptual intermundium C. P. Snow wrote about many years ago. Be that as it may, both the views just cited seem to me prejudices, as the proposals in 2 and 3 make clear. If these proposals have heuristic value, the methodological partitions and preconceptions just cited will erode as needs to 8 provide coherent accounts of 'artificial' as well as 'natural' sentience, and 9 develop natural-scientific analyses of notions such as 'existence', 'complexity', 'randomness' and 'experimental 'isolation'. become more apparent. Kant, in any case, was no more acquainted with 'first-order metatheoretical hierar chies' than he was with 'time-orientable locally Lorentzian manifolds'. He did, how ever, make a number of suggestive attempts to distinguish "regulative" from "consti tutive" applications ("Gebrauche") of broadly problematic 'higher-order' 'principles' and metaphysical assertions (cf. the passage KdrV, B692, quoted at length above). Such distinctions—or superpositions of distinctions—first appeared in B536-B611 of the Transcendental Dialectic. Kant then took them more or less for granted there after, and applied them passim to more abstruse and underdetermined ranges of prac £) Springer</page><page sequence="5">Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 4257 tical (ethical) as well as teleological assertions and principles in Dialectic as well as the second and third Critiques. At a kind of asymptotic limit of such 'principles', he even appealed at various points in all three Critiques and their ancillary texts to the notion of a regulative Ideal—an interpretative Grenzidee which seems to me as 'reflexive', suggestive and conceptually underdetermined as Aristotle's theoria, and shadowy "aggregates" ("Vielheiten") of the sort Georg Cantor aptly called "inkonsistent" ('the' paradoxical "aggregate" of 'all' consistent recursively axiomatisable first-order theories, for example; cf. Cantor 1933, pp. 443-444, reprinted in Van Heijenoort 1967, p. 114). In Sect. 2 below, I will consider certain attempts to coopt and normalise ancient skeptical notions of 'ta phainomena' in ways which might 10 ensure that a fixed 'maximal' realm or "aggregate" of such phainomena 'must' exist, and 11 furnish 'design'-arguments for the 'existence' and 'unicity' of 'experience' (rather than 'god'). In Sections 3 and 4,1 will 12 examine 'pre-theoretical' or 'pre-metalogical' characterisations of "'cogito'-like" arguments; 13 argue that such arguments can be construed as informal prototypes of "'fixed-point arguments"; and 14 'test' these anachronistic characterisations against four historical 'examples': (i) Descartes' "cog/to"-argument, and its stoic and Augustinian antecedents; (ii) Berkeley's more original but strangely ill-regarded "master-argument"; and in somewhat greater detail in the next section, (iii) Kant's "transcendental" and "metaphysical deductions" of the "necessity of the possibility" of "synthetic a priori3 judgments)", and (iv) 'the' allegedly unique structures of "experience" which such judgments "deter mine" when they are "constitutive", and 'underdetermine' when they are "('merely') (regulative)". In Sections 5-8,1 will 15 focus on metalogically syntactical and semantic as well as informal interpretations for the 'unicity' of 'rule'-bound theoretical'experience' Kant hoped to derive from his "transzendentale Deduktion", I will attach little or no epistemic or metaphysical significance in the sequel to 'adverbial' and 'adjectival' readings of the ablative phrase "a priori". I do this in part because (i) there is little or no syntactical distinction between such usages in German; and in part because (ii) there is little or no semantic distinction, at least in Latin, English, French or German, between (iii) 'adjectival' phrases which qualify 'processive' nouns (."judgment" (or "judgement") a priori; "ex cathedra decree"', "off the cuff estimate"', "prima facie plausibility")', and (iv) 'adverbial' phrases which qualify 'processive' verbs and adjectives ("judge" (or "juger") "a priori"', "decree ex cathedra"; "estimate off the cuff"; "prima facie plausible"). *£) Springer</page><page sequence="6">4258 Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 16 argue for metamathematical interpretations of such "rules", and offer 'skeptically transcendental' rationales for the recurrent and interpretive uses of first-order the ories in the metatheoretical hierarchies mentioned in 6 and 7 above, and 17 adduce a modest result of metalogical 'folklore': that no 'faithful' syntactical interpretation of an 'experiential' 'object-theory' can be defined in any metatheory of "concepts of the understanding" (" Verstandesbegriffe") which proves that such an object-theory is consistent. On the one hand, the metamathematical observation in 15 suggests that 18 no metalogically tenable 'transcendental deduction' of the 'existence' of a 'faith ful' interpretation of a provably consistent'experiential' object-theory can be for mulated. 19 On the other, it also suggests (to me at least) that (i) indeterminate as well as underdetermined recourses to 'higher' -order metathe ories, which semantically interpret ('lower' levels or stages of) 'experience' introduce ever-higher-order mathematical as well as metamathematical ana logues of (ii) Kant's 'merely regulative' "intelligibele Ursachen" ('intelligible causes') and "Vernunftbegrijfe" ('concepts of reason') into the object-theoretical processes they interpret, and that (iii) the resulting 'eternal return'—or more precisely, 'eternal recurrence' of alternating 'object'- and 'metatheoretic' ('epistemic'and 'metaphysical') 'boundary-conditions'—is indeed the "fate of reason". But may also be—in several senses—its "grace".... 2 [Reflective inquiry into 'ultimate' limits of [Reflective inquiry into 'ultimate' limits of [Reflective inquiry into 'ultimate' limits of [....]]]] Pyrrhonist skeptics often claimed to follow 'undogmatically' what they called ta phainomena—a Greek neuter plural participle which is usually 'objectified' in (oddly quasi-Kantian) English as 'the appearances'. (It might be more accurately rendered as 'whatever things "seem (to be)"'.) Whatever the translation, relational and intentional implications of such usages— 'seem' or 'appear', under what circumstances, and to what'!—have always fostered 'idealist' interpretations of 'ta phainomena' as ('mere')'intentional objects'. These interpretations, in turn, crossed metaphysical boundaries in interesting ways: 'dogmatic' proto-'cogi'ro'-arguments might be found in them, as well as rationales for (otherwise rather puzzling) eighteenth-century claims that George Berkeley was a 'skeptic'. This ambiguity itself has also been historically generative, in ways genuine 'suspenders-of-judgment' and 'skeptics' ('observers', 'searchers') might applaud. Much of the history of early modern philosophy as well as the science which crys talised out of it might be read as a series of brilliantly informative attempts to coopt &lt;£) Springer</page><page sequence="7">Synthese (2014) ! 91:4253-4314 4259 skeptics' 'phenomenalism' for 'dogmatic' purposes, with the aid of arguments which 'normalised' or 'uniformised' their'phainomena' . Galileo, for example, sought such uniformities in the syntax and semantics of mar/i ematics, in the passage from the Assayer cited earlier. And Descartes, Leibniz, Newton and Berkeley sought them in the hermeneutic (and mathematical) capacities of that great'analyst', 'god'. Hume—even less plausibly, in my view—sought them in the persistence of human "Custom or Habit". Kant, finally, sought to 'deduce' them, in a great secular Newtonian-scientific synthesis whose 'transcendental' adaequatio would be 'com plete' enough to determine (or dispense with) its limiting res (or'Dinge an sich'). Intricately interrelated refinements in the languages of Galileo's mathematical 'book', in short, have provided, and will continue to provide, heuristic ways to explore endless ramifications of 'mere' phenomena. But these 'ramifications' also bring into focus two deeper (and closely interrelated) skeptical reservations, which philosophical efforts to coopt skeptical phainomena have left unanswered (and, in my opinion at least, almost untouched). The first is 1 that postulation of 'unique' metaphysical limits of these practices (whatever they may be called) amount to secular—mathematical and 'physical'—refinements of 'arguments from design'—not for the 'existence' of 'god', but for the existence of 'the' phainomena (a slightly ironic echo, perhaps, of "deus sive natura"). (Notice once again in this context the extent to which 2 the 'structural' and 'constitutive' uniformity and intertranslatability Kant attributed to his 'phenomena' ('Erscheinungen') may be assimilated to 3 the 'structural' and 'constitutive' uniformity and intertranslatability Berkeley attributed to his all-seeing 'God' or "The Author of Nature".) A second and (again in my opinion) deeper reservation derives from one of the ancient skeptics' more acute insights and anti-stoic 'tropoi' ('turns'): 4 that the very notion of'completeness' may therefore be conceptually 'liminal' and 'theory-relative', and in that sense incomplete; and in particular, 5 that conceptual as well as phenomenal 'relationality' and 'intentionality' may be iterable 'eis apeiron'—'into (what is) infinite', and 'into (what is) untried, or unexperienced' (both readings are etymologically defensible). There are essentially two ways to respond to this extended skeptical 'regress' (or 'ascent'), and block 'iteration', 'ramification' and 'indefinition' of the hierarchies to which it gives rise: 6 to 'bound' such iterations in a unique 'limit'", and 7 to 'diagonalise' over them, in allegedly 'canonical' ways which appeal to informal counterparts of metalogical 'fixed-point'-arguments. I will devote the most of the rest of this section to the first, and the next to the second. 'Semantic monist' commitments of any sort to the effect that &lt;£) Springer</page><page sequence="8">4260 Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 8 there 'must' 'exist' one and exactly one 'universal' interpretation of a sufficiently 'comprehensive' (as well as consistent) theory T of 'experiential' phenomena (which must, then, be the 'intended' interpretation of T, if there is one) have traditionally had (at least) three venerable but fallacious arguments or argument forms at their disposal, in my view: 9 'existence-of-maximality'-arguments, often analysable as instances of object theoretic quantifier-error, 10 'existence-of-determination' -arguments, which I will interpret as subtler and more plausible variants of metatheoretic quantifier-error, and finally 11 uniqueness-of-maximality-and-determination'-arguments, which may be analysed as misreadings of informal patterns of metatheoretic Stone-'duality.' In 'existence of maximality'-arguments, for example, one 'derives' the 'existence' of a unique 'maximal' bearer of a property ('maximal' in the sense of some 'practical' or 'metaphysical' ordering) from assumptions (often begged) about the structure of an ordering or hierarchy. One might, for example, 'infer' 12 '(necessary) existence' of a 'maximal' relational entity ('cause'; 'explanation'; 'perfection'; from 13 corresponding 'medial' premises (every 'effect' has a 'cause'; every 'phenom enon' has an 'explanation'; every 'quality' 'has' less 'perfection' than some other; ...). I characterised certain instances of 'existence of maximality'-arguments in 9 and 10 above as 'quantifier-errors'. Kant had no symbolic treatments of such formal 'error' at his disposal, in part because precise formal studies of indefinite quantifier-alternation came very late to 'syllogistic' logic. But his analyses of 'transcendent' "Regressus der Bedingungen" in the Antinomies of the first Critique made it clear that he saw through several 'classical' 'mathemat ical' and 'dynamical' 'existence-of-maximality' - arguments (at least in 'constitutive' contexts: cf„ e.g., KdrV, B692). Subtler and more 'metatheoretic' 'existence-of-determination'-arguments have been adduced since antiquity to justify, in some elusively absolute theory-marginal sense, the 'existence' of a definitive 'criterion of truth', ultimate 'intended interpre tation' or other extratheoretic form of semantic closure. Roughly speaking, such 'existence-of-determination'-arguments derive proto metatheoretic claims about 'final causality' (for example) from tacit or explicit coun terparts of the quantifier-errors 'existence-of-maximality'-arguments applied to their formal' or 'efficient' counterparts. I will call this argument-type in both cases (for lack of any other name) the metathe oretic EA-argument, from a standard logical usage for sentences with existential universal ('exists-for all') quantifier-structure: sentences, in other words, of the form 'there exists an x such that for all y (s(x,y)). (AE- or universal-existential sentences, by contrast, have the form 'for all x there exists a y such that (s(x,y))). Here, for example, are two thumbnail templates of such arguments, formulated in terms of "reasons" rather than "causes" ("aitia" meant both in Aristotle's Greek): Springer</page><page sequence="9">Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 4261 14 if for everything a contextual reason may be found, a noncontextual reason 'must' (allegedly) be found for Everything; 15 if for everything a 'better' reason may be found, a 'best' reason 'must' (allegedly) be found for Everything. More often than not, such EA-arguments were (and still are) formulated in 'elenctic', contrapositive forms. Such an argument played a prominent role, for example, in one of Socrates' 'refutations' of the 'vitiated' semantic relativity Plato (1969) attributed to Protagoras in the Theaetetus, where Socrates fallaciously claimed (in effect) that anyone who rejects the £A-claim, 16 that there 'must' exist a single 'best' objective or intersubjective standard for all human judgments, 'must' also reject a cognate, but quantifier-reversed and weaker, AE-claim, 17 that for all human judgments,'better' contextual standards exist for evaluation of those judgments' truth. More subtly fallacious counterparts of such EA-arguments—to the effect that"not (there exists an x such that for all y s(x,y))" would 'imply' "not (for all x there exists a y such that s(x,y))"—seem to me to enable 'cogito-like' -arguments which are also implicit in Kant's' transcendental deduction', a view I will elaborate in the next section. In a wide range of classical and contemporary metaphysical contexts (justifications of mathematical 'realism', for example), the specious attractiveness of semantic EA arguments is roughly equivalent to the specious attractiveness of 'semantic monisf views they support. When such 'existence'-assertions are formulated in formally or informally 'stronger' theoretical contexts U, however, (as they are in the next section's 'cogito' like arguments), parity of reasoning raises analogous 'criteriaV questions about the semantic credentials of U. And iterations of such questions and responses generate 'natural' informal counterparts of the introduction's 'metatheoretic ascents'. Such 'regressive' hierarchies have typically been blocked by (fallacious as well as semantically equivocal)'modal' EA-assertions that 18 there 'must' 'exist' a 'unique' last metatheory U for T which uniquely interprets [itself], and therefore 'proves' or 'grounds' [its own existence] which modally' beg the semantic-monist desiderata in question (with or without the Godelian 'coding brackets' which 'reduce' semantic 'use' to syntactical 'mention'). As the parenthetical remarks in 16-18 suggest, their existence-claims have also been informally begged on the basis of the very 'comprehensiveness' of the theories in question (an attractive but thoroughly dubious enthymeme, as Cantor saw when he called class-theoretic counterparts of such 'comprehension' "inkonsistent"). It is correct, for example, that a theory in a given fixed language has fewer interpreta tions the more 'complete' it is (the more assertions it decides). This is the fundamental underlying datum of a metalogical pattern called 'Stone duality' (cf„ e.g., Bell and Machover 1977, pp. 141-149). 19 But the same 'dual' analysis also establishes that ■5) Springer</page><page sequence="10">4262 Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 (i) theories in fixed languages have more interpretations the fewer assertions they 'decide' (the more 'abstract' they are); and as a corollary of Craig's Theorem (cf., e.g., Chang and Keisler 1973/1972, pp. 84-87), that (ii) theories in 'augmented' languages have more interpretations when the terms in which their additional axioms are formulated are 'new'. Sometimes, however, cognate 'monist' arguments have been begged on the basis of a subtler, tacitly mcfatheoretic argument which anticipated 'cogito'-like arguments (including Kant's 'transzendentale Deduktionen ) considered in greater detail in the next section: 20 that the position I called semantic monism above 'must' be accepted; for if it is not, then 21 incoherence would be the consequence, and we would not even be able then to query the claim. (Cf. the miniature reconstruction of the Theaetetus-zrgumeni in 16 and 17 above, and related claims that semantic-hierarchical relativism is 'self-refuting', and therefore incoherent). 22 Dialectically attractive though such arguments may seem, they were really lit tle more than 'transcendental' second-order petitiones and quasi-metatheoretic reassertions of the supposition (closely related to 18 above): (i) that any 'sufficiently' 'deep' and 'comprehensive' as well as consistent theory must have a unique interpretation; or its contraposition, (ii) that any 'sufficiently' 'deep' and 'comprehensive' theory without a unique interpretation would be inconsistent. For not only is the 'inference' just sketched refutable, for a wide range of philo sophically relevant theories T (cf. 28-31 below), in any theoretical venue in which it can be expressed. It is essentially an amorphously 'modal' type-raised counterpart of what is being 'deduced'. Subtler but analogously dubious 'existence of determination1 -arguments also appeared at several points in Kant's 'speculative', 'practical' and 'teleological' 'Deduktionen', usually in contrapositive forms. Compare, for example, 23 'Experience' 'must' have a unique 'transcendental' structure. For many instances of it would otherwise be 'merely empirical'. 24 'Practical' judgment 'must' have a unique 'transcendental' structure (at least 'regulatively'). For otherwise, 'our' actions would be governed by 'mere interest'. Notice that 25 the first is a 'critical' paraphrase of the simple but dubious argument that 'expe rience' 'must' be unique, and therefore 'determinate' (for otherwise particular instances of it would be 'mere chance')-, 26 the second is the 'merely' regulative (but comparably anacoluthic) argument that "the' moral order' 'must' be unique, and therefore 'determinate' (for otherwise particular instances of it would be 'mere casuistry'). ft Springer</page><page sequence="11">Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 4263 (In each of the formulations of 23-26, it may also be worth pointing out that"bestim men" in ordinary German means "define" as well as "determine"). Notice also that these arguments have (or at least strongly suggest) a tacit quantifier structure—in the cases of 23 and 25, for example, the 'inference' is that 27 if every particular experience has a metatheoretic 'determination', a master metatheoretic 'determination' of'a//' 'experience' must 'exist'; and in 24, that 28 if every particular action has a metatheoretically defined moral 'valuation', a master- metatheoretic moral 'valuation' of 'a//' actions must 'exist'. (The bold face usages in 27 and 28 and the sequel are intended to reflect 'hypostatic' shifts in each case—from particular object-theoretic 'experiences', for example, to an 'ultimate' self-referential Grenzidee called 'experience'.) Observe, finally, that the quantifier-structures I have imputed to these 'transcen dental' arguments closely resemble that of traditional theological 'arguments from design' (or more accurately, design): 29 if every particular phenomenon has a metatheoretically defined 'design', a (numi nous) master-metatheoretic 'design' of 'all' phenomena must 'exist'. In none of these limit-arguments (or 'limit' -arguments) could one seriously argue that the inference in question is (or 'must' be) metalogically valid. Whether any of them is a tenable 'deduction' in some broader forensic sense of the word is open to question. But any hypostatic 'limit' of such senses would be deeply 'problematic', in Kant's usage. Consider, for example, the analogies in 23-28. If they are ('forensically') 'deducible' in some 'limiting' hypostatic sense, why not their 'physico-theological' counterparts in 29 as well? Finally, one might perhaps hope to recover the validity of such 'deductions' with the aid of 'uniqueness-of-maximality-and-determination'-arguments (cf. 11 above). If, for example, semantic interpretations of theoretical designs (of whatever sort) formed (what is called) a 'direct system', mathematical arguments would indeed yield a unique 'direct limit' of such a system. A good historical case can be made that Platonic, Stoic, Neoplatonic and other 'dogmatic' metaphysicians believed that theoretical 'cognition' 'must' be directed with respect to mutual consistency. But if such 'cognition' is 'intelligible', in a sense outlined below, it is not. To see this, call a 'philosophically relevant' (first-order) theory T 'intelligible' if and only if it is 30 'parsable' (its language is countable, and the metatheoretically defined set of Godel-codes of its axioms is recursive-, roughly speaking, it has an arithmetically decidable 'axiomatisation'); and 31 'autological': (it syntactically interprets a theory of finite sets or theory of arith metic 'strong' enough to include a mathematical-induction scheme which permits 'encoding' of its proofs', roughly speaking, it has an arithmetically enumerable 'proof-structure'). The 'philosophical relevance' of &lt;£) Springer</page><page sequence="12">4264 Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 32 'payability' is that no inscrutable metatheoretic 'oracle' (a word actually used in recursion theory) would be needed to recognise the theory's premises; and of 33 'autologicality' that the theory can trace out, step by step, its consequence relations, and pose (but not, Godel discovered, answer)'internally' coded counter parts of semantic questions about 'itself ("Am 'I' 'consistent"'?"Do 'I' 'exist'"?) (cf., once again the first paragraph of the KdrV, cited above). Together, these two conditions—which are most readily and neutrally formulated in first-order set- or class-metatheories which permit semantic interpretations of T— imply that Godel's incompleteness-theorems apply to T. For from Godel's insights, it follows then that if one 34 partially orders a 'system' St of (metatheoretically) consistent'intelligible' exten sions of a given 'intelligible' theory T by setting T &lt; T" if and only if T' is a subtheory ofT", Then 35 'inverse' (but not 'direct)' limits or maximal 'threads' of the system St exist (they are the 'models' or semantic interpretations of T) but 36 such 'limits'—or 'worlds' in which T 'holds'—are never unique. For any such T, in fact, there will be as many such semantic interpretations of T as there are real numbers in the (tacit metatheory's) set-theoretic continuum. Admittedly, the conditions in 32 and 33 are 37 intrinsically metatheoretic with respect to T. But they also 38 apply equally well to the set- or c/a.s.v-metatheories just mentioned, as well as a wide variety of other theories which are not first-order. Efforts to make sense of first- and non-first-order theories T would give rise quite naturally, therefore, to 39 'interleaved' or 'interpolated'first-order semantic hierarchies, in which every con sistent theory—first-order or not—would 'eventually' find an interpretation. Such hierarchies offer a first rationale for enlargement of Galileo's 'book' to the metatheoretic compendia of interleaved commentaries proposed above, in which paths of inquiry would not be directed, but ramify ad indefinitum. Would inquiry in such hierarchies be dialectically clever, but 'practically','specu latively' and 'teleologically' jejune, as Socrates suggested Protagoras' sophistry would have to be? In the following sections, I will continue to argue that it would not. 3 Reflective inquiry and 'transcendent' "[self]-validation" As I mentioned in Sect. 2, one way to respond to dispel skeptical hierarchies is to 'bound' them in (allegedly) unique and determinate 'limits', and another to 'diago nalise' over them in (allegedly) stable and determinate 'fixed-points'. To clarify the latter, I will begin with a sense in which Kant (I believe) proposed 5) Springer</page><page sequence="13">Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 4265 1 a 'cogito'-like fixed-point argument (or'necessity-of-the possibility of'-argument) to 'refute' skepticism about the 'necessity' of a 'uniquely' 'presupposed' structure of a generic 'self,' whose 'intentions' he identified with 'Erkenntnis uberhaupf (the ' metaphysical deduction', usually associated with Kant's claims for the 'com pleteness' of his 'logical' categories); and 2 a second ('cogito'-like) fixed-point argument (or 'necessity-of-the possibility of argument) to 'prove' that a uniquely 'schematised' cognitive structure 'must' 'determine' isomorphic patterns in the 'appearances' it 'must' 'experience' (cf. the 'transcendental deduction', usually associated with wider templates of 'intu ition' and 'the understanding' which also 'determine' 'the' structures of space and time). Put somewhat differently, Kant 3 'deduced' from the first fixed-point argument above the 'necessity of the possi bility' of a uniform structure for 'the' mind's (and 'the minds") 'cognition' (the 'existence' of which Berkeley had attributed to 'God', and the agnostic Hume later acknowledged in the appendix to the Treatise he had essentially begged); and 4 'deduced' from the second fixed-point argument the 'necessity of the possibility' of Hume's petitio, as a 'unique' 'precondition' or 'presupposition' for the 'apodeictic' 'necessity' of four-dimensional Newtonian spacetime (which Kant-—I will later argue—tacitly acknowledged in the third Critique he had essentially begged). In effect, I am arguing that Kant believed he had devised more innovative 'dialec tical' Augustinian/Cartesian fixed-point-arguments, which would modulate 5 assertions a 'Newton of the Moral Sciences' had made about highly normalised forms of "Custom or Habit" into 6 more rigorous assertions an 'architect' of a 'Copernican/Newtonian Turn' hoped to make about an even more highly normalised "Architektonik" 'der' Erfahrung. After I develop this interpretation (which can be considered and accepted or rejected in informal, non-'metalogical' terms), I will 7 consider straightforward but non-Kantian metamathematical glosses of "deduc tion" proposed in 1, and 8 prove a straighforward metalogical proposition which bears on the tenability of metalogical analogues of the 'results' Kant thought he had achieved, as well as the 'transcendental methods' he devised to 'deduce' them. I will begin with an attempt to explain what I meant above by a '"cogito'-like" argument", and outline the four historical examples mentioned in the essay's intro duction. I will call an (formal or informal) argument'"cogito'-like" if it 'satisfies' the fol lowing conditions (cf. 10 through 15 below). The argument employs 9 notions (tacitly or explicitly) posited in a 'theoretical' framework T and 'wider' 'theoretical' framework U; and 10 assertions about'existence' and 'interpretation' of T and notions in T, which may be formulated in T as well as the 'wider' framework U. Springer</page><page sequence="14">4266 Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 Moreover, the argument's 11 'derivations' and 'demonstrations' of assertions in T (from 'obvious' or 'univer sally granted' 'first principles' of T) also hold in U; and its 12 'epistemic' and 'ontological' assertions about what is 'conceivable' in T or'exists' in T (e.g.) can bz formulated in T as well as U, and sometimes 'proved' or 'refuted' (from equally 'obvious' 'first principles') in U; Finally, the argument (ostensibly) 13 'derives' the 'epistemic' and/or 'onto logical' assertion 4&gt; about T from 'first prin ciples' of U (or 'confutes' the 'skeptical' negation £ of $ in U); and 14 'concludes' from this that the 'epistemic' and/or 'ontological' assertion $ is also 'derivable' from 'firstprinciples' of T (soX 'must' also be 'refutable' in T). Admittedly, this 'definition' is long and convoluted, but so, I would argue, were its historical prototypes. Part of my larger argument in the sequel will be that conceptual (or 'critical') 'theory/metatheory'-distinctions offer the only tenable remedies for such convolutions and ambiguities. The best informal rationale or plausibility-argument for the characterisation may be the reconstructions it provides for study of the three or four well-known 'argu ments' from the history of early modern philosophy, mentioned earlier: Descartes' (1973-1978) "cogito"-argument, Berkeley's 'master argument' and the two best known Kantian 'transcendental arguments' (or 'deductions') in the Analytic of the first Critique. Before offering these reconstructions, I would like to apologise in advance for my particularly extravagant use in them of single ('scare' )-quotation-marks. They are not, I believe, an affectation. For my underlying point in 15 through 26 below will be that such 'scare-quoted' nouns, pronouns, adjectives and adverbs may be subjected to conceptually relevant forms of metalogical relativisation and metatheoretic ascent. In the case of Descartes' (not entirely) original "cogito", 15 T is 'my' theory of 'myself'; 16 U is 'god"s counterpart of 'this' theory; and 17 $ is an assertion of the 'ontological' 'existence' and unique interpretability of 'my' theory of 'myself' (which 'I' had epistemically 'doubted'). In the case of Berkeley's (more original) 'master argument', 18 T is 'the' (theoretical) 'idea' of a given 'external object'; 19 U is 'the' theoretical framework in which 'god' or another 'spirit' confers 'exis tence' on the 'object' of T by 'perceiving' (or 'conceiving', or 'interpreting') it; and 20 asserts the 'existence' or 'interpretability' of the 'object' of this well-defined 'idea' T (the complex 'object' determined by a "mite'"s idea of its "foot", for example, in one of his more whimsical examples). In the case of Kant's (implicitly 'Cartesian') metaphysical deduction', &lt;£} Springer</page><page sequence="15">Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 4267 21 T is 'the' theoretical framework of 'forms of intuition' and 'categories of the understanding' which 'constitute' 'Erkenntnis' ("knowledge"); 22 U is 'the' ('blofi regulative') "systematische Einheit alter moglichen empirischen Verstandeshandlungen" (('merely' regulative) "systematic unity of all possible actions of the understanding") which Kant characterised as an "affair of reason" "Geschaft der Vernunft" at KdrV, B692, cited above); and 23 4&gt; asserts 'the' 'unity','completeness' and consequent'existence' of21's 'forms of intuition' and 'categories of the understanding' T which 'determine' or'constitute' corresponding 'interpretations' of 'experience'. In the case of Kant's (implicitly 'Newtonian') 'transcendental deduction', 24 T is 'the' theoretical framework or conceptual structure of 'the' 'necessary' Newtonian-scientific 'preconditions' which 'constitute' 'Erkenntnis'; 25 U (once again) is 'the' {'blofi regulative') "systematische Einheit aller moglichen empirischen Verstandeshandlungen"; and 26 $ asserts 'the' 'existence', 'completeness' and 'transzendentale Einheit" of 24's Newtonian-scientific 'preconditions' for the framework T, which 'determine' or 'constitute' unique 'interpretations' of this framework in 'experience'. In each of the cases just canvassed, I will argue, the assertion 4&gt;'s initial plausibility derives from a dual premise: 27 that such an implicitly 'metatheoretic' U 'exists'; and 28 that U's 'attributes' ensure that all the relevant assertions of 'existence', 'unicity' and 'interpretability' of T encoded in $ are 'provable' or 'derivable' or 'demon strable'in U: In Descartes' case, these premises followed (via the 'diagonal' pons asinorum of the 'circle') from the veracity and 'perfection' of (Augustine's, Anselm's and Aquinas') 'god' (1986; 1978). In Berkeley's, their counterparts followed from the kindness and hermeneutic agility of a somewhat more 'personal' Anglican 'god', whose 'existence' he inferred from a 'design'-argument. In Kant's case, 29 the ('merely' regulative) 'existence' of the theoretical framework U (a secular Vernunftidee) is effectively secured by a 'critical' 'design'-argument, and 30 the 'existence', ('transcendental') 'interpretability'and ('constitutive') 'unity' of 'experience' $ attributes to T is secured in U by the 'unicity', 'completeness' and 'universality' Kant hoped he had 'deduced' from 31 the 'unicity', 'completeness' and 'universality' of T's 'forms' and 'categories' (in the 'metaphysical' deduction), and 32 the 'unicity', 'completeness' and 'universality' of the theoretical framework T of Newtonian science (in the 'transcendental' deduction). Whatever the merits of such "cogito'-Yike arguments'" assertions that the'existence' - and 'unicity'-claims 4&gt; are 'demonstrable' in U, I will also argue that 33 the 'probative' force and philosophical purchase of these arguments derive from tacit 'metatheoretic' assumptions in each case that [4&gt;'s demonstrability in U] &lt;£] Springer</page><page sequence="16">4268 Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 implies [its demonstrability in T] (for metalogical counterparts of these assertions, cf. 4.6 and 4.32 below). Shamans and high priests have told us since time immemorial, after all (but without philosophical 'proof'), that 'gods' and other higher 'unities' U assure us 'we' exist, and that our 'experiential' theories T 'make sense' in such U. The 'philosophical' (as opposed to confessional) 'purchase' of 'cogito'-like argu ments, by contrast, is to formulate subtler and more 'secular''experiential' conceptual apparatus T which 'provably'ensure us that 'we' exist, and that T 'makes sense' in T. The underlying project of 'cogito'-like arguments, in other words, is to broaden conceptual and sensory 'experience' so that it 'validates' and semantically 'interprets' 'itself'. Be that as it may, the relevance of the tacit premise 33 in the case of Descartes' "cogito" seems to me supported, or at least illustrated, by 34 the centrality of Descartes' otherwise abstruse (and classically quite 'dogmatic') attempts to secure a 'criterion of truth', where 'truth' is identified de facto with 'demonstrability in U'); 35 the tenacity of his efforts to 'demonstrate' that the epistemically and ontologically more 'perfect' 'god' (or more 'divine' 'theory' U) does not'conceal' such 'truths' from its less comprehensive 'image and likeness' T; and 36 the swift emergence and enduring prominence of debates about the rhetorically begged 'Cartesian circle', construed in the present context as a kind of 'meta verification' (whose formal counterpart would have to be formulated in a metathe ory for U) that [demonstrability o/4&gt; in U] implies [demonstrability of $ in T]. (In the case of 35, for example, the 'Cartesian circle' may be paraphrased as a 'fixed point'-assertion that "'god' (or U) does not deceive us that ['god' (or U) does not deceive w.v]"). In Berkeley's "master argument", the "tacit premise" sketched in 18-20 above is a tacit conflation of 37 what 'you' or 7' or T (may hypothetically be posited or 'thought' to) "perceive" or "conceive" in T ("[that] a tree ['exists'] with 'nobody by to perceive it'"); and 38 what 'god' (or U) (presumably) "perceives" or "conceives" about this thought experimental framework T (that "you yourself [did] perceive it all the while"). To see that this 'tacit premise' is problematic in Berkeley's system, recall that a finite "spirit" can only have a "notion" of (but cannot "perceive" or "conceive") another "spirit'"s "perception" or "conception". The 'master argument's triumphantly adduced auxiliary assumption, therefore— that "you yourself did perceive it all the while"-—may or may not be 'demonstrable' in U. But is not even 'expressible', much less 'demonstrable' in T, on Berkeley's own principles. (In quasi-Berkeleyan terms, T might at most have a semantically underdetermined 'notional' 'sign' for this 'second-order' self-referential assertion.) The relevant $ in the 'master argument'—which seems to have little intrinsically to do with "trees"—might also be paraphrased as an assertion that "I" (or "you" or 'god') "perceive" or "conceive (something)" (and thereby confer 'existence' on it). &lt;£) Springer</page><page sequence="17">Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 4269 If so, then ('idealist') assertions that such 'intentional' acts confer'existence' might be interpreted as natural generalisations of ('rationalist') ' cogito-arguments'. Berkeley, finally—who acutely critiqued the contradictions implicit in semiformal attempts to 'define' Leibniz' 'infinitesimals' and Newton's 'fluxions'—also 39 offered interesting ('sign'-theoretic)'coherentist' reasons to accept the framework of Newtonian science, in the form of 40 a grand scheme of intersubjective interpretations between 'all' 'our' (otherwise disparate) 'signs', "perceptions" and "conceptions" coordinated by his kindly Anglican god (the 'design'-argument mentioned earlier). To the extent Kant acknowledged that (what he called)"Erkenntnis"—which is not quite the same as 'knowledge' ("Wissen") in German—might 'presuppose' secular forms of intersubjective interpretation between cognitive agents' 'Begriffe' (and did not simply beg their conceptual or intersubjective 'Einheit'), 41 there may therefore have been something 'Berkeleyan' about the 'design' argument I attributed to Kant in 29 and 30 above; and 42 Berkeley might offer another conceptual bridge from Descartes' and Leibniz' 'rationalisme' to Kant's "Kritizismus", despite the latter's 'refutation' of his "schwarmender Idealismus". In the next section, I will consider in some detail the senses in which Kant's "deduc tions" seem to me to fit 'cogito'-like templates of the sort sketched above. Here I will close with a suggestion that his 'transzendentale Methode' in general (and the 'deductions' in particular) fit another, complementary 'cogito'-like template, or prescription: that of an Archimedean' - or'fixed-point' confutation of 'regressive' skeptical 'doubt'. More precisely, I will attempt to interpret this 'Methode' as a 'dialectical' 43 'proof' (in some sense) that (something called) 'synthetic a priori cognition' is a 'proof' (or 'sufficient reason', or transcendental' 'Archimedean point') for [itself ]; or, in more or less equivalent 'adverbial' terms, as a collection of roughly cognate 'proofs' that 44 cognitive agents synthetically a priori 'prove' or 'determine' that [cognitive agents synthetically a priori 'prove' or 'determine'] (cf. the gloss of the 'Cartesian circle' following 36 above). For if not, 45 [cognitive agents fail synthetically a priori to 'prove' or 'determine' that [cognitive agents fail synthetically a priori to 'prove' or 'determine' that [cognitive agents fail synthetically a priori to 'prove' or 'determine' that [cognitive agents fail synthetically a priori to 'prove' or 'determine' that [.... ]]]]. ■£) Springer</page><page sequence="18">4270 Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 But such a "Regressus" (a 'descending' variant of ancient academic skeptics' 'ascending' 'problem of the criterion') would (Kant believed) 46 render 'synthetic a priori' 'proof or 'determination' 'impossible' (i.e. counter factual, Kant's standard 'critical' gloss of'impossibility' in such contexts; cf., e.g., B 101, 137 and 628). But 47 this—Kant argued—would be 'absurd'. For 'synthetic priori' 'determination' is not only regulative (and in this sense 'possible'). It is also "konstitutiv" (and in this sense 'necessary'). For its 'constitutivity' is instantiated by the ['synthetic a priori' capacity (Vermogen) to formulate this argument] ....' In effect, I believe, such a 'fixed-point'-argument may be construed as an attempt reconfigure 45's non-well-founded 'descent' into a kind of'transcendental circle', in which the T of 33 above 'validates' T's 'experience' in T. (More of this later.) In metalogical opposition to such metaphysical 'circles' (attempts to 'collapse' 'regresses' such as the one which would otherwise emerge in 36), I will argue in the next section that 48 notions of 'doubt','certainty', 'perception', 'conception', knowledge', 'synthetic ity', 'apriority', 'cognition' and 'determination', for example, cited earlier—are liminal', in the sense that they straddle the 'limines' or 'thresholds' of whatever they 'intend' or 'qualify'. In quasi-Kantian terms, one might call them 'locally' or ('situationally') "transzendent". Alternatively, in language Georg Cantor introduced in a letter to David Hilbert more than a century later, one might call them 'locally' or 'situation ally' "inkonsistent". To the extent one can make metalogical counterparts of such notions precise (more possible than many readers might think), [selfjreferential attributions of such proper ties 'generate' 'semantic paradoxes' and corresponding patterns of iterated metathe oretic 'ascent'and (what might be called) intentional 'descent'. In Kant's case—and in particular in the allusion to "[this very argument]" just above—such notions will only be 'counterfactual' (or non-'experiential'). They will be ('locally') transzendente Vernunftideen, or perhaps more accurately ' Vernunftpradikate' (predicates of'pure reason'). In plain German: "'die' Rahmenbedingungen der Kantischen Argumente iiber 'die' Bedingungen 'der''Moglichkeit' 'der' Erfahrung sindlauter Vernunftideen. .." (In even plainer English: "'the' boundary-conditions of Kantian arguments about 'the' conditions of 'the' 'possibility' of experience are a bunch of ideas-of-reason....") 'Worse' (or in my view, 'better')-, metatheoretically defined counterparts of such 'frame'- or 'boundary-conditions' will always be 'locally transzendent', in relative terms, with respect to any given 'level' of what they (e.g.) 'doubt', 'conceive','cognise' or 'determine' to 'be the case'. In particular, if one tried to 'halt', with Kant and his neo-Kantian successors, the 'object-theoretic descents' in 44 and 45—or the 'metatheoretic ascents' they mirrored—in an effort to 'define' 'experience', 49 the terms in which one claimed to do so would become (locally) 'transcendent' with respect to any fixed 'neo-Kantian' object-theoretic notion of'experience' one •£) Springer</page><page sequence="19">Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 4271 might propose, in the sense that 50 the terms in which one proposed to'define' a given'critically' demarcated notion of 'experience' would not only fail to be 'experiential'; they would be 'experientially' inexpressible, and 'paradoxically' as well as 'conceptually' underdetermined by what they defined. 4 Reflective inquiry and "das Schicksal der Vernunft" In this section, I will assimilate the 'locality' and essential incompleteness of 'critical' inquiry to Kant's 'fate of reason', poignantly characterised above in the opening lines of the Kritik der reinen Vernunft. I will attempt in this section to 1 interpret more carefully the 'begged' implication in section 3 for the "'cogito'-like" reconstructions of Kant's 'transcendental' method and 'deductions'; 2 characterise the views and analyses attributed above to Descartes, Berkeley and Kant as 'idealisms' with successively broader and more 'deductive ranges' of what is 'conceived' in 'experiential' T and 'higher' U; 3 offer 'skeptical' as well as 'transcendental' arguments for assimilation of such analyses ''assertions' and 'demonstrations' in T and U to counterparts of them in first-order metatheoretical hierarchies; 4 review well-known proofs that metalogical counterparts of the 'dialectical' infer ences and implications in 3.14 and 3.33 are either 'locally' refutable or 'locally' inexpressible in such hierarchies' 'theoretical frameworks' T; and 5 adduce (and sketch the proof of) a simple but relevant bit of metalogical'folklore': that no 'faithful' interpretation of a 'weaker' theory T can be found in a 'higher' theory U which is 'strong' enough to prove the consistency of T. The breadth of the "Rechtmafiigkeit" (cf. B116) Kant associated with "Deduktion" is well-known, as is the notion's association with 'mediated' forms of reasoning (cf. B761), and the role of "transzendentaler Deduktion" in the (curiously ' subsumptive' or' reflective' )"Erklarung der Art, wie sich Begriffe a priori auf Gegenstande beziehen konnen" (B117). In what follows, I will draw in fact on the latter quotation to argue 6 that (ostensibly) more latitudinarian notions of Kantian 'deduction' do, after all, tend to close down on straightforward first-order consequence-relations in metatheoretical hierarchies which interpret such 'predication' and 'subsumption'; and that a good way to sustain Kantian 'critical' insights (between the 'T's and 'U's of Sect. 3, for example) might be to 7 'localise' and iterate them, in the form of 'locally critical' theory/metatheory distinctions; 8 exploit them as generators of'heuristic' notions of object- and concept-formation in the metatheoretic hierarchies they generate; and &lt;£) Springer</page><page sequence="20">4272 Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 9 interpret their unending extensions and ramifications in such hierarchies as 'reg ulative' traces and counterparts of Kant 's "fate of reason" ("Schicksal der Ver nunft"). I suggested earlier that Kantian or quasi-Kantian reconstructions of the generic ' cogiur-V\kc assertions 4&gt; in Sect. 3 might be 10 ('metaphysically' 'deductive') claims that 'the' 'completeness' and 'unity' of 'forms of intuition' and 'categories of the understanding' 'determine' (or 'con stitute') T and its 'unique' isomorphic counterparts in 'experience'; and 11 roughly cognate 'transcendentally' 'deductive' claims that 'the' 'completeness' and 'transzendentale Einheit" of 'intuition' and 'understanding' 'determine' (or 'constitute') T and its 'unique' isomorphic counterparts in 'experience'. I also suggested that all of the four 'cogito-like' arguments outlined in Sect. 3 decompose into 12 (relatively uninteresting) 'demonstrations' that interpretations of 'thought', 'per ception' and 'conception' in T (may) 'exist' in 'higher-order' frameworks U; and 13 (interesting but begged) 'demonstrations' that corresponding interpretations of 'thought', 'perception' and 'conception' in T ('must') 'exist' in the 'experiential' framework T. In his 'metaphysical' and 'transcendental' variants of these arguments in the Ana lytik, Kant sought to work in a resolutely secular U, and dispense with conceptual 'mathematical' and 'dynamical' 'physicotheological' arguments in his 'constitutive' rationales for the "transcendental unity" of "Erkenntnis" to "Erfahrung". Yet he insisted over and over again in the Dialektik of the first Critique that the "systematic unity"of'Reason' at KdrV, B692—the theoretical framework I have called U—'must' remain a 'merely regulative' but conceptually significant "Aufgabe", an Ideal which z.ieht uns hinan (so to speak) at the marginal horizons of such (scientific) 'experience'. Logicians familiar with the semantic purchase of (relatively)' higher-order metathe ories' such as U know that part of this 'purchase' is their 'ability' to 'define' 'internally canonical' interpretations of'weaker' subtheories such as T, and it is in that sense that such U may be 'locally' 'strong' enough to account for 'scientific' 'boundary conditions' of 'experience' and 'experimentation)'. But they also know, on the evidence of Godel's results, if nothing else (cf. the proof of 38 below) that 14 the'strength' of such theories is 'theory-relative' (or at least theory-mediated')— if one stipulates that U is '(intrinsically) stronger' than T iff U proves the con sistency of T, the (nonlinear) ordering of such 'strength' is neither reflexive nor symmetric. In particular, the [self]-sufficiency (and implicit [self]-validation) of Laplace's famous remark (quoted third-hand in Victor Hugo's autobiography) that "[s]ire,je '•fj Springer</page><page sequence="21">Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 4273 n'avait pas besoin de cette hypothese{-la)" might therefore have to be more carefully calibrated than Laplace knew. If all Laplace meant was that he had no 'need' of (secular or numinous) versions of (what Kant called) "the unconditioned" ("das Unbedingte"), he was quite right. But if he (or Kant) meant 15 that his own or anyone else's intelligible formalisations of mathematics or math ematical physics could uniquely 'determine' their own (mathematical or concep tual) boundary-conditions, much less their own 'intended' semantics, he was subtly but deeply wrong (and Descartes, Berkeley and Kant with him). In the sequel, therefore, I will also continue to interpret 16 Kant's 'transcendental deductions' as failed attempts to find such an 'Archimedean poinf of [selt]-validation on the rasor's edge between Newtonian science and its elusive 'hypotheses' (which Newton had tried to disavow); and 17 the second and third Critique's qualifications and relativisations of such claims as tacit admissions that his efforts to locate this 'transcendental' limit had turned out to be more 'problematic' (a Kantian term of art) than he had hoped. Whatever the merits of Sect. 3's "'cogito'-like arguments", therefore, the tacit petitio of their claims that 18 [demonstrability of semantic assertions $ about T in U] 'followed' from [demonstrability o/such semantic assertions 4&gt; about T in T] remained present in Kant's Architektonik. In the remarks following 13 in this section, I appealed to analogies with metalogical hierarchies which have run in the background throughout the essay's first two sections, and it is past time to offer the rationale for these analogies. It would follow from the heuristic principles I have sketched that no one—on pain of circularity or semantic paradox—could claim to offer a 'hypothesis-free' 'deduction' that first-order 'deductions' (much less metatheoretical hierarchies which employ it) are 'canonical'. One can, however, offer 'skeptical' variants of Kant's 'critical' or 'transcendental analysis' which suggest that 'eventual' recourse to first-order theories in 'ramified' metatheoretical hierarchies may be ineluctable. The 'analysis' I have in mind is 19 'skeptical' in that it 'suspends judgment' between (alternative interpretations of) 'abstract logics' and their 'consequence relations'; 20 'critical' in that it postulates (on pain of semantic paradox) theory/metatheory distinctions to 'make (syntactical) sense' of such interpretations; 21 'transcendental' in that recurrent theory/metatheory-distinctions of this sort'reg ulate' (but do not 'determine') (semantic) efforts to assert such alternative inter pretations' 'existence'; 22 'eventual' in that such interpretive predications of semantic 'existence' may 'even tually' and 'economically' be adjudicated mfrst-order metatheoretic set- or class theories', Springer</page><page sequence="22">4274 Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 23 'ramified' in that 'partial' interpretations of any 'intelligible' theories which 'encode' their own syntax and 'consequence-relations' in 'inductive' ways branch without limit; and finally 24 'ineluctable' in that'all' sufficiently 'finitary' theories introduced to examine and interpret other theories in such hierarchies are semantically indistinguishable from first- order counterparts, by a remarkable theorem of Per Lindstrom. In somewhat plainer English: 25 the simplest and most 'natural' way to understand abstruse theoretical frameworks in metatheoretical hierarchies is to interpolate set- or class-theories which interpret them; 26 'intelligible' set- or class-theories which satisfy finitarity'-conditions are seman tically indiscernible (via Lindstrom's theorem) from their first-order counterparts; 27 hierarchies of recursively axiomatisable first-order languages offer flexible, com municable and ontologically neutral'common languages' md frameworks of inter pretation for 'rational'discourse-, and finally, 28 such languages' 'ontological neutrality'(cf. 27) and 'skeptical' 'suspension of judgment' (cf. 19) offer 'natural' conceptual interpretations of Kantian "Reinheit" and "apriority", as well as physicists' (equally elusive) ideals of'controlled exper imentation' and 'experimental isolation'. There are many reasons, of course, to dismiss such analogical conjectures and 'skeptical transcendental arguments' out of hand. The first is that'ordinary language' is 'obviously' not first-order, so claims that 'it' 'is' are absurdly and obviously reductive. Of course 'ordinary language' is not first-order, at any given level of (potential) syntactic and semantic interpretation. My conjectures in 19-24 above—which I clearly cannot 'prove' ('Chinese rooms' are lurking about here somewhere)—are 29 that the limitless syntactical and semantic complexities of 'ordinary linguistic' usages may be interpretable. in comparably limitless syntactical and semantic complexities of first-order hierarchies', ('hand over hand', so to speak); and 30 that 'sufficiently' skilled speakers of'ordinary languages' often improvise 'locally' adequate finitary substructures of such hierarchies in 'real time' (otherwise-—as non-native speakers well know—their interlocutors will 'give up' on them). A second objection is that one has seen unconvincing versions of such views before—in the writings of logical positivists, for example, or in 'Quinean' assertions that 'everything' 'can be expressed' in 'set theory'. On the account I wish to defend,'experience'—including linguistic experience—is certainly much broader than anything I am aware of in the writings of logical positivists. It is also broader than "set theory", or at least any particular set theory. For 'set theories' (in my view at least) are just ontologically neutral way-stations for attempts to talk about'predication'—what Kant would have called "Subsumtion", or "das Besondere als enthalten unter dem Allgemeine zu denken" in B XXVI and B XXXII of the third Critique. "£) Springer</page><page sequence="23">Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 4275 And 'critical' theory/metatheory distinctions, I would argue, are inevitable con comitants of attempts to iterate such 'predication', and heuristic metatheories can be interpolated in such iterations almost at will. Such iterations occur 'naturally' in hierarchies of 'stronger' (possibly non-first order) metatheories, with the proviso that assertions about such metatheories' consis tency are 'liminal' and remain open to further ('skeptical') inquiry. The most 'natural' way to clarify such consistency-questions, in turn, is to seek semantic interpretations for them in yet-'stronger' theories of 'predication'. And the simplest and most'natural' venues for such searches are 'stronger' as well as linguis tically augmented first-order set-theories. Russell's early type-hierarchies were 'linear' and begged questions about 'the' limits of their 'types' in ways which were anticipated by his own paradox and Cantor's observations about'Inkonsistenz', and were clarified later by metalogical observations of Skolem, Godel and Henkin. Wondrously subtle refinements of such hierarchies have been and will continue to be devised. But the more open and flexible they were, the more 'natural' their interpretations in the aforementioned linguistically enhanced set-theories became. Such remarks are obviously 'heuristic' and subject to correction and revision. But they may make a provisional case for a conjecture outlined earlier: that'everything' we talk about and endeavor to interpret 'is' (or 'may as well be') 'eventually' first-order. In defense of this heuristic conjecture, finally, I would 31 appeal again to the openness, generality and intensional interpolability of metathe oretic hierarchies, given that extensional canvasses of potentially infinite evidence are beyond finitary "seekers'" ken; and 32 appeal finally to their pragmatic utility, in 'ordinary' as well as metaphysi cal'discourse', as naturally 'interleaved' venues for critique and interpretation of everyday ' intentionality'. (My favorite thumbnail-critique of this sort is Wittgenstein's (1972) uncharacter istically disarming remark in Uber Gewifiheit (UG, 12), that "[m]an vergifit eben immer den Ausdruck 'Ich glaubte, ich wtifite es"' ("one always forgets the expression 7 thought / knew'"....) The 'subreptively' self-referential problem Kant sought to solve may be charac terised as follows. A genuinely 'a priori' 'Deduktion' would have to be 33 a conceptually idealised or 'isolated' (thought)-'experiment', independent of 'all' 'experience' and 'all' 'external' ('merely empirical') verification; 34 a 'deductive' act (in accordance with some sort of generalised 'consequence' relation) invariant under 'all' changes of metatheoretic boundary-conditions; and most 'problematically' (once again) 35 a 'fixed point','Archimedean point' or ' self -validating' 'demonstration' (in the sense once again of some sort of generalised 'consequence' relation), with respect to 'all' attempts to 'refute' it or 'call it into question'. (It might also be assumed to 'prove' its own ['provability']—a curiously unprob lematic assumption in metalogical contexts, as Lob observed (cf. Smorynski 1977, &lt;£) Springer</page><page sequence="24">4276 Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 p. 845), but one which also turns out to have little 'transcendental' force or proof theoretic purchase). What it could not 'prove', or even 'expressremained, as before, its own 'exis tence','interpretability' or 'consistency', much less the 'necessity' of the 'possibility' of its own 'existence', 'interpretability' or 'consistency'.... (Kant's cogent observa tions about the ontological ambiguity of'existence' might be more relevant to 'tran scendental' analyses than he realised). To the extent such 'proofs' were truly 'isolated', for example, 'we' could not even adduce stable thought-experimental evidence to 'prove' that they would not also be nonstandard (in quasi-Kantian jargon, that non-well-founded "intensive Grofien"— metalogical counterparts of Hume's 'problem of induction'—might occur in their formulation). I will conclude this section with a brief semiformal sketch of the 'folklore'-result promised above in 1.17 and 4.5, which may clarify the nature of the barriers devisers of philosophical 'cogito'-like arguments have faced. I've elided inductive definitions and blurred notational distinctions to simplify the exposition, but any competent logician can bring them into sharper focus. The definitions first. A 'syntactical interpretation' E of a (not necessarily first order) theory T in another theory U is a systematic translation of formulae (p of T into counterparts &lt;pE in U such that 36 [T proves &lt;P ] (metatheoretically) implies that [U proves &lt;PE] in TE, where TE is the collection of such translates &lt;PE for V in T. Such a syntactical interpretation E is faithful if and only if 37 [T proves &lt;P ] if and only if[ U proves &lt;pE] for all &lt;P in T. Since the 'begged' metatheoretical assumptions of Sect. 3's 'cogito-like' arguments asserted that the identity translation faithfully interprets T in U, the following may be relevant. 38 Proposition. Suppose T is a consistent first-order theory which syntactically interprets Peano's arithmetic, and U is a (metatheoretically) 'stronger' consistent theory which proves that [T is consistent]. Then no syntactical interpretation E o/T in U faithfully interprets the assertion that [T is consistent] in U. Proof (Sketch) Suppose (for contradiction) that a given syntactical interpretation E did faithfully inter pret the assertion that [T is consistent] in U. Then [T is consistent] would be provable in U, by hypothesis, and the biconditionals [[T is consistent] iff' [TE is consistent] iff [T is consistent]6] would also be provable in U, by a series of inductive arguments. So 39 [T is consistent]® would be provable in U. But it is a consequence of Godel's original incompleteness results (cf. Bell and Machover 1977, or Smorynski, pp. 821-865), that [T is consistent] is not provable in the theory T. The assumption that E is faithful and the remarks in the first paragraph would therefore yield that Springer</page><page sequence="25">Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 4277 40 [T is consistent]6 is not provable in U, so we have derived a (metatheoretic) contradiction from the assumption that such a faithful interpretation E of T into U exists. The informal originals of the assertions $ in the proposition made informal semantic claims—in 'ordinary languages' (whatever they are)—about"existence", "interpreta tion" and "conceivability" of 'experiential' frameworks, and I have assimilated such frameworks to formal theories T. 'Analytic realists' who dismiss such assimilations would presumably argue that such assimilations are inapt ('category-mistakes', so to speak)—that "analogy" and "assimilation", for example, are not"identity". (The ancient skeptics' response to this particular argument was that 'we' might not be able to discern the difference—arguably an anticipation of 'equivalence-class' - arguments employed in the proof of Leon Henkin's completeness-theorem (Chang and Keisler 1973/1972, pp. 61-67)). I would respond that the intense eristic attention devoted to Descartes' 'cogito', Berkeley's 'master argument' and Kant's 'deduction^)' tacitly suggests that they were 41 the most vulnerable as well as 'ambitious' thought-experiments in their authors' work, to which I have added a sustained argument that 42 the premises 'begged' in their 'proofs' and 'deductions' become refutable in rea sonable metalogical counterparts. In the case at hand, moreover: 43 the notions of syntactical interpretation I have introduced are rather broad (they apply to theories which are not necessarily first-order, for example); 44 there are 'good (metalogical) reasons' to assimilate the 'semantic' claims of the informal assertions $ to consistency-assertions about first-order counterparts of such T; and 45 'skeptically transcendental' arguments for the recurrence of first-order interpre tation in 'ramified' metatheoretical hierarchies offer correlative 'good reasons' to consider the methodological relevance of such constructions. I will finish in the same spirit with a final 'heuristic' argument (which may be all an honest skeptic should try to offer). As I've suggested earlier, two interrelated hypotheses have animated this essay: that 46 'precise' 'transcendental' assertions of[self]-validation are "transcendental illu sions"', and that 47 semantic paradoxes and metalogical analyses devised to accommodate them have hermeneutic value as thought-experimental refinements of their metaphysical and epistemological ancestors. Such 'hypotheses'—along with their companion-of-the-route, the "metalogical turn" postulated above in 1.1-1.3—cannot be 'proved'. Measured against [their own\ criteria, they may be partially and provisionally sustained, but they will never be 'conclusively' (much less 'ultimately') 'secured'. But these reflections suggest two more hypotheses. The third is that •£) Springer</page><page sequence="26">4278 Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 48 critical awareness itself (and in particular critical [selfl-awareness) may be a ('merely regulative') value, and Keats' "negative capability" (Keats, p. 277) one of its marks. Such an 'awareness', for example, might (partially) reconcile 49 the apparent incompleteness of Kant's 'practical reason' with the underdetermi nation of its 'speculative' counterpart; 50 the 'regulative Ideen' of Kant's 'moral law within us' with our'desires' to 'under stand" the 'starry heaven above us'; and 51 the Wiirde and Schicksal of Kant's "reasonable beings" ("verniinftige Wesen"), with the 'dignity' and 'fate' of Pascal's roseaux pensants ("thinking reeds") in a "univers" which "n'en sait rien". The last hypothesis is that 52 ideals of 'heuristic' inquiry and 'intelligible' verification and concept-formation may be preconditions for 'freedom','autonomy' and mutual'respect'; and therefore that 53 recourses to such 'merely' regulative ideals may be 'reasonable beings" cradle gifts as well as their 'fate(s)'. 5 Reflective inquiry and 'Das' Reich 'der' Zwecke Consider the following (fairly representative) passage, taken from a section in the second Critique entitled: Wie eine Erweiterung der reinen Vernunft in praktischer Absicht, ohne damit ihre Erkenntnis als spekulativ zugleich zu erweitern, zu denken moglich sei.... Hier werden sie [praktische Ideen, wie Freiheit, Unsterblichkeit, Gott und das hochste Gut] immanent und konstitutiv, indem sie Griinde der Moglichkeit sind, das notwendige Objekt der reinen Praktischen Vernunft (das hochste Gut) wirk lich zu machen, da sie ohne dies transzendent und bloG regulative Prinzipien der spekulativen Vernunft sind, die ihr nicht ein neues Objekt iiber die Erfahrung hinaus anzunehmen, sondern nur ihren Gebrauch in der Erfahrung der Voll standigkeit zu nahern auferlegen. KdpV, B 241, 244 (last emphasis mine) How an Extension of Pure Reason in Practical Intention is Possible to Be Thought, without at the Same Time extending its Cognition as Specula tive. ... Here they [practical ideas, such as freedom, immortality, god and the highest good] become immanent and constitutive, in that they are grounds of the possi bility for making the necessary object of pure practical reason (the highest good) real, since without this they are transcendent and merely regulative principles of "£) Springer</page><page sequence="27">Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 4279 speculative reason, which impose on it not the obligation to accept a new object beyond experience, but only to bring its use in experience closer to completeness. Such appeals to "transcendent and merely regulative principles" provided later commentators and metaphysicians with a textual basis for assorted 'two-truths' interpretations of Kantian metaphysics, and the late-nineteenth century Kant-scholar Hans Vaihinger, in particular, with one of the prototypes for his "Philosophie des Als Ob" (the most striking basis for such readings may perhaps be found in KdLJ, 1974 §76, B 339-344). In the first Critique, Kant employed such "merely regulative principles" as ladders to 'higher' forms of'truth' (cf., e.g., B 83-87,185,269 and 670). But he never explicitly acknowledged—except for the Dialectic-passages devoted to 'intelligible causes' (cf. KdrV, B366 ff.) ('critical' counterparts, so to speak, of epicurean 'swerves')—that 1 'practical' recourse to regulative/constitutive distinctions might shift the ground of 'speculative' (scientific) 'experience', or (in the jargon of the last section) that 2 'scientific' experience might not be 'faithfully' interpreted in wider 'regulative' frames for its 'conscious' 'practical' extensions ("... without at the same time extend ing its cognition as speculative...."). In the opening section's 'potted history', I also 3 canvassed straightforward implications of the neo-Kantian observation that many "new objects" (and "new relations") have become part of 'experience' in mathe matics and mathematical physics, and 4 suggested that metalogical margins of 'experience' and its thought-experimental counterparts might someday—'should' someday, if our descendants have the wisdom for it—encompass patterns of recurrently metatheoretical 'object'- and concept-formation undreamt of in Kant's philosophy (or mine). Such arguments and the semantic pluralism which underlie them suggest alterna tive readings for certain remarks in the passage quoted above, and skeptical inter pretations, in particular, for 'practical' aspects of Kant's monist assumptions about 'immanent'/'transcendent'- and 'constitutive'/'regulative'-dichotomy. Suppose one accepted, for example that 'local' claims of'speculative', 'practical' or 'teleological' 'completeness' (Kant's"Vollstandigkeit") are only 'locally' expressible, in essentially incomplete and therefore plurally interpretable metatheories. Then 5 the 'ladders' mentioned earlier—an ancient skeptical image which appeared in the pyrrhonist writings of Sextus Empiricus (cf. 1976, M VIII, p. 481), and reappeared in Wittgenstein's 'dogmatic' Tractatus—might branch and diverge forever' in plurally interpretable metatheoretic patterns', and 6 the 'practical' remarks in KdpV, B 241 and 244 and 'teleological' counterparts of them in KdU, B 301, 342 and 344 ff.) might begin to resemble ancient skeptical claims to engage in 'dialectical' (and plurally interpretable) speculation "adox astos"—"undogmatically", "undoctrinally", and "not in the manner of the dogma tists" (cf., e. g., Sextus Empiricus, 1976, PH I, 24/16). In what follows, I will argue •£) Springer</page><page sequence="28">4280 Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 7 that the principal bar to such 'skeptical' readings of Kant's non-skeptical texts is his assumption that the 'hierarchies' of his 'constitutive'/'regulative' and 'imma nent'/'transcendent' distinctions have exactly two levels', 8 that Kant worked with 'speculative', 'practical' and 'teleological' counterparts of this linear two-stage ascent as a ground-bass in an extraordinary variety of asser tions about 'die' Grenzbestimmung zwischen Immanenz und Transzendenz (cf., e.g., Prolegomena, 1976, pp. 350-362 and KdrV, B 786); and 9 that this 'capped', two-stage linearity of Kant's had an obvious historical prece dent: the 'cave parable', the most influential account of'practical' and 'epistemic' perspective-shift ever written, in which Plato simply assumed that emergence from 'the' cave would take place only once, in one 'direction', and would never be iter ated. In Kant's case, as well as Plato's, why? Why did Plato and Kant, both of whom seemed to countenance other sorts of'infini tum' and ' indefinitum' readily enough, reject stages of semantic (re)interpretation and hermeneutic reflection out of hand? Why did both assume there was only one 'line', or 'ladder', or 'form of the good', or 'realm of ends', when partial realisations of noetic enlightenment would have accorded equally well with the 'conversational' and self-'critical' aspects of Socratic dialektike and Kant's 'Dialektik'l Why, above all, did both construe epistemic, metaphysical and practical 'truth' and 'goodness' as second-order templates, rather than hierarchies of relational interpre tations elucidated in 'heuristic' metatheories (or 'caves' illuminated by 'heuristic' 'suns')? In the case of Kant's 'critical' work in general, and his 'practical' philosophy in particular, the answer, I believe, had little to do with his alleged temperamental preoccupations with 'duty' and dour fascination with unitary 'law'. He was a kindly teacher and brilliant conversationalist, who enjoyed musical entertainment and held down a place at his local Stammtisch (when he could afford it). If Kant felt a deeper sense of philosophical 'duty' or 'commitment', it was to 'hier atic' philosophical traditions which enjoin the sorts of unicity and canonicity of inter pretation I have assimilated to nominally secular 'design-arguments'. I have already argued that certain scientific ('speculative') counterparts of such arguments are metalogically untenable efforts to finesse the 'fate' of 'ontological' and epistemological 'reason'. Here I would suggest that such arguments are indeed more untenable— 10 not because ethical and 'practical' 'experience(s)' and (thought-)experiments are less complex than their scientific counterparts, but because they are vastly more so. (Consider, for example, that 11 ethicists are expected to acknowledge the potential "relevance" of illimitable com plex "initial" and "boundary" conditions to moral "experience", whereas 12 scientists are expected to require that experiments ("experiences" in French) be as "simple" (or at least "controlled", "isolated" and "replicable") as possible.) &lt;£) Springer</page><page sequence="29">Synthese (2014) 191:4253—4-314 4281 In both cases, therefore (but a fortiori in the 'realm' of'the practical'), 13 "intelligibility" and heuristic [selfl-reference (however incomplete) are 'regula tive' 'preconditions' of forms of communication and [self\-understanding worthy of the names. The 'regulative' force of such ideals of processive inquiry—without an aware ness that such inquiry must be ramified if it is to be 'intelligible'—clearly ani mated Descartes', Berkeley's and Kant's hopes that 'design'-based 'uniqueness-of maximality-and-determination '-arguments might be 'provable'; But it could also provide a framework—mindful of the greater 'depth' evoked in 10 above—for 14 acceptance of'localised' forms of Kant's 'Primat des Praktischen', but rejection of 'the' inexpressible 'unicity' of his 'Reich derZwecke' ('realm of ends'). The rest of the section will be given over to an attempt to outline such a'regulative' and 'experiential' interpretation of Kant's Primat, in which significant notions of 'Zweck(e)' and 'Autonomic" will never 'converge' to or eventuate in a unique moral or teleological 'Reich'. On my account, the 'primacy of the practical' reflects 15 a 'natural' desire to interpret one's experience in something 'deeper'; more 'con scious'; more 'contemplative' (cf. 'Aristotle's theoretikon' (1975/1977; 1975)); and more 'comprehensive' (and comprehensive); and 16 an 'autonomously' self-imposed obligation to 'respect' that desire in other "rea sonable" (or at least "sentient") beings which 'experience' it, in the sense that they can propose and test counterfactual' 'purposes' ("Zwecke") they hope might 'realise' (or 'fulfill') it. 17 An "end" or "purpose", in this 'practically' shifted context, is simply a (syn tactically or semantically) interpretable object-theoretic assertion (the German 'Sachverhalt'). 18 A "maxim" ("Maxime") is simply an object-theoretic assertion that certain object theoretic 'means' or actions imply or 'bring about' a particular end. 19 A (moral) "law" ("Gesetz"), finally, is a modal as well as an (intelligible) metathe oretic assertion that certain means' or actions 'should'imply {or'morally entail') a particular object-theoretic 'end'. In "Virtual Modality" (2003b), I defined an adequate 'virtual' semantics for alethic modal assertions in a given theory T, in which 'worlds' Wx are boolean-valued extensions of an 'initial' placeholder-'world' 'generated' by a'virtual' structure which interprets T. For what it is worth, one could define deontological refinements of such alethic semantics which could be fitted with deontological refinements which would single out 20 'practical' subclasses Wj of such 'worlds' or 'realm of ends' Wx, characterised by "reasonable" constraints on the 'permissibility' or 'proportionality' of means and 'legitimacy' recognised in them, and in which 'reality' 'would' be as it 'ought' to be (by the lights of Wx). Springer</page><page sequence="30">4282 Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 The ranges of each such class Wj of counterfactual' deontological' interpretations would be 21 wefatheoretic with respect to the first-order set-theory in which the 'virtual' modal T mentioned above is interpreted; and 22 merametathtoreiic with respect to the original theory T, in which quasi-Rawlsian 'ends' or 'purposes' might'initially' be identified and debated, but the semantic intricacies of such a deontological 'stratification' might reflect the illimitable complexities associated with the "primacy of the practical" above. But is conspicuously, notoriously (and perhaps inevitably) absent from any 'deon tological' refinements of modal sematics (the one sketched earlier or any other) which are guidelines for 'choices' of the hypothetical classes Wt. I will devote the rest of the section therefore to an impredicative effort to sketch a few minimal and incomplete criteria which 'ought' to be met by such 'realms', and argue on good skeptical grounds (and close alignment in this case with Kant) that more 'complete' decision-procedures would be 'inexpressible' in the theoretical contexts to which they applied. Consider, for example, the following (rough)'marks' of'awareness', in ascending order of metatheoretic complexity. 23 It is a mark (indeed a characterisation) of a well-defined (idealised) Turing machine that it can implement object-theoretically feasible and well-demarcated 'induction schemes' of inferences, and 'know', in this sense, 'how to go on' with them. 24 It is a mark of epistemic 'intelligence' to 'understand' metatheoretically (and perhaps even 'know') that one does not 'know how to go on' with respect to indefi nitely extendible ranges of such (more and more complexly defined metatheoretic) schemes. 25 It is a 'deeper' and more 'zetetic' ('searching') mark of metatheoretic 'insight' to search (perhaps in vain) for 'reasons why' we do not 'know how to go on'\ make attempts to extend or modify such schemes (or 'theories')4, and propose new 'characterisations' of them in other (more complexly schematic) 'metatheories'. 26 It is a still deeper and more 'zetetic' mark of sentience, ethical insight and quasi Kantian 'reasonable faith' to seek to understand why and when 'we' 'should' and 'should not' 'be expected to' 'know how to go on' with our attempts to query and refine current schemes; and formulate (in full awareness of our limited moral and conceptual capacities) quasi-Kantian practical 'Gebote' ('commandments' or moral 'injunctions'). The principle such "Gebot" might be called Pascal's imperative: to 27 value 'sentience' and its preconditions, and 'respect' 'cognitive agents' enmeshed in its dilemmas; and 28 attribute to such sentient agents 'rights' and 'responsibilities'—to the best of 'our' abilities and 'theirs' (cf. 24 above)—as (potentially) 'reasonable beings' in need of mutual aid. Vj Springer</page><page sequence="31">Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 4283 (We often seem to forget the obvious: not only do 'we' not'know how to go on'— 'we' do not go on.) If certain actions clearly seem to be incompatible with the 'respect' and its 'attri butions' just invoked, we have ('autonomous') duties to abjure them, if nothing within 'our' physical or conceptual horizon constrains us. And if—by parity of reasoning, so to speak—such forms of 'respect' and their 'attributions' clearly seem to entail certain actions or resorts to particular means, we have equally 'autonomous' duties to carry them out. Exactly because these deliberations are autonomous, however—'legislated' by an elusive and underdetermined 'self'—they do not have sharp metatheoretic boundaries, and their conceptual horizons elude our view (cf. Leibniz' hypothesis that"[c]haque ame connait I'infini, connait tout, mais confusement....", in the "Principles of Nature and of Grace", GVI, 604). Metatheoretically nuanced efforts to interpret aspects of 'experience' may extend them, and even "bring .. .[them] closer to completeness" in this sense. But if they are intelligible—and in that sense communicable—they will not be able to 'determine' 'ultimate' boundary-conditions of practical experience. What endeavors to 'prescribe', in short, cannot itself be ' ultimately' 'prescribed'. What 'it' can do (and 'should' do), is (try to) enjoin itself to (try to) be more compre hensive (and comprehensif). One could, of course, attempt dogmatically to assert the 'existence' of an— essentially indefinable—EA notion of ('human') consciousness—a sort of intentional 'last metatheory', of the sort mentioned earlier. But the arguments offered in prior sections suggest that such a 'consciousness' could not express, much less 'know' what [it itself] is, much less 'know' with sovereign certainty that the thing behind the curtain is not [it], (For a first indication that something like this might be inevitable, consider the 'impredicative' nature of attempts to sketch criteria which 'ought' to be met by 'criteria'—such as the 'Wt' sketched earlier—of what 'ought' to be countenanced.) There are, in short, meta-deontological counterparts of 'autological' dilemmas, and there is no reason to believe that they can be finessed or ('ethically') suppressed. Kant, for example—to his credit—essentially acknowledged, in the Grundlegung der Metaphysik der Sitten, that a "purely good will" is indefinable and indiscernible in human experience (cf., e.g., Gr, 1965, pp. 459-463). This seems to me methodologically right, on the analogies I have sketched. But the arguments of prior sections suggest (at least to me) that no metatheoretically stable Analogon of a 'transcendental deduction' which would ensure a will's 'existence'— even 'regulatively'—could be formulated. They also suggest another, somewhat more oblique analogy, between traditional theodicies and Kant's so-called ascription-problem—the ambiguities that arise when one tries to choose among various initial and boundary-conditions for particular appli cations of 'the' categorical imperative. For Kant felt compelled to acknowledge that the activities and 'motives' of the good will, and its operative "Prinzip", the categorical imperative, may be unsurveyable and (internally) indefinable, so that he could postulate for it the utter detachment from merely empirical and hypothetical ('internal') ectypes that Leibniz sought in his 'god'. &lt;£) Springer</page><page sequence="32">4284 Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 This may sound less surprising, if one reformulates this putative 'analogy' as fol lows. Aristotle, Anselm, Aquinas, Leibniz and others wished to 'ground' (orend) 'merely' relational regresses—of origination, design and conception, for example—in the (allegedly) reflexive [self]-origination, fself]-design and [self]-conception of 'god', along the lines sketched in prior sections. Kant, by contrast, wished to employ 'practical' [self]-referential or fixed-point argu ments to 'ground' (end) certain other 'merely' relational regresses—of actuation, purpose-seeking and other-directed Heteronomie—in the (alleged) [self]-actuation, [Selbst]zweck and [Auto]nomie of the noumenal Wille, and its equally noumenal Prinzip. He sought, in other words, to provide in his ethics (among many other things) a 'first cause'-argument for a "religion of humanity" (or 'ultimate' "purpose than which no more ultimate purpose can be conceived"). This analogy may help explain why most of us find something numinous but thor oughly indeterminate in the resonant language of Kant's supposedly so affectless ethics. It might also help explain why Wollner, Woltersdorff and the other opportunist and fundamentalist Zensoren Seiner Durchlaucht Friedrich Wilhelms II went after him with such ferocity in the 1790s, after he published Religion innerhalb der Grenzen der blofien Vernunft. Along with many others, I find the ideal of a Kantian Reich der Zwecke—and its more conceptually accessible Rawlsian counterpart—moving and iiminally' persua sive. But the culture-bound rigidity and parochiality of the notorious four 'applica tions' Kant offered in the Grundlegung for the first two versions of the categorical imperative—not to mention the even more notorious strains in his late essay "Uber ein vermeintliches Recht, aus Menschenliebe zu liigen"—seem to require suspension of judgment, and a measure of (what might be called) noetic restraint. For the very refiexivity of Kant's 'Selbstzweck(eY, 'Selbstgesetzgebung' and reine Selbsttdtigkeit (pure self-activity or -actuation, the quality Aristotle attributed to theo ria; cf. Gr, p. 452) poses a (literal) dilemma: 'practical' Grenzideen, on the analyses of the foregoing sections, are either (i) indiscernible to themselves (and therefore of little 'practical' use); or (ii) plurally interpretable in ethically defensible 'realms' of branching 'Zweck mafiigkeiten ohne ('ultimate') Zweck'. Such dilemmas would not be surprising if one construed Kant's 'deduction' of prac tical Autonomie (self-lawgiving; cf., e.g., Gr, pp. 453-454) as an 'individualisation' of traditional 'first'- and 'self-cause'-characterisations of'god', or at least (iii) "[etwas] zu aller Reihen der Bedingungen notwendig... Unbedingtes, mithin auch eine sich ganzlich von selbst bestimmte Kausalitat...." (KdpV, B 83-84). As is the case with other would-be deductions of [self]-constituting metaphysical universality, this one may be (re)formulated as a (literally) self-referential paradox: (cf. 3.44-3.45 above), that &lt;£) Springer</page><page sequence="33">Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 4285 29 Each 'reasonable being' 'must' be able to will that [each 'reasonable being' 'must' be able to will that [[...]]]• The indefinite 'implosion' of "[[...]]'"s suggests a fault-line in Kant's attempts to assimilate a practical Verstandeswelt (mundits intelligibilis, or conceptual world; cf., e.g., Gr, 458 and KdpV, 74) to the Noumena of his theoretical or speculative philosophy. For the characteristic of the latter in the Dialectic is their conceptual underdeter mination and openness to plurality of interpretation, at least"in spekulativer Absicht" ("in speculative intent"). (Compare the Antinomies, and Kant's incisive analyses of traditional 'proofs' of the existence of god). But this underdetermination and hermeneutic plurality contrasts sharply with the 'regulative' 'necessity' and unicity Kant postulated for his 'realm of ends'—in (Gr, 445), for example, when he wrote that 30 Wer also Sittlichkeit fur Etwas und nicht fur eine chimarische Idee ohne Wahrheit halt, muG das angefiihrte Prinzip derselben zugleich einraumen. Who(soever) considers morality to be something, and not a chimerical idea without truth, must concede the principles we have advanced. As a would-be "reasonable being", I would certainly "consider morality to be something". But I would also consider the dichotomy Kant imposes in this passage a groundless petitio of the doctrine I called 'semantic monismdenial, in the case at hand, that 31 there could be any alternative to 'existence' of 'ultimate' 'speculative', 'practical' and ' teleologicaV interpretations and other "truths"), except utter inconsistency ("eine chimarische Idee"). Such begged dichotomies and 'first-cause'-analogies underlie the ambiguities that arise from Kant's "ascription problem", mentioned earlier, and in particular the notori ously uneven success of Kant's "examples" at Gr, pp. 422-424 and 429-430 mentioned earlier. But they also suggest why there is something deeply, genuinely and recurrently cor rects well as 'problematic' in Kant's 'transcendental' acknowledgment, at (p. 419), that 32 es durch kein Beispiel, mithin empirisch auszumachen sei, ob es iiberall irgend einen dergleichen Imperativ gebe.... it is not to be made out through any sort of example, and thus empirically, whether there is anywhere any imperative of the kind. Since every moral dilemma we are likely to face comes trailing clouds of back ground conditions and boundary-assumptions, it seems to me eminently 'reasonable' (in Kant's own sense) to 33 abandon Kant's semantic monism, in the passage from Gr, 445 quoted above, and interpret its implicit'if-then' assertion ("Whoever considers.. .must concede...."), &lt;£) Springer</page><page sequence="34">4286 Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 as the hypothetical (rather than categorical) meta-imperative it seems in fact to be. Once one does this, however, it also seems 'reasonable' to grant him that 34 reflective—and ultimately reflexive and [.velf\-determining—contemplative activity and respect for such activity in all other "reasonable Beings" are the recurrent—but 'liminal' and essentially incomplete 'grounds' of moral action, in keeping with 35 Aristotle's observations of children's desires (orexeis) to 'know' and praises of theoria (or energeia theoretike) as the 'highest' forms of thought, namely "thought about thought", and 36 Kant's injunction to 'displace ourselves' ("sich hineinversetzen") into "intelligi ble" realms of ends (in his sense of "intelligible"), conceived as an 37 empathetic imperative to 'displace ourselves', however inadequately, into the suf ferings and aspirations of other "reasonable beings" (Gustave Gilbert may have been right about the origins of "evil"). I have already argued (in 27 and 28 above) 38 that respect for sentience, in all its gradations—construed as inchoate energeiai theoretikai—is the mark of Kant's elusive 'good will', in all its gradations, and 39 that provisional respect (Kant's Achtung) for the emergence and possible presence of such theoria in others is an inherent constituent of that regulative ground, and basis for a more modest and heuristic categorical imperative. This is the essence, for me, of Kant's alternative formulation of the imperative, as respect for the generative capacities of '[self]-legislating' theoria in other 'reasonable beings', to be treated as ends (not only in [themselves], but to [themselves]), rather than (mere) 'means'. What we should enjoin ourselves to "respect", in other words—in a form of col lective 'self-legislation'—are 'innocent' (non-'harming') forms of Aristotle's desire. This respect, in a sense, might also be an appropriate dialectical/skeptical elenchos—"in praktischer Absicht"—of Descartes' rhetorical paranoid worries in Meditation II about the "hats and clothes under which might lie automata" ("pileos et vestes sub quibus latere possent automata", AT VII 32). Who knows? But more to the point, I believe: what do 'we' know about [ourselves], that entitles us to judge that other potential 'reasonable beings'—Kant's phrase—are not up to 'our' standards? Kant's explicitly latitudinarian view of the distribution of possible 'reasonableness' (cf. Gr, 408 and 426) got this right, I think. And John Searle, in his "Chinese Room" parable—a fallacious 'E4-argument' which exactly reverses Descartes' 'worry' about the hats and clothes on springs—got it thoroughly and dogmatically wrong. I believe, at any rate, that some of these insights may have inspired the "awe" (Ehtfurcht) Kant struggled to express, in his famous vision of the vault above him and moral law within him. For it is this processive "awe" itself that moves us: that we cherish in our children; that we want to foster and protect in each other, and in ourselves. The vault and the &lt;£} Springer</page><page sequence="35">Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 4287 'law' are only placeholders for it, provisional emblems for an elusive and forever underdetermined Erhabenheit (sublimity) in Kant's 'theoretical' vision—and ours. 6 Reflective inquiry and "Systeme von Zwecken" At KdrV, B 672, Kant characterised a "System" as "eine gewisse kollektive Einheit zum Ziele der Verstandeshandlungenand he sketched suggestively 'metatheoretical' and 'hierarchical' roles for such "Systeme" in KdrV, B 692, quoted above. 'Experience', on the account 1 have offered, 'is' (or may pragmatically be viewed as) a indefinitely ramified 'System' of such 'Systeme', which 'individuate' and 'objectify' in graduated ways as they 'ascend'. 'Stages' in such metatheoretic hierarchies, moreover, have an interesting sort of 'distributive' or 'kollektive Einheit', for 1 all Stone spaces (topological spaces of semantic interpretations of essentially incomplete first-order theories) are topologically and measure-theoretically 'iso morphic■' (cf. 1.3 and 7.29-7.30 below). What distinguishes particular theories from other particular theories in this hierar chical myriad are their (metatheoretically 'intended') formal vocabularies, of course; but also, and more deeply, 2 their patterns of syntactical and semantic interpretation, which order and inter relate them\ and 3 their (recursion-theoretic) complexities, which effectively determine the 'isomor phisms'. In this section, I will argue 4 that Kant tacitly acknowledged in the third Critique that he had offered an artificially isolated and experimentally 'controlled' structure of'experience', which could not (for example) even determine its allegedly fixed (Newtonian) boundary-conditions. (It was known, for example, in the late eighteenth century that Newton's analyses— which construed the planets as point-masses—could not cope with their mutual interactions, much less account for observed perturbations in their actual orbits.); 5 that Kant saw that some sort of metatheoretic ascent or Regressus might present itself if the'observational' base of his "Anschauungen" turned out no? to'determine' more 'heuristic' and nuanced aspects of scientific inquiry (the indefinite 'complexities' of 'the organic', for example); and finally, 6 that he saw that underdetermination of that 'intuitive' observational base might also be reflected in iterations of KdrV, B 692's conceptual register-shifts', and that such iterations might 'open' the first Critique's rigid two-stage architectonic, and blur or relativise its allegedly sharp 'transcendental' demarcation of "Verstand" from "Vernunft". One aspect of this recognition might be the oddly enhanced role given in the third Critique to "reflectierende Urteilskraft" ("reflective judgment"), characterised as a form of mediation ("Mittelglied", KdU, iv) between 'understanding' and 'reason'. &lt;£) Springer</page><page sequence="36">4288 Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 In the first and third Critiques, this Vermogen assumed the interestingly 'metathe oretic' role of "Uberlegung" ("reflection" or "deliberation"; literally, "overlaying"): a "Bewufttsein des Verhaltnisses gegebener Vorstellungen zu unseren verschiede nen Erkenntnisquellen" ("awareness of the relation of given representations to our various sources of knowledge", KdrV, B 316); and "Unterscheidung der Erkenntniskraft, wozu die gegebenen Begriffe gehdren" (KdrV, B 317) ("discrimination of the capacity for knowledge to which the various concepts belong"), [welche] "aufdie Gegenstande selbstgeht" ("[which] applies to the objects themselves", KdrV, B 319). In this 'capacity', "reflective Urteilskraft" effectively 7 assigned orders or levels to (what might be called) 'object'- as well as 'concept formation' ([welche] "aufdie Gegenstande ...geht")\ and in so doing, it 8 ambiguated (and transcended') the otherwise rigorously closed architectonic of 'reason' in the first and second Critiques, in which "Reflexion" appeared only in the guise of an Amphibolie" (cf. KdrV, B 316-349). In metalogical analyses, counterparts of such (potentially higher-intentional) acts of 'discernment'—'the' local distinction between theory and metatheory, for example— function as type-or register-raisers which ride the wavefronts of metatheoretical hier archies, and locally 'transcend' what they 'discern'. It is plausible, therefore, that such a metaphysically 'skeptical' (or at least inquisi tive) Vermogen might have given Kant the conceptual instrument he needed to absorb and buffer the 'awareness' I attributed to him in 4-6 above. Similar preoccupations might also have led him to 9 give greater prominence to the incomplete, underdetermined and (in my analogy) type-straddling notion of a "System" which 'merely' regulated emerging bound aries of 'experiences' (cf., once again, KdrV, B 672 and KdrV, B 692); and 10 postulate evolving (and perhaps ramifying) forms of "Reflexion" about 'nat ural' and 'organic' Systeme of "Zwecke" and "Zweckmaftigkeit", which would (re)inform and (re)interpret extensions of the Analytic's scientifically as well as 'teleologically' inadequate Anschauungen and Begriffe. And this, in turn, might have led Kant—-or someone troubled by the equivocal ways in which he used words like "Vollstandigkeit" in the Analytic and Dialectic—to 11 consider more latitudinarian (and more 'counterfactual'-supporting) notions of 'causality', 12 acknowledge at least tacitly that the 'closure' of the Aesthetic and Analytic doesn't 'work', and 13 explore 'merely regulative 'principles' and forms of 'causality' in 'heuristi cally' adequate notions of Zweckmaftigkeit (glossed at KdU, B344 as "die Geset zmafiigkeit des Zufalligen" ("the lawlikeness of the contingent"; cf. 18 and 19 below) ohne (a final, uniform) 'Zweck' (purpose). '•£j Springer</page><page sequence="37">Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 4289 Kant's characterisation of "Zweckmafligkeit" as a 'merely regulative' "Geset zmafligkeit des Zufalligen", just cited, also raises methodological questions about the absence of 'counterfactual support' for iawlike' assertions in the KdrV): 14 do claims that 'real' lawlikeness (Gesetzmaftigkeit) only holds for systems which are 'necessary' in the sense that they are deterministic not beg the question of the Analytic's 'underlying' ('Laplacian') determinism? And if they do, 15 what are we to make of (ostensibly)'metaphysical' (as opposed to 'merely' mathe matical) assertions that 'real' 'experiential' causation—construed as a 'physical' form of alethic modal entailment—'supports counterfactuals', if there are no counterfactuals to support? The problems raised by these queries are oddly cognate to Hume's failure to dis tinguish between 'factual' (indicative) and 'counterfactual-supporting' (subjunctive) implications in his 'definitions' of "Cause" in the first Enquiry (Hume 1975, §60,76). But they are hardly confined to the metaphysics of Hume and Kant. For they persist in cognate problems for any 'causal' metaphysics in which we do not (and, I believe, cannot) know how to 'choose' 'ultimate' metatheoretic 'boundary conditions' for 'virtual' modal semantics of 'worlds' and 'accessibility'-relations which interpret their 'causes'. Prompted by (what I have read as) Kant's tacit acknowledgment that 'mediation' by 'reflective judgment' might iterate 'the' Anschauung/Begriff/Idee-hierarchy, I have therefore sought to 16 relativise that hierarchy; 17 'open' its rigid three-level Architektonik; 18 iterate such relativisations in ramified patterns of metatheoretical ascent; and finally 19 appeal to such patterns to formulate 'conceptual' interpretations of ('theoretical', 'practical' and 'reflective') 'experience' within shifting horizons of metatheoretic complexity. Metalogical studies of such hierarchies suggest that essentially incomplete and underdetermined Systeme and their hierarchies may 'regulate' emerging boundaries of experiences, and that notions of Zweckmafligkeit may 'inform' and (re)interpret such regulative systems and their notions of 'causality'. Within various stages of such 'systems', for example, one can 'rationally' as well as 'reasonably' assimilate Endzwecke or causae finales to provisional forms of meta logical explanation or interpretation, but accept that no 'ultimate' 'finality' for them will ever come into view. Such 'principles' and forms of 'causality', moreover, would be ('merely) "heuristic", "reflective"regulative" and "problematic". In analogy with certain aspects of Kant's usage, they would be 20 "heuristisch", in that they ('merely') serve "'den' "besonderen Gesetzen derNatur nachzuforschen .... ohne iiber 'die' Natur hinaus 'den' Grund 'der' Moglichkeit Springer</page><page sequence="38">4290 Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 derselben zu suchen" ("inquire into 'the' particular laws of nature ...without searching beyond nature [to inquire] about its ground", KdU, B355). (The single quotation marks in the quotation are obviously mine: we tend to forget that the original senses of "physis" and "natura" were processive as well as 'organic'.) They would be 21 "reflektiv" in that they seek to discern theories' orders of complexity and relative interpretability, but do not define or determine 'ultimately' 'canonical' interpre tations for them. (Kant's (1974) "reflective Urteilskraft" sought 'only' to 'subsume' its intentional objects, whereas the 'Vermogen' he called "understanding" 'determined' them; cf„ e.g., KdU, B 311-313 and B 365). They would be ('merely') 22 "regulative" in that they are "nur...Regel[n], welche...einen Regressusgebiete[n], dem es niemals erlaubt ist, bei einem Schlechthinunbedingten stehen zu bleiben" ("only rule[s] which prescribe a regress in which one is never permitted to halt at an utterly unconditioned [limit]"; KdrV, B 536-537). (Notice that Kant retained in this context Hume's distinction between "Geset zlichkeif' and what Wittgenstein later called "Regelbefolgung"...) And such 'principles', 'concepts' and 'judgments' would finally be 23 "problematic" in that (a) "man das Bejahen oder Verneinen [derer] als blofl moglich (beliebig) annimmt" ("one takes the affirmation or denial [of them] as possible (optional)", KdrV, B100); and (b) they are ..Begrenzung[en] gegebener Begriffe" [welche] "mit anderen Erken ntnissen zusammenhang[en], dessen objektive Realitat ...auf keine Weise erkannt werden kann" ("boundaries of given concepts" [which] "fit together with other forms of knowledge whose objective reality cannot in any way be known", KdrV, B 310). (Cf. also the remark that 23(c) "[/]«.? Innere der Natur dringt Beobachtung und Zergliederung der Erschein ungen, und man kann nicht wissen, wie weit dieses mit der Zeit gehen werde" ("observation and distinction of appearances penetrate into the interior of nature, and one cannot know how far this might go [on] over time", KdU, B334)). Some definitions and characterisations may clarify other aspects of the relativisa tions I have sketched. In the context of 16-19 above, for example, 24 a "system" may be any finitely (or finitarily) 'overviewable' substructure of an eventually first-order metatheoretic hierarchy; 25 an act or instance of "reflection" (or "reflective judgment") 'locally' identifies a given system's relative 'position' in such a metatheoretic hierarchy (as above; cf. once again KdrV, B316ff); &amp;j Springer</page><page sequence="39">Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 4291 26 an "end" ox "purpose" ("Zweck") (cf. 5.20) is once again a (syntactically or seman tically) interpreted object-theoretic assertion (the German 'Sachverhalt') at some stage in such a hierarchy; 27 a (regulative) "law" (or merely' 'zweckmaflige' "Maxime") is a mot/a/ impli cation which asserts that certain 'means' or hypothetically contributory 'causes' jointly 'entail' certain 'ends' in a metatheoretic environment in which we do not and cannot know what ranges of 'counterfactual' alternatives the implication might 'support'. At a number of points in the third Critique, Kant argued for the claim that cognitive agents have a right to 'impute' ("ansinnen") certain attributes or judgments to others, and such "imputation" is not confined to aesthetic judgments. The more common noun-usage "Ansinnen" has many senses in Kant's and other German-speakers' usage ("demand", "request" "expectation" "imposition" and "point of view" among them), and 28 an assertion that a given 'reflectivejudgment' of mine is "ansinnbar" (an adjectival form Kant does not use) might therefore be construed as 29 a 'liminal' assertion that whatever 'interprets' 'my experience' (in ways which may not be fully knowable to 'me', or even expressible in 'my' language)'should' interpret 'my' ' reflective judgment' or expression of that 'experience' accordingly. Such 'interpretability'—which might be construed, as Kant suggests, as a form of communicability—would assure a form of relative consistency: 30 if'the world' 'makes sense', so do 7', or at least 'my' expression or reflection of a given aesthetic or 'practical' aspect of it. (Or so '/' think). Methodologically, at least, this metalogical reading of the 'subjektive Algeme ingultigkeit' of Kantian aesthetic judgments seems to me defensible. More relevantly, it may clarify the conceptual asymmetry between aesthetic "Ansinnbarkeit" and moral "solidarity". For the former demands that others 'appre ciate' what / 'appreciate', and the other that I try to 'comprehend' the capacity to 'appreciate' in others. The former may or may not be a 'just' demand, but it is literally 'egocentric' and 'self-absorbed' in ways the latter is not. Be that as it may, the principal burden of this section has been to make two closely related points: 31 that what is genuinely 'regulative' of 'inquiry' are attempts to consider, critique and appreciate "Zwecke" ("purposes"); and 32 that zetetic inquiry is not only regulative of 'experience'. It is also a form of generative skepsis, and a form—and perhaps prototype—of "Zweckmafligkeit ohne Zweck". Distributively, one might also characterise such 'experiential' systems and their 'dynamics' as graduated forms of "Erfahrungsmafiigkeit ohne (schlechthinnige) Erfahrung", and construe them as heuristic 'regulative ideals' of such 'experience' (or 'experience(s)'). Since uniform quasi-Kantian 'preconditions' of such 'experience' would not, in particular, be object-theoretically definable at any stage of theoretical inquiry, the &lt;£) Springer</page><page sequence="40">4292 Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 underdetermination of such 'systems" boundary-conditions and 'counterfactual' envi ronments might also be 33 compared with the 'confusion' Leibniz attributed to attempts to understand 'notiones concretae', and 34 interpreted as a margin of the infinite {or at least indefinite) in the finite, or at least the conceptually finitary. 'Origins', 'preconditions' and semantically 'intended' interpretations are object theoretically invisible in all the gradations of metatheoretical hierarchies they 'condi tion' and 'regulate'. We cannot, for example, define or measure 'all' 'conceivable...'/'conceptual...' definition or measurement. For the only way to remove the "'..."'s is to relativise one's inquiry to particular expressible theories in which one can begin to make sense of 'conception', 'definition' and 'measurement'. (Notice the parallels between these notions and mathematical 'boundary-conditions' and physical 'experimental prepara tion'.) If the 'cogito'-like responses Descartes, Berkeley and Kant offered to Sect. 3's criterial hierarchies 'worked', in the presuppositionless ways their authors apparently intended, it would be to witness the incoherence of the (meta)theory in which they are formulated. For 'last' clauses in the stoic/skeptical dialogue which gave rise to 'cogito'-like arguments will always reinstate skeptical doubt of skeptical doubt, in order to reinstate minimal stoic consistency-demands. Fixed-point arguments, for example, would have little 'constitutive' force for 'the' unicity of 'experience', but quite a bit of 'regulative' value as 'local' guidance for avoidance of certain conspicuous forms of 'transcendental illusion'. If one could, for example,'define' 'transcendence' in one of Sect. 2's 'intelligible' theories, one could also formulate a 'diagonal' assertion which would be equivalent to [its own] 'transcendence'. But this would undermine the 'definition': for no syntactical interpretation of such a sentence would accurately 'define' ('the' 'preconditions' of) [its own] 'immanence'. If Einstein had been ' right', therefore, that 35 'the' world is 'complete' (a word he often used in his debates with Niels Bohr) and epistemically accessible (since 'derAlte', like Descartes' 'god', does not'deceive' us), he would also (on good Godelian grounds) be 'wrong', 36 for 'it' would either be as incomplete as 'we' are, or as epistemically inaccessible to 'itself as 'it' is to 'us'. One the evidence of such arguments, it might be a 'transcendental illusion' that 'experience' has a 'constitutive' "Grenzbestimmung", and 'reasonable beings' would be more 'reasonable' to the extent they understand this. This predicament might be regulative of Kant's 'Schicksal der Vernunft' as well as 'experience'and 'comprehension', in both French senses of these words. But it might also be one of reason's cradle-gifts: a source of 37 skeptical self-awareness that 'ultimate' self-knowledge is little more than a seman tic paradox; and of Springer</page><page sequence="41">Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 4293 38 'creativity' in that no such 'ultimate' Ubersicht bounds 'reasonable beings" con ceptual event-horizons. To see that this might be so, consider two recurrent arguments of the sort canvassed earlier: 39 a 'neo-Kantian' one that some stage of metatheoretic ascent is closable as 'expe rience'; and 40 a 'Peircean' one that 'the' entire ascent is linear and unique, and this 'course of inquiry' is 'experience'. In this context, all I have done is propose a nonlinear alternative to Peircean limit(sY, in which convergence is plural and there is no 'ultimate' hierarchy-internal 'overview'. That 'intelligible' theories cannot 'intend' their own interpretation and that hierar chies of them are indefinitely iterable is a metalogical theorem. That ramification of such hierarchies is limitless is a regulative ideal of experiential openness as well as contemplative "Erhabenheit" ("sublimity"), in ways I will try to explore in the next section. That 'we' can 'go on' in such hierarchies is an article of 'reasonable faith', sustained by 'liminal' postulations of consistency and 'intentional' interpretation which hover indefinitely at the margins of what they define. 7 Reflective inquiry and Kant's two "Unermefilichkeiten" At the end of the Kritik der praktischen Vernunft, Kant (1974) wrote the following resonant sentence, later inscribed on his cenotaph in Konigsberg: Zwei Dinge erfiillen das Gemiit mit immer neuer und zunehmender Bewun derung und Ehrfurcht, je ofter und anhaltender sich das Nachdenken damit beschaftigt: der bestirnte Himmel iiber mir, und das moralische Gesetz in mir. (KdpV, p. 288) Two things fill the sensibility with ever new and growing awe, the more often and more persistently reflection occupies itself with them: the starred firmament above me, and the moral law within me. To me at least, these lines suggest that for all his 'critical' acceptance of Newtonian "Mechanism", Kant saw something comparably "erhaben" ("sublime") in 'regulative ideals' of the macrocosmos 'above' us and microcosmos 'within' us. Prompted by this interpretation, I will appeal in this section to iiminal' as well as limitless aspects of the foregoing sections' interpretation of 'experience' to 1 argue for an evenhandedly 'regulative' interpretation of both these ideals" and 2 compare Kant's two "Unermefilichkeiten" ("immeasurabilities"; cf. 7 below) with metalogical and metaphysical counterparts of Pascal's two infinites or abimes". Recall (or observe) first that Kant considered "Achtung" ("respect") and "Ehrfurcht" ("awe") intentional attitudes appropriate to (inadequate) attempts to contemplate two &lt;£) Springer</page><page sequence="42">4294 Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 closely interrelated limiting ideals: "Pflicht" ("duty"), and "das Erhabene" ("the sub lime"). "Achtung", for example, in the third Critique was the 3 "sense of the inadequacy of our capacity to attainment of an idea which obligates us" ("Gefiihl der Unangemessenheit unseres Vermogens zur Erreichung einer Idee, die fur uns Gesetz ist") (KdU, B 96). When that "respect" is engendered by contemplation of 4 "the intellectual, in itself purposeful [and] (morally) good" ("das intellektuelle, an sich selbst zweckmafiige (das Moralisch-)Gute", cf. KDU, B 120), then regard for this ideal is also "erhaben" ("sublime"). For it is 5 "not pleasure, but self-estimation (of the humanity in us), which raises us above our need [for pleasure]" ("kein Vergniigen ist, sondern eine Selbstschatzung (der Menschheit in uns), die uns iiber das Bedurfnis desselben erhebt") (KdU, B 228), and its view or contemplation 6 "gives us just access to .. .the idea of a great system of natural ends" ("[mh.s-] zu der Idee eines grofien Systems der Zwecke der Natur ...berechtigt"), which we 7 "love as well as contemplate for its immeasurability, and find ourselves ennobled in that contemplation." ("lieben, sowie ihrer Unermefilichkeit wegen mit Achtung betrachten und uns selbst in dieser Betrachtung veredelt fiihlen....") (KdU, B303, emphasis mine). Such "Liebe", finally, engenders a 'higher' and more'autonomous' form of 'human ist' respect, namely 8 "Ehrfurcht", or "respect for a ruler.. .which lies within us, [and therefore] awakens a sense of the sublime in our own [self -]determination which inspires us more than anything beautiful" (".Achtung...gegen seinen Gebieter, [der] ...in uns selbst liegt, [und daher] ein Gefiihl des Erhabenen unserer eigenen Bestimmung erweckt, was uns mehr hinreifit als alles Schone") (Die Religion innerhalb der Grenzen der blofien Vernunft, VI, 23-24fn). In what follows, I will assimilate 9 Kant's first "Unermefilichkeit" ("der bestirnte Himmel iiber mir") to the immea surably ramifying metatheoretic "Systeme" of'intelligible' theories evoked above in Sects. 2 through 4, and 10 his second "Unermefilichkeit" ("das moralische Gesetz in mir") to the cor rectively immeasurable and ramifying 'hypotheoretic' "Systeme" of variably encoded forms of awareness or consciousness which may be expressed 'within' them, respect for which I offered earlier as less prescriptive but (in my view at least) no less "erhabene" Alternativen to the various forms of Kant's categorical imperative. These assimilations will carry with them cognate metalogical interpretations of two other "Ideen" in Kant's writings: Springer</page><page sequence="43">Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 4295 11 'physical' "Organism" (or "Organisation"), invoked in several contexts in the third Critique; and 12 'liminal' 'systematic' "Horizonte", mentioned twice in the first Critique, and at considerably greater length in Kant's lectures on "Logik''. "Physik" (or "das Physische"), was emphatically no? what we would call "(New tonian) physics", but 13 ein Doctrinal System empirischer Erken[n]tnis (nicht ein empirisches System denn der Begriffvon einem solchen enthalt einen Wiederspruch), a doctrinal system of empirical knowledge {not an empirical system, for the concept of such a thing contains a contradiction). As the parenthetical remark suggests, such a 'higher-order' System might require 'critical' discernment of'empirical' theory from 'transcendental' metatheory to avert (semantic) paradox ("einen Wiederspruch"), and have 14 zweyerley Objecte: (1) was uberhaupt Gegenstand der Erfahrung ist (2) dessen Moglichkeit selbst nicht anders als durch Erfahrung erkennbar ist, wovon also die Wirklichkeit vor der Moglichkeit nothwendig vorhergeht die also nicht a priori erkannt werden kann (KW 2003, XXII, pp. 398-99). two sorts of objects: (1) whatever is an object of experience (2) [something] whose very possibility is not knowable other than through experience, the reality of which necessarily precedes therefore its possibility[, and] therefore which can not be known a priori. Quasi-Leibnizian 'notiones completae', for example, might 'regulate' Newtonian 'Mechanism"s reference-frames and boundary conditions, as well as instances of what Kant called "Organism", or "das Organische" (terms which do not appear in the third Critique, where he replaced them with more 'dynamic' and 'processive' usages such "organisieren" and "Organisation"). In his deconstruction of Swedenborgian mysticism, for example (Traiime eines Geistersehers, KW, XVIII, p. 13), Kant observed in passing that"das physische ist nicht pneumatisch, sondern organisch", and he remarked in other non-'critical' texts that 15 [d]ie dynamische Erklarungsart ist entweder mechanisch durch Werkzeuge die selbst bewegender Krafte zu ihrer Existenz bediirfen und wenn sie ihrer Natur nach Zwecke ihrer Bildung voraussetzen [o]rganisch vorgestellt werden. (KW, XXI, p. 233) the dynamic mode of explanation is either mechanical, by means of instruments which themselves require moving forces for their existence, [or] if they are rep resented organically in accordance with their nature [and] presuppose [aims or] ends for their formation. and formulated a 16 ...Definition eines organischen Korpers ...daB erein Korper ist dessen jeder Theil um des anderen willen (wechselseitig als Zweck und zugleich als Mittel) da ist.— Man sieht leicht daB dies eine blofie Idee ist der a priori die Realitat (d.i. daB es ein solches Ding geben konne) nicht gesichert ist. 4l) Springer</page><page sequence="44">4296 Synlhese (2014) 191:4253-4314 Man kann die Erkldrung dieser Fiction auch anders stellen: Er ist ein Korper an welchem die innere Form des Ganzen vor dem Begriffe der Composition aller seiner Theile ... in Ansehung ihrer gesammten bewegenden Krafte vorhergeht (also Zweck und Mittel zugleich ist).

One can also put the explanation of this fiction differently: it is a body for which the inner form of the whole precedes the concept of the composition of all of its parts ...in view of their collective moving forces ([and] therefore is at once end and means). (It may be worth observation that more precise analogues of Kant's struggle to 'define' 'the organic' may be found in mathematical-physical notions of an "interact ing field"). Freed, in short, from the narrow confines of his 'transcendental' rationales for New ton's differential equations, Kant acknowledged that his "Physik'"s 'merely regulative' entailments might lead into 'rational' but indefinitely complex realms of Fiction(en) and blofie Ideen (cf. Newton's notorious remark that"hypotheses nonfingo"). One might, for example, 'transcend' (KW, XXI, p. 233) deterministic 'heteronomy' with appeals to prototypes of'complexity', 'emergence' and 'self-organisation', if such "blofie Ideen" were made (meta)mathematically precise in reasonably predictive ways. 'Skeptical' arguments, I believe, suggest that they can, and my modification of Galileo's famous dictum to suggest in 0.1 above that 'the book of philosophy' might (and perhaps should) be written in the language(s) of metamathematics was partly animated by this conviction. It was also guided by a belief that if such programmatic conjectures turn out to have regulative value, the fate of Carnap's Aufbau suggests that 17 they will have to be adaptive and provisional rather than prescriptive, and that 18 those who make them would be well advised to acknowledge their essential incom pleteness and recurrently 'liminal' metamathematical margins. For it is quite conceivable that 19 interrelations between 'the' 'book of philosophy' and 'language of (meta)mathematics' might themselves form 'systems' of 'intelligible' theories whose metametamathematical properties evolve and ramify in ways we cannot anticipate, much less dictate. Still—as the Danish saying goes, "blind chickens find also a grain" ("blinde h0ns finder ogsa et korn"), and an allegedly 'heuristic' proposal should try to 'find' ("heurein") something from time to time. Here is a possible "korn". In one of 4.10's hierarchically organised "systems", answers to queries about object-theoretic consequences might serve as 'means' to more complex metatheoretic 'ends', and conversely. Finitary 'intelligible systems' and their insights might therefore 'evolve' in such hierarchies—in which higher-order metatheoretic 'ends' in one 'systematic' context &lt;£) Springer</page><page sequence="45">Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 4297 became object-theoretic 'means' in another—and stages of such evolution might be construed as 20 [d]as Materiale[,J in so fern es nur problematisch gedacht und eine Tendenz enthalt es sich assertorisch als gegeben vorzustellen (Organisch, Unorganisch). (KW, XXII, p. 480) [t]he material [,] in so far as it is only thought problematically and possesses a tendency to represent itself as given assertorily (Organic, Inorganic). All of this, once again, would remain 'merely regulative', 'physically' underdeter minedand metamathematically incomplete ...adindefinitum. But such underdetermi nation might at least be informative, as well as compatible with several of Kant's more 'skeptical' (or at least 'merely regulative') remarks—that 21 [d]ie Mathematik wird durch Philos. indirect begriindet ...(KW, XXII, p. 78), [mathematics is indirectly grounded through philos[ophy], for example; or that 22 ([d]er Begriff von organisi[e]rten Korpern gehort zum Fortschreiten im System der Wa[h]rnehmungen des Subjects das sich selbst affici[e]rt) (KW, XXII, p. 398); [t]he concept of organised bodies belongs to what is processive in the system of perceptions of the subject which [ap]perceives itself; or that 23 [m]an fangt da nicht von Objecten an sondern von dem System der Moglichkeit sein eigenes denkendes Subject zu constitui[e]ren und ist selbst Urheber seiner Denkkraft (KW, XXI, p. 79). [o]ne does not begin from objects[,] but from the system of the possibility to con stitute one's own thinking subject and [one] is the originator of one's capacity for thought; or even that 24 die zweyte [organische Ordnung der Natur, d.i. die Form derselben nach Regeln] ist auf einer Idee gegriindet, die des einzelnen sich als Werkzeug zu einer Einrich tung bedient, die aus den einzelnen Naturdingen nach allgemeinen Gesetzen nicht entsprungen ware.) (KW, XVII, p. 418) the second [organic order of nature, i.e. the form of it in accordance with rules] is based on an idea, which makes use of the particular as [an] instrument for an arrangement which would not [otherwise] have arisen from the separate things of nature in accordance with general laws. My appeals to metatheoretical underdetermination might also be compatible with Kant's rare but carefully formulated (if 'merely regulative') remarks about'Horizonte' in the first Critique: 25 Der Inbegriff aller moglichen Gegenstande fiir unsere Erkenntnis scheint uns eine ebene Flache zu sein, die ihren scheinbaren Horizont hat, namlich das, was den ganzen Umfang derselben befaBt, und von uns der Vernunftbegriff der unbed ingten Totalitat genannt worden. Empirischdenselben zu erreichen, ist unmoglich, und nach einem gewissen Prinzip ihn a priori zu bestimmen, dazu sind alle Ver suche vergeblich gewesen.

To reach this [horizon] empirically is impossible, and [as for efforts] to determine [or define] it in accordance with a particular principle a priori, all [such] efforts have been in vain. I have also argued that'der' Vernunftbegriff der' unbedingten 'Erfahrung' is no more unique or "a priori zu bestimmen" than 'der Vernunftbegriff 'der' unbedingten 'Totalitdt'—an assimilation which also seems to me compatible with Kant's remark {KdrV, B686-687, slightly abridged below) that 26 Man kann sich die systematische Einheit unter den drei logischen Principien auf folgende Art sinnlich machen. Man kann einen jeden Begriff als einen Punkt ansehen, der als der Standpunkt eines Zuschauers seinen Horizont hat, d.i. eine Menge von Dingen, die aus demselben kdnnen vorgestellt und gleichsam iiber schauet werden. Innerhalb diesem Horizonte muG eine Menge von Punkten ins Vnendliche angegeben werden kdnnen, deren jeder wiederum seinen engeren Gesichtskreis hat;... und der logische Horizont besteht nur aus kleineren Hor izonten ..., nicht aber aus Punkten, die keinen Umfang haben (Individuen). Aber zu verschiedenen Horizonten, d.i.... die aus eben so viel Begriffen bestimmt werden, laBt sich ein gemeinschaftlicher Horizont, daraus man sie insgesamt als aus einem Mittelpunkte iiberschauet, gezogen denken, ...bis endlich ...derall gemeine und wahre Horizont .. .aus dem Standpunkte des hochsten Begriff s bestimmt wird und alle Mannigfaltigkeit als ...unter sich befaBt. One can make systematic unity [more] graphic [sensory] under the three logical principles in the following way. One can see an arbitrary concept as a point which as the standpoint of a viewer has its horizon, i.e., a set of things which can be represented from it and surveyed, as it were. Within this horizon, one must be able to posit a set of points in infinitum, each of which has its more limited field of vision, ...and the logical horizon consists only of smaller horizons, ...not of points, which have no extension (individuals). But to different horizons,.. .which are determined from different [corresponding] concepts, a common horizon, from which one can survey them all as [if] from a center, can be traced out in thought, .. .until finally .. .the general and true horizon is determined ...from the stand point of the highest concept, and the manifold comprehended .. .under it. Many other interesting if problematic things could be said about Kant's "Sinnlich machung" in the metalogical framework of this essay. In the ellipses of this passage, for example, he interpreted "Horizonte" as "Gattungen, Arten und Unterarten"..., whose most straightforward metalogical counterparts would be 27 (consistent and recursively defined) "types" or imbricated collections of unary predicates in the language of a given "intelligible" theory T. One could, moreover, define 28 binary, ternary, n-ary and 'nullary' "types" as well, and identify the latter with consistent, recursively axiomatisable theories which extend T. For each such type, one could also define &lt;£) Springer</page><page sequence="47">Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 4299 29 a 'canonical' boolean algebra (called its 'Lindenbaum algebra'), as well as corre sponding (topological)'Stone spaces'—mentioned earlier in 1.3 and 6.1-6.3—in which extensions of the given type determine closed subspaces. 'Complete' counterparts of such 'types', finally, could also be defined (as elements of the aforementioned 'Stone spaces'), but only in appropriate metatheories, and there would be uncountably many of them. The elements of such spaces-—metalogical analogues of Kant's "points, which have no extension"—would be "durchgdngig bestimmt", in Kant's language ("notiones cornpletae", in Leibniz'), but 'almost all' of them would fail to be 'intelligible', in the metalogical sense sketched earlier. One might try to assimilate Kant's "allgemeine(r) und wahre(r) Horizont" to an entire 'Stone space' of such 'points', and such spaces are indeed 'universal' in various topological and metatheoretic senses. But they are also isomorphic to spaces of infinite sequences of 'random' coin tosses, an observation which suggests that such ' Venunftideen' would degrade rather than embody informational 'truth'. For it is also known that every "intelligible" theory has the same Stone space, whose 'generality' and 'canonicity' would therefore render its 'reference-frame' useless for discrimination of one 'intelligible' theory from another. To me at least, such observations call to mind two well-known predicaments in the history of philosophy: 30 the immanent white noise of Spinoza's (1967) transcendent deus sive natura; and 31 Kant's remark that "concepts" without "intuitions" are "blind" (in the sense that every intelligible theory may be said to furnish its own class of "intuitions"). But it also suggests that a form of "Erhabenheit" may be found in 32 limitless 'universes' of 'intelligible' theories' interpretations and capacities for 'autological' [self]-reference, and that this 'sublimity' may be even more 'disproportionate' than Kant's "bestirnter Himmel" and the "two abysses" evoked in one of the most resonant passages of Pascal's (1963) Pensees: 33 Qui se considerera ...

Anyone who considers .. the two abysses of the infinite and the void, will tremble in the sight of its marvels, and I believe that—curiosity changing into admiration— will be more disposed to contemplate them in silence than explore them with presumption When one is learned, one comprehends that since nature has graven its image in ...all things, almost all of them have something of this double infinity, in this fashion we see that all forms of knowledge are infinite in the rangefs] of their inquiries....

This is what renders us unable to know with certainty, and be ignorant absolutely. In the essay's final section, I will 34 argue that the 'underdetermination' of ramified 'experiential' hierarchies—a frag ile and inadequate form of 'freedom'—has the dignity of one of its 'preconditions'; and 35 compare the "abimes" of its endless 'ramifications' with the deltas and estuaries of Norman MacLean's "river", in which faint traces might linger long after we cease to 'exist'. 8 Reflective inquiry as a form of skeptical "Theoria" In an unpublished essay called "Skeptical Theoria as a Regulative Ideal", I 1 compared phenomenal underdetermination to a 'transcendental' precondition of an activity I called 'skeptical theoria' (a 'via negativa'), and 2 assimilated such such theoria (or 'via contemplativa') to the "reine Selbsttatigkeit" ("pure self-actuation", Gr, 452) which Kant called Freiheit. I also observed that 3 the ancient skeptics attached a regulative (or 'contemplative') value they found significant to such epoche and the search for it. That 'regulative' value, I also suggested (cf. 1.9 and 5.15 above), is Aristotle's 'desire', not for 'knowledge', but for quasi-Kantian forms of 'disinterested' inquiry. For 'pyrrhonist' and 'academic' skeptics alike believed ('undogmatically', of course) that it conferred a kind of peace of mind they called "ataraxia" (roughly "equanimity", literally 'non-perturbation'), a word one also finds in Stoic and Epi curean writings. Also of interest, I believe, in the context of this essay's metalogical analogies, is the 'problematic' 'refiexivity' of such 'ataractic' self-attribution and 'practical' "self actuation". For both introduce—as Kant observed—an implicit 'critical' (or 'metathe oretical') distinction between a 'self and what calms or 'actuates' it. In "Skeptical Theoria" (1997) as well as (Boos 1987), I also outlined a related analogy between skeptical epoche about 'phenomenally' undecidable assertions, and '£j Springer</page><page sequence="49">Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 4301 (some of) the responses Immanuel Kant advocated to 'transcendent', 'antinomial' assertions of'pure reason', which are, by definition, undecidable within 'the' Bereich der Erscheinungen. I drew inspiration for this, in part, from Kant's own high valuation of the antinomies, despite his disparaging remarks about skepticism in the "Transcendental Method ology" (cf. KdrV, B784-B797), but also from the evidence canvassed in foregoing sections that 4 significant hermeneutic and alethic notions such as interpretability, definability, and (a fortiori) 'truth' may indeed be Kantian 'Grenzideen', rather than Kantian 'Begriffe'—in metalogic and in metaphysics; or at least that 5 such hermeneutic and alethic notions are relational notions: conjectural and schematic templates which our finite intellects are fortunate enough to be able to project for heuristic investigation and dialectical and practical inquiry. 'Disquotational' 'truth' of a theory, for example—Tarski's "Convention T"—is a jejune second-order template. Nothing substantive emerges from it until we refine it to the relational meatheoretic notion of'truth in a structure'. Even then, moreover, 'intelligible' first-order theories will propose infinitely many distinct candidates for such structures, which may be examined in infinitely many branching candidates for appropriate metatheories. 'Speculatively' as well as 'practically', therefore, attempts to formulate [selfj grounding 'intelligible' theories of the sort Descartes, Berkeley and Kant sought cannot escape a kind of complementarity between the intentional finitude of our conceptual horizons, and lack of closure of the concept-formation(s) we undertake within them. For 'intelligible' theories face a choice between two 'complementary' alternatives: undecidability and inexpressibility. This (literal) dilemma—a simple consequence, of Godel's insights into [internal] diagonalisation—may be posed as follows. Such a theory—of 'the self', say; or 'the world'; or Anselm's formula 'that than which nothing greater can be conceived' (Kant's "psychologische, kosmologische und theologische Ideen")—must itself be incomplete. It can formulate, but never prove, [its own] existence (consistency/interpretability). By simple contraposition, then: A complete limiting (meta)theory—not only of Kant's three Ideen, but also of 'the' distinctions Kant tries to draw between speculative and practical, Phaenomena and Noumena, Begriffe and Ideen, Vernunft and reflektierende Urteilskraft—would not be 'intelligible' and could not, a fortiori, formulate or express (encode) [its own] existence. To put a mildly provocative point on it: 6 if a 'canonical' intelligible theory T of 'experience' (or 'the god of the philosophers'; or'der heilige Wille'; or....) were provably 'complete' in some tacitly metatheoretic faithful extension U of T (i.e., if the extension U decided every assertion in the language of T), such a 'proof would bear witness to the inconsistency of U as well as T. This recurrent complementarity—between intelligibility (or expressibility) and putative (metatheoretic) universality—seems to me to take many forms in the his Springer</page><page sequence="50">4302 Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 tory of philosophy, as I've tried to suggest in Sect. 3's examinations of the arguments of Descartes, Berkeley and Kant. More precisely, I have argued that we cannot ensure, or even canonically express, certain ideals and Grenzideen, with anything like the constitutive Vollstandigkeit and semantic unicity that most classical metaphysicians (and most analytic philosophers) have demanded of (and casually attributed to) 'truth'. I have also tried to suggest 7 that such semantic Vollstandigkeit (completeness) is what is really at issue—as Kant saw—in classical metaphysical examinations of the [self], and of 'the god of the philosophers' and Kant's three Ideen; and More controversially, I have argued 8 that one can trace a number of analogies and between other metaphysicians' 'pro bative' arguments made on behalf of these Ideen and Kant's tacit appeals to 'tran scendental' design-arguments and the 'archimedean' leverage he attributed to his 'critical' distinctions and 'transcendental deductions'; and 9 that the "durchgangige Bestimmung" Kant claimed to have 'deduced' for 'the' 'constitutive' structure of 'experience' may be assimilated to the indeterminate "Vollstandigkeit der Bedingungen" he (cogently) characterised in the Dialectic as a kind of underlying master-Vernunftidee. In defense of the 'locality' of 'critical' theory/metatheory-distinctions, I have also argued that we have no 'ultimate' decision-procedure which would enable us once and for all to discern, in our 'theoretical' and metatheoretical inquiries, proof from [proof] (existence from [existence]; consistency from [consistency]; ....). Particular theories, for example—or at least their more feasible axiomatic approximations—may be 'locally' immanent. But their 'intended interpretations'— even 'the' 'intended' interpretations of theories as 'obvious' as Peano arithmetic (an axiomatisation of 'the' natural numbers)—are 'locally' but recurrently transzendent. Such 'intended interpretations' are surely 'abstractions' in some sense, if anything is. But such abstracta—which are not to be identified with the theories themselves, for this quickly gives rise to semantic paradoxes—require even more 'abstract' metathe ories in which their 'intentions' can be grounded. Even then, moreover, they are (I would suggest once again) either 10 theory-relative placeholders, which ride indefinite regresses of ascents of metathe oretic 'forms'; or 11 'noumenal notions which are inexpressible in [themselves] (the echo of Kant's usage is once again deliberate). On the processive account of 'experience' I have offered, the former are problematic but recurrently 'immanent'. The latter, by contrast, promote the notion of an 'intended interpretation' to the level of its conceptual incompetence. For nothing can (provably) 'ground' or'interpret' what it cannot express—an obser vation which often seems to me to have eluded metaphysicians and philosophers of language who engage in relationally unqualified talk about 'truth'. Correlatively, attempts to 'ground' (end) metatheoretic ascent in [self] -interpretation—allegedly secured in the sort of 'last' metatheory considered in Sects. 2 and 3—seem to me Springer</page><page sequence="51">Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 4303 12 parade-examples of what Kant called "transzendent(al)er Schein" (cf. KdrV, B352 ff.), on a more or less equal basis with attempts to ground 'the god of the philoso phers' in [self~]-causation, [sell]-origination, [self\-organisation, or [self\-design. Indeed, Kant's attempts to 'intend' and secure a canonical extratheoretic interpreta tion of a collective (as well as subreptively uniform) [self], first, would seem to parallel rather closely Descartes' attempt to do this for a 'psychological' [self], along the lines outlined above in Sects. 2 and 3. More generally, 'secular' efforts to find last, 'perfect', self-realising metatheories for such (putatively) 'universal' notions aspire to 'complete' [themselves], in ways which recall ontological, 'cosmological', 'physico-theological' and other 'regress' ending attempts to beg 'theological' notions of ultimate 'design'. Methodologically, for example, 13 claims that'all' of mathematical physics (say)—or'all' 'real' knowledge of a lan guage, for that matter—can be subsumed in some elusively 'intended' or 'intuitive' interpretation of'physics'—or what it 'really' 'is' to 'speak a language'— seem to me closely cognate to 14 Pascal's baffling embrace of Jansenist dogma; Spinoza's admirably stoic (but con ceptually ill-posed) assertions about'deus sive natura'; Leibniz' more sympathetic (but equally ill-posed)'principe de la raison suffisante'-, and Kant's transzenden tale Verstandeseinheit, whose 'deduction' he acknowledged would have to be a Geschdft der Vernunft in KdrV, B692. For such 'global' and 'universal' interpretations are all theory-marginal, in the sense that they would have to be 'intended' and re-'intended' in ever-wider metathe ories. But the more 'global' one's theoretical aspirations—and more 'holist' one's 'contemplation' or theoria—the more open to metatheoretic ascent and emergent reinterpretation(s) such aspirations and theoria will have to be. Such tensions already appeared in Gaunilo's shrewd suggestion that limiting cases of the 'conception' and 'perfection' Anselm wanted us to 'conceive' and mentally 'perfect' might either be 'trivial', or at least imperfect ('the most perfect island') or inconceivable. They also recurred more strikingly in Hume's (or "Philo'"s) brilliantly formulated suggestions in the quotation from the Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion which began this essay—that 'human' notions of [design] might provide very dubious tem plates for theological extrapolation. In Kant's case, I have argued, there is also a sense in which he offered 'cogito'-like 'transcendental arguments' as attempts 15 to furnish (or beg) a collective counterpart of Descartes' individual (but allegedly generic) 'existence'-proof, and 16 derive the 'existence of the external world' (as well as a resolution of Descartes' 'substantial-union'-problem) from the alleged exhaustiveness and universality of such a 'complete' and 'necessarily possible' collective 'intentionality'. But if what is intentionally 'possible' is collapsed in such ways to what is experi entially 'real'—a not entirely distortive thumbnail-sketch of Kant's 'critical' rationale Springer</page><page sequence="52">4304 Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 for Berkeleyan and Humean proposals—another variant of the recurrent dilemma I've tried to canvass presents itself: either 17 one opens 'experience' to embrace indefinite hierarchies of provisional forms of semantic paradox; or 18 one acknowledges that 'experience' is an inexpressible and almost neoplatonic 'ideal', and its alleged 'closure' a mystical as well as unintelligible 'ultimate' semantic paradox. One might construe this dichotomy as a sort of conceptual 'zero-one-law', or coun terpart of Niels Bohr's "komplementaritatif it is not the case that'everything intel ligible' is 'problematic', what'ensures' us that 'it' is 'unintelligible'? Put in yet another form: we seem to want (or in our more judicious moods, 'pos tulate') 'complete' knowledge and 'complete' (unique) interpretation (cf. Pascal's acknowledgment that "le silence eternel de ces espaces infinis m 'effraie"). But all we can 'intelligibly' (or 'reasonably') attain is incomplete 'understanding', conjectural as well as plurally interpretable clarification, and fleeting forms of a-letheia ('non-ignorance'), rather than 'ultimate' 'truth'. Postulations of'complete' knowledge,'objective' truth and 'unique' interpretation, like postulations of 'ultimate' subjective 'enlightenment', may be little more than thinly veiled projections of intellectual vanity and vicarious aspirations to metaphysical immortality. So much for what might be called the via negativa of skeptical theoria ("contemplation"), a dialectical interpellation which emerges—I have argued—from fairly straightforward forms of metalogical analysis. Its analogon—partially and tantalisingly reflected in the remarks of writers such as Nicholas of Cusa—is the skeptical via contemplativa evoked in 1.9, at length in Sect. 5, passim in Sect. 7 and more briefly in 8.1-8.3 above. By way of transition to such a 'way' or 'path', consider first the following remarks and conjectures about the differences between 'skepticism' and 'mysticism'. 19 We tend to see more 'simply' 'organised' systems as 'instruments' for 'us' (or at least for Kant's "empirisches ich"). 20 We are more reluctant (quite understandably) to regard 'ourselves' as mere 'means' or 'instruments' for 'others', whether or not they are more 'complex' than 'we' are. 21 We tend finally to beg the 'existence' and 'uniqueness' of 'gods', 'theodicies' and ineffably complex secular 'designs' as Wunschvorstellungen of what might 'confirm' or at least '(over)see' 'us'. "Intellectual vanity" aside, there seems to me a prima facie tension between 20 and 21, just above, thrown into sharper relief by Hume's thumbnail critique of anthropomorphic 'idealism' ("What particular privilege has this little Agitation of the Brain....") in the Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion (1976), cited earlier. I have already argued, in effect, that such a tension defines that work's principle (and proto-'critical') disputatio— 22 whether the 'deist' "Cleanthes" can define a tenable 'critical' middle-ground between the 'skeptic' "Philo'"s deconstructive counterexamples, and the quasi 4^1 Springer</page><page sequence="53">Synthese (2014) 191:425 3-4314 4305 'mystical' commonplaces of "Demea", a Christian straw-man who stands in for the much more searching 'fideist' musings of Blaise Pascal— and tried to offer suggestive metalogical evidence that "he" ("Cleanthes") cannot. To see why I find this 'evidence' persuasive, consider first my suggestion that 23 "Demea'"s modest rhapsodies are indeed little more than faint echoes of much more eloquent passages from the Pensees, one of which I have already quoted, but 24 Pascal's evocations of our "disproportion" play a propaedeutic role in his larger dogmatic argument, as (at least arguably) did comparable invocations of ineffable infinities in the Enneads of Plotinus and Ethica of Spinoza. In response to worthy defenders of these and other forms of 'semantic monism" (animated by a "monistic pathos", in Lovejoy's words, 1965), I have endeavored to 25 interpret skeptical"criterialproblems" and "lapse\s\ into infinities]" as generative structures worth further study; 26 argue that 'ultimate' metaphysical 'unities' 'deduced'—by Spinoza, among others—from begged dichotomic premises are metalogically 'unintelligibleand 27 offer'locally transcendental' interpretations of a "pluralistic pathos" in which ram ifying 'intentional' hierarchies reflect Kant's "moral law within us", and ramifying 'intensional' hierarchies reflect Kant's 'starred heaven(s) above us". This then is the skeptical counterpart of the dogmatic 'via contemplativa', men tioned earlier: a 'reflective' 'pathos' of limitless 'critical' hierarchies for 28 Demea's (and Pascal's) metalogically untenable fideism, and Cleanthes' (and Kant's) metalogically untenable "middle way". One indication of the latter's 'untenability' may be found in Kant's 'critically' calibrated claims to have to 'deduced' the 'necessary existence' and unique inter pretability of'experience' from its 'possibility'. For such formulations have appeared almost word for word in certain modal logi cians' claims to 'formalise' Anselm's 'proof' of the 'necessary existence' and unique interpretability of 'god' from its 'conceivability'. In §90 of the third Critique, moreover (which bears the interesting title "Von der Art des Fiirwahrhaltens in einem teleologischen Beweis des Dasein Gottes"; "On the Manner of Holding-to-Be-True in a Teleological Proof of the Existence of God"), Kant struggled in 1790 to formulate 29 "analogical" notions of "proof" which might apply to 'teleological' insights, desires for 'higher' forms of justice and other 'merely regulative' aspects of 'rea son'^ 'fate'. In this essay, I have tried to propose 30 analogical' notions of 'proof' in limitless metatheoretic and hypotheoretic hier archies as 'intelligible' media for the expression of 'reason"s 'fate', as well as Kant's 'secular humanist' ideals. &lt;£) Springer</page><page sequence="54">4306 Synthese (2014) 191:4253—4314 In accordance with the 'via negativa' sketched earlier, much may be processively 'hidden' and 4uncovered' in such 'experiential' hierarchies (contra Wittgenstein), in the sense that 31 no 'intelligible' theoretical 'horizon' is or will ever be 'comprehensive', for exam ple (much less 'define' its own 'azimuth'); 32 'merely regulative' postulation of certain forms and probabilistic extensions of mefamathematical deduction are all the 'inductive confirmation' we should antic ipate; and 33 Galileo's mathematical "book" and its 'intelligible' metamathematical extensions are 'physically' as well as 'metaphysically' 'precise' to the extent they are con ceptually (and generatively) 'heuristic' and 'intelligible'. In keeping with such Leitmotive, I have also argued that Kant's 'critical' attempts to discern 'concepts' from 'ideas of reason' led him to a valuable (and 'heuristically' generative) insight: 34 that such methodological clarifications and 'synthetic' realisations of otherwise uninterpreted syntactical evidence are—'locally', but 'inherently'—semantic and metatheoretic rather than 'immanent'; and 35 that his tacit acknowledgments in the Dialektic and third Critique that such metatheoretical undertakings might be—'locally' but recurrently—'transzendent' suggest two more skeptical, 'neo-Kantian' conjectures: that 36 the very 'intelligibility' of ('our') 'experience' renders its 'realisations' (its "Ver wirklichungen" or "Vergegenstandlichungen") provisional, plurally interpretable and inherently incomplete and 'merely regulative'-, and finally that 37 attempts to analyse and argue more precisely about such 'realisations' may lead us into hierarchies—also 'local', but deeply heuristic as well as 'merely' regulative— of 'intended (re)interpretations'of 'ourselves' as well as our 'experiences'. 'Local' and 'heuristic' notions of 'truth', 'completeness' and '{intended) interpretation', after all—like their 'absolute' dogmatic counterparts—are closely interrelated with (equally 'local' and 'heuristic') notions of 'design'. And these, in turn, yield 'critical' rationales for 'essentially incomplete' notions of 'knowledge','structure' and understanding'—'inductive understanding', for exam ple, that one 'knows' (provisionally, and in certain feasibly characterisable situations) 'how to go on'. Like 'design', 'truth' and the other epistemic and metaphysical ideals just cited make sense for a given theory, in a particular metatheory. 'Contemplatively' invalu able, they become delusive—and 'dogmatic' as well as uninformative—only when they too are raised to the level of their incompetence in vain efforts to 'diagonalise' them over 'all' theories in 'all' metatheories. (We tend to lose sight, once again, of the facts that a 'proof' was originally a 'test' (a 'probatio'), and 'truth', in English, derived from a common germanic verb which meant to '(en)trusf or 'believe'.) I have also tried to argue at various points that Springer</page><page sequence="55">Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 4307 38 iterated 'zetetic' recourse to metatheoretic clarification and refinement may be heuristically 'instrumental', where 39 'instruments'' are ('locally') object-theoretic 'means' to more 'systematic' but counterfactual as well as potentially heuristic ('locally') metatheoretic 'ends'. In particular, such 'means' or 'instruments' are object-theoretic with respect to what (conceptually or metatheoretically) 'instrumentalises' them, and 'experience' organises' 'means' and 'ends' in metalogical hierarchies of 'object'- and 'concept' formation which ramify without end. (In this sense, what I wish to offer is a form of skeptical as well as 'locally transcen dental idealism', which hearkens back to Lucretius' 'alphabet', as well as the 'logica magna' Leibniz sought.) In their efforts to explain 'physical' 'experience', for example, mathematicians and mathematical-physicists—Galileo's successors—resorted to more and more elabo rate metatheories to 'define' (or posit'existence' of) object-theoretic 'instruments' as 'means' to more and more subtle (and conceptually 'elegant') physical' ends. Mindful of this, I have tried to argue that mathematically literate metaphysicians and epistemologists—Kant's successors—should search ('zetetically') for more elab orate 'intelligible' metatheories to 'define' (or posit 'existence' of) object-theoretic 'instruments' as 'means' to subtler (and more conceptually 'elegant') 'intended' inter pretations of 40 'cognitive' ends which clarify, at least provisionally, 'liminal' notions of'identity', 'awareness' and 'individual consciousness', and 41 'ethical' and'deontological' ends which clarify, even more provisionally, collec tively 'liminal' notions of 'equity', 'dignity', 'equanimity' and 'collective moral sensibility'. If these analogies are tenable, one might also characterise 42 Hume's and Kant's 'idealist' efforts to clarify 'physical' patterns in terms of'cog nitive' counterparts as an attempt to clarify subtilia in subtiliora, and 43 Kant's "Primatdes Praktischen" as a conjecture that'ethical' and 'deontological' ends or aims may be 'deeper' and more conceptually complex than their'physical' and 'cognitive' counterparts. Kant's'counterfactual' and 'nonconstructive' uses of "Regel" and "regulativ", for example, were as ambiguously suggestive as Hume's ambiguous attempts to define "Cause" in §60 of the first Enquiry. Perhaps it is 'regulative' of broader forms of 'experience' that we can 'nonconstructively' 'anticipate' schematic patterns we can not 'determinately' 'understand'? Graduated forms of 'consciousness', in particular, might be attributed to Sect. 6's 'systems' (or more accurately to metastable patterns of such systems' evolution in appropriate Stone spaces), to the extent they 44 range 'freely' over 'internal' interpretations of [themselves], and 'external' inter pretations of [what might be beyond themselves]; where 45 'freedom'—like its 'physical'counterparts—is an inherently contextual and rela tional as well as graduated notion: 4^ Springer</page><page sequence="56">4308 Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 46 a system is 'free' to the extent the range and complexity of its responses exceed that of any 'internal' or 'external' initial and boundary-conditions it may 'take into account' in formulation of such responses. Admittedly, all these conjectures and analogies are 'impressionistic', and concep tually (much) more inchoate and rudimentary than I would wish them to be. But I believe they may be heuristically useful, and more particularly, that the indefinite extendibility of metatheoretic 'ascent' and the non-'well-foundedness' of hypotheoretic descent' are dual aspects of intelligibility which 'mirror' each other in heuristically useful ways. 'Hypotheoretic' attributions of grades of 'intention', 'cognition' and 'autonomy', for example, may 'mirror' 'metatheoretic' attributions of 'interpretation', 'verifica tion' and 'experimental isolation'. ("The way up and the way down are one and the same.") 'Reflective inquiry', in this context, is inquiry in localisable stages of such hierar chies, and in their indefinitely iterable intentional ascents and intensional descents. As 'we' 'see' 'simpler' conative and cognitive structures, so may more 'complex' conative and cognitive structures 'see' 'us'. ("Whatever ye do to the least of these....") Consider, by way of partial summary, the following assertions and (rhetorical) questions. Kant's 'transzendentale Methode' was arguably an attempt to make a certain sort of 'sufficient ('synthetic a priori') reason' a fixed point for [itself]. One might construe the arguments of this essay as an attempt to make metalogical 'inquiry' be an (endlessly transitional, but conceptually persistent) fixed point for [itself]. Contrary to Kant's express views in the Analytic, the more "rein" and "a priori" a theory (or "Erkenntnis") is, the more (metalogically) incomplete it is, and (therefore) the less "vollstandig" it can be. Might this be a form of'practical' as well conceptual 'complementarity' ? The "Vollstdndigkeit" Kant attributed to "experience" was "constitutivebut that of ideas-of reason ('merely') "regulative". Might recognition that both forms of inquiry and concept-formation are 'essentially' incomplete, be a mark of John Keats' 'negative capability' (cited above), as well as the Wiirde (dignity) Kant attributed to 'reasonable beings'? These questions are "rhetorical" in the sense that I find 'good reasons' to believe (but cannot 'prove') that the 'contemplative' answer to each is "yes". For it seems a mark of stoic epistemic virtue and awareness of our boundless limitations to continue to inquire and observe, knowing that 'the' path(s) branch in liminally unobservable directions. It may even be a mark of some sort of epistemic or conceptual 'existentialism' (in which the 'essence' of 'essential incompleteness' 'precedes' 'existence'). Indeed, an awareness of'reason'sfate' and its Sisyphean nature may be part of that 'fate', as well as a regulative ideal of Kant's "reasonable beings". But it might also (as I suggested earlier) be one of their more 'enlightened' cradle-gifts. (To paraphrase Beckett: "I 'must' go on. I can't go on. I 'will' (to) go on....") &lt;£) Springer</page><page sequence="57">Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 4309 Aristotle's 'desire to know', for example, is not simply 'sensory'. It is also the desire to 'value' and to 'cherish' (This is a kind of 'cognition'). And a broader and more 'reflective' as well as 'practical' form of this is the desire to 'value' and 'cherish' what can 'value' and 'cherish'. To 'know' is to recognise what (apparently) 'is'. To 'value' is to recognise (or 'contemplate') what may be, or might have been. To form a 'purpose' and 'evaluate' alternative 'means' to attain it is to form a (usually counterfactual, and in all cases metatheoretic) 'plan' in keeping with such 'recognition' or 'contemplation'. Such a plan, finally, is (practically) good to the extent it'values' the (indeterminate) plurality and range of other 'reasonable beings" 'plans'. What is 'just' is what 'reaches out' (the original semantic sense of Aristotle's "desire"), by analogy with what is 'felt within' (the 'golden rule'). This is 'regulative' of equity and other 'practically' significant forms of empathy and sympathy. An absence of both in a 'cognitive system' is not'irrational'. But it is (metatheoret ically) 'unreasonable'. It marks the absence or suppression of a form of higher-order awareness. The distinction between 'irrational' and 'unreasonable' is 'practical', metatheo retical, inherently 'liminal' and 'merely regulative' at every stage of 'experience'. Refusal or inability to make this distinction is a dogmatic 'cognitive' deficiency or lack of 'sensibility' (or a deliberate attempt to dissemble, 'blunt' or 'coarsen' certain 'natural' forms of cognitive awareness). There is also a fairly clear parallel between Hume's de facto assimilation of "con ceivable" to "consistent", Kant's 'categorical imperative' and Kant's assimilation of "giiltigfiir uns" = allgemeingultig fiir jedermann" ("valid for us" = "universally valid for everyone"; Pr, 1976, Sects. 18-19); Both conflate "inconceivable to 'us'" with "inconceivable relative to a(n allegedly normalised but subreptively begged) conception of 'us' (of what 'we' are). (For comparison, cf. also Kant's remarks about "nur komparative Allgemeingiiltigkeit"— "merely comparative universal validity", Sects. 18-19). Such conflation may also be construed as a begged assertion that 'the' theory of ['the' world] is a faithful or conservative extension of 'our' theory of [the world], whatever Dinge an sich it may hypothetically adjoin. If, moreover, 'the world"s interpretation were faithful, as in the analysis of 'cogito' like arguments sketched earlier, it would assure a not-so-desirable form of equicon sistency. 47 'the world' would be consistent iff'I' am (or in Kant's case, iff'we' are). A 'solipsist' metalogical consequence of this—that 'the world' would cease to 'exist' iff'I' cease to 'exist'—would effectively nullify Kant's categorical imperative, as well as the 'skeptical' variant I proposed above: 48 to treat others not as (mere) means, but as (vulnerable as well as 'reasonable' beings in search of 'higher') ends in (and beyond) themselves. Springer</page><page sequence="58">4310 Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 Given also that 'strong' interpretations of 'us' and 'our' world-views are not 'faith ful' in the metalogical sense outlined earlier, the more relevant epistemic as well as 'practical' question would not seem to me 49 whether 'absolute' (ethical or epistemic) norms, standards or criteria 'exist'; but rather—given the metalogical'unintelligibility' of'absolute' norms, standards and criteria in the senses outlined above— 50 whether (and when) it is reasonable for sentient beings to impose their norms, standards or criteria as such. Along similar lines, it also seems to me that dicta that "everything is determined" would not imply that 'everything is forgivable' (on the model of "tout comprendre, c 'est tout pardonner"), but rather that 51 'practical' notions of 'forgiveness' and 'sympathy' as well as 'responsibility' would have no meaning..for 52 a 'free' being which refused to admit its actions might be wrong would be an inconsistent cognitive as well as ethical agent, in the sense that 53 nothing could be 'right'—'practically' or ethically 'right'—to a being which could not admit—'wholeheartedly' admit—that it might be wrong. A 'rational' being is also'practical' as well as 'reasonable' to the extent it acknowl edges that it is neither unique nor self-sufficient, and undertakes to seek to 'respect' cognate desires and forms of awareness in its (apparent) 'semblables'. At every stage of 'reflective inquiry', this awareness is graduated, underdetermined and physically vulnerable. But its absence is a 'cognitive' deficiency all the same, in the sense that it closes itself to broader forms of semantic 'awareness'. For zetetic inquiry is not only regulative of 'experience'. It is also, it seems to me, a 'liminal' form—and perhaps prototype—of Kant's "Zweckmafiigkeit ohne Zweck" and other 'nonconstructive' notions one might devise, such as 54 "GefiihIsmdfiigkeit ohne (eindeutig determinierte) Gefiihl(e)"; "Regelmafiigkeit ohne (eindeutig determinierte) Regel(n); "Rechtmafiigkeit ohne (eindeutig determiniertes) Recht"', "Gesetzmafiigkeit ohne {eindeutig determiniertes) Gesetz"', ■■■■ To the extent such "-mafligkeiten" urge respect for honest inquiry, they may express something like Kant's "purely good will" as well as Aristotle's 'desire to 'know". And respect for them enjoins us to value two forces which through the green fuse drive the flower: 'desire' for 'understanding' and 'sympathy' 'within' us', and 'awe' for the 'starredfirmament' 'above' us. The 'desire' in particular, takes many forms: a desire to (continue to be part of) (conscious) 'experience'; a desire to 'understand' the diapason of 'experience' in ways which cannot be fulfilled; and a desire to seek, value and protect that fragile 'understanding' as the 'reason' of 'reasonable beings'. Kant had a point, therefore, about the 'intentional' and 'self-referential' aspects of epistemic, 'practical', aesthetic, and 'reflective' 'autonomy'. But autonomous Springer</page><page sequence="59">Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 4311 'selves'—essentially by definition—have no 'ultimate' clarification of what it 'is' they are supposed to 'legislate', or 'ultimate' intelligible 'aim' to which everything else is 'reduced' or 'interpreted'. For the self-referentiality of 'intelligible' 'Selbstgesetzgebung' and 'Selbstzwecke' must be incomplete and 'problematic', in the sense that they are assertible only in processively metatheoretic contexts which must provisionally be resolved in yet 'higher' 'coded' counterparts. Any conceptual act which claimed to 'verify [its own] 'existence' (or "Reinheit", or 'experimental isolation', or ....)' would therefore undo the 'verification', by rela tivising the 'existence' (or "Reinheit", or 'experimental isolation', or ....). 'The' boundary line between Kantian 'reason' and 'experience' is also (in)determinate iff 'the' boundary between Kantian 'analytic' and 'synthetic' is (in)determinate iff 'the' boundaries between Kantian 'Spekulation' and 'Praxis' and 'Spekulation' and 'Reflexion' are (in)determinate. The more 'global' one's theoretical aspirations, therefore—and the more 'holist' one's theory or theoria—the more open to metatheoretic ascent and emergent reinter pretation(s) such aspirations and theoria will have to be. The broader the Rechtmafligkeit of Deduktion becomes, the less clear it is why it is not simply 'reflective', 'regulative' and 'problematisch', and the more suggestive the thought that such breadth is a 'good" thing. Skeptical 'theoria' ('contemplation') and the forms of ataraxia ('peace of mind) also have their own ' light'-images—skepsis itself, for example, and Horizonte among them—which reflect (and reflect on) their more 'dogmatic' and 'hieratic' counterparts (Plato's eide, Descartes' intuitio, neo-Platonic 'emanations', ....). Incomplete and inadequate as the skeptical images are, they are at least more 'open' to further 'clarification', for they are exquisitely 'relational', by definition as well as programmatic intent ('insight' against what 'backlight'? 'scrutiny' and 'enlighten ment' 'relative' to what source? 'escape' in which 'direction', and toward which form(s) of greater 'illumination' ?) Unlike Plato's (literally 'linear') 'line' and Kant's 'two truths', such images also evoke a distributive and 'graduated' skeptical counterpart of Aristotle's 'theoretical' noesis noeseos (thought about thought), whose ramifications suggest to me a great tree of conceptual life. The 'abstraction' characteristic of metalogical analysis is a counterpart of 'egal itarianism' in ethics, and 'experimental isolation' in 'natural philosophy'. (Cf. also Kant's "rein" and "a priori") These views seem to me to reflect elusive egalitarian ideals of Kantian ethics which transcend his secular-pietist preoccupation with 'absolute' forms of 'duty', and enjoin us to 'respect' fleeting nuances of 'consciousness' which 'reasonable beings' inter mittently enjoy, and may (or may not) endeavor to 'respect' in their fellows. Such genuine egalitarianism is a 'merely regulative' ideal. And intelligible "Zwecke" 'exist' only in provisional stages or levels of Zweckmafiigkeit. But the very openness and incompleteness of such ideals may offer a glimpse into comparably 'open' aspects of moral eternity. &lt;£) Springer</page><page sequence="60">4312 Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 For whatever "particular privilege .... this little Agitation of the Brain" may have (in response to the opening remark from Hume's Dialogues), it is probably not particular to 'us'. And complex 'intentional' "systems" of "inquiry" which "ramify" with what they "discover" may be 'regulative' of other (would-be) 'reasonable beings', which may pose or have posed similar questions, in the past, in the future, or "in another galaxy, long ago and far away". What rides the wavefronts of 'for the sake of which' (so to speak) is ('reflective') 'consciousness', which flourishes as it inquires, in unfinished forms of 'eudaimonia' as well as 'theoria'. And it is about this we should be generous and egalitarian (the 'categorical imperative', like the 'golden rule', is a moral'identity of indiscernibles' principle.) Aspirations to understand deeper aspects of this ideal are 'desirable in themselves', and collectively, they afford a kind of scheme of provisional fixed-points for what I have called 'reflective inquiry'. The conviction that we can make 'reflective' appeals to 'merely' regulative ideals of such 'schematic fixed points' is a regulative ideal 'in itself'. But it requires (as a 'precondition', so to speak) that we accept (in simple terms) that 55 it's all 'problematic', for expressible ('intelligible')'contemplation' must be incomplete. (Compare James' first 'free' intentional 'act', to 'believe' in his 'freedom' to act.) The skeptic's first 'un(der)determined' intentional act is to 'believe' in skepti cal 'un(der)determination'—as something 'known to reason alone' and 'known from (within) 'experience". None of this provides any 'final' resolution for the questions which eternally recur. Which "systems", for example? 'Consciousness of 'what'! Where will it 'end'! To interrogate ourselves in this way is to pose questions, once again (such as Kant's drei Fragen in KdrV, B 832-833 and Logik, IX, A 25), "die sie .. .nicht beantworten kann, denn sie iibersteigen alles Vermogen der men schlichen Vernunft" {KdrV, A VII, cited earlier) ("which one.. .cannot answer, for they exceed every capacity of human reason").... The same recurrent tensions also evoked one of Pascal's deepest and most'existen tial' (as well as 'secular') insights in the following well-known passage, elliptically quoted earlier, and perhaps the most eloquent evocation ever written of the sort of courage Kierkegaard later attributed (dismissively) to his 'knight of infinite resigna tion' (in the original Danish simply 'knight of infinity'—' Uendelighedens Ridder'): La derniere demarche de la raison est de reconnaitre qu'il y a une infinite des choses qui la surpassent.... L'homme n'est qu'un roseau, le plus faible de la nature, mais c'est un roseau pensant. II ne faut pas que l'univers entier s'arme pour l'ecraser; une vapeur, une goutte d'eau suffit pur le tuer. Mais quand l'univers l'ecraserait, l'homme serait encore plus noble que ce qui le tue, puisqu'il sait qu'il meurt et l'avantage que l'univers a sur lui. L'univers n'en sait rien. &lt;£) Springer</page><page sequence="61">Synthese (2014) 191:4253-4314 4313 Toute notre dignite consiste done en la pensee.

(Pensees, 188 and 200) The last step of reason is to recognise that there are an infinity of things that surpass it.... A human being is a reed, the weakest of nature, but it is a thinking reed. It isn't necessary for the whole universe to take arms to crush it; a vapor, a waterdrop is enough to kill it. But when the universe crushes it, the human being is still nobler than what kills it, for it knows that it is dying and the advantage the universe has over it. The universe knows nothing. All our dignity consists therefore in thought. It's from there we should take our orientation, and not from space and time, which we cannot fill. So let us work to think well: this is the principle of morals.
