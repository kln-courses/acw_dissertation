<plain_text><page sequence="1">Re-making the Georgic Connection: Virgil and Cather's My Antonia* KAREN SIMONS Willa Cather's famous Virgilian epigraph to My Antonia alerts the reader to the novel's deep engagement with the Georgics. This paper advocates a positive interpretation of the relationship between the two by exploring the role of the poem in the life and "memoirs" of Jim Burden, the novel's narrator. In contrast to currently received notions about the poem's "pastoralizing" influence, it argues that the Georgics illumines the Nebraska prai- rie and the farmers who toiled there, enabling Jim to perceive and articulate their vitality and worth. Through Jim's story of remembrance and return, Cather ultimately presents the literary tradition, and the Georgics in particular, as a beneficent force capable of creat- ing connections among human beings, the natural world, the past and present. I In his study of the literary appropriation of Virgil between the two world wars, Theodore Ziolkowski traces the history of high regard the Georgics has enjoyed. Dryden, for one, called it "the most complete, elaborate, and finished piece of all antiquity" (109), and John Quincy Adams "the most perfect composition, that ever issued from the mind of man" (148). Jim Burden, the narrator of Willa Cather's My Antonia, joins this august company when he calls the poem a "perfect utterance" (Antonia 256). According to Ziolkowski, Jim's creator is an "exemplary figure" for the "traditional American view of Virgil" as a poet of rural values (148). Willa Cather (1873-1947) began learning Latin at the age of nine when her family moved from Virginia to Nebraska. She learned at home at first, under the supervision of both her grandmothers (Lewis 13-14). After her family moved into the town of Red Cloud, she studied Greek and Latin with William Ducker, a retired classical scholar from England (19). Under his instruction she read Virgil, Ovid, Homer, and Anacreon (Slote, "Willa" x). Her program in English at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln included two years of Latin, and Cather elected to take three years of Greek as well, studying "Pindar, Homer, Herodotus, the dramatists" (xi). The teacher of Greek at that time was Johns Hopkins educated James T. Lees, who had studied under the classicist Basil L. Gildersleeve (Slote, "Writer" 8-9).1 During summers home from college, Cather read Virgil with her brother Roscoe (Bennett 119). I remain grateful to William R. Macnaughton for his advice on the original version of this essay, a portion of which was presented at the 1997 Interdisciplinary Symposium of The Center for Great Plains Studies at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln. I would also like to thank the Killam Trusts for the postdoctoral fellowship that enabled me to expand and refine my ideas, as well as Wolfgang Haase and the anonymous readers for IJCT who helped make this a stronger paper. 1.

As Donald Sutherland says, citing Cather's excruciating attempt at teaching high school Latin, She could not bring herself without agony to a scholar's meticulous care for the details of Latin grammar .... Toward people who devote their lives to that kind of thing her feeling is not amusement so much as dismay at the waste of precious time which might be spent on some larger or livelier purpose. (156) Sutherland lists some of her errors in Latin as indicators of her artistic rather than scholarly commitments (156-57). But he also maintains that she was "deeply influ- enced" by Latin literature nonetheless (157), and that she may well have been "steeped in the Classics" and as "Virgilian, specifically, as she has been said to be" (159). This immersion in the classics is evident in much of her writing, as Sutherland and Ziolkowski both observe, but it is in My Antonia (1918) that "Virgil clearly informs the whole" (Ziolkowski 150). Here Cather creates a narrator as Virgilian as herself. The biographical similarities between Cather and Jim Burden have often been rehearsed.2 Like her, he moved from Virginia to Nebraska at a young age to live with his grand- parents. He moved into the town of "Black Hawk" for high school where he began reading Virgil (Antonia 224). At the university in Lincoln he came under the tutelage of Cleric, evidently "modeled on" one of Cather's own professors, Herbert Bates (Woodress, Ronning et al. 466). But even before the reader meets the narrator, Cather gives almost explicit instructions to read the novel in light of the poem. The epigraph, "Optima dies ... prima fugit," from Georgics 3.66-8, alerts us to the references and parallels to come. This was no minor decision on the part of an author who regarded the very type face, size of margins, and colour and texture of paper as important to the reader's experience of the novel (Mignon f.ix). When a new edition of the novel was being prepared in 1930, Cather revealed a stronger attachment to the epigraph than to the original Benda illustrations (Mignon 497). The line re-appears in Book 3 of Jim's narration as he recalls his days in Lincoln and how he pondered Virgil's desire "to bring the Muse" to his "patria" (256), a passage which highlights Jim's own (as well as Cather's) impulse to write about Antonia and Nebraska. Evidently, Erik Thurin is right to claim that a sound reading of the novel requires "a correct reading of the many allusions to Vergil" (Thurin 204). But many critics who have considered the novel's georgic element in the last twenty-five years have tended to see it as a nostalgic, idealizing "pastoral" lens.3 David Stouck characterizes the novel as a "pastoral of innocence" (46). Pastoral, he says, "marks a retreat in time and place to an enclosed, green world" safe from the 2. The most convenient and systematic account can be found in the "Historical Essay" by James Woodress included in the Scholarly Edition (369-82). 3. On the earlier critical reception of My Antonia see John J. Murphy (10-18), and on Cather's work in general see Joan Acocella (17-36). Briefly, as Acocella relates, the "prairie novels," including My Antonia, were initially welcomed by critics weary of reading about Boston high-society; they wanted fiction about "ordinary" rural and small-town people (17-18). To a new generation of critics in the 1920s, however, who wanted novels of "postwar disillu- sionment," Cather appeared "old-fashioned" (22). In the thirties and forties, Cather criti- cism became politicized: she was attacked by Marxist and defended by right-wing critics. In the fifties and sixties, she was nearly forgotten by the critical establishment, except for those</page><page sequence="3">Simons 525 "complexities of society" and the natural processes of age, disease, and death (35). Jim makes his past such a world by "romanticizing disturbing and unpleasant memories" (46). Other critics reflect the political trends in recent literary debate, specifically those of gender and race. In an influential article originally published in 1971, Blanche Gelfant asserted that Jim's allusions to the Georgics are inappropriately made and are used by Cather to show that he "remembers selectively": while Jim dreamily quotes the Georgics, a poem which "extols pastoral life," Lena Lingard recalls the "drudgery" of farm-life (153). Joan Acocella observes that this article opened the door to the "unreliable narra- tor" approach and provided a solution to the problems Cather's later works posed for feminists. It allowed them to acknowledge the "patriarchal attitudes" in Cather's nov- els while claiming her as a feminist ally.4 Jean Schwind, for example, sees Jim's georgic allusions as "exaggerated Virgilian posturings" which Cather used to undercut Jim's sexist, pastoralized version of Antonia's experience. John J. Murphy likewise argues that the Georgics help Jim "view his past aesthetically" (85)--which is to say, inaccu- rately and solipsistically (84). Mike Fischer, with an astonishing mix of genres and traditions, says that Jim "imagines himself as writing in the tradition of the Georgics, Virgil's pastoral account of the founding of the patria [sic]" (31). But Jim's "'georgic' vision" is false: "There can be no Eden in Nebraska, because its origins are not inno- cent" (37). Cather herself is implicated in the novel's imperialistic pastoralism: if Jim rewrites "the history of women on the Plains," Cather rewrites "the conquest of the Plains Indians" (31). That is, she does not write it at all but represents the Nebraska of her childhood as "empty." John N. Swift has recently argued, in a new but similar vein, that the web of classical allusion in My Antonia is inextricably entangled with the "nativist" national- ism that flourished in the United States at the time of the novel's writing. Jim's align- ment with Virgil reflects a contemporary American classicism that identified the na- tional character with Greece and Rome over against Bohemia, or the home countries of immigrants in general (112-15). Swift argues that Jim's choice of "the ideal over the real, the refined over the sensual, reason over desire, was also a cultural choice for the United States, a nation seeking the means of modem identity" (112). Regarding Jim's use of the Georgics, Swift echoes his predecessors: "Jim's perceptual style imitates Virgil's famous elegiac mode, producing My Antonia's characteristic narrative nostal- gia by severing the mundane present from a strong lost past" (109). Swift maintains that the influence of the classics in Jim's life distorts his view of reality and creates or constitutes a split in Jim's world. Even Mary Ruth Ryder, in her appreciative treatment of Cather's classicism, juxtaposes Jim's retreat into the "pastoral" Georgics with Antonia's who championed her work as an affirmation of traditional American values (31-34). But in the seventies, a new feminist "trend" began which problematized Cather, especially My Antonia, making her worthy of renewed discussion. In Murphy's words, critics of this period discovered "dark undercurrents" in Jim's behaviour and narration, and in Cather's treatment of sexuality (18-20). 4. Acocella lists some of these "patriarchal" features: in My Antonia Cather makes her narrator male, "men silencing women all over again"; "Antonia is not victorious" but lives a "hard life" of "poverty and toil"; at the novel's conclusion, she appears as a housewife "doing the dishes," surrounded by her children. As if this ending were not bad enough, the final section of the novel is named "Cuzak's Boys" for Antonia's husband and sons (Acocella 37- 38). But Acocella points out that the "unreliable narrator" approach is itself problematic since Cather shared a great many "traits" with her idealist, classicist male narrator (42).</page><page sequence="4">526 International Journal of the Classical Tradition / Spring 2001 epic struggle (114-15).5 For critics such as Evelyn I. Funda and Paula Woolley who focus on the storytelling of Antonia and others in the novel, Virgil represents Jim's retreat into a conventional and confining poetic tradition (Funda 212-13; Woolley 150, 173-75). But the role of the Georgics in the novel can and should be read more positively. Ziolkowski's claim that Cather constructs a "Virgilian appeal for the preservation of agrarian values in the face of the encroaching industrialization" (150) is a welcome alternative since it, at least, does not insist on sexism, imperialism, or escapist regres- sion. But in his desire to contextualize the novel historically, Ziolkowski passes lightly over the significance of Jim's own story and the beneficent power of the poem in one reader's experience. When Jim first enters the world of classical literature, he finds there figures from his own life. The Georgics in particular mirrors his childhood experi- ences and reveals their value, magnifies the people and places of rural Nebraska, and, when finally validated in the person of Antonia, provides the vision that unifies Jim's life and reconnects him to the world. Through Jim Cather testifies to the heuristic and even healing power of the poem. Her novel is as much in praise of the Georgics as it is of Antonia or "agrarian values." Such a reading cannot emerge, however, as long as critics equate the Georgics with "pastoral." The assumption that the poem constructs a worry-free "golden age" over- looks the complexity of Virgil's work and seems, in turn, to distort analysis of My Antonia. "Pastoral," as Paul Alpers has recently shown, is itself no naive or simplistic genre. Indeed, he argues, employing the terminology of Kenneth Burke, that it is not a genre at all but a "mode" to be identified by its "central fiction" or "representative anecdote" (ix, et passim). So while he classifies My Antonia as a "pastoral novel" (418), he insists at the same time that the "representative anecdote" of pastoral is precisely not "the Golden Age or idyllic landscapes, but herdsmen and their lives" (x). These herdsmen are employed self-consciously even in Theocritus, but it is with Virgil's "self-conscious handling of Theocritean representations and usages" that a formula emerges: "the poet represents (himself as) a shepherd or shepherds" (138). Ernst A. Schmidt, in his review article on Alpers' book, helpfully revises this to "the Virgilian shepherd represents the poet" (239). He asserts that Virgil's "reduction of the shepherd to the figure of the poet" opened up "bucolic" poetry to a "range of topics" beyond love and singing (239).6 Therefore, when Virgil includes in Eclogue 1 the distressing historical actualities of civil war, confiscations of land, and exile experi- enced by the Italian small farmer at the beginning of Augustus' reign, he is not so much rewriting bucolic poetry as introducing a "new theme" (140). Schmidt remarks, here in support of Alpers, that critics who see the intrusion of the real world as a disruption of the "pastoral myth" do not realize "that the pastoral myth they conjure up-the leisure of the shepherd, reclining in the shade of a tree and 'meditating' songs on his 'oaten flute'-is precisely the impact of the opening scene of Ecl. 1 . . ." (239). 5. Yet Ryder concludes somewhat paradoxically that "through Antonia ... Cather restruc- tures her own world, establishing on the Nebraskan frontier the mythic age in which Mother Earth gave freely of her fruits and human beings were richly rewarded" (161). Ryder argues that "two mythic themes" run throughout Cather's writing: "the struggle of the woman- goddess ... in an increasingly masculine-dominated world, and the translation of male myth into female forms" (18). 6. Unlike Alpers, Schmidt consistently distinguishes between "ancient bucolic poetry," which he insists is a genre, and "modern pastoral," the mode that developed from it (245, 247).</page><page sequence="5">Simons 527 The reclining shepherd emphasizes the loss of the exiled Meliboeus, and through the contrast "Virgil tells us ... that poets live in the real world of social and political issues and that their existence as poets... depends on external factors. Tityrus can, Meliboeus will not be able to sing" (239). Schmidt also argues, however, that the frequent association of pastoral with a Golden Age or Arcadian landscape cannot be dismissed quite so easily as Alpers proposes since Renaissance pastoral poetry did "center round Golden Age, Arcadia, innocence, love, and music" (236). But for the Renaissance, the "Golden Age is not only the distant world of ancient bucolic poetry but the lost ancient world in general, its poetry, its mythology, its erotic freedom." A regret for the ancient world as a Golden Age of art and literature is certainly not alien to Cather. April Twilights, her book of poetry published when she was thirty years old, contains rather obvious titles such as "Arcadian Winter," "Winter at Delphi," "Lament for Marsyas," and "Eurydice." In these, as Ryder suggests, she appears to mourn "Apollo's absence from the earth" (53), the death of song and poetry (52). She regrets the loss of the conditions that foster great art (15), conditions symbolized by the classical myth and poetry she loved.7 My Antonia, on the other hand, can be called "pastoral" only in the broad sense that Alpers establishes by the end of his book: it transforms human experience into art; it demonstrates Cather's awareness of her position outside the community she depicts; and it is concerned with the relation of literature to the world. But, as Schmidt con- tends, Alpers' formulation cannot in the end "separate pastoral from non-pastoral poetry or guide or justify a selection of pastorals" (248). Neither does it address why My Antonia, if pastoral, is so explicitly and deeply informed by the Georgics.8 Alpers himself briefly remarks that "pastoral and georgic are distinct: in the latter, nature's uncertainties and harshness are more prominent, because it is conceived as the habita- tion of farmers" (28). David Ross and David Halperin are more helpful in this regard. Despite their very different interpretations of the Georgics, they agree that among the conventions of pastoral are perpetual summer, noonday, and leisure: the shepherd, relaxing in the shade, passes the time by playing his pipe and singing songs (Ross, "Pastoral" 62, Halperin 83)-the very picture Virgil establishes in his socially-aware Eclogue 1. This pastoral "otium" (leisure) is set over against georgic "labor" (toil), and endless, noontime sunshine against nature's cycles of seasons, of day and night, of birth and death. Whatever work the shepherd may have to do, Jenkyns concurs, it "will begin just after the poem has ended: the poem itself represents his inertia" (177- 78). 7. In her introductory essay on April Twilights, Bernice Slote traces such diverse influences on Cather's poetry as Herrick (xx), Sappho (xxi), Richard Wagner (xxv), Keats, Yeats, and, of course, Housman's A Shropshire Lad (xxvii). She, too, finds in the poems themes of "a golden age, gone with the minstrels who sang it" (xxvi) and "flawed inspiration" (xxvii). 8. Alpers was influenced by the link between Sarah Orne Jewett and Cather: because he calls Jewett's The Country of the Pointed Firs a pastoral novel, and because Cather seems to have benefited from Jewett's advice to "be surer of your backgrounds" and to write about her Nebraska life "from the outside" (qtd. Alpers 399), Alpers quite naturally sees My Antonia as a pastoral novel as well. But his observation that Jewett brought "the rural and coastal regions of New England" to the larger literary world recalls Cleric's teaching on Virgil's use of the word "patria" in the Georgics (Antonia 256-57; Georgics 3.10-11). Cleric, usually thought to be modeled on Cather's professor Bates (see above, p. 524), shares with Jewett a love for a "particular rocky strip of New England coast" (Antonia 257). Cather, that is to say, seems to have connected Jewett's advice and example with Virgil's Georgics.</page><page sequence="6">528 International Journal of the Classical Tradition / Spring 2001 The Georgics is a complex poem; scholars continue to differ over its portrayal of human existence. But whether they believe that Virgil presents human struggle with the natural world as ultimately meaningful (Wilkinson 55, Putnam 80, Jenkyns 678-84) or as cause for pessimism (Thomas, Virgil 92-93; Id., Reading 168-72, 201-02), all agree that hardship and toil are the inescapable conditions of the georgic farmer's life. If the "nominal model" for the Eclogues is Theocritus, for the Georgics it is "dour, practical Hesiod" who places his own generation firmly within the iron age (Jenkyns 323). Donald Sutherland, too, observes in his discussion of Cather's "Classic Voice" that in the Eclogues "you find the bland remark that love conquers all. In the Georgics it is brute labor which conquers all and does not by any means always conquer" (169). Sutherland is, of course, paraphrasing those crucial lines in which Virgil sums up the bitter changes Jove's reign wrought for humans: Labor omnia vicit Improbus et duris urgens in rebus egestas. (Georg. 1.145-46) Toil conquered all things, relentless toil and pressing need in harsh conditions.9 (translation mine) Cather's use of the Georgics likely reflects her move from green, wooded Virginia, where her own father kept sheep (Bennett 17), to the Nebraska prairie. Cather said of the experience, "I would not know how much a child's life is bound up in the woods and hills and meadows around it, if I had not been jerked away from all these and thrown out into a country as bare as a piece of sheet iron" (Kingdom 448). Like Virgil, who chose not "some emblematic, imagined gold" as the central symbol for the farmer's life, but rather the "reality of iron," the farmer's tools (Putnam 6), Cather chose the plough (Antonia 238). Even Jim's much-interpreted encounter with the snake (43-44) not only reflects Cather's childhood experience-her grandmother, like Jim's, carried a cane for killing rattlesnakes (Kingdom 448)-but also emphasizes the post-lapsarian state of the farmer's world: in both Genesis and the Georgics (1.29), enmity between humans and serpents arises only after the curse. For Cather and for Jim "Arcadia" would have been the Virginia of their early childhood.10 Jim is aware of the hardships endured by the Shimerdas (71-74, 135), of Antonia's insufficient clothing in cold weather (36-37, 62), of her work and weariness behind the 9. My thanks to Kari Ronning, assistant editor of the Cather Scholarly Edition of My Antonia, for informing me that there is no available record of the edition(s) or translation(s) of the Georgics used by Cather at home, in high school, or at university (Cather's high school burned down in the 1920's, and the university Bulletin does not tell the editions of works used in language classes). Moreover, Cather habitually quoted and translated from memory, "without bothering to look up the passage" (Woodress, Ronning et al., 467). For these reasons, I have followed the example of the editors of the Cather Scholarly Edition in quoting the Latin of the Oeuvres de Virgile: Bucoliques et Georgiques (ed. E. Benoist). And in the desire to provide roughly contemporary translations, while at the same time making the Virgilian element of the paper amenable to readers of English literature, I have followed the practice of most Cather scholars in quoting from H. Rushton Fairclough's Loeb translation. In the case of a few short or contended passages, however, I have used my own literal translation. 10. Incidentally, perhaps, one of the most conventionally "pastoral" passages in the novel belongs to Antonia: "We have this flower very much at home, in the old country. It always</page><page sequence="7">Simons 529 plough (117-19). The passage from Georgics 3 that strikes Jim as "melancholy" (255) and which provides the novel's epigraph, should not be read as regret for a lost Arcadian golden age. Rather, it states the facts of existence in the real world: Optima quaeque dies miseris mortalibus aevi Prima fugit; subeunt morbi tristisque senectus, Et labor et durae rapit inclementia mortis. (Georg. 3.66-8) The best day of life is always the first to flee for wretched mortals: then advance diseases and sad old age, and distress, and the ruthlessness of stern death seizes all. The hardship, distress, disease, and death observed by Virgil have their counterparts in Jim's narrative. Mr. Shimerda's despair, the illnesses and deaths of Pavel and Cleric, Tiny's worn-out state after her adventures, and Antonia's "battered" appearance at the end of Jim's account (342), all bear witness that the "best day is always the first to flee." Still, the golden quality perceived by so many readers of My Antonia cannot be denied. Virgil's poem too has been found to give a golden account of rural life without excluding its iron age conditions. Jenkyns insists that the "golden age colouring" in the famous laus Italiae (for Jenkyns, Georgics 2.109-76) "is not a flight from reality" (345). Rather, Virgil "recalls the golden age," without claiming that Italy still inhabits it, in order to give the "real world" a "golden lustre," to reveal "how strange and magical is our own land, if we have the wit to see it" (359). Jenkyns' diction here recalls Samuel Taylor Coleridge's seminal statement on one of the purposes of poetry. In the Biographia Literaria, Coleridge says that William Wordsworth's task in Lyrical Ballads was to give the charm of novelty to things of every day, and to excite a feeling analogous to the supernatural, by awakening the mind's attention from the lethargy of custom, and directing it to the loveliness and the wonders of the world before us; an inexhaustible treasure, but for which in consequence of the film of familiarity and selfish solicitude we have eyes, yet see not, ears that hear not, and hearts that neither feel nor understand. (2: 7) Elsewhere, Jenkyns remarks in even stronger Coleridgean tones: "Like Lucretius the Georgics asserts the significance and value of the everyday objects of perception; it shows things as ordinary and special at one and the same time. Lucretius had declared that the usual appearance of the world, if only our vision had not been dulled by familiarity, would strike us with wonder and amazement ." (317). Comparing the Georgics cautiously with Wordsworth's "Lines Written Above Tintern Abbey," Jenkyns grew in our yard and my papa had a green bench and a table under the bushes. In summer, when they were in bloom, he used to sit there with his friend that played the trombone. When I was little I used to go down there to hear them talk--beautiful talk, like what I never hear in this country.' 'What did they talk about?' I asked her 'Oh, I don't know! About music, and the woods, and about God, and when they were young'" (228). Apparently, the move to Nebraska was a descent into the iron age for everyone.</page><page sequence="8">530 International Journal of the Classical Tradition / Spring 2001 urges that Virgil, too, senses "'something interfused'; for him too the appearance of the world is related in some way to the life of humanity; nature has something like a moral character and an expressive force" (351).11 Apparently, even if Jim's vision is georgic rather than pastoral, critics who charge him with "romanticizing" the landscape and human life on the plains may not be wide off the mark after all, especially since Cather, the "editor" of his memoirs, also de- scribes him as "romantic." But we should remember that she uses the term positively to contrast Jim with his chilly and pragmatic wife whom she does not like. To his "romantic disposition" she attributes his "personal passion" for the country as a whole (xi). Jim sees the world differently, but that difference lies in seeing and feeling its value. He finds repeated--or anticipated-in the Georgics the motion he sees in the prairie itself (14-15), the friendliness his grandmother feels toward the badger (17), the personification Antonia gives the chirping insect (37-38), the happiness he himself feels when sitting with the pumpkins under the sun (18). For Virgil, nature is alive to the very point of sentience. He repeatedly uses some form of the term "laetus" (joyful) to describe the natural world. The very first phrase of the poem launches this theme: the poet will tell Quid faciat laetas segetes, what makes the crops joyful (1.1). Jenkyns reminds us that the word's "basic meaning" is "fertile," but he also stresses that "the ambiguity in 'laetus'-both 'fertile' and 'glad'-will be a key to the Georgics" (247). Crops, grass, birds, herds, soils, and the earth herself, are joyful. Virgil's diction is not merely a case of the "pathetic fallacy," when the perceiver, overcome by strong emotion, attributes "to nature a sentience that it does not in reality possess" (Jenkyns 197). It is better described as "the quiet stirring of a personification that is felt as potential, latent beneath the surface signification of a word like the seed hidden in the soil" (331).12 Other forms of personification also continually stress the vitality and worth of the natural world, even when it is pitted against the farmer: saepe exiguus mus Sub terris posuitque domos atque horrea fecit; populatque ingentem farris acervum Curculio, atque inopi metuens formica senectae. (Georg. 1.181-6) 11. Similarly, Susanna Morton Braund attributes Virgil's laus Italiae and his "idealization of rustic life" (Georgics 2.458-542) to his sense of "sympathy" and "harmony" between the natural, human, and divine dimensions (213-14). 12. Jenkyns distinguishes between Virgil's subtle personification and the laughing and singing valleys of the Psalmist in which "the pathetic fallacy is extravagantly on display" (331). But the concept of the "pathetic fallacy" is itself rather unfortunate. Samuel R. Levin proposes that expressions like "the laughing sea" or "the trees are weeping" may arise from a "novel thought" or alternative vision of the world (98, 135). Because our language "was created by humans" it is anthropomorphic and therefore lacks predicates by which to describe "affec- tive" or "mental" states of other beings and objects, should they exist (93-94). If someone sees "nature" not as a "mere other phenomenon that man must learn to understand" but as a "partner in a great spiritual communion," his or her only recourse is to use apparently "deviant" language (205). Such expressions, however, are actually literal, asking the hearer to construe not the language, but his or her conception of the world (93-95). In other words, we should take "'weep' to mean what weeping is for trees" (94). Levin suggests, "we can conceive of such 'objects' but we cannot conceive them"; that is, we can create a space in our minds where the concept would go, were we able to represent it (70).</page><page sequence="9">Simons 531 Often under the ground the tiny mouse sets up a home and builds his storehouses . . . or the weevil ravages a huge heap of grain, and the ant, anxious for a destitute old age. This passage recalls Jim's detailed and sympathetic description of the prairie-dog town and its inhabitants: The dogs were out ... sitting up on their hind legs over the doors of their houses. ... We were examining a big hole with two entrances. The burrow sloped into the ground at a gentle angle, so that we could see where the two corridors united, and the floor was dusty from use, like a little highway over which much travel went. (43) Susanna Morton Braund finds in Virgil's tendency to present "nature in anthro- pomorphic terms ... a pantheistic view of the universe, which has common features with the Stoic view of 'sympathy' of the different parts of the cosmos" (220). She cautions, however, that it is not ultimately useful to try to label Virgil as either Stoic or Epicurean, since he draws on both schools of thought (220). Both are evident in his discussion of bees.13 Because of the bees' human-like behaviour, he says, some people teach Esse apibus partem divinae mentis et haustus Aetherios dixere; deum namque ire per omnia, Terrasque tractusque maris caelumque profundum; Hinc pecudes, armenta, viros, genus omne ferarum, Quemque sibi tenues nascentem arcessere vitas; Scilicet huc reddi deinde ac resoluta referri Omnia, nec morti esse locum, sed viva volare Sideris in numerum, atque alto succedere caelo. (Georg. 4.220-27) that the bees have received a share of the divine intelligence, and a draught of heavenly ether they said; for God pervades all things, earth and sea's expanse and heaven's depth; from him the flocks and herds, men and beasts of every sort draw, each at birth, the slender stream of life; to him all beings thereafter return, and, when unmade, are restored; no place is there for death, but, still quick, they fly unto the ranks of the stars, and mount to the heavens aloft. Although Jim never clearly articulates stoic or pantheistic beliefs, he reveals an affinity with them. He picks up Virgil's word resoluta ("dissolved," Fairclough's "unmade") when he looks back on his childhood experience in his grandmother's garden: 13. Jenkyns points out that Lucretius' attempt to alleviate the dread of death by urging mortals to think of themselves as part of a greater life has much in common not only with Stoicism but even with the pantheism of Spinoza (264).</page><page sequence="10">532 International Journal of the Classical Tradition / Spring 2001 I was something that lay under the sun and felt it, like the pumpkins, and I did not want to be anything more. I was entirely happy. Perhaps we feel like that when we die and become a part of something entire, whether it is sun and air, or goodness and knowledge. At any rate, that is happiness; to be dissolved into something complete and great. When it comes to one, it comes as naturally as sleep. (18) Thurin believes this reflection expresses a death wish that Jim never overcomes. He argues that this wish is at the bottom of Jim's susceptibility to "the old pull of the earth" (Antonia 313) and his attraction to Antonia as the Great Mother who represents "the tomb as well as the womb" (Thurin 214). But a desire to be absorbed into some- thing greater than oneself need not be seen as a longing for death, even if one lacks an articulate philosophical system. Funda observes that Jim's past in Virginia is "unstoried," a "blank" that leaves him unconnected with humanity. One of the things Antonia does for him and for others is to create community through the stories she tells about them (200). But in his dislocated adulthood, far from the community of his youth, lacking friendship in his marriage, and given to endless travel across the country, Jim knows once again the burden of individual existence. Because individual life is linear, it is ephemeral, "infinitesimal"-the word Jim uses of his past (254); the best day is the first to flee. But as Jim implicitly realizes, life itself, into which "all things return to be dissolved," is "great" and "entire," always renewing itself through the cycle of rebirth. This cycle is the pattern of life on the land. Earth's first, best day is repeated every spring and keeps life going. Describing the light and warmth and generative power of spring, Virgil reflects, Non alios prima crescentis origine mundi Illuxisse dies aliumve habuisse tenorem Crediderim; ver illud erat, ver magnus agebat Orbis, et hibernis parcebant flatibus Euri, Cum primae lucem pecudes hausere, virumque Terrea progenies duris caput extulit arvis, Immissaeque ferae silvis et sidera caelo. Nec res hunc tenerae possent perferre laborem, Si non tanta quies iret frigusque caloremque Inter, et exciperet caeli indulgentia terras. (Georg. 2.336-45) Even such days, I could suppose, shone at the first dawn of the infant world; even such was the course they held. Springtime that was; the great world was keeping spring, and the East-winds spared their wintry blasts, when the first cattle drank in the light and man's iron race reared its head from the hard fields, and wild beasts were let loose into the forests and the stars into heaven. Nor could tender things endure this world's stress, did not such long repose come between the seasons' cold and heat, and did not heaven's gracious welcome await the earth. Jim remembers feeling this penetrating, saving joy of spring. He writes, When spring came, after that hard winter, one could not get enough of the</page><page sequence="11">Simons 533 nimble air. Every morning I wakened with a fresh consciousness that win- ter was over.... There was only-spring itself; the throb of it, the light restlessness, the vital essence of it everywhere .... If I had been tossed down blindfold on that red prairie, I should have known that it was spring. (115) Antonia herself shares Virgil's awareness that warmth and light are necessary to the continuance of "tender things." She seems to believe that if only her father could have outlived the winter, he would have found the strength to carry on: "I wish my papa live to see this summer," she sighs to Jim. "I wish no winter ever come again" (134). Yet each season, even winter, has its blessings. Though farmers always have work to do, winter, both in the Georgics and My Antonia, brings them respite from working the land and forces them indoors to enjoy the pleasures of each other's company (e.g. Georgics 1.291-96; Antonia 77-78). Each season has its own tasks as well. Ploughing, planting, and harvesting all have their proper times to which the farmer must adhere if he or she wants success. Therefore, Virgil says at the outset of his poem that he will tell quo sidere, under what star, the farmer's various labours should be performed (1.1). Indeed, Virgil writes, Redit agricolis labor actus in orbem, Atque in se sua per vestigia volvitur annus. (Georg. 2.401-2) the farmer's toil returns, moving in a circle, as the year rolls back upon itself over its own footsteps. Jim makes the same observation when he says, "on the farm the weather was the great fact, and men's affairs went on underneath it, as the streams creep under the ice" (175). For town- or city-dwellers, life goes on substantially unchanged, despite the changing seasons. But farmers, although they suffer the tyranny of the seasons' cycles, are also a part of, if not yet dissolved into, that great circle around which life revolves. The Georgics, then, gives meaning to Jim's childhood world by showing its con- nection with the divine life force and nature's cycles. But the ancient poem performs another function for Jim: it provides a lighted backdrop against which "the places and people of my own infinitesimal past" assume greater stature. As Jim says, "They stood out strengthened and simplified now, like the image of the plough against the sun" (254). Murphy sees here an instance of Jim's tendency to "aestheticize"-that is, distort and reduce-the images of his past (84-85). But "simplified" in this context surely implies clarity rather than simplicity. It will be helpful here to recall Jim's description of the plough: Magnified across the distance by the horizontal light, it stood out against the sun, was exactly contained within the circle of the disk . . . . There it was, heroic in size, a picture writing on the sun. Even while we whispered about it, our vision disappeared; the ball dropped and dropped until the red tip went beneath the earth. The fields below us were dark, the sky was growing pale, and that forgotten plough had sunk back to its own littleness somewhere on the prairie. (237-38)</page><page sequence="12">534 International Journal of the Classical Tradition / Spring 2001 With the correct illumination, an insignificant, forgotten plough assumes heroic importance. Since the Georgics does not contain an obvious parallel description of a plough, Ryder turns to the Aeneid in which the weapons forged by Vulcan appear as a blazing portent in the sky (Aeneid 8.528-36). She infers that Antonia "becomes much like Aeneas for [Jim], bringing into a new world the values of an older culture" (144). There is no question that Cather was stimulated and inspired by the old-world cus- toms that immigrants brought with them (Kingdom 449), but the plough, primarily emblematic of the farmer's life, can be connected to Antonia's immigrant status only- and through it to Aeneas and heroism. The link between the plough and heroism is, I believe, more direct but contrastive. In her passage, Cather juxtaposes farmer and military hero, and asserts the greater dignity and permanence of the former. It is no accident on her part that Jim and the "hired girls" witness this phenomenon just after he has told them about "Coronado and his search for the Seven Golden Cities" and about a neighbour's belief that the adventurer had been in their vicinity. Jim relates that "A farmer in the county north of ours, when he was breaking sod, had turned up a metal stirrup of fine workmanship, and a sword with a Spanish inscription on the blade" (236). A similar event is depicted in the Georgics. Lamenting the civil wars which have filled the last century of Roman history, Virgil prophesies, Scilicet et tempus veniet, cum finibus illis Agricola, incurvo terram molitus aratro, Exesa inveniet scabra robigine pila, Aut gravibus rastris galeas pulsabit inanes, Grandiaque effossis mirabitur ossa sepulcris. (Georg. 1.493-6) Yea, and a time shall come when in those lands, as the farmer toils at the soil with crooked plough, he shall find javelins eaten up with rusty mould, or with his heavy hoes shall strike on empty helms, and marvel at gigantic bones in the upturned graves.14 As Jim remarks, the work of the farmer "underlie[s] all the activities of men, in peace or war" (132). The battles and heroes of historical, linear time come and go, but farm- ers endure forever, as permanent as the cycle of seasons. Both Virgil and the magnified plough reveal the stature of the farmer, a figure greater than those of heroes and adventurers because it is linked to the land itself.15 In the same way that the plough is magnified by the sun, the people and places in Jim's rural past assume heroic proportions against the light of classical literature. Tradition illumines the obscure individual as Jim's lamp illumines the things in his 14. Intriguingly, as Jenkyns notes, Sidgwick in his commentary compares the Panchaia of Virgil's laus Italiae with legendary Eldorado (Georgics 2.139; Jenkyns 357). There is no way to know whether Cather saw Sidgwick's edition, but if she did, or if the same analogy occurred to her independently, her "plough" passage may also be a self-conscious "praise of Nebraska." 15. In a later article, Ryder argues, still with the Aeneid in mind, that Cather substitutes the plough for weapons in a move to elevate the farmer, but she makes the exchange an issue of gender: the warrior is male, the farmer female. For Ryder, the plough symbolizes "female ascendancy," the key concern of the novel ("'Our' Antonia" 115). Paul Olson, on the other hand, sees the novel as a "georgic epic" (278) in which the farmer, not the imperialist leader, is the hero. But a new generic label is unnecessary since the Georgics itself consis-</page><page sequence="13">Simo5ns 535 room. One night while he is studying, Jim compares the evening star to the lamp engraved on his Latin texts. This thought reminds him to light his lamp; when he does so "the dim objects in the room emerged from the shadows" (255). That same evening he reflects on the fact that Virgil had made his "little rural neighborhood" visible by placing it inside the poetic tradition-a fact itself brought home to Jim by his tutor Cleric (256). In turn, Virgil's love for his home makes Cleric's "patria," his "particular rocky strip of New England coast," significant for Jim (257). The poetic tradition provides a background against which small things can be appreciated. It provides a larger context for individuals, making them part of some- thing complete and entire. The "little circle [of] man's experience" (360), to which Jim refers, is, through the heritage of literature, encompassed by the great circle of humanity's experience. To borrow from Paul Ricoeur, because of literature, human beings alone have "a world and not just a situation" (36). Funda's negative reading of Jim's attachment to Virgil is therefore rather surprising. While she stresses the power of story-telling (specifically Antonia's) to give individuals a sense of connection, of their "place in humanity" (202), she sees Jim's reliance on the written word as inferior and conventional. And, like others before her, she equates the Georgics with "pastoral themes" that supply Jim with the "nostalgic notion that 'the best days are the first to flee"' (212).16 But Jim's experience shows that the written word can make the circle of shared experience larger. Little lives are significant because continuously re-enacted. Hence the importance of handing down poetic culture from one generation, one era, to the next, as Cleric does. He has the power to render images sharp and impres- sive, as the sun does the plough, as the poetry of Virgil does the people of Jim's past. Jim says of his tutor, How often I have seen him ... fix his eyes upon some object on the wall or a figure in the carpet, and then flash into the lamplight the very image that tently links and juxtaposes farmer and soldier in the major passages on the plough: Virgil refers to the farmer's implements, including the plough, as arma--quipment, arms, or weapons (1.160)-and emphasizes the force required to build one (1.169-70); in the passage cited above, he has farmer and plough outlast the warriors of his own era; and he laments that the plough is not enough honoured during times of war when, in a reversal of Isaiah, sickles are beaten into swords (1.505-8). Commentators and critics are generally agreed that in doing so Virgil portrays the farmer's work as battle, either to bestow dignity on his labour (e.g. Mynors 33, 97; Jenkyns 319, 632) or to stress its violence (e.g. Thomas, Virgil 95- 7, 150; Ross, Virgil's Elements 203). For Wilkinson the plough symbolizes the moral and religious value of hard work (59, 80). For Putnam it is double-edged, symbolizing humankind's artistry and self-destructive barbarism (36, 71-3, 80). Clearly, war is never far from the Georgics. The extent to which My Antonia is a response to World War I is a subject for another paper. Ziolkowski addresses this theme in relation to the "Modern Georgicists" in Britain--C. Day Lewis and L.A.S. Jermyn, for example (113-19); of Cather, however, he says only that she began to regret the effects of "modernization" after the war, that is, after the writing of My Antonia (153). 16. Paula Woolley is another recent critic who focuses on the storytelling of Antonia along with the "art" of other characters "marginalized" because of their race, gender, or class (150). Theirs is a "vibrant art," but the "art of the masculine dominant culture ... which [Cather] ambivalently desired to join," is found to be "lifeless" and "life-draining" (151). The "tradi- tion of Western high art" is, of course, represented by Virgil and "epitomized by Jim" (150- 51).</page><page sequence="14">536 International Journal of the Classical Tradition / Spring 2001 was in his brain. He could bring the drama of antique life before one out of the shadows-white figures against blue backgrounds. (252-53) Cleric is a link in the human chain connecting the past, memorialized by Virgil, to Jim's present, and he helps to make both meaningful.7 Jim, however, by his own admission, cannot form the next link in that chain. This is because the circle of his own life is broken. Jim is divided between the world of instinctive living and the world of ideas. To this extent, Swift is correct in saying that Jim's present is cut off from his past (109). Though farming is never really an option for him, the rural life has made such an impression that he cannot embrace a world that lacks flesh and blood. Swift asserts that Jim chooses "in favor of abstraction and idealism, against history and material reality; in favor of the austere male world of Gaston Cleric, against the Shimerda household's fecund confusion; in short, . . . in favor of Greece and Rome, against Bohemia" (115). But as "Cather" the narrator of the introduction informs us, Jim does not choose anything at all (in fact, in the introduc- tion of 1918 Cather suggests that his wife chose him [x]). He finds himself in a career and a marriage that participate in neither world. However successful his career, and however much he loves his country, he lives twenty years connected with nothing, with no small neighbourhood or "patria." He merely resides in the big city and passes back and forth across the country by train. He seems to consider this life of so little importance that he tells Antonia nothing about it. He only admits, when she asks, that he has no children (325). If he does tell her anything else, he finds it not worth men- tioning in his memoirs. By contrast, Jim does value his childhood because it came close to that georgic life he learned about as a young man, partaking as it did in nature's life and cycles; and he values his young adulthood because it was engaged with the literary tradition. Antonia is one of the people Jim found waiting for him in that tradition. She lived the life of the georgic farmer and loved nature despite its harshness. Even though Jim's grandmother thought she was doing Antonia a favour by hiring her to work indoors, when Antonia was outdoors alone with Jim she would throw off her bonnet and "sing out joyfully" that she would rather work outside than in the house (133). Antonia prefers the country to the city, having experienced both. On Jim's last visit to her before his twenty-year absence, Antonia tells him, "I'd always be miserable in a city. 17. Given Cather's self-conscious engagement with tradition, it is ironic that, as Ward Briggs points out, her "enormously influential book" did not bring about a noticeable "renewed appreciation of the Georgics in America" ("Virgil" 92). For a discussion of Virgil's own self- conscious positioning within the poetic tradition see Joseph Farrell, who gives a detailed discussion of "The Farmer's Arma" (Georgics 1.160-75) in relation to its literary predecessors (70-77), and Richard Thomas' Reading Virgil and His Texts, especially his treatment of the Corycian farmer. I find Thomas' opposition of the personal and the traditional somewhat problematic, however; he writes, for instance, that "personal experience is private property, while literary tradition is shared and accessible to all poets" (183). But surely it is one of the functions of poetry (and the poet) to connect the two: to render the private accessible and meaningful to others, and to make the traditional personally relevant. Virgil may well have seen the Corycian farmer, or one like him, and seen him more keenly because of his knowl- edge of literary precedents, just as Cather, who must have seen many ploughs, would have seen or remembered them differently after reading the Georgics.</page><page sequence="15">Simons 537 I'd die of lonesomeness. I liked to be where I know every stack and tree, and where all the ground is friendly. I want to live and die here" (312). But Antonia is not just one georgic figure among many. Because they shared so closely the experiences of their early years, Antonia is clearly the most important one to Jim, who realizes that early impressions are the strongest, that the experiences of one's childhood shape what one will become (360). Furthermore, Antonia took on, to a degree, the role of mother to the orphaned boy, guarding him from Lena and the other girls, and constantly encouraging him to pursue his education (209, 217). Given Antonia's vitality and her closeness to Jim, it is not surprising that his memories revolve around her. For this very reason, because Antonia is the key figure of his past, Jim is reluctant to return to her. He wants to keep his past and present separate, just as Murphy (84-5) and Swift (109) suggest, but he does so quite consciously. His georgic vision has allowed him to find value in his early life, and he fears that a return to the world of his youth will destroy that vision and rob his past of its value. He explains to the reader his reluctance to visit his old friend: I did not want to find her aged and broken; I really dreaded it. In the course of twenty crowded years one parts with many illusions. I did not wish to lose the early ones. Some memories are realities, and are better than any- thing that can ever happen to one again. (318) The value of Jim's memories stands or falls with Antonia. If her life has not been worth living, then his childhood is not worth having. All that will be left to him is the melancholy reflection that the best day is the first to flee, that each life is only and always a fleeting shadow. Jim does at last go back. Antonia is older, of course, because she does not live in a golden age free of toil and death, but Jim's georgic vision of life holds. Antonia, as farmer, gardener, and mother, has a share in that life which is continuous and cyclical. Spring is an essential and recurring feature of her existence. She even has an Easter baby named Leo, with hair like fleece-a lion and a lamb in one. Here, in alluding to Isaiah 11: 6-8, Cather may well be invoking Virgil's "Messianic" Eclogue 4 at the same time, suggesting the peace, joy, and abundance prophesied in both those texts. Like the old Corycian of the Georgics, Antonia has cultivated vegetables, flowers, fruit trees, and even grapes on seemingly iron ground (Georg. 4.125-46; Antonia 328-29). She loves her trees "as if they were people" (329). Like Virgil's farmer, she is surrounded by the fruits of her labours, and her children cluster around her, claiming her affection (Georg. 2.516-27; Antonia 326-31). Antonia's garden is as close to a golden age as any on earth could come. Jim now sees Antonia as both image and light. He writes, In my memory there was a succession of such pictures, fixed there like the old woodcuts of one's first primer: Antonia kicking her bare legs against the sides of my pony when we came home in triumph with our snake; Antonia in her black shawl and fur cap, as she stood by her father's grave in the snowstorm; Antonia coming in with her work-team along the evening sky-line. She lent herself to immemorial human attitudes which we recog- nize by instinct as universal and true .... [S]he still had that something</page><page sequence="16">538 International Journal of the Classical Tradition / Spring 2001 which fires the imagination, could still stop one's breath for a moment by a look or gesture that somehow revealed the meaning in common things. (342)18 What Virgil did for the farmer, Jim Burden has done for Antonia. In the end, his classicism is neither "nativist" nor "masculinist," nor merely nostalgic. It enables him to reveal Antonia's heroism, significance, and permanence. She is no longer one ob- scure, infinitesimal life but a figure who always has existed and always will exist. She made a place for herself on the land; now Jim has made a place for her in literature as well. She herself possesses the revelatory power of the Georgics, helping Jim see the "meaning" in ordinary things, shaping and embodying his vision of life on the plains. In renewing his friendship with Antonia, Jim has created a thread of continuity between his youth and adulthood. In writing his memoirs, he has fused the life of the land and the life of the mind. And in passing on the georgic view of life, Jim takes his place in the chain of poetic tradition as well. We do not know where he will go from here, whether he will find or create value in his career or marriage, but we do know that in entering into shared experience once again, Jim has begun to mend the little broken circle of his life.
