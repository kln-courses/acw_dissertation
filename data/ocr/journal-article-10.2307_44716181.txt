Snyder Highway Safety Research Institute, The University of Michigan CURRENT AUTOMOTIVE collision statistics vividly docu- ment both the magnitude of man's exposure to impact stress and the endurance limitations set by his relative fragility. While man has always been confronted with the consequences of Newton's Laws of Motion, the growing population's in- creasing dependency upon the motor vehicle for locomotion has outstripped the ability of the highway to safely transport him, the automobile to protect him, and man's own ability to adapt to an increasingly hostile technological environment. Future engineering design for increased protection and survival of automotive vehicle occupants exposed to crash environ- ments will depend largely upon the biological levels of impact stress which are within human recovery limits. Unfortunately, to date, few of these limits have been even grossly defined. The objective of this paper is to present an overview of the current status of our knowledge, point out known problems, and discuss future needs and directions. Abrupt linear acceleration, deceleration, or crash impact, is usually defined as involving the occurrence of forces of less than 0.2 sec duration (1)*. Impact is also characterized by forces of very rapid onset, short duration, and high magni- tude.** In automobile collisions, such forces have been identi- *Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of pa- per. **In contrast, relatively low forces and long time durations occur in emergency, or "panic" braking on dry pavement un- der ideal conditions, averaging only 0.3 G for 1 .0 sec at 7.5 mph to 0.5 G for 8.2 sec at 90 mph (3). fìed as occurring through three separate physical phenomena. The initial impact of the vehicle with another object, secon- darily subjects the unrestrained automotive occupant to colli- sion with the interior structure of the vehicle in a crash, or to ejection in a "secondary collision" (2) (or when a pedestrian is struck by the exterior of a moving vehicle; a jumper in free- fall strikes the ground), which results in dissipation of such forces through deformation of the environment and body tis- sues. Finally, is the interaction and displacement of the body organs produced by impact of the individual with another ob- ject or his restraint system in "tertiary collision" phenomena (4, 5). The nature, extent, and degree of severity of injury received through the above impact phenomena determine the "toler- ance" of the individual involved. Human tolerances have been variously defined and different researchers have established different end points as criteria. Bierman defined tolerance as "... that value of impact or load which produces a painful re- action" (6). While physiological end points at which experi- ments are terminated are now relatively standard for accelera- tion research on the human centrifuge (7, 8), deceleration experiments are not. Stapp uses criteria resulting in the limit beyond which either the subject or the experimenter voluntar- ily fears to go lest there be serious injury. Injury has been termed "reversible" or "irreversible," dependinggUpon whether the individual can recover or has gone beyond his limits for re- covery. An exposure that exceeds the limits of voluntary tol- erance is defined as resulting in either debilitation or traumatic injury (9). At the other extreme, Taylor has pointed out that ABSTRACT - This paper presents an overview in both regional and whole body impact tolerances. It points out known problems and discusses techniques employed in the investigation of impact trauma, including advantages and disadvantages of using hu- man volunteers, cadavers, or anthropomorphic dummies. It discusses future needs and directions, shows discrepancies that appear when comparing damage sensitivity curves and injury scales, and indicates the need for definitive values. Also pre- sented is a comprehensive review of the literature. 1375</page><page sequence="2">1376 R.G.SNYDER if tolerance is defined as the point at which 50% of the general population refuses to be tested further, then 1 G is the limit, for fewer than 50%. are willing to be subjected to a single test impact (10). Anesthetized animals are used to test beyond these human "voluntary" limits and to determine survival end- points. In animal studies the criteria of LD$q is another toler- ance limit used to statistically determine the limits of a partic- ular test condition. This represents the level at which impact is fatal to 50% of the test subjects (11-15, 96, 130). Determination of human tolerances to impact is complicated by many physical factors influencing the outcome, including restraint support, tightness and configurations; body orienta- tion; and the magnitude, direction, distribution and duration of the force. In addition, biological factors, including sex, age, and physical and mental condition, have been identified as in- fluencing survival. Individual variability must be considered, for tolerance under identical test conditions will vary in the same individual as well as from person to person. Further- more, while considerable data are available concerning impact forces in some body orientations, such as in forward or aft- facing positions, very limited information is known of the ef- fects of lateral impact or of exposure to multiple simultaneous forces or to off-center forces. The latter typically occur in rollovers, in quartering collisions, in multiple successive im- pacts as a vehicle goes off the highway and strikes a number of obstacles with successive abrupt changes in orientation, direc- tion, and velocity, or even in a forward collision in which the occupant is at an extreme seatback or seat pan angle. These brief considerations will be further detailed in subsequent por- tions of this paper. Biophysical terminology employed in the field of impact is generally consistent with terms used in the field of accelera- tion; however, some specialized meanings and distinctions have developed. Most work is identified by descriptive terminology, such as forward, rearward or aft, headward, footward or right or left lateral accelerations. Physiologically, the subject's ori- entation can be described in relation to the force, and since 1961 terms using the X, Y, Z axis (Table 1) have been recom- Table 1 - Impact Terminology -Comparative Table of Equivalents Primary vector acceleration axes are defined relative to the individual's spinal axis, and vector directions refer to the inertial response of the individual.

Air Force investigators often use the vernacular description re- lating "eyeballs" movement in inertial response to the applied acceleration. Since orientations and resultant inertial responses in off-axis impacts may involve complex multiaxial accelera- tions, a three-dimensional description is often used and ex- pressed in terms of degrees of roll, pitch, and yaw, on a polar coordinate system. Thus a 0-20-0 orientation describes an in- dividual seated upright forward facing (~GX) 20 deg back from the perpendicular (Fig. 1). One difference between linear (and rotational) acceleration and abrupt inpact terminology occurs in the transverse (X) axis where back-to-chest and chest-to-back symbols are re- versed, since the deceleration force is in the opposite direction from the acceleration force in this body orientation. Thus, +GX refers to occupant rearward (aft facing) contact with the impact surface, with respect to the motion of the vehicle, while in "acceleration" the subject would be forward facing. Similarly, in impact, -Gx refers to forward facing body orien- tation with respect to the motion of the vehicle, while in "ac- celeration," as on the centrifuge, -Gx would refer to a rear- ward facing position. Unfortunately, usage in the literature is confusing since different authors have applied + and - symbols to mean the same impact orientation, and in other cases indi- vidual researchers have initiated modifications (such as -150 Gx), so it is always advisable to cross-check the description of the test condition with the body axis symbols used. Fig. 1 - Illustration of simple uniaxial acceleration vectors as related to seated automotive occupant, with orientation described in relation to force. A more complex three-dimensional system uses a polar coor- dinate system. A head-on collision would expose subject to a -G im- pact; however, this does not adequately describe fact that his back was inclined 20 deg back from vertical, which is expressed more accurately by a 0-20-0 (roll, pitch, yaw) coordinate description HISTORY The first recorded automotive accident and resulting fatal impact injury reportedly occurred in New York in 1899, when a passenger, alighting from a streetcar, was run into and killed (17). However, the development of occupant protection and scientific interest in impact injury must be historically traced through aviation. Clinical cases of aircraft accidents were first reported during World War I by German doctors (18-21), and, indeed, a chronology of studies of biological effects of impact indicates that with few exceptions German physicians re- ported most of the work until well into World War II (22). Possibly the earliest crash for which a complete medical, en- gineering, and biomechanical study has been reported is that of the 1910 crash of Jorge Chavez while flying the Andes in a Bleirat-XI monoplane (23). Calculated forces at impact on the unrestrained pilot were only 4 G at 15.2-34.5 fps change of velocity (24), and his injuries seemingly should not have been subsequently lethal. If impact protection was only of clinical interest to a few physicians in the infancy of aviation, it certainly was causing reflection among some pilots. In 1908, the crash and resulting fatal skull fracture of Lt. Selfridge, the first Air Force pilot, influenced the second Air Force pilot, Lt. Henry Arnold, to wear the first head protector which was a football helmet (25). However, nearly 40 years passed before the "hard-hat" protec- tion helmet was to be universally adopted by the military. The first restraint system probably also evolved about 1910 (26). Detailed discussion of restraint and constraint systems and development are available (27-29, 248). The first deceleration experiment may have involved an un- willing cat added to a rocket-propelled railway car in June 1928, by Valier in Germany, for physiological study of accel- eration effects. The vehicle crashed and the cat reportedly was successfully accelerated "in several directions" (30). Other than clinical reports and observations, the study of bi- ological effects of impact probably can be dated to the late 1930s with studies of physiological effects of relatively long- term acceleration by von Diringshafen, Gauer, and other Ger- man aviation physicians, and especially by Ruff, a flight sur- geon and flight captain. Ruff felt that for brief accelerations, under 1 sec duration, the time was too short for the physio- logical effect found in centrifugation to occur, and thus that all resulting effects must be attributed only to anatomical or structural tolerances (31).* The first test track facility, de- signed in Germany during WW II specifically for aeromedicai deceleration research, consisted of a light cabin propelled by a falling weight and braked mechanically by alternative decelera- *It has been pointed out by Taylor that although Ruffs as- sumptions in this regard have been subsequently proven erro- neous (since all effects as a result of exposure to deceleration are not structural or anatomical) his influence has been crucial to the development of impact research, since "... this simpli- fying assumption has been the cornerstone of engineering in- terest in biodynamics, and has deterred serious study of bio- dynamic pathophysiology." (10, p. 1).</page><page sequence="4">1378 R.G.SNYDER tion patterns. However, due to air raid damage this facility never actually went into operation. Early military impact investigations during and past WW II were centered around development of restraint protection, ejection tolerances, vertebral injury, and, to some extent, head protection. Studies with human subjects were conducted by Ruff, Geertz, Henschke, Richter, Schrenk and Irrgang between 1942-1945 in Germany (32-36); by Lovelace, Baldes and Wulff, Bierman, et al., Savely, et al., Cofer, et al., Watts, et al., and Ames in the United States between 1945-1947 (37-42); and by Pekarek and Stewart in England (43-45). During 1947- 1948, deceleration experiments using a rocket-driven "man- carrying" trolley, running along a railway track, were con- ducted at Farnborrough (46). Concurrently, the first experimental impact studies utilizing animal subjects were initiated at the USAF School of Aviation Medicine at San Antonio,* with Rushmer's studies of mice, rabbits, and dogs (47-51), and cat studies directed by MacDonald (52). Pioneering still other techniques in 1942, DeHaven (53) analyzed 8 cases of survived free-fall, calculating that man could survive 200 G and pointing out physical fac- tors involved, while Ruff (32) analyzed parachutists' impacts. Since during the early 1940s little was known about crash or impact tolerance, initial work often seemed very crude by to- day's standards. Fig. 2 illustrates early head impact "re- search," in which the human volunteer literally ran into a wall to test protective devices. At several times during WW II the Russians, lacking sufficient parachutes for parachute troops on the German front, dropped troops inside boxes or bales of straw, or with no protection from low-flying aircraft into snow (54). In crash landings Mae West rubber life boats, or other materials, were sometimes used to protect aircrew (28, 55). Although track devices in the United States have been used as decelerators in aviation since 1903, when the Wright broth- *At that time located at Randolph Air Force Base; since 1959, the USAF School of Aerospace Medicine has been lo- cated at Brooks AFB, also in San Antonio. ers launched their first successful heavier-than-air flight, their use in impact studies has made them a major research tool. In 1945 the construction of the K-2 track at China Lake and the 2000-ft track at Edwards AFB were initiated in Calif., and in 1949 a 3550-ft track at Holloman AFB, N. Méx., was begun which was turned over to Northrop Aircraft, initially Fig. 2 - Early head impact "research" using human volunteer to test head protective device during World War II by running into stone wall. Such studies had limited value since no objective measures were used and impacts tended to be at lower range of reversible injury Fig. 3 - View of 6571st Aeromedicai Re- search Labģ Daisy Decelerai or at Hollo- man AFB. Over 5000 impact tests of human volunteers, animals, and dum- mies have been conducted in continuous research on this track since 1955</page><page sequence="5">HUMAN IMPACT TOLERANCE 1 379 for use as a SNORT missile launching facility in 1950. In 1953 the Supersonic Naval Ordinance Research Track (SNORT) was put into operation at China Lake, and in July 1955, the Supersonic Military Air Research Track (SMART) was put into operation at Hurricane Mesa, Utah. In 1956 the 35,000-ft track was built at Holloman and the 3550-ft track was retired. Much of today's knowledge in impact is based upon the work of Stapp, in studies sponsored by the Aeromedicai Lab. on the 2000-ft Edwards Track between 1947-1951, continuing from 1953 until today at Holloman AFB. In March 1954, Stapp made the first human rocket-sled run of 22 G at Holloman, following three runs with chimpanzees and a dummy, making a third and last run on December 10, 1954, 7 years after his first sled run at Edwards. Attaining 0.9 Mach, 937 fps velocity at entry, he decelerated at 600 G/sec onset, 25 G for 1 .0 sec, with peaks of 35 and 40 G (56). In September 1955, the first track designed especially for the study of human tolerance to impact, the Daisy Deceler- ator, became operational (57) (Fig. 3). Work has also been conducted at Wright-Patterson AFB, Dayton, by von Gierke and others, by the FAA at the Civil Aeromedicai Research Lab. at Oklahoma City, by various universities, industries, NASA, and in a combined Army-Navy impact program con- ducted at a new facility at Wayne State University. Fig. 4 shows a typical laboratory impact sled, as used at The Univer- sity of Michigan. Detailed information concerning specifica- tions, impact tracks and devices have been catalogued (30, 57- 59). During the past 16 years, the U. S. automotive industry has conducted or sponsored impact tolerance research related to tests with animals, cadavers, and instrumented anthropomor- phic dummies in barrier, roll-over, side impact, car-to-car col- lision studies, with other laboratory test devices and, more recently, with mathematical modeling. In 1954 Ford Motor Co. first initiated studies at Wayne State University to obtain baseline impact data on head impact of rigid and yielding instrument panels, 51 cadaver tests having been completed by 1955, some 10 years before other similar studies were initiated. Use of cadavers for impact studies of laminated and tempered side glass, windshield development, power windows, steering wheel, and instrument panels con- tinued from 1959-1965 (60-62). Animal tests in 1962 im- pacted hogs into various glass windows; more recently animals were used for the first time to test child restraint systems when anesthetized baboons were used to supplement dummy studies to demonstrate effectiveness of the Tot-guard child re- straint. Further tests with squirrel monkeys, rhesus monkeys, baboons, a chimpanzee, and hogs have been conducted to study "whiplash" and compare embalmed, live-anesthetized impact, steering assembly impact, and cardiovascular physio- logical and biochemical effects of impact. General Motors first designed and used the inverted simulated head form device to test instrument panels in 1954, and beginning in 1962 (63) has conducted a series of horizontal decelerator tests of cadavers in a simulated vehicle seat at Wayne State University, having previously used hogs to simulate human skin in studies (64). Although guidelines for whole body impact tolerances had been established previously through the work of Stapp and others, and had been published in some 256 papers by 1959, as summarized by Eiband (9), it was not until 1962 that it was first proposed that SAE publish a human tolerance pa- per. By March 1964, SAE Information Report J885, "Hu- man Tolerance to Impact Conditions as Related to Motor Ve- hicle Design," was issued and demonstrated the problems of dealing with regional human tolerance "numbers" (65). The knee-hip-thigh complex tolerance was given as 20 G on a 50-lb form (1000 lb), based on work by Kulowski (66) which repre- sented the only data available at that time. Three points of a curve were given for the skull, 100 G for 4 ms, while only one Fig. 4 - Highway Safety Research Institute sled at the University of Michigan is capable of propelling a sled-mounted automotive buck con- taining seated subjects down 60-ft track into decelerator device at far end with a reproducible deceleration pulse. Tests utilizing this impact facility are presently being conducted for the National Highway Safety Bureau</page><page sequence="6">1380 R.G.SNYDER point of 40 G for 30 ms, or 20% lower than for forehead im- pact, was given for the "face." These later data primarily originated from work at Wayne State University (67). During late 1964, the General Services Administration pro- posed a 40 G standard for government vehicles for head-face impacts, based upon work by Swearingen (68) at the Civil Aero- medical Institute of the Federal Aviation Agency. In 1965, the GSA requirement was established at an "effective maxi- mum value" of 80 G, that is, a value which ". . . excluded all portions of the deceleration-time curve of less than 3 millisec- onds." During 1965 a new draft of J885 was proposed, and GM Corp. initiated work at Wayne State University with cadav- ers on the hip-knee-thigh complex. At the Ninth Stapp Car Crash Conference (1965) the results of this work were pre- sented and a 1400-lb tolerance proposed for knee impact (69). In October 1966, J885a was published, increasing knee- thigh-hip complex impact tolerance from 1000 to 1400 lb, and providing levels of impact "producing minor to moderate in- jury" for the face, throat, brain (skull), chest, and side (70). Due to the high deceleration values found tolerable for less than 1 ms, all acceleration spikes of 1 ms or less were ignored in this revision. This was primarily due to findings that heavily reinforced instrument panels struck by a cadaver head pro- duced head deceleration pulses entirely within a 3 ms time duration, yet caused "serious injury," while well-designed pan- els gave considerably less than 80 G. J885a also reduced the effective weight of the head from 20 to 15 lb, and reduced tol- erable chest load from 5400 to 1500 lb. A "severity index limit," which took into account both peak deceleration and the time duration of that peak, was also incorporated, for the first time, developed by Gadd at GM (71). During 1967 and 1968 a biomechanics task force of the SAE Occupant Restraint Systems Subcommitte completed a table of performance levels providing nature of loading and level for various body areas. This has been further developed by the Biomechanics Subcommittee of the SAE Human Factors Com- mittee, organized in 1969, and the latest revision, J885b, is in preparation. In the aerospace field, SAE has issued several aerospace rec- ommended practices relating to impact, including ARP767, is- sued in October 1967 by Committee S-9, entitled "Impact Protective Design of Occupant Environment Transport Air- craft." This provides specific impact data on tolerable magni- tude, time duration and onset rates for various body areas, and with specific source references. The history of research related to man's tolerance to impact forces can be considered from another viewpoint as well, since biomechanical studies of the physical properties of bone, for example, date back at least to the 1880s, with classic work on cadaver material by Messerer (72), and subsequently by others. Early search for simple mechanical properties of the body has evolved into complex and multidisciplinary current research involving both biological and engineering disciplines utilizing the most advanced tools of modern technology. Current re- search, in the area of biological tolerances to impact and its multifaceted consequences, is being conducted not only on de- celerator devices but in specialized study of the physical prop- erties of skin, the central nervous system, brain tissue, various bones, soft tissues, the cardiovascular system, in numerous studies ranging from biochemical to bioengineering ap- proaches. Two major areas of focus may be identified in impact studies. The work related to crash impact protection, survival, and escape, in military aviation and aerospace studies, has been primarily concerned with whole body impact, for example, the organism has been studied as an entire interdependent and in- terrelated system. On the other hand, most of the biomechan- ical studies, and those related to design of automotive crash protection especially, have been concentrating on regional tol- erances. Such studies have been confined to studying the ef- fects of specific environmental inputs on a specific region of the body. Examples are problems of "whiplash" or hyperex- tension/hyperflexion of the cervical area in impact (related to seat design, head protection, restraint), studies of concussion, force deflection characteristics of the thorax, facial impact, impact to the larynx, pancreas, liver, kidneys, or the properties of frontal bone in contact with various sized projections. En- gineering studies of the blood vessels, muscle, ligaments, bone, and measurement of the response characteristics, transmission, and attenuation of forces within the body, are all typical of the combined engineering-medical investigations currently loosely defined as impact research. This paper will attempt to briefly assess current knowledge and problems in both regional and whole body aspects. Be- cause of the variability and complexity of the human body it is necessary to reduce the component parts to specific scrutiny to understand the whole; however, it is also crucial to always keep in mind that the body operates as a whole and as an en- tity may function or react entirely differently than found in isolated testing of component parts. This becomes of particu- lar importance in assessing tolerance of human head and brain, where tests of structural failure of cadaver material cannot take into consideration concomitant biochemical or physio- logical tolerance thresholds and effects upon other organs or systems of the body. Both approaches are necessary. METHODS Several methods of measuring, calculating, or estimating hu- man tolerance limitations have been devised. Each is contrib- uting to our overall knowledge, although each presents prob- lems and imperfections. Prior to consideration of tolerance findings to date, it would seem appropriate to first examine and discuss the ways in which these data are being obtained in order to better understand their limitations and validity of ap- plication. Fig. 5 illustrates the general methods of conducting studies of impact tolerance. HUMAN VOLUNTEERS - The best model for man is man. Unfortunately, studies with human volunteers can only be conducted ethically within rather limited ranges. Most labor- atory studies with human volunteers are initiated with low lev- els of force, gradually increased only up to the point of volun- tary tolerance limited by pain or discomfort, and under the control of the subject and the medical monitor. In the past,</page><page sequence="7">HUMAN IMPACT TOLERANCE 1 38 1 experiments have accidentally proceeded beyond the intended voluntary end-points (74, 75, 80, 389) and resulted in irrevers- ible injury. Because impact studies with humans can be dan- gerous, most investigators use themselves as subjects in probing higher levels of force involving greater risk. Some major data have resulted from such tests (73-76). Except for a few isolated tests where university researchers (77-79), industrial contractors (80), or civilian federal re- searchers (75) have used themselves (or students) as subjects, almost all available data from human impact tests have re- sulted from studies utilizing military volunteer subjects. These subjects may be characterized as young, male, in good health, and as such represent a rather small segment of the total popu- lation, and may be at considerable variance with the tolerance of females, children, the elderly, the infirm, the obese, or even the middle-aged U. S. male. Furthermore, such tests are con- ducted under optimal conditions, with a strenuous physical ex- amination prior to tests and continuous pre- and post-medical monitoring (82, 83). Restraint is optimal, tightened beyond that characteristic of most automotive occupants, and with a secondary back-up system. Volunteers wear mouthpieces or other protection, and, for the higher impact levels which have been reported to date, restraint usually consists of that typical only of Apollo space vehicles or supersonic military aircraft. Measurement data from hutnan sled subjects should also be used with caution. In a single impact test, the accelerometer readings from the sled, head, and chest, mounts may vary con- siderably. Because external chest accelerometers are not at- tached to the body in a manner to entirely prevent movement between the accelerometer and the body, the resulting "slap" may result in distorted measures, usually on the high side. For example, in Daisy Decelerator test no. 2527 the accelerometer Fig. 5 - Methods of determining human impact tolerance G readings on the sled, chest, and head, were, respectively, 8.90, 13.90, 8.33, while in test no. 2529 they were 9.32, 30.38, and 22.16 (142, p. 54). Such divergent chest and head readings from similar sled decelerations are typical, and make precise comparisons of test results both within a series and be- tween different series difficult. Similar problems caused Stapp to discontinue head measurement after a few runs in his 1951 tests "... because of angular motion of the head and in- stability of the helmet on the head" (56). Recent development and experimental use of transducers mounted on individual bite plates and bioaxial accelerometers, and a rate gyroscope over the back of the head with rigid con- nections between locks, have been reported by Ewing, et al., "... to measure precisely the dynamic response of output of the head (and neck) to input acceleration" (83). In appraising data from human tests we must keep in mind these differences. Tolerance developed under these conditions may not be representative of the general population- or even of the subjects tested when impacted under different environ- mental conditions, such as are found in the automotive vehi- cle. To date, we really know very little about impact toler- ances of the major part of the U. S. general population. CLINICAL REPORT OF ACCIDENTS - The most complete descriptions of injuries resulting from impact in automotive collisions, or in other impact environments, may be found in the clinical literature (66). From these, especially where sur- gery or postmortem examination is involved, we may identify the body organs or systems most vulnerable to impact, and learn comparative structural limitations. In cases where detailed study of an automotive accident oc- curred, knowledge of the environmental conditions contributes immensely to the injury report. However, in few cases does the physician have available any information concerning the vehicle or conditions of impact. Thus the clinical report rep- resents only one piece of a puzzle. At present the missing por- tion can only be estimated, for no measurements are available for physical parameters of the crash itself- the specific condi- tions of the impact. In the future, the possibility of placing inexpensive transducer devices in new vehicles would provide some recording, similar to that now provided crash investiga- tors in the air carrier in-flight recorder. While the clinician is limited in assessment of the total envir- onment relative to an accident, still another technique, the in- vestigation of accidents, is providing field environmental data, which is important in establishing more closely how accident trauma occurs and how improved design may reduce injuries (85-89). Accident investigators have been able to establish critical areas of impaction within the vehicle environment and relationship to the occupant. Evidence as to how successful current design is in bringing impact protection closer to the limits defined as tolerable can only be established through careful field research at the scene of the accident. CADAVERS - Human cadavers have been experimentally employed in very few whole body impact tests, although a large number of studies of regional tolerances and mechanics of fracture, that is legs (90-95), chest (97, 98), head (99-107), concussion (109-1 16), and intracranial pressure gradients (117,</page><page sequence="8">1382 R.G.SNYDER 118), have been conducted. A cadaver, or human body after death, has many limitations which must be considered along with obvious advantages. Morphologically, the cadaver is an identical model to the in vivo subject. However, since it no longer is a functioning biological system, injury to soft tissues and body organs can usually only be inferred. Muscle tonus no longer exists because of rigor mortis and muscles stiffen. This necessitates manual manipulation to loosen the joints suf- ficiently to position the cadaver, and, since this must be sub- jectively done, the resulting degree of joint motion may vary analogous to the wide range of dummy joint motion obtained by variable tightening of the joint set screws. An alternative is to use fresh cadavers, immediately post-death, which is rarely legally possible in the United States. Other problems include availability and selection, with other than aged or atypical (obese, infirm, or disease or trauma causing death negating use- fulness) cadavers at a premium. Medical schools, which often do not have enough cadavers available for medical student training in anatomy, generally place high priority on earmark- ing the "best" cadavers for instructional, rather than research, use. Too, the embalmed cadaver, depending upon its time and method of storage and method of preparation, may have con- siderably changed body fluids and tissue properties over the living or in vivo state. Controversy presently exists over the degree of change of tis- sue properties, both between in vivo and dead embalmed, and between dead embalmed and unembalmed tissues. Until rela- tively recently comparative tests have been generally inter- preted to indicate that no significant structural differences ex- ist. An early study of human compact embalmed bone showed a compressive strength of 25,000 psi, but also that embalming for six weeks increased the strength of rat femurs from 6 to 116% (120). Subsequent studies, comparing 7 pairs of speci- mens from fresh unembalmed and embalmed tibias, showed that embalming (after 7 weeks) reduced the compressive strength of the bone about 13% (121). These investigators felt this variation was no greater than that found between in- dividuals, an argument often used to conclude that such varia- tions found are not significant (99, 111, 122). In a study of the effect of embalming upon the mechanical properties of beef bone, McElhaney, et al., in close agreement with Calabrisi and Smith, found that ". . . embalming causes a significant reduction (12%) in the ultimate compressive strength of beef bone, but only very slight reductions in ulti- mate tensile strength, maximum strain, maximum hardness, and modulus of elasticity." The change in hardness was found to be insignificant (123). These findings are generally in agree- ment with work by Sedlin and Hirsch (124). Gurdjian (1 1 1) has found that it requires about 10 times the energy to frac- ture an intact cadaver skull than is necessary to fracture a dry skull. Earlier work had shown that most fractures, including depressed skull fractures, result from tension, or tearing apart, rather than from compression (99). This has been more re- cently noted by Huelke (125) in studies of the human jaw. Comparative studies to determine if differences in the me- chanical properties of hard tissues exist between live animals versus dead embalmed animals have resulted in findings of no significant differences by several investigators (106, 122, 126, 127). Roberts and Lissner (122) conducted tests with 30 anes- thetized live dogs subjected to a constant acceleration level of 8 G with jerk values ranging from 250-3000 G/sec. The tests were repeated with the same animals, which were sacrificed, embalmed, and tested again within 72 hr (with four excep- tions). Strain gages were mounted on the lumbar or thoracic vertebrae and accelerometers mounted on the thoracic verte- brae. In all instances the dynamic load factor for the live ani- mal as a function of jerk was higher than for the enbalmed ani- mal, and the flat portion of the curve (dynamic load factor plotted against jerk) was reached sooner (600-750 G/sec) com- pared to the embalmed animals (750-1250 G/sec). They con- cluded that the living tissues and bone have a lower spring rate than embalmed tissue and bone, the stiffer embalmed tissue characteristically requiring a high rate of onset to achieve the maximum plateau. They also observed that the live animal had a natural frequency approximately half that of the dead embalmed animal, differing from Stech and Payne's (1 28) find- ing that the computed natural frequency of an isolated fresh un- embalmed vertebra corresponded well to that of a human volun- teer. These investigators concluded that since the difference of the dynamic load factor found in their tests was within 20% ("except for the transition region between a dynamic load fac- tor of one and the terminal maximum plateau") the overall cadaver versus in vivo response at constant acceleration and varying levels of jerk is good (122). Hodgson, et al., attempted to determine the correlation between living and embalmed bone in an experiment with one male stumptail monkey, impacting the zygomatic arch in the living and the embalmed state. They concluded that "the test was not entirely successful" (106). Finding similar strain gage measurements of skull deforma- tion in anesthetized and dead unembalmed dogs, Gurdjian and Webster concluded that "... the findings in the autopsy speci- mens represent conditions present in the living" (99). In the only known test in which a cadaver was run on the Holloman Daisy Decelerator, a lap-belted, pregnant baboon, was tested twice under identical conditions in a 33 G forward facing (-Gx) (20 deg seat pan angle), once, anesthetized-live, and a second time, within two hours, dead-unembalmed. In- trauterine pressure did not vary from that of the living condi- tion but high speed photographic comparison of body mo- tions was not reported, although recorded (129, 335). Recently Greenberg, et al., have found less than 5% change from live to dead unembalmed condition in dog skulls, while embalming was reported to stiffen about 8%, and drying of embalmed bone further increases stiffness as high as 32%, aver- aging 24.5% (131). However, these authors indicate that em- balmed bone gives as reasonable results as if the bone were un- embalmed, with no greater variation than would be normally found between individuals. In contrast, in recent tests of human cadaver embalmed spec- imens, Cooke and Nagel found that contrary to previous re- ports "... severe trauma was produced by low energy impact, indicating that embalmed specimens would not be useful for</page><page sequence="9">HUMAN IMPACT TOLERANCE 1 383 further study," and continued their tests with unembalmed specimens (95, p. 119). All of these studies have been concerned with bone tissue. To determine if there was a quantifiable difference in the re- sponse of both soft and hard tissue to identical impact in live, anesthetized and dead, embalmed tissues, Life, et al., con- ducted a series of phased experiments with primates (14, 132, 133). Due to the scalar or size-related difference they pro- posed to conduct tests with small, medium-sized, and large primates, continuing with embalmed cadavers and sublethal human tests. In the first series, 36 live anesthetized male squirrel monkeys were sacrificed and embalmed using the same embalming technique and waiting periods used at Wayne State University. At the end of the 30-day period (required by law in Michigan) these animals were impacted as the first group. Statistically significant differences were reported for both hard and soft tissues in the five directly comparable in- juries of the chest and abdomen (p &lt; 0.025 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively), with no difference found between the extent of cortical or meningeal lacerations in head soft tissue. The dead, embalmed monkeys demonstrated comminuted basal fractures with extensive fragmentation, significantly differ- ent from the live, anesthetized predominance of linear frac- tures. Interestingly, in a small additional five-animal sample they found that the degree of embalming appeared to have a distinct effect upon the hard tissue. This study has not yet been published (132). Proceeding in a second study to larger primates, 35 male rhesus monkeys, divided into two groups, live, anesthetized and dead, embalmed, were also impacted as in the first series; however, extensive biochemical analysis was also included in these tests. These authors report that results "... have shown that a marked difference between live and embalmed tissue exists in at least two species . . . and that this difference is re- markably similar . . . further . . . there is no difference in tis- sue response if energy /size relationships are controlled" (133). Nahum, et al. (98), in comparative tests of force-deflection response of both embalmed and unembalmed human cadavers, found deflection tolerance "in agreement" with earlier stud- ies by Patrick, et al. (69, 97); they observed, however, that both force tolerance and stiffness differences were less. Current work by Beckman, Palmer and Roberts (134) has compared force-deflection response of anesthetized-live and embalmed rhesus monkeys to controlled thoracic impact (12 animals/ 100 tests) with quite different results than reported by Nahum, et al. (98). Results indicate ". . . clear significant differences between anesthetized primates and those tested 30 days after being embalmed the mechanical characteristics of the primate thorax are dramatically affected by death and/or subsequent embalming procedures" (134). Forces recorded under the same test conditions were 132% higher for the em- balmed primates statically tested, and 25-50% higher under dynamic tests. Findings reported in these new studies (14, 95, 132-134) in- dicate that until further studies can be done a great deal of caution should be exercised in considering results of embalmed cadaver tests comparable to responses of the anesthesized liv- ing subject. A point which is often overlooked in use of data presented in the literature is that the summary conclusions of a paper (and the author is certainly best qualified to make them for his own work) usually involve subjective interpretation, which another investigator, assessing the same data, might interpret differently. For example, in the above studies a 12% differ- ence is considered in one study to be "a significant reduction." In another, showing close agreement in results, 13% is consid- ered to be within normal variation (121), while "within a 20%" difference is considered in another to be "good re- sponse" (122), and in still another a stiffness increase "as high as 32%" contributes to a conclusion that overall "minimal change takes place" (131). We often have neither guidelines for comparisons, not only because of different techniques used in measurement and in embalming and preparation, age factors (pre- and postmortem) and "quality" of the cadaver, nor stan- dardized techniques for conducting the experiments, and as re- flected upon by Nahum, et al. (98), we do not fully under- stand at this point the reasons for differences reported. It seems apparent that comparative studies to date have shown that while cadavers provide a good model of the living, as far as shape and size are concerned, the tissue response to both static and dynamic loading has been demonstrated to vary considerably between in vivo and cadaver states, leading investigators such as Beckman, Palmer and Roberts to conclude "... direct projections from cadaver to living man impossible" (134, p. 1). The techniques used, and extent of the study to determine injury post-impact, can affect results as well. Nahum, et al. (98), and Kulowski (66), have demonstrated that radiographic techniques do not always identify fractures of the rib, subse- quently shown to exist upon dissection. Thus, in experiments in which dissection is not done, or is incomplete, erroneous in- jury findings may result. This is also the case for vertebral fracture where endplate fracture of the vertebral body may not be discerned by x-ray. In cases where multiple impacts to a subject occur, it may not be possible to determine whether resulting injury occurred in the first, or last, or during inter- mediate, impacts. EXPERIMENTAL ANIMALS - Another approach which has been used extensively (since Valier's cat of 1928) is to study biological response in a living organism through animal investigations. Animals provide a functional model which may closely simulate man, and tests with anesthetized animals can be conducted at lethal levels, far above those for which human volunteers may be ethically exposed. Examination of the ex- perimental studies listed in the Appendix demonstrates the large number of animal investigations conducted to date, and indicates that much of our knowledge of impact tolerance has been derived through such work. But the use of animals also presents many problems. The major problem involves extrapolation of data found for animal tests to the human. Validation of such results is often difficult. There are many structural differences between lower animals and man which investigators do not always point out.</page><page sequence="10">1384 R.G.SNYDER Test results can be affected by such differences as differing numbers of vertebra and different forms resulting in lack of lumbar or thoracic curvature; position of the foramen mag- num, and center of gravity, may profoundly affect head im- pact studies; additional musculature not found in the human also occurs. Also, physiological variances in the cardiovascu- lar, neurological, or endocrine systems can play a critical role. Such differences must be considered in interpretation of the results. A quadruped (cat, dog, bear, hog) which cannot nor- mally walk in an upright position has many structural differ- ences which make it more tolerable than man to forces in certain body orientations and conditions, and may make it a less tolerable subject in others. The closest primate to man, functionally and structurally, is the chimpanzee. But even the chimp has differences related to strength and body proportions which make direct extrapola- tion difficult, and because of their value and extremely lim- ited availability, chimps have been used in only 110 individual impact tests reported to date. Some animals may be valid for some tests but of limited value for others. The young hog, for example, has been used for skin experiments, and closely sim- ulates the human abdominal structures; however, for head im- pact it bears little resemblance to man. Researchers should carefully consider the respective anatomical and physiological divergences of any research animals from man and how such differences may influence results. Since animals represent the best experimental biological model of the human, the development of scaling, or size rela- tionship, laws have been of major concern. Ommaya, et al., have reported the essential features of a scaling law for cere- bral concussion of primates (135), while studies by Life and Pince (14, 132, 133) and Beckman and Palmer (136), are searching for head, chest and abdominal impact correlations, with work by Roberts, et al., currently investigating scaling re- lationships in lateral impact (137). The researcher subjecting animals to experimental impact exposures can seldom test all variables, and especially where physiologic measures involving implantation through prior sur- gical procedures are conducted, the artifactual influence may be difficult to determine. However, outside of the limited use of human volunteers, the only other source for study of func- tional effects of impact remains the animal subject. ANTHROPOMORPHIC DUMMIES - Where human simula- tion is required in tests which are considered too dangerous for the exposure of human volunteers, or where the number of tests negate consideration of other means, the anthropomor- phic dummy is most commonly used. The dummy is an excel- lent engineering tool which may be used in repetitive tests or in preliminary tests which might be hazardous for humans. A history of the development and specifications of United States anthropomorphic dummies has been discussed by Hertzberg (138), and other detailed discussions are available (139-144). SAE Recommended Practice J963 describes a standard anthro- pomorphic test device for use in both actual and simulated ve- hicle crash impact tests, but is careful to point out that "... the structural characteristics of this device simulate the basic human body components only in size, shape, mass, and kine- matics. The device has no capacity to simulate human physi- ological function or to measure simulated physiological re- sponses" (145). Critical evaluations of dummy test perform- ance and reproducibility have been published by Chandler and Christian (146) and Searle and Haslegrave (147). No dummy currently in use actually conforms completely to the specifications of J963. However, both an updated recom- mended practice (J963a) and an improved dummy through joint user-manufacturer effort are in sight. Dummies undoubtedly represent the most common human simulation device utilized in impact tests; however, it probably is also the most misused and least understood tool. Dummies often have a strange way of becoming more and more human- like to the engineer working closely with them and often their limitations are not considered sufficiently. It is sheer specula- tion to attribute trauma to a dummy impacted in a crash, as has been attempted. Instrumentation placed within the dummy and on its restraints can provide a good means of mea- suring comparative forces and restraint loads; however, such measures can not yet quantify damage to soft tissues and body organs, or injurious effects and stress reactions to the cardio- vascular, endocrine, or neurological systems. Different meth- ods of incorporating instrumentation usually give different re- sults within the same dummy and these variations have never been successfully compared to human tolerances. In order to design better dummies it is necessary to decide what a dummy is supposed to do. We need more anthropo- metric information relative to the characteristics of the "gen- eral" United States population. Almost all dummies currently in use are designed from specifications and static physical di- mensions derived from young, male, physically selected mili- tary populations, and are representative of only a very small segment of the entire population. Development of child dum- mies is progressing, but adequate basic design information is still very incomplete, and how they must act to simulate the human in impact conditions is very hazy. The state-of-the-art is summed up by McConville and Churchill (148). Specifications currently available for the design of dummies are inadequate. Both the range of joint motion and centers of gravity of today's dummies have been derived from limited ba- sic data. Many of these have been derived from study of el- derly male cadavers, and although better data are now gradu- ally being developed (149, 150), the fact is that only extremely limited basic morphological data are available. While some data for the kinematic characteristics of the extremities are known, no study of the link systems of the torso has ever been reported. A careful examination of the basic data available upon which a dummy representative of the human body can be designed clearly indicates that such simulations must re- main crude guesses in respect to many very basic factors until support for, and interest in, solving some of these problems occurs. Because of dysplasia, or the fact that each of our body seg- ments is not proportionately the same, there is no such thing as a 50th percentile man, or dummy. Rather, accepted prac- tice is to arbitrarily select the dimensions of height and weight as primary criteria for a 50th, 95th, or any other "size"</page><page sequence="11">HUMAN IMPACT TOLERANCE 1 385 dummy. Yet few humans who are 50th percentile in stature are also 50th percentile in sitting height or other measure- ments. This has been vividly demonstrated by Daniels' study, in which, of an Air Force population of 4063 men, no one was still "average" after ten measurements were conducted (151). While no better method has been advanced, the point is that too often recognition of the fact that dimensions other than height and weight are not of the same percentile relationship is not evidenced. Even the present dummy's main attribute, that it serves as a reproducible test device, has been challenged. In comparative tests of current dummies Chandler and Christian have found that "... even when dummies are subjected to carefully con- trolled impacts with skilled technical personnel following iden- tical procedures, it is difficult to reproduce test results" (146). Some of the potential reasons for this may include lack of standard test procedures, lack of standardized instrumentation procedures, different torque of joint motion, and even differ- ences between supposedly identical models of the same dummy. Schwartz, in a comparative series of decelerations with an- thropometric dummies and humans similarly restrained in identical seats, analyzed body displacements at various prese- lected points by high-speed motion picture techniques. Both the thigh point and knee point of the 95 th percentile dummy and human had reached their peak displacement at 40 ms; however, the peak displacement of the 95th percentile human shoulder point was reached at 80 ms, while the dummy had a 60 ms response time, indicating that the dummy responds to the input pulse faster than the human, due to the more rigid dummy body. It was concluded that the motion of the dummy /human head and shoulder points would be difficult to duplicate exactly, even in identical tests, because of the posi- tion the subject sits in the seat, how he hunches his shoulders, his head position, and the extent of the subject's muscular control (108). Too few dummy users have the ability to compare basic di- mensional specifications for quality control, or how they per- form during tests. In one instance, where a user of a large number of dummies made detailed anthropometric measure- ments for inventory purposes, it was found that body weight varied by 12 lb and total height by 2.6 in. for supposedly iden- tical models of the same 50th percentile dummy (152). Obvi- ously test results are going to differ in such cases. Despite these rather serious limitations, the anthropometric dummy has served a useful role as a simulation device in im- pact studies. What is greatly needed are basic data related to the human neck, pelvic, and shoulder girdles, and torso, and until such information is developed new generations of dum- mies will continue to exhibit similar deficiencies despite their new sophistication. ACCIDENTAL FREE FALLS - In the United States re- ported free falls occur at a rate approaching 50/day due to ac- cident, suicide, or homicide, and present an unusual opportu- nity to study impact in humans at levels far above those imposed in the laboratory. Through careful selection, investi- gation, and analysis of factors, in cases chosen for intensive study, reliable estimates for the entire range of human toler- ances may be established for the general population as suffi- cient occurrences under each set of conditions are carefully in- vestigated. The first attempt to scientifically study such cases is gener- ally attributed to DeHaven of Cornell University Medical School who, in 1942, reported on 8 cases of falls in the trans- verse plane. He concluded that the primary causes of injury, which he attributed to impact and localization of force, ". . . are defeated when distributed in distance (time) and area (space), and that the brevity of the force interval and compen- sation of pressure can yield amazing results . . . ." (53). A ninth case was reported in 1948, but not widely circulated (153). This method was ignored until 1962 when Snyder pub- lished a case history providing extensive biophysical and medi- cal documentation for a 275-ft fall (154), which provided a basis for extending the extreme limit of +GZ impact survival. This was followed by publication of a study of some 12,000 free falls investigated since 1959 (155). This study demon- strated that humans have survived impact forces considerably greater than those previously believed tolerable, and identi- fied further factors influencing survival. Contrary to DeHaven's initial work, these data showed that distribution of force is not always as critical as the interaction of other envir- onmental conditions, since feet-first impact (small area of con- tact) into water, for example, allows deceleration over a greater distance and is more survivable (for the same entrance velocity) than prone or supine impact which distributes the load over a greater body area, but with less deformation dis- tance and more abrupt onset rate. Data on some 30,000 free falls were obtained in a series of free-fall studies. Detailed dis- cussions of tolerance factors have been reported and include impacts into a variety of materials, ranging to terminal veloc- ities from as high as 24,000 ft (54, 153-158). Further analy- ses of tolerance of children and infants were reported (155, 160). Data on 3153 infants and children to age 12 were collected, but only 34 cases were felt to have sufficiently complete phys- ical measurements and biomedical analysis. Initial body ori- entation at impact was found to be a major factor in child im- pact survival, particularly in relation to head injury. Feet-first (+GZ) impacts to 40 fps on concrete surfaces were survived without injury, to 51 fps on soil, and to 1 10 fps on water. Yet head-first (~GZ) impacts exceeding 30 fps onto unyielding sur- faces (hard soil, concrete) produced serious injury. Injuries in lateral, prone, and supine body orientations occurred at low velocities, with the most frequent injury being to the brain. Table 2 lists five cases of extreme lateral and transverse impact orientation to which an unrestrained child occupant might be exposed. Estimates of G forces, ranging in these cases from 35.8-159 G, time duration of impact 0.02-0.006 sec, unit pressure of 32.6-63.6 psi, at vélocités of 24-51 fps (AV cor- rected for air resistance effects of body size), were survived. These estimates should be considered as upper survival toler- ance limits for children impacting under similar conditions until such time as better data may be available for infant and child impact tolerance.</page><page sequence="12">1386 R.G.SNYDER While free falls offer a means of assessing the total range of injury through fatality for the total population under a con- siderable variety of conditions, there are severe problems in obtaining data, analyzing and applying them. The main limita- tion of such studies revolves about the lack of valid measure- ment at the instant of impact. All forces have to be calculated, since there is rarely photographic coverage*, and no means of direct measurement. In some circumstances, for example, im- pact into yielding structures such as vehicle roof-tops or soil, deformation measurements are possible to obtain. However, considerable care has to be taken in determining exact body orientation at impact. It has been found that this often is off- axis. Often body orientation (and force direction) cannot be determined since witnesses to the fall may be mistaken, and the subject himself rarely can describe his actions accurately. Some help here is provided by analysis of the injuries. It has also been found that subjects often bounce, and may impact in various orientations in secondary or tertiary impacts. This complicates assessment of the injuries, and is information which cannot always be assumed. Probably the major limita- tion of the "free-fall" method, at present, is that the degree of deformation of the tissue cannot be known, but must be es- timated (all that is certain is that it can never exceed the par- ticular body segment breadth). In one initial study (154) cal- culated forces of 2064 G for 0.0023-sec duration reported are 10 times previous estimates for the extreme limits of survival, and while impact was distributed through the buttocks, esti- mated at 1-in. deformation, new evidence on tissue deforma- tion (134) indicates that even greater deformation (and less force) may be estimated. This is why subsequent studies (155- 159) provide impact velocity only, and do not attempt to es- timate magnitude of the force. Until some further method of determining tissue deformation characteristics is known more accurately, few free-fall cases can validly present more than the calculated velocity at impact, which can be very accurately determined. MATHEMATICAL MODELS - In recent years development of physical or mathematical models to explain and predict the biological response to acceleration has evolved and received in- *Motion pictures and still photography of suicidal and acci- dental free-fall impacts have been obtained by the author in several cases. creasing attention. Modeling objectives appear to be twofold: to derive quantitative empirical standards based on human tests to which the most common impact environments can be compared, and to develop predictive ability from these models for environments in which human tests have not been con- ducted (161). McHenry notes that prediction is "... an es- sential part of scientific knowledge of any subject and it gen- erally cannot be acquired from experiments alone," and fur- ther defines the primary objective of mathematical modeling as ". . . to achieve an understanding of relationships that gov- ern the behavior of physical objects, or systems, and an ability to predict how they will behave under given circumstances" (162). One major advantage of the model is that, once de- veloped, considerable savings in time and effort can be made. This reduces the number of experimental tests required and can provide estimates, given specific environmental condi- tions, which can lay other groundwork for more sophisticated analytical and experimental work. However, a mathematical model may require some two years of time and a considerable number of man-hours and computer use to develop. Further- more, a mathematical model will not have any more informa- tion than the data from which it is generated. While the model may make the data more understandable, it will not generate information. Major modeling emphasis has been con- cerned with the interaction between an automotive occupant and the interior of a vehicle, restraint systems, and human re- sponse to simulated impact and vibration environments. Tissues of the human body show mechanical properties such as compressibility, elasticity, shear and tensile strength. In general, biological materials are multiphase, nonhomogeneous, anisotropic. Body fluids are generally non-Newtonian and sol- ids are non-Hookean. Despite considerable work related to the mechanical properties of tissues, stress-strain-history law is not known for any tissue (163). Live whole body response is non- linear and exhibits a high degree of rate sensitivity (164). Stress analysis of the human is complicated by other factors as well, including the simultaneous responses of different states and kinds of materials in body structures (such as the pneu- matic and hydraulic behavior of gases and fluids, plastic defor- mation of soft tissues, the stretching of mesenteries and liga- ments by the inertia of organ masses) and should relate measurements to points of structural weakness or of load con- centration (165).

Eventually there may be sufficient data about impe- dance of segments, body masses, coupling, damping, kinetics, and other features of the models so that they may be effective in making predictions about the effects of the random multi- vectored, and often sequential, forces that operate under ac- tual impact environments. The physical properties of bone are best known. However, it is probable that most productive information will be related to the properties of soft tissues, since in impact the limiting point may well be damage to a critical organ or system at lev- els far below skeletal structural failure. Also, trauma may oc- cur at the cellular level with no gross evidence of shear, tensile, or compressive forces. Fig. 6 and Table 3 show some approxi- mate physical properties of human tissues. A mathematical model describing the response of the cadaver zygomatic (cheek) bones to blunt impact has been devised (106, 107). The response of the zygoma and zygomatic arch are described by means of a linear undamped model, which is reported to be an accurate simulation of facial bone response to 75% of the fracture threshold, but not of skull response. Very few spe- cific models have been developed. In interesting work recently reported by Hodgson and Patrick, dynamic response of the cadaver head to steady-state vibrations is found predictable within 5% over a wide range of pulse durations and accelera- tion levels and "approximately similar" to a simple spring-mass system (174). The mechanical properties of soft tissues have had limited study. The skin appears to fail more often in a tensile or cohe- sive manner than from a shearing or cutting action. Penetra- tion resistance of human skin is thought to be about 1 5-20 lb (64).

Experiments with nonhuman primates support the theory that torsion, shear forces, or abrupt pressure gradients which disturb the brain stem, are necessary for concussion. Data indicate that pressure transmission within the central ner- vous system in Gz abrupt impact applied to the intracranial contents are from the viscera to the spinal column through a myriad of venous anastomoses and then up the spinal cord (177). The thoracic organs (heart, lungs, and liver) contained in the rib cage, as well as the abdominal viscera, are suspended freely by connective tissues from the muscle and bone framework. Visceral motion responses have been measured by cineradiog- raphy and a density wave, interpreted as a shear wave (dila- tion), was observed to travel throughout the abdomen and torso. It was concluded that voluntary tolerance may be be- low 13 fps velocity change (180). Monkeys exposed to about 56 fps velocity change for 14 ms duration at 4820 G/sec onset rate sustained vertebral compression injury and subendocar- dial, subcapular (liver), and subpleural (lungs) hemorrhages. Both a surface wave and shear wave were observed similar to the substantial abdominal compression found in vertical im- pact tests of sootey mangebey monkeys (181) and in cats (49, 50, 182). In impact tests with beagle dogs, at 20 -Gz for 30 ms duration, relative displacement curves were found to resem- ble a sine-wave perturbation with superimposed damping. The free vibration is completely attenuated after 300 ms from the onset of the forcing period. Natural frequency was estimated as 6.4 Hz (183). Such studies suggest that the heart, great vessel branches, and associated visceral attachments behave as a spring-mass system, with subcriticai damping frequency of 7.5 Hz for the human diaphragm, when the abdominal musculature is relaxed voluntarily at impact (180). Whole body studies with humans (180), pigs (184), and dogs (183) also suggest the thoracic vis- cera may respond as a spring-mass system with viscous damp- ing. In these studies, 4.5 Hz is reported for the diaphragm and heart (185). Mechanical driving-point impedance (a complex function) is the ratio of the driving force acting on a system to the resulting velocity of the system (186). This technique has been used on small areas of the body surface (187), and also for the sitting and standing human subject exposed to whole body vibrations (173, 188-192). The general impedance con- cept appears to be used in conditions where the motion is rec- tilinear, but may apply equally well for angular motions or combinations of rectilinear and angular motions (193). Fig. 7 illustrates some human impedance results and indicates that critical frequencies are found at 7 and 12 Hz (191, 192). The impedance model is essentially an energy transfer model, and, as such, defines the energy transfer patterns and, while it gives no a priori estimate of absolute levels, can indicate that certain impact environments will be more likely to present tolerance problems than others. This means that protection systems may be designed without a complete knowledge of the human tolerance levels since the minimum energy transfer and there- fore maximum protection should result. Payne has found rela- tive displacement of "critical mass" or, in effect, "critical spring deflection" a useful measure of tolerance (194). Orne and Liu have developed a model for the prediction of spinal injuries sustained in impact which, it is claimed, will ac- cept parametric values for horizontal, as well as vertical, im- pacts, including "whiplash" and "seat-belt syndrome" type of injuries in automobile collisions (195, 196). A comprehensive review of mathematical models which describes both the re- sponse of the whole body and specific components has been made by Roberts, et al. (197). Models describing occupant kinetics have been particularly useful tools for prediction. Thompson has developed and combined two mathematical models, an 8 deg-of-freedom three-dimensional occupant, and a 1500 deg-of-freedom vehicle structure into a single system to study restrained occupant responses to multicar collisions (198). Eight-mass, two-dimensional models have been devel- oped (199) and, more recently, in most advanced modeling re- ported to date, Roberts and Robbins have developed a three- mass, three-dimensional model (179). A mathematical model of the human body has been designed to predict the inertial properties in any fixed body position to develop a design guide (200). However, it does not consider the asymmetrical location of internal organs of the body, the variation of inertial properties during position or weight change, or variation when the body tissues are subjected to ex- ternal force. Further, the basic data used to determine the principal axes of the body were extremely limited and proba- bly not representative, and, since body hinge points and joint range of motion have never been measured, several assump- tions were made. While the mathematical model is developing into an im- mensely useful tool its ability to validly simulate human dy- namic responses remains extremely limited. Validation of the model is usually restricted to experimental tests with dum- mies, not humans, thus, in effect, one model is simulating another model, and assuming the human reactions. In this re- spect medical scientists, familiar with the complexities, varia- tions, and unknowns of the human body, appear less confident in the predictive ability of the model than many engineers. Kulowski, for example, points out that "... rather than a rela- LIGAMENT OF TRE1TZ 'j ifP/fjÙM / / / J J A T-TRANSVERSK L= LONGITUDINAL ST0MACH INTESTINE - LARGE / / J /H// ffiuV / ZJI'JT iT AORTA - THORACIC ř S / /WW?/ / llfï S / / DIAPHRAGM - ATTACHMENTS &gt; / / /riSïfy S' 1 SKIN - ABDOMINAL /////m /////NJ ^ RECTUS ABDOMINIS MUSCLE f / / ņflffl// J J 1 1 ' ' * ' 1 1 .1 .2 .3 .4 .5 .6 .7 BREAKING INDEX BREAKING INDEX=B^^^ mODU^Us" = ,NCREASE 0F LENGTH T0 BREAKING Fig. 7 - Some results to date showing breaking strength of various ex- cised human and dog tissues (from Nickerson and Drasic, 400)</page><page sequence="15">HUMAN IMPACT TOLERANCE 1 389 tively homogeneous mass such as engineers are accustomed to describe the body is a heterogeneous viscoelastic substance, is polyphacic with liquid, gaseous, and solid components, is not isotropic- bone for example, having different properties in dif- ferent planes" (66). He notes the numerous ways in which many kinds of materials are linked and that the elastic moduli and stress limits for these variations change with either posi- tion change or physiological state. As a highly damped sys- tem, especially critical for soft tissues, the body is subject to vibratory responses, wave propagation, excitations producing responses in many ways and modes (with energy transfer be- tween various modes), and to reconcentration of energy at points remote from the site of application of the original load. Taylor, in perhaps the most forthright discussion of biologi- cal limitations of modeling to date, traces the historical back- ground leading to erroneous assumptions that the body is like a single, linear spring-mass, or simple nonlinear spring-mass, that tolerance is synonymous with structural failure, and that struc- tural failure may be predicted from a consideration of fre- quency response, elastic moduli, coefficient of damping, etc. Taylor cites nine "serious" problems with this approach, ex- pressing the viewpoint that "... the theoretical mathematical model approach appears to be untenable at present" (10, p. 15). Simulation of kinematic motion of the body and its three-dimensional response in reaction to various inputs ap- pears to be an encouraging development which has already been effective in the design of experiments. However, most data points are still missing. Voluntary tests only provide non- injurious information, while models, based upon dummies which are themselves very imperfect models, may provide de- lusionary validation. Pitfalls inherent in modeling have been summarized by Golomb in a recent paper (201). While it may never be feasible to stop experimental crashing of vehicles, this effort may be greatly reduced in the future through increased modeling studies. It is to be hoped that as more is known about the properties and enormous variation between individuals, and even with individuals from instant to instant, models may become of greater validity and practical use. DAMAGE SENSITIVITY CURVES AND INJURY SCALES - There have been attempts to bring together impact tolerance data into a summary form which will provide predictions for ranges of injury under specified environmental conditions. The objective of such curves is to provide, by making projec- tions, rough estimates of survival or injury from known experi- mental and clinical findings. A number of injury scales have been devised in order to pro- vide a universal means of assessing and evaluating human tissue damage, especially related to impacts in vehicular accidents (202-21 1). Nearly all of these fall short of their stated objec- tive, primarily because the weight given in each respective cri- teria varies significantly in individual judgments. No scale has yet eliminated the subjective elements sufficiently so that di- verse users can be assured that others would classify the same injuries identically. An excellent discussion and listing of most of these scales may be found in a recent paper by States (212). A current de- velopment is the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS), based upon an earlier Cornell Scale, the General Motors Scale, and others which permit a simple rapid estimate of injury by nonphysi- cian investigators using descriptive terms "minor, moderate, severe, life-threatening, and fatal." Using five separate criteria, a more complex Comprehensive Research Injury Scale (CRIS) has been concurrently developed to take into consideration factors of energy dissipation, threat-to-life, permanent impair- ment, treatment period, and incidence. Interestingly, four rankings of fatal injuries, 6 to 9, were found necessary, similar to the four rankings of fatal injuries, 7 to 10, proposed by Hasbrook, et al. (207), in 1958 for scaling aircraft crash trauma. The simple four-category scale consisting of minor, moderate, dangerous (life-threatening), and fatal (death within 72 hr of accident) used by General Motors Corp.-Motors Ins. Corp. (GM-MIC) are substantially the same injury categories as used by UCLA (204, 205). Further development of a Specific Trauma Medical Index is under study by the American Medi- cal Assoc. (213,214). Such scales will contribute greatly to improved information concerning the nature, extent, and se- verity of injuries occurring in automotive accidents, and also will provide, as better collision damage assessments are availa- ble, a more objective assessment of clinical impact tolerance. The predictive value of curves which can isolate parameters of magnitude, duration, onset rate, and restraint factors is obvious. A number of attempts to utilize experimental and clinical data as a basis for injury predictive scales have been made. Kornhauser, finding too few datum points available to per- mit the use of predictions with any reasonable level of confi- dence (215), conducted impact experiments on mice to obtain statistical validity (216). He was able to construct sensitivity curves which are widely used (217,218). Subsequently, in one of the few scientific critiques in the literature, Simon of the Air Force Office of Scientific Research pointed out a sub- stantial number of basic errors in Kornhauser's work, labeling theoretical portions "obviously nonsense" (p. 6) and "not to be recommended," and provided alternative methods of draw- ing sensitivity curves (219). A Dynamic Response Index (DRI) has been developed which represents the maximum dynamic compression of the vertebral column under +GZ loading (220). A "subjective ac- celeration severity index (S. I.)" developed by Stech, in which impulsive velocity change was plotted against an averaged sub- jective index (221), was obtained by taking test subject re- ports of impact severity in experiments of Swearingen and us- ing a rating scale which took into account drop height and cushioning condition. Stech considered a subjective endpoint to be 11 .2-fps impact velocity for these conditions, but found indications that "... the head becomes the controlling factor in tolerance to short rise time acceleration pulses" (221, p. iii). An acceleration-time tolerance curve for moderate concus- sion (from forehead impact on a hard flat surface with accel- eration measured on the back of the head opposite the point of impact) has been developed at Wayne State University (222, 223) resulting from work with cadavers and animals related to head impact during the past two decades. However, there ap-</page><page sequence="16">1390 R.G.SNYDER parently is no published information which documents the specific data used to establish the points which this curve rep- resents. Although it is widely referred to in the literature and has formed a basis for both Dept. of Transportation vehicle safety standards (224) and SAE J885a (70), it is not possible to evaluate its significance on the basis of published informa- tion. It is quite different, in fact, from an earlier "Wayne curve" published in 1960 (225) which showed the relationship between acceleration and time required to produce fracture in four cadaver heads falling freely (detached from the torso) and in two cadaver heads falling with the body (225). An error apparently appeared in this version in that one (of only six) point upon which the curve is based does not match in- formation given in the text. While the other five points are apparently based upon peak acceleration values, the sixth point was plotted from the average acceleration (a difference of 377 G from the peak value given for that point). This point is the only one which appears to fit on the "new" curve. Fig. 8 shows these curves. Note that values lying above the tolerance curve are regarded as dangerous to life/values below it as tolerable. The usefulness of the Wayne curve is limited since it applies only to frontal impact of the human head on a flat hard surface. The Wayne curve is thus only valid for this form of curve and specific tolerance curves would have to be plotted for the evaluation of other impacts. Slattenschek, at the Vienna Institute of Technology, has de- veloped a method of assessing multiple impact tolerance by a "J -tolerance value" (226). Finding that head impacts into the windshield, when different types and grades of glass were used, produced significantly different deceleration curves from the form of the Wayne curve, Slattenschek developed a vibration model by forcing a second order linear differential equation onto the Wayne curve, and determined the tolerable 500 ri F « 1 r-ł- i- 190 •g o HEADS without BODY IX • HEADS with BODY -,0 ^ IX '&gt; 1 i i i " 72 -,0 £ ^ O 3QQ ' 'l960 CURVE (Curve at right) 54 w X i i i r E ' X i s £ 200 - &gt;r- 36 I § 'j&gt;RESENT WAYNE CURVE ^ d 100 r-H ' I -] I8 ž O 80 G FMVSS CRITERION "V" f &lt;c o I I I I I I I I I MM ¿-JL- I Q Si 0 .002.004.006.008.010.012 0.1 ■" TIME IN SECONDS Fig. 8 - Comparison of 1960 Wayne curve (255, p.8, Fig. 3) and pre- sent Wayne curve (223, p. 170, Fig. 1). Original curve indicated rela- tionship between acceleration and time required to produce fracture in cadaver heads falling freely and heads falling with the body. Values of 1-5 represent peak acceleration values, while 6 (180 G) is given as an average value (peak acceleration for this point was apparently 557 G), although not plotted. No data points have been published in the later version shown, but new Wayne curve is intended to show impact toler- ance for human brain in forehead impacts against plane, Unyielding surfaces. Superimposed on this curve is present FMVSS 80 G, 3 ms performance criterion (224) amplitudes Xertia. The amplitude's Xmax on the model is de- termined for the given test to be evaluated. The tolerance value is then j = Xmax a) 1 ' Xertia a) 1 ' where J = 1 is the limit of tolerability. Both the J-tolerance value and the S.I. of Gadd (71) are based on assessment of the impact severity and its relation to the de- gree of injury of the Wayne curve, but are based upon diamet- rically opposed concepts of the cerebral injury process. Another approach has been taken by Gadd, who has devel- oped an exponential weighting factor for assessment of head impact pulses (71, 227). This method proposes an impulse- integration procedure which is intended to take into account the relative importance of time and intensity of the pulse, in contrast to measures with criteria of peak G or impulse area. S.I. attributes a value of 1000 for ". . . threshold of danger to life for internal head injury in frontal blows" (227, p. 170). Gadd has further suggested an injury number of 500 for facial bone fracture in impact over an effective area of 3 sq in. (227, p. 172). The S.I. criterion is derived from measurement of the slope curves of "all available data" on human head accelera- tion-time tolerance. The average slope was found to be 2.5, that is, the acceleration magnitude was more important than its time duration by the weighting exponent 2.5. On log-log paper the slope is roughly a straight line from 1 to 2 ms out to about 60 ms. However, at long time durations the tolerance curve becomes asymptotic, so the formula does not hold true for such duration. For example, we normally are exposed to 1 G all our lives, whereas this formula would indicate that a fa- tal injury would occur in about 1 6 sec. Another caution in the use of the S.I. is that while the upper limit for survival is estimated to be the number 1000, moderate injury may occur at 700, and to design for the highest survival limit may well exceed a lethal dose statistically. These numbers only mea- sure force-time tolerance and assume that no pressure-induced localized crushing or penetration of the brain has taken place. In actual practice, a serious injury could occur due to pressure concentration, even though the severity index value is very low. Severity index is defined as a single number: ftf S.I. = andt (2) to where: a = Acceleration, force, or pressure of response function, G n = Weighting factor greater than 1 (2.5 has been used for internal injury to the head in frontal blows, and is suggested for facial bone fracture) to = Starting time of the acceleration pulse, sec tf = Final time of the acceleration pulse, sec</page><page sequence="17">HUMAN IMPACT TOLERANCE 1 39 1 Integration of this expression yields an S.I., and the resulting number can be used either for comparing different tests for relative severity of impact, or secondly, for estimating where a safe maximum value is exceeded in an impact. This is tedious to calculate by hand integration, so GM has developed a sim- ple analog computer which records the S.I. directly on the im- pact data oscillograph paper, calibrated so that S.I. value can be read as a function of inches. Elsewhere the S.I. value is used in such areas as glass-headform impacts, and a digital counter has been developed which allows a direct reading. The validity of scales such as the S.I. has been questioned. The restrictions imposed by both the preliminary nature of the data upon which it is based and the limited area and con- ditions of its use are not well understood in actual practice. Examples of such misuse have crept into the technical litera- Fig. 9 - Illustration of hypothetical impact with calculation of S.I. (A). Change of velocity is about 20 mph and S.I. is about 286.

Dotted line (B) on curve represents unforeseen hard spot in in- strument panel being tested, resulting in 90 G for 3 ms, failing to meet standard. Yet in this second case S.I. is still only 556, far below criteria for head injury shown by this method Calculations Increment Increment, Midpoint Incremental No. sec G value 2.5 G S.I., Time X G^ 1 0.001 7 130 0.13 2 0.001 18 1,400 1.40 3 0.001 23 2,500 2.50 4 0.002 27 3,800 7.60 5 0.001 30 4,900 4.90 6 0.001 40 10,000 10.00 7 0.001 38 8,800 8.80 8 0.001 47 15,000 15.00 9 0.001 75 48,000 48.00 10 0.001 80 57,000 57.00 11 0.001 73 46,000 46.00 12 0.001 56 23,000 23.00 13 0.001 43 12,000 12.00 14 0.002 37 8,300 16.60 15 0.002 33 6,200 12.40 16 0.001 27 3,800 3.80 17 0.001 24 2,800 2.80 18 0.007 20 1,800 12.60 19 0.001 17 1,200 1.20 20 0.002 10 330 0.68 S.I. 286.39 ture, as, for example, its recent misapplication to validate the effectiveness of a child restraint system. Data obtained on adult frontal bone impacts have not been shown to have a valid relationship to a similar impact in children. Several cri- tiques presently in preparation by other investigators will in- clude further technical discussion of weaknesses and limita- tions of Gadd's Severity Index, the J-tolerance curve, and the Wayne curve, and undoubtedly these authors will be propos- ing alternative indices. The S.I. may offer an advantage over present requirements for head impact criterion which state that "... the decelera- tion of the head shall not exceed 80 G (sec) continuously for more than 3 milliseconds" for testing seatbacks and instru- ment panels (224). The present FMVSS performance criterion of a single point only represents human tolerance for a spe- cific time duration. When the time duration is less than 4-5 ms, higher values of deceleration are tolerable, whereas at du- rations longer than 10-20 ms, 80 G may appear too high. Un- der present performance requirements an instrument panel or seat back that shows 81 G under the test conditions does not comply. Fig. 9 shows the acceleration-time curves of a hypo- thetical impact, with a change in velocity of about 20 mph and an S.I. of 286. The curve also meets the 80 G criterion, with about 65 and 78 G for a 3 and 1 ms cut-off time respec- tively. The dotted line represents an unforeseen hard spot in the panel being tested. In this case, G readings are now 90 G for 3 ms and 108 G for 1 ms, and would fail to meet the stan- dard. However, the S.I. for this impact is still only 556, far below the criteria for head injury shown by this method. Which is more meaningful? Another way of defining impact sensitivity can be in terms of impact force per unit area and duration. For short time du- ration, the body is thought to act as a rigid mass, while longer time duration effects are thought to be due to shifts in body fluids and tissues. Thompson, using data points from a Fig. 10 - Another way of defining impact sensitivity is in terms of im- pact force per unit area and duration. Shown are data points plotted from falls, vertical tests, and rocket sled experiments with human subjects. The body is thought to act as a rigid mass for shorter times shown on left side of chart, while for longer duration, on right, effects are hypothesized to be caused by shifts in body fluids and tissues. These results are influenced by variations in body position and re- straint (228)</page><page sequence="18">1392 R.G.SNYDER number of human experimental sources, has proposed that at whole body tolerances, 28-32 psi is the onset level for shock, and 45-55 psi is the level for 50% mortality for trans- verse accelerations of less than 0.07 sec duration (228). In this concept, G, rate of onset, and onset time are all depen- dent variables while impact force per unit area, delta velocity change and impact pulse time define the tolerance envelope (Fig. 10). These data are valid only for transverse body orien- tations and do not apply to other directions of inertial force. Unit surface pressures as a criteria for the design of restraint systems were also proposed by Boyce and Freeman, and they suggested limits of 45 psi at 60 G on forehead and chin, 9-30 psi on the rest of the body, 1 13 psi on the kneecaps (229). To date, no satisfactory method for the measurement of pres- sure on the body has been developed, although it could be a most useful tool. REGIONAL TOLERANCES OF THE BODY The human body is an extremely complex biophysical sys- tem, responding to impact with considerable variation both within the same individual and between different individuals. For each region of the body there can be defined specific tol- erances for particular structures. Such localized trauma may, in turn, limit whole body tolerance to the lowest threshold of an organ, such as the pancreas, or heart, or tissue such as brain. Since experimentation is very hazardous with humans, rela- tively little information concerning biochemical or physiolog- ical responses is known. While much more information is available concerning skeletal fracture levels, such data are gen- erally not as critical to life as soft tissue injury to organs or systemic trauma to the nervous, circulatory, or respiratory systems. The following sections summarize and discuss the current state of our knowledge of impact to various regions of the body. HEAD IMPACT - Injury to the head is the most frequent and severest result of impact. Head injury has been found to occur in over 70% of automotive accidents and is considered to be the major cause of fatalities (230). The head is also in- volved in 50% of persons injured in motorcycle accidents (231 , 232), and in 70% of persons injured in accidental falls in the home (233). Probably no area of the body has had more thorough investigation to date of the effects of impact stress than the head. In 1969, heàd injury produced by mechanical forces to the skull, scalp, or brain, received the attention of 284 investigators on 92 research projects in the United States alone (234). Every impact conference in recent years has had research results of some head impact study presented, and sev- eral have been devoted exclusively to the subject (235, 236). There is a voluminous literature regarding head impact, skull fracture, cervical injury, and the mechanisms of brain injury, and no attempt will be made here to present more than a brief view of some current major research directions. An extensive and comprehensive review of the literature of experimental studies* of mechanical effects of head impact injuries has been published by Lingren, with a critical evaluation of "possible technical errors" (237). A current discussion of scalp, skull, and brain impact injuries related to experimental research may be found in Douglas, et al. (238). The frontal and occipital bones of the skull have been sub- jected to numerous impact studies (239, 240), but limited data are available related to lateral impact tolerance of the pa- rietal or temporal bones (241). Within the conditions studied, the total energy required for skull fracture varies from 400 to 900 in.-lb, with an average often assumed to be 600 in.-lb o (6.8 X 10 ergs) (242). The shape and elastic properties of the object injuring the head and exposure time are of prime im- portance in determining the degree of injury. Force (fracture) tolerance at the side of the skull appears to be about one half that found for the frontal region. In experimental studies of localized head impact with unem- balmed and embalmed cadavers (used within 1 year of em- balming), Nahum, et al., concluded that ". . . embalming did not appear to affect results for the areas studied," yet they also reported that the thickness (or presence or absence) of soft tissue was shown to play an important role, and paradox- ically noted that "... embalming adversely affects the test re- sults" (241). In one case these authors impacted one half of an unembalmed skull, embalmed it, and impacted the other half for comparison. Tests of unembalmed cadavers were con- ducted from 2-4 days after death. More detailed discussion of the reported effects of embalming was presented earlier. Gadd and Patrick have compared system tests and simplified laboratory impact procedures for the chest and head and con- clude that "... an appreciably less head impact severity is shown by the system test" (243). Assuming that angular im- pacts to the head are most frequent, and therefore should be the basis for a laboratory test, and further assuming that im- pacts are typically high on the forehead, where a relatively high fracture tolerance level has been found, they suggest an impact velocity between 15-24.5 mph as appropriate for lab- oratory testing representing the threshold of severe head injury. Sensitivity curves relative to head impact tolerance have pre- viously been covered. Based upon the Wayne curve for head impact to frontal bone the following values have been pro- posed as tolerable (Fig. 8): 1. 180 G for 2 ms. 2. 135 G for 3 ms. 3. 110 G for 4 ms. 4. 100 G for 5 ms. 5. 90 G for 6 ms. 6. 85 G for 7 ms. 7. 80 G for 8 ms. 8. 74 G for 10 ms. 9. 57 G for 20 ms. Very limited information is available concerning localized deformation of the automotive occupant's head in contact with the interior of the vehicle in an accident. Impact toler- ance (forces necessary for fracture) under localized loading by a 1-sq in. impactor has been experimentally obtained by Nahum, et al. (241). In contrast with the tolerance of the brain to closed-skull injury, they found that skull and facial fractures are relatively independent of impulse direction and rate of onset, and can be described in terms of peak force. It</page><page sequence="19">HUMAN IMPACT TOLERANCE 1393 is important to note that they also reported a significant dif- ference between male and female skull fracture levels, and that soft tissue thickness similarly influenced fracture tolerances. Values producing fractures with a contact area of approxi- mately 1 sq in. are listed in Table 4. In more recent work conducted by Melvin, et al., at The University of Michigan, three different cylindrical-shaped steel penetrators having less than 1-sq in. surface were used to de- fine tolerance values at three velocity inputs (244). Dynamic load measurements on skull and kneebone, conducted with less than 1-sq in. penetrators (such as a control knob), show that skull penetration takes place in five steps: initial load build-up as the penetrator loads the entire skull structure; sud- den penetration of the outer layer of compact bone, with abrupt fall-off in load, in primarily a tensile fracture approxi- mately the circumference of the penetrator; compression of the diploic layer; a cone-shaped shear failure extending to the inner layer of compact bone; and finally, a fracture of the in- ner table in the form of a plug larger than the diameter of the penetrator. Soft tissue does not significantly alter the skull penetration load (244). Table 5 shows skull localized penetra- tion tolerances for these impacts of embalmed parietal and frontal skull bone. Penetration force versus penetrator type and impact velocity is shown in Figs. 1 1 and 12. Limited tests on fresh unembalmed bone plugs indicated similar results.

The approximate concussion threshold level for man is 60 G (237), but soft tissue injury is time dependent, and monkeys subjected to over 700 G have been observed to have only min- imal level of clinical concussion (238). There has been found to be a wide range in the "dosage" required for onset of con- cussion in subhuman primates in about 10% of animals (65 G) and that required for concussion in 100% of animals (900 G) (245). Concussion has been variously defined and has been the subject of considerable study. A recent discussion of mechanism of cerebral concussion and head injury has been published by Thomas (246) and of physical factors by Hodgson (247). Intracranial dynamics measured during im- pact by Sonntag and Bynum (177) on -Gz impact on Daisy Track with macaque monkeys and chimpanzees exposed to 7.5-52.5 G, support the theory that torsion, shear forces, or abrupt pressure gradients which disturb the brain stem are necessary to produce concussion. At impact levels from 7.5 to 52.5 G at less than 150 ms, no concussions were produced and pinnal or external auditory meatus reflexes to noxious stimuli were intact. They found that at the levels tested pres- sure per se does not cause concussion.

In- jury from acceleration, produced by relative movement of body tissues, has been directly observed in head injury studies, where brain motions during head impact have been recorded through transparent skullcaps by high-speed photographic and roentgenographic techniques (250-253). Basic dynamic shear modulus values were obtained on eight human brains studied by Fallenstein, et al., who found that G lies between 6-1 1x10^ dynes/ sq cm, and tan ô is in the range 0.40-0.55 (254). In vivo tests of rhesus monkey cerebral cor- tex indicate a decreasing tan ô with decreasing blood pressure, and initial in vivo to in vitro correlations indicated that the means for resolving questions of postmortem changes, blood pressure effects, and frequency effects on the dynamic prop- erties of brain tissue may have been found. Viscoelastic prop- erties of the brain, dura, and scalp are also being studied (255), and a mathematical elastodynamic model proposed (256). Hodgson and Patrick have compared dynamic response of a human cadaver head with a simple mathematical model (174). Another theory related to hydrostatic tension has been pro- posed by Unterharnscheidt (257) who attributes a phenome- non to the brain as it attempts to separate from the skull as the latter accelerates at impact. Concussion may be accom- panied by deformation or fracture of the skull with shear strains throughout the brain. An experimental model of the human head shows the existence of pressure gradients along three orthogonal axes, and at levels of impact to the forehead of less than 80 G the pressure gradients are linear in shape. Cerebrospinal fluid flow can produce shear stresses previously demonstrated in the region of the brain stem (118). In 1943 Holbourn proposed a theory explaning injury to the brain as caused by shear strain, assuming all factors other than the physical are neglected. Shear strains could be pro- duced, according to his predictions, in the brain at the point of impact due to deformation of the skull with or without fracture; secondly, could be produced remotely from the im- pact point by the sudden rotation of the head, resulting in contrecoup injuries and some intracranial hemorrhages. He also suggested that concussion is the result of sudden rotation of the head (258). Subsequent studies by Pudenz and Sheldon (250) and by Ommaya (259) of motions of the brain during impact appear to confirm the prediction of brain rota- tional movement, and Martinez has shown that rotation alone (in whiplash) can produce brain injury in rabbits (260). The prime importance of rotational acceleration in the production of concussion has been emphasized by Ommaya, Hirsch, and associates (261, 262). However, Hodgson, Gurdjian, and others, at Wayne State University, contend that other factors may be at least equally important in the production of cerebral concussion (247). In their view, cerebral concussion may be better explained in terms of resultant intracranial pressure gradients, causing high shear stress concentration in the brain stem and upper spinal cord, with negative components of the induced pressure waves inducing cavitation which may cause additional types of trauma (247, 263). The concept of a compressive wave in the brain at impact being reflected from the inner surface of the skull back into the brain as a tensile wave, which could result in damaging cavitation phenomena, has been proposed by Goldsmith (264). At present there are many areas of disagree- ment among researchers in head impact as to the mechanisms of injuries. Impact injury to the head may result in other serious conse- quences. Bean and Beckman have described pathology to the lungs of congestion, hemorrhage, atelectasis, and edema after mechanical head injury in rats (265, 266). In other head in- jury studies in rats and monkeys, these researchers showed that a significant decrease occurred in pulmonary compliance dynamically measured (267). FACE - Experimental studies indicate that the bones of the face fracture due to tension, not compression (125). Force to fracture facial bones has been found to be time dependent, with 1000 lb tolerated for durations of 3 ms or less, while im- pacts lasting beyond 4 ms produce fracture at approximately 2001b fora 1-sqin.areaof distribution (268, 260). A mathe- matical model describing the response of the cadaver zygomata (cheek bones) to blunt impact has been used (270). Impacts as low as 30-40 G for 1040 ms may produce transient uncon- sciousness, and fracture tolerance for the facial bones is about 30 G for the nose, 50 G for the cheek bone, 100 G for teeth (3.6 sq in.), 40 G for the mandible, and 80 G for the 3 ms (1-sq in. area) or 1 50 G (4-sq in. area) for the forehead (68, 271). For a contact area of 1 sq in., fracture tolerance values for the cheek bone have been found to approximate 200-225 lb, for the temporal-parietal (side of head) area 450- 550 lb, and 900-1 100 lb for the frontal area (98). A 600 Hz natural frequency, 0.01 damping factor, 9.5 lb simple system has been found to represent occiput acceleration response to impacts on the forehead for a 1-sq in. area within 5%, for a wide range of pulse durations and acceleration amplitudes in the cadaver (174). Such results, found on limited numbers of aged cadaver specimens, must be applied with caution for the living human, who is subject to wide variation in sex and age tolerances to bone fracture. NECK - A common occurrence in automotive rear-end col- lision is the phenomena of the so-called "whiplash" or injury to the cervical spinal cord, especially at the first vertebra, which appears to occur from hyperextension rearwards, fol- lowed by abrupt flexion when the whole body is accelerated from back to front without head support. At present, well over 200 papers concerning this injury have been published in the literature, yet to date its precise definition, nature, mea- surement, and diagnosis and treatment are still subjects of medical disagreement. Resulting injury may involve rotation of the brain, coup- and contrecoup, the cord and spinal nerves, and differential movement of the brain and brain stem, as well as implicating vestibular, nerve root, and muscle spasm factors. The neck does not appear to react to impact in the same manner as other body regions, in that some low-speed impacts often produce injury as severe, or even more severe, than high- speed impacts. It is not unusual for post-impact symptoms to</page><page sequence="21">HUMAN IMPACT TOLERANCE 1 395 arise some six months after the impact. Tests have indicated that forces transmitted to the occupant increase rapidly in a rear-end collision up to 10 mph, since a rear-end structure does not absorb energy until 10 mph velocity is exceeded (272). Women have been found to be more vulnerable than males (273) to whiplash injury. Experimental "whiplash" studies have been conducted with animals (260, 262, 274, 275), cadavers (79), and human vol- unteer subjects (79, 83, 277-279). Such tests can be ex- tremely dangerous for humans because of the often unpredict- ably low impact levels at which injury may occur. Studies of over 1 00 runs conducted on the Daisy Decelera- tor show human subjects may experience some 40 deg of neck flexion during a 9.3 G lateral deceleration (278). More re- cently 236 sled tests, with 17 human volunteer subjects, have been completed up to 10 G peak sled acceleration, in a -G body orientation to the inertial force (280). Neither of these studies reproduced typical whiplash conditions but indicated the relatively low levels at which the unrestrained head may be voluntarily tested. Although injury to the neck is not as commonly reported in automobile accidents as is injury to other body regions, it may often be fatal. ACIR statistics show over 4%, and UCLA studies show some 2%, of injuries attributed to the neck, the majority of such trauma relating to "whiplash" consequences. The human neck contains vital nerve, vascular, and respiratory structures which are particularly unprotected against impact. The larynx is especially vulnerable to blunt impact, with com- pression fracture of the thyroid, cricoid, or tracheal cartilages leading to serious injury. Very limited studies of laryngeal impact tolerances have been conducted. Nahum, et al., has tested embalmed and unembalmed cadavers and reported values in the range of 200-250 lb for fracture of the thyroid cartilage, and 175-225 lb for fracture of the cricoid cartilage in embalmed cadavers (98). SAE J885a provides an estimate at 150 lb peak force for the throat, based mainly on unpub- lished data from excised hog larynxes. Further investigation of animal and unembalmed human laryngeal tolerances is un- der way by Olson, et al., at The University of Michigan (281). IMPACT TOLERANCE OF CHEST - In automotive acci- dents, thoracic injuries are the second most common cause of fatality (282). Transverse - Gx impact to the chest produces a marked anterior-posterior compression of the thoracic cage and inertial displacement of the cardiorespiratory organs. Of- ten injuries are attributed to crushing or shearing of organs be- tween the rigid spine and the impinging anterior force, involv- ing the steering wheel rim, hub, instrument panels, or other intruding or contacting surface. However, the full scope of actual mechanisms of injury is still not clearly defined. Major findings to date in clinical studies and experimental tests indi- cate that several mechanical factors have been identified, and, although conflicting opinions occur, it seems probable that a combination of factors influence resulting injury. Louhimo provides an extensive summary of blunt thoracic injury studies (283). A considerable number of studies, during the past 40 years, have reported the correlation between blunt thoracic impact and cardiac injury. A wide variety of heart lesions, ranging from fatal atrial and ventricular rupture to sudden death with- out demonstrable cardiac changes, may follow chest or ab- dominal compression of the heart between the sternum and vertebral column (284), and recent thoracic force-deflection studies on primates indicate such excursions can compress the chest two-thirds its depth (136). Cardiac rupture may begin in the inner layer of the heart muscle (endocardial surface) and proceed outward into the middle layer (myocardium) (285-288), possibly as a result of forces applied to the abdo- men or by violent compression of the legs and abdomen pro- ducing increased intrathoracic pressure. Myocardiac fiber rup- tures have occurred at points far removed from the point at which force was applied to the filled heart (285). Evans and Patrick (289) suggest that the impact of the heart to the an- terior wall of the thorax "with secondary recoil" to be the mechanism involved in heart and pericardial (the thin mem- branous sac which surrounds the heart and roots of the great vessels) damage. In analyzing clinical cases of automotive cardiothoracic injuries, Lasky, et al. (5) and Demuth, et al. (290) have found that a large proportion of moderate to severe injuries of the heart and great vessels may occur without ap- parent outward signs and be overlooked, and also that cardio- vascular injury may be considerably more frequent than statis- tics indicate, emphasizing the side-impact collision potential for producing such injury. It is interesting to speculate, in view of their findings, as to how many drivers may suffer a heart contusion, or localized weakening of the cardiac wall undetected in an accident, which may lead to a subsequent problem or fatality at a much later date. A case of a driver im- pacted against a steering wheel and who later developed a traumatic thoracic aortic aneurysm (a sac-like building of weakened aortic wall) has been clinically reported (291). Lasky, et al., feel that biomechanical effects of impact to the cardiovascular system may occur in three ways: shearing of the great vessels, direct compression upon the walls of the heart with bruising and direct tissue injury, or pressure -volume changes of the blood in the closed system (5). Other investi- gators also feel that pressure -volume changes in the blood vessels are highly significant in producing trauma to the car- diovascular system (1, 10, 184). An opposing view concerning the mechanism of aortic rup- ture following blunt impact has been expressed by Roberts (293-296). In tests on 55 dogs it was found that tears of the aorta and great vessels were the result of displacement of the heart into the left chest, thus injury was attributed to mechan- ical factors (294). In four dogs an intracardiac injection was given prior to impact which arrested the heart and resulted in no perceptible blood pressure. Post-impact, two of the dogs were found to have received severe injuries: a massive medi- astinal hematoma in one case and a massive pericardial rupture in the other. Therefore, Roberts and Moffat feel that pressure cannot be of major consequence as a factor. The contention that vascular ruptures are caused by violent mechanical dis- placement of the thoracic viscera, rather than by hydrody- namic rupture due to excessive intravascular pressure, has also been expressed by Fidler (297) and Cammack, et al. (298), in clinical studies. In ±GZ impact especially, tension is on the</page><page sequence="22">1396 R. G. SNYDER aortic arch as the thoracic aorta is stretched by diaphragmatic and visceral attachments. Rupture of the ascending aorta just above the aortic valve and tearing at the origins of the brachio- cephalic and subclavian arteries may occur with increased dis- placement in the ascending and descending portions of the aorta. These have been found to be sites of most prevalent injury (297, 299). Recent studies by Hanson suggest an inertial displacement mechanism. He examined the relationship between thoracic arterial transmural pressure and rupture of the thoracic arterial vessels, and found that in dogs exposed to -Gz (headward) de- celeration, over a range of 5-60 G, the transient increase in aortic pressure is compensated by a subsequent rise in intra- plural pressure (183, 300, 301). Vascular ruptures which oc- curred in these studies were attributed to violent inertial dis- placement of the heart and thoracic organs. Major factors attributing to production of this type of injury are the magni- tude of the energy transferred from the decelerating musculo- skeletal system to the thoracic organs, and the magnitude of displacement resulting from this energy transfer. The displace- ment response of organ masses during short duration impact is a function of total velocity change during deceleration (185, 187, 194, 216). Some damage occurred to the heart, liver, and kidneys of dogs which were subjected to a 56 G impact. Fasola indicated that "... mechanism by which cardiac damage is produced in rapid deceleration involves the action of the safety belt in suddenly blocking abdominal blood flow, both in the vena cava and the abdominal aorta" (302). Cineradiographic analysis of human visceral responses to im- pact by Kazarian (303), and Weis and Mohr (180), have shown both a surface shear wave and visceral shear wave resulting in extreme compression of the torso. A critical velocity change at which injury begins to occur because the strain wave asso- ciated with the density wave exceeds the elastic limits of some tissue is suggested. Weis and Mohr (180) speculate that volun- tary tolerancē is below 4 m/sec, and interpret their findings to indicate that this type of shear wave excitation will cause only peripheral injury (subcapsular hemorrhage in the organs at fascial functions and around arteries and veins) until very high energy levels are reached when heart rupture and liver fracture may occur. This analysis supports the concept "... that aortic ruptures are due to pressure waves induced into vascular spaces, probably through the abdomen" (180, p. 1044). A viewpoint that the contractile state of the heart at impact may be the most important single factor in whether rupture occurs has been reported by Life and Pince (304). In experi- mental studies of dogs they found that impact during ventricu- lar systole produced greater statistically significant damage to the ventricular myocardium than impact during diastole. They cite biomechanical factors of the greatly increased myocardial tension without change in volume during the inertial periods of systole (isovolumetric contraction), increasing some 180% as a function of increased length over relaxed (resting) state. This produces increased rigidity and increased frangibility of the myocardium to externally applied force. In addition, the rela- tive incompressibili ty of the blood, coupled with the relatively long opening response time of the pulmonary and aortic valves, compared to the brief duration of impact may produce an "anvil effect," where the myocardium is caught between the "anvil" of the ventricular blood and the "hammer" of the sternum. While the average heartbeat requires a total of 800 ms, the ventricle is in systole (filled with blood) only about 270 ms. Since the average crash impact duration is about 160 ms, all of the impact energy could conceivably be delivered to the heart during systole, producing catastrophic cardiac rup- ture (304). Further, this is a variable which has not often been considered or controlled in experimental- irtipact. Subsequent impacts with 30 rhesus monkeys by Beckman (136) established no relationship as to trauma and phase of the cardiac cycle. Further investigation of this potentially critical factor should be conducted. Physiologic alterations in human máèe volunteers impacted within tolerable subjective pain limits have been reported. Piotrowski (78), testing 6 young male volunteers, impacting steering assemblies at 5 and 15 G, observed bradycardia (slow- ing of the heart below 60 beats/min) at 15 G (~GX) impact, and tachycardia (speeding over 100 beats/min) at 5 G. The observation of bradycardia immediately post-impact has been well documented (6, 31 , 73, 331-334), and has been experi- mentally produced in the baboon fetus (334, 335). It has been hypothesized that hydrostatic pressure within the vascular sys- tem produced by impact stimulates the sino-aortic barorecep- tors which initiate the cardio-inhibitory response (56, 337). Post-impact atropine treatment completely eliminates this ef- fect, indicating relationship to the vagus nerve (336). Increas- ing levels of impact increase both the severity and duration of bradycardia up to the voluntary human limits tested of 30 G (331). The liver and lungs are particularly vulnerable to blunt impact, and pulmonary hematomas or lacerations of the liver are common clinical findings. As the chest is compressed, ribs may fracture, resulting in sharp ends which may penetrate the thoracic organs. However, drivers, who have been reported to have struck the steering wheel with no rib fracture or apparent injury as a result of the blunt trauma, have subsequently died and autopsy revealed pulmonary contusions as cause of death. As a result of these clinical findings Border, et al. (305), ex- perimentally impacted dogs with the lungs inflated via endo- tracheal tube to a pressure of 10-20 mm. They suggest that the closed glottis in association with inflated lungs exerts a protective effect against thoracic-abdominal trauma by wrap- ping the heart and great vessels "... in a pillar of air and push- ing the liver down out of the range of direct trauma" (304). Beckman found no effect in 20 rhesus monkeys (136) but fur- ther studies of the mechanism of glottal closure and effect upon impact tolerance are being studied by Meredith and Olson at The University of Michigan (306). Physiologically, whole body impact studies of seated, restrained human male volun- teers subjected to +GX (rearward facing) deceleration has pro- duced no impairment of pulmonary function at levels up to 20- 25 G (307); however, vascular injury results from exceeding 35 -Gz (headward) peak impacts (300). It has been estimated that all steering wheel injuries for the unbelted driver and probably 80-90% for the belted driver are</page><page sequence="23">HUMAN IMPACT TOLERANCE 1397 rim injuries (282, 308), rather than being caused by contact with the hub. Only limited attention has been addressed to the problem of wheel hub impact, and to date only one has been fully published. Moreland (309) statically loaded two 70-year-old cadavers, utilizing 2 and 4 in. diameter rams. Patrick (310-312) subjected nine aged cadavers to multiple chest impacts. In these tests, 1 in. ensolite padding was used in the hub, and end point for all cadaver tests was determined by rib fracture (deflection of loading curve). As a result of these tests Patrick recommended that the steering wheel hub should be at least 6 in. in diameter, with a 4-in. diameter abso- lute minimum, with hub edges rolled to prevent dangerous load concentrations. In his cadaver studies he found that frac- tures from local forces at edges of hub occurred at 900-1000 lb, and estimated that hub load limits should not exceed 1200- 1400 lb (Table 6). Since tests on aged cadavers, particularly static tests, cannot represent the functional living system, the value of these find- ings must be verified with data from humans at tolerable levels, and from living sub-human primates at injurious and lethal levels. However, Patrick's estimates are probably con- servative in view of more recent reports (5, 304, 313), and un- published experimental tests of hogs and the chimpanzee by Snyder and Young (314). In these studies, involving both human drivers in automotive accidents and animals impacted into steering assemblies, fatal or severe cardiovascular of pul- monary trauma was found prior to rib fracture, the criteria used in the cadaver studies. On the other hand, fresh living bone, especially from young adults, does not fracture at as low a force as does aged embalmed cadaver bone. Through modeling techniques based upon data available at that time, Thompson (228) has proposed limits of force ex- erted per unit area on the body as 28-32 psi for onset of shock, and 45-55 psi for 50% mortality (LD^q), for transverse acceler- ations of less than 0.07 sec duration. In this concept, Thomp- son considers magnitude of force, rate of onset, and onset time (rise time) as dependent variables, while impact force per unit area, AV change, and impact pulse time define the toler- ance envelope. It is not known how valid these estimates are nor has a satisfactory technique for measurement been devised. Examination of the data used by Thompson suggests that these data may not be valid in body orientations other than ± Gx (rearward or forward inertial forces) since data were extrapolated only from transverse studies. Recent tests by Beckman indicate that 200-500 psi for a time duration of 0.07 sec or less is survivable by the rhesus monkey (315). GM Corp. has developed a thin sheet of pressure-sensitive/high- porosity metal foam (metNet) which responds to a localized impact by crushing to a depth that is related to the maximum pressure exerted on it. Such tools may be extremely useful, but since this tool is not available for use by other researchers its reproducibility and validity remain questionable (316). Even in impact tests conducted under the most rigid condi- tions chest accelerations, as measured by triaxial accelerom- eters mounted over the subject's sternum, have not been en- tirely satisfactory, due to motion between the device and the body. Such devices have not been implanted rigidly to the body structure. In an attempt to determine whether the human body can be treated as a 1-deg-of-freedom, linear, un- damped spring-mass system for modeling purposes, an analysis of dynamic response was conducted to validate such a model. Analysis of 29 human impact tests selected from 900 tests conducted indicated that for the Gx transverse body orienta- tion to resultant inertial forces the natural frequency of the response measured by sternum accelerometers varies inversely as the duration of the onset of the input deceleration. The value of the product of response frequency (Hz) and onset duration (sec) is approximately 0.5 (317). Error in measure- ment of chest loads is also a problem in the use of anthropo- morphic dummies. A study by Kroell, et al. (310), compared chest decelerations, in which the true chest-impact force was registered by a chest load-cell, with a corresponding force com- puted from measurement of acceleration within the chest cavity of the dummy and an assumed effective upper body weight of 55% of the total body weight. For the type of dummy used, the computed force erred by about 300%. Fractures of the shoulder girdle (scapula-coracoid, acromion, and coracoacromial ligament) have been found to occur at 170, 170, and 200 lb, respectively, in the dry state, and at about 210, 210, and 240 lb in the fresh cadaver.

Toler- ance for the axillary area was found to be about 2000 lb (318). Static and dynamic stiffness characteristics of the thorax have had limited investigation. Force-deflection curves from static cadaver tests in loads applied over the sternum through a 25-30 sq in. padded surface were reportedly linear for loads up to 180 lb with a 1-in. chest deflection. In dynamic loading at velocities between 16.5 and 22.5 mph forces over 2500 lb for a 3-in. chest deflection were found. In two cases the dy- namic force-deflection relationship was linear with a slope of about 1000 lb/in. up to 900 lb, where rib or sternal injury occurred (310, 311). Load-deflection testing of embalmed and unembalmed male cadavers, impacted with a 3.33 lb, 1-sq in. device dropped from various heights to contact the third, fourth, or fifth rib 2-1/2 in. lateral to the mid-sternal line, are reported elsewhere (98). Under these conditions, unembalmed rib tolerance is reported to be 180 lb load tolerance and 2-in deflec- tion tolerance (criteria for "tolerance" being rib fracture). Note that the seven cadavers used averaged 73 years of age at death. Human cadaver chest deflections of 3.2 in. have been experimentally reported with a maximum force of 2950 lb recorded in one instance (310, 311), and the load data not obtained in the other (98). In both instances extensive rib fractures occurred. In one study (98) a 2.8 in. deflection (at 655 lb) apparently was sustained without rib fracture. Preliminary static tests on young male subjects reportedly were tolerated at a maximum voluntary force of 400 lb in one test (311), although the degree of muscle tensing was not measured. As a further step, since human voluntary tests may terminate far below the injury threshold, and cadaver tests correlate well with skeletal trauma but can- not provide meaningful functional nor soft tissue and organ information, analysis of cardiothoracic injury mechanisms have been evaluated in living subhuman primates. Beck- man and Palmer have studied force-deflection characteristics, both in experiments in which impactor mass has been held constant and velocity increased incrementally (134-136), and in which impactor mass has varied (from 14.7 lb), and velocity has been increased (319). These tests have indicated that the phase of the respiratory cycle, at least for the rhesus monkey (which has a different glottis from the human), does not in- fluence displacement. Peak forces of 130-700 lb at 36-90 fps velocity resulted in somewhat differing force-deflection curves, with a double peak typical for velocities of 60-90 fps (319, 320). From these tests they suggest that a model of force generated on dynamic deflection of the anterior chest wall may have components due to: 1 . The spring-mass effect of the anterior chest wall. 2. The compression of air in the lungs. 3. The viscous or viscoelastic behavior of the thoracic tissue. The mass component attributed to the anterior chest wall may be predicted to be an initial positive impulse followed by an equal negative impulse. Shape and size of the positive impulse may depend upon factors of effective chest wall mass, its dis- tribution, and the impactor mass and initial velocity. A sec- ond peak in the force-deflection curve at higher velocities in- dicates that the heart mass may contribute to the total force curve (320). Recently an electromagnetic instrument, utilizing two inductively coupled coils, has been devised for measure- ment of human thorax thickness during impact, reportedly accurate to within 0.020 in. (321). Experimental subhuman force-deflection and compliance tests may be anticipated to provide major advances in our knowledge of the mechanisms of thoracic injury in blunt impact. However, problems of scaling and extrapolation to the human remain to be solved. Experimental chest impact in primates has produced marked electrocardiographic and pathological changes. Typical ECG changes following impact include alterations in the S-T seg- ment, T-wave electrical axis, and heart rate. Changes often ob- served during the first hour post-impact include bradycardia, rhythmic changes, lengthening of ORS complex, and an S-T segment shift (322). Extensive pathologic changes contribut- ing to death included laceration or rupture of a heart chamber wall, with survivors showing upon subsequent autopsy focal hemorrhage and necrosis of the ventricular surface and myo- cardium, but without damage to the major vessels reported (322). In an unpublished study recently conducted by Snyder and Young (314) with animal subjects, microhemorrhages of the myocardium in four of five cases were found; in lateral baboon impacts on the Daisy Decelerator the finding of frag- mentation of myocardial fibers has also been reported (4). Alterations in serum enzyme determinations, a good clinical indicator of traumatic heart injury, and in chemical consti- tuents of the blood, have been reported in both animal (4, 133, 296, 322, 323, 325), and human impact studies (10, 326, 327). Lung injury may lead to insufficient oxygenation of the brain and result in brain damage, and, conversely, brain injury may lead to secondary lung damage through centrogenic con- vulsive mechanisms or other CNS responses. The relationships and mechanisms involved are often overlooked and not clearly understood (265, 266, 296, 329). Significant advances in this area are necessary to fully evaluate the consequences of tho- racic impact in the living human. Such studies also vividly illustrate the fallacy of considering structural rib failure on cadavers as sole criteria for thoracic impact tolerances. It is probable that functional alterations as a result of impact force will be found to be the determining criteria in man's limita- tions to impact force. Problems of determining human thoracic impact tolerance for the vehicle driver are also complicated by other factors which may well influence the result. Armstrong, et al. (330), have found that voluntary tensing of leg muscles prior to im- pact of human subjects in sled tests could support loads as high as 822.2 lb, and sustain as much as 55% of the total body load, with the remainder against restraining straps. Also to be considered are: How much force are the arms exerting on the wheel in "bracing" for an impact; unrestrained ver- sus restrained kinetics; position of the occupant's body in relation to the wheel, seat location, seat angle, and rim angle; distance between occupant and steering wheel rim; forward</page><page sequence="25">HUMAN IMPACT TOLERANCE 1 399 impact versus angular impacts. Each of these physical vari- ables will also vary with the physical configuration, age, sex, and physical condition of the occupant. Table A-3 lists criteria felt to represent the best available cur- rent human tolerance limits for thoracic impact. For engineer- ing design, available data suggest that human tolerance may be increased by distributing any impact loading over as large an area as possible, to attenuate the loading through energy- absorbing materials to reduce the initial spike of the accelera- tion pulse, minimizing onset rate, and to spread out the time duration of impact. Problems and applications of human tolerance data for the thoracic area may be quite diverse. For example, in the im- plantation of radioactive materials in cardiac patients, it is necessary to know how strong to design the container so that in the most extreme automobile accident no radioactivity is released. Based upon the most extreme barrier crashes for the left-front lap-belt restrained and instrumented dummy, chest levels of 125 G, at 12,500 G/sec onset rate, for 0.001-0.008 sec, have been recorded. Estimation of extreme forces beyond that considered survivable is mainly known from calculations of human free-fall cases. ABDOMINAL IMPACT - Blunt impact trauma to the ab- dominal region of the body has received little experimental study. While the clinical literature contains numerous descrip- tions, diagnoses, and treatment of blunt impact injuries, mech- anisms theorized for such trauma have not yet been supported by adequate objective measurement and valid evidence. There is marked disagreement between medical investigators both as to the frequency with which various abdominal organs are in- volved, as well as the significance of the trauma. Bierman found liver injury most important (6), while Baxter and Williams (339) rank in frequency the kidney, spleen, liver, and pancreas, varying from other authors' estimates (340, 341), and more recently Frey has found that the spleen, liver, kid- neys, pancreas, and intestines (342) rank as most frequently involved. There are valid reasons for such differences, how- ever, since they may reflect not only different experience and diagnostic practice, but criteria upon which such comparisons are based. Anderson, et al., found that injury to the spleen must always be suspected if the automotive occupant has re- ceived a blow to the left side of the trunk. Other considera- tions influencing degree and extent of trauma are whether or not the bladder is full, and whether the stomach is full or empty. From experimental studies with animals impacted at non- fatal dosages and subsequently humanely sacrificed post-im- pact and subjected to careful gross and histopathological autopsy, it has been found that reversible injuries to the ab- domen do occur which would probably not be diagnosed clinically, nor discovered without exploratory surgery (4). Isolated clinical reports of exploratory surgery seem also to indicate that a great deal of abdominal injury may go unde- tected unless the patient's complaints or symptoms are ob- vious and can be diagnosed. Blunt abdominal injuries in chil- dren are especially difficult to diagnose (344). In at least one case where the investigator accidentally exposed himself to ex- cessive loadings in controlled laboratory impact tests, and sub- sequently had exploratory operations for complaints which could not be diagnosed, injuries have been found. Swearingen, after multiple exposures to headward vertical + Gz voluntary impact drop tests seated in a rigid seat, at up to 230 G, at 10,000 G/sec onset rate for 0.01 sec (75), subsequently under- went an exploratory operation three years later and was found to have multiple adhesions of the abdominal mesenteries. In recent papers discussing blunt abdominal impact trauma, Roberts (345) and Mertz and Kroell (346) have evaluated several experimental animal studies in detail and these will only briefly be noted here. Anterior-posterior and flank im- pacts at 200-300 ft-lb at impact were administered to 80 dogs restrained in a sitting position by Baxter and Williams (339), and flank blows were reported to produce a fivefold increase in liver injury and twofold increase in kidney injury over blows directed in the anterior-posterior body position. Twenty-three supine dogs, impacted with a hammer delivering 120-239 lb at 8.5 fps velocity, produced lateral compression of the dogs, bodies from 50-70%, while 290-580 lb at 14.4 fps velocity re- sulted in compression of 70-80% (347). In a study of 45 dogs, impacted anterior-posteriorly with a 400 ft-lb dose, compres- sion was reported to extend to 2.54 in. from the posterior surface. The authors concluded that pressure played little part in intestinal injury; such injury, as well as mesenteric tears, being caused by compression with tearing between two oppos- ing surfaces such as the abdominal wall and spine (348). Kennedy, however, had pointed out that gas and fluid in the GI tract, particularly in the ileum, make it vulnerable to rup- ture from pressure (340). Experimental blunt impact to the abdomen of hogs to study the resulting trauma has been a technique used in several re- search investigations. Windquist, et al., (349) ran 19 decelera- tion tests on a monorail decelerator at Edwards AFB in 1953 to test restraint protection, and in a second series of tests im- pacted the animal against impingement blocks to study thor- acic and abdominal injury. One impact to the lower abdomen, at 39.6 fps velocity, a peak impact force of 5080 lb, and 80 G measured at the animal's back, was fatal, with multiple internal injuries. In a second animal, a blow at 23.6 fps velocity, 2365 lb force, and at 30 G was also fatal. Lower abdominal loading through a 3-in. abdominal belt was judged survivable at 19.3 fps impact velocity through a 750 lb (loop load) force with injuries, while a similar deceleration at 44.2 fps and 4700 lb force was fatal. They concluded that a hog could survive 175 G impact if restrained by shoulder harness and lap belt. More recently five hogs and one 124-lb chimpanzee were used as subjects in Hyge sled impacts by Snyder and Young (350). Tests at 30 mph impact velocities were conducted, with various configurations of steering wheels being impacted while the subject was seated in an automotive body test buck mounted on the decelerator. Sled deceleration of 30 G oc- curred over a time duration of 0.024-0.035 sec, and a maxi- mum chest load of 2800 lb for 0.078 sec to 1 1 10 lb for 0.092 sec was measured. These impacts were all fatal to hog subjects, but a 30 G impact with a measured chest load of 1320 lb during 0.087 sec was survived with no gross injury by the</page><page sequence="26">1400 R.G.SNYDER chimpanzee subject. Abdominal impact into the lower rim of the steering wheel was found to result in measured loads of 410 lb (at 0.063 sec) to 950 lb (at 0.068 sec), and belt loads over the abdomen ranging from 2020-6560 lb (at 0.074 sec). The chimpanzee subject tolerated an abdominal belt load of 3060 lb (0.074-0.077 sec). Histopathology, after this animal was sacrificed, revealed nonspecific acute hyperemia (excess blood congestion) in liver, spleen, heart, and kidney sections (350). In another recent study in Sweden, Thorson, et al., (351) used hogs in drop tests against simulated handlebars to study abdominal trauma in children's bicycle accidents. In tests re- ported to date, these authors found that distributing impact loads to reduce injury for those parts of the body where large displacement occurs was not effective. Liver ruptures occurred in both impacts against the blunt simulated handlebar, and when the animal was dropped against a sphere modification. The ruptures caused by the sphere were all distant from the site of the impact "... and seemed to be the result of displace- ment of the organ whereby the falciform ligament was torn and in three cases the inferior vena cavai vein was opened just below the diaphragm" (351 , p. 2). To date, insufficient data are provided to make further comment. Other tests resulting in abdominal impact data have been conducted with hogs by Stapp (361) and Brock (352). Ab- dominal impacts to squirrel monkeys, rhesus monkeys, and baboons have been conducted by Life and Pince in a series of subhuman primate studies (14, 132, 133). A summary of the injuries produced to abdominal organs as a result of blunt impact has been provided by Frey (342), and illustrations of tensile, compressive, and shearing stresses and strains arising from bldws to the body have been published by Evans and Patrick (353). LOWER EXTREMITIES - Impact injuries to the legs are relatively common in automobile accidents, being involved in half of all accidents in the United States in which injury was reported to occur (354). Such injuries are usually not fatal unless a large amount of blood loss occurs; however, they sub- sequently may be debilitating to the individual involved. In a small number of instances fatality might be attributed to leg injuries preventing evacuation from hostile environments, such as fire or submersion in water, especially where impingement of the legs is caused by intrusion or structural collapse. Few studies, all on cadaver specimens, have been conducted with lower limbs. Human tolerance to impact of the upper leg (femur) has been reported by Mather (94) for 44 pairs of unembalmed femurs. In static bending tests the mean energy required to fail specimens was 20-50 ft-lb, while impact load- ing velocity of 32 fps produced failure at 31-33 ft-lb. Unfor- tunately these measurements cannot be directly related to maximum load without additional information. The impact energy-absorbing capacity of femurs dynamically tested was reported to be affected by variations in its cross section, but was not found to be affected by variation in either values of the matrix orage of the subject. This is unexpected, and in contrast to static tests of the femur where load bearing capac- ity decreases with increasing age of the subject (72, 94, 355). Only four studies (all unpublished) are known relative to tol- erance of the lower leg to impact. A study by Snyder (90) was intended to explore techniques and determine crash loads on the backs of aircraft seats caused by the legs of passengers striking the seat ahead, and utilizing the FAA bungee deceler- ator. Four embalmed male cadaver legs were tested, fracture of the tibia occurring at about 1000 lb peak load for each leg. Young (91) followed these preliminary tests with 12 more tests of embalmed cadaver legs on the FAA decelerator. In both of these studies the mounted leg pivoted around the knee joint axis to swing forward through approximately 60 deg of arc to impact a steel bar during impact, strikes occur- ring 3-6 in. above the ankle joint. Maximum peak loads ranged from 1050-2000 lb (approximate mean value 1481 lb). It was noted that the relatively low compression characteristics of tibial bone under loading will offer high resistance until un- loading (fracture) occurs. Recordings on each leg impact indi- cated a very fast rise in time to peak loading (high resistance) since there is a minimum of soft tissue covering the hard an- terior surface of the tibial bone. There is a slower decay time of unloading (decreasing resistance) following fracture. In some cases a second peak loading occurred, due to secondary fracture or subsequent fibular fracture. The males in this study ranged from 29-57 years of age. Frank, at the Univer- sity of Oklahoma, also using the FAA decelerator, has im- pacted freshly amputated human legs (92). He was unable to fracture (at 3000 lb loads) fresh teenager legs at loadings which previously fractured embalmed or older fresh cadaver legs, thus the above figures should be viewed as conservative. The most extensive study (also unpublished) to date of lower leg impact has also been conducted by Mather (93) using 318 fresh cadaver legs subjected to different energy levels de- livered at a velocity of 13.84 fps. A 9.2 lb weight was dropped vertically, striking midway between the ankle and knee. In no case were both limbs of an individual tested with the same load. Load levels resulted in fracture of the anterior lower leg bone (tibia) which in 5%, and 50%, and 95% of the population were calculated by probit analysis, and were respectively 25.4, 55.3, and 85.1 ft-lb. The tibia of both females and older per- sons required smaller loads to fracture than males or younger individuals. Again, the measures used are noncomparable with other studies, yet it may be some time before any investigator is able to study this large a sample. The mechanism of knee- hip instrument panel injuries has been known for nearly a quarter-century. Urist (184) identified in a study of jeep ac- cidents the acute flexion of the hips, forcing the head of the femur toward rearward dislocation as the knee impacted the panel. Dye, in 1957, found in dummy tests that a 180 lb man in a 10 mph impact, with 1 in. of instrument panel deforma- tion, could receive 800 lb force on the knees. Fractures of the femoral neck have rarely been reported in accidents (66). Of five femurs tested in vertical compression, failure (fracture) occurred in four instances through the neck of the femur at an average of 1990 lb, the fifth failing through the shaft at 2390 lb (120). In static tests of the femur, trans- verse failures at the neck occurred at energy levels of 33.3 and 30.7 ft-lb (356). More recently, Patrick, et al., (97) tested ten</page><page sequence="27">HUMAN IMPACT TOLERANCE 1401 cadavers, concluding that for knee impacts against a moder- ately padded surface it is not possible to predict whether fail- ure of the patella, femur, or pelvis, will occur first, although they found femoral fractures occurred most frequently. Fe- moral fractures occurred in 9 of 20 legs from 950 lb (inspected bone defect) to 2400 lb; however, no fractures occurred in tests of 1500-3850 lb. Human volunteers tolerated 800-1050 lb with only minor pain reported in the knee. Four fractures to the patella (knee bone) resulted from impacts at 1500-3850 lb, but a number of impacts exceeding 2000 lb, and as high as 2650 lb, in one case, did not result in fracture. As a result of these tests Patrick, et al., (311) recommended a force of 1400 lb as a conservative value for knee-femur-pelvis threshold in- jury. Note that "injury" is defined in these studies as hard tissue structural failure, and that other potentially debilitating injury to the cartilages, ligaments, or muscles, was not con- sidered. Citing a European clinical study which indicated that 28% of occupant injuries there involved knee impacts, Cooke and Nagel dropped weights on 42 bovine "knees," 29 em- balmed cadaver knees, and 27 unembalmed knees (95). Bo- vine tests produced no damage at 600 ft-lb energy, articular cartilage damage at 750-ft-lb, simple fractures of the patella and femoral condyles at 1000 ft-lb, and compound com- minuted fractures at 1500 ft-lb. For the range of energies examined (225-600 ft-lb at 25-53 fps impact velocities) no fractures resulted at peak forces below 1600-2000 lb (depend- ing on the direction of impact). The findings of Cooke and Nagel indicate that energy-absorbing devices designed to pro- tect against fractures or ligament tears should be able to ab- sorb a 300 ft-lb impact without generating peak forces in ex- cess of approximately 1700 lb, and a 600 ft-lb impact with peak forces below about 1000 lb (95). WHOLE BODY IMPACT TOLERANCES Impact tolerances of man have been studied primarily in aviation or aerospace medical impact research in relation to whole body tolerance and as a function of body orientation and protective restraint devices. Many of the restraint systems employed have been of a nature far beyond those presently practical for use in automotive vehicles. Thus in considering the results of such studies particular attention must be paid to the restraint system used. Similarly, the fact that only young males in select physical condition are involved- either in test- ing or in application- means that such tolerances may be con- sidered high for the general population, including women, children, the physically unfit, and the aged. Human tolerance criteria have been found to be largely physiologically determined. Most data related to the human have been obtained at impact levels at or below voluntary tol- erance. Very limited data, generally accidentally obtained, are presently available at higher injury levels on man. Most esti- mates of lethal impact ranges are as a result of extrapolation from animal studies. A large number of environmental factors directly influence physiological responses, including body ori- entation, direction of application of force, magnitude, dura- tion, and rate of application of the acceleration. In addition, supporting structures and restraint play a major role in varia- tion. For a detailed summary of the results of experimental tests with both animals and human subjects, refer to Tables A-l- A-9in the Appendix. Fig. 13 shows a comparison of ac- celeration pulses measured in typical automotive test impact environments. FORWARD-FACING BODY ORIENTATION (-Gx) - Im- pact information, both experimental and clinical, is best known for the forward-facing collision environment. Whole body impact tolerance limits for man are approximately 50 G peaks at 500 G/sec rate of onset for 0.25 sec duration, pro- vided adequate upper torso restraint is provided (357). Hu- man volunteers show the most severe transient physiological effects when subjected to a change of deceleration of 1 .370 G/ sec and a peak acceleration of 38.6 G (358). However, changes in the rate of onset have been found to have direct ef- fects upon human response for various impulse durations (1,3, 9, 56, 73, 74, 357-361). Air Force design recommendations are given as approximately 45 G for a duration of 0.1 sec, or 25 G for a duration of 0.2 sec (362). However, restraint in the experiments establishing these limits was by means of a double 3 -in. wide shoulder harness, and a seat belt with thigh straps. Peak acceleration of approximately 45 G (0.09 sec duration) with a rate of onset of 500 G/sec resulted in no signs of shock, yet 38 G for 0.16 sec at higher than 1300 G/sec rate of onset was found to produce signs of severe shock (73, 363), and 45 G (for 0.23 sec) at 413 G/sec produced severe delayed effects (73, run no. 21.5). Rate of onset has been established as a primary limitation and appears to influence clinical shock directly following im- pact (10, 361). The mechanisms of this physiological shock are not yet understood. Post-impact bradycardia, or slowing of the heart rate below 60 beats/min, has been well docu- mented (6, 31, 73, 161, 331-333, 337, 355), and has been ex- perimentally produced in baboon fetuses (334, 335). Mild bradycardia is produced at 15 G impact in the forward-facing position (~GX), but is not as marked in the rearward-facing (+GX) position. Increasing levels of impact increase both the severity and duration of bradycardia up to voluntary human limits tested of 30 G (10). When forward flexion was pre- vented by lap-belt single-shoulder belt combination, maternal bradycardia in pregnant baboons did not occur in either ±GX rearward or forward-facing impact at 20 G and 40 G, although post-impact bradycardia was recorded in the fetuses (334, 335). It is hypothesized that gradients in hydrostatic pressure within the vascular system produced by impact stimulate the sino-aortic baroreceptors which initiate the cardio-inhibitory response (56, 337). Stretch receptors in the lung can initiate reflex cardiac slowing. During headward deceleration (~GZ), stretching (distortion) of the lung can occur which initiates the cardio-inhibitory reflex. Because impact duration is brief, vascular fluid shifts are an unlikely source of stimulation to cardio-inhibitory reflex areas. The inertial effects of a head- ward deceleration (-Gz) could produce a transient increase in the hydrostatic pressure sensed by the baroreceptors, which in</page><page sequence="28">1402 R. G. SNYDER turn respond to this pressure increase by reflex slowing to the heart rate (337). Pre -impact treatment with 1 .6 mg atropine prevented bradycardia, indicating that the effect was related to activity of the vagus nerve (336). Little information is docu- mented relative to the influence of impact orientation and magnitude on the occurrence of post-impact heart slowing. Brown, et al., (337) found that bradycardia post-impact is a function of the acceleration profile and the subject orienta- tion. In impact pulses of less than 50 ms, or less than 15 G, the cardio-inhibitory reflex resulting in slowing of the heart rate apparently does not occur. In the most extreme primate impact tests to date a chim- panzee, exposed to 247 G at 16,800 G/sec for 0.35 sec dura- tion, survived with "moderate" injuries a rocket sled decelera- tion in the (+GX) rearward-facing position, while another chimpanzee died after 4 hr in extreme shock with multiple hemorrhages of the heart and lungs in a (~GX) forward-facing impact at 233 G at 1 1 ,250 G/sec and 0.35 sec. duration (364). At low G forces (7.21-15.46 G) tachycardia, or speeding up of the heart rate, has been reported in experimental steer- ing wheel impacts with human volunteers (78). Experimen- tally, rabbits, beagle dogs, and macaque monkeys show tachy- cardia when exposed to a -Gz trapezoidal deceleration of 20 G magnitude with a peak impact plateau lasting 15-20 ms (283). Pre-impact administration of propanolol, a ß adrenergic block- ade, prevents tachycardia (248). A carotid sinus reflex induced by sustained pressure rise in the carotid arteries was subjectively observed following ex- posure to forward-facing (~GX) impact of 600 G/sec to a pla- teau of 15 G sustained for 0.60 sec (364). The cardiovascular shock effect, characterized by pallor, sweating, drop in blood pressure, and rise in pulse rate, is related to rates of change of acceleration that correspond to dynamic loading rates for whole body resonance, as indicated by overshooting body ac- celeration peaks compared to those measured on the seat or vehicle. Where the impact lasts longer than half a period of the resonant frequency, transient cardiovascular shock signs have been observed in subjects sustaining 30 G peaks of ac- celerative force applied either (+GX) front-to-back or back-to- front. In cases where force is applied for durations correspond- ing to less than half the period of resonant frequency, giving a higher dynamic response, a lower applied peak G will result in higher overshooting peak G measured on the body, followed by rapid decline or rebound. Mild transient shock has been observed at less than 25 G peaks where duration was less than 0.1 sec. Severe shock has resulted from exposure to 38.6 G at 1370 G/sec onset rate for 0.12 sec total duration (8-9 Hz resonant frequency) (364). A 40 G peak at 331 G/sec onset rate and 0.32 duration (wearing upper torso restraint) can be toler- ated with no indication of cardiovascular shock, and further in- creases in time duration reportedly will not affect response (365). Vertebral fractures have been reported at 16.19 +GZ, and others at 39.8, 38.6, and 31 .8, G in the forward-facing position.

Current tests in the forward-facing (-Gx) body orientation with lap-belt restraint are being con- ducted with human volunteers at 1 5 G on the Daisy Decelera- to (280). Injuries are attributed to the restraint system itself and have been discussed elsewhere in relation to experimental and clinical findings related to automotive seat-belt trauma (4, 366, 362). Data from current tests in progress jointly by the National Highway Safety Bureau and the USAF 6571st Aeromedicai Research Lab. are not yet available, but baboon tests con- ducted to date indicate that impacts of 120 G magnitude can be survived when protected by either both a lap-belt and air- bag restraint, or an airbag restraint with no lap belt, in the for- ward-facing simulated collision. Recent publications by Stapp have discussed human voluntary tolerance levels in greater de- tail (368-372), and showed the effect of position, seat belts, and orientation on man (373). Stapp believes that ". . . protec- tion of human occupants of motor vehicles should be feasible up to 40 G at 1000 G per second onset in collisions and roll- over accidents" (363, 370) (Fig. 14). REARWARD-FACING BODY ORIENTATION (+GX) - Rearward-facing orientation to impact has been shown to be the most survivable of the major axis orientations when the body and head have been fully supported, mainly because the load is evenly distributed over a much greater surface, thus re- sulting in less load per unit area. Impact has been survived with reversible injuries at a level of 82.6 G at 3826 G/sec for 0.04 sec duration. The accepted Air Force design limit falls between this and the 45 G for 0.1 sec endpoint for eyeballs out impact (362). Stapp (73, 374) has reported human +GX rearward-facing tolerance as 30 G for 0.1 1 sec duration when calculated rate of onset is 1065 G/sec. For nonreversible injury, chimpanzee tests, backed by free- fall data of humans, indicate that survival limits may be less than 237 G at 1 1 ,250 G/sec for 0.35 sec duration in the for- ward-facing (~GX) body orientation restrained by full body harness, and about 247 G at 16,800 G/sec over 0.35 sec dura- tion (364). Persistent injury was found above 5000 G/sec rate of onset in the -Gx direction (375). In +GX restrained rearward-facing impact levels up to 25 G no significant impairment of pulmonary function has been found to occur (307). But at 30 G peak and 100 G/sec un- pleasant pressure sensations, pallor, drop in blood pressure, in- creased pulse rate, and occasional venous spasms of retinas re- portedly result. These transient changes occur in the absence of mechanical failure or tearing of tissues and organs and with- out bone fracture at this level of force. The most severe shock observed in human testing occurred by error in a rearward-facing (+GX) impact of 82.6 G at 3826 G/sec measured on the sternum of Capt. Eli Beeding, or 40.4 measured on the sled at 2139 G/sec for 0.040 sec duration Fig. 14 - Impact experiences from number of sources have been combined to show approximate values found, to date. Note that many biophysical factors influence survival and approximate survival limit represents only an estimate. Experi- mental results have not been included (155, 242, 334)</page><page sequence="30">1404 R. G. SNYDER (12-14 Hz resonant frequency). In this case, there was no blood pressure for 30 sec post-impact, returning to 70 systolic and 40 diastolic within 5 min. After complaining of severe lower back pain, Capt. Beeding then lost consciousness 10 sec post-impact. He was hospitalized three days to recover from headache and back pain (364). In comparison, a 150 lb black bear impacted at 39 G peak for 0.044 sec duration at 1779 G/sec rate had an elastic re- sponse of 3021 G/sec and 73.1 G at the sternum. Autopsy of this animal revealed multiple areas of congestion, and hemor- rhage about the ligaments and attachments of stomach, liver, and diaphragm (74). LATERAL BODY ORIENTATION (±Gy) - Side-impact or lateral (±Gy) impact tolerances appear to be considerably lower than in either transverse (±GX) or footward (±GZ) body orientations, with a maximum of 14.1 peak sled G at 600 G/ sec for 0.122 sec duration under full body restraint, the volun- tary limit reported to date (278). When the subject is re- strained by either a lap belt only, or lap-belt plus shoulder harness, the voluntary tolerance limit (~Gy) lateral impact has been reported to be only 9 G (average) for a duration of ap- proximately 0.1 sec (376, 377). Tolerance was defined as subject discomfort with prolonged stiffness and soreness in the neck musculature (376). Minor physical complaints, such as muscle stiffness, occurred in approximately 258 G/sec rate on onset for durations of 0.3-0.1 sec (377). Subsequent tests have placed voluntary limits in lateral im- pact with lap-belt restraint only at 9.2 to 10 sled G, or 12-14 G on the chest. At this level anal sphincter pain attributed to vagal effect and acute dilation of the sphincter has been ob- served. Two episodes of fainting in shock response have oc- curred, with bradycardia but no nonreversible physiological effects (278). Under conditions of full body restraint in theoretical body orientation, 33.6 G was measured at the sternum at 600 G/sec with maximum of 14.1 peak sled G re- corded for this full body restraint series (379). Few right (+Gy) tests have been done, but in this orientation (with full Mercury body restraint) the subjective level was above 21.5 (sled) maximum for 1 190 G/sec and 0.121 sec (35 5), and with the Apollo restraint system 1 8.7 G (sled) was tolerated with no complaints (333). Rhesus monkeys subjected to repeated ±Gy lateral impact while encased in half-body mold restraint showed abnormal heart alterations, with left -Gy lateral impact, probably due to asymmetry of body organs, producing twice the number of ECG abnormalties recorded in right +Gy lateral impact (378). In baboons under lap-belt restraint lethal interstitial and intra- lobular pancreatic hemorrhaging have been reported (4, 366). Further work is in progress at The University of Michigan to determine scalar effects in subhuman primates and to develop an injury tolerance curve for side-impact for the National Highway Safety Bureau. HEADWARD OR FOOTWARD BODY ORIENTATION (+GZ) - Although direct impacts of a headward or footward na- ture are less common in automotive collisions than either transverse (±GY) X or lateral (±G..) loads, historical interest in X y seat ejection in aircraft has contributed to our knowledge. Experimental studies of drop tests, free falls, and seated im- pacts have contributed additional knowledge in this area. In some racing vehicles, in which the driver lies nearly supine, the primary inertial forces in a crash will be +GZ headward in direction. In automotive +GZ impacts, the nature of the seat will greatly influence effects upon the occupant. Fig. 15 sum- marizes nonexperimental impact experience. In tests of 19 to 53-year-old male volunteers, Watts, et al., reported no injury and little discomfort in ejection tests con- ducted at 18-21 G, finding the critical rate of onset to be near 100 G/sec for 0.1 sec, with acceleration beyond 100 G/sec for 0.02 sec excessive (42). However, subsequent tests by the same investigators and others have indicated severe pain in the neck, headaches, back pain, and even vertebral fractures at lower levels (380). In studies on the B-70 Capsule, Headley, et al., (402) found a human voluntary tolerance limit of 24 G peak with 30 ft/sec velocity change at 500 G/sec rate of onset. Swearingen conducted drop tests with the subject seated in a stafoam cushioned chair, finding that 9 G at the shoulder for 0.12-0.065 sec at 250 G/sec was tolerable, while 10 G at the shoulder for 0.057-0.0075 sec at 625 G/sec resulted in severe pain in the chest , spine , head, and stomach, and general severe shock (75). In animal tests a bear has been impacted at 123 peak G for 0.023 sec time duration, resulting in fractures of the 7th and 8th thoracic vertebrae, and other injuries (381). Present level of human tolerance to +GZ headward impact is a pulse of approximately 25 G maintained for approximately 0.1 sec, as specified for aircraft design (362). Downward linear acceleration (~GZ) along the spinal axis has had very limited study. Brain hemorrhages have been re- ported at over 3 G for more than 1 sec duration (36), with a 4 G tolerance at 0.3 sec with 38 fps, 7 G for 0.17 sec at 37 fps, and 10 G at 22 fps (382).

Escape ejection accelerations from high-performance aircraft, as well as crashes, have often resulted in vertebral injury, generally a compression of the an- terior lips of the lumbar or thoracic vertebrae (384-389). This may be due to poor seat pad, seat contour, inadequate re- straint, forced head flexion, poor trunk-thigh angle, or spinal extension or flexion (81 , 385, 404). Approximately 80% of all vertebral injuries occur in the thoracic region. Available literature to 1965 on ejection-related vertebral injuries in air crew together with basic findings and analysis of the ejection environment are contained in a comprehensive study by Hig- gins, et al. (403). Persistent neuralgic and sciatic pains re- sulting from such exposures have also been reported (390, 391). Compressive load analysis of vertebra-disc complexes have demonstrated that the vertebral end-plates are the initial fail- ing structures of the spinal column (128, 392-296). Vertebra of cadavers fail at loads as low as 435 lb (395). Compression fractures of the vertebra have occurred under experimental test conditions. An experimental impact at 16 mph of a B-58 escape capsule dropped at 43.6 G (spinal) measured on the subject resulted in one reported compression fracture of T-3 (380). An ejection seat impact profile of 18.8 peak G for 100 ms with rate of onset of 420 G/sec with body orientation 34 deg back from the vertical axis (+GZ) produced compression frac- tures to the 4th and 5th thoracic vertebrae in one subject, al- though others have been exposed to 26 G and velocity change of 8 m/sec in the +GZ 45 deg orientation under the same con- ditions with complaint of occasional "mild transient pain" over the area of the 2nd to 5th thoracic vertebrae (397). More recently, a human volunteer received a compression fracture of the 7th thoracic vertebra under impact conditions of 16.62 +GZ peak sled G, with an onset rate of 1 160 +G/sec, entrance velocity of 39.8 fps and braking distance of 26.5 in. (389). End-plate and vertebral body injury are much more apt to oc- cur during spiņal axial loading than intervertebral disc disrup- tion (31 , 394^396, 398). Work by Kazarian, et al., (303) has identified the mechanisms of other vertebral body injuries in +GZ vertical impact. There is general agreement that a peak of 20-21 G for a duration of less than 0.1 sec at a rate of onset of 250-300 G/sec is tolerable, if the spine is properly positioned for +GZ impact (42, 385, 399). A thorough review of the bio- mechanical aspects of vertebral injury is found in Henzel (396) and Vulcan (81). A viscoelastic rod model which includes damping has been used to simulate the spinal column mathe- matically (338). Design curves for ejection seat and escape capsule (362) have often neglected the dynamic overshoot of man and have been vague regarding the relationship between rate of onset and duration, especially in the region of short duration (380). For example, whole body decelerations of 50 lb chimpanzees, at -3 Gz using a trapezoidal deceleration profile with a plateau of 50-60 ms duration, resulted in G amplification of 2.0-2.5 times the sled G as detected by a miniature accelerometer mounted on the calvarium (328). To date, few physiological measures have been obtained in ±GZ impacts. Various changes in chemical constituents of the blood as well as adrenal gland activity have been reported to occur as a result of impact (324). Reduction in blood platelets (thrombocyto- penia) after (~GX) forward-facing impact at 20 G (peak sled G) was observed 1 hr post-impact at 400 or 800 G/sec onset rates (337). Sympathoadrenal response to impact was suggested due to changes found in measurement of urinary excretion of vanilmandelic acid (VMA) (326). More precise measurement of norepinephrine, epinephrine, and 17-hydroxy corticosteroid in urine pre- and post-impact showed a definite connection with sympathoadrenal function and emotional stress (327). Five chimpanzees subjected to various forces from 54-180 G produced alterations in serum lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) and LDH isoenzymes from 7-1 1 days post-impact. The changes in isoenzyme pattern after 7 days was attributed to the adapta- tion of the organism to the initial stress and the development of post-impact pathology (323). Immediate and statistically significant alterations in hematologic responses were found in 35 rhesus monkeys subjected to severe abdominal, thoracic, and head impact at 27 average G. These included: failure of clotted blood samples to lyse, indicative of a lack of activation of the fibrinolytic mechanisms; a 35% decrease in leucocytes, indicative of cellular damage and extravasation; decrease of blood hemoglobin with reduced hematocrit levels, indicative of both blood loss and traumatic hemolysis; and increases in acid and alkaline phosphatase enzymes, indicative of soft tissue damage. Bilirubin and calcium levels remained the same; there was a decrease in chloride ion concentration, and substantial increases in blood glucose, creatinine, free plasma hemoglobin, urea nitrogen, and in total protein levels (14). ±Gy lateral im- pacts to rhesus monkeys restrained in contoured half-body molds at up to 76 G, 7269 G/sec onset rate for 0.070 sec pro- duced no characteristic hemogram or serum glutamic-oxalace- tic transaminase changes (378). Post-impact elevation of ionic Fig. 16 - Human tolerance to linear deceleration in seated forward- facing -G orientation. Shown are three different G patterns to ob- tain limit for reversible injury. Limits appear to be predominantly determined by rate of onset (jolt) in A, by magnitude in B, and by duration of impact force in C (1)</page><page sequence="32">1406 R. G. SNYDER calcium, glucose, acid and alkaline phosphates, bilirubin, changes to total plasma protein and hemoglobin, and reduction of red blood cells were observed in paired tests of baboons surviving impacts to 57 peak G (367). No alterations in serum electrolytes were observed in pregnant baboons impacted at 20 G (334). Serum enzyme determinations were shown to be a good clinical indicator of traumatic heart injury. LDH iso- enzyme levels, specific in the faster bands to cardiac muscle damage, were shown to dramatically increase along with the more general indicators of injury, SGOT and total LDH levels, 24 hr after trauma to the chest in the rhesus monkey subjected to -Gx impact (296). Biochemical stress evaluations have only been reported in a few studies during the past six years and relatively little is as yet known about effects upon man's tolerance to impact. Such determinations are expensive to obtain, some tests cost- ing as much as $500 per subject for analysis alone, and while this appears to be a most productive area of investigation, contributions will probably continue to be limited. Fig. 16 provides a summary of human impact tolerance for various body orientations for healthy young males with max- imum values being that level at which nonreversible injury may be expected to occur (1). SUMMARY Today, after some 220 research studies involving man and other mammals have been conducted during the past 25 years, we are beginning to accumulate data at an exponential growth rate. There are now over 6000 references in the literature re- lated to deceleration. Over 5000 tests have now been con- ducted on the Daisy Decelerator alone. Yet, as this overview and assessment of the current state-of-the-art has attempted to show, our sum total of biological knowledge on human tolerance to impact must still be considered very general and fragmentary. Some ballpark human tolerance limits have been established which a healthy young male cannot exceed without the probability of injury or fatal trauma. Even these, however, are greatly dependent upon a number of complex and inter- acting variables, including conditions of restraint, body orien- tation, and certain specified physical parameters (magnitude, time duration, onset rate, distribution of force, etc). These data have been obtained for the most part from animal, cadaver, or free-fall and accident investigations and extrap- olated to estimate and predict the limits beyond which vol- untary tests cannot be conducted. In these endeavors we have drawn upon techniques of mathematical modeling, bio- mechanics, accident investigation and clinical opinions. The current strengths and limitations of these methods in con- tributing to our knowledge have been evaluated in this paper along with problems requiring our attention for solution. The elusive magic "numbers" which the automotive design engineer requires and cherishes do not yet exist in fact. Major reasons are that man is complex and variable, and we obviously are limited in testing him. He comes in assorted shapes and sizes, and age, sex, and health factors play a critical role in his tolerance to impact. That which we have found voluntarily tolerable for the healthy young male, protected by mouthguard, contoured seat, tightened optimal restraint, and under constant medical supervision, is probably going to represent a much greater value than the small child, elderly, obese, or pregnant woman can tolerate. Currently, practically nothing is known about the effects of off-axis impact to the body, as in quartering collisions, or in successive multidirectional impacts, as in roll-overs, or accidents in which rapid changes in direction occur. In fact, for side-impact tolerance only two human studies- with 1 7 subjects protected by optimum Mercury or Apollo restraint systems (and with little application to automotive side impact)- have investigated right lateral impact (+Gy) at even low voluntary levels. Animal studies indicate that there may be a significant difference between the body's injury threshold between left and right impact. With the increasing interest in automotive safety, a major change is occurring in impact studies, in that increasing atten- tion is being paid to regional body tolerances- indeed, most of what we know today relative to regional tolerances has been due to work during the past six years. Concentration on problems of whiplash, head injury, facial, abdominal, and thoracic injury mechanisms and phenomena, is necessary. However, the body does not operate in distinct parts, and studies of whole body impact- the standard aviation medical approach for the past 25 years- have shown that intracellular, neurological, biochemical, physiological, and psychological alterations occur as a result of impact which may not be apparent in studies conducted on cadavers and dummies, with models, or even in regional impact studies. We must pay attention to the consequences of what happens to the cardio- vascular or respiratory system when the head is impacted, or similarly what effect other regional injuries have on the whole system. We may well find in the future that human tolerance limitations are more related to biochemical alterations than to gross structural failure. We are hampered by the lack of standardized techniques and cannot be sure that values ob- tained in one study can be reproduced in another laboratory. Too often studies are noncomparable because of restraint or other experimental design variables, different usage of instru- mentation, different interpretation, or incomplete reporting of results. The sled average G in one study cannot be validly re- lated to the chest peak G given in another under entirely different conditions. We have much to learn. Nevertheless, as the data provided in the research summary tables indicate, we are making large strides in knowledge of human impact tolerances and are identifying and attacking the problems with considerably greater precision than that day in 1928 when Valier's cat was reported to have been "acceler- ated in several directions at once." Impact studies now in progress or planned for the future hold considerable promise for important contributions to our knowledge. REFERENCES 1. J. P.

Some tests have been omitted either be- cause no physical data were reported or data were incomplete at the time of this compilation. For any references given and not cited in the reference section of this paper, refer to the master HSRI impact bibliography. The author would appreciate having any omissions or corrections brought to his attention. Most of the material contained in these tables was obtained during the past ten years in a continuing literature search by the author, sponsored during the period 1961-1966 by a joint effort of the USAF Aerospace Medical Research Lab., Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, the Civil Aeromedicai Research Institute of the FAA, Oklahoma City, and the USAF School of Aerospace Medicine, San Antonio, Texas, funded in part by Air Force Contract D. 0. (330657) 62-382. In nearly all fields of science the exponential growth of publications, in a myriad number of journals, has made it increasingly difficult for the engineer or scientist to keep current in his field. Publication of research results often does not occur until some time, often years, after the work has been done. Furthermore, a considerable amount of the research done to date remains unpublished. Few scientists or engineers have the time or capability to thoroughly search the impact literature, and it has become evident that much valu- able work is becoming "lost" because it was published ob- scurely or in limited distribution. The following tables are designed to provide a quick single-point reference for identify- ing what has been done to date. The original references should be examined for more specific data. For major compendiums or annotated bibliographies on impact see Refs. 242, 334, 405-407.</page><page sequence="48">1422 R. G.
