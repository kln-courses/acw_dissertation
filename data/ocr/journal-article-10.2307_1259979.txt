<plain_text><page sequence="1">Folklore vol.98: ii, 1987 183 Joseph Jacobs: A Sociological Folklorist GARY ALAN FINE IT is now well-established that the late Victorian period in England witnessed a flowering of folklore studies. Surely at no time before or since in the British Isles have so many men and women of such extraordinary talent converged to examine the problems of folklore. Through Richard Dorson's investigations of the intellectual history of this group, most professional folklorists are familiar with the names of Andrew Lang, Edwin Sidney Hartland, Alfred Nutt, George Laurence Gomme, Edward Clodd, William Alexander Clouston, Marian Roalfe Cox, Alice Gomme, James Frazer, Edward Burnett Tylor, Frances Groome, and Joseph Jacobs, to name a few of the many luminaries of the period. Dorson selects six of these scholars, whom he terms the 'Great Team' (Lang, Hartland, Nutt, G.Gomme, Clodd and Clouston), as particularly representative of folklore in this period, and he claims that their 'collective efforts wrote a brilliant chapter in the history of modern thought." Yet, despite their erudition and undeniable flashes of brilliance, the writings of most of these folklorists seem dated when read in the light of current folkloristic theories. However, I claim the work of one of these Victorian folklorists has particular relevance for current scholarship-that of Joseph Jacobs. I shall focus primarily on the theoretical orientation of Jacobs, which is similar to the way in which contemporary folklorists treat their material. I do not contend that Jacobs has directly influenced modern folklore scholarship in the sense of having intellectual heirs, or even that he had in mind the direction that folklore was to travel in the next century. Rather, the points he made were parallel to analyses that other scholars were to propose several decades later. I do not contend that Jacobs caused the direction of contemporary folkloristics, but only that he predated current theories by addressing issues current in his own time. I hope, therefore, to set Jacobs in his own historical context, but also to demonstrate the relevance of his ideas today. Jacobs was not during his lifetime, and is not now, the most prominent or most highly regarded of his colleagues, but he is among the most modern. Despite his reputation as a 'literary' folklorist,2 he was interested in 'sociological' and social structural ideas; for this reason his writings have a claim on the attention of all professional folklorists. Joseph Jacobs was born on August 29, 1854, in Sydney, New South Wales, of Jewish parents. After schooling in Sydney and London, he entered St. John's College, Cambridge, and was awarded the degree of B.A. (senior moralist) in 1876. Published that same year was George Eliot's Daniel Deronda, which foreshadowed the movement for a Jewish Palestine. This novel apparently fired Jacobs' interest in Judaism, and he subsequently left London to study under distinguished Jewish scholars in Berlin. Jacobs' primary fame stems from his large body of research and writing on Jewish subjects. He first attracted public notice for a series of articles published in The Times in January 1882 in which he drew attention to the persecution of the Jews in Russia. This led to the formation of the Russo-Jewish Committee (also known as the Mansion House Committee) in England, which he served as secretary until he emigrated in 1900. During the 1880s Jacobs studied with the prominent statistician Sir Frances Galton,</page><page sequence="2">184 GARY ALAN FINE and subsequently published Studies in Jewish Statistics, Social, Vital and Anthropomorphic (1891), in which he examined the comparative distribution of Jewish abilities and demographic characteristics. At this time he also became interested in anthropological research, leading to a series of articles on biblical archaeology and eventually a book, Studies in Biblical Archaeology (1894). It is not possible to ascertain the date of Jacobs' first interest in folklore studies. In 1888 he published what appears to be his first contribution to folklore scholarship on the diffusion of Jewish folktales, 'Jewish Diffusion of Folk-Tales' in The Jewish Chronicle.3 The article clearly demonstrates his growing interest in matters folkloric. By 1889 he had joined the Folk-Lore Society and that year was elected to its Council. He evidently impressed his folklore colleagues, and the following year he was selected to edit the journal Folk-Lore,which he did until 1893, its period of greatest vitality and importance for decades. In 1893 he resigned this position because of the pressure of work; however, he remained on the editorial board until 1900, when he left England for America.4 Between 1891 through 1894 Jacobs wrote a series of important articles in Folk-Lore, mostly focusing on the issue of diffusion versus independent invention of folklore. Together with Alfred Nutt, he co-edited the collection of papers from the 1891 International Congress on Folk-Lore, held in London under the auspices of the Folk-Lore Society.5 During this period he also compiled most of his children's books, consisting of retellings of English, Celtic, and Indian mdrchen. By 1895 Jacobs' interest in folklore appears to have waned, perhaps because he considered his battle over diffusion versus independent invention to have been won. After 1894 Jacobs contributed only a few book reviews to Folk-Lore, and an obituary of Andrew Lang to the Journal of American Folklore.6 He always had a restless, wide- ranging intellect, and it is characteristic of his intellectual career that he never focused on any topic for an extended period of time. In 1900 Jacobs was invited to come to America as the revising editor of the Jewish Encyclopedia. Although he apparently intended a temporary visit, he remained in New York for the remainder of his life, writing on Jewish history, sociology, and demography. He was appointed professor of English at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in New York, and in 1913 was named editor of The American Hebrew. Jacobs passed away on January 30, 1916. Although my primary focus is on Jacobs' contribution as a folklorist, his most substantial contributions were in Jewish Studies. In addition to writings on Jewish Studies and folklore, he also wrote extensively on English literature, analyzing such authors as Tennyson, Arnold, Thackeray, and Austen. He also completed a novel, As Others Saw Him, an imaginative life of Jesus from a Jewish perspective.7 Richard Dorson speaks of the group of folklorists who consitute the 'Great Team' as 'Victorian evening folklorists'.8 Unlike most of the men central to folklore's development in England in the late Victorian period, but like Andrew Lang, Jacobs during most of the period apparently was a full-time scholar and writer. Until he moved to America, he had no teaching position, and probably lived off his writings. There is little direct evidence about the specific content of the relations between Jacobs and the other members of the folklore circle, but the positions he held in the Folk-Lore Society suggest that he was respected. Alexander Marx, speaking of Jacobs' personality while in New York, commented: I know of no one who was more ready to put the full store of his encyclopedic knowledge at the disposal of anybody who wanted it and who was freer from all egotism and self-consciousness. He was a man of a</page><page sequence="3">JOSEPH JACOBS: A SOCIOLOGICAL FOLKLORIST 185 beautiful, sweet dispositon, of an unusual modesty which never gave the outsider the idea of his eminence in many respects, a staunch friend and one who bore malice to no one, not even if attacked.9 This last trait, if accurate, must have served Jacobs well as he participated in the rough- and-tumble intellectual debates among folklore scholars in the 1890s. Read today these debates, both those written by Jacobs and those written in response to his criticism, strike present readers as filled with vitriol and heavy sarcasm. Although it is difficult to be certain with the passage of time how the comments were intended and received, there is no evidence of a deep personal rupture between Jacobs and his colleagues. The wit of the debate is impressive to anyone familiar with the rather anaemic tone of contemporary academic discourse; thus Jacobs, arguing for diffusion, wrote: The Casual Theory of our worthy opponents assumes the chance medley of clashing incidents coming together, and forming everywhere the same plot...Mr Lang, as an Oxford man, cannot be expected to know anything about the doctrine of probabilities, and that the chances against such an order of incidents occurring twice casually are greater than my bowling out Dr Grace first ball...Mr Hartland one can forgive, for he is a lawyer; but that Mr. Lang, of all persons, should fail to feel that many folk-tales are masterpieces of constructive literary art, surprises me, I must confess.'0 To which Lang replied: Of course people need not read one's writings, but how, if they do read them, they can regard me as a Casualist, or rather as exclusively a Casualist, I fail to understand...That Mr Jacobs should rebuke M.Bedier for being a Casualist, when M. Bedier is rebuking me for the same crime, while neither M. Bedier nor I be Casualists, is-casual...I am naturally grateful to all the distinguished students who have given me such copious opportunities of disavowing heresies which I do not hold. But I would have been still more grateful if they had not, somehow, evolved the myths that I am a Casualist, pur sang, and indifferent to literary merit in mdrchen. The written record provides little support for Maidment's undocumented claim that Jacobs was seen as a 'crank and agent provocateur' and as 'amateur and unscholarly.'l2 These debates, vigorous and multi-sided, were not untypical of the controversies of folklorists of the period, even among members of the 'Great Team.' In the debates there is no hint of anti-semitism directed against Jacobs. From all available evidence he was well-accepted by the British folklorists of his period. Joseph Jacobs' primary folkloristic significance derives from his concern with sociological issues-that is, he wishes to understand the structure of social order and the process by which this order is maintained. He is neither interested in the psychological make-up of tellers nor in the literary make-up of the texts. To demonstrate this interest in sociological concerns I shall discuss five themes of his folkloristic writings: The Significance of Diffusion, The Nature of the Folk-Group, The Individual Origin of Folklore and its Spread Through Group Dynamics, The Systematic Study of Folktale Motifs, and the Effects of Social Structure on Behaviour. Joseph Jacobs' name is inextricably linked in folklore scholarship with the theory that folklore content is spread from society to society, rather than being independently created in each society in which it is found.'3 Jacobs was possibly over-zealous in setting up his opponents (particularly Nutt, Hartland, and Lang) as opponents of the possibility of diffusion, even caricaturing their positions.14 Because of his insistence on finding a diffusion solution to the origin and spread of folktales and fables (his primary genre interests), folklorists became more sensitive to defining the distribution of folklore in terms of diffusion-a perspective that is still dominant in the discipline-and phrased their writings in ways that were more congenial to the diffusionists (Jacobs, Gaster,</page><page sequence="4">186 GARY ALAN FINE Groome, and Newell)."5 Lang is correct in claiming that he himself was never opposed in principle to diffusion and that others misrepresented his ideas, but because of Jacobs' prodding, Lang made certain to describe the relative balance between diffusion and independent invention in such a way as to give a greater emphasis to the former. Jacobs' preoccupation with the explanatory power of diffusion models and his success in proclaiming these views may have had unfortunate latent consequences for folklore. Folklorists now assume that diffusion explains the distribution of all items of folklore. However, a reading of recent archaeological literature16 leads one to the inescapable conclusion that some genres of folk culture (such as games like Parchesi, or festivals such as those celebrating the harvest) probably originated in widely separate locations which had no contact. This does not deny the basic validity of Jacobs' emphasis for most complex folk narratives, but it warns folklorists to remember that both diffusion and independent invention are possible, and that the decision as to whether a particular example of folk culture was originated by the one or by the other process is an empirical question. Although folklorists have discarded the position that there is a single origin point (whether that be India, Egypt, or France) for all folklore (or for particular genres), many cling to the belief that for each example of folklore a single point of origin exists. In emphasizing diffusion, Jacobs (and subsequent folklorists) adopted an essential sociological perspective. The view that similar tales might develop independently postulates a universal psychological make-up among human beings. Folktales for the 'Casualist'7 developed from common reactions to broadly similar environments. Human needs constrain and direct the formation of folklore-a fundamentally psychological approach to understanding creativity. Diffusion theory, particularly as expressed by Jacobs, ignores the question of similar psychological make-up; rather, he searches for points of interpersonal contact or interaction among peoples and nations. This emphasis on understanding the distribution of folklore by understanding patterns of communication and contact is essentially sociological. Jacobs and his fellow diffusionists (notably Groome and Clouston's) suggest ways in which information might be transmitted among peoples, an issue which was later to intrigue Carl Von Sydow. Unfortunately none of these scholars amassed substantial empirical evidence on the dynamics of diffusion, but the right issues were raised.19 Some evidence was compiled on the diffusion of folklore through printed material, a topic of particular interest to Jacobs (and to Clouston).Most notable of Jacobs' essays on the diffusion of printed matter are his lengthy introductions to Aesop's Fables,20 Reynard the Fox,21and Barlaam and Josaphat.22 His emphasis on printed collections of tales and fables seems to have led some to label him as a literary folklorist.23 Yet he was not interested in printed sources as literature (in the sense of caring about their aesthetic value or their position as literature); rather, printed material was an artifact which aided in understanding the paths of diffusion. Although Jacobs did refer to his own love for folktales for their own sake,24 he did not analyze folklore texts as artistic or literary objects, but as sociological ones-artifacts which provide evidence about the structure of the Medieval world-system and the trade routes within it. Jacobs summarised his conclusions from his five-year study of the folktale in his last major folkloric article.25 He argued that resemblances between folktale texts which extend beyond three or four linkages of incidents suggest that the tale spread by means of diffusion, no matter the distance between the points at which they were collected. Further, he believed that widely spread tales probably originated in India, but that these Indian stories represent less than 10% of all European folktales. Although he admits</page><page sequence="5">JOSEPH JACOBS: A SOCIOLOGICAL FOLKLORIST 187 that 'unnatural incidents' in folktales may represent survivals of primitive culture, Jacobs cautions that these survivals can only inform us about the culture of the location in which the folktale originated, since these 'unconventional incidents' can become conventional and can be used without reference to their origin. After several decades in which diffusion research was in vogue and was central to folklore, the questions that Jacobs asked are now unfortunately largely ignored. In part because of the difficulty in obtaining meaningful historical evidence, and in part because of the growth of nationalism in folklore research, issues of diffusion have slipped into the background. Yet the issues that Jacobs raises of origin, spread, and the dynamics of diffusion should continue to be examined seriously by folklorists in order to understand cultural change. A second significant theme in Jacobs' work is the nature of the folk group. Many contemporary folklorists define this as any group that shares at least one trait in common.26 Folklore has been extended to cover all interest groups in modern society. No longer is the concept of the folk restricted to peasant groups or savage tribes. This 'modern' view of folklore is anticipated in Jacobs' essays. In his article 'The Folk' Jacobs indicates that folk groups are segments of societies, and are 'many-headed...and often many-minded.'27 He argues that within any society there are many folks. Folklore is contemporary as well as historical: Survivals are folk-lore, but folk-lore need not be all survivals. We ought to learn valuable hints as to the spread of folk-lore by studying the Folks of today. The music-hall, from this point of view, will have its charm for the folk-lorist, who will there find the Volkslieder of today. The spread of popular sayings, even the rise of new words, provided they be folk-words, should be regarded as a part of the study of folk-lore.28 Jacobs' concern with emphasizing the folk in equal measure with the lore indicates a concern with the contextual aspects of folklore, rather than with the textual approaches common in his time. The article, 'The Folk', strikingly exemplifies the theme picked up much later by Von Sydow and still later by the 'contextual' American folklorists in the late 1960s. As Michael Owen Jones noted,29 the use of the 'folk' concept is a cognitive category in any society-typically used by one group (usually an elite) to characterize another (usually a relatively powerless group). Jacobs recognises both that any group can in theory be a folk, and that in practice only certain groups are accorded that label. Although Jacobs' article is sketchy and has not been widely cited, it does indicate that the idea of contextualism among folklorists runs deep. Thirdly, Jacobs gave more thought than most of his contemporaries to the dynamics of creation and diffusion of folklore. The English folklore circles of the 1890s paid little attention to these processes. Folklore just appeared; few speculated on the immediate circumstance of creation. The implicit theory was that some sort of communal creation was at work; folklore was created by the community. Jacobs pointed out what folklorists today regard as a truism: that folklore items have a single author. Jacobs wrote: Let us try to realise in imagination what must have happened when, for the first time, the saying was uttered that was afterwards to become a proverb, or a tale that was destined to be a folk or fairy-tale, was first told. Was it the Folk that said the one or told the other? Did the collective Folk assembled in folk-moot simultaneously shout, 'When the wine's in, the wit's out,' or 'Penny wise, pound foolish'? No, it was some bucolic wit, already the chartered libertine of his social circle, who first raised hearty guffaws by those homely pieces of wisdom. The proverbial description of a proverb. 'The wisdom of many, the wit of one,' recognises the truth.30</page><page sequence="6">188 GARY ALAN FINE Jacobs sketches the dynamics by which folklore is diffused: creation by the individual artist, acceptance by a social circle, then diffusion to other groups and other societies. This perspective is akin to sociological descriptions of the network of cultural diffusion.3" Jacobs claims that the phrase 'Folk creation' is simply a gloss for our ignorance of creation and diffusion. He throws down the gauntlet, writing: 'Yes, I repeat it, the Folk is a fraud, a delusion, a myth.'32 Thus, it is of little surprise that the Communalist Frances Gummere singles Jacobs out for criticism.33 Jacobs' emphasis on the dynamics of diffusion underlines his interest in the process of transmission: From the new standpoint we shall want to know how it thus spread, and where it took its rise, since from that standpoint it must have originated in one mind in one spot. And when we learn how it spreads in one country, we may get to know how it spreads from one country to another.34 As is too often true of Jacobs's writings, he doesn't provide empirical evidence that would permit readers to understand the how of transmission. References to the effects of books and trade routes, while quite correct (and not unique to Jacobs),35 are facile generalizations-easy to make and difficult to describe in detail. But at least his concern with the social structure of transmission (the process) points to an important direction for research. One of the major themes of folklore scholarship in the nineteenth century was the development of a 'science' of folklore. However, like many other terms, 'science' as used by these folklorists, had an amorphous meaning. When Gomme discussed science, it appears that he meant systematic history;36 when Hartland talked about science, psychological anthropology was at its root. Significantly Jacobs' title for his address to the 1891 International Congress of Folk-Lore was 'The Science of Folk-Tales and the Problem of Diffusion'. By the term 'science' Jacobs meant something quite different from both Gomme and Hartland. For him, 'science' referred to the systematic content analysis of folktales, which examined the paths of diffusion by means of a systematic observation of texts, as did the Finnish historical-geographical method (then in its incubation stages, although there is no evidence that Jacobs had contact with it). The approach is scientific, not in its historical sense, but in the scientific (or, more particularly, social scientific) sense of data collection, systematic coding, hypothesis testing and proof. Jacobs' perspective on science probably derived from his experience working with Galton on statistical issues. This complemented, rather than supplemented, his contextual interests, in that these motifs could serve as a shorthand for examining the questions of process that he was so interested in. Jacobs justified his methods by arguing that the content of a folktale holds the key to its pattern of diffusion: We must be able to draw out this plot, or pattern, in the folk-tale, and for this purpose analyse it into its elements, which are the incidents of the story...The first step is to draw up a list of these incidents, and especially those that are common to several stories...Having got our list and nomenclature of incidents we shall then be able to describe and analyse a folk-tale without having to repeat it. The naturalist who wishes to describe a mammoth does not carry it around with him...So I hope that one day, instead of having to read the tale of 'Lady Featherflight' we may be able to know its content from the lists of its incidents somewhat as follows:- BRIDE WINNING GROUP-Hero prisoner of giant-Bride Wager-Tasks (byre-thatching, seed-divison, sand- rope)-Answering inanimates-Obstacles to pursuit (forest, lake)-Face in pool-Lovers' union. I am not at all unaware that in rendering the story to such a skeleton its charm has for the time vanished, and I am prepared for some of our President's [Andrew Iang] irony on such a scheme. But when one has to study a couple of dozen of stories of the same general character it is almost indispensable that one should have some such</page><page sequence="7">JOSEPH JACOBS: A SOCIOLOGICAL FOLKLORIST 189 curt method of analyzing, so as to be able to run over a large number of stories, picking out the common incidents, and thus arriving, if possible, at the original form in which the story first appeared, and thereby settling the place where the tale was first told.38 Jacobs' list of seven hundred common incidents (Ring stealing trick, Recognition by story telling, Pet animal denies it has eaten) represents an early attempt to systematize the study of folklore. Although Jacobs did not construct the first motif index39 or expand it sufficiently to be useful (as Aarne and Thompson did several decades later), his social scientific bent is notable, particularly when compared to his contemporaries. Jacobs' interest in the relationship between social structure and behaviour is most clearly evident not in his folklore writings, but in his writings on Jewish history,40 although traces of this concern is found in his folklore essays on diffusion as well. He explicitly relates how the behaviour of the Jews is a consequence of the social structure of the age in which they lived. For example, the role of Jews as transmitters of tradition is a result of the peripatetic life that they were forced to lead, which made this diffusion possible and even necessary. This migration was forced upon the Jews by the political establishments in the countries in which they resided. Jacobs is particularly effective in indicating the nature of the socio-political forces which lead nations to expel their Jews, rather than simply attributing expulsion to a rise in prejudice. One of the most cogent discussions by Jacobs on the relationship between behaviour and social structure is his explanation of Jewish usury in England in the twelfth century. During this period Jews could only earn their livelihoods as usurers, and since at any time the King could confiscate the estate of a Jew, the estate was potentially always the property of the crown. Yet Jacobs notes that it was not in the interest of the King to keep the Jews' wealth in his own hands, since he, a Christian, could not gain interest on it, while the Jew could double or triple his investment, since the absence of competition allowed Jews to set very high rates of interest: rarely less than 40% and often as high as 80%. Seen in isolation this fact might appear to support the stereotype of the Jew as stingy and inhumane. Yet this high interest rate, Jacobs suggests, was rational in economic terms. A Jewish loan was something of a gamble for the debtor. The Jew might die before the loan was collected, and the King who then held the contract would be content to receive a considerably smaller settlement. As Jacobs notes: The usury was in the nature of a bet against the Jew's life. The only useful function the Jew could perform toward both king and people was to be as rich as possible, just as the larger the capital of a bank, the more valuable the part it plays in commerce.41 Thus, the social structure in which the Jew resided directed his behaviour (i.e. the form of commerce). Throughout his discussion of the contributions of the Jews to European history,42 Jacobs analyzes the actions of the Jews in the light of their position in the social structure. Although Jacobs does not directly apply this structural determinism to folklore, it is entirely congruent with modern folklore scholarship.43 Jacobs' most controversial and possibly most widely known contribution to folklore is his retelling of fairy stories in books for young readers. During the period in which he was interested in folklore Jacobs compiled six books of fairy stories-English Fairy Tales, More English Fairy Tales, Celtic Fairy Tales, More Celtic Fairy Tales, Indian Fairy Tales, and The Book of Wonder Voyages. Later, in 1916, Jacobs published a seventh volume in America, Europa's Fairy Book. With the exception of Andrew Lang, Jacobs was the</page><page sequence="8">190 GARY ALAN FINE most successful and prolific of the folklore popularizers during the late Victorian period. Yet, this collection of works caused considerable controversy, both at the time44 and later.45 Jacobs freely admitted that he had rewritten his collections of tales (as did Andrew Lang), attempting to justify his decision, pehaps with some defensiveness, against the criticism of Hartland:46 My folk-lore friends look on with sadness while they view me laying profane hands on the sacred text of my originals. I have actually at times introduced or deleted whole incidents, have given another turn to a tale, or finished off one that was incomplete, while I have had no scruple in prosing a ballad or softening down over-abundant dialect. This is rank sacrilege in the eyes of the rigid orthodox in matters folk-lorical. My defence might be that I had a cause at heart as sacred as our science of folk-lore-the filling of our children's imaginations with bright trains of images. But even on the lofty heights of folk-lore science I am not entirely defenceless...Why may I not have the same privilege as any other story-teller, especially when I know the ways of story-telling as she is told in English, at least as well as a Devonshire or Lancashire peasant? And- conclusive argument-wilt thou, oh orthodox brother folk-lorist, still continue to use Grimm and Asbj6rnsen? Well,they did the same as I.47 Jacobs' defence is connected to his theory of folklore diffusion. Since the versions he selected were variants deliberately altered by the storyteller for a particular culture, this is identical to what Jacobs sees himself doing.48 Further, his belief that much folklore has been diffused by means of written literature meant that he was not particularly concerned with the effects of setting these tales in print and with the effects of a 'permanent' record. Evidently Jacobs was defensive about the 'unscientific' alterations in the texts he presents, and he goes to some length to justify or minimize his alterations.49 But was Jacobs really guilty in popularizing folklore? First, note that these books were not, nor were they intended to be, collections of tales aimed at scholars. The tales that Jacobs presents had been in most cases collected and published previously by other scholars, and the serious reader could have access to those sources. Thus, what Jacobs did was considerably different than would have been the case if he had censored or altered texts which he had previously collected, but never published in their unmodified form. Second, texts are rarely (if ever) presented in the form in which they were told."s Most story-telling is filled with false starts, interruptions, parapraxes, explanations, digressions, coughs, grunts, and comments from the collector. Although different folklorists handle speech acts differently (in part as a function of their intended audience and their purpose), it is rare to find an 'accurate' text, with all its 'boring' prolixity or confusing ellipsis. Writers for children and textbook writers (i.e. those writing for the uninitiated) have a particularly difficult time in this regard. Although Groome"5 claimed that Jacobs deviated substantially from his text of his Gypsy tales, for most of the texts Jacobs kept close to the 'originals.' Third, in Jacobs' defence one must note the extensive annotations which accompany his tales. Ironically, these scholarly notes perhaps led some of Jacobs' colleagues to treat the tales as more serious scholarship than they deserved to be, and, thus, led to the conclusion that he was adulterating his texts. This confusion of purpose may be at the root of Jacobs' problem in regard to his fairytale books.The annotations are welcome scholarship, the writing is exciting and strong,52 but the combination with popularized texts proved unfortunate in the rough-and-tumble politics of English folklore circles in the 1890s. Although Joseph Jacobs' death was noted in the popular press and in British and</page><page sequence="9">JOSEPH JACOBS: A SOCIOLOGICAL FOLKLORIST 191 American Jewish periodicals,53 it went unnoticed by folklorists. There was no death announcement in the Journal of American Folklore, and, perhaps more significantly, his death was not commented upon until 1954 in Folk-Lore, the journal he had edited.54 His migration to America had effectively cut him off from his friends in the Folklore Society. Further, by the time of his death he was no longer an active folklorist and his ideas had no direct impact on folkloristics. The debate over diffusion had long been won in England, and in Germany and Scandinavia, where diffusion theory was important, other sources of the theory were cited, not Jacobs. Even in more recent times his name and writings have not had much impact. He is remembered by most folklorists, if they have heard of him at all, as one of the 'other' folklorists, outside Dorson's 'Great Team', as a perhaps fanatical defender of a theory that seems obvious today, and as a popularizer of folktales. The only scholarly article about Jacobs as a folklorist claimed that his major achievement was to rewrite popular fairy tales and downgraded (though it did not entirely dismiss) his scholarly accomplishments.55 In this article I have attempted to indicate that Jacobs is of more interest to folklorists today than previous evaluation would suggest. Although he did not pursue any of his ideas sufficiently, his thoughts on the nature of folk narrative, diffusion origins, and the relationshiop of behaviour to social structure are congruent with ideas which are widely accepted today. Jacobs, more than most of his contemporaries, seemed to have an intuitive grasp of how folklore actually originated and spread, not just in theory, but in the 'real world' as well. Some of this insight may be due to his personal and cultural background as a Jewish expatriate able to experience at first hand the importance of immigration, diffusion, and structural constraints on traditions.56 Background aside, Jacobs' insights into the dynamics of folklore deserve to be read more thoroughly, not so much to discover what he proves (which is unfortunately little) or predicts, but to gain insight into one's own research. More than most folklorists', Jacobs' writings are packed with ideas, well worth the effort of unpacking for the research directions that they suggest.
