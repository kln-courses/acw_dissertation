Statue of Zeus, Enthroned Late Hellenistic, ca. TOO B.C. Marble, H: 74 cm (29'/x in.) 92. AA. T0 This half-life-size statue is based on the well-known Pheidian statue of Zeus cre- ated for the great temple of the god at Olympia. The partially draped deity sits on a high-backed throne. The remaining armrest of the throne is elaborately orna- mented with a ram's-head terminal and a support in the form of a seated sphinx. Zeus's right arm is raised, undoubtedly to hold a scepter that is now lost. The fin- gers of the left hand, the front part of the right foot, and the right hand are missing. Marine encrustations, which indicate that the statue was buried in the sea, cover approximately half of the sculpture. PROVENANCE: Private collection, New York. BRONZE SCULPTURE 2. Statuette of a Giant Hurling a Rock Greek, early second century B.C. H: 14 cm (5'1/2 in.) 92. AB. 9 The muscular giant, half-standing with knees bent and his right leg pulled up beneath him, is poised to hurl the rock that he holds overhead. The statuette was most likely part of a larger group com- position depicting the Gigantomachy; a small hole under the left thigh may indi- cate the figure's original point of attach- ment to a landscape setting. The only physical indications of the giant's wild, inhuman nature are his pointed ears and coarse, tufted hair; the rest of the beau- tifully modeled figure appears quite human. The pose of the statuette com- pares closely to the figure of the giant Klytios as depicted on the east facade of the well-known Gigantomachy frieze from the Great Altar of Zeus at Pergamon; he also holds a rock over his head. The statuette is intact. PROVENANCE: Private collection, New York.</page><page sequence="4">104 Acquisitions/l992 3. Portrait Bust of Demosthenes Roman, first century B.C. H: 7.9 cm (3W/ in.); W: 3.4 cm (I 5/16 in.) 92. AB. 105 This small, finely crafted portrait depicts one of the most famous Athenian orators, Demosthenes (ca. 3 84-322 B. C.). He is best remembered for his anti-Macedonian position during the rule of Philip II, the father of Alexander the Great. A dotted inscription on the lower front portion of the bust preserves most of his name: DHMO [ZOE] NHI[. The portrait is based on a type created by the Athenian sculptor Polyeuktos, whose bronze statue of the orator was placed in the Agora of Athens in 280 B.C. The surface of the bust, which has been cleaned, is in excellent condition. PROVENANCE: European art market. 4. Statuette of a Snake-legged Giant Roman, late second-early third cen- tury A.D., after a Hellenistic original H: 14.7 cm (5 5/ in.) 92.AB. II The figure is of a young snake-legged giant engaged in combat with a now- missing opponent. The twist of his torso, the preserved right arm upraised in defense, and the complex coiling of his sinuous legs, which end in snake heads with widely gaping mouths, combine to create an atmosphere of tension and imminent danger. In addition to his snaky legs, the wildness of the giant is indicated by the unkempt hair on his head and swirls of hair on his chest and shoulders. The statuette must once have been part of a larger composition depict- ing the Gigantomachy; an inscription on his left buttock, K, may have indicated his placement within the grouping. The lower left arm is now lost; the right hand and part of the snake head on the right leg are incomplete, perhaps the result of damage that occurred during the original casting. With the exception of these losses, the statuette is in excellent condi- tion, with finely chased details preserved on the legs and body.

AC. 5 This intact vessel is cast in the form of a siren. Her lower body is that of a bird, with incised feathers overall and bird legs and feet, and her breast is that of a human female clad in a peplos with overfall. In</page><page sequence="5">Antiquities I05 her outstretched hands she holds a pomegranate and a syrinx, or Pan pipes, symbols of the role the siren played in antiquity as the muse of life after death. Her wavy hair is drawn back beneath a simple crown and the vessel's spout ascends from the top of her head. The arching handle of the vessel takes the form of a nude youth with arms akimbo, and the ring preserved around his left arm was once part of a chain attached to the vessel's now-missing stopper. The condition of the askos is excellent; the fine chasing of the feathers and the details of the siren's face and hair are well pre- served. The siren is covered with a light blue-green patina and some encrustation. The head and body were hollow cast as two separate pieces, while the legs and arms were solid cast individually and then attached to the body. PROVENANCE: Private collection, New York. 6. Helmet and Two Ankle Guards Apulo-Corinthian, early fourth century B.C. Helmet, H: 17.8 cm (7 in.); ankle guards, H: 26.5 cm (Io3/8 in.) 92.AC.7.I-.3 This assemblage consists of a finely engraved Apulo-Corinthian helmet and two ankle guards with repousse decora- tion. The crown of the helmet is modeled and bordered by a double row of small, circular rivets. From the hairline descend inward-curling ringlets that transform to a lotus frieze at the outer terminals of the eyebrows. Between the brows is a lotus bud. The closed cheekpieces are deco- rated with seated heraldic sphinxes with tousled hair wearing diadems with verti- cal leaf-shaped attachments. Chevrons outline the eye holes and nose flap. Above a projecting flange at the back of the helmet, which was designed to protect the back of the neck, two satyrs recline to the right, on either side of a large kantharos. Their languid poses suggest a relaxed session of drinking. One satyr, who holds a plain rhyton in his right hand, looks back over his shoulder at his companion, whose head is thrown back and mouth open as he succumbs to the effects of drink. The figures are identified as satyrs by the treatment of their heads, with their beards, pointed ears, and pug noses. Preserved on the crown of the helmet are two rectangular attachments flanking an M-shaped clamp. These three 6 (hclmct) 6 (dctail ofhclmct) attachments must have originally held horse-hair crests and feathers, or possibly metal horns. On either side of the helmet, at the point where the flange begins to project, are small holes for the stringing of a chin strap. The combination of sphinxes and satyrs-references to the afterlife- indicates the funereal iconography of the helmet. As a warrior was constantly faced with the prospect of sudden death, such imagery is appropriate. The quality and nature of the helmet's decoration suggest that it was not meant to be worn in battle but served a ceremonial function. The helmet's small, close-set eyes indicate that it was meant to be worn resting back on top of the head rather than over the face. Also exceptional are the ankle guards that complete this assemblage. Both were manufactured to shield the right ankle. They are simply decorated with repousse' double teardrops that protected the inner anklebone. The outer bone was protected by a ridge that would deflect any weapon thrust at the ankle. The back of the ankle and Achilles tendon were protected by a pointed, elongated flange reinforced by three vertical ridges. The guard was</page><page sequence="6">io6 Acquisitions/l992 wrapped around to the front of the ankle and secured with a cord. Both the helmet and ankle guards preserve a fine golden and greenish patina; the nose flap on the helmet was once separated and has been reattached. PROVENANCE: Private collection, New York. VASES: CORINTHIAN 7. Aryballos First quarter of the sixth century B.C. Terra-cotta, H: 11.2 cm (4'/2 in.); W: II.7 cm (43/4 in.) 92.AE.4 The globular body of this oil container is decorated with one of the labors of Her- akles, the battle with the Hydra of Lerna. Directly opposite the handle, Herakles grasps one of the monster's nine snaky heads and thrusts his sword at its body. He is assisted in his deadly task by Iolaos, who stands on the other side of the Hydra holding one of its decapitated heads. Behind Herakles stands Athena, who ges- tures her support toward the hero. At her feet is a small crab who nips at Herakles' right ankle. The three figures are named in Corinthian script, and Iolaos' patronymic is also included. Below the handle is a quadriga with a charioteer, who looks back over his shoulder at the combat. The handle is decorated with the profile head of a female, perhaps a god- dess. The exterior rim of the aryballos is decorated with zigzags on either side of the handle, with a right-hand meander in between. The top of the mouth is embel- lished with an eighteen-petaled rosette and the underside with a whirligig com- posed of ten red arms. The mouth of the vessel has been broken and repaired and there are a few minor surface spalls, most notably near the head of Herakles and the body of Athena. PROVENANCE: Private collection, New York. VASES: ATTIC 8. Group of Forty-Seven Fragments of Attic Black- and Red-figure Vases Late sixth-early fifth century B.C.

VASES: ATTIC RED-FIGURE io. Calyx-Krater Ca. 470-460 B.C. Signed by Syriskos as painter (formerly known as the Copenhagen Painter) Terra-cotta, H: 43 cm (17 in.); Diam (mouth): 54 cm (21 in.) 92.AE.6 This vessel records the first signature of Syriskos as painter and identifies the artist as the Copenhagen Painter; it records a price graffito on the underside. On the principal side of the krater, Gaia (inscribed as rE HANTEAEIA, "Ge the All-Accomplishing") is depicted seated upon an elaborate throne. She holds a scepter and libation bowl. Before her stands Dionysos (inscribed AIONVEOE), who holds a branch in his extended right arm and a sprig of ivy in the other. The god of wine is accompanied by a small leopard. Behind Gaia stands her son, the Titan Okeanos (inscribed OKEANOE), who also holds a scepter. On the secondary side, another god- dess is flanked by two males. In the center stands Themis (inscribed OEMI?), the mother of Prometheus. She holds a pour- ing vessel in one hand and a libation bowl in the other, which she extends to the god seated at her right, Balos (inscribed BALOE). He holds a scepter in his left hand and reaches out to receive the prof- fered bowl. On Themis' opposite side stands Ephaphos (inscribed EDDAtD[O]E). The offspring of Zeus and lo, born on the banks of the Nile, Ephaphos is the grand- father of Balos. The relationship between the three figures on this side of the vessel remains unclear. The rim of the krater is decorated with a palmette frieze and the top of the cul with pairs of linked mean- ders alternating with blackened cross squares. Above the foot is a frieze of ascending black tongues, and the under- sides of the handles are decorated with palmettes. On the underside of the foot is scratched a fork-shaped graffito, Y', along with the word STATERI, which records the price of the vessel as one stater. A second graffito is also present on the underside: B. The vessel has been recon- structed from fragments and some areas contain fills; one handle has been restored.

Trendall] Terra-cotta, H: 63.4 cm (25 in.) 92. AE.86 On the front of the vessel is a scene from the mythological story told in the play The Seven Against Thebes by Aeschylus, which was set before the city wall and gate of Thebes. The warrior Kapaneus climbs a ladder toward two of the city's defenders, who appear in the crenelations above. He holds a burning torch in his right hand and protects himself from the warriors above with his lofted shield. His attempt is in vain, however, for the thun- derbolt of Zeus shown in the upper left corner is about to knock him from his perch. To the right of the gate, a quadriga charges out from the city. Above it flies a small Nike holding a victory wreath aloft. In the right crenelation of the wall is the figure of a white-haired, bearded man holding a scepter. He may be Kreon, the ruler of Thebes at the time. The wood of the city walls and gate is deli- cately rendered in dilute glaze to indicate texture and grain, the gate itself is depicted in added white, and gold is used to indicate the metal fittings. On the shoulder above the scene, two leopards flank a palmette. On the opposite side of the vessel are depicted three satyrs and two maenads in a landscape. The shoul- der above is decorated with descending tongues. The neck panel of side A shows the figure of a nude male pouring a liba- tion before a filleted Ionic column, while the neck panel on side B shows a woman holding a box fleeing to the right. Both have an ovulo above. Other subsidiary decoration consists of a wave pattern on the outer edge of the rim, a meander to right with a saltire square below the prin- cipal scene on side A, and wave pattern below the principal scene on side B. The handles of the vessel are twisted. The vase has been reconstructed and is nearly complete with some minor surface abra- sion. The added color is well preserved, especially on side A.

The wire overlaps at the back of the wreath, and the terminals are formed to imitate the broken ends of twigs. Sol- dered to this wire at the front and sides are eighty-nine laurel leaves and twenty- five laurel berries, dispersed on small stems; the back is unadorned.

Two arching handles with foliate forms and goose heads begin at the gilded rim of the vessel and descend to satyr heads adorned with wreaths. Gilding accents the satyrs' ears and beards, and gilded ivy leaves rise from the center of their fore- heads. The plain neck of the vessel is</page><page sequence="10">i io Acquisitions/l992 encircled by a collar of overlapping hori- zontal feathers. The body is decorated at the top of the shoulder with a tendril frieze encircling single leaves, below which are fifteen rows of vertical feathers; twenty-two plain horizontal bands accent the attenuated base. Gilded bands sepa- rate the different decorated zones. The date of this vessel is somewhat controver- sial, as many of the decorative elements appear on Hellenistic metalware. But such elements as the knobbed handles and the collar encircling the neck are com- monly found on later Roman vessels of both metal and glass that date to the fourth and fifth century A.D. The vessel is in good condition with some repairs, pri- marily a horizontal break that occurs through the body in the zone decorated with feathers. PROVENANCE: Private collection, New York. GEMS I5. Engraved Scarab Etruscan, early fourth century B.C. Banded brown and white agate, L: i.65 cm (5/8 in.); W: 1.13 cm (7/I6 in.) 92.AN.85 The rounded back of this banded agate is carved as a beetle. The flat surface is engraved with a scene of a helmeted war- rior facing left. His cloak is thrown over one shoulder and he carries a spear in his right hand. In his left hand is a recently decapitated head still dripping blood; the headless body lies at his feet. The entire scene is framed by a hatched border. The image may depict Amphiaraos or Tydeus holding the head of Melanippos, one of the defenders of the city of Thebes. Tydeus killed Melanippos in the heat of battle but was mortally wounded him- self. Before he died he asked to see the head of his opponent. Melanippos' head was severed and brought to him either by Amphiaraos or Kapaneus, another of the Greek attackers. The gem is intact with no chips or scratches.

COMMENTARY: Many of the pages with histori- ated initials in fols. I-238 feature marginal dec- oration, much of it of an apparently secular nature. Some of it clearly relates to the subject of the adjacent initial and/or to the psalm, e.g., Psalm 44, initial E with A King Harping includes in the margins Angels Playing Instru- ments and in the bas-de-page A Queen Singing Accompanied by Female Saints (fol. 6iv). The manuscript's distinctive iconographic program is discussed in the unpublished doctoral thesis of Elizabeth Peterson, Iconography of the Histo- riated Psalm Initials in the Thirteenth-Century French Fully-Illustrated Psalter Group (Univer- sity of Pittsburgh, I991). The coat of arms on the surcoat of the deceased knight represented on fol. 266 appears to be that of the Counts of Namur (J. B. Rietstap, Armorial general, vol. 2 [Lyons, 1950], p. 295). The fourteenth-century miniatures are here attributed to the Passion Master and his atelier. BIBLIOGRAPHY: Lilian M. C.

A date in the early 1430S is sug- gested by the stylistic similarity to the representations of Saints Mark and Peter on the outer wings of the Linaiuoli trip- tych (Museo di San Marco, Florence), commissioned in I433.

SEBASTIANO DEL PIOMBO (Sebastiano Luciani) Italian, ca. 1485-I547 Portrait of Pope Clement VII, ca. 1531 Oil on slate, 105.5 x 87.5 cm (41'/2x 34'/2in.) 92. PC. 25 This portrait is probably the one ordered by Pope Clement VII (reigned 1523-34) from Sebastiano byJuly 22, 1531 (see Sebastiano's letter to Michelangelo in Paola Barocchi and Renzo Ristori, II Car- teggio di Michelangelo, vol. 3 [Florence, 1973], p. 318). By that date, one portrait of the pontiff had been completed on canvas. The Pope wanted another of the same type painted on stone, and this is the only extant work to fit that description. A small study of Clement's head painted on slate (Museo Nazionale di Capodimonte, Naples) probably served as the model for the many portraits of the Pope that were ordered from Sebastiano from about 1530 (see Michael Hirst, Sebastiano del Piombo [Oxford and New York, i98i], pp. III-12, pl. 141). The work presented here is the portrait most clearly developed from this small study. A canvas version of the seated portrait (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna) shows the Pope with a weary and uncer- tain visage that is quite distinct from the self-confident attitude evident in the two slate portraits. In the Vienna canvas, the curtain and column of the Getty Museum version were eliminated in favor of a neu- tral background, and the Pope's coat of arms was added in the upper right corner. (On the Vienna version, see Hirst, pp. IIO-II, pl. 140.) Numerous variants of the basic type represented in this work and in the Vienna portrait were produced by Sebastiano's workshop or by later hands. They include one in a German private collection; one formerly in the Hamilton Palace collection; one in Pollock House, Glasgow; and one in the Museo Mediceo, Florence (see Hirst, p. iii, and Carlo Volpe and Mauro Lucco, LOpera completa di Sebastiano del Piombo, Classici dell'arte Rizzoli, no. 99 [Milan, 1980], pp. II7-I8, nos. 78bd).

PA. 42 Owing to its dirty varnish and high placement on a wall at Somerley, this painting was consistently underrated by twentieth-century critics until Wethey hinted at its autograph quality. At its sale in London in December I99I, the first modern opportunity to study it under acceptable conditions, it became apparent that the picture was by Titian himself. There are numerous versions of the composition. The most important of these-and the only one of indisputable authenticity-is the picture painted for Philip I1 and delivered to London in 1554 (Museo del Prado, Madrid). An earlier, lost version was apparently painted for the Farnese family in 1545-46. Smaller, somewhat different versions of the sub- ject are in the National Gallery, Wash- ington, D.C., the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and the National Gallery, London.

PETER PAUL RUBENS Flemish, 1577-I640 The Death of Samson, ca. i6o0 Oil on canvas, 99 x II0. 5 cm (39 x 43 '/2 in.) 92.PA. I10 This unpublished painting is among the most ambitious works produced by Rubens during his early years in Italy. It captures the chaotic demise of Samson (Judges I6:21-3I) in a composition proba- bly intended to rival Giulio Romano's Sala dei Giganti in the Palazzo del Te, Mantua. The heroic figure of Samson, based on the Laocodn (Musei Vaticani, Rome), was developed by Rubens in a pen drawing on a sheet mainly devoted to a Battle Between Greeks and Amazons (Edinburgh, National Gallery of Scot- land); see Michael Jaffe, Rubens and Italy (Oxford and Ithaca, I977), fig. 227, who dates the sketch to around i6o5. Rubens's drawing of Samson was subsequently copied by van Dyck (see idem, Van Dyck's Antwerp Sketchbook [London, I966], V. 2, p. 220, regarding fol. i5v). The painting is in remarkable condi- tion and has never been lined. PROVENANCE: Corsini collection, Florence; private collection, Switzerland.

JAN BRUEGHEL THE ELDER Flemish, 1568-1625 The Entry of the Animals into Noah 's Ark, I613 Oil on panel, 54.6 x 83.8 cm (21'/2 x 33 in.). Signed and dated BRUEGHEL FEC. 1613 in the lower right. 92.PB.82 The story of Noah's ark (Genesis 6-8) enabled Brueghel to demonstrate his expertise at rendering animals. The artist doubtlessly studied many of the more exotic species in the menagerie of the Archduchess Isabella Clara Eugenia in Brussels. The depictions of the lions, the horse, and the leopards were inspired by examples in the works of Rubens. The lions are depicted in Daniel in the Lions' Den (National Gallery of Art, Wash- ington, D. C.); the horse appears in several equestrian portraits from Rubens's Spanish and Italian periods, probably known to Brueghel from drawings; and the leopards appear in Leopards, Satyrs and Nymphs (Montreal Museum of Fine Arts). This panel served as the prototype for a whole class of Brueghel's paintings, the so-called Paradise Landscapes (see Ertz, 1979, pp. 236-39). While he created several examples himself, many copies by followers exist. An autograph replica is in the Szep- miuveszeti Museum, Budapest (inv. no. 548); see Ertz, 1979, p. 603, no. 274. An autograph variant, dated i6i5, is in the Wellington Museum, Apsley House, London (inv. no. 1637); see Ertz, 1979, p. 6o5, no. 287.

GC. 80 This drawing, which was recently attributed to Martin Schongauer by Fritz Koreny, marks the rise of the observation of nature in Northern European art. It was used as a study for Schongauer's most important surviving painting, The Madonna of the Rose Garden of 1473 in the Dominican Church, Colmar. Albrecht Durer's famous watercolor, Virgin and Child with a Multitude of Animals (Gra- phische Sammlung Albertina, Vienna), contains a cluster of peonies to the right of the Virgin that is based on the Museum's drawing.

I03 The sophisticated line work of this drawing suggests that it was made by an artist in the circle of Durer around I5o0. Among his pupils, this sheet is closest to the graphic work of Hans Baldung Grien (ca. 1484-I545), who worked as ajour- neyman with Durer from I503 to around I507. The hooked drapery, short, cur- vilinear hatching, and the use of white to render sculptural roundness are similar to the pen work in early drawings by Bal- dung, such as A Monk Preaching of around I505 in the Getty Museum. The intimacy and tenderness in the expressions and gestures of the Virgin and Child occur in other paintings of the same subject by Baldung.

URS GRAF Swiss, ca. 1485-I527/29 Dancing Peasant Couple, 1525 Pen and black ink, 20.6 x I4.7 cm (8 '/i x 5s '/i6 in.). Signed with the art- ist's monogram and dagger and dated 1525 in black ink at the bottom. 92.GA.72 This sheet belongs to a series of peasant couples dancing, of which there are eight known examples: three in the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, Paris, and others in the Biblioteca Reale, Turin; the Musee de Bergues Saint-Vinnocq, France; the Kupferstichkabinett, Berlin; and the Kupferstichkabinett, Offentliche Kunst- sammlung, Basel. All, including this drawing, were monogrammed by the art- ist, dated 1525, and extensively pricked for transfer. Two hypotheses for the pricking are that the drawings were made as designs for prints or that they were pricked in order to be copied, possibly in the eighteenth century (see E. Brugerolles, in Dessins de Durer et de la Renaissance germanique, exh. cat. [Mus6e du Louvre, Paris, I99I-92], p. 152, no. 138). PROVENANCE: Private collection, Switzerland; London art market. 28.

Inscribed (verso): HH in brown ink between the drawing and the lining. 92.GG.91 Rosenberg (I960, p. 32) proposed that this drawing forms a stylistic link between the portrait study of Martin Luther's father of 1527 in the Graphische Sammlung Albertina, Vienna, and the group of ten portraits by Cranach at Reims, Musee de la Ville, which he dated to around 1530-40. This portrait com- bines the powerful emotional presence of the drawing in Vienna with the physical beauty and precise detail typical of the Reims group. The unidentified sitter was probably connected with the court of Saxony at Wittenberg, where Cranach was employed as court painter. Like the Reims drawings, which portray members of the Saxon court, this sheet is a life study in oil on paper with the facial fea- tures fully delineated and the clothing sparsely sketched.

Watermark of a crowned shield with a cursive h and OS above (close to Briquet 8246, Germany, 1592). 92.GG. 15 This drawing descends from the tradi- tion of soaring Gothic interiors by the Danube school artists Albrecht Altdorfer (ca. 1480-1538) and Wolf Huber (1485- 1553). It is drawn in one-point perspec- tive, with the vanishing point (marked by a compass hole) located in the center of the small altarpiece in the apse. The main emphasis, however, is placed upon the soaring overhead vaulting, with its intri- cate, decorative patterns of ribbing. The drawing has been made with great atten- tion to architectural details and furnish- ings, suggesting that it depicts a specific church. It was possibly made as a study for a painting.

Shortly thereafter, Sandrart enlisted a number of engravers to publish a series based upon drawings that he made after his paintings. This highly worked sheet, which closely follows his painting of the month of September in Schloss Schleissheim, is the model in reverse for the engraving by Cornelis van Dalen.

The gem belonged to Cosimo de' Medici, who had it mounted around 1428 by Ghiberti. It is likely that the draftsman visited Florence and made the drawing there. The male figure appears to be based on a Roman sculpture of a Praxitelean type. The sheet is exem- plary of a category of drawings made in the workshops of Gentile da Fabriano and Pisanello in which forms based either on the antique or on natural observation were set down for study purposes.

GA. 14 44 (recto) 44 (verso) The figure at the right of the recto hold- ing a book is closely comparable to the representation ofJohn the Baptist at the right of the altarpiece Mantegna painted for the Church of San Zeno, Verona. The reclining figure on the verso is a study for the soldier in the San Zeno predella panel of the Resurrection. Given the close connection between these figures in the drawing and the altarpiece, it is clear that this sheet was made in preparation for the latter, probably early in its evolution. It joins the modello showing standing saints, purchased by the Museum at the Chatsworth sale of I984, as one of two known drawings for the San Zeno altar- piece. The pair represents the range of Mantegna's draftsmanship from the loosest to most highly finished.

There is a second portrait drawing by the same hand in the Fondation Custodia, Paris, which was catalogued as North Italian, possibly Milanese or Veronese, byJ. Byam Shaw (J. Byam Shaw, The Italian Draw- ing of the Frits Lugt Collection [Paris, I983], vol. I, no. 227). The breadth and painter- liness of this drawing, calling to mind parallels with portraits by Giovanni Bellini, indicate that the artist may well be Venetian.

NORTH ITALIAN Active second half of the fifteenth century Equestrian Figure, ca. 1490 Red chalk, 21.7 x 17.8 cm (8'/2 x 6'5/v, in.). Inscribed: remnants of a trimmed-off inscription in brown ink in the lower right corner; inscribed (verso): S. Vn: 5 in brown ink. 92.GA. 113 The drawing depicts an equestrian figure before a landscape with a city view in the distance. The face of the rider resembles that of Francesco Gonzaga, 4th marquis of Mantua, as compared with his portrait in Mantegna's Madonna della Vittoria (Paris, Mus6e du Louvre) and a drawing by a North Italian artist in the National Gallery, Dublin. The heroic classical pose of the victorious rider is of Antique inspiration and, along with the natural- ism of pose and expression, relate the sheet to the style and intellectual outlook of Mantegna. There are no red chalk drawings by him, however, and the somewhat lower standard of draftsman- ship here suggests an author such as Bon- signori, who was influenced by Mantegna and was commissioned in the early I490S to paint a documented but now lost victory portrait of Francesco Gonzaga.

Collection mark W (unknown) in lower right corner; inscribed (verso): No. 41 twice and 15 cent. in graphite. 92.GA.3I The preponderance of female figures in this hunting scene, as well as the bathers in the left middle ground, suggest that the subject may be Diana and her nymphs, although they are not depicted in the traditional fashion. On the verso, the artist has lightly sketched two reclin- ing male figures twice in a frieze-like manner along with an architectural motif. The sheet is characteristic of Aspertini's pen style, as seen in the three extant sketchbooks by the artist (Codex Wolfegg, Waldburg-Wolfegg collection, Baden-Wuirttemberg, and London, Brit- ish Museum). It is not related to a known painting by him. PROVENANCE: Private collection (sale, Sotheby's, London, July 4, 1975, lot 57); Boston art market. 48. FRANCIABIGIO (Francesco di Christofano) Italian, 1484-I525 Standing Male Figure, ca. I5I5 Black chalk, 46.7 x 34.2 cm (I8 7/K x 13 '/2 in.) [irregularly shaped]. Inscribed (verso): S.F no: 21 in brown ink. 92.GB. 13 The artist has depicted a young male fig- ure casually posed and holding a book or tablet upon which he seems to be writing or sketching. He is dressed in contem- porary fashion, wearing a cap, knee breeches, and a cape. The drawing was probably made from life, with the model possibly a fellow artist or workshop assis- tant. The drawing is typical of Fran- ciabigio's figure studies, such as those of standing male models in Modena, Gal- leria Estense, and Munich, Staatliche Graphische Sammlung.

ANDREA DEL SARTO Italian, 1486-I530 Two Male Figures Behind a Balustrade (recto and verso), ca. 1525 Red chalk, 17.5 X 20 cm (67/8x 77/8 in.) 92.GB.74 The purpose of this imposing, newly dis- covered sheet by Sarto remains unknown. A pair of male figures leaning on bal- ustrades appears on both the recto and the verso. The figures hold books or tablets and might represent the Four Evangelists. It has been suggested that the studies may be related to Sarto's designs for the Four Evangelists found on the Passerini altar frontal or to the temporary decorations he contributed to the festivities surround- ing the triumphal entry of Pope Leo X into Florence in isis (see Bellinger and McCorquodale, Drawing in Florence 1500- 1650), but it might well be that they were executed at a slightly later date in prepa- ration for a lost or never realized painted project.

I-.4 These wall lights are closely related to a drawing in the University Library, War- saw, that is inscribed Invente &amp; Execute' par P Caffieri Sculpteur et Sizeleur Du Roy d Paris 1768. The bobeche and drip pans on each arm of the wall lights are identical to those in the drawing, thus allowing for an attribution to the bronzier Philippe Caf- fieri. The Museum already owns a set of six wall lights by Caffieri (accession num- bers 78.DF.263.I-.4 and 83.DF.85. I-.2) produced after the design mentioned above, one of which is signed Caffieri. The bobeche and drip pans on the latter six examples differ slightly from those in the drawing in that they do not include a Greek key motif on the bobeche, but rather have small "pearls" in its place. All of these wall lights may have been part of a commission for Stanislas Poniatowski, who was elected King of Poland as Stanislas II in 1764. Poniatowski began the total redecoration of the old Royal Palace at Warsaw immediately after becoming king, employing a number of Parisian craftsmen such as Caffieri for this purpose. PROVENANCE: [B.

DD.21 The Anciennes Indes tapestry series ultimately derived from studies made by two Dutch artists during an expedition to Brazil from 1637 to I644. Albert Eckhout and Frans Post painted the flora, fauna, and people of northeast Brazil while accompanying the newly appointed Dutch governor of Brazil, Prince Maurice of Nassau (I604-I679), on a tour of the region. Upon their return to Europe, via Africa, Prince Maurice commissioned the artists to produce cartoons for a tapestry series of eight scenes, which were pre- sented to Louis XIV in I679. The French tapestry manufactory at the Gobelins employed French artists to prepare the cartoons for weaving. Seven sets were produced for the French crown between I690 and I730, but an unknown number of private weavings were also made. The series was so popular that the cartoons were ruined from overuse by 1730 and a second series called the Nouvelles Indes was designed by Alexandre-Franqois Des- portes. Le Cheval Raye' is usually a nar- rower composition, but this example has extensions to the left and right portraying native hunters, which were almost cer- tainly added by the Gobelins artists, for they are not based upon the drawings by Eckhout and Post.

I-.12 These chairs-which combine local ico- nography, decorative styles, and materials with Dutch models that were themselves based on Portuguese prototypes-were most likely made for Dutch colonizers of Southern Asia. Their form and deco- ration specifically recall thefrailero, or "friar's chair," of Spanish origin, with spiral-turned elements in dark wood and low-relief carving on the stiles and armrests. The low-relief flowers and stip- pling are also reminiscent of the tightly scrolling foliate motifs of much southern Asian woodwork, metalwork, and weav- ing. The combination of Christian and Hindu motifs, such as a cherub head and a parrot (the Hindu symbol for beauty), underscores the stylistic eclecticism of the chairs.

SE. 69 The scagliola technique was first devel- oped in south Germany at the end of the sixteenth century as a cheaper and less time-consuming alternative to pietre dure. Blausius Fistulator, one of the earliest and most skilled practitioners of the medium, headed a talented family of scagliola workers whose production continued well into the seventeenth century. The Fistulator workshop specialized in images inspired by the illusionistic perspectives of architectural and scenographic prints, similar to the Italianate interior and land- scape background depicted in this plaque. The frame displays the coat of arms of Pope Clement XII (Lorenzo Corsini, born i652, reigned 1730-40). The treatment of the frame's dolphins and trumpet-blowing tritons, as well as the repeating scallop shell and foliate orna- ment, are typical of late seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Italian design.

Bust of Commodus Italian, late sixteenth century Marble, H (with socle): 95 cm (37?Vs in.); socle H: 22.5 cm (87/8 in.) 92.SA.48 This bust is closely related to a purport- edly ancient marble head of Commodus (born i6I A.D.; Roman emperor from 180-192 A.D.) in the Vatican Museum, and may have been intended to pass as a genuine antiquity. However, the ways in which the bust departs from its antique prototype suggest its origins in the Italian Mannerist aesthetic of the sixteenth century. The proportions of the face and neck have been thinned and elon- gated, the eyelids appear heavier, and the chest-which is absent in the Vatican Commodus-has been given great breadth and depth to make the head appear proportionately small. Although Commodus was not usually among the series of Caesar busts commonly sculpted in the sixteenth century to decorate grand palazzi, this portrait no doubt functioned as a classicizing element in a palatial interior.

POSSIBLY CAST FROM A MODEL BY JEAN RAON French, 1630-1707 Jupiter, late seventeenth century Bronze, 74.3 x 41.1 x 22 cm (29'/4 X I6x3/16X 8 1/16 in.) 92. SB. io6 ThisJupiter appears to be a unique cast and is unusually large for a single figure in bronze of this date. In fact, few bronzes intended for interior decoration were produced in Baroque France until the very end of the seventeenth century, and those that were-such as Michel Anguier's (I612-I686) series of statuettes depicting gods and goddesses-were nearly half the size of theJupiter. This figure is influenced by an ancient marble statue ofJupiter formerly in the Giustiniani palace in Rome, which was published in an engraved plate of the two- volume Galleria Giustiniana in I631. The classicizing style of the bronze recalls the work of French Academy sculptors recruited for large-scale royal projects at the Tuileries, Versailles, Marly-Le-Roi, and other residences.

XT. 54 Like his friends and contemporaries Gustave Le Gray and Henri Le Secq, Charles Negre studied painting in the studio of Paul Delaroche in the early I840s before turning his attention to photography in 1844. During this period he continued to enter paintings in the annual salons. Negre experimented briefly with the daguerreotype at the beginning of his photographic career. Only about six of his daguerreotypes are now known to exist, four of which remain in his family's possession. The subject of this daguer- reotype is an unknown Hellenistic variant of a statue of Herakles, of a type known as an Alba Fucens Herakles, characterized by his seated pose and the apples of the Hesperides held in one hand. The sculpture's location is unknown, but it was probably in France. Its scale is also unknown and whether it is an original, a replica, or a cast. The choice of subject is characteristic of Negre. Much of his later work deals with sculpture, particularly the Gothic sculpture of the Cathedral of Chartres.

XM. 51 Negre's painterly training was evident from the beginning of his involvement with photography. In i856 the preemi- nent, early photographic critic Ernest Lacan remarked that Negre composed his photographs as though they were paint- ings. This handsome view of Paris and the Seine at Pont Marie is brilliantly structured by a network of interlocking triangles and trapezoids. The camera's vantage point high up on the Ile Saint- Louis looks across the Seine toward the Pont Marie and the Quai des C6lestins on the Right Bank. From the diverse range of elements before him, Negre has assembled a wonderfully cohesive com- position. The boathouses and barges to the lower left anchor the scene and send the eye across the water to the barges, carts, and piled-up building stones on the far river bank. The calm, reflective ambiance of the scene is nevertheless</page><page sequence="50">I50 Acquisitions/l992 infused with signs that indicate the set- ting as a venue for transport and work.

CHARLES NEGRE Spartacus, Tuileries Gardens, Paris, I859 Albumen print, 41.9 X 28.3 cm (i61/2x ii I/8 in.) 92. XM.43 In i859 Negre made a series of studies of statues in the gardens of the Tuileries with the intention of preparing a mono- graph about the garden and its sculpture. He proposed to illustrate the publication with photogravures made by a process that he had invented. This image may have been printed in reverse so that a gravure plate could be made from it. The statue, Spartacus Breaking His Chains, was made by Denis Foyatier (1793-1863) and bought in 1830 by King Louis Philippe. It remained in the Tuileries gardens until 1877, when it was moved to the Louvre. The statue was later transferred to a provincial museum. This depiction of the leader of a slave rebellion was thought by some to have been prophetic of the Revolution of I848, which brought about the King's down- fall. The section of the palace behind the statue was destroyed in 1870. Negre posi- tioned his camera near the statue's base rather than erecting a platform to bring his camera level with the sculpture, as would have been more normal at this period. The resulting upward gaze seems modern, anticipating twentieth-century photographic practice.

HENRI-VICTOR REGNAULT (Negative) French, 1810-1878 ALPHONSE LOUIS POITEVIN (Print) French, 1819-1882 Sevres: The Seine at Meudon, ca. 1853 Photomechanical print from sen- sitized lithographic stone, ca. 1855- 60, 3 1. I x 42.5 cm (127/4 x I6 -/i(, in.) 92. XM. 52 This notable carbon print by Alphonse Poitevin, made from a waxed paper nega- tive by Henri-Victor Regnault, is the only surviving example of a collaborative work between these two artists. Poitevin, a photographer and photographic inven- tor, originated and patented the carbon process in 1855. This was one of the first methods of transforming a photographic image into a permanent pigmented image. He made carbon prints from his own negatives as well as those of other photographers. Regnault, a highly skilled physicist and chemist, directed the por- celain manufactory at Scvres, where a small group of photographers emerged in the late 1840s. Regnault developed a scientific interest in photography and its practical uses, and he wholeheartedly embraced photography as a pastime and a means of personal expression. Work- ing with the calotype, Regnault became engrossed with problems of exposure and in manipulating the light conditions of any given scene or sub ject. In Sevres: The Seine at Meudon, Reg- nault demonstrates his mastery of light. The time of day is either early or late with patches of sun bursting into the camera's view, picking out the contours of the nearest rowboat and the barrel on the river bank. The position of the cam- era, halfway down a grass and wildflower embankment, gives a strong geometry to the composition and encourages the eye to explore the calm and detail of the scene. This landscape is an important complement to Camille Silvy's River Scene, France (La Vallie de l'Huisine), which was purchased in iggo, as well as to the series of seascapes by Gustave Le Gray already in the Museum's collection. It is one of only two extant prints from the negative and is, moreover, a monu- ment in the early history of photo- mechanical printmaking.

Among Delaroche's other students who would continue professionally in pho- tography were Gustave Le Gray, Charles Ncgre, and Henri Le Secq. Fenton's first- hand experience with the East occurred in I852 when he traveled to Kiev, Moscow, and Saint Petersburg. The romantic fascination with the Islamic Orient by Europeans during the first half of the nineteenth century is reflected in prints and, later, photographs of architecture, landscape, and people of the region and the introduction of Oriental motifs into works of art. On February 20, I855, Fenton sailed on HMS Hecla for Balaklava, Crimea, where Russia was at war with Turkey, England, France, and Sardinia over the final disposition of the decaying Ottoman Empire. The Crimean War focused the attention of Europeans on Islamic culture and politics, resulting in a renewed wave of Orientalism in art. Soldiers returned home with handi- crafts-textiles, musical instruments, and decorative objects-obtained in the bazaars of Sebastopol and Constantinople. Fenton was among those who fell in love with Islamic decorative arts, and a few years later he incorporated them into a series of photographs made in his well- lighted studio. Here Fenton posed his model, who is outfitted in the voluptuous costume of a Turkish dancer, reclining on a divan in order to recall the odalisques of old master painting. She cradles a goblet drum, her bare foot is sensuously exposed, and she gazes invitingly at the observer with the skill of a great courtesan.

After emigrating from England, in I849 he followed gold-seekers to San Francisco, where he became a daguerreotypist and wet plate photogra- pher. His photographs of that city are some of the earliest views of any Ameri- can or European city. This year the Getty purchased a seven-part panorama of San Francisco made by Fardon in I855. It complements other early panoramas in the collection, including those by Fenton of the Crimea; by Robertson of Con- stantinople; by Thomson of Hong Kong; the celebrated Gay daguerrean panorama of New London, Connecticut; and two Muybridge panoramas of San Francisco in the I870s. Six of the seven images in the Fardon panorama, along with more than twenty others, were published in i856 under the title San Francisco Album: Photographs of the Most Beautiful Views and Public Buildings of San Francisco. No indication was given, however, that some of the photographs could be joined to form a panorama. PROVENANCE: John Swingle, Berkeley, around 1974; Joseph and Elaine Monsen, Seattle. 82.

Partial gift of Professors Joseph and Elaine Monsen 92.XM-45 This three-part panorama of the Winthrop Square area in Boston offers a sweeping view of the destruction wrought by the Great Boston Fire of November 9-I0, I872. Following the Chicago Fire by almost exactly a year, flames broke out in Boston's business district on a Friday evening and burned on into the next afternoon, resulting in an unprecedented financial loss per acre. Black, whose own studio was saved when the fire stopped across the street, was a pioneer in recognizing photography's potential for recording historic events. Black also expanded the use of the medium by making the first aerial photo- graphs in the United States in i86o and by acting as photographer to the Bradford expedition to the Arctic in I869. How- ever, he is best known for his extensive series of photographs of the aftermath of the Boston fire, in which the rubble and still-smoking ruins offered viewers an immediacy not available from prints or paintings depicting the same scene. Black's use of the panorama format allows him to graphically illustrate the widespread destruction of Boston, a great city laid to waste.

CARLETON WATKINS Carleton Watkins is considered to be the most important and accomplished American landscape photographer of the second half of the nineteenth century. Because of the length of his career, which began in the I85os and extended through the I89os, and the great imagination and skill he applied to making his photo- graphs, he occupies a special place in the history of photography. He translated his perceptions into brilliantly structured photographs in which he harnessed the chaos of nature by the creation of com- plex compositions out of very simple motifs, which he incorporated into a seamless web of formal relationships. He is most famous for his views of Yosemite. Based in San Francisco, he also made numerous views both of that city and of Los Angeles. This year the Museum acquired a significant group of Watkins photographs, further developing what is already one of the finest and most diverse</page><page sequence="53">Photographs 153 collections of his work to be found any- where. This purchase included four mammoth plate albumen prints; six round or oval albumen prints; thirty-five albumen prints (thirty-one mounted on album leaves); five glass stereographs; and eighty-two card-mounted stereographs. Many of these works, such as the glass stereos and the round albumen prints, are extremely rare and expand the Museum's collection to include formats used by Watkins that are not currently represented. 83. CARLETON WATKINS American, I829-19I6 The Cliff House, San Francisco, ca. I879-80 Albumen print, 36.2 X 53.3 cm (144 X 21 in.). Inscribed with a his- torical description of Cliff House in pencil in a recent hand on the verso of the print. 92. XM.90 Watkins often photographed the architec- ture and topography of San Francisco where he lived, and he operated a studio and gallery where visitors could see a per- manent display of views made through- out the state. The Cliff House, which opened in I863, was a popular San Fran- Cisco recreation spot and a favorite subject for Watkins's photographs, including several in the Getty collection. This pho- tograph documents the original structure, which was later destroyed by fire, and its several additions. The figures strolling on Ocean Beach in the foreground make a fascinating study. Close to the center of the photograph a tiny figure stands on the wet sand with his hands on his hips. Unlike all the others he appears to be looking directly at the photographer. He is not only the pivotal center but the heartbeat of the photograph. This photo- graph appears to be the unique surviving print. PROVENANCE: A descendant of Harry C.

Peterson [encircled], all on the verso of the print. 92.XM.96.2 In the spring of M88o Watkins made an extended journey along the route of the Southern Pacific Railroad passing through Los Angeles, where he pho- tographed for several days. From South- ern California he traveled east to Arizona, where this image of an eccentrically shaped cactus was made. In letters to his wife from this time Watkins told of the special problems that the desert posed for photography. He complained of the heat, which restricted his work to the morning; of many days when work was impossible because the wind was blowing sand, ruining any attempt at making a wet plate negative; of his physical ailments; and of uncooperative horses that were not accustomed to the desert climate.

CARLETON WATKINS "Agassiz" Column, Yosemite, summer 1878 Circular albumen print, Diam: 12. 5 cm (4W`/6, in.). Inscribed: Agassiz Column Yosemite and signed C. E. Watkins in pencil, all on the verso of the print. 92. XM. 81.4 This is one of a group of six round prints that the Getty acquired this year. Although still grounded in the documen- tary tradition that Watkins had estab- lished in the i86os, prints from this series are experiments with a new, more inti- mate and personal style. Watkins antici- pated a major international shift in the late I870s from a documentary sensibility to Pictorialism. His new wide-angle cam- era had the effect of deepening perspec- tive and emphasizing foreground objects. This led him to choose compositions in which the foreground could be played against the background. This seemingly precarious rock was named for the dis- tinguished American naturalist Louis Agassiz (I807-I873). PROVENANCE: Private collection, California; [Thomas Halsted, Birmingham, Michiganl. 86. CARLETON WATKINS Down the Valley, Yosemite, summer 1878 Circular albumen print, Diam: 12.7 cm (4'5/v, in.). Inscribed: titled and signed in pencil verso print. 92.xM.81.3 Watkins visited Yosemite regularly over a period of more than three decades, mak- ing images to sell in his San Francisco gallery. In 1878 he spent most of the sum- mer there when he began to use a new smaller-format, wide-angle camera, trim- ming his final images to produce small, circular prints. This was a distinct change from his standard usage of a large-format camera that produced mammoth-size prints. The wide angle of this new cam- era, despite Watkins's cropping of the final small prints, enabled him to record on a single negative a much larger seg- ment of the width of the Yosemite Valley floor than was possible with his larger camera.

This striking view of Devil's Canyon in Sonoma County, California, shows not only the majestic quality of the area, with its mixture of geyser spray and fog within a V-shaped fissure, but also the presence of eight people to dramatize the scope and depth of the natural surroundings.

IOO. 63 After his apprenticeship in the daguer- reotype studio of Robert Vance about I854 in San Francisco, Watkins estab- lished his own studio there in i86i. He knew the city well and photographed many areas of it. Mark Hopkins was one of the four principal builders and finan- ciers of the Central Pacific Railroad, along with Charles Crocker, Leland Stanford, and Collis P. Huntington. Hopkins's grand mansion atop Nob Hill was a prominent architectural landmark. Watkins captured the full scale of the building's exuberant architecture, docu- menting the taste of the gilded age.

Inscribed with title in ink by an unknown hand under the image. 92.XM.99. 8 This print is of particular interest in that it shows Watkins's mobile photographic studio attached to a boxcar in the fore- ground. Because of his friendship with the railroad baron Collis Huntington Watkins was given free transit by rail for himself and the van, making it possible to move great distances easily and still have mobility once he had arrived. The mobile studio allowed Watkins to sensitize his large glass plates on the spot, then quickly develop them afterward. The image is also known as Watkins's Traveling Wagon on the Train, Oregon. The name of the San Francisco-based publisher W. H. Lawrence appears with Watkins's name on the side of the van, documenting a business relationship of which few details are known. Lawrence was the first successful publisher of photographs in California and helped Watkins and others distribute their work to the East Coast and Europe.

II In I992 the Department of Photographs received as a welcome gift from Freder- ick P. and Linda J. Lee a group of twenty- one aerial panoramic photographs of the Pacific Palisades and Santa Monica made between I912 and 195o. The photographs were commissioned by one of the pioneer real estate developers of this area, from whom Mr. Lee is descended. In this two- part panorama of the coastline, which includes the site of the Museum Villa, a wing of the airplane from which the pho- tograph was taken is visible on the far right. As a set the photographs comprise an intermittent history of the growth of the area near the Getty Museum and a study of the overall development of the far west side of Los Angeles. AARON SISKIND Aaron Siskind, an exact contemporary of Walker Evans, was one of the most influ- ential American photographers of the twentieth century. Beginning in the early years of Abstract Expressionist painting, he achieved great success in creating non- objective photographic images. He then founded a new movement in photogra- phy that took off in the sixties with his students at the Institute of Design in Chi- cago. In 1992 the Department of Photo- graphs acquired thirteen prints dating from the early 1930S to 1950 to supple- ment its already substantial holdings of 124 Siskind images. Very fine prints from Siskind's negatives of the thirties and forties are rarely on the market. 92. AARON SISKIND American, I903-I991 Untitled (Wagon), ca. I930S Gelatin silver print on original mount, ii x ii cm (43/8 x 43/x in.) 92.XM.76. i This composition with a slatted wagon appears to be a unique print from one of Siskind's first serious photographic efforts. After college he began teaching English in New York's public school system and tried to write poetry when not in the classroom. He started to make snapshots in the early thirties and by the end of the decade photography rather than poetry was his creative medium. His very first attempts with the camera include tree trunks, grain elevators, mas- sive boulders, and tenement walls. His urge to isolate and simplify the mundane might be called Constructivist or Preci- sionist, but it may also be termed poetic. This empty, but very functional, wagon seems to be the perfect vehicle for Sis- kind's initial need to present abstracted reality. The wooden slats create linear as well as tonal patterns on the surface of the print and, although depth is suggested by the wagon's form, Siskind's determina- tion to "see" in two dimensions rather than three is already evident.

AARON SISKIND SaintJoseph's House, ca. 1939 From "The Catholic Workers Movement" series Gelatin silver print on original mount, 21.5 x 17 cm (8 L/12 x 6/16 in.) 92.XM-76.3 During his association with the New York Photo League between 1933 and 1941, Siskind contributed to a number of documentary projects, including "Harlem Document" and "The Catholic Workers Movement." The austere lifestyle of the Catholic workers residing at the tenement building called SaintJoseph's House struck Siskind as a real commit- ment to the tenets of fundamentalist communism. The residents spent their time defending organized labor, feeding the needy, and promoting the idea of pac- ifism. The photographers' response to this genuinely religious habitat was to record images that illustrated biblical pas- sages. This simple composition domi- nated by a wooden crucifix was meant to refer to Matthew: "and whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water." Very few people appear in Siskind's pictures for "The Catholic Workers Movement" series, which was unusual in the work produced by Photo League members. The sparse decoration of the workers' tenement seems to have inspired Siskind to concen- trate instead on the geometry of the built environment, as he had done in response to Cottage (or "Tabernacle") City, a Methodist retreat on Martha's Vineyard that he had been exploring since I935.

Dated, signed, and stamped on the verso of the original mount. 92.XM.76.4 The abstract aesthetic that was to be Sis- kind's trademark surfaced in some of his first work only to be somewhat sub- merged by the social documentary images of the Photo League projects. In 1940-42 it resurfaced in images that exhibit a lim- ited number of pictorial elements poised between being recognizable and being subsumed in a stark, formalized composi- tion, such as this one made on Cape Cod. While he worked to finish his Cottage City project for exhibition at the Photo League the next year, Siskind also devoted part of the summer of 1940 tO creating pictures that could be called still lifes and were very consciously dif- ferent from the New York documents assembled by the League. At Chilmark and perhaps elsewhere on Martha's Vine- yard he used his camera for five by seven negatives and the incidental objects one would expect to find on a deck or pier or 94</page><page sequence="58">158 Acquisitions/l992 washed up on the beach to create a dis- tinctive, well-arranged universe that was contained within the four edges of a pho- tograph. The construction of form rather than the representation of reality was now his goal; he returned to the island each summer to pursue it. Here the soft rubber fisherman's boot and the hard edge of the pier suggest a specific place and vocation, but the photograph succeeds because it has been carefully composed of "found" forms that now read simply as dynamic and passive lines. Siskind's final image, reflective of his mood at the time, becomes an object for meditation rather than a bit of hard evidence or a revealing portrait.

Signed, titled, and dated on recto and verso. 92.XM. 109. I One of the boldest of Siskind's Glouces- ter abstractions, this picture was later described by the artist in the 1954 article "This is My Best" as "the blank eye, the hard profile, in a time of violence." An anthropomorphic image, it embodies Sis- kind's awareness of the war abroad and demonstrates the potential expressiveness of non-objective photography. Formally, the active flux between dark and light and negative and positive shapes and the var- ied surface of the subject anticipate the concerns of the Abstract Expressionist painters, several of whom were Green- wich Village acquaintances of the photographer. An apparent favorite of both the photographer and his sup- porters, Gloucester 16A was chosen as the announcement image for his spring 1947 exhibition at the Egan Gallery in New York. That show traveled west to San Francisco (the California Palace of the Legion of Honor) and Santa Barbara (the Santa Barbara Museum of Art). Thus it is especially appropriate that after forty-five years the picture should become a perma- nent part of a California collection. PROVENANCE: Denny Moers, Providence, Rhode Island. 96. PAUL STRAND American, I890-I976 Archina McRury, South Uist, Outer Hebrides, I954 Gelatin silver print, 20.9 X 19.3 cm (81/4 x 75/8 in.). Signed in black ink on the verso. 92.xM.46. I The work of Paul Strand's mid-career period consists of photographic projects carried out in Mexico, New England, Luzzara, and the site represented by this image, South Uist in the Outer Hebrides. In 1954 Strand's continued quest for remote rural populations took him to these islands off the northwest coast of Scotland. Once there the isolation of the island of South Uist and the insular nature of its inhabitants compelled Strand to address the relationship between man and his environment more thoroughly than he had done before. He lived for three months with these proud, Gaelic- speaking people, whose struggles appealed to his social conscience. In the nineteenth century, absentee landowners expelled many of the island's residents through the "clearances" that were intended to create more grazing land for sheep and deer. Strand admired the tenacity of those families that stayed on as tenant farmers despite the hardships. The book Tir a' Mhurain (Land of Bent Grass, after the traditional Gaelic name for South Uist), published in I962, contains a selection of 145 photographs from Strand's time in the Hebrides. It is introduced by a portrait of Murdoch 96 McRury, who might well be young Archina's grandfather, and an image of a Mrs. Mary McRury (pi. 98), who appears to be seated beside the same window seen at the upper left in Archina's portrait. Sur- prisingly, Strand chose another, less ani- mated picture of Archina for the book. In plate 129 she is shown from a greater distance in a rather stiff pose, no doubt gazing obediently at one of her elders stationed off-camera on her right.

Weston returned to the same subject in 1941, as part of a commis- sion to illustrate a special edition of Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass. The print was made under Weston's supervision toward the end of his life by his son, the pho- tographer Brett Weston. PROVENANCE: Gift ofJon B. Lovelace. MANUEL ALVAREZ BRAVO In 1992 the Department of Photographs acquired a group of fifty-three photo- graphs by Manuel Alvarez Bravo. The most prominent Latin American pho- tographer of the twentieth century, Alvarez Bravo ranks in importance with Brassai, Abbott, and Cartier-Bresson. This collection was formed in the late 1940s by Lester Bridaham, a magazine editor, shortly after graduating from Paul Sachs's celebrated course in connoisseur- ship at Harvard. The photographs date from 1927 until 1943. Among them are a number of Alvarez Bravo's most cele- brated images as well as a few that are believed to be the only prints ever made from the negatives. In addition to this important collection of Alvarez Bravo's work a second smaller group of eight photographs was also acquired that includes more recent work. 98. MANUEL ALVAREZ BRAVO Mexican, born 1902 The Daydream, 1931 Gelatin silver print, 22 x 14.2 cm (8/sx 5/s in.) 92. XM.23.11 As Alvarez Bravo recounted, he was read- ing in the hallway of the building in cen- tral Mexico City, where he then lived, when he observed a girl leaning on a nearby railing. The dramatic light that fell on her was so arresting that he raced for his camera. When he returned, the girl was still balanced in the same position, light touching only her right shoulder, recalling painting of the Spanish Baroque period. The girl remained suspended in a timeless reverie. Urban life in his natal city has been a consistent subject for Alvarez Bravo, but he has imbued the everyday scenes he chooses with symbolic resonances.</page><page sequence="60">i6o Acquisitions/l992 99. MANUEL ALVAREZ BRAVO Pierced Grave, I933 Gelatin silver print, 19.4 X 22.9 cm (7 5/8 x 9 in.) 92. XM.23.22 In a local cemetery the photographer found a wooden cross that passes through a whirlpool-like wreath of plants to pierce the ground covering a grave. The tight framing of the image creates an effect of circular motion, emphasizing the underlying idea of the composition, the mutability of all things. The mythology of Mexico has always rested on an acute awareness of the presence of death, and it is frequently an implied part of Alvarez Bravo's work. The decontextualization of the cross and flowers in Pierced Grave makes the picture similar to some of the work being done by the Surrealists in Europe during this period. 100. MANUEL ALVAREZ BRAVO Public Thirst, 1933 Gelatin silver print, 24. I X 19.1 cm ( X2 X 7'/2 in.) 92.XM.23.24 The photograph is evidence of Alvarez Bravo's genius for choosing the perfect moment to make an exposure. The result of his acute timing is an image with glowing patches of light emerging from intense grays and blacks to form a lively image of the Mexico of the 1930s. The title of the image may also be an oblique reference to Mayan religious practices. Young boys were publicly sacrificed to Tlaloc, the god of rain, in the belief that this would produce the moisture that was necessary to grow crops and slake the public thirst. 101. MANUEL ALVAREZ BRAVO Striking Worker Murdered, 1934 Gelatin silver print, 19 X 24. I cm (7'/2 X 9h in.) 92.XM.23.27 Andre Breton wrote in 1939 about Alvarez Bravo, "The great surges of his inspiration are furthered by his highly developed sense of quality as well as by his infallible technique. In his Striking Worker Murdered Manuel Alvarez Bravo rises to what Baudelaire called 'the eter- nal style.'" Breton's enthusiasm is an example of the strong reactions produced in viewers of this image of graphic vio- lence. Others have read the picture as a political statement, an interpretation that the photographer resists, perhaps as a repudiation of beliefs now changed or as an unwillingness to fix a single meaning or ideology to the image. Alvarez Bravo has often juxtaposed this photograph with that of the young boy drinking at a public fountain, contrasting innocent life and violent death.</page><page sequence="61">Photographs i6i 102. MANUEL ALVAREZ BRAVO The Crouched Ones, 1934 Gelatin silver print, 17.7 X 23.8 cm (7 x 93/8 in.) 92.XM.23.28 Bravo's distance from the established art centers of the world allowed his work to develop in an intensely personal way that expresses the essence of Mexican life and culture. The way that this image captures the textures of everyday life is compar- able to the work of the painter Edward Hopper. The framing of the image concentrates its visual power. A strong horizontal cuts across the black and gray of the men's bodies to form a sort of viewfinder through which we can peer, crouching to see the crouched ones. Their apparent individual isolation is broken by the chain that links the stools on which they sit. I03 I03. MANUEL ALVAREZ BRAVO Portrait of the Eternal, 193 5 Gelatin silver print, i6. 8 X 24. I cm (6%/ x 91/2 in.) 92.XM.23.30 The photographer has transformed the ordinary act of a woman combing her hair in front of a mirror into an invitation to the viewer to enter into an intimate moment in the life of the model, Isabel Villasefior, and to consider that moment as a reflection of eternity. In this example of the dramatic light that characterizes much of Alvarez Bravo's work, the model is caught between light and profound darkness. Although the titles of his pho- tographs are often enigmatic, with patience they can be deciphered to yield his thoughts about the meaning of the images.</page><page sequence="62">i62 Acquisitions/1992 104. MANUEL ALVAREZ BRAVO The Good Reputationfor Cover, 1939 Three gelatin silver prints, each 8.8 x i8.9 cm (31/2 X 77/K6 in.) 92.XM.23-37 Alvarez Bravo created this unique tri- partite format for this image to serve as the cover for a catalogue of a Surrealist exhibition organized by Andr6 Breton, Wolfgang Paalen, and Cesar Moro in Mexico City. As he has told the story, in response to a request for a cover image telephoned to the San Carlos Academy where he then taught, he sent a model to the roof of the Academy, sent the porter to the market to buy the cacti that sur- round her, and called a doctor friend for the bandages in which she is swathed. Having assembled these elements, he photographed the model on a borrowed blanket, producing an image of inherent contradictions-the soft flesh juxtaposed with the thorny cactus, the model's nudity partially covered but also vul- nerably (and somewhat perversely) uncovered. In the event, this tripartite image was not used as a cover because of fear of censorship, but it has become one of the photographer's most celebrated pictures because of its mysterious and dreamlike qualities.

XM. 23.46 With a great economy of means Alvarez Bravo has structured this austere com- position. Despite its simple elements it has great visual richness. The ingredients are a griddle with shredded, drying tor- tillas; a camisole; a pair of legs in motion; the whitewashed roof against which the first three are seen; and, most important, the adroit camera angle chosen by the photographer. The apparent ordinariness of the material is typical of the photogra- pher's work, as is his transformation of it.</page><page sequence="63">Photographs I63 io6. MANUEL ALVAREZ BRAVO Ladders on the Fishermen's Beach, I989 Three gelatin silver prints (printed by Colette Alvarez Urbajtel), each 20.4 x 25.4 cm (8 x io in.) 92.XM. 104. I-*3 By obscuring and twisting the vantage points of this unusual site Alvarez Bravo evoked the sensibilities of the Surrealist movement, which had influenced him in his youth. Compared with the single, static viewpoint of The Good Reputation for Cover, his only other triptych, this composition conveys a sense of move- ment. Alvarez Bravo's lifelong interest in using light and shade to create abstract patterns is evident. It is possible to think that the ladder leading into air in the right panel may be linked to the elderly artist's thoughts about mortality. IN APPRECIATION In addition to the gifts described above, the Department of Photographs is happy to acknowledge receipt of the following donations: a 1945 portrait by Paul Strand from Naomi and Walter Rosenblum; a group of color laser prints by David Hockney from the artist; eight additional images by Edward Weston (printed by Brett Weston) from Jon B. Lovelace; a group of nine contemporary photo- graphs, mostly of the new American topography, from Professors Joseph and Elaine Monsen; and a group of twenty- one nineteenth-century cabinet cards, stereo views, and album pages from Gene Waddell. i06 (.1) .
