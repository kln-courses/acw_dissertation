Pp. 306. Catania: Universita di Catania, 1989. Paper. This is a very worthy contribution to the duller side of the study of later Neoplatonism, and though not very original, is valuable because of its completeness, thoroughness, and careful organisation of the available material. It is the first complete collection of the Fontes for Plutarch of Athens, the founder and organizer of the Neoplatonic School of Athens (which of course had no connection with Plato's long defunct Academy). It is well done and carefully arranged. As might be expected from recent work, Plutarch emerges as typical of his time and as such not so interesting as if he was in any way exceptional. He was, it seems clear from the sources, a moderate Iamblichean, who placed the new School of Athens firmly in the camp of the ' Syrian' variety of Neoplatonism (where of course we always knew it was from his successors Syrianus and Proclus onwards). Taormina, in her long introduction and extensive commentary, deals effectively with the attempts of Beutler and Evrard to make him more interesting by presenting him as a belated example of the influence of Plotinus and Porphyry. She makes good use of recent work, notably that of H. J. Blumenthal. Ludlow A. H. ARMSTRONG ROBERT TURCAN: Religion Romaine. Part 1: Les Dieux; Part 2: Le Culte. (Iconography of Religions, 17.1.) One volume in two parts. Pp. v + 48 (part 1), v + 39 (part 2); 52 plates in part 1; 52 plates in part 2. Leiden, New York, Copenhagen and Cologne: Brill, 1988. Paper, fl. 96/$ 48. This volume deals with the traditional religion of Rome (i.e. 'state' as opposed to 'mystery' cults, which are considered in other volumes): Part One is concerned with 'the gods', Part Two with' the cult'. The format is that established for other volumes in the series: a brief introductory essay and a copious supply of good-quality illustrations, each with its own catalogue entry (there are 140 entries in Part 1, 97 in Part 2). The items illustrated are in the main statues, reliefs and coins, chosen to show a particular deity or aspect of cult practice. My reservations stem mainly from my doubts about the function and intended audience of the series as a whole. Turcan provides an impressive amount of analysis and detail in his introductory essays, which are both thought-provoking and informative. In Part 1 he first examines the contradictory evidence for aniconism and anthropomorphism in early Roman religion. He then points to the pragmatic approach of the Romans to their religion, which sees each deity as having his/her own competence and attributes: this also tends to the creation of an array of allegories and personifications, and to the placing of deities in a precise location in both space and time. Part 2 looks at the importance of cult in Roman religion, an importance that distinguishes it from other religions. The nature of this cult is explored, especially its contractual aspect, and the terms religio, pietas and cultus are clearly explained. Again, priests, cult equipment and actions (including the nature of the sacrifice) are specific to each god, and this specificity is represented with precision in artistic illustrations of the rites concerned. T.'s description of the sequence of events at sacrifices, well illustrated by his choice of artistic representations, could be a particularly useful section for students of Roman religion and art. T.'s complex understanding of the nature of Roman religion pervades these essays, but they are too short and too compressed. For the non-specialist (or non-Classicist) there is too much left unexplained - while a more detailed exploration of his themes is required for the specialist. The catalogue entries, too, frequently do not give a sufficient explanation of the items illustrated (e.g. why certain gods have particular attributes), and rely too heavily on a sophisticated Latin terminology likely to bewilder the non-Classicist. The format of the Iconography of Religions series demands a study that is over-arching and general in scope, but which at the same time focuses on the minutiae of individual representations. T. has done his best with it. But it remains unclear how one is intended to use this book: as a quick reference for a typical iconographic representation of a particular deity or ritual ? as an introduction to Roman religious iconography 0009-840X/91 $3.00 ?
