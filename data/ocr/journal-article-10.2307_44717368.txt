<plain_text><page sequence="1">720424 A Critical Review of Radar as a Predictive Crash Sensor Trevor 0. Jones, Dale M. Grimes*, and Ronald A. Dork Engineering Staff, General Motors Corp. IT HAS BEEN indicated that some of the hazards of an inflatable passive restraint system can be minimized (1)** with longer inflation times. Improvement (2) may be achieved with some impact sensor schemes up to 30 mph (48 km/h) equivalent barrier impact. Greater improvements, relative to crash sensor time budget considerations, may be achievable through the utilization of predictive or anticipatory sensors. Several anticipatory crash sensors have been evaluated, such as laser, infrared, acoustic, and radar. It is felt that, while none of these in the current state of development can satisfy the requirements of an effective air cushion system crash sensor, radar comes closest to meeting the crash sensor requirements; however, it suffers from the inability to distinguish between hazardous and nonhazardous obstacles relative to commanding an air cushion inflation. The application of radar to the occupant protection system is most attractive for two principal reasons. The first is that it may provide a solution to some of the problems in currently available post-impact sensors, and the second is that it may have the potential for being expanded to the accident avoidance system for such items as automatic braking. It is the purpose of this paper to explore the ad- vantages of an air cushion radar sensor and to expose the many technical problems associated with such an application of microwave technology to vehicles in the near future. ^Professor of Electrical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Mich. **Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of paper. CRASH SENSOR REQUIREMENTS The basic challenge of the sensor is to command an air cushion inflation when an impact exceeding the minimum threshold is occurring or is imminent. Depending upon the particular crash sensor scheme, post-impact sensors utilize from 5 ms to approximately 20 ms of vital post-impact time (2) to receive, process, and transmit crash data during a 30 mph (48 km/h) equivalent fixed barrier impact. For non- barrier crashes of equivalent severity, greater times may be required. The crash sensor is required to make a crash/ noncrash determination with an extremely high degree of certainty, and the consequences of a high rate of inadvertence and failure to fire on command are obvious (1). Inadvertence in post-impact sensors, in general, is derived from two causes. The first is the inability of a sensor to operate precisely at the minimum threshold and not to operate below that minimum threshold during frontal impacts that occur within the angular zone of protection. The second is the translation of large rough-road vertical accelerations into horizontal accelerations which exceed the minimum threshold of the sensor. Each of these conditions, which contribute to inadvertence, may be alleviated by the use of an anticipatory radar crash sensor. However, available predictive radar sensors, when acting as the sole sensing mechanism, can also produce inadvertence; that is, can mistakenly identify safe objects as being dangerous. The purpose of an air cushion crash sensor is to determine the occurrence of a severe impact or an impending impact. Predictive sensors are required to make a decision from three ABSTRACT A general discussion of crash sensor requirements is provided, with emphasis on the advantages of long inflation times. An explanation of the basic radar system is offered, and various designs, broken down both by antenna configuration and carrier modulation, are investigated. After careful study it is found that all radar sensors suffer from the same inadequacy- the inability to correctly classify obstacles into hazardous and nonhazardous categories. Several approaches to solving this problem are discussed. The conclusion is reached that radar crash sensors will be unavailable for MY 1976 air cushion requirements. 1389</page><page sequence="2">1390 T. O. JONES, ET AL. basic parameters, namely, amplitude, velocity, and direction of impact. One of these parameters, amplitude, is more difficult to detect with predictive sensors than with impact sensors. Amplitude, or size of impact, requires an indication of the physical hazard represented by the collision object. To date, no reliable correlation has been developed relating the degree STANDARD SAE BARRIER WITH 30° WEDGE AUTOMOBILE 11 Í Fig. 1 - Barrier test configuration of hazard with processed radar data. This problem was first defined in Ref. 1 , and though analysis and experimentation has continued, no adequate solution has been developed. The next two parameters, velocity and direction of impact, may be provided by the radar system. Precise closing velocity may be derived through Doppler measurement in order to establish the minimum impact velocity threshold. This velocity is derived at approximately 6-10 ft in front of the car, giving rise to an inflation time budget of approximately 180 ms at 30 mph equivalent barrier impact. Longer inflation times are not thought to be practical (3) since gains in pro- tection are reduced by increased inadvertence due to traffic dynamic considerations. The angle of impact protection also has some limitations when using radar due to the placement of the antennas. Current passive restraint system require- ments provide for protection in ±30 deg frontal impact against a barrier, as shown in Fig. 1 . A large fraction of impacts involve the bumper, and, hence, advantages of radar over a simple bumper sensor need to be ascertained for equivalent barrier impacts up to 30 mph (48 km/h). Further- more, some significant angle impacts, due to the limitations of forward looking radar antenna systems, might be missed. Predictive crash sensor requirements can be divided into two basic groups, namely, those requirements which are applicable both to predictive and impact sensors, and those requirements which are unique to predictive sensors. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS - Some aspects of general sensor requirements have been discussed. However, a detailed review of all sensor general requirements is provided in Refs. 1 and 2. For convenience, these requirements are summarized in Tables 1-3. These requirements were rated relative to "importance" in Ref. 4, as shown in Table 4. Translating these requirements to specific quantities for predictive sensors, the quantities shown in Table 5 are derived. SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS - In general, specific require- ments of predictive crash sensors are addressed to the de- scription and definition of the degree of hazard represented by the detected obstacle at the assigned minimum impact velocity. Some aspects of degree of hazards are virtually im- possible to detect; for instance, the manner in which an obstacle is attached to the earth, such as an oil drum used as a Table 1 - Sensor Performance Characteristics 1. Threshold Tolerance - Closing velocity measurement and target density determination to indicate significant impact (pre-or post-crash). 2. Directional Capability - Angular impact detection capability. 3. Operating Time - Minimum detection time to allow maximum inflation time. 4. Dynamic Range - Lower and upper threshold of detection match system capability. 5. Deactivatable. 6. Selectable Location - Freedom of mounting location on the vehicle. 7.

For the purpose of evaluating radar crash sensors, an attempt has been made to quantify hazardous obstacles. Making very subjective judgments, hazard thresholds are taken to be those listed in Table 7. If, in fact, adequate determina- tion as to target threat and size could be derived from the radar system, a sensitivity analysis could then be performed on the quantities and objects shown in Table 7 in an attempt to establish realistic quantities. The system should not respond to or be sensitive to the following conditions and situations: 1. Pedestrians. 2. Opposing vehicle radar. 3. Multi nonhazardous targets. Table 2 - Sensor Reliability 1.

BASIC RADAR SYSTEMS SYSTEM CONSTRAINTS, POWER, GAIN, WAVE- LENGTH - Radar is an acronym for "RAdio Detection And Ranging." Electromagnetic energy is emitted from a trans- mitter, echoed from a target, and, returned to the receiver. For those unfamiliar with radar, the principles may be illuminated using light. The bulb of an automobile headlight (Fig. 2) corresponds to a transmitter. The focusing metal and the lens cover correspond to the transmitting antenna, the operator's eye corresponds to the receiving antenna, and his brain to the receiver and processing circuitry. Next, consider the tone heard from a continuously operated passing horn. As the horn approaches, the tone is higher; as it recedes, the tone is lower. This tonal or frequency shift is the Doppler shift. Light is also subject to a Doppler shift. Consider the light transmitter to be a single-frequency laser rather than the head- light. Laser light illuminates targets and returns to the operator just as the headlight did. When bounced off a moving target, its apparent color will change, just as the tone of the horn changed, and it will change in proportion to relative velocity between the laser and the echoing target.

O. JONES, ET AL. The amount of light returned varies greatly with the target. Polished metal scatters nearly all the light incident upon it. The fraction of the scattered light returned to the operator's eyes depends upon the size and shape of the metal. A black object absorbs most of the incident energy and scatters but little. The driver's ability to perceive an object depends upon the amount of light returned to him, and this in turn depends upon its size, its color, its distance away, etc. It does not depend upon the physical strength of the object. Radar differs from this in only a few ways. The frequency is lower and, therefore, the wavelength is longer. Electronic receivers replace the operator. The shift in frequency is measured and read directly as relative velocity. The operator has two eyes spaced a small distance apart and steerable, which, together with his brain, allows him to estimate range to a target. The radar receiving antennas do not have this flexibility; hence, range must be determined by other means. Since radar wavelengths are longer, they penetrate objects more deeply than does light. Radar is not connected to the human brain. It does not suffer from fatigue, inattention, intoxication, etc., but neither does it contain the grand collection of memory banks and algorithms of the human brain for data analysis which permits value judgments in complex situations. The basic radar range equation is Pr GtG oX2 ĪT Pt = ' 4 0) ĪT Pt (47t) R where: Pt = power transmitted Pr = power returned to receiver Gt = gain of transmitting antenna Gf = gain of receiving antenna R = range, or distance, between radar and target o = target radar cross section X = wavelength of radiation Table 6 - Percent of Frontal Impacts with Nonautomotive Objects Obstacle % of Frontal Impact Trees 15 Poles 3 Embankments 10 Rock ledges 2 Bridges 3 Table 7 - Dangerous Obstacle Thresholds Tree or wood pole 6 in Steel pole 4 in Height above ground &gt; 1 ft Each symbol in the numerator on the right side of Eq€ 1 depends upon wavelength. The equation is correct only if no loss of energy occurs during transit and only if the target is fully illuminated by and immersed in the beam. For radar to function correctly, the power ratio of Eq. 1 must be greater than a given threshold value. The minimum value of Pr processable by the receiver, expressed in dBm, is the receiver sensitivity. The narrower the beam width of an antenna, the larger is its gain. An ideal antenna of aperture A and diameter d will have a beam width 0 = X/d radians and a corresponding gain of c - if X2 (2) X2 For a fixed gain, the necessary antenna diameter decreases linearly with decreasing wavelength. Radar cross section is discussed later, but over a wide type and size of targets, it generally varies with frequency as Xn, where n lies between - 1 and -2. The power ratio of Eq. 1 thus varies with wavelength as F Pt " ~3 X-3 (3) F Pt ~3 X-3 where n = - 1 . Eq. 3 shows that the smaller the wavelength, the larger the fraction of the emitted power will be returned. Therefore, for a fixed receiver sensitivity, the smaller will be the necessary power transmitted. Both antenna size and power return ratios are improved by decreasing the wavelength. There are two things that limit how small the wavelength can be: first, decreasing availability of components and integrated systems with decreasing wave- length; second, interference of aerosols and of rain, snow, dust, etc., with the beam. Clean air atmospheric loss (6) is depicted in Fig. 3.

Fig. 4 shows the attenuation in dB loss/km round trip as a function of wavelength for various rain conditions (7). Both figures show a generally increasing loss with increasing frequencies (decreasing wavelength). For crash sensor require- ments, where the maximum range is 6-10 ft, the atmospheric loss is negligible at all frequencies. A more stringent wavelength constraint is the decreasing availability of components at increasing frequencies. Micro- wave components and techniques are readily available at wavelengths as small as 2 cm, and available to a decreasing extent down through about 8 mm. A further restricted range of components is available to about 4 mm, and only ex- perimental units below that. A basic problem is that com- ponent size tolerances and necessary techniques are determined by the wavelength. Below approximately 4 mm wavelength, component size is so small that components and systems be- come increasingly difficult to manufacture and assemble, and, hence, are very costly. RADAR CROSS SECTION - The radar cross section (RCS) of an object (8) is determined experimentally by evaluating the coefficient a of Eq. 1 . Each of the other parameters can be individually determined. From theory, RCS is most easily viewed as the ratio of the power scattered back toward the receiving antenna to the power per unit area incident on the target from the transmitter. It, therefore, has the dimensions of area. Fig. 5 shows the ratio of the RCS of a perfectly conducting sphere of radius, a, to its geometrical cross- 9 sectional area, 7ra . Small spheres return but little energy, and only when a/X is greater than about 1 does the ratio nearly equal unity. The source of the variation is that when incident radiation strikes the sphere, its fields force currents to flow on the spherical surface. The currents flow completely around the sphere and return. Should they arrive in phase with the driven fields, they sum and produce even larger current flow and, thereby, a maximum in RCS. On the other hand, should they arrive out of phase, they cancel and provide a minimum in RCS. Should the sphere be made of dielectric, instead of a conductor, surface electrical currents are not formed. How- ever, polarization currents do form, and generally in propor- tion to the permittivity of the material. These effective currents flow and qualitatively similar effects to a conductor occur- although the details might be quite different. In general, the RCS will be very much smaller for a dielectric object than for a similar conducting one of the same physical size. 2 The ratio of a/X for a thin wire depends upon the angle between the axis of the wire and the direction of the incident electric field, that is, its polarization. The return is nil if they are perpendicular. If they are parallel, then a/X reaches a maximum of about unity when the wire length is about X/2 and is smaller otherwise. If the wire axis were at 45 deg to the incoming polarization, it would radiate back polarization at an angle of 45 deg. For this case, receiving antennas oriented collinear with and perpendicular to the transmitted field will receive equal returns. The lead edge of a piece of metal acts as a wire.

The cement block wall in Fig. 6, behind which might be anything, gives an effective return of 23 dB. As shown in Fig. 7, the relatively harmless highway department sign of the kind commonly found in the highway environment gave 10 dB more return, that is, 10 times as much power was returned to the receiver from the sign than from the wall. A freshly cut elm log, corresponding to a green or live tree about 6.4 in (16.25 cm) in diameter and potentially disastrous for an automobile to impact, gives a return of 4 dB, or but one-one thousandth as much power return as the relatively harmless sign.

Further discussion of the classification of objects into hazardous and nonhazard- ous categories is presented in the section Advanced System Concepts. The RCS of an object is a complex function of its shape, surface impedance, and size. A conducting target about a wavelength long, or curved to focus the reflected beam from the transmitting antenna to the receiving one, will produce a strong return signal. The diffuse return from a flat, conduct- ing surface comes, in the main, from its edges and not from Fig. 7 - Nonhazardous highway department sign Fig. 8 - Radar cross-section measurement of adult human</page><page sequence="8">1396 T. O. JONES, ET AL. the flat surface itself. The magnitude of the return does not depend, within wide ranges, upon whether the edges are two wires, whether they form the bounds of a sheet of aluminum foil, or the bounds of a steel bridge. About a thousand times lesser return comes from such objects as men, small trees, and wooden utility poles. In general, this situation is made even worse for radar reflection in that although small objects can often be correctly identified when alone in the field-of- view, in a multitarget situation the return from large RCS targets might well mask return from small RCS targets at similar ranges. For example, a lone 6 in tree might be easily spotted by radar; however, that return might well be totally masked by the return from an adjacent, metallic sign. The application of signature analysis to obtain better target dis- crimination is discussed in the above mentioned section. DOPPLER CLOSING VELOCITY - More information is carried in the return echo than merely amplitude. If the target is moving collinearly with the beam, then the echoed frequency will differ slightly from the transmitted frequency. If these two signals are fed together across a nonlinear circuit element, the desired output will be a signal whose frequency is the difference of the carrier and returned ones. That frequency difference, the Doppler frequency, is fd = 2fc cos e (6) where: f = carrier frequency f^ = Doppler frequency v = relative velocity of target with respect to radar c = speed of light 6 = angle between radar beam and relative velocity of target A carrier frequency of 35 GHz will result in a Doppler return frequency of about 105 Hz/mph (66 Hz/km/h) of relative motion. The closing speed can be easily determined by mea- suring the audio frequency, providing the angle 6 is known. RELATIVE CLOSING RANGE - It is also necessary to know target distance, R. To accomplish this, the round trip time of the carrier signal must be determined. There are many ways to accomplish this. The simplest way is to modulate the carrier with a linearly swept frequency, that is, do not use a constant carrier frequency but one with a frequency which increases with time as ßt during the first half cycle, and de- creases at the same rate during the second half cycle, where ß is a preset constant. The echoed signal returns after time t = 2R/c from stationary targets. A mix of transmitted and returned signals across a nonlinear element gives an output signal with frequency ff=0to (7) Doppler information cancels out from such a scheme and generally is not available. SYSTEMS DESCRIPTION - Various designs of predictive sensor radars can be arranged somewhat meaningfully through grouping by antenna configuration and by carrier modulation. The following antenna configurations, shown in Fig. 9, are discussed: 1. Monostatic. 2. Bistatic. 3. Binaural (double Doppler). 4. Cross polarization. In addition, system description can be broken down according to the carrier modulation as follows: 1. Continuous wave (CW). 2. Frequency modulation (FM). 3. Pulse. 4. Noise. 5. Adaptive continuous wave. MONOSTATIC ANTENNAS - A single antenna is used for both transmitting and receiving. Internal components are used to keep the transmitted power out of the receiver, and, often, vice versa. BISTATIC ANTENNAS - Separate, spaced antennas are used for transmitting and for receiving purposes. Antenna sensitivity patterns can be overlapped to provide sensitive detection areas. The areas can be oriented either horizontally, to provide side discrimination, or vertically, to eliminate ground clutter. However, the range of RCS covered by dangerous objects is at least 30 dB. Therefore, the use of such bistatic sensitive areas for target discrimination requires antenna side lobes to be at least 30 dB down. This cannot be done with small, simple antennas. Bistatic antennas must maintain a common frequency and phase lock between horns if the Doppler frequency f^ is to be determined. Therefore, speed can only be determined if internal microwave transmission lines link the two antennas. BINAURAL (DOUBLE DOPPLER) - A binaural system can be used to determine velocity "vector" information. Binaural sonic devices (one example of which is a pair of human ears) often determine direction of the source from the angle of maximum return of the two separated, steerable horns. Antenna steerage appears to be unfeasible for automotive applications, however. Rather, such information can be determined by comparing Doppler returns from the separated horns and using triangulation. Binaural systems require at least one transmitting antenna and at least two receiving. They, therefore, suffer from all the drawbacks of bistatic systems. In addition, they have a multitarget problem in that the device is only useful if it can be ascertained that the two receivers receive their dominant return from the same target and, indeed, from the same point on the same target. This will not be true for such a complicated structure as an auto- mobile under varying range and angle conditions. CROSS POLARIZATION - Cross-polarized transmitters and receivers use perpendicular polarized transmitting and receiving antennas. They have several potential advantages: 1 . Radar signals from oncoming traffic can be attenuated.</page><page sequence="9">RADAR AS PREDICTIVE CRASH SENSOR 1 397 2. Target return is greatly improved from complex targets hidden in fog, dust, rain, snow, etc. 3. Road clutter signals are reduced. 4. There is less RCS fluctuation from complex targets as a function of viewing angle. Point 1 advantage, is more apparent than real, and will not solve the problem of isolating one's own radar from the transmitted signals of radar sets carried by oncoming traffic. A typical cross-polarized radar set can be expected to have an acquisition loss of at least 80-100 dB. Oncoming transmitted beam attenuation will be about 20 dB. Assuming antennas of reasonable size to be properly and carefully aimed, an addi- tional loss of 30 dB may be anticipated. However, antenna misalignment, vehicular bounce, pitch, cross-polarized reflec- tion from the roadway, aerosols, etc., when driving over a typical roadway under likely highway and atmospheric conditions, will greatly reduce this isolation. Therefore, in- coming signals from oncoming traffic 30-50 dB above the receiver sensitivity will be likely. The effect of the intercepted signal will depend upon the design of the radar set and its processing equipment. CONTINUOUS WAVE (CW) MODULATION - A CW radar is simple and relatively inexpensive to build. The returned signal can be used to measure the presence of an obstacle and its relative speed. Although CW operation can be combined with steerable binaural antennas to determine range, such usage does not appear to be feasible in automotive applica- tions. The simultaneous transmission of two CW signals, when coupled with an appropriate analysis of the received signals, can, within certain limits, also be used to determine range. FREQUENCY MODULATION (FM) - As discussed earlier, FM can be used to determine range directly. This can be accomplished with some minor complications over CW systems. Two radar sets operating on similar but different carrier frequencies, one of which is CW and the other swept FM, could use the same antenna(s) and simultaneously determine range and relative speed. PULSE MODULATION - A pulsed system can be constructed within the bounds of reasonable electronic sophistication. A short pulse is transmitted and the delay time between the transmitted pulse and the returned pulse is determined by the receiver circuitry and converted to range. The shorter the pulse, the greater the peak output power must be, and, there- fore, the greater the stress on transmitting components and the greater the necessity for high receiver isolation. However, the shorter the pulse, the greater is possible target isolation, and the greater is the accuracy of the range determination. In this case, speed is determined by differentiating range with respect to time in the receiver circuitry. Doppler readings are not feasible using pulsed radars. NOISE - Noise modulation is a means of determining range using an otherwise CW signal. The carrier is noise modulated. A portion of the output is stored in the system for comparison ANTENNA CONFISCATION I CHARACTERISTICS TRANSMITTER Single Antenna for both Transmitting and Receiving I CIRCULATOR ANTENNA • May have Impact Velocity Threshold from Doppler Frequency RECEIVER 4 # Subject to Level Fluctuations due to Signal - - - - MONOSTATIC Interference from Multi-path Road Bounce - - • Separate Transmitting and Receiving Antennas - - • Sensing Region Formed by Overlap of Beam Patterns ___ • Permits Impact Speed Determination RECEIVER D|Ctati/^V BISTATIC ^ # Antenna System may be Designed to Suppress Amplitude BISTATIC ^ Fluctuations from Multipath Road Bounce RECEIVER 4 • Two Separated Receiving Antennas, one or more 4 transmitting Antenna TRANSMITTER ) ' « Sensing Region Formed by Overlap of Beam Patterns + ^ • Permits Velocity Vector Information RECEIVER 4 O 1 »BINAURAL^ CROSS POLARIZATION • Separate Transmitting and Receiving Antennas TRANSMITTER ► » • Sensing Regions formed by Overlap of Beam Patterns yr • Permits impact speed Determination • Less Susceptibly to Jamming by other Radar Sensors RECEIVER 4 ť jfí I • '-ess Susceptible to Interference from Rain, Snow, and Nr Ground Clutter Fig. 9 - Antenna configurations and characteristics</page><page sequence="10">1398 T. 0. JONES, ET AL. with the modulation of the returned signal. The time for match is measured, and then range and speed determined, as in the pulsed case. Although the transmitter is simple to construct, the necessary receiver is beyond present state-of- the-art using potentially available electronics. ADAPTIVE CW - Adaptive CW modulation appears promis- ing. The transmitted frequencies of oncoming transmitting vehicles are sampled while they are still far away, then the frequency is adjusted to be different from them by a value larger than the receiver bandwidth. The carrier frequency is determined by optimizing within the following constraints: 1. The capabilities, power output, noise level, frequency stability of carrier frequency elements used in the system. 2. Size and pattern requirements imposed upon the antennas. 3. RCS of objects to be observed. 4. Range to which minimum target acquisition is to occur through anticipated atmospheric conditions. 5. Existing or anticipated governmental spectral allocations. A Doppler radar operating somewhere in the frequency range 10-40 GHz with a narrow reception bandwidth will have a small probability of an anticipatory output signal generated by oncoming traffic. Nonetheless, the probability is much greater than zero. If the designer attempts to decrease the inherent probability of such a false firing, no carrier modula- tion, including noise, of a simple self-mixing receiver will help. It must be accompanied by sophisticated electronic circuitry which discriminates between its own transmitted noise and any other noise envelope. Pulsed operation at staggered repetition frequencies will materially reduce intercept probability. The probability of intercept can be made as small as deemed necessary by employment of appropriate adaptive frequency systems. INHERENT PROBLEMS - A potential problem is multiple target acquisition. The potential presence of multiple targets, for example, a bird flying through the sensitive area of a bistatic radar simultaneously with the presence of a piece of steel on the road, might fool the best of systems. Multitarget situations also essentially preclude the use of elementary nonlinear techniques that might otherwise be used to extract both range and speed information. They also make it necessary that multiantenna systems assure that they are examining the same target. The use of multiple radars of different polarization, fre- quencies, antenna configurations, etc., will assist in the com- plex objective of target recognition. Before this recognition can be useful, however, a store of knowledge regarding potentially dangerous and safe highway obstacles must be established and accumulated.

A fully functional radar predictive sensor requires it to differentiate between dangerous targets whose return is 30 dB below the return from other safe ones. BISTATIC RADAR SYSTEM DESCRIPTION A bistatic Doppler radar system as a predictive crash sensor has been tested, and results show that it suffers from the same inadequacies as all radar sensors; namely, correct classification of obstacles into hazardous or nonhazardous categories. The system has performed well in the presence of single obstacles, and has demonstrated that state-of-the-art solid-state microwave sources, which have the potential for low cost, can operate in the automotive environment. DESCRIPTION OF MICROWAVE OR RF SECTION - The microwave section of the system has the following general characteristics: 1 . A microwave Gunn oscillator which produces 20 mW at 35 GHz. 2. Two lens-corrected horn antennas mounted at 45 deg with respect to the front of the vehicle in the horizontal plane. 3. An active volume of sensitivity defined by intersection of antenna radiation patterns. The transmitting and receiving antennas are mounted on opposite sides of the vehicle. The active volume of sensitivity formed by the intersection of their radiation patterns is illustrated in Fig. 10. Radiation at 35 GHz appears to have the following advantages over lower frequencies: reduction of ground clutter; the use of small size antennas; suppression of side-lobes; and higher percentage of diffuse scattering. Several antenna configurations were examined experimen- tally before two identical units with aperture dimensions of 5 X 1 .75 cm (5.9 X 2X) were chosen. The lenses are used for phase compensation at the aperture. The antenna units are mounted in the parking light lenses of a 1971 Cadillac Eldorado, as shown in Fig. 1 1, with the 5 cm dimension vertical. The vertical pattern was sufficiently narrow to keep ground clutter negligible. The horizontal pattern of each antenna is about ±30 deg wide, giving protection over one car width, as shown in Fig. 10. The field (power) contours shown in Fig. 10 indicate that coverage is provided for about one car width to about 2-3 m ahead of the car, provided the target cross section is adequate to cause a Doppler signal when it is located on the 12 dB contour. These tests were conducted statically. Later dynamic tests, conducted by impacting an aluminum Fig. 1 1 - Antenna system mounted in vehicle</page><page sequence="12">1400 T. 0. JONES, ET AL. foil screen about the size of a car's front-end cross section, showed that the - 12 dB contour is roughly the locus of points at which Doppler triggering is obtained. The centerline of the two beams is 66 cm above the ground. No field was detected at 30 cm above and below the centerline, up to 3 m in front of the car. Dynamic tests confirmed the absence of ground clutter, as shown in Fig. 12. In the test shown in Fig. 12, the radar vehicle was driven toward a stop sign with a closing speed in excess of the thresh- old velocity. The sign was situated on a metal post approxi- mately the same height as the radar antennas. Note that triggering occurred approximately 3 m in front of the vehicle, and also the suppression of signal level fluctuations, due to multipath road bounce. A block diagram of the microwave portion of the system is shown in Fig. 13. The power to the Gunn oscillator comes from the car battery via a regulator and suppression circuit, Fig. 12 - Recording of peak detected Doppler signal showing absence of ground clutter which ensures that the oscillator is protected from voltage surges on the 12 V line. A portion of the transmitter power is monitored by a microwave detector diode. A d-c milliammeter provides a visual observation of system operation. The major part of the transmitter power is directed to the transmitter antenna. A small part of it is fed to a balanced mixer and functions as the local oscillator. The microwave signal from the receiver antenna is fed to the other input of the balanced mixer. The low-frequency output of the balanced mixer is the Doppler-shifted signal and is fed via coaxial cable to the electronic unit located in the passenger compartment. DESCRIPTION OF DOPPLER SIGNAL PROCESSOR - The electronic signal processor has as its input the Doppler-shifted output described in the previous section. The block diagram is shown in Fig. 14. The processor has these general charac- teristics: impact velocity discrimination, and target/noise discrimination. The processor unit consists of a Doppler amplifier, a threshold level set, a frequency-to-voltage converter, and a velocity threshold set. The amplifier has a bandpass between 500 Hz and 9 KHz, corresponding to closing velocities of about 5-100 mph (8-160 km/h). Once the Doppler signal amplitude exceeds some arbitrarily set threshold level, the frequency-to-voltage converter is activated. It triggers the system, providing only that the frequency (closing velocity) exceeds a preset value. No provision was made for providing velocity readout, since, in this system, as in all bistatic systems, the interpretation of Doppler shift in terms of closing velocity is somewhat ambiguous. This is best illustrated in Fig. 15, for the case of a head-on collision. If it is assumed that the radar car is at rest, and the colliding car has closing velocity V , the mea- sured Doppler shift in the bistatic radar is given in Eq. 6.

TEST RESULTS - This system has been tested using some 75 different highway obstacles as targets, including a full scale 30 mph (48 km/h) barrier impact with air cushion in- flation. The following conclusions can be drawn from the tests: 1 . The amplitude of the Doppler return signal is not indicative of the degree of physical hazard, that is, a large tree appears much smaller than a standard "stop" sign. 2. Triggering distance varies between 2 and 4 m, depending on the RCS. 3. Occupant severity indexes are reduced under conditions of pre-impact detonation. 4. A radar signature analysis of all highway environment obstacles is necessary to assess the degree of physical hazard. Figs. 16-18 illustrate quite clearly that the physical mass of the obstacle does not correlate with the amplitude of the Doppler return. Rather, the amplitude of the return signal is a function of: the obstacle's physical dimensions, the obstacle's surface contours, or the obstacle's surface impedance or "skin depth." Fig. 16, a typical stop sign, shows a radar return nearly as large as the full size automobile in Fig. 18, and orders of magnitude greater than the 15 in (38 cm) diameter tree in Fig. 17. It should be noted that in order to obtain a radar trigger signal for the 15 in (38 cm) diameter tree, the threshold comparator in the signal processor was required to be extremely sensitive.

JONES, ET AL. In essence, the return signal amplitude is a measure of the ability, or, rather, efficiency, of the obstacle to scatter the impinging microwave energy in the direction of the receiving antenna, and, therefore, cannot be related to the obstacle's physical mass. These signatures, which are the peak-detected amplitudes of the Doppler carrier, were obtained by driving the radar vehicle toward the obstacle at approximately 5 mph (8 km/h). In many instances, considerable variation of the signature was observed merely due to the degree of braking of the radar vehicle. In the 30 mph (48 km/h) full-scale barrier test the system responded very well, and based on the occupant severity indexes (S.I.), the crash was described as survivable. Deploy- ment occurred 125 ms (2 m) prior to impact. A time history of the test is shown in Fig. 19. Three 50th percentile anthropomorphic male dummies were located in the front seat. The driver was not instrumented and Fig. 22 - Typical relationship of head severity index as a function of air cushion deployment time was restrained by a loose lap belt. The center front and right front dummies, with no lap belts, had triaxial accelerometers in the head and chest. Preliminary data review indicated the following: 1 . Center front dummy - head, 229 S.I., 35 g peak resultant acceleration; chest, 208 S.I., 40 g peak resultant acceleration; femur, 1 100 lb right, 1200 lb left. 2. Right front dummy -head, 417 S.I., 45 g peak resultant acceleration; chest, 250 S.I., 35 g peak resultant acceleration; femur, 1200 lb right, 1000 lb left. The test vehicle is shown at the barrier site in Figs. 20 and 21 . The antenna installation can be seen in Fig. 20. PROBLEM AREAS - The disadvantages of the system as it presently exists are: susceptibility to jamming, lack of velocity vector information, and inability to assess the degree of physical hazard. There are various degrees of sophistication which can be readily added, such as measuring the closing range and predict- ing the time to impact, but there is one very important and serious fault which all radar sensors possess, that is, the in- ability to reliably predict the degree of physical hazard of the collision. ADVANCED SYSTEM CONCEPTS Relative to occupant protection up to 30 mph (48 km/h) equivalent barrier impacts, it can be seen from Fig. 22 (2) that even a satisfactory predictive radar crash sensor offers little or no improvement over a bumper sensor with a response time of 5 ms. However, it is anticipated that it will be necessary to utilize predictive crash sensing in order to derive the potential benefits of an air cushion system for higher speed (50 mph, 80 km/h) impacts. Any combined predictive/post-impact crash sensor system will always perform at the level con- Fig. 23 - Probability distributions for hazardous/nonhazardous categories</page><page sequence="17">RADAR AS PREDICTIVE CRASH SENSOR 1 405 sistent with the slowest operating detector. For this reason, development objectives have been directed toward obstacle definition. As previously stated, the lack of this capability renders the predictive radar crash sensor impractical. Several approaches to this problem are described in this section. DYNAMIC RADAR SIGNATURE ANALYSIS - One ap- proach to determining the degree of hazard represented by an obstacle is by comparison with categorized empirical radar signatures. This approach is similar in principle to that used by the military in its radar-controlled missile interception system, where decoys and incoming warheads are detected and distinguished. The application of such techniques to automotive radar systems obviously necessitates the capability of a computer. In hopes of accomplishing a reliable assessment, a program of empirical signature analysis and hardware development has been initiated which takes over 300 different dynamic radar signatures of various highway environment obstacles as learn- ing data, and, with the use of the computer, sorts them as to their differences and similarities. It then develops an algorithm which classifies the obstacles into one of two categories: hazardous, and nonhazardous. This concept is depicted in Fig. 23. This study of signature physics has been prompted by con- sidering how the driver of a car performs the discrimination when his brain receives the signature as seen through his eyes. First one must realize that the signature is made up of many properties. In particular, the human eye senses the reflec- tivity, the size, the shape, the texture, the color, and even the dynamics of the target to reach a final decision regarding the degree of hazard. Even with all of these inputs the human brain can be fooled, as in the case of a break-away pole versus a nonbreak-away pole, or a filled oil drum versus an empty one. Similarly, the discrimination algorithm may also be fooled; however, the point to be emphasized is that nearly all the properties of a signature which the human brain uses to arrive at a discrimination decision are also used in the deriva- tion of the discrimination algorithm. If the human brain were forced to separate safe from dangerous objects based on a single property such as the reflected intensity as measured by a light meter, no amount of learning experience would be adequate to describe the differ- ence between dangerous and safe objects. For example, con- sider a person trying to discriminate between a 0.2 in (5 mm) aluminum foil wall and a 2 in (5 cm) thick aluminum wall. The light meter readings would be extremely confusing. However, the human brain soon learns to recognize the crinkly texture and the dynamics associated with the aluminum foil and the fact that this does not occur with the thick aluminum wall. The radar system alone can act only as the "eyes" of the decision-making process. What we hope to add now is the "brain." To date, preliminary concept feasibility has been established and the hardware development stage to implement a prototype algorithm is being initiated. A testing program is planned to optimize the algorithm. "Concept feasibility" here is defined as the capability of the analysis technique to successfully categorize all of the signatures in the learning data into the hazardous/nonhazardous categories. A simplified system diagram of a dynamic signature analysis predictive radar crash sensor is shown in Fig. 24. COMBINED RADAR AND LASER PREDICTIVE CRASH SENSOR - The inability of radar to measure precisely the size of an obstacle is a major drawback to its usefulness as a predictive crash sensor. It is, however, possible to measure the size of obstacles more precisely with the utilization of laser technology. A combined radar and laser sensor provides some improvement over a pure radar crash sensor in being able to make a hazardous/nonhazardous determination of an obstacle. The laser in this scheme consists of low power single or multiple emitters (Fig. 25) which illuminates any obstacle in the range of interest in front of the vehicle. Narrow angle detectors can receive signals from obstacles in front of the vehicle. The detectors and emitters may be displaced geometrically in order to establish a unique zone of interest. A beam width at the range of interest (2 m) is equivalent to a target size of no interest relative to commanding an air cushion inflation. The detector circuits (Fig. 26) are con- tinuously sampled at a high rate in a sequential manner. The existence of an obstacle in three or more adjacent beams would indicate a hazardous obstacle. These data are com- bined with radar data (Fig. 27) in an "and" gate to provide the necessary decision on commanding an air cushion infla- tion. From such a system, a high level of inflation can be commanded, based upon target size and impact velocity. Such a system adds a degree of complexity and also does not com- pletely solve the correlation of target size to physical hazard. COMBINED RADAR AND POST-IMPACT CRASH Fig. 24 - Simplified system diagram of dynamic signature analysis sensor</page><page sequence="18">1406 T. 0. JONES, ET AL. SENSORS - This combination may be used in two ways. The first system, Fig. 28, utilizes the radar to ascertain an im- pending crash and requires confirmation of impact prior to issuing an air cushion inflation command. The advantage of such a system would be the ability to establish a precise velocity threshold, thus providing good, rough road inad- vertent firing, immunity. The basic disadvantage is that the combined system cannot provide a firing command any faster than the speed of the post-impact detector. The second approach is to use post-impact sensors in parallel with the radar predictive sensor. Two levels of actuation may be commanded in this scheme (Fig. 29). The radar would be used for high-speed protection and the post- impact sensor for low-level impacts.

Fig. 30 illustrates quite clearly the tremendous advances that have taken place since the mid-1950s in the area of noise, size, power generation, and system integration. During the last five years years microwave technology has witnessed drastic reductions in the size and weight of micro- wave circuits, made possible by an extensive use of integrated electronics. Today it is not uncommon to see complete microwave transmitters and receivers on substrates 1/4 X 1/2 in. This is shown magnified several times in Fig. 31 .

These devices are extremely reliable since there are no moving or heated parts to wear out or decay with time. Many of these devices operate from d-c voltage levels convenient for auto- motive use. Furthermore, they can function as their own local oscillator and, if necessary, their own mixer and detector as well. This may be referred to as the "new generation" in microwave technology, in contrast to the expensive waveguide "plumbing" of yesteryear. Most of the present activity in the field of microwave integrated circuits arises from developments in several related areas. The requirement of small, cheap, and reliable modules, such as transmitter-receiver units and their associated com- ponents, has obvious applications of adaptive radar for automobiles, in which many active channels are time-shared to achieve system flexibility with complex data processing capabilities. Hence, the development of microstrip trans- mission line circuits to replace conventional waveguide and coaxial systems. The most common module type is based, at present, on hydride/thin film techniques with chip devices mounted on a metallized ceramic substrate.

This advancing technology encourages one to envision the future automobile as having a central microwave system, performing multiple functions such as impact sensing, auto- matic braking, headway control, speed sensing, and several others, with the processing circuitry time-shared to perform these various functions. However, at this point in time, a system for crash sensing with the capacity to discriminate between hazard levels has not been developed. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS To date, General Motors has engaged in considerable effort in an attempt to analyze and solve the problems associated with predictive crash sensors. The work has essentially been divided into three phases. The first phase was to establish radar sensor requirements and to consider various types of radar which would satisfy these requirements. Conclusions reached during Phase 1 were pessimistic. The automobile environment is, for the most part, the most complex environ- ment in which any electronic system is required to operate. Assessing the degree of hazard of an impending collision with an acceptable degree of reliability by a radar system has yet to be proved. For example, a typical street sign looks to be a thousand times larger than a 15 in (38 cm) diameter tree when viewed by a radar system. Obstacle identification is particu- larly difficult when multiple targets lie at the same range. In the second phase, the simplest form of radar, a CW bistatic system, was implemented to demonstrate its ability against single threatening targets. Extensive tests were per- formed using this simple system including a full-scale barrier impact in which the air bag was deployed prior to collision. Several radar signatures of various highway environment obstacles, including several automobiles, were observed and essentially confirmed the analysis conducted during Phase 1 . The third phase is a program of dynamic signature analysis which has promise of assessing the degree of physical hazard, at least to the extent that, in the great majority of cases, the advantages of predictive sensing may be realized. This is a program of considerable complexity. However, at the present time it appears as the only promising path upon which to embark. In the early stages of this study, it was assumed that the radar would sense potentially dangerous objects as far as 50 ft (15 m) ahead of the protected vehicle. However, it was soon concluded that over this total range a large number of targets would be acquired and, despite an assumed adequate computer capacity, the false alarm rate would be unacceptably high. In subsequent work it was assumed that the acquisition range would be no more than about 10 ft (3 m).

There are no significant differences in the radar signatures among the different polarization angles. The fluctuations are caused by phased cancellations and additions from different portions of the vehicle. Ground clutter was greatly reduced by covering it with a radar absorber.

O. JONES, ET AL. APPENDIX B* CANDIDATE RADAR TYPES Certain basic radar types were considered as candidates for air bag triggering, namely: pulse, CW-bistatic, noise, frequency modulated (FM), and double-Doppler (pulse or FM). With the exception of the last-listed type, these are described earlier in the paper and in standard radar texts (8, 11). The double- Doppler was conceived by one of the authors (Zivanovic) of Ref. 10 as a "miss-distance" indicator. The basic idea is out- lined below. The two radars (1 and 2) (see Fig. B-l) spaced D apart radiate continuously at frequencies Fj and F ^ . For a single target, as shown, the radars will separately measure Doppler frequencies fj and f2 where fj^ = y'lw2' m*ss distance can be expressed as 5 - 5 * (?• &lt;att) (B1&gt; Over a small interval of time (p and 0 fixed) the miss distance can be measured by measuring the normalized Doppler frequency difference between the two radar signals. Using two narrow-beam, synchronously scanned radars with narrow range gates, one can obtain relatively constant p and 0 by examining fixed range gates at fixed angular direction. *The material in Appendix B is based on work done by R. I. Primich, S. Zivanovic, R. A. Hayami, W. E. Blore, and P. E. Robillard of Delco Electronics. The comparative performance of the different radar types is compared in Table B-l in terms of parameters important in the air bag application. In the absence of an accurate description of radar performance in the actual dynamic en- vironment, these comparisons are necessarily qualitative. It can be seen, however, that the simplest, cheapest form of radar (the CW-bistatic system), which would be most attractive from a practical point of view, is inadequate to cope with a realistic, multiple-threat situation.

On the other hand, fairly sophisticated radar types (pulse, FM, or double-Doppler) would be needed to handle the multiple-threat environment. These would probably be prohibitively expensive. Further detailed con- sideration shows that this type of radar would have to provide, as a minimum, the electrical equivalent of a PPI type display. Although this task is certainly feasible, its economic practi- cality has yet to be proved. The output, however, would have to be processed together with certain, a priori, decision criteria to provide the air bag input trigger. The form of the radar output, together with the decision criteria, could be obtained only from an extensive experimental program in which the effects of typical environ- ments-such as clutter due to roads, trees, poles, etc., as well as potential threats as seen by potentially suitable radar types- would be investigated. The high cost of this type of radar, together with uncertainties in expected performance, preclude its use as the input to an air bag trigger, unless multiple uses for the radar can be identified which would justify an extensive engineering program.</page></plain_text>
