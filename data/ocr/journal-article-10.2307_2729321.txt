Tucson: Pallas Press, 1994. Pp. viii, 87. Paper. ISBN 1-882969- 18-9. JEL 95-0006 The nonhuman societies Gordon Tullock investigates are: ants, termites, bees, mole rats, sponges, and slime molds. Tullock asks the fundamental question of how the activi- ties of the individual organism are coordin- ated in these nonhuman economies. These societies face a problem similar to the pris- oner's dilemma: an individual organism would be better off "shirking" or acting "selfishly," but if all the individuals did that society and the individual would not exist. Modern biol- ogy takes as given that individual organisms are "selfish" (they do not act for the good of the species/group/society): a gene for "altru- ism" (sacrificing one's self) will always lose out in the evolutionary race for genetic sur- vival against a "selfish" gene. But nonhuman societies and economies do exist and survive. Millions of individual organisms, presumably selfish, overcome the prisoner's dilemma and do cooperate in undertaking the myriad of tasks that are necessary for the survival of their society. Yet these organisms have very few neurons in their brains. ("It must be re- membered, however, that an ant has a very limited brain, even more limited than a col- lege student, impossible though that some- times seems"; p. 36.) Indeed, slime molds and sponges do not have what are normally re- ferred to as "brains." So how are the behav- iors of the constituent organisms coordinated such that their societies survive? This is an intriguing puzzle. Take the Afri- can termite for example. The termite nest has to be kept clean and dry, to have a constant (within a degree or two) temperature, has to have the proper amount of humidity and carbon dioxide, the king and queen must be fed as must the grubs, and a variety of other tasks must be taken care of if the society is to survive. The royal pair do not control the ac- tivities of the other termites, and, more accu- rately it is probably the activities of the other termites that control the royal pair. But what is the mechanism? Given the very limited neural capacity of the termite and the com- plexity of the tasks that have to be done, the responses cannot be preprogrammed into the individual termite's brain. Tullock's answer is that each organism is programmed according to a preference func- tion that is similar to the utility function that economists postulate for humans. By way of example he specifies a simple model of a ter- mite preference function that contains two arguments: food and a clean nest. Each argu- ment is subject to diminishing marginal util- ity. Now, if food is in short supply, large num- bers of termites will "automatically" shift from nest repair to food gathering, and vice versa. Each termite, by its own action, slightly changes the environment for the other termites, thus as each termite acts the seemingly flawless coordination of termite so- ciety is achieved. Consequently, evolution works through the selection of the individual organism's preference function. This is an elegant and ingenious solution to an interesting problem. But how relevant is this problem to the economics of human so- cieties? Tullock's answer to this question is that it is not very relevant at all. He contends that human social interaction is massively more compli- cated . . . so that most of the traits and char- acteristics of that earlier society . . . are now buried and have little or no effect upon our behavior.

(If this did not occur we would not observe beggars.) Compare this behavior to an ant transferring food to another ant: Are our behaviors or preferences that different? Humans and ants act similarly in this sce- nario: Why? I believe that the answers to these ques- tions are embedded in evolutionary selection that has affected all organisms since life's pri- mordial beginnings. Thus, the study of non- human preference systems may have non- trivial lessons for the study of human preferences. The modest claims of Gordon Tullock for his recent contribution are too modest. If we want to investigate the hows and whys of human behaviors, and how and why societies change overtime-the signifi- cant questions in the social sciences-think- ing about nonhuman societies may allow us to escape anthropomorphic myopia. This is a well written, witty book easily ac- cessible to economists, biologists, and under- graduates (in spite of Tullock's doubts). The lack of an index is a handicap but not a major one for a slim volume that is educational and entertaining. It is a pleasant way to stretch one's thinking on societies and economies, both human and nonhuman. PHILIP R. P. COELHO Ball State University</page></plain_text>
