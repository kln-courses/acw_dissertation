Recendy, some have begun to ac tively question that stance. Challenges are found in new theoretical ideas and in empirical study?experimental, field, and survey data on people's attitudes and behaviors toward nonhumans. Such developments are leading many scholars to carve out a more central role for animals, objects, images, and both memories and projections of the self and others in the study of social interaction. In this article, I review these innovative ideas, pursuing four specific tasks. First, I briefly review the theoretical grounds that eliminated nonhumans from studies of social interaction. Next, I present new theories and empirical studies that con struct a role for nonhumans in social interaction. Third, I review surveys that document popular perceptions of human/nonhuman interaction.

Within this endeavor, soci ologists have attended almost exclusively to exchange between humans. But in the past quarter century, some are actively question ing such human-only restrictions. Many of these questions can be found in new theoretical ideas; others are rooted in empirical studies? experimental, field, and survey data on opin ions, attitudes, and behaviors people express to ward nonhumans. Such developments are lead ing many scholars to argue for revisions in our approach to social interaction. They suggest that nonhumans?including animals, objects, images, and both memories and projections of the self and others?enter our analytic frame. In this review, I examine these innovative ideas, pursuing four specific tasks. First, I briefly review the theoretical grounds that specifically eliminated nonhumans in the study of social in teraction. Next, I explore several recent chal lenges to those traditional ideas, presenting new theories and empirical studies that construct a role for nonhumans in social interaction. Third, I review surveys that document popular percep tions of human/nonhuman interactions. I con clude by proposing some conceptual guidelines that might bring nonhumans into our contem porary analytic frames. THE HUMAN-ONLY TRADITION Sociologists' exclusion of nonhumans from the study of social interaction has a long, docu mentale history. Most social theorists have argued that social interaction requires certain capabilities?capabilities that only humans pos sess. Weber (1947), for example, contended that consciousness?what we typically think of as engaged awareness?is critical to any one involved in social interaction. For Weber, those who lack this quality are merely reac tive and hence involved in something nonsocial. Weber's position specifically excludes animals, objects, and other nonhuman entities from en gaging in social interaction. Interestingly, it ex cludes many humans as well: reactive humans; habituating humans; fatigued, sleeping, or co matose humans; and humans in the grips of euphoria (Weber 1947, p. 94). By Weber's defi nition, should I collide with someone while ab sentmindedly strolling to my office, I am not engaged in social interaction. I enter that do main only when I take note of my actions and converse with my victim about them. Most theorists also argued that intention is critical to those engaged in social interaction. We can think of intention as the ability to tar get one's actions in ways that alter situations and maximize the achievement of goals. Like con sciousness, intention was commonly linked to human capacities. Parsons (1937, p. 47), for ex ample, was unequivocal on this point, arguing that behavior in nonhuman organisms was ge netically programmed and therefore lacked the essential mindedness required for goal-oriented interaction. Goffman (1959) adopted the same restriction, viewing nonhuman entities such as animals, objects, or cognitive constructs (i.e., memories, fantasies, projections) as props uti lized by humans to enhance one's desired per formance. From this perspective, one does not talk to a friend's dog because one perceives a true interaction. One utilizes the dog as a prop to gain favor with its owner or to create brackets and pauses within social interaction. Self-identity represents a third characteris tic typically expected of those involved in so cial interaction. We can think of self-identity as a reflexiveness that results in the recognition of one's personhood?an understanding of who one is with reference to biography and situation. For theorists such as Mead (1934) or Goffman (1959), self-identity was necessarily restricted to humans because nonhumans lack the "I" so critical to the reflexive process. Thus, the cat or the robot who reflects on its image in a mir ror cannot recognize that image as its own or endow it with the qualities of its self. Similarly, a child's toy or imaginary friend, endowed by the child with a sense of self, possesses a pseu doself that is little more than a projection of 5^2 Cerulo</page><page sequence="3">its owner. For most theorists, only humans, via the body's cognitive and affective capabilities, can see themselves as entities capable of social interaction. Other-orientation represents a fourth com monly cited quality expected of those engaged in social interaction. Theorists have argued that social interactants cannot merely observe the world around them; they must plan to affect a response. As Schutz (1967, pp. 147-48) put it, "I must have anticipated in phantasy [sk] in the project of my act (in the future perfect tense) the conscious experiences to be brought about in the Other either as my final goal or as one of my intermediate goals." Without such other-directedness, interaction is not fully so cial, but is merely an internalized discussion with the self. Other-directedness, like the previ ously discussed criteria, is typically discussed as a uniquely human characteristic. Mead (1934) argued, "It is possible for inanimate objects, no less than other human organisms to form parts of the generalized other for any given human in dividual." But these nonhuman entities are litde more than objects for the actor to "act toward" or "respond to" in service of the development of self (Mead 1934, p. 154, note 7). Because non human entities are thought incapable of taking the role of the other, they are also thought in capable of social interaction. One final element of social interaction in volves participants' ability to actively negotiate and define interactive situations, developing shared interpretations of values, norms, or sentiments. Communication via language is typically forwarded as the currency of such negotiations, although gestures, signs, and other symbolic forms are also acknowledged. These symbol systems form the basis of re flexiveness; they free individuals to see various possibilities of social interaction, to understand past and present in developing social agendas. Traditionally, theories of symbolic communi cation support the human-only restrictions on interaction. Mead (1934, p. 124), for example, specified that language "differentiates the action of the reflectively intelligent being from the conduct of lower forms." Habermas, too, saw language as a uniquely human facet of interaction, defining communicative action, as a by-product of the communicative rationality inherent in human speech. "What raises us out of nature is the only thing whose nature we can know: language" (Habermas 1971, p. 314; see also Habermas 2003). Traditionally, these five criteria have encour aged a human-only approach to social inter action. The theorists cited in this section are but a small portion of the classical and con temporary thinkers who endorse this position. (For other central examples, see e.g., Berger &amp; Luckmann 1967, Blumer 1969, Bourdieu 1972, Collins 2004, Durkheim 1965 [1915], Garfinkel 1967, Homans 1974, Luhmann 1984, Simmel 1949.) Among those who prioritize interaction as a vehicle to understanding the social, the ma jority define such exchange as a strictly human endeavor. CHALLENGES TO THE HUMAN-ONLY TRADITION In the past quarter century several theorists have begun to actively question the human-only restrictions placed on social interactants. Each of these theories, and the empirical studies they have spurred, challenge or redefine the capabil ities expected of those engaged in social interac tion. In so doing, these literatures suggest new and interesting ways by which nonhumans can be legitimately drawn into our analytic frame. Actor-Network Theory and Nonhumans Actor-network theory (ANT) is an ambitious model designed to account for the essence of societies. Primarily, the theory forwards con siderations of networks and the social con nections, relationships, and exchanges that oc cur within them. But the theory's originators, Call?n (1986,1987), Latour (1987,1988,1996, 1999, 2005), and Law (1987, 1992), aspire to do much more. Rather than simply adding con siderations of social networks to broader social theory, these scholars use networks as a means Social interactant: an entity engaged in social interaction ANT (actor-network theory): theory that maps the social relations between people, objects, and ideas, treating all as agentic entities that form a broad network www.annualreviews.org ? Nonhumans in Social Interaction 533</page><page sequence="4">Actant: term used in ANT to refer to any independent entity?human or nonhuman?that can acquire the ability to make things happen for rebuilding social theory's very core. The result is a rich, distinctive model that weaves together threads of material semiotics, eth nomethodology, and situational analysis. In so doing, ANT offers a novel view both of social interaction and of those who can legitimately participate in it. The ANT project begins by redefining the social. For these theorists, the social con sists of patterned networks of heterogeneous materials (Call?n 1987, p. 93; Law 1987, p. 111). These heterogeneous materials are called actants, and according to ANT, actants connect, forming alliances and associations that result in an actor-network. The theory's next step comes in reconcep tualizing social interaction. To understand the reformulation, we must further elaborate the concept of an actant. In ANT, an actant is any independent entity that, at any time, can ac quire the ability to make things happen within the actor-network. The actant need not intend to make things happen; it need not be conscious of what has happened or become reflexive about the action. Indeed, the things an actant makes happen may not involve any of the special ca pabilities typically tied to humanness. It is the initiation of the action-reaction chain that is key, not the motivations behind it. Thus, your doorbell, while typically defined as an object or prop in other theories, becomes an actant in ANT. This is because the doorbell, once it rings, engages you; it requires you to answer or ignore it, to make a decision and respond. This idea is important, for it means that ac tants are not specified simply by what they are? human versus nonhuman. Rather, actants are specified by what they do and with, through, or about whom or what they interact. In ANT, actants can be human; they can be collectives such as groups and organizations. But actants can also include nonhuman entities such as ani mals, objects, (i.e., machines, computers, cloth ing, money), text and other symbols, or men tal concepts (i.e., memories, projections, ideas). "An actant can literally be anything provided it is granted to be the source of an action" (Latour 1997). But how can nonhuman entities, particu larly inanimate objects?be the source of ac tion? Call?n (1986) contends that this happens when a set of key actants?what he calls fo cal actants?initiates a four-stage process called translation. In stage one of translation, focal ac tants in the network execute three tasks: They negotiate and define the problem at hand, they identify the actants (human and nonhuman) rel evant to its solution, and they make themselves indispensable to all solution-oriented strate gies. In stage two, focal actants work to dif fuse the issues, actants, and strategies just ar ticulated; they also work to make these things acceptable to the rest of the network. Stage three involves the creation of stable alliances built around the newly defined reality. In the final stage of translation, network consensus ensues around the newly defined reality. The network moves beyond acceptance and toward enactment. When the process of translation is complete, human and nonhuman alike become interlocking units?parts that, together, form a coherent whole. From that point forward, one's legitimacy in social interaction derives from relationships?from actants' doing in con cert, from their results, from their connections and their functional positions in the network. One is an actant?human or nonhuman?if one contributes to the form and function of the network. These ideas represent an important break with traditional ideas on social interaction? particularly with ideas on who or what can le gitimately engage in it. Here, nonhumans are something much more than props. Animals, ob jects, texts, cognitive images, etc., mediate in teraction in ways as significant as those of hu mans. When scientists study the contents of a test tube or observe a cell through a mi croscope, when writers link to the works pro duced by their predecessors, when manufactur ers create and disperse goods that are adopted by members of their communities, then the ob server and the observed, the product and its users, form connections that function as criti cal parts of the network. In these scenarios, not all members of the network are conscious or 534 Cerulo</page><page sequence="5">intentional, not all have a sense of self; but all beckon or preclude interaction. All members? human and nonhuman?can make things hap pen (Law 1992). As Latour (1988, p. 150) de scribes it, "No actant is so weak that it cannot enlist another. Then the two join together and become one for a third actant, which they can therefore move more easily. An eddy is formed, and it grows by becoming many others." Interesting empirical research has grown from ANT and provides a blueprint for the inclusion of nonhumans in the study of social interaction. Williams-Jones &amp; Graham (2003) for example, use ANT to explore social, eth ical, and policy issues involved in commercial genetic testing?specifically, controversies surrounding the case of Myriad Genetics and the BRACAnalysis? test. As one might expect, the researchers treat scientists, executives, and government officials as actants in the case. But they treat the genetic test and resulting patents as actants as well. According to Williams-Jones &amp; Graham, these tests and patents are not pas sive; they elicit responses and generate effects on both consumers and public policy. Further, in dealing with genetic testing, scientists, executives, and government officials interact with, through, and about the tests and patents. Thus, it is critical that we treat these nonhuman elements as legitimate interactants. Doing so increases the scope of the network we study and enhances our understanding of interrela tional interests. This, in turn, provides a more nuanced, comprehensive analysis of the social process at hand. In another study, Dant (2004) uses ANT to examine the development of the "driver-car"?a social being that results from a collaboration between human and machine. Similar to Haraway's (1985, 1991) "cyborg," what she defined as a human-animal or human machine hybrid, Dant argues that this "assem blage" is a unique actant, one that has itself introduced new forms of social interaction to society including driving, parking, transport ing, polluting, etc. Because these new forms of interaction have had significant effects on societal development, because they have actually altered the meaning of social fields, Dant contends that the driver-car must be viewed as a legitimate participant in social interaction and hence an important subject for sociological study. Finally, Gomart &amp; Hennion (1999) use ANT to study addiction. Considering both positive addictions (love of music) and negative addictions (love of drugs), their study shows that users can be "seized by objects of their passions.. .passing between active and passive.. .between manipulate' and am manipulated'." Gomart &amp; Hennion argue that in this relationship?this moment of passion?the subject and object are equally important actants. Both contribute to social interaction and thus must be included as equal players in the sociological analysis of addiction. (For additional ANT applications, see Akrich 1992, Hetherington 1999, Mol 1998, Singleton 1998, Turner 2005, Valverde 2005.) Like any radical theory, ANT has its crit ics. Some are unable to accept the symmetry between humans and nonhumans, arguing that human qualities such as intention, reflexive ness, and morality must be viewed as precur sors to all interaction (Hacking 1999a,b; Jones 1996; Lee &amp; Brown 1994; Murdoch 2001). This proves true even for those who accept the idea of material agency (Knappett 2002; Knappett &amp; Malafouris 2008; Pickering 1992, 1993). How ever, ANT proponents do not concede the point, arguing that nonhumans belong in our analytic lens because (a) qualities such as inten tion, reflexiveness, and morality emerge from the network relationships and not from actants themselves (Breslau 2000), and (b) humans and nonhumans need not be treated identically in all situations but only insofar as they contribute to the description of a network (Williams-Jones &amp; Graham 2003). Others have argued that ANT provides thick descriptions of networks while ignoring the social and political aspects of inter active contexts (Collins &amp; Yearly 1992, Fuller 2000, Star 1991, Sturman 2006). ANT propo nents oppose this idea as well, arguing that the thick description offered via ANT "destabilizes the dominant stories and ideologies. By unpack ing that which has been simplified or buried, a rich complex empirical understanding of a case www.annualreviews.org ? Nonhumans in Social Interaction 535</page><page sequence="6">develops that enables sustained social and ethi cal critique" (Williams-Jones &amp; Graham 2003). Whether we agree or disagree with the tenets of ANT, the theory raises critical consid erations for the role of nonhumans in social in teraction. In prioritizing actants' relations over their characteristics, ANT proposes a specific place for nonhumans in sociological analysis. Interactionist Theory and Nonhumans Scholars who identify with the interactionist perspective approach social interaction as an ex ercise in meaning making. Most have argued that this perspective necessarily restricts such analyses to minded human beings. But in re cent years, several researchers have challenged that position. The earliest challenges centered on the con cept of projection. Some interactionists argued that humans can project mind onto nonhumans, seemingly endowing them with human capaci ties. This process allows humans to legitimate nonhumans as viable others in social interac tion. In this regard, Weinberg (1997) studied how mentally ill individuals animated nonhu man objects in their social space. By projecting human capacities onto the objects, these indi viduals felt able to interact with the objects as they would with other humans. Sanders (1993) dissected the projection process by observing dog owners in veterinary clinics. He itemized the specific qualities that humans projected on their pets and the strategies they used to do so. Pollner &amp; McDonald-Wikler (1985) offered similar information, examining the strategies used by family members to project mental and social competence onto their severely retarded children. In recent years, a small group of interac tionists have moved beyond notions of projec tion, suggesting instead that nonhumans are "doing mind" (Owens 2007, p. 568). Cohen (1989) set the groundwork for such thinking, outlining a process by which humans enter into social relationships with nonhumans. Accord ing to Cohen, humans must first take the role of nonhumans; they must then consider the options and constrictions nonhumans present in social exchange; finally, they must presume mutuality in nonhumans. From this perspec tive, it does not matter if nonhumans actu ally possess the human capacities traditionally defined as critical to social interaction. Fur ther, nonhumans are not required to symbol ically communicate with humans or contribute equally to the construction of shared meanings. For social interaction to occur, human inter actants need only assume these potentials in nonhumans. (For related work, see Appadu rai 1986, Csikszentmihalyi &amp; Rochberg-Halton 1981, Hewitt 2003, Kiesler &amp; Kiesler 2004.) Owens (2007) pushes Cohen's argument fur ther with her concept of doing mind. She con tends that social interaction between humans and nonhumans involves both "constructing and forgetting." Owens writes, "I must take the position that this [nonhuman] other exists and acts independently of myself. If I recognize that the object is not other except in my own percep tion, I am chasing my own tail_I must take the role of the other that is actually and only myself and treat this other's portion of the ex change as a unique contribution" (Owens 2007, p. 577). Owens speculates regarding the condi tions under which doing mind is likely to oc cur, thus enabling human/nonhuman interac tion. First, she contends that nonhumans must appear capable of action that is independent of direct human manipulation. Second, she argues that humans must experience nonhumans' ca pacity for independent action under conditions that threaten humans' ability to achieve their desired goals. Finally, humans must experience a certain level of urgency, making their interac tion with nonhumans necessary to goal achieve ment. (See Jerolmack 2005, 2009 for additional theorizing on human/nonhuman interactions.) At present, interactionist studies of hu man and nonhuman exchange are surfacing in studies of the environment and environmental disasters. Here, elements of the environment are being analyzed as legitimate interactants. (See, e.g., Smith &amp; Bugni 2006, Vannini 2008, Weigert 2008.) This approach is also prolifically applied by those exploring the development of 5^6 Cerulo</page><page sequence="7">human-animal intersubjectivity. Alger &amp; Alger (2003), Arluke &amp; Sanders (1996), Irvine (2004a, 2004b), Myers (2003), Sanders (2003, 2006), Wilkie (2005), and Zottarelli (2010) are among those who use various sites?the home, shel ters, testing labs, and workplaces?to address how humans take the role of the animal and construct and deconstruct interspecies bound aries. They also examine how humans and ani mals read one another's gestures and negotiate a social and cultural order that facilitates both intra- and interspecies interaction. Time Perspective Theory and Nonhumans Most theories of social interaction restrict our analysis not simply to humans, but to enti ties that occupy the sensate or concrete world. Some scholars contest these restrictions, ar guing that memories of past selves/others or considerations of future selves/others represent more than cognitive images trapped in the soli tary mind. Rather, past and future entities, un der certain circumstances, may indeed play a role in social interaction. Social psychologists, economists, and sociologists explore such ideas in writings on time perspective. What makes these works important is their underlying im plication, namely, that disembodied entities can enter interactions normally reserved for hu mans situated in physical space. The roots of contemporary time perspec tive theory can be found in phenomenol ogy, existentialism, and symbolic interaction ism; Heidegger, Husserl, Kierkegaard, Koffka, Merleau Ponty, Mead, and Schutz provide the foundation for these ideas. But contem porary work in the area might be most di rectly linked to Lewin's writings on life space (Lewin 1939, 1951, 1997). Lewin defined life space as a psychological field that serves as the center of an individual's needs and experi ences. Life space includes the concrete aspects of one's environment; but more importantly, it includes the subjective meanings attached to those concrete elements. Life space also in cludes imagined elements that derive from one's experience with the concrete?elements such as daydreams, wishful thinking, hallucinations, fantasy, and, most importantly, individuals' past and future time perspectives. Perhaps the best way to think of life space is as a series of in tersecting regions?sensate and cognate, in ternal and external?through which individu als constantly move as they engage in social interaction. The imagined elements of life space were not most central in Lewin 's writings. But these ideas have become pivotal in several contempo rary treatments of social interaction. Philoso phers (e.g., Elster 1984, 2000) and economists (e.g., Loewenstein 2000, Schelling 1984) have created models of rationality and exchange that acknowledge?indeed rely on?the notion that present and future selves (i.e., cognitive repre sentations of one's essence or identity at a par ticular moment or place) are distinct entities that exist in life space and engage in social inter action. One self acts in the life space; the other self interprets that action and responds. The re sult of the exchange has tangible consequences for concrete micro- and macroeconomic sys tems. These scholars speak quite boldly of such interactions as a war of sorts in which the present self must battle the future self for mas tery. Schelling (1984, pp. 84, 86-87) writes, "people act as if they are two selves alternately in command_[T]here is a succession or alterna tion of impermanent selves, each in command part of the time, each with its own needs and desires during the time it is in command, but having?at least some of them?strong prefer ences about what is done during the period that another one is in command." For these theo rists, accurate predictions require one to con sider the interplay between these distinct, tem porally situated selves. Indeed, Loewenstein (2000) argues that such abstract entities, al though difficult to capture, should be included in all decision-making models. In sociology, Emirbayer &amp; Mische (1998) make a related argument, integrating time per spective theory (among many other ideas) into a theory of agency. Their discussion is directly relevant to any inquiry concerned with the Life space: Lewin's term used to refer to a field containing concrete, subjective, and imagined elements; the field serves as the center of an individual's needs and experiences www.annualreviews.org ? Nonhumans in Social Interaction 537</page><page sequence="8">legitimate participants in social interaction. In their writing, Emirbayer &amp; Mische liken past, present, and future to a musical chord. They treat each time period as a site of interaction that provides the distinct compositional tones needed to produce the final harmony of social life (Emirbayer &amp; Mische 1998, p. 972). Ac cording to Emirbayer &amp; Mische, people reflect on these chords and on their position relative to each chordal element, and their actions emerge from considerations of temporal intersections. This observation is important because it sug gests that all human-to-human social interac tion results from a prior exchange?one that oc curs in a temporal plane. There, past and future selves function as relevant situationally vari able "me's"?distinct characters in a narrative that the present-based "I" actively maneuvers and with which it intentionally interacts before engaging others (Emirbayer &amp; Mische 1998, p. 988). Mische (2001, 2009) continues to de velop these ideas, setting an explicit agenda for the study of projectivity, an exploration of the relationship between present- and future-based selves in social interaction. Lewin's ideas on time perspective have been most prolifically applied by social psychologists. Zimbardo (e.g., Epel et al. 1999; Keough et al. 1999; Zimbardo &amp; Boyd 1999,2008; Zimbardo et al. 1997) stands at the forefront of such ef forts, using laboratory settings to document the integrity of distinct, temporally situated selves?selves that individuals perceive to be regularly engaged with one another in social interaction. Initially, these social psychological studies simply explored individuals' identifica tion with past, present, and future selves. In this regard, research showed that those who identified with temporally situated selves as distinct entities thought and behaved differ ently than individuals who viewed past, present, and future selves as integrated parts of a sin gle whole. Studying cognition, for example, Zimbardo found that those who strongly iden tified with one particular self (past, present, or future) tended to be more cognitively rigid than those who experienced a unified self. He also found the particular self with whom his subjects most strongly identified corresponded to spe cific patterns of behavior. For example, those who most strongly identified with their present self often enjoyed the moment, but disregarded risk. Those who most strongly identified with their past self often sought the status quo and were reluctant to deal with new and unfamiliar situations. And those who most strongly identi fied with their future self often engaged in good goal setting and self-control. The aforementioned studies become even more interesting when they move beyond iden tification and explore the idea that people per ceive true social interaction between their past, present, and future selves. When we compare such individuals with those who view their selves as integrated parts of a singular iden tity (and thus incapable of interaction), signif icant behavioral differences emerge. Research on drug users, for example, shows that those who can envision the future self and perceive interactions between present and future selves are more likely to refrain from further substance abuse than those in any other condition?i.e., those who envision the past self and perceive interactions between past and present selves, or those who are strictly oriented to an in tegrated, present-based entity (Keough et al. 1999). Among homeless individuals, those who can envision the future self and perceive inter actions between present and future selves are more likely to enroll in school than those in any other condition (Epel et al. 1999). Research also shows that those who can envision the future self and perceive interactions between present and future selves tend to engage in less risky be haviors than those in any other condition. And those who report envisioning and interacting with a particular kind of future self?one that persists after death?display more rational be haviors than those in any other condition (Boyd &amp; Zimbardo 1997; see also Sanna &amp; Chang (2006) and Strathman &amp; Joireman (2005) for good reviews of similar studies). Importantly, those who envision distinct, temporarily situated selves do not always imagine these selves to be capable of social interaction. Recent research identifies clear 53 8 Cenilo</page><page sequence="9">qualifications surrounding the phenomenon. Pronin and colleagues (Pronin &amp; Ross 2006, Pronin et al. 2008) show that individuals must access the thoughts and feelings of their past and future selves?their internal states at the time periods in question?in order to attribute social interactive capacities to these entities. Those who simply observe their past or future selves, making no attempt to inhabit those en tities, particularly with regard to emotions, ex perience past and future selves as object rather than subject. (See also Libby &amp; Eibach 2002, Nigro &amp; Neisser 1983, Trope &amp; Liberman 2003. For a related sociological perspective, see Denzin 1980.) Theories of Technological Change and Nonhumans When it comes to bringing nonhumans into the study of social interaction, scholars of tech nological change have been especially active. Some have focused on the increased commu nicative capacities of computers, robots, and avatars and what those developments mean for these entities' ability to socially engage with hu mans. Others have focused on the power of new technologies to redefine the temporal and spa tial boundaries of social interaction, allowing imagined entities to enter into social exchange. Such works move far beyond previous ideas on the relationship between humans and tech nology. In the past, social theorists were most concerned with the potential of machines to merge with human bodies and minds. In this re gard, McLuhan (1964) approached technology as something that extended the human nervous system. Years later, Haraway (1985,1991) wrote of the cyborg society, arguing that the relation ship between people and technology had be come so close, so intimate, that it was no longer possible to tell where human beings ended and machines began. Most recendy, Tenner (2003) reflected on the unintended consequences of mundane technologies such as helmets, shoes, and eyeglasses, reviewing the unexpected ways in which these objects change both how our bodies look as well as what we can or cannot do with them. These ideas, while important, are significantly different from the literature reviewed in this section. The works to follow move beyond human and nonhuman mergers. Rather, they treat nonhuman entities?both concrete and imagined?as full and distinct par ticipants in social interaction. Nass (Nass &amp; Brave 2005, Reeves &amp; Nass 1996) stands at the forefront of research ad dressing social interaction between humans and nonhuman objects, specifically comput ers, robots, and avatars. Nass finds that the increased communicative capacities of these techno-objects have had notable effects on peo ple's perceptions of the other. Nass argues that certain types of objects evoke a sense of inter subjectivity in humans, encouraging individuals to respond to such entities in fundamentally so cial ways. As a result, nonhuman objects become an active part of social interaction as opposed to mere props used by humans to enhance or steer social interaction. Over the years, Nass and associates have re visited a number of classic social psychological experiments?experiments that were designed to test person-to-person responses in social interaction. In updating the experiments, the researchers made one critical change. Now, the experiments tested person-to-computer, -robot, or -avatar responses. Results showed that people?even the most technologically sophisticated people?interacted with these entities just as they interacted with humans. Subjects were polite to computers, robots, and avatars; they responded to praise from them, and they viewed them as teammates (Fogg &amp; Nass 1997; Mayer et al. 2006; Nass et al. 1995, 1996; Tzeng 2004). Subjects liked computers, robots, and avatars with personalities or social characteristics similar to their own (Al-Natour et al. 2006, Mayer et al. 2003, Nass &amp; Moon 2000, Nass et al. 1999). They trusted comput ers, robots, and avatars that manifested caring orientations more than those that did not (Brave et al. 2005; Lee et al. 2005, 2007; Pertaub et al. 2002). They found masculine-sounding computers, robots, and avatars extroverted, driven, and intelligent, whereas they judged Avatar: computerized representations of Internet users www.annualreviews.org ? Nonhumans in Social Interaction 55p</page><page sequence="10">Tecfinosynchronicity: a new form of interaction (technology driven) in which historical memories or future imaginings are recreated and engaged in publicly accessible space feminine-sounding computers, robots, and avatars as knowledgeable about love and relationships (Nass et al. 1997, Nass &amp; Moon 2000). They even altered their body posture and mood according to the size and perspective of the screen images before them (Reeves &amp; Nass 1996). In essence, new technologies endowed these objects with critical interactive and communicative capacities, encouraging humans to perceive and react to these entities as legitimate partners in social interaction. (See also Carley &amp; Newell 1994, Cassell &amp; Tartaro 2007, Holtgr?ves et al. 2007, McDonald &amp; Kim 2001, Moon et al. 1997, Moon 2000, Nass &amp; Steuer 1993, Nass et al. 1994, Payr 2001.) Turkle (2007; Turkle et al. 2005, 2006) re ported similar results in her studies of human robot interactions. Turkle studied a special type of robot?those that could recognize their own ers, obey their commands, and adjust their per sonalities in accord with their owners' speech and actions. (AIBO, My Real Baby, Furby, Paro, Cog, iCat, and Healing Partners were among those that met her criteria.) Turkle did exten sive observations of both the elderly and chil dren as they interacted with these robots. She found that subjects responded to the robots in unmistakably social ways. Among the elderly, interacting with robots brought a sense of true companionship; robots also diminished anxiety in those suffering from dementia. Children per ceived and related to robots as "autonomous and almost alive selves" (Turkle et al. 2005). And although the children clearly understood that the robots were not human?an ability Boyer (1996) tells us develops in infancy?the chil dren also identified the robots as fully capable of a meaningful social relationship (Turkle et al. 2005, 2006; Turkle 2007). What explains these responses? Turkle contends that, like humans, these nonhuman entities actively engage hu mans' emotions. "[Robots] seduce us by asking for human nurturance, not intelligence. We're suckers not for realism but for relationships" (quoted in Allis 2004). Thus, in Turkle's work, as well as that of others in the area, robots are not simply objects or props used by individuals to explore the self or others. Rather, robots are entities with whom humans actively exchange and engage, making them legitimate partici pants in social interaction. (See also Bernstein et al. 2007; Breazeal 2002, 2003; Fell-Seifer et al. 2007; Lee 2006; Nanda &amp; Benbasat 2004.) Increasing the capabilities of nonhumans is just one way to involve nonhumans in social interaction. There are other means by which nonhumans can be brought into this venue. Some contend that new technologies are chal lenging the spatial and temporal boundaries of social interaction. In so doing, these technolo gies allow entities that reside in memories, pro jections, and imaginings?humans and nonhu mans alike?to become legitimate participants in social exchange. Cenilo &amp; Ruane (1997), for example, suggest that blurring temporal bound aries facilitates a new form of interaction called "technosynchronicity." Building on Schutz 's (1951) concept of synchronicity, the authors ar gue that new communication technologies af ford more than a shared focus or a merging of the minds. Rather, these technologies make it possible to take what Kant (1957 [1929]) re ferred to as an "an internal intuition" and re produce it in the empirical world of shared, sensory experience. In this way, persons, ob jects, and events once confined to the life of an individual's mental eye can now be projected to others in a way that surpasses mere description. Technology apprehends elements of historical memory or future imagining and recreates them in a publicly accessible space. The authors offer several examples of tech nosynchronicity. In architectural design, for in stance, new technologies allow clients to experi ence an architect's ideas before builders execute the plans. Using a special apparatus, one can walk through a design for a kitchen or office and actually sense the location and interact within it before it achieves material existence. Cenilo &amp; Ruane (1997) contend that this experience al lows architect and client to merge intuitions of the future with present experience, to bring the architect's imaginings direcdy to the consumer in a jointly accessible field of social interaction. In a more abstract example, the authors explore how new medical technologies can synchronize 5^o Cerulo</page><page sequence="11">one body's future with another body's present, facilitating interactions that transcend tempo ral planes. Stem cell transplants, for instance, transport young cells to an aged body. As such, the young cells live out their life in the con fines of the home body's time frame. Similarly, organ transplants allow the body of one in dividual to live on through another individ ual's system. Thinking of such present/future mergers as social interactions may seem sur real at first glance. Yet Cenilo &amp; Ruane ar gue that the heated moral debate surrounding such phenomena signals an increasingly com mon perception: Such mergers represent so cial interactions between two distinct entities. (See also Bielde 1997, Chayko 2002, Isaacson 2002.) SURVEY DATA ON HUMANS, NONHUMANS, AND SOCIAL INTERACTION The preceding literature review argues for the inclusion of nonhumans in social interaction. But it is worth noting that, throughout his tory, many individuals have lived that posi tion. Indeed, animals, deities, and the dead have been central to people's social relation ships worldwide. Social scientists of earlier eras showed litde interest in broadly surveying peo ple's attitudes and behaviors toward nonhuman interactants. But in the past quarter century, attentions have changed. Social scientists are now asking questions about how individuals en vision and interpret nonhumans in interactive settings?including pets, Gods and demons, de ceased loved ones, or technological creations such as avatars. In this section, I summarize some of the most far-reaching surveys that tap Americans' ideas on this issue. Pets In surveys addressing human-animal relation ships, respondents report feelings and actions that cast their pets as legitimate participants in social interaction. Americans, for example, re port intimate bonds with their pets?bonds as strong or stronger than those developed with friends and family members. Surveys show that 85% of dog owners and 78% of cat owners view their pets as fully interacting members of the family. Indeed, 67% of pet owners claim to understand their pet's own language, and 62 % think that pets understand human language. Further, dog owners report feeling closer to their pets than to their mothers (94% versus 87%), and both dog and cat owners report feel ing closer to their pets than to their fathers (94% and 84% versus 74%) (Petside.com 2008, Pew 2006; see also Harris Poll 2007). Pets are so critical to family interactions that 68% per cent of pet owners regularly travel with them, a fact rapidly causing many hotels, restaurants, and service businesses to reconsider their no pet policies (Hoevel 2006). And the strength of these human-pet bonds leads 60% of Amer icans to believe that they will or may reunite with their pets in heaven (Sussman 2007). Feelings of intimacy often translate to eco nomic action. Data on spending show that pur chases for pets are highly similar to those made for human friends and family members. In 2007, Americans spent $43.4 billion on their pets, nearly triple the amount spent 15 years earlier. Those dollars went beyond caretaking factors such as food, water, medical care, or supervision. The money covered things typ ically reserved for human social activities? i.e., clothing, furniture, psychotherapy, health insurance, spa days, playgroups, designer pet homes, vacations, and pet translators (APPA 2008). Deities Recent surveys show that roughly 80% of Americans believe that deities, saints, and an gels are among us performing miracles. About 70% believe in a demonic presence. And 79% of Americans believe that all life forms have a soul that lives on forever and can interact with the living (Black 2007, Blanton 2004, Newport 2007). These data do not indicate a new trend. Such beliefs have existed throughout history. www.annualreviews.org ? Nonhumans in Social Interaction 541</page><page sequence="12">What is new, however, are studies designed to explore how these beliefs translate into action in contemporary social contexts. With regard to deities, for example, recent studies show that those who pray to deities (i.e., God, Allah, Jesus, saints, angels, etc.) treat the exercise as an interactive exchange between two socially situated entities, albeit with one who is nei ther copresent nor human. As such, prayer, like other microinteractions, is heavily influ enced by a human's perception of his or her cointeractant's orientation, capabilities, and in clinations (Barrett 2004; Barrett &amp; Keil 1996; Bender 2008; Gibbon 2008; Jerolmack &amp; Porpora 2004; MacDonald 1995; Orsi 2004; Stark 1999; Wuthnow 1998, 2007, 2008). The social nature of prayer becomes even clearer when we learn about the socially patterned ways in which individuals choose their cointerac tants. Cenilo &amp; Barra (2008) found that indi viduals are not content to let religious doctrine dictate their prayer partners. Here, as in other social interactions, individuals choose cointer actants that are socially similar to themselves. For example, high-power executives choose supreme authorities like God; service workers (e.g., ministers, nurses) choose human-like en tities such as Jesus or the saints. Individuals also pray to those that they believe command the resources best adapted to the task at hand. And individuals choose prayer partners with reference to situational or thematic concerns? e.g., broad, general themes beckon supreme in teractants (i.e., God, Allah, etc.), whereas per sonal trials beckon anthropomorphized entities (Jesus, the saints, etc.). Finally, individuals pre fer to pray to entities with whom they per ceive a long-term relationship?cointeractants who provide the supplicant with a sense of reciprocity. The Dead One-third of Americans believe that ghosts and spirits inhabit the earth. Among those under age 29, that figure increases to 45% (Moore 2005). And 21% of Americans are certain they can communicate with the dead, with an additional 23% willing to entertain the possibility (Lyons 2005). As with deities, these beliefs are not neces sarily new, but studying them via surveys is new. In recent years, researchers began probing how such beliefs translate to behavior. For example, data from the Changing Lives of Older Cou ples study, a Detroit-based study of spousal be reavement among older adults, show that 40% of respondents reported sensing the presence of their deceased spouse, and 18% reported actu ally hearing the spouse making sounds in their homes. The data also show that those reporting such a connection exhibited different behavior patterns than those that did not. Those inter acting with the dead were more likely than oth ers to consider their deceased spouses in deci sion making (69% versus 49%), frequent places that were special to them and their spouse (60% versus 45%), and pursue a strong relationship with God (83% versus 68%). These individuals were also less likely than others to feel lonely most of the time (16% versus 2 2 % ) or empty in side (10% versus 18%). (See also Bonanno et al. 2002,2004; Carr et al. 2006.) Those studying juvenile delinquents report similar findings. Popenoe (1996) contrasts the role of deceased parents to that of parents absent owing to divorce or desertion. He explains, "a dead father is typically a more effective father than one who is missing. When a father dies, his favorable reputation is still maintained; his picture still hangs on the wall; he is still a positive presence, a force, even an arbiter" (Popenoe 1996, p. 152). As a result, children of deceased fathers tend to have higher self-esteem and fewer behavioral problems than children who lose fathers via divorce or aban donment. (See also Bendiksen &amp; Fulton 1975, Berlinsky &amp; Biller 1984, Biblarz &amp; Gottainer 2000, Klass 1992, Pardo 1996, Sigle-Rushton &amp; McLanahan 2004, Tennant 1988.) Avatars In 2008, roughly 100 million people created avatars?residents of online worlds such as Second Life, There, and game-based worlds 5^2 Cenilo</page><page sequence="13">like EverQuest. Surveys show that these users spend over $5 billion annually on their avatars, purchasing online homes, furnishings, businesses, and personal services for them (Macmillan 2007). Some estimates suggest that by 2011 these figures will more than double (Alter 2007). Scholars have done ethnographic studies of avatar communities, treating them as cultural worlds akin to those studied by Malinowski, Meade, or Goffman. These studies document the norms, practices, and values that guide avatar communities (Boellstorff 2008, Guest 2007, Schroeder 2002, Webb 2001). They also study the economics of these worlds, examin ing the asset value of different avatar bodies, issues of avatar design, intellectual property, and norms of economic exchange (Castronova 2004, Klang 2004, Kollock 1999). But in terms of survey data on social interaction, Yee of the Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) leads the way. Yee (2006) spent three years surveying 30,000 users of massively multiuser online role playing games (MMORPGs). His data tell us much about how individuals perceive their online interactions. Yee's data show that hu man/avatar interactions, while recognized as objectively different from human-to-human in teractions, are nevertheless viewed as legitimate social relationships. For example, 39% of men and 53% of women said their friendships with avatars were comparable to or better than those maintained with copresent humans. Indeed, al most a quarter of Yee's respondents identified these human/avatar interactions as the emo tional highlight of their past month's experi ences. Yee also found demographic differences in human/avatar interactions?differences that mirrored patterns found in human-to-human relationships. For example, different things motivated men and women to participate in human-to-avatar interactions. Women's rela tionships were motivated by a desire for social intimacy, whereas men sought task-oriented partners with whom they might achieve socially instrumental goals. FUTURE DIRECTIONS If social life is, in large measure, constructed and not programmed, then sociologists must peri odically consider and revise the focus of their inquiries. The literature reviewed here sug gests that nonhumans play a more prominent, more active role in social interaction than previ ously acknowledged. Thus, nonhumans deserve a more central place in our analytic frame. To ward that end, I propose three suggestions that might better integrate nonhumans in social in teraction studies. First, we should reconsider the role of mind in social interaction. ANT argues that one's role in social interaction should be gauged by the ability to make things happen. We should focus on what an entity does rather than on who or what it is, particularly with reference to mental motivations. Thus, ANT brings nonhu mans into social interaction by prioritizing ac tion over mind. This is problematic for some. But perhaps we need not completely divorce ourselves from considerations of mind. We can just as effectively draw nonhumans into our an alytic frame by distinguishing the states of mind that can accompany social interaction. Cognitive scientists and cognitive sociolo gists remind us that social interaction may be the product of very different mental states. On the one hand, social interaction may re sult from careful, deliberate cognition, involv ing intention, reflexiveness, and mental calcu lations. But social interaction may also result from automatic cognition?i.e., one's scripted, routine, or habitual response to another. Those engaged in social interaction may even vacil late between automatic and deliberate states. The character of their interaction guides such transitions. But regardless of its trigger, many interactions are the products of processes that consume few conscious resources (D'Andrade 1995; DiMaggio 1997,2002;Johnston &amp; Heinz 1978, Lizardo 2007; Posner &amp; Snyder 1975). If we think of those involved in social in teraction as entities capable of different states of mind, then social interaction itself becomes a much more inclusive process. For example, Deliberate cognition: cognition that involves intention, reflexiveness, and mental calculations Automatic cognition: cognition that involves scripted, routine, or habitual responses www.annualreviews.org ? Nonhumans in Social Interaction 543</page><page sequence="14">although our pets may not engage in the thoughtful deliberation traditionally associated with social interaction, research suggests that they do map some awareness of interactive rou tines (Griffin 1994, Masson &amp; McCarthy 1996, Page 1999, Rogers 1998). In so doing, pets can establish a cognitive, affective, and behav ioral presence in interaction, one that devel ops in response to more deliberative partici pants, and one that ultimately results in some form of mutual understanding between pets and owners. When my dog sees me cry and comes to lick my tears or runs to the door when I grab his/her leash, my dog and I are engaged in meaningful social interaction?even though we have different mental orientations to the exchange. Second, we need to treat perception as seri ously as action in the study of social interaction. Much of the literature reviewed in this article suggests that mental images?entities that re side in the life of the mind?are legitimate par ticipants in social interaction. This idea defies many of the tenets heretofore so central to soci ology. We know that much of early sociological theory was developed in direct contrast to psy chological theories of the mind. The life of the mind was, and still is, viewed as inaccessible and thus off limits to sociological analysis. But when we consider data on some of the nonhuman entities with which humans feel engaged, we must be ready to explore analytic terrain once thought beyond sociology's purview. These so ciomental interactions may indeed yield impor tant social effects. Consider, for example, the earlier reported data on widows, widowers, and delinquents. If such individuals perceive social interactions with their deceased spouses or parents, sociol ogists must explore the patterns and rules that govern the process. We must be curious, for ex ample, about how shared goals and understand ings are reached in such situations. Further, we must explore how or if interactions between the embodied and the disembodied alter support systems or coping mechanisms. Finally, we must study the impact of such human/nonhuman exchanges on humans' physical health, mental health, and emotional stability. Third, we must systematically document the role of social context. Weber contended that humans were not always capable of social inter action. Recall his exclusion of habituating hu mans, fatigued, sleeping, comatose humans, and humans in the grips of euphoria. In the same way, nonhumans' potential for social interac tion may be contextually specific. For example, in writing of interactions be tween senior citizens and robots, Turkle et al. (2006) noted the importance of social integra tion. Seniors who had lost ties with their friends or family members were most likely to engage robots in social interaction. Similar patterns emerged in the Changing Lives of Older Cou ples study. Those who felt least integrated in their children's lives were most likely to perceive interactions with their deceased spouses. Now consider factors such as the gender of interac tants or interaction goals. In Yee's (2006) studies of human/avatar relationships, such factors in fluenced humans' willingness to identify avatars as legitimate social interactants. For women, avatars' legitimacy was linked to social intimacy, whereas for men it was linked to instrumental pursuits. One can imagine a variety of other elements that might deem nonhumans more or less viable in social interaction: the relative power of inter actants, their relative command of resources, interactants' social differences and similarities, their social profiles or physical characteristics. Such issues demand our attention and beckon empirical investigation. CONCLUSION What do we gain by bringing nonhumans into our analysis of social interaction? We gain the potential to scrutinize important exchanges that traditional analytic frames block from view. Hu man interactions with animals, deities, the dead, and other developing objects have occurred throughout history in cultures worldwide. It is time for sociologists to explicitly acknowledge 544 Cenilo</page><page sequence="15">the phenomenon and bring nonhuman enti ties into our analytic frame. Only then can our analysis of the social remain comprehensive and alive. SUMMARY POINTS 1. Traditionally, the analysis of social interaction has been confined to humans. 2. In the past 2 5 years, new theoretical ideas as well as experimental and field studies suggest that nonhuman entities must be included in the analysis of social interaction. These literatures include actor-network theory, interactionist theory, temporality theory, and theories of technological change. 3. Throughout history, nonhumans such as animals, deities, and the dead have been central to people's social relationships worldwide. Social scientists of earlier eras showed little interest in broadly surveying people's attitudes and behaviors toward nonhuman interac tants. But social scientists are now asking questions about how individuals envision and interpret nonhumans in interactive settings. 4. Nonhumans play a more prominent, more active role in social interaction than previously acknowledged. Thus, nonhumans deserve a more central place in our analytic frame. FUTURE ISSUES LIST 1. Researchers should reconsider the role of mind in social interaction: We can effectively draw nonhumans into our analytic frame by acknowledging the variable states of mind (automatic versus deliberate cognition) that can accompany social interaction and use such variability to distinguish levels of participation. 2. We should treat the perception of social interaction as seriously as the sensate experience of social interaction: If we accept the premise that mental images (entities that reside in the life of the mind) are legitimate participants in social interaction, then sociologists must explore (a) the patterns and rules that govern the process, (b) how shared goals and understandings are reached in such situations, (c) how or if interactions between the embodied and the disembodied alter support systems or coping mechanisms, and (d) the impact of such human/nonhuman exchanges on humans' physical health, mental health, and emotional stability. 3. We must systematically document the role of social context: Studies have identified certain elements that might deem nonhumans' more or less viable in social interaction: the social integration of the participants, the gender of the participants, the goal of the interaction. One can imagine others, including the relative power of interactants, their relative command of resources, interactants' social differences and similarities, and their social profiles or physical characteristics. Such issues demand our attention and beckon empirical investigation.
