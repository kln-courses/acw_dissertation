<plain_text><page sequence="1">PETER FINGESTEN Topographical and Anatomical Aspects of the Gothic Cathedral* THE MEDIAEVAL CATHEDRAL is a link to a way of thinking now almost lost-a magi- cal interpretation of the cosmos. It was the result of highly sophisticated building tech- niques in the service of mysticism, and sci- entific nature observation in the service of a visionary image of the future. The cathe- dral is the only manifestation of the medi- aeval creative genius in which all of its con- tradictions are reconciled, the spiritual and the material, the natural and the grotesque, science and magic, devotion to Christ and devotion to the Virgin Mary. The mediae- val concept of the cosmos, with its vast hierarchies, from the demonic to the celes- tial, was too much for the mind to contain -the cathedral alone symbolized them on a scale the eye and the mind could encompass. The recent flurry of important interpre- tive studies on the Gothic and its antece- dents indicates the continued search for the deeper motivations of this style.' Definitive interpretations are neither possible nor de- sirable, for the subject of the cathedral is so complex, the differences between individ- ual structures so varied, the technical means so daring, and its allegorism so spiritual that all one may hope for is to penetrate deeper into its mysteries. After Viollet-Le-Duc's monumental Dic- tionnaire raisonne de L'Architecture fran- faise du XIe au XVIe siecle (1863) there was a wave of rationalist criticism of Gothic architecture which only of late has lost ground to a more synthetic, interpretive ap- proach. Leading allegorists of the Middle Ages, like William Durandus, and even, to a certain extent, Abbot Suger, the guiding spirit of the Abbey church of St. Denis, took function for granted and only saw the sym- bolic meaning of form. Purely technical problems, such as the evolution of ribbed vaults and flying buttresses, do not illumi- nate the scope of the cathedral which, in one respect, can be traced to the founda- tions of Christianity and beyond, and, in another, to a curious blending of mysticism and natural science of which it is such an outstanding expression. Although mysticism and science may seem strange bedfellows in our age of compartmentalization, during the Middle Ages there were many thinkers who saw no contradiction between the two. Hugh of St. Victor was a famous mystic noted for his classification of the sciences, and Albertus Magnus, even though a keen student of nature, yet believed that all in- ferior matter was imbued with "occult vir- tues" derived from the stars. The same is true of St. Hildegarde of Bingen who wrote of religious visions as well as of plants, stones, trees, fish, birds, animals, reptiles, and metals in her compendious work Me- dicinal Simples. "A notable thing about PETER FINGESTEN is associate professor of art at Pace College, New York City.

While these, indeed, contributed, in com- bination with others, such as the Roman basilica on the historical level, and alle- gorism on the spiritual one, the vertical ac- cent an(t certain features of exterior and interior organization were inspired by na- ture. During the 12th century there was a fortuitous conjunction of building tech- niques and scientific nature study enabling the builders to incorporate more adequately the allegory of the cathedral. II The allegorism of the mediaeval cathe- dral, its spiritual raison d'etre, was mainly inspired by Chapter 21 of the Revelation of St. John, who "saw the holy city, new Jeru- salem, coming down out of heaven from God...." The first five verses of this chap- ter were customarily read at mediaeval dedication rites.3 Some scholars have gone beyond this description of the symbolism of the cathedral, as have also many mediae- val theologians who were inspired by new modes of devotion rather than by this scrip- tural tradition. Others have tried to alle- gorize the cathedral in scriptural terms, using sources other than Chapter 21 of Rev- elation. This is defensible insofar as it har- monizes with this chapter; that is to say, the biblical sources and interpretations must agree with rather than contradict each other. The fundamental rule in an allegorical interpretation of architecture is that form does not follow function but symbol. If the vision of the new Jerusalem underlies the symbolism of the cathedral, we must take the references in Chapter 21 of Revelation in their entirety since this allegory is not quoted out of context, as it were. This criti- cal chapter contains several keys to details that are still problematic. It discusses the new Jerusalem in many of its aspects, ex- terior as well as interior. John's description, which has a bearing upon architecture, con- sists of three parts: (1) the new Jerusalem descending to earth, verses 1-3; (2) its archi- tectural description, verses 9-21; (3) the de- scription of the interior of the new Jeru- salem, verses 22-27. The idea of the cathedral as a sacred city, holy mountain, and center of the earth de- rives from the Hebrews, and, through them, from the religious traditions of the Ancient Near East, where the symbolism of the mountain of God (ziggurat) was first con- ceived.4 Every cathedral, like the temple at Jerusalem, stands upon a "holy mountain' (Ps. 48:2). It is symbolically the "center of the nations, with countries round about" (Ez. 5:5). From it the truth radiates in every direction and around it, like a cosmic axis, everything revolves; thus every cathedral signifies both the physical and spiritual cen- ter of the world.5 It is built upon the "rock of salvation" (Ps. 95:1, 1 Cor. 10:4), upon the mountain where God met his people (Ex. 19:11). The steps which lead into the cathedral force one to ascend, as on the holy mountain itself, so that man may see the face of God again. Consistent with John's vision that the new Jerusalem is neither a single structure nor a temple, but rather a magic city which descends upon a magic mountain, Zion, we need not interpret the three zones in which the cathedral's exterior is articulated too literally: (1) foundation, steps, and base; (2) aisle and nave elevation; (3) roof, tow- ers, and spires, for the entire exterior facade symbolizes the magic city and the magic mountain at the same time. This harmo- nizes with certain Old Testament prophe- cies which were fulfilled, according to the New Testament, during Christ's lifetime (". . .that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled" Mat. 4:14). A significant elucidation of John's vision is contained in a prophecy by Isaiah who em- ployed the terms "mountain" and "house of the LORD" synonymously: "It shall come to pass in the latter days that the mountain of the house of the LORD shall be established as the highest of the moun- tains, and shall be raised above the hills; and all the nations shall flow to it. .." (2:2). A cathedral, therefore, can never be high or</page><page sequence="3">Aspects of the Gothic Cathedral 5 fantastic enough, for it does not reflect any earthly city but recalls mountains of an un- earthly landscape, with its crystalline struc- ture and vertical accents, shadow-casting crevices and overhangs, steep slopes and tall needles. An increasing desire for height, together with the expanding ground plan which be- came so typical of the Gothic cathedral, be- sides answering practical needs, such as accommodating greater numbers of worship- pers in the nave, more clergy in the rituals, and more relics in the side chapels, reflects a certain topographical awareness, at least on the exterior. In order to erect architec- tural magic mountains the builders and ecclesiastics studied real mountains.6 As we shall see, the exterior of the cathedral con- forms to natural rock formations to an as- tonishing degree. The mountains they ob- served, however, were held in superstitious awe by the mediaeval mind. In other words, architectural needs, nature study, and the miraculous entered into a strange relation- ship in the building of the great cathedrals. The master-builders and their learned ecclesiastical patrons drew their topograph- ical and geological knowledge from two sources, popular and scientific. Popular knowledge of the world was disseminated by pilgrims and crusaders. The pilgrims had a decisive influence upon the growth of cathedrals which, although universally acknowledged, has been understood to ap- ply to interior expansion due to relic wor- ship. We believe, however, that the pil- grims had as much to do with the exterior organization of the facades. Their romantic accounts by word of mouth and letter of strenuous and often dangerous travels to centers of pilgrimages deeply affected the imagination of their contemporaries. Their more or less embellished stories laid the foundations for descriptive geology in that the people became aware of the topograph- ical and geological features of Europe and the Near East.7 Among favored centers of pilgrimage, be- sides Jerusalem, were the tombs of the apostles at Rome, the Shrine of St. James at Santiago de Compostella, the miraculous statue of the Blessed Virgin at Einsiedeln, and Monserrat, dedicated to the Virgin. The routes to these popular shrines led over steep mountains-the Alps or Dolomites (Italian shrines), Swiss mountains (Einsie- deln), and Pyrenees (Santiago and Monser- rat). The awe-inspiring quality of these mountain chains, with their grouped peaks, high passes, sheer drops, tall needles, snow- covered summits, fantastic snowdrifts, and other features, made unforgettable impres- sions. Mountain climbing, also, though not widely practiced, attracted some intrepid souls. As early as 1188, John de Bremble, an English monk, ascended the great St. Ber- nard. In a letter to his sub-prior Geoffrey of Christ Church, Canterbury, he wrote: "I have been on the Mount of Jove; on the one hand looking up to the heaven of moun- tains, on the other shuddering at the hell of the valleys, feeling myself so much nearer heaven that I was sure that my prayer would be heard. 'Lord,' I said, 'restore me to my brethren, that I may tell them that they come not to this place of torment.' "8 In 1250, King Peter III of Aragon climbed Mount Rochemelon, reporting that he had sighted upon it a ferocious dragon.9 In 1307, the Swiss peak Mons Fractus (or Pila- tus) was climbed by a party of six clergymen who, in doing so, defied the local ecclesiasti- cal government and were jailed for this offense.10 They probably received this op- probrium because at that time most people still believed that mountain tops were in- habited by dragons and evil spirits and were frequented by witches. After the 10th century the people of northern Europe broke through the physi- cal isolation following the breakdown of the Roman Empire's far-flung lines of com- munication. Through the pilgrims, cru- saders, relic-vendors, traders, and wander- ing scholars they became aware of the topography of their world. This awareness was extended to nature in general, for we find natural plant forms in capitals, mold- ings, and decorations in most Gothic ca- thedrals. C. R. Morey noted that "It was the insistent Gothic quest of the concrete that led it into the most surprising phe- nomenon of mediaeval art-the shift to natural ornament."" This is not surprising at all if one considers the fact that nothing is as conducive to an appreciation of na-</page><page sequence="4">6 PETER FINGESTEN ture as travelling, particularly under the circumstances of the Middle Ages when most travel was carried on by foot or by horse. In addition, abbots and monks often travelled on ecclesiastical business from monastery to monastery, higher members of the clergy sojourning as far as Rome. John of Salisbury, Bishop of Chartres, who went from England to France to study with Abelard, crossed the Alps ten times (!), jour- neyed twice from England to Apulia, and often travelled about France and his native land.12 Between 1100 and 1250, seven em- perors and their armies made no less than thirty-nine journeys over Alpine passes. Of the thirty-nine imperial crossings nearly half were made by the Brenner, four by the great St. Bernard, six by the Septimer, three by Mount Cenis, two by the Lukmanier, and six by other passes.13 Master builders and journeymen, as a rule, went from fabric to fabric, seeking employment in distant cities and countries. On building sites from England to Spain and Italy one usually could find quite a few foreign craftsmen working with native labor. Abbot Suger re- ports that on the rebuilding of the abbey church of St. Denis, during the first half of the 12th century, "barbarian artists" were employed who were "even more lavish than ours."'4 In other words, the stage was set for an exchange of information of different kinds which included technical know-how, stylistic features, observations of nature, and unusual topographical features gath- ered along the way. Topography and geology were studied as- siduously on a scientific level, particularly after the observations of Mohammedan scholars became available in Latin transla- tions. Pliny's Natural History had given the mediaeval scholars their foundation in ge- ology. His facts and fancies served until the vast reservoir of Mohammedan scholarship was tapped. Avicenna's work, De Minerali- bus, translated by Alfred of Sarashel, and the pseudo-Aristotle's De Proprietatibus Elementorum, translated from the Arabic by Gerard of Cremona in 12th-century Spain, opened wide the floodgates of the in- creasing desire for scientific observations of the topography of the earth. Erosion of the earth and mountains by water was known to late Greek commentators, such as Alex- ander of Aphrodisias, and Avicenna, the Mohammedan forerunner of St. Thomas, who accepted this "neptunic" theory but added his own so-called "plutonic" theory, that mountains were raised by eruptions due to earthquakes.15 Avicenna also cor- rectly understood how stalactites and stalag- mites were formed. Albertus Magnus wrote his systematic book on geology, De Mineralibus et Rebus Metallicis, based upon his Arabic predeces- sors, in about 1260. Though he added some original observations, he accepted the then universally current theory of the magic properties of stones-the theory that under- lies the desire of so many ecclesiastics for columns made of exotic and rare marbles for their cathedrals and precious stones for altars and ritual objects. Abbot Suger, him- self, believed in the occult virtues of pre- cious stones and proudly enumerated those adorning the main altar of St. Denis. "Often we contemplate, out of sheer affection for the church our mother, these different orna- ments both new and old; and when we be- hold how that wonderful cross of St. Eloy- together with the smaller ones-and that incomparable ornament commonly called 'the Crest' are placed upon the golden altar, then I say, sighing deeply in my heart: Every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, the topaz, and the jasper, the chrys- olite, and the onyx, and the beryl, the sap- phire, and the carbuncle, and the emerald. To those who know the properties of pre- cious stones it becomes evident, to their ut- ter astonishment, that none is absent from the number of these (with the only excep- tion of the carbuncle), but that they abound most copiously."'6 A 13th-century scientific encyclopedia, Speculum Regale, contains detailed descrip- tions of glaciers, icebergs, geysers, and other natural phenomena. In Italy, Albertus Mag- nus' work held sway, though in the 13th century Ristolo d'Arezzo made a number of interesting observations of the Appennines, describing the eroded castellated strata con- taining iron which lay over aqueous de- posits of softer sandstones, shales, and con- glomerates.17 Bartholomew of England, a 13th-century Franciscan, in his Proprietati-</page><page sequence="5">Aspects of the Gothic Cathedral 7 bus Rerum, devotes the 14th book to geol- ogy, defining mountains, hills, valleys, plains, fields, meadows, deserts, caves, and ditches. He describes over thirty particular peaks or mountain ranges, most of which are named in the Bible, like Ararat, Bethel, Hermon, Hebron, and Horeb. In the case of new localities and names for which he can find no ancient or early mediaeval authori- ties he describes the province intelligently and accurately as it was in his own time. He praised such details as the stone and cement about Paris which gave it an advantage over other localities in building construc- tion.18 In spite of the excellent observations and descriptions of nature by scholars such as Albertus Magnus and Roger Bacon, the sci- ence of geology was not free of the miracu- lous. Thus one may find a perfectly scien- tific description of a natural phenomenon with its cause assigned to supernatural pow- ers. An important element in the interpre- tation of the cathedral, therefore, is that the very stones of which it is constructed were believed to have "occult virtues." Not only does Abbot Suger in the above quoted para- graph refer "to those who know the prop- erties of precious stones," that is, their magi- cal properties, but one may be sure that most schoolmen were convinced of it, and in plants and animals as well. Albertus Magnus grants that the wonders worked by means of stones seem "more pro- digious and marvellous" than those pro- duced by simple substances, that the physi- cal constitution of stones does not seem to justify the existence of such powers in them, and that "the cause of the virtue of stones is indeed occult." But he maintains that such occult virtues are well established by experience, "since we see the magnet attract iron and the adamant restrict that virtue in the magnet." Albertus also claims to have seen a sapphire which removed ulcers.19 He twice mentions that the "prodigious and marvellous" power of stones cannot really be understood without a knowledge of the three other sciences, of magic, necromancy, and astrology.20 Grosseteste accepted Albertus Magnus' explanation of the marvellous virtues of gems as due to celestial influence, as did Vincent of Beauvais. "All things which are renewed in the inferior world, except such as are caused by the superior form of our reason, have their efficient causes in the inalterable and incorruptible superior world."21 Although Albertus takes great pain to deny that the stars affect the free will of men, quoting Ptolemy of Lucca to the effect that the wise man rules the stars, he insists that they, in truth, are rulers of the world in those things which are subject to the world, namely things corporeal.22 There is little doubt that during the en- tire Middle Ages there existed the belief in a distinct relationship between stones and stars, or, to put it simpler, between building materials and magic, confirming the dictum of C. H. Haskins, "In the mediaeval mind the science of magic lay close to the magic of science."23 The well known argument that natural plant forms which were used as decorative elements in the Gothic cathedral denote a "love of nature" (Emile Male and follow- ers) may not be as innocent as hitherto sup- posed. According to Albertus Magnus, the properties of plants are produced by the interaction of five virtues, of which the in- fluence of the stars is predominant. "Its specific form, upon which its occult virtues largely depend, is given to the plant by the motion of the heavens, especially by the movement of the planets through the circle of the zodiac, and their position in relation to the fixed stars. Plants receive this influ- ence at the time of their formation, when vapors, potentially seminal and formative, ascend from the depths of the earth and meet the dewy air as it ascends."24 Thus before one discusses technical prob- lems or the symbolism of the exterior and interior of any cathedral, one should under- stand the extent to which the magic inter- pretation of the cosmos affected every part, from the simplest building material to the most precious, every carving of plant motif, the colors of stained glass windows, sym- bols, ritual vessels, in short, every detail, material and symbolic, of the total fabric. In this connection it is interesting to note that Albertus Magnus believed that even art was under the influence of the stars. He asserts that a fundamental principle of this</page><page sequence="6">8 PETER FINGESTEN science (astrology) is that all things made by nature are moved first by celestial pow- ers. He believed that it is the influence of the stars which incites the artist to create.25 This throws an additional light upon the designing of the cathedral, and its conse- cration. Guido Bonatti (13th century), au- thor of the Liber Astronomicus, goes so far as to give instructions for choosing a favor- able hour for the building of churches, castles, and cities. His book was "intended for the use of Christians and the clergy."26 Some of this widespread knowledge was utilized in the exterior organization of the cathedral, for it enabled the master builders to express more "naturalistically" in archi- tectural terms John's vision of the new Jeru- salem descending to earth and Isaiah's prophecy, "the mountain of the house of the LORD shall be established as the high- est of the mountains." The analogy between the church edifice and mountain of God was made by Eusebius as early as the 4th century, thus establishing the precedent for this interpretation about eight hundred years before the Gothic style in which this allegory comes to full architectural expres- sion. "To which city since the all-gracious God hath gathered us, through the grace of His Only-begotten, let each of the guests sing, yea all but shout, and say 'I was glad when they said unto me, we will go unto the house of the Lord'; and 'Lord, I have loved the beauty of thy house, and the place where thy glory dwelleth.' And let not only each one by himself, but also all together with one spirit and one soul, give honor and praise, saying: 'Great is the Lord, and highly to be praised, in the city of our God, in his holy mountain'" ("Panegyric on the building of churches, addressed to Paulinus, Bishop of the Tyrians," Ecc. Hist. X, IV, 6-8). Cathedrals which are located on the plains where they rise suddenly beyond the realm of man express most effectively the concept of the magic city upon the magic mountain. Ecclesiastics, well aware of the allegorical meaning of their cathedrals, en- forced the law that no secular building may rise higher than the parapet of the cathe- dral in order to emphasize its dominating mountainous impression. "... the Arch- bishop of Reims took delight in climbing to the eaves of his cathedral to sweep the surrounding town with a glass, with dire penalties for the owner of any man-made structure which projected above the level of the cathedral parapet."27 Where they are located in hilly or mountainous regions, they blend naturally into the topography of the landscape. Cathedrals are as impressive near as from afar. Their sharp, asymmetri- cal silhouettes and deep indentations, as in Chartres, Paris, Amiens, Rheims, and oth- ers, suggest not only individual mountains, but, as in the case of the Cathedral of Mi- lan, a whole mountain chain. The Duomo of Milan is a veritable massif whose two thousand pinnacles and sculptures mirror the rugged outlines of the Italian Dolomites in whose shadow it was built. The typical Gothic cathedral "rises" like a mountain, from the East to the West, to- wards the tall towers as towards a peak. Seen from the East there is a buildup of mass and volume-apsidioles, apse and apse roof, summit of the nave roof to the fleche or to the western towers-suggesting a se- quence of bulky masses which simulate groups of hills leading up to a single or multiple peak. The western facade repre- sents the sheer drop, or precipice of this magic mountain. Between the western tow- ers (with or without spires) there is a deep chasm through which the ridge of the sum- mit with its deep slopes is visible. A 13th- century cathedral with all its towers com- pleted, as in Viollet-Le-Duc's well known sketch, based upon the cathedral of Rheims (Fig. 1), is like a gigantic mountain with a main peak (tower over the crossing) and subsidiary peaks (towers of western facade and North and South transepts), while the spires are tall needles surrounding the ridge of the roof (summit). The typical asym- metrical silhouette of the cathedral, with its towers rising to different heights, reveals a spirit of capriciousness like that of nature, for what natural peaks rise to the same height? From Notre Dame de Laon to Chartres, Amiens and Rheims, and further to Strass- burg and Cologne, an ever steeper drop of the western fa(ade becomes evident. Their creviced surfaces, too, seem more eroded,</page><page sequence="7">Aspects of the Gothic Cathedral 9 Fig. 1. Sketch of a Completed Cathedral. Viollet-Le-Duc, Dictionnaire raisonne'. as if the builders tried to anticipate the erosive hand of nature. Between pier but- tresses vertical gulleys divide the surface, and the eye glides from fissure to fissure, or furrow to furrow. Vertical colonnettes, like veins of harder material, alternate with somewhat eroded softer areas, creating crev- ices between them. The fleche represents a rock tooth upon a ridge while the transept becomes a spur, one of the main ridges of the magic mountain. The western facade, or precipice, is divided horizontally by moldings, taking the place of tiers of ledges, outcroppings, and overhanging snow cor- nices, while flying buttresses hang precari- ously like snow bridges and drifts from the cliffs of the nave elevation. The purely functional purpose of single and multiple flying buttresses has been greatly exaggerated. While lower buttresses, indeed, brace the nave walls and dissipate vault thrusts to an extent, upper flying but- tresses are wind braces, according to John F. Fitchen, III.28 Prof. Fitchen, however, concedes that the steeper roofs themselves, with their greatly increased weight, tend to resist lateral wind pressure and a tendency to rotate under wind action. "Actually,</page><page sequence="8">10 PETER FINGESTEN from the standpoint of wind alone, it was advantageous for these high, steeply-pitched roofs to be relatively heavy. For there is a definite relationship between the height of an object of a given base and weight, when it comes to its stability in resisting the over- turning action of wind."29 As far as we know no Gothic cathedral has collapsed from wind pressure. As in so many other architectural details, symbolic or aesthetic significance was read into purpose until the purpose became secondary and symbolism or decorative effect became the sole consid- eration, as in the case of the highly elabo- rate English fan vaults. Flying buttresses were often placed on relatively low struc- tures for obviously other than functional reasons, as on the polygonal chapter house of the Cathedral of Lincoln, and many tow- ers. The English, on the whole, resisted fly- ing buttresses and erected lofty structures without them, such as the rebuilt clerestory of Gloucester with its vast windows, the nave of Tewkesbury, and many others. "Frequently also late spires were connected with their corner pinnacles by ornamental flying buttresses. It is remarkable how un- successful almost all are."30 At any rate, the proliferation of multiple flying buttresses owes as much to practical as to symbolic considerations. Mountain tops are gener- ally whipped by high winds, eroding not only stone surfaces but carving strange snow and ice drifts. There seems to be a distinct visual relationship between the architec- tural magic mountain with its flying but- tresses and real mountains with their fantastic snow and ice bridges. This inter- pretation does not deny the functional as- pect of flying buttresses but extends it from brace to symbol. Extremely "eroded" cathedral fasades, such as Rouen, Tours, and Cologne, give the impression of being in the process of exfoliation, a flaking or weathering of the stone due to age. Stained glass windows set back into square fields or pointed arches do not reveal their colors from the exterior but act, rather, as a pattern and glistening texture, bringing to mind verglas, the thin coating of ice or snow upon rock. Smaller details, such as crockets, turrets, niches, finials, and so forth, complete the weather- beaten appearance, simulating a mountain carved by the wind and snow for thousands of years. The crystalline, angular structure of the cathedral attempts to conform, as far as architectural necessity allows, to John's de- scription of the exterior of the holy city, the new Jerusalem. "And in the Spirit [one of the seven angels] carried me away to a great. high mountain, and showed me the holy city Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God, having the glory of God, its radiance like a most rare jewel, like a jasper, clear as crystal" (21:10-11). He describes it further: "It had a great, high wall, with twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and on the gates the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel were inscribed; on the east three gates, on the north three gates, on the south three gates, and on the west three gates. And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the lamb" (21:12-13). As for the four sets of gates of John's visionary city, only three sets of gates (porches) are possible on the cathedral: west, north and south. The east- ern elevation contains the round or square apse behind the altar, and porches there would have disturbed the sanctity of the ritual. But the archivolts of the splayed en- trances often have choirs of angels carved into them to convey John's "twelve angels at the gates." The attempt to erect larger and larger cathedrals with higher naves and taller towers surmounted by steeples may have been inspired in part by John who noted the fantastic size of the heavenly city as being "twelve thousand stadia, its length and breadth and height are equal... its walls a hundred and forty-four cubits" (21:15-17). He goes on to say that "The wall was built of jasper, while the city was pure gold, clear as glass" (21:18). This ex- plains the exterior crystalline appearance as noted above, but the city itself, made of "pure gold, clear as glass," inspired the lu- minous quality of the interior, for the Gothic was the first architectural style in the history of the world which was indeed built of translucent walls. Other of John's remarks concern the sub- stance of the new Jerusalem, that it was</page><page sequence="9">Aspects of the Gothic Cathedral 11 adorned with every jewel: "the first was jasper, the second sapphire, the third agate, the fourth emerald, the fifth onyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chryso- prase, the eleventh jacinth, the twelfth amethyst" (21:18-21). As we remember, Ab- bot Suger encrusted the altar of St. Denis with seven of the twelve precious stones mentioned by John. He added one new one (sardius) and made a point of the fact that one, the carbuncle, was missing. Since nei- ther the sardius nor the carbuncle was men- tioned by John, Suger undoubtedly had their magical properties in mind. That the mediaeval mind conceived of the cathedral as a magic city built of precious stones is proven by Suger's account of the laying of the foundation for the enlarged abbey church of St. Denis, "The Most Serene King himself stepped down [into the excavation] and with his own hands laid his [stone]. Also we and many others, both adults and monks, laid their stones. Certain persons also [deposited] gems out of love and rever- ence for Jesus Christ, chanting: Lapides preciosi omnes muri tui."31 The interpretation of the cathedral as a magic city upon a magic mountain also answers more satisfactorily the problem of gargoyles and grotesques upon the summit or roof. Most scholars have either studiously avoided the subject or dismissed it with pious generalities.32 Sedlmayer character- ized their region as "Sphere of Hell" and remarked, in his rather inconclusive dis- cussion on this subject, that "these zones of hell are as yet too little investigated."33 These fantastic upright representations of evil (as well as some horizontal water spouts, which, though grotesque, fulfill a functional purpose) complete the symbolism of the exterior of the magic mountain. Mountain tops were always believed to be dwelling places of good or evil spirits. A well known instance of this belief was the Walpurgisnacht in the Hartz mountains in central Germany. There, on the Brocken, the highest peak, during the night between April 30th and May 1st, witches and evil spirits led by Satan would congregate and engage in a wild orgy. This pre-Christian festival marking the beginning of summer was christianized by connecting the date to St. Walpurga, the eighth-century English missionary who went to Germany. "Some of the cultus with which she was formerly honored, including her attribute of corn, may possibly have been transferred to her from the old heathen goddess Walborg, or Mother Earth."34 The similarity between the name of the heathen goddess Walborg and St. Walpurga is rather distinct. The latter is considered a protectress against magic arts, linking her firmly to the pagan festival in a negative form, however. The sculptors who placed grotesque representa- tions of evil around the summit of the cathedral took it, perhaps, too literally. They based their inspiration not only upon persistent popular superstitions, but also upon the remarks about evil, Satan, and demons in the Old and New Testaments. In the Old Testament Satan is mentioned repeatedly as tempter (Job 1 and 2) and Adversary of man (1 Chron. 21:1, Zech. 3:1-2). Evil spirits torment those whom God abandons (1 Sam. 16:14-16). In the New Testament the existence of Satan, demons, and evil in general is a persistent theme. Overcoming temptation by Satan is part of the process of salvation; indeed, Christ himself was tempted by him (Lk. 4:1-13). The Lord's Prayer refers to the everpresent dangers of evil: "And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil" (Mt. 6:13). Evil is an everpresent power against which one must be on one's guard. "Be sober, be watchful. Your ad- versary the devil prowls around like a roar- ing lion, seeking someone to devour" (1 Pe. 5:8). In other words, "the whole world is in the power of the evil one" (1 Jn. 5:19). Most schoolmen took for granted the ex- istence of Satan, demons, and witches. Vin- cent of Beauvais believed that demons in- habited the lower and misty air.35 This would suggest the eaves of the roof of the cathedral as their natural habitat. Other scholars and theologians believed in drag- ons, basilisks, and other imaginary animals associated with evil. Albertus Magnus, for instance, believed that the mere glance and hiss of the basilisk was fatal. Though the reptile's glance will kill as far as its vision extends, its hiss is not fatal as far as it can</page><page sequence="10">12 PETER FINGESTEN be heard, but only as far as it is propagated by the basilisk's breath.36 Roger Bacon still believed in dragons and cites the following unlikely story. "It is certain that Ethiopian sages have come into Italy, Spain, France, England, and those Christian lands where there are good flying dragons; and by an occult art that they possess, excite the drag- ons from their caves. And they have saddles and bridles ready, and they ride the dragons, and drive them at top speed through the air, in order to soften the rigidity and toughness of their flesh, just as boars, bears, and bulls are hunted with dogs and beaten with many blows before they are killed for eating. And when they have tamed the drag- ons in this way, they have an art of pre- paring their fleslh... which they employ against the accident of age and prolong life and inspire intellect beyond all estimation. For no education which man can give will bestow such wisdom as does the eating of their flesh, as we have learned without deceit or doubt from men of proved trustworthi- ness."37 The magical arts, so widely practiced, were believed to be ultimately the work of demons. Albertus Magnus and some other schoolmen distinguished between two va- rieties of magic, one natural and good and the other demoniacal and evil.38 It would be stretching the point to assume that these gargoyles and occasional obscene exaggera- tions represent good, or white magic.39 These grotesques were placed upon the summit of the cathedral not to protect it from evil, but as a reminder of it, for how can Christians combat evil with evil? In a famous instance, Christ ridiculed this idea with a parable. "How can Satan cast out Satan? If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. And if a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand. And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand but is coming to an end" (Mk. 3:22- 27). Do these images on cathedrals like Notre Dame of Paris, Rheims, and others illustrate Christ's parable that when evil rises against evil its end is near, or do they represent the cosmic battle when evil will be defeated (Rev. 20:1-13)? Or do they il- lustrate the strong belief held during the Middle Ages that evil was still "prowling around" and that Satan and his horde con- vened upon mountain tops? The latter is consistent with the magic mountain, the mediaeval belief in demons, and the repre- sentation of evil not as defeated, but very much alive. If our interpretation of the cathedral thus far is correct, then its entrance and interior must in some way conform to this archi- tectural allegory. Entrances to cathedrals are exceedingly small and narrow in pro- portion to the width and height of the facades. Deeply splayed entrances, with or without overhang, strongly suggest en- trances to caves. In some cases, such as the west front of Amiens, the door (mouth of the cave) is hidden within a deeply eroded entrance covered with tracery like hanging icicles. The typical Romanesque Lombard porch has two lions supporting colonnettes and canopy (overhang) who protect the en- trance into the sacred cave like guardian animals of old. Past the overhang and nar- row entrance one steps into a vast, dim cave. The interior of the cathedral, on one sym- bolic level, is a cave, the tall compound piers and the thin shafts upon them simulating stalagmites and protruberances which grew upon them by slow accumulation. And be- low the nave floor are deeper hollows (con- fessio, crypt, undercroft) suggesting a net- work of interconnecting caves. III John describes the interior of the New Jerusalem as follows: "And I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb" (Rev. 21:22). Since John explicitly states that he did not see a physical structure in the new Jerusa- lem, but the Lord as temple, the interior of the magic city should be interpreted in anthropomorphic terms. Such interpretations of sacred architec- ture go back to Vitruvius. In his celebrated opening of Book III, he bases the propor- tions of the temple upon the measurements of the human body. "For without symmetry and proportion no temple can have a regu- lar plan; that is, it must have an exact pro- portion worked out after the fashion of the</page><page sequence="11">Aspects of the Gothic Cathedral 13 members of a finely shaped body." In an- other place (Book 1:2) he writes that "decor obeys conventions, that is, different orders will be suited best for various gods such as the Doric for Minerva, Mars, and Hercules, the Corinthian for Venus, Flora, and Pros- erpine, while the Ionic serves best Juno, Diana, and Bacchus." Vitruvius must have been familiar with the Stoic concept of the - "1 r ' " ' ! - Fig. 2. Top: Old St. Peter's, Rome (Without atrium). Bottom: Vitruvian Figure.

Al- though his ideas became very popular dur- ing the Renaissance, copies of his books were extant and consulted during the Mid- dle Ages. When Vitruvius derived the proportions of the temple from those of a "finely shaped body," he did not have a female body in mind. Renaissance artists and architects, like Francesco di Georgio, Pietro Cataneo, Cesariano, Leonardo and others, interpret- ing Vitruvius, applied their proportional schemes, so-called Vitruvian figures, to male bodies only. Pietro Cataneo even drew a nude male body within the confines of a basilica based upon a Tau cross plan (Fig. 2). Christ compared his body to a temple, as evident from the disputation recorded in John 2:18-21. "Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up. The Jews then said, 'It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and you will raise it up in three days?' But he spoke of the temple of his body." Peter referred to him as "living stone" (1 Pe. 2:4) and Paul, following through this architectural imagery, com- pared the faithful to temples (1 Cor. 3:16- 17), buildings (1 Cor. 3:9), and houses (2 Cor. 5:1). The stones of which the cathedral is constructed symbolize Christ. "The very stone which the builders rejected has be- come the head of the corner" (Mk. 12:10). He is the foundation (1 Cor. 3:11) and the chief cornerstone in whom the whole struc- ture is joined together (Eph. 2:20-21). The term "structure" is used here in the sense of the congregation of the faithful, but it can be applied to the physical structure in which the faithful become "united to the Lord . .. one spirit with him" (1 Cor. 16:17). With this concept two fundamental sym- bols coalesced into one-the interior of the cathedral, or temple, as the body of Christ, and the body of Christ as a temple. The Logos incarnated in a male, Jesus. In the gospels it is his body that is compared to a temple, living stone, foundation, cor- nerstone and door. The 13th-century alle- gorist William Durandus, basing himself upon such scriptural precedence, inter- preted the cathedral of his time anthropo- morphically. "The arrangement of a ma-</page><page sequence="12">14 PETER FINGESTEN terial church resembleth that of the human body: the chancel, or place where the altar is, representeth the head: the transepts, the hands and arms, and the remainder-to- wards the west-the rest of the body." He also included the cruciform ground plan in his allegoric interpretation. "But some churches are built in the shape of a cross, to signify, that we are crucified to the world, and should tread in the steps of the Cruci- fied."40 Christ's reference to himself as a temple must have impressed ecclesiastics and build- ers long before Gothic cathedrals were erected. In other words, the well known argument that the cross plan as a symbol of the crucified applies only to structures erected after about 1000 can no longer be defended. The cruciform plan of most west- ern churches and cathedrals can be traced to Old St. Peter's in Rome (326 A.D.). As one scholar put it, "The whole solution at Old St. Peter's was so masterly that it has been repeated with variations in every sub- sequent age down to the present, and it is correct to say that this design, where Chris- tian architecture was first declared to the world, was the most influential church de- sign ever composed"41 (Fig. 2). During the 4th century, which witnessed a new, tolerant attitude towards Chris- tianity (Council of Milan), the cross was being openly interpreted as a symbol of victory. About this time also there emerged the interpretation of the cruciform basilica as a symbol of Christ. "St. Ambrose in 382 was among the first to emphasize that the cross plan of the Church of the Holy Apostles at Milan, which he laid out, was meant to symbolize the victory of Christ and of His cross."42 This applied no doubt, to Old St. Peter's and to other contemporary churches. "Yet it does not matter greatly which particular cross shape was meant, whether basilica plan in the shape of the Latin crux capitata as at Deas; whether it was the pattern of the T cross as at Bam- berg or whether a Greek cross plan was re- ferred to as in Arculph's description of the church at the well of Jacob... The term [similitudinem crucis; in modum crucis] may possibly have been applied even to round edifices with cross chapels.... Occa- sionally the cross shape refers even to the pattern in which five churches are laid out within or around a city...."43 Many other elements of the interior carry through this allegory of the body of Christ. Mediaeval ecclesiastics, intoxicated with al- legorism, did not fail to appreciate the great possibilities of light as a symbol of the In- carnation. Light was not studied nor under- stood as to its properties but was thought of mainly in a mystical sense. It was believed to issue from the stars and to exert occult powers; in short, magical-mystical notions prevailed over scientific ones. Since the ca- thedral is primarily an allegory of John's vision, one must not overlook his and other scriptural references to light in favor of neo-Platonic light mysticism, which seems to be the tendency in recent scholarship. Durandus himself linked stained glass win- dows to the light of God. "The glass win- dows in a church are Holy Scriptures, which expel the wind and the rain, that is all things hurtful, but transmit the light of the true Sun, that is, God, into the hearts of the faithful."44 While neo-Platonism, indeed, reinforced these notions, they were rooted in the scriptures which were studied no less on that account. What is more descriptive of the translucency of a Gothic cathedral than the words of Psalm 104:2, "[LORD] who coverest thyself with light as with a garment?" And when the Lord showed Zechariah the plan of the rebuilt Jerusalem he said, "For I will be to her a wall of fire round about... and I will be the glory within her" (2:5). The New Testament abounds with references to Christ as "the light of the world" (Jn. 8:12), "the giver of light" (Eph. 5:14), "God is light" (1 Jn. 1:5), and so forth. If the interior of the cathedral is an- thropomorphic, then the stained glass win- dows are its "skin." They also symbolize various aspects of Christ's presence. Apse windows, like the star in the East, announce his birth (Mt. 2:2). They also represent "eyes," for the apse is the "head" of the ca- thedral: "his eyes were like a flame of fire ... and his face was like the sun shining in full strength" (Rev. 1:14-16). The tall stained glass windows of the nave and aisles repre- sent his "garment of light" for the body of</page><page sequence="13">Aspects of the Gothic Cathedral 15 the Lord is "covered with light." The rose in the western elevation represents the set- ting sun and announces his death, for after the crucifixion there was "darkness over the whole land" (Mk. 15:33), or a solar eclipse (Lk. 23:44-45). Under the western rose the tympanum of the central porch of many ca- thedrals contains scenes of the Last Judge- ment, that is, of death and resurrection. The rose window, in spite of its improbable name, is a symbol of the sun. It is either a lotus flower, wheel, star pattern, or a combi- nation of these. "... The Rosette-whether derived from the lotus or any other flower- forms an essentially solar symbol."45 It is often placed in a dominating position in the western elevation symbolizing the setting sun, while the lights, small roses, and oculi in the eastern elevation represent the rising sun, or the morning star, another symbol of Christ. "I am the root and offspring of David, the bright morning star" (Rev. 22:16). As the lotus responds to heliotrop- ism, turning its flower in the direction of the rising and setting sun, so the stained glass windows of the cathedral "turn" with the sun from the lights in the eastern apse to the rose in the western elevation. The worshipper responds to them in an analo- gous manner, not to the physical light, but, in a kind of spiritual heliotropism, to the "true light that enlightens every man" (Jn. 1:9). In most Gothic cathedrals there is no disposition made to admit the midday sun. In those cases where overhead lanterns are present they only allow indirect light. This bears out the opinion of all mystics, in- cluding that of St. Bernard de Clairvaux, that the direct vision of God is a blinding experience. "'That Vision which you asked to be shown is far beyond your powers, O my spouse', says the Bridegroom, 'nor are you strong enough to look upon the marvel- lous light of midday wherein I dwell.... "46 The stained glass windows, as we have seen, may be considered the skin of the "body" of the cathedral, and it follows from that that the walls must be its flesh, and the ribs the bone structure. St. Bernard, in his Com- mentary on the Song of Solomon, compared Christ's flesh to a wall. "Behold He standeth behind our wall, looking through the win- dows, looking through the lattices [1 Cant. 2:9] ... The Bridegroom drew near the wall when He assumed flesh. The flesh is the wall. The taking of it unto Himself by the Bridegroom is the Incarnation of the Word. Moreover, the windows and the lattices through which He is said to look are, as I understand it, the bodily senses and the hu- man affections through which He began to have experimental knowledge of all human needs."47 A major element of the interior is the ribbed vaulting, or the bone structure of the cathedral. Interestingly enough, the reason for the introduction of the ribbed vault is still unknown. Paul Frankl and many other leading scholars think that it was intro- duced mainly for aesthetic reasons. "... the Gothic three-dimensional rib was used for the first time to substitute for and correct the shaky one-dimensional lines of the groins in Romanesque cross vaults. The rib first served the aesthetic function of satisfy- ing the eye with the purity of the curve. Once it existed, it led not only to conse- quences in the realm of geometric construc- tion, technical process, economy of material, statics, and durability, but also in the realm of aesthetics and, in a narrower sense, of style."48 Ribbed vaults precipitated a revo- lution in mediaeval architecture, for they enabled the builders to manipulate vast areas of space and light which are of the essence in Gothic architecture. The pointed ribbed vault, however, coincides with two remarkable developments in mediaeval life. The first, in the realm of religion, was the substantial increase of devotion to the Vir- gin Mary, and the second, in the realm of science, the dissemination of anatomical knowledge from the medical schools of Chartres, Salerno, Montpellier, and Bo- logna. The extensive interest in human anatomy has not been sufficiently related to the de- velopment of the ribbed vaulting of Gothic cathedrals. Anatomical studies, particularly of the rib cage, helped the builders to clarify the allegory of the interior of the cathedral. These studies surely antedate the origin of the ribbed vault, and, while many points of contact between architecture and anat- omy are still obscure, the anthropomorphic</page><page sequence="14">16 PETER FINGESTEN terminology of architectural members points to connections.49 In spite of alchemy and witchcraft, medi- cine was practiced during the entire Middle Ages. Most monasteries had infirmaries, and hospitals were founded by special orders of hospitallers like the Order of St. John of Jerusalem and the Brothers of the Holy Ghost. The latter founded their most re- knowned hospital as early as 1145 at Mont- pellier. When St. Bartholomew's hospital was founded in London in 1123, there were already eighteen others in existence in Eng- land. From the early 13th century, on the inspiration of Pope Innocent III, Holy Ghost hospitals were founded in almost every town in Christendom.50 Peter His- panus, who became Pope John XXI in 1276, wrote several works on medicine. Among the traditional treatments and superstitions which he repeated there is also a long passage on the importance of the experi- mental method, or the "way of experience" coupled with "the path of reason.'51 A revival of medical learning took place at Chartres as early as Carolingian times.52 Theoretical anatomical studies were car- ried on through translations of medical works by the Persian Hali Abbas (D. 994), by Stephen of Antioch in 1127, and the in- fluential Canon of Avicenna by Gerald of Cremona who also translated the anatomi- cal works of the Persian Rhazes.53 These works themselves depended on Arabic trans- lations of Galen, the Roman medical genius of the 2nd century. The first medical school with a practical curriculum was located at Salerno in south- ern Italy. The regulations of Emperor Frederick II required that the medical stu- dent at Salerno take a course lasting five years, including anatomy and surgery. After passing an examination at the end of his course, he was required to intern for one year with a trained practitioner.54 At the end of the 12th century Salerno produced the first great western surgeon, Roger of Salerno, whose book, Practica Chirurgica, was widely read.55 During the 13th century, when the Gothic reached its maturity, post-mortems were al- ready being performed at the medical school of Bologna. The founders of its surgical school were Hugh of Lucca and his student, the cleric Theodoric Borgognomi. William of Saliceto, who taught at Bologna during that time, left a treatise on surgery which contains evidence of direct access to ca- davers. Thaddeus of Florence openly prac- ticed post-mortem examinations, as did his students. His most important pupil was the Norman Henri de Mondeville who, after studying at Bologna, returned to France and lectured on anatomy at the medical school of Montpellier. An illustrated book of his on anatomy, intended mainly for his students at the school, nevertheless exerted great influence far beyond its walls.56 The greatest anatomist of the Middle Ages was Mondino de Luzzi (c. 1270-1326) who stud- ied under Thaddeus of Florence at the same time as Henri de Mondeville. His Anotho- mia, written in 1316, is entirely devoted to anatomy. He dissected, and was a direct forerunner of the 16th century anatomist Vesalius. The school of Bologna dominated anatomical studies until the 16th century, but its books and students strongly in- fluenced the progress of anatomical studies beyond the Alps.57 In spite of the fact that cruciform cathe- drals are primarily allegories of the cruci- fied (St. Ambrose, Durandus), the great pro- fusion of cathedrals dedicated to Notre Dame during the 12th century and after was due to a shift in religious orientation and a corresponding reinterpretation of the in- terior of the cathedral in female terms. St. Bernard and many other mystics lavished their most abundant praise and adoration upon the Virgin. This devotion was shared by the sculptors who carved countless images of the Madonna and Child. There is a tradition which likened her to a temple as early as St. Ambrose, that she was not her- self "a God in the temple" but "a temple for God."58 This idea gained great momentum after the Council of Ephesus in 431 when the Theotokos doctrine became dogma. Soon she was compared to a kingly castle, for she gave birth to a king; also to a "shining palace for the Lord of Eternity." She was the "wedding-chamber" where the Creator united himself with his creation, and was likened to the "tent of the covenant into which God had entered to carry our</page><page sequence="15">Aspects of the Gothic Cathedral 17 the work of Atonement" and the "Holy Tabernacle filled with the glory of God."59 On occasion the term camera trinitatis was employed, as well as domus. To some mys- tics she was a throne when she held her divine son on her knee, as well as a vessel carrying a luck-bringing cargo.60 Anselm of Canterbury called her "0 Palace of uni- versal propitiation . . Vessel and Temple of the life and salvation of all...."61 And St. Francis of Assisi exclaimed, "Hail, palace of Christ, hail, tabernacle of Christ, hail, Mother of Christ!"62 In short, there is a large body of devotional and mystical litera- ture in which the Virgin Mary was com- pared to architectural structures. This im- agery was applied to the Gothic cathe- dral and led to a growing ambivalence of its allegorism. Abbot Suger called the church edifice itself "our mother" although in another place he calls it "house of God."63 William Durandus, about one cen- tury later, manifested the same ambivalence when he wrote "Again, the church is called the Body of Christ: sometimes a virgin,... sometimes a bride... sometimes a mother ... sometimes a daughter. .." and described the edifice itself as "the proper spouse of Jesus Christ."64 This tendency led to a reinterpretation of important elements of the cathedral. The door, a favorite symbol of Christ, as we have seen before, became the virginal door of Mary, or the "Gate, through which has passed the king!"65 This tradition survives even until today. Of mediaeval porches dedicated to the Virgin, Damasus Winzen, paraphrasing Ezekiel 44:2, writes, "She is the door 'through which no man has passed.' "66 The deeply splayed porches with their pointed arches certainly have anatomical connotations. As a matter of fact, the pointed arch was introduced in the West precisely when the worship of the Virgin Mar, had reached popular propor- tions and a new architectural style heralded the victory of a new direction in religious orientation. The windows of the cathedral which, ac- cording to Durandus, "transmit the light of the true Sun, that is, God" became sym- bols of Mary's virginity. A 13th century Christmas carol Dies est laetitiae is an il- lustration of this. As the sunbeam through the glass Passeth but not staineth, So the Virgin as she was Virgin still remaineth.67 There is a literal translation of this con- cept in the famous Merode Altarpiece by Robert Campin. The central panel of this tryptich, now at the Cloisters, Metropolitan Museum of Art, depicts the Virgin and the Angel of the Annunciation in her chamber. Through one of the two round windows behind the angel rays of light stream into the interior, composed of seven rays sym- bolizing the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost. Campin substituted these seven rays for the dove, the more conventional symbol of the Holy Ghost in most Annunciation scenes. The painter was familiar with the concept that Gothic stained glass windows sym- bolized the virginity of Mary, for he de- picted Christ as a tiny infant, face down amidst the light rays, floating through the window into her chamber, carrying a minia- ture cross on his right shoulder.68 In prayers in which the pious invoked the Virgin for their soul's safety she was often addressed as Fenestra Coeli, window of heaven.69 Splayed porches and deep, pointed em- brasures of windows no doubt contributed to an interpretation of these architectural elements in female anatomical terms, and their suggestiveness became overwhelming (Fig. 3). At the same time theologians were preoccupied with debating and defining the state of Mary's womb before, during, and after parturition.70 Most of the large Gothic cathedrals are built upon the cruciform ground plan, and, at consecration rituals, the verses from Revelation 21:1-5 were read. Was the pri- mary masculine interpretation of the in- terior obscured by a secondary female one, or did it become esoteric as far as the lay- men were concerned? A symbolic reinterpre- tation of architectural elements of the ca- thedral indeed took place, in other words, a merger between traditional (male) and new (female) allegories. Mediaeval ecclesiastics and builders be- came conscious of human anatomy in the wake of the widespread teaching and prac-</page><page sequence="16">18 PETER FINGESTEN 71 1/ ~ ~ rF~ --~ -II! ...'I , I-, i .. 1 ...... 1T 7i 1 l .I.....

Vierge Ouvrantes, popular carved images of pri- vate devotion in the later Middle Ages, combine the body of the Virgin and the body of Christ in an ingenious manner. When closed, the Madonna sits holding the Christ child upon her arm, but when opened, the interior reveals either a cruci- fixion, or, as in our illustration (Fig. 4), Christ sitting holding the cross in front of his knees. The interiors of the doors are gilt and decorated with scenes of the life of Christ. Closed, they create a vault-like womb that contains an image of Christ. Gothic cathedrals and Vierges Ouvrantes are expressions in their respective media of the same concept.71 The pointed ribbed vault system suggests the rib-cage of a gi- gantic mother bending over her son. The interior of the Gothic cathedral is an archi- tectural super-Vierge Ouvrante carrying the crucified in her womb. Cathedrals increased in size until they bulged like a woman high with child. The doors, now symbols of her virginal organ, lead into the interior which resembles a dissected female body. The interior organization ought to be considered then not so much a ribbed vault in a structural sense but as a rib-cage in a symbolic sense. The nave vaulting overhead seems to breathe and move; the succession of vaults gives the impression of a flexible rather than rigid system, suggest- ing generally the structural principles of a human rib-cage (Fig. 5). This symbolism was understood as such by mediaeval alle- gorists, mystics, builders, ecclesiastics, and artists. In one of Jan Van Eyck's early paintings, Madonna in a Church (Kaiser Friedrich Museum, Berlin),72 the Madonna with Child is represented disproportionately large in relationship to the Gothic interior which she seems to dwarf and overpower.</page><page sequence="17">...... .... .. ......... . ... . ..... ... ... .. ..

Seen from the east, immediately after en- tering the narthex of the cathedral, the crowns of French quadripartite and sex- partite vaults convey, in perspective, a con- tinuous band of vertebrae stretching the entire length of the nave. This impressive view is reinforced by the longitudinal French web in which the individual vaults (although still undulating) are given direc- tion by the ridge joint of the web. This longitudinal joint, evident in many cathe- drals (Chartres, Sens, Notre Dame of Paris, Amiens, Bourges) connects the keystones and bosses of each ribbed vault, and repre- sents an incipient ridge rib, or spinal cord. French architecture anticipated the struc- tural means of the vault as a rib-cage, but the English builders carried it to its most forceful expression. The final clarification was the introduction of the horizontal rib ridge which Francis Bond had already called the "spine" of the cathedral, but without seeing its further implications.74 The first purely "decorative," that is, non- functional, ridge rib is at Lincoln cathedral. Its interior is compelling in its suggestive- ness. Nowhere has the idea of a rib-cage and spinal cord been better expressed. In many English cathedrals the ridge rib ties keystone to keystone, boss to boss, or pend- ant to pendant. The symbolic intent of the vaulting is unmistakable, for the trumpet- shaped ribs do not seem to support the crown of the vaulting, but rather radiate Fig. 6. Winchester, Nave.

In English vaulting, intermediate ribs, or tiercerons, were added between the trans- verse and diagonal ribs. Soon after, a fur- ther element was introduced, in the form of liernes, short connecting ribs between tier- cerons. Clarence Ward accounts for them in this manner, "tiercerons are not essential members of the vaulting system, and per- haps they were better omitted altogether, but that their usage can be vindicated from an aesthetic standpoint is proved by such vaults as those at Exeter. .. [liernes] are the result of a striving for still more complex vaulting forms and still more decorative patterns in vault construction."75 It is highly questionable whether aesthetic val- ues and decoration took precedent over symbolism, particularly in mediaeval sacred architecture. Tiercerons and liernes are not the result of a more decorative but of a more symbolic striving. If the ridge rib represents the spinal cord, then the transverse and diagonal ribs, as well as tiercerons, represent a far more naturalistic representation of a rib-cage containing the cross. The small liernes connecting tiercerons may represent intercostal muscles running obliquely be- tween the ribs, exactly as liernes run be- tween tiercerons76 (Fig. 6). Beginning with Old St. Peter's, through the Romanesque and the Gothic style, it would seem as if the whole development of sacred Christian architecture is the clarifi- cation of one basic theme-the architectural symbolization of the incarnated Logos. The mediaeval cathedral exterior is an allegory of St. John's vision of the new Jerusalem descending upon Zion, and its interior the body of the Lord. The early Christian style did not have the means of expressing this allegory to its fullest extent, but the cruci- form ground plan was interpreted, as noted above, as a symbol of the crucified as early as the 4th century. The mature Roman- esque style is, perhaps, the most consistent expression of St. John's vision, for it is mas- culine aesthetically (heavy walls and piers), structurally (round-headed arch), as well as symbolically (cruciform ground plan). The Gothic style, while not abandoning the vision of St. John entirely, particularly on the exterior facade, represents, however, a feminized interpretation of the inte- rior aesthetically (lightness), structurally (pointed arch), as well as symbolically (the Virgin). The cruciform ground plan was adhered to, but these feminized elements were superimposed upon the traditional ground plan with its traditional symbolism. The Gothic cathedral is a compromise be- tween ancient scriptural traditions and the victory of the cult of the Virgin Mary. The mediaeval mind, overwhelmed by its own achievement, looked at the Gothic cathedral in bewilderment, as it were, and interpreted it in a lyrical fashion as a love song dedicated to the Virgin. The alle- gorists forgot the labor and science which constructed it, and saw only symbols, beauty, and refinement, and thus disre- garded the deep conflicts not only of their own times but of their religious attitude as well. 1R.
