      <p>In an interview, American artist Bruce Nauman recalled the 1960s, when he attended graduate school in fine arts at the University of California, Davis: “I was working very little, teaching a class one night a week, and I didn’t know what to do with all that time. . . . There was nothing in the studio because I didn’t have much money for materials. So I was forced to examine myself, and what I was doing there. I was drinking a lot of coffee, that’s what I was doing.”<sup>1</sup>
      </p>
      <p>Since that time, Nauman has explored bodily and cultural techniques such as walking, pacing around, jumping, or playing a musical instrument while recording these performances on film and video. The recorded activities are presented in a way that strips them of their self-evidence and brings the conditions that are imposed on visual and auditory perception by media technology to the fore. When one looks at and listens to the performances, media technology’s effect upon those activities is itself what is seen and heard. Screen and loudspeaker intervene in perception. Seeing and hearing, although grounded in psychophysiological principles, are not anthropological universals but must be learned, similar to laboratory- based skills discussed by historians and sociologists of science over the past twenty-five years.<sup>2</sup> By examining the role of enculturation in seeing and hearing, media studies can enrich histories of science interested in the importance of skill acquisition and representation. This article intends to contribute to such studies by investigating activities that can be seen and heard in Nauman’s videos: the body techniques displayed in his videos are learned. Perceiving them in turn exerts a specific feedback on the spectator. In order to grasp the problem that is posed by Nauman’s videos, it is not enough simply to differentiate between a perceiving subject and the perceived object. Nauman’s videos explore the relations between learned, habitual techniques of the body and perception.</p>
      <p>In the following, Nauman’s early video performances will be traced back to nineteenth-century experimental physiology. His art stages simple situations that, upon second glance, are rooted in those experimental explorations of the body, which used registration devices to analyze the movements of the body. Nauman performed simple activities, such as walking or playing a few notes on a violin, and recorded them on videotape with the technology of the 1960s. While the artist performed these activities in his studio under precisely defined conditions, as if he were investigating them, he left the analysis to the spectator. Yet his use of media technology introduces a second mode of artistic experimentation that will be shown to relate his explorations of body techniques to an exploration of his spectators’ perception. The spectators who watch the video are involved in an experimental setup that forces them to question their habits of perception. They experience the extent to which perception is shaped and formatted by such habits when they enter what I will call in the following the “audiovisual field” of Nauman’s videos. In this experience, what we usually accept as self- evident about our perception turns out to be produced to a great extent by media technology.<sup>3</sup> The following analysis of the audiovisual field centers on Nauman’s video <italic>Violin Tuned D.E.A.D</italic>. This piece questions a history of registration devices by confronting it with musicians’ instrumental training. The registration on video differs from the scientific inscription that emerged in physiological laboratories of the nineteenth century. The video does not aim directly at formalizing and quantifying, whereas an inscription yields standardized semiotic data.<sup>4</sup> As will be shown, the interrelation between art and science has migrated to the artist’s studio, turning it into a laboratory where the human body and perception are explored.</p>
      <p>The article will proceed in three steps. Throughout, concepts derived from analyses of the body and mind in the history of philosophy, physiology, anthropology, and psychology will be deployed as illuminating precursors and foils for Nauman’s interventions. The first part introduces the notion of body techniques, in order to grasp the artificiality of Nauman’s activities in front of the camera. His videotape <italic>Slow Angle Walk (Beckett Walk)</italic> is an example of Nauman carrying out the body technique of walking in a specific way. For simplicity, this analysis will concentrate on the visual aspects in Nauman’s construction of the audiovisual field.</p>
      <p>In the second step, the video <italic>Violin Tuned D.E.A.D.</italic> will be discussed to consider how Nauman carries out the culturally specific technique of playing the violin and how this specificity is made visible and audible in the video: screen and loudspeaker constitute an audiovisual field, whose consistency cannot be sufficiently explained as merely an opposition to everyday perception or as a defamiliarization of the latter. When a viewer looks at the video, seeing merges into the imagination of something seen; hearing in turn infers a source from the sound and provokes, referring to previous experience, an imagination of violin playing. Seeing and hearing thus conceal bits of imagination that are constantly feeding back into perception.</p>
      <p>I shall show in the third step how the audiovisual field in Nauman’s video pushes the viewer to continue this process of imagination, leading eventually to a semantics of exhaustion. Nauman’s video art explores auditory perception as well as musical practice by involving the spectator in a situation in which the violin is decoupled from the habitual inventory of movements. His performance equally questions the role of training and instrumental practice. The video shows the violin player in a situation that does not grant him access to the habitual body techniques, threatening the failure of conventional training. The spectator follows this movement up to a point where either the playing would have to be interrupted or new techniques of tone production would have to be invented, but at this point the video ends.</p>
      <p>Playing a musical instrument and presenting his performance on videotape, Nauman explores culturally constructed habits. In the video, the technology of film and video, the object of perception, and the execution of techniques of the body form a circular cohesion. Even though this circle involves movements of the human body, it is a thoroughly artificial product that does not even create the appearance of running smoothly or automatically. The body is certainly not just one object of perception among others. Rather, it is the point of reference for perception in general, which guarantees that the field of perception synthesizes spontaneously into one homogeneous unity. It would be misleading, however, to infer that this homogeneous unity is a given, nor is there a natural bond between its elements or between the visible and the audible. The spectator connects sound and image, synthesizing them into an audiovisual field, because this is what he or she has learned to do. The audiovisual field in Nauman’s art is, in addition, produced artificially and with the help of media technology. Rather than embedding its objects into the habitual audiovisual field of the spectator, it creates disjunctive syntheses that relate seeing and hearing only through disconnecting them. In this process, the automated, unreflected, and self-evident manner that is inherent to everyday perception can be actively experienced. The double exploration of body techniques and perception thus does not result in creating scientific knowledge, but it creates experiences this knowledge refers to.</p>

         <title>Body Techniques</title>
         <p>In 1968, Nauman made a video entitled <italic>Slow Angle Walk (Beckett Walk)</italic>.<sup>5</sup> No formatting was added to that produced by the basic technical conditions of the time. The video is black-and-white because this was the technological standard in the 1960s, and it lasts one hour because this was the length of a standard tape. The camera has a fixed position and thereby determines the frame. This technical feature, however, introduces a first disorientation for the spectator. Part of the activity Nauman performs takes place within this frame, and part of it outside. The viewer cannot see everything and misses some parts of the walk.</p>
         <p>Nauman described his walking protocol as follows: <disp-quote>
               <p>These steps are made by raising the leg, without bending the knee, until it is at a right angle to the body, then swinging 90 degrees in the direction indicated in the diagram. . . . The body then falls forward onto the raised foot and the other leg is lifted to again make a straight line with the body (which now forms a T over the support leg). The body swings upright with the non-support leg swinging through the vertical and into the 90-degree position, as at the start, and proceeds into the next 90-degree position, as at the beginning. Three step-turns to the right and then three step-turns to the left will advance you two paces—each three steps advances you one step.<sup>6</sup>
               </p>
            </disp-quote> This way of walking was inspired by Samuel Beckett’s novel <italic>Watt</italic> (1953); hence the video’s title.<sup>7</sup> Beckett’s protagonist Watt walks like this: <disp-quote>
               <p>Watt’s way of advancing due east, for example, was to turn his bust as far as possible towards the north and at the same time to fling out his right leg as far as possible towards the south, and then to turn his bust as far as possible towards the south and at the same time to fling out his left leg as far as possible towards the north, and then again to turn his bust as far as possible towards the north and to fling out his right leg as far as possible towards the south, and then again to turn his bust as far as possible towards the south and to fling out his left leg as far as possible the north, and so on, over and over again, many many times, until he reached his destination, and could sit down. So, standing first on one leg, and then on the other, he moved forward, a headlong tardigrade, in a straight line. The knees, on these occasions, did not bend. They could have, but they did not. No knees could better bend than Watt’s, when they chose, there was nothing the matter with Watt’s knees, as may appear. But when out walking they did not bend, for some obscure reason.<sup>8</sup>
               </p>
            </disp-quote> Nauman imitates this manner of walking, transposing it into a physical activity, which is recorded and presented on videotape; however, Nauman’s <italic>Beckett Walk</italic> does more than realize the way of walking Beckett invented. The video also translates the way in which this gait is textually represented. Beckett stripped the body technique of walking of its self-evidence and described it like a mechanically executed program. Although a person is walking here, this person—Watt—does not seem to walk by himself, but the movement seems to be driven by some unknown mechanism. The movement of legs in Watt’s gait is described almost geometrically; the natural gait, in contrast, defies calculation.</p>
         <p>From its very beginning, scientific research into human locomotion focused on the calculus of movement. But as it soon turned out, it is extremely difficult to describe what exactly happens while walking. In the eighteenth century, ways of walking were explored in the Prussian military. Tactical issues guided the search for an efficient way of walking, resulting in a walking style with straight knees. This matched the interest of the Prussian infantry in a regular and efficient way of movement that could be implanted in the body through drilling and exercise. Later, the military success of Napoleon’s army incited a new interest in walking. While the Prussian military had forced the soldiers’ bodies into the desired movement, now the spontaneous physiology of walking was used for developing efficient marching styles. Investigating these issues, physiologists encountered the natural self-regulation in walking movements.<sup>9</sup>
         </p>
         <p>In 1836, Wilhelm and Eduard Weber postulated in their groundbreaking book, <italic>Mechanics of the Human Walking Apparatus: An Anatomico-physiological Investigation</italic>, that it is impossible to give a theory of human movement. “It can perhaps be questioned,” the Webers wrote, “whether a theory of walking and running can be provided at all, since we are not walking machines, and these movements can be altered in many ways by our free will.”<sup>10</sup> The daily use of our legs happens unconsciously and automatically. One does not know what one is doing while walking: “Man binds his movements to certain rules, even if he cannot express these rules in words. These rules are based totally on the structure of his body and on the given external conditions.”<sup>11</sup>
         </p>
         <p>In their experiments, the two brothers found a very complicated but regular movement of human legs that one can perform even if tired or dead. They wrote: <disp-quote>
               <p>Even in a corpse, this swinging movement can be generated by pushing the legs, given that the stiffness caused by rigor mortis has passed or the stiffened muscles have been cut through. . . . From these circumstances it becomes evident that the equal duration of these oscillations is caused by gravity automatically, without involving our will.<sup>12</sup>
               </p>
            </disp-quote> The brothers demonstrated that the movement of the leg while walking is not that of a single pendulum, but that of a double pendulum swinging both from the hip and from the knee. This, however, was a mechanical figure that defied calculation even if it was governed by laws of mechanics. Although the human will could alter the regular movement of the human leg, humans were apparently unable to perceive the mechanics of the leg as a double pendulum. Therefore it was impossible to understand—whether through external or internal observation—precisely how the movement happens.</p>
         <p>During the nineteenth century, physiological research continued to investigate the human gait, now recording the movement with the help of technical media such as chronophotography and, later, film. Chronophotography and slow-motion cinematography altered our understanding of movements.<sup>13</sup> In the nineteenth century, physiologist Emil du Bois-Reymond told his colleague Wilhelm Weber that he had observed a peculiar effect in a chronophotographic registration of human walking: <disp-quote>
               <p>The place where one rests for a short time on both feet certainly looks completely as painters have always portrayed walking people, except that in the middle of the step, where the so-called moving leg swings past the standing leg, the most strange and even ludicrous sight appears: like a drunken town-musician, he seems to trip over his own feet, and no one has ever seen a walking man in such a position.<sup>14</sup>
               </p>
            </disp-quote> As Du Bois-Reymond watched the recorded motion, walking changed into something completely different from its everyday perception.</p>
         <p>In the course of this research, the human gait lost its self-evidence. Physiology discovered in the movement of the legs a phenomenon that was unfamiliar to the point of seeming unreal. Soon after, sociologists and ethnographers began questioning the distinction between natural and artificial ways of performing human activities. Eventually, in a lecture given at the Société de psychologie in Paris in 1934, French ethnographer and sociologist Marcel Mauss defined his concept of “techniques of the body” as follows: “I use the term ‘body techniques’ in the plural. . . . By this expression I mean the ways in which, from society to society, men know how to use their bodies.”<sup>15</sup> This idea had come to Mauss, he said, while he was reading the article on swimming from the 1902 edition of the <italic>Encyclopaedia Britannica</italic>. As Mauss observed, swimming styles had changed rapidly over the previous thirty years: <disp-quote>
               <p>Our generation has witnessed a complete change in technique: we have seen the breast-stroke with the head out of the water replaced by the different sorts of crawl. Moreover, the habit of swallowing water and spitting it out again has gone. In my days, the swimmers thought of themselves as a kind of steamboat. It was stupid, but in fact I still do this: I cannot get rid of my technique.<sup>16</sup>
               </p>
            </disp-quote> The historical change in swimming styles and the introduction of the front crawl in Europe disturbed the common understanding of the body as behaving in a natural way and performing movements naturally. This invited Mauss to speculate also on the formative powers that are capable of altering the body’s techniques. As one example, he suggested the influence of movies on the unconscious conception and execution of movement: <disp-quote>
               <p>I was ill in New York. I wondered where I had seen girls walking the way my nurses walked. I had time to think about it. At last I realized that it was in movies. Returning to France, I noticed how common this gait was, especially in Paris; the girls were French and they too were walking in this way. In fact, American walking fashions had begun to arrive over here, thanks to the movies. This was an idea I could generalize. The positions of the arms and hands while walking form a social idiosyncrasy—they are not simply a product of some purely individual, almost completely psychic, arrangements and mechanisms.<sup>17</sup>
               </p>
            </disp-quote> For Mauss, the “natural” state of the human body was no longer evident; although difficult to change, the techniques of the body were not anthropological universals—hence the necessity for human beings to have a mimetic model when learning to walk.</p>

         <title>Perception as a Technique of the Body</title>
         <p>It is impossible to decide in Nauman’s <italic>Beckett Walk</italic> whether the movement should be seen as a natural or artificial activity or technique of the body. Furthermore, it is impossible to reduce the video to a mere presentation or documentation of the performance. Rather, Nauman introduced certain features into his use of video technology that made the view unfamiliar to the spectator of the late 1960s. He mounted the camera in such a way that the vertical axis was rotated by ninety degrees. With reference to French philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty, the effect of the rotated camera can be explained as follows:<sup>18</sup> Because we are bodies—not because we have a body—our perception is always oriented. There is a great difference between a face that is seen in normal position and a face that is seen upside down; “for the subject of perception the face seen ‘upside down’ is unrecognizable.” The subject perceives an object as dependent on its own and the object’s position in space. Therefore the meaning of an object changes when it is not oriented in the usual way with relation to the body. Thinking, in contrast, abstracts from the actual position of the object in space, as Merleau-Ponty explains: “For the thinking subject a face seen ‘the right way up’ and the same face seen ‘upside down’ are indistinguishable.”<sup>19</sup> He thereby distinguishes the object, which remains the same, from the object’s perception, whose meaning can get lost when its orientation changes. He even claims: “To invert an object is to deprive it of its significance. Its being as an object is, therefore, not a being-for-the-thinking subject, but a being-for-the-gaze which meets it at a certain angle, and otherwise fails to recognize it.”<sup>20</sup> To see a face “is to take a certain hold upon it, to be able to follow on its surface a perceptual route with its ups and downs.” And this general orientation in space is “not a contingent characteristic of the object, it is the means whereby I recognize it and am conscious of it as an object.”<sup>21</sup> Obviously, it is possible to recognize a face when it is turned upside down or to bend the head to the side without the world becoming unrecognizable; however, Merleau-Ponty argues that the perception of objects is irreducibly anchored in spatial orientation, and everything we perceive refers to this orientation. Orientation is not just an additional aspect of our perception, it is a capacity human beings never lose, even when perceiving an inverted or rotated object: after a while things readjust.</p>
         <p>In Nauman’s works for video, the body techniques, their staging, and the presentation on a video screen intermingle. Both perception and body techniques relate to orientation in space, but in Nauman’s videos, this relation is interrupted. Nauman’s videos present their objects in such a way as to elude “natural” orientation or, more precisely, the habitual orientation of the body. To begin with, Nauman executes the body techniques in such a way as to disorient the viewer. The exaggerated, geometrical movements of the Beckett Walk do not correspond to the habitual placement of the walking body in space. Turning the camera at an angle of ninety degrees makes the body’s movements appear doubly transformed. What the spectators see does not easily translate into a normal view of the walking body. Still, seeing a body walking evokes the desire to understand these movements as connected to the ground. Nauman thus walks for an altered gaze: the meaning of walking is disturbed. The camera position transforms the principle of walking into a mode of perception. The body’s technique of walking has, as the Weber brothers showed, its fundamental condition in gravity; wherever a body is located and in whatever way the body is positioned, it always feels gravity. Nauman is working against this condition: the legs do not swing like a pendulum; they are moved intentionally. In addition, through the rotation of ninety degrees, the vertical and horizontal axes change places. Nauman’s way of walking without bending the knees emphasizes vertical and horizontal lines. He works against gravity with his walking, and the camera takes this up and continues it by disorienting the perception of the viewer, again by ninety degrees.</p>
         <p>At this point, it will be helpful to introduce the notion of a <italic>sensorimotor schema</italic>, which was prepared by Henri Bergson, introduced as a term by Jean Piaget, and further developed by Gilles Deleuze.<sup>22</sup> Whoever learns to see also learns that perception is continued into movement and that movement follows perception. When one person performs an activity, the perception of another person watching this activity is connected to that activity by a sensorimotor schema. The notion of sensorimotor schema, again, does not denote a natural connectivity between perception and movement, but their habitual coordination. This coordination must be learned; it also forms the backdrop for other perceptions that are not related to movements of the perceiver. The sensorimotor schema is an elastic band that does not break, even when the viewer is standing still and the movement viewed makes reference only to a virtual, hypothetical movement in the viewer’s own body.</p>
         <p>When Nauman’s video confronts the spectator with a movement that defies immediate correlation to the viewer’s perception, her perception gets correlated to such a virtual movement. Because the video disorients the viewer’s perception, it also disturbs her sensorimotor schema. The viewer actively strives to establish the connection between her own perception and the viewed movement. Perception is thus not merely embodied, but is itself a technique of the body that, like any other technique of the body, is not naturally given but must be learned.</p>

      <sec id="sc3">
         <title>Perception of the Audiovisual Field</title>
         <p>In a ten-minute black-and-white video that Nauman made in 1967–8, <italic>Playing a Note on the Violin while I Walk around the Studio</italic>, he walks to and fro, incessantly sawing at a violin. The camera rests in a fixed position, image and soundtrack run asynchronously, and now and then Nauman disappears from the frame. He reported in an interview, “In one of those first films, the violin film, I played the violin as long as I could: I don’t know how to play the violin, so it was hard, playing on all four strings as fast as I could as long as I could. I had ten minutes of film and ran about seven minutes of it before I got tired and had to stop and to rest a little bit and then finish it.” When asked by the interviewer, “But you could go on longer than the ten minutes?” Nauman replied, “I would have had to stop and rest more often. My fingers got very tired and I couldn’t hold the violin any more.”<sup>23</sup>
         </p>
         <p>In <italic>Violin Tuned D.E.A.D.</italic> of 1969, Nauman tackled the relation of time and bodily movement in his violin playing from a different angle: “I wanted to set up a problem where it wouldn’t matter whether I knew how to play the violin or not. What I did was to play as fast as I could on all four strings with the violin tuned D, E, A, and D, rather than the customary G, D, A, and E.”<sup>24</sup> This video lasts for one hour. The visible effort of the player, Nauman explained, conveys to the viewer the sincerity of his activity: “If you are honestly getting tired, or if you are honestly trying to balance on one foot for a long time, there has to be a certain sympathetic response in someone who is watching you.”<sup>25</sup> The extended duration of the performance not only exposes the viewer to a sensorimotor schema, but it also leads to the player’s exhaustion, which in turn becomes visible and thereby even more strongly appeals to the viewer to comprehend the sensorimotor schema. In the video, Nauman turns his back to the camera, the axis of which is again rotated by ninety degrees. As he explained to the interviewer, the violin strings are tuned to the pitches D, E, A, and D, and he plays the open strings from the lowest to the highest in one down-bow, that is to say, in the particular order of the letters D, E, A, D, producing the sound in one movement.</p>
         <p>In the video, Nauman is seen only from the back. According to the phenomenological analysis of perception, a viewer is able to imagine the side of an object that is hidden from view. The object’s reverse side is made “co- present,” by “analogous apperception,” as this process was described by Edmund Husserl: “An appresentation occurs even in external experience, since the strictly seen front of a physical thing always and necessarily appresents a rear aspect and prescribes it for a more or less or determined content.”<sup>26</sup> Alfred Schütz explained the ability to appresent an object as follows: <disp-quote>
               <p>When we apperceive an object of the external world, we see, strictly speaking, only the front aspect of it. This perception of the visible front also contains the analogous apperception of the unseen rear aspect. The latter is, however, only an empty expectation of what we would perceive if we would turn the object around or walk behind it. This anticipation is learned and based on our past experiences of normal objects of this kind.<sup>27</sup>
               </p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>Nauman dealt with the problem inherent to appresentation in a short, untitled text that sketches a hypothetical performance that is supposed to detach the gaze from its grounding in the body schema.</p>
         <disp-quote>
            <p>A person enters and lives in a room for a long time—a period of years or a lifetime. One wall of the room mirrors the room but from the opposite side: that is, the image room has the same left-right orientation as the real room.</p>
         </disp-quote>
         <disp-quote>
            <p>Standing facing the image, one sees oneself from the back in the room, standing facing a wall.</p>
         </disp-quote>
         <disp-quote>
            <p>There should be no progression of images: that can be controlled by adjusting the kind of information the sensor would use and the kind the mirror wall put out.</p>
         </disp-quote>
         <disp-quote>
            <p>After a period of time, the time in the mirror room begins to fall behind the real time—until after a number of years, the person would no longer recognize this relationship to his mirrored image. (He would no longer relate to his mirrored image or delay of his own time.)<sup>28</sup>
            </p>
         </disp-quote>
         <p>Similar to the situation in René Magritte’s painting <italic>Réproduction interdite</italic>, the person in the room would see his own back view in a mirror, which in addition would follow his own movements. He would thus see himself as seen by others. He would by no means become disembodied, but his visual perspective would be placed outside of his own body, and he would have to learn to see himself from outside and to regain consciousness of his own body’s coordinates.</p>
         <p>The function undertaken by the mirror room is accomplished by the technically produced audiovisual field in <italic>Violin Tuned D.E.A.D.</italic>: the audiovisual field detaches perception from its anchoring in the body, only to place the—now unfamiliar—perception back in the body again. Turning his back to the camera, Nauman creates an expectation of how his front would appear. The camera positioning disorients perception and unsettles the meaning of what can be seen. The back view of the player stimulates the appresentation of his front view. As long as the viewer sees the source of the sound, that is to say, the violin player, the habitual image of a violin player in a frontal position is automatically coproduced. The ear, in turn, processes the information that comes out of the loudspeaker: although it does not hear the sound of the original source, but the recorded sound, it has learned to infer from the latter to the former. The extent to which the body shapes musical notes became evident when electronic music confronted listeners with an alternative. In electronic music the production of sound does not have to make its way through the body of the musician to become audible. The electronic music of the 1950s and ’60s allowed the perception for the first time of a new class of audible objects that were not a part of the circle that connected the listeners’ bodies, via sound, with the musicians’ bodies. Electronic music thereby revealed the hidden anthropomorphism in any sound produced by the dispositive of player and instrument.<sup>29</sup> The loudspeaker further defines the spatiality of hearing because it is not just a neutral transmission device: any sound that is heard will thus be constructed, resulting from a complicated psychophysical calculus. While sound transmission disconnects the sound from the situation where it originated, hearing engages in reconstructing this situation, binding it back to a source and the source’s position.</p>
         <p>Nauman’s violin video dissolves the correlation of bodily movement, hearing, and seeing as it has been established in everyday experience. Although viewers think that the sound source is visible, they can only speculate about the act of sound production; although they hear the sound, they have to infer from the loudspeaker to the sound source. Nauman’s visible body, however, complicates these inferences. The viewers will relate what they see to what they hear, correlating sound and movements by referring them to their own body. Here again Nauman’s work can be seen to engage with the history of the experimental study of bodily and mental processes. Starting in the second half of the nineteenth century, physiology and psychology investigated the perception of time. As was found out, the perception of time is actively coupled to the perception of one’s bodily actions: a listener measures acoustic events by comparing them to the movements of his or her own body. The perception of temporal relations is carried out through so-called registering movements of one’s body.<sup>30</sup> The perception of the sequence of notes D, E, A, D in Nauman’s film thus takes two steps. The listener continues the perceived sequence in movements produced by his or her own body to perceive the difference between the perceived sequence and his or her own movements. This difference becomes the actual referent of the temporal perception.</p>
         <p>Tuning the violin to D, E, A, D instead of the usual G, D, A, E, Nauman creates an indefinite, but intense, semantics. He does not apply the common bow technique, which he has not learned, but produces the sounds with a high expenditure of energy. Although the resulting sounds are shaped by a bodily gesture, they remain far removed from the ideal of the beautiful tone. This exposes the body in a new way. In the video, he repeats the same bowing gesture over and over for a seemingly endless time. This is a standard situation in pedagogical practice; that of the pupil who repeats the “correct” movement in order to appropriate it. In traditional violin pedagogy, special attention is paid to the generation of the tone: students learn to construct and control a “beautiful tone,” considered to be the result of a specific movement that must be acquired and trained.<sup>31</sup> Players are urged to control their movements with the ear, which means that they have to build a feedback loop incorporating the body’s appearance, movement, and hearing. The player’s body and the instrument produce a tone whose quality in turn allows a listener to infer back to the way in which the tone’s production occurred. Nineteenth-century instrumental pedagogy developed an exercise routine that decomposed playing into elementary movements and drilled the movements until they were automatic.<sup>32</sup> If instrumental lessons had to surmount difficulties in order to discipline the body, this was not so much because obstinacy or the lack of assiduity in the pupils compromised the effort, but because fatigue jeopardized the playing as a whole. The disciplining of the body finds its greatest enemy in fatigue, which cannot simply be passed over or broken. The pupil has to accommodate his or her own body and its unavoidable fatigue. Nauman, however, takes his body to the limit of discipline and fatigue, which is exhaustion. The movements are repeated endlessly, become recursive, and form a rhythm of autoreflexivity. Inasmuch as his movements lack a destination, they do not obey a rule that would indicate the point at which they must end.</p>

         <title>Playing on Until Exhaustion</title>
         <p>In the 1860s, Italian physiologist Angelo Mosso was the first to investigate fatigue systematically.<sup>33</sup> He invented the so-called ergograph, a device that recorded the working performance of experimental subjects, and he was able to demonstrate that one of the most specific characteristics of any individual’s life is the way he or she gets tired. The phenomenon of fatigue is governed by natural laws; it is inevitable that everyone gets tired, but everyone gets tired in an individual way. He also showed that fatigue alters the personality once a certain threshold is transgressed. <disp-quote>
               <p>Extreme fatigue, whether intellectual or muscular, produces a change in our temper, causing us to become more irritable; it seems to consume our noblest qualities—those which distinguish the brain of civilized from that of savage man. When we are fatigued we can no longer govern ourselves, and our passions attain to such violence that we can no longer master them by reason. Education, which is wont to curb our reflex movement, slackens the reins, and we seem to sink several degrees in the social hierarchy.<sup>34</sup>

         </p>
         <p>Mosso’s investigations awakened the interest of psychiatry. German psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin and his assistant William Halse Rivers began to experiment with fatigue and its consequences. They discovered that fatigue was unavoidable and that it protected an organism against exhaustion: “No doubt, fatigue begins at the same time as the action itself. To avoid the occurrence of fatigue would mean to renounce work itself. Even without any work, we could not avoid getting tired.”<sup>35</sup> Whatever you are doing or not doing, you will get tired, for it is not work alone that is tiring, but idleness, too. The first sign of fatigue Kraepelin and Rivers determined was a rise in the number of mistakes made by an experimental subject performing some task. It is possible to counteract fatigue to a certain degree by resting, eating, drinking, and sleeping, on the one hand, and by regular training and effort of will, on the other. The signs given by the body should by no means be disregarded. Fatigue that eventually leads to sleep is a way for the body to protect itself from the more extreme and potentially injurious state of exhaustion. Normally, the body is capable of governing itself.</p>
         <disp-quote>
            <p>Prolonged work produces fatigue and with it difficulty of further application. Up to a certain degree, this fatigue, which may be considered as a safeguard against overwork, may be overcome by an increased exertion of will power, which in long and fatiguing work gives rise to a feeling of “increased effort.”<sup>36</sup>
            </p>
         </disp-quote>
         <p>The self-protection of the working body can be suspended. Effort of will can compensate for fatigue and does not lead to exhaustion. This explanation, however, was partly motivated by Kraepelin’s desire to avoid concluding that effort of will might in fact lead to exhaustion, because will was considered at the time to be within the framework of reasonable behavior. <disp-quote>
               <p>While the increased exertion of the will can for a time balance the effects of fatigue through an increased expenditure of power, the effects of fatigue ultimately gain the upper hand and force one to cease work. The first indications of exhaustion are when, under certain conditions, the increased exertion of will continues for some time in spite of the uncomfortable feeling of fatigue. This is what happens when work is performed under intense emotional excitement. The signs of fatigue, which call for relaxation, either do not appear or are overwhelmed, and work is prolonged beyond a permissible degree.<sup>37</sup>
               </p>
            </disp-quote> Passion, in contrast to will, drives one’s work level over the threshold and leads to exhaustion and self- damage. Therefore, the performing arts such as theater and music can be dangerous when practiced with great passion.<sup>38</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Scientists gave a number of different explanations for the psychophysiological processes of fatigue and exhaustion. Fatigue was seen as resulting from the consumption of a substance or as a self-intoxication by the products of metabolism. Exhaustion was defined as the destruction of the foundations of psychic processes due to excessive consumption or insufficient recreation. Notwithstanding the different explanations given by the scientists, they all agreed on the danger that results from exhaustion. Exhaustion causes a permanent reduction in working energy. Psychiatrists warned that increasing fatigue was the first step toward the self-destruction of the nervous system through its own activity. Therefore, they considered the exhausted person to be in a dangerous state that they compared to mental illness, especially to psychosis. The consequences of exhaustion are, in the wording of the psychiatrists, a dissociation of the personality, a loss of personality, and an abolition of the self. Exhausted subjects are only a mechanically driven bundle of functions. They are in danger of serious damage and present a risk to their environment. The symptoms of exhaustion are not apathy, withdrawal from activity, and extinction of movements, but mere action. The danger for the exhausted lies in the fact that they continue their activity like an overheated machine performing idle motion or an idiot performing repetitive stereotypical movements.</p>
         <p>Whereas the tired person is able to resume activity in a predictable way, it is uncertain whether and how the exhausted one can ever do so. Pausing or sleeping enables the tired to take up their activity anew or to continue their thoughts; they do not quit the activity, but suspend or defer it. Therefore, lying down prepares the tired to fall asleep, and sleeping, in turn, prepares them to resume the interrupted activity. Yet exhaustion is something different. Deleuze discussed the role of exhaustion in Beckett’s novels and plays and observed that “lying down is never the end, the last word, but rather the penultimate, and there is too much risk of being rested enough, if not to get up, at least to roll or to crawl.”<sup>39</sup> The exhausted subject is beyond any calculus of activity; she would do anything to continue an activity rather than stop for recreation. The tired person will rely on her habit and perform the body technique in the way it has been learned. She will abandon her movements at some moment, but the exhausted person goes on. The tired person, according to Deleuze, “is no longer prepared for any possibility (subjective): he therefore cannot realize the smallest possibility (objective). . . . The tired has only exhausted realization, while the exhausted realizes all of the possible.”<sup>40</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Exhaustion is not just an amplification of tiredness, but a different state. The tired person wants to continue his activity and therefore rests in order to take it up again in the habitual way. The automatism in body techniques guarantees continuation: one who performs in a certain way can rely on automatism and not be forced to change the manner of movement. The exhausted person will perform an activity even if she makes mistakes and loses control or will perform the activity in an unpredictable way. When, in the state of exhaustion, the performer begins to lose control of the activity, the activity will be carried out in an indefinite way, and the economy of means and ends begins to be undermined. When arms and fingers begin to hurt, and the violin threatens to fall, even acquired techniques can no longer be executed. If the player still wants to continue, she has to think of some new technique. Playing the violin in a new way does not mean here that one exceptional occurrence is to be singled out, but rather that playing as a whole is being transformed. At any moment, the next movement is the only aim. The exhausted player cannot rely on acquired body techniques because the self-regulation of the body has broken down. Therefore, new forms or ways of movement must be invented in order to continue. As Beckett’s Unnamable puts it, “That the impossible should be asked of me, good, what else could be asked of me?”<sup>41</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Exhaustion is an ambivalent state. It opens up the possibility of doing something new, but it also contains a lethal danger. In <italic>Violin Tuned D.E.A.D.</italic>, Nauman attains a state where violin playing becomes exhausting and where something unforeseen can occur. The new does not appear at a moment that can be indicated, at a distinct point in the notes he plays, or in the form of a new combination of tones, but it is something that interrupts the self-evidence of the playing. The automatism of executing a self-evident movement guarantees continuation in the playing of an instrument. A trained violinist who is able to continue can entrust continuation to her acquired automatism, even when improvising; it then becomes unnecessary to make decisions about whether to stop or to continue. This automatism does not include any rule governing when to stop; the aim of practicing is to continue. In this mode of automatic playing anything new that occurs consists of combination and variation of the acquired and the known.</p>
         <p>Nauman’s violin playing, in contrast, seems to be constantly endangered: at any moment, he may have to stop. Continuation is not just endangered; it becomes completely unclear in what way it can be possible for him to continue. Nauman cannot refer to acquired techniques. Rather, the repeated action shown in the video takes part in his process of movement acquisition. The principle that constitutes this way of playing lies at every moment in the actual present. This is emphasized by the use of sound: the long reverberation in the empty studio points, in this case, to the synchronicity of what can be seen and heard. From this a kind of music emerges that does not have to make its way along the circular path through the body—the path that involves acquired abilities, techniques, and automatisms. Rather, the video registers an individual activity that provokes the viewer to observe whether and how long Nauman will be able to go on with his unruly and uneconomic practice of violin playing. This is an experimental use of musical body techniques that results in an inconceivable new piece of music.</p>
         <p>However, the exhaustion leading to this music cannot be understood as a desirable state that eventually allows creativity to come into being. Exhaustion does not always lead to something new. More often, it leads to death. The title that Nauman chose for his violin performance unmistakably points to this: <italic>Violin Tuned D.E.A.D.</italic> Even though the arbitrary letters that name the tones turn into a meaningful word here, this pun does not acquire meaning from the symbolic operation alone, but also from Nauman’s specific way of playing the violin. The title points to the disjunctive synthesis in the audiovisual field: just as perception synthesizes the heterogeneous orders of vision and audition by forcing them together into one field, so the title of the video connects unrelated orders. And so also the media technology of video generates a disjunctive synthesis, binding the heterogeneous orders of sound and image with a technical bond. The title thus creates a meaning by connecting the heterogeneous orders of notes, letters, and linguistic code. Nauman’s title acts like a <italic>symbolon</italic>. This Greek word denotes a specific operation of concatenation, of aligning and fusing parts together. Originally, it was used for a ring of clay that could be broken into two parts but later joined into one whole again. The specific materiality of the clay and the way in which the ring was broken guaranteed that only the parts of the original ring could be fitted together with each other. Nauman’s title, however, does not join fitting parts, as did the Greek <italic>symbolon</italic>, but heterogeneous parts. He offers no explanation of how cohesion might be guaranteed among the orders of sound, image, perception, and the body, which are forced together in his videos; instead, he points, however ironically, to the activity of the artist: <italic>The True Artist Helps the World by Revealing Mystic Truths</italic>, as the title of another of his works has it. These mystic truths are hidden in a ring of media technology, perception, and techniques of the body, which Nauman does not break in two, but rather shatters into innumerable splinters.</p>
         <p>In his video <italic>Violin Tuned D.E.A.D.</italic> Nauman appears to be an anonymous figure whose identity—encoded, again, in the front view—remains in suspense. Turning his back to the camera, he avoids the classic position of the virtuoso. This posture, in combination with the tilted camera that immediately prostrates Nauman in the position of a tired and even exhausted man, interrupts the continuity of vision and audition. The sounds he produces in one way or another do not refer to a personal style but become detached from the body in a strange manner. The emergence of the new requires a paradoxical individuation: no matter how self-obsessed the player may be, he does not refer to himself while he plays. He plays something that points beyond himself, something that, however, does not make him bigger: playing is not intended to amplify the self.</p>
         <p>Nauman’s videos present body techniques in a way that strips them of their self-evidence while constituting an audiovisual field. The videos dissolve the correlation of bodily movement, hearing, and seeing as it has been learned by the viewers under specific, given conditions and reconfigure this interrelationship in a new way. In this process, the pedagogical calculus that typically adjusts the movements of playing the violin to hearing is undermined. Both Nauman’s playing and the video technology efface the necessary points of reference for coordinating bodily movement and sound, seen and heard perception. The videos construct a disjunctive synthesis of sound and image. Vision and audition are disconnected from their anchoring in the body with the eventual result that the cultural semantics of violin playing is unsettled. This audiovisual field in Nauman’s videos can no longer be conceived of as the retroactive defamiliarization of natural perception and its subsequent aesthetization. Rather, media technology, body techniques, and the habits of perception determine how vision and audition interact in the videos.</p>
