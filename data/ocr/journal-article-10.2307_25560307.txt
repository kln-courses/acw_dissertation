<plain_text><page sequence="1">The People of the Sea David Thompson Canongate Classics ?6.99 ISBN 1 84195 107 2 The Celtic schtick is by now a little overused, in writing and music. It is of like genus to the commercial necro philia which beleaguers dead rappers where off colour macs become hobby horses all but used to model clothing, or anchor inventive spring break hug hump marathons for the gratification of the music television programmers. That, and the faintly generic intro duction by Heaney which adheres to this reprinted work aside, this book still has got real charm. Written over some decades, The People of the Sea is a lambent chroni cle of an Oxonian's journeys through early 20th century Ireland, Orkneys and Hebrides. It focuses on the vari ous folklore surrounding what the Scots term selchies atlantic seals with such appreciable emotion and intel ligence that they were associated with landdwellers; as well as the interface of same with those very island/ coastal peoples. In so far as it holds to the thesis the book certainly succeeds; providing such scholarly research as an addendum of annotated seal song. Yet interestingly, there is a co-mix ture of elements; remote autobiogra phy, anthropology, and elegy. The last; for the book depicts seafaring communities and their civilization of stories as moving into obsolescence. Various stories and characters eddy within the binds. They are related with seeming artlessness, and light touch. Thompson seems to have al lowed himself to succeed in that nec essary task of letting the characters speak. That while counter-pointing the world depicted with an unobtru sive yet certain foreignness. A narra tive of similar modesty explicates the depopulation of Islands Aran, Shet land and co., through the disappear ing of children to inland towns and cities for reasons of economics and excitation which the islands could not answer. The seals, and the lore sur rounding them, relating normally to anthropomorphic fancy, are ap pointed great credulity. They serve to evidence the humanity and great broad care of these people. Legends such as that of the King Seal and King Conn recur with an artisanal metrical logic which is original and unforced. A reflective mind and a good ear Thompson evidently had, and he was little jealous of others song, selchie or human. The book stands as proof of how good prose need not bully, and evidences with respect the passing of a people wondering close to the cadence of the sea. ^ Cian O'Neill</page></plain_text>
