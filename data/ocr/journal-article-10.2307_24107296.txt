Okeke Department of Biology, Haverford College, 370 Lancaster Avenue, Haverford, PA 19041, USA When moderate benefits might accrue to individuals, the absence of incentive for a more valuable common good can lead to consequent societal catastrophe. Pro posals for dealing with this type of problem have been examined within multiple, typically economic or eco logical frameworks. Antimicrobial resistance is a global and growing anthropomorphic problem. Pathogen susceptibility to antimicrobial drugs is a resource, whose exploitation has been likened to a Prisoner's Dilemma game or a Hardin-type tragedy of the com mons. As with actual commons, motivating altruism and enforcing favourable outcomes are potential strategies for preserving an antimicrobial susceptibility com mons. However, unlike the prototypical tragedy of the commons example of an overgrazed pastureland, users of the antimicrobial susceptibility commons are often blind to virtually complete deterioration of the resource, precluding timely implementation of inter ventions for control. Collection and dissemination of information about the state of the susceptibility commons is essential for achieving a 'recognition of necessity' and for moderating the preservation of sus ceptibility. The most reliable information can only come from the dissemination of drug susceptibility data collected and compiled by laboratories. In deve loping countries, enhanced access to limited quantities of a smaller repertoire of antimicrobials is often cou pled with a higher infectious disease burden, resulting in a considerably strained commons where the need to provide information to support and guide resistance containment is most pressing. Keywords: Antimicrobial resistance, drug resistance surveillance, prisoners' dilemma, tragedy of the commons. Antimicrobial resistance is compromising our ability to treat infection and currently represents a major roadblock for global disease control1. More than 60% of Staphylo coccus aureus isolates recovered in some US and UK hospitals in recent times have been methicillin-resistant 5. aureus (MRSA). Other multidrug-resistant pathogens such as vancomycin-resistant enterococci and multiply resistant Gram-negative rods like Acinetobacter baumanii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are emerging and spreading rapidly". Community-acquired infections caused by organisms such as MRSA and Mycobacterium tuberculo e-mail: iokeke(5)haverford.edu sis are becoming increasingly common in industrialized countries. In addition to these organisms, many develop ing countries are battling multidrug-resistant enteric bacteria and malaria parasites3'4. Extensively-resistant M. tuberculosis, quinolone-resistant Salmonellae and vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus represent recently emerged pathogens that can cause potentially untreatable infections; something that human-kind has not faced in almost three-quarters of a century. Ehrlich5 foretold an era of drugs that could destroy pathogens without harming their hosts but it was many years later before humans created a drug susceptibility 'resource', which is the foundation for Ehrlich's principle of chemotherapy. The semi-serendipitous discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming is a critical milestone because it spurred the discovery of similar agents pro duced by some micro-organisms, which could inhibit oth ers6. These antibiotics became a mainstay of clinical care, revolutionizing treatment for patients with bacterial infections. Thus, humans created a chemotherapeutic sphere where infecting organisms could be eliminated, preserving the life of the host. In addition to antibiotics, which are natural products, other effective antimicrobials have been chemically synthesized. The term antimicro bial, being all-encompassing is employed here. The age of antimicrobial chemotherapy began with a period of chemotherapeutic optimism during which it was thought that antibiotics would relegate infectious diseases to the pages of history and the 'book on infectious dis eases' was described as being all but closed1. By the 1980s, it was clear that a significant proportion of this optimism was misplaced and that infectious diseases would continue to threaten human and animal welfare*. Infection continues to be the major cause of illness and death in most tropical countries. There and elsewhere, new pathogens were emerging, and HIV and medical sci ence created susceptible hosts for opportunistic patho gens. At the same time, previously effective therapies were unexpectedly being overcome by microbial genetic innovation, assisted by selective pressure from excessive and indiscriminate antimicrobial use. A period of chemo therapeutic challenge has replaced that of optimism and there is now a pressing need to tackle infectious disease challenges in general, and resistance in particular, to stem the tide. If the current trajectory continues unabated, we could reach a third, post-antimicrobial period. 1564 CURRENT SCIENCE, VOL. 97, NO. 1!, 10 DECEMBER 2009</page><page sequence="2">SOCIETY AND SCIENCE - INTERDISCIPLINARY EXCHANGES Antimicrobials provide almost instant gratification in the form of infectious disease cure, where necessary, and in the many other instances they are administered unjusti fiably, a placebo effect. Resistance, an unavoidable adverse consequence of antimicrobial use, is magnified when antimicrobials are used when not indicated, too little drug is used per infection, or when the duration of ther apy is too short. Resistance is essentially a conservation problem arising from the natural tendency to prefer im mediate to long-term rewards, even when the latter are of greater value9. The archetypical model for overcoming resistance is a disposable drug strategy - as resistance appears, older drugs are discarded and replaced with new drugs with novel mechanisms. A disposable system can only be sustained if the rate of new drug development exceeds that of resistance emergence. Presently, due to scientific, economic and political constraints, microbes develop resistance faster than humans develop antimicro bials. Even if the rate of antimicrobial development were to accelerate after the current dip10, a significant lag period must be expected because new drug development takes almost two decades. Antimicrobial resistance has most commonly been the concern of clinicians and biologists. Although a biologi cal phenomenon, resistance is in fact a public health and socioeconomic problem and linked to behavioural patterns. As with similar problems, solutions are just as likely to come from the social as from the natural sci ences. There is therefore a need for radical and interdis ciplinary thinking about resistance control and anti microbial conservation. A resistance dilemma The invention of antimicrobials created an exploitable and potentially finite microbial susceptibility resource"'12. The growing resistance paradigm that threatens this resource can be represented by the game theory scenario referred to as the 'Prisoner's Dilemma'13. In a simple Prisoner's Dilemma setting, two guilty individuals are accused of a collaborative crime for which their testi mony will constitute evidence. Each prisoner must inde pendently decide whether to cooperate with his colleague or defect. If both cooperate, neither can be convicted. If one defects, the other is convicted and the defector rewarded and if both defect, both loose14. The structure of payoffs in the Prisoner's Dilemma is such that the stable strategy for each player is to defect rather than cooperate. If the prisoners are permitted to communicate with each other, the stable outcome is changed: they will inevitably choose to cooperate. When information cannot be shared, each participant defects simply because there is a chance that the other will defect. Thus, if the resistance problem is to be viewed as a Prisoner's Dilemma, a solution might be transparency about the magnitude and consequences of antimicrobial use, that is surveillance. The outcome of communication in the antimicrobial resistance dilemma is even better than for the pure Prisoner's Dilemma in that there is the potential for the development of resistance to be slowed or even reversed (Figure I). A simple Prisoner's Dilemma game is convenient for highlighting the importance of surveillance in resistance control and compelling in other ways but is too simplistic to account for many of the nuances of the multiplayer, non-symmetric resistance problem. There are other public goods games which illustrate one of more aspects of the resistance problem but the closest parallel to the problem of resistance appears to be a more nuanced Prisoner's Dilemma known as the 'Tragedy of the Commons'. The antimicrobial resistance tragedy of the commons The most frequently referenced version of the tragedy of the commons was originally described by Hardin15 as overexploitation of exhaustible collective property occa sioned by population increase. The consequence is destruction and a loss to all users of the common resource. Hardin illustrates the tragedy with the example of a common grazing ground to which all herdsmen have access for the use of their cattle. The individual herdsman who adds to his herd maximizes his own gain to the det riment of the community. Were every user to do likewise, the commons would deteriorate until it ceases to be a resource for all. Hardin extended this scenario to many population-based resource problems including the erosion of public parks, the fishing of common seas and pollu tion. Others have included additional environmental and economic resource problems including firewood crises in developing countries, acid rain, traffic congestion, and even US Congress overspending problems (reviewed by Ostrom16). As initially observed by Baquero and Campos17, a number of features of the antimicrobial resistance prob lem make it almost a tragedy of the commons exemplar. There is a lag period before a commons becomes limited because hazards of the environment keep the population in tune with the resource capacity. In the same vein, in the years following the discovery of penicillin, the diffi culty in obtaining sufficient amounts of the drug (the drug was extracted from the urine of the earliest patients for reuse) ensured that overuse did not occur. The idea of applying an antimicrobial without a precise indication was untenable in those days so that use of these drugs was kept below a threshold, analogous to under-grazing of Hardin's commons at a time when the numbers of users is kept below 'the carrying capacity of the land'. When we learned to produce antimicrobials in large fer mentation vats, and through chemical synthesis, supply became, for all intents and purposes, unlimited and a CURRENT SCIENCE, VOL. 97, NO. 11, 10 DECEMBER 2009 1565</page><page sequence="3">SPECIAL SECTION: A.

In an antimicrobial resistance Prisoner's Dilemma game, it pays to use antimicrobials in complete disregard to their effect of resistance emergence and spread in the absence of surveillance. tragedy set in. Using antimicrobials, even in the most remote chance of an infection, was perceived to be bene ficial as it is in the short term. According to Hardin15, the paradigm is best applied to those examples for which there is no technical solution. Developing new drugs has proved to be too slow to accommodate the escalating rate of resistance. Other technologies for fighting resistance such as resistance-proof drugs, alternatives to chemo therapeutics, or chemical agents that could reverse resis tance are emerging at an even slower rate. Thus, although there may be changes with time, at present, the problem of resistance does not have a feasible technological solu tion now. Previous models of the antimicrobial susceptibility commons have sketched the resource as is typical in industrialized countries where prescription laws are in operation and the burden from infectious disease is mod est17'18. This article aims to produce a more global picture and is deliberately biased towards the problem in deve loping countries where there are often mitigating factors that are overlooked when resistance is examined, more commonly, from other points of view. Nonetheless, the antimicrobial susceptibility resource I attempt to describe is global and worldwide commitment is needed for con servation. A global view of the antimicrobial susceptibility commons Baquero and Campos17 as well as Foster and Grund mann18 have sketched an antimicrobial resistance tragedy along similar lines as put forward by Hardin. The paral lels are striking but it is also important to emphasize fea tures of the antimicrobial susceptibility commons that are distinct from a true Hardin 'commons'. The tragedy is global, but the precise nature of the commons varies from place to place and access is not the same for each poten tial user. In countries where antimicrobials can be obtained only by prescription, access is restricted by prescribers, who are analogous to gatekeepers in Hardin's public park example. Where antimicrobials are not regulated, it is tempting to view the commons as being freely open to all and thus more similar to a real commons, where, in the words of Hardin15 free access 'brings ruin to all'19. In actual fact, access to the commons in those places is restricted in a less rational way. First, not everyone can afford antimicrobials and cost is a major factor to selec tion. Secondly, in some areas, availability of specific antimicrobials may be limited so that the commons can not be exploited by all who would like to do so. These limitations offer an explanation for why, in developing countries, resistance tends to be more prevalent in urban areas than rural locations20'21. Until recently, there were distinct and almost non overlapping bacterial 'Commons' in industrialized coun tries like the USA and developing countries like Nigeria. From the late 1980s, Americans had access to second and third-generation cephalosporins, beta-lactamase inhibitors and quinolones for dealing with bacterial infec tions. In spite of an overall greater per-capita need for antibacterials, economic barriers restricted access to newer drugs for the majority of Nigerians. Thus, at the time, America was one generation of antibacterials ahead of Nigeria so that the effective 'commons' were actually different. By the time an antibacterial drug became uni versally available in Nigeria, it had been discarded or at least relegated to use in non-life threatening infections in America. This pattern of use has promoted accelerated clonal expansion of resistant strains or horizontal dis 1566 CURRENT SCIENCE, VOL. 97, NO. 11, 10 DECEMBER 2009</page><page sequence="4">SOCIETY AND SCIENCE - INTERDISCIPLINARY EXCHANGES Table 1.

More recently, drug development rates have slowed and resistance has continued to escalate world wide, allowing the pools of available antimicrobials to all but unite. Nigerians have been forced by resistance to pay for newer, more expensive drugs and the Western world had come close to the end of the list of new drugs. Cur rently, the quinolones and second- and third-generation beta lactams are antibacterials of choice in Nigeria, the US and the world over. Our emerging data suggest that although the quinolones were introduced much more recently to West Africa than Western Europe and North America, resistance is already highly prevalent in Nige ria24. Once resistance has emerged somewhere, it spreads rapidly without regard for geographic or other bounda ries23. At no time before the present has the need to come to a 'mutually agreed-upon'2" solution to the resistance problem that is effective and global. All bear the brunt of globally disseminated multi-drug resistant pathogens but like climate change, the worst suf ferers from a resistance catastrophe will be the poor4. The originator of the tragedy of the common's paradigm, Hardin became infamous for stating the poor, if allowed into the boat of the rich would sink all"6. Over time, patent laws, poor surveillance and weak health systems have essentially limited weight of the poor in the anti microbial boat, without addressing the fundamental pro blem of resistance. Poor people are more likely to become infected, less likely to access appropriate antimicrobials and even less likely to do so if they have a resistant infec tion42 . However, as the repertoire of available anti microbials becomes smaller, a failure to grant the poor sufficient access to the commons consigns them to re maining infected, and therefore infectious, reservoirs. Thus, unless solutions are all-inclusive, everyone remains at risk. It would be overly nai've to speak of averting the tragedy, since it is already here3'2*'29. Dealing with the tragedy: coercion or cooperation? The World Health Organization (WHO) has compiled a global strategy for resistance containment29, which aims to reduce selective pressure by curtailing irrational anti microbial use, to prevent the spread of resistant organisms, and to encourage the development of new antimicrobials. The WHO report details recommendations that could be implemented at national, prescriber and consumer levels, many of which need to be enacted collectively (Table 1). There is no plan for implementation: countries are expected to prioritize implementation of the numerous interventions according to local needs and abilities but very little of the data on which the strategy is based was derived from developing countries30. Education of all stakeholders is one of the most commonly advocated resistance control strategies. Hardin states that education can 'counteract the natural tendency to do the wrong thing' but because evolution favours denial, it must be frequently refreshed. Educational interventions can pro duce a significant if modest change in risk behaviour associated with resistance31 but must be repeated several times in each generation. Because the background, actions and response of each user cadre is different, tai lored educational programmes are needed for prescribers, other health workers, health policy makers, agriculturists and consumers32. Education will always be an essential component of resistance control but only as means to implement structured interventions29. Hardin15 suggested that all strategies for dealing with a tragedy of the commons are objectionable but that at least one must be selected. Early solutions to the tragedy of the commons have focused on coercive, state-managed solutions or incentive-driven privatization. A role for pri vatization in antimicrobial conservation has yet to be seriously exploited. Presently, innovators have a short period to market each new drug aggressively before pat CURRENT SCIENCE, VOL. 97, NO. 11, 10 DECEMBER 2009 1567</page><page sequence="5">SPECIAL SECTION: ent expiration33'34. Patients only take an antimicrobial drug for a short period, limiting total sales. Development of antimicrobial resistance further reduces the profit poten tial for antimicrobials. Thus the current patent structure provides little incentive to develop much needed anti microbials and no incentive to conserve them. The picture is worsened for antimicrobials for neglected diseases or infections that are most prevalent in developing countries, where a traditional exploitable market may not exist35. Foster and Grundmann have cautiously but coura geously proposed withholding antimicrobials from some patients18. This solution may appear extreme but coercive solutions for tragedies of the commons are not pleasant. Hardin's idea of coercion was not brute force but rather pre-agreed coercive laws or taxes. For example, imposing an individual cost to access to the commons, such as an antimicrobial use levy could serve as a more effective means than outright prohibition18. In countries where antimicrobial use is regulated, National Health Services or Health Insurance could elect to reimburse the cost of diagnosis but not of antimicrobial chemotherapy, provid ing a disincentive for patients to demand unneeded antim icrobials''1. Currently prescription drug legislation provides an inadequate shield for the susceptibility commons, even in countries where these laws are enforced. Further protec tion could potentially be gained by tightening prescriber access to antimicrobials, so that these drugs can only be ordered in very specific situations. This creates a 'Quis custodiet ipsos custodies?' or 'Who shall watch the watchers themselves?'15 quandary on one hand but does limit those who must be coerced to a smaller, well edu cated, if opinionated group, which prefers to police itself. Many hospitals have instituted extra gate-keeping on sec ond- or third-line drugs. LaRosa et a!,37 found that pre scription of restricted antimicrobials at an institution with one such antimicrobial stewardship programme occurred most frequently in the hour after 10 pm, when steward ship gate-keeping became inactive each night. Gatekeeper cheating is not the only barrier to curtailing use because in well-regulated countries, patients frequently go around the law - by pressurizing their prescribers or by seeking drugs from unofficial and unorthodox sources such as pet stores, illegal internet distributors or other countries38^10. Thus even though many studies report success with anti microbial gate-keeping at many levels, this approach - as does any other coercive approach - requires highly effective policing for success. Effective policing must be paid for by owners of the common resource, who are in agreement on the coercive rules to be applied. Outside closed systems like hospitals, these criteria are difficult to meet, even where antimicrobial prescription is regulated. In countries where prescription laws are not enforced coercive containment strategies cannot be implemented. It is also unreasonable to enforce the prescription of antimicrobials by qualified professionals when there is a shortage of such professionals and a high burden of dis ease. Restricted access cannot be fairly implemented or properly enforced unless there are sufficient gate-keepers. There is currently no viable model for curtailing anti microbial access from unregulated providers in developing countries save for the suggestion that such distributors should be proscribed, which in most cases has not occurred. The risk of a concerted rebellion in response to coercive attempts to salvage health-related commons is a real possibility in countries where governance unorgan ized, not trusted, or otherwise far from optimal, and policing weak41. McCay and Acheson42 have observed that coercive strategies are the most commonly advocated for control ling the commons and although rules are yet to be en forced, this is the model favoured for resistance control. A preference for the hard-line coercive approach derives from a desire to propose a single solution to the tragedy and to unify different tragedies by proposing that they represent an identical cast from a single mold. More flexible analyses, which includes observations from case studies of different - typically small-scale - commons, have led others to propose cooperative preservation strate gies16. It remains to be seen whether strategies that work in small-scale common resource problems can be scaled up to global problems, in part because the number and diversity of stakeholders is one of the variables predicting successful management of a shared resource16. There is experimental evidence for kin-cooperation in humans and non-human species43. Furthermore, in spite of the advantages that cheating proffers to the individual, human cooperative behaviour is highly developed and, even in non-kinship groups, humans cooperate better than economic theory predicts44'45. Because of the disconnect between action and consequence, indirect reciprocity would be more relevant to conserving antimicrobial sus ceptibility. Rewards for judicious antimicrobial consum ers and prescribers, as well as those who reward them, could deter free-riders. Similarly, sanctioning non cooperators might serve as a further disincentive for self ish action46. Finally, recent experiments suggest that if some groups are able to observe and appreciate success in resistance control in another group, they may be motiva ted to emulate them47. Recent experiments appear to suggest that group sanc tioning may be more effective than incentives for appro priate use of the commons. This is true even when, as is usually the case, punishment can only be implemented at some cost48. In the absence of governing institutions, commoners can develop and maintain peer punishment systems. Fair punishment, such as that which could be 'mutually agreed upon' appears to increase cooperation at the start and to improve it over the long term49. The threat of sanction is not sufficient; defectors must be punished in order for the situation in the commons to evolve towards majority cooperation. In a sense, the experimen CURRENT SCIENCE, VOL. 97, NO. 11, 10 DECEMBER 2009</page><page sequence="6">SOCIETY AND SCIENCE - INTERDISCIPLINARY EXCHANGES tal evidence demonstrates that 'mutual coercion, mutually agreed upon'25 appears to work. Strategies for resistance control have however rarely considered incentives and have never explicitly included sanctions and it may be challenging to introduce them. The status quo is one in which majority of users and gate-keepers are defectors and therefore costs will be incurred to develop a sanction ing system from scratch, particularly one that will make sanctioning advantageous and therefore be sustain able48'50. Reputation might be one of the most straightforwardly invoked incentive, or sanction, to assist in resolving the tragedy'1. Among health professionals, reputation is key to wealth and personal value and is the basis for many prescriber-targeted interventions"y. Baquero and Cam pos'7 suggest that it would not be difficult to set up a sanctioning system where the irrational prescriber of an timicrobials would suffer from a loss of reputation among patients. Reputation can also be exploited at the institu tional level, for example to encourage hospitals to mount costly infection-control interventions that could reduce the transmission of resistant organisms52. In medically pluralistic cultures, such as in many parts of Africa, repu tation is key to provider success. As with other common-resource problems53'54 there is no simple or unified solution to the resistance problem. However, one-size fits-all solutions are likely to exclude developing countries, which at present are least likely to manage infections according to ideal standards of West ern medicine. It is most likely that effective and appro priate incentives and sanctions will vary among different subgroups as well as in different parts of the world. Inter ventions therefore need to be developed, piloted and im plemented more locally and in particular in developing countries. Presently, many of the recommended strategies for resistance containment have an expectation of verti cal, top-down implementation2''. Over-reliance on west ern-model international and national authorities has been a roadblock in the preservation of other common resources and does seem to be having very little impact on the problem of resistance16'54. In areas where the state is mistrusted, civil society groups may be better suited to carry the torch of antimicrobial conservation and innova tive ideas for management of this and other common resources could emerge from other cultures'4. It is possi ble that more grassroots approaches, though limited in reach, may have significant overall impact, particularly if they are coordinated and learned from. A recognition of necessity Coercive solutions break down if monitoring is incom plete or information is inaccurate"1. For example, a plan to withhold antimicrobials from patients that might not need them requires a rigorous definition of who needs a drug and who does not in order to succeed. This in turn requires rapid, sensitive and specific diagnostics. Tests presently employed for this purpose in most health sys tems are reliable but generate results too slowly. In many parts of the developing world, even those tests are unavailable'6, presenting an ethical predicament for drug withholding. The present situation is that most ill people in Africa, and many other parts of the developing world, never receive a diagnosis confirming an infecting patho gen, irrespective of whether they receive antimicrobials from the official or unofficial sector36'55. Ostronf6 cites communication capacity and transparent monitoring systems as essential for cooperative preserva tion of common resources by mutually agreed-upon rules. The better the information sharing, the easier it is to engage stakeholders16'56. She notes that leaders are per suaded to adopt rules in favour of long-term, relative to short term, gain when 'there are clear indicators of resource degradation, generally perceived to be accurate predictors of future harm, or when leaders are able to convince others that a "crisis" is pending''6. This builds upon Hardin's idea, that a 'recognition of necessity' is essential to start the process of 'mutual coercion, mutu ally agreed upon'25. Even though the problem of resis tance was recognized by Fleming soon after the discovery of penicillin57, and accepted in most clinical circles by the close of the 20th century, a true 'recognition of neces sity', commensurate with the extent of the resistance problem, has not been achieved among all stakeholders and decision makers that could impact the crisis. Recent outbreaks of hospital- and community-acquired MRSA and other multidrug-resistant hospital pathogens, including vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus have served as a warning for many industrialized countries. In deve loping countries with weaker surveillance systems, mor tality from multidrug-resistant enteric pathogens like Vibrio cholerae, and more recently extensively-drug resistant M. tuberculosis should be seen as a similar admonition. However, most of these examples are often viewed as localized catastrophes" and, particularly where very few resistant outbreaks are documented, fail to illu strate that antimicrobial susceptibility is a shared re source belonging to all. Localities that do not have such outbreaks (or are unable to detect them) are more likely to view susceptibility as an open access resource, belong ing to no one16'5*, and less likely to see how their own activities might affect future benefits. Thus, news of multiple outbreaks of resistant infections has so far been largely insufficient to motivate necessary action for change. For example, antimicrobial prophylaxis in V. cholerae epidemics in Africa was clearly associated with the emergence of resistant bacteria in the 1970s59'61 but widespread antimicrobial prophylaxis was used in a cho lera outbreak in Cameroon as recently as 20046\ Therapeutic failure can only provide clues about antimi crobial resistance that are riddled with confounding due CURRENT SCIENCE, VOL. 97, NO. 11, 10 DECEMBER 2009 1569</page><page sequence="7">SPECIAL SECTION: to patient factors and variations in the quality of care or medicines36. The most specific and reliable information on resistance can only come from the dissemination of microbial suceptibility data collected by local laborato ries. In the game theory context, near 'perfect' informa tion: that is information about previous 'play', such as antimicrobial resistance prevalence, could help players make rational use of antimicrobials. 'Complete' informa tion, i.e. information that also disclosed 'strategies' of other 'players' would include antimicrobial use data, something that is currently less effectively collected or studied than is resistance data and which would help sup port sanctioning systems. The capacity and will to collect and disseminate this data is generally below par, varies with location and is least likely to be in place in develop ing countries. Antimicrobial resistance surveillance is not cheap but must be viewed as an essential 'organization' cost required to monitor a common resource1 ''16. When monitoring and sanctioning systems for common resources function solely in that role, a second-order dilemma or tragedy is created because of the absence of incentives to monitor or punish"3. It is, however, possible to collect a large proportion of surveillance data in a manner that also assists individual patient care, so that the expense of isolating, culturing and testing organisms will have multiple, synergistic functions. It also presents less of an ethical dilemma if antibacterials were withheld from patients for whom the absence of bacterial infection, or a diagnosis of non-threatening bacterial infection has been unequivocally confirmed. In addition to supporting rational prescribing of anti microbials, the collection and dissemination of susceptibi lity data beyond the clinic, is the first and necessary step for engaging all users of the commons. In a public goods experiment that measured altruistic behaviour of players to prevent climate change, experimenters found that well informed players made larger and more frequent mone tary contributions than less informed players64. As with climate change, another global scale common-resource problem, most users of antimicrobials cannot see gross deterioration susceptibility unless they are infected with a resistant organism and are told so by their caregivers, the gatekeepers. This has an important consequence: users to not have the necessary information to voluntarily develop or support 'mutually agreed upon' containment strate gies65. Engaging the public in the scientific evidence sup porting an impending tragedy of the commons is not a novel idea as the scientific community is instrumental in informing the public and policymakers about the threat from climate change, another unobtrusively deteriorating commons. Resistance containment strategies have predominantly been piloted in countries where antimicrobial use control may be easier to implement; that is, countries like the USA and Denmark where gate-keepers are already in place and the activities of existing diagnostic laboratories are easily adapted to perform a monitoring function32. One approach would be to continue to focus containment planning and implementation in those areas, to reduce the need for capital investment. However, because of the heavy infectious disease burden in many less affluent countries, ignoring or under-prioritizing containment in those countries could undermine global containment. Fur thermore studies on human altruism suggest that a plan that encourages free-riding is unlikely to be long-lasting. Strong reciprocators, who bear the costs of cooperation and altruistic punishment, enhance cooperation but parti cipants who act 'selfishly' for any reason (including necessity) can break it down44. If developing countries are not engaged in the resolution of the resistance crisis, international cooperation will not be sustained. Potential 'free riders' need to be provided with cooperation incenti ves, which may be more useful than sanctions in promot ing cooperation, in those cases where moral legitimacy prevents mutual agreement of sanctions44,49,66. Support for diagnostic development and surveillance systems is one incentive that would improve antimicrobial utiliza tion in developing countries, as well as overall manage ment of infectious diseases. It would also be the first step in generating comparative data, which is essential for establishing cooperation-enhancing reputation in the commons17. A Branco Weiss Fellow's approach to studying resistance Drug resistance is an evolutionary phenomenon. Micro organisms become resistant because of mutations in their DNA or by acquiring DNA from another sources. Micro biologists, like myself, study resistance genes and the organisms that harbour them in order to understand what they encode, how they function and how they are acquired. However, resistance genes would be of much less significance if they were not selected by antimicrobi als, which are used and misused by humans. As much as a rigorous study of the micro-organism will illuminate our understanding of resistance, containing the problem will require an understanding of, and intervention in the anthropomorphic contributors to selection and spread of resistant organisms. Therefore resistance can only be addressed through an integrative and multidisciplinary approach, for which a Branco Weiss fellowship offers unique support. The resistance problem is much better studied in indus trialized countries than in developing ones. 1 am inte rested in the molecular basis for resistance in West Africa and in identifying risk factors for emergence and spread. We use the intestinal commensal Escherichia coli as an indicator organism to study mechanisms of resistance and spread. E. coli can be collected non-invasively, cultured rapidly on affordable media, easily stored and transported 1570 CURRENT SCIENCE, VOL. 97, NO. 11,10 DECEMBER 2009</page><page sequence="8">SOCIETY AND SCIENCE - INTERDISCIPLINARY EXCHANGES and is amenable to molecular analysis. Using this orga nism, resistance dynamics can be studied irrespective of host health status and because E. coli acquires resistance to some drugs by mutations and others by acquiring extrachromosomal DNA horizontally, we can track and elucidate multiple mechanisms simultaneously. Because resistance is understudied in West Africa, we are uncovering different genetic mechanisms and are beginning to piece together a basis for the rapid spread of resistance. Spread, it appears, may be more important than emergence in many contexts so that interfering with person-to-person transmission of resistant organisms and genes, which could also impact disease dissemination, should be a priority intervention. With respect to risk fac tors for resistance, key among my observations is that rational use of antimicrobials is not only impacted by widespread availability of these drugs without prescrip tion, but also the dearth of diagnostic facilities to deter mine when they are needed. 1.
