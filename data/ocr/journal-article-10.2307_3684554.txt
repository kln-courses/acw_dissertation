<plain_text><page sequence="1">38 Structure and Vision in Le Parti prie dee choses Stephani Shmth For Francis Ponge "point of view' is both figurative and concrete, and myopia becomes a way of putting man back into focus, an antidote to infinity. "'L'infini,T he says, "'est une question d'accommodation. La notion d'infini natt de l'infir- mite de la vue. C'est quand on cesse d'y voir clair. Le besoin, la nostalgie d'infini, c'est le desir d'y voir trouble. Pour- quoi exalter cela? I1 faut au contraire s'en defier. Et non le d4ifier. (1) It is interesting to note the differences between Ponge and Robbe-Grillet, sometimes mistakenly compared, in their atti- tudes towards "point of view." While Robbe-Grillet would reduce vision to a purely physical phenomenon,(2) Ponge recognizes that it is an intellectual and emotional, as well as a physical ex- perience. In Le Parti pris des choses vision, associated with language, leads to new forms of perception. Ponge uses both to reintegrate man into a world of things with which he has lost contact. When Ponge "takes the side of things," he doesn't ex- clude anthropomorphic imagery, but he uses it in reverse, not to appropriate things for man, but to make things visible to man in terms he can understand. The point of departure for the anthro pomorphic image is not in man, but in the qualities of the object which confronts him. Unlike most writers Ponge would not use language to impress man's sentiments on the world; unlike Robbe- Grillet he would not use it to describe a world from which man is excluded. Rather he would use it to make man aware of the func- tioning universe which surrounds him, for "....jamais le monde dans l'esprit de l'homme n'a si peu, si mal fonctionn."'(3) The puns and returns to original meanings which are the distinguishing feature of Ponge's poetry recall to man that his abstractions infused with tragedy have their origin in the sim- ple, innocuous, physical functioning of the world. The abstrac- tions men have used to separate themselves from the world were once only a description of the material actions and reactions which they observed around them. Language, because it has such a close relationship with things, attests that objects "live" and experience" in a way similar to that of man. As words be- come less abstract, less separated from their origins, hence less divorced from concrete reality, they become less frightening They are diminished to the size of a material being, thus to the size of man. If Ponge favors the sea shell over the pyramids, it is because the monuments of sea animals are appropriate to their</page><page sequence="2">39 size, while "Les monuments de l'homme ... n'nvoquent'aucun habi- tant a leur taille ... ces enormes monuments qui ne temoignent que de la disporportion grotesque de son imagination et de son corps...(4) Ponge's anti-romantic stance results in a specific poetic approach. The "Notes pour un coquillage" which figures as one of the pieces of Le Parti pris illustrates how Ponge approaches the objects he wishes to animate. The series of actions which he describes in 'Notes" are reproduced in the structural progres- sion of several other poems. Un coquillage est une petite chose, mais je peux la dimesurer en la replacant oi je la trouve, posse sur l'tendue du sable. Car alors je prendrai une poign'e de sable et j'observerai quelques grains, puis chaque grain, et aucun de ces grains de sable a ce moment ne m'apparattra plus une petite chose, et bient&amp;t le coquillage formel, cette coquille d'huftre ou cette tiare batarde, ou ce '"couteau", m'impressionnera comme un enorme monument, en meme temps colossal et precieux, quelque chose comme le temple d'Angkor, Saint-Maclou, ou les Pyramides, avec une signification beaucoup plus Strange que ces trop incontestables produits d'hommes. The first action in the approach to the object is the 'focusing in,"' the close examination of the object which serves to direct the mind and eye towards the appearance of the object itself. This concentration "enlarges" the object, drawing the mind away from already formed notions of the object's utility or the concern it merits. Its form or activity then appears in de- tail and begins to take on importance for itself. Under the heading "De deux mecanismes personnels"' Ponge explains: '"Le pre- mier consiste A placer l'objet choisi (dire comment dGment choi- si) au centre du monde; c'est-a-dire au centre de mes preoccupa- tions"; a ouvrir une certaine trappe dans mon esprit, a y penser naivement et avec ferveur (amour)."(5) In this process of obser- vation combined with intellectual examination, the object loses its opacity at the same moment as it loses its insignificance. The interaction of the sense of sight and the faculties of con- ception and imagination allow man to enter a world which would remain closed if approached exclusively with either. Si alors il me vient  1'esprit que ce coquillage, Qu'une lame de la mer peut sans doute recouvrir, est babiti par une bate, si j'ajoute une bgte a ce coquillage en l'ima- ginant replace sous quelques centimetres d'eau, je vous laisse a penser de combien s'accroftra, s'intensifiera de nouveau mon impression, et deviendra diff~rente de celle que peut produire le plus remarquable des monuments que j '$voquais tout a l 'heure! The second step in this approach requires that the object be placed in its own environment or context. (6) The thing lives among other things, in its owm world apart from men. This is the antidote to man's obsession with himself as the center of the universe. He must move up close to things, must see them in their own perspective. This is an effort to coordinate the mind and the 'eye in observation, to direct observation as a specifi- cally human, imaginative phenomenon away from man and itself. One might contrast Ponge to Baudelaire, who in Sartre's charac- terization "se regarde voir.'"(7) Ponge on the contrary finds</page><page sequence="3">40 that by fixing his attention on things, he avoids the vertigo of despair. "Que fait un homme qui arrive au bord du precipice, qui a le vertige? Instinctivement il regarde au plus pres... On porte son regard a la marche immediate ou au pilier, d la balustrade, ou a un objet fixe, pour ne pas voir le reste. Cela c'est honngte, cela c'est sincere, c'est vrai. L'homme qui vit ce moment-la, il ne fera pas de philosophie de la chute ou du d~sespoir. (8) As Ponge looks at the thing and at the companion things in its environment, the vision extends itself, its growth depen- dant on the life and movement particular to the world discovered. The impression received distinguishes itself clearly from other impressions only when the object is viewed in relationship to its own world. Only then does the object lose its static quality, begin to move, hence to live, because the relative importance of its activity and life can only become visible through related objects in a reduced perspective. Man's recognition of another world with its own functional relationships and its own signifi- cance, provides a "divertissant' entry into this world and re- leases him from the painful strain of trying to dominate it. 'I1 suffit d'abbaisser notre pr4tention a dominer la nature et d'*lever notre pretention a en faire physiquement partie.. .(9) The vital, functional action of the object, whatever form it may take, is one of the dominant aspects of Ponge's poetry. It is activity that we associate with life and which is the most basic way in which a living thing can assert itself. Ponge's frequent use of reflexive verbs, particularly appropriate because they allow the subject to remain the active agent, create the impression of activity or will in many occurrences which are ordinarily characterized as reactions and are usually dissociated from their sources. No one would assert, of course, that Ponge's poetry is simply descriptive. The other half of the creative process, as he says in "My Creative Method" is "'le compte tenu des mots." "Chaque mot s'impose a moi (et au poeme) dans toute son epais- seur, avec toutes les associations d'idees qu'elle comporte..." (10) The object contemplated has certain qualities, while the notion of the object, composed of words, has another network of qualities and relationships. The problem of creation is to make of one collection of three-dimensional objects, language, a tool adequate to describe another object. The perfect poem achieves ':une convenance, un respect, une ad~quation (voila le plus d- licat) de cette expression (par rapport a elle-mime absolument parfait) a la perfection propre de l'objet (ou d'un objet) envisag$."l(11) Such a statement does not reveal the originality of Ponge unless we add that the poetic resonnance of the word with- in the text is not based on personal or larger tribal symbolism, nor on emotional evocation within the text, but on the French language itself as codified by Littr6. Ponge often complains that language is inadequate to express ideas, but he shows it to be adequate to express itself, as well as to express things, by revealing the complex relationships between words, their ':pais- seur", in even the most simple conception. The examination of the object and that of the words or notions associated with it take place at the same time, both in the poem and in the creative</page><page sequence="4">process. "Dire que ce n'est pas tellement l'objet...que l'id6e de l'objet, y compris le mot qui le d6signe. Il s'agit de l'objet comme notion. l s'agit de 1'objet dans la langue francaise, dans l'esprit francais (vraiment article de dictionnaire francais)."(12) "Le Pain" is a poem of perfect structure and progression which illustrates the approach that Ponge describes in "Notes pour un coquillage'" and in his theoretical writings. This poem is com- posed of four movements, introductions, rising, falling (or rather crumbling) and final joke or conclusion, all combined by carefully planned connectives between paragraphs into a single progression. La surface du pain est merveilleuse d'abord a cause de cette impression quasi panoramique qu'elle donne: comme si l'on avait ' sa disposition sous la main des Alpes, le Taurus ou la Cordill re des Andes. Ainsi done une masse amorphe en train d'gructer fut gliss6e pour nous dans le four stellaire, o'U durcissant elle s'est faConnee en vallees, crgtes, ondulations, crevasses... Et tous ces plans das lors si nettement articulbs, ces dalles minces oi la lumiere avec application couche ses feux, - sans un regard pour la mollesse ignoble sous-jacente. Ce lache et froid sous-sol que l'on nomme la mie a son tissu pareil a celui des 6ponges: feuilles ou fleurs y sont comme des soeurs siamoises soudges par tous les coudes a la fois. Lorsque le pain rassit ces fleurs fanent et se retre- cissent: elles se dicachent alors les unes des autres et la masse en devient friable... Mais brisons-la: car le pain doit tre dans notre bouche moins objet de respect que de consommation. The introduction to bread consists of the focus of atten- tion on the object, as described in "Notes." As one draws near to a loaf of French bread, one observes the small ridges on the crust which call to mind the appearance of mountains viewed from a distance. This comparison arises from the appearance of the object and has not been forced onto the object for dramatic appeal. We have rather all the simplicity and purity of a child's vision, the relation of similar shapes. There is also a similarity between the word "pain" and the initial sound of "panoramique." The expression "croGte terrestre"' shows that this observation is a common heritage in the language, but the original comparison has been lost in the usual, technical use of the expression. Ponge revitalizes the expression through the poem by restoring the original comparison and %hus founding the expression anew in experience. After looking closely at the surface of the loaf and relating it to a panorama of mountain ranges, we pass to the inner world of bread, its formation, which is the activity proper to it. The logical link "ainsi done"' pretends that what follows is to be expected, that is, that a rippled surface such as that of bread or of the earth supposes a formation by heat and that each can be used to explain the other. What follows is a simul- taneous description of both processes from which any exterior, controlling agent has been excluded. All of the verbs pertain to both areas of activity and convey the dynamic reactions which are the 7life" of bread and of cosmic formation. ;en train d'gruc- ter"' evokes at once the bursting forth of gas in baking bread and volcanic eruption, while it also brings to mind an organic action</page><page sequence="5">42 which implies a living being. "durcissant elle s'est faconn~ee endows the subject with a capacity for action and returns the reader's attention to the outer surface. The distant panorama at the beginning of the poem has been enriched with the details which have arisen out of an examination of the process of forma- tion. The surface has become "vall6es, crates, ondulations, crevasses., .dalles. From the crisp, crevassed exterior, the reader is led into the center of the loaf, "la mollesse ignoble sous-jacente. In contrast to the glorious crust ":o la lumiere avec application couche ses feux", the inner part of the loaf, because of its lower position and its opposing material qualities, is presented as an inferior underling. Although no such hierarchical oppo- sition exists in the object itself, this value judgement on the two parts of the loaf is still related to their different mate- rial structures. '"lache" is placed in opposition to the firm crust, and the position of the "mie", beneath the crust, makes it "inferior"', hence "'ignoble." We are now inside the loaf and beneath the surface of the earth where we discover that the "'sous-sol" is an intricate struc- ture of feuilles et fleurs...soudees par tous les coudes a la fois." The word "sous-sol" meaning sub-soil as well as sub- structure, prepares for the comparison of the spongy tissue with- in the loaf to a network of leaves and flowers, and such a net- work would be equally apt to describe a mass of crystals. "'soudges": evokes the process of mineral formation and relates the two processes by its first meaning "joined by intense heat. The image of the "mie" as leaves and flowers is continued to describe the drying and crumbling bread: 1 ces fleurs se fanent et se re- trecissent: elles se detachent alors et la masse en devient friable,..." As with baking bread and the formation of the earth' crust, these two processes also correspond exactly: the drying bread, like a fading bouquet, shrinks and becomes brittle. The word "rassit" is specifically applicable to bread, but it is usu- ally found as an adjective in the espression "pain rassis." As the bread becomes the agent of its own hardening, the expression becomes alive with all of the abstract associations with the word Crasseoir.?" The bread pulls itself together, calms down after its previous heated action. By this curious and concentrated use of language Ponge has led us imperceptibly from the outer appearance of the loaf to the two activities of its life, baking and going stale. The con- text he has employed to bring these two reactions to life has been drawn from a larger natural activity which ressembles so closely that of baking bread that complete interpenetration of the two formations is possible. Both the results of the two processes, the two crusts, and the two formations have been showr to be similar. The process of baking bread has not been enlargec from the outside but has enlarged itself. Each of the two for- mations has contributed to the significance of the other: our awareness of a loaf of bread, its possible interest and signifi- cance, have been increased, while the process of mountain forma- tion has been reduced in unscientific language to a size manage- able for man. The last word of the third paragraph, "friable," prepares the reader without breaking his progression of ideas, for the</page><page sequence="6">43 breaking and eating of the bread: " ais brisons-la.' In punning on "dans notre bouche" Ponge is not punning just for the joke, nor is he refusing to take seriously the enterprise he has just completed. This sudden reversal of position and attitude serves first of all to reinforce by contrast the success of the poetic effort which preceeds it. We have been led into the "life cycle" of bread as a vital, interesting process, and we have momentarily forgotten its utilitarian function, usually the only aspect we are aware of when we think of the object. The last lines, by recalling the utilitarian function of the bread, heighten our experience of the poem by making us aware of what the author has done: he has, by means of words, put bread in our mouths as an object worthy of our respect and interest. The breaking and eating follows naturally as the last aspect of the bread's life, the function for which it has pre- pared itself. Ponge does not wish to exclude man from the ob- ject's world, but to put him in his proper relationship to it. From this relationship Ponge excludes the attitude which opposes veneration for the artistic to scorn for the utilitarian, as well as its reverse. In playing on the tension between the artistic and the functional, he eliminates this tension complete- ly. The artistic object, t"Le Pain," is analogous to the func- tional object, bread, and Ponge will not adopt a romantic stance in favor of either. The poem and the object are clearly circum- scribed, and after they have played themselves out, they are terminated together, without sentimentality and without rever- berations of emotion which would extend them beyond natural dis- appearance. One feels no distaste here before the fact of de- struction, either of the object or of the poem; there is only a feeling of ease with all, including the endings, which is in the nature of things. "Le Pain" and "Le Cageot" have similar structures. Both begin by focusing the reader's attention on the form of the ob- ject, proceed to describe the activity of the object, which is realted to its form or appearance, and conclude by referring to the disappearance of both the poem and the object. A mi-chemin de la cage au cachot la langue francaise a cageot, simple caissette a claire-voie vouee au transport de ces fruits qui de la moindre suffocation font &amp; coup sir une maladie. Agencd de facon qu'au terme de son usage il puisse Stre brisge sans effort, il ne sert pas deux fois. Ainsi dure- t-il moins encore que les denrees fondantes ou nuageuses qu'il enferme. A tous les coins de rues qui aboutissent aux halles, il luit alors de 1'4clat sans vanitb du bois blanc. Tout neuf encore, et l4gerement ahuri d'etre dans une pose maladroite &amp; la voirie jet6 sans retour, cet objet est en somme des plus sympathiques, - sur le sort duquel il convient toutefois de ne s 'a.ppesantir longuement. The introduction to this poem presents simultaneously a linguistic and a physical environment. The word "cageot"' is placed in a progression of sounds between "cage" and "cachot." The sound "-geot" combines the "-ge' of "cage" and the :'-ot' of "cachot."' The main vowel also becomes less broad in passing from the first word to the third. There is a similar progression</page><page sequence="7">44 in the form of the three objects: a "cage0 has the most open structure, a 'cachot", the least open. Between them, linguisti- cally and structurally, is the crate with its broad slats and small spaces between them. The form of the crate is the key to its function, and yet another word with an initial "c," 'caissette d claire-voie" calls attention specifically to the form. "Quant a la forme,"' Ponge remarks, 7"je dois dire ou plut6t repeter que j'y vois plus que la peau des choses; le cerne de leurs limites, dont on ne m'enlevera pas de l'idge qu'il d~finit l'essentiel. (13) All of the dis- tinguishing and limiting qualities of the crate are drawn from its form. The word "'suffocation"' clarifies this relationship between form and function: the crate must be a structure "a claire-voie" because the fruit it protects must have air. The word 2"vou~e" discretely implies a willingness on the part of the crate to perform its function. From an initial observation of the crate's form and dis- tinguishing features, we have become aware of the significance of its form in relationship to its function. We have looked at the crate from its point of view and have seen its importance in its own world. The second reason for such a structure is a short life. With the past participle 'agence" and the passive construction "il puisse etre brisi'" Ponge avoids saying who breaks the crate and excludes any outside agent from the crate's world. The words 'il ne sert pas deux fois,' like the -vouee" above, imply an element of agreement in the part of the crate, an acceptance of its fate. The crate does not last even as long as the fruit it protects and for this reason is made of humble material. Used and cast aside, it is again found "a mi-chemin", this time "A tous les coins de rues qui aboutissent aux halles.e The only activity left to it is to gleam: "il luit alors de l'clat sans vanite du bois blanc." Again the form governs the activity of the object. Although Ponge is clearly anthropomorphizing the object, the personnification (if it can really be called such) begins n the object itself, in the material of which it is made. The feeble gleam of cheap pine continues the conception of the crate as a humble, easily broken object and becomes "il luit... sans vanitY." Thus the reader has the impression that the emotion and the form of the object are simultaneously present one in the other The word ahuzi , which originally meant h~riss$" is precisely the term, including emotion and position, which is applicable to the broken crate with its slats poking up in the air like hair standing on end. pose maladroite' also appropri- ately describes the broken crate which has lost its symmetry and looks ready to topple on one side (mal-adroite). Modest and simple, new yet already in the trash pile, a little astonished and troubled by its clumsiness, the crate has become sympathique both to Ponge and to us. We find it so because it has revealed its own appealing qualities and has ceased to be opaque and foreign. We can best assess the accomplishment of the poem if we return io the title "Le Cageot and recall how limited were the associations the word at first evoked. Our first response, probably no more than "a box to carry groceries, has</page><page sequence="8">45 been enlarged and differentiated because we have entered a world of which the crate was the center. We have also responded to a carefully planned and harmonious structure which has re- lated the form of the object to all of its characteristics, here presented as activities. As at the end of "Le Pain," the final pun presents a sudden change of attitude and by contrast calls the reader's attention to the nature of the poetic effort. It is by dwelling on the fate of the crate that a sympathetic relationship is developed between the reader and the crate, and since the primary characteristic which has been considered is its fragility, it is hardly appropriate to prolong the relationship which has been established. The pun on "s'appesantir" once more refers to the form and limitations of the crate: it cannot for long support either the weight of man or of his consideration. The discovery that an object made for a brief, simple life, has just such a life, should not be extended into tragic or philosophic reflections. In "Escargots," a longer piece than the others we have discussed, Ponge finds a thing so much to his taste that he gives way to the philosophic reflections he has refused in the others. Like the sea shell, the snail represents an ideal among things because it constructs a monument in proportion to its size, makes of the necessity of its house a virtue, and harmonizes its efforts with its needs and limitations. Its art form has no other pretention than to reflect the reality of its material self. The snail's example is too beautiful a lesson to resist, an example man might follow regarding his language and his art: Mais c'est ici que je touche a l'un des points prin- cipaux de leur legon,...cette coquille, partie de leur &amp;tre, est en meme temps oeuvre d'art, monument. Elle, demeure plus longtemps qu'eux. Et voila l'exemple qu'ils nous donnent. Saints, ils font oeuvre d'art de leur vie, -- oeuvre d'art de leur per- fectionnement. Leur secretion meme se produit de telle maniere qu'elle se met en forme. Rien d'exterieur a eux, a leur neces- site, a leur besoin n'est leur oeuvre. Rien de disproportionn6 -- d'autre part -- a leur etre physique. Rien qui ne lui soit necessaire, obligatoire. Ainsi tracent-ils aux hommes leur devoir. Les grandes pens~es viennent du coeur. Perfectionne-toi moralement et tu feras de beaux vers. La morale et la rhetorique se rejoignent dans l'ambition et le d~sir du sage. Mais saints en quoi: en ob~issant prfcis4ment &amp; leur nature. Connais-toi done d'abord toi-meme. Et accepte-toi tel que tu es. En accord avec tes vices. En proportion avec ta mesure. Mais quelle est la notion propre de l'homme: la parole et la morale. L'humanisme. As I have indicated, these poems have a classic structure of introduction, body and conclusion. The introductory state- ments establishethe environment of the object by focusing the reader's attention on the form of the object and placing it among other objects and words which resemble it or are commonly found near it. Man is excluded from the object's world in order to</page><page sequence="9">46 break the circle of utilitarian associations which prevent him from seeing the object for itself, both as a thing and as a word. He is then reintegrated discreetly into the object's world by means of language. The body of the poem relates the form of the object to its function, presented as a form of activity by a series of participles, passive constructions and reflexive verbs which make the object the willing agent of its own destiny. One might refer to this kind of presentation as the life- cycle (14) of the object because the review of the various characteristics or activities of the object is usually followed by a reference to its destruction. The conclusions to the poems, usually consisting of some form of word play and a sudden change of attitude, conclude only in the sense of terminating. Except in the case of "Escargots," there are no summary remarks because the primary goal of these poems is simply recreation. One must not forget, however, that in Ponge's opinion, true recreation for man must suppose the adoption of certain attitudes and the rejection of others. In Le Partie pris des choses an original vision of things is also an original form of recreation based on language. The reader of Ponge is asked to observe that language and objects can be pleasures in themselves, rather than as a means of forcing man's sentiments on the world or of tragically asserting the absurdity of a universe which doesn't take into account his aspirations for eternity. Ponge uses language, both applied to and drawn from things, to suggest that man is not unique in the world, not as different from things as he assumes himself to be. The language he has used to create abstractions and separate himself from the world is only an extension out of all proportion of the simple, material actions and reactions which take place in the ever functioning universe. Ponge's use of language tends in the opposite direction, towards reducing language to the level of an object and taking away from it its mission as a col- lection of abstractions used to enlarge the image of man out of proportion to his reality. As with the fate of the crate, man should not separate himself from the world by dwelling tragically on his limitations. Rather he should behave like the snail, aspiring to be no more than he is and making his art a reflection rather than a disproportionate exaggeration, of himself. "Ii s'agit de ne pritendre qu'a ce qui se trouve objestivement If man can put aside his desire to systematize a world of endless variety and cease to seek absolutes in a world of rela- tives, he will be free to devote his leisure to a vast field of reareational discovery and to enjoy all sorts of chance encounters with the world. Once released from the isolation of the romantic stance, he can rediscover his integration into the world through the discovery of the relationships which connect things to other things and to language. For Ponge poetry is a smiling effort to make a bridge of friendship between people and things. In ideal friendship with another person, one must see the other, not as an extension of himself, not as an "object" to be exploited and dominated, but as an other in his own right, a network of fascinating and difrz'- entiating qualities.This discovery of the other allows man to</page><page sequence="10">47 emerge from his isolation and to find that in the midst of differences, there is something recognizable. Art can become a means of establishing this kind of relationship between people and the world: "D'autant que par son activite ' le dominer il (l'homme) risque de s'aliener le monde, il doit a chaque instant, et voila la fonction de l'artiste, par les oeuvres de sa paresse ae le reconcilier." This is man's true recreation, because the experience of friendship can be repeated innumerable times with- out either losing its interest and appeal or creating any abso- lute form of understanding. This kind of pleasure can only be found when we honestly confront the other in all of his com- plexity with our own particular sensitivity and without shame regarding any of our responses. Writing of simple things is definitely a "parti pris" for Ponge. Like an encounter with a new personality, a pine wood challenges the poet to emerge from the circle of ideas which imprison him and isolate him from the world: "...si Je me donne a un tel sujet, c'est parce qu'il me provoque, me paratt propre a changer mon manege d'esprit, me force a changer d'armes et de manires, me refleurit enfin comme un nouvel amour."(16) ...Chere table, adieu!
