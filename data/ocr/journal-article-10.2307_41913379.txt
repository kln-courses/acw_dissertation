<plain_text><page sequence="1">WORDS FOR LOVE IN SANSKRIT* Minoru Hara (Tokyo) We will discuss several words in Sanskrit which are often rendered into the English word "love", while examining their semantic content. Of these, (1) kãma is mainly characterized by volition and desire, (2) sneha by affection, (3) preman, pñti by fondness, pranaya by familiarity, vãtsalya by tenderness, bhakti by devotion and maitñ by benevo- lence. We know that there remain still many words which are translatable as "love", such as anurãga, rati which are connected with rãga (passion) and those connected with heart ( hrdaya ), the central seat of emotion, such as hãrda, sauhãrdya. The synonyms. Sanskrit The language fact was is famous already for noticed the presence by Al-Beruni, of a great an Arabian number as- of synonyms. The fact was already noticed by Al-Beruni, an Arabian as- tronomer in the eleventh century. He says in the opening page of his record as follows. They (that is, Indians) differ from us in everything which other nations have in com- mon ... If you want to conquer this difficulty (i.e., to learn Sanskrit), you will not find it easy, because the language is of an enormous range, both in words and inflections, something like the Arabic, calling one and the same thing by various names, both orig- inal and derived, and using one and the same word for a variety of subjects, which, in order to be properly understood, must be distinguished from each other by various qualifying epithets. For nobody could distinguish between the various meanings of a word unless he understands the context in which it occurs, and its relation both to the following and the preceding parts of the sentence. The Hindus, like other people, boast of this enormous range of their language, whilst in reality it is a defect (pp. 17-8). 1 Apart from the well-known litanies of sahasra-nãma for deities such as Siva- sahasranãma, a section of the MBh enumerates 1082 names for the sun (MBh 3.3.16-28: nãmnãm asta-satam). Similarly, Hemacandra lists 72 in his Abhidhãna- cintã-mani 95-98, and Mayüra has some 63 names for the sun in his Sürya-sata- ka.3 Prior to this, Yãska enumerates 101 names for water in his Nighantu 1.12 ( udaka-nãmãni ),4 and the same number of names for a lotus is collected from the principal kãvya-s by W Rau.5 Why does there exist such an enormous number of synonyms in Sanskrit? There is a good reason for explaining this. It is due to another characteristic * This is a revised and enlarged version of my paper read at the international symposium held in Roma (Passioni d'Oriente) on 30 May 2003. I would like to express my deepest thanks to Professor R. Torella for inviting me to the symposium and for publishing this in his Journal. 1 Cf.

For example, such compounds as "earth-ruler" and "world-protector" may be used for the sin- gle word "king ( rãjan )." There may be seven or eight basic words for "earth" and ten or fifteen for "protector", "ruler", or "master", and so on. This already gives seventy to one hundred-twenty synonyms. But one can go on - "foe- queller", "white-parasol possessor" and so on -beyond one's ability to count.6 On the other hand, it is also remarkable that in Kãvya, particularly, one sel- dom meets such simple words as stri and nan for "woman", simply because they are banal. Women are there transformed into charmers ( vilãsim ), damsels (yosit ), gazelle-eyed beauties ( mrgãksT) and so on, instead. But here in this paper, we will not deal with this sort of compounded syn- onyms which are increased by permutation. What we are concerned with here are the basic synonyms, so to speak, in Sanskrit and in finding in them some minute differences of nuance.7 In examining the semantic content of these genuine synonyms for love, law and religion in Sanskrit,8 one is able to elucidate what idea the Hindu held of these notions. In doing so, one can find that the notion of love, law and religion followed different pattern in Indian cultural tradition, as distinguished from those in other nations. The discrep- ancy itself in the categorizing of such a basic notion as love between the In- dian language on the one hand and that of Europe on the other may shed fur- ther light on mutual understanding between two different cultures. A semantic study of words for love in Sanskrit is particularly interesting, for, as Ivo Fišer once remarked, the ancient Indians were a unique people in the world,9 who were fully aware of the implications of erotics, the art of love, as cultivated between the highly sophisticated couple, nãgaraka and ganikã. 10 Yet, it is impossible to deal here with all the words for love in Sanskrit. Here we shall take up some basic words, such as kãma , sneha , premati , etc., and elu- cidate their semantic field, though it is sometimes not easy to draw a clear- cut line of demarcation between them.11 Meanwhile, we may notice that some correspond to our filial love, parental love, loyal love, etc., etc. I. KÄMA (LOVE AS VOLITION) (1-1) Though it is enumerated as one of tri-varga ,12 the three ideals of human 6 Cf. Ingalls 1965: 8ff. 7 We have done this sort of study in the past. For example, H. Oldenberg examined the semantic con- tent of several words which mean beauty in Vedic literature and through this analysis he tried to ascer- tain the "Schönheits-geiuhl" of ancient Indians (Oldenberg 1967, 830-866). D. H. H. Ingalls also studied the words for beauty in the Subhãsita-ratna-kosa (Ingalls 1962: 87-107) 8 Ingalls 1962: 87. 9 For the Hindu schematism, cf. Bloomfield 1920: 1. 10 Fišer 1966: 25. 11 1 his is also conhrmed by the tact that the Amara-kosa twice refers to the word kama, hrst equating it to abhilasa and secondly, to sneha. 12 Cf. Schmidt 1901: 81-92.</page><page sequence="3">[3] WORDS FOR LOVE IN SANSKRIT 83 life in classical India, the word kãma does not mean originally "love" as such,13 but "desire or longing" in general.14 (1-1-1) The oldest text in Sanskrit, that is the Rg Veda , is a collection of hymns addressed to various deities and as such we can scarcely expect much for our topic therein, but we have the well-known dialogues between Yama and YamI (x.10) and Purüravas and UrvasI (x.95).15 Besides, as H. Lommel once point- ed out, there are some indications of romantic stories prevalent among the oldest Indo-Aryans.16 Furthermore, the erotic elements are often concealed in ambiguous riddles, paradoxes and metaphors, as I. Fišer has pointed out.17 In RV x. 129.4 kãma is called the first seed of the mind (manoso retah prathamam). This original meaning is preserved in another epithet manasi- ja,18 and survives in classical Sanskrit when it stands as the last member of a Bahuvrihi-compound ( dharma-kãma , aisvarya-kãma, prajã-kãma ,) and in its construction with the nomina actionis in -tu (tyaktu-kãma, kartu-kãma ).19 (1-1-2) The semantic content of the word kãma as "desire" or "intention" is best illustrated in the so-called Kãma-gitã of the Great Epic (MBh 14.13. i2Íf.), which reads as follows, yo mãm pray aiate hantum tapasã samsita-vratah tatas tapasi tasyãtha punah prãdur-bhavãmy aham (16) yo mãm prayatate hantum moksam ãsthãya panditah tasya moksa-rati-sthasya nrtyãmi ca hasãmi ca avadhyah sarva-bhutãnãm aham ekah sanãtanah (MBh 14.13.17) If a man of sharpened vow makes an effort to kill me by means of asceticism, I appear again in his asceticism itself. If a wise man makes an effort to kill me in his pursuit for liberation, I dance and laugh at him in his pursuit of liberation itself I, the unique eternal being, cannot be killed by anybody ( avadhya ).20 Whenever one intends to do anything, there kãma always presents itself. Thus, even if one determines to kill kãma, paradoxically it makes its appear- ance in his determination itself.21 Thus, kãma in the RV does not prove any- thing about the Indian idea of "love".22 13 One may note the compound dharma-kama (the will to dharma ) where kama hardly has an erotic nuance. 14 Cf. Fišer 1966: 89 (The term kama is frequently used in the RV hymns, but it never means "love" in the Vedic literature). 15 Cf. Fišer 1966: 100 and Lommel 1978: 196-197. 16 Cf. RV 5.61 and 7.55 as indicated by Lommel 1978: 189-192. 17 Cf. Fišer 1966: 43. 18 Cf. Konow 1923: 5. 19 Cf. Speijer 1968: 302. 20 Cf.

Fišer 1966: 117 (The term kama still means "desire" in the Upanisads.)</page><page sequence="4">84 MINORU HARA [4] (1-1-3) Vãtsyãyana, the author of the Käma-sütra, seems still to hold the same general view of kãma. He gives a definition of kãma in due course, that is, af- ter he gives definitions of dharma and artha , as follows: srotra-tvak-caksur-jihvã-ghrãnãnãm ãtma-samyuktena manasãdhisthitãnãm svesu svesu visa- yesv ãnukuiyatah pravrttih kãmah ( Käma-sütra 1.2.11 ) Kãma is the agreeable activity of the five sense-organs (ears, skin, eyes, tongue and nose) toward the respective objects of their own, when presided over by the inner- organ in conjunction with one's soul.23 Here kãma is the agreeable ( anukula ) activity ( pravrtti ) in the presence of man- as and ãtman, that is conscious enjoyment, of the five sense-organs. (1-1-4) However, this activity toward agreeable objects never ceases without being satisfied. In the well-known proverb we read: najãtu kãmah kãmãnãm upabhogena sãmyati havisã krs navař tmeva bhüya evãbhivardhate (IS 3241) Longing is never appeased by the enjoyment of longings. Rather it increases more and more, as fire does with butter. (1-1-5) As such, it brings about sufferings such as grief (soka) and fear ( bhaya ) instead. kãmebhyo jãyate sokah kãmebhyo jãyate bhayam kãmebhyo vipramuktãnãm nãsti šokah kuto bhayam (Udãnavarga 2.2: Dhammapada 215J Grief is born of desire and fear is born of desire. There is no grief for those free of desire, how much less fear for them?24 It is recommended for those who want to attain real happiness to liberate themselves from kãma. (1-2) It is as early as AV 111.25 that the word is used in the sense of love between man and woman, where kãma s arrow ( isuh kãmasya 1 and 3) and his spear ( kãma-salya 2) are mentioned for the first time. Here we can also trace the ori- gin of his anthropomorphism in later time as we shall see later. In this sec- tion we shall illustrate the semantic content of kãma as a carnal desire. (1-2-1) In the well-known story of an unchaste woman in the Hitopadesa we read: 23 Schmidt 1901: 87. 24 In the Dhammapada, the word kama is replaced by piya=priya (212), pema=preman (213), rati (214) and tanhã=trsnã (216) respectively.</page><page sequence="5">[5] WORDS FOR LOVE IN SANSKRIT 85 ãhãro dvi-gunah strinãm buddhis tãsãm catur-gum sad-guno vyavasãyas ca kãmas cãsta-gunah smrtah (IS 1082) Women's eating is twice, their intelligence four times, their determination six times and their desire eight times (more than men). The instincts, appetite (ãhãra) and sexual desire ( kãma ), are here enumerated together. (1-2-2) After the general definition of kãma as we have quoted above, Vatsy- ãyana proceeds to give the second definition of the word as follows: sparsa-visesa-visayãt tv asyãbhimãnika-sukhãnuviddhãphalavaty artha-prañtih prãdhãnyãt kãmah (Kãma-sutra 1.2.12) But, more specifically, kãma is the valid ( phalavat ) apprehension of the object due to a favourable touch pervaded by self-conceiting happiness. Here, Jayamaúgalã understands kãma in the sense of sexual desire. (1-2-3) Another definition of kãma is given in Dandin's Dasakumãracarita where a courtesan Kamamañjarl talks to an ascetic Marici. kãmas tu visayãtisakta-cetasoh strï-pumsayor niratisaya-sukha-sparša-visesah parivãras tv asyayãvad iha ramyam ujjvalam ca. phalampunahparamãhlãdanamparaspara-vimarda-jan- ma smaryamãna-madhuram udíritãbhimãnam uttamam sukham aparoksam svasamvedyam eva. tasyaiva krte visista-sthãna-vartinah kastãni tapãmsi, mahãnti dãnãni, dãrumni yud- dhãni, bhímãni samudra-laúghanãdíni ca narãh samãcaranti (. Dasakumãracarita 88.8-89.2) But Love can only be described as the most blissful sensation possible for a man and a woman when their minds are wholly absorbed in the things of the senses. Its atten- dants are all things in this world which are delightful and splendid. For its fruit it has a supreme delight arising from mutual caresses, sweet even in remembrance, inflating one's self-esteem, the highest pleasure perceptible to the senses, only to be properly ap- preciated in itself. For its sake men of the highest rank undertake severe penances, cost- ly gifts, bitter wars, fearsome ocean-voyages, and more besides. (Brough 1951: 127-9) (1-2-4) As a carnal desire, kãma is scorching and consuming. In an allegorical verse we meet the compound kãmãgni. ay am surata-jvãlah kãmãgnih pranayendhanah narãnãm yatra huyante yauvanãni dhanãni ca (IS 548) In this fire of love ( kãma-agni ), flaming in the form of sexual intercourse (sur ata), ever furnished with the fuel of fondness (pranaya), men offer their youth and wealth. As such, it is enumerated among the vices ( adharma ), often together with such violent passions as krodha (anger) and lobha (greed). (1-3) It is later anthropomorphised.</page><page sequence="6">86 MINO RU HARA [6] (1-3-1) In the Buddhist texts, he is called Mara (death)25 and styled as the enemy of liberation ( moksa-dvis ). yam kãma-devam pravadanti loke citrãyudham pus pa-š aram tathaiva kãma-pracãrãdhipatim tam èva moksa-dvisam mãram udãharanti (Buddhacañta 13.2) Him whom in the world they call the God of Love, him of the bright weapon and al- so the flower-arrowed, that same one, as the monarch of the activities and the passions and as the enemy of liberation, they style Mara. (Johnston)26 He has three sons named Vibhrama (caprice), Harsa (gaiety), Darpa (wan- tonness) and the same number of daughters called Arati (discontent), Priti (delight) and Trsnã (thirst).27 (1-3-2) As he is condemned as the enemy of liberation in the Buddhacañta , so he appears in the Saivic myth as the counterpart of tapas (asceticism). In Hindu mythology and classical Sanskrit literature, he has a wife called Rati (sexual pleasure) and a friend Vasanta (spring). Being instigated by Indra, he once tried to seduce the god Siva, the divine prototype of Indian ascetic. But when he failed, the enraged god reduced him to ashes,28 hence his name anaňga (bodyless Cupid), although the word anatiga itself was older than the myth.29 (1-3-3) In the allegorical play Prabodha-candrodaya of Krsnamišra, kãma ap- pears together with krodha and lobha as the ministers of the king Mahã-mo- ha (great delusion), their wives being Rati (pleasure), Himsã (violence) and Trsnã (thirst) respectively. (1-4) In iconographical texts he has the emblem of a shark (makara-ketu, makara-dhvaja) and, mounting on a parrot ( suka-vãha ), he shoots from a sug- ar-cane-bow ( iksu-kodanda ), aiming at the hearts of loving couples, the five flowery arrows called tapam, dâhinï, visvamohinï, visva-mardinï, modini.30 25 Cf. Windisch 1906: 184. 26 For the problem of eros and thanatos, cf. Siegel 1978: 8iff. 27 For the names of Mara's children, cf. Johnston's note in his translation 188. 28 The story is given in the third chapter of the Kumara-sambhava of Kalidasa. 29 As for the word an-anga, see Konow 1923: 6-8, who elucidated a formation with intensive redupli- cation of the root añj-, meaning originally "energetically or repeatedly anointing", as was the case with man-matha from math-. 30 Five arrows are called differently (making flow, drying up, burning, bewildering and maddening) in the Sabdakalpadruma : dravanam sosanam bãnam tãpanam mohanãbhidham unmãdanamca kãmasya bãnãh panca prakïrtitâh Cf.

By this he soon lands fishes of men enticed by the bait of her lip, and cooks them on the fire of affection ( anurãga ).31 Furthermore, kãminí-kãya-kãntãre kuca-parvata-durgame mã samcara manah-pãntha tatrãste smara-taskarah (IS 1660) O traveller of the mind (manas), do not wander around in a thick forest, that is the body of the beloved, in a mountain hard to climb, that is breasts! There haunts the robber called Kama.32 (1-5) Starting from the original meaning of "desire, longing", or "intention" in general, it developed into the special meaning of "carnal desire." As such it brings about bliss to loving couples, but annoys them at the same time. It is recommended for the world-renouncer to free themselves from it. Later, it becomes anthropomorphised as the Indian Cupid. Yet, throughout all these contexts, kãma in classical Sanskrit literature always represents the volitional aspect of "love."33 Then, we should ask what is its emotional aspect? Now, we shall discuss another Sanskrit word sneha. II. SNEHA (LOVE AS EMOTION) As the volitional aspect of love is indicated by kãma, its emotional aspect is by the word sneha. Compared to kãma , which is juxtaposed with such violent pas- sions as krodha (anger) and lobha (greed), sneha is less violent. Quite in contrast to kãma , which is characterized by desiccation (sus-, sosana) as indicated by such compound as kãmãgni, sneha is characterized by its moisture and viscosity.34 The word is traced back in the Indo-European language (*(s-)neigh~), its derivatives being niphos, nix , neige , Schnee, snow, etc. and originally it meant 31 For this word, cf. Ingalls 1965: 178-9. 32 Cf. also, yositam nayana-tiksna-sayakair bhru-lata-sudrdha-capa-nirgataih dhanvinã makara-ketunã hatah kasya no patati hã mano-mrgah (IS 5654) 33 Cf. also Ingalls 1965: 149-150. We can enumerate several words for melting ( syand -, dru-) construed with sneha. For example, y adi punas tvãm ïdrsam aiksvãko rãjãrãmabhadrah pasy et tadãtasya snehena hrdayam abhisyandeta ( Ut - tararãmacarita 5.27 prose) If king Rãmabhadra, the descendent of Iksvãku, were to behold you such as you are, his heart would melt with affection. Cf. also dravati (to melt) in IS 2718 to be quoted below, and Dhammapada 34iab ( saritãni sinehitãni ca somanassãni bhavanti jantuno- saritãni vai snehitãni vai saumanasyãni bhavanti jantunafv Udãnavarga 3.5.)</page><page sequence="8">88 MI NO RU HARA [8] oiliness or viscosity. Yet, the association of moisture ( sneha )35 with sexual de- sire and finally with affection and love has not yet developed in the Rgvedic period,36 but fully blossomed in classical Sanskrit literature. The word-play of double-entendre (oil or oiliness and affection) is in evidence in the kãvyas.37 For example: apwrvah ko ' pi kopãgnih saj-janasya khalasya ca ekasya sãmyati snehãd varábate 'nyasya vãntah (IS 448) The fire of anger of a good man and an evil man is somewhat unique. The former is appeased by oil (= affection), but the latter is increased by water (=tears).38 (2-1) Since the word is imbued with an affectionate tinge,39 it is compounded with words expressive of family members.

(Johnston) In the same way, the word is construed with a word expressive of apprehen- sion ( visatik -). svagrhodyãna-gate 'pi snigdhepãpam visaňkyate snehãt kim u drsta-bahv-apãyepratibhaya-kãntãra-madhyasthe (Nãgãnanda 5.1) Out of affection one suspects an evil (has befallen) to the beloved even when he is in his garden. How much more, when he is in the midst of a dreadful forest where so many misfortunes are experienced?45 (2-3) Its nature and causes are defined as follows: dar sane sparsane vãpi šravane bhãsane ' pi vã yatra dravaty antar-añgam sa sneha iti kathyate (IS 2718) It is called love (sneha) where the heart ( antar-aňga ) becomes melted while seeing, touching, hearing and talking. While enumerating several causes (hetu) for sneha , a passage of the Harsacari- ta also speaks of its spontaneous advent. There it is said that there is no par- ticular reason (nimitta, kãrana ) for its advent. 44 Cf. also, sabati ca ghrtäpürnä sicyamãnãpi vãrinã nãrivoparatãpatyã bãla-snehena dahyate ( Pancarãtra 1.8) The barrow full of butter is ablaze though sprinkled with water, as a woman bereft of her child, though drenched in tears, burns with the love for her babe (Woolner).

But without any cause ( vinã kãranena ) my heart is tenderly affected (moist- ened) ( snihyate ) with a bound-up partiality ( paksapãta ) toward you, even though you are not seen (by me), as if you were a relative near at hand when you are really afar off, just as the moon feels towards the lotus-bed, however distant it may be.

Or rather, that affection should be at all dependent upon any (assignable) cause is contrary (to all experience).47 Furthermore, its spontaneous advent seems to be best illustrated by the self- reflection of Sumantra who engages in single combat with Lava without knowledge of his being a cousin. bhuyasã fivi-dharma esa y ad rasa-mayi kasy a cit kva cit pñtih yatra laukikãnãm upacãras tãrã-maitrakam caksu-rãga iti tam apratisamkhyeyam anibandhanam premãnam ãmanti ahetuh paksa-pãto y as tasya nãsti pratikriyã sa hi snehãtmakas tantur antar-bhutãni sïvyati ( Uttararãmacarita 5.17) Generally, this is the way of living beings (fivi-dharma ) that some one feels relishing fondness (rasamayã pñti) to somebody else, which ordinary people figuratively call "friendship caused by the planets ( tãrã-maitraka )" or "love at first sight (caksur-rãga)" and which the wise define as fondness (preman) indescribable and without any appar- ent cause. A causeless partiality, against which there is no counteraction, a thread composed of affection ( sneha ), knits together (our) hearts. 46 samvasa is called a cause of pema=preman in a Jataka verse. samvãsena have Sakka manussassa migassa vã hadayejãyati pemam tam na sakkãasocitum (J 3.214.6-7=3.390.4-5) In Buddhist texts samnivãsa is also associated with pema.

People call it "friendship caused by the planets" or "eye-love."48 (2-4) Since it is of an emotional nature, sneha is not ever-lasting, but ephemer- al. As it appears without any particular reason (hetu, nimitta, káraná), so it dis- appears spontaneously. As it increases in proportion with repeated meeting, so it decreases if they do not see each other. etasmãn mãm kusalinam abhijnãna-dãnãd viditvã mã kauRnãc cakita-nayane mayy avisvãsirii bhüh snehãn ãhuh kim api virahe dhvamsinas te tva abhogãd iste vastuny upacita-rasãh prema-rãsí-bhavanti (Meghadüta 108) Know, since I have given this token, that I am in good health, and be not mistrustful of me, black-eyed one, from idle report which says that affection is apt to wane in sepa- ration, for if not satisfied, passion for the dear one waxes and becomes a mountain of love (Edgerton).49 (2-5) Since sneha is ephemeral and thus unreliable, one should not be attached to it. Being wet by nature and characterized by viscosity, it is sticky and causes many troubles, hence such compounds as sneha-bandha (bondage of attach- ment),50 sneha-pãsa (snare of attachment),51 and sneha-jãla (net of attach- ment).52 Mental anguish of various sorts originates from the attachment. As such it is condemned as a hindrance to mental tranquility in the discourse of Saunaka. manoso duhkha-mïdam tu sneha ity upalabhyate snehãt sajjate jantur duhkha-yogam upaiti ca (26) sneha-mídãni duhkhãni sneha-jãni bhayãni ca soka-harsau tathãyãsah sarvam snehãt pravartate (27= IS 7244) tasmãt sneham sva-paksebhyo mitrebhyo dhana-samcayãt sva-sañra-samuttham tujnãnena vinivartayet (MBh 3.2.31) 48 For this compound caksuraga, cf.

Sufferings are rooted in attachment and fears also originate from attachment. So are chagrin53 and joy, also effort (to avoid chagrin and seek joy); all these come out of attachment.54 Therefore, one should by means of insight turn back one's body-born attachment, turn away from one's partisans, one's friends and one's accumulation of wealth.55 III. PREMAN AND PRÏTI (FONDNESS OR FRIENDSHIP) Prior to entering into the main discussion, at this point, a mention may be made of the seven stages ( avasthã ) of love, as described in the commentary lit- erature, because there we find a difference ( bheda ) between sneha and premati. (3-1) premati As we have seen above in Meghadüta 108, the Yaksa, being afraid of the fad- ing away of sneha of his beloved during separation ( snehãn ãhuh kim vai vira- he dhvamsinas ), encourages her, saying that preman is enhanced even more in absence. Mallinãtha in his commentary to this verse, after emphasizing the difference between these two (sneha-premnor avasthã-bhedãd bhedah ), quotes a verse from the Rasakara , which reads as follows:56 preksã didrksã ramyesu tac-cintã tv abhilãsakah / rãgas tat-saňga-buddhih syãt snehas tat-pravana-kriyã / tad-viyogãsaham prema ratis tat-sahavartanam / spigãras tat-samam krídã samyogah saptadhã kramãt iti. preksã is the desire to see lovely persons, abhilãsa is the constant thought of them. rãga is the mental attitude to be united with them, sneha is the activity favourably inclined to them. preman is the state of it being unendurable to be separated from them, rati is co-habi- tation. srhgãra is playing with them. Thus, the union ( samyoga ) is sevenfold in a successive order. 53 Cf. rak tas tvam nava-pallavair aham api slaghyaih priyaya gunais tvãm ãyãnti silïmukhâh smara-dhanur-muktãs tathã mãm api kãntã-pããa-talãhatis tava mude taâvan mamãpy ãvayoh sarvam tulyam a-soka kevalam aham dhãtrã sa-sokah krtah (IS 5691). 54 We have also sneha-mala, so 'ham icchãmi marnisi vâsasïva sulagnam sneha-malam idam amalaih sikhari-šikhara-prasravanaih svaccha- srotombubhihpraksãlayitum ãsrama-pade ( Harsacarita 180.9-10). 55 Thus, mental tranquility (santi) is achieved by the destruction or attachment (. sneha-ksaya ), as we have seen above in Saundarananda 16.28, which is equated with klesa-ksaya in the preceding verse (16.27). 56 Cf. also his commentary on Kiratarjuniya 9.71.</page><page sequence="14">94 MIN O RU HARA [14] The seven stages of love-development57 are here listed and explained. For clarity's sake, let us list them in order in the following table. (1) preksã which is replaced occasionally by ãlokana is the desire to see ( didrksã ) something nice and amiable ( ramya ), including human beings.58 (2) abhilãsa is constant thought (cinta) about them. (3) rãga is the mental attitude to be united ( saúga-buddhi ) with them. (4) sneha is the activity favourably inclined ( pravana-kriyã ) to them. (5) premati is the state that one cannot be without them ( viyogãsaha ). (6) rati is the living together ( saha-vartana ) with them. (7) srúgãra is playing with them. From the above, we understand that premati stands between sneha and rati , and is defined as a more intensified stage next to sneha in the development of love. Etymologically, however, it means the feeling of dearness as "one's own." As is elucidated by M. Scheller, the adjective priya in Vedic is construed with the family-members who stand in blood-relation such as one's own wife, daughter, etc., and with the parts of body such as one's own arms, fingers, etc. which are organically inseparable from the body itself as an organic whole.59 (3-2) pñti (fondness) We have also another abstract noun pñti which is etymologically related to preman.60 The word is said to be one of the synonyms of sneha , together with kãma and srúgãra,61 and is translated by R. Schmidt as "Neigung, Freude an dem geliebten Gegenstande." However, the Käma-sütra and other Hindu erot- ic treatises differentiate it into the following four categories, ãbhyãsik i, abhi- mãnikí, sampratyayãtmikã, and visayãtmikã.62 Of these, (1) the first, ãbhyãsik i is love produced in the course of repeated exercise (karmãbhyãsa). One may call on "love in music, dancing, hunting, etc. (silpa- vidhi)" (2) The second, ãbhimãnikí, which is called naisargikï in Anaúgaraúga IV is the instinctive outcome of one's heart (Helzenswallung: Schmidt 1901: 93). It is embodied in embracing, kissing and sexual intercourse. (3) The third, sampratyayãtmikã , which is called samã in Anaúgaraúga , is based upon conviction in one's previous experience. One becomes fond of something simply because it is similar to that which he has experienced before. 57 For the ten stages of srúgara, cf. Schmidt 1901: 124-132. 58 Cf. Schmidt 1901: 93. But he adopted the reading prema instead of preksa, as is given in Mallinatha's commentary to the Kirâtâriunïya 9.71. So also Siegel 1978: 70. 59 Scheller 1959, and Hara 1969: 13-17. 60 Cf. Scheller 1959: 112. 61 Cf. Schmidt 1901: 93-96. 62 Cf. Schmidt loc. cit.</page><page sequence="15">[l5] WORDS FOR LOVE IN SANSKRIT 95 (4) The fourth, visayãtmikã, which is called visaya-jã in Anaúgarañga , is re- lated to external objects. One may find it in one's fondness for such objects to be enjoyed as garlands, sandal-wood, etc. ( mãlã-candana-bhojyãdi ). We notice that pñti is a general term for the "fondness" one cherishes for any- thing delightful and familiar. It is liking in general, fondness for arts such as music and dance, for sports, such as hunting and for delightful objects such as garlands and sandal-wood. It is the second category of pñti , that is abhi- mânikï or naisargikï that originates out of human instinct or imagination ( samkalpa ). But, even here, there is no intensifying order between sneha and pñti , as we have seen above in sneha and preman. Compared to preman , pñti seems to be an abstract concept based upon trust or fidelity ( visvãsa ). Unlike preman which is juxtaposed with such words of emotion and passion as abhilãsa, rãga, sneha, rati and srúgãra , pñti collapses, once visvãsa is lost. The situation is best illustrated in an episode found in the great Epic.63 A jackal, who was a wicked king named Paurika in his previous life, is now leading an austere life in the forest. Seeing his daily behaviour, the lord of beasts in full trust ( visvãsa : MBh 12.112.76, 79) appointed him to be the chief-minister, ensuring his security (samaya: 34, 47, 77. maitñ: 47). 64 But his former servants, who are now isolated by the king, set an intrigue of dis- sensions ( bheda ) against them. The simple-minded king was thus deceived, and ordered the death-punishment for the jackal. Seeing this, the king's mother defended the accused and proved his innocence. The king called up- on the jackal and asked him to stay with him, but the jackal declined to ac- cept the offer, saying: avamãnena yuktasya sthãpitasya ca me punah katham yãsyasi visvãsam aham esyãmi vã punah (76) So how will you ever trust me again? Me whom you humiliated and then reappointed? And how will I ever trust you again? (Fitzgerald)65 He left the court for the forest with the following words, and put an end to his life by religious suicide (prãya). duhkhena slisyate bhinnam šlistam duhkhena bhidyate bhinna-slistã tu yãpntir na sã snehena vartate (MBh 12.112. 8i=IS 2832) Once broken, it is hard to be united. Once united, it is hard to be broken. But fondness (pñti: Böhtlingk "Freundschaft.") once broken, though later united, has nothing to do with affection (sneha). 63 Cf. Falk 1978: ii4Íf. 64 Cf. Falk 1978: 123, n. 3: "Freundschaft." 65 Cf. Falk 138 note 3.</page><page sequence="16">96 M IN O RU HARA [l 6] Friendly relations (prïti) may continue between the two, but both are not bound by affection ( sneha ) any more. Loss of confidence ( visvãsa ) is here fa- tal. We notice that prïti may continue in the form of outward formality, but there sneha is never to be restored. Though deriving from the same verbal root prï-, preman and prïti traced different directions in their semantic devel- opment, the former being more emotional as the intensified stage of sneha , while the latter is imbued with a more abstract and formalistic tinge. IV. PRANAYA In this case of a jackal and a tiger, prïti (friendly relationship) collapses as soon as visvãsa (trust) goes, and once perished it cannot be pasted together and re- stored by sneha (affection). But, if one cannot relinquish sneha even when one loses visvãsa, then what would happen? Such is the case with a loving woman tormented by the inconstancy of her beloved and such a woman in a sulky mood is portrayed by the compound pranaya-kupitã (angry because of pranaya). From the Amara-kosa, one can gather that this word pranaya indicates a complex conception of affection (sneha), trust (visrambha, visvãsa) and demand (yãcnã ). All these indicate that the word denotes the fully-ripened stage of intimacy, by the presence of which the couple in question is able to quarrel with each other ( pranaya-kala - ha) without the fear of final catastrophe of break up or divorce. As a matter of fact, the angry woman demands an apology from his side (yãcnã) and even accuses him of the fault, not with any malicious intention but with affection (sneha) in full trust (visrambha, visvãsa) in the mutual rec- onciliation after all. Her demand results in the man's prostration (prapatana) at her feet, and then the quarrel ends up in their happy reunion. It ensures for the persons in love a safety-zone, so to speak, in which they can speak out to each other without reserve. The word is used not only between a loving couple, but also between fa- ther and son. yathaiva pranayãd vãpi gurur vadati vipriyam tathaiva sa punar müdho lãlayaty avicãrayan (IS 5167) As a father speaks something unpleasant out of affection (to his son), so he also fon- dles him inconsiderately. The same relation is also found between intimate friends of the same sex. It appears in the well-known apology by Arjuna to Krsna in the Bhagavad-gítã. sakheti matvã prasabham y ad uktam he krsna he yãdava he sakheti ajãnatã mahimãnam tavedam mayã pramãdãt pranayena vãpi (11.41) Whatever I said rashly, thinking Thee my boon-companion, calling Thee 'Krsna, Yãda- va, Companion!'</page><page sequence="17">[l 7] WORDS FOR LOVE IN SANSKRIT 97 Not knowing this (truth, namely) Thy greatness, through careless negligence, or even through affection.

But since I have discussed the word on another occasion, we can dispense here with further details.67 v.

(Johnston)73 (6-7) bhajasva mãm The word is imbued occasionally with an erotic tinge.74 A word of the voluptuous Rã vana indicates his libido-like nature. site tyaja tvam vratam ugra-caryam bhajasva mãm bhãmini sarva-gãtraih (Abhiseka-nãtaka 2.14) (Rãvana said) O Sita, abandon this vow (which is) hard to practise and love me with all your body. Rãma also dissuaded the enticing Sürpanakhä as follows: kalatravãn aham bale kaníyãmsam bhajasva me iti rãmo vrsasyantimvrsa-skandhahsasãsa tãm ( Raghuvamsa 12.34) "I have a wife, young girl, do you therefore love my younger brother instead." Thus Rãma, whose shoulders were like those of a bull, commanded that voluptuous woman. A cunning woman seduces a young man with the same expression. sadã tvayy eva me pñtir ihãrudhas tvam èva ca tat sundara tavaivedam dhanam ehi bhajasva mãm (K SS 13.107) I have always loved you and now you have climbed up where I am, so all this wealth is at your disposal. Handsome man, come and embrace me (Tawney). In saying so, the cunning Siddhikañ seduced a merchant's servant ( ity uktvã- liňgya cumbantï sãsya siddhikañ mukham: 108) and killed him. Yet, a serious girl devoted herself to her beloved with the same expression. 72 For the compound svami-bhakta, cf. aksïna-bhaktih ksïne 'pi nande svãmy-artham udvahan prthivyãm svãmi-bhaktãnãm pramãne parame sthitah (Mudrãrãksasa 2.24) Even when Nanda himself was ruined, (solely) holding his master's benefit, he (Rãksasa) remains on the earth as the highest standard of those who are loyal to their master. 73 Buddhacarita 9.81 (nrpates ca bhaktitas) and MBh 3.56.15, 3.90.19, 4.30.23, 15.47.11. 74 Cf. asad-dharmas tv ayant strinam asmakam bhavati prabho pãpíyaso narãn yad vai lajjãm tyaktvã bhajãmahe (MBh 13.38.14).</page><page sequence="21">[2l] WORDS FOR LOVE IN SANSKRIT 101 bhrãtrnãm sammatã hy ete pratyãkhyãtã varã mayã tvayi drste tu me pñtih samjãtã tad bhajasva mãm (K SS 26.154) For I have refused all these suitors approved of by my brothers, but the moment I saw you, love ( pñti ) arose in my soul; therefore marry me.

(Johnston) vu. MAITRÏ Though the word is often translated as "love", it originally is derived from mi- tra which means friend or contract.75 (7-1) Contact in general Being derived from mitra as friend and contract, the semantic content of maitř ï is originally neutral. In some contexts it simply means «connection or association (Bündnis)»,76 as we see in a verse from the Meghadüta. dïrghï-kurvan patu mada-kalam küjitam sãrasãnãm pratyüsesu sphutika-kamalãmoda-maitri-kasãyah yatra stñnam barati surata-glãnim angãnukulah š iprã-vãtah pñyatama iva prãrthanã-cãtukãrah ( Meghadüta 31) There a breeze from Sipra's stream, prolonging the crane's shrill passion-quavering cry, acrid from blending ( maitñ ) with perfume of dawn-opened lotuses, comforts the bod- ies of women, easing the languor of love-play like a lover plying blandishments as he entreats his mistress. (Edgerton) Here Mallinãtha paraphrases maitñ simply as samsarga (contact). (7-2) Natural intimacy The word maitñ indicates spontaneous intimacy, as is seen in the case of the heliotropism of plants and between the sun and the day-lotus. kva sarasi vana-khandam paúkajãnãm kva süryah kva ca kumuda-vanãnãm kaumudï-bandhur induh ára-pancaya-baddhã präyasah saj-janãnãm na hi vicalati maitñ durato 'pi sthitãnãm (IS 1996) 75 Cf.

Mau tanvyo brhanmadhyã vistãrinyah pade pade yãyinyo na nivartante satãm maitryah sant-samãh (IS 940) The friendship (love) among good people is like a river, thin in the beginning, wide in the middle, and expanding step by step. It is ever advancing, but never retreating. As is indicated by natural intimacy, the friendship expressed by maitñ is rather objective and rational than subjective and emotional like sneha. This friendship or love indicated by maitñ is never compatible with betray- al and deceit (sãthya). sampat prajãnutãpena maitñ sathyena kãmirã pãrusyenãhrtã mitra na cira-sthâyinï bhavet (KSS 60. 203= IS 6875) Wealth obtained by oppression of subjects, friendship obtained by deceit (Heuchelei: Böhtlingk), and a lady-love gained by violence, will not remain long. (Tawney) Thus, those who wish to continue friendship (maitñ) should not violate it by betraying their friends. samayo ' yam krtas tena sãcivyam upagacchatã nopaghãtas tvayãgrãhyo rãjan maitñm ihecchatã (MBh 12.112.47) When he was just becoming the king's minister ( sãcivya ), he had made the agreement (samaya) with him. "If you want my friendship, king, you should never take offense."79 (Fitzgerald) Under such circumstances, maitñ , being characterized by objective neutrali- ty, is scarcely used for parental affection or conjugal love80 as is the case with sneha. It also collapses, once pranaya has gone. daurmantryãn nrpatir vinasyati yatih saúgãt suto lãlanãd vipro 'nadhyayanãt kulam kutanayãc chïlam khalopãsanãt 77 Cf. Harsacarita 53.10 as quoted above ( dura-sthe 'pindoriva kumudakare). 78 One may compare it with sneha, which fades by separation as we have seen above in Meghadüta 108.

(Kälte: Böhtlingk) (7-4) In the Buddhist texts, however, we notice that the word is occasionally imbued with a magical connotation, as L. Schmithausen once elucidated.81 The maitn-vihãra and maitn-samãdhi exercise supernatural power. In the sto- ry of Buddha's defeat of Mãra, we read. tad-bodhi-mïde pravikíryamãnam aúgãra-varsam mahad utsasarja maitn-vihãrãd rsisattamasya babhüva raktotpala-pattra-varsah (. Buddhacarita 13.42) But the shower of hot coals, scattered full of sparks at the foot of the bodhi-tree, be- came a shower of red lotus petals through the exercise of universal benevolence (maitn-vihãra) on the part of the best of sages. (Johnston) maitrãvatas tasya muneh sarïre visam na šastram bramati na cãgnih ksiptãni sastrãni vrajanti puspatãm maitñ hi lokottara-bhãvi tasya (Lalitavistara 310.4-5) On the body of the sage endowed with love ( maitrã), neither poison, nor weapon, nor fire approaches. The weapons thrown (at him) turn into flowers. His universal benevolence is indeed extraordinary. Prior to Schmithausen, it was J. Filliozat who pointed out that maitñ is fur- nished with the nuance of «une puissance protectrice», in addition to the sim- ple «charité» or «bonté affectueuse».82 The same efficacy is also attributed to the Pali metta-citta (pensée amicale). Two examples are quoted below. The first is the well-known story of the Buddha's defeat of the mad elephant. atha kho nãlãgiri hattki bhagavato mettena cittena phuttho sondam oropetvã y ena bhagavã ten ' upasamkami, upasamkamitvã bhagavato purato atthãsi (Vinaya-pitaka 2.195.23-25) Then, the elephant Nãlãgiri, being diffused by his benevolent thought, brought down its trunk, approached into his vicinity, and stood up in front of the Lord, The second story is that of Sîhabâhu as related in Mahävamsa 6, the gist of which reads as follows. Sîhabâhu was a son of the princess of the Vañgas and a lion, and was brought up in a cave in a mountain. When he reached the age of sixteen, he realized the secret of his birth and escaped from the cave with- out knowledge of his father together with his mother and sister. They came 81 Cf. Schmithausen 1997. 82 Filliozat 1959: 125.</page><page sequence="24">104 MI NO RU HARA [24] to the capital of the Vañgas. The father in his search for his lost family hap- pened to come to the Vanga country. Being devastated by the lion, the king of the Vañgas called for a volunteer to kill it. Despite his mother's restraint, Síhabãhu volunteered and encountered his father. On meeting him, the lion approached his son affectionately, but the son started to shoot arrows instead. saro nalãtam ãhacca metta-cittena tassa tu kumãra-pãda-mule va nivatto pati bhümiyam (29) The arrow struck the lion s forehead but because of his tenderness (toward his son) it rebounded and fell on earth at the youth's feet. But when the son continued to shoot him, the father finally got angry, losing metta-citta. As soon as he lost it, the arrow killed him. tathãsi yãva-tatiyam tato kujjhi migãdhipo tato khitto saro tassa kãyam nibbijjha nikkhami (Mahãvamsa 6.30) And so it fell out three times, then did the king of beasts grow wrathful and the arrow sent at him struck him and pierced his body. (Geiger) This story shows that the efficacy of metta-citta is valid as long as he holds it, but once he loses it, it has no effect any more. More systematically, however, it is analyzed by Buddhaghosa, together with karunã. mejjatïti mettã, siniyhatïti attho. mitte vã bhavã, mittassa vã esãpavattíti mettã. para-dukkhe sati sãdhunam hadaya-kampanam karotiti karunã. kinãti vã para-dukkham himsati vinãsetxti karunã ( Visuddhimagga 317-318)83 mettã is so called because it becomes fat (mid-), that is to say, because it becomes moist (snih-).84 It is derived from "friend" mitta, or it is called so because (one wishes that) the same (agreeable) thing would happen to a friend. That which makes the heart of the good quiver at the pain of others is karunã. Or it crushes, destroys, kills the pain of others, thus it is karunã. According to other sources, mettã , is a mental attitude of (positively) giving pleasure to others ( hita-sukhüpanaya-kämatä ), while karunã is a mental attitude of (negatively) removing the pains of others (ahita-dukkh-ãpanaya-kãmatã).85 Yet, since the present writer had an occasion to write on this subject in detail, it is better to stop here.86 VIII. In the above, we have discussed several words in Sanskrit which are often ren- dered into the English word "love", while examining their semantic content. Of these, (1) kãma is mainly characterized by volition and desire, (2) sneha by 83 Cf. Maitrimurti 1999: 117. 84 Cf. Maitrimurti 1999: 48 n. 5 and 7. 85 Cf.

We know that there remain still many words which are translatable as "love", such as anurãga, rati which are derived from rãga (passion) and those derived from heart ( hrdaya ), the central seat of emotion, such as hãrda, sauhã- rdya . 87 Here is presented just a modest approach to the problem and we would like to leave a more systematic study for a more competent scholar in future.
