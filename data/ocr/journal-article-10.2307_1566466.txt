<plain_text><page sequence="1">BAUDELAIRE' S SATANIC VERSES JONATHAN CULLER Paul Verlaine was perhaps the first to declare the centrality of Baudelaire to what we may now call modern French studies: Baudelaire's profound originality is to "repr6senter puissament et essentiellement l'homme moderne" [599-600]. Whether Baudelaire em- bodies or portrays modern man, Les Fleurs du mal is seen as exemplary of modern experience, of the possibility of experiencing or dealing with what, taking Paris as the exemplary modern city, we have come to call the modern world. T. S. Eliot wrote, "Baudelaire is indeed the greatest exemplar in modern poetry in any language, for his verse and language is the nearest thing to a complete renovation that we have experienced. But his renovation of an attitude towards life is no less radical and no less important" [426]. And outside the field of literature we find such affirmations as Harold Rosenberg's dating of "the tradition of the New" to Baudelaire, "who exactly one hundred years ago invited fugitives from the too-narrow world of memory to come aboard with him in search of the new" [11]. Baudelaire, writes another critic, "did more than anyone else in the nineteenth century to make the men and women of his century aware of themselves as moderns.... If we had to nominate a first modernist, Baudelaire would surely be the man" [Berman 132-33]. There seems to be considerable agreement on this point, but, surprisingly, there is great difference of opinion about what it is that makes Baudelaire modern and worthy of special attention. Is it, as Albert Thibaudet and Walter Benjamin argue, that he was the first true poet of the city, the first to take the alienated experience of life in the modern city as the norm? Or is it, as Leo Bersani claims, that Baudelaire discovered and displayed the mobility of fantasy and of the desiring imagination? Or is it, as Paul de Man maintains, that Baudelaire invents modem self-consciousness about poetry itself, producing poems that allegorically expose the operations of the lyric? There are many competing accounts of what is most particularly modern and important about Baudelaire, but the one thing on which contentious critics seem to agree is that there is a side of Baudelaire that is of no interest today, that belongs to a bas romantisme and is the very antithesis of Baudelaire's modernity, of Baudelaire the founder of modern poetry: this is the Baudelaire who invokes demons and the Devil. Most critics today pass over this in silence, but even those who explicitly address this Baudelaire seem to find him an embarrassment. Even the author of a book entitled The Demonic Imagination: Style and Theme in French Romantic Poetry begins his chapter on Baudelaire: "Baudelaire has, by now, ceased to interest us for the reasons which once appeared important: his diabolical Catholicism is a familiar, historical mode of sensibility which neither shocks nor has morbid appeal .. ." [Houston 85]. And Fredric Jameson distinguishes the modernist and the postmodernist Baudelaires-both worthy of our attention-from what he calls the "second-rate post-Romantic Baudelaire, the Baudelaire A version of this paper was presented as the 1994 Cassal Lecture at the University of London on October 6, 1994. 1 thank the Professors of French for the honor of this invitation. 86 diacritics 28.3: 86-100</page><page sequence="2">of diabolism and of cheap frisson, the poet of blasphemy and of a creaking and musty religious machinery that was no more interesting in the mid-nineteenth century than it is today" [427]. But Baudelaire called his collection "Les Fleurs du mal" and opens it with a poem that declares, "C'est le Diable qui tient le fils qui nous remuent [it's the Devil who holds the strings that move us]" [OC 1: 5; FE 5]. Can this be dismissed as an irrelevancy- something mistakenly appended to this quintessentially modern poetry? That critics of such different orientations should agree in shunting aside the Satanic Baudelaire suggests that there is something worth investigating here, something disquieting and embarrassing, which may not in fact be merely trivial-which may complicate the story of modernity that has come to depend on Baudelaire as its originator. Perhaps the Satanic Baudelaire would tell us things about modernity we don't want to know. Certainly the idea of the Devil seems fundamentally at odds with accounts of modernity. Even Christianity itself seems to regard the Devil as outmoded mythology, irrelevant to a modem religion. The introduction to an issue of the Catholic review Communio devoted to "Satan, mystery of iniquity" declares, "we have trouble evoking him. Satan seems to us to belong to another age, part of the old terrorizing imagery of religions of fear" [2]. What could be less modern than Satan-a scrawny red man with horns, hooves, tail, and pitchfork? Baudelaire, however, would have laughed at the idea of progress and enlightenment that lies behind all these comments-which present themselves as sophisticated while continuing to rely on notions of intellectual progress he would have regarded as simplistic and deluded. His prose poem "Le joueur genereux" reminds us, "n'oublierjamais, quand vous entendez vanter le progres des lumieres, que la plus belle des ruses du diable est de vous persuader qu'il n'existe pas!" [never forget, when you hear the progress of enlightenment praised, that the Devil's finest trick is to persuade you that he doesn't exist] [OC 1: 327, my translation]. Baudelaire reserves special scorn for George Sand, who had complained in the preface to one of her novels that modern Christians shouldn't be required to believe in the Devil, that a true Christian could not believe in Hell. This just shows, Baudelaire remarks, that the Devil does not scorn "imbeciles" but makes good use of them, to do his work for him. "Elle est possidge," he writes. She is possessed. "It's the Devil who has persuaded her to trust in her 'good heart' and 'good sense,"' in rejecting the idea of the Devil [OC 1: 686-87, my translation]. Satan appears in few poems of Les Fleurs du mal, but Baudelaire gives him a prominent place. Let me mention the most important moments before taking them up in more detail. The opening poem, "Au lecteur," firmly declares, "C'est le Diable qui tient les fils qui nous remuent!" The first poem of the section of Les Fleurs du mal entitled "Fleurs du mal" also features Satan. "La Destruction" begins: Sans cesse a mes cotis s'agite le Dimon; II nage autour de moi comme un air impalpable. [OC 1: 111 ] [The Fiend is at my side without a rest; He swirls around me like a subtle breeze.] [FE 229] And after Les Fleurs du mal had been condemned for offense to public morals, Baudelaire wrote an "Epigraphe pour un livre condamnC" for the second edition of the collection- though in the end he did not include it. This poem claims that readers who haven't studied with Satan, that crafty dean, should throw away this book: Lecteurpaisible et bucolique, Sobre et naif homme de bien, diacritics / fall 1998 87</page><page sequence="3">Restauran lRestaurant Pari s: Pivr4  (H rkt e t'vrolt afd r ~I t-13sh</page><page sequence="4">Jette ce livre saturnien, Orgiaque et milancolique. Si tu n'as fait ta rhitorique Chez Satan, le ruse doyen, Jette! tu n 'y comprendrais rien Ou tu me croirais hystirique. [OC 1: 137] [Reader, you of calm, bucolic, Artless, sober bonhomie, Get rid of this Saturnian book Of orgies and despondency! Just throw it out! unless you've learned Your rhetoric in Satan's school You will not understand a word, You'll think I am hysterical.] [FE 331] But what does it mean for him to invoke the Devil in this way? Let me say straight away that it seems likely that Baudelaire himself did not have an answer to this question- "Se livrer ' Satan, qu'est-ce que c'est? [What is it to give oneself to Satan?]," he asks in his Journaux intimes [OC 1: 663]. He would have been all too happy, one suspects, to sell himself to the Devil, if only he could discover what it entailed, for he spent his life vainly trying to sell himself to editors, publishers, even the Acad6mie franqaise. Indeed, one of the prose poems, "Le Joueur genereux," represents just such a Satanic transaction, and at the end of the poem the sinner prays not for deliverance from the infernal pact but for the Devil to keep the bargain. "Mon Dieu! Seigneur, Mon Dieu! faites que le diable me tienne sa parole! [My Lord! God, my Lord! Make the Devil keep his word to me!]" [OC 1: 328]. But the fact that Baudelaire did not know what it would mean to give oneself to the Devil makes the question all the more important. What is the significance of the Devil in Les Fleurs du mal? Is it an unimportant bit of mythological machinery, or does the figure of the Devil, on the contrary, bring forward crucial problems and issues that we ignore by dismissing him? What threat does this figure pose that we need to set him aside? And if the threat is primarily to the idea of Baudelaire as the first modern or the quintessentially modern poet, why do we have such a stake in modernizing him? Let me emphasize that I am not just asking what it meant to write poems about the Devil in mid-nineteenth-century France-a question that certainly has no simple or single answer (Baudelaire says of his contemporaries, "it's harder for people of this century to believe in the Devil than to love him. Everyone feels him and no one believes in him" [OC 1: 182-83]). I am not just asking a historical question but am asking, rather, what sort of thinking can do justice to the force and distinctiveness of these poems today? "Au lecteur" introduces the Devil. Here are the familiar opening stanzas. La sottise, I'erreur, le piche~, la I~sine, Occupent nos esprits et travaillent nos corps, Et nous alimentons nos aimables remords, Comme les mendiants nourissent leur vermine. Nos pichis sont titus, nos repentirs sont Ilches; Nous nousfaisons payer grassement nos aveux, diacritics / fall 1998 89</page><page sequence="5">Et nous rentrons gaiement dans le chemin bourbeux, Croyant par de vils pleurs laver toutes nos taches. Sur l'oreiller du mal c'est Satan Trismegiste Qui berce longuement notre esprit enchante, Et le triste metal de notre volonti Est tout vaporise par ce savant chimiste. C'est le Diable qui tient lesfils qui nous remuent. [OC 1: 5] [Folly and error, stinginess and sin Possess our spirits and fatigue our flesh. And like a pet we feed our tame remorse As beggars take to nourishing their lice. Our sins are stubborn, our contrition lax; We offer lavishly our vows offaith And turn back gladly to the path offilth, Thinking mean tears will wash away our stains. On evil's pillow lies the alchemist Satan Thrice-Great, who lulls our captive soul, And all the richest metal of our will Is vaporized by his hermetic arts. Truly the Devil pulls on all our strings.] [FE 5] The movement of"Au lecteur" suggests that if, as the opening stanza has it, stupidity, error and sin occupy us and work us over, if we even nourish our remorse and proceed jauntily down the muddy road of sin, it is because our spirit is bewitched, because Satan has vaporized our will. We are his puppets. The opening line of the fourth stanza, "C'est le Diable qui tient les fils qui nous remuent!" comes with the force of an answer or explanation. The Devil pulls the strings; sometimes he makes us act, sometimes prevents us from having the will to act as we would. The next two stanzas stress not this diabolical agency presumed to cause our weakness and wickedness but our resulting complaisance or connivance with vice: it seems that the Devil pulling the strings results in our finding repugnant objects attractive, passing through stinking darkness without horror, and furtively snatching pleasures from which we try to squeeze every drop of enjoyment. C'est le Diable qui tient lesfils qui nous remuent. Aux objects rdpugnants nous trouvons des appas; Chaque jour vers l'Enfer nous descendons d'un pas, Sans horreur, a' travers des tinebres qui puent. Ainsi qu'un dibauchi pauvre qui baise et mange Le sein martyrisd d'une antique catin, Nous volons au passage un plaisir clandestin Que nous pressons bien fort, comme une vieille orange. [Truly the Devil pulls on all our strings! In most repugnant objects we find charms; 90</page><page sequence="6">Each day we're one step further into Hell, Content to move across the stinking pit. As a poor libertine will suck and kiss The sad tormented tit of some old whore, We steal a furtive pleasure as we pass, A shrivelled orange that we squeeze and press.] But the seventh stanza reopens the question of who is responsible. Si le viol, le poison, le poignard, I'incendie, N'ont pas encore brodi de leur plaisants dessins Le canevas banal de nos piteux destins, C'est que notre came, hilas, n 'est pas assez hardie. [If slaughter, or if arson, poison, rape Have not as yet adorned our fine designs, The banal canvas of our woeful fates, It's only that our spirit lacks the nerve.] If the banality or triviality of our lives has not been decorated by rape, murder, arson, etc., it is because our souls are not bold enough. There is a shift of agency in these first two lines, which makes rape and murder the agents that may or may not yet have put their designs on our fate. This shift seems to reinforce the notion that we are hapless creatures carrying out projects conceived elsewhere, but if, as the last line of this stanza sententiously declares, our lack of boldness is to blame, then what are we to think? Perhaps we are not the Devil's puppets after all-only mediocrities too timid for real sin (this is, I believe, the most common interpretation of the poem). Or is the timidity of our souls, rather, an example of what stanza three called Satan's vaporization of our will and thus an instance of his pulling the strings? The last three stanzas shift the scene, in that strange way characteristic of Baudelaire: from an external scene where the speaker figures as a character to an allegorical space bounded by the speaker: it is as though Satan's pulling the strings of a hapless human puppet gave rise to this other space, which the poem calls "la menagerie infAme de nos vices," where the beasts that are also demons clamor, groan, prance, or yawn. Here is the rest of the poem: Mais parmi les chacals, les pantheres, les lices, Les singes, les scorpions, les vautours, les serpents, Les monstres glapissants, hurlants, grognants, rampants, Dans la menagerie inficme de nos vices, II en est un plus laid, plus mdchant, plus immonde! Quoiqu 'il ne pousse ni grands gestes ni grands cris, II ferait volontiers de la terre un ddbris Et dans un bcdillement avalerait le monde; C'est l'Ennui!-l'oeil chargi d'un pleur involontaire, II rave d'dchafauds enfumant son houka. Tu le connais, lecteur, ce monstre dilicat, -Hypocrite lecteur,-mon semblable,-mon frdre! diacritics / fall 1998 91</page><page sequence="7">[But there with all the jackals, panthers, hounds, The monkeys, scorpions, the vultures, snakes, Those howling, yelping, grunting, crawling brutes, The infamous menagerie of vice, One creature only is most foul and false! Though making no grand gestures, nor great cries, He willingly would devastate the earth And in one yawning swallow all the world; He is Ennui-with tear-filled eye he dreams Of scaffolds, as he puffs his water-pipe. Reader, you know this dainty monster too; -Hypocrite reader,--fellowman, -my twin!] Though the Devil pulls the strings he is no longer on the scene when the poem turns to this zoo and to the ugliest, meanest, most disgusting of these monsters, Ennui, who dreams of executions and wouldn't mind swallowing the world in a yawn. Is the presence of this monster in our world the work of the Devil or not? One can't be sure. The allegorical scene of yawning Ennui puffing his hookah like an oriental pasha seems far removed from that of Satan manipulating human puppets. Is it that, with the Devil pulling the strings and vaporizing our will, we are left vulnerable to this finicky monster? Is the very promotion of ennui to a fearsome monster of our inner life an example of the Devil's control? This poem seems, in its development, to pose the problem of the Devil in a way that I would call forceful, were it not for the fact that critics succeed in ignoring it-no doubt because the poem ends not with the Devil but with Ennui, which becomes the focus of attention. But the poem announces, as though it were the explanation of the human predicament described in the first two stanzas, that the Devil holds the strings that move us. It then proceeds to offer further description of human complicity with vice in a scenario which reaches its climax with the worst monster, without telling us whether we know this fussy monster and lodge him in the menagerie of our vices because the Devil controls us or whether, on the contrary, as critics have sometimes suggested, it is the overpowering presence of Ennui that gives the Devil his power to seduce. What happens in the opening poem, I suggest, happens in the collection as a whole: the poems with an important framing function claim that the Devil is ubiquitous, but subsequent poems do not tell us whether the scenes or movements they narrate are examples of the Devil's work. Perhaps this is what is most worrying about the Devil-that we don't know what is his work and what is not. The second framing poem I mentioned, "La Destruction"-the inaugural poem of the section entitled "Fleurs du mal"-begins with another assertion of the Devil's presence: Sans cesse a' mes cot^s s'agite le Damon; Il nage autour de moi comme un air impalpable. Je l'avale et le sens qui brile mon poumon Et l'emplit d'un disir iternel et coupable. [OC 1: 111] [The Fiend is at my side without a rest; He swirls around me like a subtle breeze; I swallow him, and burning fills my breast, And calls me to desire's shameful needs.] [FE 229] 92</page><page sequence="8">Impalpable but omnipresent, the Devil pulls the strings, seducing the speaker in the guise of a woman or proffering disgusting potions or drugs. Parfois il prend, sachant mon grand amour de l'Art, Laforme de la plus siduisante desfemmes, Et, sous de spdcieux pretextes de cafard, Accoutume ma levre a des philtres infames. II me conduit ainsi, loin du regard de Dieu Haletant et brise de fatigue, au milieu Des plaines de l'Ennui, profondes et disertes. [Knowing my love of Art, he may select A woman's form -most perfect, most corrupt - And under sanctimonious pretext Bring to my lips the potion of her lust. Thus does he lead me, far from sight of God, Broken and gasping, out into the broad And wasted plains of Ennui, deep and still.] Here the question left open in "Au lecteur" seems to receive a definite answer. If the speaker is in the plains of Ennui, it is because the Devil leads him there, in this way (ainsi): by always stirring at his side, by filling him with culpable desires, by taking the form of the most seductive of women and by accustoming him to infamous potions. Two peculiar things are worth noting here. First, the scenario hinted at in "Au lecteur" and affirmed in "La Destruction" differs from traditional tales of Satan, where the Devil doesn't lead you into ennui but out of it, by providing special powers, knowledge, or sensual opportunities (in exchange for your soul). In Baudelaire, though, ennui is not the condition of or point of departure for the Devil's work but its result. This is singular and distinctive. Second, the poem ends with an allegorical event considerably more enigmatic than Ennui's dreaming of scaffolds in "Au lecteur." Here the Devil leads the speaker into the plains of Ennui: II me conduit ainsi, loin du regard de Dieu, Haletant et brise defatigue, au milieu Des plaines de l'Ennui, profondes et disertes. Etjette dans mes yeux pleins de confusion Des vetements souilles, des blessures ouvertes, Et l'appareil sanglant de la Destruction! [Then throws before my staring eyes some gowns And bloody garments stained by open wounds, And dripping engines of Destruction's will!] The combination in these closing lines of the sonnet of strangely unresonant abstraction ("l'appareil sanglant de la destruction") and unlocated specificity ("v~tements souillts" and "blessures ouvertes") makes it difficult to grasp what the Devil might be throwing in his face, and this very difficulty seems to raise the possibility that any scenario elsewhere in Baudelaire's poems involving such things as wounds, destruction, blood, or soiled clothes can be seen as the Devil's work. One might imagine that since the Devil conducts diacritics / fall 1998 93</page><page sequence="9">me "ainsi," in the guise of a woman, what the Devil as woman throws in the speaker' s face is menstruation, as sign of the monstrousness of feminine sexuality. But this interpretation may fail to live up to the curious "appareil sanglant de la Destruction," which, unresonant though it may be, nevertheless has a prima facie importance since it provides or echoes the title of the poem. The difficulty of grasping what the Devil is about here, I'm tempted to conclude-here at the point where a poem of Les Fleurs du mal seems most explicitly to tell us what it is that the Devil does-heightens the question of the extent to which the Devil is at work in the adventures and obsessions of the speakers of these poems. But there is one suggestion that needs to be pursued in the strange endings of the two poems cited so far. The puzzling "appareil sanglant de la destruction" recalls Ennui, who "rave d'6chafauds." In one case the Devil leads the speaker into the plains of Ennui and throws what might well be the guillotine before his eyes. In the other the Devil leaves us threatened by Ennui, who dreams of executions and would swallow the whole world in a yawn. Together the poems seem to carry the suggestion that the Devil is behind an ennui linked with revolutionary executions. Associating Satan with the French Revolution was a right-wing commonplace. Baudelaire's maitre a penser, Joseph de Maistre, had written, "The French Revolution has a Satanic character that distinguishes it from everything we have seen and perhaps from everything that we shall see" [55]. Baudelaire was certainly touched as well by the nineteenth-century tradition of revolutionary Satanism, which also identified Satan with those in revolt against authority. As Eugen Weber describes it, If, for the masters of the Restoration, freedom was diabolical, why shouldn't liberals take the devil's side? ... If for its enemies, the French Revolution was the work of Satan, the partisans of the Revolution ought to be grateful to him. If the enemies of the Revolution had God on their side, if the oppressors of the people ... reigned by His grace, the liberal and the Romantic (often one and the same person) might very well wish to follow Satan into his exile and reject a heaven that was too reactionary and too bourgeois (depending on the current regime) to attract them. [ 1 1-12] Baudelaire's "Abel et Cain," from the section of Les Fleurs du mal titled "Revolte," was written during his period of revolutionary enthusiasm in 1848 and concludes with the injunction (or possibly description in the present tense), Race de Cain, au ciel monte, Et sur la terrejette Dieu. [OC 1: 123] [Race of Cain, assault the skies And drag him earthward-bring down God!] [FE 269] But in general it is striking-given Baudelaire's interest in Satan-how little he partici- pates in the reversals of romantic Satanism that make the Devil a hero, praised for his revolt against an oppressive despot. Baudelaire's only poem that places Satan in the title, "Les Litanies de Satan," invokes him in liturgical accents, in the form of supplication and response, and substitutes Satan for Mary in the response or refrain, "O Satan, prends piti6 de ma longue misbre [Satan, take pity on my misery]" [OC 1: 123; FE 269]. This poem addresses Satan as one who, responsible for evil, may have pity for humans and even offer solace to human sufferers, but solace of a kind whose value is, to say the least, ambiguous. Satan, it is said, engenders hope (which may be a further illusion and source of torture); he teaches courage in adversity (a good thing, but which does not overcome adversity); he knows where metals and precious stones are hidden underground (which inspires greed 94</page><page sequence="10">and strife); he gives men gunpowder; he inspires perversions which bring solace (such as the "culte de la plaie et des guenilles [the love of rags, the cult of wounds and pain]"), and so on. This Satanic poem is remarkable, I think, for the modesty of its claims for the figure it addresses structurally as a kind of God: Satan is not a heroic rebel but a figure who offers minor consolations to social outcasts. Though Baudelaire occasionally grants Satan the beauty and grandeur of a fallen archangel-as when he calls Milton's Satan the model of virile beauty [OC 1: 658] or speaks, in "L'irr6m6diable," of "la conscience dans le Mal" as a "flambeau des graces sataniques" and "soulagement et gloire uniques" ("torch of Satanical graces" and a "glory in consolation") he does not seek to reverse values and rehabilitate Satan. Indeed, a passage of romantic Satanism from Balzac's Splendeurs et miseres des courtisanes, a passage sometimes thought to contain the germ of Baudelaire' s title, Les Fleurs du mal, will help to measure Baudelaire's distance from the conceptions of his contemporaries. In Splendeurs et miseres, Lucien de Rubempr6 says to Vautrin (Carlos Herrera): I1 y a la postiriti de Cain et celle d'Abel, comme vous disiez quelquefois. Cain, dans le grand drame de I'Humanite, c'est l'opposition. Vous descendez d'Adam par cette ligne en qui le diable a continue de souffler le feu dont la premiere itincelle avait itijetie sur ve. Parmi les dimons de cettefiliation il s'en trouve, de temps en temps, de terribles, a organisations vastes, qui rdsument toutes les forces humaines, et qui ressemblent ca cesfivreux animaux du disert dont la vie exige les espaces immenses qu'ils y trouvent. Ces gens-li sont dangereux comme des lions le seraient en pleine Normandie: il leurfaut une pcature, ils divorent les hommes vulgaires et broutent les &amp;cus des niais. ... Quand Dieu le veut, ces etres mystirieux sont Moi'se, Atilla, Charlemagne, Mahomet, ou Napoleon; mais, quand ils laissent rouiller aufond de l'ocean d'une generation ces instruments gigantesques, ils ne sont plus que Pugatcheff, Robespierre, Louvel, et l'Abbi Carlos Herrera. Douds d'un immense pouvoir sur les ames tendres, ils les attirent et les broient. ... C'est la plante vinedneuse aux riches couleurs quifascine les enfants dans les bois. C'est la po'sie du mal. [473-74] [There is Cain's posterity and that ofAbel, as you sometimes said. In the great drama ofhumanity, Cain is the opposition. You descendfrom Adam by this line, into whom the devil has continued to breathe the fire whose first spark was given to Eve. Among the demons of this lineage, there have been, from time to time, those who were terrible indeed, whose vast structures encapsulate all human forces and who resemble thosefeverish animals of the desert whose life demands the immense spaces they find there. Such people are as dangerous in society as lions would be in the heart ofNormandy: they needfodder; they devourordinary men and graze on the coin of the unwary.... When God so wills, these mysterious beings are Moses, Atilla, Charlemagne, Mohammed, orNapoleon; but when the allow their gigantic capacities to rust at the bottom of the ocean of a generation, then they become Pugatcheff, Robespierre, Louvel, and Abbe" Carlos Herrera. Endowed with immense power over tender souls, they attract them and crush them .... It's splendid. It's beautiful of its kind. It's the richly colored poisonous plant that fascinates children in the woods. It's the poetry of evil.] [my translation] In romantic Satanism we have Satanic characters-either Satan himself made a character in a substantial narrative (as in Hugo and Vigny) or other characters identified as Satanic surrogates, as in Byron or here in Balzac. Baudelaire, however, does not make Satan a character in a narrative-even in "Les litanies de Satan" he is an addressee with certain diacritics / fall 1998 95</page><page sequence="11">sympathies and achievements but not a figure in a story of reversal. Baudelaire, unlike many of his immediate precursors, does not participate in the rehabilitation of the Devil that structures such major efforts as Vigny's "Eloa," Lamartine' s La chute d'un ange and, eventually, Hugo's Lafin de Satan. The historian Ernest Renan wrote in 1855, two years before the publication of Les Fleurs du mal, "[o]f all the hitherto accursed beings whom the tolerance of our century has relieved of their curse, Satan is doubtless the one who has gained the most from the progress of enlightenment and of universal civilization" [231; my translation]. But Baudelaire was not an agent of the progress of enlightenment. Unrehabilitated, the Devil takes his importance in Les Fleurs du mal from the way Baudelaire puts him into the poems that frame and present the book, such as "Au lecteur," the opening poem of the book, "La Destruction," the opening poem of the title section, and the epigraph projected for the second edition. Another poem where Satan is explicitly mentioned, "L'irr6m6diable," from the end of the section "Spleen et l'id6al," approaches the question of what the Devil controls in another way. (Note, incidentally, the appearance of le diable in the title "L'irr6m6diable.") The first seven stanzas of the poem present a series of images of human oppression and entrapment-a being fallen into "un Styx bourbeux et plomb6," a "malheureux" seeking vainly to flee "un lieu plein de reptiles," and so on-images that, the poem suggests, illustrate Satan's effectiveness: -Emblemes nets, tableau parfait D'une fortune irrimicdiable, Qui donne a penser que le Diable Fait toujours bien tout ce qu'ilfait! [OC 1: 80] [Pure emblems, a perfect tableau Of an irremediable fortune, Which makes us think that the Devil Does well what he chooses to do!] [FE 161] But the phrase "donne a penser" leaves open the possibility that we may be mistaken. These images make one think that the Devil always does his work well, but perhaps the Devil isn't really responsible for these disasters and entrapments after all-perhaps, for example, we are misled by the rhyme into seeing the Devil in any fate deemed irrdmidiable. Since "L'irr6m6diable" immediately proceeds in the next stanza to speak of the Tite-ca-tete sombre et limpide Qu'un coeur devenu son miroir! [It's a face-to-face sombre and clear When a heart gives its own image back!] it is possible that the earlier images show not the Devil's efficacy and ubiquity but rather the heart's power of projection-displaying what is generated when, as in the production of the literary works from which these images or emblems are drawn, consciousness imaginatively reflects on itself. On the other hand, it could be that this somber self- reflection is another example of the Devil's work: he pulls the strings of self-reflexivity too, making hearts become their own mirrors, to disastrous effect. Perhaps no self- scrutiny would occur in an unfallen world or if the Devil hadn't led us into the plains of Ennui. Here, too, the appearance in the poem of the figure of the Devil seems to give rise to this problem: is he responsible? What is most diabolical about the Devil, I am tempted to conclude, is that we can never be sure when he is at work. 96</page><page sequence="12">The foregrounding of Satan in the framing poems, and a few others, such as "L'irremediable," poses the question of whether he is not responsible for what is described in the poems within the volume where he may make no obvious appearance. Are we observing the effects of Satanic control or his stimulation of perverse appetites, or is there some other explanation? For example, in "Les sept vieillards," a poem from "Tableaux parisiens," the speaker encounters a sinister old man with an evil glitter in his eye, who staggers along, Comme s'il "crasait des morts sous ses savates, Hostile a' l'univers plutbt qu'indiffrrent. [OC 1: 88] [As if his old shoes trampled on the dead In hatred, not indifference to life.] [FE 179] This sinister figure seems to multiply himself-seven times: Son pareil le suivait: barbe, oeil, dos, bd~ton, loques, Nul trait ne distinguait, du meme enfer venu, Ce jumeau centenaire, et ces spectres baroques Marchaient du mime pas vers un but inconnu. [His double followed: beard, eye, back, stick, rags, No separate traits, and come from the same hell. This second ancient man, baroque, grotesque, Trod with the same step towards their unknown goal. ] The speaker suspects a plot: A quel complot inftime etais-je donc en butte ... ? Is this a satanic plot? Or could it be mere chance that wickedly humiliates him by making him suspect a plot? A quel complot inftime itais-je donc en butte, Ou quel mdchant hasard ainsi m'humiliait? Carje comptais sept fois, de minute en minute, Ce sinistre viellard qui se multipliait! [To what conspiracy was I exposed? What wicked chance humiliated me? For one by one I counted seven times Multiples of this sinister old man.] This poem, like others, seems to prevent one from making a Satanic plot or Satanic influence an explanation on which one could rely. The Devil, then, is the name of a problem. Sometimes-in Baudelaire's prose notes particularly-we may seem to be confronting a version of the traditional problem of the Devil's disguises. Writing of Les liaisons dangereuses, Baudelaire speaks of "Valmont Satan" and of Mme de Merteuil as "une Eve satanique." Apparently, Satan may take the form of or work through manifest villains, such as they, but these are eighteenth-century Satans, and in the nineteenth century, Baudelaire claims, diacritics / fall 1998 97</page><page sequence="13">l'nergie du mal a baissed.-Et la niaiserie a pris la place de l'esprit....

And sappiness has replaced brilliance .... In fact, Satanism has won out. Satan has made himself the sweet innocent... Evil which knows itselfwas less horrible and nearer cure than evil ignorant ofitself George Sand inferior to Sade.] [OC 2: 68, my translation] In the eighteenth century, he continues, "on se damnait moins betement." But if the Devil can manifest himself as easily in George Sand as in Melmoth or Madame de Merteuil, or Gilles de Rais, then he has become so ubiquitous as to be a different sort of figure-one which represents above all the possibility that anything or anyone, however innocent they may appear, can work for ill. As the supreme master of ruse and deceit, the Devil incarnates the ubiquity of deception, evil--or, to put it in other terms, the speculative possibility of dialectic, in which what looks beneficial at one level may prove at another to be horrible and oppressive. One can never tell where the Devil is at work. "I1 nage autour de moi comme un air impalpable," says "La Destruction," dissolved into the very air we breathe. Sometimes he takes the form of "la plus s6duisante des femmes." So there is always a question, it seems, whether a woman is a Satanic manifestation. "De Satan ou de Dieu, qu'importe?" or "Ange ou Demon, qu'importe?" exclaim Baudelaire's narrators in moments of great desperation (echoing Hugo's apos- trophe to Napoleon: "Tu domines notre age. Ange ou demon, qu' importe? [You dominate our age. Angel or demon, what matter?]") But the fact that this "qu'importe?" comes as the climax of agonized reflection shows that usually Baudelairian speakers care very much whether they are dealing with the Devil, though they can never know for sure. If what is most diabolical about the Devil is the difficulty of deciding whether he is at work in a particular scene or situation, then the figure of the Devil poses the general question of whether there is meaning to the scenarios in which we are caught up or misfortunes that befall us or whether they are simply accidents. Can we escape our sense that there are malignant forces that operate independently of human intentions or that the world often works against us? "Everyone feels the Devil and no one believes in him," wrote Baudelaire in a projected preface to Les Fleurs du mal [OC 1: 182-83]. But if the Devil is the name of a force that works on us against our will-if, as Baudelaire says in "Au lecteur," "le riche metal de notre volont6 / Est tout vaporis6 par ce savant chimiste"-isn't he just a personification of aspects of the Unconscious or the Id, of forces that make us do what our conscious selves might reject? To make Baudelaire modern can't we just cross out Devil and write in Unconscious or, better, Death Drive, or Repetition Compulsion? There is something to be said for this view, though one would have to work out the analogy and the substitution more precisely. Baudelaire, though, had anticipated such a possibility and in his prose poem "Le mauvais vitrier" he speaks of "cette humeur, hysterique selon les m6decins, satanique selon ceux qui pensent un peu mieux que les medecins, qui nous pousse sans r6sistence vers une foule d'actions dangereuses ou inconvenantes" [that condition termed hysterical by doctors and Satanical by those who think rather more clearly than doctors, which pushes us unresisting towards a host of dangerous or unsuitable actions] [OC 1: 286]. The Satanical hypothesis is clearer thinking, one surmises, because it adduces not an individual disorder but impersonal structures and forces. When Gustave Flaubert objected to Baudelaire that he insisted too much on l'Esprit du Mal, Baudelaire replied, 98</page><page sequence="14">de tout temps j'ai iti obsedd par l'impossibiliti de me rendre compte de certaines actions ou pensees soudaines de l'homme sans l'hypothese de l'intervention d'une force michante extirieure ac lui. -Voili un gros aveu dont tout le 19e siecle conjure ne mefera pas rougir [I have always been obsessed by the impossibility of accounting for some of man's sudden actions or thoughts without the hypothesis of the intervention of an evilforce outside him-Here's a scandalous avowalfor which the whole nineteenth century ranged against me won't make me blush] [Correspondance 2: 53, my translation]. Christian theology introduces the Devil to account for the presence of evil in the world. If God is not to be held responsible for evil, there must be another creature whose free choice in deviating from good introduced evil. The Devil, thus, is not a symbol of evil but an agent or personification whose ability to act is essential. Just as God is not a symbol of good but, if he is anything, an agent, a creator, or controller, so the Devil is the name for evil agency-evil as an active force, not evil as the absence of God, as modern theologians are wont to suggest. Les Fleurs du mal makes the Devil an actor, along with other unexpected agents, such as Prostitution, which lights up in the streets, Anguish, which plants its black flag in my skull, Ennui, who puffs on his hookah and dreams of the gallows. To dismiss Satan as just a "personification" of evil, though, and thus a fiction, requires remarkable confidence about what can and what cannot act, about what forces there are at work in the universe. Behind the wish to dismiss him as personification may lie the wishful presumption that only human individuals can act, that they control the world and that there are no other agents; but the world would be a very different place if this were true. Much of its character, its difficulty, its mystery, comes from the effects produced by actions of other sorts of agents, which our grammars may or may not personify: history, classes, capital, freedom, public opinion-forces not graspable at the level of the empirical actions of individuals but which seem to control the world and give events meaningful and often oppressive structures. Baudelaire's poems, in which Anguish, Autumn, Beauty, Ennui, Hope, Hate, and others do their work, pose questions about the constituents and boundaries of persons, about the forces that act in the world, and about whether this level of allegorical action does not in fact best capture the realities of body, spirit, and history. This is, finally, a question about the sort of rhetoric best suited to explore our condition; Baudelaire's practice shows a commitment to hyperbolic scenarios involving diverse and unusual actors. In his essay on Theodore de Banville, Baudelaire speaks of hyperbole and apostrophe as the forms of language not only most agreeable but also most necessary to lyric, and goes on to maintain that S'art moderne a une tendance essentiellementdimoniaque. Et il semble que cette part infernale de l'homme, que I 'homme prend plaisir a s 'expliquer i lui-me^me, augmente journellement, comme si le Diable s'amusait ac la grossir par des procMdis artificiels, ac l'instar des engraisseurs, empaitant patiemment le genre humain dans ses basses-cours pour se preparer une nourriture plus succulente [modern art has an essentially demonic tendency. And it seems to me that this infernal part of man, which man takes pleasure in explicating to himself grows larger daily, as if the Devil were amusing himself by fattening it through artificial means, inspired byforcefeeders, patiently stuffing humankind in his farmyards, to prepare more succulent food for himself].

Baudelaire here gives us, and claims as modern, an allegorical scenario with a highly original account of the forces behind a human activity that is increasingly swollen with evil. Such hyperbolic accounts may be well suited to a time when, as Baudelaire says, everyone feels the Devil but no one believes in him. Exploring and channeling this feeling without demanding belief, such allegories posit forces and meanings that might be at work in the infernal accumulations we characteristically feel but seem unable to control in what we persuade ourselves is the modern world. If one of the tasks of French Studies is to explicate the sense of a modern world and modern experience emanating from Paris, then Baudelaire's satanic verses should lie upon its path, requiring engagement and explanation.
