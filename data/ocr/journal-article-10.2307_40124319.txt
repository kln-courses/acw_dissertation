<plain_text><page sequence="1">Malcolm de Chazal: A Surrealist Independent By J. H. Matthews Publication in 1968 by the Paris house of Jean- Jacques Pauvert of Malcolm de Chazal's Poemes bids us look (some of us for the first time) at the work of a major poet, whose extreme discretion is so convenient an excuse for neglect. It would appear that this is a man who, twenty years after his first poetic texts appeared in France, while he still lives and works in Mauritius, shuns contact with us. Certainly, he has not made contact with very many readers. Apart from Sens-plastique, pref- aced by Jean Paulhan in 1948, and La vie filtree (1949), both issued by Gallimard, all his books have appeared outside France, mostly on his native island where, today, they are hardly easier to find than anywhere else. Hoping to introduce Malcolm de Chazal favorably to a public unlikely to have estimated his importance, the publisher of his new vol- ume could think of no more appropriate meas- ure than to cite Andre Breton, on its back cover. So the book advantageously displays quotations from La cle des champs (Sagittaire, 1953). However, Pauvert's promotion staff neglects to admit to having borrowed from two of Breton's essays. The first is "Signe ascen- dant," a text of capital importance to all interested in understanding the surrealistic approach to poetry, and more especially sur- realist views on the function of imagery in poetry. "Signe ascendant" begins with a sen- tence reproduced in the Pauvert edition of Poemes: "Je n'ai jamais eprouve le plaisir in- tellectuel que sur le plan analogique." But it mentions Malcolm de Chazal only once, after the nineteenth-century French thinker the sur- realists admire most, Charles Fourier. Without comment, Breton transcribes the following lines by Malcolm de Chazal: "Sur le lit du blanc de Teen, l'iris est le sommier du matelas de la pupile, ou un fantome de nous-meme s'etend dans le reve." Breton does not state openly what significance he attaches to these words. Nevertheless, it is not difficult to infer their value in "Signe ascendant," where they are placed at the head of a paragraph of para- mount importance, beginning, "L'analogie poetique a ceci de commun avec l'analogie mystique qu'elle transgresse les lois de la de- duction pour faire apprehender a l'esprit l'in- terdependance de deux objects de pensee situes sur des plans differents, entre lesquels le fonc- tionnement logique de l'esprit n'est apte a jeter aucun pont et s'oppose a priori a ce que toute espece de pont soit jete. L'analogie poetique</page><page sequence="2">DECHAZAL 251 differe foncierement de l'analogie mystique en ce qu'elle ne presuppose nullement, a travers la trame du monde visible, un univers invisible qui tend a se manifester." For the direct allusions to Malcolm de Cha- zal picked up by Pauvert we have to turn from "Signe ascendant" to another text, written by Breton in February 1948, and published sepa- rately that year by Robert Marin, under the title it retains in La cle des champs: La lampe dans Vhorloge. Here we find that Breton has considerably more to tell us about the author of Poemes. It goes without saying that all he writes has as its purpose to underline Malcolm de ChazaPs affinities with surrealism. Breton is anything but a disinterested witness, what- ever he is discussing. So we might be inclined to minimize the importance of his testimony, were it not that, turning again to the poetic texts Malcolm de Chazal has brought out in the last twenty years, we are soon persuaded of one thing. It was not just politeness or grati- tude that made him write in one of his letters to Breton, "En France, mes seuls amis spiri- tuels sont les surrealistes." There is no question about it; a surrealist comes closer than anyone to sympathizing with Malcolm de ChazaPs aims in poetry. Esoteric in nature, Malcolm de ChazaPs poems utilize the analogical principle as surrealist poetry does, to advance our comprehension of the universe, and more particularly of man's place in it. A sentence selected surrealist fashion - at random - from La vie filtree represents his aspirations in these terms: "Mon principe est de chercher a intra-visualiser la vie, en me servant constamment de Phumain comme truchement, comme lunette-etalon d'approche et de perforation" (p. 157). Distinctively per- sonal as is the formulation of the poet's idea, it offers no radical departure from the surrealist aesthetic. While always preserving complete indepen- dence of action, Malcolm de Chazal, who has never signed even one surrealist tract, has acknowledged, openly as well as implicitly, certain points of agreement between his doc- trine and the surrealists'. Noteworthy is the "Message aux surrealistes" dated 18 July 1960, printed in the first number of a magazine edited by Breton, La Breche, Action surrealiste, in October 1961. Providing a summation of its author's poetic principles, it indicated clearly where they parallel surrealist intentions. For here Malcolm de Chazal in his turn has stressed analogy as fundamental to poetic alchemy, emphasizing that man seems to him to be guaranteed a central position in the universe by his creative imagination: "De par son pou- voir d'imagination creatrice, et en tant qu'epi- tome et abrege d'univers, Phomme a un pou- voir d'univers et une analogie se presente des lors entre Vhomme et Dieu, par le pouvoir de nommer qui donne le pouvoir de creer." If any single phrase provides us with a key to the poetic world explored by Malcolm de Chazal, it is the one cited, a phrase paying tribute to one of the tenets of surrealist poetic faith: the power to name poetically endows man with power to create from the old a new universe, adjusted to his needs. It is fair to insist there- fore that the sentence we have just read pre- pares us for an explanation of the sens magique which provided one of Malcolm de ChazaPs volumes of poems with its eloquent title. It is no less pertinent to notice that it was from Sens magique that the poet selected the poem reproduced below, quoting it in his "Message aux surrealistes" as an example of "Palchimie des couleurs": Le vert Passa la main Sur l'epaule du jaune Qui eut un frisson mauve. Where Sens magique, published in Mada- gascar by the Presses de la Societe lilloise d'lm- primerie de Tananarive on 15 December 1957, included 755 such poems, the Pauvert selection gives only 182. What is more, Poemes deprives its readers of the benefit of an enlightening essay on "Le verbe." Dated 20 November 1957, "Le verbe" ended Sens magique with two bold affirmations which, setting off the writer's poetic ambition, bring home to us the purpose he shares with the surrealists: "II ne depend encore ici que de Phomme pour que le sens / du Jardin revienne sur terre. / Tout depend en dernier [sic] de Phomme parce que Phomme est le / signe et le sceau du vivant." Not only is the faith expressed here distinctly reminiscent of that of Breton and his followers, but the language echoes the style which lent authority to Breton's voice, when he first called for attention in the name of surrealism, with his Manifeste du surrealisme: "L'homme pro- pose et dispose. II ne tient qu'a lui de s'appar- tenir tout entier, c'est-a-dire de maintenir a Petat anarchique la bande chaque jour plus redoutable de ses desirs." And how can we fail to be reminded, when reading what Malcolm de Chazal has written, of Breton's Point du jour: "En fin de compte, tout depend de notre pouvoir d'hallucination volontaire"? Despite the limits imposed upon the selec- tion offered, a representative sampling of texts in Poemes substantiates the claim upon which "Le verbe" closes. It shows Malcolm de Chazal</page><page sequence="3">252 BOOKS ABROAD following the surrealist example, in seeking re-entry to the Garden of Eden by way of poetic illumination. Never exceeding in these poems ten short lines, he does not exploit the explosive force of homonym and antonym, as did Marcel Duchamp, or Robert Desnos in Prose Selavy, written between 1922 and 1923. He comes closer to the Francis Picabia of the texts col- lected by Poupard-Lieussou as Dits (Le Ter- rain Vague, 1960), though with none of the destructive inclinations that made Picabia a moralist even while he was asserting "La morale est l'epine dorsale des imbeciles." Spared the didactic purpose of a Picabia, Mal- colm de Chazal aims at expanding the mean- ing of words. His poetic effort is dedicated to the conquest of thought through verbalization, of which Lichtenberg, deeply admired by Bre- ton, we recall, seems to have glimpsed the secret. When he writes, "L'Espace / A / Pour seule cle / Le regard," he affirms confidence in a poetic truth that seems to him incontro- vertible: perception is in the eye of the be- holder. To put it in a way that relates his ambition more closely to the impulse in which Breton's Introduction au Discours sur le pen de realite took its source, our powers of enun- ciation seem to him to compensate for the mediocrity of the universe. The primary target is not reason, even though the poet shows himself as alert as any surrealist to the poetic potential of irrationality: "La logique / Ne s'est / Jamais / Raisonnee," he declares. For Malcolm de Chazal the focal point of attention is our sensitivity to the world, as reflected in our evaluation of it. Hence his poems present what Eluard used to call, when he was a surrealist, Vevidence poetique. His is the poetic evidence of a revo- lutionary relationship between man and the universe about him, justifying Breton's praise, "II y a la une proposition neuve. . . .11 y a la la proclamation d'une verite revolutionnaireT The relationship established throughout Mal- colm de Chazal's writings is mysterious to the extent that it is unfamiliar. Its origins may be traced to this realization: "La Nature / Ignore / Le deja. vu." As always, in these lines from Poemes the poet's gift for compression is comparable to La Rochefoucauld's. He too possesses the art of inducing complicity of thought by deceptively simple assertions, which modify our thinking at the very moment when we most easily per- suade ourselves they merely echo our own thoughts. But Malcolm de Chazal is spared the aridity that denies La Rochefoucauld poetic virtue in his Maxim es, finally making us tire of the moralist's viewpoint. We take away from our reading of Poemes z. sense of wonder which can be traced back to the fundamental bases of nature. Air, water, space - in this poetry all acquire a presence that is no less insistent for being beyond definition, rejecting the platitudes of anthropomorphism. This is a poet who has made a signal discovery: "Le Sorcier / Est / A point / Quand / II s'est / Lui-meme / Ensorcele." More is intimated in these lines than the self-sufficiency of a narcissistic poetic sensibili- ty. Malcolm de Chazal has measured man's limitations vis-a-vis the universe. In doing so, he has been brought to a conclusion which is potentially optimistic, however pessimistic it may seem at first: "La Terre / N'a / Jamais / Connu / Copernic." Far from feeling depress- ing deficiency, Malcolm de Chazal has reached a conclusion which appears to him a promising one: "L'eau / N'est jamais / Nue / Quand on la regarde." Liberated from the fixation of egotism, his poems say, man finds his response to the world enriched and refined by confron- tation with its mysteries. As we read in "Le nu," from La vie filtree, "De meme qu'il y a le nu exterieur, de meme y a-t-il aussi le nu interieur - ce deshabilleur de toutes les formes de vie qui, par devetements successifs, penetre dans l'essence des sens." Now we appreciate better the role reserved for analogy in Malcolm de Chazal's poetic theory. It serves to introduce the process by which the "essence des sens" may be penetrated poetically. Hence a significant pattern can be observed in the order selected for the presen- tation of this poet's "alchimie du verbe," in his "Message aux surrealistes." After exemplifying the alchemy of water, dew, and the sun, in the poem "Quand l'eau / cessa / de pleurer / Je vis rire la rosee / Le soleil se moquait d'eux," Malcolm de Chazal passes to an example of the alchemy of colors, already cited. From here it is but a step to "l'alchimie floralej": "Les petales bleus / presentent / des gencives roses / quand la rosee / se mele aux bluets / parmi les lys." The next stage is to illustrate the al- chemy of colors and waters, leading to the "alchimie de la fleur en elle-meme," and finally, the "alchimie du corps humain en lui-meme." In Sens magique the poems are arranged in roughly the same order. It is not superfluous to note, therefore, that the last poem, involving alchemical change in the human body, stands at the top of an ascending scale of poetic anal- ogy. Anyone familiar with the poems of an- other surrealist independent, Jean Arp, will not be slow to draw his own conclusions, while anyone well acquainted with the finest of surrealism's neglected poets, Benjamin Peret,</page><page sequence="4">DE CHAZAL 253 will have no difficulty in understanding in which direction Malcolm de Chazal is leading us. Those whose knowledge of surrealist poetry remains strictly theoretical will have to do the best they can with the reminder that Andre Breton, born under the sign of Pisces, followed his first surrealist manifesto with Poisson so- luble, and believed that man is soluble in his thought. We have come upon a poetic phenomenon that is not the least interesting of those exem- plified in Poemes. It takes us beyond the level of coincidence and possible influence to the point where we may state with confidence that Malcolm de Chazal has made a notably origi- nal contribution to surrealism in poetry. Look- ing at another of his poems, we see clear evidence that he has brought to surrealism an impressive formulation of one of its highest aspirations: "Le pont / Arrive / A l'autre bout / Realisa / Qu'il ne pouvait / Plus revenir en arriere / II s'etait / Depasse." These verses bring to mind the caption which fascinated the early surrealists during the projection of Murnau's film Nosjeratu, eine Symphonic des Grauens: "Passe le pont, les fan tomes vinrent a sa rencontre." Furthermore, it brings back to us many surrealist allusions to the erection of a bridge between the visible universe, con- cretely manifest before our eyes, and the world of poetic perception, attainable only when poetry itself spans the gulf which reasonable logic declines to attempt to bridge. We have seen, for instance, Breton referring to poetic analogy as alone capable of connecting two objects situated on different planes. Malcolm de Chazal goes further than anyone, though, in firmly linking the poetic experience of crossing the bridge with that depassement, ridding man and man-made phenomena of all nostalgia for the point of departure from which the impetus to depassement has taken both meaning and direction. Much more remains to be said about Mal- colm de Chazal; not all of it, by the way, to be deduced from the collection called Poemes. Some aspects of his work still calling for exam- ination will be seen to strengthen the links existing between his poetry and surrealist po- etic ambition: his conception of volupte, for example. "Le verbe," we should note, speaks of man's "sens de volupte qui pivote les cinq sens et les fait correspondre et les couronne et ultimement les glorifie." Without having had the opportunity to read La vie filtree, pub- lished a year later than his La lampe dans Vhorloge, Breton wrote in the latter, "Je n'he- site pas a me repondre que la cle meme d'une telle oeuvre - cle que Malcolm de Chazal a d'ailleurs bien voulu laisser sur la porte - reside dans la volupte, au sens le moins figure du terme, envisagee comme lieu supreme de resolution du physique et du mental." It is no less important to notice, at the same time, which features of Malcolm de Chazal's work separate him from the surrealists. I am think- ing mainly of his religious faith, and the in- fluence it has upon his poetic ambition. It would seem that this poet does not aspire to divine poetic stature because he seeks to ex- clude God from the world, but because he wishes to understand fully how God is reflected in the universe. Thus, perhaps, we should re- consider what Breton had to say about mystical analogy, when differentiating it from [sur- realist] poetic analogy. It is evident that one would be venturing on unsure ground, in restricting Malcolm de Chazal's use of analogy as Breton would have us do, when declaring that poetic analogy "tend a faire entrevoir et valoir la vraie vie 'absente' et, pas plus qu'elle ne puise dans la reverie metaphysique sa sub- stance, elle ne songe un instant a faire tourner ses conquetes a la gloire d'un quelconque *au- dela.' " Close analysis of his poetry may reveal Mal- colm de Chazal as fundamentally practicing a poetic doctrine at variance with that of the surrealistic. But whatever we discover about him, in time, it is clear already that real study of his poetry is overdue. When the time comes for us to be able to say confidently that we know and understand him, we shall have to pay tribute to the leader of surrealism in France for having warned us as long ago as 1948, "Au-dela de l'abord qu'on peut prendre de cette ceuvre et que sa structure meme rend volontairement abrupt, Malcolm de Chazal en appelle a une penetration complete de sa pensee qui implique une meditation prolongee sur ses theses et exige, par consequent, le re- cul." For those who have made up their minds already that, whether touched by surrealism or not, Malcolm de Chazal has something to offer, the poet has his own answer: Les fesses N'ont Aucune Imagination. c _. . .
