Salloum First Technology Safety Systems Copyright 1 995 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc. ABSTRACT Biomechanical data on the response of the face to localized and distributed loads are analyzed to provide performance goals for a biomechanically realistic face. Previously proposed facial injury assessment techniques and dummy modifications are reviewed with emphasis on their biomechanical realism. A modification to the Hybrid III dummy, called the GM Hybrid III Deformable Face, is described. The modification produces biome- chanically realistic frontal impact response for both local- ized and distributed facial loads and provides for contact force determination using conventional Hybrid III instru- mentation. The modification retains the anthropometric and inertial properties and the forehead impact response of the standard Hybrid III head. INTRODUCTION The interaction of the face with the steering system is receiving increased attention in crash testing as lap/shoulder belt restraint use increases and supplemen- tal inflatable restraints for drivers are introduced. In frontal crashes some belt-restrained drivers may contact the steering wheel with their head. Similarly, in crashes below the threshold for inflatable restraint deployment, some unrestrained drivers may also contact the steering wheel. The impact response of the face of the test dummy used in tests to simulate these conditions is important for accurate assessment of both facial and brain injury risk. The biomechanics of facial impact has been the subject of a number of research studies over the past twenty years, but none of the studies, by themselves, developed enough information to allow the development of a faceform for use in a crash test dummy. Many of the studies focused on isolated facial bone impact tolerance only and do not provide sufficient data to characterize response of the facial structure. The basic information needed for specifying the biome- chanical characteristics of the face include the impact response forces, due to both distributed and localized loading, the resulting deformations, and the tolerable loads for those conditions. This paper reviews the literature available on the biomechanics of facial impact response and previous an- thropometric dummy faceform concepts for facial injury assessment. The general requirements for a biome- chanically realistic faceform, developed from the litera- ture, are given and the development of a simple struc- tural modification to achieve this performance in a pro- duction head for the Hybrid III dummy is described. BACKGROUND BIOMECHANICAL RESPONSE STUDIES - The im- pact biomechanics literature contains a number of stud- ies dealing with various individual aspects of facial im- pact injury. Only recently, however, have studies been performed to define the response of the face in terms of force-deflection or force-time behavior. Concentrated Load Response - The studies of con- centrated load response of the face by Nyquist, et al. (1986) and Allsop, et al. (1988) are the most useful in terms of numbers of subjects and summary response data. Both studies used a rigid cylindrical bar, trans- verse to the face to simulate steering wheel rim loading in a reproducible manner. The Nyquist study used a 25 mm diameter bar, attached to either 2 32 kg or 64 kg guided impactor mass, that impacted the faces of unembalmed cadavers across the nose and cheekbones (zygomas) as indicated in Figure 1 . Eleven subjects were used, and contact velocities ranged from 2.8 to 7.1 m/s. Contact force was determined by measuring the acceleration of the impactor and multiplying the data by the impactor mass. Deflection of the face was determined from high- speed movies. The data were analyzed to provide summary force-deflection curves and force-time histories 3016</page><page sequence="2">'J V / / ' J L I ZYGOMATIC X^X=J¿=^= 'J 'J' V V ) / / ' ' à J ļ[ J L I MAXILLARY ZYGOMATIC 'J' V ) ' à ļ[ J MAXILLARY |' I 1/7 I REGION Figure 1.

All tests produced fractures of the nasal bones and many produced more extensive fractures of the zygomas, the upper jaw bone (maxilla), and the bones behind the face. Our analysis of the impactor force-time histories for those tests in which only the na- sal bones were fractured (7 tests) produced an average peak force of 2.97 kN (range 2.2 to 4.15 kN) with an av- erage rise time of 5.9 ms (range 5 to 8 ms). The rise time was defined for this analysis as the time from a significant increase in the slope of the impactor accel- eration curve to the peak acceleration. The average contact velocity was 3.6 m/s (range 2.8 to 4.8 m/s). Figure 2 shows the force-time response corridor derived from the seven tests. The force-deflection data were quite varied, primarily due to large differences in the initial low-stiffness region of the concave-upward response curves. This region results from the deformation of the soft tissues of the face and the deflection of the nasal bone, factors that can vary greatly between subjects. Above a load of 0.25 kN and a deflection of 1.13 cm, the response stiffens and the subjects exhibited force-deflection behaviors that were more consistent. A straight line approximation of this region above a load of 0.25 kN yields a slope of 2.0 kN/cm for the responses considered by Nyquist to represent the average response. The deflection at the 2.97 kN force level for this slope is approximately 25 mm. The Allsop study simulated a rigid bar by a row of 20 mm diameter semi-circular disks.

The impactor mass was 14.5 kg and was mounted in a drop tower which guided the impactor onto the facial region of cadaver heads sup- ported on individual molded-plaster foundations. Drop heights ranged from 305 to 610 mm (resulting in 2.45 to 3.46 m/s contact velocities) for impacts to the zygomatic and maxillary regions indicated in Figure 1 . Data were obtained with eight subjects for the zygoma region and six subjects for the maxilla region. A string potentiome- ter was used to record the impactor displacement which, because the heads were rigidly supported, was equiva- lent to the deflection of the impacted region of the face. Allsop cross-plotted the total force versus the face deflection for all tests and then presented average re- sponse curves for the zygomatic and the maxillary re- gions. As with the Nyquist data, the zygomatic response above 0.25 kN could be characterized as a straight line with a slope of 1.5 kN/cm. The average deflection at 0.25 kN was 1.2 cm and, at 3 kN the deflection was shown as 3 cm. The maxillary region was characterized by a straight line of 1 .2 kN/cm slope from almost zero load at a deflection of 0.7 cm. The force at a total de- flection of 2.0 cm was 1.5 kN. Allsop did not present force-time histories for the tests, except for one maxilla test. Test data on the Hybrid III face was presented and showed it to be at least three times stiffer than the ca- daver facial response. Combination of the Nyquist and the Allsop zygoma impact data bases in a summary form is shown in Figure 3 for force-deflection response. Figures 2 and 3 define 3017</page><page sequence="3">the general response requirements for a biomechanically realistic facial structure for rigid bar impacts to the zy- gomatic region. The critical portions of both the force- deflection and the force-time responses are the high slope regions. The low initial slopes of the response curves is due to soft tissue deformation at low loads and are not as important in determining the peak force re- sponse of the structure since very little impact energy is absorbed during that phase of the deformation. h&gt; / ¿0/ if h&gt; / A, / &lt;p- ¿0/ A, &lt;p- 5 ķ? /p w 2" cV/ A° Ld 4v / A° ÍP O &lt;3?/ /&lt;¥ ÍP jy A, P v /£ P * £/ v # /£ * - U #/ś V £/ A?

Distributed Load Response -The first study to de- scribe distributed force facial impact response data was conducted by the Association Peugeot-Renault (APR) and reported by Tarriere et al. (1981). The data from the study consisted of four cadaver full-face impacts against a flat rigid surface, two with a rigid form-fitting mask and two without the mask. This information was summarized by Melvin, et al. (1985) and used to estab- lish full-face impact response requirements in the form of impactor peak force as determined from three of the four APR tests. The response was bimodal with a first aver- age load peak of 7.5 kN, a unique characteristic of dis- tributed facial loading. This load peak is related to the initial fracture of the facial skeleton and is indicative of a very stiff structure which yields or collapses. Continuing deformation produces a resumption of loading as the collapsed facial skeleton impinges upon its supporting skull bones, resulting in a second average load peak of 10.5 kN. This peak is also an important feature of the desired response, since one of the goals of a biome- chanically realistic face is to provide realistic head ac- celerations, even when major facial bone fractures may be occurring. Melvin and Shee, (1989) reported on preliminary full- face impact tests using a 15.2 cm flat disc impactor with cadavers at Wayne State University (WSU). The tests indicated that 6.7 m/s was near the threshold for facial fracture under this type of loading. The tests also showed that, for a moving mass impactor of 13 kg, only a single peak in force occurred at that momentum level. The head moved away from the impactor with no further loading, unlike the APR tests where a second larger force peak was produced. The data also indicated that for this test condition a first force peak, lower than the APR data, was more representative of facial response when only the nasal bones were fractured. Preliminary data from five test subjects produced a mean peak force of 6.3 kN (1.9 kN SD) and a mean time at which the force peak occurred of 3.6 ms (0.9 ms SD). A summary response corridor based on the data is shown in Figure 4. Figure 4. Preliminary Force-Time Response Corridor at 6.7 m/s for Full-Face Rigid Impact to Five Cadavers - Nasal Bone Fractures Only. FACIAL INJURY ASSESSMENT FACEFORMS - There have been several impact headforms proposed and developed for facial injury assessment testing. This review of previous work will focus on only those devices that have the potential to be included in the head struc- ture of a complete test dummy. General Motors Research Frangible Headform - McLeod and Gadd (1973) reported on the development of a trauma indicating headform for assessment of local- ized and superficial head injury potential. An anatomi- 3018</page><page sequence="4">cally shaped skull was produced to achieve humanlike fracture tolerances in the zygomatic and frontal regions. The design of the device was based on an actual skull with idealized geometric details. The skull material was a polyester resin reinforced by short glass fibers. Sili- cone rubber formulations were used to simulate skin and the underlying flesh. Limited test results were presented which showed that the fracture forces produced by the headform for concentrated (6.5 cm2) rigid impacts to the zygomatic region were comparable to the cadaver data of Nahum, et al (1968) but the frontal bone forces were too high. No discussion was given as to the force-time response of the headform for either concentrated or blunt loading. The GMR Frangible Headform was a complex test device structure which attempted to achieve human-like biomechanical response through anatomical detail and matching of material properties. The device was never fully developed and was never used routinely in laboratory testing. Association Peuaeot-Renault Faceform - Tarriere, et al (1981) reported on the development of a biomechani- cal facial structure for use on a modified Part 572 dummy head. The modified dummy facial skeleton was simulated by a shaped piece of aluminum honeycomb supported by a flat plate which was welded in place of the facial region of the standard aluminum skull. A sili- cone rubber soft tissue simulation was used to cover the element and provide the original shape of the Part 572 facial exterior. The APR face performance was com- pared to that of a standard Part 572 face and a single test from the full-face cadaver impacts described above. The work demonstrated that the standard dummy facial structure can produce excessively high decelerations in a full-face flat rigid impact. The standard dummy pro- duced a peak head deceleration of 560 G, whereas the cadaver produced an initial peak of 165 G. The APR modification produced a close match to a first peak of the cadaver head acceleration-time history, but not a second, higher, peak. The cadaver test produced seri- ous facial bone fractures, including the frontal bone. The more significant bone fractures may have been as- sociated with the second acceleration peak. The dura- tion, and thus, the area under the cadaver head accel- eration-time curve was much larger than the other two curves. Since the impact velocity was the same in all three tests, there may have been an error in the time scale of the cadaver test curve. In any event, the APR face response does not appear to provide adequate biomechanical response for the entire acceleration-time history. Accordingly, it may be useful in assessing facial injury potential at a threshold impact severity, but not at higher severity impacts. This limits the usefulness of the design in general impact testing where brain injury as- sessment, as well as facial injury assessment, is of con- cern. General Motors Hybrid III Deformable Face - Melvin and Shee (1989) describe the development of a proto- type biomechanical deformable face modification for the Hybrid III dummy. The prototype design was shown to provide realistic impact response for both concentrated bar impacts and distributed loading. The later portions of this paper summarize that development and docu- ment the production version of the design. Collision Safety Engineering Deformable Load Sens- ing Face - Perl, et al. (1989) reported on the develop- ment of a deformable load sensing face for the Hybrid III dummy. Using a 25.4 mm thick, high density rigid ure- thane foam facial element with a density-reducing hole pattern, an approach similar to the GM Hybrid III De- formable Face, the authors were able to produce a real- istic response to the bar loading response determined by Allsop, et al. (1988). The shape of the facial element was produced by milling the surface of the foam to pro- duce a curved surface of varying thickness. No data were given for the response of the face design at higher energy bar loading or for distributed load response. The facial structure also incorporated six load sensing areas to allow frontal, zygomatic (left and right), nasal, maxilla and mandible loads to be independently measured. This instrumentation required 18 channels for load data acquisition and did limit neck forward flexion to 60 degrees without interference. Fracture-Indicating and Load-Sensino Devices - There have been a number of efforts to assess facial in- jury potential in steering systems either through meas- urement of facial loads in standard test dummies or by indicating the occurrence of facial fracture by examining a fracture indicating feature incorporated in the dummy face or impactor surface. The first such device was pre- sented by Brinn (1969) and consisted of a hemi-spheri- cal thin shell faceform made of polyester molding com- pound. The test device produced fracture forces due to concentrated loading that were considered acceptable. Newman and Gallup (1984) developed a frangible po- lymethyl methacrylate insert for a modified Hybrid III face. The insert was designed to fracture under impact severities associated with facial bone fracture in rigid impactor tests. Petty and Fenn (1985) used a crushable aluminum honeycomb material on the face of a rigid im- pact mass. Injury potential was assessed by examining the impacted surface of the honeycomb for signs of permanent deformation. Warner, et al (1986) reported on a piezoelectric load-sensing film matrix applied to the facial region of the Hybrid III skull. Grosch, et al (1987) used pressure-indicating paper film applied to face of a dummy to determine the pressure distribution from an impact. The pressure was integrated over the area to determine the load. The load-sensing devices using standard dummy faces have been shown by the APR study and the Allsop study to lack realistic biomechanical impact force re- sponse. Zuby (1987) performed impact tests to evaluate the frangible facial insert and the aluminum honeycomb device. The honeycomb device was adapted to dummy testing by constructing an equivalent of its impactor 3019</page><page sequence="5">structure which could be mounted to the Hybrid III neck. Tests were conducted with a rigid 25.4 mm diameter bar impact surface shape mounted on a 32 kg guided mass impactor. The test conditions were similar to those used by Nyquist, et al (1986). The results of the tests are summarized in Figure 5 in terms of peak impactor accel- eration as a function of test velocity. Figure 5 includes the comparable data from the Nyquist study. Both faceforms produced unrealistically high Impactor accel- erations and, accordingly, unrealistic contact forces at the higher impact severities. /(rxKl-rcmgiblc / / / / / / Inserí Honeycomb / Inserí y / ' / / ' ' TRC Tests J ( Zuby) Honeycomb / / / c vy / X / &lt; / X cu / / O / / 0 / rr - "° WSU Cadavers 0 &lt; 10- / s*2 rr jy Extensive r . . n / / / ^ ~i Extensive r . . 1 n vf / / / 3one ^ ~i FX F°"al F* y A Nasal &lt;£ Bone FX Lü CL 0 -ļ 1 1 ' 1 1 0 2 4 6 8 10 IMPACTOR VELOCITY (m/s) Figure 5.

DEVELOPMENT OF THE GM DEFORMABLE FACE APPROACH - The development of a biomechanical face for the Hybrid III dummy was part of a larger pro- gram at General Motors to develop improved head injury assessment techniques. The focus of the facial biome- chanics part of the program was to obtain a basic under- standing of facial injury mechanisms and impact re- sponse and to develop techniques for applying that knowledge to the assessment of facial injury potential and the generation of more realistic inputs to the head in crash testing. Application of biomechanical injury criteria in the laboratory requires a test device with realistic biomechanical response and a measurement method compatible with standard dummy test laboratory instru- mentation. The specific goals of the facial injury assessment technique aspect of the program involved the following: 1. Develop a simple modification of the Hybrid III head to produce realistic force response during localized and distributed facial loading throughout the relevant range of impact severities. 2. Provide a technique capable of determining con- tact force magnitude, direction and location that is com- patible with present testing procedures. 3. Combine the above into a comprehensive data analysis package for routine test laboratory use. Additional biomechanical requirements included re- taining the overall anthropometric and inertial properties and the forehead impact response of the standard Hy- brid III head. Minimization of extra data channel re- quirements in the force measurement method was also emphasized. The force measurement technique and analysis package are summarized below and described in detail in a previous paper (Melvin and Shee, 1989). DEVELOPMENT OF A CONTACT FORCE MEAS- UREMENT METHOD - The achievement of a biome- chanical face for the Hybrid III head, while allowing real- istic head accelerations to be produced, does not allow the assessment of facial injury potential unless contact forces on the face can be determined. Adding facial load cells to the head instrumentation (Warner, et al. 1986, Perl, et al. 1989) is one direct way to provide a measurement capability. Such a method may not be desirable because of the extra complication and in- creased channel capacity necessary to accommodate them. In addition, the incorporation of load cells in the facial area of the dummy skull structure can make it dif- ficult to provide sufficient space for biomechanical facial structures or may interfere with the response of the neck as it flexes forward. The goal was to develop a tech- nique that could determine the magnitude and the loca- tion of the resultant facial contact force while adding little or no complication to the dummy and its associated data acquisition system. Since one of the overall goals of the program was to provide more complete and accurate assessment of brain injury potential, we had already chosen to measure angular acceleration as well as translatlonal acceleration. This measurement allows the determination of the location of the resultant contact force in the following way. The magnitude of the resultant contact force acting on the dummy head can be determined in terms of the x, y and z components of the force by applying Newton's Laws to the balance of inertial forces and neck reaction forces. As the face is initially loaded, the contact must be on the periphery of the dummy head. Since the shape of the head is known, it can be used in conjunc- tion with the neck reaction moments and forces and the head angular accelerations to solve for the location of the resultant force by summing moments about the head center of gravity. The details of this procedure are given in the following section. 3020</page><page sequence="6">When the head of a Hybrid ill dummy Is Impacted, the forces acting on the head are the impact force, the neck force, and the neck moment. The Impact force Is to be determined and the reacting neck force and mo- ment at the head/neck junction are measured by the standard Hybrid III neck load cell. These quantities are needed to solve the force and moment balance of the head. Many frontal impact test configurations can be approximated as planar motion, particularly during the early head contact phase. The following discussion of force and moment balance is given for mid-sagittal plane head motion for simplicity. Plane motion of a rigid body can be determined completely by three scalar equations, namely the force balance in two directions and the moment balance about the axis perpendicular to the plane of motion. The ap- plied force components are calculated from the force balance once the translatlonal acceleration components are found. Moment balance about the lateral axis at the center of gravity (CG) of the head Involves the known distances from the neck load cell to the CG, and the un- known components of the position vector of the contact point, which is located on the dummy head profile, rela- tive to the CG. Measurement of the moments at the head/neck junction and head angular acceleration about the head lateral axis, combined with the mass moment of inertia of the dummy head about the CG, allows a balance equation to be written between the moment of the applied Impact force and the combination of the neck reaction moment and head Inertlal moment. Since all the latter moments are measured or calculated, their sum can be calculated at each Instant In time during the impact. The unknowns in this balance equation are the two contact point vector components and a second rela- tion Is needed to calculate them. At the initiation of contact, the impact force contact point must lie on the 2D head profile. A digitized head profile (mid-sagittal) was obtained from a plot of center- line cross-section of the head and fitted by fifth-order polynomials. Since interest was limited to facial impacts with a car Interior, only the facial area was considered, and the nose area was simplified for ease of calculation. Location of the contact point could then be determined by simultaneously solving the moment balance equation and the polynomial equation for the two contact point lo- cation components at each time Instant. Two fifth-order polynomials were obtained after regrouping the terms. These equations were solved numerically and only real roots were considered. The format of the 2D motion analysis program was modified to accommodate the contact force components, their resultant, and its loca- tion. DEVELOPMENT OF A BIOMECHANICAL FACE - The development of the prototypes of the blomechanlcal face for the Hybrid III is detailed in a previous paper (Melvin and Shee, 1989). A summary of the develop- ment follows. The Initial specifications for defining facial Impact re- sponse consisted of a deflection requirement derived from localized loading data and a peak force require- ment derived from distributed load data. The specifica- tion for the deflections of the facial structure were based on the summary data shown In Figure 3 which indicate that, for rigid 25.4 mm diameter circular bar loading, the facial structure should allow approximately 25 mm of de- flection, Including soft tissue deformation, before bottom- ing out. The force level associated with the 25 mm de- flection was about 3 kN. Many energy absorbing solid or dense foam materials exhibit bottoming out behavior In compression at strain levels of 50 to 70 %. The Hybrid III face has about 12 mm of facial skin available to de- form, so an additional 25 mm of space was estimated to be required to provide enough material to control the forces at the desired deflection level. Examination of the standard Hybrid III skull showed that there was sufficient room to provide such space through modified facial ge- ometry without Interfering with other features of the skull design and associated instrumentation. Investigation of candidate materials for the modified face began by removing the face of a standard Hybrid III skull casting and welding in a flat aluminum plate with its front surface displaced 25 mm rearward from the origi- nal. This simplified headform was then used as a test platform to mount samples of the candidate materials for Impact testing. The test consisted of Impacting the face against a stationary 15.2 cm diameter rigid disc mounted on a biaxial load cell which was attached to a stationary support frame of a mlnl-sled. The modified head, on a standard Hybrid III neck, was attached to the moving carriage of the mini-sled. The carriage was guided by bearings and had a mass approximating that of the up- per torso of the dummy. The mini-sled was pneumati- cally powered and could attain speeds up to 7 m/s at 690 kPa Input air pressure. After the face struck the im- pactor surface/load cell, the sled carriage was arrested by a hydraulic cylinder. The test velocity chosen for evaluating material performance was 6.7 m/s. A number of materials and concepts were studied in an attempt to develop a self-restoring, repeatable facial structure with appropriate response. None of these were successful. Although the results were not encour- aging from the standpoint of meeting the desired initial peak force level of 6.3 kN, they did indicate the feasibility of controlling the secondary peak force to the 10.5 kN level in the space available. Replaceable Face Structures - The initial stiffness of the facial structure, coupled with force limiting by the in- itiation of fractures associated with the first force peak, is 3021</page><page sequence="7">indicative of a facial structural material that exhibits a pronounced yield behavior in compression. Aluminum honeycomb is a classic approach to achieving this re- sponse and was used by Tarriere et al (1981) in devel- oping a facial structure for the Part 572 dummy. Rigid polymer foams are another common class of materials that exhibit this type of behavior. These materials were not initially investigated because of the desire to have a self-restoring facial structure that did not need replace- ment after each test. Relaxing that requirement opened up the selection of materials and/or structures available for the face. A series of tests with different rigid foams were con- ducted to determine the appropriate density range and composition. The results indicated that a foam com- posed of a rigid polymer with a density in the 50 to 60 kg/m^ range was necessary to achieve both high initial stiffness and a suitable force limiting /energy manage- ment behavior. The material chosen for further devel- opment was a high density (56 kg/m3) extruded polysty- rene foam (Dow HI 115 STYROFOAM™ brand). It of- fered the advantage of a well-defined, commercially pro- duced material that could easily be machined to the needs of the facial structure. The shape of the structure was also defined to allow a simplified facial geometry that would encompass the general configuration of the major facial bones in a planar form (shown in Figure 6). The projected area of the face was 58 sq. cm. The shape and area were determined from the facial anthro- pometry used by Hubbard and McLeod (1974) to develop the Hybrid III skull. The thickness of the foam insert, relative to the total 38 mm space available, was determined from rigid 25.4 mm diameter bar tests with the mini-sled. The initial ma- terial test series had established that 38 mm of soft butyl rubber could control the bottoming out forces to the 10 kN level, so various combinations of butyl rubber thick- ness and foam thickness were tested with a rigid bar in place of the flat disc. The first combination tested was 25.4 mm of rubber backed by 12.7 mm of the HI 115 foam. This combination proved to be too stiff and the foam too strong to control the forces. Rather than try to obtain a lower density foam to re- duce the crush force, an array of holes was drilled through the foam to reduce the effective loaded cross- sectional area while maintaining the overall geometry of the structure. This proved to be an effective method for adjusting the crush strength of the face and, potentially, could be used to account for any lot-to-lot variation in the material density. The area was reduced by about 25% and resulted in peak forces similar to those in the Nyquist et al. study. The tests also indicated that better response was achieved by placing half the rubber layer behind the foam. Full face impacts were then conducted to evaluate Figure 6. Initial Prototype Replaceable Face Geometry Compared to the Human Facial Structure. the distributed load response of the structure. The higher energy of the full face test condition bottomed the 12.7 mm layer of foam. Accordingly, the foam thickness was increased to 19 mm and the rubber layer decreased to 19 mm. This combination proved to be able to control the force to the 5-6 kN level, but was not stiff enough during the initial loading phase. Placing 6.3 mm of rub- ber in front of the foam and the remaining 12.7 mm be- hind it increased the initial stiffness and resulted In the response shown in Figure 7. Tests using a 25.4 mm di- ameter circular rigid bar were also conducted to deter- mine whether the facial structure could meet the full face response requirement and still produce realistic forces under concentrated loading. The results, shown in Fig- ure 8, indicated satisfactory performance. 1Ö-] 8- r 1 2 / - / LLl I ° 6- ° 1 ■ / ' CO 6- ° / / ' ' 0 CO / / ' UL / ' CO UL 1 f / ' ' e CO 4- / ' 1 / ri 2- lJf 15.2 cm DIAMETER / / / RIGID FLAT DISC IMPACTOR ill 6.7 m/s oV-i-n , 1 ' i , O 2 4 6 8 10 TIME (ms) Figure 7.

EVALUATION OF THE REPLACEABLE FACE STRUC- TURE AND CONTACT FORCE METHOD PROTOTYPE 1 DEFORMABLE FACE - The modi- fied Hybrid III head, including the facial structure and the vinyl head skin with the face portion cut away, was ballasted to standard Hybrid III specifications. The head was instrumented with its standard head triaxial acceler- ometer and neck load cell, and an in-line accelerometer array for angular acceleration determination (Viano, et al., 1986). The result was termed the Prototype 1 de- formable face. It was subjected to a variety of steering wheel impact tests in both the research setting and in the routine test laboratory. The major concern was to evaluate the performance of the facial structure In both wheel rim and hub impacts. The evaluation included ob- servation of the deformation modes of the foam element, the apparent loaded area, and any tendency of the foam to fracture. Of secondary interest was the operational experience of having to replace the facial structure after every test and any problems associated with that proc- ess. Experience was gained with steering wheel/face in- teractions using mini-sled tests, sled-mounted body buck tests, and full scale crash tests. The tests simulated both restrained and unrestrained drivers. The basic fea- tures of the Prototype I structure proved to be effective in use and, in particular, the requirement to replace the deformable element after each test was not viewed as a detriment of the design. The consistency of the impact forces produced by the structure was found to be excel- lent. In a mini-sled test series simulating an unre- strained driver striking the steering wheel rim the coeffi- cient of variation was 2.7% for eleven different combina- tions of steering wheel design and test speed, repeated twice for each combination. A series of four mini-sled tests in which the zygomatic region of the face struck a rigid 25.4 mm diameter bar mounted on a load cell pro- duced peak contact force values from the head accel- eration/neck force method that were within 2-3 % of the load cell values. The computation method located the contact point typically within 5 mm. One of the issues in facial injury assessment is the distribution of load on the face. Although the force com- putation method presented here can only find the loca- tion of the resultant load, the permanent deformation characteristic of the HI 115 foam is such that the distri- bution of significant load on the facial element is cap- tured as an easily visualized pattern on the element (Figure 9). Thus, the combination of the location of the peak resultant contact force from the analytical method with the permanent deformation pattern on the facial element was found to give sufficient insight into load dis- tribution questions in most test situations. Figure 9. Deformation Pattern on the Prototype Facial Structure due to Rigid Bar Impact. The testing experience did suggest a number of modifications to the shape and structure of the foam element. Specifically, the mini-sled tests indicated oc- casions where the eyebrow area of the head became in- volved in rigid disc loading with resulting high loads. Ongoing testing of cadavers at WSU, in which similar 3023</page><page sequence="9">loading of that region occurred, did not produce similarly high loads, although fractures of the forehead as well as the face occurred. Concern was also expressed over the ability of the Prototype 1 face to deal with oblique impacts to the cheekbone area. Finally, on occasion in steering rim impacts to the lower face, the foam was ob- served to have fractured transversely between the holes. PROTOTYPE 2 DEFORMABLE FACE - A second head and face structure was designed to reflect the ex- perience gained with the first system. The foam element was redesigned to cover the frontal bone area above the eyes and side wings were added to provide oblique cheekbone coverage. As shown in Figure 10, this was accomplished without changing the effective facial bone coverage provided by the Prototype 1 element. The hole pattern was changed to have more, slightly smaller, holes arranged to minimize the occurrence of cracks connecting transversely between them. No holes were placed in the frontal sinus area above the eyes because there are no response data for this region. Future biomechanical studies will be needed to generate the In- formation. The skull setback for the facial structure was extended up into the forehead as far as possible without changing the region of the forehead involved with the frontal impact response of the head. Figure 10. Prototype 2 Replaceable Face Geometry Compared to the Human Facial Skeleton. Because of the flat support surface of the facial struc- ture and the width required of the facial element to rep- resent the facial bones, it was found necessary to in- crease the skull setback an additional 6.4 mm to pre- serve accurate Hybrid III facial anthropometry in the cheekbone areas on either side of the nasal area. The combination of these skull and foam changes was termed the Prototype 2 face. Full-face rigid impact tests of a featureless Prototype 2 face verified that the basic performance of the face was not changed by these modifications (Figure 11). The Prototype 2 face was used in a series of sled tests to compare it with the standard Hybrid III in head impact injury assessment in high severity (67 km/hr) crash simulations. The dummies were restrained by a lap/shoulder belt restraint system which was adjusted to allow the face to strike the steering wheel hub as the torso was restrained by the shoulder belt. Identical steering systems were used in each test. The results of a pair of the tests, in terms of the resultant head accel- erations, are shown in Figure 12. The standard dummy head produced a 40 percent higher peak acceleration than the head with the deformable face. The 36 ms in- terval Head Injury Criterion (HIC) values for the two tests varied only by 2.5 percent, however, because the time duration of the acceleration of the test with the deform- able face was greater. These preliminary data suggest that the use of the deformable face on the Hybrid III head In routine restraint system testing should allow im- proved facial injury assessment without significantly changing the HIC values associated with standard 101 8- r 1 Z / ~ / LU I ^ 6 - 0 / XX 0 = '/ / XX I ' R = 4- I ' Ï 'J' 1 'l' 2- 11 15.2 cm DIAMETER IN / RIGID FLAT DISC IMPACTOR I I 6.7 m/s O V 1 i 1 1 r- 1 O 2 4 6 8 10 TIME (ms) Figure 1 1 .

FACIAL FEATURES - The presence of some soft material on the surface of a dummy face is important for maintaining proper facial anthropometry to preserve proper spacing of facial contact points relative to the rest of the body surfaces. However, humanlike nose and lip facial features, even if they would be intended to pro- duce no significant mechanical response through the use of soft foam covered by a thin vinyl layer, are not desirable in a dummy face. The durability of such fea- tures is questionable and the presence of a mechanically durable nose and lips could result in reduced repeatabil- ity of the test device. Accordingly, the final version of the deformable face does not include nose and lip fea- tures. PRODUCTION DEFORMABLE FACE The features of the Prototype 2 Deformable Face were reviewed from the standpoints of manufacturing, ease of use, and durability. This review resulted in some minor changes in the deformable facial element for ease of manufacture. The design of the production version of the deformable facial element and its butyl rubber backing plate was performed at the General Mo- tors R&amp;D Center. The design of the production Hybrid III head and associated vinyl head skin and facial skin, which accommodate the deformable facial elements, was performed at First Technology Safety Systems. PRODUCTION DEFORMABLE FACIAL ELEMENT - The basic shape and features of the 19 mm thick Proto- type 2 facial element are retained in the production ver- sion, however, they were modified in detail to allow it to be manufactured more easily. As shown in Figure 13, the sharp reentrant corners around the orbital and zy- gomatic areas were changed to large circular radii to eliminate having to cut along two intersecting lines. This avoided the potential for overcutting in these areas. A series of fixtures were designed to allow the facial ele- ments to be cut out to shape with a band saw and a hole saw and the hole pattern to be drilled out on a drill press. These fixtures allowed the facial elements to be fabri- cated quickly and reproducibly with simple shop equip- ment rather than with elaborate machining equipment. The rubber backing plate for the facial element was de- signed to have raised portions to locate the facial ele- ment and keep it in place laterally. These features are shown in Figure 14. The backing plate is molded out of 40 durometer butyl rubber and is 6.4 mm thick under the area supporting the deformable facial element.. /#oo8°o°0^' y o o o o '' (ļļS /#oo8°o°0^' y o o o o y o o o o '' Figure 13.

The face area of the skull is machined off 38 mm deep from the top of the eye socket down to the bottom of the chin, leaving only the forehead to preserve the head drop test response. Two welded plates replace the machined facial structure, a small horizontal plate under the fore- head and a large 6.6 mm thick vertical flat plate covering the facial area to allow for support of the deformable facial structural elements. Three threaded holes are added to the aluminum skull, one on each side of the face and the third in the redesigned chin. Machine screws are used to anchor the facial skin to these holes. The finished skull is shown in Figure 15. Figure 15. Modified Hybrid III Skull Assembly. A solid vinyl head skin covers the skull and has clearance holes that overlap the threaded holes of the skull, the skin is recessed in the area of the holes. The thickness of the vinyl skin underlying the deformable facial structures is 6.6 mm. The facial skin is solid vinyl and has the general external shape of the standard Hy- brid III face with exception of the prominent nose and lips which been deleted for durability and test repeatabil- ity reasons. Internally, the skin is molded to conform to the shape of the deformable facial foam element for lo- cation purposes. Three flaps with mounting holes ex- tend from the facial skin and overlap the recessed parts of the head skin. Three metal washers and three flat- head screws are used to fasten the facial skin to the head at both sides of the forehead and behind the chin Figures 16 and 17 show the various components of the production Hybrid III Deformable Face system. Because the aluminum skull has its forward surface moved rearward, new ballasting of the head was needed to keep the center of gravity location and associated mass moment of inertia within Hybrid III specifications. The solid vinyl covering of the rear cap on the skull has been replaced with a vinyl covered urethane foam to lower Its weight and help move the center of gravity for- ward. Figure 16.

Complete Production Deformable Face Assembly. 3026</page><page sequence="12">PRODUCTION DEFORMABLE FACE PERFORMANCE - Impact tests using a 25.4 mm diameter rigid bar impac- tor surface were conducted at FTSS to verify the per- formance of production versions of the deformable face structure. The impactor was mounted on the standard moving mass impactor for the chest impact response certification of the Hybrid III mid-size male dummy and struck the seated dummy in the face. Impacts were conducted at both the zygomatic and maxillary areas of the face. Three samples of the facial element were cho- sen randomly from stock. The results of the zygomatic tests are summarized in Table 1 in terms of impactor velocity, peak force and time of occurrence of the force peak. Also shown are the average values and the cor- responding specifications for facial response to the rigid bar test. The variation in peak force was less than 6% of the mean value. TABLE 1. Production Face Test Results - Rigid Bar - Zygomatic Impact Test No. Velocity, Peak Force, Time, m/s kN ms RX-1-Z-1 4.35 2A6 6J RX-2-Z-1 4.33 254 7.2 RX-3-Z-1 4.33 2^6 6J Average 4.34 2.47 65 Specifi- 3.6(2.8-4.8) 2.97 ±.72 5.9 ±1.1 cation I I I The three maxillary impacts were conducted at a nominal velocity of 4.2 m/s and produced an average peak force of 1.53 kN with a range of 1.41 to 1.65 kN. These values compare favorably with the forces pro- duced by Allsop, et al. (1988) for maxillary impacts. Dynamic force-deflection tests were performed on the production deformable face at GM R&amp;D. A high- speed, closed-loop hydraulic testing machine (MTS) was used to load a 25.4 mm diameter rigid bar impactor into the zygomatic region of the face structure while the head was supported by the bed of the testing machine. The test was conducted at a cross-head speed of 3.5 m/s and deflection was determined by measuring the loading ram motion. The resulting load-deflection responses of three samples of the structure are shown in Figure 18 along with the biomechanical response corridors from Figure 3. The corridors have been shifted to the left, along the deflection axis, to allow correspondence of the curves at the 0.25 kN force level, the region where significant force response begins to occur. The re- sponse of the deformable facial structure falls within the biomechanical corridors and exhibits close correspon- dence to the stiffness of the face in the initial loading region. Response in this region is most important for assessing the initiation of facial bone fractures. Figure 18. Force-Deflection Responses of Three Pro- duction Hybrid III Deformable Faces for Rigid 25.4 mm Diameter Bar Transverse Loading at 3.5 m/s Compared with the Response Corridor from Figure 3. CONCLUSIONS Sufficient data on human mid-face impact response to rigid-bar localized loading, analogous to steering rim loading, has been reported in the biomechanics literature to allow the definition of biomechanical response charac- teristics for such loading. Preliminary data for distributed facial loading are also available, but further work is needed to fully describe the response to distributed im- pact for the severity range of interest. This study has used the available data to generate suggested dummy faceform response corridors for both types of loading. A facial structure which produces biomechanically realistic impact force response for localized and distrib- uted loading has been developed for production for the Hybrid III mid-size male dummy. The structure can be accommodated through simple modifications to the original Hybrid III head. The modifications do not inter- fere with the standard instrumentation, anthropometry, range of neck flexion motion, or biomechanical forehead impact response of the Hybrid III and allow facial contact force to be determined using the standard instrumenta- tion. The modified facial structure has been used in a variety of laboratory settings and the utility and efficacy of the design have been verified.
