<plain_text><page sequence="1">LOCKE SETMAN, EMIL NOLDE AND THE SEARCH FOR EXPRESSION IN N. SCOTT MOMADAY'S THE ANCIENT CHILD BY MATTHIAS SCHUBNELL N. Scott Momaday's latest novel, The Ancient Child, reflects the author's artistic venture into the medium of painting, which he has been pursuing seriously for twenty years.l While many critics have praised Momaday's writing for its visual power, The Ancient Child is undoubtedly his most painterly novel so far. In tracing Set's transformation from a successful but disingenuous Kiowa painter to an artist who grounds his work in a vital tribal heritage, Momaday rejects the commercialization of art and ties Set's Kiowa identity and artistic genius to myth, place, and the human unconscious. By establishing a parallel between Set's search for a primal, mythic mentality to invigorate his creativity and similar efforts by the German expressionist painter, Emil Nolde, Momaday formulates a Native American version of expressionism and points to Nolde's writings and paintings as illuminating commentaries on Set's awakening artistic powers. Locke Setman's search to uncover a primal, mythic mentality in order to find his identity and artistic genius reflects many of the concerns that expressionist artists, Nolde among them, pursued in their protest against modern society. As Oskar Pfister pointed out, "the Expressionist wants to reproduce the intrinsic meaning of things, their soul-substance... [he] creates out of the depth of things, because he knows himself to be in those depths. To paint out of himself and to paint himself means to reproduce the intrinsic nature of things, the Absolute" (quoted in Osborne 1981:181). In Nolde's own words, his painting represented a search for "foreign, primal and racial origins" (quoted in Lloyd 1991:185). When Nolde visited New Guinea in 1914, he hoped to uncover the mythic origins of art and tap into the collective unconscious, as Jung called it (Selz 1963:33). Set does the same in his native Oklahoma. Nolde was interested in tribal art for its authenticity and potential to reinvigorate modern painting. The changes in Set's work from imposed commercial standards to true expressions of his creativity result from his return to tribal traditions. In tracing the kinship between Locke Setman and Emil Nolde, this essay argues that Momaday's latest novel, like much of his earlier work, transcends its Native American context and challenges the reader to see commonalities behind ethnic particulars.2 Moreover, the novel stands as Momaday's most comprehensive commentary on the art of painting and reflects the growing integration of his dual talents as a writer and a painter.

GRAPHITE AND WASH. 1988. 470 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/FALL 1994/VoL. 18(4)</page><page sequence="4">THE SEARCH FOR EXPRESSION Momaday establishes the connection between Set's work and that of Emil Nolde with a comment by Lola Bourne, Set's lover, who likens his painting, Night Window Man, to Nolde's Sternenwandler, or Wanderer Among the Stars. Says Lola: "Do you know the Sternenwandle?. It is one of the really haunting paintings of the world, isn't it? It is a kind of art that transcends itself. You look at it and you see beyond art-that is the illusion, at least. You see farther into the universe than you have ever seen; you behold the infinite" (p. 147). Set's Night WindowMan shows "a bright green frame, a window, in which was a roiling blue and gray background, a thick, ominous depth; and from this there emerged a figure, a grotesque man with red hair and red dress, approaching" (p. 106). It had come about as a spontaneously executed study in color, so strange and disturbing that Jason, Set's agent, had counseled against showing it. The picture did not conform to the artistic- commercial image Jason had created for his client. Lola comments on the Night Window Man, "The little man, the dwarf... is intent in the extreme. There is a profound energy and excitement in him. .... I think he's about to be transformed" (p. 107). She intuitively senses here that the painting anticipates Set's own transformation, even before Set travels to Oklahoma where he is to meet "the Ancient Child," his mythic alter ego. Both Set's and Nolde's paintings function as windows into the mysteries of the universe and the self, as representations of the absolute. The Sternenwandler, a figure resembling a man with a bear face, hovers above a blue sky and is surrounded by a cluster of bright stars.3 In the novel's context, of course, this image is evoked by the family name Setmaunt, which Momaday translates as "Walking Bear" (1992:95). It might also be taken as a variant of "Set-mante," or "Bear Above" (Mooney 1979:421), and relates directly to Set's metamorphosis into a bear and to the Kiowa myth surrounding Devil's Tower, the endpoint of his journey. The similarities between the two paintings also suggest that in the Night Window Man Set has unconsciously entered a new artistic phase in which he is able to reconcile his art and self, and which can best be described by making reference to some basic tenets of expressionism. Specifically, the expressionists' interest in the connection between place and art, their assertion that the human unconscious-particularly dreams and visions-is the source of artistic creation, their exploration of myth and tribal art, their new techniques stressing spontaneity and color to express subjective feeling and their emulation of a childlike vision are all among Momaday's consid- erations in The Ancient Child. In their reaction against the uprooting effects of modern civilization, many expressionist artists celebrated a wise, intuitive, earth-centered con- sciousness as the proper way to tie individuals to a specific place from which they can draw spiritual sustenance (Bronner 1983:298). Peter Selz asserts that "no modern painter was so intimately rooted to the earth and his homeland" as Emil Nolde (Selz 1963:9). One of Nolde's own statements regarding the AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/FALL 1994/VOL. 18(4) 471</page><page sequence="5">MATTHIAS SCHUBNELL importance of place provides an illuminating commentary on the protagonist's dilemma in Momaday's novel: "Every artist finds his own place, and the one who cannot find his place is the hunted, unhappy misfit" (Nolde, quoted in Haftmann 1965:34). Set suffers because he has severed vital connections to his Kiowa homeland, without even knowing the significance of this disloca- tion. It is one reason for his personal and artistic crisis which he must overcome by a new commitment to place. When Set sees the red earth of Oklahoma, he spontaneously refers to it as catlinite, the color of his father's name" (p. 63), and, sensing "some ancestral intelligence... something profoundly original" (p. 64) issuing from the earth, he intuitively knows that this presence has significant bearing on his personal genesis. To the extent that Set surrenders to this spirit of place, he overcomes his rootlessness and lack of self-knowledge. The nexus between place and self finds expression in names, both in Momaday's novel and Nolde's life. Set's mythic affiliation with the bear-Set means bear in Kiowa-ties him to Tsoai, Devil's Tower, in the same way that Momaday's Kiowa name, Tsoai-talee, or Rock Tree Boy, links him to this ancient landmark on the Kiowa migration route from the northern moun- tains to the Great Plains. When the Kiowas encountered this extraordinary land formation, they explained its origin by telling a story of seven sisters, whose brother was transformed into a bear and chased them into a tree. The girls climbed higher and higher to escape the terrifying beast and became the seven stars of the Big Dipper. The bear slid down the tree's trunk after his failed pursuit, and his claw marks account for the unmistakable appearance of the great rock which emerged from the tree. It is because of this mythic connection that Set gravitates toward Devil's Tower, where he finally merges with the Ancient Child and becomes the bear. Like his nomadic ancestors before him, whose vision of the Plains transformed them into a people of centaurs, Set finds his essential being in the presence of this rock, and like them he can say: "From this day on, I shall belong to this land, for it is truly worthy of my strength, my dreams, my life and death. Here I am. Here, I am" (p. 244). Emil Hansen adopted the name of his hometown, Nolde, in 1901 to affirm his rootedness to his ancestral land. By connecting himself by name to his birthplace and native soil, Nolde acknowledges his debt to the Earth as the source of his creative power. As Martin Urban pointed out, nature for Nolde is not simply important as a visible entity but as the source of experiences and knowledge of sacred forces that permeate and echo in the natural world, thus returning the artist to the realm of myth (Martin 1961:37). In a recent essay, Momaday makes a similar observation on the sacred connection between place and art: "the elements of place and vision, as they are realized in the imagination, in the mind's eye, if you will, form the aesthetic equation that is art. And I am speaking of particulars, not of any place, nor of any vision, but of sacred ground and ancient vision" (Momaday 472 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/FALL 1994/VOL. 18(4)</page><page sequence="6">THE SEARCH FOR EXPRESSION 1987:5). Nolde's work, like Set's emerging artistic expression, represents "a search for the primordial, for the primal forces of humanity which are at work beneath the thin veneer of civilization and convention" (Martin 1961:41). As a quester for personal and creative identity, Set must rely on the powers of his unconscious. He is obliged to gain faith in the mysterious messages emanating from his native soil and in his dreams. In doing so, he travels a road familiar to many expressionist artists who availed themselves of such intelligence through non-rational, instinctive-intuitive processes (Martin 1961:42). As Nolde puts it, "Excursions into the sphere of dreams, visions, fantasy worlds go beyond rules and cool expertise. These are free, splendid grounds and domains full of attractions and delight, a spiritual experience at once brilliant, deep and unforced. Those who cannot dream or observe cannot understand" (quoted in Haftmann 1965:38). Set's struggle to save his soul is reflected in the artistic meta- morphosis he undergoes which affirms his connection to a tribal con- sciousness and mythic precedents. "Art is affirmation," Momaday contends (p. 55) but "art is [also] resistance" (p. 7). Set's transformation, which is initiated by visionary experiences, manifests his resistance to those influences which threaten his identity. Recalling a dream about his dead mother reminds him not only that "she was the touch stone of his belief in the past" (p. 45), but also that "the dream becomes a story, a myth" (p. 43). This insight is crucial because Set will have to rely on his unconscious to confront the bear and to reinvigorate his art. In his vision of the Ancient Child upon his arrival at his relatives' home in Oklahoma, Set confronts his obliterated tribal self, even though at the time he is quite unaware of it: "The boy stood-seemed suspended-in the black interior of a lean-to, a brush arbor, perhaps thirty or forty yards away. He peered out of the depth as out of a cave, across a bright foreground, without expression" (p. 60). The vision links Set to the myth about the boy who had no name and was transformed into a bear. The boy's association with a cave, however, suggests not only Set's hibernating bear identity; it also establishes an associative link to Lascaux, the Paleolithic rock art gallery in France, often referred to as the cradle of art and mentioned repeatedly in the novel. Together, these connections indicate that Set's vision touches upon the deepest strata of his unconscious from which his personal and artistic regeneration must proceed. Set's subsequent dream of the boy reinforces the impression that he represents Set's "bearness": "The body was indistinct; only the face was shaped and barely delineated. It shone like a vague, powdered mask, like a skull" (p. 73; italics added). Here and on numerous subsequent occasions, Momaday uses puns to suggest Set's awakening recognition of his connection to the bear. The boy's face is suddenly transformed into the likeness of an ancient woman, reminiscent of Grey's grandmother, Kope-mah. It is Kope-mah who enlists Grey, her granddaughter and Set's future wife, to transfer the bear AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/FALL 1994/VOL. 18(4) 473</page><page sequence="7">MATTHIAS SCHUBNELL medicine bundle to the visiting artist. This dream vision, then, reveals the connection between the bear medicine, Kope-mah, Set and Grey.4 Central to this vision is Set's first futile attempt to articulate his emerging identification with the bear myth. However, he can only utter "words [that] were muffled and animal-like, groans and growls" (p. 73). This foiled attempt to articulate himself evokes the famous painting by Edvard Munch, The Scream, and similar works which Douglas Kellner reads in these terms: "The famous cries and shrieks of expressionist art . . . represent the cries of the individual subject facing repression and threats to its autonomy, inner life, and values" (Kellner 1983:28). Set, like Abel in House Made of Dawn, is initially inarticulate; only later, through the medium of painting, will Set succeed in expressing his true identity. As Set prepares for his return to San Francisco, he is unaware of the lasting effect his ancestral homeland has made on him. As far as he can tell, his visit has been a failure, and his earlier excitement about his self-discovery among the shadows of his past has worn off. "In his will he had done with this place.... His coming away from his work had been to no purpose, and he had nothing to show for it. He had stepped out of bounds. He was out of place in this severe red landscape, among the graves of strangers" (p. 104). At the same time that his consciousness denies his earlier intuitive attachment to place and ancestry, "he felt now a keen urgency to paint" (p. 104). This new creative impulse soon becomes instrumental in externalizing and capturing Set's emerging new identity. The pictures Set paints after his return to San Francisco depict his awakening tribal self as it rises in disturbing images from his unconscious. Among the canvasses in his studio is one, yet incomplete, which bewilders Set, even as he describes it: [T]here are stains, deep and infinite, in the flashes of yellow, white, blue, green, orange, red light. And I want to believe that there are real forms there, unique, intricate forms straightly related to a deep field of receding grounds, one after another, ranging to a black infinity, the definite forms of definite things, the very thing I cannot comprehend by other means. (p. 134) He has painted this picture in a state of profound uncertainty about his personal identity. Looking at his likeness in the mirror, he concludes that "the reflection in the glass is the transparent mask of a man" (p. 131). In rendering Set's contemplation of this image, Momaday uses a recurrent pun on "eye/ I," suggesting that the mimetic representation cannot capture the self behind the mask, that the "eye" can only produce an incomplete vision of the "I": "There is no edge to this image on the glass-but how can that be?-and there is only one eye! Strange. And in it, no spark of life. Yet it is a living eye" (p. 133). Later, Set wonders about "the still vacant eye" in the mirror (p. 133). He 474 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/FALL 1994/VOL. 18(4)</page><page sequence="8">THE SEARCH FOR EXPRESSION begins to recognize here that he must penetrate the surface, the mask, by transcending sense perception and relying on his inner eye/I to fill his vacuity and ignite the spark of life. His creativity allows him to do so, as his own definition of art suggests: "Art-drawing, painting-is an intelligence of some kind, the hand and the eye bringing the imagination down upon the picture plane; and in this a nearly perfect understanding of the act of understanding" (p. 132). Through his painting, Set can achieve "a composed unity of fragments which is a whole" (p. 132). What appears on his canvasses during this critical phase in his life are the fragments of his self which are beginning to crystallize, indeed "the very things [Set] cannot comprehend by other means" (p. 134). They emerge as "dark figures" in his work, and Set realizes that they are self-portraits: "[T]hey expressed a certain reality in me. I didn't know what it was, but I knew that it was, and I knew that it mattered greatly to me in some way" (p. 144). Without realizing that the bear medicine is taking possession of him, Set knows that he cannot resist this new force in his life. The painting Venture Beyond Timeproves to be a milestone on Set's journey toward self-knowledge. Some of the similarities in color and composition suggest that the incomplete canvas mentioned earlier has had its origin in the same groping phase which produced Venture Beyond Time. This painting is crucial because it captures Set's entry into the mythical realm of Kiowa culture: It was the likeness of a man on a horse, but the image was indistinct, subliminal. One had to look at the painting closely, steadily, in order to see what was there. The image receded far into the picture plane, which was composed of swirling colors, reds and yellows and browns, each describing a spacial dimension and all a succession of distances from the viewer's eye. To me, the impression was that of the horseman passing from time into timelessness, and indeed I titled it Venture Beyond Time. (p. 159) Set can, at least to a degree, articulate the meaning of his work. However, only the interpretation by Alais Sancerre, a French gallerist with whom Set has a brief affair, fully explains its significance to Set's self-searching endeavor. While he links the work's mystery to the medium of watercolor, Alais locates it in Set himself: " You are the mystery! ... If you were not mysterious yourself, you could not create that which is mysterious on paper or on canvas, is it not so? Of course, centaurs are mysterious too, aren't they?" (p. 160) Her response testifies to an expressionist communication between artist and viewer, if one defines expressionism as "a probing search for a deep emotional reality behind appearances-a reality that the artist finds in observing his own subjective reactions, and for which he then fashions an adequate and equivalent formal means to evoke a similar response in the viewer" (Selz AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/FALL 1994/VOL. 18(4) 475</page><page sequence="9">MATTHIAS SCHUBNELL 1963:38). It is apparent that Set has allowed Alais insight into his soul, even before he himself can see it clearly. Alais's perception that the horseman is a centaur properly identifies the image as a sign of Set's desire to become a Kiowa, an idea which is reinforced by her reference to Kafka's Wunsch, Indianerzu Werden [Desire to Become an Indian]and The Metamorphosis (p. 161). The painting attests to the process which returns Set to his Kiowa antecedents. In The Names, Momaday equates the idea of the centaur with the golden age of the Kiowas: "In the course of their long journey they had acquired horses, the sun dance religion, and a certain love and possession of the prairies. They had become centaurs in their spirit" (Momaday 1976:28). Venture Beyond Time, then, helps Set grasp his tribal heritage. Realizing that Alais Sancerre has discovered an important truth about his being, he returns to his studio to study the work and to discover "what deepest part of [him he] had imaged" (p. 161), namely his Kiowa origin. The technical means Set develops to express himself in his paintings are also reminiscent of the techniques used by expressionist artists such as Nolde. The two significant features are the painter's emphasis on spontane- ous execution and color. Commenting on a series of new drawings, Set tells Jason: "I've been working quickly.... I'm on to something, I think. I've come to a place where spontaneity is a key of some sort. ... I've returned to something elemental, and good is coming of it, I think" (p. 143). By suspending conscious control over the subject matter, Set allows his intuition to flow freely. Emil Nolde refers to this form of creativity as "passive art" which he views as an artist's most difficult achievement (quoted in Haftmann 1965:37). He also contends that "the quicker a painting is done, the better it is ... in art I fight for unconscious creation" (quoted in Selz 1963:16). Color becomes the primary vehicle for communication in this process. For Nolde, color provided a powerful means to convey subjects in nature as well as imaginary images. Werner Haftmann notes that Nolde employed the "magic, evocative force" of color to capture the sounds of nocturnal animals (1959:20). Nolde himself explained that in his painting "the cries appeared as shrill yellows, the hooting of owls in deep violet tones" (quoted in Haftmann 1965:20). But color could also evoke "images originat- ing in fantasy. This meant more than an enrichment of the expressive means: it opened a new path into the depths of the human psyche, the region where images are created to symbolize visual and spiritual experiences" (Haftmann 1959:24). It is this second function of color that becomes paramount in Locke Setman's search for expression. In the depth of his crisis of identity, after the death of his adoptive father, Bent, Set produces a series of paintings in a great outburst of creativity: "He filled the white expanse with color, whorls, streaks, gradation of color," creating images "mysterious and profound as ancient rock paintings, beasts and anthropomorphic forms proceeding from the far reaches of time" (p. 476 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/FALL 1994/VOL. 18(4)</page><page sequence="10">THE SEARCH FOR EXPRESSION 213). He vaguely understands that he is now working under the spell of the bear medicine, a notion reinforced by recurrent visions of a bear, one of which conveys his transformation into a bear. This image of "a dark, impending shape on a dark field of the sky. . . . glittering with amber stars." (p. 214-15) is strikingly similar to Nolde's Wanderer Among the Stars. It is during this period of turmoil that Set achieves control of his art, and of color in particular, to tell the "great and true story of the world" (p. 216). He now "understood color, and his placement of color, and his blending of colors, were nearly perfect" (p. 216), and he accepts his responsibility to become the painter of his story, relating his part in the myths of his tribe. Similarly, storytelling and painting are inseparable in Nolde's so- called Unpainted Pictures, a series of small watercolors Nolde painted while under house arrest imposed by the Nazi regime. Peter Selz sees them as "specific illustrations to unwritten stories. But the only fable that is illustrated ... is Nolde's own fantasy, the imagination of a storyteller whose images emerge from ancient myth and personal fantasy" (Selz 1963:71). Finally, Stephen Bronner notes that Nolde's emphasis on color is the technical means by which he gives expression to "a grounding principle of unity between man and nature, the individual and collectivity" (Bronner 1983:294). This same goal, of course, is what Set is trying to achieve in his search for his place in the community, geography, and mythology of his tribe. One final parallel between Set and Nolde is their yearning for uncorrupted, childlike expression. In Set's case, this is a reaction against the manipulative demands of the art market. After all, Locke Setman has become the darling of the American art world and, in the process, has allowed his creativity to be compromised. In this respect he is reminiscent of R. C. Gorman, whose commercial success has led to the endless reproduction of works designed to satisfy the demand for Gorman's typical woman, draped in a shawl and sporting an enlarged foot: "Those who exhibited [Set's] work, who praised and purchased it, and who demanded its proliferation began to determine it" (p. 36). Mindful of this danger, Set yearns to fill children with wonder and delight, to distance himself from the calculated, "narrow-eyed and glib" (p. 37) responses of dealers and critics. "To see and to paint with excitement, with a child's excitement, that is what brought him to life" (p. 37). As Set nears the end of his vision quest, living with Grey in a hogan near Lukachukai, he acquires the artistic creativity he had searched for, a spontaneous, childlike expression, unmediated by rational control, commer- cial demands or false artistic mannerisms: "In the days he drew and painted, watching the light change and the colors turn and shift upon the earth, the shadows extend and deepen. His paintings were strong and simple, primary, like those of a child" (p. 291). Nolde, too, valued child art for its unadulterated, intuitive, and direct expression (Lloyd 1991:169) and sought to emulate it. His ethno- graphic sketches are marked by their childlike character, reflecting a romantic AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/FALL 1994/VOL. 18(4) 477</page><page sequence="11">MATTHIAS SCHUBNELL idealization of tribal cultures. Yet this interest can also be explained in terms of a strong opposition to rationalism. As Stephen Bronner (1983:299) has pointed out, "Nolde emphasizes the irrational while seeking out the primitive and the childlike whose bond with nature remains uncorrupted." Only in this manner can the expressionist artist grasp the essence of his vision of an enchanted, mysterious world. In his review of TheAncient Child, J. E. Deflyer (1990:167) correctly anticipated that "it will be a substantial challenge for readers and critics to fully evaluate what Momaday has accomplished." This essay has attempted to take up the challenge by probing Momaday's reflections on painting, their relevance to Locke Setman's search for identity, and the connection between Locke Setman and Emil Nolde. This link discloses a parallel between Set, who searches for a primal, mythic mentality to reinvigorate his artistic power, and many expressionist artists, Nolde among them, who retreated from their modern, urban mass society to rediscover the power of myths and assert the role of place and the human unconscious in the genesis of artistic expression. NOTES 1. All citations to The Ancient Child in this article will be listed by page number only. 2. To some scholars of Native American literature, it is still anathema to stress influences on Native American works from outside the writer's tribal context and to suggest that such works may be valuable for reasons other than their ethnic elements. Despite Werner Sollers's effort to demystify an idealized concept of ethnicity in The Invention ofEthnicity (1989:vx) and Susan Perez Castillo's warning against a static view of ethnicity which ignores the writer's place in a multicultural context (1991:289), critics like Bernhard A. Hirsch are suspicious of this broader approach, claiming that "there is a tendency in western culture to resist the idea that 'aboriginal' cultures contain much to enrich our own intellectual and spiritual lives" (p. 91). This objection to a critical approach which assumes that Native American writers have also been enriched by western culture and that it is the critic's task to delineate this larger cultural context, patronizes the writers and fails to provide a balanced assessment of ethnic discourse. Given N. Scott Momaday's complex cultural and literary background, it is essential to transcend any narrow notion of his identity as a modern Kiowa writer and painter and see him as the sophisticated and multiculturally influenced artist he is. 3. Martin Gosebruch categorizes the Wanderer Among the Stars as a dream image and describes it thus: "Strolling through the sky with arms folded inside his cloak is a man with a copper- green, bearlike face, a messenger's cap clamped tightly on his head. Past clouds and stars he wends his way, humming to himself and looking as if he knows exactly where he is going" (1973:31). 4. While it is beyond the scope of this essay to explore in detail the character of Grey, it is necessary to examine her role in Set's search for artistic expression. She provides Set with the bear medicine, and "it was she who would bring him to his destiny. ... She would reveal him to himself" (p. 229). The medicine bundle, however, is not the only link between her, her grandmother Kope-mah, the ancient keeper of the bear medicine, and Set. As it turns out, Kope-mah had also been an artist, and in the process of saving Set from his impending collapse, Grey ritually puts him in touch with the old woman's work: "Often now she took from a drawer in the grandmother's room the drawings of the grandmother. Grey moved her fingers lightly along the edges of the paper, where Set's fingers too had pressed. She could feel his presence then, as a pulse that bore faintly upon her own, a vibration that was peculiarly his vitality" (p. 247). Earlier in the novel, Grey had asked Set to paint her face, copying the designs on her grandmother's "drawing on faded brown paper" (p. 112). That he realizes the significance of these designs is clear from a later conversation between him and Lola Bourne, in which he likens them to shields (p. 158). The full significance of his painting of Grey's face, however, escapes him. Asked by Lola whether he loved the woman whose face he had painted, Set unwittingly, by way of a pun, alludes to his latent bear identity which Grey is trying to bring forth: "'No, I barely knew her,' I said" (p. 158; italics added). It is evident from these passages that by 478 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/FALL 1994/VOL. 18(4)</page><page sequence="12">THE SEARCH FOR EXPRESSION bringing Set into the presence of traditional, tribal art, Grey helps facilitate both his artistic and mythical transformation. While Grey is not a painter herself, she develops a painterly imagination as she grows closer to Set. She "wondered what it was to be a painter. She wished she could transfer her dreams to canvas, to stand apart from them for a moment, to see them as if they were placed on gallery walls, open to public view. Surely that would be the achievement of perspective, objectivity" (p. 228). This, of course, is the same process Set uses to uncover his inner self. Later, Grey experiences a vision of her grandmother Kope-mah as a beautiful young girl, seeing her "as in a painting" (p. 230). Gradually, she acknowledges that "Locke Setman was in the center of her design "(p. 248; italics added), and before she departs with Set for Lukachukai, she prays to the sun and draws the map of their destiny in the sand: "Kneeling, then, she would draw lines on the red earth, describing where she and her man must go" (p. 260). Here she becomes the shaman as artist, translating visions into art and using her map to guide Set toward his destined metamorphosis. Her own return to the ancient traditions of her ancestral world is reflected in her making of masks. While she nurses the dying Kope-mah, Grey becomes a maker of masks: "They were the faces of animals and humans and spirits. And when she put on a certain mask, it was as if she put on the power of the spirit it represented, too .... in time they would be made in the proper way, with deep belief, and they would be not only objects of art, but sacred objects, objects of power" (p. 176). Her creation of these masks reflects her growing integration into the rhythms of the land and her acceptance of the magical powers the old woman Kope-mah is passing on to her granddaughter, her "chosen one" (p. 194). Her wearing of masks affords her an experience of magical transformation, an assumption of power beyond that of the human realm. As she places the mask of a great turtle's skull upon her head, "it seemed indeed to be her head, her skull, well beyond the effect of most masks. It was wonderfully large and reptilian, simple in its smooth, sunbleached appearance, but sinister too. There was an aspect of evil in it" (p. 198). With this "unearthly turtle mask tilted downward," she confronts Dwight Dicks, who had raped her earlier in the novel, and, as a mythic female avenger, she looks "into his stricken soul" (p. 200), reminding him of his violation and her power to keep him at bay. The function of masks as symbols of spiritual powers in the universe is also evident at the dance at Oljeto, the final ceremony Grey and Set attend before Set's reenactment of the bear myth at Devil's Tower. Here the dancers "emulated the mountain gods. Their chanting was high-pitched and unintelligible even to themselves. But the dancers were invisible behind the masks, and the gods were visible in them. The gods were real, and they had come from another world. They were the shapes of immortality" (p. 304). The masks in this ceremonial, then, afford the dancers the opportunity to enact divine powers, shed their identity in time and space and submerge themselves in a mythic realm, thus affirming their place in an ancient and ongoing spiritual reality. It is toward this same goal that Grey, the maker of masks and medicine woman, is leading Locke Setman. REFERENCES Bronner, Eric Stephen. 1983 "Emil Nolde and the Politics of Rage."
