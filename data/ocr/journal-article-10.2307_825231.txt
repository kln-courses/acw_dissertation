<plain_text><page sequence="1">Henry Lesser* THE ACQUISITION OF INTER VIVOS MATRIMONIAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN ENGLISH LAW: A DOCTRINAL MELTING POT During 1971 English matrimonial law underwent a profound transforma- tion, reflecting a fundamental change in social attitudes towards the judicial termination of marriage. First, on I January 1971 the Divorce Reform Act 1969 became law, abolishing the concept of the matrimonial offence as the basis for divorce and substituting the doctrine of irretrievable breakdown of marriage.1 The Act effected the same substitution in the law governing the grant of judicial separation decrees by the High Court.2 It also recognised the need to ensure adequate financial protection to respondents before terminating the marriage on certain grounds, and accordingly it empowered the courts to delay making decrees nisi absolute in cases based on two- or five-years' living apart unless the petitioner has made such financial provision for the respondent as is adequate in the circumstances, and to refuse divorce decrees altogether in cases based on five-years' living apart if satisfied by the respon- dent that a divorce would cause grave financial or other hardship.3 * Barrister at Law, currently temporary associate with Spear and Hill, New York, 1971- 3, a Harkness Fellow of the Commonwealth Fund of New York at Harvard Law School, formerly College Lecturer in Law, Lincoln College, Oxford, x968-9, and Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge, 1970-I. This article endeavours to state the law as at I May 1973. I 1969, c. 55. For general analysis see Bromley Family Law (4th ed 1971), chapter 8; Passingham Law and Practice in Matrimonial Causes (1971), chapters 2-4. For com- parison with the Canadian Divorce Act, Stats Can. 1967-8, c 24, see Deech, (1972) Modern L.R. I 13. The act specifies five types of conduct as the exclusive bases for proving irretrievable breakdown. These are not conclusive evidence: s 2(3); Ash v Ash, [1972] I All E.R. 582; Carew-Hunt v Carew-Hunt, The Times, 28 June I972. But breakdown need only be shown to be irretrievable as at the date of the hearing: Pheasant v Pheasant, [1972] 1 All E.R. 587. The five types are: A/ Adultery, but only if petitioner finds it intolerable to live with respondent; for the relation between these two factors see Goodrich v Goodrich, [1971] 2 All E.R. 1340, Roper v Roper &amp; Porter, (1972) I W.L.R. 1314, Wachtel v Wachtel, The Times, I August 1972. B/ Respondent has behaved in such a way that petitioner cannot reasonably be expected to continue living with him or her. This is more flexible than 'cruelty': Ash v Ash, Pheasant v Pheasant, Roper v Roper &amp; Porter, Carew-Hunt v Carew-Hunt, Richards v Richards, (1972) I W.L.R. 1O73, Katz v Katz, [1972] 3 All E.R. 219. C/ Two-years' continuous desertion instead of three. D/ Two-years' continuous living apart, if respondent consents to divorce; on 'consent' see McG (formerly) R v R, [1972] I All E.R. 362 Beales v Beales, [1972] 2 All E.R. 667, Mason v Mason, (1972) 3 W.L.R. 405. E/Five- years' continuous living apart; on 'living apart' under D and E see Mouncer v Mouncer, [1972] 1 All E.R. 289, Santos v Santos, [1972] 2 All E.R. 246. 2 The matrimonial offence concept continues to determine the availability of judicial separation decrees in magistrates' courts. As to the matrimonial jurisdiction of these courts see Bromley, supra note x, at chapter 7, Passingham, supra note I, at chapter 18. 3 On grave financial hardship see Parkes v Parkes, [1971], 3 All E.R. 870, Parker v (1973), 23 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL 148</page><page sequence="2">INTER VIVOS MATRIMONIAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN ENGLAND 149 Secondly, on I January 1971 the Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Act I97o also came into force, providing a thorough revision of the law governing decrees for financial support between spouses and abolishing several arbitrary distinctions between the treatment of husbands and wives and between decrees available during the marriage and those obtainable upon judicial termination.4 Thirdly, on I August 1971 the Nullity of Mar- riage Act 1971 took effect. This does not substantially alter the bases for annulment decrees but it removes a number of bars to such decrees.5 Pro- ceedings under the Act are, ex hypothesi, 'nullity proceedings' for the pur- poses of the application to them of the Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Act 1970. The effect of this legislation is clear. Despite provisions in the Divorce Reform Act empowering the courts to delay proceedings in order to inves- tigate the possibility of reconciliation,6 judicial termination of marriage has become easier to obtain and a less perturbing financial prospect, especially for women. However, except in incidental respects mentioned at various later points, the Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Act does not deal Parker, [I1972] 1 All E.R. 410, Mathias v Mathias, [1972] 3 All E.R. I, Dorrell v Dorrell, [1972] 3 All E.R. 343, Julian v Julian, (1972) 116 SoI.J. 763. But even in a case based on five-years' nonconsensual separation the courts will avoid resurrecting the matrimonial offence concept by seeking to determine which spouse was responsible for the breakdown with a view to awarding costs, and will normally make no award: Chapman v Chapman, (1972) I W.L.R. 1544. 4 1970, c 45.

On the relation between a spouse's causal responsibility for marital breakdown and rights to financial support under the act, see Ackerman v Ackerman, [1972] 2 All E.R. 420. The act also abolished the decree of restitution of conjugal rights. 5 1971, c 44. For the law applicable to marriages celebrated before I August 1972 see Bromley, supra note I, at chapter 3, Passingham, supra note I, at 67-78. For analysis of the new law see Passingham, at 78 ff, Hall, (1971) Cambridge L.J. 20o8, Cretney, (1972) 35 Modern L.R. 57. The two principal changes in substantive law are: A/ lack of consent now renders the marriage voidable, not void; B/ annulment of a voidable marriage now operates only prospectively. The bars removed are: A/ certain decrees formerly obtainable only in proceedings brought within one year of marriage can now be sought within three; BI in suits based on respondent's mental disorder petitioner's knowledge of the disorder at the date of marriage is no longer a bar; c/ the occurrence of marital intercourse after discovery of the facts on which the petition is based does not preclude a decree; D/ collusion is no longer a bar whether the petition is prosecuted under the old or new law but a new statutory bar applies to all petitions alleging voidable marriages, replacing the discretionary bar of approbation with the absolute bar of estoppel: if the petitioner, with knowledge of the possibility of obtaining an annulment, has so acted as to lead the respondent responsibly to believe a nullity decree would not be sought, then the petition is barred if it would be unjust to grant the decree. 6 In order to enable the court to determine whether such a possibility exists, the petitioner's solicitor must certify whether or not he has given his client the name and address of persons qualified to help effect a reconciliation: Matrimonial Causes Rules 1971 (s.I. 1971, no. 953), rule 12(3) and appendix 2, form 3. The solicitor need not refer his client to any particular individual, since certain organizations have been designated as appropriate reconciliatory assistants for the purposes of the legislation: Practice Direction, [1972] 3 All E.R. 768. See, generally, Samuels, (1971) 121 New L.J. 834.</page><page sequence="3">150 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL with the question of in rem rights in matrimonial property.' Although this question can arise at any stage in the marriage, the typical situation in which it reaches the courts is where the marriage has broken down and one of the spouses is anxious to ensure a favourable divorce, nullity, or judicial separation settlement. With the increase in the number of cases involving broken marriages reaching the courts in recent years has come a propor- tionate increase in the incidence of matrimonial property litigation and this increase is likely to continue as a result of the new legislation. This litigation has consistently posed one legal problem above others: the extent to which special rules of property law govern the acquisition by spouses of inter vivos rights in matrimonial property legal ownership of which has remained vested in only one of them during the marriage, in particular the matrimonial home, which is often the only substantial asset. Can the courts, either through particular doctrine applicable to husband and wife, or in the exercise of some judicial discretion unfettered by a priori rules, hold a spouse entitled to property rights which would not have been acquired under general property law and, if so, can they quantify these rights so as to effect what they regard as a just over-all financial settlement between parties to a broken marriage? It is this problem which is analysed in the present article." Thus far parliament has intervened in matrimonial property law in two important respects. It has statutorily reversed the decision by the House of Lords in National Provincial Bank v Ainsworth9 that a deserted spouse possesses no proprietary right to occupy the home, enforceable in rem during the marriage, by enacting the Matrimonial Homes Act 1967;10 and it has 7 The term 'matrimonial property' is employed to denote that kind of property which is, in fact, used by the spouses in the course of, and incidentally to, married life. It is not a term of art. 8 For a general discussion of the problem and the modern case law see Bromley, supra note I at chapter 14, Passingham, supra note I, at 188-96, Parker and Mellows, The Modern Law of Trusts (2d ed 1970) 131-41, Pettit, Equity and the Law of Trusts (2d ed 1970) 93-10o7, Law Commission Published Working Paper no. 42, Family Property Law (October 1971), parts InB and 2, Gareth Miller, (1970) Law Q.R. 98, Kahn-Freund, supra note 4. 9 [1965] 2 All E.R. 472.

Originally it only protected a spouse with no such other right: Gurasz v Gurasz, [1969] 3 All E.R. 822. Now it also protects spouses enjoying purely equitable occupation rights outside it. Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Act 1970, s 38. The statutory rights terminate with the marriage unless, before decree absolute, a court specifically orders their extension or unless the other spouse holds on a statutory tenancy under the Rent Acts which a court orders transferred to the protected spouse. (If such a tenancy ends before the marriage then the occupation rights die with it: Penn v Dunn, (1970) 3 W.L.R. 321.) The statutory rights consist of: A/ a right, if already in occupation, to continue until evicted by a court order under the act; B/ a right, if not in occupation, to take posses- sion with judicial leave. Each right operates as an equitable incumbrance registrable</page><page sequence="4">INTER VIVOS MATRIMONIAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN ENGLAND 151 conferred on courts handling the financial aspects of divorce, judicial separa- tion, and nullity wide powers under the Matrimonial Proceedings and Prop- erty Act 1970 to order one spouse's property to be used for the financial support of the other (discussed infra page 184). However, parliament has thus far enacted no general principles for determining what a priori property rights are acquired in matrimonial property by a spouse without legal title thereto. The Law Commission is currently engaged in the preparation of final proposals for extensive legislation on this question, but it will probably be at least two years before its proposals take effectn and in the meantime the legal profession has to grapple with complex and confusing caselaw. Moreover, a full grasp of this complexity and confusion will be essential to an understanding of the content of the intended legislation and an evalua- tion of its success. For these reasons an examination of the present law is felt worthwhile, and it will take as its focal point two recent decisions of the House of Lords: Pettitt v Pettitt and Gissing v Gissing.12 It must be empha- sised at the outset that no attempt is made herein at a sociological, economic, or ethical evaluation of the present law. The criteria by which the relevant judicial decisions and statutory enactments will be judged are those of doctrinal clarity, consistency, and ease of application for, in my view, these are the indispensable qualities of any law which lawyers are asked to ad- minister with that efficiency and equal justice which transcends substantive content. under the Land Charges Act 1925, s io. Right B is registrable even before judicial leave to possess has been granted: Watts v Waller, [1972] 3 All E.R. 257, overruling Rutherford v Rutherford, (970o) I W.L.R. 1479. The incumbrance binds all third parties except purchasers whose purchase is completed before registration: schedule 3; Miles v Bull, [1969] 3 All E.R. 1585. Charges registered earlier prevail but the protected spouse may discharge them by any payment by which the other could have so done: sI (5). (In forfeiture proceedings on an earlier-registered mortgage the protected spouse has a right to be joined as a party on proof of sufficient funds to pay off the mortgagee but has no right to be informed of the proceedings: Hastings &amp; Thanet Building Soc. v Goddard, [1970o] 3 All E.R. 954, noted by Gareth Miller in (1971) 35 Conveyancer (n.s.) 332, at 340-4.) During the currency of the statutory rights either spouse may apply for a court order declaring, enforcing, restricting, terminating, or regulating the other's occupation (ss I(2), (3)), but a court cannot regulate the legal owner's rights by excluding him from occupation completely: Tarr v Tarr, [1972] 2 All E.R. 295.

While these were pending Mr Pettitt brought proceedings under s 17 of the Married Women's Property Act 18821' for a declaration that he was entitled to a beneficial interest in the money his wife had raised by selling the former matrimonial home, a cottage vested in her name, and for an order that she should pay him a proportion thereof commensurate with his interest. His claim was based on work which he had carried out and materials he had supplied in effecting physical improvements to the cottage which had enhanced its capital value: general internal decorations; the building of a wardrobe; the laying out of a lawn and patio in the garden; and the erection of an outside wall. At first instance the declaration was granted and Mrs Pettitt was ordered to pay her husband ?300. Her appeal to the Court of Appeal failed on the ground that the Court was bound by its own previous decision in Appleton v Appleton.'4 Her subsequent appeal to the House of Lords was based on the submission that this latter case had been wrongly decided since it had turned on an erroneous con- struction of MWPA s 17, according to which the court hearing an applica- tion thereunder had unfettered discretion to make whatever order in respect of the disputed property it considered fairest in the circumstances as they had developed down to the time of its adjudication. She contended that the court was bound, under s 17, to apply only general principles of property law and that, under these, her husband's claim should have failed since the cottage was vested in her sole name. II THE THREADS OF THE ARGUMENT A The scope of MWPA S 17 The primary object of the 1882 Act was to complete the process, begun by the Matrimonial Causes Act 1857 and continued by the MWPA 1870, of conferring on wives the capacity to acquire and dispose of property in their own right enjoyed by single women in late nineteenth-century England. In partial furtherance of this object s 17 provided: 'In any question be- tween husband and wife15 as to the title to or possession of property, either party ... may apply by summons ... in a summary way to any Judge of the 13 1882, c 75, hereinafter referred to as MWPA s 17, or s 17 14 (1965) I All E.R. 44 15 As amended by the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1970, s 2. S 17 proceedings are also available to either party to a terminated agreement to marry (rendered legally unenforceable under the act's principal provision) but must be instituted within three years of the termination. Under s 2, the same rules of property law govern property disputes between parties to such terminated agreements as apply in matrimonial causes disputes.</page><page sequence="6">INTER VIVOS MATRIMONIAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN ENGLAND 153 High Court of Justice'" ... or to the judge of the county court of the district ... in which either party resides17 ... and the judge ... may make such order with respect to the property in dispute as he thinks fit ...*'8 The section does not provide the only machinery for seizing the court of matrimonial property disputes. There is a variety of alternatives, including actions for breach of trust or breach of contract (when appropriate) or, most favoured when s 17 cannot be invoked, applications for a declaration I6 Before October I971, s 17 proceedings could be brought in the High Court in either the Queen's Bench, Chancery, or Divorce divisions. Pettitt was brought in the latter and was first tried by a divorce registrar. The Administration of Justice Act 1970 created a new Family Division of the High Court and under schedule I most matri- monial matters, including s 17 applications, were assigned to it. This change took effect in October 1971. The High Court was generally reorganized by the Courts Act 1971 and its hearings now take place in a number of towns outside London, as well as in the Strand, as specified in Practice Direction, [I971] 3 All E.R. 1367. 17 The cheaper and speedier procedure of county courts is generally restricted to claims below a certain amount but in matrimonial matters these courts now play a prominent role: A/ country courts have unlimited s 17 jurisdiction, save that the respondent may demand a transfer to the High Court if the value of the disputed property exceeds the current general county court jurisdictional limit. Moreover, the High Court may transfer a s 17 proceeding to a county court where desirable (as well as vice versa): Matrimonial Causes Rules 1971, supra note 6, rule Io4A, added by Matrimonial Causes (Amendment) Rules 1972 (s.I. 1972, no. o1095), rule o10; B/ county courts enjoy totally unlimited jurisdiction under the Matrimonial Homes Act 1967, supra note Io; c/ all matrimonial causes (divorce, nullity, and judicial separation suits) must be instituted in county courts. Those remaining or becoming undefended are tried by 'divorce county courts' designated by the Lord Chancellor (see Divorce County Courts Order I971 (s.I. 1971, no. 1954)), except those the retention of which in the High Court is thought desirable: Matrimonial Causes Act 1967, Matrimonial Causes Rules 971, rules 18(5) and 27. D/ Proceedings for ancillary relief under the Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Act 1970, supra note 4, are generally disposed of by the court in which the matrimonial cause is pending: Matri- monial Causes Rules 1971, rules 68 and 77-9. But (i) so long as the respondent has not raised a matter by way of defence to the main suit he can use it to defend the ancillary proceedings: Tumath v Tumath, [197o] 1 All E.R. III; Porter v Porter, [I97i] 2 All E.R. 1037. (The same principle enables the respondent to oppose the petition in the main cause on the grounds of grave financial hardship (see supra note 3) by asserting facts not raised in any earlier proceedings between the parties regard- ing the grant of the divorce decree or financial support orders: Rule v Rule, [197 1] 3 All E.R. 1368); (ii) the High Court has wide discretion to transfer ancillary relief proceedings to a county court (as well as vice versa): Matrimonial Causes Rules 1971, rules 8o and 81, as amended by Matrimonial Causes (Amendment) Rules 1972, rule 7. E/ Proceedings pending in the High Court Family Division's principal registry in London are treated as pending in a divorce county court for certain pur- poses under Matrimonial Causes Rules 1971, rule 4, but the registry's function in this regard are in turn exercisable in any Greater London county court: Practice Notice, [1972] I W.L.R. 324. There is one general qualification to the role of county courts in matrimonial matters: the High Court may assume jurisdiction over any such matter pending in a county court on any ground upon which the county court could have transferred it thereto: Matrimonial Causes Rules 1971, rule o4B, added by Matri- monial Causes (Amendment) Rules I972, rule io; 1971 Rules, rule 12o, as amended by 1972 Amendment Rules, rule I i. 18 A respondent to a s 17 application cannot be denied the right to defend it and judgment in default of defence cannot therefore be entered: Isaac v Isaac, [1972] 2 All E.R. I I69.</page><page sequence="7">154 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL of property rights and consequential orders."9 Moreover, s 17 proceedings are only available while the marriage is subsisting or within three years of its dissolution or annulment.20 But in practice most property disputes do arise within this period, and s i7 provides the speediest and cheapest pro- cedure for seizing the court of these, one which can conveniently be com- bined with the maintenance and custody proceedings ancillary to any matri- monial cause21 and which results in a hearing in the informal private atmosphere of chambers. Its popularity is reflected in the current level of applications - about 900 per year22 - and it is this popularity which made an authoritative interpretation23 of the section by the House significant. The House held that the procedural advantages of the section were its sole object. The actual adjudication as to the existence and size of the spouses' interests in the disputed property must be based on general property law as applicable to similar disputes brought before the courts under the alternative procedures. The court, having declared the existing rights in the property - which it must do by reference solely to the circumstances of and surrounding its acquisition from the previous owner - has no jurisdiction to vary these to produce what it considers to be a fair settlement in the light of the sub- sequent circumstances. Unfortunately, while the House did recognize that the words 'as he thinks fit' in the section were, in Lord Morris' phrase, 'undoubtedly words which give a judicial discretion' (393F) it failed to define the nature and scope of this discretion. It would appear from a later passage in Lord Morris' judgment and from those of Lords Hodson (40 IF-H) and Diplock (4I11 H) that it is a discretion as to remedies, whereby a court dealing with an application under s 17 could refuse to make such orders in favour of a spouse held to have exclusive rights in the disputed property as would be necessary if those I9 Schedule I to the Administration of Justice Act 1970, supra note I6, assigns certain specified declaration proceedings to the Family Division but not proceedings for declarations of rights in matrimonial property. It appears that these continue to be the domain of the Chancery Division. 2o This three-year period was introduced by s 39 of the Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Act, supra note 4. 21 Before I October 1972 it was possible for s I7 proceedings to be brought in a different forum from that in which the matrimonial cause was pending. Lord Denning stressed the desirability of bringing all matters arising out of the main suit before the same court in Gissing v Gissing, [1969] I All E.R. 1043, at 1o45, and this was confirmed by a Practice Direction, [1971] I All E.R. 895, calling on courts to exercise their powers of transferring forum in order to seise the same court of all such matters. Despite the creation of the new Family Division, it is still possible for a matrimonial property dispute initially to come before a court other than that in which the matrimonial cause is pending (see note 19 for a possible example), and therefore the Practice Direction still seems relevant. 22 See Pettitt, supra note 12, at 3991 and 4 10o. 23 The House in fact confirmed what it had said about s 17 obiter in Ainsworth, supra note 9, and in so doing it made a holding as to the nature of the powers conferred by s 17 similar to that handed down by the Canadian Supreme Court in Thompson v Thompson, (1961) s.c.R. 3 with regard to the effect of s 12 of The Married Women's Property Act, R.s.o. 1950, c 223, in force in Ontario.</page><page sequence="8">INTER VIVOS MATRIMONIAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN ENGLAND 155 rights were to be effectively enjoyed as against the other. The illustration provided by Lord Hodson was the case of Wilson v Wilson, where the court refused to grant to a husband an order ejecting his wife from the home in which she had no proprietary rights.24 If this is the correct analysis of the discretion conferred by s 17, two ques- tions arise. First, is it a discretion to provide a spouse with no interest in the disputed property, or an interest subservient to the other's, with a shield 24 [1963] 2 All E.R. 447. The question of eviction from the home can arise in two con- texts: (i) Where the owner seeks to exclude the non-owner: (A) In respect of a period during which the spouses were both in occupation the courts will not recognise the owner's rights to treat the other as a trespasser without judicial leave, and will not give effect to any attempted eviction even when a trespass remedy is retrospectively sought after a marital breakdown for which the non-owner is responsible: Morris v Tarrant, [i971] 2 All E.R. 920 (although general trespass law applies to property other than the matrimonial home: Jolliffe v Willmett &amp; Co., [197I1] All E.R. 478); (B) if the owner seeks to obtain exclusive possession under s 17 he may well fail: Wilson shows this, and in Halden v Halden, [1966] 3 All E.R. 412, a wife's s 17 application for an injunction against a sale by a husband in desertion succeeded because he refused to undertake the provision of suitable alternative accommodation; (c) if the non- owner enjoys occupation rights under the Matrimonial Homes Act I967, supra note Io, enacted after Wilson and Halden, the onus falls on the owner to apply for an eviction order thereunder, to which application Halden would appear applicable in principle. Proceedings under s 17 and the 1967 Act are now frequently combined, and although appeals under the latter do not go directly to the Court of Appeal whereas those under the former do, this can be circumvented by an order transferring forum: Tinker v Tinker, [1970] 3 All E.R. 958; Practice Direction, supra note 2I; (D) if the non- owner has an equitable interest in the home, a statutory trust for sale will arise (infra page I68ff) and the owner may have to seek a judicial sale order. Again, the applica- tion will be governed by the Halden principle, as cases directly in point (infra note 29) indicate. Moreover, the non-owner's equitable interest will not now preclude protec- tion under the Matrimonial Homes Act 1967, by virtue of s 38 of the Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Act 970, supra note 4. (2) Where the non-owner seeks to exclude the owner: (A) Gurasz, supra note Io, holds that the court may enforce the non-owners in personam right to occupation by excluding an owner whose conduct has made it impossible for peaceful cohabitation to continue; (B) in Stewart v Stewart, (1972) 3 W.L.R. 907, dicta in Gurasz were adopted to support a holding that the court had jurisdiction to order the husband, though sole owner of the home, to leave it after divorce in order to protect the children of the marriage against homelessness, and that it also had jurisdiction to commit him for contempt of court when he failed to fulfil an undertaking to leave the home previously given to the court; (c) But Tarr, supra note Io, holds that the court can- not exclude the owner under the Matrimonial Homes Act i967, and this effectively means that where a wife is beyond that act's protection because she has legal co- ownership of the home (as in Gurasz) she is better protected than when she is dependent on the I967 act for protection of her occupation; (D) an owner may be excluded by means of an order extinguishing any property rights which would carry occupation rights with them, made under s 4 of the Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Act 1970, as is illustrated by White v White, infra note 124; (E) divorce courts have inherent jurisdiction to order a spouse to leave the home pending the hearing of a matrimonial cause, even if he or she owns it, when peaceful cohabitation has become impossible: Jones v Jones, (1971) I W.L.R. 396; Hall v Hall, ibid 4o04. See, further, Burnfield, (1972) 122 New L.J. 729 on the general topic of exclusion from the home. As another example of the assertion of a discretion as to remedies see Samson v Samson, [I 960] I All E.R. 653, where it was suggested that the court could refuse, under s 17, to order the return of wedding presents to a spouse adjudged entitled to them thereunder in order to avoid injustice.</page><page sequence="9">156 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL with which to resist the enjoyment by the other of his or her rights, or does it also enable the court to provide the former with a sword for use against the latter in the form of relief positively preventing the exercise of the latter's rights? Lord Hodson referred to Shipman v Shipman,25 where a wife ob- tained an injunction restraining the husband, the sole owner of the matri- monial home, from entering it, but examination of that decision reveals that it was the husband's marital rights which the court wished to bar by its order and it is therefore not helpful in determining the extent of the court's power to impede his proprietary rights in cases where there is no justification for restraining him from having any personal dealings with his wife.26 Secondly, what is the scope of the discretion in a case where a spouse has already obtained an adjudication, in previous proceedings, that he or she is entitled to exclusive rights in matrimonial property, and that spouse brings subsequent proceedings under s 17 to obtain orders against the other giving effect to those rights? If the application is refused in a case where it seeks solely enforcement orders it will have totally failed and the applicant will have to bear the costs of it although his enforcible right is already estab- lished, a result which could be avoided by invoking one of the procedures alternative to s 17 and therefore one which points to a marked contrast between s 17 and its alternatives of the very kind the House was anxious to avoid. B The acquisition of property rights from a third party Lord Upjohn emphasized that in the case of real property there must at one time have been a deed conveying it to whichever of the spouses initially acquired it from a third party.27 If that deed were silent as to the existence of beneficial interests in the property conveyed, these would be coextensive with legal title and would therefore be vested solely in the spouse in whom the title was vested by the deed, but if the deed declared beneficial interests to have been created in the property thereby, additional to or inconsistent with those inherent in legal title - for instance, if it constituted the trans- feree trustee for both spouses - that declaration would be conclusive as to the nature and extent of the beneficial interests in the property provided it was not executed as a result of fraud or mistake. Lord Upjohn's remarks were subsequently applied by Goff j in Re John's Assignment Trusts, in which the parties had been tenants of certain premises under a deed assigning the lease thereof to them. The deed pro- 25 (1924) 2 Ch. 140 26 Provided a matrimonial suit is pending the courts can impede the exercise of a spouse's marital rights by a non-molestation injunction: Rayden Divorce (ixth ed) 835-9. But outside s I 7, injunctions can be used to impede the enjoyment of property rights. This is shown by the cases enjoining eviction and sale, supra note 24, and the court can restrain a disposition of property intended to defeat pending proceedings for financial support under the Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Act 1970, s 16. 27 (405 I).

The wife claimed, inter alia, that by reason of that pro- vision both spouses jointly held the property under a trust for sale in favour of themselves in accordance with LPA s 36,28 that under that trust the hus- band was bound to join with her in a sale if, as was the case, she was un- willing to concur in the exercise of the power conferred by LPA s 25 to post- pone sale under such a trust, that he should be ordered so to join and that the net proceeds of sale should be paid into a joint account.29 Goff j held that in principle he could not go behind the express declaration of bene- undoubtedly had been to create a trust for sale under which the spouses ficial interests contained in the deed of assignment, the effect of which had equal beneficial interests. He did, however, appear to qualify Lord Upjohn's judgment by indicating that if there was evidence that the spouses had not intended this to be the deed's effect the court could have disregarded the express declarations therein even if the existence of a contrary intention did not technically vitiate the deed on the ground of mistake. On the evi- dence, however, the existence of equal beneficial interests was held to accord with the intentions they had probably entertained when the deed was executed. The arguments that the deed had been vitiated by mistake because the husband had not appreciated the full effect of the declaration therein was rejected because it was a proper inference from the evidence that he had received competent legal advice prior to execution. Whether the judge would have held, had that not been so, that the submission based on 'mis- take' in the technical sense was sound is not clear, for he expressly declined to decide whether by 'mistake,' in this context, Lord Upjohn had intended to invoke the narrow common law sense of that term - according to which, 28 Re John's Assignment Trusts, [1970] 2 All E.R. 210. Under LPA, s 36 most cases of legal joint ownership of realty give rise to a trust for sale, the terms of which are defined by s 35. See further infra page I68ff. 29 Consent to the exercise of the power to postpone sale must be unanimous, otherwise the trustees are bound to sell forthwith: Re Mayo, (1943) Ch. 302. The court has power to order sale under LPA, s 3o. The primary purpose of a trust for sale is normally sale, from which derives the doctrine of the notional conversion of the trust property into personalty from the time the trust arises: Snell Principles of Equity (26th ed) part v, chapter I; Hanbury, Modern Equity (9th ed) chapter 28; Irani Finance Ltd v Singh, [I97o] 3 All E.R. 199. But when the trust property is a matrimonial home the primary purpose is deferred and the court will not order sale under LPA, s 30 until the marriage has in substance broken down: Jones v Challenger, (I96I) I Q.. 176; Rawlings v Rawlings, [1964] 2 All E.R. 804. Even then, no order will be made at the suit of a husband who refuses to undertake to provide his wife with alternative accommodation: In re Hardy's Trust, (197o) II4 Sol.J. 864. But an order will be made when the cost to the husband of refusing the order would exceed the amount of any maintenance a court would order him to pay on judicial termination of the marriage: Jackson v Jackson, [197o] 3 All E.R. 854. It may also be made when the wife's conduct substantially contributed to the breakdown of the marriage, although every case involves a matter of discretion dependent on the particular facts: Jackson v Jackson, [1971] 3 All E.R. 774, noted by Smith in (1972) 30 Cambridge L.J. 39 and fully analysed by Gareth Miller in (1972) 36 Conveyancer (n.s.) 99.</page><page sequence="11">158 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL it is submitted, the deed would have been valid - or the wider equitable meaning, according to which it would probably have been voidable and consideration would have been necessary of the question whether the hus- band had avoided or affirmed it.30 It could prove highly significant for future cases which of these meanings is the correct one in this context, for one can readily envisage a situation in which one spouse will consent to a deed providing for a joint tenancy with the other, understanding its basic nature - a transfer of property to them both - but not appreciating that by virtue of its provisions they will acquire separate equal interests in it. In such a situation the deed might well be held voidable in equity though valid at common law. By the same token it is important to determine whether 'fraud' in this context is limited to common law fraud - intended deception - or extends to equitable fraud in its wide sense of unconscionable behaviour.31 c The creation of property rights by the spouses inter se I Conveyances and transfers governed by general property law Where the conveyance from the third party was silent as to beneficial inter- ests these will in general follow legal title, so that if the property was vested in both co-ownership arises, whereas if it was vested in only one then the other will not, without more, have any interest in it.32 In the latter situation, however, dearly it is open to the owner to transfer the property de novo to the other or confer interests in it on the other under the general procedures for the transfer or creation of property rights. In the case of realty these include outright conveyance to the other by deed, reconveyance to them both as co- owners, the construction of an express trust, a declaration of trust,33 or conveyance to third party trustees. However, it is but rarely that one spouse, having become absolute owner of realty, will adopt any such procedure, since it is but rarely - as is stressed throughout Pettitt and Gissing - that spouses consciously think about their inter vivos rights in it once it has been 30 On 'mistake' in law and equity see: Chitty on Contracts, (23rd ed), vol.

The issue under discussion in this sec- tion is whether a spouse can acquire proprietary interests in property vested in the other by the previous owner and in relation to which these general procedures have not been invoked between the spouses. 2 Contracts between spouses i The proprietary effects of contracts Their lordships, in considering in what circumstances the non-owning spouse will have acquired a beneficial interest in the other's property, revealed an important dispute over the priority of two competing doctrines: the common law doctrine of contract and the equitable doctrine of resulting trust and advancement. Before con- sidering their lordships' views in detail it is essential to examine the extent to which these doctrines are competing. The distinction between contract and trust is a distinction between rights in rem and rights in personam which can easily become blurred for three reasons. First, in the case of personality the contract creating the obligation to transfer rights therein can, depending upon the parties' intentions and the nature and extent of the property, itself operate as a conveyance of those rights. Secondly, trusts are sometimes brought into existence in ful- filment of contractual obligations. Thirdly, in the case of realty, the contract itself constitutes the vendor a kind of trustee of the property for the vendee until the former executes the deed of conveyance which, as has been men- tioned, is the only procedure by which the legal title can be transferred. Nevertheless, the distinction is a real and important one. In the first situation, 34 Perhaps the most likely situation arises where a husband transfers the home to the wife to keep it out of the hand of his creditors. Any creditor can impugn the transfer by showing intention to defraud and if the husband goes bankrupt his trustee in bankruptcy can impugn it without showing such intention: LPA S 172 and Bankruptcy Act 1914, s 42. See Snell, supra note 29, at 14o-7 and Re Eicholz, [1959] I All E.R. I66. As against the wife it will be valid, though, since the husband cannot plead his real intention so as to rebut the presumption of advancement (discussed infra I7off below) : Tinker v Tinker, [I970] I All E.R. 540o. 35 If a document is used to transfer title to chattels remaining in a transferor's possession it is void against creditors unless registered under the Bills of Sales Acts 1878 and 1882, but as between spouses possession necessarily shifts to the transferee: French v Gething, (1922) 1 K.B. 236. See Thornely, (1953), I 1 Cambridge L.J. 355. 36 A matrimonial chattel, however bulky, cannot be transferred merely by words of transfer. There must be some kind of physical delivery by the owner coupled with the intention to transfer thereby: Re Cole, (1964) Ch 175. Cf Glaister-Carlisle v Glaister- Carlisle, (1968) I12 Sol.J. 215. See, further, Thornely, supra note 35, and (1964) 22 Cambridge L.J. 27.</page><page sequence="13">160 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL even when the contract does operate as the conveyance,37 pending delivery of the property by the vendor to the vendee the former is not a trustee thereof for the latter. If he fails to deliver the vendee will seldom be able to obtain from the court an order compelling him to do so.38 If he goes bankrupt before delivery, having retained possession of the property, it will become available for distribution amongst his creditors.39 If he purports to sell it to a bona fide third party the latter may acquire good title to it.40 If the contract does not itself operate as the conveyance, then some further act or occurrence is required before title passes. Until it occurs the vendee has no property rights; if what is required is an act by the vendor, the vendee will probably be unable to obtain a court order compelling the vendor to perform it,41 and once it is performed the vendee is in the same position pending delivery as he would have been in had he become owner under the contract. In the second situation it is only when the legal title to the property in question has been effectively vested in the trustee in accordance with the appropriate conveyancing procedure that the trust is completely constituted and the beneficiary acquires the full complement of rights accru- ing to a cestui que trust. Until then, his right to compel the perfection of the trust is qualified by its dependence upon certain factors: upon his general right to obtain specific performance of the contract, upon con- sideration having moved from him,42 natural love and affection and the rigorous observance of all marital obligations being insufficient for this pur- pose,43 in the case of realty, upon the promisor having recorded his promise in writing or upon the promisee having part-performed his side of the bargain.4 In the third situation, the trust does not confer upon the vendee all the rights normally enjoyed by a cestui que trust45 and those which it does confer are, again, dependent upon the promise being enforceable, and thus upon the presence of consideration, the availability of specific perform- 37 The circumstances in which this occurs are set out in The Sale of Goods Act 1893, ss 17-19. See Atiyah, Sale of Goods (4th ed) at 16 and chapter 17; 2 Chitty, supra note 30, paras 1519-38. The courts apply sale of goods principles, by analogy, to contracts which are not technically covered by the 1893 act, such as exchange contracts. 38 It depends on the uniqueness of the property to the particular vendee: Cohen v Roche, (1927) I K.B. 169; 2 Chitty, supra note 30, para 1634. 39 Bankruptcy Act 1914, s 38(2).

Thus although a trust may arise in pursuance of a contract or as a result of the existence of the contract, the contract as such is a device for trans- ferring rights in rem of limited utility. Apart from the conceptual distinction between trust and contract,46 there are numerous practical ways in which the beneficiary under a trust enjoys rights which are not generated by a con- tract. The trustee owes fiduciary duties of care to him in respect of the trust property. If he is in fraudulent breach of these no period of limitation will bar a claim against him,47 whereas all breaches of contract are time- barred after 6 (or, in the case of contracts under seal, 12) years from the date of the breach or, if it was fraudulent, from the date when it first was or could reasonably have been discovered.48 If a third party knowingly implicates himself in a trustee's breach of duty he will generally be liable to account to the beneficiary under a constructive trust for the profit he has made from that implication,49 whereas a stranger to a contract only becomes liable to one party to it for breach thereof by another party within the nar- rowly defined torts of conspiracy, intimidation, and inducement of breach of contract, the remedy for which is limited to the recovery in damages of the innocent party's own loss."5 If the trust is completely constituted - and both constructive and resulting trusts are necessarily so, otherwise they would not achieve their purpose - the beneficiary enjoys a right in rem enforceable with the aid of all equity's remedies irrespective of the absence of consideration."5 This right is enforceable against all third parties except bona fide purchasers of the trust property without notice of its existence52 or purchasers whose purchase 'overreaches' the right."5 Rights under a con- tract to transfer a proprietary interest are similarly enforceable but only if 46 See Re West Sussex Constabulary's Trust, [1970o] All E.R. 544 at 548h per Goff j; Cretney, (1969) 32 Modern L.R. 570; Graveson, Status in the Common Law (1953) 129 ff. 47 Limitation Act 1939, s 19 48 Ibid, ss 2, 26 49 See: Pettit, supra note 8, at chapter 4; Parker and Mellows, ibid, at chapter 7; Hanbury, supra note 29, at chapter 13; Boardman v Phipps, [1966] 3 All E.R. 721; Selangor United Rubber v Cradock, [1968] 2 All E.R.

Whereas rights under such a contract are not enforce- able against the trustee in bankruptcy of the party who is bound to - but has not - conferred them, trust property is not divisible among the trustee's creditors in the event of his bankruptcy."5 And finally, a person who has contracted to transfer his property to another or confer interests in it on another is entitled to retain all mesne profits accruing from the property until it is performed whereas under a trust a beneficiary would acquire an interest in them proportionate to the size of, and calculated from the date of creation of, his equitable interest in the property.56 In a matrimonial property dispute, therefore, in which the court has the options of determining the spouses' property rights solely by reference to any contract between them or of applying trust doctrines - in particular, in a case where there is no express contract such as might have a limited proprietary effect under the principles discussed above - the choice it makes has a substantial bearing on the existence and extent of those property rights. ii Express contracts The particular difficulty that arises in connection with express contracts between spouses is the scope of the Court of Appeal's decision in Balfour v Balfour"7 that there is a presumption that domestic agreements between them are not intended to have contractual force. Lord Reid considered (39IA) that while that decision was correct in regard to non-financial agreements it must be qualified in cases of financial ones: if both parties have performed in full their respective obligations under such an agreement there is no presumption that the legal conse- quences of reciprocal performance, as agreed between them, should not flow. Lord Diplock drew no distinction between financial and non-financial agreements but supported (413) that drawn in Balfour itself between domestic and non-domestic ones, a distinction not necessarily coextensive with that between financial and non-financial agreements since a mainte- nance agreement like that in Balfour might be regarded as both domestic - 54 Once a purchaser has completed his purchase he is bound by registered charges whether he actually knew about them when making the contract or not, but he can rescind the contract before then for non-disclosure of them: LPA 1925, s 198; LPA 1969, s 24 (I am indebted to Mr Paul Fairest of Selwyn College, Cambridge, for elucidation on this point).

How- ever, Lord Diplock was ad idem with Lord Reid on the further distinction between executed and executory obligations (413D-E). It is not clear how this distinction could affect the bulk of matrimonial property disputes, in which one spouse claims that she or he is entitled to an interest in the other's property where no such interest has been formally conferred, for in claiming the interest the claimant is in effect asking the court to produce the result that would have flowed if the other had performed a promise to confer it which is as yet unperformed. The distinction between executory and executed obligations does not appear in the other judgments. Lord Hodson limited the presumption against contractual intention to agreements made 'in the ordinary course of domestic life' (400ooc), and with Lord Upjohn (4o8c) indicated that it does not apply to agreements about proprietary interests, at least not those with a substantial financial value. Thus, if Pettitt is to be regarded as a leading authority on the question of contractual intention in agreements between spouses, difficulties as to the kinds of agreements to which the presumption applies and the effects of its application must be resolved. If, on the other hand, it is regarded as merely one in a long line of cases instancing the application of the presumption the need to attempt to reconcile their lordships' views is avoided. It is little wonder, therefore, that the Court of Appeal has continued to regard its own decision in Balfour as the leading authority on the question and has rele- gated Pettitt to the status of illustration thereof. In Gould v Gould"5 it held that a husband's oral promise to pay his wife ?k15 per week so long as he could manage it was unenforceable; although the spouses had separated when it was made, so that the amity from which the presumption in Balfour was derived had ceased, the promise was of such uncertain application as to be inconsistent with any contractual intention. Lord Denning considered, in Merritt v Merritt,59 that, but for this uncertainty, the Court would have held Mr Gould bound on the principle that once normal cohabitation has ceased reasonable spouses do intend their domestic agreements to be binding in order that their respective legal obligations, as defined by those agree- ments, are settled beyond doubt. Accordingly, such an intention will be imputed to them unless there is evidence to the contrary. His Lordship explained that, whereas in Gould the majority had considered that the un- certainty of the promise had been evidence to the contrary, he had not, which is why he had dissented. In Merritt there was no room for such dis- agreement since the husband had recorded on paper his unequivocal promise to pay the wife ?40 per month and to transfer the matrimonial home to her if she paid off the mortgage with the help of his monthly maintenance. In neither of these cases was doubt cast on, or qualifications expressed about, the principle enunciated in Balfour and the only references to Pettitt were 58 [1969] 3 All E.R. 728 59 [1970] 2 All E.R. 760</page><page sequence="17">164 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL those - to Lord Hodson's judgment - made in Gould to support what Balfour had laid down. In addition to leaving unanswered the question, arising from Pettitt, of the effect of performance by both spouses of an agreement between them, these two subsequent cases raise an important problem: whether, in cases involving agreements between separating or separated spouses, the spouse relying on the agreement has to prove contractual intention as part of his case if the other party puts him to proof of it or whether it is for the latter to disprove that intention."6 This depends upon whether, in such cases, there is a counter-presumption to that laid down in Balfour - as Lord Den- ning suggested in MAerritt - or whether, as seems to have been the view of Edmund Davies and Megaw LJJ in Gould and of Widgery and Karminski LJJ in Merritt, these are merely cases where the presumption laid down in Balfour does not itself apply but where the general burden resting on a party relying on a contract to prove all its constituents if called on to do so by the other is not itself positively lightened. iii Inferred and imputed contracts Two opposing views of the court's role in dealing with allegations of contractual agreements between spouses emerge from the judgments in Pettitt. On the first view, the court's juris- diction to inquiry fully into all the evidence and to make inferences there- from means that it is not restricted to the words of agreement articulated by the spouses but it can only spell out an agreement where the conduct of the spouses justifies the inference that they actually made such an agree- ment. On this view Jansen v Jansen"6 was wrongly decided because there the husband was held to have acquired an interest in his wife's house al- though negotiations between the spouses for the formal conveyance by her to him of such an interest broke down, so that no actual agreement was ever reached. This was Lord Hodson's view (41oc). On the second view, even where the evidence fails to point to an express or inferred agreement between the spouses, it is open to the court to determine what the spouses would have agreed as to their respective rights in the disputed property if they had made some agreement. If it concludes that reasonable people in their position would have agreed that the non-owner should acquire cer- tain rights in it and that there is no evidence to show that these particular spouses would not have so agreed, then it can impute such an agreement to them and give effect to it. All their lordships agreed that the court could act upon inferred agreements but there was discord as to its power to impute them. Lord Reid, supporting the imputed contract approach (391IE), held that it would avoid the 'entirely unsatisfactory' distinction which would operate 60o Or at least to adduce prima facie evidence to disprove it so as to cast a burden of calling evidence to prove it on to the other. Cf the operation of the presumption of advancement discussed below, page 170 ff. 61 [19651 3 All E.R. 363. The terminology of 'inferred' and 'imputed' contracts employed in this article are mine since the House did not use consistent wording.</page><page sequence="18">INTER VIVOS MATRIMONIAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN ENGLAND 165 under traditional doctrine (by which, as will be seen, he must be taken to have meant the equitable doctrines of resulting trust and advancement) between the spouse who makes a direct contribution to the fund of money used by the other to pay for the disputed property - who would thereby acquire an interest in it - and the spouses who make a general contribution to the family's finances or physically improve the other's property, neither of whom would thereby acquire such an interest. In Lord Reid's opinion, in the absence of any actual agreement, whether any of these spouses acquires such an interest would be decided by applying to the facts of the case the same test: would reasonable persons in the parties' position have agreed that the claimant to the interest should receive it if they had consciously considered their rights in the disputed property at the time when it was acquired? His lordship acknowledged that to use this test would be to sub- stitute a new approach for that previously adopted by the courts. It is sub- mitted that this substitution would be of contract for trust. The same substitution would occur if Lord Diplock's views were applied, as he himself admitted (415c), for his lordship was ad idem with Lord Reid that in cases where the evidence shows that the spouses formed no common intention about their property rights inter se the court can impute to them the intention which it thinks reasonable people in their position would have formed. The 'familiar legal technique' (41i3H) of the imputed contract applied as much to the matrimonial as to commercial relationships. How- ever, it is submitted that the application of this technique to the matrimonial relationship necessarily involves its extension. What this technique has hither- to been used to impute is an intention that particular terms should be in- cluded in a contract the actual formation of which is not doubted,62 whereas Lord Diplock advocated its use as the basis for the court's imputation of the very existence of the contract as well as its terms. Such a use would have to be kept in tight rein, for if it be right that normal spouses do not make actual contracts about their property rights and that, for this very reason, the presumption laid down in Balfour is valid to some extent - which his lordship accepted - and if it also be right that, as has been submitted, where the court acts upon a contract between the spouses in pursuance of which no convey- ance has been executed, it is in substance enforcing executory obligations thereunder, then when the court imputes contracts to those spouses it is fixing on them outstanding legal rights and duties which the House accepted they would probably not have provided for if they had thought about the matter. A further difficulty which Lord Diplock acknowledged as arising from his approach (41I5D) was the relation between it and the wide construction 62 The imputed term approach has become best-known as 'the officious bystander test' from the words of Mackinnon LJ in Shirlaw v Southern Foundries, [1939] 2 All E.R. at 124. This is how Lord Diplock described it (at 415F), but this test has generally been strictly applied: see Spring v N.A.S.D.S., [1956] 2 All E.R. 221.</page><page sequence="19">166 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL of MWPA S 17 rejected by the House. The argument appears to have been canvassed by Mrs Pettitt's counsel that courts left free to impute a con- tractual relationship to spouses irrespective of their actual intention would be enjoying in another guise the unfettered discretion which did not exist as such under s 17. Indeed, Lord Denning's view in Appleton"3 had been that it was pointless for the court to decide matrimonial property disputes on the basis of any bargain between the spouses precisely because, so long as they live together in amity, they do not make such bargains and for that very reason the only possible criterion for resolving their subsequent property disputes was the court's own view of what would provide a just settlement in the light of the breakdown of the marriage."4 Lord Diplock rejected the argument that his approach would itself involve the use of this criterion (41 5E-I), reasoning that his approach depended on the court's view of what the parties would probably have agreed at the time the disputed property was acquired, so that the history of the marriage subsequent thereto, taken into account on Lord Denning's argument, became wholly irrelevant. It is re- spectfully submitted, however, that this is a somewhat artificial distinction between Lord Denning's views and his own. Lord Diplock accepted Lord Radcliffe's well-known proposition that, when a court imputes an intention to the parties before it on the basis of what reasonable people in their posi- tion would probably have intended, it is in fact acting on its own view of justice since the reasonable man is no more than the anthropomorphic mani- festation of that justice.' Since the court is unlikely to have a different view of the justice of the case when speaking for the reasonable man under Lord Diplock's approach than when speaking for itself under Lord Denning's, the only practical distinction between the two is the time at which reason- ableness has to be tested. This affects the extent to which justice can be applied as a criterion but not its inherent appropriateness as such a criterion. Moreover, in arguing for that appropriateness in all matrimonial property disputes, not just those under s 17, Lord Diplock's view would enlarge the area in which judicial discretion is to influence the outcome of such disputes. The judgments of Lords Morris (398D) and Hodson (403D) support this argument that the imputed contract approach is not wholly inconsistent with Lord Denning's liberal construction of s 17. Both rejected the former precisely because it was inconsistent with the correct interpretation of the section: if the court is unable to deduce from the evidence any express or inferred agree- ment in favour of the claimant then it cannot uphold the claim on the basis of some agreement not disclosed by the evidence. Since Lord Upjohn, as will be seen, preferred equitable doctrine to that of common law, and thus sub silentio rejected the imputed contract approach too, it is not surprising that 63 Supra note 14 64 It has been suggested in (1969) 26 Cambridge L.J. at 82 that the ratio of Appleton was that there was an agreement between the spouses but it is submitted that Lord Denning's judgment, taken as a whole, belies this. 65 See per Lord Radcliffe in Davis Contractors v Fareham U.D.C., [1956] 2 All E.R. 145 at I6o and note Atiyah, Accidents, Compensation and the Law (1970) at 96.</page><page sequence="20">INTER VIVOS MATRIMONIAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN ENGLAND 167 at least one divorce registrar should have found it '... rather amazing that Lord Diplock did not dissent ...'66 iv Non-contractual agreements In view of the approach adopted by the House in Gissing, it is important to note that in Pettitt four of their lordships considered the methods by which the court was to ascertain the spouses' common intention at the time of the acquisition of the disputed property in order to determine what contractual relationship, if any, subsisted between them in respect thereof.67 An informal agreement, not made with contractual intention and, neither supported by consideration nor made under seal, can have, qua agreement, no proprietary effect.6" As has been mentioned, such limited rights in rem as do flow from an agreement to confer a proprietory interest depend upon the enforceability of that agreement qua contract. If the agreement is to be relevant on the basis of trust, however, as Gissing establishes that it is, then the technical differences between contracts and other forms of consensual arrangement cease to have any significant prac- tical effect."9 3 The operation of equitable principles i The principles under review Certain doctrines which might have featured in their lordships' general review of the principles applicable to matrimonial property disputes received little or no attention and can be briefly dealt with. Lord Reid denied (3901) that one spouse, by improving the other's property, can acquire an interest in it under the doctrine of unjust enrich- ment70 since that doctrine only conferred a right in personam to monetary recompense. Lord Upjohn denied (409H) that the improver could acquire a right in rem under the doctrine of proprietary estoppeln7 except where the improvement is effected in reliance upon an express promise by the owner of the property to confer an interest in it in return for the improvement. The House did not consider whether one spouse could acquire an interest in the other's property, having improved it, in the form of an equitable lien there- on,n and might be thought to have rejected the suggestion that such a lien would arise sub silentio and by analogy with the unjust enrichment argument. The doctrines with which the House was concerned in detail were those of 66 Per Registrar Stranger-Jones in Colborne v Colborne, 15 June 1970 (unreported). Since Lord Upjohn expressly rejected the imputation to the spouses of any agreement not actually made by them (at 408D) he could be said to have rejected the imputation of such an agreement qua contract expressly. 67 Lord Reid (at 390); Lord Morris (at 398A); Lord Hodson (at 403D) ; Lord Diplock (at 413) 68 Except a negative one: to preclude the court from applying presumptions of intention under which property rights would be acquired. 69 For a pre-Gissing example of reliance on a non-contractual agreement under the resulting trust doctrine see Chapman v Chapman, [1969] 3 All E.R. 476 at 478 per Edmund Davies LJ. 70 See Goff and Jones, supra note 5o, at I 1-16. 71 See Snell and Hanbury, supra note 29, at 629 and 679 respectively; Crane, (1967) 31 The Conveyancer (n.s.) 332. 72 See Snell, supra note 29, at 493; Tiley, (1969) 26 Cambridge L.J. 8o, at 95.</page><page sequence="21">168 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL the resulting trust arising from contributions towards the acquisition of property, the presumption of advancement and the maximum 'equality is equity.'73 The Chancery courts have since their inception sought to prevent the intention of parties as to their proprietary rights being defeated by the legal technicalities and conveyancing procedures of the common law, and one of the principal weapons they developed to combat these technicalities and procedures was the resulting trust. In the context of the issues presently under review this weapon has been brandished in two ways. First, in cases where A, in the process of purchasing property with his own funds, has it conveyed into the name of another, B, equity will ensure that A retains the rights in it which he is presumed to have intended to retain by imposing a resulting trust in his favour: if the property is conveyed into B's sole name, B is presumed to hold it on trust for A and if it is conveyed into their joint names they are presumed to hold it jointly on trust for A alone.74 Secondly, in the case where both A and B put up money towards the pur- chase price of property, equity will ensure that both acquire the rights in it which they are presumed to have intended to acquire. If it is vested in one of them, he will hold it on resulting trust for them both: if their contri- butions were of equal size, they will be regarded as equitable joint tenants under the trust; if their contributions were unequal, they will be regarded as equitable tenants in common (the distinction being that under a joint tenancy each tenant is deemed to possess an indivisible inalienable share in the whole property, which share passes to the other on death under the 'right of survivorship,' whereas under a tenancy in common each is deemed to possess an undivided but quantifiable alienable share which devolves with his estate unless transferred by him during his lifetime). If the property is vested in them both, equity will not interfere with the proprietary conse- quences of legal joint ownership, including the 'right of survivorship,' where the contributions were equal, but if these were unequal the parties will be regarded as holding on resulting trust for themselves as equitable tenants in common in proportion to their contributions. These principles have been modified in the case of realty by the provisions of the Law of Property Act 1925 ss 34-6 regarding 'trusts for sale.'75 These provisions render absolute co-ownership of land at law an impossibility."7 Such co-ownership must 73 See, generally: Megarry and Wade, supra note 45, at chapter 7; Snell and Hanbury, supra note 29, at 19I-6 and 212-17 respectively; the material cited supra note 8. 74 Where the property has already been vested in A before the transfer to B, a resulting trust prima facie arises over personalty, but the parallel principle that operated with regard to realty under traditional equitable principles was reversed by LPA 1925, s 60(3). 75 For general discussion see: Bevan and Taylor, (1966) 30 Conveyancer (n.s.) 354, 438; Pritchard (i97i) Cambridge L.J. 44. 76 Absolute joint ownership at law is still possible in relation to personalty: see Vaines, Personal Property (4th ed), chapter 5.</page><page sequence="22">INTER VIVOS MATRIMONIAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN ENGLAND 169 give rise to a trust for sale, the terms of which are governed by s 35. The effect of the provisions appears to the writer as follows: where two parties have contributed equally to property vested in them both, and so would have been joint tenants at law before 1925, s 36 makes them joint tenants in equity under a trust for sale in respect of which they are both trustees; where the property is vested in them both but, because of the unequal nature of their contributions, a resulting trust would have arisen under traditional equitable principles, that trust still arises and the interests under it constitute undivided shares which also take effect under a trust for sale,77 where they have both contributed to property which is vested in only one of them, the equitable interests each would have acquired under resulting trust doctrine operate to give rise to a statutory trust for sale;78 special rules laid down for the statutory trust in the act apply whether or not a resulting trust would have arisen under traditional doctrine79 but that doctrine remains relevant to determine the nature and extent of the beneficial interests sub- sisting under the trust for sale where that doctrine would otherwise be applicable;s80 the provisions of the 1925 act apply to cases involving matri- monial realty to the same extent as they apply to other cases.81 77 The reasoning employed by Bull v Bull, (x1955) I Q.n. 234 and Barclay v Barclay, [x97o] 2 All E.R. 676 seems as follows: the parties enjoy undivided shares in the land by virtue of the resulting trust; s 34 (I) says such shares must take effect under a statutory trust for sale or as a 'strict settlement' under the Settled Land Act 1925; by virtue of the wording of s x of the latter act, it is clear that these undivided shares do not give rise to a 'strict settlement'; s 34(x) is absolute and can brook no lacunae; therefore a statutory trust for sale must have arisen. 78 It may be argued that this is because, since the parties hold equitable interests under a resulting trust, the property is 'beneficially limited to or held in trust for' them under the wording of s 36( ) even though it is they themselves who are 'holding it' in trust. Whether or not Lord Denning had this argument in mind in Jackson v Jackson, [x971i 3 All E.R. 774, supra note 29, is not clear but his lordship did state quite unequivocally that whenever one spouse holds the legal title to property in relation to which both spouses have equitable interests under resulting trust doctrine a statutory trust for sale arises under s 36 ( x ). 79 For instance, the rules that a trustee for sale must consult the wishes of a beneficiary with regard to sale and that at least two trustees are necessary to effect a sale: Waller v Waller, [x9671] All E.R. 305, applying LPA, SS 26(3) and 27(2). 8o The statutory trustees for sale are not necessarily all beneficiaries, they are not neces- sarily the only beneficiaries (as the cases in note 77 supra indicate), and the LPA does not predetermine whether the beneficiaries are joint tenants or tenants in com- mon in equity so that the distinction drawn under resulting trust doctrine between equal contributions to property vested in only one of the parties and unequal contri- butions to such property remains relevant (again, the cases in note 77 supra suggest this). 81 Thus, Lord Denning has said that the general rules apply where the property is a matrimonial home vested in both spouses and in respect of which both have acquired interests under a resulting trust: Grzeczkowski v Jedynska, (1971) 115 Sol. J. x26; he has also said the statutory trust for sale will arise where both spouses have contributed to a home vested in only one: Jackson, supra note 78; Waller, supra note 79, was a case where the sole legal owner held to be governed by trust for sale rules was a husband and the co-beneficiary his wife. Because of the presumption of advancement, discussed in the immediately following part of the text, a statutory trust for sale may arise in one case involving spouses when it would normally not do so: where property</page><page sequence="23">170 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL In the particular case of acquisition of legal ownership by spouses, the above principles are further modified by two special doctrines. The first is the presumption of advancement, under which the vesting in a wife of property acquired by her husband, instead of prima facie generating a result- ing trust in his favour, is presumed to operate as a gift to her. The general range of this presumption was considered in Re Eykyn's Trust82 and ampli- fied by Lord Upjohn in Pettitt (4o07 F-H) : A Where the husband has property, to the price of which the wife has made no contribution, vested in her, she is presumed absolute owner. If it is vested in them both they are presumed joint absolute owners. (In the case of realty they will hold on trust for sale for themselves as joint equitable tenants under LPA s 36.) If vested in her and a stranger, both will hold on resulting trust for her alone. (In the case of realty no trust for sale would appear to arise because the property is not beneficially limited to them both.) If vested in both and a stranger (the situation in Re Eykyn's Trust itself) all three will hold on resulting trust for the spouses as joint equitable tenants. (In the case of realty the joint equitable tenancy will subsist under a trust for sale under LPA s 36.) B Since the presumption does not operate in a husband's favour,s3 where a wife has property, to the price of which he has made no contribution, vested in them both or in him alone, prima facie a resulting trust arises as if they were strangers. According to Lord Upjohn this latter presump- tion will normally be rebutted by evidence that joint ownership was in fact intended. (In the case of realty vested in them both it would again appear that LPA s 36 does not apply because they are not both beneficially entitled to the property.) c Where they both contribute to the purchase price of property vested solely in the wife, the presumption applies, so that she is regarded prima facie as sole owner in law and equity. However, according to Lord Upjohn, unless the husband's contribution was very small the presumption will normally be rebutted on the evidence so that she will be regarded as hold- ing the property on resulting trust for them both, as equitable tenants in common in the case of unequal contributions (so that a trust for sale will arise in the case of realty under LPA s 34) or as equitable joint tenants purchased with A's funds alone is vested in B, then a resulting trust arises under general principles but only A has an equitable interest under it, so the property is not held in trust for them both for the purposes of LPA, s 36(I) (see note 78), but Lord Denning, when a first instance judge, suggested that where B is a wife and A is the husband, the effect of the presumption of advancement is to give rise to a statutory trust for sale: Smith v Smith, [I9451 I All E.R. 584, at 586B. 82 (1877) 6 Ch. Div. IX 5. Whether the presumption is regarded as a factor rebutting a resulting trust (Lord Upjohn at 4o6H) or as an independent counter-presumption (Pettit, supra note 8, at 97), it can only apply where the wife would not normally acquire absolute rights anyway and so does not apply where a resulting trust would not arise prima facie in the husband's favour. 83 Except where a wife consents to the husband receiving the income from her property: Edward v Cheyne (No. 2), (x888) 13 App. Cas. 385</page><page sequence="24">INTER VIVOS MATRIMONIAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN ENGLAND 17 I if these were equal (no trust for sale arising under LPA s 36 in the case of realty because legal title is not vested in them both). D Where they both contribute to the price of property vested solely in the husband, the presumption of advancement being inapplicable, he holds on resulting trust for them both. Again, whether they are equitable tenants in common (under a trust for sale in the case of realty) or equitable joint tenants will depend on whether their contributions were equal. E Where they both contribute to the price of property vested in them both, the presumption again being inapplicable, both hold on resulting trust in favour of themselves as equitable tenants in common (under a trust for sale under LPA s 34 in the case of realty) where their contributions are unequal. Where these are equal, equity imposes no resulting trust and therefore they are absolute legal co-owners in the case of personalty and trustees for sale for themselves under LPA s 36 in the case of realty. In the particular case of choses in action like bank and building society accounts and shares these principles have been further refined.84 I / Where there is a fund in the form of a 'joint purse,' on which either spouse can draw and intended as a continuing provision for them severally and jointly, it is joint property, but where it is intended as a 'nest egg' to provide for them jointly but on which only one can draw that one alone owns it;8" 2 / Where the wife alone has contributed to the fund it is difficult to establish that it was intended as a 'joint purse' but the presumption of advancement applies to a fund financed solely by the husband on which the wife can draw, though it can be rebutted by showing that her drawing capacity was con- ferred merely as a matter of convenience;8" 3 / Where a fund financed solely by one spouse is placed in joint names in order to provide for the other in the event of the financing spouse's prior death, the latter retaining exclusive control over it whilst alive, the fund belongs solely to the latter until death but then passes to the other absolutely;87 4 / Where the fund is not created for some limited or specific purpose and one spouse lawfully draws on it to acquire property in his or her own name, prima facie that property belongs to that spouse alone. This can be rebutted by showing that the property was intended to represent the original fund in changed form, in which case it will belong to them both as equitable tenants in common under a resulting trust ;88 5 / No trust arises over the fund itself. Any co-ownership takes effect under a 84 See Cullity, (1969) 85 Law Q.R. 530. This particular case was not directly considered in Pettitt or Gissing but the Court's view is that neither decision has affected the existing law: Thompson v Thompson, (1970) 14 Sol. 1. 455; Heseltine v Heseltine, [Irg97] All E.R. 952. However, the general dicta in Pettitt and Gissing regarding the presumption of advancement and the principle that 'equality is equity' (considered below) do in principle apply. 85 lones v Maynard, [195 I] i All E.R. 802; Re Cohen, [1953] i All E.R. 378 86 Marshal v Crutwell, (1875) L.R. 2o; Eq. 328; Re Figgis, [1968] I All E.R. 999 87 Thompson v Thompson, supra note 84 88 Jones v Maynard, supra note 85; Re Bishop, [1965] I All E.R. 249; Heseltine, supra note 84</page><page sequence="25">172 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL legal joint tenancy until severance.89 On severance the fund will normally be equally divided;9o 6 / In relation to property acquired by one spouse from the fund as his or her property, the general principles of resulting trust and advancement apply to subsequent transactions with that property;"9 7 / Money given by a husband to his wife for housekeeping, and property acquired therefrom, prima facie belong to them both as legal joint tenants (or as joint tenants under a trust for sale in the case of realty)." In all these cases the presumptions of advancement and resulting trust are rebuttable by evidence of a contrary intention.93 If the former is rebutted a resulting trust will arise as if the spouses were strangers. If the latter is rebutted legal title will be conclusive and exhaustive as to the beneficial interests in the property, so that if it vested in one spouse that spouse will be regarded as sole absolute owner; and if it is vested in them both they will be regarded as joint absolute legal owners in the case of personalty and as holding on trust for sale for themselves as equitable joint tenants in the case of realty (because there will be no reason to consider that they are not both beneficially entitled under LPA s 36). So long as they hold as joint tenants it is conceptually impossible to quantify their individual shares since none can exist. However, in cases where they are equitable tenants in com- mon ab initio or where, by severance, they convert an equitable joint tenancy into an equitable tenancy in common,94 separate divisible shares do exist and if the marriage breaks down it becomes necessary to quantify these. It is in such cases that the second equitable doctrine of special application to matri- monial property disputes becomes relevant - 'equality is equity' - for it generates a presumption that equal shares were intended in cases where, because the contributions to the purchase price of the disputed property were unequal, the property would otherwise be divided in proportion to those contributions.95 89 Jones v Maynard, supra note 85; Re Bishop, supra note 88; on severance see infra note 94. go Thompson v Thompson, supra note 84 9 Ibid 92 Married Women's Property Act 1964, c 19 93 As to what evidence is admissible see Shephard v Cartwright, (1955) A.C. 431; the cases cited by Pettit, supra note 8, and by Lord Upjohn in Pettitt (4o61-407B). 94 A legal joint tenancy in realty cannot be severed, but the equitable joint tenancy under the trust for sale can be, inter alia by writing: LPA, s 36(2). Lord Denning argued that an equitable joint tenancy in the matrimonial home cannot be severed in Bedson v Bedson, (1965) 2 Q.B. 666, at 678. Russell LJ found this argument wholly un- supportable (at 690o). The view was also rejected by Plowman J in Re Draper's Conveyance, (1969) I Ch. 486. Nevertheless, Lord Denning reiterated his view in Jackson, supra note 78. He is clearly concerned that the other spouse should not be evicted but this can be achieved by refusing to permit a sale (see the cases cited in note 29). Legal joint tenancies in personalty can still be severed: Vaines, supra note 76. 95 Note how small the wife's contribution was in Rimmer v Rimmer, [1952] 2 All E.R. 863, and how arithmetically simple a proportionate division would have been in that case.</page><page sequence="26">INTER VIVOS MATRIMONIAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN ENGLAND 173 ii Doubts cast upon the strength of the principles by Pettitt If there is evi- dence of an express, inferred or - if permissible - imputed contract between the spouses, the court, in acting on it, will necessarily hold the presumptions of resulting trust and advancement rebutted and replaced by that contract because it constitutes the best evidence available of the spouses' intentions. Moreover, a non-contractual agreement, though incapable of generating proprietary rights, may serve to rebut the presumptions if its terms are in- consistent with their application, in which case legal title will be conclusive. To this extent a contract and a trust approach are reconcileable. However, insofar as the court is permitted to impute contracts to the spouses, in doing so it is substituting contract for trust: it is resolving the dispute on the basis that either reasonable spouses in the parties' position would have agreed that the non-owner should acquire a contractual right to receive an inter- est in the disputed property - in which case it will give effect to the agree- ment by recognizing the right - or that, because they would not, or because the particular parties had evinced some other non-contractual intention, the court cannot go behind legal title at all. As has been seen, Lord Reid stated what would be the position of the contributing or improving spouse under traditional doctrine in terms which made it clear that the doctrine to which he was referring was that of result- ing trust and advancement. His avowed intention was that the imputed contract approach should supercede this doctrine even though he did not consider the detailed differences between the effects of choosing contract rather than trust. However, his lordship was prepared to accept that in some situations the presumption of advancement itself was valid though its 'strength' had been diminished in recent years because wives have become less dependent on their husbands' financial support (389A-B). It is somewhat difficult to understand the nature of this diminution in strength, which his lordship did not define, since the presumption's 'strength' has three aspects: range of initial applicability, evidentiary effect where applicable, rebuttabil- ity. Where the presumption applies ab initio, its effect is to shift the onus of proof of intention to give from a wife claiming an interest in the property, on which it would otherwise lie as part of her general case, to the husband, who must adduce evidence that a gift was not intended of sufficient force to cancel out the effect of the presumption.9 If he is unable to do so a decision in the wife's favour on the issue of intention must follow but if he can do so the wife must herself fail on this issue unless she can affirmatively prove the necessary intention. A 'diminution' of the presumption's 'strength' cannot therefore influence its initial effect on the onus of proof for either it applies at all, and conclusively determines which of the parties must first lead evidence on the issue of intention, or it does not apply at all and does 96 He need not affirmatively prove he did not intend to give: in traditional parlance the onus on him is only 'evidential'; see Cross, Evidence (3rd ed) chapter 4. This parlance was deprecated by Lord Devlin in Jayasena v R., [I970] I All E.R. 2 19.</page><page sequence="27">174 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL not influence the leading of evidence. Where the presumption does apply, however, its ultimate effect will depend on whether it is rebutted - the easier it is to rebut it the less the extent to which it alone decides disputes between spouses. Yet, as Lord Upjohn observed (4o61), courts have long been willing to rebut it on slight evidence.97 Any greater willingness would render its effect nugatory. Moreover, if by 'strength' Lord Reid meant rebuttability, it is hard to understand why he held that the presumption did not assist Mr Pettitt not because it was rebutted on the evidence but because it did not apply (389B). This holding would suggest that by 'strength' was meant initial applicability and certainly it is this definition which makes most sense in the light of his lordship's general argument that common law doc- trine should replace equity doctrine as the criterion for resolving matri- monial disputes. But so long as the presumption continues to be applicable in some cases - an applicability his lordship accepted - the diminution in its range of application is merely thrown into doubt by his lordship's judgment. To refuse to apply it to improvements to the matrimonial home in no way helps to determine which of its traditional applications Lord Reid was attacking since these did not include the case of the husband improving his wife's property. Similar uncertainty as to present standing and effect of the presumption arises from Lord Hodson's view (404D-E) that where direct oral testimony as to the husband's intention is available the presumption should have no 'decisive' effect. If it applies at all it must have decisive initial effect so presumably his lordship was referring to its ultimate effect and thus to its rebuttability, but it remains unclear whether it should be held rebutted where the husband's evidence is that he formed no particular intention at the time of the transaction one way or the other. Lord Diplock's judgment was far less equivocal (414B-I) : the presumption should cease to have any initial applicability; both it and the doctrine of resulting trusts should be replaced by the imputed contract approach, for the latter represented a method of deciding the probable intentions of spouses which was more appropriate in modern socio-economic conditions. The equitable doctrines represented a view of those probable intentions inconsistent with such conditions and since questions of intention are ques- tions of fact, presumptions about intention, like those concerning other facts like death and legitimacy,9s do not bind present-day courts. It could be argued that whereas the presumption of advancement is quite properly regarded in this way, the doctrine of resulting trusts is not, because even if it is itself no more than a presumption of intention"9 it is one upon which depends the existence of a fidiciary relationship productive of substantial rights and duties. Nevertheless, under Lord Diplock's approach in Pettitt 97 Cf Viscount Simon's view that the presumption 'should not ... give way to slight circumstances' in Shephard v Cartwright, supra note 93, at 445. 98 See Cross, supra note 96, at chapter 6. A similar view of presumptions of intention was expressed by Widgery LJ in Thompson, supra note 84. 99 A moot point, see infra note Io4</page><page sequence="28">INTER VIVOS MATRIMONIAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN ENGLAND 175 there is no room for doubt about the role which the equitable doctrines should play in matrimonial property disputes. Unfortunately, his lordship undermined the clarity of his own approach in Gissing, where he accepted (791L), without reference to what he himself had said on the role of the presumption of advancement, what he took to have been the majority view in Pettitt on that issue:" that the presumption ... could seldom have any decisive part to play in disputes between living spouses in which some evi- dence would be available in addition to the mere fact that the husband had provided part of the purchase price of property conveyed into the name of the wife' (italics added). That this confusion between the applicability, initial effect, and rebutta- bility of the presumption of advancement has practical significance can be seen from the Court of Appeal's judgment in Falconer v Falconer"o' in which a wife unsuccessfully appealed against the decision of a county court judge, made under MWPA s 17, that her husband was entitled to an equal share in a house built on her land because he had contributed to the cost of fitting it out and paying off the mortgage on it. She argued that the judge should have applied the presumption of advancement to these contributions. Lord Denning rejected this argument on the ground that the presumption, upon which the case would have been decided in her favour twenty years earlier, was irrelevant ab initio: 'We have decided these cases for some years without much regard to the presumption102 ... and I think we should con- tinue to do so.' In support, he cited the speeches of Lords Reid, Hodson, and Diplock in Pettitt. Megaw LJ also considered that today the presumption rarely applies at all, and, citing Lord Diplock in Gissing, held that it did not assist Mrs Falconer (453g-h). That the presumption did not assist her could have been argued on three grounds: that it did not apply at all to the case of a husband who merely contributes to the cost of the property rather than paying the entire cost himself; that it would once have applied in such a case but should no longer be applied; or that the over-all facts of the case served to rebut it. The first line of argument would have raised the question - also raised by Lord Reid's refusal to apply the presumption to the case of a husband's physical improvements - of the range of applicability of the presumption under traditional doctrine; the second, the extent to which cases deciding when the presumption does apply are still good law - 'with- out much regard,' 'rarely,' and 'seldom' hardly assist on this issue; and the third, the extent to which it can be held rebutted in the absence of express rebuttal testimony. Since none of these lines of argument were actually pursued, the problems raised by them have still to be faced and resolved. iii Ambivalence in Pettitt towards the principles Lord Morris emphasized Ioo This acceptance of the majority view is linked to his acceptance of the majority view against the imputation of contracts, discussed infra page 192. oIo [9g7o] 3 All E.R. 449, noted by Bailey in (i97I) 29 Cambridge L.J. 31 o102 Italics mine; but see Tinker, supra note 34, where both spouses were living and testified</page><page sequence="29">176 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL that property disputes must be resolved solely by reference to the evidence adduced but failed to clarify what principles he would apply to that evi- dence save to reject the imputed contract approach. He approved of the application of 'equality is equity' in cases where the court could not be 'entirely precise' in calculating the size of the spouses' respective interests in the disputed property, but the application of this maxim cannot assist in determining whether both have any such interests for it is a principle of division only. However, in approving Rimmer v Rimmer'03 he might be thought to have approved the application in that case of resulting trust principles, as well as of the principle of equal division, to the interests held to have arisen thereunder. The same could be said of Lord Hodson's judgment, which approved Rimmer and stated that Rimmer had in no way depended 'on an agreement, express or implied' (4o3G). iv Express approval of the equitable principles This came from Lord Upjohn (40o6-7) who considered that they do provide the most satisfactory criteria for adjudication in the absence of evidence of any actual agreement between the spouses or other overt transaction in relation to the property. His lordship viewed the doctrine of resulting trusts as a presumption of intention but it would appear from the terms in which he stated its tenour that he would not concur in Lord Diplock's analysis of that presumption: the resulting trust arises because it produces a result - joint interests in the property - which the spouses may be taken to have desired, but in a method - the use of the trust concept - of which they are unlikely to have had any knowledge, much less have intended, but which the law has devised for them. It is the method, and the widespread repercussions it has on the parties' legal position, especially in relation to third parties, that - in my view - undermines the analogy between resulting trust doctrine and the presumptions of death and legitimacy drawn by Lord Diplock.1?4 10o3 Supra note 95. Cf Re Roger's Question, [1948] i All E.R. 328 104 Academic and judicial controversy surrounds the analysis of resulting trusts, which have been seen as arising either from a presumption of intention or, alternatively, as a matter of law. The preferable view, it is submitted, lies in a compromise; the use of the trust to achieve certain results is a legal device which has been employed to produce results which were probably intended by the parties and those which were not. The cases where a trust has arisen over a public fund, the intended objects of which have failed, in favour of the contributors to it, represent the former use and those where a party, attempting to divest himself of property to avoid tax, has been held to have acquired in the very process a taxable equitable interest represent the latter use. See Re Gillingham Bus Disaster Fund, (1958) Ch. 300; Re West Sussex Constabulary's Trusts, [1970] I All E.R. 544; Vandervell v I.R.C., [1967] 2 All E.R. 37. See, too, Re Ames Settlement, (1946) Ch. 217, where a resulting trust was held to have arisen in favour of one claimant to the property, as a matter of law, so as to prevent the other claimant acquiring it contrary to the probable intentions of the deceased settlor. That there are only a limited number of situations in which resulting trusts arise, of which contributions to acquisition is the most common, indicates that the courts have employed the device only when they have wished to achieve a certain result, whether the motive be to realize the parties' intentions or not. Some support for this flexible analysis can be found in Russell LJ's judgment at 1269 c-E in Hodgson</page><page sequence="30">INTER VIVOS MATRIMONIAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN ENGLAND 177 4 The doctrine of family assets i The scope of the doctrine before Pettitt In Pettitt the majority rejected the suggestion that English law recognises any doctrine of family assets. In Gissing this rejection was repeated. Yet after both decisions the Court of Appeal held that neither had overruled its own previous holdings, in which a doctrine of family assets was advanced. It is therefore essential to examine the purport of that doctrine. It is submitted that although the Court of Appeal had used the phrase 'family assets' not merely to describe a type of property (as the phrase 'matrimonial property' is used in this article) but as the basis for a legal doctrine affecting that type, and although that doctrine was undoubtedly designed to introduce into English law a system of matrimonial property rights analogous to that of automatic community of assets, the doctrine itself was not innovatory but rather an extension of existing principles. Lord Denning had employed the phrase to rationalize an extension of the mean- ing of a 'contribution' under the doctrine of resulting trust and Lord Diplock had used it to construct, through the technique of imputing an intention, a contractual presumption to replace the equitable ones. Lord Denning's argument was, and is, that title to matrimonial property should not depend, as it would in claims between strangers, on whether a financial contribution has been made directly to the price of each specific item in dispute because spouses cohabiting in amity acquire property as a joint enterprise and it is merely a matter of domestic administration who happens to pay the transferor directly: '... where a couple, by their joint efforts, get a home and furniture, intending it to be a continuing provision for their joint lives, it is the prima facie inference from their conduct that the house and furniture is a "family asset," in which each party is entitled to an equal share. It matters not in whose name it stands: or who pays for what: or who goes out to work and who stays at home ...',o" Thus although, in Fribrance v Fribrance,0o6 the wife had used her earnings to run the house- hold while the husband paid off the mortgage, she was held to have acquired an equal beneficial interest in the mortgaged property by freeing his own resources from the burden of daily household expenditure. Again, in Ulrich v Ulrich and Felton,'07 the wife was held to have acquired a half-share in the matrimonial home purchased during the engagement, and conveyed to v Marks, (1971) 2 W.L.R. 1263, in which the CA held that an elderly widow who gratuitously transferred title in her house to her lodger without intending an outright gift, and who omitted to employ a document under LPA, s 53(0), remained equitable owner of it under a resulting trust constituted effectively despite the lack of a docu- ment under LPA, S 53(2). On s 53 see supra note 33. 105 Gissing, supra note 21, at Io46. Lord Denning had earlier used the same approach without employing the phrase 'family assets' so he clearly saw no magic in it: Rimmer v Rimmer, supra note 95, Hine v Hine, [1962] 3 All E.R. 345, Jansen v. Jansen, supra note 61. io6 [19571 All E.R. 357 107 [1968] i All E.R. 67</page><page sequence="31">178 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL the husband, because she, too, had worked and applied her earnings to running the home. In Gissing itself the husband had acquired the home in his own name, raising a small amount of the purchase price from his own savings, a larger amount through a personal loan from his employers, and the bulk of it by means of a mortgage. The wife had expended from her own money ?190 on furniture and kitchen equipment and ?30 on the laying out of a lawn. She had also paid for her own and their son's clothing during the marriage. The majority in the Court of Appeal held that she had contributed not merely to the contents of the house but to its acquisition, the couple having made a joint effort in respect of the home - furniture and premises together - in which her contribution was as great as his. Lord Diplock's use of the doctrine in Ulrich, approved by Lord Denning in Gissing and affirmed by himself in Pettitt (415A-C) was substantially similar in reasoning but invoked contract rather than trust as the means of giving effect to that reasoning. It postulated that normal spouses, making what they subjectively regard as a joint effort towards making the marriage materially successful, do not stop to consider what property rights they are acquiring by their effort but that if they were to do so they would decide on co-ownership: 'In the common case today ... neither party to the marriage has inherited capital, both are earning their living before the marriage, the wife wishes to continue to do so until they start having children. They pool their resources to buy a house on mortgage in the husband's name or in joint names and to furnish and equip it as a family home. They meet the expense of its upkeep and improvement and the payment of instalments on the mortgage out of the family income, to which the wife contributes so long as she is earning. In such a case, the prima facie inference from their con- duct is that the house, furniture and equipment should be family assets ...'10s In Pettitt his Lordship constructed from that inference an imputed con- tractual intention to that effect. That there was no automatic acquisition of property rights by reason merely of the marriage, such as might be expected if the doctrine were innovatory, can be shown by its two qualifications. First, the contribution on which the claimant spouse relied had to be a 'substantial' one.'09 Secondly, it had to be a financial contribution to the acquisition of the disputed property. In the decided cases the wife's contribution to the family pool had been in money or money's worth and, in a realistic sense, had enabled the husband to meet the mortgage payments only at the end of which was the property fully acquired (i.e., rid of the encumbrance in the mortgagee's favour). If her contribution had rested solely on moral exhorta- tion and encouragement to the husband to improve his work effort and Io8 Ibid, at 72 Iog Tulley v Tulley, (x965) Iog Sol.]. 956. The case was otherwise unreported but the rule had been applied in all the subsequent cases. Lord Denning expressed it in Gissing and Edmund Davies LJ dissented in Gissing on the ground that Mrs Gissing's contri- butions had not been substantial.</page><page sequence="32">INTER VIVOS MATRIMONIAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN ENGLAND 179 increase his income, or if, although in money or money's worth, it was made after the husband had acquired absolute unencumbered ownership of the property, she would have acquired no interest.'1 A fortiori, where there had been no contribution but only improvement the doctrine could not be in- voked, which is why resort was had in Appleton"'1 to a liberal construction of MWPA s 17 instead. ii The views expressed in Pettitt Lord Diplock apart, the House firmly ruled that English law recognises no doctrine of family assets but, by failing to distinguish between that doctrine in its senses of acquisition through in- direct contributions and under a doctrine of automatic community of assets, it left the standing of the doctrine in its former sense in doubt. Lord Reid considered, as has been seen, that on the traditional view only the spouse who made a direct contribution to the acquisition of the disputed property would thereby acquire an interest in it, and that only by adopting the imputed contract approach could the unsatisfactory distinction between the direct and indirect contribution cases be overcome. It follows that his lordship considered Lord Denning's method of overcoming the distinction, which did not operate on a contractual basis, incorrect. Yet his lordship's approach was substantially similar to Lord Diplock's and that approach had involved the use of the phrase 'family assets' which Lord Reid deprecated. Lord Morris did not specifically consider the doctrine of family assets but in rejecting the imputed contract approach must be taken to have dis- approved of Lord Diplock's formulation of that doctrine. Lord Hodson specifically equated 'family assets' with community of property (403F) and, holding that only parliament could introduce community into law, rejected Appleton. However, to reject Appleton is not necessarily to reject Fribrance, Ulrich, and Gissing, for even if the former case had been decided on the basis that the husband acquired an interest in the home by his improvement merely because the home was matrimonial property - and it has been sug- gested that this was not the ratio - the latter cases had not been. Thus it is not clear whether his lordship disapproved of Lord Denning's doctrine of family assets, though it follows from his rejection of the imputed contract approach that he rejected Lord Diplock's. It is equally clear that Lord Upjohn rejected the doctrine in both its forms as well as in the sense of community (408H-409E) both because it fixed the spouses with intentions they never in fact formed and because it ixo A Court of Appeal without Lord Denning disapproved of Fribrance because it failed to require some direct causal link between contribution and acquisition: Richards v Richards, [1958] 3 All E.R. 513; Allen v Allen, [1961] 3 All E.R. 385. Both were dis- regarded in subsequent decisions and do appear to misrepresent Lord Denning's argument. See, too, Lord Denning's own distinction between financial and non- financial contributions in Smith v Smith, [1970] 1 All E1.R. 244, at 256c. It was this requirement of financial link which led Lord Diplock to reverse Gissing: see infra page 196. Canadian law also insists on a causally relevant financial contribution: Thompson v Thompson, supra note 84. I I Appleton, supra note 14</page><page sequence="33">I80 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL did not accurately reflect the intentions they would probably have formed as reasonable people if they had thought about the matter. 5 Improvements to the matrimonial home i The theory advanced in Pettitt Lord Reid accepted that on the tradi- tional view an improvement by one spouse to the other's property, not being a direct contribution or an advancement, would generate no interest in the property in favour of the improver. His lordship would have avoided this result through the imputed contract approach, under which he would have constructed certain presumptions: if the improvement was of a capital and non-recurring nature and was made while the spouses were living in amity or otherwise in such circumstances that it could be said that the owner must have known it was being made, the spouses would be presumed to have agreed that the improver should acquire an interest commensurate with the value of the improvement; if not of the requisite nature or if not made with the owner's knowledge the converse presumption would arise. Lord Diplock, however, differed from Lord Reid as to the practical effect, on the question of improvements, of the imputed contract approach. He thought it would, generally, lead to the view that the improvement had been made in the course of normal domestic life and that therefore the spouses would not, had they thought about it, have agreed that the improver should acquire an interest in the property. Lord Diplock's judgment would thus produce the same result as Lord Morris', according to which the improver would only acquire an interest if there was an actual agreement to that effect, which would be rare. (389G, 416r-E, 3971-3980) Lord Upjohn would also deny the improver an interest in the absence of actual agreement because, such agreement apart, the improver's interest could only be acquired under the doctrine of proprietary estoppel and, as has been seen, in his view this doctrine could only avail in the case of an improvement made in reliance on an express promise to confer a proprietary interest in return for it. But only Lord Hodson appeared unwilling to en- visage any case in which the improver would acquire an interest, his view being that such an interest could only arise from an actual agreement to that effect and that spouses do not make such agreements. (4o09G-I, 404-D) ii The application of the theory to the facts of Pettitt There being no unfettered discretion under MWPA s 17 to confer on Mr Pettitt the interest he claimed, nor any doctrine of community of assets to assist him, his claim depended on his being able to establish an agreement with his wife, at the time the improvements were made, that they would earn the interest for him. There was no suggestion of an express agreement and for Lord Reid the improvements, not being of a capital and non-recurring nature, did not justify the inference or imputation of any such agreement. Similarly, for Lord Morris none of the evidence justified such an inference and it was not open to the court to act on imputations. For Lords Hodson and Diplock the improvements were such as any husband might make in the course of</page><page sequence="34">INTER VIVOS MATRIMONIAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN ENGLAND 181 normal married life and for Lord Upjohn there was no actual agreement upon which Mr Pettitt could base a claim either in contract or under proprietary estoppel. (39 E--G, 399F-H-, 404c, 4I6D-E, 4I OA-D) To this extent, therefore, their lordships decided the case against Mr Pettitt by reference to the general principles they had held to be applicable in improvement cases. However, some confusion was introduced into the scope of those principles by consideration of the facts of cases the rationes of which were undoubtedly rejected by the House: Appleton, Jansen, and Button v Button.112 In Appleton the husband, a professional woodcarver, had carried out extensive renovations to his wife's house and was held entitled to an interest in it proportionate to the increase in its value resulting from his work. In Jansen the husband had given up his job to work full- time on converting his wife's house into apartments and was held to have acquired a similarly proportionate interest. In Button, however, the wife's claim to an interest failed because her improvements had merely been in the nature of 'do-it-yourself' work which any reasonable spouse might be ex- pected to do without calling in a professional builder or decorator. As has been submitted, both Appleton and the cases following it were decided on the basis that the court had an unfettered discretion under MWPA S 17 to divide the property in a way which produced a fair settlement on the break- down of the marriage. Hence the usefulness of applying them to Pettitt's facts was limited. Yet Lords Reid and Diplock so applied them, holding that Button and Jansen were right and Appleton probably wrong, and that the facts before them fell within Button. Lord Diplock indicated that by 'right' and 'wrong' (416F-H) he meant only that he would have reached the same conclusion by applying his approach, yet, having himself acknowledged that that approach was different from the 'unfettered discretion' argument, it would surely have been more helpful to have decided Pettitt solely by apply- ing his own approach to the facts. That reference to these earlier decisions produced some confusion is illustrated by Smith v Baker,"3 where the Court of Appeal awarded the wife an interest in her husband's house on the basis, inter alia, of her im- provement to his property. Since that 'improvement' actually took the form of helping to build the house on her husband's land this result might have been justified on the basis of an agreement inter partes. Yet it was decided by actually applying Jansen, which was held to have been approved by Lords Reid and Diplock in Pettitt. If that were right then, as an improve- ment case - and Pettitt was, above all, an improvement case - Pettitt had added nothing to the previous law, an effect which Lords Hodson and Upjohn had tried to avoid by disapproving of the earlier Appeal decisions precisely on the basis that their rationes were wrong since there had been no actual agreement between the parties. On this view it is difficult to see S12 Appleton v Appleton, supra note 14; Jansen v Jansen, supra note 61; Button v Button, [1968] All E.R. 1064. I13 [197o] 2 All E.R. 826</page><page sequence="35">182 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL how the Court of Appeal could have found an actual agreement in Smith v Baker and, bearing in mind the patent disagreement in Pettitt over the imputability of contract, one can sympathise with the court's resort to the earlier improvement cases as the only available basis for upholding the wife's claim. Nevertheless that resort was only possible because of the confusion with which their Lordships presented what was undoubtedly intended as an overruling of those cases. 2 The Retreat from Pettitt I AFFIRMATION OF A DOCTRINE OF FAMILY ASSETS As has been seen, their lordships, in rejecting the existence of any doctrine of family assets in English law, whilst tending to equate such a doctrine with community of assets, and in failing to consider directly the arguments mounted by Lords Diplock and Denning on the basis of indirect contribu- tions to acquisition, left the status of those arguments in doubt. On the one hand, it could have been said that the earlier cases were no longer good law since they violated the spirit of the judgments in Pettitt. On the other hand, it could equally be said that since the earlier cases had not been directly overruled and since their lordships could not have intended to reverse 'by a sidewind' what had become a well-established doctrine in daily use by practitioners and judges those cases still stood. The Court of Appeal came to the assistance of the legal profession in several subsequent cases in which precisely the latter argument was employed and the doctrine of family assets, in the sense of the acquisition of matrimonial property rights under a resulting trust by virtue of indirect contributions, resurrected."'4 In all these cases Lord Denning's view was that although Pettitt has seen the phrase 'family assets' deprecated, the case had been a decision solely on the scope of MWPA s 17 and on the effect of improvements. It had in no way affected Fribrance, Ulrich, Gissing, and all the other Court of Appeal decisions in which the phrase had been used to sum up the rule, still applicable, that 'when the matrimonial home or the furniture is acquired by the spouses as a joint venture, each of them contributing directly or indirectly to the deposit or the mortgage instalments, then it is to be regarded as belonging to them jointly, no matter that it should stand in the name of one only: and, in the absence of any clear division, their interests are to be regarded as equal.'115 114 Chapman v Chapman, [I969] 3 All E.R. 476; Nixon v Nixon, [I969] 3 All E.R. 1133; Muetzel v Muetzel, [1970] 1 All E.R. 433; D'Gama v D'Gama, (I969) II4 Sol.]. ii; Smith v Baker, supra note I 13 (decided before, but reported after, the House's opinion in Gissing).

See also Muetzel, supra note I 14, at 444H, and Smith v Baker, supra note I I 3, at 828c.</page><page sequence="36">INTER VIVOS MATRIMONIAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN ENGLAND 183 However, in two important respects this line of post-Pettitt cases extended the previous doctrine. First, it postulated that the possibility of a 'clear division,' such as would preclude the application of 'equality is equity,' depended not upon the existence of evidence pointing to an agreement incon- sistent with equal shares, but on the ability of the court to calculate the objective value of the contributions relied on in the case and the ratio between that value and the total worth of the disputed property. This is the only tenable conclusion, it is submitted, from the divisions of the property in Nixon, Muetzel, and D'Gama and it meant that, notwithstanding the juristic basis for holding a spouse entitled to a share in the property on the strength of an indirect contribution was that the acquisition thereof by the spouses was a joint effort made without nice comparisons between the respective value of the effort of each, and notwithstanding it ought to follow from that basis that either the indirect contributor had an equal share or no share at all, the court would make those nice comparisons which lead to proportionate division. In fact the basis on which the court made those comparisons in these cases is hard to find. In Nixon the husband had acquired three farms in his own name out of the proceeds of sale of previous premises owned by him and out of the profits of various businesses in which his wife had worked. The court held that her work in the businesses had been a substantial contribution towards the acquisition of the farms, just as if she had taken a job with a third party and applied her earnings towards the purchase price, but it also considered that it should not ignore the fact that the original matrimonial home, from the sale of which the husband had first begun to accumulate the funds out of which the farms were bought, had itself been acquired by him from the profits of a business he had run without her help for ten years before the marriage. Therefore, though she might otherwise have been held entitled to an equal share in all three farms, the wife was held entitled only to such a share in the one which had comprised the final matrimonial home and no share in the other two. In Muetzel the husband had been able to put down the cash deposit on the home with the help of money supplied by the wife from her own savings and from a loan she had procured from a Swedish friend, the husband having no contacts from whom such a loan might have resulted. While he was repaying the mortgage she acted as bookkeeper for the family business - until a permanent secretary was employed - and looked after a lodger who paid between ?6 and ?7 per week rent. At the time she instituted s 17 proceedings the house was worth between ?i I,ooo and ?12,000. The court held that the raising of the loan, the bookkeeping, and the care of the lodger constituted substantial indirect contributions towards the acquisition of the house but that since the husband had already paid the wife ?500 to buy her out of the family business she should be awarded a one-third share in the house instead of a half-share. Thus her acceptance of the ?500 had cost her a good deal more, for instead of receiving an</page><page sequence="37">I84 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL interest worth between ?5,500 and ?6,ooo (or of between ?5,00ooo and ?5,500 had the ?500 simply been deducted from the value of a half-share) she received one worth between ?3,666 and ?4,000. In D'Gama the wife had used her earnings for household expenses and had, again, looked after a lodger. She had received no payment from her husband, unlike Mrs Muetzel, and if she was entitled to any share in the home it was on the straightforward basis that the acquisition thereof had been a joint venture, yet her share was quantified at one quarter of the value of the home. The second important aspect of the pre-Pettitt cases lay in the liberality with which the Court applied the requirement that the indirect contribution be 'substantial' in Muetzel. The wife had helped in the business but her help had consisted of no more than answering a few letters and telephone calls, for until the employment of a permanent secretary and a substantial change in the nature of the business turnover was very small. Yet the court chose to speculate about the possible connection between the initial and later stages of a business rather than on the actual connection in this business. The wife had helped to look after the paying guest but the rent of ?6 to ?7 was primarily paid for the use of the room and it was orally argued that it would be erroneous to regard the whole amount as representing the value of the wife's work. The reader will not even find this argument referred to in the judgments. The wife had obtained the loan but this was no more than any reasonable wife would do, knowing that her husband had no financial contacts and desiring a home of their own as much as he did. Again, the Court did not advert to this argument in holding that the raising of the loan was a contribution."6 The approach of the Court to these arguments should be contrasted with Edmund Davies LJ'S view in D'Gama that whether or not a contribution is substantial must be determined objectively and does not depend merely on whether the contributor has given all of the work, funds, and services he or she had to offer. II CIRCUMVENTION OF MWPA S 17 THROUGH USE OF DISCRETIONARY POWERS TO REDISTRIBUTE MATRIMONIAL PROPERTY Section 4 of the Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Act 197011" provides that on granting a decree of divorce, nullity, or judicial separation, or at any time thereafter, the court may make one or more of certain orders: A an order that a party to the marriage shall transfer to the other party, to any child of the family or to such person as may be specified in the order for the benefit of such [a] child such property as may be so specified, being property to which the first-mentioned party is entitled, either in possession or reversion; I I6 Had Mrs Muetzel herself given the loan this would surely not have been a contribu- tion; the very fact that it was given qua loan would have indicated that it was meant to be repaid and this would have rebutted the presumption of co-ownership (for the recoverability of leans between spouses see Bromley, supra note i, at 371). 117 For general discussion see the material on the I97o act cited in note 4 supra</page><page sequence="38">INTER VIVOS MATRIMONIAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN ENGLAND 185 B an order that a settlement of such property as may be so specified, being property to which a party to the marriage is so entitled, be made to the satisfaction of the court for the benefit of the other party to the marriage and of the children of the family or either or any of them; c an order varying for the benefit of the parties to the marriage and of the children of the family or either or any of them any ante-nuptial or post- nuptial settlement (including such a settlement made by will or codicil) made on the parties to the marriage; D an order extinguishing or reducing the interest of either of the parties to the marriage under any such settlement ... There are several limitations on the scope of this provision: s 4 proceed- ings are personal and cannot be continued by a spouse's estate;11s they can- not be instituted at all unless the marriage has been judicially terminated, unlike s 17 proceedings; and there are certain orders which a court cannot make under s 4 even when such an order would best effect the result sought by the court.19 Nevertheless, the provision will apply in the many matri- monial property disputes, which do arise out of proceedings for divorce, nullity, or judicial separation, and the powers which it does give the courts clearly enable them to effect redistributions of property rights which Pettitt precludes them from making under s 17. Moreover, in determining whether to make an order under s 4, and if so what order, the courts are both per- mitted and required to take into account a wide variety of circumstances relating to the relationship between the spouses and the history of the mar- riage which would be quite irrelevent to a determination of subsisting property rights under s 17. These circumstances, specified by s 5 of the Act, include the duration of the marriage, the age of each spouse, the earning capacity and independent financial resources of each, their present and probable future financial needs, their physical and mental health, and all contributions which each has made to the welfare of the family, including the kinds of contributions which are ineffective for the purposes of acquiring property rights under the principles already examined, such as - and this particular form of contribution is specifically mentioned in s 5 - contribu- tions made by looking after the home and caring for the family. Although sections 4 and 5 extend the similar powers which the courts possessed under previous legislation,120 that previous legislation had itself 118 D(J) vD(S), [i973] 1 AIE.R. &amp;49 I g 9 The Family Division of the High Court has no power under the act, or at all, to make an order divesting one spouse of property and vesting it in the other under the Trustee Act 1925, s 44, or an order under the Land Registration Act 1925, s 82(l) amending entries on the register of title in respect of a matrimonial home title to which has been brought under that act's registration system: Jones v Jones, [I972] 3 All E.R. 289.

Lord Diplock saw this in Pettitt (4151) and Lord Denning, prior to the entry into force of the new provisions, held that the latter would merely make explicit the factors which the courts were already able to take into account. In Smith v Smithl21 the spouses were joint owners of the matrimonial home, holding it on trust for sale for themselves. The wife had worked to help the husband pay off the mortgage while they were cohabiting, and when he deserted her she continued to pay the mortgage instalments, rates, and household expenses. At first he paid her ?8 per week but thereafter his financial assistance ceased and she became dependent on herself and her two working children to maintain the house, which was worth ?3,750 but in respect of the mortgage on which ?1,300 remained outstanding. The Court held that in view of her efforts to keep the mortgagees at bay and support herself, she was entitled to more than a mere half-share in the equity of ?2,450. It ordered that the husband's legal and equitable rights in the house should be extinguishedl22 but that the wife should be precluded from thereafter claiming maintenance from him. Lord Denning said of the pro- vision under which the variation was made: 'It applies ... only to "settle- ments," but that word has been construed so widely as to include the matri- monial home and the furniture in it - in other words, all "family assets" - when they were acquired as a continuing provision for the family of the future. The court can vary the established rights in those assets in whatever way it thinks fit ... It can consider the conduct of the parties: the income of each: their earning capacity: their financial needs: their ages: their standards of living: the contributions made by each, and not merely their financial contributions,123 direct or indirect, but also any contributions made (particularly by the wife) in looking after the home and caring for the children ...'124 4 (b) to be made in nullity suits nor those in s 4(c) in judicial separation suits. The powers conferred by s 4 are exercizable in applications arising from matrimonial suits instituted before I January 1971 provided the application does not amount in sub- stance to a request for the variation of a maintenance order made before that date, since the express provisions in s 9 of the I97o act for variation of maintenance orders do not themselves have retrospective operation: Williams v Williams, [I971] 2 All E.R. 764; Powys v Powys, [I971] 3 All E.R. I16. Note that the criteria for s 4 orders specified in s 5 are the same as those which courts must now employ in determining whether to order maintenance and other financial provision under s 2 of the act. 12i [I970o] All E.R. 244 I22 In Jones, supra note I19, it was argued that courts should effect s 4 variations not by merely extinguishing one spouse's interests but by positively declaring new trusts. I23 For one relevance of this particular form of wording, distinguishing between financial and other contributions, see note I o and related text. 124 Supra note 121, at 246 b-d; see also Spizewski v Spizewski, [I97o] I All E.R. 794, Meldrum v Meldrum, [I970] 3 All E.R.

Smith was applied in a decision under the new provision in which the court extinguished the rights in the home of a deserting wife so as to prevent her being able to force a sale over the wishes of the occupying husband and child: White v White, (I972) 116 Sol.J. 1g9. The form of the order differs from that regarded as desirable in Jones, supra note I 19, but is consistent with the general judicial reluctance, noted in notes 24 and 29 supra, to allow one spouse to</page><page sequence="40">INTER VIVOS MATRIMONIAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN ENGLAND 187 Thus, to the extent that a spouse can and does acquire a right in the other's property by virtue of direct and indirect contributions and that right arises under trust doctrine - and the examination of Gissing in part 3 shows that it generally will arise under that doctrine - there will be a variable settlement under s 4. Lord Denning strongly encouraged counsel to combine proceedings under the predecessor to s 4 with those under MWPA s 17 and for maintenance,'12 and the advantages to be gained by this tactic have been increased with the widening of the court's powers by s 4. III STATUTORY INTERVENTION IN CASES OF IMPROVEMENTS TO PROPERTY Section 37 of the Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Act 197o provides: It is hereby declared that where a husband or wife contributes in money or money's worth to the improvement of real or personal property in which or in the proceeds of sale of which either or both of them has or have a beneficial interest, the husband or wife so contributing shall, if the contribution is of a substantial nature and subject to any agreement between them to the contrary, express or implied, be treated as having then acquired by virtue of his or her contribution a share or an enlarged share, as the case may be, in that beneficial interest of such an extent as may have been then agreed or, in default of such agreement, as may seem in all the circumstances just to any court before which the question of the existence or extent of the beneficial interest of the husband or wife arises ... It must be noted that although the language of the section is strongly reminiscent of the doctrine of family assets expounded by Lord Denning, that doctrine had not been applied to improvement cases whereas the section applies only to such cases. The effect of the language is to show that s 37 is not limited to the spouse who actually effects improvements. It would seem to extend, for instance, to a wife whose earnings are used to meet all household expenses so as to enable her husband to save up enough to employ a professional builder to carry out the kind of work done by the husband himself in Appleton or Jansen. Unfortunately, it appears that the section has not dispensed with the need to resort to earlier matrimonial property cases because these (as well, perhaps, as Gissing) will probably be invoked in answering at least three questions which, it is submitted, arise from s 37. First, when is a contribution to be regarded as substantial? Does it depend on the objective value of the contribution per se, or on its objective value in terms of the amount by which the over-all value of the improved property is enhanced by the im- provement, or on the over-all cost of that improvement, or on whether or not the improvement consisted of the type of 'do-it-yourself work' which force the other out of the home without adequate protection, especially where children are involved. For discussion of Lord Denning's most recent major pronouncement on the divisions appropriate under s 4 see infra page 20o8-9. I25 Eg Muetzel, supra note I I4, at 445D; Tinker, supra note 34, at 542E</page><page sequence="41">188 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL reasonable spouses would do themselves?126 Secondly, how is the existence of an agreement to the contrary to be tested? Does an 'implied' agreement that the improver should acquire no interest in the property cover both inferred and imputed agreements or only the former? Can the court impute, as well as infer, an agreement as to the size of any interest that the improver does acquire? Thirdly, in the absence of any agreement as to the size of the interest, whatever the basis for ascertaining its existence, what criteria are then to be applied in determining what constitutes a 'just' quantification? Which, if any, of the factors it can take into account in varying settlements under s 4 of the Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Act 1970 can the court consider under s 37? All these are matters on which litigation can be anticipated for the future. 3 Gissing v Gissing: Some Doctrinal Difficulties Resolved I THE ISSUE IN THE CASE Although their lordships set out in Gissing, as they had in Pettitt, to provide an authoritative statement of the general principles applicable in matri- monial property disputes, certain matters were placed beyond the ambit of that statement by the particular circumstances of the case. The proceedings having been instituted by originating summons in the Chancery Division for a declaration of rights and consequential orders, no opportunity arose to define further the nature of the discretion conferred by MWPA s 17. No allegation having been raised by Mrs Gissing of an express agreement that her husband should confer on her an interest in the disputed property, no question arose as to the strength of the presumption against contractual intention. Since the claimant was a wife relying on her own indirect contri- butions, the presumption of advancement did not arise for consideration. The issue therefore resolved itself thus: on what basis, if any, could Mrs Gissing's contribution to the furniture, kitchen equipment, lawn, and family clothing be regarded as entitling her to an interest in the matrimonial home, and if she had acquired any interest on that basis what was the size of that interest? The primary significance of the judgments in the case is that they have clearly established that the juridical basis for the acquisition of a right such as that claimed, in the absence of expense contract, is the trust concept. Thus the numerous effects of substituting contract for trust in the cases where there is a direct choice between the two regimes are precluded from flowing and all the incidents of adopting a trust approach continue to obtain, in particular the availability of the statutory provision for the variation of I26 The Court of Appeal held that a wife who paid for the connecting up of electricity and the installation of a sink unit, fireplaces, and a waterheater had made a substantial contribution under s 37: Davis v Vale, [19711 2 All E.R. IO2I. Lord Denning stated that s 37 statutorily adopts the approach in Jansen, supra note 61, in which case the 'do-it-yourself work' test remains decisive. Edmund Davies and Stamp LJJ thought that on any meaning of 'substantial' the wife was bound to succeed.</page><page sequence="42">INTER VIVOS MATRIMONIAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN ENGLAND 189 post- and ante-nuptial 'settlements,' s 4 of the Matrimonial Proceeding and Property Act 1970. (782f, 785f, 787d, 789h) II THE THREADS OF THE ARGUMENT A The nature of the trust As has been seen, prior to Pettitt the solution of matrimonial property dis- putes depended, in the majority of cases where there was no actual agree- ment between the spouses about their property rights, on the doctrine of the resulting trust arising from contributions to the purchase price of the property. This was the approach favoured by Lord Upjohn in Pettitt and supported in Gissing by Lord Pearson.'27 However, there can be detected in the other judgments a deviation from this traditional approach. For Lord Reid the trust arises when, and because, the legal owner of the property accepts a contribution towards its acquisition from the other. The trust is then 'imposed' on the owner. Megaw LJ has since used Lord Reid's ap- proach as a bridge between the view that beneficial interests in matrimonial property are acquired as a matter of law and the view that they are acquired as a matter of agreement, holding that a wife making indirect contributions had thereby earned such an interest because any reasonable husband would have accepted them on the basis that they were to generate one.128 For Viscount Dilhorne a trust arises if there is an agreement between the spouses whereby the contributor is to receive an interest in the property, because equity will not permit the other to renege on that agreement in 'breach of faith.' Similarly, for Lord Diplock the trust arises if, pursuant to such an agreement, the beneficiary has acted to his or her detriment in reliance on the other's promise.'29 Thus, to some extent, for all three of their lordships the trust arises out of equity's long established jurisdiction to impose constructive trusts in order to prevent one party enjoying the fruits of unconscionable behaviour towards the other,'13 yet none of them - nor, I27 Resulting trust doctrine was regarded as governing matrimonial property disputes under Pettitt and Gissing by Bagnall j in Cowcher v Cowcher, [1972] I All E.R. 943, noted in (1972) 35 Modern L.R. 547. I28 Hazell vHazell, [1972] 1 All E.R. 923 129 Lord Diplock's views were seen by Lord Denning as an application of constructive trust doctrine in Binions v Evans, (1972) 2 W.L.R. 729, applying the decision in Bannister, cited in note 130. However, Lord Denning has also recently said that there is no distinction between the two types of trust in terms of juridical basis: Hussey v Palmer, (1972) I W.L.R. I286, discussed infra page 202. 130 See the constructive trust cases cited in note 49, the material on equitable fraud in note 31, Goff and Jones, supra note 5o, at 36-8, and chapter 35; Bannister v Bannister, [1948] 2 All E.R. I33. It is sometimes suggested that the cases establishing the doctrine of a trust of contractual rights as an exception to the privity rule, eg Re Foster's Policy, [1966] 1 All E.R. 432; Beswick v Beswick, (1968) A.C. 58, are constructive trust cases. (This is how they are seen in Cheshire &amp; Fifoot, supra note 30o, at 434 f.) To renege on an obligation to confer a benefit on a stranger to the contract may be unconscionable but it seems preferable to regard these cases as establishing a sui generis common law adaptation of trust principles, for the reasons given in Hanbury, supra note 29, at 633.</page><page sequence="43">190 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL apparently Lord Morris - considered it relevant whether the trust is re- garded as resulting or constructive, implying that there is no practical dis- tinction between the two. (787d-g, 782f, 785g, 79oa-e and 793f, 783h) However, it is submitted that there is an important practical difference. The party alleging unconscionable behaviour must prove it to succeed. If his case be that the alleged trustee would, but for the imposition of the alleged trust, be able to enjoy benefits conferred on him by the other pur- suant to an agreement between them he must establish that the agreement was made and that he conferred the agreed benefit under, and because of, it. Under the doctrine of resulting trust examined earlier, the party alleging the trust need only show that there has been such a transaction, in such circumstances, as prima facie gives rise to such a trust. To the extent that the trust's existence is based on the parties' states of mind traditional re- sulting trust doctrine seems, in the writer's view, to proceed upon the premises that it is not necessary to show any agreement that the claimant would confer a benefit and in return be treated as having acquired rights in the other's property; that it is only necessary to show a common inten- tion that - given the conferring of the benefit in the particular circum- stances - the claimant should be so treated; that the law will presume such an intention from the fact that the benefit was conferred; and that it will give effect to this intention through the trust device unless the alleged trustee can himself adduce evidence to shift the burden of affirmatively proving such an intention back to the claimant.831 In a matrimonial prop- erty dispute, therefore, a spouse claiming an interest under traditional resulting trust doctrine, need only prove that a contribution to acquisition was made, unless and until the alleged trustee adduces evidence to show that the parties did not intend co-ownership to result from that contribu- tion. However, on a strict application of the views of Viscount Dilhorne and Lord Diplock, the claimant would have to prove that the contribution was exclusively referable to an agreement whereby the claimed interest was to be acquired if the contribution were made, and according to a strict interpretation of Lord Reid's views the claimant would have to show that the other spouse consciously treated the contribution as one generating property rights. Lord Diplock would escape this distinction in two ways: by arguing that the making of the contribution is itself prima facie evidence that it was made pursuant to the kind of agreement upon which the existence of the trust will depend; and by further arguing that the kind of agreement the courts are concerned with is not the consciously formed and overtly articu- lated consensus ad idem of the parties but the coincidence of their separately 131 For brief discussion of the nature of resulting trusts see note I04 supra and on the issue of the burden of proof in cases involving presumptions of intention see note 96 supra. Note the identical treatment of resulting and constructive trusts of realty under LPA, s 53(2), supra note 33, however.</page><page sequence="44">INTER VIVOS MATRIMONIAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN ENGLAND 19 inferred intention. The first argument extends the presumption drawn from contributions under the traditional doctrine of resulting trust somewhat artificially: from a presumption that, given the contribution, the parties would have intended joint interests to arise to a presumption that such an interest should only arise if and to the extent that the contribution relied on has been made as agreed. The second argument extends, in an innovative manner, the meaning of agreement, as opposed to the concept of common intention - on which the resulting trust arising from contributions appears to be based - in English law. Neither of these arguments, moreover, assists in determining how the distinction between the traditional doctrines of resulting trust and of trusts arising from unconscionable behaviour would affect cases, other than matrimonial property disputes, analogous to those in which one or other has been specifically applied hitherto. (79of, h) It is not entirely clear at what moment the equitable obligation not to renege on the agreement, which is the basis of the trust, arises. For Lords Reid and Diplock it would appear that neither party has any obligations ab initio: the non-owner is not obliged to make the agreed contributions and only if these are made, and made because of the agreement, does the owner become bound to treat the other as co-owner of the property because only then can the contributions be 'accepted' under Lord Reid's judgment and the contributor regarded as having 'relied' on the other's promise under Lord Diplock's. On this view the owner is in a significantly different position from that in which he would be under a contract, for even if the contractual promise by him to confer a proprietary interest on the other be regarded as unilateral he would fall under an obligation, once the other had started making the contributions, not to prevent them continuing.132 However, Viscount Dilhorne's approach implies that the equitable obligation not to renege arises once the agreement is made or, at the latest, when contribu- tions first begin. B The existence of agreement Lord Pearson, in following traditional resulting thinking, distinguished it from an approach based on agreement. Therefore he did not concern him- self with the ways in which the courts can ascertain the existence of agree- ments between spouses who have made no express promises to one another but only with those in which equity presumed a common intention of co- ownership (even though, as Lord Diplock demonstrated, a case could be made out for merging the concepts of common intention and agreement in 132 Under a unilateral contract the offeror promises to confer a benefit on the offeree if the latter performs a certain act. The latter accepts the offer by starting to perform it but incurs no obligation to continue performing it. Once he completes the act the offeror becomes bound to confer the benefit. Before that time the offeror is bound not to prevent completion of the act and, possibly, not to withdraw the offer.

Lord Morris did not con- cern himself with the issue of ascertaining agreements, either, even though, in repeating the view expressed in Pettitt that such disputes should be decided solely on the evidence adduced, he stressed the evidential signif- icance of express and inferred - again rejecting imputed - agreements. On the question of inference and imputation Lord Reid's judgment was some- what puzzling. While his lordship accepted that spouses living together do not normally make agreements about their rights in one another's property and repeated the view in Pettitt that if they did they would probably agree on co-ownership, he failed positively to state whether he thought it was open to the court to employ the technique he had advocated in Pettitt of imput- ing such an agreement to them. He expressed the hope that it was so open but, in effect, left this to be decided in subsequent cases. Perhaps he was conscious of the fact that his view in Pettit had been seen as a minority view, and one actually regarded as such by Lord Diplock in Gissing, but if so it is hard to see how he could have considered that it was even arguable that courts could impute agreements. (783-4b, 782a-f, 783e-f) Lord Diplock, however, accepted that he was bound by what had been the majority view in Pettitt: that it was not permissible to impute agree- ments to the spouses. To compensate for this concession his lordship ad- vanced a liberal view of the court's powers to infer agreements from the spouses' words and conduct. His initial postulate was that the common in- tention of two people is to be inferred from the view which a reasonable man in the position of one of them would have considered to be the inten- tion evinced by the other's words and conduct. If the two intentions so inferred coincide, a common intention results. His lordship proceeded by asserting that in making inferences about the spouses' common intention in regard to their property rights the words and conduct to be taken into consideration are not limited to those occurring at the moment when the owner acquired the property from a third party: if the property was paid for through a mortgage, words and conduct occurring during the period of mortgage repayments would be equally relevant for that is the full period of acquisition. He then set out the common ways in which the home is acquired and the various inferences of common intention generated by them: A When the matrimonial home is paid for outright and is vested in only one spouse, although the other has contributed part of the purchase price directly, the prima facie inference is that they intended the contributor to acquire an interest in it. If the contributor is the husband the wife might rebut this inference with the aid of the presumption of advance- ment, but this is easily rebutted when both spouses can give direct oral testimony.a33 B When the home has been paid for partly by cash deposit and partly by 133 Supra page 17off</page><page sequence="46">INTER VIVOS MATRIMONIAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN ENGLAND 193 money advanced on mortgage, and is vested in the name of one spouse although the other has directly contributed to the initial deposit or legal charges, the prima facie inference is that they intended the contributor to acquire an interest in it. If the contributor thereafter directly and sub- stantially contributes to the money with which the mortgage is repaid the inference favours the acquisition of a further interest in return for the further contribution. c When the matrimonial home has been acquired by deposit and mortgage, and is vested in one spouse although the other has directly contributed to the deposit or legal charges and prima facie thereby acquired an interest under B, the contributor will also prima facie acquire an interest in return for any indirect contributions to the mortgage repayments, as where the wife, by working and paying all household bills, enables her husband to make those repayments with his own earnings. D When the matrimonial home has been acquired by deposit and mortgage, it is the prima facie inference from regular and substantial direct contri- butions to the money used to repay the mortgagee that the contributor was intended to acquire an interest in the property even in the absence of previous direct contributions to the deposit or legal charges. (789f, 79oh, 791a, 791b-792g) c The effect of indirect contributions It seems to follow from Lord Diplock's exposition of the circumstances in which the court can infer an intention for co-ownership that, in his view, a spouse who contributes indirectly to the mortgage repayments without having made any prior direct contribution to the deposit or legal charges prima facie does not acquire an interest in the property from those indirect contributions.134 To this important extent, therefore, his lordship would re- strict the acquisition of matrimonial property rights by abandoning the im- puted contract approach. The explanation for this restriction would seem to be that there are many reasons why a spouse, particularly a wife, should con- tribute to the family pool other than the existence of an agreement that 134 That section from Lord Diplock's judgment summarized in the text is the section in which his lordship set out positively to state the circumstances in which an inference of intended co-ownership will arise, and does not suggest that indirect contributions are alone sufficient to support such an inference. However, at 793G he said that a wife acquires no interest, in the absence of express agreement, when she has made 'no initial contribution to the cash deposit and legal charges and no direct contribution to the mortgage instalments nor any adjustment of her contribution to other expenses of the household which it can be inferred was referable to the acquisition of the house ...' (my italics). The italicized words could be interpreted as a positive addi- tion to the earlier section in his judgment, according to which indirect contributions standing alone can give rise to a trust. This is how Lord Denning has interpreted this passage: Hargrave v Newton, [I97I] 3 All E.R. 866, at 868H-9D; Hazell v Hazell, supra note 128. However, in my view, the passage at 793G was intended not to add to the propositions summarized in the text but rather to restate them in negative form, and the italicized words are thus the negative converse of proposition c in the text.</page><page sequence="47">194 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL through those contributions property rights would be acquired, and there- fore such contributions, standing alone, do not justify the inference of such an agreement. This explanation finds support in the judgment of Viscount Dilhorne, who also accepted that the majority in Pettitt had rejected the imputed agreement approach and considered that 'proof of expenditure for the benefit of the family by one spouse will not of itself suffice to show any ... common intention as to the ownership of the matrimonial home.' It is not clear whether he shares Lord Diplock's view that such an intention can be inferred where such expenditure is coupled with direct contributions to deposit or legal charges. At one point he hints that he does not13'5 but his consideration of the circumstances in which inferences of intended co- ownership will arise is much briefer than Lord Diplock's because, for Viscount Dilhorne, it will always be ultimately a question of fact for each court in each case. The briefness of Lord Morris' judgment can also be explained on the basis of an acknowledgement that the question of inten- tion is one of fact for each court, and since Lord Morris also stressed the court's obligation to act solely on the evidence adduced, it may be that he would attribute no effect to indirect contributions, even when coupled with direct ones, on the basis that these do not amount to sufficient concrete evidence of intention. (786a, f, c, e) Lord Reid expressed dissatisfaction with the distinction between direct and indirect contributions. In his view there are many cases in which the spouses have clearly given no thought to their respective rights in matri- monial property and in which the court would therefore be unjustified in inferring any agreement even where the contributions were direct. In such cases more satisfactory results could be obtained if the courts were free to impute such an agreement and they should be equally free to do so where the contributions were indirect: the imputed contract approach is not the best way to achieve such results (his lordship indicated there was a better way but did not specify it - perhaps he was delicately calling for legisla- tion) but it is preferable to the inferred contract view. Lord Denning has, in several post-Gissing decisions, cited Lord Reid's views in support of his own doctrine of family assets but in fact Lord Reid did not commit himself to these views. As has been mentioned, he contented himself with an expres- sion of hope that subsequent cases would employ the imputed agreement approach. Only Lord Pearson made a clear - though brief - commitment to the view that indirect contributions could support an inference of agree- ment for co-ownership and, even if his view be coupled with that of Lord Reid, it is, in the writer's submission, the majority view in Gissing that beneficial interests in matrimonial property will not be acquired on the basis of indirect contributions alone.136 (782g-783f, 788d) 135 Viscount Dilhorne rejected the doctrine of family assets expounded by Lord Denning on the ground that it was synonymous with community of assets (at 785D-F). Since this is, in my view, a false equation it does not follow that Viscount Dilhorne was effectively rejecting the sufficiency of indirect contributions altogether. 136 This submission finds support in the Law Commission's statement of the effect of the</page><page sequence="48">INTER VIVOS MATRIMONIAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN ENGLAND 195 D The quantification of joint interests Some of the judgments in Gissing constitute an important departure from Pettitt and earlier cases in relation to the maxim 'equality is equity.' The traditional view, as represented by Rimmer, was that the court could award half shares unless there was evidence of a contrary agreement, whether the claimant's contributions were small or not. Rimmer had been approved by Lords Morris and Hodson and not disapproved, on the issue of equal division, by the other law lords, in Pettitt. Lord Reid stated in Gissing that if the claimant had made direct contributions the interest acquired thereby would normally be proportionate to the ratio between the contribution and the property's total cost, and that in the case of indirect contributions half-shares would still not automatically result: '... the high sounding brocard "Equality is equity" has been misused. There will of course be cases where a half-share is a reasonable estimation, but there will be many others where a fair estimate might be a tenth or a quarter or some- times even a half.' Whether this 'fair estimate' is to be based solely on the court's ability to evaluate the contribution's worth in monetary terms so as to work out the ratio readily calculable in direct contribution cases or whether it can take into account the history of the marriage so as to make an estimate which is 'fair' because just - and perhaps produce unpredictable results like those in Nixon, Muetzel, and D'Gama - is not clear. Lord Pearson's view leaned towards the former proposition for his lordship pre- ferred proportionate division only where 'it is plain' that the contribution represents a particular proportion of the total purchase price. (782j-3d, 788b-c) Lord Morris was silent on the question of quantification, although in affirming what he said in Pettitt he may be considered to have supported his approval therein for Rimmer. Lord Diplock was careful to distinguish between direct and indirect contributions: the rule governing the former, in the absence of an express or inferred agreement to the contrary, is propor- tionate division whereas in cases where an indirect contribution has been made in addition to the direct one, in the absence of an express or inferred agreement to the contrary, the courts will award half-shares, both as a matter of law under the maxim 'equality is equity' and because the very cases in which indirect contributions are relied on are those where the most probable inference is that the spouses did agree on half-shares. (792i-3c) mIII THE DECISION IN GISSING Their lordships were unanimous in reversing the Court of Appeal's decision in its totality on the basis that Mrs Gissing had not attempted to argue that majority view in Gissing: Working Paper, supra note 8. (Note that Lord Diplock's judgment is cited for this view and cf the discussion supra note 134.) The view also finds support in Bagnall j's detailed analysis of Gissing in Cowcher, supra note 127. (Again, note that Bagnall j attributes the view to four of their lordships and this places Lord Diplock squarely with the majority since it is not his opinions which are cited for the minority view.)</page><page sequence="49">196 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL there was any express agreement that she should receive an interest in the house and all its contents and the evidence did not justify the inference of any such agreement. Lord Reid was content to rely on the view of the facts adopted by the other members of the House. Viscount Dilhorne considered that as there was no evidence of a contribution other than to the family's general finan- cial pool no inference of an agreement for co-ownership was justified. Both Lords Morris and Pearson approved of Buckley j's decision at first instance similarly rejecting any such inference. For Lord Diplock, however, it was not merely the indirect nature of nor the paucity of the wife's contributions which defeated her claim. It was the further fact that because of their nature and paucity there could not be said to have been any causal connec- tion between them and the repayment of the mortgage. Her conduct had not, in reality, helped her husband to acquire the property, therefore, and was not a contribution to that acquisition at all. However, if it be right that on his lordship's general view indirect contributions to the mortgage repay- ments will not justify an inference that co-ownership was intended by both spouses, Mrs Gissing's claim would have failed however great her contri- bution. Perhaps, then, the preferable interpretation of Lord Diplock's over- all thesis is that he gave a qualified rejection of the relevance of indirect contributions standing alone: when they are so substantial that an inference that co-ownership was intended is irresistible, the court will give effect to that inference (a hypothetical example is the case of the disabled husband who receives disability payments which are just sufficient to pay the mortgage instalments when they become due and whose wife maintains the family from day to day by her earnings) but, since such cases are rare, indirect contribu- tions alone will not in practice avail in the majority of matrimonial property disputes. (782a, e-h, 783h, 788d, 791e-5a) 4 The Present Law, Its Problems and Lord Denning's Attempts to Solve Them The preceding analysis of Pettitt and Gissing has led me to the conclusion that it is possible to state the general approach which the House of Lords requires in cases where a spouse with no legal title to matrimonial property claims an interest in it: I / Where there is a deed of conveyance - which there is bound to be in cases involving realty - the court must examine the deed to ascertain whether it makes express provision for the allocation of beneficial interests in the property. 2/ If the conveyance is silent or if there is no conveyance - which is likely in cases involving personalty - the court must determine whether the spouses made any express agreement about their proprietary rights. If they did, either that agreement will have been con- tractual, and its provisions will be positively applied to decide the case, or it will have been non-contractual but will still serve either to generate a trust in the claimant's favour or to rebut any presumption of co-ownership</page><page sequence="50">INTER VIVOS MATRIMONIAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN ENGLAND 197 that might otherwise arise. If it serves in the latter capacity then the dis- pute must be resolved solely by reference to legal title. 3 / In the absence of any express agreement the court must examine the conduct of the spouses throughout the period of acquisition - which includes any period during which outstanding instalments on the purchase price or on a loan to facilitate purchase are being paid off - to determine whether that conduct evinced an intention that the non-owner of the property should acquire an interest in it. If no such intention can be inferred the court has no power to impute any such intention and, again, legal title will be conclusive. If such an intention was evinced then a trust will be held to have arisen therefrom. 4 / Under this trust, and prima facie under any trust arising from express agreement, the spouses will be equitable tenants in common either in propor- tion to their contributions or in equal shares. In matters of detailed application a number of problems are posed by these principles. The first major problem is how the court is to avoid over- stepping the boundary between inference and imputation. If, as Lord Diplock suggested, the court can test one spouse's intentions by reference to the inferences which a reasonable person in the other's position would have drawn from the former's words and conduct, and can add together the separately inferred intentions to form a common intention, it is a short step to the construction of presumptions of intention which overstep the boundary. It is on the basis of just such constructions that the Court of Appeal has based a number of decisions which seem to disregard Pettitt and Gissing to a substantial extent. Since Lord Denning has in several recent judgments referred to Falconer as an authoritative statement of the approach to be adopted it is helpful to look first to that case. In Falconer the Court of Appeal upheld the county court judge's decision that a hus- band was entitled to a half-share in a house built on his wife's land on account of various contributions: payment of ?105 to the builders for extras; inducing his father to stand surety on the mortgage to the wife; and the payment of certain household expenses. The decision that he had acquired an equal interest might have been justified on the basis that the ?105 was a direct contribution to the building costs - which were them- selves paid to the builders as a lump sum - and therefore the other contri- butions, though indirect and hence not sufficient per se to give rise to an equitable interest at all, could be considered in determining the size of the interest generated by the direct payment. The Court of Appeal avoided the necessity for any analysis along such lines by eschewing altogether any distinction between direct and indirect contributions. Lord Denning, pur- porting to 'distil' what had been said in Gissing, stated that the House of Lords had not overruled any of the Court of Appeal's own previous deci- sions in principle but had merely made it clear that the basis upon which one spouse acquires a beneficial interest in the other's property under the doctrine enunciated in those previous decisions was trust doctrine, not con- tract doctrine, the intention to create the trust being 'inferred' or 'im-</page><page sequence="51">198 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL puted'137 from the spouses' conduct and the surrounding circumstances. One fact upon which such an inference or imputation could be based was the making of a contribution, which could be direct or indirect provided only that it was substantial. The Court's own decision in Gissing had been overruled by the House solely on the basis that, as a matter of fact, Mrs Gissing's contributions had not been substantial. If this view of the effect of Gissing, concurred in by Megaw LJ and Sir Frederick Sellers, is correct then it follows that the doctrine of family assets previously enunciated by Lord Denning stands unaffected and that Gissing has worked no practical change in the criteria for resolving matrimonial property disputes, a remarkable conclusion in the light of what was actually said in Gissing. Some indication that this is not the conclusion shared by all Lord Denning's brethren in the Court of Appeal is to be found in Davis v Vale.18s There, the wife claimed an interest in the matrimonial home on the basis, inter alia, of her indirect contribution - in the form of earnings paid into a joint account - to the payment of the deposit. Not only had the spouses reached an express agreement about the division between them of financial responsibility for the payment of the mortgage instalments and the cost of improvement and upkeep, but had done so at a time when marital relations were strained and when, therefore, it might be thought that the wife's participation in the agreement was unlikely to have occurred on any basis save that through it she would acquire proprietary rights. Edmund Davies LJ thought that in the absence of evidence of an express agreement on proprietary rights the case had to be decided by reference to the appropriate inference, which, on this evidence, was that there must have been a common intention that she should acquire an interest. Lord Den- ning, however, considered that the case had to be decided by reference to the statement of law offered by Lord Diplock in Pettitt (41 5B), accord- ing to which the court had to look at the circumstances and the direct and indirect financial contributions of the spouses and had to infer or impute a trust according to what was fair. This interpretation of Lord Diplock's view quite disregards the fact, which Lord Diplock himself later conceded in Gissing, that his view in Pettitt was a minority one precisely because it failed to differentiate between an inference of actual common intention and an imputation of constructive common intention. On Lord Denning's ap- proach there was, of course, no doubt that the wife's claim in Davis v Vale should succeed. Stamp LJ, however, expressed considerable doubt as to the proper outcome of the case. Acknowledging that, as a result of the speeches of Viscount Dilhorne and of Lords Morris and Diplock in Gissing, the court could not impute to the spouses agreements they would have made if they had thought about the matter, and that the question was what agree- ment they actually did make, his lordship was inclined to find for the hus- band because it was unlikely, given the strained marital relations at the 137 The words are used synonymously at 452d-e 138 Supra note 126</page><page sequence="52">INTER VIVOS MATRIMONIAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN ENGLAND 199 material time, that he had agreed to his wife's acquiring an interest. How- ever, he was not prepared to dissent from the view of the facts taken by his brethren. Despite the clash of approach in Davis v Vale it is Lord Denning's view which has continued to dominate the post-Gissing cases. In Hargrave v Newton139 a registrar had held that the wife was entitled to an equal share in the matrimonial home and the family car. She had gone out to work and used her earnings to pay household expenses. She had also met such ex- penses from a reward she had been paid for discovering some of the money stolen in the Great Train Robbery. On this evidence the registrar had based an inference of agreement for half shares in accordance with Lord Diplock's statement in Gissing that an adjustment of contributions to house- hold expenses inferentially referable to an agreement for co-ownership gave rise to a beneficial interest. It has earlier been argued that this statement by Lord Diplock was not intended to suggest that indirect contributions give rise to beneficial interests when standing alone and that, on the contrary, Lord Diplock considered they did not, probably because the making of contributions can be explained in a number of ways without postulating an agreement about the ownership of the home. However, in Hargrave v Newton not only did Lord Denning make this point that indirect contri- butions do not unequivocally point to such an agreement. He proceeded to argue that for this reason the test of referability, correctly attributed to Lord Diplock by the registrar, was a difficult one to apply and should be re- placed by the more simple test: did the wife make a substantial contribu- tion, direct or indirect, to the acquisition of the family's capital assets by making payments out of her own money, or by freeing the husband's funds from the burden of household expenses and making them available for re- payments of the mortgage on the house and the hire purchase instalments on the car? Applying this test he concluded that the registrar's decision had been correct. Similar reasoning was used by Lord Denning in Hazell v Hazell40 to hold a wife who had used her earnings to pay household expenses entitled to an equal share in the home. In this case Megaw LJ employed a somewhat different approach to reach essentially the same ultimate conclusion that wives who enable husbands to pay off mortgages by working and paying household expenses earn rights in the home: when this wife went out to work for the first time a reasonable, sensible husband would necessarily have realised that her intention was to make a contribu- tion towards acquisition and would have treated it as such; this initial intention of the wife's continued for so long as the parties made use of her earnings unless, on the evidence, they had agreed at any time that her earnings should no longer be treated as contributing towards acquisition. 139 Supra note 134 140 Supra note I 18. For another Court of Appeal decision holding a wife entitled to an interest because of contributions to household expenses see Farquharson v Farquharson, (1971) 115 Sol.J. 444 (wife entitled to quarter share because she had received no housekeeping allowance for first two years of marriage).</page><page sequence="53">200 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL Megaw LJ also rejected the contention that it was necessary to show that the husband would have been totally unable to pay off the mortgage had he also borne the full brunt of household expenses: it was sufficient that, as a matter of common sense, the wife ought to be treated as having contributed. Unfortunately, the technicality of the law in this area has severely restricted the role of common sense and this was appreciated by Bagnall j in Cowcher v Cowcher,141 where he undertook an extensive analysis of Pettitt and Gissing on the premise that his judicial task was not to ascertain what was a just outcome to the case but what outcome was required by the House of Lords, and where he criticised Hargrave v Newton for postulating that a wife making general contributions to household expenses acquired an inter- est thereby despite a majority view in Gissing to the contrary.142 Further evidence of Lord Denning's success in resurrecting the doctrine of family assets despite its apparent crucifixion by the House of Lords is offered by several post-Gissing decisions concerning wives who have worked in their husbands' businesses. In Re Cummins143 Lord Denning held that Gissing had not overruled the principles laid down in Nixon and Muetzel41 for such cases, and that these were applicable in an action by a widow against her deceased husband's personal representatives since any property rights she would have acquired under them - and, in Lord Denning's view, she had acquired a half-share - would have been acquired inter vivos."5 In two other cases these same principles were applied although in neither did their application lead to the result sought by the wife. In Simon v Simon146 a wife who had helped to set up a business with her husband and had worked in it once a week thereafter was held not entitled to a half-share in a home bought with the profits of the business and in Heyland v Heyland147 a wife who had been paid a fair wage for her work in the business was held entitled to no interest at all in a home bought from the profits. 141 Supra note 127 I42 One writer, in a note on Hazell, has argued that if the question of property rights is to be decided irrespective of referrability to any inferred agreement between the spouses then any member of the household who has contributed to its expenses and has thereby assisted in the acquisition by one of the spouses of any property should be entitled to an interest in it, and that such a conclusion, and perhaps the arguments by Lord Denning from which it logically flows, is clearly contrary to Gissing: Eekelaar, (1972) 88 Law Q.R. 333. 143 [1971] 3 All E.R. 782 144 Supra note I 14 145 It could be argued that the proper approach to such a case is for the court to suggest that proceedings for family provision out of the deceased spouse's estate be brought because in such proceedings the court enjoys discretion to vary property rights under the Inheritance (Family Provision) Act I938. The Law Commission has stressed the importance of this discretion to the over-all question of family property law in its Working Paper, supra note 8, especially part 3. It is especially important since the discretion conferred by s 4 of the Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Act 1970 cannot be employed once the claimant spouse dies: D(J) v D(S), supra note i 18. 146 (197I) 15 Sol.J. 673 147 The Times, 25 January 1972</page><page sequence="54">INTER VIVOS MATRIMONIAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN ENGLAND 20I Before leaving this aspect of the present law it is important to advert to Lord Denning's most recent pronouncement on the question of matrimonial property rights in Wachtel v Wachtel,'4s for not only did his lordship therein reaffirm his doctrine of family assets: he also invoked the Matri- monial Proceedings and Property Act 1970 in support of that doctrine. His view was that s 5 of that act, in directing the courts to take account inter alia of the contributions made by the spouses to the welfare of the family when dealing with s 4 proceedings for property transfers and settlement variations, had approved and extended the Court of Appeal's holdings over the last twenty-five years: those holdings, from Re Rogers' Question149 to Hazell v Hazell,1o had established that a spouse who contributed to the acqui- sition of the matrimonial home, directly or indirectly, in money or money's worth, acquired a proportionate share in it, but they only applied where the contribution had been a financial one; now, by virtue of s 5, the court was entitled to take account of such non-financial contributions as those made to running the home or rearing the children in order to see whether the home was either acquired or maintained by the spouses' joint efforts, and if it was so acquired or maintained then the claimant spouse would be awarded a joint share in the property. Not only does this view represent an analysis of the court's previous decisions on family assets which takes no heed of Pettitt or Gissing, neither of which Lord Denning mentioned. In my view, it also profoundly misrepresents the effect of ss 4 and 5 of the 1970 act. These provisions do not purport to determine the circumstances in which spouses acquire rights in one another's property independent of judi- cial declaration. They merely define the criteria upon which the court may base a decision to transfer one spouse's property to the other in order to effect, on the breakdown of the marriage, an over-all financial settlement which the court itself regards as just in the circumstances then prevailing. Any rights conferred on a spouse under s 4 - and the court is not bound to confer any - depend on a judicial declaration made at the end of the mar- riage. Yet Lord Denning would read these provisions as both a reaffirmation and an extension of the principle that indirect contributions earn property rights during the marriage without judicial intervention. In fairness to Lord Denning it needs to be repeated that nowhere in Gissing did any of their lordships clearly state the circumstances under which an indirect contribution, standing alone, would support an inference of common intention as to co-ownership, and that the writer's conclusion that the majority holding postulated the insufficiency of such contributions in most cases is one which has been reached only by extremely close reading of the opinions and by a 'head count' based thereon. Moreover, the sug- gestions by three of their lordships in Gissing that a trust may arise on 148 [1973] I All E.R. 829 149 Supra note Io3 15o Supra note I28</page><page sequence="55">202 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL grounds of unconscionability, coupled with the failure to pursue the effect of this suggestion on the details of matrimonial property disputes, does blur the distinction between inference and imputation. This is to some extent demonstrated by Heseltine v Heseltine51' which concerned, inter alia, trans- fers by the wife to the husband, out of her own capital, of ?40,oo000 and ?20,000. The first was made on his advice that it would reduce the duty leviable on her estate should she predecease him. The second was made to enable him to become a Lloyd's insurance underwriter. She had received no independent advice before making either of the transfers and the Court of Appeal held that the husband held the full ?6o,ooo on trust for her. Lord Denning's view, concurred in by Karminski and Megaw LJJ, was that since she had made the transfers not to benefit her husband but, through him, the family, it would be inequitable to allow him to retain the money in the event of marital breakdown, and the way to prevent this inequity was to impose on him a trust along the lines suggested by Lord Diplock in Gissing. It is submitted that the trust so imposed is properly to be regarded as a species of constructive trust notwithstanding the element of actual agree- ment as to the purpose for which the money was to be used: it was the husband's attempt to keep the money while reneging on that agreement which created the inequity on which the imposition of the trust was based. Nevertheless, one unequivocal assertion about the approach to resulting and constructive trusts in Gissing can surely be made by extrapolating from what their lordships said: that branch of constructive trust doctrine which enables the courts to remedy injustice irrespective of the intention of the parties is not to be employed in matrimonial property disputes as the cri- terion for determining what the spouses' rights actually are. Lord Denning has not suggested the contrary but it is instructive to examine his decision in Hussey v Palmerl52 in which the plaintiff had spent ?607 on an exten- sion to her son-in-law's house as an extension to be used as her living quar- ters. In Lord Denning's opinion, although the circumstances negated the suggestion that the expenditure had been a loan recoverable in an action in debt, it could be recovered under a trust enforceable by a monetary judg- ment. This trust should more accurately be described as a constructive trust than a resulting trust, he stated, but the terminology was not material since, whatever its name, the trust was one imposed by law as a restitution remedy whenever justice and good conscience required its imposition, as they did here. Phillimore LJ agreed with the result although he referred to the trust as a resulting trust. Cairns LJ dissented because the evidence showed that the plaintiff had regarded the expenditure as a loan and a loan is incon- sistent with a resulting trust. This case involved a classical resulting trust situation: where money is expended by the plaintiff on property vested in the defendant an inference arises that some right in the property has been 151 Supra note 84 152 Supra note 129</page><page sequence="56">INTER VIVOS MATRIMONIAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN ENGLAND 203 acquired. It is this same doctrine, combined with the presumption of advancement, that has traditionally been applied to matrimonial property disputes. If the doctrine can be replaced by a much broader one in cases not involving matrimonial property there seems no logical reason why it cannot similarly be replaced in cases which do involve such property, espe- cially since Pettitt and Gissing both postulate that the principles governing the latter cases are the same as those governing the former and that only the application differs. Yet such a replacement is clearly precluded and if logical reasoning suggests the contrary this indicates that the role of logic in resolving matrimonial property disputes has become severely circumscribed by judicial pronouncements. The second main problem arising under the present law concerns the concept of the contribution. As has been seen, it is necessary for the court to determine when a contribution is 'direct' but this is not always a straight- forward task. Supposing, for example, that Mrs Falconer had not already owned the land when the mortgage was raised to pay for the house: could the husband's ?k105 payment have been regarded as a direct contribution to the land itself? The court must also determine whether or not any con- tribution was 'substantial.' Is it the case, as Lord Diplock intimated in Gissing, that if the direct contributions are substantial any accompanying indirect ones need not be? And how is substantiality to be tested when it is relevant? Is a direct contribution to a deposit to be tested by reference to the total deposit or to the total price of the property including interest under the mortgage? Is taking a paying guest or raising a loan from a friend or pur- suading a relative to stand surety really a substantial contribution? Does the answer depend, as Lord Diplock implied, on whether or not the con- tribution really assists the recipient in paying the purchase price, and if so does an act like raising a loan, though not itself assisting the actual repay- ment of the loan, assist sufficiently in the acquisition achieved by means of borrowed funds? Or does the answer depend, as Lord Denning intimated in Grzeczkowski v Jedynska1e3 on whether or not, by analogy with the 'improve- ment' cases, the contribution was or was not of a kind reasonably to be expected from any normal spouse, and if so why is a wife like Mrs Muetzel, who looks after a paying guest in the matrimonial home, making a substan- tial contribution while a husband who keeps that guest's accounts, as in Grzeczkowski itself, is not regarded as so doing? Thirdly, there is the question of when the court can infer an agreement for co-ownership from indirect contributions standing alone. If Lord Den- ning's approach in Falconer and Davis v Vale is correct then the court can continue to make any inferences it could have made under the pre-Gissing doctrine of family assets but it has been argued that the true position, if Gissing is read closely, is that it is only in exceptional circumstances that indirect contributions alone will justify an inference of intended co-owner- 153 Supra note 81</page><page sequence="57">204 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL ship. The problem can arise in three basic situations. There may be an indirect contribution to the mortgage instalments: is it essential, before the inference can be drawn, to establish that but for the contributions the re- cipient could not have both paid the instalments and maintained the family?154 There may be indirect contributions to the deposit: this raises the same problem. Or there may be indirect contributions to the accumula- tion of a fund out of which the disputed property is acquired outright, as in Nixon, or a deposit put down on it, as in Davis v Vale: is the contribution to be regarded as a direct one which, provided regular and substantial, generates a beneficial interest; as an indirect one which does not; or as one which, whether direct or indirect, substantial or trivial, regular or once- and-for-all, had a genuine causal link with the acquisition? And what, precisely, is the distinction, the existence of which Lord Denning intimated in Davis v Vale, between an indirect contribution made in the 'initial' stages of the acquisition of the disputed property and one made at a subse- quent stage. Finally - and, in terms of the frequency with which it is likely to arise, more importantly - there is the problem of quantification. Nixon, Muetzel, and D'Gama, it has been suggested, demonstrated the unpredictable and arbitrary results which can flow if the court is to attempt a quantification in proportion to the size of indirect contributions, and such results can still flow under Gissing - in those cases when indirect contributions are relevant - for when a court juxtaposes the judgments in Pettitt and Gissing it will discover that it has three alternative bases of division, the choice between which is the most significant matter on which the House failed to achieve substantial agreement in either of the two cases: proportionate division when the value of the contributions can truly be calculated in money terms but otherwise equal division; proportionate division when all the circum- stances indicate that equal division would not be just; or proportionate division when an intention to that effect can be inferred and equal division when the contrary intention has been evinced. Moreover, the position with regard to direct contributions is far from clear: in Gissing the majority favoured proportionate division yet Lord Morris, in Gissing and Pettitt, and Lord Upjohn in Pettitt, approved of the preference for equal division ex- pressed in cases like Rimmer. The approach to the question of quantification adopted by the Court of Appeal in its post-Gissing decisions only serves to compound these uncer- tainties. Lord Denning's view in Falconer was that Gissing has established that 'It is not in every case that the parties hold in equal shares. Regard must be had to their respective contributions. This confirms the practice of this court. In quite a few cases we have not given half and half but some- thing different.' What his lordship omitted to state was that the cases he 154 As has been mentioned, Megaw LJ answered this last question in the negative in Hazell, supra note 128</page><page sequence="58">INTER VIVOS MATRIMONIAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN ENGLAND 205 was referring to - Nixon, Muetzel, and D'Gama in particular - were cases of indirect contributions, the decisions in which demonstrated how inher- ently unsuited the facts of such cases can be to a realistic proportionate division such as the over-all majority in Pettitt and Gissing, taken together, appeared to favour. Conversely, the facts of Falconer were susceptible to such a division. The husband's payment to the builders had a fixed liqui- dated value and his contributions to family expenses had been proved at ? I o per week for fifteen months and ?5 per week for a further five months. He had then paid half the instalments direct to the mortgagees and there- after ceased all payments. Yet the court upheld an award of equal shares, disregarding the manifest simplicity of calculating realistic proportionate shares, and arguing that the period during which he had ceased payments should be disregarded since during that period his wife had had the benefit of having sole use of the house (but only because he had left her) so that their respective shares 'balanced out.' A similar failure to make a propor- tionate division occurred in Heseltine. An aspect of the wife's claim in that case not already mentioned related to the matrimonial home. The husband had raised a mortgage on it and had taken out an endowment policy on his life to cover the mortgage repayments. At the time of the wife's MWPA S 17 application the house had increased in value from ?8,750 to ?19,000 and the policy was worth ?7,000. The husband conceded that four-fifths of the total purchase price had been paid by his wife. Lord Denning considered that in such a typical case the Court of Appeal would normally impute a trust under which the spouses enjoyed equal beneficial interests but it would, under Gissing, adopt some division other than half-half if such division were 'fair.'"" Here the registrar's award of a quarter-share to the husband was fair because one quarter of the value of the house plus the value of the endowment policy gave him an interest 'not far off half-half.' It is respect- fully submitted that if Pettitt and Gissing establish anything at all they estab- lish that spouses are not to be declared entitled to property rights on the basis of what is fair, what 'balances out' or what approximates to a just out- come. If proportionate division is possible it should be made and it was possible here. If it is not possible then the proper quantification is half- shares because, in default of any other criteria, the maxim 'equality is equity' will apply. Indeed, Megaw LJ indicated a preference on the facts for a four- fifths/one-fifth division and had the wife cross-appealed against the registrar's division he might well have dissented. (Hazell, at 959b-f) Nevertheless, this view of the court's powers to adjust property rights is one which Lord Denning has adhered to. In Cracknell v Cracknel156" the husband paid off the mortgage on a house which the court regarded as having been acquired by equal direct contributions. The final payments were made after the wife had left him. Lord Denning posited a distinction 155 To similar effect see his judgment in Latimer v Latimer, (1970) 114 Sot.]. 973 156 [197I] 3 All E.R. 552</page><page sequence="59">206 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL between the tasks of deciding what the spouses' property rights are and of taking accounts between them: in performing the first task the court looks to their respective contributions and has no regard to the rights and wrongs of separation but in performing the second task that matter could be con- sidered. If Mr Cracknell had driven his wife out then his mortgage pay- ments would have been regarded as a substitution for rent in respect of his occupation of her half of the house, but as she had voluntarily left him he was entitled to credit for the payments. It is respectfully submitted that such an approach confuses three issues: A / does a spouse have a beneficial interest in the other's property and if so how large an interest; B / how should the court's discretion as to remedies be exercised in giving effect to that interest; and c / if the interest is to be enforced by ordering the owner to pay the claimant a sum commensurate with the latter's interest then should the due sum be set off against sums due from the claimant to the owner in formulating a final order? In Cracknell the only claim related to the house; the mortgage payments had completed the process of acquiring the house; therefore it was a matter of fact that the husband had contri- buted more than the wife; consequently, under principles of proportionate division applicable to issue (A), he was entitled to a larger interest than she was; the only meaningful remedy to enforce their respective interests was to order the proceeds of sale to be distributed in proportion to these inter- ests, because the denial of such an order would abnegate their rights (the case being different from a dispute over possession) ; there were no accounts to be taken between the parties, and therefore issue (c) did not arise, be- cause the only claim concerned the home and the only relevance of the mortgage payments lay in their causal relationship to acquisition of the home; in any case, set-offs are calculated and accounts taken by arithmetic- ally balancing out competing claims, not by making the kind of value judgment about the parties' actions which might be employed in an appli- cation under s 4 of the Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Act. A decision equally difficult to reconcile with Pettitt and Gissing is Cooke v Head.' 7 In that case Lord Denning held that the modern approach to a matrimonial property dispute is to assess the shares of the parties at the time they separate and that this same approach should be employed in a dispute between a man and his mistress over the home they set up together in contemplation of future marriage. Lord Denning relied on a statement in Lord Diplock's judgment in Gissing (793e) that spouses who have impliedly agreed to the wife acquiring an interest in the home will often have further agreed that this interest would not be quantified until the mortgage was repaid or the property disposed of. In the light of Lord Diplock's other remarks it is suggested that this passage can be interpreted in one or both of two ways. First, it can mean that the spouses will not have agreed, in most cases, as to how much the wife's interest is actually worth in 157 [1972] 2 All E.R. 38</page><page sequence="60">INTER VIVOS MATRIMONIAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN ENGLAND 207 monetary terms and that the court may therefore base its adjudication on the value of the property at the time of the dispute. Second, it can mean - and since the first meaning poses so obvious a point, it is suggested that the second meaning was the intended one - that the spouses may often agree to share the property when it first comes into their possession but may also agree to postpone determining the size of their respective shares until the process of acquisition of the property is completed, by which time there may have been conduct indicating an intention that the wife's initial share should be expanded, and in such a case the court may take this conduct into account in quantifying the interests. The passage cannot, however, mean that the court, in making its quantification, can take into account all the circumstances that have developed down to the time of trial including the parties' respective responsibility for marital breakdown. Such a propo- sition would be inconsistent with the fundamental point about s 17 estab- lished by Pettitt and Gissing. Yet it is just such a proposition which Lord Denning seems, in Cracknell, to be attributing to Lord Diplock and to be asserting himself. If he is, then his position is inconsistent with his approach in Hazell,'58 in which a husband who had continued mortgage payments for five years after his wife left him and her contributions ceased was awarded a four-fifths share, not on grounds of her culpability in leaving him (contrast Cracknell), nor as a matter of the exercise of a discretion to meet the circumstances (contrast Cooke v Head), but because this proportion reflected the actual causal connection between his payments and the final acquisition of title to the house. On the question of quantification the interesting contribution by Bagnall j in Cowcher'"9 may be noted. His lordship's argument may be summarized thus: under Pettitt and Gissing resulting trust principles govern actions between spouses in the same way that they govern disputes between strangers; under those principles, when A contributes ?4,000 to the price of a house and B contributes ?8,ooo and the land is conveyed to A, then A holds on a one-third/two-thirds resulting trust in the absence of contrary intention; where A is a husband and B is a wife, the task of the court is to determine whether some express or inferred agreement was made displacing this one-third/two-thirds allocation; in the absence of express agreement, the kind of inferred agreement the court is looking for is not an agreement directly dealing with the size of the respective shares (= 'interest consen- sus') because no such agreement would come about other than by an express transaction creating an express trust; rather, the court is looking for an agreement as to the proportions in which the spouses would regard each of them as contributing (= 'money consensus'); in the simple case of a couple which has consistently applied a system of all purchases out of a common fund it is proper to infer an agreement between the parties that 158 Supra note 128 159 Supra note 27</page><page sequence="61">208 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL each would regard the other as contributing equally but in most cases, using the 'officious bystander test'160 properly, it is not possible to infer any money consensus and thus the resulting trust presumption of interests pro- portionate to contributions will apply. It will be noted that this argument is only relevant to a case where the claimant spouse is relying solely on direct contributions because only in such cases is true proportional calcula- tion possible. In cases involving indirect contributions such calculation is often not possible and if the principle of equal division is disregarded as a ready solution to the problem of quantification in such cases - as Gissing holds - then the court can only act on approximations. Lord Denning's approach, whether consistent with Pettitt and Gissing or not, does at least offer some hope of preserving a clear boundary between approximation and arbitrariness. Of course, it is essential to bear in mind that the court may not be called upon only to declare and quantify the existing rights in the property. It may also be asked to readjust those rights under s 4 of the Matrimonial Proceed- ings and Property Act I970. When it is, it is no longer obliged to attempt approximation of the size of the parties' contributions to the acquisition of the disputed property, for it is entitled to base an order under s 4 on all the factors mentioned under s 5, including contributions made to the welfare of the family, the respective needs of the parties, and a number of other considerations relating to matters other than the means by which any par- ticular family asset was acquired. Moreover, in looking to the contributions made to the welfare of the family, it would find it difficult, perhaps impos- sible, to draw any precise link between such contributions and the purchase of the particular asset, for the claimant spouse's role in running the home and rearing the children may have had little or no connection with the payment of the purchase price. In dealing with such cases it seems desirable, therefore, that the courts should develop some guidelines, akin to the maxim 'equality is equity,' for use as a starting point in determining the appro- priate order, since there are no hard figures available to the parties and their legal advisers as a basis for negotiation or for predicting the outcome of litigation. In Wachtel v Wachtel"6' Lord Denning provided such guide- lines, one obtaining in the case where the s 4 proceeding in relation to matrimonial property is not accompanied by a claim under any other provision of the 1970 act for financial support out of the other spouse's income, the other obtaining where the s 4 claim is so accompanied. Both apply without regard to the role of the claimant spouse in the marital break- down unless that role was so pronounced as to make it unacceptable to impose a burden of support on the other. Both also apply without regard to the prospects of remarriage of the claimant spouse. In the case where that spouse seeks a share solely in the other's capital assets then, according to Lord Denning, it will generally be appropriate to divide the assets equally I6o See note 62 supra 16 i Supra note 148</page><page sequence="62">INTER VIVOS MATRIMONIAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN ENGLAND 209 between the parties. In the case where the claimant is also seeking financial support, equal division would be too generous and so the appropriate award will usually be one which gives the claimant a one-third share in the assets and an amount of financial support representing one third of the combined earnings of both spouses. Although his lordship emphasized that these figures were not inflexible rules but merely rebuttable presumptions of fair- ness, he gave no clue to the circumstances in which they would be varied and in fact applied them to the particular parties whose situation he charac- terised as a typical one. 5 The Law Commission's Tentative Reform Proposals The Commission's Working Paper162 contains detailed and wide-ranging proposals. In addition to the issues of ownership and occupation of the matrimonial home and rights in household goods, the paper addresses itself to the need for reform of family provision and intestate succession legisla- tion. Since all the proposals are thus far only tentative it is hoped that a summary of those proposals relevant to the present inquiry will do justice to the Commission's exhaustive work. I SOME GENERAL PREMISES ABOUT THE PRESENT LAW OF INTER VIVOS PROPERTY RIGHTS The Commission finds the present law unsatisfactory on a number of counts: A / It does not constitute a special body of doctrine based on a recognition of the unique nature of the marital relationship but rests on the basic postulate that each spouse's property is individually owned under general property law; B / This is a source of fundamental unfairness to women, because the present, and probable future, socio-economic role of many wives precludes them from making the kinds of contribution neces- sary to acquire rights in property vested in their husbands under that gen- eral law; c / There is a lack of basic certainty both as to the applicable rules and as to their appropriate application to events occurring over a long period of time; D / The discretionary rights conferred on the courts by the Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Act do not adequately mitigate the unfairness and uncertainty: they can only be exercised when the marriage has broken down and they necessitate litigation. Moreover, they create, so long as present property principles govern, an unacceptable anomaly: a spouse is better protected when divorced than when married. II REFORM OF THE MATRIMONIAL HOMES ACT 1967 This Act was discussed briefly in the introduction.'" The Commission pro- poses to reform the law applicable during the currency of the marriage by 162 Supra note 8 and the text thereto x63 Supra note Io. The opinions mentioned in the following paragraph of text are all cited in that note.</page><page sequence="63">210 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL reversing the holdings in three of these cases: A / A spouse not in occupa- tion should be entitled to register the statutory right to take possession with judicial leave before the application for such leave has been made. In fact, since the paper was published, the Court of Appeal has held that the spouse is so entitled under the present law (in Watts v Waller), and its opinion seems to have gone further than the Commission itself recommended, for whereas the paper's proposal would have limited the right to register to those cases where the spouse had instituted proceedings to obtain the necessary judicial order, the court's opinion does not seem so limited; B / When the occupation rights of the spouse not protected by the 1967 act arise under a statutory tenancy created by the Rent Acts, the protected spouse's occupation rights should no longer automatically terminate when, by the terms of the Rent Acts, the statutory tenancy ends. Rather, the courts should be empowered to order occupation by the protected spouse to continue under the 1967 act on application. This proposal would reverse the direct effect of the deci- sion in Penn v Dunn although it would leave unaffected the wider implica- tion of that decision that 1967 Act occupation rights automatically termin- ate in all cases where the other spouse's rights cease before the end of the marriage; c / When a mortgagee whose incumbrance has been registered earlier than a 1967 act occupation right seeks to assert his priority by insti- tuting judicial possession proceedings he should be required to notify the protected spouse in occupation of the proceedings and the latter should have the right to apply for an order enabling the occupation to continue. This proposal would reverse the direct effect of the decision in Hastings &amp; Thanet B.S. v Goddard, although it would leave unaffected the wider implication of that decision that in no case where a prior incumbrancer seeks to enforce his charge is the protected spouse entitled to notice or to apply for a con- tinuation-of-occupation order. However, both in Goddard and in Penn v Dunn the legal question arose in the context it is most likely to arise in again and, while not addressed to the wider implications, the Commission's proposals would in effect foreclose the question for the future for most purposes. The Commission also advocates reform in regard to the position on di- vorce or nullity: A / The court's powers under the Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Act should be extended to enable it to deal directly with the statutory occupation rights; B / Its powers, under the present act, to trans- fer a statutory tenancy under the Rent Acts from one spouse to the other should be extended to all tenancies of property within the Rent Act rate- able value limits even though some of these are in fact excluded from Rent Act protection. The House of Lords' decision in Tarr v Tarr that a court cannot make an order under the 1967 act wholly excluding the owning spouse from occu- pation was delivered after publication of the paper. The Commission does indicate satisfaction with the Court of Appeal's contrary decision in that</page><page sequence="64">INTER VIVOS MATRIMONIAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN ENGLAND 21 I case and it seems probable that the Commission's final report will advocate restoration of that Court's view. III REFORM OF OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN THE MATRIMONIAL HOME The Commission sees four possible alternative bases for reform: A / regis- tration of co-ownership: this is rejected because there can be no guaranty that all spouses will register, however strong the incentives; B / a system of judicial discretion: this is rejected because its operation requires litigation and it generates a risk of substantial uncertainty; c / a presumption of co- ownership: this is rejected because it raises too many questions calling for arbitrary answers - on what grounds should the presumption be rebuttable; how should it affect third parties; should it only apply to the last home; how could it be enforced against the proceeds of sale of the home; D / automatic co-ownership: this is the alternative for which the Commission tentatively opts as providing the best solution for the largest number of cases. The Commission's system of automatic co-ownership would have, inter alia, the following characteristics: i / It would apply whether title is vested in one spouse or both; ii / It would apply whether the spouses, if legal co- owners, are joint tenants or tenants in common; iii / It would apply to free- hold and leasehold property; iv / It would apply to property acquired by one of the spouses before marriage except where acquired by gift or in- heritance; v / It would presumptively apply to each home acquired with the proceeds of sale of the first; vi / It would apply unless the spouses ex- cluded it by a written contract signed by both; vii / It would take effect under a 'matrimonial home trust' which would replace the present trust for sale.'" The spouses would have direct equitable interests in the property rather than postponed interests in the proceeds of sale; viii / The equitable interest would be capable of protection by registration, by application to the courts for an order vesting legal title in both spouses and by requiring a vendor of a home to declare a matrimonial home trust in favour of both spouses; ix / If legal title is vested in one spouse, he or she could not dis- pose of the property without the other's consent; x / The equitable interests under the trust would not be alienable to third parties; xi / On marital breakdown the trust's purpose would be ended and the court could make any appropriate order in the exercise of its powers under s 4 of the Matri- monial Proceedings and Property Act 1970. It will be seen that these proposals would replace the presumption of advancement, the doctrines of resulting and constructive trusts, and the maxim that 'equality is equity.' It would no longer be necessary to infer or impute intent because the only relevant intent would be one to exclude the 164 For comment on this aspect of the proposal see Gareth Miller, (1972) 36 Conveyancer (n.s.) 99, at II I.</page><page sequence="65">212 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL system and a written signed contract would surely adequately evince the requisite exclusionary contractual intention. IV REFORM OF THE LAW GOVERNING HOUSEHOLD GOODS The Commission considers that automatic co-ownership would not be a practicable system because of the number of household goods owned by one or other spouse at any one time. It considers that the real need is for a law which protects the use and enjoyment of the non-owner and endeavours to draw an analogy from the Matrimonial Homes Act 1967 in formulating such a law: the courts would have powers to make orders regarding con- tinued use and enjoyment of household goods similar to those it can make in relation to occupation of the matrimonial home under the 1967 act; on judicial termination of the marriage the court's powers under the Matri- monial Proceedings and Property Act 1970 would include powers to make orders with regard to use and enjoyment of household goods; a spouse in occupation of the matrimonial home would be entitled to continue use and enjoyment of the household goods until a court otherwise ordered; and a number of provisions would deal with the situation where a third party has an interest in the goods by virtue of a consumer credit transaction. In my view these proposals are somewhat disappointing.16' First, the definition of 'household goods' excludes a number of items of personalty such as bank accounts and investments. Secondly, rights of use and enjoy- ment would be inapposite to such items as are fungible, again like accounts and investments. Thirdly, such items may be of substantial value and estab- lishing ownership may be far more important to the spouses than the asser- tion of a right of use. This applies not just to choses in action like accounts and investments, but to choses in possession like the family car. The Com- mission recognises that the car may often be a substantial asset and there- fore proposes that most of its recommendations should apply to the car even though it is not part of the 'household goods' but Hargrave v Newton"eS shows that there is the same need to reform the law governing ownership of the car as there is with regard to the home, since it is the same law which is now determining ownership of both. V PROPOSALS REGARDING A REGIME OF COMMUNITY ASSETS The Commission divides possible community of assets systems into three categories: full community; community of gains; and deferred community. Under the latter system, each spouse is free to acquire and dispose of prop- erty individually during the marriage but there is a sharing in post-nuptial I65 Kahn-Freund, who regards the Working Paper as a whole as the most significant contribution to the question of reform of English matrimonial property law, and the proposal for co-ownership of the home as thoroughly commendable, also finds the treatment by the paper of the rights in personalty, especially 'liquid' assets, disappoint- ing: (1972) 35 Modern L.R. 403. I66 Supra note 134</page><page sequence="66">INTER VIVOS MATRIMONIAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN ENGLAND 213 acquisitions at the end of the marriage. Of the three possible systems this one alone, the paper argues, could be adapted for England because it re- tains the notion of separate property rights during the marriage which is so deeply embedded in English property jurisprudence. The system would differ from that of co-ownership proposed in the earlier section of the paper in that, under the latter, the non-owner would acquire a beneficial interest in the home immediately on marriage rather than an interest in all matrimonial property at the end of marriage. The paper reviews the position in several countries which have adopted deferred community or are likely so to do. Of special interest to the readers of this Journal will probably be the discussion of the new law in Quebec"'7 and of the Ontario Law Reform Commission's proposals.'68 The paper also notes that a majority of the members of the Royal Commission on Marriage and Divorce, 1951-5, decided against the adoption of such a system in England,9es and acknowledges that deferred community rests on universally applicable rules which leave no room for special treatment of particular cases, such as that of the spouse who contributes no post-nuptial acquisi- tions to the family pool and thus acquires a 'windfall' under the system. The paper also appreciates that many may find any such system an un- acceptably radical departure from established property jurisprudence but sees a number of advantages to the system which might persuade others of its worth: it gives full expression to the partnership element in marriage; it offers security because it excludes discretion and does not require litiga- tion for it to operate; and it is more in harmony with the developing social ethos according to which each party to a broken marriage should be en- couraged to become self-reliant as soon after termination as possible. Ac- cordingly, while the paper reaches no fixed conclusion as to the desirability of implementing a deferred community system, it advances a set of principles on the basis of which, it believes, such a system could be made effective. In essence the proposal is this: subject to express agreement to the contrary, the spouse who has contributed less to total post-nuptial acquisitions would have a right to share in all such acquisitions when the marriage ends on death or judicial termination; during the marriage each spouse would treat individual acquisitions as separate property but at the end of it the right to share would be enforced through an equalization claim, by which the 167 Stats Que. 1969, c 77, discussed at 266 of the working paper i68 Family Law Project, Property Subjects 1967, revised 1969, noted by Eekelaar in (I969) 32 Modern L.R. 678 and discussed in the Working Paper at 274. As of 31 March 1972 a final report had not been submitted but work on it was still in progress: Ontario Law Reform Commission, Fifth Annual Report 1971, para 48. The 1969 proposals would introduce a system of deferred community almost precisely as described by the Working Paper, but they also call for further consideration of the merits of a system of automatic co-ownership of the home rather than a mere balancing claim. 169 The Royal Commission's arguments against the introduction of a community system are summarized in the Working Paper at 275-7.</page><page sequence="67">214 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL smaller contributor would receive a sum of money sufficient to ensure that the over-all value of post-nuptial acquisitions is equally shared; the claim would not lie against any particular asset in rem although particular items may necessarily have to be sold to raise sufficient funds to meet the claim. The Commission's next report will probably indicate the reception these proposals received from the legal profession170 but it must, finally, be noted that the suggestion for a principle of co-ownership of the home is a definite one and should, according to the Law Commission's views as at the date of the working paper, be implemented even if deferred community were rejected. 6 Conclusion In terms of the criteria announced at the outset of this inquiry the present law is sadly deficient. Seven law lords, in two major House of Lords decisions, have failed to resolve a number of important questions of principle and have created others. The Court of Appeal's attempts to provide answers that would offer both doctrinal certainty and substantive justice have, in several respects, rendered nugatory those aspects of the House of Lords' rulings which do seem clear, have in other respects disregarded the spirit of those holdings and have handed down a number of decisions which, on the basis of their results, suggest to the practitioner that an unacceptable degree of unpredictability besets his efforts to give sound advice and work out settlements which achieve justice within the substantive law while still avoiding the unpleasantness of an acrimonious open squabble between parties who were once on intimate terms. Apart from the specific problems already detailed, there still remains uncertainty on a number of points of potentially great significance, such as the exact scope of MWPA S 17, the present status of the presumption against contractual intention, the opera- tion of the presumptions of resulting trust and advancement and the juri- dical relation between resulting and constructive trusts. The Law Commis- sion's proposals would go a long way towards providing a set of coherent principles for inter vivos matrimonial property law and legislation to imple- ment them, and effectively complete the recent reform of English matri- monial law, is a matter of urgent necessity. I earnestly hope that such legis- lation is drafted soon, that it will extend beyond the matrimonial home to all matrimonial property, and that it will thereby accord to the marital relationship the special treatment it requires. But I also hope, with equal earnestness, that such legislation is not seen as a panacea that will cure all the malaises of the present law: the general questions, about substantive doctrines of trust and contract and about procedural machinery like s 17, which this inquiry has sought to highlight, must be directly addressed be- cause any new law of automatic co-ownership of the home or community of all assets will not alone solve them. 17o For a strong argument in favour of community of assets from an academic lawyer see Kahn-Freund, 'Matrimonial Property: Where do we go from here?'
