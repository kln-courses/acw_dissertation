<plain_text><page sequence="1">36_THE CBAYON._ SUNDAY. DR. hessey's bampton lectures. There can be no better evidence of the pro gressive nature of social life than to see every doctrine, institution and ordinance of man's crea tion mercilessly submitted to the ordeal of dis cussion. The chaotic tossings and vicissitudes to which we are all doomed, instinctively lead us to seek some unchangeable power to which we can safely bind ourselves. When the social ship- | wrecks are over and the rainbow of j&gt;eace is seen glittering above us, we fancy we are at last on the immovable rock, and free from all future dis turbance, never thinking that constant change is the veiy condition of existence, and the only door open to a better future. The search for infallibility, though useful, perhaps indispensable relatively to time, place and human condition, is yet vain, absolutely considered, and is gradually given up as we advance in intelligence as to the real laws of our terrestrial condition. Catholicism was safe in the infallibility of the church until the abstract power of thought began to split up the church into its constituent particles, then even the assumption of inspiration from heaven as to this infallibility failed to check the decay of human belief in this great article of faith. The theo logical iiTuption of the sixteenth century dimin ished it numerically to such an extent as to set aside in great measure the institutional inforce ment of it. Hence its present lingering condi tion in the impoverished brains of those who have received it traditionally. But Protestantism felt mentally houseless and homeless without something to correspond to it, without something to fill in the void created by disbelief in it. We have, therefore, its successor in Biblical infallibility, which, logically considered, is inferior to it as a creation of thought, and as a controller and regulator of social forces. Yet while the former brought together and gave unity in action to the scattered and broken frag ments of a newly growing society in western Europe, the latter is equally true to its nature in effecting unity of thought through the medium of languages. Languages, as the instruments of thought, must, if we would attain to dogmatic unity, undergo a thorough mental reformation quite analogous in another order to the successive reformations ?o necessary to all temporal institu tions governing our actions. To the uninstructed, naturally feeble, and defi cient brain nothing is more despotic, confusing and misleading than the inheritance of an arbi trary theological nomenclature. Now, the Biblir cal source of the Protestants' infallibility renders this nomenclature exceedingly formidable, and could not but engender the most searching inves tigations into the origin, nature, and meaning of language. If to Germany we owe the systematic institution of Protestantism, we are equally in debted to it for the modern origination of the comparative study of languages, so far forth at least as this may lead to a real science of language. The doctrinal teachings of theology can alone be perpetuated through the arbitrary meanings of words, as there is nothing in the natural order of things conformable to the meaning of theological terms as now used. But may it not be possible to recast theological terms, and to detect in them their natural meanings, as contradistinguished from their supernatural, and in this way force them into instruments of scientific inquiry ? We believe this will be accomplished by the more advanced thinkers coming from the bosom of Protestantism itself. The continental writers of Europe have opened out so many new paths in hermeneutics, that they cannot but yield to the current put in motion by themselves, no matter how different the consequences may be from what they expected or foresaw. This will lead to a reconstruction of theological terms, and, as a natural consequence, of -theological beliefs. Now all this, though destructive and hurtful to inherited partialities, yet it must be yielded to as the only condition through which we can ever arrive at unity of belief and unity of action, and escape from social anarchy. We must now turn our attention to the admi rable work of. Dr. Hessey, which has suggested these reflections. His eight lectures on Sunday, its origin, history, and present obligation, fill a void in English literature if not a void in the Eng lish mind, and must lead to a more liberal view of this important day. The primitive man hav ing felt the necessity of a supernatural sanction for all his customs, it is difficult for the modern man, while believing in this sanction, to account for the changes wrought by society through time in all these customs. The power sanctioning is believed to be immutable, and this immutability is sought to be grafted upon everything supposed to descend from this power to man. Now it is from this theological mesh that Dr. Hessey seeks to escape in vindicating our Sunday from the ce remonial rites peculiar to the seventh-day Sabbath of the Jews, and in maintaining the right of Christianity in substituting the first day of the week, for the seventh. By this free and sponta neous act of society, the fourth commandment was set aside as belonging to an old order of</page><page sequence="2">_THE CRAYON. 37 things, notwithstanding its supposed supernatural sanction. In the course of time the profanum vulgus?the procreated scum of our kind?sought to desecrate our Sunday, to turn it into a day of revelry and debauchery, as they seek to turn everything else. Those who undertook its de fence and the maintenance of its spiritual integrity were good in intention but feeble in logic. In stead of finding a demonstration of its sanctity in the moral laws of man and society, they fell back upon the Judaic command, thereby trying to force the amplified present into the narrow past, and subordinating the New to the Old Testament. The folly of this is ably set forth by Dr. Hessey, though he is but too often hampered in doing so by an adherence to the requirements of his call ing. Well may Dr. Mansell say, " The history of mankind in general, as well as the conscious ness of each individual, alike testify that religion is not a function of thought ; and that the attempt to make it so, if consistently carried out, neces sarily leads, firstly to Anthropomorphism, and ultimately to Atheism." To this we may add that religion is the spontaneous creation of all that is divine in man, and institutionally reacts most beneficially upon him. Dr. Hessey thus opens out the nature of his undertaking : And now I pass on to observe that this tendency of the human mind to invest comparatively modern things with the sanctions and associations of the past, is disco verable in its treatment of institutions ; in its treatment, especially, of that Divine and Apostolical Institution, I mean " the Lord's Day," which (I trust not rashly, but rather as one treading on holy ground) I have under taken to examine in such a place and before such an assembly. My excuse for doing so will be found in the following considerations. I believe that great confusion of thought exists on this deeply important subject, and that the institution in question, though sufficiently ve nerable in itself, has been regarded as identical with, instead of at the most analogous to, one of greater anti quity indeed, but of more limited applications, the Sab bath of the Fourth Commandment. I believe that from this confusion have arisen not merely misapprehensions of a speculative nature, but errors affecting practice, and productive of misunderstandings, among brethren. I see that the result has been, on the part of the more learned clergy, an avoidance of a topic which they can not treat of logically and historically without being ex posed to obloquy, and which they cannot treat of popu larly without apologizing to their self-respect and sense of duty. On the part of the better-informed laity, a distaste for a doctrine, which, treated (as it generally is) illogically and with want of historical precision, they condemn, together with its advocates, and dismiss, summarily, either as a clumsy artifice, or as a burden too heavy to be borne. But I see, further, that this was not always so; that there was a time when KvpiaKi) and Za??arov, respectively, had their meanings accurately and sharply defined. Hence, I venture to hope that an attempt to re-state those meanings, and to clear up cer tain difficulties connected with them, may not be alto gether in vain. Thus religious progress seems to be made, by those nursed and brought up within the bo som of Episcopalianism rather than by those in the ranks of Evangelicanism and Unitarian ism. The deistical tendency of the latter seems to check it in the same way that Judaism was checked. It mounts the ladder of the unknown to such an altitude that the past closes behind it, and the future is veiled in impenetrable mist. It mentally staggers and quietly yields to a theological euthanasia. The former degenerates more and more into a narrow Puritanism, a scro fulous uniformity, an idealess twang of cant which excludes the possibility of human growth and development, the possibility of the future being any more than a consumptive repetition of the past. It sinks the outswelling impulses of advanc j ing humanity in the mechanical echo of the indi vidual, and beats down the beautiful aspirations of youth to the torpidity of pulseless old age. Unita rianism may be suited to the non-progressive beats of the mental pendulum, evangelicanism to the crusty respectability of commercial and trading catharists, to material enterprises ending in self; but neither the one nor the other can cast a flood of light upon the past, nor add overflowing streams to the great ocean of the future. Dwarfed in childhood by their negative nature, they were never destined in the order of things 'to a com plete manhood. The following picture from Dr. Hessey, of Puritanism, is the best commentary on ^ its nature that we can offer : As long ago as a. d. 1607, various Independents had fled from England to Holland, finding their non-confor mity expose them to hardships. Here they set up what they termed "the Pilgrim Church." But they found themselves losing their nationality, and, though not per secuted, were in danger, so they expressed it, of being corrupted by the world around them. A division of them accordingly set out from Leyden, in a.d. 1620, hav ing been joined by some of those who objected to theBook of Sports. The observance of the Lord's Day in Hol land was no more satisfactory to them than that which was now obtruded upon their brethren in England. They were, in fact, Puritans of the most austere, cast. Liberal interpreters of such parts of the Old Testament as they chose to consider binding upon them in conse quence of the absolute morality of the Fourth Com mandment, they were distressed at finding their views controverted in this particular. They allowed, indeed, Sunday to be substituted for the Sabbath, but the Judaism of their views would allow no more. And with the Sabbath, which they could not help seeing was the</page><page sequence="3">38_TELE CRAYON._ great sign between God and His people, under Judaism, and was intimately connected with the Jewish polity, they thought themselves bound to re-introduce, so far as they could, all such positive enactments of the older covenant, as Christianity did not appear ou the very surface to contradict. To erect usmuilar commonwealth, i and with it, to reestablish " the Sabbath in its integrity/' these men originally quitted England. To obtain, I say, a freer development of their opinions, they quitted Holland in a. d. 1620, and went to New Plymouth. In imitation of them, a larger body left the mother country in a. d. 1629, f?&gt;r Massachusetts Bay. One cannot help greatly respecting these sufferers for conscience' sake. It is with no slight interest that the log-book, for so it may be called, of the religious voyage of the good ship u Mayflower,'' which carried out the earlier adventurers, is perused. And the artist yet loves to dwell on the parting from Delph-Haven, when Robinson, their pastor, knelt down on the shore and prayed with and for those whom he was to see in this world no more. The records of the second emigration are not so minute, but there is much in them to move our feelings, even at the distance of two centuries and a half. The charm, however, somewhat vanishes, on our discovering that the tyranny which they feared under the " Book of Sports," was exercised unsparingly to members of their own body. " I came from England," said a sturdy Puritan, named William Blackstone, "be cause I did not like the Lord-Bishops: and I cannot join with you, because I would not be under the Lord Brethren." Here is a specimen of it, in the form of rules said to have been drawn up by John Cotton, a minister, who had emigrated from Boston, in Lincoln shire, and to have been intended as a draft of the laws of the colony of Massachusetts : Whosoever shall profane the Lord's Day by doing un necessary work, by unnecessary travelling, or by sports arid recreations, he or they who so transgress shall for feit forty shillings, or be publicly whipped ; but if it shall appear to have been done presumptuously, such person or persons shall be put to death, or otherwise severely punished at the discretion of the court. No one shall run on the Sabbath Day, or walk in his garden, or elsewhere, except reverenily to and from meeting. No one shall travel, cook victuals, make beds, sweep house, cut hair, or shave on the Sabbath Day. No woman shall kiss her child on the Sabbath or fasting day. If any man shall kiss his wife, or wife kiss her hus band, on the Lord's Day, the party in fault shall be pun ished at the discretion of the Court of Magistrates. It is a strange way of showing oui* humble reverence and love for the Creator, to be perpetually condemning and reviling everything that He has created. Were you to tell a poet that his poems are detestable, would he thank you for the compliment? The evil on which it behooves us to fix our eyes, is that within ourselves, of our own begetting; the good, without. The half religious are apt just to reverse this.?Guesses at Truth.</page></plain_text>
