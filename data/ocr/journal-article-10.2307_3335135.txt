Los Angeles, California 90024 beards as well as masks with flat, big, round eyes can only be found in the north and in the east. But the strongest differentiation is not in local or regional styles but in the individual styles of the carvers or their workshops. It is not correct to suppose that masks with narrow eyes and feminine faces are typical Dan masks, whereas those with protuberant tube- shaped eyes are typical for the Kran. Both types of masks can be met everywhere, but the Kran elaborate both motifs in a hyper- trophical manner (p. 40). The different types of masks are discussed in detail (pp. 41-137), and illustrations of masks in action as well as of those shown in the exhibition accompany the text. Without any doubt this is the most accentuated and most important part of the catalogue. With the exception of one type (kaogle or kagle), all masks are also produced as minia- ture or hand masks between six and fifteen centimeters high. These miniature masks are representations of the large masks. The dancer of a mask or member of a family that owns an important mask may possess minia- ture replicas of it. In secret societies, minia- ture masks may represent auxiliary spirits. The three most important functions of these masks are: representation of a large mask dur- ing certain sacrifices; identification of the proprietor of a mask while traveling; and rep- resentation of spirits in circumcision camps (p. 139). In contrast to the discussion of the full-sized masks, the authors do not give supplementary information, such as that con- cerning carvers of miniature masks. The in- formation in this short section should be com- pared with that furnished by G. W. Harley (in Masks as Agents of Social Control in North- east Liberia, Papers of the Peabody Museum, Cambridge, Mass. 32, 2 [1950]: 9-11). The typological classification of miniature masks can easily be made by means of the full-sized masks. Statues are rare among the Dan. In most cases they are female figures. Although their faces resemble those of the masks, the statues are neither ancestor figures nor repre- sentations of spirits. They are considered to be portrait-like sculptures of living persons. Sometimes they are even pure works of art. Portrait-figures show individual traits of the person represented: scarifications; coiffure; form of breasts, navel or lips; position of eyes; outline of face, etc. The scarcity of Dan fig- ures is due to the fact that the only persons allowed to possess one were those who could persuade a carver to do this difficult work and who could bear the costs of a feast (at least a cow must be offered to the guests!). Wooden stela (called "half-figures" by the authors) can be found more often than statues. They are used in the rites of the secret societies and represent auxiliary spirits (pp. 149-155). Well known are the great spoons of the Dan, decorated at the end of the handle with a head, or a belly and legs, or a ram's head, or rice bowl. The spoon belongs to the most hospitable woman of the village or the quar- ter. She must always be prepared to receive guests and to offer them a meal. Furthermore she must offer banquets to the man clearing the forest and to the circumcision camp. The spoon is the symbol of her status, but in it an auxiliary spirit manifests itself (pp. 156-168). A few notes are devoted to boards for the mankalla-game (pp. 169-172) and to small spoons, bowls, combs and drums (pp. 173- 175). One slot-drum in the shape of a man had already been presented among the statues (no. 144, p. 154), although it is mentioned in the few notes on drums (p. 175). In the last chapters, brasscasting (pp. 177-196), pottery (pp. 197-202), and wall painting (pp. 203- 206) are discussed. The last two chapters par- ticularly seem a little too short. Die Kunst der Dan is one of the most im- portant recent publications on the art of an African people. I think it would be very useful if an English edition could be published.

Latin American Center, UCLA, 1976. 146 pp., 121 blw &amp; 12 color plates, bibliography. $12.50. Many readers and tourists are aware of the Aztec, the Maya, and the Inca as pre- European peoples in the Americas, but, out- side the fields of Pre-Columbian studies, there is little awareness that there were many other, mostly earlier, American cultures, some of whom left artifacts of extraordinary interest. Foremost among these were the Moche, or Mochica, people, who lived in and dominated the irrigable river valleys on the north-coast desert of Peru from the centuries just before the beginning of the Christian era until about the eighth century A.D. Their pot- tery has been collected avidly for at least a hundred years; finds of numerous metal ob- jects of sophisticated techniques are more re- cent collectors' treasures; textiles, because of preservation conditions, are scarce, as are wood and lapidary pieces. But, with all the enthusiastic collecting, until recently very lit- tle scholarship has been focused on the Moche. There has not been much archaeologi- cal excavation in their sites, nor has there been detailed iconographic study of the quan- tities of artifacts-chiefly pottery-that de- pict people, their flora and fauna, their myths and rituals. Christopher B. Donnan is perhaps the foremost scholar in the field of Moche studies. He has dug in Moche sites, he has assembled a vast archive of photographs and drawings of Moche artifacts, he has explored ethnographic and ethnohistorical evidence of customs that might relate to these ancient people, and he has written a number of papers on Moche archaeology and iconography. He has now produced a general book, which serves as an excellent introduction to these people, who have given us a large, if puzzl- ing, amount of material to cogitate on. 10</page><page sequence="2">They were sea-faring people who fished the Humboldt Current-and probably traded- with reed rafts; who fought one of the driest deserts in the world in order to raise crops of maize, beans, squash, peanuts, and other vegetables; who had the peaks of the Andes close behind them to furnish them with water, goods, and the ideas of ancestral peoples. Moche art has long been noted for its realism and its depiction of the elements in its environment. One can identify from the art- as Donnan does-species of animals, birds, and plants. One can recognize specific por- traits and see how houses and garments were made. There are scenes of explicit sexual ac- tivity and scenes of warfare. And yet it is a mistake to take such scenes at face value: there are ritual or mythic overtones to these depictions. Felines, owls, and bats appear as important anthropomorphs. Human warriors quickly become fox-headed warriors or take on the bodies of beans. Anthropomorphic deer appear as prisoners. Warclubs and weapons are anthropomorphized, as are fish and birds. Donnan points out the nonsecular aspect of Moche art and astutely observes that "these people probably viewed the world around them as a unified whole without a strict de- marcation between what we classify as natural and supernatural qualities of secular and nonsecular activities," and that "the ico- nography expresses only the nonsecular as- pects of Moche culture." He points out that, in a quite large sample of artifacts, there are relatively few themes; it follows that these must be very important themes. If there are criticisms to be made of this book, they would be directed toward em- phasis rather than toward content. Donnan gives a number of examples to illustrate non- secularity; he might have given more. In dis- cussing the erotic scenes, he mentions that the sexual acts depicted are not acts that would lead to insemination, but the case for their nonsecular nature might have been strengthened had he noted the fact that perhaps half of the erotic pots involve figures that are essentially skeletal. He mentions the winged nature of figures in the art but not the fact that many scenes involving human beings are repeated on other pots with an- thropomorphs who have human bodies and animal heads and tails, suggesting that human beings had anthropomorphic equiva- lents. One of the special merits of this book is that it contains a valuable compilation of ethnog- raphic and etlnohistorical material that may relate to Moche iconography; this is an impor- tant contribution to Moche studies. There is, of course, always potential danger in attempt- ing to push concepts too precisely back into too deep a past in too different a world-for example, in using modern shamanism to give exact interpretations of the art of the high cultures of the past. This is not to say that the moder material should be ignored, but the modern shaman's mesa must contain only memories of what were the vital ingredients of the socio-religious structure of a millen- Continued on page 79 F.

It is not surprising that the same elements or creatures that had power in the past are considered to have power now, but it does not follow that the kind of power is the same in today's socio-religious conditions as it was when the Moche people dominated their world. These things should be looked at from the point of view of kings and chief priests who lived according to myths as well as the point of view of curers in a modern society. But here again, criticism is a matter of emphasis. Donnan does not climb out on any limbs with this material, and he does make significant correlations between old and new culture traits. He states that his approach to Moche art is "based on the assumption that inherent in the art is a symbolic system that follows consis- tent rules of expression. In many respects, this symbolic system is similar to the sym- bolic system of a language." This is probably an important and reliable way to approach the art of any preliterate people at a certain stage of development. It is particularly appropriate for Moche art. Donnan presents his material with clarity, thoroughness, and perception. He provides his reader with descriptive information on the environment, the technology, the style, the chronology, and the visual content of the art. He has fresh material, fresh approaches, and fresh insights. It is a useful book for the amateur who is aware of the artifacts of this culture; it is informative and stimulating to the professional. Donnan's points are exempli- fied with rich illustrative material, and the book has the particular virtue of showing many pieces that have not been illustrated before. It is a pity that some of the color plates leave something to be desired, but that is a small complaint to find about an excellent book that is a model for the treatment of this kind of subject matter. Elizabeth P. Benson Dumbarton Oaks, Washington, D.C. XALA Sembene Ousmane Translated by Clive Wake Lawrence Hill &amp; Co., Westport, Connecticut, 1976. 114 pp., 12 blw photos. $6.95. This book, by the foremost Senegalese writer and fiimmaker, is one of those symbiotic or incestuous productions increasingly common in this country, where there is the novel of the film or the film of the novel. Published in French in 1974, and now available in Clive Wake's excellent translation, Xala became the script of the 1975 film so highly acclaimed at the New York Film Festival and was pre- sumably conceived as a double work, unlike "Le Mandat," which was a Sembene short story he subsequently made into a movie. This novel clearly has the air of a script about it, in its extensive dialogue and in its scene- setting descriptive passages, which provide the details later to be supplied by the ranging eye of the camera. It is also illustrated by black-and-white stills from the production. In being so close to the film, it allows one to consider more closely the dilemmas that the film had occasioned. Unanswered questions that raised their heads and were lost in the speedy movement of the overall events of the movie are inescapable in a reading. Philosophical issues intrude, whereas in the film they had been set aside temporarily be- cause of the extraordinary visual impact of the director's brilliant eye, which can display set- ting and incident as metaphor in the manner of all good filmmakers who create myth through vision. In the cooler atmosphere of the armchair, the theme and thesis of the conflict receive more calculated inspection, and it is hard to determine in this book what is the appropriate response or what messages the writer is propounding, not in any cheap prop- agandist way but in the human morality he, as an artist, is presenting in his work. There seem to be several levels and many threads in this novel. Unity is not an obliga- tion to the writer. Indeed, subtle irony and perceptive nuances can derive from complex- ity, but here the elements oppose rather than complement each other. Moods and thoughts clash because of the writer's inability to bring them into congruence. There are many mas- terful elements in this story, but they remain isolated and even in contrast to one another; polemic battling satire, and social criticism opposing fantasy. The story concerns xala, which is impo- tency brought on by a curse. El Hadji Adbou Kader Beye, who had been a primary school teacher, is now a wealthy entrepreneur in his country. He has become one of "the Group" of rich businessmen who find that indepen- dence has provided them with rich pickings. They act as front men for the ex-colonials who still, it is made quite clear, exert real power in the administration through economic control. Not only are these people puppets, they are puppets well pleased to ape the more vulgar displays of European materialism. This is one theme consistently found in Sembene; the ac- cusation of corruption and the accusation that African corruption truly derives from the power of neo-colonial capitalist intervention. Beye decided to marry, or it would be more correct to say he was tricked into marriage, for the third time, which as a Muslim he is entitled to do. His decision is tolerated by his first wife, secure in her seniority and devout in her faith, but it disgusts their daughter, a radical young university student anxious to reject European ways, and sends his pretty, vain and greedy second wife into fits of jealousy. After a wedding ceremony marked by its extravagant expenditure, Beye finds himself impotent. Since he has been a virile husband to date, he recognizes that this is a curse. Driven by horror at his failure and the ridicule he forsees it will engender, he seeks out a series of expensive seers and magicians to discover who has set this curse upon him and to get his potency restored. At this point, although the whole matter is mildly ridiculous, the book becomes a kind of whodunit. Was it the jealous second wife, the aggrieved mother-in-law, etc.? Misleading clues are provided like an Agatha Christie. In his desperate search, Beye's business gets totally neglected. Bills pile up. Finally he finds a distinguished marabout who cures him. Naturally he dashes off full of proud virility to his third wife only to find she is having her period, and he makes do with the pleasures of the second. Unfortunately he has paid the healer with a check that bounces, and in anger the xala is restored. Unable to get any further loans, Beye is flung out of the club of commercial man- ipulators whose position allows them to make fortunes speculating in commodities destined for the poor. Incensed by this rejection, Beye 79 AFRICAN ART Genevieve McMillan 40 Bow Street Harvard Square Cambridge Massachusetts 02138 (617) 864-0629 I</page></plain_text>
