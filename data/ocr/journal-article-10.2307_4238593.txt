The chance that has preserved Pompeii alone of these cities has given to all its monuments a significance far greater than their own merits as works of art or as representative ruins of ancient civilization in themselves would justify. It is only because they form a unique collection which is not and can never be hoped to be paralleled elsewhere, that the lararia of Pompeii, like its wall paintings for example, have so great an importance. Though their importance has frequently been observed, no one has previously set out to collect and study these shrines in their entirety. Scholars writing on the Roman domestic cult regularly refer to the Pom- peian monuments for illustrative material, but the emphasis has always been placed on the literary evidence and no archaeological study of the lararia by themselves has ever been made. It is with the intention of undertaking this study that I have assembled the cornus of the lararia. From it the practice of the household cult of an entire city of the first century of the Roman Empire can be under- stood. Though it is already late for beginning this col- lection, since dozens of the shrines have perished irrevocably, leaving, at best, only meagre accounts * This corpus originally formed the main part of a dissertation presented to the faculty of Yale University in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. During my term as Fellow of the American Academy in Rome the material has been wholly reorganized, the description of every shrine has been checked with the ruins of the monument itself at Pompeii and many new shrines have been added. 1 Though the word lararium to designate a house shrine is first used in ancient literature in the Life of Marcus Aurelius in the Historia Augusta (IV, 3, 5, cf. PAULY-WISSOWA, s. v. lararium), I have not hesitated to adopt it as a convenient term for describing the house shrines of Pompeii, in the eariier annals of the excavations, it is still possible today to write fairly complete and accurate descriptions of the majority of them, which a few more years will have destroyed beyond recognition. The first attempt to collect the monuments relating to the domestic cult at Pompeii was made by H. Jordan as part of a study of the Lares ("De Larum imaginibus atque cultu", in Ann. Inst., xxxiv, 1862, 300-339); in it he listed and described ten shrines from the private houses. In the following year A. Reifferscheid published a supplementary list, making numerous corrections and adding seven new lararia (Ann. Inst., xxxv, 1863, 121-134). Before this time but little attention had been paid these religious monuments, as Jordan remarks (Op. cit., 312): "Quae (Larum) imagines cum rudem plerumque artem prae se ferant, interpretum curam in se parum converterunt. Neque editae sunt nisi paucissimae." In the earlier excavation reports the discovery of a shrine had not been recorded at all or only in a very summary fashion. As the later reports become fuller with the descriptions of Minervini, Avellino and Fiorelli in the Bullettino Archeologico Napoletano and the Giornale degli Scavi di Pompei, and the accounts written by various authors for the Bullettino dell'Instituto di Corri- spondenza Archeologica, the lararia fare somewhat better, though even in these fuller reports they are frequently passed over entirely, frequently dismissed with the barest mention, and sometimes reported so carelessly that different reports place the same shrine in different rooms of a house, or even in different houses. No really satisfactory accounts of the excavations in general and of the lararia in particular appear before those of Mau in the Bullettino dell'Instituto from 1875 to 1885 and the Rormische Mitteilungen from 1886 to 1908. In 1862 Helbig published his catalogue of the ancient wall paintings found in Campania, including</page><page sequence="4">8 GEORGE K. BOYCE among them the figures of the household gods painted on the lararia.1 Sogliano continued this catalogue to include all paintings discovered by the year 1879.2 In these two catalogues are described all those lararia adorned with painted representations of the Genius, the Lares, the Penates, or the serpents,3 which were known up to 1879. They number 128 in all. But Helbig and Sogliano in describing these paintings had no interest in the shrine as such and consequently made but passing references to other elements such as niches, aediculae, altars or statuettes, with which the paintings may have been found. Of those numerous shrines not adorned with such painted figures no collection has been made and very little attention has ever been given them. A few of the most characteristic lararia were described and sometimes illustrated in the special books on Pompeii and the works on Roman religion. Some of these descriptions appearing in the earlier books are very valuable, since they record monuments that have now disappeared.4 Most important among these are the Museo Borbonico and Mazois, Les ruines de Pompgi.5 In both Overbeck-Mau and Mau, Pompeji, several of the finer houses are described in detail and the house shrines, where present, are at least mentioned.6 In some remarks concerning the general character of the Pompeian house prelim- inary to the descriptions of the individual houses, Overbeck-Mau devotes a paragraph to the Haus- capelle (p. 268), citing and illustrating but one example - the aedicula of the Domus Epidi Sabini. More complete is the small section which Mau devotes to the shrines, giving a brief discussion of the domestic worship under the heading Kapellen der Hausgotter (pp. 275-280). He cites examples of characteristic shrines and illustrates three of them. De Marchi, II culto privato di Roma antica, also cites typical examples of the lararia and gives a fuller discussion of them. In the works on Roman religion in general there are to be found scattered references to the Pompeian monuments, notably in Wissowa, Religion und Kultus der Rimer, and in the encyclopaedia articles Genius, Lares, Penates and lararium in Roscher's Lexikon, Pauly-Wissowa and Daremberg- Saglio. 1 HELBIG, Wandgemalde, Nos. 31-95. I SOGLIANO, Pitture Murali, Nos. 9-71. 3 Helbig did not attempt to include all the paintings of the serpents represented alone (e. g. Nos. 180, 235); cf. p. tOf. 4E. g. Nos. 132; 146; 174. B The other earlier works on Pompeii will be found listed in the bibliography, e. g. Antichita d'Ercolano; GELL, Pompeiana; BONUCCI, Pompeia descritta; BRETON, Pompiia; DYER, Pompeii. 8 Overbeck-Mau describes 27 houses and mentions the lararia in 17 of them; Mau gives full descriptions of 8 houses and a more or less summary account of 20 others, but mentions only 8 lararia. The descriptions in this corpus are based in the first place on published material, including both the excavation reports and the handbooks of Pompeii. In writing these descriptions every known mention of a given shrine has been examined and, where several exist, they have been compared. All the sources are cited at the end of each description. Every description has been checked with the monu- ment or its vestiges at Pompeii and made more detailed and accurate where possible. In this way all available evidence for the original appearance of every shrine has been taken into account. In systematically searching each house for its shrine, I have come upon many monuments that have found no place in any previous publication. The majority of these are unquestionably lararia, but with some of the simpler ones - especially wall niches that have lost their original coating of stucco,- it is impossible to be certain whether they served the domestic cult or a more profane purpose. In every such doubtful case I have been compelled to judge its nature from the position of the niche in the house and the existence or non-existence of another shrine within the same house. Such criteria are not entirely trustworthy and conse- quently there may be a good deal of the subjective in my decisions as to which were and which were not to be included in this corpus. But such monu- ments are few and of slight importance as compared with those of definitely religious purpose, for nothing more can be said of them than that they are niches; and unless some older report refers to them as lararia - in which case that report is quoted - they are simply described as "niches". But where other monuments of doubtful nature are included as possible shrines, the reasons for the doubt are discussed in the descriptions. An examination of a map upon which the sites of the known lararia are indicated, shows that they are distributed very unevenly throughout the city. There are some insulae (especially in Regions VI, VII) with but few shrines, while in others (especially in Region V) practically every house has at least one lararium. It is significant that the regions of few shrines are precisely those unearthed in the earlier days of the excavations, while the insulae brought to light during the more recent and careful work of discovery are the ones with numerous shrines. It is, then, the spotted nature of our evidence based on the sketchy and incomplete excavation reports, rather than any differences in the regions of the city, that accounts for the irregular distribution of the lararia. Many shrines have apparently vanished completely and hence it cannot be claimed that this corpus includes all the shrines that existed in the ancient City. In writing the descriptions I have adopted for</page><page sequence="5">POMPEIAN LARARIA 9 the sake of convenience a few unusual phrases which may need a word of explanation: "lararium painting" is used to indicate a painting representing the figures of the gods (including the serpents) which forms all or part of a lararium; "confronted" describes the characteristic attitude of a pair of serpents represented one on each side of an altar (whether real or only indicated in painting) and raising their heads above it. "Right" and "left" as used to indicate the relative positions of different figures in a painting are to be understood always from the point of view of one facing the painting, except in a few cases where reference is specifically made to the right or left of a certain figure (e. g. on his right); "right"' and "left" with reference to the position of the rooms in a house (e. g. the second room on the 1. of the atrium) or to the location of the lararium within a room (e. g. on the wall to the r. of the door) are always to be understood from the point of view of one entering the house or room by the front or principal door. To the corpus of the lararia are added two lists of monuments of an allied character: APPENDIX I contains reports of statuettes found in houses where no shrines are known to have existed and statuettes found in the streets of the city; APPENDIX II lists the figures of divinities painted on the exterior walls of houses and shops, especially beside the entrances. Neither of these lists can lay any claim to completeness, but each offers a representative selection. It would not be possible to make either of these collections complete, for the statuettes are but little noticed in the earlier reports and the paint- ings on the outer walls have, almost all, entirely disappeared. My task in collecting the lararia has been made much easier and far more pleasant by the kindness of Dr. Tatiana Warsher, to whom I am deeply indebted on many scores. In the first place she American Academy in Rome July, 1935. has generously put at my disposal her unparalleled collection of photographs of the Pompeian shrines, from which I have chosen more than fifty for repro- duction in the Plates. On many occasions both in Pompeii and in Rome she has freely given of her time, allowing me to draw heavily upon her intimate knowledge of the ruins of Pompeii. Any virtues which this work may possess are due to the constant interest of Professor M. Rostovt- zeff, who originally suggested the study of the lararia as a doctoral dissertation and under whose direction the corpus was written at Yale. No one enjoying the slightest acquaintance with Professor Rostovtzeff or his work will need to be told that the shortcomings of this corpus are the author's own, or that the present work hardly does credit to the quality of the direction he has received. To Professor Lily R. Taylor and Professor A. W. Van Buren of the American Academy in Rome I am indebted for many helpful suggestions and to Prof. Van Buren in addition for his kind aid in preparing the manuscript for publication in the Memoirs, of which he is editor. Finally, I wish to express my sincere thanks for the favors they have granted me: to Cav. Dott. M. Della Corte for his courtesy in enabling me to study freely in Pompeii; to Comm. A. Maiuri for permission to have photographs taken for repro- duction in this work; to Dr. L. Curtius and Dr. A. von Gerkan of the Deutsches Archdologisches Institut in Rome for generously allowing me to repro- duce numerous photographs and two unpublished drawings from the collection of the Institut, many of which are invaluable since they preserve the aspect of monuments now sunk in ruins; to the Neapolitan firm G. E. Bruno for generous permission to reproduce three photographs from the Sommer collection. G. K. BOYCE</page><page sequence="6">10 GEORGE K. BOYCE INTRODUCTION There are two elements common to all Pompeian lararia - the representation of the images of the gods to be worshipped in them and the provision for sacrifice before these images. These two essential functions dictate the form of the shrine within certain limits but allow at the same time considerable freedom in working out the details of form and appearance. The first of these requirements is met either by setting plastic images of the gods within the shrine, or by painting their figures on the walls. Provision is made for sacrifice before the images by setting a large permanent altar on the floor of the room before the shrine, or, more frequently, by placing a small portable altar within the shrine itself. Out of the varied ways of meeting these requirements there developed three fundamental types of lararium: the simple niche, the aedicula, the wall painting. The first and second of these are really only simpler and more elaborate examples respectively of the same type; the wall painting is frequently combined with niche or aedicula; frequently too it serves alone. Niche. The niche in its simplest form is merely a square or rectangular recess set in the wall of the room and coated with the same plaster as that which covers the wall. But so simple a form is rare, for practically every shrine is distinguished by adornments of some sort. The rectangular form is often replaced by one less severe, usually some variety of arch. The arch itself takes many forms. It may be only a vault which supplants the horizontal ceiling, leaving the side walls of the niche vertical lines (P1. 3, 1 &amp; 2). Or it may be a true arcosolium with the arch springing directly from the floor of the niche, which alone remains a straight line (P1. 2, 1 &amp; 3). Again, the back wall may be curved in such a manner that a horizontal cross-section through the niche is a semi-circle (P1. 15, 2).1 Other niches have the ceiling peaked in imitation of the form of a pediment (Nos. 14; 94-Pl. 3, 4; 144; 433). The great variety in the proportions and shapes of the niches is best seen by a glance through the photographs of the niches reproduced in the Plates (Pls. 1-15). There was apparently no norm, no model for the niche, but each was cut according to the momentary whim of its maker or in such form as the space available dictated. 1 More usual in the larger niches of pseudo-aediculae, e. g. Pls. 35, 2; 36, 1; 37, 1 &amp; 2. The niches were regularly located at such a height as could be easily reached by one standing on the floor, but there are some interesting exceptions. In Nos. 218; 332-Pi. 6, 2 the niche is placed very near the floor. The shrine in the kitchen of the Casa del Fauno (No. 190-PI. 5, 2), on the other hand, is too high to be reached without something on which to stand. Similar is No. 102-PI. 3, 2 but in this case a permanent approach in the form of a mezzanine seems to have been provided. Every wall of a niche is subject to decoration of some sort. The floor seldom consists merely of the unadorned surface of the recess cut in the wall. In the majority of cases it is covered by a tile or slab of stone which projects slightly from the surface of the wall to form a narrow shelf. This projecting shelf may originally have been added only with the desire of giving a more finished appearance to the niche, but it came to serve the definite purpose of enlarging the floor space to provide room for the statuettes and for offerings and lamps placed before them (Pls. 1-4). In many cases the shelf is a piece of roof-tile, so placed that the flanges along its two edges form raised ridges on each side of the floor of the niche, which, when given a coating of stucco, resemble in appearance the bolsters on the top of an ara pulvinata. This resemblance to an altar unques- tionably accounts for the wide-spread use of the roof-tile for the shelf, however accidental its original employment for this purpose may have been. For, in covering the tile with a layer of stucco, care is always taken to preserve the outlines of the ara pulvinata (Pls. 2, 1 restored; 3, 1). The size of the projecting floor is occasionally exaggerated. In some cases it is a thick and heavy slab of stone - dis- proportionately large for use in a wall niche (Nos. 143; 448). Frequently it extends far beyond the outlines of the niche on both sides. This is true especially when the floor, instead of being a slab of stone, is molded in stucco, which is presumably spread over a projecting tile (Nos. 58; 102-Pl. 3, 2; 130-Pl. 3, 1). Below one niche the form of this over-heavy floor is merely indicated in the plaster and does not project at all (No. 55). The projecting floor is occasionally elaborated into a ledge with ornamental consoles as supports (a small niche No. 197-Pl. 1, 3; larger and more ornate niches Nos. 219-Pl. 15; 381-Pl. 6, 1). Its edge, when thick, may be adorned by a linear frieze in painting or stucco work, and elaborations and variations occur.</page><page sequence="7">POMPEIAN LARARIA 11 the frieze on the ledge itself, in turn, may be accompanied by one or more similar linear friezes on the wall below the ledge proper (Nos. 108-Pl. 8, 1; 123-PI. 7, 1; 160-Pl. 6, 3; 483). When the ledge is of this more elaborate variety, it seldom stands alone (as in No. 483), but is usually incorporated into an aedicula faqade framing the niche. The aedicula fa9ade marks the niche as a shrine of the gods, more clearly than any other feature except the images of the gods themselves. It exists in a great variety of forms and exhibits many degrees of completeness and elaboration :1 it may be merely indicated in painting, executed in stucco relief or in marble, and apparently in some cases it was of wood and attached to the wall with nails.2 In the simplest form only the pediment is represented on the wall above the niche (Pls. 1, 3; 4, 6); but more usually the faqade is complete with pilasters or applied columns at the sides, their bases resting upon the projecting floor and their capitals supporting the pediment (Pls. 5, 1; 7, 1; 9, 1). There are a few examples of a facade of the severe outlines of the First Style of wall decoration, notably those in the Casa del Fauno (P1. 5, 2 &amp; 4), which presumably date from the second century B. C. Another of the same type but of later date is No. 439 (P1. 5, 1). Usually the designer of shrines of the later period preferred more ornament. An instructive example of this type is the niche in the garden of the Casa del Cenacolo (No. 108-Pl. 8, 1)t where the love of elaboration which characterizes the Fourth Style work at Pompeii has combined with the vulgar liking for gaudy colors which the art of the house shrine so often exemplifies, to produce one of the most bizarre of the Pompeian lararia. Another example of the same sort of elaborate and gaudy faqade is that in the fauces of the Domus M. Tofelani Valentis (No. 81-Pl. 1, 5). More tasteful, but hardly less elaborate are the fa9ades of the larger niches in Nos. 160-Pl. 6, 3; 381-Pl. 6, 1; 402-Pl. 9, 1. The four niches just cited illustrate various solu- tions of the problem which frequently arose in fitting the temple faqade to the niche. If the niche was rectangular, there was no problem, for the pedi- ment was then placed above, the supporting pilasters at the sides of the niche. But if the niche had a vaulted ceiling, then variations arose: the rectangular faqade might still surround the opening of the niche with the pediment placed above the arch (Pls. 5, 2; 6, 3) or with the curve of the arch extending into the space of the pediment (Pl. 6, 2; cf. the free- standing aedicula P1. 32, 2). But often the aedicula ' Unfortunately, in many cases photographs taken today do not show the fasades which are reported to have been seen on the niches at the time of excavation, for they have fallen since, e. g. PIs. 1, 1; 4, 1. 2 For examples see the index, s. v. AEDICULA FACADES. fagade was adapted to the curve of the arch, the regular pediment being replaced by a cornice running around the curve, its ends supported like those of a pediment upon the capitals of the pilasters or applied columns at the sides of the niche (Nos. 108-Pl. 8, 1; 435-Pl, 3, 6). The niche No. 356-Pl. 3, 5 represents a half-way stage in the degeneration of this type of faqade into a mere ornamental band outlining the curve of the vault, for the vertical strips at the sides are no longer felt as pilasters supporting the heavy band above. In other cases, like the niche in the kitchen of the Casa degli Amanti (No. 59-Pl. 10, 2), the fagade is wholly replaced by a band running around the arcosolium. A similar example where the band is not of stucco relief, but merely painted, is that at V, iiis 9 (No. 114-Pl. 22, 3). Other variations in the aedicula fagades are repre- sented by the following: The niche No. 94-Pl. 3, 4 has a peaked ceiling imitating the form of a pediment, and the surrounding facade has been simplified to a projecting ridge, analogous in form to the familiar projecting floor, framing the niche on all sides. In No. 9-Pl. 7, 2 the aedicula fagade is made up of three slabs of marble, one as a pilaster on each side, the third as architrave across the top, and a pediment formed also of slabs of marble, which in this case are embedded in the wall in such a manner that their thin edges form the sides of a triangle; the floor of this niche is likewise of marble. The rec- tangular niche No. 330-Pl. 12, 3 is surrounded in a similar way by slabs on each side and across the top of the opening, but in this case the slabs are not of marble. They are only molded in stucco and painted like the interior of the niche - apparently a decoration inspired by the type of marble favade described in No. 9. To perfect the illusion of the little temple given by the facade, a low step is sometimes built against the back wall of the niche and upon it stand the statuettes (Nos. 125; 199-Pl. 1, 2; 402-Pl. 9, 1). Occasionally too, in the back wall of the niche is cut a semi-circular recess in the form of an apse, within which the figure of the god would stand (Nos. 3; 73; 402). Holes in the floor of numerous niches indicate that the statuettes were sometimes firmly affixed by means of special projections on their bases which were inserted into the floor (Nos. 9; 72; 73; 75). Such projections have been noticed on the bases of bronze statuettes found in the excava- tions (No. 123). The most common manner of ornamenting the niche is by painting. Its walls are first given a coating of stucco, sometimes of the same grade as that which covers the walls of the room, more often of a finer quality (Nos. 47;^ 85). In the latter case a rectangular panel on the wall surrounding the niche may likewise be givren this finer stucco (Pls. 4, 4; 6, 3; 12, 3 &amp; 4;</page><page sequence="8">12 GEORGE K. BOYCE 23, 2). In some houses the lararium niche and the neighboring portions of the wall are the only parts of the walls of the room given any stucco covering at all (Pls. 7, 1; 24, 2). The stucco was in most cases originally white, and might be left so (Nos. 125; 148; 196; 199) or might be painted a solid color: red (Nos. 6; 11; 24), blue (Nos. 24; 74; 111), green (Nos. 130; 138; 143), yellow (Nos. 24; 44), or orange (Nos. 311; 319; 443). This painting in solid color was usually reserved for niches without figured paintings on their walls, though even when such painted figures appear, a solid color sometimes serves as background instead of the more usual white (Nos. 219; 378). A few niches have different parts of the inside walls done in different solid colors (Nos. 65; 113; 381; 402). The most common type of decoration is not, however, to paint the walls a solid color, but to outline the corners within the niche and the opening of the niche in the wall of the room with broad painted stripes - usually red (Nos. 74; 81; 86; 87; 93; 94), though black and green (Nos. 57; 97) are also used. The next most popular decoration is to cover the walls with a profusion of spots or splotches of several different colors, strewn without pattern over the entire surface (Nos. 68; 89; 134; 236). Whether they are intended for flowers or only spots of color, it is impossible to say. They exhibit a great variety in the size and shape of the individual spots and in the irregularity or uniformity with which they are strewn over the walls. Though usually there are spots of several different colors decorating a single surface, sometimes all are of a single color - red (Nos. 32; 57; 113). There is a fine specimen of this last type in the large niche in No. 126-Pl. 11, 2, where not only the interior of the niche, but also a broad band on the wall surrounding it, is covered with these spots. The spots are sometimes intermingled with stars (Nos. 126; 339) rather crudely painted, and the stars may even appear alone, especially on the ceiling of a niche (Nos. 86; 114; 123). The inside walls may also be adorned with green leaves, with or without flowers (Nos. 20; 35; 81; 130), and scattered in varying degrees of profusion over the surface; occasionally one or more birds are added among the foliage. Flowers may also be used alone (Nos. 29; 95; 132; 361). In a few isolated examples they are carefully painted, notably in No. 261-Pl. 12, 1, where the back wall is filled with red, rose-like flowers very realistically represented,' but usually they are so carelessly done as to be hardly recognizable as flowers, The more ambitious and carefully executed niches often boast an ornamentation of a finer character, There are numerous examples of a sea shell of stucco (Nos. 111-Pl. 38, 1; 254; 381-Pl. 6, 1), in the vault 'Cf. the fine roses painted on the altar No. 295-Pi. 39, 1. of the niche; in two cases ornamental figures of stucco relief adorn the back wall (Nos. 323; 381); again, stucco cornices often run around the inner walls as well as on the wall outside the niche (Nos. 39; 63; 111; 162). The figures of the household divinities painted within or beside a niche and forming the most important kind of painted decoration will be con- sidered below in connection with the paintings. The many wall niches having the characteristics of a lararium, but which had at the time of excavation no figures of the gods, either in painted or in plastic form, must have been intended to contain statuettes alone. Few of them have been found with their contents intact, because these contents were either carried away by the fleeing inhabitants,2 or removed after the eruption by ancient excavators, or, being of perishable material, have disappeared. The few lararia where the shrine was found with its contents untouched are, therefore, of particular value. Notable among the niches so found are Nos. 108; 123; 406 ;439.3 Aediculae. We have already observed that the wall niche is frequently given the appearance of a miniature temple by the addition of an aedicula fa9ade. In other cases this miniature temple, or aedicula,4 is more comnplete - a structure in three dimensions standing on the top of a special podium. In its simplest form such an aedicula5 consists of a gable roof with pediment, resting upon an architrave which is supported in front by two columns, in back by two columns or pilasters applied to the wall against which the structure stands (Pls, 29, 31). This is the true aedicula - an architectural form with a continuous tradition extending back to Greece of the fifth century.6 Alongside this true aedicula 2 For statuettes carried away by fleeing inhabitants, see VON ROHDEN, Terrakotten, 24 and the finds of statuettes described in Appendix I to the corpus, especially No. 9. s For a complete list, see the index s. v. STATUETTES found in shrines. 4The word aedicula is reserved throughout the corpus to designate the complete miniature temple as distinct from the wall niche adorned with an aedicula facade, which is always called a niche. 6 The aedicula in general is treated in the encyclopaedia articles, s. v. aedicula: DAREMBERG-SAGLIO; PAULY- WISSOWA; RUGGIERO, Dict. Epigr. 6This development is sketched in W. ALTMANN, Die Romischen Grabaltare der Kaiserzeit, 136-142, as a preface to the author's consideration of the use of columns on funerary altars. It is not the place in this introduction to trace this very instructive development of the aedicula preceding its adoption as a form for the household shrine, but I may call attention to the closest parallel to the Pompeian free-standing aedicula that is known to me. This is found in a series of sepulchral monuments from Lilybaeum in Sicily (E. GABRICI, "Stele sepolcrali di Lilibeo in forma di Heroon", in Mon. Ant., xxiii, 1929, 41-60, pls. 1-7, of which 1-5 are colored). Each of these monuments is a free-standing structure con-</page><page sequence="9">POMPEIAN LARARIA 13 there exists another similar type of shrine, analogous in purpose and general structure, but of a different architectural type. This is similarly placed on the top of a podium but does not have the columns of the true temple form. Instead it takes the form of a niche, not, however, a recess cut in the wall of the room, but one hollowed out of a cubical mass of masonry or formed by walls built on the top of a podium and supporting a roof above them (Pls. 30, 1 &amp; 3; 34, 1 &amp; 2; 37, 1 &amp; 2). The niche so formed is sometimes rectangular, sometimes given a vaulted ceiling, but in all cases is surmounted by a pediment. In many instances it is also adorned with an aedicula facade like the small wall niche. It is difficult to see how either of these two types of shrine - the true and the pseudo-aedicula- could have developed out of the other. They seem to have separate origins. Unlike the true aedicula, with its long history, the pseudo form appears to have come into being only with the lararia of the Imperial period. Since it has the form and appearance of a wall niche transferred to a free-standing structure, it must be regarded as nothing more than an elaborated wall niche, taking its origin from the desire of the maker to design a more ambitious shrine. That this is the true explanation of the pseudo-aediculae, is evident from a comparison of them with the simpler wall niches. Before turning to these pseudo-aediculae, however, we shall find it instructive to note the close parallelism between the forms of the true aediculae and the niches adorned with aedicula facades. We are already familiar with the aedicula facades framing wall niches, ranging from simple types (P1. 5, 1) to more elaborate forms, some of which are of rather uncouth design and proportions (P1. 7, 1), others more or less pleasing (P1. 9, 1). Now if we examine those faqades of more ambitious design and compare them with the free-standing aediculae, the close relationship between them becomes apparent. Note, for example, the niche with large aedicula faqade in the kitchen shrine No. 219 (P1. 15). It is not easy to say whether it should more properly be classed as a niche with aedicula fa9ade or as a free-standing aedicula differing from the usual type only in that it is built upon a ledge supported by consoles instead of the customary podium. Compare sisting of an aedicula (Doric columns supporting gable roof and pediment) built on the top of a low podium. The back wall within the shrine is painted with a funerary banquet scene and the entire surface of the structure, inside and out, is painted with decorative and religious motives in red, yellow and green on the background of a yellowish stucco that was originally white. The subjects of the paintings and the use of the aedicula as a heroon offer no parallel, but in form the monuments are very similar to many of the Pompeian aediculae. Gabrici dates them "not earlier than the first century after Christ". this example with the finely decorated aedicula No. 142 (P1. 35, 2) and both are seen to belong to the same type, though the second is larger and rests upon a podium instead of a ledge; both are constructed before niches cut into the wall of the room, and in both cases the aedicula itself is shallow, giving the appearance of a facade rather than a complete temple in miniature. Keeping these two shrines in mind, let us look at the elaborate niche No. 381 (P1. 6, 1). There is no question but'that it is a niche with aedicula facade, but at the same time it has the appearance of a complete aedicula. The fa9ade is only applied to the wall around the opening of the niche, but the pediment above it projects' far beyond the rest of the fa9ade, as does the ledge upon which the bases of the applied columns rest. Below the ledge the surface of the wall is painted to represent such a podium as more usually supports the aedicula. Similar in this respect is the shrine known as the Double Lararium (No. 266- P1. 32, 1), where below a deep rectangular niche the wall is marked off by stucco cornices to represent such a podium. Another interesting shrine is No. 111 (P1. 38, 1), where a complete aedicula with columns and pediment was constructed on the top of a high podium before a fine arched wall niche decorated with an aedicula faqade. These examples demon- strate the interplay of influences between the niche with fa9ade and the true aedicula, an interplay which intermingles the characteristics of both forms in the same shrine. It is not surprising, then, to find the characteristics of the niche still more completely adopted in the construction of the pseudo-aedicula. But whereas the designers of the true aedicula were conscious of the historical tradition behind the aedicula which they were adapting to the purposes of the household shrine, the makers of the pseudo- aedicula seem only to have taken the wall niche as it existed before their eyes in Pompeii and adapted its form to the dimensions of the free-standing structure. One of the simplest examples of the pseudo- aedicula is No. 154 (P1. 34, 2), a plain rectangular niche constructed on the top of a rectangular podium and surmounted by a pediment. Compare the more clumsy form No. 414 (P1. 34, 1). Nos. 195 (P1. 35, 4) and 374 (P1. 33, 1) are similar but have the flat ceiling replaced by a vault. Another, less perfect architecturally but more elaborately adorned with painted ornaments, is that built into the corner of the garden at VI, vii, 6 (No. 162-PI. 30, 1). Most elaborate of all this type is the famous niche of the Casa del Poeta Tragico (No. 168-PI. 30, 3). An examination of the p-hotographs of these several 1 This projecting pediment has been restored in place since the photograph reproduced in the Plate was taken. A similar projecting pediment is described in shrine No. 445.</page><page sequence="10">14 GEORGE K. BOYCE shrines shows more clearly than words how each represents an attempt to take the form of the wall niche and transfer it to a more ambitious structure. Two of the most instructive examples for this purpose, because they seem to represent halfway stages in the development, are Nos. 310 (P1. 14, 1) and 112 (P1. 36, 2). The former is only a large niche with vaulted ceiling, which, instead of being cut in the wall, is formed by side walls built on the top of a podium which stands against the wall of the garden. The second is a still larger niche, cut in the wall and reaching clear down to the ground. It is fitted with a faqade and only its monumental size betrays the maker's desire to build a more imposing shrine - the same desire which led him in other cases to take the niche entirely out of the wall and place it upon a special base. Fine examples of the pseudo- aedicula with high niche apparently intended to contain a single large statuette and therefore probably more ornamental than religious, are illustrated in Pls. 30, 3; 35, 3; 37, 1 &amp; 2. Though the true aediculae follow always the same type with columns and pediment, they exhibit considerable individuality in both form and decora- tion. When the podium of the structure is built against one wall of the room, that wall serves as the back wall of the miniature temple (Pls. 29, 1 &amp; 2; 31), while the two sides may either be left entirely open or be partially closed off by side walls (P1. 34, 3). One aedicula of this type has four instead of the usual two columns in the fagade (No. 214-Pl. 32, 2). Often the shrine is built into the corner of the room, so that only two sides of the podium and the aedicula are left free (P1. 29, 3 &amp; 4). In these cases a single column at the one free corner supports the roof which is adorned with pediments on both of the adjacent free faces, and half-columns or pilasters are applied to the walls of the room in line with the point where the roof abuts against them. One or both of these free sides may be closed off, as in the case of the shrine in the atrium of the Casa del Menandro (No. 48). The floor within the aedicula is often fitted with a low step (P1. 29, 3 &amp; 4), upon which the figures of the gods stood, or with special provision for the support of a single large statuette (No. 176). In the aediculae of the houses of the Amorini Dorati (P1. 38, 2) and Caecilius Jucundus (P1. 30, 4), the arrangement of the floor is still more elaborate. The podium is regularly about one meter in height; there is one of unusual height (No. 404- P1. 34, 3). This same shrine is one of two (No. 343 is the other) having the roof flat with no sign of a pediment. The columns are regularly Doric, though they usually have bases and do not conform strictly to the canonical type; in a few instances they are of a more ornamental form resembling Corinthian (Pls. 30, 2; 35, 2). In all but one shrine, where they are of marble with stucco capitals (No. 221), the columns are of an inferior stone and coated with a layer of stucco in which flutes may or may not be represented. The system of decoration of the aediculae is similar to that of the niches, but with the former there is more regularly an attempt to harmonize the shrine with the decoration of the walls of the room. This is the case with the well-known aediculae in the houses of Epidius Rufus (P1. 29, 2), Epidius Sabinus (P1. 29, 4), Caecilius Jucundus (P1. 30, 4), the Casa delle Pareti Rosse (P1. 31) and the Casa degli Amorini Dorati (P1. 38, 2). But in all cases the aedicula is regarded as an ornament in itself and as such is often loaded with decoration; notable in this respect are those reproduced in Pls. 29, 4; 31; 32, 2. The interior of the aedicula may be adorned like that of a niche with decorative motives (Nos. 229 ; 386; 404) or with figured paintings (Nos. 162; 211; 371). The podium was usually coated with a uniform layer of stucco and adorned at the top with a stucco cornice of more or less elaborate design (Pls. 30, 2; 32, 1; 35, 2). It was sometimes treated as a continuation of the dado of the wall of the room (No. 371), sometimes painted as an essential part of the shrine with luxuriant foliage and the two serpents confronted at an altar (done in stucco in No. 193-Pl. 34, 4; painted in Nos. 371-Pi. 31; 404-Pl. 34, 3) or with attributes of the god worshipped in the shrine (No. 176). Again, the base might be painted with characteristic motives of the Fourth Style (P1I 29, 4), or in the familiar imitation of colored marble - of a single variety (No. 345), or more elaborately as if veneered with slabs of different marbles set in a geometric design (Nos. 48; 111- P1. 38, 1). The shrine in the atrium of the house of Caecilius Jucundus (P&gt;1. 30, 4) is unique in having its base covered with slabs of greyish marble. The steps upon which the images of the gods stood are of the same fine material; the roof and the super- structure have disappeared. Of particular interest are the two (or three?) rectangular slabs affixed to the shrine and sculptured in relief, two of them apparently depicting scenes of contemporary Pompeii. There are other cases where marble was used on the base of the aedicula, but none is well preserved (Nos. 277; 345; 346). Before turning from the aediculae we should mention those which are simply painted on a wall. Niches surrounded by such painted facades have already been pointed out. In some other shrines a painted aedicula frames the lararium painting (Nos. 68-P1. 13, 2; 96-P1. 39, 3; 303-Pl. 25, 2). Altars. There is much of interest in the altars1 which 1 On the altar in general see the encyclopaedia articles: s. v. ara in DAREMBERG-SAGLIO, s. v. Altar in PAULY- WISSOWA.</page><page sequence="11">POMPEIAN LARARIA 15 form an essential part of the equipment of the lararia. We have already noted that these altars are of two main types - the large permanent altar which stands on the floor below or beside a shrine, and the small portable one which could be placed within the shrine. Of the permanent altars some are of stone, others are built up of masonry. The majority of the stone altars are of tufa' and several of them date back to the Tufa Period (second century B. C.). Two of these still stand in situ where they were placed by pious hands before the Romans came to Pompeii and continued to form part of the household shrine till the last days of the city (Nos. 167-Pl. 11, 1; 188). In another case (No. 419-Pl. 16, 2) an old tufa altar was incorporated in a lararium of the Imperial period, its new position in a corner requiring the partial disfigurement of its old contours. Five similar altars2 which probably date back to the second century were found in houses of the later Pompeii, standing alone and without connection with any shrine. In two3 of these five cases lararia of the usual sort were found in the same houses; in the other three no lararia are reported and these altars alone may have served the domestic cult. When these old altars of an earlier art form were re-used by the Pompeians of the later days, their out-moded profiles were hidden beneath a heavy coating of stucco, even though this treatment concealed the fine contours of the Hellenistic art form (No. 419 and that listed under E in note 2 below). In contrast to these few instructive examples of the continued use of stone altars from pre-Roman Pompeii, the majority of the large altars which stood before the shrines were of material loosely described in the corpus as "masonry". That is to say, they were built up of tufa blocks, bricks or irregular stones held together by mortar, the whole outer structure being then covered over with a layer of stucco. The altar so formed might be cylindrical, square or rectangular, and either free-standing or built against a wall; Nos. 126-Pl. 11, 2; 212-Pl. 40, 1; 96-Pl. 39, 3; 1 A careful study of them is given in PERNICE, Hellenist- ische Tische, etc. 66-69. 2 A- V, iii, 4: Two fragments of a tufa altar, PERNICE, 67 and pl. 40, 5 &amp; 6.

The rectangular altar which stands before the aedicula of the Casa dei Dioscuri (No. 176- P1. 29, 1) is crudely formed of two rectangular stones, one placed horizontally on the top of the other, which stands vertically. The altars, whether of stone or masonry, regularly have some provision on the top for the fire of sacrifice. The two bolsters, one on each side, which mark an ara pulvinata are frequently to be seen on both the stone (B, C, D in note 2, P. 15, and No. 419- P1. 16, 2) and masonry altars (Nos. 96; 126; 146). Others have in the top a rectangular depression (stone altars: E in note 2, P. 15, and Nos. 167; 188; masonry altars: Nos. 126-Pl. 11, 2; 365-Pl. 39, 2) or a concave upper surface (in masonry altars only: Nos. 218; 249; 301). Only one altar preserved has its upper surface divided into two separate sections,4 presumably for simultaneous sacrifice to different divinities or groups of divinities (No. 50). In several cases marks of fire and even the remains of the last offerings were found on the top of an altar at the time of excavation (Nos. 103; 126; 253; 291; 463). The altars are decorated in various interesting ways. We have already noted examples of old stone altars which had subsequently been coated with a layer of stucco and painted. Masonry altars were always so treated: Nos. 141; 146 are red; Nos. 25; 261 are yellow; several are painted in the imitation of veneering with slabs of variegated marbles: Nos. 212; 249 are yellow; No. 71 is red and yellow, No. 330 red and white. At times there were painted upon the surface of the stucco various decorative or religious motives: festoons and masks, No. 25 ; festoons alone, No. 488; a yellow candelabrum, No. 141; a cock, No. 4; a garlanded hog, No. 132; a popa, a cock, the club of Hercules and a skyphos, No. 479; symbols of sacrifice and the attributes of Diana, No. 307; the two serpents confronted at an altar, No. 218. The altar which stands alone in the open area of the peristyle at VII, vii, 2 (No. 295-Pl. 39, 1) is decorated upon a white ground with fine rose-like flowers in red and yellow. The following substitutes for regular permanent altars have been found: A marble-covered pilaster applied to the wall of the peristyle seems to have 4 One portable altar has a similar arrangement (No. 121 n.), and the altar in the sacrarium compitale (?) at VIII, iv, 24 has the same division of the top surface. This division is discussed in PAULY-WISSOWA, s. v. Altar, i, col. 1658.</page><page sequence="12">16 GEORGE K. BOYCE served as an altar in one house (No. 375). In three cases a table' was substituted for an altar: No. 61 before a niche; No. 184 before a painting; No. 229- P1. 33, 2 before an aedicula. In the sacellum No. 459 a table stands against the wall in one corner near the niche, but it apparently served to hold the accessories of the cult, for there is a permanent masonry altar on the floor directly in front of the niche. More common than the permanent altar and its substitutes is the small portable type.2 Very few of them are still to be seen within the shrines, even in cases where the excavation report describes them as found there. Notable exceptions are to be seen in Pls. 5, 2; 33, 2. All others, whether found in a shrine or elsewhere in a house, have been collected together in the magazine near the N. W. corner of the Forum, where they may be seen in dozens. Pernice3 has distinguished the different forms and types, illustrating them with eleven photographs. The material of these small altars is variously marble, travertine, tufa, terra-cotta, or even bronze, and the variations in their shapes and sizes, types and degrees of decoration are endless. The bronze altars are far less common than those of other materials. In the triclinium opening off the S. E. corner of the atrium of the Casa del Meleagro (VI, ix, 2) was found a collection of bronze objects, among them a small altar finely decorated with Damascene inlay in silver, Museo Borbonico, xi, pl. 44; Overbeck-Mau, 310. Others of simpler and less costly decoration are to be seen in the Museum at Naples; several types are illustrated in Gusman, 127. A selection of portable altars of other materials than bronze, with the places where they were found, follows: Marble altars. No. 114, an undecorated altar found within a niche; No. 121 n., an altar decorated on the front face with a taenia, a patera, and an urceus in relief and having its top surface divided into two sections by a ridge running down the center, found in one of the rooms behind a taberna; No. 118 n., an undecorated altar found in the atrium of a house that has a magnificent shrine. In the Casa del Citarista (I, iv, 5) - a fine large house without any regular lararium - in the impluvium of the atrium entered at No. 5, was found a small marble altar 1 On the subject of tables used in religious ceremonies to supplement or replace altars, see DAREMBERG-SAGLIO, s. v. mensa, III, ii, 1720; PAULY-WISSOWA, s. v. Mensa, xv, col. 946f. 2 Cf. PAULY-WISSOWA, s. v. Altar, i, col. 1685. A finer type of portable altar than any found at Pompeii is to be seen in the museum at Berlin; it is of terra-cotta and has but three sides, each decorated with figures in relief, on one side the two Lares, on the other two sides Hercules strangling the serpents, DAREMBERG-SAGLIO, s. v. ara, i, fig. 416; BAUMEISTER, Denkmdler, i, 56 and fig. 61. *PERNICE, op. cit., 69f. and pls. 41, 6; 42, 1-7. decorated with a garland held by two Amorini, two birds, two crossed palms and a praefericulum, Overbeck-Mau, 361. A single travertine altar, cylindrical in shape, has been found (No. 93), unless the cube of the same material described in No. 455 really served as altar. Tufa altars: No. 343, an altar found near an aedicula; No. 349, an altar found in a room con- taining a lararium and having in addition a masonry podium which may have been a permanent altar; in the niche of an unfinished fountain (?) in the rear of the garden at VI, xv, 5, together with several decorative statuettes, was found a cylindrical altar of tufa, coated with a thick layer of stucco and painted in several colors, RMm. Mitt., xii, 1898, 19. Terra-cotta altars: No. 123, two rectangular altars were found together with several statuettes in a niche that contained in addition a masonry block like a small permanent altar; No. 190 (Casa del Fauno), an altar which still stands within the niche in the kitchen; No. 253, an altar found with two lamps in one of the niches of a sacellum, the other of which contained only the lamps, and before both of which stood a large masonry altar; No. 264, an altar found together with statuettes in an aedicula; No. 344, a small altar found on the top of a permanent masonry altar in the unusual subterranean sanctuary at VITI, ii, 16; the following altars were found apart from any shrine: Nos. 130 n.; 469 n.; 106 n., Casa del Cenacolo (an altar with a serpent in relief coiled about it); in a room behind the taberna at VI, xvi, 13 were found two cylindrical altars, Not. Scavi, 1908, 62. Another type consists of terra-cotta incense altars made in the form of a vase4 with circular foot and a large opening in the top for the incense: No. 61, found near a niche; No. 67, found in an aedicula together with statuettes; No. 108, found in a niche together with statuettes; at VI, xv, 5 was found such an altar having traces of burning on the top and standing upon a special base made from a rectangular brick, RMm. Mitt., xiii, 1898, 19. Even more numerous than the altars themselves are the representations of altars in lararium paintings, for almost every painting has at least one, whether it be that upon which the Genius or one of the Penates pours a libation, or that above which two confronted serpents raise their heads, The shape of these painted altars is nearly always cylindrical, but the proportions vary, some being tall and slender, others short and thick (P'ls. 8-25). The painted altar is most fre- quently done in imitation of variegated marble of two different colors, usually red and white or red and yellow, though some are painted a solid color 4'A similar form appears in the altar done in stucco relief betwveen two confronted serpents in No. 402-Pi. 9, 1.</page><page sequence="13">POMPEIAN LARARIA 17 (Pis. 14, 1 &amp; 2; 16, 1). A few peculiarities are worth mentioning: at times the cylindrical altar stands upon a square base (Pls. 8, 3; 14, 2) - in one case a very high one (No. 224-Pi. 16, 1); the altar is occasionally very small in proportion to the size of the serpents beside it (Pls. 22, 3; 27, 1); in a few paintings the altar is square (Pls. 21, 1; 30, 2; No. 271). Occasionally the regular altar is replaced in the painting by a tripod (Nos. 119; 139; 313; 362) or a sort of brazier (Nos. 41; 106). In the case of the former the Genius is represented pouring a libation upon a tripod instead of an altar; No. 427 has a tripod standing in the midst of a sacrificial scene without function there - either a symbol, or a figure left over from an earlier painting. Both the paintings in which the altar is replaced by a brazier represent the serpents alone beneath a niche. In No. 106 one serpent is coiled about the brazier, as is frequently the case with a serpent at an altar. These rare appearances of tripods and braziers in the paintings probably reflect the rarity of their actual use in sacrifices. Actual tripods found in the excavations are to be seen in the Museum at Naples (cf. Gusman, 127 with two figures), but whether they were ornaments or for use in religious ceremonies is unknown. Finally, an interesting substitute for the regular altar is the simple roof-tile, embedded in and pro- jecting from the wall. A number of these tiles are reported, but only in rare cases are the tiles still to be seen in place. In four examples (Nos. 56 really a marble slab; 230; 235; 425) the serpents rise on each side of a tile instead of an altar; twice a tile projects below painted figures - the Genius No. 373, Jupiter No. 226; twice the tile is embedded in the wall below a niche (Nos. 4; 465). An interesting shrine which seems to be related to those fitted with projecting tiles is No. 223-Pi. 28, 1, where a small altar of tufa is embedded in the plaster of the wall between the heads of painted serpents; the altar itself is painted in imitation of variegated marble and offerings are painted on the wall above it. Paintings. We have already observed that painted figures of the gods may alone constitute a shrine or they may be used in combination with plastic features, that is, with niche or aedicula and its store of figurines. The use singly is not rare, but the painting is most commonly found accompanying a niche. It is from these painted representations of the household deities that we learn most about what gods and what combinations of gods were most popular, for, whereas relatively few of the plastic figures were found in place by the excavators, or, if so found, were de- scribed in the reports, the majority of the paintings were preserved and were described in the catalogues of Helbig and Sogliano. Hence we have descriptions of practically all the painted figures, including those which have perished since discovery. When the lararium painting is combined with a niche, the painting is usually done on the wall at the sides of, below, or even above the niche (Pls. 9-16), and the inner walls of the niche itself (including the side walls when the niche is large enough) may likewise be used (Pls. 2, 6; 11, 1; 13, 1 &amp; 2; 14, 1 &amp; 2). The variations in the positions of the several figures and groups of figures are many. A favorite arrange- ment of the Lares is one on each side of the niche with the accompanying Genius or one of the Penates on the back wall of the niche (Pls. 11, 1; 13, 1 &amp; 2; 14, 1). But all the figures may be included in a single horizontal panel marked off on the wall below the niche (No. 454). The serpents are regularly represented in the space below the niche, whether or not there are other figures painted within or beside the niche (Pls. 9, 1 &amp; 2 10, 2; 13, 1; 15). In one magnificent shrine (No. 118-Pl. 25, 1) a group of eight Penates is painted on the wall below and on both sides of a rather small niche. Of the three known instances where a painting accompanies a true aedicula, two have the painting on the back wall within the shrine (Nos. 211-PI. 30, 2; 371-Pl. 31), one has it on the wall of the room beside the aedicula (No. 385-Pi. 29, 2). The side and back walls of the niche of one pseudo-aedicula are painted with the figures of the Lares and the serpents (No. 162-Pl. 30, 1). We have already noted three examples of the serpents painted or in relief on the base of an aedicula (above, P. 14). The paintings which appear alone range from a simple panel with a single serpent (No. 101) to a finely executed painting covering a large section of wall (No. 316-Pl. 24, 1). Some of these paintings are accompanied by permanent altars (P1. 16, 2) or projecting tiles (P1. 27, 1 &amp; 2), and all the others must have been provided with at least a temporary altar of some sort (Pls. 17, 1; 18, 1; 21, 2 22, 1 &amp; 2). In addition, the possibility that some or all of these paintings without niche or aedicula may have been accompanied by a table or other temporary provision for plastic images must be recognized. The paintings themselves, the figures of the deities which they represent and the peculiar tech- nique which they exhibit require a detailed treatment which is being reserved for another publication. The index (s. v. PAINTINGS) contains complete lists of the figures and the religious and decorative motives represented in the paintings. Statuettes. The statuettes found in the shrines require, like the painted figures, a fuller treatment than it is possible to give them in this introduction. The index (s. v. STATUETTES) contains lists of the deities represented, as they were found in combinations</page><page sequence="14">18 GEORGE K. BOYCE or alone, within shrines or elsewhere in the house. Appendix I offers a selection of statuettes found in houses with no known shrines and in the streets of the city. Sacella. The rarest of all the forms of the lararia is the sacellum proper - a room set apart for the service of the domestic cult and especially equipped for that purpose. In some instances a special room in the house is reported to have been so set apart, but certain evidence is lacking that it was devoted exclu- sively to the purposes of religion (Nos. 4; 349; 400). There are, however, six certain examples of sacella devoted to the worship of the domestic gods: VI, i, 1, No. 132-Pl. 40, 3 &amp; 4; VI, xv, 18, No. 218; VII, ii, 20, No. 253-Pl. 41, 2; IX, viii, 3 and 6, No. 448-Pl. 40, 2; IX, ix, 6, No. 459-Pl. 41, 1; Villa of the Mosaic Columns, No. 479. In each of these sacella not only is a room especially set apart for the service of the cult, but it is furnished with benches for the worshipers, as well as a niche with or without paintings for the figures of the gods, and a permanent altar for sacrifice. Other sacella were apparently devoted to the worship of special divinities rather than to the household gods: the strange subterranean sanctuary at VIII, ii, 16, No. 344; the small sacellum at IX, ix, 12, No. 464; and the shrines of the Oriental divinities in the Casa degli Amorini Dorati, No.220, and in the Villa of Julia Felix, No.471. An interesting intermediate stage between the usual lararium located in one of the main rooms of a house and a true sacellum is represented by three shrines with altars and niches set within special recesses constructed in one wall of the atrium: Nos. 71-Pl. 39, 4; 212-Pl. 40, 1; 365-Pl. 39, 2.</page><page sequence="15">POMPEIAN LARARIA 19 BIBLIOGRAPHY WITH ABBREVIATIONS Ann.

On the N. wall of the first room is a lararium painting: Beside an altar stands the Genius, performing a sacrifice with the assistance of tibicen and camillus, the latter of whom carries a shallow dish in one hand and a cock2 (or some such bird) in the other; on each side is a Lar holding rhyton and situla.3 Around the altar upon which the Genius pours the libation is coiled a single serpent. In the lower zone there are two other serpents, confronted, one on each side of a masonry projection above which is painted a pine cone. Between these two serpents a man with an amphora bends, as if to pour its contents into a large dolium. Above his head is the graffito: HERMES.4 SOGLIANO 27; Giorn. Scavi, N.

For the graffito alone, C. I. L., iv, 3355; DELLA CORTE, Case e Abitanti, No. 387. 'Professor Lily Ross Taylor first pointed out to me the lack of evidence for the widely used term Genius familiaris. 2Probably an error in interpreting a crudely painted object, for the cock (though elsewhere associated with the Genius and certain of the Penates, cf. DE MARCHI, i, 103 note 2) was never sacrificed. The camillus probably is carrying acerra or urceus, cf. Nos. 163, 271, 417. 3Wrongiy reported by Viola as cornucopia and patera. 4With reference to the significance of this figure with the amphora and the accompanying graffito, the following opinions have been expressed: FIORELLI, Descr.: "Sembra che tale immagine fosse qui posta per accennare alla speciale tutela, che di lui e della sua industria prendevano le deita pro- tettrici della casa." MAU, Pompeji: "Vermutlich ist dies (graffito) der Name des Wirtes." DELLA CORTE, Case e Abitanti: ".l.. Ia figura dell' oste nell'atto di vuotare un'anfora di vino in un dolio." 3. (P1. 9, 2.) I, ii, 3 House. A- In the S. wall of the atrium is a rectangular niche (approximate measurements: h. 0.70, w. 0.55, d. 0.30, h. above the floor 1.60), its inside walls painted in imitation of yellow marble, its back wall hollowed out in the form of a semi-circular recess - apparently for a statuette. On the wall below the niche are the two serpents confronted at an altar - all done in white stucco relief upon a rectangular panel of red (h. 1.40, w. 1.0). Above it and below the niche ran a stucco cornice and within a small panel between this cornice and the ledge of the niche was the symbol of Isis.5 Here (the exact position is not given and no traces remain today) there was also a painted figure of the Genius with cornucopia and patera. In the same wall, to the r. and high (m. 2.30) above the floor, is a second niche - smaller and having vaulted ceiling. Fiorelli refers to both these niches as lararia, but this second probably served other purposes. FIORELLI, Descr., 37; NICCOLINI, ii, Descr. Gen., 76. 4, B- Off the S. side of the viridarium lie two small, adjoining rooms, one an apotheca, the other, according to Fiorelli, devoted only to the service of the domestic cult, In the center of the room entered from the first door stood a masonry altar, on which was painted a cock. On the S. wall a panel of white stucco (h. 1.50, w. 1.90) was marked off with red stripes and within it was the lararium painting: The Genius pours a libation upon an altar, towards which glides a large serpent, moving through plants; across the top are three small festoons, on each of which perches a little bird, SOGLIANO 58; FIORELLI, Descr., 38; VIOLA, Scavi, 10; NICCOLINI, ii, Descr.

The opening of the niche is flanked by two broad pilasters, and surmounted by disproportionately narrow architrave and low pediment. The structure itself is of masonry, but the entire front above the level of the floor of the niche is veneered with marble slabs, which, except for one red piece in the center of the tympanum, are grey; the base below this level in front, and the entire surface of the sides, are coated with stucco and painted in imitation of marble. The interior of the niche (h. 1.30, w. 0.53, d. 0.58) is painted to imitate walls covered with blue hangings. Within it stood the Parian marble statuette of Venus (h. 1.04) now in the museum at Naples, noteworthy for the preservation of the original coloring of hair, eyes and clothing4. Bull.

In the E. wall of the main room is an arched niche (h. 0.32, w. 0.32, d. 0.26, h. above the floor 1.75). 1VON ROHDEN comments thus on the heterogeneous nature of the contents of this niche: "Das ist eine wunderlicha Sammlung, und es wird schwer halten die Zusammenstellung so verschiedener Dinge zu erkidren. Es scheint, als ob der Be- sitzer allerlei Curiositdten in jener Nische aufbewahrt habe." Comparable is a collection found in a niche in a house in Regio V (the exact location is uncertain): a poorly preserved alabaster statuette; a small bronze figurine of Venus (h. 0.065); a terra-cotta head of a man, bald, beardless and having a large nose; several large bronze needles; a silver spoon; several instruments of iron: Not.

The corresponding Lar on the r. is not preserved. Below the niche are the two serpents, confronted at an altar with offerings. On the wall on each side of the niche is painted a large dog (?). The one on the 1. is poorly preserved but is seen to be lying down, while the one on the r. opens his mouth wide as if to bark, and appears to be running away to the 1. From the hindquarters of this second dog there projects horizontally the upper half of the body of a man with arms extended behind him.4 SOGLIANO 46; Giorn. Scavi, N. S., iii, 1874, 16; Bull.

B- In the E. wall of the peristyle, above one of the beds of a masonry triclinium, is a niche, described by Fiorelli as a sacrario, more fully by Mau as "un'aedicula, una base, cioe, con una piccola tavola, che sta in una specie di nicchia coperta a volta, e probabilmente conteneva un'idolo". There remain now only the solid base (0.40 by 0.32t h. 0.65) and on the wall above it the marks left by a vaulted structure which rested on the base. Bull. Inst., 1874, 262; FIORELLI, Descr., 47. 18. I, iii, 2 Taberna with thermopolium. In the N. wall is an arched niche (its condition too ruinous for measurement), its walls coated with white stucco. 4 SOGLIANO suggests that these animals are wolves and that the second may be connected with the phenomenon known as AvxavOeconwa - "a kind of madness in which the patient has the ravenous appetite and other qualities of a wolf" (Liddell and Scott). A similar scene is to be found on a votive altar from Ostia bearing a dedication (199 A. D.) to the Nymphs in gratitude for a cure from a gravis infirmitas. The dedication is accompanied by a relief repre- senting the same curious juxtaposition of a man and a dog, but described as "un cane che corre a destra e dietro a lui un' uomo barbato caduto a terra con le braccia levate in atto di implorazione" (Not. Scavi, 1920, 163 and fig. 6). Paribeni interprets the scene as explaining the cause of the illness, which apparently was due to the bite of a dog. The Pompeian painted figures are perhaps to be interpreted in the same way - a votive picture dedicated to the household divinities in gratitude for the cure of such a disease - whether hydro- phobia, as Paribeni suggests, or the more obscure AvxavOew7da. There is, however, no parallel for the representation of such a votive picture on a Pompeian lararium.</page><page sequence="20">24 GEORGE K. BOYCE 19. I, iii, 3 House. In the N.

On the r. side of the panel a huge yellow serpent with red crest and beard raises its head to the niche. Below the niche is painted a yellow cylindrical altar and around it coils a second serpent; it is much smaller than the first, has red crest and beard and raises its head above the altar to the egg which lies in a shallow dish on the top. The lower part of the panel is filled with clusters of green plants which have red, yellow and blue flowers, and upon them perch two butterflies and three birds.

E. corner, is a lararium painting, with a niche (h. 0.50, w. 0.41, d. 0.27, h. above the floor 1.60) set in the wall above it. The upper zone (h. 0.40, w. 1.30), immediately below the niche, contains the familiar sacrificial scene flanked by the figure of a Lar on each side: Each Lar is dressed in girded tunic and pallium and carries rhyton and situla. Between them stands an altar and to the 1. of it are the tibicen and a young camillus; to the r. of the altar the Genius (larger than any other figure) holds a cornucopia against his 1. shoulder, while with his r. he pours a libation from a patera. In the zone below this scene (h. 1.0, w. the same) are two red serpents, confronted, one on each side of a circular altar furnished with fruits and flowers.

In the W. wall is an arched niche (h. 0.47, w. 0.52, d. 0.27, h. above the floor 1.30), decorated simply with a dark stripe outlining the niche itself against the white background of the surrounding wall. On the wall below the niche are painted the two serpents (w. 1.40), rising, one on each side, with their heads on a level with the floor of the niche.' The serpent on the 1. is larger, has red crest and beard, and his coils are actually tied into a knot; the other serpent is smaller and has neither crest nor beard. Between them, under the niche, is painted a flaming altar in the form of a metal brazier and upon the top of it are eggs.

I, x, 4 A- Casa del Menandro. In the N. W. corner of the atrium stands a large aedicula for the household gods. A masonry podium (1.08 square, h. 1.35) is built into the corner, and above it rises a little temple, formed by a single column at the one free corner of the podium, supporting a roof of two pediments. These pediments are set at right angles to each other, one facing S., one E., so that the lower corner of one meets the lower corner of the other above the column, while the other two lower corners rest against the walls of the room. The column is Doric with a base, unfluted and painted to represent porphyry. Each pediment has a tympanum surrounded by elaborate polychrome stucco cornices - triple bands on the raking cornices, a single band accompanied by a red stripe on the horizontal architrave. Upon the blue field of each tympanum there are represented in very low stucco relief, two hippocamps heraldically confronted and set between wreaths with pendent taeniae. The roof behind the pediments was prob- ably of wood, for it has disappeared. The two free sides of the base are painted nearly alike, in imitation of colored marbles set in an elaborate geometric pattern: Around the outside runs a border of red and within it is a second, slightly wider, made up of eight rectangular slabs of green, alternating with an equal number of square blocks of yellow and red; the center of the square remaining within these borders is half filled by a diamond-shaped square of red, set diagonally, which leaves room for an isosceles right triangle of yellowish marble at each of the four corners; in the center of the reddish diamond, in turn, is set a slab of porphyry, octagonal on the S. face, circular on the E. face. This entire pattern of inset marbles is merely represented by painting upon the stucco of the podium. Around the top of this podium runs a slightly projecting cornice with polychrome stucco frieze. The upper surface of the podium is two-thirds covered by a wide but low (h. 0.13) platform which fills the corner and presents a concave outline towards the column; its free edge is ornamented with black panels, in each of which is painted a white garland. The two back walls within the shrine are painted with a design of inset marbles- like that of the sides of the base: Around the outside runs a border of red and within it are yellowish panels, in the center of each of which are set one or more porphyry disks -one on the N., three on the W. wall. The open spaces between the column and the walls were closed by wooden screens of lattice-work held together by bronze studs. The excavators were able to make a plaster cast of the</page><page sequence="24">28 GEORGE K. BOYCE empty space left by the decay of the wood of one of these screens and it is now to be seen in place on the shrine. This aedicula was built against the walls of the atrium at a time subsequent to the decoration of those walls in the Fourth Style. MAIURI, Casa del Menandro, 35 and figg. 8 and 15. 49. B- In the finely decorated exedra opening off the S. side of the peristyle at its S. W. corner, is an unusual shrine. A large rectangular, masonry podium (1.33 by 0.66, h. 0.89) is built into the S. W. corner, its longer axis parallel to the W. wall. In the W. wall above it is a shallow arched niche (h. 0.62, w. 0.86, h. above the podium 0.24), set into the center of a previously existing panel of the wall decoration. Since the niche is not located above the center of the long podium, it was thought necessary to construct a small rectangular, altar-like base of tufa (0.21 by 0.17, h. 0.25) directly before the niche on the top of the podium. The large podium is painted to represent a veneering with vertical slabs of yellow marble veined with red, placed above a dark dado. The back wall of the niche is painted in imitation of the same marble. The small, altar-like structure is coated with red stucco. There is, as Maiuri points out, sharp contrast between the technique and coloring of the decoration of this shrine and the elegant decoration of the walls of the exedra. This shrine, like that in the atrium, was constructed subsequently to the decoration of the walls of the room, which in this case is of the Second Style. Within the niche there stood in antiquity five figures of perishable material which left their impressions in the volcanic ash; of these impressions the excavators were able to take plaster casts. These are not the usual gods of the household; they are strange divinities. They are described by Maiuri as follows, in the order in which they stood in the niche, from 1. to r.: 1) Statuette of a nude youthful figure (h. 0.25), seated in an attitude of repose, apparently on the top of a rock, his legs somewhat apart, his face turned slightly l., one hand (his r.) resting upon his knee, the other upon the top of the rock; on his head he seems to wear a garland. 2) Small male head (h. 0.185), bald, resting upon a base cut in the form of a herm. 3) Male head (h. 0.30) with wide, full countenance; the eyes, mouth and nose sketchily modeled; the head is set upon a high cylinder which, in turn, stands upon a rectangular base. 4) Bust (h. 0.28) upon a rectangular base, with the features of the face almost entirely unrecognizable. 5) Head (h. 0.15) upon a square base, with the fea- tures almost entirely unrecognizable. The crudeness of these figures is in marked contrast to the finished nature of the shrine in which they stand and the prominent position which it occupies in this sumptuous house. Moreover, this crudeness is said not to result from the manner of reproduction of the figures, but to represent the real character of the originals. The rude form is, therefore, the chief characteristic of the figures and must be taken into consideration in the explanation of their signif- icance. Maiuri offers the ingenious explanation that the four heads are the imagines maiorum, citing as a parallel a crudely sculptured head of wood found in a house in Herculaneum together with a wooden sacellum to which it must have belonged (still unpublished). The statuette he explains as that of a single Lar in the pose of the Lar praestes of the Republican era and here worshiped together with the four imagines maiorum, MAIURI, Casa del Menandro, pp. 98-106 and figg. 47-49, pl. 11. 50.

D- In the kitchen which is reached through the long corridor leading off the center of the W. portico of the peristyle, on the W. wall beside the hearth, is preserved a corner of a panel of white stucco bordered in red, within which is painted the tail of a serpent.

E- In the small atrium of the Quartiere del Pro- curator, located on the ground floor on the E. side of the house, in the W. wall above a low hearth, is an arched niche (h. 0.37, w. 0.47, d. 0.27, h. above the hearth 1.05) with projecting floor. Its inside walls are coated with the same rough stucco as the walls of the room; within it still stand three terra- cotta lamps, each with a single nozzle, two of them ornamented with reliefs - one of the Sun, one of an eagle - and a small saucer-like dish.

In the E. wall is an arched niche (h. 0.28, w. 0.35, d. 0.20, h. above the floor 1.50) surrounded with a painted blue border, and before it stands a small table (0.48 by 0.17) decorated with metopes. In the center of each metope is a bucranium between paterae, and on each side of it are paterae and dolphins. The wall decoration around the niche shows the same pattern of metopes, on the red ground of each of which are represented paterae and bucrania. Within the niche nothing was found by the excavators, but a piece of tile, bearing a white mark such as would be left by an object standing upon it, led to the investigation of the earth beneath the niche. Here were discovered the fragments of a pseudo-alabaster statuette of Venus, of very crude workmanship and originally gilded. Before the image of the goddess stood a small altar of terra-cotta with conical base and a large opening in the top for incense. Not.

W. corner of the tetrastyle atrium stands an aedicula. Above a masonry base (0.75 square, h. 0.97) built into the corner, a Doric column (h. 0.75) at the one free corner and two pilasters built against the walls of the room (or rather, a square pilaster against the N. wall, an applied half-column against the W. wall) support a roof of two pediments. These pediments are set at right angles to each other, after the manner of those in the shrine in the atrium of the Casa del Menandro (No. 48). The structure is painted simply: the walls within the shrine are white with narrow green and red bands, the two tympana are red. In the center of the S. side of the base is set an arched niche (h. 0.43, w. 0.39, d. 0.25), probably to be used for storage purposes. Along the two walls within the shrine runs a low step (h. 0.12), upon which were found three statuettes: 1) a herm of white marble with the surface so worn statuettes of mediocre workmanship, each set upon a cir- cular base: 1) Venus, standing, entirely nude; she wears a high crown on her head and holds both hands raised as if arranging her hair (h. with base 0.108). 2) Mercury, standing, nude except for a chlamys over his 1. arm and a winged petasos on his head; in 1. he holds the caduceus, in r. the purse; on the base beside his r. leg stands an unidentified animal (h. with base 0.098). 3) Hercules, standing. nude except for the lion skin over his head and shoulders; in 1. he holds the club, in r. a patera (h. with base 0.11).

It is set upon a square base, likewise of terra- cotta, decorated with reliefs on two sides and forming one piece with the bust itself. From the 1. side of the head, in the rear protrudes a kind of horn which joins on to the r. edge of the base. Originally a similar horn appears to have been fixed on the r. side of the head also. The features are hardly to be distinguished: the eyes are protruding, the chin rather pointed (h. 0.11). 3) A second bust of a male figure, very similar to the preceding, with small, pointed face but no traces of horns (h. 0.10). Of these three figures, No. 1 stood against the N. wall at the W. end, No. 2 to the r. of No. 1, No. 3 against the W. wall. In addition to these figurines, there were found within the shrine: a terra-cotta lamp, a coin of Caligula, a small terra-cotta altar in the form of a vase with broad circular opening and conical foot (h. 0.18) - presumably used for sacrifice before the images - and an iron container for coals, probably for use with the little altar. In the niche in the base of the aedicula was found a terra-cotta lamp fitted with a ring. Not. Scavi, 1911, 311, photograph p. 333. 68. (P1I 13, 2.) B- In the spacious kitchen located off the S. W. corner of the smaller atrium, on the S. wall, is an interesting lararium. A rectangular space (h. 1.45, w. 1+25) is enclosed within a simple painted aedicula of slender columns supporting a pediment, The pediment represents red marble with insets of green in the center and at each lower corner. In the center of the space within the aedicula is set an arched niche (h. 0.58, w. 0.54, d. 0.18, h+ above the floor 1.58), the inside walls of which are thickly covered with spots of yellow, green and red. On the back wall is crudely painted a figure, which the report in the Not. Scavi calls Fortuna, but which certainly represents the Genius, for the dark color of the flesh indicates a male. He holds cornucopia in 1. and patera in r., though there is no altar. In the spaces at the sides of, and below the niche, but still within the painted aedicula, are the following painted figures: On each side of the niche is a Lar with rhyton and situla; these figures had been painted at least twice, the earlier appearing only partially covered over by the later. Above each Lar is sus- pended a garland, upon which perches a bird. Below the level of the niche, on the r. is a hog advancing to the 1.; on the 1. is a banquet scene with six persons upon a triclinium - three men, three women, as is apparent from the different colors of the flesh. Immediately below the niche is a single serpent, gliding r. among plants. Between the entrance door of the room and this lararium is painted a figure of Hercules with the club upon his shoulder. The whole painting is very crudely executed. Not. Scavi, 1911, 214, photograph p. 217. 69. III- Taberna located to the E. of the entrance into the smaller atrium of the Domus Obelli Firmi.

W. corner of the atrium' stands an aedicula of great interest. A high podium (0.96 by 0.86, h. 1.13) is built into the corner and its two free sides are veneered with slabs of greyish marble, set in a simple design forming a rectangular panel on each face. The center of each panel is adorned with geometric figures in fine relief. Upon'this base must have been erected an aedicula, its roof supported by three wooden pilasters or columns, the marks of the bases of which are still visible on the top of the podium. The wa1ls of the room above this base are white up to the height of m. 1.15, at which point the roof was apparently attached. Upon the top of the podium and against each of the two walls of the room are built two steps of marble; these meet at the inner corner but leave free a space 0.26 wide at each outer edge, where evidently the wooden pilasters rested upon the podium. The upper edge of the podium on each free face is adorned w th a marble slab (h. 0.13) sculptured in low relief. That on the S. side depicts a tetrastyle temple with an altar in front of it and an arch at one side, a scene which has been interpreted as representing the N. side of the forum with the temple of the Capitoline Triad. The corresponding slab on the E. face has only a criss-cross pattern, within the squares of which many small objects are represented: insects, vases, instruments. A third sculptured relief is now affixed to the N. wall above the podium; on it is depicted a scene which seems to represent the Porta Vesuviana and the adjacent water tower; but whether this slab really belongs to the lararium, or whether it was found elsewhere and subsequently placed here because of its similarity to the two on the base, is unknown.2 Bull.

The usual projection of the floor is accom- panied in this case by a similar projecting ledge surrounding the niche on all sides - apparently a degenerate aedicula faqade.

On the wall below the niche is painted the altar with two confronted serpents; upon the altar are two eggs and a pine cone. On the floor beneath the niche stood a travertine support upon which lay a bronze object in the form of a sea shell, which, from its position, would seem to have had some unexplained connection with the household cult.'

W. corner of the first peristyle, in the E. wall beside the hearth and above a masonry table, is an arched niche (h. 0.42, w. 0.42, d. 0.20, h. above the table 0.62), coated with successive layers of stucco - the last red, a previous one white. Upon the ground of the earlier white stucco were painted: on the side walls, red flowers, and on the back wall, a figure done in yellow, of which only the feet are now visible perhaps a Lar. Rum. Mitt., ix, 1894, 53. 96. (Pl. 39, 3.) C- Through the kitchen, entrance is gained to another peristyle and some adjacent rooms which seem to have belonged to another house with entrance from the unexcavated street on the E. of the Insula - a house which, in the last days of the city, had been connected with that having its entrance at No. 15. In this second peristyle, on the N. wall is an unusual shrine. Upon a panel of white stucco is painted an aedicula (h. 1.23, w. 0.80), done in blue, yellow, dark-red and green. Within the aedicula is the figure of Jupiter (h. 0.46) seated upon a kline, the upper part of his body nude, the lower part wrapped in a green garment; against his 1. shoulder rests the sceptre, the in the r. he holds thunderbolt. Beside 1 Mau's description reads: "una conca di bronzo a due anse mobili, a. 0.263, dal diametro di 0.460, posta sopra un piede scanalato di 'travertino', che sta tuttora appie della sopradescritta nicchia del larario, e ha nella sua superficie (che era coperta dalla conca) incise le lettere AX", Rom. Mitt., 53. The de- scription of the travertine base in the Not. Scavi, 1893, 213 gives the height as 0.65. him on the ground stands the eagle. Against the wall below the painting stands a masonry ara pulvinata (0.38 by 0.30, h. 0.70) coated with white stucco. R6m. Mitt., ix, 1894, 55; Not. Scavi, 1896, 439. 97, D- Off the S. W. corner of the second peristyle opens a large room which may have been a kitchen, and on the E. side of it is a narrow corridor, in the E. wall of which is a rectangular niche (h. 0.54, w. 0.46, d. 0.16, h. above the floor 1.20) which Mau calls a lararium. Its walls are coated with white stucco and in the floor are three holes for the bases of statuettes. The wall around the niche is covered with the same white stucco for a space of m. 1.20 on all sides and upon it as a background the niche is outlined in black. In the wall below, a semicircular receptacle of terra-cotta is embedded in the floor of an arched niche. In the bottom of the receptacle is a round hole, as if for drainage, which suggests a connection with the water supply. Rdm.

A- In the first room behind the taberna, on the W. wall to the r. of the entrance, is a finely preserved lararium painting (h. 1.30, w. 1.90 including a broad red stripe surrounding the panel on all four sides): In the upper zone (h. 0.68) the Genius, wreathed and holding cornucopia in 1., pours a libation from a patera held in his r. upon a cylindrical altar, which is painted in imitation of red and yellow marble and has a blazing fire on the top. On the opposite side of the altar a tibicen in long white garment plays the double flutes. On each side of this group stands a Lar, wearing tunic and pallium and holding rhyton and situla. The tunic of each Lar has a broad red stripe down the front and is yellow on the side turned towards the altar, blue on the other; the pallium is red. Three garlands with taeniae, in red, yellow and green, are painted across the top of the panel, while two others hang down on the sides. Above the garlands were three divinities: on the 1. is the Sun, wearing radiate crown, white tunic and red mantle and holding in his r. a whip; in the center was the figure of Mercury, of which</page><page sequence="32">36 GEORGE K.

On the 1. side of the serpent, corresponding to Sarnus on the r., there was originally another figure, now vanished. The background of both zones is filled with plants which have red flowers; above the coils of the serpent is a single bird in flight. Not. Scavi, 1883, 425; 1884, 52; Bull.

B- In a rear room occupying the position of the peristyle in houses of more regular plan, in the N. wall, high above the floor, is a large arched niche (h. 0.80, w. 0.65, d. 0.35, h. above the floor 2.90) with heavy projecting ledge beneath it. On the back wall of this niche is painted a burning altar adorned with a garland and furnished with two eggs, and on each side of the altar is a palm branch - yellow with red ribbon attached. The wall around the niche is covered with white stucco, which, below the niche, is studded with red spots representing a dado,i down as far as a row of holes, where was attached a kind of mezzanine by means of which the niche was reached. At a late date this structure was removed and Mau supposes the niche to have been reached thereafter by a portable ladder. Bull. Inst., 1885, 256. 103. V, ii, W. side, No. 7, counting from the S.

In the wall above it is an arched niche (h. 0.58, w. 0.50, d. 0.27; h. above the floor 1.45). The last layer of plain white stucco has fallen from the interior walls, revealing a finer layer beneath it - white and decorated with red spots. Rom. Mitt., viii, 1893, 7; Not.

B- Against the W. wall of the small space which precedes the portico looking out on the garden from the N. side, is built a masonry bench, and in the wall above it is embedded a slab of tufa surrounded by an aedicula faqade (h. 0.32, w. 0.28, h. above the floor 1.30). In the center of the tufa slab is a phallus in relief. A similar slab with a phallus in relief is found high up in the E. wall of the garden of the same house, this slab, too, being surrounded by an aedicula facade (h. 0.34, w. 0.30, h. above the floor 2.50).

One of the huge serpents has the lower part of its body coiled around this altar and raises its head to the offerings on the top. The second serpent is painted on the wall to the 1. of the niche and raises its head to the niche, rather than to the altar. The background is white and adorned with plants, while across the top painted festoons hang from painted nails, and from the festoons themselves hang two metal cups with broad rims, each of which has one circular handle. The dado below the painting is made to represent a three-dimensional podium, upon which the altar seems to stand; this dado is violet in the center and yellow on each side. Rom. Mitt., viii, 1893, 18; Not. Scavi, 1910, 328. 107. (PI. 17, 2.) B- In the kitchen entered from the N. E. corner of the atrium, on the S. wall, is the lararium. In the center of a panel of white plaster (h. 1.95, w. 1.80) is a square niche (h. 0.22, w. 0.24, d. 0.20, h. above the floor 1.25), its walls covered with white stucco outlined in red decorated with red spots. On each side of this niche were painted the figures of the sacrificial scene, but the plaster on the 1. has fallen, so that there remain only figures on the r.: the tibicen, wearing wreath, long yellowish mantle and dark boots; farther to the r. a Lar (poorly preserved) and, beyond him, a boy leading a hog decorated with a red band about its belly. Still farther r. there seems to have been a serpent, which would be the third in the composition, for in the lower zone two huge serpents rise more or less vertically, one on each side of a small cylindrical altar painted in imitation of red and yellow variegated marble. Not. Scavi, 1910, 330. 108. (P1. 8, 1.) C- Behind the tablinum is a narrow space preceding the garden, and in its N. wall, to the r. of the door, is an arched niche (h. 0.60, w. 0.52, d. 0.22, h. above the floor 1.22), below which a stucco-covered ledge projects far (0.18) from the wall. The niche is framed by a well-preserved aedicula fagade, elaborately decorated with polychrome stucco work. The capitals of the antae and the architraves which rest upon them, as well as the cornice running around the curve of the vault, and the edge of the projecting floor, are all adorned with modeled bands painted in red, white and blue. The antae themselves are brownish, bordered in red. The vaulted ceiling is decorated with crude stars in red and green. The 1 Cf. the similar brazier in a painting of the serpents at I, vii, 10-12, B. lunette formed by the upper portion of the back wall is blue and surrounded by a stucco frieze. The back wall itself is bordered on each side by a painted green pilaster, within which a red border, curving in arabesques across the top, outlines a white panel, in the center of which, beneath two garlands - one yellow, one green - is painted the figure of Hercules (h. 0.33). He stands facing front, is bearded, and wears a wreath of leaves; over his 1. shoulder he holds the club, and the lion skin is thrown over the same shoulder and arm; in the r. he holds the skyphos. On his r. stands a painted altar of yellowish marble with a blazing fire on the top and on each side of it is a laurel bush. On his 1. is a hog which raises its snout to the edge of the lion skin. This lararium was found with its equipment com- plete: 1) A bronze statuette of Mercury (h. including the base 0.14) with traces of gilding; 1he is nude except for the chlamys over r. shoulder; on his head he has a crown of leaves; in his r. he holds the purse. The workmanship is good with many anatomical details represented. 2) A terra-cotta statuette of Minerva (h. 0.13), wearing long, girded chiton and helmet; with the 1. hand she holds the shield, The inside of the shield, the crest of the helmet and the surface of the base were rose-colored, the rest white, so far as can be determined. 3) A bronze statuette (h. 0.05) representing a kneeling woman extending both hands before her body with palms turned upward. The perfectly horizontal position of the hands, which are on a level with the top of the head, suggests that the figure was in- tended to support some object. But whatever the intention of the maker, the statuette must have been placed in the shrine as an adoring figure. The woman wears a Doric chiton with apoptygma of fine material, to judge from the folds of the drapery. Several minor objects: a terra-cotta votive head of a Bacchante (h. 0.12), wearing a crown of vine leaves - of rough workmanship; a small circular altar (h. 0.10) of terra-cotta, in the form of a vase on a stand, with traces of fire on the top; a terra- cotta lamp; an amulet in the form of a dolphin; two coins an as of Germanicus and a sestertius of Nero.

BOYCE the peristyle, on the W. wall above the hearth, is a lararium painting: In the center stands a round altar, upon which a pine cone and other offerings are visible, and around which a serpent is coiled. On each side stands a Lar (h. 0.64) in the usual attire. To the r. behind the Lar, a man leads a reluctant hog. The zone below is not well preserved; in it remain only traces of the foliage through which the customary serpents must have glided. Rom. Mitt., viii, 1893, 54; Not.

The lower section of the W. wall of this room is filled with a large painting (h. 1.50, w. 2.00) of the two serpents confronted at an altar; the serpent on the r. is larger and has red crest and beard, that on the 1. has a smaller body and neither appendage; the altar is cylindrical and painted in imitation of red and yellow marble and has on the top a fire and a pine cone. Across the top of the zone is stretched a triple garland which hangs down on both sides; between it and the serpents is a single bird in flight. Not. Scavi, 1910, 328. 1 1 1. (PI. 3 8. 1.) V, iii, 4 House. A long corridor leads back from the entrance to a central room which looks out upon the garden from the south; in the N. W. corner of this room is an interesting lararium. Into the N. wall is set an arched niche (h. 0.53, w. 0.51, d. 0.22) and below it a high masonry base (0.92 by 0.33, h. 1.13) is built into the corner with its longer axis parallel to the N. wall. The ruins of a masonry projection on the wall above the niche show that there was originally a roof with pediment, the front end of which was supported by two columns. The marks of their bases are visible on the top of the projecting podium. The interior of the niche is painted blue, and around the inside walls, near the top, runs a white cornice of modeled stucco; the vaulted ceiling of the niche is ornamented with a sea shell in stucco. Around the curve of the niche on the wall of the room runs a stucco cornice with an egg design in relief, while the sides of the niche are bordered with stucco pilasters with capitals and bases. The masonry podium is covered with stucco painted to represent reddish variegated marble with insets: rectangles of red and diamonds of yellow and a large green slab in the center of each of the two free s.des -circular on the S. side, diamond-shaped on the E. side. Along the top of the base runs aw modeled stucco cornice in red, white and blue, Not.

In the W. wall of the garden is a large rectangular niche (h. 1.18, not including the bases of the pilasters, w. 1.75, d. 0.32) reaching to the ground. On the wall around it is an aedicula fagade: two wide pilasters surmounted by projecting Corin- thian capitals, upon which rest architrave and pedi- ment. The pilasters are painted red and ornamented with a design in white stucco running up each side. The pediment, which extends far beyond the supporting pilasters on each side, is decorated with polychrome stucco cornices surrounding the blue tympanum. The interior of the niche was divided into upper and lower compartments by a partition, the marks of which are visible on the side walls. On the back wall of the upper chamber (h. 0.68), on a white ground, is painted a single serpent with red crest and beard, advancing l1 towards a cylin- drical altar which is painted in the usual imitation of variegated marble, In the background are plants, and across the top is suspended a double garland with taeniae. Upon the back wall of the lower compartment, upon a ground of solid red, is an aedicula fagade done in white stucco relief, within which stands the painted figure of Ceres. She wears a crown of ears of grain and holds in her 1. a torch, in r. a sheaf of grain. This figure is painted in a masterly manner in white monochrome. The difference in style and technique between the dec- oration of the lower and the upper compartments is striking. That of the lower is carefully harmonized with the delicate work of the ornaments of the aedicula facade of the niche, that of the upper is of the coarser and more familiar lararium art. On the walls of the lower compartment are to be seen the marks of a second partition, apparently the floor of the niche. In the same wall, close beside this niche on the r+, is a second rectangular niche (h. 0.53, w. 0.40, d. 0.30, h. above the floor 0.80), having no aedicula facade but only a projecting slab for the ceiling and another for the floor. The top surface of this pro- jecting floor is covered within the niche by a second floor (0.07 thick), which gives the appearance of a raised step within the niche. The interior of the niche is white, outlined with red stripes and decorated on the side walls with Fourth Style designs. The floor is painted in imitation of red and yellow marble. The wall below the niche is covered with a painted garden decoration. Gaibrici (in Not. Scavi) assumes that both these niches served as lararia. Certainly the larger was a house shrine, but there is no indication of religious usage for the other. Not. Scavi, 1902, pp. 206, 208.</page><page sequence="35">POMPEIAN LARARIA 39 113. V, iii, 8 A small house transformed into a pistrinum late in the history of the city. In the N. wall of the room with the mill stones, is an arched niche (h. 0.55, w. 0.70, d. 0.27, h. above the floor 1.30). The last coating of stucco has fallen away, revealing beneath it an earlier one - a yellow back wall decorated with red spots and solid red side walls. Not. Scavi, 1902, 208. 114. (P1. 22, 3.) V, iii, 9 House. The N. wall of the atrium between the doors to two side rooms is covered with a fine coat of white plaster as background for the lararium (h. 1.80, w. 1.00). In the center is an arched niche (h. 0.33, w. 0.42, d. 0.30, h. above the floor 1.35), within which the excavators found a small undecorated altar of marble. The interior of the niche is white like the surrounding wall and on the ceiling are painted rude red and yellow stars. The curve of the vault is bordered, both on the back wall within the niche and on the wall outside, by a painted linear design in red, green and orange. On the wall outside, on each side of the niche, is painted a Lar. He is wreathed, wears a tunic which is yellow on the side turned to the niche, green on the other, pallium and high boots, and carries rhyton and patera. Each Lar is represented standing upon a painted rec- tangular base (of imitation red and yellow marble), as if he were conceived, not as the god himself, but as one of the bronze statuettes which were placed within the shrines. Below the niche is painted a single serpent, rising among plants to a tiny altar painted on the 1. side of the panel. The serpent is green with yellow under side and has small red crest and beard; the altar is painted to imitate red and white marble and has an egg and fruit in the fire on the top. Not.

This dado is divided into four panels by vertical lines and in each panel, upon a white ground, is painted a plant upon which birds are perched. Above it a zone (h. 1.0) contains four figures (from 1. to r.): First, to the r. of a green plant stands Mercury, wearing violet chlamys, winged petasos and winged boots; with the r. he holds the purse at the level of his breast and in the 1. the caduceus against his shoulder. Traces of an older painting show that this figure was formerly represented more in profile and that the purse was held outstretched in the r. Close to the 1. foot of the god stands a cock, facing 1., and to the r. of it is an omphalos around which a serpent is coiled. The next figure is that of Victoria, advancing to the r., wearing a long brown garment which flies open and leaves the r. thigh bare; on her head she has a wreath and on her shoulders green wings; in the 1. she holds a palm, in the r. a yellow wreath which she is about to place on the head of Hercules, who stands to her 1. in the center of this zone. He is wreathed, holds the club by his side with the r., a bow in the 1., and has the lion skin thrown over the 1. arm. Between Victoria and Hercules is a hog which runs towards the latter. Farther r. stands Minerva, clad in long, violet-red chiton with green border and yellow mantle; on her breast the gorgoneion; on her head the helmet with threefold crest. Her 1. she rests upon a long spear and extends the r. to pour a libation from a patera upon an altar which stands between her and Hercules. Against her 1. leg leans a large round shield adorned with a gorgoneion. Farther r. an owl perches upon a high square pilaster which stands among plants and closes the panel on this side. Across the top of the zone just described runs a white cornice of modeled stucco, adorned with a narrow red stripe. Upon this cornice rest the bases of two white stucco pilasters (h. 0.97, w. 0,11, 1.46 apart). They support epistyle and pediment, both molded in the manner of the stucco cornices of the Fourth Style and painted white with a narrow</page><page sequence="36">40 GEORGE K. BOYCE blue stripe. The pediment is adorned with figures in stucco relief: in the center of the tympanum a wreath of pointed leaves (probably laurel), above the gable peak a patera, at the r. extremity of the pediment (the 1. is destroyed) a mask which was probably intended for a gorgoneion. Into the wail in the center of the space enclosed by this aedicula facade, is set a vaulted niche (h. 0.48, w. 0.42, d. 0.28), adorned with a stucco pilaster on each side, a molded stucco cornice around the curve of the vault, and a projecting ledge. The inside walls are white outlined with red stripes. Within the niche undoubtedly stood bronze figures of those divinities - the Genius and the Lares1 - who are not represented in the paintings. The panels between the sides of the niche and the pilasters of the aedicula faqade contain the figures of Venus Pompeiana (on the 1.) and Fortuna (on the r.), both poorly preserved. Venus (h. 0.85) wears a green dress, rests her 1. arm upon a steering rudder and holds an olive branch in the r., which she raises to her chin; to her 1. upon a base stands Amor with a mirror. Of the figure of Fortuna only the head with a small modius and the cornucopia against her 1. shoulder can be distinguished. On the same level with the figures of Venus and Fortuna, but outside the aedicula facade, are those of Bacchus (on the 1.) and Jupiter (on the r.). Bacchus (h. 0.70) has a red garment thrown over the 1. arm and holds a thyrsus in that hand; with the r. he lowers a kantharos, pouring a stream of wine into the mouth of the panther which stands at his side; the upper part of his figure is missing; on both sides are vines. Jupiter (h. 0.75) is seated upon a throne, over the back of which a green mantle is thrown, his feet resting upon a footstool; the upper part of his body is nude, the lower part wrapped in a red garment; he leans his head upon his 1. hand, supporting that elbow upon the arm of the throne, and gazes to the 1. and downward; a sceptre rests against his 1. shoulder, in the r. he holds a thunderbolt. In each of the two triangular panels above the pedi- ment is painted an eagle in flight, holding a palm in its talons. In the field above the figure of Jupiter a peacock perches upon a garland; the corresponding field above Bacchus is destroyed. 1 Among the objects found in the ruins of two cupboards in the room to the E. of the atrium, together with a hoard of 130 silver and 54 bronze coins, were three bronze statuettes of the household gods: the Genius (h. with base 0.08) of the usual type, and the two Lares (h. 0.119), each holding cornucopia and patera and apparently standing solidly on both feet. A marble statuette of Venus Anadyomene (h. 0.365) found in this collection and a small marble altar from the atrium may likewise have belonged to this shrine: Not.

Of the figures in the top zone only the lower parts are preserved to the height of 0.25: In the center stands a tripod and around it are three figures, to the r. the Genius, who is largest; to the 1. the tibicen and the camillus. On each side stands a Lar and beyond, on the 1., a naked man leads a hog, which he holds by tail and ear. The second zone (h. 0.72) contains only a serpent advancing r.; its head and the altar which must have been represented above the hearth are now missing. In the third zone (i. e. the dado, h. 0.50) are kitchen utensils and articles of food. (from 1. to r.) two suspended sausages, an eel on a spit, a suspended gridiron, a hog's head, another indistinguishable object and several birds. Below the hog's head is a cooking pot on a tripod.

She wears red chiton and green mantle and a small modius on her head; in her r. is a rudder, with her 1. she holds a cornucopia against her shoulder. Not. Scavi, 1899, 345 with photograph p. 346; Rom. Mitt., xvi, 1901., 326. 123. (P1. 7, 1.) B- On the N. wall of the atrium, near the N. W. corner, a rectangular space is covered with a special panel (h. 1.10, w. 0.95) of rough white stucco and in it is set an irregular rectangular niche (h. 0.60, w. 0.30, d. 0.32, h. above the floor 1.90), adorned with a large and ornate, but crudely executed, aedicula fa9ade. Beneath the niche a heavy shelf projects (0.10) from the wall and upon it rest two crude applied columns, without flutings or capitals, which border the niche on the sides. Above the niche is a disproportionately large pediment with its red tympanum surrounded by modeled stucco bands on raking cornices and architrave. These cornices, like that which adorns the edge of the projecting shelf below the niche, are painted in red, green and white. The interior of the niche is white, outlined with red stripes and decorated on the ceiling with green and red star-like ornaments. The irregularity and lack of proportion in the niche and the aedicula fagade are remarkable: the interior walls are all askew; the projecting shelf extends 0.10 beyond the base of the column on one side but not on the other; the feeble attempt at simple applied columns contrasts strangely with the huge and elaborate pediment. Within the niche were found the following figures. 1) A bronze bust of Minerva wearing the aegis and helmet (h. 0.17). She leans backward in a peculiar manner upon a bronze plate fitted with a sort of handle at the back. Sogliano (in Not. Scavi) explains the curious form as possibly that of a pulvinar for the ceremony of lectisternium. 2) A roughly worked alabaster figure of Venus (h. 0.174) wearing a mural crown. Beside her to the 1., upon a base like a table leg, stands a small figure clad in a long garment. Venus seems to hold her 1. arm around the smaller figure, while the latter places her r. hand upon the head of the goddess, but these positions are very uncertain. Sogliano suggests that we have here Victoria crowning Venus. This group stood upon a mnarble-covered base behind the bust of Minerva. 3) A small, standing male figure of ivory (h. 0.058), nude and unbearded. The 1. hand rests upon a tripod (h. 0.03) and both the figure and the tripod stand upon a round base, to the bottom of which is attached a bronze object for insertion into the floor of the niche. Sogliano calls the figure Venus; Mau (in R6m. Mitt.) thinks it certainly male. In addition to these figures, there were also in the niche two small rectangular altars (h. 0.21 and 0.135, w. 0.15 and 0.195) and two plates (diam. 0.10 and 0.12), all of terra-cotta. Not.

E. corner of the im- pluvium, is a square pillar, built evidently with the intention of closing off to some extent the space E. of the impluvium which served as kitchen. In the W. side of this pillar, facing the impluvium, is set a niche (h. 0.38, w. 0.30, d. 0.26, h. above the floor 1.02), with slightly arched ceiling and a pro- jecting floor. Above and to the r. of the niche is a yellow laurel wreath with pendent taeniae hung from a nail - all done in stucco relief.' Within the niche were found: an iron knife with bronze handle, an iron hammer, a bronze rosette.2 In the same face of the pillar, m. 2.0 above the floor, is another, slightly larger, rectangular niche - prob- ably for storage purposes.

E. corner of the kitchen described above in "C" stands a small hearth and in the E. wall above it is a high, arched niche (h. 0.90, w. 0.46, d. 0.30, h. above the hearth 0.20), its walls coated with plain white stucco. On its floor stands a masonry block (0.25 by 0.20, h. 0.15) - apparently for use as an altar, and behind it a step (h. 0.10) is built against the back wall. In the center of this step is the mark left by some oval object which had stood there, probably a statuette. Still another altar, cylindrical and of terra-cotta, was found within this niche. Not.

A- The N. side of the viridarium is entirely open except for a narrow section of wall (1.15 wide) in the N. W. corner. This section is coated with white stucco and marked off as a panel by broad red stripes, and in it is set a large, irregular arched niche (h. 0.88, w. 0.65, d. 0.25, h. above the floor 1.30). The corners within the niche are outlined in red, ' On the S. wall of the atrium, near its W. end, was a large patera in white stucco relief, adorned with a wreath of laurel, likewise of stucco relief, but yellow in color. 2 For similar contents of a shrine cf.

The back wall is painted blue, studded with red and yellow spots and yellow stars with red centers. The white side walls within the niche, a broad border on the wall outside, surrounding the opening of the niche, and the edge of the heavy projecting shelf below it, are all decorated in the same manner. On the ground before the niche stands a masonry ara pulvinata (0.35 square, h. 0.70) covered with stucco, and having in its upper surface a rec- tangular hollow in which traces of fire were seen by the excavators. Around the corner from this niche, on the W. wall of the open area which precedes the viridarium on the N., above the dado of brickwork, is a broad sheet of white plaster (h. 0.80, w. 2.20) and upon it are painted two yellow serpents confronted at a cylindrical altar furnished with fruits; in the background are plants. In the pavement below this painting are the marks left by a square masonry altar. Not. Scavi, 1905, 91 f. 127. B- In the kitchen located in the N.

The E. end of the S. portico of the pseudo- peristyle was walled off and converted into a kitchen sometime after the construction of the house, and in the" exterior side of the W. wall of this kitchen, under the portico, was set a niche (h. 0.44, w. 0.48, d. 0.12, h. above the floor 1.10) with slightly arched ceiling. Below it a heavy shelf projects (0.20) from the wall and upon it, in front, is constructed a low rectangular'elevation (0.20 by 0.24) with raised rim around the edges -apparently a built-in altar; in the floor of the niche behind this altar are two holes for the insertion of the bases of statuettes. Within the niche and on the surrounding wall is the lararium painting, crudely done upon a ground of yellow: Above and to the sides hung garlands. On the back wall of the niche the Genius pours a libation upon a cylindrical altar, on the opposite side of which stands the tibicen. On the wall outside the niche iq a Lar on each side, the one on the r. holding rhyton and situla, that on the 1., strangely enough, rhyton and a cup like a skyphos. On the 1. side wall of the niche, between the Lar on that side and the back wall of the niche, is the popa leading a hog. Below the level of the niche on the 1. side, is Mercury with petasos, caduceus and purse; behind him, suspended, two crescent-shaped objects. These three figures on the 1. side are painted on the column of the peristyle which is partially built into the W. wall of the kitchen at this point. Immediately below the niche a crested serpent (two serpents according to Sogliano in the Not. Scavi, one according to Mau in the R6m. Mitt.) glides to the 1. among plants. The surface of this painting had been covered over in antiquity with a thin coating of plaster, as if in preparation for a repainting. Not. Scavi, 1901, 331; RNm. Mitt., xvi, 1901, 362. 130.

At the N. end of the E. wall of the viri- darium, and so placed that it is in the center of the portion of the wall seen at the end of the passage which leads back from the atrium, is an arched niche (h. 0.57, w. 0.45, d. 0.23, h. above the floor 1.30) with heavy ledge projecting far (0.20) beyond the surface of the wall. Upon this ledge is placed an ordinary roof tile, the raised edges of which, when covered with stucco, would give the appearance of an ara pulvinata. The back wall was painted blue or green and decorated with plants. Whether this is a lararium or a niche of primarily decorative character, it is difficult to decide.2 It might be either, but since there is no lararium else- where in the house, I am inclined to think that this niche served that purpose.3 Not.

A passage leads back from the large open area with the masonry triclinium to the door of a small room located in the N. E. corner of the building, which served as sacellum. In the E. wall at the end of this passage is set an arched niche (h. 0.45, w. 0.32, d. 0.20, h. above the floor 1.35), its walls coated with stucco which was originally decorated with painted red, rose-like, flowers. The wall around the niche is covered with a rectangular panel (h. 0.75, w. 0.90) of special stucco painted red. The niche is not set into the center of this panel, but near the N. side of it, close to the door which leads into the sacellum. Along the N. wall of the passage, between its W. end and the door of the sacellum, is built a low bench. The sacellum is a rectangular, windowless room (1.80 by 2.00) with red walls and low benches running around three of the sides, except for the space oc- cupied by the door and that immediately below the niche. This niche (h. 0.65, w. 0.50, d. 0.28, h. above the floor 1.0) is placed in the E. end of the N. wall, directly opposite the entrance door; its ceiling is vaulted; its walls are coated with white stucco and painted on sides and vault with floral ornaments; the back wall is outlined with red stripes and upon it is still visible the painting which was reproduced and described by Mazois: a wreathed figure,' wearing blue tunic and having a green mantle wrapped around her legs, reclines upon a kline; she holds in 1. a cornucopia, in r. a kantharos; before the kline stands a table and upon it are a jar and an acerra; across the top of the painting is stretched a heavy garland with fruit, On the wall outside, a slightly raised border (w. 0.18) of stucco surrounds the opening of the niche. On the floor in front, and 0.35 from the N. wall, stands a masonry altar, decorated (according to Pomp. Ant. Hist.) with the figure of a pig which wears a garland on its head. HELBIG 71; Pomp. Ant.

On the E. wall of the small garden there was a shrine for Egyptian deities, which had disappeared before Helbig made his descriptions. His description, taken from the report in Pomp, Ant. Hist., runs as follows: Within a niche set in the back wall of the garden are painted three figures: one female, presumably Isis, with sistrum in r. and cornucopia in 1.; a second male, bearded, holding in r. a situla, in 1. a cornucopia - probably Osiris; between the two stands Harpocrates, naked, in his 1. a cornucopia, the index finger of his r. held to his lips. Each of the three wears a golden lotus flower upon his forehead. Below the niche a brick altar (0,34 by 0.39, h. uncertain) stands upon the floor of the room; it is coated with red stucco and upon it is painted a yellow candelabrum. In this wall, which is still well preserved, there are now no traces of the niche. Certainly it was not a niche set into the wall in the usual manner, but may have been formed of stucco applied to, and projecting from, the wall, Much of the niche may have been merely indicated in painting, though apparently not all of it, to judge from the words of Pomp. Ant. Hist.: "Sul muro che fa ii prospetto principale, nella parte superiore, resta a meta dipinta una nicchia con frontispizio sopra. Su alcuni scalini, in questa, sono espresse due figure..." Apparently the wall around the niche was decorated with a special background for the shrine of the Egyptian gods. According to the same description, the lower part of the wall was black, and on it, on each side, were painted two date trees with fruit and various other plants; among the plants were birds of several species, including a peacock. The upper part of the wall was painted with "some buildings, bridges, etc. on the shore of the sea". Across the top of the wall ran a double festoon of thick foliage.

Upon a rectangular base, painted red, a heavy pro- jecting ledge adorned with triple bands of stucco ornament supports a platform (1.10 by 0.35, h. above the floor 0.75), upon which rest the bases of two tall, fluted columns (h. 1.30) with bases and capitals - all coated with white stucco. The columns, in turn, support a pediment, the tympanum of which is surrounded by a double cornice of stucco relief. The back wall within the aedicula is hollowed out to form a shallow semi-circular niche, and painted blue. MAZOIS, ii, 69; FIORELLI, Descr., 89; NICCOLINI, ii, Descr. Gen., 26. 143. VI, ii, 28 House.

High up in the E. wall of the garden is an arched niche (h. 0.60, w. 0.49, d. 0.23, h. above the floor 2.05); below it and to the 1. a masonry ara pulvinata (0.45 square, h. 0.70) stands upon the floor of the room. The niche was apparently undecorated, but the altar was coated with red stucco, while on the wall behind the altar was a rectangle (w. 1.63, h. not given) of white stucco which served as the background for the lararium painting. On this ground, in the space on each side of the altar is painted a large serpent, rising vertically amid heavy foliage, its head far above the top of the altar. Each serpent (according to the print in Mazois) has extended tongue, a very sparse beard, and two horn-like projections on the top of its head, which replace the usual crest. Between the heads of the two serpents, and directly above the top of the masonry altar, is the figure of the Genius, holding his r. above the top of a golden cylindrical altar painted on his r. Helbig described a cornucopia in his 1., though it is not to be seen in the print in Mazois. Behind and to the 1. of the painted altar stand two slender trees.1 lag, also wahrscheinlich zu Insula I1 gehorte." The dates of the excavation of the several insulae given by FIORELLI, Descr. (e. g. p. 82), confirm this supposition, for Insula II is the only one being excavated in August 1810. Yet the de- scriptions of the location of the house given in Pomp. Ant. Hist. (July 21 - Aug. 18, 1810, pp. 41f. and 237) seem to indicate that the kitchen in question is located, either in the same insula as the Accademia di Musica (VI, iii, 7), or across the street from it in VI, vi or VI, Ins. Occidentalis. But from Fiorelli we learn that Insula iii and Insula Occidentalis had been completely excavated before this date, while Insula vi was not to be touched for three years. Finally, it is clear that the two reports in Pomp. Ant. Hist., pp. 41 and 237, refer to the same shrine, and not, as HELBIG supposed, to different ones (cf. HELBIG 54). The shrine referred to on p. 41 he supposed was that in the taberna at VI, iv, 3/4, but neither the location described, nor the date of excavation, nor yet the nature of the shrine can be interpreted as applying to that lararium. 'There is a remarkable similarity between this shrine, as it is reproduced in MAZOIS, and that attributed to the Temple of Isis in vol. iv, pi. 11, 5 of the same work. The latter shows the altar, the serpents in exactly the same positions and having the same curious horns, the Genius at the side of the painted altar, and the two trees in precisely the same positions beside that altar - all in the same pro- portions as in the shrine pictured in vol. ii. The only differences are, that the foliage through which the serpents rise is less dense, and that there is no niche. This striking similarity either is the result of an error in making two different drawings of the same shrine and subsequently confusing one of them with a shrine in the Temple of Isis, or is an example of a The asymmetry noticeable in so many of the shrines at Pompeii is particularly striking in the case of this one, with its niche far to the r. of the center of the altar.

B- On the N. wall of the room entered at No. 4, between the door to the room with the counter and a recess in the N. E. corner which may have been a latrine, is a painted shrine, enclosed within a stucco aedicula faqade. Above a strip of the ordinary red stucco of the wall which serves as dado (h. 0.90), a rectangular panel (h. 0.65, w. 1.28) of white stucco is marked off with red stripes. Above it a rectangle of somewhat smaller dimensions is enclosed within the aedicula faqade (h. 0.95, w. 1.05). This facade of low relief consists of two fluted half-columns which rest upon a base ornamented with a frieze and support a pediment. The tympanum is blue and upon it some sort of ornamental figure (no longer distinguishable) was painted in red; it is surrounded by a stucco frieze modeled with an "S" pattern. The painting (h. 0.45, w. 0.88) within the aedicula shows the figure of the Genius standing on the r. of a yellow altar; he wears a toga with a fold, on which the red border is visible, drawn over his head, and holds a cornucopia in I., a patera in r. Behind the altar stands the tibicen and toward the same altar coil the two serpents, one from each side. On each side of this group stands a Lar, clad in yellow tunic, green girdle and red pallium, and not standing on the same level as the other figures, but higher than they. The lower rectangle appears to have been designed to contain painted figures also, but there are none now visible and none are described in the earlier reports. The opposite side of the wall upon which this painting is done, i. e. the S. wall of the taberna proper, shows the outlines of a large arched niche (h. and w. about 0.60), which seems to have been originally a shrine, filled up when the new shrine was painted in the adjoining room.

In the lower zone are two huge serpents confronted at a cylindrical altar with offerings; that on the r. has crest and beard and is larger than that on the 1., which has only the crest. In the background are plants, and above the altar is suspended a small garland with taeniae. The painting described above is enclosed within a painted aedicula of the simpler Fourth Style: a rectangular pilaster on each side, supporting a flat roof with timbered ceiling.

The structure is elaborately decorated: The vaulted ceiling is ornamented with painted red and blue flowers; around the top of the three inner walls runs a cornice of modeled stucco painted in various colors and including two oblong panels on each wall, within each of which a hunting scene is painted in min- iature; the opening of the niche towards the S. is adorned on each side with a delicate half-column of stucco applied to the side wall and apparently supporting the front end of the stucco cornice mentioned above. On the back wall of the niche is painted an elaborate aedicula, done in the manner of the Fourth Style in many colors; above it are suspended garlands and upon them perch two peacocks on each of the side walls are garlands and arabesques and, in the center, a mask; on the edge of the side wall, to the 1. of the opening of the niche, is painted a candelabrum. In this elaborate setting are painted the Lares and the serpents, the former (h. 0.50) beneath the aedicula on the back wall, each wearing yellow girt tunic with red pallium and carrying rhyton and situla; the serpents, one on each side wall, coiling towards an altar upon which lie two eggs and a pine cone.

Inst.) as carrying acerra and shallow dish; above and behind the altar appears the figure of the tibicen. On each side of this group stands a Lar in yellow tunic and green pallium and carrying rhyton and situla. Beyond the Lar who stands on the 1., is painted a very small popa, pushing a hog toward the r. The corresponding figure on the r. of the r.

W. corner of the open area of the peristyle stands a fine aedicula (h. 2.20, w. 1.05, d. 0.80). It is built against the N. wall and with its own N. W. corner impinges on the corner column of the peristyle. It consists of a superstructure erected upon a low base and forming a vaulted niche (h. 1.10, w. 0.60, d. 0.80) open to the S. The narrow strip of wall on each side of the opening of the niche is marked off as a long vertical panel by modeled stucco moldings which surround it on all four sides. These panels extend up as far as the base of the vault, where a wide horizontal cornice seems to rest upon them, one on each side. These horizontal cornices, in turn, support, at their inner edges, the elaborate cornice which runs around the curve of the vault, at their outer edges, the lower ends of two narrow pilasters applied to the walls, one at each corner of the faqade. These pilasters, like the panels below, are surrounded on all sides by narrow moldings. They support above their capitals a simple pediment. The somewhat degenerate aedicula fa9ade thus formed is finished off at the bottom by a stucco cornice with a tooth pattern which extends across the top of the base on the level of the floor of the niche. Other modeled stucco cornices adorn the structure at the following points: 1) the tops of the inner walls of the niche at the level of the base of the vault, 2) the curve where the back wall meets the vaulted ceiling, 3) the architrave and the raking cornices of the pediment. The color scheme is simple: the base and the inside walls of the niche are yellow; the vertical panels on each side of the niche, the narrow pilasters above them and the lunette of the back wall are red bordered with moldings in white; the tympanum and the spandrels of the arch are blue; all the moldings are white. The E. side of the structure, facing the open area of the viridarium, is decorated with precisely the same pattern and color scheme, except that the opening of the niche is here false. This pseudo-opening is painted red and within it are represented a portal in blue and, in front of it, three steps in white. 2 According to Pernice,t the altar dates from the Tufa Period and may have stood against this wall from that or the Sullan period.</page><page sequence="45">POMPErAN LARARIA 49 The W. side of the structure, which is partially covered by the corner column of the colonnade, is painted a uniform red without decoration. It is not certain that this aedicula was the shrine of the domestic deities, though it has been generally accepted as such. In some respects it resembles aediculae in other houses which are known to have been domestic sacella (e. g. those at VI, ix, 6/7; VIII, v/vi, 37; IX, i, 20; III, Domus Obelli Firmi), but in others it is more like those of a primarily decorative character (especially that at I, ii, 17, in which the marble statuette of Venus was found). Two characteristics indicate a closer connection with the decorative than with the religious structures: The decoration is delicate and restrained, suggesting that the designer was mainly concerned with the adornment of the peristyle; the form with low base and high niche indicates that it was designed to contain a single large statuette, rather than several small ones of the sort which we know were regularly housed in the ordinary lararium. Now most of the accounts of the discovery of this house state that a statuette of a faun was found within this niche, but unfortunately the reports do not all agree; Pomp. Ant. Hist. states that the statuette was found near the tablinum.1 It is im- possible therefore to be sure whether this is the figure which the aedicula contained, though it seems likely that it did contain some such single statuette, of ornamental character, rather than the images of the gods of the household. Pomp. Ant. Hist., ii, 126 (Feb. 12, 1825); Bull. Arch. Nap., N.

Ant. Hist. describes briefly the discovery of "#un grazioso sacello, dove esser devea qualche statua di divinita tutelare, che gli antichi adoravano nella propria lor casa o Lare". This is the only reference to the aedicula in the reports of the excavations. But in later accounts it is always stated that in the aedicula stood the statuette of a faun. Thus Minervini in the Bull. Arch. Nap.: "Nell' angolo sinistro del peristilio, e ricoprendo in parte la mezza colonna che n'e il limite, vedesi una bellissima edicola, con graziosi ornamenti di stucco elegan- temente dipinti a varii colori, trai quali primeggiano il roso ed il turchino. Nella nicchia di questa edicola fu rinvenuta la statua di un satiretto, con fiori e frutta nel grembo." This account is followed by Breton, Bonucci, Niccolini, Overbeck- Mau and Mau; Gell, however, says: "Against the wall stood a little shrine, in or near which was found a small statue." The discovery of the statuette is described in Pomp. Ant. Hist., ii, 125 as follows: "Alla sinistra poi di esso tablino, si 9 rinvenuta una statuetta di marmo alta pal. 31/2 (about m. 0.93), colla testa staccata, e rotta in tre pezzi... Questa figura e di buona scultura, e rappresenta un Fauno con pelle di capra pendente dalle spalle, la di cui estremita, che giunge sino alla metd delle cosce, vien sollevata e sostenuta dalla sua mano destra, portandovi dentro dell' uva, ed altri frutti." 169.

Above a rectangular masonry podium (1.08 by 0.53, h. 0.82) two sturdy Doric columns (h. with bases and capi- tals 0.75) and two pilasters applied to the back wall support an architrave and a pediment. The vaulted ceiling of the niche cuts into the architrave. The tympanum is blue surrounded by a modeled stucco cornice; the architrave is red, as is also the back wall within the shrine; the vaulted ceiling is yellow; the base, yellow bordered with red stripes. Embedded in the center of the floor of the aedicula is a square block of marble with two holes cut in it, and in the holes there are marks of metal - probably the supports of a single large statuette. On the front side of the base was painted a panther, raising its head towards a garland of grapes which continued on to the two adjacent sides of the base. Before the aedicula stood an altar consisting of two rectangular stones, one placed horizontally on the top of the other, which stands vertically (0.24 by 0.26, h. 0.47). The painting of the panther indicates that the shrine housed a statuette of Bacchus. No traces of such a figure were found, but there were brought to light fragments of a marble statuette, the head of which is painted and is said to bear a resemblance to that of the statue of Isis from the temple of that goddess.

C- On the W. wall of the pistrinum, above the hearth, is a lararium painting (h. about 1.65, w. about 2.0) in three zones, done on a white ground. In the upper zone are the two Lares, Vesta and Venus Pompeiana. Vesta has upon her head a wreath from which a white veil hangs down her back; she wears a white tunic, and holds in 1. a sceptre, with the r. a patera above an altar, behind which appears the figure of an ass adorned with a bell hung around its neck. On each side of her stands a Lar, clad in yellow tunic with green border, who rests the elbow of his outer arm upon a square yellow pillar and holds in the same hand a patera, in the other the usual rhyton. To the 1. of this group of three stands Venus Pompeiana, wearing red chiton and mantle and having on her head a mural crown, around her neck a necklace; in the r. hand she holds an olive (?) branch, in the 1. a sceptre and rests the 1. arm upon a rudder. To her 1., between her and the Lar, is Amor, wearing an orange chlamys and a bulla around his neck; he stands upon a base and with both hands holds up a blue mirror. Across the top of the panel is stretched a quadruple garland. In the middle zone a single serpent moves towards an altar painted at the 1. edge of the picture. In the lowest zone lies the figure of the river Sarnus with white beard, wearing a wreath of reeds and having a blue garment wrapped about his legs. In 1. he holds a reed and supports his 1. elbow upon an overturned jar, from which a stream of water flows; the r. arm he lays across the top of his head. All about him reeds are represented growing.

Around the pediment runs a delicate frieze with tooth-pattern in stucco. The floor of each niche projects slightly from the surface of the wall and the edge of this shelf is painted in imitation of red and yellow variegated marble. In one of these niches was found a statuette "of a priest", probably the Genius.

The two walls of the room in the corner above this base are dec- orated with the lararium painting on a yellow ground: on each wall a Lar (h. 0.48) of the usual type, carrying rhyton and situla. This yellow layer of stucco has partially peeled off, revealing beneath it an earlier layer of red, apparently without any figured painting upon it. Upon this podium must have originally rested an aedicula, its roof supported by a single column at the one free corner of the base, after the manner of the aediculae in the houses at I, x, 4 and IX, i, 22.

The niche is set into the wall above a dado painted with the conventional garden ornamentation of lattice-work. We can only speculate on the purpose served by this niche and its relation to the aedicula described above. Presumably the aedicula is the lararium, in spite of the purely decorative ornament in the tympanum. In this case, the niche probably contained a figure of primarily decorative character. Giorn.

In the center of the W. wall of the smaller atrium is one of the largest, and at the same time one of the finest lararia in Pompeii, con- sisting of a lararium painting within an aedicula. The aedicula (h. 3.70) is exceptionally shallow; it stands upon a solid base (h. 1.50, projecting from the surface of the wall only 0.11) and consists of a rectangular niche (h. 1.30, w. 1.50, d. 0.22) flanked by two Corinthian half-columiis (h. with bases and capitals 1.37) which bear the architrave and pediment. The tympanum is surrounded on all three sides by triple bands of elaborate stucco ornament in red, blue and yellow. The tympanum itself is blue and has in the center three objects in white stucco relief: in the center a patera umbilicata, to the r. a culter, to the 1. a bucranium. Around the top of the base runs a polychrome stucco cornice. The base itself is yellow, as are also the adjacent portions of the walls for a space 0.65 wide on each side of the aedicula, up to the height of the peak of the gable. The yellow panel thus formed is outlined with broad red stripes and the aedicula itself is outlined in the same manner on the ground of the yellow panel. The columns are coated with white stucco. The back wall within the aedicula is filled by the lararium painting on a white ground: In the center stands the Genius,' young and unbearded, wearing the praetexta with a fold showing the purple border drawn over his head; in r. he holds a patera, in 1. an acerra, but there is no altar. On each side of him stands a wreathed Lar, wearing white tunic with purple sash over the 1. shoulder and around the waist and on his feet boots which appear to leave the toes uncovered, and holding rhyton and situla. The lower end of each rhyton has the form of the fore part of a goat. In the lower zone of the same panel a crested and bearded serpent with brown back and yellow belly glides through plants towards a square altar painted at the r. edge of the panel; upon the altar are an egg and some fruits. Across the top of the painting are stretched three garlands with pendent taeniae. RNm.

In the E. wall of the atrium, to the r. of the entrance is a small recess (w. 1.45, d. 1.0), done in the period of the First Style and evidently con- verted into a domestic sacellum at some later time.

Later (it may have been in the time of the Second, or as late as the Fourth Style), in the back wall of this niche were cut three small irregular niches, all arched, but not all of the same size, that on the r. (h. 0.37, w. 0.29, d. 0.09) being somewhat larger, though shallower than the other two (h. 0.32, w. 0.25, d. 0.12). On the floor before them were set two masonry altars (0.28 by 0.30, h. 0.68). The interior walls of the niches were coated with red, the altars with yellow stucco in imitation of marble. Mau suggests that the number of the niches and altars is to be explained as two niches with a common altar serving the Lares, the other the Genius,' or two niches serving the Genius and Lares together, the third the Penates. There is still another niche (h. 0.40, w. 0.52, d. varies) of irregular shape in the wall above the First Style cornice of the original niche. Not. Scavi, 1897, 22; Rim. Mitt., xiii, 1898, 13. 213.

The aedicula is formed by four columns (h. with bases and capitals 0.88) in front and two antae applied to the back wall which support a roof with pediment. The columns are coated with stucco and painted, the two outer yellow, the two inner red; each has a square base and a simple capital adorned with stucco reliefs upon a ground of violet. The central intercolumniation is wider than the two at the sides, and above it the arch of the vaulted ceiling of the interior of the shrine extends into the tympanum; above each of the side intercolumniations stretches a horizontal architrave painted yellow. The tympanum is blue and is bordered on all three sides and around the curve of the arch by a narrow band of a white wavy design in stucco relief. Along the lower edges of the horizontal architraves and of the vault runs a band of egg design in bright colors. The raking cornices are poorly preserved. The back wall within the shrine is white, as if for a painting of which no 1 Cf. the painted figures of the Genius and Lares in two niches of the sacellum No. 253. traces remain. The base is adorned with a red dado and in the center of it is cut a large arched recess (h. 0.55, w. 0.39, d. 0.47) painted red within; perhaps this niche served for storage of the equipment used in the cult.

In the room behind the shop, which has a door connecting with the atrium of house No. 12, on the E. wall is a very crude lararium painting (1.65 square). In the upper zone stand the Lares in the usual attire and position, each wreathed and holding rhyton and patera; between them is the Genius, portrayed with idealized features (according to Mau), wearing the toga praetexta and holding in 1. a cornucopia, in the r. a patera from which he pours a libation upon an altar. In the lower zone are two serpents confronted at an altar furnished with two eggs; in the background are plants. Below the serpents there are rudely sketched the following objects (from 1. to r.): a ham, a hog's head, sausages, rib-roast (Mau) or gridiron (Sogliano), an unidentified object. Above the panel and hanging down on each side are painted garlands. Not. Scavi, 1897, 199; Rom. Mitt., xiii, 1898, 46. 218. VI, xv, 18 An irregular building which was undergoing alterations at the time of the catastrophe; its purpose is not clear; perhaps the large central room was used for housing carts; the walls seem to have been all undecorated except for those in a long, narrow room in the S. W. corner of the building, into the S. end of which is built a domestic sacellum. This sacellum has a vaulted ceiling and a floor of pounded sherds, and dates, according to Mau, from the period of the First Style. Against the S. wall stands a masonry altar (0.35 by 0.60, h. 0.95) with concave upper surface. In is coated with white stucco and upon its front side is painted a small flaming altar with a large serpent on each side; above the altar and</page><page sequence="52">56 GEORGE K. BOYCE hanging down on both sides is a festoon. According to Sogliano (Not. Scavi), the figure of the Genius was painted on the E. face of the altar, though Mau makes no mention of it in his description. The relation of the altar to the First Style dado could not be determined. On the r. of the altar, in the S. W. corner of the room stands a structure described by Sogliano as a low masonry altar on the top of which ashes were found; Mau refers to the same structure as ein viereckiges Tuffgefdf3. The wall on the 1. of the central altar is adorned with a painted palm. Near it, but in the E. wall, is a small niche (h. 0.55, w. 0.45, d. 0.30, h. above the floor only 0.0), on the white ground of the back wall of which is crudely painted a figure' clad in a blue garment and reclining upon a kline, holding against the 1. shoulder an indistinct object - probably a cornucopia. Nearby stand a table and a candelabrum with a lighted lamp. The back and side walls of the niche are adorned with painted red leaves and three quinces. On the wall to the 1. of, and close beside the niche is painted a torch. Against each of the side walls of the room, farther to the N., is built a masonry structure (1.10 by 0.35, h. 0.60), which has, according to Mau, a raised rim like an altar; Sogliano refers to it simply as un sedile di fabbrica. These structures are definitely older than the First Style dado. In the room to the N., through which access to this sacellum is gained, on the E. wall is a rectangular panel (1.30 by 1.45) of white stucco and within it is set a tiny niche for a lamp. Above the panel of white stucco is a second niche (h. 0.35, w. 0.50), coated with coarse plaster and having on the back wall a painting done in red. This painting is very poorly preserved but seems to represent an aedicula and within it an altar. Not. Scavi, 1897, 463, photograph p. 464; PRdm. Mitt., xvi, 1901, 287. 219. (PI. 15, 1 and 2.) VI, xv, 23 House. The three rooms in the S. W+ portion, to the r. of the entrance, have bare walls without any decoration except for the lararium in the kitchen- the corner room. In it the hearth is built against the center of the W. wall and between it and the N. wall with the entrance door is the lararium. At the height of 1.30 above the floor a heavy ledge held by consoles (w. 1.12, h. 0.25, projecting from the wall 0.18) supports a temple fasade (h. 0.90) con- structed before a semi-circular niche with flat ceiling (h. 0.50, w. 0.70, d. 0.17). The fasade consists of two Doric columns (h. 0.42) with bases and capitals, an architrave and a pediment. The ledge and the 1 This is the enigmatic figure which is met in several other shrines; cf. the index s. v. PAINTINGS, Enigma, M au identifies it here as "withQut doubt the Genius", aedicula are constructed of a mixture of brick and tufa. The whole is painted red except for a star on a white ground in the center of the tympanum. The curved back wall of the niche is blue and upon it is the lararium painting. On each side is a Lar, wreathed, wearing greenish tunic and carrying rhyton and situla. Between them stands the Genius in white toga with the two red stripes and a fold drawn over his head, in 1. he holds a cornucopia and with the r. pours a libation from a golden patera upon a yellow cylindrical altar; he has the features of a young man with rather full face and bears a certain resemblance to the Genius of the lararium of the Casa dei Vettii, and Mau suggests that it is possible to see the emperor Nero in both. On the wall on each side of the aedicula are painted a garland and a flying bird. On the wall beneath the aedicula and extending over on to the wall of the entrance door, on the one side, and on to the adjacent side of the hearth on the other, are painted two large yellow serpents (that on the r. has a larger body, a crest and a beard, that on the 1. is smaller and has neither appendage) confronted, one on each side of a cylindrical altar painted in imitation of yellow marble beneath the aedicula. The altar is furnished with two eggs and fruit. Against the wall below the aedicula and that of the entrance door runs a masonry seat (h. 0.30). It is decorated upon a ground of red with painted luxuriant foliage which covers the front surface of the bench and extends above it to form a background for the serpents. Not.

E. corner of the peristyle is a shrine dedicated to the cult of Egyptian deities. On each wall a large yellow panel is marked off by a broad red border (h. 1.80, w. on the E. wall 1.81, on the S. wall 2.01). The red border is decorated with linear designs in white, and on the yellow ground within it runs a narrow green band like a garland pulled taut. Within the panels are represented Egyptian deities and the symbols of their cult, distributed in two zones. The panel on the S. wall contains in the upper zone (from 1. to r.)- 1) Anubis with the head of a jackal, standing full front, wearing a reddish chlamys over 1. shoulder and breast and on his feet boots with red laces; in 1. a caduceus, in r. (missing) a palm branch, most of which is preserved. 2) A boy, of whose figure there are preserved only the head and the 1. shoulder, against which rests a cornucopia -apparently Harpocrates,</page><page sequence="53">POMPEIAN LARARIA 57 3) Isis, standing full front, wearing a long white garment with sleeves, across which a broad black band stretches from 1. shoulder to r. hip, from which, in turn, a second black band falls downward; her brown hair falls over neck and shoulders; upon her forehead she wears the lotus flower; in her r. the sistrum, the 1. held by her side is barely discernible. 4) Serapis, standing full front; only the upper part of his figure is preserved but he appears to wear a girded tunic with an ample white mantle thrown over it and hanging down in numerous folds; he is bearded and has the lotus flower upon his forehead; in r. the sistrum, in 1. the cornucopia. In the lower zone of the same panel (from 1. to r.). 5) A poorly preserved anthropomorphic Egyptian idol with broad shoulders and narrow waist and standing in r. profile. The color of the whole is a uniform blue, but whether it is intended to be represented nude or clothed is uncertain. The head is covered with a green klaft, which was surmounted by an object now indistinguishable. The r. arm is bent at the elbow and in that hand he seems to hold a white rod, to the lower end of which are attached a disk and, above it, a small brown globe; in the 1. an unidentified small white object. 6) A figure standing in r. profile, poorly preserved and lacking the head. The dark color of the hands and feet indicates that it is male; he is clad in a bright colored garment which reaches from the shoulders to the middle of the legs; in each hand, raised in front of the body, he holds vertically a long object. 7) An unidentified object. 8) The end of a green wooden table upon which stands a metal krater. The panel on the E. wall (photograph in the Not. Scavi) contains in the upper zone (from 1. to r.): a sistrum, a patera umbilicata, an ampulla, all sus- pended from the horizontal green garland mentioned above as bordering the panel; below them, but still in the same zone, stand the symbols of Isis: a) A large cylindrical cista with conical cover, apparently woven of reeds like wicker-work and adorned on the front with two slender wands crossed in the form of an X, and a crescent moon. b) A similar cista, smaller, having the crossed wands but not the crescent moon; on each side of it is an indistinct reddish object. c) A coiled serpent rearing its head towards the 1- Uraeus. In the lower zone of this panel were originally repre- sented several birds, now vanished. In the r. side of the lower part of this panel are visible the marks where two small shelves -perhaps of wood -were affixed to the wall, one above the other. The dado (h. 1.00), below the two panels described above, bears the figures of the serpents painted on a white ground. They are represented, one on each wall, confronted at the altar painted in the corner between them. The serpents are yellow ; that on the 1. has crest and beard, that on r. has neither. The altar is cylindrical, stands upon a red plinth and is furnished with offerings painted on the top. Above the top there is in the wall a hollow of oval shape, perhaps intended to contain a real pine cone which would thus appear to be placed on the painted altar. The background of this painting is adorned with green plants. A rectangular section (2.00 by 1.81) in the floor before this painting lacks the pavement of pounded sherds which covers the floor of the rest of the portico. Apparently this space was closed off by a wooden partition supporting some sort of aedicula, for which the two panels with Egyptian gods and the serpents below served as cult pictures. Of this structure no trace remains except for the marks where it joined the walls at the outer extremities of the two upper panels. Within the area of this sacellum were found numerous objects, among them: 1) An Egyptian statuette of alabaster (h. 0.42) - apparently representing Horus. 2) A statuette of white marble (h. 0.11) representing a female figure seated upon a throne and holding a cornucopia - apparently Isis. 3) A large terra-cotta lamp decorated with a relief representing three Egyptian deities: Isis in the center, Harpocrates to the 1., a third god with animal head to the r. 4) An as of Nero with the temple of Janus on the reverse.

B- Beneath the N. portico of the peristyle, against the wall between the doors to two side rooms, stands the aedicula of the household gods. It is built upon a masonry podium with cornice in relief (1.08 by 0.35, h. 1.10), and consists of two fluted columns (h. 0.68) of real marble but having capitals of stucco, and above them an architrave and a pediment (h. of aedicula 0.95, w. 0.95). The rectangular niche cut in the wall behind the aedicula is bordered at the sides by antae of white stucco and has its floor divided into three levels by two high steps. The cornices which surround the tympanum are decorated with bands of egg and dart design in stucco relief; the tympanum is blue; the steps in the floor of the niche are decorated along the front with stucco relief designs -horizontal garlands of stylized leaves and a pelta design; the podium of the aedicula is</page><page sequence="54">58 GEORGE K. BOYCE painted to represent red and yellow variegated marble with borders, and with inset dark disk in front. This shrine was found with its contents intact and contained the following bronze statuettes, arranged as shown in the photograph fig. 14 in Not. Scavi: 1) Jupiter (h. 0.1651), bearded, the upper part of his body nude, the lower part wrapped in a robe; in r. the thunderbolt, in the 1. he probably originally held a sceptre, now missing. 2) Juno (h. 0.16), wearing a peplum fastened on her r. shoulder and over it a mantle, on her head a high crown; her hair is done up in a knot at her neck. 3) Minerva (h. 0.17), wearing peplum and mantle and on her breast the gorgoneion, on her head a helmet. Each of the three figures described above is seated upon a throne with high back, arm-rests and deco- rated legs; each statuette, though having a bronze base of its own, is placed upon a high cubical pedestal, the face of which is a slab of colored marble (photo- graph of all three together, Not. Scavi, fig. 15). 4) Mercury (h. 0.31), seated upon a rock, nude except for a chlamys, winged boots and petasos; in extended r. he holds a large patera umbilicata and in 1. probably originally had the caduceus, now lost; the eyes are inlaid with glass. The statuette is of mediocre workmanship (photograph, Not. Scavi, fig. 16). 5-6) The two Lares (h. wrongly given as "0.074"2), of the usual type with youthful features and curly hair, wearing elaborate girded tunics with loose folds which fly out from their bodies as they dance on the tips of their toes; in upraised hand each holds a large rhyton, the lower end of which has the form of the fore-part of a panther, in the other hand the situla; each Lar stands on a bronze base adorned with an ovolo (photograph, Not. Scavi, fig. 17). As the photograph Not. Scavi (fig. 14), shows, the statuettes of the Capitoline Triad stood on the top step, towards the r. side, Jupiter in the center, on his r. Juno, on his 1. Minerva. On the same step, to the 1. of Juno, stood the figure of Mercury. The Lares were placed, one on each side of this group but on the lower step. Between them and in front of the Capitoline Triad, lay a bronze oenochoe (h. 0.20) on its side. Not. Scavi, 1907, 565-571 and figg. 14-17; DELLA CORTE, "Le piiu remote esplorazioni di Pompei", Historia, viii, 1934, p. 305, fig. 5. 1 This measurement is given as 0.65, which is certainly an error, for the photograph shows the three statuettes of the Capitoline Triad to be of about the same height. This must be a misprint for 0.165. 2 Obviously an error, for the statuettes of the Lares are the largest of the six. 222. VI, xvi, 11 Taberna.

In the small room entered directly from the corridor which leads back from the shop, on the N. wall is a panel (h. 2.30, w. 2.45) of white stucco bordered in red. The lower half of it is filled with painted green plants which have some red leaves and through the foliage coil two huge serpents, each with red crest and beard (those of the serpent on the r. are larger), confronted, one on each side of a small stone altar (h. and w. 0.25) which is embedded in the wall (and projects 0.17 from it) at the height of 1.20 above the floor. The altar is painted to represent colored marble and above it on the wall are painted the usual offerings. pine cone, egg and fruit. This is an interesting combination of painted serpents and painted offerings on a stone altar. Not. Scavi, 1908, 61. 224. (P1. 16, 1.) VI, xvi, 15 House. In the atrium the space of the N. wall between the doors leading to two side rooms is coated with white stucco to the height of the top of the doors and bordered with red stripes, thus forming a large panel (h. 2.65, w. 2.35) for the lararium painting. Into the wall in the upper r. hand corner of this panel is set a square niche (0.54 square, d. 0.27, h. above the floor 2.0), on the back wall of which is painted the figure of the Genius. He wears the praetexta and holds with his r. a patera above a cylindrical altar furnished with offerings and entwined with garlands. On each side of him a green garland hangs down, as if from another garland suspended across the top of the back wall of the niche (now destroyed). On the side walls are painted red, rose- like flowers having green leaves. Of the two Lares originally painted on the white ground of the wall, one on each side of the niche, only the lower part of the one on the 1. remains; he carries the situla in lowered hand. Farther to the 1. is a garland, Below the figure of the Lar is painted a tall cylindrical altar, placed upon a very high base and furnished with two eggs, a pine cone and fruit. On each side is a huge yellow serpent (that on the 1. has red crest and beard, that on the r. has neither) approaching in enormous coils, reaching from the floor to the level of the niche (length of each coiled serpent</page><page sequence="55">POMPEIAN LARARIA 59 about 2.00). In the background are rather large plants bearing fruit. Over the surface of this picture had been spread a thin wash, whence it appears that the lararium belonged to an older decoration of the house and was to be replaced by a new one to be painted on the thin wash. Not. Scavi, 1908, 67. 225. VI, xvi, 20-24 House. In the central room on the S. side of the house, in the N. side of a pilaster which projects from the E. wall, is a rectangular niche (h. 0.42, w. 0.37, d. 0.27, h. above the floor 1.40). On the wall below the niche, on a red ground are painted two large yellow serpents. Not. Scavi, 1908, 182. 226. VI, xvi, 26/27 House. The doorway which led from the atrium to the peristyle, on the W. side of the tablinum, was walled up, leaving a shallow recess in the S. wall of the atrium. Within this recess, in the upper 1. corner, a white panel (h. 0.58, w. 0.50) was marked off by green stripes on each side and on it was painted the figure of Jupiter (h. 0.42). He is seated upon a throne with high back, over which is thrown a green robe; the upper part of his body is nude, the lower part wrapped in a red mantle; he rests his 1. elbow upon the back of the throne and leans his forehead against the 1. hand; through the bend of this arm passes a long sceptre, the lower end of which rests upon the ground; in his r. he holds the thunderbolt; his feet are placed upon a footstool, to the 1. of which stands an eagle. In the wall below this panel are embedded two broken tiles, one hori- zontal (0.42 below the panel), the second perpen- dicular to the first at its W. end. The wall space between the painting of Jupiter and the two tiles is decorated with plants painted on a yellow ground. The horizontal tile alone might have served as a shelf for offerings, but the purpose of the two tiles in this peculiar arrangement is not clear. Near the shrine was found a terra-cotta votive altar (h. 0.03). Not. Scavi, 1908, 184. 227. VI, xvi, 29/30 House.

The inside walls of the niche are coated with white stucco and upon each are painted a large bird holding something in its beak, and, above it, a garland.

A- In the E. wall of the atrium, near the door to a side room, there was originally a large niche (h. 0.93, w. 0.67, d. 0.28, h. above the floor 0.55) decorated with a painted pattern of small colored blocks in the manner of the First or Second Style - apparently the lararium. When the atrium was re-decorated in the Fourth Style, the surface of the niche was covered over without filling up the niche itself, and an aperture large enough for the insertion of the hand was left. The niche thus became a place for the storage of small articles - Fiorelli suggests, for wax tablets or rolls. FIORELLI, Scavi, 14; FIORELLI, Descr., 173, OVERBECK-MAU, 283. 245.

Later a lararium painting was superimposed upon a part of this decoration. In the W. wall, near the N. W. corner is set a rectangular niche (h. 0.37, w. 0.32, d. 0.21, h. above the floor 1.50). Below it and to the r., a low masonry altar (0.32 by 0.35, h. 0.45) is built into the corner of the room and covered with yellowish stucco painted in imitation of colored marble. On the N. wall is the lararium painting in two zones: In the lower zone a single large serpent - yellow and black with red crest and beard - coils towards the top of the masonry altar; in the field are plants and flowers. In the upper zone (h. 0.52, w. 1.52) is the scene described by Helbig: In the center stand the two Lares, one on each side of a blazing cylindrical altar; each one is wreathed, wears tunic and pallium and holds rhyton and situla.

BOYCE In the N. wall, at the E. extremity of this panel, within a recess, is a window looking into the kitchen. On the W. wall of this recess, around the corner from the panel described above, is painted a man, nude except for a limus about his hips, holding in each hand an object which was no longer distinguish- able at the time of excavation.

In the W. wall of the peristyle there are two large niches, one originally fitted with a wooden door, the other with shelves, probably both cupboards; on the ground before them1 were found the following bronze statuettes: 1) Fortuna, wearing a turreted crown and holding a cornucopia in 1., a rudder in r.

A series of eleven steps leads down from the E. side of the peristyle to a sub- terranean corridor, off which open two rooms. The corridor itself has a vaulted ceiling and in its W. wall open two arched doors, giving access to a large room in which are a deep well and a rectangular masonry vat for washing clothes. In the N. wall of the corridor another arched door (not cut in the center of the wall, but on the 1. side, leaving a kind of pilaster 0.31 wide on the E. side) leads to the domestic sacrarium. This is a tiny room (1.12 by 1.24, h. 2.60) with vaulted ceiling. The walls and ceiling are coated with white stucco and profusely, though crudely, decorated with painted ornaments. In the N. wall are cut two arched niches (that on the 1.: h. 1.02, w. 0.50, d. 0.40, h. above the floor 0.55; that on the r.: h. 0.89, w. 0.53, d. 0.40, h. above the floor 0.65), on the back walls of which are painted the figures of the domestic gods: within the niche on the 1, the Genius, togate and wreathed with laurel, holding a cornucopia against the 1. shoulder and with the r. pouring a libation over the flaming altar painted to his r.; within the other niche, the two Lares standing one on each side of a flaming altar, each wearing yellow tunic and pallium and holding rhyton and situla. In the space above their heads is painted a flying eagle. Above the figures in both niches are painted garlands, which hang down on the sides, and below them are flowers. The side walls of the niche with the Genius are painted in imitation of a veneer of colored marble, those of the niche with the Lares more simply with flowers and plants. On the W. wall of the room are painted two huge yellow serpents (that on the 1. is larger and alone has crest and beard), confronted at a tiny altar made to represent colored marble; in the field are plants. On the floor in front of the niches stands a cylindrical masonry altar (diam. 0.30, h. 0.57) upon which actual remains of the last offerings were seen by the excavators. The altar is not symmetrically placed before the two niches, but stands too far to the W. Each of the niches was provided with two lamps and that of the Genius with a terra-cotta altar in</page><page sequence="59">POMPEIAN LARARIA 63 addition. Five other lamps were suspended from nails driven in the walls of the room. The lavish decoration of the walls of the room is as follows: On the N. wall above each niche is a heavy garland with fillets, in the curved upper section of the wall a peacock, and beneath the niches plants; the E. wall and the vaulted ceiling are marked off into panels and strewn with flowers and other ornaments, among them the head of Medusa; on the exterior of the S. wall, within the corridor, on the r. side of the door are garlands and a bird perched upon one of them, on the 1. of the door a candelabrum.

Against the back (S.) wall of the viridarium stands an aedicula: Above a rectangular podium (1.05 by 0.50, h. 0.95) stand two columns (h. 1.0) coated with red stucco which support a roof with pediment. In the back wall within this aedicula is cut a semi-circular niche, its vaulted ceiling adorned with a stucco shell, its walls painted orange, and on the wall on each side of the niche is a stucco pilaster. Within the aedicula was found a large marble statuette of Venus Anadyomene (h. 0.72). The aedicula is prominently placed in the center of the back wall of the garden and in the wall on each side of it is a long vertical cut, which Fiorelli suggests may have held candelabra. Bull.

The niche today shows a coating with white stucco bordered with red stripes, and upon it are painted realistic red roses. On the wall above the niche was the ordinary lararium painting of the Genius in white toga with cornucopia and patera and on each side of him a Lar. The background was richly decorated throughout: in the upper panel beside the Lares were plants and birds, on the interior of the niche were red roses, around the serpents plants and flowers.

On the opposite side of the altar stands the tibicen in white tunic and red toga (sic) with his r. foot upon a scabellum; behind him a very small, nude popa carries in his r. the sacrificial knife, in his 1. a malleus. On each side of this group is a Lar with rhyton and situla, leaning with one arm upon a pillar. In the lower zone (h. 0.90) are two serpents con- fronted at an altar furnished with eggs and fruit.

VII, iii, 13 Casa del Doppio Larario. A- In the N. wall of the viridarium, to the 1. of the entrance door, a deep, square niche (0.84 square, d. 0.82, h. above the floor 1.15) is set in the wall. Its floor projects slightly in the form of a ledge and beneath it runs a delicate cornice of modeled and painted stucco. On the wall below the niche a rec- tangular panel is marked off by a molding which runs around all four sides. The side walls of the niche are adorned at their outer edges, each with a stucco pilaster fitted with curious capitals, one higher than the other. In the center of the back wall is a small aedicula fagade formed by two columns (h. 0.25) which rest upon a heavy pro- jecting ledge adorned with a cornice of stucco and support a pediment. The back wall within the aedicula is painted in imitation of marble. In this miniature shrine must have stood a statuette. On the r. side wall of the niche is a large wreath (diam. 0.70) of laurel and within it coils a serpent, all done in stucco relief. Around the top of the three inside walls of the niche runs another stucco cornice. In the floor is a rectangular depression for offerings. This shrine was called the "Double Lararium", because above the niche we have described there is another, similar to it in shape and size. But in this upper niche no traces of a cult were found and, in the absence of any real parallels to such a double shrine, it is simpler to regard the upper niche as a place of storage, comparable, perhaps, to the niches in the bases of the aediculae of the houses of Obellius Firmus and the Principe di Napoli (Nos. 67, 214).

On the N. wall of the kitchen is a lararium painting in three zones (h. 1.90, w. of upper zone 1.50, of the two lower zones 2.0): In the upper zone beneath garlands stretched across the top and hanging down at the sides of the panel, stand Jupiter and Venus Pompeiana. Jupiter is on the 1., entirely nude; with his 1. he leans upon a sceptre and he extends the r. above an altar furnished with offerings of fruit. On the r. is Venus, wreathed and wearing violet chiton and blue mantle; in the 1. she holds a sceptre, and she rests the elbow of that arm upon an inverted rudder, in the r. she holds an olive (?) branch; on a cylin- drical base at her 1. side stands Amor, clad in a brown chlamys and holding a mirror. The middle zone contains a sacrificial scene: On the 1. of a brick structure (according to Mau, an oven for roasting the flesh of the victims), which stands at the r. edge of the panel, is the Genius, holding in his 1. a cornucopia, with the r. pouring a libation from a patera upon an altar. He seems to be rep- resented with portrait features. On the opposite side of the altar stands the tibicen, of the same stature as the Genius, wearing a long white garment; behind him is a small camillus in white girded tunic and shoes, carrying in his 1. a shallow dish, in his r. a pitcher. Still farther 1. a man with traces of a beard on his cheeks advances to the r., wearing a yellow girded tunic and carrying a hog over his shoulder; at his side hangs a knife. Behind him follow two young men, each of whom carries over his shoulder a pole, the upper end of which is fitted with a peculiar tuft -not a thyrsus, according to Helbig. In the lowest zone a single crested serpent coils towards an altar furnished with two eggs, which stands at the r. edge of the panel; the background is filled with plants.

Instead of the customary serpents, the lower zone here was filled with a second sacrificial scene, of which only the popa remains. He is girt with red and yellow limus, holds a knife in the r. and with his 1. grasps a hog by the ear. The hog is adorned with a red band around its belly and a garland.

On the opposite side of the altar stands Hercules, bearded, a large crown of vine leaves upon his head, over his 1. arm the lion skin; in r. he holds the club, in 1. the skyphos. Behind Hercules is a hog with a bell hung around its neck and a girdle around its belly. On the 1. of this group stands a Lar, of smaller stature than the other figures, clad in yellow tunic and blue pallium and holding rhyton and situla; the corresponding Lar on the r. has vanished. Below these figures were painted numerous objects, now faded; among which there can be distinguished several flasks and amphorae grouped about a vannus mystica (?). To the r. of these objects two young men wrestle for the possession of an amphora, each holding one of its handles with one hand and the hair of his opponent with the other.

VII, iv, 56 House. In the N. wall of the atrium, to the 1. of the entrance from the street, is the lararium: Above the red dado (h. 1.32) runs a cornice of painted stucco and above it was the lararium painting, done on a white background and poorly preserved at the time of excavation. In it was represented a human figure sacrificing at an altar. Above the painting runs a second stucco cornice surmounted by a projecting ledge, upon which rest the bases of three fluted columns framing two niches. One of the niches was rectangular with its walls painted rose color, the other had a vaulted ceiling and was white within. A fragment of a half-column found nearby led Avellino to suppose that the whole shrine was enclosed by a kind of aedicula. AVELLINO, Mem. Accad. Ercolanese, iii, 1843, 365; BRETON, 374. 282.

Behind the Lar and somewhat higher, stands Vulcan in whitish exomis. His figure Helbig found indistinguishable in detail, but Avellino describes him as wearing chlamys and pilos in addition to the exomis and holding in his r. tongs, while his 1. he rests upon a shield.'

A- In a small room opening off the S. side of the peristyle was a sacrarium, only the solid podium (1.80 by 1.50, h. about 0.70) of which now remains. It is rectangular with two steps cut in the front side. On each of the corners is a mark left by one of the four columns which supported the roof. This roof was probably decorated with a pediment on each of the four faces, for remains of two of quite different types and sizes have been found, whence it would appear that they were placed, not on opposite, but on adjoining sides of the structure.1 In the center of the top of the podium, near the rear, is the mark left by the pedestal which supported a statuette, presumably the cult image. Other figures may have stood all around the podium. The podium itself is coated on the sides with grey stucco and paved on the top with pounded sherds. In front of the base stand the remains of a small altar of tufa in the form of a rectangular pillar upon a base; the whole is covered with red stucco. The altar is symmetrically placed opposite the center of the wide entrance into the room, while the shrine is built too far to the W. - another example of the asymmetry not uncommon in Pompeian shrines.

W. corner of the house, on the N. wall beside the ruins of a masonry structure which was probably the hearth, is the lararium painting on a white ground (dimensions of fragment remaining, h. 1.40, w. 1.50). In the lower zone two yellow serpents are confronted at a cylindrical altar furnished with offerings; the background is profusely adorned with plants. Above the painted altar a tile was embedded in the wall to serve as projecting shelf for offerings before the painted figures in the upper zone, of which only faint traces could be seen at the time of excavation.

W. corner of the cultivated area in the center of the peristyle stands a rectangular masonry ara pulvinata (0.53 by 0.46, h. 0.70), coated with stucco; upon the top of it traces of fire were visible at the time of excavation. Holes in the earth near the altar were explained by Spano (Not. Scavi) as left by the decomposition of the roots of a large tree which must have stood on this spot and which may have been an arbor sacra honored by sacrifice upon the altar.2 Not.

In the main room which is entered directly from the fauces, in the E. wall is a delicately painted, tall rectangular niche (h. uncertain, w. 0.70, d. 0.19, h. above the floor 1.20) - apparently a lararium. The white ground of the wall surrounding it is divided off into a series of rectangles by dark stripes, in imitation of a veneer of slabs of marble or of a wall built of rectangular blocks of stone, in emplekton.

It is framed by a painted aedicula (h. 1.45, w. 1.30) done in bright colors in the lower r. hand section of a wall decorated with a large rocky landscape. The painting shows the figures of Mars and Venus, standing side by side. Mars is unbearded, wears a red and blue variegated chlamys over his 1. arm, on which is a shield, and on his head a helmet; by his side hangs a sword; in the r. hand he holds a spear. To the r. of him stands Venus, adorned with a golden hair-band, bracelets on arms and ankles, and a necklace; she holds with the r. a mirror at shoulder height, with the 1. a green garment before her body. On the ground between the two deities lie a cuirass, a short spear and a gold colored object, perhaps a helmet, perhaps a drinking cup; to the 1. of Mars a shield; to the r. of Venus two indistinct objects in the form of segments of circles placed crosswise, one blue, one brown - perhaps shields.

Above a rectangular podium (0.95 by 0.60, h. 1.05) a pro- jecting arch is built against the back wall, thus forming a niche (h. 1.02, w. 0.70, d. 0.32). The front part of the upper surface of the podium evidently served as altar for sacrifices before the figures painted on the walls of the niche; on the front side of the podium is a step. On the back wall of the niche are painted Jupiter and the Genius, each pouring a libation upon the blazing cylindrical altar which stands between them. Jupiter stands on the r., bearded, wearing a red chlamys over his 1. shoulder and sandals on his feet; he holds sceptre and thunderbolt in the 1., patera in the r. It is not clear whether the unskillfully painted points on his head were meant to represent a wreath or a radiate crown, probably the former.

A fragmentary painting on the wall of the kitchen appears to have belonged to a lararium originally painted above it: Three men (the heads are missing) are busied about a hog: one with staff in his r. holds the animal by the ear; a second drags on a cord tied about its snout. Below lies the carcass of a slaughtered animal, opened as if for divination from the entrails. HELBIG 83. 326. VII, xiv, 5 House. A- In the S.

The wall around the niche and the border is painted red and marked off as a panel (h. 1.10, w. 1.25) by black stripes, and in the tall, rectangular space (w. 0.30) on each side between the niche and the edge of the panel is painted a yellow and black serpent, coiling vertically with its head at the top. On the back wall of the niche itself is painted a female (?) figure reclining upon a kline set beneath a kind of awning; the upper part of her body is nude, the lower part wrapped in a yellow robe; on her head is a wreath of leaves. Before the kline stands a three-legged table upon which are three jars. Fiorelli identifies the figure as Libera.1 On the floor in front of the niche stands a cylindrical masonry altar (diam. at top 0.35, h. 0.50) coated with stucco painted in imitation of red and white marble.

In the center of the N. wall of the viridarium, near the floor, is an arched niche (h. 0.59, w. 0.53, d. 0.26, h. above the floor 0.50). The wall around it is covered with a rectangular panel (h. 1.40, w. 1.65) of white stucco, upon which an aedicula faqade is marked off with low relief lines of yellow and violet: above the niche a wide pediment, into which the arch of the niche extends, and four slender supporting pilasters which rest upon a cornice that runs below the niche. A heavy cornice with den- tellated pattern marks the lower edge of the pediment and extends around the top of the inside walls of the niche (defining the vault and the lunette). The spaces between the supporting pilasters are dec- orated as five-sided panels. The work is delicately executed but somewhat irregular. Bull. Inst., 1874, 65. 333, VII, xv, 11 House.

Around it coils a serpent in yellow stucco relief, half its body in elaborate rings above and to the r. of the altar, and actually tied in a knot. Above the top of the altar are reported to have been painted "the usual fruits". On each side was the figure of a Lar, wearing red tunic and green pallium and carrying rhyton and patera, according to Helbig and Fiorelli - rhyton and situla, according to Mau in the Bull.

A masonry podium (1.20 by 0.70), ornamented along the upper edge with a stucco cornice, supports the shrine, built of tufa and coated with white stucco contemporary with that of the walls of the room which was spread not long before the catastrophe. The inside of the aedicula is divided into two stories (h. of the upper 0.52, of the lower 0.79), each supported by two columns and two antae. The roof is flat and was adorned with terra-cotta antefixes. One of these is preserved and represents a male face in the center of a kind of palmette (h. about 0.20).

Around the base of it runs a dado of marble. In this corner of the atrium the black border in the mosaic pavement is made to run around the two sides of the podium, thus marking its position. According to Mau, some other object stood here before the construction of the lararium, either the arca for the money2 or a smaller and more modest lararium, subsequently enlarged. Not.

VIII, ii, 39 Casa di Giuseppe IL1 The small room entered from the N. E. corner of the atrium was originally a cubi- culum, but in the later days may have served exclu- sively as the domestic sacellum.2 In the E. wall is set an arched niche (h. 0.38, w. 0.37, d. 0.26, h. above the floor 1.60), its walls painted red. On the back wall there is this painting (h. of the figures 0.21): in the lower 1.-hand corner a small altar is barely visible, to the r. of which stands the Genius pouring a libation from a patera held in his r.; he wears white tunic and white toga with narrow red border which appears to be distinct from the usual border of the praetexta which is also represented; a fold of the toga is drawn over his head; on his feet are shoes; against his 1. shoulder rests a cornucopia. To the r. of him stands a female figure in long, dark-blue chiton with sleeves which reach to the elbows, a yellow mantle passing around her waist and over her 1. shoulder, and yellow shoes; upon her head are visible faint traces of a yellow object, probably a diadem; in the 1. she holds a long sceptre, the lower end of which rests upon the ground; with the r. she extends a patera towards the altar. The attributes of this figure seem to identify her as Juno. If this identification is correct, some special reason must be sought for the juxtaposition of the Genius and the queen of the gods. Mau suggests that, since the female Genius was called Juno, she was represented like the consort of Jupiter, and so we have here the Genius of the master of the house with the Juno of his wife. Below and at the sides of the niche are the marks left by iron nails which had been driven into the wall, evidently to support garlands and taeniae. In the corner of the room to the r. of the entrance stood the ruins of a masonry base (0.50 by about 0.38) 1 In one of the rear rooms of this house were found two bronze statuettes: 1) Jupiter, seated, holding in 1. a sceptre, in r. a thunder- bolt; an eagle stands on the ground at his side (h. with base 0.13). 2) Harpocrates, winged, wearing on his head a wreath of leaves and the lotus above his forehead; in 1. he holds a cornucopia and places the index finger of his r. to his lips (h. with base 0.11).

Inst., 1883, 177. 371. (P1. 31, 1 and 2.) VIII, v/vi, 37 Casa delle Pareti Rosse. Against the E. wall of the atrium stands the lararium in the form of an aedicula with painting and statuettes. Upon a masonry base (0.91 by 0.73, h. 1.01 including a low step, h. 0.12, which runs all along the base of the E. wall) stand two unfluted columns of tufa (h. 0.70) with capitals, all covered with stucco and painted in imitation of yellow marble. Upon them rest architrave and pediment. The tympanum of the pediment is small because of the excessive width of the raking cornices, which are as wide as the architrave and horizontal cornice together and like them adorned with triple border of elaborate stucco relief. The tympanum is white, bordered with a red stripe and upon it are represented in small proportions gilded gladia- tonial arms: in the center a helmet, to the 1. greaves, to the r. a shield and above it a dagger.1 Around the 1 MAU apparently supposes these arms to indicate that the owner of the house was a retired gladiator; cf. R6m. Mitt., xiii, 1898, 50. top of the base runs a cornice of yellow stucco with simple white ornamentation. On the back wall within the aedicula is the lararium painting, done on a yellow ground: In the center the Genius in the usual attire and attitude stands beside an altar furnished with fruit; on each side is a Lar in green tunic and red pallium and holding rhyton and situla. On the dark-red ground of the base are painted two yellow serpents confronted at an altar which is painted in the center of the front side; on the altar are two eggs and a pine cone. The red ground of the base is continued on the walls of the atrium as a dado, The upper parts of the walls of the room are coated with coarse plaster, unpainted. Within this aedicula there stood at the time of exca- vation six bronze statuettes: 1) Aesculapius (h. with base 0.29), not of the usual type; he is here unbearded, has eyes inlaid with silver, wears a chlamys fastened with a fibula upon his r. shoulder, and holds in r. a purse, in 1. a large staff of ivory which rests upon a little base of silver and around which a serpent is coiled. Mau points out that this was originally a figure of Mercury, subsequently converted into one of the god of healing. 2) Apollo (h. with circular base 0.27), nude, his chlamys thrown over the column on which he leans his r. arm; his eyes are inlaid with silver, his hair is adorned with taeniae of silver; at his feet, on the 1. side lies a four-stringed lyre with silver strings. 3) Mercury (h. with base 0.22), wearing chlamys and winged petasos and having wings on his feet; in r. he holds a tortoise. 4) Hercules (h. with base 0.145), wearing the lion skin over his shoulder and holding in his 1. the club. 5-6) The two Lares, each (h. with octagonal base 0.21) wearing a tunic which flies out from his body, and boots, and carrying rhyton and patera. Clearly these statuettes were not originally companion pieces, as appears from the variations in height, in the bases and in the quality of the workmanship of the separate figures. Those of Apollo and Aescula- pius, which are the largest, are finely executed; the smaller ones are of poor workmanship, but that of Mercury is better than the others. In addition to the statuettes there stood within the aedicula a bronze lamp with a crescent moon on the handle. Not. Scavi, 1882, pp. 420, 437; Bull.

W. corner of the house, on the S. wall beneath the window which looks out upon the street, is a painting of Isis-Fortuna done on a rough rectangle (h. 0.59, w. 0.70) of white plaster bordered in red. The goddess stands, a wreath of leaves upon her head, the lotus flower on her forehead, her dark hair falling over her shoulders; she wears a long yellow chiton and blue mantle; she holds in 1. a cornucopia, in r. a yellow rudder, the lower end of which rests upon a globe. To r. and 1. of her there are large shrubs with red flowers; above and at the sides hang red and yellow taeniae.2 Not. Scavi, 1882, 280; Bull. Inst., 1884, 130; MAU, Pompeji, 362. 373. VIII, vii, 3 An area left vacant by the demolition of buildings, probably after 63 A. D., on the W. side of which there still remain some rooms. On the W. wall of a room which was perhaps the kitchen, is a partially preserved lararium painting. In the upper zone are visible the feet of the Genius, to the r. of him a Lar in red and blue tunic and boots, and to the r. of him a long staff set obliquely, to which are attached several indistinct red, curved objects - perhaps sausages. Below the figure of the Genius a tile was embedded in the wall to hold offerings. In the zone below, one serpent (black with yellow belly, red crest and beard) advances to the r., not to an altar, but towards a second serpent (smaller and all black with crest) which is coiled about a black omphalos covered with a green net and standing upon a rectangular base. Not. Scavi, 1883, 51; Bull. Inst., 1884, 136; BULARD, Mon. Piot, xiv, 1908, 70, fig. 21 gives a sketch of the serpents in this unusual attitude; cf. VI, xiv, 39. 374. (P1. 33, 1.) VIII, vii, 4/5 House. In the S.

The interior of the niche is of unusual pentagonal shape; the floor is paved with red stucco ornamented with little white stones. The rest of the structure is uniform white, except for the tympanum, which is yellow with a star in white relief in the center.

This aedicula was built as part of a house which was demolished in order to make room for the garden, as is clear from the fact that the lararium is earlier than the stucco of the W. wall, which was spread, not for the garden, but for a room of the earlier house.

In the peristyle, against the wall to the r. of the entrance from the street, stands a projecting base (h. 1.15, w. 1.40, d. 0.30). Traces of the original covering with slabs of marble are still to be seen and above it are the remains of a vanished lararium painting. The top of the pilaster was apparently meant to serve as altar for offerings. Nearby was found a small cylindrical altar of tufa (diam. 0.28, h. 0.32), which Mau supposes was used instead of the top of the pilaster in the last days of the city. Bull. Inst., 1884, 183. 376.

It is supported by twin scrolls and ornamented with several bands of stucco relief. Upon the ledge rest the bases of four delicate half- columns (h. 0.82) applied to the wall, two on each side of an arched niche (h. 0.82, w. 0.75, d. 0.35, h. above the floor 1.60). Instead of the usual pediment of stucco relief above the niche, a heavy gable roof here projects from the wall (at present restored). Within the niche a polychrome stucco cornice runs around the middle of the walls, dividing them into sections, the upper one painted red, the lower one blue. On the blue background of the lower section are human figures in stucco relief - now poorly preserved. The arched ceiling is fitted with a shell of stucco.

The r. ala of the atrium was converted into a special room for the household shrine at some time subsequent to the construction of the house, and a fine aedicula (h. 2.80) was then built against its E. wall.' Above a high masonry base (1.25 by 0.80, h. 1.45) two sturdy Doric columns with bases (h. 0.75) in front and two rectangular pilasters in the rear support architrave and pediment. The base was covered with stucco and painted in imitation of red and yellow marble; around the top of it runs a red stripe. In the center of the front side of the base is embedded a slab (0.35 square) of white marble bearing the inscription.:2 1 This sacellum was built, as we conclude from the in- scription affixed to the base, by the two freedmen Diadumeni after the death of their master, and dedicated to the worship of his genius - probably in gratitude for their freedom (cf. Overbeck-Mau). As for the date of the shrine, it is cer- tainly of the last period, as the aedicula itself, the late con- version of the ala into a sacellum, the character of the letters in the inscription (cf. Bull. Inst.), and the painting in the Fourth Style all indicate. 2 From this dedication we conclude that the aedicula contained figurines of the Genius and the Lares, though none were found here by the excavators.</page><page sequence="76">80 GEORGE K.

The podium is coated with stucco and painted in imitation of marble and in the center of each side is a painted wreath. The whole structure was richly ornamented with moldings of colored stucco. In this house, and perhaps within this shrine,' were found five bronze statuettes: 1) Jupiter, bearded and wreathed, wearing a chlamys and holding in r. the thunderbolt; the 1. probably originally rested upon a sceptre, now missing; at his feet an eagle (h. with base 0.237). 2) A male divinity, bearded, wearing a wreath of leaves and a chlamys; in his r. a patera; the 1. is raised as if resting on a support, now missing. This support may have been a trident and the god Neptune, or a staff with coiled serpent and the god Aesculapius (h. with base 0.079). 3) A crude figure of Hercules with club in r. and a chlamys over the 1. arm; a fillet is bound around his head (h. with base 0.132). 4) Isis-Fortuna with the crescent moon and lotus flower upon her forehead, holding cornucopia and rudder (h. with base 0.237). 5) A figure described as "a divinity wearing veil and having in 1. the cornucopia, in r. the patera"- apparently the Genius (h. with base 0.184).2 In addition to these figures of divinities there was also here a terra-cotta bust of a child with a bulla suspended from its neck (h. 0.079).

In the center of the upper zone, on the E. wall, stands a cylindrical altar between the Genius who holds cornucopia in 1. and with the r. pours a libation from a patera, and two young men, apparently camilli, each of whom holds in the 1. an open acerra and extends the r. to the altar, as if to place something thereon. To the 1., behind these two camilli, stands the tibicen - of smaller proportions than the other figures. Behind the Genius is another camillus, likewise of smaller stature, holding a dish in his 1. On each side of this group of five figures stands a Lar, larger than the other figures, carrying rhyton and situla. Across the top of the panel is stretched a green garland. In the zone below, a bearded and crested serpent coils to the r. towards a square ara pulvinata of tufa (0.40 square, h. 0.56) which stands in the corner. The altar is adorned with a molded base and a cornice around the top, and dates, probably, from the Tufa Period. It was not originally intended to stand in a corner and was disfigured in order to fit it for this new position, and then covered with a thick layer of stucco. Each of the two free sides is ornamented with a garland, molded in stucco over the top of one cut in relief on the surface of the stone, Around the corner, on the S. wall, in the space corresponding to the upper zone on the E. wall, is painted Vesta, holding in 1. a long torch and with r. pouring a libation from a patera upon a yellow cylindrical altar. At her side stands an ass wearing a wreath of leaves, its fore part visible between the altar and the goddess, who holds in 1. a red halter attached to its muzzle.

She holds in r. a green patera and in 1. the red reins attached to the muzzle of the ass. The account in the Not. Scavi describes the two serpents at an altar painted below the niche, though they are not mentioned by either Sogliano or Mau. This painting Mau says was probably older than that described above in "A". The layer of stucco upon which the figure of Vesta was painted has fallen away, partially revealing beneath it an earlier layer, upon which can still be seen two standing figures, each wearing a green garment and having a large yellow bulla suspended from his neck; they are both alike and their posture suggests that of the Lares.

There is no podium, for the niche extends to the floor. The aedicula fa9ade consists of a fluted pilaster with Corinthian capital on each outer edge, supporting an architrave adorned with a band of egg design in relief, upon which rests the pediment. The raking cornices are ornamented with similar bands of egg design and the tympanum with sacrificial instruments in relief: a patera umbilicata in the center, a culter on one side, an aspergillum (?) on the other. A fine stucco cornice runs around the edges of the niche, and in the spaces between them and the rectangular fagade are painted ornaments. The interior of the niche is coated with yellow stucco, and upon it are painted a leafy tree with birds flying about it, and, on each side, Cupids and marine monsters. The vaulted ceiling is ornamented with a stucco shell. On the floor within the niche, stands a rectangular base, apparently intended to support a statue; it is coated with stucco and upon the front side is painted a mask, The entire structure is elab- orately ornamented with polychrome stucco relief, particularly the pilasters at the sides and the bands surrounding all three sides of the pediment. The work was carelessly done, for the niche is hollowed out, not quite in the center of the fagade, but too far to the 1., leaving a considerable space between the niche and the r. pilaster, practically none between it and the 1. pilaster.

IX, vii, 16 House. In the kitchen which is entered through the first room on the r. of the atrium, on the N. wall, to the r. of the entrance and on the W. wall, is the lararium painting (h. 1.50, w. on N. wall 0.60, on the W. wall 1.94): On the r. of an altar stands the Genius in the usual attire, pouring a libation from a patera; on the 1. is the lower part of the figure of the tibicen and behind him stands a camillus wearing white tunic and carrying in 1. a shallow dish, in r. taeniae. Behind the Genius the popa, wearing a crown of leaves, holds a knife to the throat of a hog adorned with a red band around its belly. On each side of this group of four is a Lar in the usual attire. In the lower zone two yellow serpents, each with red crest, are confronted at an altar. The painting thus described is all on the W. wall of the room. On the N. wall are painted the following kitchen objects (from top to bottom): a hearth, an uncertain object - perhaps the fire-wood for the hearth - a hog's head, a pot on a fire. Traces of the older lararium painting, not entirely covered over by the later, are to be seen on the W. wall, where the figure of a Lar can be made out on the 1. side, Bull.

But late in the history of the city it was separated from the garden. and the door to the kitchen was walled up. On the E. wall of this new room is a lararium painting: On the r. of a tripod stands the Genius, wearing a wreath and having a fold of the toga drawn over his head; in 1. he holds a cornucopia, in r. a patera from which he pours a libation.

The opening of the niche is framed by two pilasters which seem to support the simple architrave and pediment above them. The base is coated with red stucco, the upper part of the structure with white, including the interior of the niche, the back wall of which is outlined in green. 1 The position of this house is thus described in the reports: Not.

In the S. E. corner of the atriolum entered directly from the posticum, two low walls (h. 0.80) enclose a precinct (1.80 by 1,0), and within it is the lararium. The outher surface of these walls is painted a uniform black, the inside- like the lower portions of the two walls of the room within the precinct - to represent yellow marble; along the top of the wall originally ran a wooden rail. In the N. wall of this precinct a space was left for the door. In the center of the space within the walls stands a small stone altar, consisting of a rectangular plinth supported upon a conical base; against the E. and S. walls outside the precinct stand two masonry benches. In the S. wall within the precinct is a rectangular niche (h. 0.56, w. 0.51, d. 0.26, h. above the floor 1.25), adorned with an aedicula fagade (h. 1.0, w. 0.64) of grey marble, consisting of a plain rectangular slab on each side of the niche, a pediment above and a heavy block (0.12 thick) projecting on the level 4 In different places in the region of the peristyle of this house were found two bronze statuettes: 1) Harpocrates, with the lotus flower upon his forehead, holding in the 1. a cornucopia and placing the index finger of the r. to his lips (h. 0.07). 2) Jupiter, wreathed, wearing a chlamys and holding in his r. the thunderbolt (h. 0.078).

Within the niche a low step is built against the back wall and in front of it a circular depression for offerings is cut in the block that forms the floor. In the pediment is painted an owl. On the wall on each side of the niche is the painted figure of a Lar with rhyton and situla, standing between two trees. On the adjoining E. wall is the panel with the famous painting of Bacchus beside Vesuvius.' In the center rises a mountain peak, conical in shape and very precipitous, to the 1. of which stands Bacchus (h. 0.40), wreathed and wearing long green chiton with sleeves, and having his entire body covered by an enormous bunch of black grapes. In raised 1. he holds the thyrsus adorned with taeniae, with r. he pours a stream of wine from a kantharos into the mouth of the panther which half reclines at his side. Below, a large crested serpent approaches a burning cylindrical altar which stands near the r. side of the painting. Across the top is stretched a heavy garland with two large taeniae; in the center above it a bird is represented in flight, while a second flies in the space to the r. of the mountain. The execution of this panel is exceptionally good for a lararium painting. SOGLIANO 32; Not. Scavi, 1879, 285; 1880, 232 with a fine photograph of the Vesuvius panel, pl. 7; Bull.

C- Against the S. wall of the large garden stands a structure containing a single rectangular room (3.11 by 3.45, h. varies from 2.15 to 2.30) which housed a sacellum, though it appears to have been originally built as a kitchen. The walls are coated with white stucco; in the W. wall is the entrance door, in the N. wall a window. A masonry bench (h. 0.47) is built into the N. E. corner and extends along the greater part of the N. wall and half the E. wall. Above it in the N. wall there are two arched niches (h. 0.40, w. 0.58; h. 0.40, w. 0.61; h. above the floor 0.92), each fitted with projecting shelf below it and having its inside walls coated with plain white plaster. Three holes in the wall above them (h. above the floor 1.45) mark the position of the brackets which supported a shelf extending the whole length of the N. wall; above them is the window. A third arched niche (h. 0.57, w. 0.55, d. 0.24) is located in the S. half of the E. wall, surround- ed by a rectangular panel of white stucco marked off by red and black stripes. The upper part of this panel, above the niche, is decorated with a painted double garland, suspended from two painted nails. The floor of the niche projects as a shelf, and within it is a step (h. 0.07) upon which stood the statuette described below. Several iron nails had been driven into the wall on each side of the niche, evidently for the support of ornamental garlands or taeniae. In the S. E. corner of the room stands a rectangular marble table, while on the floor before the niche is a masonry altar (0.50 square) coated with stucco. Finally, in the S. W. corner of the room are the ruins of a masonry structure which Mau supposed to have been the hearth for use in the days when this room was a kitchen. Of the numerous objects found in this room (a mirror, a candelabrum, three lamps and many pots and vases these last probably having stood upon the shelf which ran the length of the N. wall), the only one with religious significance is the statuette from the niche in the E. wall. It represents a female figure clad in chiton and mantle, reclining upon a kline ;1 her 1. elbow rests upon a cushion, in her r. she holds a patera umbilicata (h. 0.165; dimensions of the kline h. 0.055, w. 0.10, length 0.25).

A mezzanine, built at the height of 2.25 above the floor, extended over the inner half of the room (length of the room 4.40, length of the mezzanine 2.0). The walls of the room up to the height of this mezza- nine were decorated simply upon a white ground, probably in the time of the Third Style. But this decoration did not extend to the back (S.) wall; it was coated with a poor white stucco and in it were set three arched niches - a larger one (h. 0.51, w. 0.56, d. 0.28, h. above the floor 1.50) in the center, a smaller one (h. 0.39, w. 0.36, d. 0.24, h. above the floor 1.55) on each side - all coated with white stucco. In the street wall is still another niche, formed by walling up a former window. Thus the room was left windowless. The recess for one end of a bed in one of the walls of the room presumably dates from the time when the room was a simple cubiculum. Rom. Mitt., v, 1890, 248; Not. Scavi, 1891, 261. 463. C- On the W. wall of the garden, near the S. end, was an unusual lararium painting (h. 1.60, w. 2.15). To the 1. of the center of the picture stands an altar, yellow with a red step before it, and around it coils a red serpent. On the r. stands Bacchus (h. 0.75)- a poorly preserved figure, of which only the violet boots and the lower end of the thyrsus are distinct. Between the god and the altar stands a panther, its head raised, probably to receive the stream of wine poured for it by the god; behind Bacchus is the figure of a bull. On the 1. of the altar is a black animal (h. 0.33), which Mau describes as more like an ass than a horse and which Sogliano calls a goat. On each side of this group is a tree with flowers and birds, and beside it stands a male figure resembling a Lar (h. 0.37 and 0.39). Each of them dances like a Lar, having the leg near the center raised and the knee bent, while he rests his weight on the other leg with knee straight; the hand nearer the center is raised, the other lowered; each wears a short, girded tunic, of which only the part below the girdle is well enough preserved to show that it is partly green, partly red, The attributes of these two figures differ: that on the 1. holds with both hands (the 1. raised, the r. by his side) a spear or thyrsus, while the other seems to carry rhyton and situla. It would appear, then, that there is here but one Lar, accom- panied by a figure from the train of Bacchus. Farther to the r. is a Bacchante (h. 0.34), her blond hair streaming, as she runs rapidly; she wears a long white garment and holds a thyrsus over her r. shoulder and a tambourine in lowered 1. The space for a corresponding figure on the 1. is lacking. Beneath the Lar and the Bacchante stands Silenus (h. 0.28) in short white garment, his 1. held by his side, in his r. a thyrsus. Below the follower of Bacchus is another Bacchante (h. 0.31) in long white garment and running to r., she turns her head to the side and in outstretched r. holds a human head (un- bearded): Agave with the head of Pentheus.1 In the floor of the garden, before the painting is a kind of rectangular basin (0.45 by 0.52, d. 0.45) with a rim raised (0.15) above the floor of the garden. In the S. W. corner stood a small cylindrical altar (diam. 0.225) of terra-cotta, the top of which showed signs of burning, and near it were found charred bones of victims. A short distance away, near the S. wall, stood a small altar of travertine (diam. 0.27, h. 0.28) and, to the N., opposite the center of the W. wall and 0.20 from it, stood (still in situ) a conical object of lava with curvilinear profile (h. 0.42, diam. at the bottom 0.19).2 Rom.

W. corner of the court by means of a wall running parallel to the S. wall and extending 1.14 from the W. wall, and covering the enclosure thus formed with a sloping roof (h. varies from 1.60 to 2.0). At the E. end of this sanctuary stands a small altar of tufa (0.50 by 0.40, h. 0.60) originally coated with stucco. The inside surface of the N. wall is decorated upon a white ground with a line-drawing: an aedicula and within it a male figure, standing, clad in a yellow, tunic-like garment, the front of which is white between two red stripes running vertically from shoulder to hem; his flesh is reddish; in 1. he holds a palm (?) branch at the level of his waist, in r. three taeniae; around his head is a fillet. The opposite (S.) wall is also covered with white stucco, the W. wall with a coarser variety. Near the sacellum was found a female head of terra- ' A drawing of this figure is given in Rdm.

W. corner, is an arched niche (h. 0.50, w. 0.65, d. 0.25, h. above the floor 1.50), its walls coated with white stucco bordered in red, its back wall adorned with a stucco cornice. On the wall to the r. of it is the lararium painting: On the 1. stands a tripod of unusual form2 with a dark-colored vessel upon it. The Genius, standing to the r., pours a libation upon the tripod; he wears a wreath of leaves; the toga does not seem to be drawn over his head as usual, though the preservation of the painting is poor at this point; he holds no cornucopia. Behind and to the r. stand two figures: in the first plane, a camillus, also wreathed, and carrying fruit in a shallow dish; above and farther r., a popa, wreathed and carrying an ax. To the 1. of the Genius are two wreathed figures, apparently women, though it is impossible to be certain, for only the upper portions of their figures are preserved. On the 1. side of the niche there was not room for painted figures, but on the adjoining S. wall the figure of the Genius appears again, clad in white toga and pouring a libation upon a yellow cylindrical altar with a fire; he is unbearded, his flesh is reddish, in his 1. he holds a yellow cornucopia. This double Genius certainly has some special significance. Mau saw the explanation in a graffito below the figure on the S. wall: EX SC. The good execution and the unusual size (h. 0.09) of the graffito confirm his opinion that this is no chance scratching but an inscription explaining the painting above it. This figure of the Genius must have been executed on the occasion of the reception of the Genius Augusti into the domestic cult by decree of the 'See No. 464 note. a A drawing of this tripod is given in Rom. Mitt. Roman Senate. 3 Here, then, would be the Genius of the Emperor, represented alongside that of the master of the house who is shown with his family. If this is the case, the painting is to be dated shortly after the battle of Actium. Certainly the two painted figures of the Genius are not contemporary. That of the Genius Augusti is simpler and prior to the dado of red, and intentionally preserved at the time of the redecoration of the room. The other Genius is contemporary with the red dado and the redecora- tion. R?om. Mitt., v, 1890, 244; Not. Scavi, 1891, 258; MAU, Pompeji, 278; DE MARCHI, i, pp. 75, 94; C. I. L. iv, 5285. 467.

Villa of Julia Felix.' A- Somewhere in this villa-like complex (the exact location is unknown) was found a lararium painting (h. 1.21, w. 1.78), done in two zones upon a white ground. In the center of the upper zone stands the Genius, clad in the toga praetexta, a fold of which is drawn over his head; he holds in 1. a cornucopia and with r. pours a libation from a patera into the fire that burns on the top of a cylindrical altar painted in imitation of colored marble. On the other side of the altar stands the tibicen with his 1. foot upon a scabellum. Behind the tibicen a very small popa with a white limus about his hips pushes towards the altar a hog adorned with a red girdle; behind the Genius stands an equally small camillus in white girded tunic, carrying in his 1. a shallow dish con- taining fruits (?), in his r. infulae. On each side of this group stands a Lar in white tunic and red pallium, pouring a stream of wine from rhyton to situla. The Lares are larger than the Genius, the Genius is larger than the tibicen. All figures are wreathed; the Lares and the Genius wear high boots, the three assistants low shoes. Across the top of the panel is stretched a triple garland. In the lower zone two huge scaly serpents are confronted at a cylindrical altar furnished with two eggs; the serpent on the r. has crest and beard, that on the 1. has only the crest; the field is filled with luxuriant foliage.

A second serpent, also male, approaches from the r. Behind the serpent on the 1. stands a brown dolium containing reed- like plants. The figures on the 1. side wall were too poorly preserved to be described in detail; according to the excavation report they were: "a woman wearing a mantle and holding in her 1. a cornucopia, in her r. a staff with which she seems to be rolling a globe on the floor" - apparently Fortuna; and "a male figure wearing a mantle and holding with both hands a cornucopia".

The description he takes from a print in Mazois (ii, pi. 8), where such a goddess is pictured sitting upon a throne supported by legs in the form of lions' paws; she wears tunic and mantle and, upon her head, a modius. This figure is certainly part of Mazois's restoration of the interior of the shop and as such has no rightful place in the catalogue of Helbig. Mazois refers to the drawing of the taberna as: . . . la restauration que j'ai donnee de cette boutique. ... Les decorations m'ont hte fournies par diverses peintures de Pomphi." In the text (pp. 43f.) he makes no mention of niche or painting.

A- On the N. side of the open court called il cortile delle cucine, which lies to the S. of the large peristyle, is a lararium: Against the wall stands a masonry ara pulvinata (0.71 by 0.45, h. 0.90) and in the wall above it is a rectangular niche (h. 0.76, w. 0.80, d. 0.28, h. above the floor 1.40) with a stucco pediment above it. In the floor of this niche is embedded a small terra-cotta altar, its upper surface decorated with a gorgoneion and two heads of bulls, roughly modeled; its sides are likewise decorated with reliefs, a feature which indicates that the altar must originally have stood free instead of being embedded in the floor of the niche. Within the niche were found two sculptured heads, one of terra-cotta representing a goddess, the other of tufa representing Hercules (h. 0.17). From the wall below and on both sides of the niche the last layer of plaster has fallen, revealing beneath it an earlier layer, decorated with a rude figured painting in red and yellow. The unusually primitive technique of this painting, its similarity to the primitive art of the Oscan and Samnitic tombs of S. Italy, and the strangeness of the figures here represented, led Maiuri to the important conclusion that here was preserved a fragment of the pre-Roman art of the house shrine. The paintings were very poorly preserved at the time of excavation and have almost disappeared since then, but we have the following description written by De Petra in the Not. Scavi.

B- In a square room which does not communicate with the inner part of the villa but opens only on the portico which precedes the main entrance to the villa, in the E. wall is a niche (h. 0.45, w. 0.50, d. 0.25), its inside walls coated with a rough plaster of pounded sherds, its floor a tile which projects from the surface of the wall. Along the N. wall a high masonry podium extends from the N. W. corner for half the length of the room; it is covered with red stucco and before its northern extremity stands a cylindrical masonry altar, coated with plaster like that of the walls of the niche and decorated with painted festoons. Against the W. wall stands a masonry block, likewise coated with plaster of pounded sherds. Sogliano suggests that this room was a domestic sacellum, in view of its isolation and its equipment with niche and altar. Figures of the gods may have stood upon the masonry block against the W. wall as in the case of another villa (see below No. 500). Not. Scavi, 1897, 393. 489. Boscoreale, in Piazza Mercato. On the N. side of the peristyle-court, in the pillar separating the entrances to two smaller rooms, is set a semi-circular niche and on the wall on each side of it is painted a Lar. These Lares are not dressed as usual, but wear green trousers which reach to the ankles, instead of having their legs bare, and have black shoes on their feet instead of the usual high boots. Below the niche is painted a sacrificial scene: A burning altar stands between two trees and upon it two figures pour libations: on the r. the Genius, on the 1. a female figure, probably the Juno; both are dressed in white and have their heads covered. Behind the Genius stand a camillus with fillets in his r. and a second figure damaged beyond identification; behind the Juno are a second camillus with fillets in his r. and a shallow dish containing offerings in his 1., and the tibicen. Below this scene is a single serpent. Not. Scavi, 1898, 421; SOGLIANO, Scavi, 345.</page><page sequence="95">POMPEIAN LARARIA 99 490. Boscoreale, contrada Grotta Franchini: Villa P. Fanni Synistoris.

W. wall, is a vaulted niche (w. 0.55, h. somewhat less), adorned with a stucco aedicula fagade; in the floor are marks indicating that a bronze statuette was affixed there. Rom.

E. wall of the peristyle-court, above the door which leads into the cella vinaria, is a large niche with aedicula faqade (h. 1.10, w. 0.63) con- sisting of two half-columns and a pediment supported upon a projecting shelf.

In a room near the cella vinaria and opening off the portico were found numerous objects of jewelry, and with them three silver statuettes: 1) Isis-Fortuna, standing upon a high hexagonal base - also of silver - wearing on her head the modius and on her forehead crescent moon and lotus flower; in r. she holds a rudder, in 1. some ears of grain, and on that wrist hangs a situla (h. 0.13). 2) Venus Anadyomene, standing upon a high rec- tangular base; she is wholly nude, has a diadem on her head and a dove on the base beside her (h. 0.095). 3) A coiled serpent raising its head aloft above a low rectangular base. These figures were probably part of the equipment of a lararium, as Sogliano remarks. Not. Scavi, 1899, 393 and figs. 2-4 illustrating all three statuettes. 494. Pompeii, near the Porta Vesuviana.1 On the wall of a room of the upper floor was found a painting of Fortuna (h. 0.38) done on a red ground; she wears a green chiton with purple mantle; in 1. she holds a cornucopia, in r. a rudder; at her feet lies a globe.

Boscoreale, contrada Pisanella: Villa Aselli. A- Opening on the N. portico of the large peristyle- court is an open exedra, on the back (N) wall of which is a panel (h. 0.68, w. 0.65) bordered by festoons of flowers and containing the painted figure of Venus Pompeiana. The goddess is represented standing, clad in tunic and mantle of dark red, and adorned with a jewelled diadem, necklace, pearl earrings and, on her r. hand, a large finger ring set with precious stones. She rests her 1. arm upon an inverted rudder and in the same hand holds a long golden sceptre; her r. she holds across her breast. To the r. of the goddess stands Amor, holding a mirror, and farther on is another figure which cannot be identified because of poor preservation. To the 1. of the goddess is a bird with two cherries in its beak. Not. Scavi, 1921, 429. 497. B- Opening on the E. portico of the peristyle-court is another exedra, and upon the S. wall of it, above a dado painted in imitation of dark-green marble to the height of 1.20, is a sacred painting of the serpents. The panel (h. 1.10) is bordered at the sides by two green trees and above by a garland of leaves, flowers and fruit suspended from three painted nails. The serpents are confronted, one on each side of a cylin- drical altar, upon the top of which is a round basket of offerings - among them are two plums, a fig and a pine cone -; in the background are plants. Not. Scavi, 1921, 435. 498. C- In the second room north of that described in "4B", in the S. wall is a rectangular niche at the height of about 2.0 from the floor, and upon the wihte ground of the back wall is a sacred painting of Bacchus. The god is standing, wears chlamys and high boots, and upon his head he has a wreath of vine leaves; in the 1. he holds a thyrsus and with the r. pours a libation from a patera upon a square altar adorned with garlands; beside the altar stand two rams, their heads turned to the god, On the ground, to the r. of Bacchus, is a large basket of grapes. Across the top of the painting is a fruit garland suspended from painted nails, A strip of white stucco (w. 0.28) surrounds the niche on all sides and upon it, above and at the sides of the niche is painted a festoon of colored flowers; below the niche a</page><page sequence="96">100 GEORGE K.

A- In the E. wall of the peristyle-court, to the 1. of the entrance into the torcularium, is a niche which apparently served as shrine, for within it were found fragments of a plaster statuette of some divinity. Not. Scavi, 1921, 437. 500. B- Upon the top of a masonry base built against the E. wall of a room which opens off the kitchen, were found the following seven bronze statuettes: 1) Jupiter (h. including the square base 0.09), bearded, nude except for the robe over his 1. shoulder and around his legs, seated upon a throne; in r. he holds a patera, the 1. is raised as if resting upon a sceptre, now missing. 2-3) Two figures of different sizes (h. 0.12 and 0.09) represent Isis-Fortuna, fully clad and having upon her forehead a crescent moon and a disk sur- mounted by two plumes; in r. she holds a rudder, in 1. a cornucopia. 4) Genius, wearing the toga with a fold drawn over his head (h. 0.08), and holding in r. a patera, in 1. an acerra. 5) Neptune, bearded, nude except for a mantle over his 1. shoulder (h. 0.10); in r. he holds a dolphin (?), the 1. is raised like that of Jupiter, as if supported upon a sceptre or trident, now missing. 6) Helios (h. 0.13) with a radiate crown upon his head; he wears a mantle over 1. shoulder and fore- arm; the attributes of both hands are missing. 7) A young faun (h. 0.12), nude except for a goat skin over his 1. arm; upon his head are two pro- jections - apparently horns; in r. he holds a syrinx (?). Not. Scavi, 1921,440 with a photograph of all the statuettes together, fig. 11. 501. Boscoreale, contrada Pisanella. A- In the W. wall of the portico which precedes the torcularium, above the dolium purificatorium, is a niche (h. 0.40, w. 0.25), its inside walls painted yellow; on the wall surrounding it is an aedicula fa9ade, consisting of two slender columns supporting a pediment - all coated with white stucco. On the floor before the niche were found three lamps. Not. Scavi, 1921, 458. 502. B- The large room in the N. W. corner of the villa was originally a triclinium but had been converted into a kitchen and work-room before the catastrophe; in the S. end of the E. wall is a semi-circular niche (h. 0.52, h. above the floor 1.45) which may have been a lararium. Not. Scavi, 1921, 448. 503. Boscotrecase, contrada Rota. To the 1. of the door which leads into the garden from the open area before the main entrance to the villa, a lararium stands against the wall; it consists of a broad niche (w. 0.78) framed by an aedicula facade with two half-columns supporting the pedi- ment; the whole structure is uniformly coated with white stucco. Not. Scavi, 1922, 460. 504. Two excavations in the vicinity of Pompeii uncovered the ruins of INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL STRUCTURES. Near the Sarno, to the S. of the ancient city, in the contrada Bottaro, was found a series of sixteen shops preceded by a portico, evidently flanking a street which ran through the suburb that grew up along the river.' In these shops were unearthed the following fragmen- tary evidences of cult practice: 1) A fragmentary lararium painting with only the figure of one Lar remaining, Not. Scavi, p. 434. 2) A bronze bust of Minerva, p. 431. 3) Three statuettes of Mercury, pp. 428, 429, 436. Not. Scavi, 1901. 505. Near the Amphitheatre, but outside the city walls to the S. W., was found an industrial plant of unex- plained nature, which had been rebuilt after the eruption of A. D. 79. In a small room which is almost entirely filled with a large circular vat, on the W. wall, is an interesting lararium painting: The Genius stands beside an altar and on each side is a Lar with rhyton and patera; on each side of this group is the god Pan, his two figures being symmetrically disposed.

A collection of numerous objects, among them three statuettes: 1) A bronze figure of Isis-Fortuna standing upon a modeled circular base (h. of statuette 0.11, h. of base 0.033). She stands with the weight on her 1. leg, the other slightly bent at the knee; she wears a long chiton fastened only on her r. shoulder, with a short apoptygma and a himation which envelopes the lower part of her body. Her hair is parted in the center, drawn in waves around her head and gathered into a characteristic nodus on her neck; on the front of her head she wears a high crown and above it a lotus flower. In r. she holds something by her side, probably the end of a rudder, in 1. a cornu- copia filled with fruits. The nude parts, neck, face and arms, are executed with a truth to nature and a care unusual in so small a statuette, and the body beneath the garments is finely indicated. Traces of gilt remain, indicating that the whole statuette was originally gilded (photograph Not. Scavi p. 380). 2) A bronze statuette of the Genius (h. of the figure 0.178, h. of the base 0.057), standing on a square base which is modeled and decorated with a festoon and floral motives incised upon each face. The</page><page sequence="105">POMPEIAN LARARIA 109 Genius stands with his weight upon the 1. leg; wears a tunic and full toga, which is drawn over his head, whence it falls over the 1. shoulder on the front side forming a broad sinus, on his feet shoes. In r. he holds a patera umbilicata and in 1. the lower end of a cornucopia, which rests against the shoulder on that side. Around his forearm is coiled the tail of a serpent with a scaly body, which passes behind the body and raises its head with open mouth and protruding tongue above the head of the Genius. The execution is mediocre, especially noticeable in the nude parts (photograph p. 381). 3) A white marble statuette with poorly preserved surface representing a nude female figure standing with her weight on the 1. leg; she holds the 1. arm across her breast; the r. arm and the legs are missing. Behind the r. shoulder appears an object resembling a quiver which suggests Diana. The figure was originally gilded, as is clear from traces still remaining (h. of the part preserved 0.14). These objects evidently comprised a treasure carried away by some fleeing inhabitant at the time of the catastrophe and dropped in the course of his flight. Not. Scavi, 1910, 379. 10.
