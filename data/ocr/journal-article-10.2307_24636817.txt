<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOKS FOR YOUNG READERS Early Books of Award- Winning Authors REVIEW BY MICHELLE CARNEY AND STOREY MECOLI, Journal of Education Freight Train, The Snowy Day, Charlotte''s Web, Let the Circle Be Unbroken, Number the Stars. For those versed in children's literature, these titles are familiar, well-regarded classics that teachers and parents feel confident in introducing to young readers. But where did the beloved authors and illustrators of these texts begin? What came before these now classic works? In an issue of the Journal of Educa tion that features the work of early career scholars, this is a fitting question to ask. In this review, we focus on selected classic chil dren's authors' first works, promising predictors of those to come. We are well aware that the world has changed dramatically since the publication of these books and those that we will review, but it is fair to say that the books are true to Ezra Pound's view that a book is "a classic because of a certain eternal and irrepressible freshness" (1960, p. 26). Evident in these early works is the authors' careful attention to the craft of writing that became the hallmark of their books. Rickards and Hawes (2006) have suggested that there is value in helping the young reader to explore the work of the writer through the study of authors' craft. All the books reviewed here provide a range of powerful exemplars for teachers and parents to use in pointing out how authors and illustrators carefully craft their words and images. Helping young writers to understand how choice of words, realistic dialogue, and engaging illustrations con tribute to the richness of the reader's response can introduce a lifelong quest for young authors who are working on developing their own craft. In studying classic authors' first works, it is also enlightening to young readers and writers to discover the ways in which renowned writers and artists have developed their craft over time. We Read: A to Z BY DONALD CREWS 27 pages. Greenwillow Books, 1967. (Ages 3 to 8) Author's Awards: Caldecott Honors Award, 1979, 1980 Beloved children's author Donald Crews is perhaps best known for his picture books about modern transportation, Freight Train and Truck. Also well recognized are the books about his childhood and summers spent in Florida, such as Shortcut and Bigmama's. His first book, however, focused on a much more basic topic, the letters of the alphabet, that serve as building blocks for young readers. As Crews notes on the very first page: "From the alphabet, with just twenty-six letters, A to Z, all words are made" (p. i). As any reader of children's books is well aware, the alphabet is a common choice for authors and illustrators. However, it is not the subject matter that makes Crews' first effort stand out and gives the reader a glimpse of the celebrated author yet to come. Instead, it is the unique way Crews approached the subject. While readers are often treated to letters of the alphabet being served up alongside illustrations of objects that begin with that letter—A is for apples, for example—Crews took a decidedly different tact. The author used locations and descriptors to accompany the alphabet letters. Crews, a talented artist, paired these descriptors with bright, engaging graphic designs that catch the reader's eye. For instance, Crews wrote: "Cc, corner: where the yellow is" (p. 3). Adjacent to this page is a fiery red page, a small, sunshine-yellow square in the bottom right corner. The result of this different approach to illustrating the alphabet is not just a book that is unique in its design, but also, one that is refreshing and visually arresting. The book progresses with Crews using a limited palette of col ors—black, white, red, green, blue, orange, and yellow. "Jj, jagged: sharp points" (p. 10). A stark white background is over taken by a jagged black design, filling all but the edges of the page with its "sharp points." "Ss, size: one large, one small" (p. 19). Again, the white background, this time with a large red square fill ing the largest part of the page, excepting the small black square couched in the bottom right corner. By limiting his palette to these few vibrant colors, the graphic designs are all the more appealing. Predictive of the author's future contributions to children's lit erature is the fact that this book lends itself to the reader who has progressed well beyond early literacy. By incorporating directions and properties with the alphabetic letters, Crews also provides a text that is useful for early spatial reasoning. "Vv, vertical: up and down" (p. 22), Crews writes, and the reader observes bright blue and green stripes lined neatly (and vertically) across the page. "Pp, parts: pieces separated" (p. 16) is accompanied by a large black square separated into smaller black squares by thin white lines. This is later contrasted with "Ww, whole: in one piece" (p. 23), where this same black square is restored to its entirety. "Qq, quar ters: four equal parts" (p. 17), and "Rr, right: the half where the blue is" (p. 18) are other examples of how young readers are learn ing more than just the alphabet when they read this book. As the reader pages through the book, a sense of the pleasure Crews experienced as the writer/illustrator is evident. There's a playfulness that comes through the text and illustrations—page 14 teases us with "Nn, nothing:," and all we get is a blank white 73</page><page sequence="2">page—that both delights and intrigues the reader. Those who enjoy the illustrations and text of Crews later books should become acquainted with his earliest work. My Dog Is Lost! BY EZRA JACK KEATS AND PAT CHERR 32 pages, Viking, Penguin Putnam Books for Young Readers, 1966. (Ages 4-8) Authors'Awards: Caldecott Medal, 1963, 1970; Children Choices Award, International Reading Association and Children's Book Council, 1977; University of Southern Mississippi, Silver Medal lion for Outstanding Service in the Field of Children's Literature, 1980; Keats Archives established by the de Grummond Collection of Children's Literature, at the University of Southern Mississippi in Hattiesburg, 198S; UNICEF Ezra Jack Keats International Award for Excellence in Children's Book Illustration established, 198S—1994; Ezra Jack Keats New Writers Award established by the New York Public Library, 1986; Ezra Jack Keats Bookmaking Competition established by the New York City Department of Education in collaboration with the Foundation, 1986; American Library Association, Posthumous Honoree for Outstanding Advo cacy for Libraries in the 20th Century, 2000; Ezra Jack Keats New Illustrator Award established by the New York Public Library, 2001; Society of Illustrators, Posthumous Lifetime Achievement Award, 2006 Erza Jack Keats was born in 1916 in East New York, the third child of a Polish Jewish family. As did other immigrants, he knew poverty and hardship during the Great Depression. The biograph ical information provided on his foundation's website, (www.ezra jack-keats.org) describes an artistically gifted young man torn between helping his family deal with economic hardships and pur suing his love of painting. Keats, born Jacob "Jack" Katz, also endured anti-Semitism, an experience that later influenced his choice of characters. Perhaps best known for The Snowy Day, A letter to Amy, and Peter's Chair, Keats was one of the first children's authors to portray, with integrity, Black children in urban settings. His characters were nei ther token representatives nor caricatures, but fully realized and authentic members of a diverse community. This sensitive por trayal of those who were often marginalized is evident in his first book, My Dog Is Lost, co-authored with Pat Cherr. The book's main character is Juanito, a young boy whose family has recently moved to New York City from Puerto Rico. Adding to his troubles of being a stranger in a strange land, Pepito, his canine best friend, is missing. Although Juanito knows no English (and as Juanito notes, neither does Pepito), he gathers his courage and ven tures into the city to find his lost dog. In a double page of detailed charcoal sketches, Keats brings us with Juanito through the grocery store, the playground, the Laundromat, and the subway. The reader feels the hot tears ready to spill from Juanito's eyes as he searches without success. Juanito's fortunes begin to change when he spies a sign in the window of the bank, "Aqui se habla espanol." He enters the bank and says to the teller, "Mi perro se ha perdido," and the kind man writes the English translation, "my dog is lost." Holding fast to both the paper and his love for his dog, Juanito continues his search through the diverse neighborhoods of New York City: Chinatown, Little Italy, and Harlem. In each neighbor hood, children come to Juanito's aid, providing him with the Eng lish words to described his pet; rojo, peludo, zambo, grande, and joining his search calling, "Pepito, Pepitol" Just as hope is lost, and the children must leave Juanito to start for home, a police officer arrives. Juanito shows the officer his now crumpled paper, and . . . jau-jaul Pepito barks from atop the officer's horse. He is found! Keats's bilingual story skillfully contextualizes Spanish words and phrases, situating them as language in use and increasing the likelihood that the reader will learn and remember. The illustra tions also provide visual cues to the words' meanings. For exam ple, Juanito points to a woman wearing a thick, shaggy coat as he describes his dog as peludo. As Juanito travels from neighborhood to neighborhood, he collects not just friends but also words. In this way Keats repositions the role of language from the beginning of the story, when it separated Juanito from his new home, to becom ing a way to connect to new people and places. The Ezra Jack Keats Foundation maintains an informative web site (www.ezra-jack-keats.org) where parents and educators will find resources such as lesson ideas, audio recordings of selected books, script adaptations, and biographical information. Also of note are the Ezra Jack Keats Foundation mini-grants, which offer monetary support for creative projects that promote multicultural and intergenerational connections. Readers who live in the vicin ity of Cambridge, Massachusetts, may visit the Gutman Library in the Harvard University Graduate School of Education, where there is a collection of selected papers and illustrations created by Keats, the first children's author-illustrator to be so honored. While Keats' later work will show the increasing influence of his training in fine art and his maturation as a children's writer, in the pages and illustrations of My Dog Is Lost the reader senses a writer searching for his voice. Young readers, their teachers, and parents can be grateful that through the pages of his books, Ezra Jack Keats' voice continues to be heard almost half-century later. Stuart Little BY E. B. WHITE, ILLUSTRATED BY GARTH WILLIAMS 131 pages. HarperCollins Publishers, 1945. (Grades 3-5) Author's Awards: The Gold Medal for Essays and Criticism from the National Institute of Arts and Letters, 1960; Presidential Medal of Freedom, 1963; Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal, 1970; National Medal for Literature, 1971; Elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters, 1973 The name, E. B.White, is synonymous with classic children's liter ature. He is perhaps best known for Charlotte's Web, his timeless story of friendship, salvation, and nature's cycle of birth and death. In classrooms across time and geography, teachers and students 74 JOURNAL OF EDUCATION • VOLUME 193 • NUMBER 1 • 2013</page><page sequence="3">have accepted White's invitation to enter a barn where they meet Wilbur and Charlotte and come to share in the joys of friendship, the grief of loss, and the pleasures of life's progress. In Stuart Lit tle, his first book for children, we find the beginning threads of these universal themes of the human condition, albeit most often told through an imagined world of animals, a place that White will masterfully portray throughout his writing career. Elwyn Brooks White was born in Mount Vernon, New York, in 1899. After his piece on the Bronx River was published in The New Yorker, he was invited to become a contributing editor in 1927 and established a reputation for the insightful commentaries that were featured weekly in the "Notes and Comment" column (http://www.notablebiographies.com). In 1959, White was invited to revise The Elements of Style, the seminal handbook for writers that was the original work of his former professor, William Strunk. In all three of White's books for children, Stuart Little, The Trumpet of the Swan, and Charlotte's Web, the reader can appreciate White's adherence to his own advice in the clear, precise, and direct language he uses to tell each of these stories. Garth William's illustrations in shades of black and gray provide an engaging counterpoint to White's text and are a tribute to a part nership that continued for all of White's books. E. B. White tells his own story of the beginning of Stuart Little and the beginning of his career as a writer of children's books. "Many years ago, I went to bed one night in a railway sleeping car, and during the night I dreamed about a tiny boy who acted rather like a mouse. That's how the story of Stuart Little got started." (http: / / www.scholastic.com/teachers/contributor/e-b-white). As the book begins, the namesake character arrives into the Lit tle family of New York City. It is immediately apparent that Stuart Little is a remarkable baby because he has many of the character istics of a mouse including his small size and a "mouse's sharp nose, a mouse's tail, a mouse's whiskers, and the pleasant, shy manner of a mouse" (pp. 1—2). After the doctor reassures the Littles that their mouse-child is healthy and robust, the baby is given the same love and care as older brother George. The pace of the story allows no opportunity for the reader to feel sorry for the diminutive Stuart but instead sees him as a "great help to his parents, and to his older brother George, because of his small size and because he could do things that a mouse can do and was agreeable about doing them" (p. 4). In a subtle yet powerful message of acceptance and the capacity of the imagination to suspend disbelief, particularly at this time, White writes, "At birth, Stuart could have been sent by first class mail for three cents, but his parents preferred to keep him rather than send him away . . ." (pp. 2—3). Indeed, there is a matter-of-fact manner in which White pres ents the arrival of a mouse-child to this family. Only in private do Mr. and Mrs. Little discuss the challenges of having a mouse-child in the family. They worry about Stuart hearing disparaging refer ences to mice lest they give him nightmares and a poor self-con cept. They worry about a mouse hole in the corner of the pantry and whether Stuart might be drawn to its dark reaches; after all, remarked Mr. Little ". . .he does look like a good deal like a mouse. And I've never seen a mouse yet that didn't like to go into a hole" (p. 11). They do not seem to worry, however, that the fam ily cat Snowball, is less than enamored with Stuart for obvious cat and mouse reasons. The first half of White's story tells of Stuart's adventures in the larger world. He takes the trolley to travel confidently in New York City, fashioning mouse-sized dimes to pay his fare; expertly cap tains a model sailing schooner in a Central Park pond; and with the help of his friend Margola, the beautiful hen-bird, he even survives a near miss on the city garbage barge. Unlike the movie adapta tion, these adventures are told without slapstick humor, but with an eye to Stuart's competence and determination. The reader is not surprised when, in the second half of the book, Stuart bor rows a model motor car and takes to the open road to find Mar gola after she disappears from her usual perch in the Little's Boston fern, just as spring arrives. Among his on-the-road adventures, readers will enjoy Stuart's day as a substitute teacher, as he puts aside the typical day's lesson plans and engages the students in a discussion of what it might mean to be Chairman of the World. Not only are young readers invited to imagine a mouse-child, but perhaps in the ultimate tri umph, to read about this creature assuming the role of a teacher. In a wonderful example of White's subtlety in allowing a small creature to aspire to a large goal, he writes the following exchange between Stuart and the students, "Well, alright then, let's talk about the Chairman of the World. The world gets into a lot of trouble because it has no Chairman. I would like to be Chairman of the World myself." "You're too small," said Mary Bendix. "Oh, fish feathers!" said Stuart. "Size has nothing to do with it. It's temperament and ability that count. The Chair man has to have ability and he must know what is important. How many of you know what is important?" (p. 92) The answers that follow are evidence of White's appreciation for the beauty in the commonplace, a celebration that will con tinue in his later books, The Trumpet of the Swan and Charlotte's Web. "A shaft of sunlight at the end of a dark afternoon, a note in music, and the way the back of a baby's neck smells if its mother keeps it tidy" (p. 92). In a nod to the more serious themes children might be allowed to consider, Stuart-as-teacher guides them in determining what world-wide laws might be necessary and fair to all constituents by directing a skit featuring the bold theft of a student's treasured item and the positive outcome of the event. The book's final chapter describes Stuart's continuing and ulti mately successful journey to find Margola (p. 131). As if to fore tell the road ahead in E. B. White's future as a children's author, Stuart "peered ahead into the great land that stretched before him, the way seemed long. But the sky was bright, and he somehow felt he was heading in the right direction" (p. 131). And with that, Stu art climbed back into his roadster and "started up the road that headed north" (p. 131 ) to continue what White described as his BOOKS FOR YOUNG READERS 75</page><page sequence="4">"quest" for what is "perfect and unattainable" (Neumeyer, 1994, p. xxv). Through the craft of anthropomorphism, this gifted author portrays animals and their human friends in stories that make it possible for young readers to experience vicariously, some of life's more challenging journeys. In White's books, we find guidance for our most human quests. Song of the Trees BY MILDRED D. TAYLOR, ILLUSTRATED BY JERRY PINKNEY 48 pages.The Dial Press, 197S. (Grades 3—S) Author's Awards: Newbery Medal Award Winner, 1977; Coretta Scott King Award, 1982, 1988, 1990, 2002; Jane Addams Honor Citation, 1976, 1977, 1982, 1996; First Prize Council on Interra cial Books for Children, 1973; Outstanding Book of the Year Cita tion, New York Times, 197S, 1981, 1987; Christopher Book Award, 1988, 1990; ALA Notable Book Citation, 1976, 2002; Boston Globe-Horn Book Award for fiction, 1988 For many decades Mildred D. Taylor's books have been held in great esteem by scholars, teachers, parents, and other readers. Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry, perhaps the most well known, is a book students recall and can reflect upon long after they have closed its cover. This celebrated author has produced nine books over the course of her career, many of them centered on the Logan family and told through the reflective voice of young Cassie Logan. Song of the Trees was where both Taylor's career and Cassie's story began. Although this was Taylor's first published work, it was a forecast of the brilliance to come, garnering several awards, including Winner of the 1973 Council on Interracial Books Award: First Prize African American. Much of Taylor's work has focused on African American fami lies living through the Great Depression, and the author has acknowledged that much of the content is autobiographical, often drawing from the experiences of her own family. In the opening note to the reader,Taylor writes: This book is based on a true story, one that actually hap pened in my family. As a small child, I often listened to my father recount his adventures growing up in rural Missis sippi during the Depression. His vivid description of the giant trees, the coming of the lumbermen, and the events that followed made me feel that I too was present. I hope my readers will be as moved by the story as I was. (p. 3) Like many gifted authors, Taylor draws upon what she knows, and what results is a story that is compelling, unsettling, and moving. Taylor's purpose here is to challenge the reader, to urge the reader to think critically about the events set in motion. In this, she suc ceeds admirably. Written in first person perspective, the plot of the story evolves through the eyes of Cassie Logan, a young African Ameri can girl growing up surrounded by a loving family, headed most days by her mother and her grandmother (whom she calls Big Ma) and including three brothers—Stacey, Little Man, and Christo pher-John. David Logan, the family patriarch, has been forced to work far from home, laying railroad track to earn the money that will provide for the family. The absence of a beloved and respected father is another trial imposed on the family by the Depression. When the story opens, Cassie awakes to a gray and misty morn ing and stumbles downstairs to greet her family. Cassie and her brothers set out to see to their chores on the family farm, but not before Cassie overhears her mother and Big Ma talking about a troubling shortage of money and supplies, including Mama's med icine. Cassie is shooed out the door and is soon running and play ing with her brothers, darting amongst the majestic trees. Taylor paints Cassie's communion with the trees in such detail that the reader can feel Cassie's sense of home amongst the tall sentinels. You can't, you can't, you can't catch me, I taunted, dodging from one beloved tree to the next. Around shaggy-bark hick ories and sharp-needled pines, past blue-gray beeches and sturdy black walnuts I sailed while my laughter resounded through the ancient forest, filling every chink, (p. 16) The beauty of Taylor's language shines through passages such as these. However, the children's revelry is soon cut short as they realize that many of these trees are scarred by large white Xs on the trunk. Hearing rustling amongst the leaves, Stacey urges his sib lings into hiding as two white men come into view. The children listen as the men, Tom and Mr. Andersen, discuss the clearing of the forest. Mr. Andersen, in particular, seems to know the Logan family, noting callously that they are in no financial position to turn down his lowball offer for the clearing of their trees and talking dismissively about David Logan. When Tom suggests that David won't stand for Mr. Andersen's interference, Taylor's dialogue is a chilling representation of the prejudice and real dangers African Americans faced at this time. The differential power dynamic is bleakly summed up in this exchange. "Mr. Andersen .. ."Tom hesitated a moment, looked up at the silent trees, then back at Mr. Andersen. "Maybe you should go easy on them," he cautioned. "You know that David can be as mean as on ole jackass when he wanna be. . . ." Mr. Andersen looked uneasy. "What's that gotta do with anything?" "Well, he just don't take much to any dealings with white folks." Again,Tom looked up at the trees. "He isn't afraid like some." Mr. Andersen laughed weakly. "Don't worry 'bout that, Tom. The land belongs to his mama. He don't have no say in it. Besides, I guess I oughta know how to handle David Logan. After all, there are ways ..." (p. 22) By portraying the children overhearing this menacing conversation while shielded only by a thin veil of leaves,Taylor allows her read ers to feel and fear for their innocence and vulnerability. 76 JOURNAL OF EDUCATION • VOLUME 193 • NUMBER 1 • 2013</page><page sequence="5">As the story progresses, Mr. Andersen tries to intimidate the women of the Logan family into selling the family forest for a mere sixty-five dollars. Not knowing where else to turn, Cassie's mother sends Stacey off on the family horse to retrieve David. The action shifts when six-year-old Little Man, upset about the damage done to his family's land, whacks Mr. Andersen in the leg (hard) with a tree branch. Mr. Andersen and the loggers detain Little Man, Cassie, and Christopher-John, and Mr. Andersen decides the chil dren could use some discipline. He takes off his belt and has dealt the first biting lash to Cassie's bare legs when David Logan appears. David forces Andersen to release the children, and then forces his hand. Stacey and David had buried dynamite amongst the trees, and David tells Andersen that unless he and his men immediately vacate his land, he'll blow them all to kingdom come. When Andersen attempts to call his bluff, David replies, "One thing you can't seem to understand, Andersen ... is that a black man's always gotta be ready to die. And it don't make me any difference if I die today or tomorrow. Just as long as I die right" (p. 44). Mr. Andersen and his men reluctantly leave the property, but not before Andersen makes vague threats about accidents that could happen to David down the road. Taylor's powerful prose makes it possible for the reader to understand that although David has managed to temporarily shift the power dynamics through desperate actions, the respite is brief, at best. The novel ends with David, a kindred spirit to his daugh ter Cassie, looking up at the trees. "Dear, dear old trees," I heard him call softly, "will you ever sing again?" I waited. But the trees gave no answer, (p. 48) The inspired narrative of Song of the Trees, complemented by Jerry Pinkney's stark pencil shaded illustrations, was a preview of the powerful storytelling that became a hallmark of Mildred D. Taylor's celebrated career. A Summer to Die BY LOIS LOWRY 150 pages. Random House Children's Books, 1977. (Ages 10-13) Author's Awards: Newbery Medal, 1990, 1994; Margaret A. Edwards Award for Lifetime Contribution to Young Adult Litera ture, National Jewish Book Award, Boston Globe-Horn Book Award, 1987, 1993; International Reading Association Children's Book Award; Parents' Choice Gold; International Board on Books for Young People Honor List Lois Lowry enjoys a long and illustrious career in Young Adult lit erature. Her novels have been essential to the middle school Eng lish Language Arts booklist, with Number the Stars and The Giver among the favorites of teachers and students. In the beginning was a book close to the author's heart—A Summer to Die. This page-turning first novel deals with the difficult and painful loss of a sibling, an experience that Lowry, knows well, having lost her older sister, Helen, when they were both too young. The novel treats life and death honestly, contrasting the pain of loss with glimpses of life's surprising moments of joy, even in the midst of tragedy. In Lowry's first book, the reader comes to know Meg, the younger sister of Molly, and the daughter of two loving parents. Whereas Molly is beautiful and popular at school, Meg often feels like the odd duck. She is too keenly aware that people don't regard her the way they regard Molly and often finds herself enthralled with her sister's outer beauty. Lowry describes the awe of a younger sibling in this passage: [EJvery now and then I glance at her and see her as if she were a stranger. One night recently she was sitting in front of the fire doing her homework, and I looked over because I wanted to ask her a question about negative numbers. The light from the fire was on her face, all gold, and her blond hair was falling down across her forehead and in waves around her cheeks and onto her shoulders. For a second she looked just like a picture on a Christmas card we had gotten from friends in Boston; it was almost eerie . . . Then she saw me watching her, and stuck her tongue out, so that she was just Molly again, and familiar, (p. 19) Additionally, Molly is easy in a way that Meg is not—quick to laugh, slow to get angry, eager and enthusiastic about even the most mundane things. Lowry paints a picture of someone who is easy to love, and as a reader, one can understand how this can cause Meg to live in a perpetual state of feeling like "the other one." Life changes, however, when Meg and Molly's father, a college professor decides to temporarily relocate the family to a house in the country so he can finish his book. Meg instantly takes to the place, making friends with Will Banks, the seventy-year-old neigh bor as well as a young, free spirited couple expecting their first child. A talented photographer, Meg improves her craft, and her father builds her a darkroom of her own. The difficulty for Meg is Molly, who is sick most of the year and subject to nosebleeds. She is worn down and ill-tempered, not like herself. One night after the sisters squabble, Meg awakens to Molly asking for help. Her hair, face, and clothes are covered with blood. Meg runs to her parents' room: '"Something's wrong,' I told them. 'Something's wrong with Molly'" (p. 54). From this moment, Lowry skillfully weaves the tale of a family dealing with a beloved member's serious illness—the sadness, worry, and fatigue. However, what Lowry is most adept at is sprin kling in small perfect moments of joy, including the time when the family, often solemn and tense, find themselves having an impromptu dance party in their living room. Or the moment where Meg photographs the birth of the child of the young cou ple down the road, an experience she recounts to Molly the last time she sees her alive. Lowry, having gone through an experience similar to Meg's loss of her sister, does not spare the reader the pain of Molly's death. However, she sensitively makes the point that life, with all its beauty, goes on, even after the worst moments. She writes, in Meg's voice: BOOKS FOR YOUNG READERS 77</page><page sequence="6">Time goes on, and your life is still there, and you have to live it. After a while you remember the good things more often than the bad. Then, gradually, the empty silent parts of you fill up with sounds of talking and laughter again, and the jagged edges of sadness are softened by memories. Nothing will be the same, ever, without Molly. But there's a whole world waiting, still, and there are good things in it. (p. 136) With an authentic and sympathetic voice, Lowry invites the reader to feel empathy for Meg, Molly, and their family. Not to pity them, but to understand them with all their talents, virtues, and limita tions. This attention to real and honest emotion hints at the com plexity of feelings Lowry is able to capture in her later novels. A Summer to Die was her first novel in her distinguished career, and it still stands the test of time. We hope that the teachers and parents who first read these books in their earlier years and the children they now nurture will find in them "a certain eternal and irrepressible freshness" (Pound, 1960, p. 26).
