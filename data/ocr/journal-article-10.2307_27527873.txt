<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PERSONALITY OF GOD. The title of this paper will seem to most people de cidedly pleonastic. All who accept the Christian faith, or indeed any religion of historic standing, hold to personality in the Deity ; yet while there have always been those who hesitated to admit, or openly denied, conscious self-activity in the Ultimate Source of the Cosmos, it is the especial work of the sensational philosophy of our day to teach that the splendid mechanism of the world, all the phenomena of thought and all the emotions of the heart have their origin in a'power which is itself incapable of purpose or design, of thought or comprehension, of sensation or conscious ness in any form. They do not deny that there is an Ulti mate Power, an original First Cause, and they do not much care if one call that power God, though they themselves use the word with some degree of scorn. The one thing they deny it is personality. This denial is the radical and fatal error, as we think, in positivism, agnosticism, skepticism, or by what other name this teaching may be known. There appeared not long ago a remarkable book, The Foundations of Belieff by the Right Honorable Arthur James Balfour, which has excited great attention and has brought once more this old question sharply before the public* It has been reviewed and criticised by all the lead ing journals in England and this country, and may serve as an excuse for presenting this subject to the readers of this JRjsview. The name under which Mr. Balfour ranks all classes of those who teach that all things proceed from "blind causation alone", is Naturalism, which will be ac cepted by those whose doctrines it is intended to character ize, as a mild euphemism, and with certain qualifications by those who are of a different way of thinking. 1 The Foundations of Belief Being Notes Introductor/ to the Study of Theology?

The most valuable part of Mr. Balfour's book is con tained, undoubtedly, in the first four chapters, in which he treats, negatively it is true, of Naturalism, and shows in a very conclusive and graceful way, its insufficiency to meet man's needs as an ethical, aesthetic, and rational being. The cogency of his dialetic is undeniable, and Mr. Herbert Spencer, who, of course, recognizes himself as the target of Mr. Balfour's logic, in his reply, which appeared in The Fortnightly Review for June, 1895, does not even attempt to answer it. We quote Mr. Balfour : If on the naturalistic hypothesis the sentiments associated with beauty seem like a poor jest played on us by Nature for no apparent purpose, those that gather round morality are, so to speak, a deliberate fraud perpetrated for a well defined end. The consciousness of freedom, the sense of re sponsibility, the authority of conscience, the beauty of holiness, the admira tion for self devotion, the sympathy with suffering ? these and all the train of beliefs and feelings from which spring noble deeds and generous am bitions, are sure to be mere devices for securing to societies, if not to indi viduals, some competitive advantage in the struggle for existence. They are not worse, but neither are they better than the thousand and one appetites and instincts, many of them, as I have said, cruel, and many of them disgust ing, created by similar causes in order to carry out through all organic nature the like unprofitable ends ; and if we think them better, as in our un reflecting moments we are apt to do, this, on the naturalistic hypothesis, is only because some delusion of the kind is necessary in order to induce us to perform actions which in themselves can contribute nothing to our personal gratification. The remaining chapters, while admirable in their way, are open to serious adverse criticism. So far as one can discover from this work, Mr. Balfour is without a philoso phy. His treatment of transcendental idealism is very faulty and inadequate. He apologizes for it, and acknowl edges himself to be unequal to the task of dealing fully with so formidable a subject, either in its historical or its meta physical aspects. He goes on in Part Four to give some " Suggestions towards a Provisional Philosophy ", but as a constructive argument it can hardly be called satisfactory. We shall not attempt to epitomise it. The fundamental inquiry which underlies this whole ar gument, and all arguments which attempt to investigate the</page><page sequence="3">The Personality of God. 89 empirical philosophy is, obviously, the question of the Per sonality of the Ultimate. Are there rational grounds for holding, affirmatively, that what Mr. Spencer calls the " Un conditioned Cause, without beginning, and without end ", is possessed of personality? We feel ourselves compelled to that conclusion upon purely scientific grounds, and we shall attempt to point out the line of argument which seems to us conclusive. In the first place, then, what is personality? We answer that the essential characteristic of what we call person is the power of self-activity ? the capacity of self determination. Is there any such factor in the Cosmos as we know it? We appeal to the same source of knowledge as that relied upon with so much ostentation by the advo cates of Naturalism ? experience. If we know anything we know by experience that we determine our own activities in all cases where there is purposive action. The universal consciousness of man declares those only to be our own proper actions where there is no coercion brought to bear upon us from any source whatever. It is true that those who deny freedom in man say that if we could know all the conspiring causes which bear upon us, we should see that our freedom is only apparent and not real ; but this is a pure assumption, directly contrary to con sciousness. It is an undeniable fact that we are not con scious of constraint in our personal determinations, and we know that they are not the resultants of conspiring causes outside of us with the same certainty ? nay, with even greater certainty than we know that there is an external world about us ; for the phenomena of the external world come to us through the medium of our senses, which are often deceived, and this knowledge is a primary deliver ance of the conscious self. Undoubtedly, one is moved to particular determinations by motives, though it is quite clear that they are not always discoverable in conscious ness, as is shown by the constant declaration that one does not know why one did this or the other thing ; but can any</page><page sequence="4">y The Sewanee Review* ene honestly declare that the motive which governed his action in any case was so strong and so definite in con sciousness that he knew he could not have disregarded it? The question here is not whether we are free, as known to a hyper-human intelligence, but whether we knowr our selves to be free with the highest degree of knowledge pos sible to us. To hold that we are ultimately bound by a rigid predetermined order does even greater violence to our knowledge in consciousness than to hold that there is no ex ternal world, and no phenomena to be construed. This is certainty, if there be certainty in the universe ; for be it carefully borne in mind that no conceivable being, angel or arch-angel, however high in the order of the uni verse, could have in the least degree greater certainty. Mr. Balfour puts this venerable question in a striking light, as follows : The spectacle of all mankind suffering under the delusion that in their decisions they are free when, as a matter of fact they are nothing of the kind, must certainly appear extremely ludicrous to any superior observers were it possible to conceive, on the naturalistic hypothesis, that such ob server should exist ; and the comedy could not be otherwise than greatly relieved and heightened by the performances of a small sect of philosophers who, knowing perfectly well as an abstract truth that freedom is an absurd* ity, yet, in moments of balance and deliberation, fall into the vulgar errorv as if they were savages or idiots. One feels like apologising for discussing this question to-day after the ages of discussion it has undergone ; but it is a crucial point in this controversy with the sensational school, which holds, in the words of Herbert Spencer, that the universe is u without conceivable beginning or end, an$ without intelligible purpose". Accepting then the fact that there is a factor of self-activity in the economy of nature, experience tells us also that there is an element of utter in activity as well ? that there is not only no power in matter, as such ? in dead matter, to act in any manner whatever, but that it is possessed of an insentient resistance which actually sets up an opposition to any change whatever with respect to rest Qt motion. W^ hare encounter the dorn am</page><page sequence="5">The Personality of God. 9l of mechanism, set over against the whole world of biologi cal nature in which the life-factor removes animate nature from that which is inert. It is in this inert world that the fundamental laws of mechanics, as enunciated by Sir Isaac Newton, find their application. Now the first of these laws, upon which the other two depend, and upon which the whole enormous fabric of science depends, is an enunciation of this truth that an inert object cannot change its state, either to move when at rest, or to come to rest when in motion. It follows necessarily that there is no such thing as change in the world, so long as it is denied that self-activity is possible. Matter cannot act, for inertia never acts until acted upon. It is a pure re sistance, which is ready at any moment and in any possible direction, to oppose any possible change of state. It can not begin an action. It is a stubborn inactivity, always in opposition. If this be all the source of action in the uni verse, then there can be no such thing as change. But everybody at all acquainted with the history of philosophy knows that Parmenides and the Eleatic school taught, more than two thousand years ago, that there is no such thing as change in the Cosmos, and no such thing as motion possible ? that our senses deceive us, and that all the varying phenomena of the visible world are a delusion. Do the empirical philosophers accept such a doctrine? If so, why do they study phenomena and the laws of change? The very ground-work of this school of thought is the world of change ; and the huge untruth of the Eleatics is repudia ted by them without a moment's hesitation. And yet it is the logical andL necessary consequence of a denial of a self active factor in the universe. The fundamental postulate of all science is that matter cannot change. Then if there be change, it must be due to something that is not material y and since they freely admit change in everything, they must admit a factor in the universe with the power of self-move ment. So far as we can see this is a demonstration. Let us, however, look a little further into this fundamental</page><page sequence="6">92 The Sewanee Review. postulate of physical science, the law of inertia. It is that a body at rest must remain at rest, if in motion must move in a straight line with uniform velocity. Whence came this law, and how do we know that it is absolutely binding in mechanics? Does it come from experience? Then the phenomena of rest and of motion in a right line must be matters of observation. But does not science tell us that there is no such thing as rest in the universe? And does any one acquainted with the laws of physics pretend that he ever saw a body move in a straight line? Not only does not any body in nature move in a straight line, but by no contrivance could motion be produced of such character. A body falling under the action of gravitation comes near est to it. It is demonstrated in mechanics that all bodies acting under a directed force, such as gravitation, must de scribe an arc of one of the conic sections, and that the equation of a parabola which is that of the trajectory of such a moving body becomes that of a right line only under conditions which in fact are impossible. No ; experience never gave us this first law of motion, nor either of the other two. Experience can be made to approximate these laws, but never actually to verify them. They are the result of the pure intellect in its application of the principle of causation. A body at rest with no power to move itself must remain at rest, simply because it is impossible to im agine anything beginning to be without a cause. ; and so a body in motion, without the power to change its state or condition, must move straight on without change of velocity, since it cannot go slower or faster, nor change to right or left. The other two laws of motion exhibit the same charac teristics, so that the very foundations of mechanics, and all physical science look solely to the intellect for their source and unity. Or again, all physical science is agreed that all the phe nomena of the material world are to be resolved in final analysis, into mass and motion. But what is mass? Un</page><page sequence="7">The Personality of God. n doubtedly it finds its essence in pure resistance ? in this same inertia of which we have been speaking. Even the force-atoms of Boscovitch must have it. The " perfect fluid " of Helmholtz and Thompson cannot dispense with it, and LeSage's " intra mundane corpuscles " can do nothing without it. But resistance is a pure negation, and from this fact, if from no other, it is disqualified from an independent self-subsisting existence. And yet it is the one, and only one ultimate property of matter. Motion does not fare better under the scrutiny of a final analysis. What is motion? The question is as old as philosophy, and it has not yet, and never can be an swered. Of course we know what relative or phenomenal motion is ; but that pre-supposes something fixed, and we are wholly incapacitated to conceive of such a thing. The question is not, what is a moving object? But what is that of which we are made conscious in such object. If it be replied that motion is only object in motion, then it follows that there is no such thing as motion per se: it is not when the body is at rest, and is in varying degrees as the body moves under an accelerating energy, gaining motion at every point, or losing it when retarded : with the absurdity superadded, that it must have two velocities at every point, arriving with one velocity and departing with another. Phenomenal motion is something the body has, but it is not what it is. It is a quality or accident, and is thus, also, dis qualified for an independent, self-subsisting existence. Thus both mass and motion are incapable of taking rank in the Cosmos as the eternal and ultimate ground of all phenom ena ; and mechanics, and with it the whole magnificent fabric of science, is compelled to look deeper than mass and motion for the ultimate ground of all phenomena. A moment ago we said that it is inconceivable that any thing should begin to be without a cause. This is true, but experience, as we have seen, shows us that there are many events which do emerge or begin to be by reason of our personal effort, and thus we know ourselves to be the</page><page sequence="8">94 The Sewanee Review. cause of such events. We do know, therefore, original causes, and the one characteristic of personality is this orig inating power. We are each of us the uncaused cause, con sciousness being the witness, of numberless events ? of all events whatever of which we are in the secret of their cause. Nobody ever sawT anything done, that is a purposive end accomplished, when he was in the secret of the doing, in which he did not know a personal element to be present and the cause. If men are the only original cause, then is man the cause of all there is in the universe of change. Science tell us constantly, that the movement of my hand causes a new arrangement and change in the entire uni verse. It is absurd, of course, to think of the human personal ity as the cause of the Cosmos, but it is more absurd, if that may be, to think of a universe without thought in it in any form. There was a time, according to the consentient voice of science, when man did not exist, but all things were slowly and steadily working on to his coming. From the nebulous condition of matter out of which the earth comes, not to go further back, on through the successive stages of the evolution of the world, all things conspired together to prepare the earth for his habitation, until at last he ap peared, the consummation and acme of innumerable ages of work. During all this time, if there be no intelligence in the universe except in man, there was no being in exist ence to comprehend or in any wise direct this enormous preparation ? all-was but the result of a " blind fumbling of atheistic chance." Now that surely is a curiously constituted intelligence which can really believe that of all the infinitely possible combinations of the elements of nature that one particular combination which showed the perfect adaptation of means to ends, and produced what we know as the Cosmos was ac complished and is still maintained without purpose and with out intelligence. If the thinking, purposing being we know as man, and all his .environment could be accomplished</page><page sequence="9">The Personality of God. 95 without thought, and without purpose, how can we hold that thought and purpose are superior to " blind fumbling of un conscious, insentient, uncausing nothingness". How can we go on talking about an Infinite First Cause if that original Source of all Phenomena was, and still is, incapable of pur pose ; incapable of doing what man in a limited way can do? 46 Shall the work say of him that made it, he made me not; or the thing framed of him that framed it, he is without un derstanding". But let us return once more to the postulates of science. There is no disposition on the part of the empirical think ers to deny the necessity of an Ultimate Cause, and this Cause manifests itself by force. . Now, the great exponent ot this school in seeking for an ultimate ground for his philos ophy, after considerable perplexity and hesitation, helped by the advice of Professor Huxley and at his suggestion, fell upon " Persistent Force " as the immutable somewhat to be the basis upon which to build his splendid superstructure. As he tells us, he first thought of calling that " Eternal Un conditioned Reality, without beginning and without end" from which all things proceed, " Conservation of Energy ". He could not, however, permit himself to use the word " energy ", since, as he says, it is impossible to think of energy without something possessing the energy. It was at this point that he sought the aid of his great friend, Pro fessor Huxley who suggested that he might avoid the ob noxious word by substituting persistence for it. " This," says Mr. Spencer, " meets most of the objections, and though it may be urged against it that it does not directly imply pr? existence of the force at anytime manifested, yet no other word less faulty in this respect can be found. In the ab sence of a word specially coined for the purpose, it seems the best, and as such I adopt it". But a strange thing has happened since that day. After all the care taken by the philosopher to avoid the word " energy " which would carry with it the notion of an ener gizer, and "conservation" lest it should imply a conserver,</page><page sequence="10">?&gt; The Sewanee Review. advanced science has gone back upon " force " altogether^ and declares that there is no such thing, no such objective entity; and declares that the discarded "energy" which the philosopher says cannot be thought of " without some thing possessing it ", is after all the one thing which per sists ! But Mr. Spencer really meant better than his expression would imply ; for he says at the beginning " by persistence of force we really mean the persistence of some cause which transcends our knowledge and conception." " In asserting it we assert an Unconditioned Reality, without beginning or end." This is all the theologian could ask if Mr. Spencer were only consistent in abiding by it. He now' holds that his; Ultimate Cause "which transcends our knowledge and con ception" is an " Infinite and Eternal Energy." He still dif fers from the most rigid theologian only negatively. Affir matively his words are clear and sweeping : " I held at the outset, and continue to hold, that the Inscrutable Existence, which science in the last resort is compelled to recognize as unreached by its deepest analysis of matter, motion, thought, and feeling, stands towards our general conception of things in substantially the same relation as does the Crea tive Power asserted by theology." Negatively he hesitates to apply the appellation " Person " to this " Inscrutable Ex istence," this " Infinite and Eternal Energy," not because he would degrade the Unknown Cause of all things below personality, but because he would raise it higher. Now that is exactly what the theologian would do, but since personality, the power of self-activity, is the very highest prerogative of which we have any conception, the theologian is unable to reach a higher than infinite self-de termination and infinite intelligence, and in bestowing upon what'Mr. Spencer calls the "All-being " the infinite best, the theologian cannot see how he is in any wise degrading the Source of all Power. If there be anything higher, that is what the theologian declares to be essentially due the Deity. But to deny original creative self-order to the Supreme</page><page sequence="11">The Personality of God. 9T Cause and Source of the Cosmos seems to the theologian a monstrous degradation. To deny to the Deity a power which we undoubtedly possess of purpose and self-order, however limited, is to degrade the Deity below personality even in man. But to return again to the postulates of science, there is great significance in the effort now making to drive the word "force" out of the vocabulary of scientific terms. That word is never used now by those who are abreast of the advanced thought in science, without an apology. It is a convenient word, however, and from long use it is hard to abandon it utterly, but we must no longer think that there is any external reality answering to it. What we have been calling the " force of gravitation," vis viva and vis inertice, are but fossils of thought thrown up on the shores o? time by the endless surges of the ocean of thought. It is now the "energy of gravitation," "kinetic energy," the "re sistance of inertia." In all recent works on mechanics and engineering strains and stresses, are " pushes " anct " pulls," " effort " and "resistance." This comes from dis carding force as an objective entity. If force is gone, what remains? The only resort is to consciousness. When one lifts a weight or resists a blast of wind, one is conscious of effort. One knows that one exerts energy. This is a per sonal reality. We do not, and cannot, know any other re ality which causes the movement of matter or resists move ment of any sort. The scientific world has accordingly fallen back upon this indisputable reality, and attributes to all change in the phenomena of the material world the same sort of effort which we know in consciousness. This is carrying back into nature what she has for so long been denied. The necessary implication is that all the movements of nature have behind them a personal power. That what we have been accustomed to look upon as enti ties, self-subsisting in the material world are, after all, in comprehensible except as the effort of a personal power, invisible but ever active. That all things in heaven and 6</page><page sequence="12">y? The Sewanee Review. earth are, after all, incomprehensible except as ordered and sustained by what in figure we call the " Hand of God." One of the greatest obstacles to the admission of per sonality in the Deity is what is called anthropomorphism. How can God have the form or characteristics of man? No doubt great harm has come of too careless use of the an thropomorphic element in speaking of the Deity. We can not, in the nature of things, see the Infinite and Absolute Personality, and we cannot picture to ourselves any like ness or similitude of the Lord of All Power and Might. Our human limitations shut us off from any possibility of forming in the mind any possible concept whose content shall be the Absolute Personality. It is impious and un scientific to attempt to tear away or peer through the limit ations which must ever bar us from the comprehension of the Inscrutable in the domain of the understanding ; but for all that, let us not fall back upon an equally impious and un scientific agnosticism ? under the delusion that we are as suming nothing. Our philosophy is shallow indeed if we fancy that the Infinite and Absolute can be construed by the use of concepts which exist only by virtue of limitations and relations, yet rightly directed and reflected must teach us that there are the same limitations in any attempt at an ul timate knowledge of the finite and relative ; and that in like sense we can no more know these than the other. The finite is meaningless apart from the necessary implication of the Infinite, and the relative could never have so much as the name, if the pre-supposition of the Absolute had not shot through and through what we call things and events. The learned physicist does not know, in a through-and through sense, what his blow-pipe or scalpel is, he does not know what water, air, or earth are ; he does not even know that they are at all, with the certainty with which he knows that the "thinker" is; so that if the theologian's knowl edge runs up into an unknown Infinite Person, his runs down into an Infinite Power, with the difference, if choice imist be made, clearly in favor of the Spiritual Absolute.</page><page sequence="13">The Personality of God. 99 The theologian does not know all about the One Good, but through the indisputable consciousness of a sense of obli gation, he does know something; and neither does the physicist know all about the material in his laboratory, and even what he does know has only a spiritual warrant for its reality. The agnostic has not so much warrant for re pudiating thought and purpose in the Infinite Cause of all things, as he has for repudiating absolute thing and event. The Greeks knew the impossibility of reconciling in the sphere of the understanding the eternal conflict between the limited and the unconditioned ; and when they asked, " How can the One be the many and the many One?" they proposed a problem which has obtruded itself upon the thought of men until this day, and will continue to con front us until God shall please to lift the veil that we may know Him as He is. Perhaps the greatest evil of our day is that a large, and that a vigorous-minded class of men have undertaken to smooth out the folds in the world's vesture, and, with the rush and whirl of an unbalanced science, trample out of the heart of man all sense of wonder, all thought of the Ineffable which moves him to be silent and adore. The great trouble is, perhaps, that to most minds infin ity means simply something very great, either in length, or volume, or power, or in minuteness, but still carrying with it some unit of comparison by which to estimate it. While in a popular way the word serves a very good purpose in this sense, this meaning cannot be allowed from a scientific point of view.1 The infinite is not a huge finite ; indeed, it is just what the finite is not. It is therefore a great mis take to suppose that one can followr (say) a line on and on, and so arrive at last at infinity. The infinite absolutely re fuses to be composed or made up by adding more and more, or by any process of reduplication. It cannot be approached, it is only to be reached (if that word can be used in this sense) per saltum; and the leap is just a? 1 Shoup's Mechanism and Personality\ p. 380.</page><page sequence="14">IOO The Sewanee Review. great, last as first. For example : Suppose we take a dis tance very great ? the distance to a very remote fixed star as a unit ? a distance requiring light a thousand years to tra verse it at a speed of two hundred thousand miles a second, and suppose that every millionth of an inch of that distance were suddenly expanded into a length equal to the whole, and all strung out together, it would still be just as far from infinite length as any one of those unexpanded fractions. Not the most infinitessimal step has been taken to pass the chasm which is not even reached until the finite has ceased to be. The infinite differs from the finite, not in degree, but in kind. It is "other" to it, and in final analysis can not be permitted to retain the remotest likeness. This may be illustrated very simply by the tangential function of an arc. The tangent grows at first with moder ate slowness from the origin, but with constantly increasing strides for equal increments of arc, until, when the arc ap proaches 90o, the lengths of the strides become each incon ceivably greater than the last ? greater than all the distance travelled from the origin, until, when the secant becomes nearly perpendicular to the initial diameter, the mind sinks under the overpowering sense of immensity ; but the arc is not yet 90o ; the mad flight goes on, and it is not until the last minutest difference of a difference of arc is passed, itself an impossible conception, not until the secant lets go its touch upon the tangent line and becomes parallel to it, that the function suddenly leaps the chasm which separates it from all finite values behind, and is, not becomes, infinite. It is not that in the last infinitessimal of arc added, there is added to the stupendous length already gained by the tan gent enough to make it infinite, for all that is zero in the presence of infinity, but that a world-wide change has taken place, and it has ceased to be what it was, the finite, and become what it was not, the infinite. If one rightly takes this in, one gains some faint notion of the incommensurable character of the infinite, and yet there is no point in the whole movement in which the same incompatibility of</page><page sequence="15">The Personality of God. IOI thought does not present itself. In all the operations of nature this marvellous truth assails us if we have but the eyes to see ? this passage from the finite to the infinite and back again?phenomena of change of any sort ? incompre hensible in thought, and yet ever taking place in fact. To think of the Personality of God we are compelled to use such concepts as we have, and they are all in the sphere of the relative and finite, but since we are compelled to think of what Mr. Spencer calls an "Inscrutable Exist ence ", " Cause which transcends our knowledge and con ception", an " Unknown All-being" we commonly do it in a bungling way by using the highest we know in man's ex istence, "mind" as a symbol of intelligence, "heart" as a token of love and sympathy, " hand " as an instrument of power, and if we take these and raise them until they pass our comprehension, and think of God as these and more be yond, we shall be guilty of anthropomorphism, it is true, but we shall be doing the best we can ; and if we humble our selves before the awful mystery of His being and adore Him in His incomprehensible love and majesty, we shall be in the way of becoming more like Him in mind and heart. We start with self and its self-activity ; we encounter the dead world of matter ; we find that all the postulates of sci ence find no ground for their reality without Personality as a deeper reality, and that science everywhere implies a per sonal ground of all things. In the moment of direst scepti cism the very consciousness of doubt carries with it the further and higher consciousness of self, as a necessary and precedent fact ; and unless we can arrive at such a stupend ous egoism as to hold one's self to be the sole and only reality subsisting in a sublime isolation of circumambient nothing ness, one must know that there are other personalities out of and beyond his own, and that the universe is meaningless and inconsequent, except under the postulate of an Infinite and Absolute Personality ? God over all. F. A. Shoup.</page></plain_text>
