<plain_text><page sequence="1">Atheism and Theism. By Errol E. Harris. (Tulane Studies in Philosophy, Vol. XXVI). Tulane University, 1977. XI and 157 pages. The purpose of this book is to demonstrate that the atheistic position is untenable and that it is possible to give "a rational interpretation of the main Christian doc- trine" (vii). Harris attempts to accomplish this purpose by starting with an examina- tion of the basis of the atheist's claim and moving to a discussion oi the Christian concept of God. In the last two chapters he discusses two topics central to Chris- tian doctrine: evil and the incarnation. There he brings to a conclusion the line of argument developed in the earlier part of the book. According to Harris, the adoption of either theism or atheism must be justified. A careful examination of the grounds on which leading atheists, such as Nietzsche, Marx, Engels, Freud, and Sartre, base their arguments reveals that atheism has no scientific grounding and is a matter of faith just as is theism. Yet, atheism per- forms a positive function, the criticism of unjustified elements in theism, such as bigotry and intolerance, superstition, and primitive anthropomorphism. But, the argument leads beyond the refutation of atheism and the admission of its con- structive value. While atheism is a good purgative for theism, Harris examines "the possibility of a theism supported by reason and demanded by the intellect in search of ultimate explanation" (p. 47). Avoiding Pascal's wager argument, Harris accepts Pascal's point that we must "... learn that man infinitely transcends man" and contends that to be aware of our own flniteness, we must presuppose a cri- teria of judgment "even if I am no explicitly aware of its complete and exact con- tents" (p. 52). If we recognize ourselves as incomplete (finite), we must presuppose a criterion of completion. And this completion would be absolute. From the acceptance of this understanding of man's self-transcendence Harris moves dia- lectically in an Hegelian manner to God, an "infinite, omniscient, self-conscious, spiritual being, actualizing the potencies of physical and biological nature, supra- personal in character and including in his single unity a multiplicity of spirits - a kingdom of ends, an integral union of all minds in one transcendent individuality" (p. 101). In the last two chapters Harris discusses the problem of evil and explicates the doctrine of the incarnation in the light of rational theism. Of particular interest is his answer to Blanshard's question in Reason and Belief , "How, then, can God be</page><page sequence="2">232 at once omnipotent and benevolent?" While Harris' handling of atheism is interesting and his discussion of Blanshard's question useful, little is new to those familiar with Hegel. Unfortunately, to those familiar with Bradley's work and his discussion of the place of terms and relation in self-transcendence, Harris' failure to answer Bradley is a serious and devastating omission.
