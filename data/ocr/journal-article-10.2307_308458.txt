<plain_text><page sequence="1">VAMPIRISM IN GOGOL'S SHORT FICTION Andrew Swensen, University of Wisconsin-Madison And aching pleasure nigh, turning to poison ... -Keats In expressing matters of the soul and of good and evil within the individual, writers often employ fantastic mythical characters to embody concepts or phenomena which in turn reflect complex qualities of the human spirit. Mythology and folklore abound in these sorts of characters (e.g. the Muses, the Furies, and so on), and to this vast collection of incarnations belongs a horrifying legendary figure known to virtually all cultures-the vampire. In the stories, "A Terrible Vengeance," "Vij," "Nevskij Pros- pect," and "The Portrait," Nikolaj Gogol' draws upon folkloric predeces- sors to create an ultimately literary vampire. His vampires form a literary motif of the demonic and thus express a distinct theme with their inherent symbolism; these fictive, grotesque, anthropomorphic characters exist as a personification of a diabolic evil ever present in society. In the early stories Gogol' exhibits greater dependence on folklore structures-especially plot, setting, and narrative voice; but as his writing evolves, the thematic content remains while structures such as setting and characterization assimi- late the immediate realia of Gogol's reading audience. Moreover, Gogol' concentrates not so much on the vampire itself, but rather on its human prey. The relationship between vampire and victim focusses on the pres- ence of alluring, deadly evil in the world and the individual's confrontation with it. The casting of four relevant character types-the sorcerer, the sorceress, the prostitute, and the usurer-as literary vampires allows the reader to appreciate the consistent rendering of a symbolic form within the Gogolian mythical consciousness. Ernst Cassirer writes: [A] mere glance at the facts of mythical consciousness shows that it knows nothing of certain distinctions which seem absolutely necessary to empirical-scientific thinking. Above all, it lacks any fixed dividing line between mere "representation" and "real" perception, between wish and fulfillment, between image and thing .... In all mythical action a true substantiation is effected at some moment; the subject of the action is transformed into a god or a demon whom it represents. (36, 38) Just as Athena is Wisdom and Aphrodite is Beauty, the vampire is an entity of a mythical consciousness; the vampire not only represents but immedi- SEEJ, Vol. 37, No. 4 (1993): p. 490-p. 509 490</page><page sequence="2">Vampirism in Gogol's Short Fiction 491 ately is a certain suprasensible abstraction. Substantiation of this assertion requires, first, the establishment of a particular mythical consciousness, the Gogolian milieu, and then the explication of the nature of the vampire in it-in Cassirer's language, the "subject of the action" which is transformed into this demon. In his explication of symbolic forms, Cassirer deliberately distinguishes between myth and art, and this distinction underscores the literariness of the works in question. A culture's mythic consciousness does not distin- guish between the actual and the mythical because the myth is reality for that particular society. Thus, for example, the Ukrainian and Russian peo- ples in fact believed in the sorcerers, witches, and demons of their folk traditions. In Gogol's works, however, the magical motifs and characters are part of the suspension of disbelief; therefore, the reader believes in them within the confines of the text, and the protagonists interact with them as part of the literary mythical action. Yet the reader can withdraw to a point of objectivity and then perceive the symbolic rendering of the given abstraction. This concept distinguishes literature of the fantastic and gro- tesque from folklore, and in terms directly applicable to Gogol', it eluci- dates the relationship between what the German tradition terms the Volksmiirchen (folk tale) and the Kunstmiirchen (art tale). Ample scholarship has discussed and substantiated Gogol's strong rela- tionship with the fantastic of Romanticism and especially with the Kunst- mirchen (most notably, Erlich, Fanger, Gippius, and Holquist). Gogol', of course, began his literary career during the height of Romanticism, during which the genre of the Kunstmarchen emerged. The Kunstmarchen adapted the typical motifs and, more importantly, the supernatural ambience of folk tales into high literature, and this genre, second in importance only to the lyric in German Romanticism (Rodger), reached its apogee particularly in the tales of Tieck and Hoffmann. As Trainer writes, the Kunstmdrchen "attracted the early Romanticists in particular as a medium for expressing their lively belief in the existence of the supernatural in the midst of reality," and it is characterized by a "juxtaposition of a subjective world of reality and an imaginative world of supernatural fantasy" and a "potential for abstrac- tion and illusion" (97, 100). Otokar Fischer further discusses the influence of dreams on Hoffmann's creation and his striving for the conflation of the waking and the dream states (40); thus the Kunstmirchen also subsumes a question of the conscious and the unconscious. The genre ultimately adopts its own Mdrchenlogik which constitutes a mythical reason within the parame- ters of the author's created mythos (Martini 163). Hoffmann and the Kunstmdrchen enjoyed considerable popularity in Russia during Gogol's time (Passage),' and the success of Hoffmann and the Kunstmiirchen in transforming the folk tale influenced Gogol's efforts to do the same (Erlich 30ff). What is at issue, as Fanger and Holquist</page><page sequence="3">492 Slavic and East European Journal rightly point out, is not Gogol's direct borrowing of western witches, de- mons, or vampires per se but rather the adopting of the Miirchenlogik; and precisely this supra-real mythical "logic" links the four tales named earlier and permits Gogol' to create his own literary fantastic, distinct from but dependent on the European literary fantastic and Slavic folklore. Holquist writes: A kind of progression becomes apparent, at any rate, which is easily overlooked by critics who see the Dikanka stories as folkish, or "romantic," thus opposed to the urban, "realistic" St. Petersburg tales. This progression is one in which the conventions of the Kunstmiirchen, fantasy by the book, according to rules, becomes gradually transformed by Gogol into a grammar of devices tailored to the demands of his own vision. (353) Another important influence for Gogol' came from the general literary trend which turned the attention of writers to the dark side of the soul and society. In his essays on Russian freneticism,2 Robert Busch compares Gogol' with the French &amp;cole frenetique and uncovers several social and literary factors which helped shape this school and influenced Gogol'. Both portrayed evil human behavior in graphically demonic terms, and in classifying freneticism Busch identifies "the demonic and grotesque in characterization" ("Gogol" 28). The freneticists contorted characters into malevolent destroyers, or as Busch goes on to say, they engaged in "the 'monsterizing' of characters." A comment by James Twitchell shows that this trend occurred throughout western literature. Writing about the vampirism in Poe (who, like Gogol', was born in 1809), Twitchell states, "For here in the 1830's was the first generation to find in its newspapers that life indeed did imitate art" (59). Thus, although the direct influence of contemporaries (Maturin, Hoffmann, Tieck, Balzac) on Gogol' remains unclear,3 the literary forces which inspired them would have likewise affected Gogol' who began his literary aspirations as a Romantic ("Hans Kiichelgarten"), matured in his demonism in concert with the literary zeitgeist, and created his own diabolic Miirchenwelt wherein the vampire might dwell. Proceeding from the establishment of the world of the fantastic, one may confront the task of defining the Gogolian vampire both as an entity incor- porating Slavic folklore into a russified Kunstmarchen and as a symbol consonant with literary tenets of the period. In literary studies on vampir- ism (Carter, Twitchell, and Praz), definitions tend to vary, but one common- ality is that vampires are killers who physically or psychically drain the life from human victims, a fact true in all of these tales of Gogol'. The tradi- tional image of bloodsucking acts as a metaphor for tapping into human essence; the vampiric drawing of this essence produces sustenance and, generally, diabolic revelry for the vampire and results in the loss of some or, more frequently, all of the victim's life energy. The vampiric act may represent an extremely sensual and quite possibly sexual experience for</page><page sequence="4">Vampirism in Gogol's Short Fiction 493 both vampire and victim. In three of the Gogol' tales, the vampiristic sexual overtones are present, and in the fourth, "The Portrait," a second id desire, greed, effectively supplants carnal lust. In sum, one primary feature identifies the vampire, not only as a character but more importantly as a theme, and this trait will serve as a definition in identifying the demonic character of Gogol's stories as part of the vampire myth: a vampire is a demonic being which feeds on human life and destroys that life in securing its own existence.4 Gogol' does employ other traditionally vampiric characteristics in creat- ing his villains. The vampire is primarily nocturnal, and night underscores the dark tone and infernal character intrinsic to the vampire motif. The vampire may transform and corrupt its victim with its "bite" (Carter)5 thus propagating more of its own kind to carry on the pattern of corruption and destruction. The vampire comprises a corporeal but supernatural entity, a perhaps immortal daemon which nonetheless dwells specifically in objec- tive "reality." Most importantly, the vampire psychologically manipulates, enchants, hypnotizes, and seduces its victims and generally overcomes them by enticement rather than by the use of brute force, and this facet of the vampiric relationship augments the aura of sexuality and primal desire. Gogol' therefore often uses the vampire as seducer to represent diabolic temptation and the deceitful beauty which may hide evil. With each of its potentially defining characteristics, the vampire covers thematic ground; each fantastic vampiric act comments on very real human behavior. The vampire of Russian folklore (ynbIpb, BaMnHp, and BypaJIaaK) bears the basic characteristics of the reanimated corpse which sucks blood; or the Slavic vampire may enchant a victim with its eye(s), ultimately resulting in the victim's death. Interestingly, the vampire appears to occupy a more important role in Ukraine; several scholars consider the Ukrainian folk beliefs about vampires to be stronger and more significant than those of most other world cultures (Moszynski 185 and Summers 288). Jan Machal describes Slavic vampires as "deceased people who in their lifetime had been sorcerers, bad characters, or murderers, and whose bodies are now occupied by an unclean spirit" (24) and later, he writes, "They assume every sort of shape and suck the blood of people, whom thus they gradually destroy" (25). Felix Oinas raises two relevant points about Russian beliefs on vampires. Russian folklore at times associates vampirism with heresy, and thus the vampire assumes religious, or perhaps better, sacrilegious significance. The association goes so far that the words epemuc and epemulta may signify not only a heretic of a 'generic' nature but specifically a "vampire" who possesses an incorruptible body (Oinas 436, 437); indeed, the terms also may refer to a "person engaged in black magic" (435). This linguistic development, as Oinas indicates, reflects the general folkloric concrescence of the vampire and sorcerer/witch (436). Secondly, Oinas</page><page sequence="5">494 Slavic and East European Journal develops the motif of the vampire's eyes which remain open, drawing an unwitting viewer into the grave of a epemut4a or may become disembodied to follow a victim until the victim "withers away" (435). Gogol's correspondence with his mother about Ukrainian folk customs during the writing of the Dikan'ka cycle (April 30, 1829 and February 2, 1830), his relationship with the folklorist MaksimoviC, and his article "On the Folk Songs of Little Russia" demonstrate his active desire to cultivate and exploit his knowledge of folklore, but as has often been observed, Gogol' employs folk idioms according to his own needs and largely without regard for consistency with their source. Establishing direct correspondence ultimately leads to a frustrating uncertainty (the best example being the Vij6), and the most productive reading occurs in appreciating the panoply of blended folk motifs as reflective of the "art" in Gogol's "art tale." A cata- logue of vampiric folk motifs found in Gogol' includes the eating of corpses (see "YnbIpb" in Afanas'ev's compendium of skazki and Perkowski's com- mentary on it, 121), the enchanting power of the eyes, the sucking of blood, and vampires as reanimated sorcerers, criminals, and heretics ("impure" souls). This religious overtone, the heresy indicated in the Oinas research, applies to the Gogolian vampire as he portrays his vampires as spiritual corrupters inducing sin, and direct associations are frequently made within the stories themselves between Gogol's vampires and the devil. Thus, al- though Gogol' does not borrow a vampire directly from Slavic folklore, he does endow his characters with qualities from this tradition. During the era of Romanticism, the vampire made the definitive step from folklore to high literature (Twitchell and Carter). Vampires appeared in po- etry and prose throughout Europe, and although they resembled folkloric vampires in supernatural and demonic qualities, the Romantics often used the vampire to express something esoteric or profound. On the Romantic (and chiefly British) vampire, James Twitchell offers a commentary perti- nent to Gogol' as he identifies "the psychological use of this mythic figure as an analogy to explain human interactions" and notes that "the myth was also often used in serious attempts to express various relationships" (4). In his analyses, Twitchell's criteria of vampirism essentially relies on the psycho- logical, and he uses terms such as "destructive energy" (25) and "the inter- change of energy" (190). He writes, "The Romantics really did not care about vampires; in fact, they rarely if ever wrote about vampires as vam- pires; instead, the vampire was the means to achieve various ends" (38). Moreover, as Romanticism waned, the "realistic" grotesque (such as that of freneticism) expanded, and this transition occurred in Russian literature ex- actly as Gogol' was writing (Busch and Kayser 123). Gogol' has gained much renown for his demonistic portrayal of nolunocTb (Mere'kovskij 57ff), and this freneticist facet of Gogol' assumes progressively greater significance as his vampire evolves from the sorcerer of a nebulous, Ukrainian past ("Ven-</page><page sequence="6">Vampirism in Gogol's Short Fiction 495 geance") to a sorceress existing in a contemporary temporal setting but still residing in rural Ukraine ("Vij"), and finally to a nefarious denizen of the immediately 'real' streets of contemporary Petersburg ("Nevskij" and "Por- trait"). The most significant aspect which binds the Gogolian vampiric act with the contemporary literary atmosphere, as opposed to the folklore tradi- tion, is the element of tragic resolution. Erna Pomeranceva writes, "HpexQe acero B BonIme6Ho cKa3Ke Mbl HaXOJiHM npeJcTaIsneHH HapoAa o Ao6pe, o npaBAe, o cnpaBeaJnmuocTu, o KpacoTe, onpeAeniouorue MopaJn BoJme6nHoi cKa3KH, xapaKTep ee HonoJ0 TenibHoro repoq. )Jo6po B cKa3Ke Bcera Top)KeCTByIOT HaJ 3JIOM" (62; see also Wosien). Quite the opposite is true of Gogol's magic and heroes, and all the protagonists ultimately yield to the wiles of evil and perish in a tragic victory of evil over good. A second feature which lifts these tales beyond folklore is the matter of character psy- chology. Wosien writes that "internal psychological conflicts do not exist" in folk tales (155); by contrast Gogol's protagonists, particularly Piskarev and Cartkov, exhibit the substantial internal conflict and psychological transfor- mation characteristic of a Kunstmairchen protagonist, such as Hoffmann's Anselmus and Nathaneal. In "The Terrible Vengeance" the vampire appears in the character of the sorcerer and exhibits a number of distinctly folkloric characteristics. Ac- cording to Slavic folk beliefs, his status as sorcerer makes him an ideal candidate for vampirism. Aleksandr Afanas'ev writes, "Vampires are very closely related to sorcerers (BseyH), witches (seAbMa), and werewolves (o60poTeHb)" (160), and the spirit of a dead sorcerer is believed to be reanimated in the guise of a vampire (Afanas'ev; see also Oinas 433). A better translation for o6opomeHb would be "shape-shifter" (the o6opoTeHb does not exclusively transform into a wolf), and this understanding of the word shows its greater relevance to "A Terrible Vengeance" wherein the sorcerer frequently exhibits polymorphism. In the opening scene, the sor- cerer experiences several metamorphoses, including the growth of a fang, before returning to his true state. The fact that the sorcerer is immediately overcome with these convulsive mutations upon the appearance of an icon to which "HHUKaKaM HeqIHCTaM crma He nocMeeT nppHKOCHyTbCM" illustrates his heretical and demonic nature. Other more subtle behaviors mark the sorcerer as a demonic-vampiric figure. He is essentially a nocturnal individual who prowls while the family sleeps, and the sorcerer's apparent lack of need for sleep implies that he is an unnatural incarnation. The most significant events occur at night, the time when evil spirits emerge, and this choice of setting emphasizes the tonal darkness of the work as a whole. Moreover, he eats little but rather frequently sips a mysterious black liquid from a flask. Such behavior in Gogol's world of many feasts seems strikingly incongruous and again sug- gests something inhuman; the sorcerer's sustenance belongs to a different</page><page sequence="7">496 Slavic and East European Journal order. During his capture, he reveals that his fetters and the walls of his cell do not confine him as he clouded the vision of his captors with a magical "mist," but the strange and holy alchemy of the cell walls defy him. Thus, although he can elude physical strictures, he has no power against sacred structures. This scene echoes the common image of the vampire recoiling from a crucifix or holy water. Romanticism also had a share in the shaping of this character. Like the stereotypical late Romantic hero, the sorcerer conceals a mysterious past and spends the majority of his time in isolation. His acerbic disposition conveys a cynical world view, and he displays a haughty and disdainful pride. Like the classic Romantic vampire (Carter, Praz, and Twitchell), the sorcerer possesses the Byronic qualities of alienation and solipsism. In a more Gogolian vein, the suggestion appears that the sorcerer has spent at least part of his time among the Turks, evidenced by his Turkish pistol, and the semiotic linkage with this nation comprises an association with heresy from the Russian Orthodox perspective. The casting of the sorcerer and the use of folk elements allow Gogol' to fulfill the principal thematic aspects of the vampire motif. The sorcerer plays the role of the diabolic tempter in his pursuit of the sexual favors of his daughter. The Slavic, especially Ukrainian, vampires show a frequent propensity or need to choose their own family members as their first vic- tims (Moszynski 180). His sexual preoccupation follows the vampiric model, and the incestuous nature of this pursuit amplifies the unnatural- ness and unholiness of his character. In the sorcerer's summoning of his daughter's soul while she dreams, Gogol' specifically draws on a folk belief to elaborate on his theme. The idea that the soul wandered while the body slept was common in Slavic folk belief (Machal 21), and the summoning of this nocturnal shade of an individual by the habitually nocturnal and de- monic sorcerer reflects both his supernatural abilities and his evil inten- tions. Furthermore, Katerina's nighttime visions demonstrate the character- istic ability of the vampire to obsess the victim with its image as part of the seduction. Like Mina, the quarry of Stoker's Dracula, Katerina cannot escape the vampire's visage in the dark and ethereal realm of fantastic dreams and nightmares, the realm of the literary demonic grotesque. As the obsession develops and deepens, Katerina's father eventually lures her into freeing him from his incarceration, and in so doing, he exhibits a seductive power of persuasion which suggests a sexual and supernatural enchantment. Gogol' also includes the "undead" element of vampirism in "The Terri- ble Vengeance." The sorcerer of course belongs to a cursed lineage, and his ancestors occasionally rise from their graves to moan their haunting la- ment, "JIymHO! JyUIHO!" The reanimated dead do not wander and terror- ize the living, but they do in the end consume the flesh of the sorcerer</page><page sequence="8">Vampirism in Gogol's Short Fiction 497 himself. More importantly, they remind the reader of the undying nature of the curse and those who bear it. Returning to the vampire as motif, one notes that its undead status acts as a metaphor; thus, the spirit or idea of vampirism comprises that which is truly "undead." Writing on "The Terri- ble Vengeance," Zolotusskij states, "14 3a OJHHM rpelUHHKOM T5IHeTC5I Iqenb rpetUHHKOB; TAHeTCA BeCb poA rpexa-OT MepTBeLIOB; JIe)amUHX B Morunax; Ao HBymero eme KOnayHa" (135). Thus, the evil which stems from the original crime has spanned centuries, and the sin itself manifests undying evil on earth. Lastly, the sorcerer fulfills the most significant role of the vampire as he destroys the lives of all that he touches. He kills repeatedly, without re- morse or hesitation. In the case of Danilo and Katerina, his central victims, the vampire destroys their lives and world in stages. He torments both, brings ruin on their home, and finally takes their lives, and, as his evil desires revolve around Katerina, she suffers the most and loses her sanity before her father completes his treacherous deed. The vampire has crushed both her world and her being in a ruthless scheme of progressive destruc- tion. Furthermore, although the sorcerer-vampire meets his own doom, it comes at the hands of the undead ancestors who feed on his body, a graphic scene rife with explicitly vampiric imagery and reminiscent of the ghoulish ynblpb in Afanas'ev's tale bearing that name. The vampire of "Vij" resembles the sorcerer on many levels, but Gogol' here makes his most significant use of vampiric folk idioms and veers away from the Gothic qualities seen in "The Terrible Vengeance." The "BseAga" of "Vij" has the same powers as the o6opomeHb and is a nocturnal being who cavorts with the various demons of the night. Only in this story does a Gogolian vampire engage in actual bloodsucking, and she chooses a child as her victim: "OHa CXBaTHIa RHIT3I; npocycmna eMy ropno H Haqa3ia nHHTb H3 Hero KpoBb" (II 204).7 This action coincides with another Slavic belief about vampires and their preference for children as victims (Afanas'ev 160). Other folklore motifs appear in the story-the hero's nighttime ride, the flying witch, Xoma's invocations; and the general attitude of the local residents and their reaction to the witch further underscore the general folkloric ambience of the tale as a whole. In a footnote, Gogol' even claims that the entire story lies rooted in Ukrainian folklore. However, for all of its folkloric elements and Gogol's protestations to the contrary, the story reflects an essentially modern literary style and content. Most importantly, like so many contemporaneous tales, "Vij" contains an educated hero from a civilized milieu who inadvertently ventures into a wild and mysterious netherworld full of frights and shocks. Beyond the superficial Gothic element, the background of Xoma shows an evolution in Gogol's portrayal of the vampire. Xoma is an urban figure and a common- place member of conventional society, an individual who might belong to</page><page sequence="9">498 Slavic and East European Journal Gogol's reading audience. Moreover, the contemporary temporal setting demonstrates that Gogol' has brought the vampire to the concrete present. Thus, although he sets the supernatural story in the countryside, Gogol' makes a clear effort to bring the demonic closer to the real experience of his reading public. More important than either the gothic or folkloric traits is the presence of Romantic figures, and the vampire of "Vij" comes from a classic Roman- tic type, the lamia. The lamia represents the quintessential Romantic fe- male vampire and becomes a "literal femme fatale" (Twitchell 40). Her greatest power lies in her almost irresistible seductiveness: the lamia capti- vates and virtually hypnotizes her prey (typically a man) with her enchant- ing beauty and leads him to destruction within her lair. Twitchell writes: It is this Lamia who became the prototype of the Romantic seductress, acquiring, as the myth developed, an appetite for young men whom she would lure into her cave with promises of love. . . . The myth had gained sufficient currency by the eighteenth century for the word "lamia" to have become a generic term for all female vampires. (40) Jan Perkowski considers the lamia to be a more threatening descendent of the mora or nightmare, a nocturnal feminine daemon pervasive throughout European folklore, and he rightly identifies the general overlapping of vari- ous types of female demons, most notably the succubus, incubus, and lamia. "Lilith, lamia, strix, incubus, and succubus all have three things in common. They threaten men's lives, they generate eroticism, and they attack at night" (70).8 The dynamic that Twitchell and Perkowski describe permeates "Vij," and a dark sexuality governs the relationship between Xoma and this vam- pire. The story regularly refers to his obsession with and attraction for this demonic seductress. During his first encounter with her, she approaches him with "some sort of unusual flicker" in her eyes, and although Xoma attempts to flee, he finds that his arms and legs will not obey his wishes. The enchant- ment is both supernatural and sexual, and both elemental attractions inca- pacitate Xoma's motor coordination. Finally, she takes him for their bla- tantly suggestive magical ride which the narrator describes in revealing terms. "OH qyBCTBOBaJI KaKOe-TO TOMHTeJIbHOe; HenpHHiTHOe I BMeCTe c.aadrKoe 'IyBCTBO; noacTynaBmee K ero cepaty" (II 186; emphasis added). The ambiguity of his feelings continues as the ride nears its conclusion: "OH syBcTBOBaJI 6ecoBcKH-CJIajKOe qyBcTBO, OH MyBCTBOBaJI KaKOe-TO TOMHTeJIbHO-CTpamHoe HacJIa)KeHCHe" (II 187). His seductress has begun to tempt Xoma with the wickedly sensuous "terrible pleasure." As the story progresses to Xoma's nighttime vigils, the vampire appears more beautiful than ever, but the effect of the beauty also seems more haunting and fearsome. He exclaims, "TaKaM cTpalUHaa cBepKaionIaI KpacoTa!" and later,, "Ho B ee sepTax HHriero He 6bUIO TycKJIOrO, MyTHOrO, yMepluero" (II 206). She is no loathsome and repulsive creature, but one of</page><page sequence="10">Vampirism in Gogol's Short Fiction 499 radiant and apparently divine beauty which fantastically defies death and appears inconsistent with the vile evil that the vampire represents. Thus, although Xoma realizes that she is dead, the "undead" lamia still exerts her supernatural power to enchant and seduce him with her beauty. This Romantic coalescence of exquisite beauty with the demonic trans- forms the vampire into a virtually irresistible tempter who is adroit in deception. Gippius refers to this coalescence as the "BTOpxeHHe JeMOHHmeCKOFO B npeKpacHoe" (49). Even if the demonic does not invade or encroach upon the beautiful as Gippius suggests, the demonic certainly does manipulate and invert the beautiful, for beauty becomes a scrim behind which the demonic operates. The tear of blood shed by the vampiric sorceress exemplifies this inversion9; this image of the diabolic grotesque bespeaks the unnatural and supernatural at play beneath the extraordinarily beautiful exterior. Knowing the power her beauty holds over Xoma, the lamia thus employs beauty as an instrument of destruc- tion which manipulates the individual by means of the individual's own desires. Xoma consciously recognizes the evil which surrounds the sorcer- ess, but her beauty-that is, his attraction to her beauty-overcomes his conscious and rational mind. It appeals to his irrational and hedonistic desires. Furthermore, developing this symbolism, Gogol' organizes the story so that Xoma encounters the sorceress only after dark, a trademark characteristic for the vampire as well supernatural evil in general. The vampire exercises dominion over the night, for the night draws a mist over the evil but still allows the "shining beauty" to reach into Xoma's psyche. The night allows for the emergence of these concealed carnal desires. As Erlich writes, Xoma "is Everyman" (67), and here he repre- sents the individual who experiences such fantasies and desires within. Submission to passions excited by the lamia constitutes her sustenance and the "blood" on which she feeds. Commenting on "Vij," Zolotusskij writes, "Fje cTpaCTb; TaM H KpOBb" (175). The lamia cannot seize her victory, but rather the victim, Xoma, must yield to her in yielding to tempta- tion within her lair and domain. The death, or rather, yielding of life begins with her plea for his vigil, and as in the case of Katerina, the sapping of Xoma's life spans a period of time as he performs the vigil, repulsed and attracted by the sorceress' terrible beauty. As the lamia rages and storms through the church, Xoma perseveres, and although taxed by the vampire's assaults, he manages to survive for as long as he resists temptation. As his will to resist the vampire wanes, he grows grey and his unnatural aging symbolizes the life flowing from him. Finally, Xoma fights the temptation to look as the Vij enters, but desire overcomes him. In looking he has violated the sanctuary provided by his magic circle, and as Stilman writes, he has lost "his chance for salvation" (377). In so doing, "Everyman" relinquishes his life to the vampire-seductress.</page><page sequence="11">500 Slavic and East European Journal In "Nevskij Prospect" Gogol' dispenses with the last remnants of the obvious folkloric trappings, and the work contains no overt supernatural elements or events. His story has neither the remote setting nor a distant time frame. The narrative begins and ends with the image of Petersburg and its central thoroughfare which his readership would have known per- sonally. Likewise, the characters all belong to the urban milieu and repre- sent social types. Nevertheless, Gogol' has not dispensed with the Kunstmiirchen, the fantas- tic, or the vampire, and, in the words of Erlich, Gogol' writes "an ominously cautionary tale for the befuddled denizens of a seedily metropolitan universe where it is too late for miracles, but, unfortunately, not too late for black magic" (81). This piece is indeed closer to the works of Hoffmann, precisely because of Gogol's decision to set the story in the city, much as Hoffmann first placed the Kunstmiirchen on the streets of Berlin and Dresden (see Walzel 250 and Trainer 116). Moreover, one could transpose the subtitle from Hoffmann's "The Golden Pot," Miirchen aus der neuen Zeit onto Go- gol's analogous creation. To establish this tale as a Kunstmdrchen requires a consideration of the milieu as described by the narrator, the fantastic sur- rounding the experience of the protagonist, and the composition of the vampiric figure who provokes the protagonist's demise. The opening passage alerts the reader to the enormous significance borne by the fantastic in the story as a whole, and the description of the activity on the boulevard, resounding with the fantastic and unreal, draws the reader and the narrative into the fantastic framework, the fantastic microcosm of Nevskij Prospect. The narrator describes the typical and superficially unremarkable daily traffic in fantastic figures of metonymy and with the rich imagery of constant motion, cacophony, and variegated colors. Gogol' creates another pandemoniac festival of demons but the faces have changed; instead of the leather-winged homunculi of "Vij," now appear apparently disembodied whiskers rushing by, the fluttering balloons of the young girls' sleeves, and a chaos of sound. "KaKa G6bIcTpaM coBepmaewcH Ha HeM baHmacMta2opua B TeieHHie OJHOFO TOJIbKO AHR! CKOJIbKO BbITepHHT OH nepeMeH B TeqeHHIe OAHHX CyTOK!" (III 10; empha- sis added). Indeed, Nevskij Prospect embraces a phantasmagoria in the literal sense of the word: a throng of phantoms. In writing about the gro- tesque of this period, Wolfgang Kayser makes a relevant and insightful observation: The "grotesque ball," with its total alienation and chaotic dissolution, offers a frequently recurring theme in the history of the grotesque and is closely related to that of the city in the process of alienation and dissolution. (116) The "phantasmagoria" of Nevskij Prospect, particularly as day gives way to night, represents just such a grotesque ball. The city transforms into an</page><page sequence="12">Vampirism in Gogol's Short Fiction 501 absolute Miirchenwelt which lacks "any kind of fixity. As a geographical entity it disappears; or rather, in its odd unlikeness of itself, the city be- comes a country of the mind" (Holquist 360). As night descends and the energy of this "grotesque ball" waxes, the vampire motif begins to unfold. As in "Vij," the vampire of "Nevskij Prospect" is a lamia. She possesses extraordinary beauty which instantly enchants and captures the artist, Piskarev, and in keeping with the motif, the prostitute entices the artist into her lair. The suggested magical quality to this sequence emerges in his "flight" through the streets of Petersburg, and, significantly, Gogol' describes the scene in terms which closely corre- spond to Xoma's night ride in his first encounter with the sorceress: "TpoTyap HeccH HOXa HHM, KapeTbI co CKaqymIHMHI JIoma1HhMH Ka3aJIHCb HeJIBH)KHMbI, MOCT paCTIrHBaJic5I H JIOManc1CI Ha CBoeHf apKe, J.OM CTOIJI KpbImeIo BHH3, 6yAKa BJanHJIaCb K HeMy HaBcTpeIy .. ." (III 16). In the concrete and elemental details of the prostitute's life, the reader discovers the nefarious nature concealed by the beauty. Within her apart- ment, the settled dust, the disarray, and the darkness bear echoes of ne- glect, decay, and death. To see into this native environment is to have the facade of the beauty removed, and this lair sees neither activity nor life. Events transpire only during the night, a setting with sinister overtones and coloration. Moreover, the prostitute's speech defies her goddess-like beau- ty and displays her true qualities, now amidst darkly comic vulgarity and baseness. In the first encounter between Piskarev and the prostitute in the apartment, the suspense mounts as the two look at one another silently and Piskarev's heart races. Yet the suspense and romantic climax of the mo- ment dissolves in the twinkling of an eye-precisely at the moment when she opens her delightful lips: "[OHa] cTaia rOBoprHTb WTO-TO, HO Bce 3TO 6bIno TaK rJIyno, TaK nomuno..." (III 21). Even more evocative and indicative of the demonism in her beauty is the narrator's description of her, where he observes that an "infernal spirit" "yearns to destroy the harmony of life," an explicit statement of the mythical symbolism inherent to the lamia.

(III 22) Despite the revelation of the dark side of the Nevskij beauty, she continues to enchant ("OKOJIjOBaTb") the "poor Piskarev." The vampire/lamia has corrupted the purity and harmony of beauty, or perhaps, as night is the inversion of day, nocturnal beauty constitutes a tool for demonic seduction. The pairs of antitheses-night/day, pure beauty/corrupt(ing) beauty- further develop in the antithesis of the alternating consciousness and de-</page><page sequence="13">502 Slavic and East European Journal lirium of Piskarev's decline, and the protagonist's vacillations between waking and sleep, lucidity and delusion confirm the altered conscious- ness of the Miirchen. Indeed, that Piskarev is an artist and a frequenter of the dream state strongly indicates his connection with the Hoff- mannesque hero and Hoffmann's Miirchenlogik; Botnikova writes, "HIncKapeB--poAHOi 6paT MeIwTaTeen AHceIMa" (127). Yet as Botni- kova repeatedly points out (in concert with Gippius), Gogol' inverts the Hoffmannesque artistic sensibility as ultimately destructive, and while conscious, Piskarev attempts to flee once he has discovered the true nature of this vampiric figure, but he cannot. The conjunction of the waking and dream states reach a point of complete inversion; "HaKOHeI CHOBHReHH5I cxAeJIaRJIHCb ero )KH3HHIO, H C 3TOFO BpeMeHH BC3I )KH3Hb ero npHHJIJa CTpaHHbIH o6opoT: OH, MO)KHO CKa3aTb, cnaJI Ha~By H 6oxpcTBOBaJI BO cHe" (III 28). The motif of haunted dreams and the vampire's manipulation of the sleeping hours returns for the third time in three stories, and in his sleep, Piskarev neither can nor desires to elude the phantom. He seeks her in the netherworld of dreams, and gradually his life essence ebbs. The evil spirits of his dreams lure him back into their realm to effect his final undoing. The lamia's beauty has enraptured him to the point of monomaniacal obsession. A host of absurd delusions about an illusory, idyllic future with the prostitute indicate that Piskarev has internalized the phantasmagoria as in essence an assembly of internal, psychological visions which deceive as do the shades of Nevskij Prospect. In an effort to seize this counterfeit ideal he returns to the apartment from which he fled earlier, but in actuality, he courts his doom. Upon his return, the now final touch of the vulgar, vampiric character is fatal, and Piskarev perishes. Thus, through his own volition, he has yielded himself to the force which has been sapping his life essence, and his actual cause of death extends the metaphor: he has cut his own throat and dies from a loss of blood. Reinforcing the Miirchenwelt paradigm, the narrator concludes by re- minding the readers that they have been in the world of diabolic prevarica- tion and illusion all along.

(III 45-6) The devil now haunts Nevskij Prospect, and in this "light" lit by him the prostitute acts as one of his minions and foils. In the final perspective, the prospect itself is the deceiving, seducing, and deadly vampire. Structurally, "The Portrait" combines the horrific supernatural elements of "The Terrible Vengeance" and "Vij" with the urban freneticism of</page><page sequence="14">Vampirism in Gogol's Short Fiction 503 "Nevskij Prospect." In the first version of the story, Gogol' employs his full repertoire of the horrifying demonic grotesquerie characteristic of the Dikanka and Mirgorod cycles. In this version, he even casts the usurer as the Antichrist, an appellation which Danilo used for the sorcerer in "The Terrible Vengeance."10 The supernatural assumes a more subdued, albeit still quite explicit, role in the second version, and the visible demonic features exist as agents and actions of evil as opposed to an actual manifesta- tion and incorporation of "The Evil One." "The Portrait" represents one of the strongest examples of Gogol's connection to the worldwide literary scene. Fanger states that "it draws on motifs, ideas, and structures to be found in Wackenroder, Hoffmann, Maturin ... and Balzac," and to this list Gippius further adds Washing- ton Irving and Spinello. Indeed a statement by Gippius reiterates the premise of the Gogolian Miirchenwelt as a literarily constructed mythical consciousness; writing on "The Portrait," he states, "TaK poMaHTRqeKaq nuiTepaTypHa3 TpaA~jIHgL B conpHKOCHyInac B 3TOH CHHTeTHIeCKOH IIOBeCTH c HacJIeJICTBeHHOH MH4OJIorHqecKOHi" (58). The premise of the story ex- emplifies the genre of the concatenation of the supernatural and the real: The usurer seeks to gain eternal, worldly existence through the rendering of his portrait. Speaking to the artist he has commissioned, he says, "5I He xo-y yMepeTb cOBepmeHHO, 1 xosy )KHITb," and he believes that if the artist accurately reproduces his visage, "X)H3Hb ero cBepXbeCTeCTBeHHOIO cHIJIOIO yJIepIKHTC B nopTpeTe, WTO OH qpe3 TO He ympeT cOBepmieHHO, ITO eMy Hy)KHO nHpHcyTCTBOBaTb B MHpe" (III 128-9). Through the machi- nations of some manner of infernal forces the resultant painting comprises no copy from nature but is "cTpaHHan )KIHBOCTb, KOTOpan 6bI o3apIHJIOCb JlHgo MepTBeLa, BCTaBIuero H3 MOrLHJIbI" (III 88). The portrait itself be- comes an undead daemon and a psychic vampire.11 The powerful seduction of this vampire lies partially in the allure of money which he most willingly parcels out. The narrator of the second part tells his audience that the usurer would lend any amount with a very fair rate of interest and payment schedule, and so initially he attracted many customers. Similarly, the spellbinding of Cartkov begins with the gold which mysteriously tumbles from within the portrait. From this initial, unimposing "touch" begins a progressive decline into madness for the vic- tims. In the tale of (artkov, his demise progresses as his lust for money increases, and the more he submits to the temptations of money, the closer he approaches the death of his artistic inspiration and the death of his spirit. Nevertheless, the usurer's greatest power to enrapture lies in his mysteriously gazing eyes. Throughout the story observers of the portrait immediately comment on the "living" eyes, and this repetition regularly reinforces the presence of their unnatural power. Like the beauty of the sorceress in "Vij," his eyes hypnotize a victim who may consciously recog-</page><page sequence="15">504 Slavic and East European Journal nize the evil lurking within, but who cannot resist their enticing stare. Hypnotism with the eyes is a common attribute of the vampire, and this motif evokes images of both the vampire qua epemuw (Oinas) and the frequent optical motifs found in Hoffmann, most particularly in "The Sand- man," where a protagonist is progressively driven insane.12 The eyes also symbolize the fantastic and dark powers of the night as they represent implacable portals to the dark nether realms. Thus, the artist perceives something unwordly in the usurer's loathsome eyes which he cannot com- prehend, and their wicked attraction leads him to fall into the abyss from which these eyes peer. Sylvie Richards, who also identifies the presence of psychic vampirism in this tale, writes that the eyes become the organ of the fantastic as they are the primary organ of perception (307), and in Gogol's motifs of optical illusion, tricks of the eye, fatal glares, and enchanting glances, the stare of the usurer appears as a culmination of vampiric ma- nipulation through the eyes. Consequently, like "Vij," "The Portrait" cap- tures both aspects of Gogol's concern with the power of vision: The active power of evil, supernatural elements to enchant and destroy with their eyes and the reactive victims who desire to look into the depths of evil. The vampire of "The Portrait" drains vital essence in the deadliest fash- ion of any of these villains and on a larger scale, and moreover, this vam- pire not only destroys but also transforms its victim into a new vampiric figure, an "offspring." The influence of the vampiric usurer grows exponen- tially as his victims encounter other individuals and fulfill evil intentions. Debtors become murderers and robbers, and Cartkov is transformed into a madman consumed with the desire to destroy masterpieces of art. The earlier victims destroy the life around them, and the artist destroys beauty (Gippius). The business of usury already implies vampirism in the mercan- tile, urban world, and the usurer has gained renown for mysteriously de- stroying life while simultaneously sapping the financial resources of the vulnerable poverty-stricken residents of Kolomna. The metaphorical im- age of physical sucking underscores the growing portrayal of vampirism, and indeed the vampiric portrait does want to suck the life out of tartkov: "14 BH)IHT OH: 3TO ye HHeCOH; qepTbI cTapHKRa BHHyJIHcb, H ry6bI ero CTanJI BbITArIHBaTbCA K HeMy, KaK 6yATo 6bi xoTeRJH ero 6btCOCamb ... (III 91; emphasis added). As for the vampirically transformed (Cartkov the narrator writes, "Ka3anocb, B HeM OJIHqeTBOpHJIICA TOT CTpallHbIHi )eMOH, KOTporO HIeaRJIbHO Hi306pa3Hin IyLIKKHH. KpoMe 3IIsOBHTOrO IH BeqHoro nopHIqarHbR HHIero He npOH3HOCHJI I ero ycTa" (III 115). The artist himself has become demonic, and the "venom" of his words suggests a lethal quality about him. In the artist's existence, his life is art and artistic inspiration, and in the transformation of his art, the reader sees the life slipping from him. Soon the quality and life of his art disappear, and his brush has grown "cold" and</page><page sequence="16">Vampirism in Gogol's Short Fiction 505 "dull". He loses his desire to create and falls into a monotonous pattern of repeating the same mediocre images countless times. As his riches grow, he falls deeper into this morass of mediocrity, and finally in explicitly morbid imagery, he becomes a "walking stony grave with a corpse in place of a heart." As Gogol' considers inspiration a spiritual experience, this death of inspiration signifies a death of spirit, and thus the lifelessness of his art parallels the spiritual lifelessness of i(artkov himself. Gogol's resonating death imagery in the above description of Cartkov underscores the fact of a spiritual execution perpetrated by the usurer. Once more, the vampire has undone an individual not by force but by demonic temptation. In part two, the reader finds the sole account of a survivor who has recovered from the usurer's fatal touch. Nevertheless, his story still sup- ports Gogol's theme for it emphasizes the role of temptation and demonic beguilement. The old artist who painted the fateful portrait began to fall just as did Cartkov, and his art becomes another instrument for the dark supernatural powers. In surviving the encounter with the vampire, he suc- ceeds through asceticism and denial of renown and gain. He does not vie with the vampire in the vampire's realm; rather, he withdraws from the city and from the night. His method is to defy all that the vampire represents by ultimately not yielding to the allure. A large portion of the significance of this survivor appears in its oddness and incongruity when compared to the experiences of other characters who encounter the vampire. In relation- ships with the vampire, survival is the anomaly and death the standard. In these four stories, the vampire motif exists in all of its dark and demonic aspects: the undead, the corrupter, the enticer, and the killer. In these tales of vampirism, Gogol' does not create men in black capes who leap from the shadows to plunge preternaturally long canine teeth into unsuspecting passers-by, as is the case of the twentieth-century understand- ing of the vampire. Gogol' has created his fantastic characters in the spirit of the Kunstmiirchen and freneticism in order to examine a dark element to the human condition. As the fantastic ultimately makes a statement about the reality of the individual, each of these characters reflects or elicits something entirely human. In Chapter 5 of "The Terrible Vengeance" Danilo tells Katerina, "You do not know one tenth of what your soul knows." To this larger metaphysical knowledge of the soul belongs the awareness of the spirits and their vampirism. The vampire is a daemon, both material and supernatural, and this fact symbolizes the permanent place occupied by corrupting evil within the actual world. In the dark evenings in Dikanka and Mirgorod, in the dark streets of Petersburg and on Nevskij Prospect where the demon lights the street lamps, the vampire eternally marks its dominion and stalks its victims. The vampire's deceiving and manipulative allure pervades these works, and the common trait which ultimately marks them as stories of vampirism</page><page sequence="17">506 Slavic and East European Journal lies in the draining of one individual's life by another figure or essence. Echoing the irrational element of knowledge of the soul, the attraction of diabolic finesse clouds judgment, obfuscates truth, and defies logic or rea- son, and the "terrible pleasure" and "the demonic-sweet feeling" emanating from the wickedly seductive vampire only grows and never wanes. The vampire may loom in any dark, mutable setting, and the vampire as fantastic metaphor looms above all in the ineffable abyss seen as one looks into the eye as window to the soul. In the final analysis, this characteristic under- scores the trademark modus operandi: The vampire operates through guile in the dark world of deceiving shadows where "all is not what it seems," and ultimately the matter of sin comes to the fore for sin rests not on the diabolic temptation itself but on the willfull human consent to such temptation. Vampirism will live as long as desires and the potential to yield to temptation exist within the human spirit, and consequently, the truest sign of the vam- pire appears as a pattern of destroyed lives. Thus, Gogol's vampire constitutes a grotesque portrait of something wholly human. The vampire as a grotesque manifestation of spiritual preda- tion, like all elements of the grotesque, portrays something intellectually incomprehensible and irrational but still known to the soul. In the words of Wolfgang Kayser, the grotesque is the invocation and exorcism of the demonic. In these four stories, Gogol' clearly invokes the demonic in the literary rendering of the vampire; the exorcism appears less defined and seems to rest principally in the reader's hand. NOTES 1 Charles Passage provides a very useful timetable of Hoffmann's works, the appearance of Russian translations of his works, and the appearance of original Hoffmannesque tales in Russian literature. 2 Busch classifies all of the stories discussed here as freneticist works. 3 Fanger writes, "His correspondence gives us little notion of his reading knowledge, tastes, or even specific awareness of literature in the forms he himself cultivated. As a result, these areas remain all but empty categories, among so many others in the Gogol phenomenon" (13). Certain definitive statements can be made about Gogol's familiarity with German and European literatures: He bought a collection of Schiller in 1827 (letter to his mother, April 6, 1827); he mentions Winckelmann, Goethe, and Tieck in "Hans Kiichelgarten" and mentions Kant, Schelling, Hegel, and Oken in the draft for a journal review; he wrote on Schl6zer, Miiller, Herder, Lessing, and Schiller (Herder as a poet, Lessing and Schiller as dramatists) in "Arabesques"; he asked V. N. Repnina for a volume of Hoffmann (letter 1838); and as an active member in the Russian literary community, he would certainly have read the :ukovskij translations of German ballads and the translations of Hoffmann appearing in Moskovskij Vestnik, Moskovskij Telegraf, Vestnik Evropy, and other publications of the time. The Academy edition of Gogol' mentions Wackenroder, Hoffmann, Maturin, and Balzac in association with "The Por- trait," and Gippius adds the names of Washington Irving and Spinello to this list. For a</page><page sequence="18">Vampirism in Gogol's Short Fiction 507 full index of Gogol's western European source materials, see H.B. Fozoiab: Mamepualabt u ucczaedoeaHui, pp. 37-41. 4 Although I arrived at this definition before the release of Jan Perkowski's most recent book (The Darkling), his definition of the "general vampire" is almost identical and corroborates the premise stated here. He defines the general vampire as "a being which derives sustenance from a victim, who is weakened by the experience" (56). 5 Carter includes propagation through the vampiric act as one of the defining characteris- tics of the vampire. Although this action may be a characteristic, the generation of new vampires often involves other magical means, and the feeding process may only result in the simple death of the victim. Admitting this behavior as one of the final defining qualities does not seem to be a productive approach for it excludes a large portion of what Perkowski, Afanas'ev, and Oinas discuss as vampirism. 6 Scholars have been trying to identify the Vij since the very composition of the story, but ultimately only conjecture is possible. Although considering the folkloric sources for the Ukrainian "king of the gnomes" is a productive endeavor, what we should focus on above all is Gogol's desire to emulate (if not directly reproduce) the phantasmagoria of Slavic folklore. For a very thorough catalogue of attempts to identify the Vij, see the introduc- tion to the Rancour-Laferriere article. 7 All quotations from Gogol' are marked by volume and page numbers and are taken from the IoanHoe co6panue coquHenuu. 8 In raising the issue of the lamia, I am assuming a particular taxonomy which distinguishes between the various demonic types mentioned here, but such traditions obviously exist in a state of flux, intermingling (pagan, Greek, Jewish, Latin and Christian traditions all being relevant), and evolution. The mora itself is the least threatening and least tangible of these types; Perkowski identifies it as an often amorphous spirit which excites sexual arousal during sleep, never kills, and leaves a ball of wool or hair when the victim attempts to seize it (a folkloric nedotykomka?) (Perkowski 68). The incubus and succubus are demons which engage their victims in sexual intercourse while the victim sleeps, the former typically with women and the latter typically with men. These demons seem to vary in terms of the threat they cause. The incubus, like the mora, is often associated with smothering a victim and lies on top (thus their name from incubare, to lie on) their victims. The succubus lies beneath the victim (succubare, to lie under); certain, presum- ably later, manifestations seem to associate the succubus with a fatal kiss; also, the Webster's and American Heritage dictionaries indicate that succuba came to denote "prostitute" in late Latin. The Lilith comes from the rabbinic tradition and represents far more than vampirism; Lilith is at times associated with witchcraft and with evil spirituality generally. The lamia, originally a Greek type, is specifically associated with vampirism, and as Twitchell notes, this word has come to denote the strongly sexual, female vampire. As it is the most appropriate for the literary typology established in this article, I have chosen to employ the term "lamia" for the female, vampiric characters in Gogol's stories. 9 The tear of blood from a corpse may relate to the folk belief that a murder victim cries blood tears when in the presence of the murderer (my thanks to Professor James Bailey for this observation). I would assume that Gogol' used this motif more as a literary device of supernatural coloration suggestive of the demonic rather than one deliberately imply- ing Xoma's role in the witch's death, but both notions are viable. 10 If we pursue the idea of the usurer as Antichrist, however, then he would fit more with a Mephistophelean paradigm than that of the vampire. That is, he would be the demon as opposed to a demon. Therefore, I am considering primarily the second version of the tale in this analysis. 11 The psychic vampire is a classic literary type identified by its capacity to drain emotional energy and life force from its victims. Perkowski writes that "their sustenance is psychic</page><page sequence="19">508 Slavic and East European Journal energy" (55). He continues by discussing the non-supernatural, psychological explanation of psychic vampirism as rooted in emotional manipulation. 12 For a discussion of optical motifs in Hoffmann, see Yvonne Holbeche. In light of her study and the ample material on motifs in Gogol', the possibilities for a compara- tive study of optical motifs and mutable visual imagery in Hoffmann and Gogol' are numerous.
