As with the  engraved assemblage, the aim was to identify broad scale patterns. These analyses explored both  motif depiction and technical variation. These results are compared with those achieved for the  engraving sites in chapter 11.   Quantitative analyses here again focused on motif combinations, not on qualitative  aspects of motif classes. The overall aim was to be able to compare the engraving and shelter art  assemblages - despite their technical differences.   The approach and methodology for both art components were detailed in chapter 11. The  classification system, original data and computer bivariate plots supporting the CA were provided  in the original thesis37 (McDonald 1994a: Appendices 1, 5, 6 and 7).   The CA results for both motif and technique are presented in terms of drainage basins. The  three different locations investigated with the engraving assemblages, were again subject to more  detailed analysis of the CA results.    The distribution of uncommon motifs is explored with this component also. Profile people,  culture heroes, items of material culture and complex-non-figurative (CXNF’s) appear to be good  indicators of localised cultural choices being made by pigment artists. Contact motifs are again  investigated (McDonald 2008).   As with the engraved component, small scale qualitative analyses of motif depiction and  preference were undertaken. To enable comparison between the two media, shields and culture  heroes were again the focus of this analysis.  Correspondence Analysis (CA): regional data, results and interpretation Basic statistical information about motif and technical information (i.e. average assemblage size,  motif frequencies, colour usage etc.) was presented in chapter 5. The multivariate technique (CA)  used here allows quantified statements  to be made about  the  regional homogeneity as well  as  demonstrating what variables distinguish sites (i.e. the sources of variance within the data base).   The same procedures were followed with this medium as were described previously for the  engraving assemblage. Motif variables were the same as those used for the engraving sites with  two additional motifs (Table 12.1).    Analysis  commenced  with  unmodified  count  information  (29  motif  variables).  This  taxonomy was then reduced to seven clumped taxa (Table 12.1) and the CA was run using binary  data. The CA of the shelter art’s technique variable comprised 546 sites, while the CA of motif  variables (which excluded sites with only unidentified motifs) involved 439 sites.  Motif The first two components account for 54.4% of the variance in the sample. The scree slope plot  (Wright 1992) demonstrates that the first two components describe considerable structure in the  data (Figure 12.1). The plot of these first two co-ordinates reveals that the data is discriminated  well by five of the seven variables (Figure 12.2a). Variables 1 and 4 are close to the origin and  37These are not included here as these represent many hundreds of pages of close-typed computer files. terra australis 27 292 </page> <page sequence="2"> Chapter 12: Regional synchronic variation: shelter art Table 12.1: Shelter Art sites: clumped motif play little part in distinguishing between the  variables used in correspondence Analysis. sites.

Unidentifiable motifs  have been excluded from this level of analysis.  The distribution of motif variables  on the graph is generally mirrored by the  1 distribution of sites (see Figure 12.2b).

Based on this analysis,  it can be stated that the shelter art component  is relatively homogeneous, with no major internal groupings.    Given the size of the data base, the usefulness of Figure 12.2b for detailed interpretation  is low. Thus, the results were again replotted using various subdivisions of the data. All sub- plots are based on exactly the same results, but the smaller sample sizes enable more detailed  interpretation.   The  data  were  first  subdivided  into  regional  sub-groups  which  could  be  interpreted  geographically. These groups were based on the AHIMS site identification number, which is in  turn based on map sheet location (Table 12.2, see Figure 136). Groups 1 - 7 are directly comparable  to the similarly numbered engraving Groups. Group 8 is to the west of Group 6 - an area where  no engraving sites are recorded.  While an arbitrary division of the sample, this method achieved good control was on  general east-west and north-south divisions in the data (McDonald 1985a). All bivariate plots  from the CA results were presented (McDonald 1994a: Appendix 6, Figures A6:17 - 26). These  are summarised here.

These  can  be  identified  in  the  bivariate plots by comparing the degree(s) of  homogeneity in each group, and by the presence  and distribution of outlier sites, relative to the  origin. The same technique was used for the  Figure 12.3: Quadrant identification used engraving assemblage. The number of sites  in interpreting the shelter art cA results. within  a  defined  and  consistent  radius  of  the  origin was noted38, the percentage of ‘common’  sites was calculated and outlier sites in each area  were identified. This was a necessary step given the disparate sample sizes.    The distribution of the outlier sites in particular quadrants (Figure 12.3) was investigated as  variations in this result across the region enable more specific statements on localised variability.  This analysis demonstrates the presence and nature of localised variability in assemblage content  across the region. Technique The technique classification was initially devised for the Rock Art Project (McDonald 1985a, and  see McDonald 1988a). It includes a combination of technique (variables 4-8, 16), form (variables  1-3, 9-11) and colour (variables 12-15: Table 5.4).  38The same consistent radius as used for the engraving sites was employed here. This has been drawn on each of the  bivariate plots as an heuristic device.  terra australis 27 294 </page> <page sequence="4"> Chapter 12: Regional synchronic variation: shelter art Table 12.3: Shelter Art sites: technique  Given the interdependence of some of  variables used in the cA. these 18 technical variables (i.e. a depictive  motif is described by a combination of  Variable No. Technique description all variables excluding #8); the technique  1 outline 2 infill/solid taxonomy was reduced to include only  3 outline and infill unlinked variables (Table 12.3).

A  significant  amount  of  the  variance  is  accounted for by the first component. The bivariate plot of the first two co-ordinates reveals good  discrimination between sites in the region (Figure 12.5).  1 0.9 figure 12.4: cA results Technique.  0.8 plot of the latent roots demonstrating  0.7 that the variance in the data set is  0.6 0.5 well accounted for by the first two  0.4 components. 0.3 0.2 0.1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 In the first component, variables 8, 12 and 13 (stencils, white pigment and yellow pigment) are  inversely related to variables 1, 3 and 12 (black pigment, outline and outline and infill motifs). In  the second co-ordinate, variable 16 (engravings) exhibits a strong positive value, while all other  variables have a weak negative value. Archaeologically, these results indicate that sites which  have large numbers of stencils and/or white pigment present are different to assemblages with  black outline and infilled motifs. This dichotomy between white stencils and black drawings is a  good summation of regional characteristics.    The  bivariate  plot  for  the  distribution  of  sites  (Figure  12.5b)  reveals  a  solid  clustering  around the origin with sites being pulled out along the first co-ordinate. The majority of sites in  the region are relatively homogeneous, but the variables used identify structure in the data and  hence sources of variability amongst the assemblages. The regional sample was again too large  to allow meaningful interpretation. Again, the results were replotted on the basis of the broad  geographic sub-divisions described above (see Table 12.3).  These CA results describe how sites vary according to technique across the region. The  relative homogeneity of the defined groups and the focus of each group’s outlier sites was again  the basis for interpreting varying levels of technical similarity/diversity. Regional Comparison Both motif and technique analyses indicate a core of more homogeneous sites in the centre-west  of the Sydney Basin (Figure 12.6 and Figure 136). This homogeneous (core) focus is not in the  same location that was found for the engraved assemblage. The sites from Groups 2 and 3 are the  terra australis 27 295 </page> <page sequence="5"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange figure 12.5:  cA results for  Technique.

Sites from Groups 1 and 5 and 6 (and the small sample in Group 7)  demonstrate considerable diversity in subject preference and techniques used.   And the technique variables reveal different levels of homogeneity than do the motif  variables. The variability demonstrated by technique variables is less than that demonstrated by  motif variables showing that there is a higher degree of technical homogeneity across the region  than there is similarity in subject preference.  Subtle differences between the sites in the different groups are shown by the outlier sites.  These indicate a preference in some areas of the Basin for hand stencilling (Groups 1, 2 and  5), while in other areas (Groups 3 and 6), the drawing of land animals in black pigment is most  common. Language Areas As was done with the engraving sites, the shelter art assemblages were divided into language  areas based on Capell’s boundaries (Figure 3.1).  terra australis 27 296 </page> <page sequence="6"> Chapter 12: Regional synchronic variation: shelter art figure 12.6: Shelter Art, motif. percentages of homogeneous shelter art sites in each  analytical group.  figure 12.7: Shelter Art, Technique. percentage of homogeneous shelter art sites in each  analytical group.  terra australis 27 297 </page> <page sequence="7"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange Motif and Technical Variation across the Basin Basic assemblage details (motif and technique) and the CA results are described for each of the  language areas.     Much of the shelter art assemblage is unidentifiable due to poor preservation, ad hoc drawing  activity,  superimpositionning and  the  requirements of  the classification  system. The  technique  variables  recorded  included unidentifiable motifs, which  results  in  a more  accurate  picture  of  technical ranges used across the region. Because of this, there is not always a correlation between  motif proportions and technique characteristics: i.e., while hands might dominate the identifiable  motifs, stencilling does not necessarily dominate in technique.  Darkingung Language Area This group of inland shelter art sites represents the largest sample in the region (190 sites). While  7,725 motifs were recorded here, only 4,972 motifs could be classified: 30% of the assemblage  comprises unidentified motifs. The largest recorded assemblages in the region are located here  (average 41 motifs/site) as are the two biggest known assemblages: Swinton’s with 857 motifs  and Yengo 1 with 505 motifs. The average site size is quite high (34 motifs/site) even if these two  sites are excluded.    The predominant motif is the hand (54%: Figure 12.8). The focus of the depictive motifs  (Figure 12.9) is on macropods (19%) followed by anthropomorphs (16%) and other land animals  (10%).  figure 12.8: Darkingung Language Area, Motif Assemblage (excluding unidentified  motifs). terra australis 27 298 </page> <page sequence="8"> Chapter 12: Regional synchronic variation: shelter art figure 12.9: darkingung language Area: depictive motifs.  The whale is the only motif category not represented here. Non gendered anthropomorphs are the  most commonly depicted human figures, followed by men and then women. Profile depictions  are fairly uncommon. Most of the pigment culture heroes are located in this area. Boomerangs  are the most commonly depicted material culture items. Despite the fact that hands dominate the  recognisable motifs here, dry pigment (drawing) is the most commonly employed technique.  Stencilling is common. Wet pigment (painting) is more common here than in any other language  area (Figure 12.10).   Infilled motifs are slightly more common than the other two forms although all three are  roughly equivalent (Figure 12.11).  The clear colour preference in this area is white pigment, followed by black, red and yellow  (Figure 12.12). figure 12.10: Darkingung language  Area.

In the northern area a  total of 1,297 motifs were recorded from 36 sites. Only 851 of these were recognisable (34.4%  unidentifiable). Average  site  size  here  is  quite  large  (36 motifs/site). Hand  stencils  (including  variations) dominate this assemblage (Figure 12.13).    ‘Other’ dominates the depictive motifs followed by birds and other land animals. Human  figures are again focused on non-gendered anthropomorphs, and there is a greater emphasis on  profile figures than in the Darkingung assemblage (Figure 12.14).   Two culture heroes (at two sites) are located in this area. Drawing is the most commonly  used  technique  followed  by  stencilling. The  other  technical  options  are  less  common  (Figure  12.15).    The three defined forms are relatively evenly distributed (Figure 12.16) with infilled motifs  slightly more common than the other two forms figure 12.13: Darug (North) Language Area.

Colour preference in this area is again for white pigment, followed by black, red and yellow  (Figure 12.17). Red is more common and white less dominant than in the Darkingung sample.   The southern Darug sample comprised 90 sites with 1,613 motifs. Only 722 of these were  recognisable (55.2% unidentified). The average site size here is 17.9 motifs/site.    Hands  again  dominate  but  less  so  than  in  the  preceding  groups  (Figure  12.18). Unlike  the northern Darug sample, the dominant depictive motifs are other land animals followed by  macropods and anthropomorphs. Culture heroes and women are present but extremely rare.  ‘Other material objects’ are the most commonly depicted material culture items, followed by  boomerangs (Figure 12.19).  Drawing is the most common technique. Stencilling is much less common, while the  remaining  technical options are uncommon or non-existent  (Figure 149). Technical variability  is much more limited in this Darug group compared with its northern counterpart. Outline and  infilled motifs are more common here than outline only motifs. Infilled forms are quite rare (Figure  12.21). figure 12.18: Darug (South) Language Area.

Guringai Language Area This sample represents the most northerly coastal group in the region. A total of 1,504 motifs were  recorded from 78 sites here. Just over 38% of this assemblage was unidentifiable; 930 motifs were  classifiable. The average site size here is 19.3 motifs/site, considerably smaller than the northern  inland groups.    Hands dominate this group (Figure 12.23), while fish and macropods are co-dominant in  the depictive assemblage (Figure 12.24). There are no culture heroes or profile people amongst  the anthropomorphic figures here. Boomerangs are the most frequently depicted material objects  followed by shields.    terra australis 27 302 </page> <page sequence="12"> Chapter 12: Regional synchronic variation: shelter art figure 12.23: Guringai language Area. motif Assemblage. figure 12.24: Guringai language Area. depictive motifs. Drawing and stencilling are co-dominant techniques (Figure 12.25). Painting is relatively common.

Sydney (Eora) Language Area This language group is located, south of the Guringai and Port Jackson and north of the Georges  River. This group has  the smallest sample size (five sites) because of  the focus  in  this area of  European settlement, and because of the Cumberland Plain.   A total of 65 motifs were recorded here (averaging 13 motifs/site). Relatively few of the  motifs (11%) were unidentifiable: 58 were recognisable.   Hand  stencils  dominate  this  assemblage, while  the  depictive  focus  is  on fish  and  other  marine animals (Figure 12.28, Figure 12.29). There is a much reduced motif classification for this  area probably as a result of sample size.  figure 12.28: Eora language Area. motif Assemblage. terra australis 27 304 </page> <page sequence="14"> Chapter 12: Regional synchronic variation: shelter art figure 12.29: Eora language Area. depictive motifs. Stencilling dominates this assemblage, with drawing the only other recorded technique (Figure  12.30). Small sample size again makes these observations tentative.  There is a preference for  outline motifs followed by outline and infilled forms. No infilled-only forms were recorded in this  area (Figure 12.31). The preferred colour in this area is white, followed by red, black and yellow  (Figure 12.32). figure 12.30: Eora  language Area.

Summary Pigment art assemblages in the Tharawal language area are clearly differentiated from all other  language areas by the relative absence of hand stencils. There is a predominance of black pigment  and scarcity of white pigment in this area, which further reinforces these differences.  All other  areas have varying levels of similarity and dissimilarity in their motif assemblages.   Despite their locations on the coast, there is no clear focus on marine animals in the  Guringai or the Tharawal areas. Several motif classes are ‘missing’ from the central area of the  Basin but present the northern and southern parts of the region. Profile people are common in the  Darkingung and northern Darug sites and the southern Darug and Tharawal sites. None of these  motifs are found in the Guringai or Sydney areas.   Viewing the Darug sites north and south of the Cumberland Plain separately revealed that  some bedrock design notions (Sackett 1990) transcend the geographic distance between these two  assemblages, while others do not. Both sets of Darug sites have a predominance of hand stencils  with other land animals, macropods and anthropomorphs dominating (compared with Tharawal  sites that have few hand stencils and are clearly dominated by macropods). Distance has created  some differences in assemblage characteristics between the two sets of Darug sites. Birds, ‘other’  and boomerang motifs dominate in the northern group, while these elements are less important in  the southern group. The schematic peculiarity of these southern sites (i.e. the use of four leg on  terrestrial animals and two legs on birds, cf. two and one used, respectively, to the north) occurs  in both the southern Darug and Tharawal sites, but not the northern Darug sites. This aspect has  not been investigated in detail here.    Unidentified motifs were used in this analysis because of the technical information they  provide. Without exception this category dominates all shelter art assemblages.   Colour usage in the different language areas reveals definite cultural preferences across the  region. This preference does not reflect availability of resources. Charcoal is universally available.  White pigment derives from pipeclay (kaolin) commonly found in creeklines around the region  and would require only a local knowledge to procure. Red and yellow pigments derive from  ironstone bedding within the sandstone formation. While requiring local knowledge to procure,  these colours are ubiquitous in their distribution.    In the south of the region there is a definite preference for black pigment and a lesser focus  on stencilling. In the north of the region there is a definite focus on white pigment. While this  reflects the dominance of stencilling, there are also large numbers of white drawings and paintings  in this area. This colour dominance supports a model of contact between the Hunter Valley (where  white is prevalent) and this part of the Sydney region (Moore 1981; and see the Mount Yengo  excavation report). terra australis 27 307 </page> <page sequence="17"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange  In the Guringai area, while black dominates, there is a much more use of red and white.  Red is commonly used for stencilling here as well as for drawing.   Yellow is only rarely used in all language areas, although it is used more frequently in  the Darkingung area. There are many sites with yellow stencils in this area, but relatively few  drawings and paintings (except in the Warre Warren area: McDonald 1988a).  correspondence Analysis, language Areas and drainage Basins While trends in the motif assemblages and technical options across the Basin are quite clear,  the CA results were used to interpret the significance of compositional differences and technical  emphases in the different areas. Language areas and internal drainage basins were analysed, first  for motif and then technique.   A total of 25 drainage basins with art sites were defined. The codes used here are the same  as those used for the engraved assemblage (Table 12.4 and Table 12.5). The sample sizes here  vary markedly compared with the engraved component. The largest sample of shelter sites derives  from the Darkingung  language area. This distribution reflects  the work done  in  the Mangrove  Creek Catchment (Attenbrow 1981, 1987, Gunn 1979, McDonald 1988a) and more broadly for  the Rock Art Project (McDonald 1987, 1990a).

Shelter Art Motifs The CA sample for the motif analysis comprised 469 sites. Sites with only unidentifiable motifs  were excluded from these analyses. The CA results are shown here, with the sites plotted in their  respective drainage basins and language areas.    The bivariate plots show both language areas and drainage basins.

Other  motifs occur quite often in quadrant C sites and many of these sites include small numbers of hand  and weapon stencils.  2) East-west patterning Guringai/Darug language boundary  (drainage basins 10 - 13) The boundary between these two language areas is Berowra Creek. Both banks of this estuarine  waterway were surveyed for the Rock Art Project (McDonald 1990b). For the purposes of testing  this  defined  boundary,  the  sites  are  divided  according  to  their  location  on  left  or  right  bank  of Berowra Creek. This analysis indicates that the sites on either side of the creek have motif  differences (Figure 12.40).   The Darug sites are more homogeneous than the Guringai sites. There is also a change in  focus between the outlier sites in the two areas, with more human figures, land animals and birds  occurring in the former and more hands occurring in the latter. There is considerable variability  within these groups, based on drainage basins.

These sites fall  within Capell’s designated Tharawal and Darug language group areas.

While several sites have hand stencils, there is a definite focus on fish and other marine depictions.  The very small number of sites (n=5) makes conclusions regarding this area difficult. Summary Exploring how pigment motifs vary according to defined drainage basins and language areas has  again revealed a mosaic of stylistic heterogeneity. The regional core of stylistically homogeneous  sites appears to be in the Darkingung and northern Darug areas. The Guringai and southern  Darug sites are the least homogenous, while the Tharawal sites are different again.  Subdividing the language areas into drainage basins provided further insight into localised  variability. In the Darkingung area, all three drainage basins reveal very similar levels of  homogeneity. There is clinal variation here motif preference with a focus on hands in the Upper  Macdonald; hand stencils, terrestrial animals and birds in Central Macdonald; and anthropomorphs,  terrestrial animals, birds and then hand stencils in Mangrove Creek.   The purported Darug/Guringai language boundary south of the Hawkesbury River was  investigated. As with the engraved component, a strong separation between sites on either side  of Berowra Creek was discovered, supporting the presence of this linguistic boundary. As was  also found in the engraving assemblage, similarities between the Darug Berowra sites and the  Darkingung Mangrove Creek sites are striking.   The southern Darug and Tharawal sites are also highly heterogeneous. Both southern  Darug drainage basins demonstrate consistently high levels of heterogeneity and similar motif  preferences. The Tharawal sites however are the most varied of the southern drainage basin with  a focus on macropods, other land animals and birds.  Shelter Art Technique All 564 shelter art sites were used for these analyses. The same drainage basin and language area  divisions are used in these analyses as described above.  1) Darkingung language group  (drainage basins 1, 5 and 6).

Summary The shelter sites demonstrate more homogeneity on the basis of technique variables than was found  with motif preference. The Darkingung and northern Darug sites are the most homogeneous. The  southern Darug and Tharawal sites demonstrate relatively high and similar levels of technical  variability. The Tharawal and southern Darug sites show consistent levels of homogeneity. The  Guringai sites are the most heterogeneous. terra australis 27 328 </page> <page sequence="38"> Chapter 12: Regional synchronic variation: shelter art  A general trend, from north to south, is demonstrated in the use of white pigment and  charcoal. In all but Darkingung and Guringai areas the emphasis is on black drawings. In the  Guringai area the use of red pigment influence the technical diversity. In the Darkingung area,  engraved motifs play a part in the local diversity.   Internal variability was demonstrated across the different drainage basins. This was marked  in the Darkingung sample, with the Upper Macdonald sites being the most heterogeneous in the  region but the Central Macdonald group being one of the most homogeneous. This disparity in  technique is marked, particularly in light of the highly consistent motif homogeneity and outlier  foci in these two locations.   There is less disparity displayed by sites on either side of Berowra Creek using technique  variables, although the outlier focus on either side of the creek is markedly different. Again, the  Darug Berowra sites are similar to the Mangrove creek sites in levels of overall homogeneity -  although more engraved motifs are found in the latter.  rare motifs Rare and unique motifs were analysed to establish their geographic distributions in the hope that  this would elucidate localised stylistic traits. Analysis concentrated on non-economic motifs in an  effort to reduce environmental influences.   The number of times that any individual motif occurred at any shelter site in the region  demonstrated some interesting results (Table 12.6; Figure 12.54).

Unlike the engraved mundoes which are a common motif but found  at relatively few sites, hand stencils are ubiquitous. While not having the same prevalence as  hand stencils, macropods occur widely in pigment sites given their overall numerical contribution  (9.4% of the identifiable motifs).   The analysis of the maximum number of times that a particular motif occurs in a site shows  that there are some shelter sites in the region with large numbers of certain motifs (i.e. 417 hands  at Yengo 1; 45 macropods at #45-3-917, etc.: see Table 12.6). The geographic distribution of  sites with some of the rarer motifs was plotted, as were the language groups into which these fall  (Table 12.7). Figure 12.54: Occurrences (%f) of sites with particular motifs.  The  distribution  of  the  rare  motifs  were  also  plotted  (Figure  12.55  to  Figure  12.58).  These  illustrate the focus for particular motifs in some areas and the relative absence of these same  motifs from other areas. Women and snake motifs represent a proportionally higher contribution  to the Darkingung sites, while profile people occur much more commonly than elsewhere in the  Tharawal sites. Similarly, feet and contact motifs occur much more frequently in the Guringai  sample than elsewhere, as do kangaroo tracks in the Darug assemblage and other marine animals  in the Sydney assemblage.   ‘Other marine’ themes occur relatively infrequently in the Darkingung and Darug sites.  All anthropomorphic depictions are either rare or completely absent from the Guringai sample.  Culture heroes and snakes are absent or extremely rare in the Tharawal sites.   An approximate randomization method (Noreen 1989, Wright 1992) was used on the Table  12.7  to  test  the  statistical  significance  of  these  differences. Taking  a  probability  level  of  0.05  as statistically significant, the following significant differences are identified between language  areas (Table 12.7).   There are statistically significant differences between the Darkingung language area and all  other language areas. This is least strongly demonstrated between the Darkingung and Guringai  groups (Table 12.8).   There  are  also  statistically  significant  differences  between  the Guringai sites and those  from the Darug and Tharawal areas. The most significant of these is between the Guringai and  Tharawal groups. Interestingly the only significant difference recorded for the Eora sites is with  the Darkingung sites (sampling is likely to be implicated in this result). There is not a significant  difference between the Darug and Tharawal assemblages.  terra australis 27 330 </page> <page sequence="40"> Chapter 12: Regional synchronic variation: shelter art  Table 12.7: Rare Shelter Art Motifs: Distribution per Language Area.

Darkingung Eora &lt;.001 Darkingung Darug &lt;.001 Darkingung Tharawal &lt;.001 composition Guringai Darug .030 Here the compositional details of two rare  motif categories (shields and culture heroes)  Guringai Tharawal &lt;.001 are analysed. These same two motifs were  analysed in the engraved assemblage.  The  pigment motifs demonstrate  less compositional  ‘rigour’  than  the engraved component. Officer  (1984) argued that this was due to pigment art being ‘less culturally fettered’. The fact that the  techniques used are usually freehand drawing no doubt also contributes to a greater flexibility in  the graphic vocabulary used in this art form.   Shields The 34 sites with 54 painted, drawn or stencilled shields were analysed (Figure 12.56). It was  hoped that this analysis of pigment shield designs may contribute further to determining the  interrelatedness of contacts around the region - as shown by engraved shields (see chapter 11).     Much less design structure was identified with the pigment shield motifs. The vast majority  (83%) consist of either a simple outline or solid internal infill. In one site (Figure 5.21) there is a  stencilled parrying shield (with no decorative infill).   In the Warre Warren area there are several examples with internal designs that correspond to  the classification developed for the engraved shields (e.g. Figure 5.18). In all, a total of ten shields,  from seven sites, can be classified using the design categories defined. Only three identified forms  occur: types 2B, 2C and 2E (Figure 11.30). All three of these were recorded in one site in the  Warre Warren area (#45-3-970), while three other examples of type 2C were recorded at another  Warre Warren site (#45-3-1602), on the Colo River (#45-2-292) and at Manly (#45-6-1262).     Two forms unidentified in the engraving assemblage were recorded at two sites in Middle  Harbour and Lane Cove, these being a double longitudinal line (2E) and a single chevron design,  from site #52-2-453 in the Tharawal Avon/Cordeaux drainage basin. terra australis 27 331 </page> <page sequence="41"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange Figure 12.55: Pigment art sites.

The relative absence of shield designs, in comparison with the engraved component, is interesting  in itself. It reinforces the general contention that this is a less stylistically constrained medium.  While the sample size of pigment shield designs is very small, certain similarities and differences  with the engraved assemblage’s results can be made.   The double (horizontal) cross design (2C) was the most common engraved variety,  and 40% of the pigmented shields with designs were also of this type;    The pigment shields with designs were located mainly in the Darkingung area with  one only in the Guringai area. This is in stark contrast to the definite engraved shield  design focus in the Guringai area;    The only pigment shield with a St George cross (Type 2B) design was located in  the Darkingung language area, Mangrove Creek catchment. In this same site two  other design forms (2C and 2E) were also found. Type 2B was concentrated in the  Guringai and Darug language areas with the engraved shields;    The one engraved shield in Tharawal language area had no internal design; the drawn  version has a quite distinctive chevron design, not recorded elsewhere in the pigment  assemblage and not in the engraved assemblage (however, see Collins 1798[1975]:  Appendix VI; Plates 5 and 6);    No pigment shields had the diamonds design element at either end of the shield.  This engraved design element was concentrated in the Cowan and Middle Harbour  catchments. The pigment shield assemblage (in Middle Harbour and Lane Cove  catchments) included a design which did not occur in the engraved component - a  double longitudinal line design. Culture Heroes Only 18 pigment culture heroes occur in nine sites across the region (Figure 12.56). The discussion  here is restricted to those 17 motifs from eight sites from the north of the region39 (Table 12.9).  In  the shelter art component,  this motif’s form and distribution is significantly more restricted  than is found in the engraved component. All of the pigment culture heroes are of the Biaime  type. The analysis of this rare motif’s distribution indicates that it occurs only in Darkingung and  Darug language areas.  The engraved culture hero focus is in the Guringai language area. no  pigment culture heroes were recorded in the Guringai area.   This motif is found amongst a range of assemblage sizes, including in the largest recorded  in the region (Swinton’s). At four sites, these motifs occur in isolation. In two sites they are paired  male and female. In one site (45-2-189: Sim 1969) there are six pigment culture heroes.   The two engraved forms of culture hero are the Daramulan and the Biaime types. In the  engraved component, excessive size was a significant aspect of the classification. Decorative infill  and/or the presence of therianthropic characteristics were also considered important. Larger size is  a consistent criterion in this medium also, although the pigment forms are generally smaller than  their engraved counterparts. The mean size of the pigment culture heroes is 1.25m (standard dev.  0.6) and the largest of these motifs is c.3.0m long (at Canoelands: Clegg 1977, McCarthy 1961).  39One culture hero was recorded by the Sydney Prehistory Group (1983) south of the Georges River. This was  counted during the Rock Art Project (McDonald 1985a). This reanalysis of motifs necessitated further inspection of  the original scale recordings, held by NPWS (in the AHIMS Sites Register). The original SPG drawings went missing  from the Sites Register during the move from the city to Hurstville (Ian Johnson, then NPWS Sites Registrar, pers.  comm.). The motif from site #52-2-23 could not be reanalysed for this analysis.  terra australis 27 336 </page> <page sequence="46"> Chapter 12: Regional synchronic variation: shelter art Size appears to be due in part to the smaller ‘canvas’ size available in shelter sites. The consistent  size range demonstrated by these motifs and the fact that these are indeed larger than the majority  of  anthropomorphic  figures  depicted  in  shelter  art  sites40 suggests that relative scale is still a  consideration in this motif’s graphic ‘vocabulary’ or schemata. This motif is also differentiated  from plain anthropomorphs on the basis of infilled decoration and attachments (e.g. the double  and single horned anthropomorphs in the Mangrove and Mogo Creek catchments).

Eight of the culture heroes (47%) are in the Mangrove Creek catchment and five of these are the  red horned anthropomorph  form (Figure 5.14)41. A sixth red horned anthropomorph is located  near Mogo Creek less than 10km west of Mangrove Creek. A pair of black culture heroes in the  Mangrove Creek catchment (at #45-3-794) has a very similar morphology (minus the horns).  40This has not been quantified on a large scale. A limited analysis of the 33 anthropomorphic figures (men, women,  profile people and anthropomorphs) at the Swinton’s site indicated that the mean size for these was 0.46m (st dev.  0.2). The culture hero at this site was 1.1m long.  41The distribution of this motif is highly suggestive of the Darkingung mythical creature called Ghindaring. This  malevolent creature was said to inhabit the rocky places on sides of mountains and have a body ‘with a red glow like  burning coals’ (Mathews 1904: 345).  terra australis 27 337 </page> <page sequence="47"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange  Only one of the pigment culture heroes is therianthropic. The Canoelands culture hero has a  macropod-like head (i.e. in profile) with otherwise anthropomorphic characteristics (albeit seven  fingers on one hand).  These motifs have been produced in range of colours, although red is the most common.  Most of these motifs are drawn, but several also have painted elements. Monochrome is less  common than bichrome and there is the one polychrome example (at Canoelands: Table 12.9).  One black example also includes some abraded lines.   This analysis provides contradictory evidence to the engraved component. The most  obvious difference in these results is in the more restricted geographic distribution of the pigment  form motif. There is almost no overlap in the distribution of this motif in the two different art  components (cf. Figure 11.26 and Figure 12.56).   The absence of pigment Daramulan-type culture heroes is very interesting. This however  does correlate with the distribution of this form generally: with the exception of one Daramulan  found at Maroota, all of the Daramulan-type engraved culture heroes are in Guringai territory.  Shelter art sites: conclusions The analysis of this art component included a general investigation of regional characteristics  including technical options and motif focus.     Colour usage across the region reveals definite stylistic preferences which are not related  to pigment availability. In the south of the region there is a definite preference for black pigment.  In the north of the region there is a definite preference for white pigment. While this reflects the  prevalence of stencilling as a technique - white drawings and paintings are also common. The  dominance of white colour use in the north supports a model of contact between this part of the  Sydney region and the Hunter Valley.  The CA of motif and technique indicates that there is a core of greater stylistic homogeneity  in the centre-west of the Sydney Basin. From this core central area the surrounding art demonstrates  increasing stylistic variability. This core style area is not the same as that identified for the engraved  assemblage. And technique variables reveal a slightly different core focus pigment motifs. The  techniques used in pigment art across the region are relatively homogenous.  While these analyses have demonstrated localised stylistic variability across the Sydney  region, only in one area is this variability distinctive enough to identify a style boundary.    Stylistic variation can be explained  in  terms of  the defined  language areas. The core of  stylistically homogeneous shelter art sites occurs in the Darkingung and northern Darug language  areas. The Guringai and southern Darug sites are the least homogenous, while the Tharawal sites  are also relatively heterogeneous.  The proposed location of the Darug/Guringai language boundary is supported by shelter  motifs, with a strong separation between sites on either side of Berowra Creek. There is less disparity  shown when technique variables are considered, although the technical choices demonstrated (i.e.  outlier foci) on either side of the creek are markedly different.  The investigation of Darug sites north and south of the Cumberland Plain revealed that some  ‘bedrock design notions’ (Sackett 1990) transcend the distance between these two assemblages.  Both sets of Darug sites have a predominance of hand stencils with macropods, other land animals  and anthropomorphs dominating. Distance, however, has created some fundamental differences  between the Darug sites on either side of the Cumberland Plain. These are most obvious in terms  of schema. The southern sites have a schematic preference for the use of four legs on terrestrial  animals and two legs on birds (compared with two and one, respectively, in the north). This  schematic vocabulary is present in the southern Darug and Tharawal sites, but not the northern  Darug sites. This stylistic convention does not support the proposed boundary between the Darug  and Tharawal language groups. The pigment art suggests that there was more social interaction  between the southern Darug group and Tharawal speakers than there was between southern and  northern Darug members.  terra australis 27 338 </page> <page sequence="48"> Chapter 12: Regional synchronic variation: shelter art   The  analysis  of  rare  motifs  demonstrated  significant  differences  between  the  two  art  components. The amount of information-laden detail in the engraved shields, and the distribution  of engraved shield designs were not mirrored by similar design detail or distribution patterns in  the pigment shields. Culture heroes also showed different distribution patterns and a much more  restricted design vocabulary.  These results support a model for the expression of very different social behaviours in the  two art contexts.  terra australis 27 339 </page> </plain_text>
