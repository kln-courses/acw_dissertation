<plain_text><page sequence="1">ROBERT L. SELIG PURDUE UNIVERSITY "God si Love": On an Unpublished Forster Letter and the Ironic Use of in A Passage to India Myth In November of 1957 I received from E. M. Forster an amusing and il- luminating letter about a mythic interpretation of A Passage to India that I had written and sent to him. The letter throws light upon his half-joking use of myth and upon the unwise procedure of the many subsequent critics who have tried to interpret A Passage by a solemn conglomera- tion of supposed allusions from Hinduism, anthropology, psychoanalysis, and other specialized sources. I propose to present Forster's comments, to discuss their implications for criticism of his novel, and to offer an approach toward A Passage that is circumspect about its use of myth and, above all, responsive to its basically ironic mode. I shall concentrate on the ironies developed around the theme of "God is love." Finally, I shall consider, as discreetly as I can, the ironic postscript provided by certain thematic parallels to A Passage in Fors? ter's homosexual fiction published since his death. Most importantly, I hope to respect the book's artistic integrity by avoiding any interpreta? tion imposed from outside myths. In the words of Avrom Fleishman, who has written one of the most sensible analyses of this novel, it must be treated with a "critical tact" that "requires freedom from any fixed set of intellectual or symbolic references."1 1 Avrom Fleishman, "Being and Nothing in A Passage to India," Criticism, XV (Spring 1973), 116n. 471</page><page sequence="2">472 ROBERT L. SELIG I shall have to begin with some personal details in order to make clear the occasion and context of Forster's letter. In the Fall of 1957 I com? pleted a master's thesis at Columbia University entitled "Passage to More than India: The Mythological Meaning of E. M. Forster's A Passage to India." I sent a copy of my thesis to Forster with the perky self- confidence of a young graduate student who thinks that he has per? formed critical wonders for which the author will be grateful. A few weeks later he replied with detailed comments. As I glance at my thesis some twenty years later, it seems of interest now only as a naive foreshadowing of much learnedly irrelevant criticism of A Passage by subsequent decades of myth hunters. When I wrote my 106-page analysis, no more than a few other syncretically- minded critics had searched A Passage for myths. Most influential on me was Glen O. Allen, who, along with some perceptive remarks on the novel, had identified the mysterious "boum," "bou-oum," or "ou- boum" ofthe echo in the Marabar Caves with the Hindu mystic syllable OM or AUM.21 gladly accepted "boum" as the mystic syllable; attemp? ted to connect various mental levels described in the novel with an analysis, in the Mandukya and Upanisad, of layers of awareness attain- able by meditating on OM; and concluded that the central event of A Passage is the achievement of oneness, by Godbole and Mrs. Moore, with the divine blank of Brahman. I shifted then to a comparison ofthe caves episode with the allegory of the cave in Plato's Republic. I also drew labored parallels from anthropology, particularly The Golden Bough, to try to show that Miss Quested's belief that she had been sexually assaulted in a cave was actually a frustrated attempt on the part of her unconscious to enact a rite of fertility. I interpreted the accom? panying snake imagery as phallic and the caves as female orifices. The concluding section of the novel?with its rain, immersion in water, death, birth, and reconciliation?I explained by references to both The Golden Bough and Jessie Weston's From Ritual to Romance, and I made much of the resemblance of Miss Quested's name to the Grail quester or quest described by Miss Weston. The arrival of a hand-written air letter from Forster several weeks after I had mailed him my thesis filled me at first with a pride that turned to consternation when I read his witty objections to my work: 2 Glen O.

I hope you won't think me ungrateful and discourteous, but?as perhaps you presume?I fail to follow most [the original word that Forster wrote was "much," but he canceled it and wrote the sterner "most" instead] of your criticism. For one thing, you [Forster originally wrote "it" but crossed out the impersonal word and replaced it with the more accusing "you"] credit me with the reading of much I have never read. I never thought of Aum when I wrote Boum, and I was unaware of the subdivisions of the mystic syllable. I have never read Miss Weston, have only glanced at Frazer, have never been interested in Plato, never thought of his Cave in connection with the Marabar, and throughout your thesis have encountered inferences and comparisons that surprised me. You may reply that I knew all the above subconsciously, and then of course you have got me! And I realize even on the conscious level that there is plenty of sex in the book. All the same I think you go too far. You tend to make every hole, and every object that's longer than it's broad, into a sexual symbol?rather like G. K. Chesterton who regarded all objects intersecting at right angles as proofs of the truth of Christianity. Your affection for the book is evident, and I much appreciate it. .. . I also agree with many isolated judgements?e.g. the approximation of Godbole and Mrs. Moore, and my failure to present Ralph. It is your critical method that I feel compelled to reject?and maybe my subconscious will one day rise to the surface, and demonstrate to me that I am wrong! Yours truly E. M. Forster3 I found Forster's objections all too convincing. My only consolation was an ironic one over the next two decades, as critic after critic, independently of my thesis, offered mythological hodgepodges similar to mine to explain A Passage to India. In the same year as my thesis, James McConkey accepted the notion that "ou-boum" was OM and that Mrs. Moore encountered the blank of Brahman in her cave.4 Two important later critics who found OM and Brahman in the caves were Wilfred Stone, a Jungian, and ELT's Forster bibliographer, Frederick P. W. McDowell.5 Also in the years after my thesis, the Marabar Caves were identified with Plato's cave by Louise Dauner, Malcolm Bradbury, and by McDowell.6 The sexual symbolism of Forster's holes and protru- 3 Copyright ? 1979, Estate of E.

SELIG sions was asserted by such diverse critics as Dauner, Keith Hol- lingsworth, Stone, and Bonnie Finkelstein.7 And seven years after my thesis, Ellin Horowitz provided an elaborate explication of fertility rites as the key to the novel's meaning.8 In Dr. Aziz's quaint phrase from A Passage, the above critics and I are all "in the same box" (20). But lest an apparent agreement among us make their and my mythological read? ings seem more convincing than they are, I should point out that I have been very selective in my citations. I could instead have offered a widely differing list of mythic interpretations: the caves as connected with Virgil's Cumaean sibyl, the caves as identified with the atheistic determinism ofthe ancient Indian sect of Ajivika, the caves as symboliz? ing the "asceticism and renunciation" of the Jain sect, the caves as a symbol of scientific materialism.9 As Denis Godfrey has justly com- plained, "the quest for symbols in the novels of Forster has been carried too far, become an end in itself, a critical exercise in intellectual ingenuity."10 I and the other myth critics might, of course, appeal to the principal of the "intentional fallacy" in order to defend ourselves against Forster's rejection of our common "critical method." Indeed, he almost invites this tactic by the gentle irony of his final remark about the possible wisdom of his unconscious mind as opposed to his conscious ignorance of "most of" the book's allegedly mythic allusions. Yet even if we assume that Forster, as a critic of his own fiction, has no more inherent authority than any other critic, we should, in all honesty, add that his approach to A Passage in his letter has one great advantage over our mythological approaches: it utilizes a sense of ironic fun that corre? sponds very closely to the basic qualities of the novel itself.

But solemn mystical visions are belittled in the novel itself by the narrator's mocking comment, "Visions are supposed to entail pro- fundity, but?Wait till you get one, dear reader! The abyss also may be petty . . ." (209). Even on the subject of God or Brahman, Forster, unlike his critics, refuses to be serious. All that he will concede, in his most tolerant moments, is that people whom he has liked and respected believe in the One. His whimsical attitude toward religious faith is very much like that of his own Fielding in A Passage, who, though an "atheist," respected the belief in heaven of a good woman "friend" simply because she was his friend (256). In a mocking mood, however, Forster could make devastating fun of piety. A key sentence in his letter to me illustrates his irrepressible playfulness about supposedly sacred matters. "You tend," he complains, "to make every hole, and every object that's longer than it's broad, into a sexual symbol?rather like G. K. Chesterton who regarded all objects intersecting at right angles as proofs of the truth of Christianity." Part of the joke here comes from confounding Christian and sexual interpretations of symbols and treating them as analogous and equally foolish. But the joke about Chesterton was, in fact, originally directed against Christian symbol hunting alone. Forster first used his witticism thirty-seven years earlier in an unsigned review of Chesterton's The New jerusalem. This review, in the Nation (London), has been completely ignored by Forster's critics, yet it reveals his mocking rejection of the belief that symbols can refer magically to a transcendental reality: Symbols have their own value in the enrichment of life, they stimulate emotion, they help concentration, but they are dangerous playthings for an untidy man. "That reminds me of. . ." he thinks, and because his mind is dishevelled he confuses a reminder with a proof. Symbols are employed as proofs all through "The New Jerusalem." In the opening chapter the dog symbolizes Merrie England, the donkey Bethlehem, and both are used to prove the existence of such places. All objects that intersect at right-angles become proofs of the truth of Christianity. Snow fails when Mr. Chesterton reaches Jerusalem, admittedly a rare occurrence. But it makes the city look like a Gothic town, and so proves that it should be restored to Christendom. Contributory proofs, be it understood; Mr. Chesterton could hold his faith without them, for it is personal and profound. But he is always teasing objects to become symbols in order to reinforce that faith, and unless they are useful in this way he takes no notice of them. Thus symbolism makes him not only superstitious, but unobservant also. It saves him the trouble of looking at an object for its own sake.

SELIG carpentry of Godfrey de Bouillon's tower, and the snowstorm. He does not see them, and consequently we do not see them. We do not even see Jerusalem, because there, as in England, he is not looking at his surround? ings, but is spinning connections between the rafters of his own brain.11 Forster makes fun of Chesterton for wishing to believe that life is full of magical symbols, and although far greater modern writers than Chesterton?for example, Joyce?have been equally "superstitious" about symbols, Forster will have none of their "untidy" faith. In both his criticism and his fiction, he treats symbols in an essentially light-hearted way. He sees them as merely subjective representations, distinct from "objects" and provided by the mind in order to add an extra something to literal discourse ("enrichment"). The specific values that he grants to symbols are mundane ones that could be endorsed by any logical positivist: to arouse inner feeling ("stimulate emotion") and to hold the mind's attention ("help concentration"). With characteristic humor, Forster describes symbols as though they are toys?devices to play with but not to take seriously?and he warns that they are "dangerous play- things" for those who see them as clues to an external and supreme reality. The myth critics have ignored his amusing warning about the limitations of symbols and have attempted to soar to a sacred mytholog? ical heaven in their own make-shift celestial omnibuses. They have forgotten that Forster, in Aspects of the Novel, insisted that "prophetic" fiction requires the reader to suspend all "sense of humour."12 By con? trast, A Passage, in spite of its use of myth, demands that the reader keep his sense of comedy in good working order. Even the best of Forster's myth critics, George H. Thomson, does not seem quite to know what to do with myths that are used playfully and ironically. Thomson, unlike most of the others, has profited from some of the lessons of Northrop Frye's Anatomy of Criticism with its concept of mythology as a self-contained whole within the entire body of litera? ture. But Thomson nevertheless assumes that Forster's myths and sym? bols derive from the author's "ecstatic" experience, though how the critic knows about the novelist's ecstasy is not made clear. This critic also insists on cramming all of Forster's fiction into the single category of 11 "Reviews. The Untidy Gentleman. 'The New Jerusalem.' By G. K. Chesterton,. .."

Thomson's dubious tactic enables him to regard Forster's ironic playfulness as somehow less im? portant than the supposedly "ecstatic vision" expressed by his myths, as if the myths could be exempted from the irony. Yet, on A Passage itself, the critic has some tactful and helpful things to say, particularly about the theme of egocentricity or human self-enclosure, which Trilling briefly pointed out thirty-six years ago.13 Thomson provides a stimulat- ing analysis, for example, of the narcissistic image of the flame that is reflected on the wall of a Marabar cave (125), and he shows how it relates to the book's often-repeated theme of man's egocentricity. But even here, this critic's commitment to "ecstatic vision" leads him to talk as though he himself has glimpsed a region of mystical wholeness, both in and out of the novel, that transcends selfish separations. In other words, Thompson tends to exclude God or the One from the power of Forster's irony.14 Yet a central joke of A Passage is the suggestion that God Himself, if He exists, may also be, in a sense, enclosed by self-love. Mrs. Moore's Christian contention in Part I that "God . .. is . .. love," that we should all love one another, and that Englishmen should love Indians (50) echoes throughout the novel but is finally travestied in Part III, during the climactic Hindu ceremony, into "God si Love": The inscriptions which the poets of the State had composed were hung where they could not be read, or had twitched their drawing-pins out of the stucco, and one of them (composed in English to indicate His universality) consisted, by an unfortunate slip of the draughtsman, of the words, "God si Love." God si Love. Is this the first message of India? (287). Or, in the more decisive words of an authoritative later edition, "Is this the final message of India?"15 Critics who have glossed this passage interpret "God si Love" as a triumph of "the spirit" of religion "over the letter" or a demonstration of the superiority of a comically muddled 13 George H.

SELIG Hinduism to a Christianity that lacks a sense of humor.16 Such readings certainly catch some of the implications but assume a more reverent attitude than necessary toward either Hindu muddlement or the concept of God, and they miss an ironic joke about both God and love. Forster's sentence says that the "unfortunate slip" of the pen resulted in "the words, 'God si Love,'" yet only two of the three words are English. "5/" is the Italian third-person reflexive pronoun, as a writer would know who had praised the glories of Italy and its language in his early novels and who, in A Passage, wrote that "to regard an Indian as if he were an Italian is not-... . a common error, nor perhaps a fatal one . . ." (59). In pidgin English-ltalian, "God si Love" means God loves Himself. That this is, indeed, the meaning is indicated by the reappearance of "God si Love" in the later context ofthe absurd religious "games" played atthe Hindu ceremony: All laughed exultantly at discovering that the divine sense of humour coin- cided with their own. "God si love!" There is fun in heaven. God can play practical jokes upon Himself, draw chairs away from beneath His own posteriors, set His own turbans on fire, and steal His own petticoats when he bathes. (291) God loves Himself and romps with Himself because, in Forster's comic version of Hinduism, there is nothing but the divine self?an amorphous entity who includes within His selfhood human beings, jackals, wasps, oranges, cactuses, crystals, worms, bacteria, mud, and stones in one blissful muddle (33, 36, 209, 288). If Mrs. Moore's "God is love" refers to a Christian Deity who saves meritorious individuals and resurrects them into a heaven filled with other separate individuals ("and am I good and is he bad and are we saved?" [206]), the Deity of "God si Love" shares existence with no individual but Himself. Everyone and everything else are equivalent before Him simply because their individuality isan illusion and their reality is none other than His. If the God of "God is love" can be incarnated as a man ("and Unto us a Son is born, unto us a Child is given" [206]), the Divinity of "God si Love" can be regarded as residing in anything?a man, a monkey, a 16 Hollingsworth, p. 223.

Maclean, "The Structure of A Passage to India," University of Toronto Quarterly, XXII (January 1953), 157-71. An interpreter of "God si Love" is not helped much by the recently published information, in John Colmer, E. M. Forster: The Personal Voice (Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1975), p. 141, that Forster actually saw the mistake on a marble tablet in an Indian railway station, for one must still ask why he wove the garbled inscription into the central design of his novel.</page><page sequence="9">A PASSAGE TO INDIA 479 napkin (289, 323, 290)?precisely because such apparently individual manifestations are ultimately unreal, and only God exists. In the paradoxical words of the narrator's description of the Krishna cere? mony, God "is, was not, is not, was" (285). Here Forster does not use the language of mystical transcendence but rather of slapstick confusion in order to express man's perplexed efforts to escape from his own egoism into God's boundless self-love. Did he "succeed?" asks the puzzled narrator. "Books written afterwards say 'Yes,'" though A Pass? age to India is not one of those books. "How," asks the narrator, "if there is such an event, can it be remembered afterwards? How can it be expressed in anything but itself? Not only from the unbeliever are mys? teries hid, but the adept himself cannot retain them. He may think, if he chooses, that he has been with God, but as soon as he thinks it, it becomes history, and fails under the rules of time" (290). A further complication, then, in this religious muddlement is that, in spite of the teachings of Hinduism about the illusion of individual existence and the reality of God alone, mysticism can provide no certain knowledge of God nor even an assurance that He actually exists. This God of doubtful existence is nevertheless described, in the ac? count ofthe temple ceremony quoted above, as an inveterate practical joker. The theme of a mischievous Divinity is paralleled and foreshadowed in the novel by a leitmotif of practical jokes on a purely human level. Most explicitly, on the expedition to the Marabar, Dr. Aziz announces a prearranged program of "great" practical "jokes" directed against his poor relation Mohammed Latif for the amusement of the guests (130). But when Aziz's servant thwarts the relative's attempt to mount an elephant and forces him "to cling to the netting over the buttocks," Mrs. Moore and Miss Quested are merely "distressed," for they "disliked practical jokes" (140). Though we are told that tricks of this kind can express unmalicious merriment, Aziz has earlier acted out of unmistakable hostility in his prank of causing Panna Lal's horse to bolt with his helpless rider (58). Toward the close of the novel, Aziz behaves malevolently and not merrily when he conceals the existence of the rowboat's oars at Mau in order to keep Fielding, now considered an enemy, from taking his family out on the sacred pond (303, 314). Furthermore, the Moslem doctor's behavior at Mau is itself the result of Mohammed Latif s malicious practical joke in allowing Aziz to believe, incorrectly, that Fielding has married the doctor's former accuser, Miss Quested (295, 303-4). Still more disturbing is Aziz's ability to dismiss as a merely mischievous trick Fielding's truthful attempt to inform him that</page><page sequence="10">480 ROBERT L. SELIG Mrs. Moore is dead: Aziz, we are told, "was inured to practical jokes, even ofthis type" (256). The label of "joke" is applied indiscriminately even to an action that seems utterly sadistic. The essential function of practical jokes in the novel is, however, to be ambiguous, to be open to opposing interpretations as expressions of either love or malice. Two other memorable actions in the novel have the effect of practical jokes, though almost certainly not intended as such by the actors: in both cases either a single person or a couple disappoints others who have expected kindness and friendship. Thus, the Bhattacharyas, an affable Hindu husband and wife, promise to send a carriage in order to fetch to their house Mrs. Moore and Miss Quested for a friendly social visit. But, on the appointed day, neither carriage nor message arrives, though this mysterious withholding of hospitality is never explained (41-42, 66-67). A similar disappointment of friendly expectations is Godbole's unintentional failure to accompany the Marabar expedition. His failure, caused by his praying too long, also prevents Fielding from catching the Marabar train and thus leads to the ultimate catastrophe by leaving the two Englishwomen alone with Aziz (126, 131). In another sense, Miss Quested's extraordinary response to Aziz's hospitality on the excursion to the caves?her false accusation that he has tried to rap$ her?has the effect of a cruel practical joke played against her host. Indeed, the entire Marabar sequence seems the most monstrous prank of all, foreshadowed, as it is, by the unintended irony of Aziz's warning to his guests "that he might be playing one or two practical jokes at the caves" (130). From the Hindu point of view, however, the prank at the caves may be said to be played by God Himself. The essence of God's distressing joke in the caves is His refusal to manifest Himself. This refusal is not only paralleled by human failures of friendship, but, in a number of places in the novel, the divine Friend's rejection of man's appeal for love is explicitly foreshadowed. In the "Mosque" section, Mrs. Moore invokes her Christian God but senses no response: "Outside the arch there seemed always an arch, beyond the remotest echo a silence" (50-51). Dr. Godbole's Hindu explanation ofthe significance of the caves takes the form of "a religious song" that de? scribes what might be called the practical joke of Krishna, an avatar of God, in refusing to come to a suppliant "milkmaiden" (73-74, 77-78). The Moslems in the novel think of Allah's refusal to appear as the frustrating behavior of an inaccessible "Friend" (104, 113, 278). This theme of man's thwarted attempt to reach a whimsically unresponsive Deity culminates in the great scene in the caves.</page><page sequence="11">A PASSAGE TO INDIA 481 As a prelude to the caves episode, the narrator provides the narcissis- tic image of a match and its reflection on the walls of a Marabar cave: There is little to see, and no eye to see it, until the visitor arrives for his five minutes, and strikes a match. Immediately another flame arises in the depths ofthe rock and moves towards the surface like an imprisoned spirit: the walls of the circular chamber have been most marvelously polished. The two flames approach and strive to unite, but cannot, because one of them breathes air, the other stone. A mirror inlaid with lovely colours divides the lovers. . . . The radiance increases, the flames touch one another, kiss, expire. The cave is dark again, like all the caves. (125) The passage evokes, symbolically, the dilemma of human beings who seek out God at the Marabar. Even the most admirable of them, Mrs. Moore, is in search of a Divinity who will reflect, as in a mirror, her own inner ideal of "good will and more good will and more good will" (50). Though egocentricity is an accurate name for her dilemma, the word's connotations are too unsympathetic to suggest the way that life, by its very nature, imprisons in selfhood even well-meaning people who are struggling to reach outward to others and to God. Indeed, earlier images of flames in the novel explicitly suggest the idea of thwarted human good will. On the lowest level, the relatively inauthentic and feeble love of Ronny and Adela is "a spurious unity . . . as local and temporary as the gleam that inhabits a firefly" (86). On a somewhat higher plane, the good-will gestures of Aziz's fellow Moslems are "little ineffectual un- quenchable flames!" (105). On a still higher level, the erratic yet genuine love of Aziz for Mrs. Moore is a "flame that not even beauty can nourish" (21). Even the brightest of human flames, however, seeks a responding love similar to its own.17 God's capricious refusal to answer like with like is symbolized, in the novel, by the Marabar echo. The echo in the caves, unlike the reflection, fails to send back man's original message but, instead, travesties and ridicules his egocentric appeal to an anthropomorphic ultimate reality. The passages about the echo have been so often misanalyzed that they are worth quoting at length and analyzing again: There are some exquisite echoes in India; there is the whisper round the dome at Bijapur; there are the long, solid sentences that voyage through the air at Mandu, and return unbroken to their creator. The echo in a Marabar cave is not like these, it is entirely devoid of distinction. Whatever is said, the same monotonous noise replies, and quivers up and down the walls 17 john Sayre Martin, E. M. Forster: The Endless journey (Cambridge University Press, 1976), pp. 148-49, provides a similar analysis of this pattern of flame images.</page><page sequence="12">482 ROBERT L. SELIG until it is absorbed into the roof. "Boum" is the sound as far as the human alphabet can express it, or "bou-oum" or "ou-boum,"?utterly dull. Hope, politeness, the blowing of a nose, the squeak of a boot, all produce "boum." Even the striking of a match starts a little worm coiling, which is too small to complete a circle but is eternally watchful. And \f several people talk at once, an overlapping howling noise begins, echoes generate echoes, and the cave is stuffed with a snake composed of small snakes, which writhe independently. ... The echo ... had managed to murmur, "Pathos, piety, courage?they exist, but are identical, and so is filth. Everything exists, nothing has value." If one had spoken vileness in that place, or quoted lofty poetry, the com? ment would have been the same?"ou-boum." If one had spoken with the tongues of angels and pleaded for all the unhappiness and misunderstand- ing in the world, past, present, and to come, for all the misery men must undergo whatever their opinion and position, and however much they dodge or bluff?it would amount to the same, the serpent would descend and return to the ceiling. Devils are ofthe North, and poems can be written about them, but no one could romanticize the Marabar because it robbed infinity and eternity of their vastness, the only quality that accommodates them to mankind. ... Suddenly, at the edge of her [Mrs. Moore's] mind, Religion appeared, poor little talkative Christianity, and she knew that all its divine words from "Let there be Light" to "It is finished" only amounted to "boum." Then she was terrified over an area larger than usual; the universe, never comprehen- sible to her intellect, offered no repose to her soul, the mood ofthe last two months took definite form at last, and she realized that she didn't want to write to her children, didn't want to communicate with anyone, not even with God. (147-48, 150) The response of the caves to even the holiest and most loving quota? tion from 1st Corinthians is not silence, which would clearly have suggested the nonexistence of God, but instead reduction to the same unlovely noise as that created by any lowly action, including a man's clearing his nose of snot. One ofthe actions answered by "boum," "the striking of a match," suggests an explicit contrast with the cave's flatter- ing reflection of the flame of good will, which impresses Miss Quested as "rather pretty" though the echo drives her to hysteria (148, 194-95). In short, man's self-esteem is insulted in the Marabar by the unflattering sameness of its reply to his good or evil, exaltation or misery, or even mere trivial ity. The joke here arises from the uncomfortable re? semblance of the Hindu idea of Brahman to the materialistic idea of death as the annihilation of self. Both in Brahman and in materialistic death and also in the Marabar echo, individual distinctions cease. The same ironic joke is suggested by the interchangeable metaphors, for the echo, of "serpent" and "worm." We do not need a handbook of Indian mythology to learn that Forster is using the serpent here as a symbol of the everlasting, for he labels it later as "the serpent of eternity" (209).</page><page sequence="13">A PASSAGE TO INDIA 483 The important point is that his metaphoric serpent is itself made up of little worms and also of that other symbol for obliterating death, "mag- gots" (209). The essence of God's practical joke in the Marabar is to suggest to suppliants that He may, in fact, exist but cannot be distin? guished from "something snub-nosed, incapable of generosity [that is, love, charity, good will]?the undying worm itself" (209). The idea that "boum" is indeed a practical joke seems confirmed by a later passage. As Mrs. Moore is about to leave India, the landscape on the Bombay shore is personified into a chorus of characters who are amused at how successful the echo was at deceiving a fragile old lady: "The feet of the horses moved her on, and presently the boat sailed and thousands of coco-nut palms appeared all round the anchorage and climbed the hills to wave her farewell. 'So you thought an echo was India; you took the Marabar caves as final?' they laughed. 'What have we in common with them, or they with Asirgarh? Good-bye!'" (211). The laughter is disquieting, for the joke played on Mrs. Moore in the caves has undermined "her hold on life" (150), and the retraction comes too late to revive her: she will, in fact, die at sea that very night (250). In effect, the Marabar incident is another ambiguous prank, whose purpose may just as plausibly be either Mrs. Moore's destruction or her last-minute enlightenment by the joker. The word "final" in the mocking question of the palms connects it with that other ambiguous question which we have already interpreted as suggesting that God loves Himself and plays practical jokes on Himself: "God si Love. Is this the final message of India?"18 The specific implication, then, of India's "final message" for the Marabar episode is that the echo is not only God's practical joke but a joke played by God against Himself. Godbole hints at a similar conclu? sion in his Delphic pronouncement about what happened in the caves: "Good and evil are different, as their names imply. But, in my own humble opinion, they are both of them aspects of my Lord. He is present in the one, absent in the other, and the difference between presence and absence is great, as great as my feeble mind can grasp. Yet absence implies presence, absence is not non-existence, and we are therefore entitled to repeat, 'Come, come, come, come'" (179). In other words, God, who includes even absence and evil, is present in practical jokes, no matter how malicious, for, as the narrator later explains, "all spirit "A Passage to India (London: Edward Arnold &amp; Co., 1953), p. 297.</page><page sequence="14">484 ROBERT L. SELIG as well as all matter must participate in salvation, and if practical jokes are banned, the circle is incomplete" (291). Godbole's dark saying about "presence and absence" raises the in? evitable question of how the divine joker became separated from Him? self in the first place. In A Passage Forster does not deal directly with this problem, but given the novel's basic ironic premise, the implied answer would seem to be that God was split into distinct manifestations of presence and absence, of good and evil, by a primal practical joke played on Himself by Himself. In the language of the novel, this cos- mological game of hide-and-seek would be equivalent to His drawing "chairs away from beneath His own posteriors" (291). In any case, the original state of God, before such a self-division, seems explicitly suggested in A Passage by the description of the Kawa Dol, a hollow boulder perched above the Marabar caves in the form of a cosmic "egg": "a bubble-shaped cave that has neither ceiling nor floor, and mirrors its own darkness in every direction infinitely" (125-26). Though this symbol of Brahman is described as self-reflective, the primal self and its reflection are indistinguishable: black, unshaped, homogeneous, void, and limitless. The self-reflective quality of the One is parodied, throughout A Pas? sage, by the multitudinous human dilemma of imprisonment in indi- vidualized selves. Even the enlightened Dr. Godbole, at his highest moment of ecstasy, plays an absurd game of mirrors with himself as he tries to impell an image in his mind of the dead Mrs. Moore "to that place where completeness can be found"?the abode of oneness with "the whole universe," including wasps and stones. ". . . He was imitat- ing God" (288). " . . . It made no difference whether she was a trick of his memory or a telepathic appeal. It was his duty, as it was his desire, to place himself in the position of the God and to love her, and to place himself in her position and to say to the God, 'Come, come, come, come'" (292-93). Significantly, Forster uses the term "God" and "the God" interchangeably here. The Hindu professor, in his worship, enacts the equally shadowy roles of both sides ofthe game: a divinity who "is, was not, is not, was" (285) and a suppliant, Mrs. Moore, who may, in fact, be a mere thought in the mind of a Hindu who is himself an inadequate splinter of the self-loving darkness. The often-noted political theme in A Passage of the isolation of one race from another is so obviously connected to the metaphysical ironies of the God-si-Love theme that the point needs little elaboration. The</page><page sequence="15">A PASSAGE TO INDIA 485 English love themselves. The Moslems love themselves. The Hindus love themselves. Throughout the novel, the efforts of exceptional human beings to extend their good will beyond the boundaries of race and culture meet with ironic frustration. Thus, the first and most touch- ing of the interracial friendships?that of Mrs. Moore and Aziz?leads, in spite of the best intentions, to the Moslem's imprisonment on a false charge of rape, the intensification of hatred between imperialists and Indians, and the ultimate resolve of Aziz and his countrymen to throw the English out. Good will is met, on the human level, by man's own equivalent of "boum": his unresponsiveness toward those who differ from himself. Critics have long pointed out that the novel's theme of racial separa? tion is paralleled by a subtheme of sexual alienation: that is, Ronny from Adela, Adela from Aziz, and Fielding from most women. To put it another way, man, in A Passage, loves himself, and woman loves her? self. A postscript to this aspect of A Passage was provided, in 1971 and 1972, by the posthumous publication of Forster's homosexual fiction. John Colmer has already noted that the homoerotic theme in Maurice of the yearned-for "friend" who appears almost magically and enters the hero's bed in response to his anguished cry of "come" reads like a parody of religion in A Passage: specifically of Godbole's plea of "Come, come, come, come" to an unresponsive God (293).19 But an even more explicit parallel to the God-si-Love theme seems to have gone unnoticed in Forster's short story called "The Life to Come." A Christian missionary in the wilderness so impresses a native chief by the doctrine that "God is love" that at night the chief returns to the mission? ary and submits to a homosexual advance. Under the innocent impres? sion that Christian worship is, in fact, homosexual love, the chief then converts his entire tribe to homosexuality. But, as the years pass, the now-remorseful missionary rebuffs the chief's attempts to repeat their sexual encounter. At last, as the chief is dying, the missionary declares that their homosexual love was actually a perversion of the true Chris? tian religion but that they may achieve, in heaven after death, a spiritual love for one another. The chief responds by killing his former lover and then himself in the expectation of renewed homosexual love in heaven. The most surprising parallel to A Passage in this essentially trifling story "Colmer, p. 123; E. M. Forster, Maurice: A Novel (London: Edward Arnold &amp; Co., 1971), 15-16, 163, 178, 183.</page><page sequence="16">486 ROBERT L. SELIG is the missionary's answer to the chiefs first attempt to resume their sexual love: "Not yet."20 These same words appear, of course, in the famous last sentence of A Passage, which comes after Fielding, "half kissing" Aziz, asks "why" they "can't . . . be friends now?": But the horses didn't want it?they swerved apart; the earth didn't want it, sending up rocks through which riders must pass single file; the temples, the tank, the jail, the palace, the birds, the carrion, the Guest House, that came into view as they issued from the gap and saw Mau beneath: they didn't want it, they said in their hundred voices, "No, not yet," and the sky said, "No, not there." (324-25) In addition to the final "not yet" after the "half" kiss of Fielding and Aziz, a few other faint hints in A Passage suggest a discreet attraction between people ofthe same sex: Aziz's belief that a male "friend would come nearer to " replacing his dead wife than could "another woman" (53); Miss Quested's closeness to Mrs. Moore, in contrast to the young woman's distance from men, including her fiance (249); and Aziz's thought that young Ralph Moore is "rather beautiful" (311). One indi? rect hint of homoeroticism is the novel's total evasion, in Part III, ofthe task of presenting the beautiful Stella, Fielding's recently acquired young wife. She is never physically described, and she never speaks a word, not even in the scene in which she plays the central role when her panic overtums the two colliding boats and dunks both the English and Aziz in the Hindus' ceremonial pond (317-18). The inability to extend one's love beyond one's own sex can be considered a sexual form of egocentricity in the same sense that racial exclusiveness can be called egocentric. But the homoerotic elements in A Passage remain essentially latent and undeveloped amid the larger context of the sad yet funny limitations of all human efforts to love. Clearly the novel is far too universal to be labeled homosexual. Yet a remark of Forster's to Siegfried Sassoon, in a letter of August 1, 1923, does suggest that the author's private dilemma as a secret homosexual did contribute to the book's ironic portrayal of human and cosmic self-enclosure. Complaining of his weariness of having to write of heterosexual characters in order to maintain a respectable reputation, Forster declared that "my patience with ordinary people has given 20 E. M.

Forster, the old apostle of "the sanctity of personal relationships" (82), of "good will and more good will and more good will" (50), no longer felt capable of an imaginative identifi? cation with people of a sexual disposition unlike his own. His ironic portrayal of the frustrations of humans who try to reach, through love, beyond an egocentric self is, in fact, self-reflective. If the God of A Passage to India loves Himself and plays practical jokes on Himself, the author of A Passage makes gentle fun of himself as well as of the rest of humankind. 21 Quoted by Oliver Stallybrass in "Introduction," The Life to Come, p. xiv.</page></plain_text>
