<plain_text><page sequence="1">An Egyptian rhyton from the Eighteenth Dynasty* This article presents a previously unpublished vessel fragment of Egyptian clay, made in imitation of the Aegean rhyton vessel type. Fabric and stylistic comparisons date it to the late Eighteenth Dynasty. The decoration with an animal head, and the unusual solution of the spout, distinguishes this rhyton from other known Egyptian exam ples in clay and faience. The position of the animal head decoration is reminiscent of Hittite rhyta. The 'Amarna letters' indicate that Hittite kings sent rhyta to other kings as gifts. An Egyptian potter therefore probably pro duced this vessel, which is an amalgam of an Aegean vessel type with Hittite inspired decoration. The subject of this paper is the lower section of a fragmentary animal-headed pottery rhyton which sheds light on the connections between Egypt and the Aegean during the mid-second millennium bc. The object is in a private collection in Uppsala, Sweden.1 It was unearthed in one of W. M. Flinders Petrie's many excavations in Egypt. Petrie later gave the piece, among others, to Luxmore Newcombe, sub-librarian at University College London (1903 22) and later chief librarian (1922-26). Parts of the Newcombe Collection were offered for sale in 1993 at several auctions in London. One lot, consisting mostly of common votive notterv dating from the late Seventeenth to the late Eighteenth Dvnasties was acauired for a Swedish collection.2 Unfortunately, no notes concerning the exact archaeological provenance were preserved, nor were any of the pieces marked with excavation numbers. Object description Fabric: The fragment (figs i and 2) has been analysed by two experts in the fields ot vessel and fabric taxonomy. First, a visual analysis was done by the late Rostislav Holthoer, who confirmed that this piece should be classified as a member of the rhyton family.3 He considered it to be authentic, and manufactured from a chronologically correct Egyptian fabric, with a typical Eighteenth Dynasty slip. He suggested that the date should fall somewhere between the beginning of Amenhotep Ill's reign and the end of Akhenaton's, The authors would like to thank the late Rostislav Holthoer and Hans-Ake Nordstrom for their help in analysing the object described. Further thanks are directed to Tommi Kärkkäinen for drafting plates of the object, to Veit Stürmer for reading and commenting an early draft of the article, and to the referees for their valuable comments.

The second analysis was performed by Hans-Ake Nordstrom on the fabric itself.4 Using the Vienna system of Egyptian fabric taxonomy, including microscopic analysis (up to 30X magnification), he identified the fabric as belonging to the Nile B2 division, thereby confirming the Egyptian origin of the piece.5 The fabric was identified by the organic and mineral inclusions. The organic material consists of fine straw or cattle-dung, and the mineral inclusions consist of biotite (mica), quartz and feldspar sand. The black core, which indicates an incomplete incineration nf the orcranir material is clearlv visible all alnncr the hreak fficrs rh and indicating that the rhyton was fired at a maximum of 7oo°C. The outer surface of the vessel and the sculptured animal head are coated with a beige-white slip consisting of very fine clay.6 This slip is covered in some areas with small black spots which Nordstrom considered to be secondary and non-decorational. i hese spots are similar in appearance to lichen under low power magnification. Nordstrom regards this piece as Upper Egyptian in origin, an opinion based on the general appearance of the fabric. A 'Type Description' in accordance with the system created by Holthoer and Nordstrom would be as follows:7 Vessel Type: RH/IW/o/a-b. I his code describes a vessel, probably of unrestricted type, and belonging to the Rhyton family (RH). The ware is of IW type (uncompacted vessels of brown or red-brown ware with white surface slip); there is no painted decoration (o), and the size class is a—b (&lt;100-120 mm in probable maximum diameter). The vessel walls are restored from one large fragment, including the animal head and two sherds. Shape Modes: USx/UIv i V/U. This means an unrestricted (U) vessel with a simple contour (S) consisting of a convex curve (x), or an inflected contour (I; two or more divergent zones) with a concave upper curve (shape group). The shape class designates very deep (V) unrestricted types with unmodelled bases (U). The number in between these two codes (i) reflects the specific combination between the shape group and the shape class. The shape modes in this case are not dehnite as only the bottom section or the vessel is preserved. I he rim type is unknown and the base is rounded (type i). If this rhyton had a handle, it would probably have been small and vertically placed between the rim and body (type Vrb). The spout is intact and is attached to one side of the bottom, immediately below the sculptured animal head. If the vessel is orientated vertically, using the rilling lines as a guide, the spout points downward at a 45 o angle. Reconstruction: An analysis of the rilling lines on the inside of the vessel shows its original vertical orientation (fig. 3). For this piece to belong to a theriomorphic8 vessel, the orientation of the rilling lines would have to be rotated 90o, giving the vessel a horizontal orientation. This solution is highly improbable, as in this case, the sculpted animal head would tilt backwards at an unnatural angle. Decoration-. The main decoration is preserved in the form of the sculpted gazelle or ibex head (figs 1-3). The head of the animal shows finely modelled features, with prominent round eyes. Both ears are intact, but the horns which rose up between them, and may nave been scimitar-shaped, are now broken. A short stump (7 mm) is preserved on the left side. If the horns were long, then they were likely connected at their tips to the body of the vessel in order to strengthen them. Two appendages in the form of small attached knobs are placed 4 Nordstrom, persona] communication, April 1994. 5 See for a full discussion of fabric classification, and the details of the 'Vienna system': H.-A. Nordstrom and J. Bourriau, 'Ceramic Technology: Clays and Fabrics', in D. Arnold (ed.), An Introduction to Ancient Egyptian Pottery, II: Ceramic Technology, Clays and. Fabrics (Mainz, 1993), 168-73. There are two basic types of clay in Egypt: Nile silt and marl clay. The Nile silt is alluvial, whereas the marl clay comes from mountain deposits. The subtypes of these are differentiated by the most common inclusions etc. 6 Munsell: the outer surface (slip) is 10 YR 7-8/3 and the internal surface is 2.5 YR 6/4-5. 7 R.

Measurements: The measurements for height and rim diameter are not preserved. The maximum preserved diameter of the vessel itself is 65 mm. If the object is orientated vertically, the maximum preserved height is 58 mm. The animal head is 23.4 mm in width at the ears and 30.3 mm long from the tip of the nose to the back of the head. The outer spout diameter is 15.6 mm and the inner diameter is 4.4 mm (both measurements taken at the mouth of the spout) and the depth of the spout's inner pipe is 33 mm. The wall-thickness is: 8.7 mm (max. at base) and 4.4 mm (min. on body). Occurrence: Very rare (possibly a unique subtype). Variants: The conical rhyton is well documented in Egyptian contexts (see below). The vessel-shape of this piece, from what remains, seems to be similar to these except for the location and angle of the spout. Dating Animal head: It is difficult to be certain whether the animal head on the present vessel is a representation of a gazelle or an ibex. Egyptologists often confuse the two animals, and Fig. 3. A possible reconstruction of the rhyton (Geoffrey Metz) based on drawing by T. Kärkkäinen, and on the curvature and orientation of the inner vessel surface. Note that the head is hollow; probably in order to avoid cracks during the firing process. 9 Compare forelegs and knees of ibex on Tutankhamun's ibex vase in I. E. S.

The ibexes are species of wild goat (Capra :bex), which inhabit mountainous areas from the Sudan to the Alps, and east to India and ^hina. 1 he species most orten encountered by the Egyptians was probably the beden or Nubian ibex (Capra ibex nubiana)." The word gazelle is mostly used for small antelopes of :he genus Gazella, or other related genera. There are about twenty-five species throughout \frica and southern Asia.12 At least five of these are found in Egypt, of which Gazella dorcas s the most common.'3 The Egyptians were aware of the differences between the animals md had separate words for ibex (niiw) and gazelle (ghs).H In this case, the lack or a beard, a typical characteristic or the ibex in ligyptian representations, may indicate that this is a gazelle. In addition, the eyes are executed in a /ery similar fashion to the ivory gazelle in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which is said to 3e from the reign of Amenhotep III.15 Several existing amphorae from the time of Amenhotep 111 to Akhenaton have sculpted bex or gazelle head decoration which is comparable to the rhyton under discussion.16 These imphorae have been found in situ at Malkata and Amarna,17 the residences of Amenhotep III md Akhenaton respectively (fig. 4). In addition, there is a similar vessel fragment from Elephantine dating to the late Eighteenth to early Nineteenth Dynasties.'8 Vessel shape Dnly a few imported Aegean conical rhyta are archaeologicaliy attested in tgypt (Tell sl-Amarna,19 Gurob).20 In contrast, at least 14 rhyta are known to have been manufactured ay the Egyptians in taience and clay,"1 and date Irom the early Eighteenth Dynasty ^ l ell ;1-Daba) to the Nineteenth Dynasty A possible parallel to this vessel was found in an RicrhtppntH Dvniistv tnmh in Siiwa ffip-. c").22 This vessel is also beaker-shaDed. with an attached theriomorphic detail protruding from the side of the base.

Egyptian wall painting: During a short period in the Eighteenth Dynasty, covering the reigns of Hatshepsut, Thutmosis III, and Amenhotep II, wall-paintings depicted kftiw, generally accepted as the term for 'Cretans', or 'Minoans'.24 The tomb of Rekhmire (TT ioo) depicts three metal vases, each decorated with the sculptured head of an animal.25 Although Shelley Wachsmann identified them as the heads of ibexes,26 it is more likely that these were Agrimi (Cretan goat). Minoan rhyta: This decoration was used on Crete not only for metal vases,27 but also for clay rhyta. In Palaikastro, in Eastern Crete, two rhyta of piriform shape were found. Both are decorated with an Agrimi head,28 and date from Late Minoan (LM) IA to LM IA/B. This corresponds chronologically with the late Second Intermediate Period and the beginning of the Eighteenth Dynasty. To date, such vessels have not been discovered in Egypt. There is a gap between the Palaikastro rhyta (LM IA/B), the drawings in Egypt from the time of Thutmosis III (LM II), and our suggested dating for the Egyptian rhyton to the time of Amenhotep III or IV (LM/LH III A). Hittite rhytœ. There are Hittite rhyta recalling the placement of the animal decoration on the Egyptian rhyton.29 Suppiluliumas, King of Hatti, sent one rhyton to the Egyptian king 24 See S.

Unfortunately, it is not clear if this means a zoomorphic vessel or a vessel with theriomorphic decoration. Unlike Minoan rhyta, the animal decoration of the Hittite and Egyptian rhyta is situated at the bottom. Note that on the Hittite rhyta, the animal head is the spout. It is thus likely that the Egyptians had seen such rhyta with animal heads. Spout: Unlike original rhyta, and other Egyptian imitations, this fragment has an unusual spout. There is only one other vessel type known which has a spout (or double spout) similarly located on the side of the base, and these have no theriomorphic decoration.31 The authors have not found any Egyptian vessels with a spout surmounted by an animal; in contrast, the Hittite rhyta use the animal's mouth as a spout, instead of a separate orifice. In the case of our vessel, it is likely that a separate spout was a more simple solution. The neck of the animal has been hollowed out, the most likely explanation for which would be to keep it from cracking during firing, although it may be the remains of a potter's aborted attempt at producing a spout through the mouth. Function Different functions are attested and suggested for rhyta. Those made of precious metals were part of ceremonial gift giving between rulers.32 The king of Ahhiyawa sent two of them to Hatti,33 and the Hittite king himself sent another to Amarna, as mentioned above.34 In the Aegean, these vessels were depicted in a ceremonial context, during processions. As the political and religious spheres cannot be disconnected, rhyta may have had a religious function as well. It is not known how rhyta were used in Egypt. The few excavated rhyta in Egypt were £ i „ - ■ i : • o ~ : a ^ ^-p -,, llViUlV^l iUUlIU in the drinking scene in the tomb of Horemheb (TT78),35 which dates to the period between Thutmosis III and Amenhotep III. It depicts a servant holding a conical vessel.36 In the left hand he holds the handle of the vessel and the right one seems to be under the lower end of it. In connection with this scene, it may be proposed that our rhyton was used for pouring out wine during a dinner. Note that the dating of this official's tomb corresponds well with the dating of the Egyptian rhyton, and the suggested Minoan and Hittite originals. Conclusion The following conclusions can be drawn from the previous discussion. First, the fragment was derived from a rhyton and not from a theriomorphic vessel, which can be seen by the orientation of the rilling lines on the preserved inner surface of the vessel, fabric analysis demonstrates that this rhyton was manufactured locally in Egypt, and is therefore not one of the many imported rhyta trom the period in question. As tne origin ot tne taoric is proDaDiy Uooer Eevotian. this niece could be from Malkata, which would narrow down its date to sometime during the reign of Amenhotep III. A comparison to the ibex- and gazelle-adorned amphorae sets the date of manufacture sometime during the reigns of Amenhotep III and Akhenaton (c. 1390—1336 bc). The sculpted gazelle or ibex decoration on this piece could be a sign of Minoan influence, as similar decoration is found on imported vessels in the tribute scene from Rekhmire's tomb. 3° W.

It seems that during his reign Minoan metal vases were known in Egypt. Between Thutmosis III and Amenhotep III is a gap of less than half a century. This raises the possibility that the bgyptian potter who procuced this rhyton was inspired by Aegean (metal) vases. On the other hand, it has been suggested that it may be a case of Hittite inspiration. At the very least, the animal head just above the spout is not attested on Minoan rhyta. Egypt and Hatti were in contact from the time of Thutmosis III. Perhaps the long-known Minoan vessels with their animal decoration and the Hittite rhyton both inspired the Egyptians to create their own variant — especially the solution of the spout, which has no counterpart in the Aegean or Hittite area. This vessel could thus be regarded as an interfusion of different foreign artistic traditions by the Egyptians. Geoffrey Metz and Birgit Schiller</page></plain_text>
