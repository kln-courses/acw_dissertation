<plain_text><page sequence="1">Herbs (ausadhi) as a Means to Spiritual Accomplishments (siddhi) in Patanjali's Yogasütra Stuart Ray Sarbacker Obtaining Power in the Yogasütra In the Indian tradition, few scriptural passages regarding the attainment of spiritual power are as explicit in their formulation as the description of the means of attaining occult powers or spiritual "accomplishments" (siddhi) as that which is found in the Yogasütra of Patarijali section 4, verse 1. In this passage, Patanjali states, janmausadhimantratapahsamädhijäh siddhayah, which can be effectively translated as "[spiritual] accomplish ments arise from birth, herbs, incantation, asceticism, and contemplation." Patanjali thus indicates that human experiences of supernormal powers of perception and action arise from a variety of sources, some of which are a result of one's own volition (such as ascetic discipline) and some of which arise from factors beyond one's immediate control (such as one's nature or status at birth, which is dependent on the fruition of the impres sions [samskära] of actions [karma] from previous lifetimes). In the Yoga sütra, in its commentaries and in the broader Hindu literature of Yoga and Tantra, these siddhis are modes of knowing and acting, and they include such powers as the ability to fly, to see near and far, to become invisible and to know one's own body and the cosmos profoundly and completely (White 2003: 199-200). They are idealized in Indian philosophical and narrative literature in what is often referred to as the classical list of the so-called "eight siddhis," which are referred to in Yogasütra 3.45, tato'ni International Journal of Hindu Studies 17, 1: 37-56 © 2013 Springer DOI 10.1007/s 11407-013-9137-3 © 2013 Springer</page><page sequence="2">38 / Stuart Ray Sarbacker mädiprädurbhävah käyasampat taddharmänabhigätasca ("and [from contemplative mastery of the elements] there is the arising of smailness, etc. [animädi], perfection of the body, and imperviousness to their quali ties"). These eight siddhis include smailness (anima), lightness (lagnimä), greatness (mahima), attainment (prâpti), irresistible will (präkämya), subjugation (vasitva), lordship (isitrtva), and mastery of desire (kämäva■ säyitva) as one common instantiation found in Vyäsa's commentary. Yogasütra 4.1 presupposes the existence of such spiritual accomplish ments and the assumption that such powers can arise out of natural condi tions such as one's psychic and physical constitution at birth as well as being deliberately cultivated through the practice of Yoga and other disci plines of mind and body. Yogasütra 4.1-7 represents spiritual accomplish ments as flowing from the five different modes of attainment, but for the yogin (and, presumably, the yogini), whose accomplishments are born explicitly from meditation (dhyäna) and implicitly from contemplation (samädhi), a different set of karmic implications apply. The worldly actions of the accomplished yogin or yogini in the world, rooted in the activities of a meditatively constructed mind (nirmäna-citta), are beyond virtue or vice, not to be qualified as white, black or black and white— that is, virtuous, unvirtuous or mixed—as the actions of ordinary persons would be. Until recently, a prevalent assumption in scholarly research and popular discourse on Yoga has been that representations of the pursuit of siddhis should be considered an aberration from "authentic" Yoga methods and goals, a "corruption" of a pure and unadulterated archaic Yoga tradition. Mircea Eliade, for example, famously portrays Patanjali's Yoga in his work Yoga: Immortality and Freedom (1990) in what might be considered a puritanical light, as a coherent and rational tradition to be contrasted with other forms of Yoga that were more ecstatic, and ultimately less yogic, in nature. For Eliade, the Yogasütra and "classical Yoga" or the "Yoga philosophy" (yoga darsana) served as the gold standard against which to evaluate the coherence and purity of other Yoga traditions, which he often describes as baroque, derivative or lacking philosophical coherence, whether they be "aboriginal" or tantric forms of Yoga. He is particularly critical of conceptions of Yoga in which the use of psycho genic substances are implied or implicated, suggesting that such practices are a conflation of the yogic with the ecstatic, a sort of category error</page><page sequence="3">Herbs as a Means to Spiritual Accomplishments in Yogasutra / 39 (Eliade 1990: 338-39). It may indeed make sense to look at the Yogasutra as an idealized pedagogical model for introducing the topic of Yoga—it is, in fact, a synthetic text that integrates the threads of many traditions of Yoga and asceticism, most notably of Hindu, Buddhist and Jaina origins, into a concise and coherent presentation of the principles of Yoga. The concept of the "eight-limbed Yoga" (astähgayoga) provides a simple but coherent and effective structural model for articulating the different dimensions of Yoga practice, from the external and social dimensions to the physical and subtle psychological dimensions of the tradition. Though some recent scholarship has sought a reestimation of Patanjali's import and influence with respect to the history of Yoga (Singleton 2008; White 2009), the centrality of the astähgayoga paradigm in mainstream Hindu Puräna literature and its appearance in Hathayoga texts and the Yoga Upanisad literature tend toward an affirmation of its role as a paradigm for the systematization of Yoga (Sarbacker 2011b: 200-201). Eliade utilizes Patanjali's Yoga in this manner quite effectively in his Yoga: Immortality and Freedom, creating a foundation of concepts for the study of a range of forms of Yoga through first sketching out the principles of the Yoga philosophy. However, considerable evidence is mounting that such a puritanical and idealized view of Yoga—and even of Pätanjala Yoga itself—is at odds with both philosophical and narrative evidence and that the siddhis, rather than being an afterthought or an aberration to the yogic path, are an integral part of the ideological framework of yogic thought (Grinshpon 2002; Sarbacker 2005; F. Smith 2006; Staal 1975; White 2003, 2009). With respect to the Yogasütra, one basic argument for taking the attain ment of spiritual accomplishment seriously is that if yogic siddhis were an aberration and somehow unimportant, it is unlikely that Patanjali would commit nearly one-third of the Yogasutra to discussing them, a point noted by a number of contemporary scholars. This makes perfect sense if yogic traditions are understood to have an inner dynamism between the quest for magical power within the world and escape or liberation from embodied existence (Sarbacker 2005, 2008). Within many Yoga traditions, a tension exists between the attainment of worldly power through self-discipline or asceticism of mind and body, on the one hand, and principles of renunciation that aim at a transcendent</page><page sequence="4">40 / Stuart Ray Sarbacker state of freedom through the throwing off of worldly desires, attachments and even embodiment, on the other. The intention to break free from the samsäric cycle of misery and rebirth is matched, in varying proportions, with the homologizing of the yogin or yoginl with divine agents and an encompassing of numinous powers—that is, powers and capacities typi cally characteristic of divine beings, such as the powers of flight, divine vision and so on mentioned above. The attainment of spiritual accomplish ments represents a process of human divinization, as the achievement of such powers represents a transcending of human capacities, a breakdown of boundaries between the human and superhuman that leads the agent to a state of otherness not bound by worldly limitations. Saguna and Nirguna: Embodied and Disembodied Deity There are philosophical parallels between this dynamic and the saguna versus nirguna representations of divinity within later traditions of Vedänta, in that one mode of yogic attainment aims to endow the practitioner with divine attributes and the other tends toward transcendence of the world, often in the form of a disembodied state (Sarbacker 2008: 161-72). Ninian Smart (1978) differentiates mysticism from numinous religious experiences via an influential typology of religious experience that is analogous to the saguna-nirguna distinction in Indian philosophy. Where I would disagree with Smart, however, is in his dichotomizing of religious experience—on pragmatic grounds, if no other, inasmuch as what is referred to as mystical, in common use, does not only pertain to conceptions of the transcendent or ineffable (Sarbacker 201 la: 29-33). Smart's argument may also rule out an ascensional scheme from form to formlessness, which might be argued to be a hallmark of the pragmatism of Sankara's Vedänta. This point can also be said to be illustrated in the Yogabhäsya commentary to Yogasütra 3.51, stänyupanimantrane sahgasmayäkaranam punaranista prasahgät ("there should not be prideful smiling at the entreaties of the gods, due to their association with the return of the undesirable [states]"). This passage details the temptation of a yogin by heavenly inhabitants who offer promises of sublime heavenly joy, including the use of divine "potions" (rasäyana). Vyäsa, the commentator, states that the heavenly "powers that be" notice a practitioner's attainments due to their degree of perfection, implying that these temptations themselves are a result of, and</page><page sequence="5">Herbs as a Means to Spiritual Accomplishments in Yogasutra / 41 indicative of, yogic mastery at a sophisticated level of practice. This serves both to temper the idea that Yoga powers are irrelevant to "orthodox" practice and, at the same time, to reaffirm the notion that the yoga darsana, at least as understood in its primary commentarial literature, views yogic powers as potentially detrimental to obtaining kaivalya. Instead, the aspiring practitioner of Yoga obtains, or becomes capable of obtaining, all of the powers of a saguna deity before abandoning them and entering into a final spiritual transformation into a nirguna form. Patanjali's Yoga sutra thus demonstrates a significant preoccupation with the powers {siddhi) of Yoga, minimally as potential distractions from a spiritual path and maximally as accoutrements of a quasi-divine being that has reached the threshold of liberation or has gone beyond it altogether (Äranya 1983: 346-407). There are additional etymological and philological connections that can be made between the terminologies of spiritual accomplishments {siddhi) in the Yogasütra. Pâda, or section 3 (of 4) in the Yogasutra, is entitled Vibhütipäda, the section on higher powers, literally "manifesta tions"—what David Gordon White has referred to as "omni-presencing" (2009: 39). These vibhuti are in some cases explicitly identified as siddhi, such as in Yogasutra 3.37, for example, which discusses the notion of spiritual accomplishments as both a sign and an impediment (upasarga) to yogic mastery. The term siddhi is further represented in the embodied form of the siddha, or "perfected one," a term that has a rich history in Indian narrative tradition, and is appropriated within different strata of Indian religions to talk about ideas of spiritual perfection as they are embodied by human and non-human beings. In the Yogasutra and the Yogabhäsya, the word siddha appears several times, providing a seman tic range for understanding the dynamics of the term. In Yogasutra 3.32, mürdhajyotisi siddhadarsanam ("[there is] seeing of the siddhas [via concentration] on the crown of the head"), Patanjali indicates that percep tion of some sort of perfected beings is possible through concentration on this part of the (subtle) body. White suggests that there is likely a connec tion between this passage and Jaina cosmology, and it could be added that the series of verses of which this is a part indicates a correlation of the internal subtle body (näbhicakre, the "navel wheel") with inner knowl edge of oneself and of the greater cosmos in a proto-tantric fashion (White 2003: 176).</page><page sequence="6">42 / Stuart Ray Sarbacker Notably, as in Jaina cosmology, the siddhas reside in the upper echelon, or "head," of the anthropomorphic (human-shaped) cosmos. Vyäsa's commentarial passages to 3.32 and 3.51 are replete with Puränic-type narratives of siddhas as a class of divine beings. The siddhas are connected in one verse to the maharsis, another class of celestial beings. There is a consistent and overarching theme in the association of yogic attainment with ascension motifs, both inner and outer, further implying a process of deification of the yogin through the approximation of the powers and capacities of divine beings that exist on a higher level of the cosmological scale. There may also be pragmatic anthropological grounds for viewing siddha-hood as a form of ascetic and charismatic authority attained through yogic discipline, which in the absence of ritual and institutional specialization demonstrates high status within a spiritual hierarchy. Sources of Spiritual Accomplishments (siddhi) The preeminent basis for the attainment of spiritual accomplishment in the Yogasütra is samâdhi, contemplation, which can be translated as "enstasis" or "meditative contemplation" to capture the sense of the process of introversion that samädhi denotes. Yogasütra 4.1 expands this discourse, pointing out that there are other means to the attainment and experience of power than simply the meditative process of samädhi. The first of these sources is birth (janma), which can be interpreted in light of Vyäsa's commentary to mean a miraculous type of birth that is characteristic of mythical personages and which demonstrates the ripening of karma (action) from previous lives, such as religious practice or sädhana, or some other predisposition to power or greatness. A second source of siddhis, according to Yogasütra 4.1, is the use of herbs (ausadhi), refer ring to the concept of a herb, medicine or drug that engenders a particular power or ability in the person that has consumed it. The third source of siddhis is mantra, specifically the performance of verbal incantations that are rooted in the Vedic corpus of literature and practice, encapsulating a yogic perspective on the power of language over mind and reality. Mantra is, in at least one respect, an ideal example for examining the notion of siddhi, as through proper acquisition of a mantra (that is, from a guru) and through prolonged repetition (japa), one "perfects" the mantra in a sort of breakthrough experience.</page><page sequence="7">Herbs as a Means to Spiritual Accomplishments in Yogasutra / 43 In the first päda of the Yogasutra ( 1.27-29), Patanjali specifically intro duces the practice of the pranava mantra, Om, which is represented as tasya väcakah, the "expressive of him," namely the "Lord" (Isvara) of Yoga. Another verse (Yogasutra 2.44) refers to the practice of svädhyäya, roughly synonymous with japa, as a means to obtaining "union" (sampra yoga) with one's chosen deity (istadevatä). In Yogasutra 4.1, however, Patanjali is likely referring primarily to how the mastery of particular mantras leads to power over some aspect of the conditioned world, and Vyäsa's commentary suggests that particular mantras lead to the attain ment of particular powers, such as the eight siddhis, referencing the powers of "smallness and so forth" (animâdi), as was discussed in relation to Yogasutra 3.45. The fourth source of siddhis discussed in Yogasutra 4.1 is tapas, literally "heat," the fire or friction created through ascetic practices of self-discipline and self-mortification. Conceptions of the purifying or perfecting force of tapas are demonstrated in the Yoga sutra and throughout Indian Hindu, Buddhist and Jaina literature, where ascetic practices are associated with purification, magical power and ascetic supremacy. The last of the sources mentioned in Yogasutra 4.1, samädhi, represents the primary yogic methodology for acquiring power and knowledge, which is through conditioning the mind and thereby developing a one-pointed and penetrating perceptual field that masters whatever it is directed toward. This is the nature of the samâdhi-siddhi, where the mind at the level of mastery, samyama, comes to know its objects in such a way as to reveal their inner mechanisms and thereby give the yogin or yogini power over them. The discussion of the use of ausadhi or "herbs" in Yogasutra 4.1 is particularly interesting in light of "classic" scholarly theoretical debates in the study of religion regarding the relationship (or lack thereof) between drug-induced experiences and religious experiences. Yogasutra 4.1 implies that herbs are a legitimate, or simply actual, means of engendering expe riences that lead to the acquisition of spiritual accomplishments. In the context of the study of religion, the famous arguments of Aldous Huxley and R.C. Zaehner, and more recently of Huston Smith and others (on using the preferential language of "entheogens," for example), have made an issue of the legitimacy (or illegitimacy) of religious or mystical experi ences cultivated through the use of drugs and other substances (H. Smith 2000: 15-32; Staal 1975: 155-89). Eliade (1990: 338), for example,</page><page sequence="8">44 / Stuart Ray Sarbacker appears to place Pätanjala Yoga in a preeminent position due to what he views as its freedom from the corrupt baroque traditions of Yoga and Tantra, in which the use of such substances is more central. However, in Yogasütra 4.1, Patanjali appears to recognize that the use of ausadhi was a widespread part of the culture of asceticism, if not Yoga itself, at the time when the text was compiled. As Frits Staal (1975: 161) has argued, the Indian context, with its references to the siddha-Uke Kesins in the Vedas, ecstatic soma traditions (soma being referred to in the Rg Veda as the "king of herbs") and the damra-ornamented Siva, appears to provide an ample range of support for the idea that psychogenic substances are a significant part of the religious and mystical cultus in which Yoga is situ ated. Furthermore, Shashibhusan Dasgupta (1985: 193-94) has argued that the reference to ausadhi in Yogasütra 4.1 may well indicate an impor tant link between an early "Rasäyana school" and later traditions of Hatha yoga (of the Nätha Siddhas), and thus demonstrate a continuity of the validation of ausadhi in spiritual pursuits across the continuum of Yoga traditions. If Dasgupta is in fact correct, then this provides further support for the notion that the yoga darsana cannot be understood as simply a philosophy of world liberation but should instead be thought of as a broader, more integrative paradigm of Yoga praxis. In this light, Vyäsa's commentary to Yogasütra 4.1 with respect to ausadhi is a provocative one. Vyäsa situates ausadhi cosmologically, as products of abode of the asuras—the archenemies of the devas, or gods, in Indian narrative— identifying ausadhi with the notion of elixirs (rasäyana). This view of ausadhi evokes the image of a magical potion that transforms the con sumer, conceptualized through the numinous imagery of a hidden, and perhaps forbidden, world of divine "others" that share a narrative locus with the yogin and yogini. The identification of ausadhi with the category of elixir can also be connected to traditions of Ayurveda. According to Julius Jolly (1977: 30), Ayurvedic elixirs have traditionally been understood to have two primary functions, namely, to bring about strength and to remove disease. However, it is important to note that the use of ausadhi in the Vedic and Ayurvedic contexts takes on a wide range of forms beyond these two forms of rasä yana. Though one primary aspect of the use of ausadhi is in the making of such medicinal potions and substances, according to Kenneth G. Zysk (1993: 96-102), the "dominant" use of herbs in the Indian context has</page><page sequence="9">Herbs as a Means to Spiritual Accomplishments in Yogasutra / 45 been as amulets and talismans—as items of ritual potency that would affect the user who kept such things on his or her person. Another closely related application is the use of a herb as a sort of ritual wand in healing and other ceremonies (97). Zysk also notes that the Rgvidhäna advises the worship of both ausadhi and Rudra (the Vedic forerunner of Siva) in order to protect oneself from disease and indigestion (98). Likewise, Rg Veda 10.97 gives a litany of material and spiritual benefits arising from appropriate ritual use of ausadhi (99-102). Though these benefits are uniquely fit to the Indie, and especially the later Vedic, context in that they emphasize the obtaining of material abundance and protection from human and spiritual enemies, they extend beyond that frame to encompass a hierarchy of potency with soma at its head. These uses of herbs demon strate the clear intersections of Vedic and yogic traditions, with the use of ausadhi functioning as one of the peripheral practices outlined in the Yogasutra, a role similarly demonstrated by other concepts such as tapas and svädhyäya, which have complex roles within Vedic ritualism and asceticism. All three of these Vedic practices— tapas, svädhyäya and ausadhi—are understood to have a place and efficacy within the sphere of yogic practice. Sources of Power and Interpretation Siddhis, then, are woven into the religious fabric of Yoga and are a criti cal part of, or perhaps a symptom of, the process of yogic development as understood by Patanjali and his commentators. In the case of Yoga sutra 4.1, the means of acquiring siddhis is broadened to include sources other than samädhi, indicating that such powers are available through a range of practices, some of which have only a marginal relationship with the concrete moral and soteriological commitments of the Yoga philos ophy. Though there is certainly an overarching cosmological, metaphysical and moral scheme in Patanjali's Yoga philosophy, it does not follow that those who seek to obtain siddhis necessarily embrace that framework and the moral imperatives, especially moral restraint {yama), that Patanjali prescribes. Patanjali argues that the pursuit of worldly and otherworldly power has the consequence of binding one to future misery, and therefore it is incumbent upon the practitioner of Yoga to exercise moral restraint (yama) and dispassion (vairägya) in addition to active practice (abhyäsa).</page><page sequence="10">46 / Stuart Ray Sarbacker In Yogasütra 1.15, Patanjali indicates that the perfection of dispassion is characterized by lack of desire for worldly, "seen" (drsta) objects or con ditions and spiritual goods promised in scripture that have been "heard" (.anusravika) of or read about. Patanjali thus argues that there is a hier archy of worldly and spiritual goods that are objects of desire and that spiritual progress is indicated by dispassion toward such objects, both worldly and spiritual. The siddhis, as magical powers or accomplishments, would constitute an example of the latter type, the "heard" category, and are archetypes or idealized forms of the former, "seen" objects. According to Patanjali, both categories of desired objects stand in the way of yogic progress toward liberation, since they propagate a mode of existence that entails attachment to the material world and reassociation with undesirable states (Yogasütra 3.51). However, it is clear that the powers obtained through yogic and ascetic practice—including the use of ausadhi—do not have a moral or spiritual valence in themselves and can be wielded in a variety of ways. This analysis of yogic praxis and of the transfiguration of human powers and capacities as discussed in Patanjali's philosophy can be fruitfully conceived of as an Indie phenomenological framework for understanding human transcendence and its moral and spiritual valences. Following Gerald James Larson and Ram Shankar Bhattacharya's (2008) recent assertions that Patanjali's philosophy can make important contributions to contemporary philosophy of mind, I would like to demonstrate how the application of Patanjali's philosophy can provide phenomenological insight into a number of spheres of contemporary life where human abilities are augmented in order to transcend physical and psychological limits. Previous studies have argued that Patanjali's Yoga philosophy contains analogues to phenomenological thought with respect tc the operation of consciousness and the nature of liberation and the ways in which practices such as posture (äsana) and breath control (pränäyäma) indicate a continuity between "inner" and "outer" worlds with respect to the human organism (Morley 2001; Puligandla 1970; Sarukkai 2002; Sinari 1965). Though James Morley (2001, 2008) indicates that it is possible to see analogues between concepts in Yoga and in the phenomenological method of Maurice Merleau-Ponty with respect to conceptions of an integral relationship between mind and body, he views Patanjali's Yoga philoso</page><page sequence="11">Herbs as a Means to Spiritual Accomplishments in Yogasutra / 47 phy, in particular, as a stripped-down version of more indigenous and tantric forms of Yoga, to some extent reversing Eliade's model. Morley does acknowledge Ian Whicher's (1998) stance with regard to viewing Yoga philosophy as a "reorientation" to nature rather than an escape from it, but he does not explore the manner in which the discussion of the attainment of spiritual accomplishments in the Yoga philosophy could be understood as relating a phenomenological theory of embodi ment. It may also be noted that though notions of practice are not alien to the phenomenological projects of Edmund Husserl and Merleau-Ponty, epoché being a case in point, the Yoga philosophy of Patanjali is framed in such a way that practice is understood to be at the heart of the project, having distinctly non-conceptual and practical trajectories—spiritual accomplishment and liberation (kaivalya). Patanjali's analysis of the implications of Yoga practice as broadly construed (including the "five sources" of siddhis) leads to the prescription of principles of moral restraint, rooted in a perspective on the social and spiritual implications of ascetic and yogic mastery. Lastly, Patanjali's philosophy is one that encompasses radical transcendence, the liberation (kaivalya) of the ultimate "person" (purusa), and the world of phenomenal existence, in which the mind and body are equally aspects of nature and not represen tative of a Cartesian dualism. It should be kept in mind that the dualism of Yoga philosophy, if it makes sense to call it a dualism, is between consciousness (purusa) and materiality (prakrti), the mind and cognitive factors, as well as the gross physical body, being aspects of the latter. As such, the critiques of Cartesian dualism characteristic of European phe nomenology are oblique with respect to Pätanjala Yoga. Sources of the Siddhis: An Indie Phenomenological Perspective In order to demonstrate its interpretive salience, Patanjali's paradigm for understanding human power and transcendence through self-discipline can be applied in a number of coherent ways to a wide range of common human experiences that are instantiated and inflected in distinct ways in our contemporary postmodern society. To start with, a broad argument can be made for the circumstances of one's birth (janma) as a source of human power in a number of ways. Two notable examples would be in terms of wealth or political power, "being bom into" a family with con</page><page sequence="12">48 / Stuart Ray Sarbacker siderable cultural or economic capital, and in terms of the physical struc ture of one's physical make-up at birth, which provides the preconditions for particular physical and mental characteristics. It might be asked to what degree power in contemporary society is a function of these founda tional conditions of birth, such as how being born into a family possessing wealth and political power affects the likelihood that one will have prestige and power in life. Likewise, the physical and mental capacities with which one is bom lay the foundation for physical and mental capacities throughout life, even if they are not ultimately determinative, as theories of neuroplasticity and epigenomics would suggest, and given the fact that many, if not all, notions of giftedness presuppose particular cultural values. In the case of incantation (mantra), if we look at mantra as a function of the power of speech (väc), we can find innumerable examples of how mastery of particular disciplines (law, for example), languages (Sanskrit, Latin, Chinese, English, etc.), charismatic modes of communication (glossolalia), rhetorical skills (oratory), acting, musicianship and so forth serve as bases for worldly power and accomplishment as well as height ened emotional and intellectual engagement (thus cultural or spiritual capital and power) within and outside explicitly religious contexts. With respect to tapas, beyond the extensive range of comparative applications of asceticism as a cross-cultural category of religious practice, there are innumerable religious and cultural contexts in which austerity, self-disci pline and conditioning are pervasive modes of praxis. This might include athletic modes of physical conditioning and endurance training, such as marathon or triathlon running, aerobic exercise and extreme dieting, which are arguably just as much about obtaining emotional ecstasy or a quasi magical self-control as they are about fitness, health or beauty (Corrington 1986; McGuire 1990). Many of the modern forms of Yoga could arguably be said to fall under this rubric—such as the "hot Yoga" of Bikram Choudhury, which is practiced at high temperatures and thus requires considerable physical and mental fortitude. It could be argued, in fact, that traditions of Yoga that focus on posture (äsana) echo in important ways one of the most ancient strata of yogic or proto-yogic practices of tapas, in which immobility in an (often intentionally) uncomfortable position was utilized as a mode of profitable self-discipline (Knipe 1987). Success in major professional sports—football or cricket, for example— is contingent upon a profound degree of self-discipline and personal</page><page sequence="13">Herbs as a Means to Spiritual Accomplishments in Yogasutra / 49 sacrifice, and the expression of this mastery on the playing field is often perceived as an ecstatic experience for both athlete and spectator (Percy and Taylor 1997). With respect to the focus of this paper, ausadhi, there are many clear associations between the use of medicinal products and heightened per formance in various aspects of life, especially in cosmopolitan contem porary European and American culture; associations which lie beyond the parameters of the question of the legitimacy of religious experiences that are engendered by the use of psychogenic or "entheogenic" sub stances. Many members of contemporary cosmopolitan society look to both allopathic and naturopathic medicines as a means to retain a youthful appearance and to enhance health and well-being. The integration of herbal and traditional remedies into mainstream forms of medical therapy has mounted in recent years. This includes herbal medications that promise improved memory and mental acuity and herbal teas and herbal "power" drinks that are explicitly represented as having a variety of health benefits and perhaps implicitly, in some cases, as having consciousness-altering potential. Similarly, the pervasive access to caffeinated beverages and other stimulant sources in contemporary life points to an assumption, or perhaps a reasoning, that such stimulants enable individuals and commu nities to work more effectively and with greater focus and stamina, tran scending the limits of the natural state of things. Cultic communities sur rounding popular rock bands and rave culture (now pervasive in expatriate communities in India such as Goa, for example) employ psychogenic substances in ritual environments, often replete with religious symbolism, thereby cultivating a feeling of ecstasy and elevating charismatic leaders to positions of power and prestige (Bizzell 2008). Likewise, recent studies have shown that numerous academics and scientists are now using atten tion-deficit medications in order to treat jetlag and to improve cognitive performance and endurance during intensive periods of research (Sahakian and Morein-Zamir 2007). One of the most striking examples of the use of drugs to stretch human limits in contemporary European and American culture is the use of performance-enhancing substances, or "doping," at all levels of athletic competition (Kious 2008). In this instance, we have a practice that is founded on the distinct motivation to move beyond the level of ordinary human capabilities, to break through the boundaries of speed and perfor</page><page sequence="14">50 / Stuart Ray Sarbacker mance, ultimately leading to the attainment of an athletic "cultural immortality" through obtaining Olympic gold or through breaking a performance record. If, as Max Weber argued, charisma is a function of the degree to which a person embodies the powers and authority of the divine or of a superhuman being, athletes themselves become quasi divine through their exceptional athletic feats, demonstrating their gifted ness and setting themselves up as figures of authority and social admiration. Likewise, if there are analogies to be drawn between religious experiences and "peak performance," "flow" or "being in the zone," it should perhaps come as no surprise that both athletes and spectators perceive their chosen sport as nothing short of a sacred enterprise (Csikzentmihalyi 1990; Maslow 1964). That athletes should express their faith fervently on the field follows this logic as well. A last parallel to be made in this applied phenomenological analysis of ausadhi concerns one of the pharmaceutical industry's greatest recent success stories: erectile dysfunction medications. Jolly (1977: 30) notes that there are two types of ausadhi that bring strength. Earlier we men tioned the first, elixirs (rasäyana). The second of these is aphrodisiacs (vâjïkarana). Human concerns with respect to sexuality have not changed over the millennia; rather, we seek out perfection in our experience of this central, and often ecstatic, dimension of human existence. In many contexts in which Yoga is taught, sexual gratification is viewed as a diversion whereby a yogin is "swayed" from the path, a point intimated in Vyäsa's commentary to Yogasütra 3.51. On the other hand, Yoga may well be as strongly associated with householdership as it is with asceticism, especially given the primacy of priestly traditions in preserving the litera ture of Yoga and in the propagation of modern forms of Yoga. It might be argued as well that, in a highly secularized society, sexuality exists as one of the few remaining gates to ecstasy and self-transcendence and is even more explicitly a domain where issues of power, mastery, and deep seated emotive and psychological forces are at work. Following Patanjali, the rules that inform spiritual accomplishments operate on a range of different levels of instantiation. There is continuity between the desire for, and method of obtaining, worldly objects and the analogous pursuit of spiritual goods that have a narrative or mythic locus but are nonetheless real as experienced states attained through transfigura tion and ecstasy. The phenomenology that Patanjali's philosophy offers</page><page sequence="15">Herbs as a Means to Spiritual Accomplishments in Yogasutra / 51 is useful, then, as a framework for understanding a wide range of religious and secular modes of practice that aim at transcending given human con ditions and achieving virtuosity in human experience. It calls for a radical rethinking of the nature of transcendence, and the understanding that the pursuit of transcendence operates on several levels, shedding light on how the camouflaging of the spiritual, to use a notion of Eliade's, happens before our eyes within the domain of secular society. It might even be argued that Patanjali's phenomenology serves as a critique that collapses the categories of the sacred and the secular completely, into a view in which humans and divine beings and powers exist on a scale of poten tiality, with the yogi or yogini illustrating the upper limits of this scale in their embodiment of divine capacities. Spiritual or religious identity as such has as much to do with the psychophysical makeup of human or divine organisms and their particular modes of practice as it has to do with the particular social and cultural situatedness of the practitioners. On the other hand, the virtuosity demonstrated in the attainment of the spiritual accomplishments has an indirect relationship to the moral virtu osity and spiritual insight that is postulated by Patanjali as the goal at the heart of Yoga practice. In other words, the achievement of great discipline, and thus accomplishment, does not necessitate the sort of ultimate spiritual or moral transformation that Patanjali advocates in the Yogasiitra, which is of a different order altogether. In practical terms, this can mean that a virtuoso athlete, just as the virtuoso yogin or yogini, may be incredibly accomplished in one area of mastery and yet profoundly deficient in others, especially with respect to morality or insight. In fact, it can be argued that it is a vital cultural trope in the contemporary context, one that parallels a similar trope in the Yoga literature—that physical virtuosity in athletics and other modern disciplines is conflated with moral virtuosity—to pre dictable, and often unfortunate, effects (Sarbacker 201 lb). 1 believe that Patanjali would further argue that the various means of spiritual accomplishment outlined in Yogasutra 4.1, whether conceived of as from a mundane or a higher order, are flawed to the degree to which they are not performed in service to an overarching orientation toward liberation. As mentioned earlier, in Yogasutra 4.6-7, Patanjali argues that all of the five sources, barring samädhi, ultimately plant seeds of future worldly experience—and therefore a continued relationship with world suffering and rebirth. With respect to samädhi, there is a sugges</page><page sequence="16">52 / Stuart Ray Sarbacker tion of a transcendence of the processes of karma through the formation of "constructed minds" that do not accumulate samskâras, or karmic impressions, hinting at something akin to jïvanmukti, or "liberation in life." This may suggest, in line with Whicher (2008: 259-300), that kaivalya might be considered a radical and dynamic reorientation to the world, rather than a radical separation from it, in which the liberated person (purusa) exists in a stasis-like state. Passages in the Siva Puräna (7.2.38.44—45) and Lihga Puräna (1.9.56-61) seem to suggest just such a possibility: of a kaivalya in which worldly powers are exercised, perhaps as a precursor to a final state of kaivalya at death. Though there might be some grounds to reread the relationship between kaivalya discussed at the end of part 3 (Yogasütra 3.55) and kaivalya as discussed in part 4 of the Yogasütra in light of this dynamic, this is beyond the scope of this paper. Religious Experience, Transcendence, Power The category of "religious experience" is a contested one and used here primarily in an interpretive approach that focuses on the notion that an individual cultivates a targeted state of being or perception that transcends the given boundaries of human agency, such as the cultivation of the siddhis. I would argue that it has a heuristic function or use that outweighs the epistemological concerns of privileging first-person or experiential perspectives, if understood as one aspect within the larger, and multidi mensional, study of religion. In this essay, I have argued that Pâtanjala Yoga philosophy might be conceived of as offering a type of phenome nological paradigm for understanding the cultivation of particular lypes of religious experience and its instantiation in both explicit (sacred) and implicit (secular) forms. Patanjali's analysis, as such, collapses the sacred secular distinction in important ways, opening the door for understanding how various types of practice, and thus virtuosity, in the contemporary context demonstrate the "logic" of spiritual mastery. This is an inherently pluralistic approach in that it recognizes the localized and contextual nature of such practices and experiences, while at the same time leaving open the possibility of profitable cross-cultural comparisons that give perspective to and shed light upon their philosophical and cultural impli cations. Though there may be disagreements in contemporary academic</page><page sequence="17">Herbs as a Means to Spiritual Accomplishments in Yogasutra / 53 scholarship as to how central the pursuit of siddhis is in Pätanjala Yoga and in related traditions of Yoga such as Hathayoga, there is increasing agreement that Patanjali was compelled to recognize that various means for spiritual transformation exist and in fact do work, even if they are not soteriologically efficacious. Patanjali thus acknowledged that the cultiva tion of worldly and spiritual powers was a goal that his contemporaries perceived as worth pursuing, whether or not he viewed it as ultimately important or necessary for spiritual development. Genuine human concerns of life, love and death run through his conceptions of the siddhis, and if they are considered religious concerns, they have to be considered virtually, if not actually, universal in scope. The desire for, and acquisition of, power is clearly not something that will fade from the contemporary religious or secular horizon any time soon. If anything, the philosophical assumptions and implications of ascetic and other modalities of attaining bodily and psychic perfection seem even more relevant in a contemporary cultural environment in which ideologies of individualism infuse globalized and cosmopolitan worldviews and practices. In Indian religious narrative and philosophy, the practice of Yoga is represented as morally ambiguous, as Yoga is viewed as both a vehicle for liberating knowledge and as a basis for power and control over and in the world. Understanding the pursuit of power as a cultural and spiritual phenomenon opens the door to a number of insights into the nature of Pätanjala Yoga, and also, importantly, into how the philosophy of Yoga can be utilized constructively to shed light on various contemporary modes of physical and mental cultivation found in a range of spheres, from athletics and science to health and healing modalities in conventional and alternative medicine, as well as in more clearly defined religious contexts.
