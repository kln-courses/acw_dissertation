<plain_text><page sequence="1">LES ORIGINES DE L'ANALOGIE PHILOSOPHIQUE DANS LES DIALOGUES DE PLATON. By PAUL GRENET. Paris, Boivin &amp; Cie, I948. PP. 300. $3.00. The author of this interesting monograph endeavors to make clear at the outset what he understands by the philosophical use of analogy. In its strict sense, he maintains, the method of analogy means the dis- covery of the unknown by an identity or similarity of relationships. More precisely, if an unknown, x, can be related to three known terms - a, b, c - so as to yield the equation a/b = c/x, then the value or nature of x can be inferred. The philosophical use of analogy differs markedly from its scientific uses. In scientific analogy the objects dealt with belong to the same ontological level, or to levels more or less continuous with the plane of ordinary experience. Thus scientists think of microscopic phenomena by analogy with macroscopic entities whose nature and relationships are given in experience. These microscopic entities, though not given in experience, are continuous with the ob- jects of ordinary experience. But the philosopher and the theologian use analogy to bring together terms that are ontologically very distant 556</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS OF BOOKS from one another. Such terms as God, or the world of pure spirit, which figure in philosophical analogy, have "no conceivable continuity with human experience" (p. i i). Yet analogy permits us to discourse about these transcendent realities in such a fashion as to yield "firm conclusions" (p. I2). How is this possible, if there is no conceivable continuity between the terms involved? Here M. Grenet seems to retreat somewhat from the extreme position just taken. If there were absolutely no ontological or noetic continuity between these realities and the world of our ex- perience, no analogy could lay hold of them (p. 13). There must be some "value" absolutely fundamental, common to both sets of entities, viz., existence. Basing ourselves on this common value, we can pass from this world, by virtue of the necessities implied in being "qua being," to a statement with determinate content concerning the extra- experiential object "qua being." But it must be remembered (the author now retracts his previous concession) that the "value" of "being" cannot be extended to the beyond in the fashion just described except "by benefit of analogy" (p. 13). It appears, then, that the foundation of all rigorous philosophical analogy is the doctrine of the analogical structure in the notion of being. M. Grenet asserts firmly that this doctrine is not to be found in Plato (p. I5). The discovery of it he attributes to Aristotle, and the full development of the analogical method in philosophy to St. Thomas. Nevertheless Plato is important. He stands "at the beginning of the philosophical use of analogy." He found his predecessors and contem- poraries using analogy in particular fields -notably religion, mathe- matics, and art; he saw the "unlimited fecundity" of their methods and "transposed them to the philosophical plane." This is M. Grenet's thesis (p. i6). The exposition of this thesis falls into three parts. The first (pp. 2i-97) deals with the philosophical "transposition" of the analogies used in religion and mythology. Here the author reviews briefly the efforts of Plato's predecessors to describe the nature of the gods and the human soul in terms drawn from human experience, and he shows how Plato (following the example of Xenophanes, Heraclitus, Anax- agoras, and Empedocles) refined this use of analogy by purging the myths of their grosser anthropomorphic elements and by transform- ing certain empirical qualities (e.g., intelligence, nous) to permit of their application to transempirical realities. Next, M. Grenet shows how Plato borrowed from the mathematics of his time the newly for- mulated theory of proportions, and how he frequently employed it both as a method of discovery and as a means of exhibiting unity in multiplicity, through the synthesis of diverse factors into a harmoni- ous whole AEO7ICWV KaLoTrog aivaXo'yla. But Plato failed to recognize 557</page><page sequence="3">THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW explicitly how similarity of relations could carry us beyond the limits of human experience, and in this respect the transposition to the philosophical plane was incomplete. The author points out, however, that Plato's use of mathematical analogy goes beyond that counte- nanced by the mathematicians. His analogies are as much qualita- tive as quantitative (e.g., the famous analogies in the Gorgias, and the proportions of the divided line in the Republic). The third section (pp. I79-225) discusses Plato's transposition of the doctrine of imita- tion in the arts. Plato employed this concept not only in his own phil- osophy of artistic creation, where he gave it a profounder meaning than had ever been suspected by the artists of his time, but even more impressively in his theories of education and legislation, and in his cosmology and metaphysics. M. Grenet's contention that for Plato the genuine artist is an imitator of an "authentic model," i.e., an ideal, seems to me the correct interpretation, despite what Plato says about inferior artists in Republic X. For Plato, all creation, whether in art, in morals, in statesmanship, or in cosmology, is es- sentially the production of an analogue of a higher reality. But the central issue, as presented by M. Grenet in his opening pages, is still to be adjudged. To what extent did Plato use analogy as a means of passing from experienced entities to realities that are completely beyond human experience and have no continuity (or at best an analogical one) with empirical realities? M. Grenet by no means forgets this issue; but here it is difficult to follow him, and consequently difficult to accept his conclusions. He argues that Plato recognized the limitations of human experience (pp. 23ff.), as in a sense no doubt every philosopher has done. But M. Grenet draws these limits unduly close when he says that for Plato not only God but the soul and the Forms lie beyond our comprehension (pp. 62-68). The Forms, it is true, cannot be directly presented in sense experience. But if there is any doctrine of which Plato professes to be certain, it is that we can know what the senses present to us only by apprehending the Forms of which the sense world presents the passing images. If I understand him, the author completely reverses Plato's thought. It is not from our knowledge of empirical objects that we reason, by analo- gy, to the Forms beyond our ken, as I understand M. Grenet to say; rather it is through our apprehension of the Forms that we have any- thing like knowledge of empirical objects. According to M. Grenet, the Forms can only be apprehended by the mediation of concepts drawn from experience (p. 63). These concepts are analogues of the Forms; they are not given in experience, but con- structed by thought, which "follows the traces of the Forms" in sensi- ble objects (p. 64). For this distinction between concepts and Forms there seems to be little foundation in the passages cited, when we make 558</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS OF BOOKS allowance for the fluid character of Plato's terminology. And the dis- tinction itself seems to be of doubtful value as a support to M. Grenet's theory of the transempirical status of the Forms. For the same con- siderations that lead him to put the Forms beyond experience will com- pel us to make concepts also transempirical, and we shall need a further analogy to mediate between concepts and sensible things. On the other hand, if in the construction of concepts our human reason is following the traces of the Forms in sensible things, these Forms them- selves serve as the intermediate terms and therefore can hardly be ele- vated to a transempirical realm above the concepts. There are many fine pages in this book (for example, the chapter on Plato's "imitation" of Socrates), and much valuable material con- cerning the rich and varied uses of analogy in Plato's thought. But with regard to the central issue, I think the author has failed to estab- lish his case. There is, after all, a fundamental difference between the Platonic dualism and the Thomistic distinction between the natural and the supernatural orders, and I am sure M. Grenet would not really wish to obscure this difference. GLENN R. MORROW University of Pennsylvania</page></plain_text>
