<plain_text><page sequence="1">COMMENT Viewpoint â€¢ Abroad VIEWPOINT The Crisis ofNatwulResowces The proud claim of standard economists has always been that it is possible to bring about gen- eral happiness through unlimited accelerated economic growth. But one by one, the foremost supporters of the Keynesian doc- trine - from Paul A. Samuelson and Walter W. Heller to Lawrence R. Klein and Franco Modigliani - have ultimately admitted the failure of that "theory" to deal with chronic unemployment and mounting inflation. In Paul Sam- uelson 's own words, areal malaise has spread throughout the eco- nomics profession. It is worth noting that the pro- fessional laments have acknowl- edged only the fiasco in the mon- etary and financial domain. The questions of increasing popula- tion pressure and of the adequacy of natural resources, for example, have ordinarily been met with persistent silence in economics. The capital sin of standard eco- nomics, however, is its utterly mechanistic epistomology, un- critically inherited from the neo- classical founders for whom eco- nomics had to be "the mechanics of utility and self-interest" (as W. Stanley Jevons proudly pro- fessed). They succeeded so well that the usual argument of "eco- nomic equilibrium" and the jus- tification of static equilibrium in mechanics are formally identical. Absolute reversibility (without any qualitative change) consti- tutes the basis of both. Thus, the economic process is envisioned as a self-sustaining, circular affair, as we find it portrayed graphically in virtually all introductory man- uals. Naturally, there can be no room for natural resources in such a framework; and indeed, they are almost completely ig- nored by standard economics. Two factors may explain the peculiar orientation of standard economics. First, its direct ances- tor - the neoclassical school - emerged at a time when mech- anistic dogma was still in great favor with philosophers and nat- ural scientists. Second, the unique mineral bonanza enjoyed by the Western world (the home of the neoclassical school) since the be- ginning of the past century grew even more bounteous. When one's pantry is more than amply stocked, one is apt to ignore the source of one's fortune. What is indeed hard to explain is the refusal of the economics profession as a whole to see the light even after the plain writing on the wall, or rather at the ser- vice stations: "pumps closed." Even before that, a brief reading of the general history would have sufficed to reveal the crucial role of natural resources in the most important actions of mankind. In addition to the sweeping migra- tions there have been the wars, which generally aimed at the pos- session, at least the control, of resources - at first, for spices, food, and slaves; later, for cheap labor, as well; ultimately, for min- erals of all sorts. The plain lesson of the "limited wars" that have recently studded the earth is that although the battle cry may be "for the glory of God," the driv- ing motive always is economic. The sociology of the intellec- tual professions would explain why, with the symptoms of the crisis becoming increasingly obvi- ous, standard economists have begun proclaiming that there is no reason at all for worry. Such claims follow two main lines. First, there is the notion that "come what may, we shall find a way" to continue growing just as we have done since the time of Pericles. The prominent advocates of this faith are Wilfred Becker- man and John Maddox, both from England, with some influ- ential natural scientists from the 50 Challenge /March- April 1 981</page><page sequence="2">United States joining in support by exclaiming "Enough of pessi- mism." The second position, especially popular with standard theoreti- cians, is that the market mecha- nism can take care of any im- pending ecological crisis. Market prices will always protect scarce resources from complete exhaus- tion, for (as Carl Kaysen and Robert M. Solow advise us) "re- sources are measured in econom- ic, not physical terms." Natural resources differ in no way from ordinary commodities, Solow and Joseph E. Stiglitz hold. Hence, if resources become increasingly scarce, other factors will be con- stantly substituted for them. But since the other factors can be only labor or capital, we must either move toward some sort of Garden of Eden or achieve the conjuring trick of producing more capital with less and less energy and mat- ter. The same defense also claims that the optimal allocation of re- sources between today and to- morrow is again warranted by the movement of a price, the in- terest rate that reflects the price of the present over the future. Bioeconomic evolution In the Eocene period, there lived a quadruped, now called Eohip- pus, whose size was that of a beagle. A series of mutations of its soma (of its endosomatic or- gans) changed that animal into the powerful horse of today. But this change took not less than forty million years. The genus Homo also evolved (and still does) in this manner, yet at a certain moment it transgressed this ex- tremely slow and highly uncer- tain way of progressing. Like many animals, some ancestors of man as far back as two, perhaps even three, million years ago be- gan producing artifacts by which to achieve effects beyond the power of their endosomatic con- stitution. It began as a deliberate and sustained activity which has ever since become a traditional inheritance from one generation to the next. The biological nature of this new mode of life is reflected in several ways. First, the artifacts are nothing but detachable (exo- somatic) organs. Indeed, an in- tellect from a different world may find it difficult to distinguish be- tween the hand that breaks a loaf of bread and the knife that slices it. Also, once the hominid line got into the exosomatic furrow, it could no longer revert to a purely endosomatic existence, any more than the birds could return to the aquatic life from which they evolved. Exosomatic organs have become as essential for mankind's survival as the endosomatic ones. The most primitive communities - say, the Pygmies or the Aus- tralian Arunta - could not sur- vive without artifacts. For more than two million years, the exosomatic organs were made only from things found in the immediate environment - wood, bones, hides, hair, stone, and clay. But about 7,000 years ago, human beings also learned how to use resources from the bowels of the earth, which en- abled them to produce increas- ingly more complex and more powerful exosomatic organs. With these organs we can now run, fly, see, hear, calculate, cut, kill, and so forth, in ways that we could not possibly manage with any en- dosomatic organ alone. Human beings, in general, have thus be- come addicted (in the strongest sense of the term) not only to the conveniences but also to the flimsy and extravagant delights afforded by modern artifacts. Three predicaments Undoubtedly, these achievements are truly marvelous. But our en- thusiasm on this count should not prevent us from seeing that the exosomatic transmutation is the source of some predicaments as well. First, as exosomatic or- gans grew increasingly complex, their production could no longer be supported by the old social organization of the band or the tribe. Production had to be planned, coordinated, and super- vised by some authority. The so- cial organization that emerged then is characterized by a division not of skills (of which Adam Smith spoke), but of roles. This latter division - between "gov- ernors" and "governed" - and hence the social conflict rooted in it, cannot possibly be elimi- nated from an advanced exoso- matic existence, as recent politi- cal history has solidly confirmed. For an arresting counterproof, we may turn to the social insects which know no social conflict simply because, unlike Homo sapiens sapiens, they have reached highly organized production through endosomatic evolution alone. There have always been exo- somatic differences between hu- man communities, just as there have been differences between bi- ological subspecies of the same species. But since mineral re- sources became accessible - and this is the second predicament - exosomatic differences have become constantly more accen- tuated. Their present proportions create an international conflict that, as Carl Kaysen and Leonard Silk have emphasized, should not go unrecognized behind the din made in advanced economies about the decreasing availability of energy. Since these differences March- April 1 981 /Challenge 51</page><page sequence="3">are bioeconomic, the policy of financial transfers practiced for the past thirty years has proved to be utterly inept. Nor would the same differences respond to transfers of technological recipes specific to an entirely different exosomatic structure. The policy based on such transfers is tanta- mount to trying to improve the lot of a fish by grafting a bird's wings onto it. Be that as it may, these inequalities will ultimately soften down: exosomatic muta- tions are diffused through con- tact just as the endosomatic ones are. The last predicament stems from the human addiction to exo- somatic comfort. As in drug ad- diction, the problem hinges on the availability of the material ingre- dients - mineral resources of var- ious sorts. Two physical factors bear heavily upon this problem. They complete the list of the ele- ments that tie up the knot men- tioned at the beginning of this section. The first factor is the finitude of accessible energy and matter in spite of the fact that our space- ship floats on a cosmic sea of these elements. This condition must be well understood. Sup- pose a friend from San Francisco is willing to give me ten gallons of gasoline gratis provided I drive there. Since it would take more than ten gallons to drive from Nashville, the "free" energy of that gasoline is not accessible to me. That is, the energy of some shale oil is not accessible to us, in general, if it takes more energy to extract it than it would yield on extraction. Of course, the frontier of accessibility moves with every advance of efficiency. An ideal engine still cannot travel beyond any limit with a finite amount of free energy. But even with a finite amount of accessible resources there would be no scarcity if it were not for the second factor, the law known as the Law of Entropy. In simple terms, the classical formu- lation of that law states that en- ergy is constantly being degraded from a state useful to man to a completely useless state. This happens whether man uses the energy or not, although deliberate use speeds up the degradation. The anthropomorphic essence of this law is obvious. In fact, ther- modynamics, of which the en- tropy law is one of the most im- portant pillars, emerged as a physics of economic value, a char- acter it has retained to this day. Clearly, it is because of the en- tropy law (in the extended sense to be explained next) that the scarcity of natural resources is far more stringent than that of land in the Ricardian sense, which although it is also limited, is not degraded by use. Matter matters, too People did not wait for Louis Pasteur to discover the cause of fermentation. They have baked bread, brewed beer, and made wine from time immemorial. Sim- ilarly, they did not wait for ther- modynamics, which is only a lit- tle over one hundred years old, to make them see that one has to keep getting wood from the for- est if one wants to have fire: ashes do not burn. They also knew that heat always passes by itself from the hotter to the colder body, never in reverse, long before Rudolph Clausius used this sim- ple truth for a formulation of the entropy law. The undisturbed movements of the planets, however, induced some hopeful minds to believe that a mechanical system, once started, can produce mechanical work by itself indefinitely. It took a rather long time for the sanguine hope of devising such perpetual motion to die. It ulti- mately died only because all at- tempts in that direction failed beyond any doubt. This type of proof - -by failure to produce a refuting case - carries little favor with most exegetes of the legiti- macy of science. The belief in the eventual refutation of the First Law of Thermodynamics (which states that any mechani- cal work can be achieved only by the expenditure of a proportional amount of energy) probably still exists as a latent germ in the backs of many minds. Just con- sider the fact that the same pur- ist epistemology is invoked by many students, thermodynami- cists especially, who now insist that the Second Law of Thermo- dynamics (alias the entropy law) will eventually be invalidated. Curiously, the same stricture is not directed against the law of gravity. Yet just as every observed free object always fell down, nev- er went up, so every time a hu- man hand touched a hot plate it was the hand that was burned, not the plate. The belief that the entropy law is inherently falsi- fiable feeds also on the probabi- listic interpretation of thermody- namic phenomena. According to this interpretation, it is only high- ly improbable, but still possible, for heat to travel by itself from the colder to the warmer body. Then we may certainly hope to make this miracle happen almost at will by some sort of sharper's trick. The main thermodynamic laws, at bottom, express impossibilities. Several negations, for example, are packed into the entropy law. To untangle them, let us consider one of its two fundamental for- mulations: the thermal energy of 52 Challenge /March- April 1 981</page><page sequence="4">a single bath (a source at uniform temperature) cannot be converted into mechanical work by an en- gine working in a cycle. There is a classic illustration, offered by Lord Kelvin, to the effect that it is impossible for a ship's engine to use the thermal energy of sea water, immense though it is. However, without the restriction "working in a cycle," the conver- sion is perfectly possible. One of the expansion phases of any pis- ton-and-cylinder in a heat engine does precisely this: it converts the heat of the boiler into work. Why then do we not use the ocean as a boiler in this way? The answer is that since that conver- sion is based only on expansion, to obtain work uninterruptedly the piston-and-cylinder must be of unlimited length. But we are unable to reach for infinity. Af- ter a reasonable expansion, the piston must be brought back. Simply to reverse the process would not do, for that would can- cel the work produced by the ex- pansion. Fortunately, if the re- versal takes place at a lower tem- perature than the expansion, it uses only a part of that work. We see now why we need an engine working in cycles, and why this engine needs not only a boiler but also a colder condenser. Therefore, the useful work pro- duced even by an ideal engine is not equal to the heat taken from the boiler, but to the difference between that heat and the heat passed into the condenser when the piston is brought back. It is only this difference that (in this particular case) constitutes free or available energy. But in actual- ity, even this amount is not all converted into useful work. Part of it is "wasted." The conven- tional literature mentions only the work against friction as waste, although there is waste through heat leakage as well. This is the first indication that matter matters, too. The cause of these inevitable wastes (as well as others) is not related to energy; their cause is the multiple imper- fections of matter in bulk. In- deed, there is no frictionless mat- ter in bulk, as there is none that creates infinite friction; there is no perfect insulator, nor perfect conductor. But curiously, ther- modynamics stops short of con- sidering what happens to matter, without which no mechanical work can be produced and which dissipates irretrievably just as free energy does. An outsider is thus apt to conclude, as Kenneth Boulding did, that there is no en- tropic degradation of matter. Available and unavailable matter The whole earth is made of mat- ter: therefore, we need not wor- ry about running out of it, runs the argument of some experts. But is the earth not made of en- ergy as well? Clearly, that argu- ment fails to distinguish not only between useful and useless but also between available and un- available matter. We are also told by prominent natural scientists (Harrison Brown and Glenn Sea- borg, among others) that only energy counts, since with enough energy we can always gather, say, all copper molecules dissipated by friction from our pennies and mint them over and over again. It would not do to invoke Ein- stein's famous equivalence here. Matter (not to be confused with mass) cannot be created from scratch by pure energy. From what we know now, the chemical elements must have developed from protons, not only from photons. It is perhaps thought that be- cause one can reassemble the beads of a necklace broken in a room, one can also reassemble all the rubber molecules of a worn- out tire. We may gloss over this unwarranted passage from macro- to micro-structures, but one thought among many others should capture our attention. The suggested operation, if possi- ble at all, would wear out num- berless other material objects that would have to be reconstituted. This unlimited regress would re- quire a virtually infinite time. Of course, one may think of elimi- nating all friction, a main cause of material degradation. This can certainly be done, provided all motions proceed at an infinitesi- mally low speed. But in this al- ternative, any finite motion would take an infinite time. Wherever we turn, therefore, we discover that the thermodynamic impossi- bilities reflect some limitations of human nature. The foregoing observations lead to what I have termed the Fourth Law of Thermodynamics (there is a Third, which is the subject of even more controversy than the First and Second), which is that matter, like energy, is continu- ously and irrevocably degraded from an available into an unavail- able state. Or, to put it differ- ently, perpetual motion of the third kind - by which I mean a system that can exchange only energy with the outside and per- forms work indefinitely at a con- stant rate - is another thermody- namic impossibility. One would, of course, like to have an entropy formula for matter as we have for energy, but this goal seems unachievable. Matter, unlike ener- gy, is irreducibly heterogeneous. The Fourth Law has some fate- ful implications, all apparently ig- nored because of the one-sided orientation of thermodynamics and of the recent concern with March- April 1 981 /Challenge 53</page><page sequence="5">energy alone. From a very long viewpoint, the law speaks against ecological salvation through a steady state. The earth is a vir- tually closed system, so that sooner or later some elements will become totally dissipated. As Preston Cloud, a keen student of the subject, showed, the supply of some metals - silver, zinc, molybdenum, and mercury - will soon reach the pinching stage. The most important implica- tion concerns the solution of our present crisis. The Promethean destiny of the exosomatic Man We can accomplish a material end only if we have a feasible recipe for it. To heat a house by solar radiation or to travel to the moon are feasible recipes. No feasible recipes exist now for digging a tunnel through the center of the earth or for controlling a ther- monuclear reaction. We should also note that if a feasible recipe is to be a faithful description of a material process, it must contain two categories of factors, a dis- tinction which the epistemology of standard economists domi- nated by the flow complex finds it hard to acknowledge. There are, first, the agents (the fund ele- ments) and, second, the flow ele- ments on which the agents act. Next, by "technology" I mean a set of feasible recipes such that there is a recipe for every material commodity, other than natural resources, included in the set. Since all recipes are feasible, if we start with an adequate stock of funds and flow elements as well as the necessary resources, the world's machine can obvi- ously be set in motion for awhile at least. But a point deserving particular emphasis is that a tech- nology (as defined here) is not necessarily viable, in the us- ual meaning of this term. To be viable, a technology must be able to do tomorrow exactly what it has done today. For the purpose of the present argument we may abstract from the real possibility that a Malthusian factor may cause a formerly viable technology to cease being so. We should not ignore, how- ever, the fact that the exhaustion of some vital environmental re- sources would obviously have the same effect. But if the necessary natural resources are still avail- able and all the recipes are feasi- ble, how can a technology not be viable? To elucidate this puzzle I shall use a simple analytical example. Consider a technology in which stone hammers are hammered out of rough stones by other stone hammers (first feasible rec- ipe). The stone hammers are also used to crack wild nuts, on which a naked population feeds (second feasible recipe). Given an ample initial stock of stone hammers, the community can start ham- mering hammers and cracking suf- ficient nuts for their diet. Yet this technology may not necessarily be reproducible after a while, if, for example, a stone hammer dur- ing its useful life cannot finish hammering another hammer. Ob- viously, the initial stock of stone hammers will ultimately dwindle away and the corresponding tech- nology will stop working. Let us assume now that a stone hammer came as an invention in an era of simpler technology in which only selected stones were used directly to crack nuts. If the new stone hammer, hammered by selected stones, could crack more nuts than the selected stones used in its production could, then the invention represents a global improvement of efficiency. 54 Challenge /March- April 1 981 Since 1930, more than 4,000 important American landmarks have been needlessly destroyed ... to say nothing of individual homes, entire sections of our cities. And, more are disappearing every year. The only way to stop this destruction is to get involved. Personally.

This is the case with some new inventions. Yet in- ventors often boast that their in- ventions represent not just a broadening of knowledge, but technical progress as well, even if the method used prior to their in- vention remains more productive. Unfortunately, we are apt to be- lieve such claims because we fail to see the difference between the success of a pure experiment - such as putting a man on the moon, for which neither money nor energy counts - and an in- novation that conserves resources. Another model is still more elucidating in this respect. Let us think of a technology consisting of hammers-alpha hammered from selected stones. There oc- curs an invention of a hammer- beta that can be hammered by the hammers-alpha from rough stones instead of selected stones. The likely claim now is that the in- vention has opened the way to using an alternative resource, an idea that has taken hold these days. The pertinent issue, however, is whether the invention can save the scarcer resource - selected stones. There is no principle on which we can base a general an- swer. The hammers-alpha used in producing one hammer-beta may very well be capable of cracking more nuts than the latter. Ac- cording to an argument I pre- sented a few years ago, the pattern of this latter case fits the case of solar collectors, which all produce less utilizable energy than the en- ergy currently used in their pro- duction. The fact that some find it profitable to produce collectors for heating homes and others buy them does not disprove my argu- ment. As simple algebra shows, the fact that these collectors in- volve an excessive consumption of fossil fuels does not prevent their having a valid market price. This does not mean that the high cost of other collectors is not a symptom of their present techno- logical uselessness. Reasoning about the efficiency of a tech- nology on the basis of the pre- vailing prices is full of pitfalls; the most salient case is the notion that if the price of mineral oil in- creases beyond the current cost of oil from biomass, the tables will turn. Feasible recipes versus viable technologies An extremely careful scholar, Denis Hayes, claimed a few years ago that solar technology is here; we can use it now. The foregoing remarks show that only some feasible recipes are here but not yet a viable technology. In order to have a viable solar technology, some types of solar collectors must reproduce themselves with the aid of solar radiation alone. The fact that such a feat has not been achieved even in a pilot plant, although it would clearly repre- sent some net saving and although the Energy Research and Devel- opment Agency (ERDA) and oth- er institutions have spent substan- tial amounts to sell solar energy as an alternative, is sufficient proof that solar technology is not a reality. As things stand now, all feasible solar recipes are parasites of the current technology and, like all parasites, could not sur- vive the disappearance of their host. The essence of the point just made applies to any so-called al- ternative source of energy. The world now possesses a vast park of industrial installations which can be used for a broad spectrum of products. They can be used for producing gasohol, for in- stance, which is now hailed as the surest saving alternative. But no one seems to ask whether the gasohol thus produced will suffice to reproduce the material scaf- fold of the process that has pro- duced it. If this question were asked for all known procedures it would be understood why the fossil fuels have represented a truly extraor- dinary bonanza so far. Viable technologies based on solar radi- ation or on nuclear reactions re- quire immense amounts of mat- ter for their scaffolds - the for- mer for concentrating a low in- tensity, the latter for constrain- ing a dreadfully high intensity. Only fossil fuels can be used with smaller installations, in some cases with virtually none at all. In times of crisis, such as the present, when numberless claims, both interes- ted and unfounded, are likely to clog our perspective, it is impera- tive to keep asking this question, because from all I have said above, matter seems to be a technolog- ical factor as crucial as energy. It is beyond doubt that the present bonanza will end rather soon. To dance around the com- puters hoping to find out exactly when it will end or what the se- quel may be is misleading. His- torical uncertainty of this sort cannot be foreseen by transistors. The exosomatic evolution alone can reveal to us the nature and the possible unfolding of the pres- ent crisis. But we must not con- fine our analysis only to the Fos- sil Fuel Age, as Harold Barnett and Charles Morse have done. What happened during that spe- cial period cannot be extrapo- lated beyond it. The future will certainly be different if a differ- ent source of energy becomes the basis of our technology. March- April 1 981 /Challenge 55</page><page sequence="7">Only two innovations The spectacular innovations of recent times have so impressed us that we have failed to realize that only two, rather old, innovations have represented truly crucial steps in the exosomatic evolution. First, there was the discovery of how to make and use fire. Fire represents a qualitative energy conversion, the conversion of the chemical energy of combustible materials into caloric power. Moreover, fire leads to a chain re- action: with just a small flame we can cause an entire forest, nay, all forests to burn. Fire en- abled man not only to keep warm and to cook, but, above all, to smelt and forge metals, and to bake bricks, ceramics, and lime. No wonder the ancient Greeks attributed to Prometheus - a demigod, not a mortal - the bringing of fire to man. We may refer to the technology opened by Prometheus I, as he should be called, as the Wood Age. For cen- turies, wood served as the only source of caloric power, so that, with continuous industrial devel- opment, forests began disappear- ing with increasing speed. During the second half of the seventeenth century, the cutting of forest trees had to be regulated, even restricted, both in England and on the Continent. Coal was al- ready known as a source of calo- ric power, but one obstacle pre- vented its substitution for wood in industry. Any mine becomes quickly flooded, and the power required to drain it was not avail- able from the sources used at that time - the muscular power of humans and beasts of burden, the wind, and the running water. The impending crisis was entirely analogous to the present impasse: the technology based on wood was running out of fuel. Second* there was the ingenious, unpredictable solution brought by another Prometheus, Prome- theus II - actually, two mortals, Thomas Savery and Thomas New- comen. They invented the heat engine, Which, exactly like fire, has enabled man to perform an entirely novel qualitative energy conversion: the conversion of caloric power into motor power. Also, like fire, the steam engine leads to a chain reaction. With just a little coal and a steam en- gine we can mine more coal and also other minerals from which to make several steam engines, with which we can make more and more steam engines. This gift of Prometheus II en- abled man to derive motor power from a new as well as more inten- sive source - the fire fed by min- eral fuels. We still live mainly in that technology, characterized by the production of work from heat. At the origin, electricity it- self comes mainly from heat. The problem now is whether a new Prometheus can arrive to help us out of this crisis as Prometheus II helped us out of the crisis of the Wood Age. The breeder reactor which converts fertile materials into fissionable fuels would be a third Promethean gift if its prac- tical implementation were not beset by still greater risks and even technical snags. Indeed, there have been recent doubts that the physical plant of a breeder, like my illustrative hammer, can re- produce itself. The high hopes once surrounding controlled ther- monuclear energy have almost faded away. It is not at all ex- cluded that thermonuclear ener- gy, like gunpowder and dynamite, may serve only to make bombs. The situation may change sud- denly. And it is not pessimistic to point out that no one can be sure one way or the other, nor can anyone be sure about the na- ture of the future Promethean gift (if it is to come). To wit, neither Galileo, nor Huygens, nor New- ton himself was able to think of a solution to the Wood Age crisis. Nor can we command the com- ing of Prometheus III, as former Vice-President Mondale seemed to intend at a Governors' Confer- ence when he said: "The country that developed synthetic rubber overnight during World War II [and] put man on the Moon must now create an Apollo Proj- ect to produce alternative fuels." The only reasonable strategy - to say "rational" would be utter intellectual arrogance - is conser- vation. This would gain us as much lead time as possible either to wait for the uncertain Prometheus III, or to change without great convulsions from the present high level of industrial activity to one probably analogous, but not identical, to that of the past Wood Age. Contrary to what we may be- lieve or are made to believe, con- servation does not have to be an unbearable reduction of basic conveniences, even with the nec- essary reduction of exosomatic inequalities between nations. We have lived for millennia without golfcarts, without two-car ga- rages, without Concordes. Let us feverishly hope that we can also live without any kind of means for killing ourselves. Certainly, conservation is not the business of a few nations on- ly. It is a program for the entire human species, which can be un- dertaken if Homo sapiens sapiens is really sapiens. Otherwise, we shall not need a Prometheus to bring us a new fire, but one to re- make us from our own ashes.
