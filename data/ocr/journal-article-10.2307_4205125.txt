<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Parnassianism of Kostis Palamas S. A. SOFRONIOU Kostis Palamas is considered to be one of the foremost poets of modern Greece. Probably a descendant of the great Byzantine hesychast Gregory Palamas, he was born in 1859 at Patras in the Peloponnese. He came of a middle-class family, but he lost both his father and mother early in life and went to live with an uncle at Missolongi. There he received his education at the local gymnasium, and also benefited from the company of his cultured uncle. His early literary education consisted of foreign and Greek romantic works, especially Victor Hugo's Les Miserables and P. Soutsos's Byronic poem cO Odhoiporos'. In 1875 he went to Athens to study law at the Kapodistrian university, of which he was later to be secretary. In Athens, where he stayed in Socratic immobility till his death in 1943, he became acquainted with contemporary European literature, mainly through the French language which he started to learn at a very early age, but also through the general milieu of the Greek capital which was trying to become a second Paris. The literary centre of Athens was the club Tarnassos' which was the scene of heated discussions on poetry and art by such Western-minded critics as E. Rhoidis, A. Vlachos and J. Papadiamantopoulos (Jean Moreas). These critics were trying to settle literary questions according to the dicta of the fathers of French and European criticism such as Sainte-Beuve, Taine and even the philosopher Hegel; and Palamas must have been dazzled by their erudition and knowledge of things foreign. He tried to emulate them by close study of the originals, and he thus acquired the theoretical background which enabled him to assume the leadership of a group of young writers who were destined to bring something new into modern Greek literature. The group is known as the new school of Athens, and its aim was to resolve the impasse into which Greek literature had been led by the contradiction inherent in the theory and practice of the older writers, who were attempting to write romantic poetry and prose in the most pseudo-classical language, the purist cathareuousa. Its mem? bers, who began to write around 1880, realised that a literary change must start with a change in language, and they therefore decided to use the demotic or popular language in their compositions. Their immediate purpose was to break away from the style of their</page><page sequence="2">THE PARNASSIANISM OF KOSTIS PALAMAS 167 predecessors; and since they identified purism with romanticism, they also turned against romanticism in general and the romantic excesses of rhetorical diffuseness and redundancy in particular. In doing so, they could hardly have failed to perceive that a similar reaction against romanticism had already developed in France among the rising generation of Parnassian poets; and it was natural for them to follow the example of these French Parnassians in their own struggle. If a revolt was called for in France where romanticism could be creative, it was even more necessary in Greece where pseudo-romanticism prevailed. French Parnassianism also had cer? tain special attractions for the young Greek demotic poets, among them its predilection for classical and Hellenistic Greece. Through their own exploitation of Parnassian classical subjects, the demotic poets may have been anxious to show that they were no less Greek than the purists who tried to emphasise their Greekness merely by using archaic language and to monopolise classical Greek culture by accusing the demoticists of treachery to Greece and its glorious traditions. Palamas was in the vanguard of the movement together with three other poets, G. Kampas, G. Drossinis and J. Gryparis, and the publisher L. Koromilas. Between 1885 and 1912 they and others translated a number of works by the leading French Parnas? sian poets and published them in such magazines as Rampagas, Mi Chanesai, Estia and Noumas. They also reinforced these translations by conscious literary propaganda. Palamas, who became undisputed leader of the new school, was the first Greek critic clearly to expound Parnassian ideas. In 1887 he published an article in Estia on Leconte de Lisle on the occasion of his election to the Academie Francaise. He described him as an 'excellent poet' but added that he was unknown because he was inaccessible to the people. He affirmed that the Parnassian poets, of whom Leconte de Lisle was leader, were characterised by the 'plastic beauty of their verses' and their admiration for classical Greece, that like Flaubert and Renan, Leconte de Lisle was a supporter of Timpersonalite dans l'art' and of 'contempt for the crowd' and that 'only the few initiated could appreciate art'.1 He added admiringly that Leconte de Lisle 'combined science and poetry in an amazing unity'?a combination which Palamas himself was ambitious to achieve?and he concluded his article by suggesting that the modern Greek poets should imitate him, especially in the choice of classical Greek subjects, in which connection he alluded to the example of A. Chenier.2 1 It is obvious that in this article Palamas is quoting the ideas of Lemaitre on the subject, especially as expounded in Lemaitre's essay on neo-Hellenism. 2 It is significant that soon afterwards Palamas discovered a Greek A. Chenier in A. Kalvos.</page><page sequence="3">l68 THE SLAVONIC REVIEW In 1892 Palamas expounded more Parnassian ideas in the intro? duction to his poetic collection Matia tis Psychis mou. He says, with Parnassianism evidently in mind: 'As we approach modern times we see that poetry becomes more oligarchic'; and he proclaims the Parnassian and aestheticist principle that the poet works 'neither for the many nor for the few, but for art'. The same year he pub? lished an essay in Estia on Francois Coppee in terms common to Parnassian criticism and especially that of Theophile Gautier. He extolled Coppee's poetry 'especially for the beauty of the form and the art of versification through which the poems are transformed into precious jewels as if they were wrought by goldsmiths, an art which mainly characterises the French poetic school of the Parnas? sians'.3 In an essay on the contemporary Greek poet, K. Krystallis, published in 1894, he repeated some of the Parnassian ideas which characterised what he termed 'pictorial or graphic' poetry. The poetry of Krystallis belonged to this genre and was related to the 'artistic and precise Parnassians of France'.4 Palamas also trans? lated Leconte de Lisle's 'Hypatie' at this time and published it in Estia. In speaking of Leconte de Lisle in the introductory note, he spoke also of himself, because in 1899 he repeated almost the same words in the 'Dedication' of his long poem 'The Dodecalogue of the Gipsy'. 'The loves of Leconte de Lisle', he wrote, 'are the inex? haustible ideas of philosophy and the immortal persons of bygone ages, the heroes of myth and history.' In general, Palamas and most of his disciples can be said to have remained Parnassian till the first decade of the 20th century. In 1898 Palamas declared that 'art has nothing in common with morality' and that 'a work of art is alien to the common people'.5 These ideas coincided with his period of anti-social pessimism and sense of isolation and apartness which fell mainly between 1897 and 1907. In 1899 he maintained that poetry is characterised by 'its inde? pendent existence', that it is 'without any aim or utility', and that as with the ancients 'its final aim is surprise'.6 In 1900, when writing about aristocracy in art in the magazine To Periodicon mas, he enumerated almost all the main Parnassian poets and ended with the remark that the poet's contempt for the people is one of the condi? tions of artistic creation. II This attitude is reflected in his poems of these years which naturally contain many Parnassian elements. They constitute primarily an 3 K.

He admits that the writers whom he most admired were Victor Hugo, Leconte de Lisle, and Sully Prudhomme, and it is significant that they should have been the three leading French epic writers of the 19th century. His themes of progress, perfectibility and the supremacy of science are those of most Parnassian poets. He also exhibits the favourite Parnassian attitudes and themes of 'tableaux des religions et des civilisations mortes, hostilite au christianisme, espoir d'une prochaine regeneration, foi absolue a la science'.7 Most of his poetry of this period belongs to the specifically Parnassian tradition of 'petites epopees lyriques' in which he travels to bygone and exotic places to find a framework and terms of reference for his thought and emotions. His manner is also in many cases a balanced combination of the Parnassian dexterity and restraint with romantic expansiveness. His best work, which was written during his most Parnassian period from 1897 to 1907, includes his three greatest collections of poetry, Iamboi kai Anapaestoi (1897), Asaleute %oe (l9?4)&gt; and 'Dode- calogue of the Gipsy' (1899-1907). In the short, economical and precise pieces of Iamboi kai Anapaestoi, he developed many of the themes which occupied most of his subsequent poetry: his sense of isolation, the cruel aspect of nature, the magic of pictorial land? scapes, the deification of the sun, his anti-Christian paganism, the evocativeness of the classical world, and the primacy of form in artistic creation. Asaleute Zoe ('Immovable Life') is his most Parnassian and probably his best collection. It is the most refined and sober of all his poetry and really possesses some of the immovable majesty of ancient statues. The very first verses of the collection are significant: Kai r* dyaXfx dycoviorrjKa yid to volo vd TrXdaco arrjv irirpa rr] Slkt] fiov dirdvo) . . ,8 The Parnassian tenet of the exclusive permanence of art is expressed in the following stanza, which clearly echoes Gautier's UArt, part of which Palamas translated into prose.

It abounds in such epithets as ypapipieva, oiraXXevia, apLaXropidy- ovXa, KpvaraXXevia, dadXevra, i^eoKeira, eXe&lt;j&gt;avTeviat XevKOTTerpf], pLappuap- evia, dradXtva, xaXKOTTpdcriva, irpdaiva . . ,1X The 'Dodecalogue of the Gipsy' is the most ambitious of his efforts. Palamas regarded it as the work which integrated all his ideas, and it can be described as a lyrical epic, or rather as a collection of twelve lyrical 'petites epopees' which form a whole mainly through their hero, the rebellious gypsy. It thus follows the plan of Sully Prud- homme's epics in particular and those of the Parnassian and some romantic poets in general. But it belongs to the Parnassian tradition of'petites epopees' not only in this general sense. Much of its content is also strictly in the Parnassian tradition. The favourite theme of Parnassian epic writers was the story of human decadence, and Palamas applied the theme to the particular case of Greece. His optimistic vein and prophesy of a regeneration are also common to French epicists such as Chenier, Hugo, Ban- ville and Sully Prudhomme, and his hero belongs to a definite French and Western tradition. The unconventional and iconoclastic gipsy is of purely romantic and Parnassian ancestry, including Lara, ? 'Even as now, in the soil of age-old Knossos/so many thousands of years ago/women, men, roses and nightingales/ fell in love in April and in May./Even as now, the arts and the laws were flourishing/Wisdom in the heart and Minos on the throne./Even as now, oh artist, you carved a lily on a stone./All has gone, the lily has remained' (Asaleute Zoe-&gt; Athens, 1904, p. 28). 10 'Oh! my Muse, all imagine you to be of marble/that half-reveals a carved idea/hard for the world to approach and ungraceful/and here and there beautiful for a few only./ And yet none has found the way/to put his ear to the marble figure/to hear a heart? beat/which tolls like a death-knell' (op. cit., p. 106). 11 'etched, opaline, enamelled, crystal, immovable, bare, ivory, marble-white, marble, steely, bronze-green, green'.</page><page sequence="6">THE PARNASSIANISM OF KOSTIS PALAMAS 171 Don Juan, Hernani, Rastignac, and particularly Hugo's 'Titan Phtos' and Leconte de Lisle's (as well as Byron's) 'Qain'. The first lay 'O Erchomos' forms the historical setting for the whole of the 'Dodecalogue of the Gipsy'. This was Byzantium during its most decadent period, and in this connection it must be remem? bered that the Parnassians had a predilection for decadent civilisa? tions such as the Hellenistic. The second lay 'Douleutes' deals rather independently with the problem of art and emphasises the Parnassian tenet of the uselessness of art and the futility of its efforts to become socially significant and useful. It also repeats the theme of the isolation of the gipsy-artist who in many respects is Palamas himself. The third lay 'Agape' strikes some new and melodious notes on the romantic and Parnassian theme ofmulier hominis confusio. The fourth lay 'O Thanatos ton Theon' develops the Hegelian and characteristically Parnassian theme of the death of the gods. It exhibits what has been aptly called with reference to the French Parnassians 'un immense ruisselement des dieux'12 and is exemplified in Hugo's Legende des Siecles, Leconte de Lisle's 'Qain' and Louis Menard's 'Promethee Delivre'. It summarises, in fact, the idea that God is an anthropomorphic creation of man. The next two lays, 'O Thanatos ton Archaeon' and 'Gyro se mia Photia', describe the death not so much of the ancient classical tradition as of its pseudo- classic followers. Palamas refers also to the modern pagans, the polytheists, with Menard and his neo-pagan circle of French Parnas? sians as well as his own earlier self definitely in mind. He now says that classical Greek life and religion cannot be fully resuscitated. In the seventh lay 'To Panegyri tis Kakavas' he develops the theme of the death of the fatherlands in a riot of words and images. Next, in 'Prophetikos', he takes up the Nietzschean and Orphic theme of the eternal reappearance of everything and applies it to the history of Greece, prophesying the imminent upward path which will follow the long and unhappy downward path. It may not be accidental that the same view of history and life is expounded in two of his favourite French poems, Leconte de Lisle's 'Qain' and Hugo's 'Ce que dit la bouche d'Ombre'. The ninth lay 'To Violi' re-examines the problem of art and stresses its redemptive and unique power, in which con? nection it has always to be remembered that the main and perhaps the only preoccupation of Palamas was with the aesthetic. The tenth lay 'Anastasimos' tries to rehabilitate all the previously rejected idols through the supreme power of art, while the eleventh 'To Paramythi tou Adakrytou' recounts the lives of two new characters called Adakrytos and Aghelaste, who never cry and never laugh and 12 H. Peyre, 'The Literature of the Second Empire' (Symposium, VII, i, Syracuse University, New York, 1953, p. 27).</page><page sequence="7">172 THE SLAVONIC REVIEW are two ruthless and rebellious supermen, akin to the gipsy. The last lay 'Cosmos' tries to expound an evolutionary pantheism. It contains a deification of science and is not unrelated to Menard's 'Promethee Delivre' where the final optimism when Prometheus is unbound is linked with the reign of science. III The prodigious literary output of Palamas includes many other collections of poetry, an abundance of literary criticism, auto? biographical essays, short stories, translations from the French, and a rather static play. The mass of material available makes it all the harder to detect specific literary influences, especially as Palamas had a catholic and everchanging intellect and believed in the Hege? lian antithesis and the beauty of contradictory truths. He also said himself that his literary influences were innumerable. But it is clear nonetheless that the influence of Leconte de Lisle and Sully Prud- homme was predominant. Like Leconte de Lisle, Palamas felt intense anti-social pessimism and possessed vast erudition which ranged from the Orphics to Indian philosophy and religion. He never concealed his indebtedness to Leconte de Lisle and often quoted from his critical writings and poetry. He often voiced two of Leconte de Lisle's favourite ideas: that 'toute vraie et haute poesie contient une philosophic'; and that the poet is a philosopher without a philosophy, which Palamas expresses as 'Poetry is metaphysics without any system'.13 He echoed him again in affirming that 'Pessimism is not a philosophical chimaera but the only true interpretation of the world'.14 He also borrowed an image from Leconte de Lisle when in emphasising the superiority of the artist he said that the artist is like Orpheus, 'raised up to Olympus with his feet on the earth without however seeing it'.15 When he wants to stress his idea that poetry is the 'condensed meaning of the effects of events', he similarly takes his example from Leconte de Lisle by commenting: 'It is something like the daemonic dog of Count Magnus'.16 When he says that in Leconte de Lisle's poetry 'the epic subject-matter serves a lyrical mood',17 he describes his own poetry at the same time. The allegorical lyrics of the two poets also contain a number of similarities: both dramatise the death of the many religions of man; both try to evoke the details and the spirit of remote ages through excessive and precise description; 13 K.

'Qain' with its atheistic rebelliousness is one of Leconte de Lisle's poems which particularly influenced the work of Palamas. Celui qui m'engendra m'a reproch^ de vivre Celle qui m'a con$u ne m'a jamais souri, Qain says: and the heroes of Palamas have the same background. The words 'Toi qui n'as jamais cru, ni jamais espere' also suggest the following in the 'Dodecalogue': Kal pbat,l p? avro od vayaoav Xlyo Xlyo Kai ttjv eyvoia . . .18 The general similarity between Qain and the gipsy cannot be over? emphasised, while Adakrytos recalls the parricide son of Djihan in Leconte de Lisle's poem 'Djihan-Ara'. The theme of the 'Chains' in Asaleute Zoe may als? originate from parts of 'Qain', especially from lines such as 'il songe que la terre immense est sa prison', or from verses of other poems such as 'Toi qui veux etre libre et qui baises ta chaine',19 or La vieille illusion fait de nous sa pature; Nul captif n'atteindra le seuil de sa prison.20 Some other poems of Leconte de Lisle such as 'Khiron' may have given Palamas ideas about prehistoric Greece which he put to admirable use in 'Ascraios' in Asaleute %pe. It may not be without significance in this respect that Leconte de Lisle translated Hesiod of Ascra. It has also to be remembered that he translated the Orphic hymns, which Palamas could probably understand better in French than in classical Greek. Palamas undoubtedly owes much to Leconte de Lisle's classical erudition and mythological allusions and also to Leconte de Lisle's Buddhism which he occasionally echoes himself. He would never have brought such Indian personages as Vishnu and Krishna, or introduce concepts such as Maya and Nirvana into his poetry and might even have known nothing of them if they had not first been mentioned by Leconte de Lisle and other Parnassian poets. Leconte de Lisle's lamentations at the eclipse of classical Greece such as 'Pharmonieuse Hellas . . . /Git muette a jamais au bord des mers sacrees'21 are echoed by Palamas in eH 'EXAdSa pud kl dyvpcorrj 18 '. . . and with that they seemed as though they had lost/little by little their care as well' ('The Dodecalogue of the Gipsy', Athens, 1907, p. 31). 19 Leconte de Lisle, Poemes Barbares, Paris, 1886, p. 237. 20 Ibid., p. 244. 21 Leconte de Lisle, Poemes Antiques, Paris, 1884, p. 311.</page><page sequence="9">174 THE SLAVONIC REVIEW Trdet Kai vd rr\v /cAafr,22 while the 'vii Galileen' of 'Hypatie' has its counterpart in the anti-Christian moments of both Asaleute %oe and the 'Dodecalogue'. There are other occasional echoes of Leconte de Lisle in Palamas. Thus his 'et les portes criaient en tournant sur leur gonds'23 is probably the prototype of: Kl ol xa^K?VL?? iropres rpl?av? rpi^Lfjbo od vd fioyyit;av2* while phrases of his such as 'reve d'un reve', 'demain tu serais venu tard', 'peuple impur' reappear in Palamas. The adoration by Palamas of the mountains, especially those of Thrace, as 'berceaux de races purs' definitely derived from Leconte de Lisle; and it seems that it was not only Gautier's 'tzigane' but Leconte de Lisle's Jesabel who sait obscurcir la lune et le soleil Et courber les lions au joug de ses caresses25 who contributed to the powers of Palamas's 7T?p8'K6orrjdrj roLyKava.2* Leconte de Lisle also influenced Palamas with his metrical liberties and innovations. Palamas expressed admiration for Leconte de Lisle's bold use of the alexandrine, saying Tn his "Poemes Barbares" alone I found many verses with irregular caesurae'.27 He himself took similar liberties with the Greek form of the alexan? drine, the fifteen-syllable line, beginning in the Matia tis Psychis mou and culminating in the Flogera tou Vasilia. It seems that although he was not unacquainted with Dante, his use of the terza rima in the sixth book of the Politeia kai Monaxia and in the Satyrica Gymnasmata derives from Leconte de Lisle, the greatest representative of this verse-form in French literature. Hardly less important was Sully Prudhomme's influence on Palamas. When Sully Prudhomme died in 1907 Palamas wrote a poem about him which said that Sully Prudhomme had been his favourite poet since he was twenty. In his autobiographical self- exegesis entitled 'Footroads', he wrote that he always 'felt a special attraction for the verses of Sully Prudhomme because he was a philosopher-poet, i.e. a great poet'.28 His predilection for him is further shown by the fact that in Xanatonismeni Mousiki, a collection of his translations of foreign poems, he included more poems by Sully Prudhomme than by any other poet. 22 'Greece is gone for good never to return and you should weep for her.' 23 Leconte de Lisle, Poemes Barbares, p. 4. 24 'And the bronze doors creaked with a creaking as though they groaned' ('The Dodecalogue of the Gipsy', p. 75). 25 H.

He seems to have accepted and at times applied Sully Prudhomme's dangerous doc? trines that 'on peut confier aux vers outre tous les sentiments, presque toutes les idees',29 and that 'la beaute de l'idee n'a pas besom de la metaphore'.30 Thus, he made direct use of Sully Prudhomme's (as indeed Victor Hugo's) abstract terms of'Justice', 'Liberte', 'Verite', etc., and echoed even his prosaic exclamations 'O Rousseau', 'O Descartes' in TQ Etvo^dvq, *Q nappbeviS-q, rQ 'EfiTrehoKXrj.31 Their allegorical epics are also akin and deal with human destiny ('Le Bonheur') and with Greek destiny ('Dodecalogue'). The aim of Faustus and Stella in 'Le Bonheur' to create a new and superior human race also has its counterpart in the plans of Adakrytos and Aghelaste. The very names 'Adakrytos' and 'Aghelaste' apparently originate in a poem of Sully Prudhomme which Palamas translated thus: ol evTVXLOfievoL ?k?lvol, ol dSaKpvroL kl ol dye'Aaoroi.32 The 'Palm Tree' of Asaleute Zoe *s fu^ ?f ^e same pantheism and sense of mystery as Sully Prudhomme's 'Le Tourment Divin', while 'Chains' may owe something to Sully Prodhumme's fine, 'Le monde au tour de nous est plein d'un bruit des chaines'.33 The hymns of Palamas to the sun may also derive from similar poems by Sully Prudhomme; for example: Soleil! Gloire k toi, le vrai pere Source de joie et de beaute D'energie et de nouveaute Pour qui tout s'engendre et prospere.34 Palamas shares Sully Prudhomme's rather naive admiration for science and the Pascalian idea of the supremacy of the heart, though he himself tries to subordinate the heart to the brain. His metaphor of a Woman Sphinx for nature is also to be found in Sully Prud? homme, as well as in Hugo and Mme Ackerman. He likewise followed Sully Prudhomme's example of addressing future genera? tions on numerous occasions, and imitated his efforts to write poetry on scientific themes. But in the main Sully Prudhomme's influence on Palamas was linked with the obsession of Palamas for writing philosophic poetry. In this respect Sully Prudhomme's influence was harmful, though the philosophic poetry of Palamas himself is rarely so disastrously 29 J.

The influence of the earlier Sully Prudhomme, though less strong, was more propitious and fruitful: e.g. the influence of'Vaines Tendresses', and 'Solitudes', of the sustained metaphors and symbols for the delicate and simple situations of everyday life, of love, school life, the 'incurable envie de quelque paradis lointain', the recovery from 'les chagrins de la veille' by the sight of 'un lila, un nuage, une onde, un bruit d'abeille'. In his attempt to write philosophic poetry Palamas was naturally attracted to two Parnassian poets with obvious philosophic preten? sions, Mme L. Ackerman and J. Lahor, for whom he more than once expressed his admiration. He even rated Mme Ackerman with Vigny, and her Poesies Philosophiques had the same kind of influence on him as those of Sully Prudhomme. Lahor must have been one of the sources of his interest in Buddhism and Hinduism, and it appears that his 'Palm Tree' owes something to Lahor's 'L'Illusion' with its pantheistic and passionate description of the feelings of plants. Another contemporary French poet to influence him was J. Richepin whom he described as 'most Lucretian' and as 'the poet of the atheists and the dispossessed'.35 It is clear that he was attracted by Richepin's philosophic intentions, as he admits when he says in speaking of 'Les Blasphemes': 'the introduction of the book shows that it was planned work ... an example ... of a certain philosophic lyricism'.36 He would certainly include in this category La Legende des Siecles, Poemes Barb ar es, 'Justice', and his own 'Dodecalogue'. The 'Dode- calogue' in fact owes a great deal to the poetry of Richepin and shares its contempt for the life of the bourgeoisie, its rebelliousness, its atheism (a great part of Blasphemes is devoted to the 'Mort des Dieux'), and its apotheosis of vagabonds and gipsies. The description of the gipsies in Palamas sounds like a free rendering of passages such as the following in which Richepin describes his 'Touraniens': Ils allaient, eternels coureurs toujours en fuite Insoucieux des morts, ne sachant pas les dieux, et massacraient gaiment, pour les manger ensuite Leurs enfants mal venus et leurs parents trop vieux.37 IV Palamas had many teachers in poetry: 'ten, twenty and even more', he says. Prominent among them were French epic writers of the 19th century and particularly the leading French Parnassians. Palamas can be said to have shared their merits and might never 36 K.

At the same time he also shared their faults and in particular was led very much astray by his admiration for the so-called philosophic poetry of Sully Prudhomme and Mme Ackerman. But although Parnassianism was a cardinal and formative in? fluence on Palamas, his contribution to modern Greek literature cannot be defined in terms of this influence alone. No other Greek writer equalled him in adaptability and universality, and at his best moments, which were numerous, he was either wholly original and in the tradition of Greek folk poetry or was able to transform the influences on him in a purely personal way. The intensely lyrical pieces of the Iamboi kai Anapaestoi, of the Asaleute Zoe and of parts of his other collections, together with the lighter interludes of the epically conceived 'Dodecalogue of the Gipsy' and the Flogera tou Vasilia, while essentially in the Parnassian tradition, are entirely his own and form some of the highest poetic achievements of modern Greek literature. In power and originality they rank with such other modern Greek achievements as the works of D. Solomos, K. Kavaphis and G. Seferis.</page></plain_text>
