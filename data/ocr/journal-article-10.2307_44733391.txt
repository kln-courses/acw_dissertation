Shot in Alaska's Katmai National Park, Grizzly Man's footage documents Timothy Treadwell's determi- nation to share a summer home with grizzlies- a determination that ends in his violent death.

It is tempting to read Herzog's film as a tale of individual madness and self-destruction, and Jacquet's as a heartwarming story of a community's collective triumph. With their antithetical themes of chaos and order, unsuccessful bonding and stable kinship, and unex- pected death and miraculous life, these films appear to be as opposite at the level of narrative as they are geographically. Grizzly Man's Timothy Treadwell lived among grizzlies for thir- teen summers, documenting the last five with over 100 h of film footage. In winters, Treadwell worked with the environmental non- profit he founded, Grizzly People, to promote awareness of bear- related environmental issues. Late in his final season in Alaska, in October of 2003, a grizzly killed and partially ate both Treadwell and his girlfriend, Amie Huguenard, who was living there with him. Herzog's film juxtaposes Treadwell's own footage with interviews with local Alaskans, Treadwell's friends and colleagues at Grizzly People, and even the coroner who handled the couple's remains. Although Treadwell was able to successfully reside in close quarters with the bears for many summers, Herzog's film implies that this was little more than dumb luck; Herzog works hard to convince his audience of wild nature's inherent danger and "overwhelming indif- ference" to humanity. Accordingly, the bears depicted in Grizzly Man are aggressive, volatile predators. Massive, unpredictable, strong, and occasionally violent, the grizzlies become Herzog's metonyms for wild nature. Despite Herzog's ideological heavy-handedness, the layers of edited documentary footage and the obvious levels of mediation constantly threaten to disrupt his tidy argument, making this film difficult to classify in terms of either genre or ideology. March of the Penguins documents the annual journey of emperor penguins from the ocean to their breeding grounds: a long march of over seventy miles, in the face of dangerous weather, shifting terrain, and ever-darkening days. Despite its sometimes turbulent environ- ment, the film is visually soothing and comfortable to watch. A stun- ningly beautiful Antarctic landscape provides the backdrop for the film's anthropomorphic tale of tradition, stability, and continuity. Morgan Freeman narrates the penguins' journey in terms that are alternately serious and humorous, but always pacifying and grand- fatherly. Oriented toward family audiences, even young children are entertained watching the penguins behave in ways that are, in turn, playful, earnest, funny, and endearing. Symphonic music occasion- ally turns dark during the film's rare suggestions of crisis or threat. On the few occasions when a predator-prey conflict comes to the fore, Jacquet's penguins are docile, vulnerable prey. But even these invasive moments are neatly wrapped up in a happy ending that</page><page sequence="3">Love of Nature 55 presents itself as "especially nonideological" in its naturalness (Chris xviii). Unlike Grizzly Man , where the levels of mediation are quite notice- able, Penguins presents us with a purportedly objective view of the animals, creating a sense of immediacy that fosters resolution rather than dissonance. Other than Freeman's role as narrator, the human presence in the film is concealed, as the camera seems to present viewers with unmediated images of nature. Cynthia Chris identifies such backgrounding as a central feature of a particular film genre that is useful for classifying, to varying degrees, both Grizzly Man and Penguins : the wildlife film.2 In her recent book Watching Wildlife , Chris explains that in classic wildlife films "the strategy of minimiz- ing human presence [ . . . ] seems to invite viewers to forget that their view of nature is mediated, even as the very act of nature spectator- ship underscores its distance and unfamiliarity" (71). While her point about mediation is arguably more true of Penguins than it is of Herzog's film, both directors share similar investments in creating narratives about nature that are simultaneously about human culture. Because of their tendency to transpose the human onto the natural, wildlife films are "prism[s] through which we can examine invest- ments in dominant ideologies of humanity and animality, nature and culture, sex and race" (xiv). In the specific ways that they draw lessons about humanity from nonhuman animals, Grizzly Man and Penguins point to contemporary trends in wildlife filmmaking. Tracing the evolution of the wildlife film over the twentieth century, Chris marks a shift from films that emphasize the (often racially inflected) difference between humans and animals, and treat animals as "replenishable natural resources," to films that emphasize the sameness between humans and animals, and treat animals as "allegories of proper parenting" (207, ix). Like Herzog's grizzlies and Jacquet's penguins, today's filmic animals are often viewed through what Chris calls a "zoomorphic framework, in which knowledge about animals is used to explain the human" (x). Chris also draws broader conclusions about the genre's ideological tendencies, arguing that [b]y masking its political stakes, by diluting its environ- mentalist messages, the wildlife genre provides an illu- sory picture of a pleasurably ordered, harmonious, resilient natural world; that is, the comforting image of an eternal, "natural," depoliticized and heterotopically whole world. Such an image offers respite from real- world fears and hostilities. Another satisfying aspect of</page><page sequence="4">56 ISLE the genre derives from its knowledge-gathering, distinction-bestowing function: viewers can imagine themselves being educated while they are being enter- tained. (202) While I am not interested in measuring these two films by the (always shifting) conventions of a particular genre, even one as fasci- nating as the wildlife film, a nod to this genre helps initiate a dynamic engagement with these films in which their apparent narra- tive and thematic binaries collapse. Most significantly, an environ- ment that is "inimical to human beings" and a remote, deified landscape enable both films to send "a multitude of messages [ . . . ] that seem as true and incontrovertible as the mountains and plains" (Tompkins 71).3 This conception of nature as transcendent, "resili- ent," and "eternal," but fundamentally inhospitable to humans, enables Grizzly Man and Penguins to seamlessly graft human narra- tives onto animals, rendering penguins frontiersmen and identifying grizzlies with untamed (and untamable) wilderness. I suggest that what bridges these two films in the most significant way is not their shared generic conventions or even their shared defi- nition of nature, but another fraught human narrative: a strong undercurrent of love, which seeps into these cinematic landscapes. To cite a popular feature film that aired the same year, Brokeback Mountain , these films indicate that "love is a force of nature."4 My essay starts with the premise that Grizzly Man and Penguins each rep- resent an approach to the natural world that is deeply infused with human ideals of love. In what follows, I consider the issue of bring- ing love to nature- and imagining nature loving us in return- as a platform for reading these films' complicated narratives. Of course, claiming that these films traffic in love raises questions. Exactly what kind of love is at stake in these films? How does this love reflect human ideals about nature and culture? How is love among nonhuman animals imagined and represented? Does love function divisively, to further separate humans from nonhuman nature, or is love figured as a means of bridging the human- animal divide? With this last concern in mind, the issue of whether love becomes yet another kind of mastery over animals, an emotional- political way to distinguish "them" from "us"- much like language has traditionally been- is central to my analysis. Specifically, I argue that even as Penguins tells an ideologically fraught love story by recuperating its sense of frontier remoteness within the familiar social category of heteronormative love, it also represents the penguins as themselves capable of love- a capability that blurs the human-</page><page sequence="5">Love of Nature 57 animal binary and encourages spectator empathy. Grizzly Man , in spite of Herzog's tendency to reify nature's otherness and equate grizzlies with wilderness, imagines possibilities for a trans-species love characterized by respectful relations between autonomous animal species, including Homo sapiens. Several more broadly ecocritical questions guide my inquiry. First, what conceptions of "nature" do these films reify, and how are animals equated with, or differentiated from, "nature" itself? Second, what might we learn about the narrative and ideological phenom- enon of anthropomorphism by examining its influence in these docu- mentaries? And finally, what are the potential consequences of these films' representations of nature- for humans, for animals, and for environmentalism? My concerns in this essay have to do with both human culture and nonhuman nature, which I define in broad terms as both a material reality- that which exists autonomously from human control- and a social construction, produced by humans within specific contexts for particular purposes. I align my use of nature with what Kate Soper has called a "realist" position (Soper 31). That is, I assume that discursive, socially constructed "nature" and material, or "first," Nature are deeply interrelated in complex ways. Nature is also a broad category- one that is "flexible enough to hold, at times, working animals, companion animals, and Homo sapiens as well as wild animals" (Chris xx). Grizzly Man and Penguins are useful films for fine-tuning this "flexible" definition of nature while theorizing how nonhuman animals are represented on camera. Beyond concerns about genre classification, these films call attention to other issues, including documentary form, the camera's presence in wildlife films, and the combining of human narrative with animal behavior in ways that sometimes cause us to forget, but sometimes remember , that our "view of nature is mediated." In order to investigate these issues, I theorize a particular kind of cinematic apparatus that is useful in examining filmic representations of nonhuman animals. I develop this concept of the "speciesist camera" in the next section. While I will address Chris's concerns regarding the ideological tendencies of wildlife films, I also want to take seriously the possi- bility that these films might help formulate an environmental ethic that does not simply reproduce anthropomorphic narratives, or reify nature's resilience, or require heteronormative relationships, or map our political debates onto nature. I contend that these films demand a renewed consideration of "the animal" as the site at which humans' love for nature, anxieties about nature, and contradictory perceptions of what nature means are played out.5 Of course, it is crucial not to</page><page sequence="6">58 ISLE reduce animals to only such a site. By stripping away some of the human-centered narratives, we might leave room for animals them- selves to emerge, and we might discover a sense of respect for the wonder, beauty, and, ultimately, the independent worth of nonhu- man animals. It is my hope that being more attentive to nonhuman animals will help us to articulate new kinds of socially just environ- mental practices as we enter into an era where conceiving of a human - nature - or a human-animal- binary is increasingly imposs- ible. Perhaps unexpectedly, looking for love in these remote places enables such articulations. The Speciesist Camera: The Making of Anthropomorphic Documentaries Cary Wolfe's recent work in the fast-growing field of animal studies reminds us that, in order to avoid an anthropocentric world- view, we must "understand in what specific sense we share a world with nonhuman animals" (Wolfe 41). Donna Haraway and others have raised similar concerns and expressed the need to think in terms of collective world-building and cocreating reality with animals, who are themselves active agents in the long history of human- animal relationships. At the core of these arguments is the ethical imperative to subvert the hierarchical relations whereby linguistic humans necessarily dominate purportedly prelinguistic animals. Haraway is especially adept at addressing the question of who "speaks for" animals in her essay "Otherwordly Conversations; Terran Topics; Local Terms." Her thoughts on this issue are worth quoting at length: The last thing they "need" is human subject status, in whatever cultural-historical form. That is the problem with much animal rights discourse. The best animals could get out of that approach is the "right" to be per- manently represented, as lesser humans, in human dis- course, such as the law- animals would get the right to be permanently "orientalized." As Marx put it in another context and for other beings, "They cannot rep- resent themselves; they must be represented." Lots of well-intentioned but finally imperialist ecological dis- course takes that shape. [ . . . ] Facing the harvest of Darwinism, we do not need an endless discourse on who speaks for animals, or for nature in general. We have had enough of the language games of fatherhood. We need other terms of conversation with animals, a</page><page sequence="7">Love of Nature 59 much less respectable undertaking. The point is not new representations, but new practices , other forms of life rejoining humans and nonhumans. (141) In watching Grizzly Man and Penguins , one is tempted to conclude that the "language games of fatherhood" communicate an "imperial- ist ecological discourse." However, in the particular and often peculiar language games of cinema, this discourse becomes more complicated and, potentially, more productive of fruitful conversa- tions of the sort Haraway and others are calling for. While viewers understand, however dimly, that cinematic crea- tures correspond to real animals whose habitats are affected by human actions, representing animals as filmic subjects means that they become in some sense "our own technological creations"- tech- nologically recreated animal cyborgs rather than "real" animals (Heise 77). With this in mind, the question of how the camera depicts animals within their cinematic habitats becomes very significant. I find Laura Mulvey's seminal film theory on the gendered camera to be useful in conceptualizing this representation. In "Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema," Mulvey argues that "beyond highlighting a woman's to-be-looked-at-ness, cinema builds the way she is to be looked at into the spectacle itself" (843). More specifically, the "gaze" produced by the camera is gendered male and heterosexual, and is designed to dominate a film's female bodies; this domination, Mulvey contends, naturalizes perverse visual pleasures like voyeur- ism and sadism. In recent years, Mulvey's formula has been compli- cated productively, as the diverse experiences of viewers, the physicality of the spectator experience, and theories of phenomenol- ogy and cinema have emerged to round out the field of cinema studies. Film scholars no longer presuppose a spectator with a "motionless, bodiless, vacant gaze," nor do they take for granted the totalizing vision of a "masculine-bourgeois-white-Eurocentric classi- cal gaze" that is identical with the cinematic apparatus (Williams 2-3).6 While no longer an "orthodoxy" of film studies, Mulvey's basic model continues to serve as a platform for preliminary readings of some films (Williams 3). To a degree, her work offers insight into both Grizzly Man and Penguins. These documentaries often reveal a male gaze and position nature- or animality, which often stands in metonymically for all of nature- as the "feminine" object to be looked at. However, Penguins contains a version of the "sadistic- voyeuristic male gaze" that is complicated by the narration of Morgan Freeman, whose race prevents him from fitting neatly into</page><page sequence="8">60 ISLE the "masculine-bourgeois-white-Eurocentric" paradigm.7 Grizzly Man's gendered gaze is even more multilayered. Seen through Herzog's eyes, Treadwell is in some ways the classic American explorer, a Rooseveltian figure venturing into nature to bolster his masculine identity. Yet his affective relationships with animals and his often intimately confessional sentimentality complicate any easy assignment of gender attributes. We might claim that Treadwell's own footage tends to gender the animals he films in both masculine and feminine terms: the bears, especially when fighting or exhibiting aggression, are often masculinized, while Treadwell's furry fox friends are portrayed as coy and feminine.8 These observations are fascinating in their own right, but they are only a preliminary step toward interrogating the human- animal bin- aries at work in these films. The question remains: how are the animals represented, not in terms of gender, but in terms of species? If, as Derek Bousé suggests, "animals are subtly humanized by the very forms of wildlife films," then we need to pay attention to such formal mechanisms (130). With Mulvey's framework in mind, I propose a model for theorizing animals as the "to-be-looked-at" objects of the camera's gaze. In this theoretical model, the camera is not necessarily gendered male, but it is almost always "species-ed": human. That is, the camera privileges an anthropocentric, often androcentric, way of seeing whereby nonhuman animals are depicted as humans see and understand them and often, perhaps more proble- matically, simply as humans. Thus, the marching penguins look remarkably like struggling pioneers, the copulating penguins could be a human couple navigating through its first sexual encounter, and the grizzlies frolic and fight like a couple of young children on a play- ground. Inverting the visual relationship created by National Geographies "Crittercam" - in which a strap-on camera enables us to see the world through the animals' eyes- the speciesist camera sees animals through the world's eyes. However, this "worlding" of the animals is often obscured by a sense of cinematographic reality and directness combined with a belief in a purportedly truthful, eternal nonhuman nature. The problems with this kind of camera are significant to those concerned with animal agency. Too frequently, a speciesist cinematic perspective reduces animal behavior to a caricature of human beha- vior, providing erroneous information about how real animals live in the world. Even worse, these representations tend to elide genuine political concerns about ecosystems and their nonhuman animal resi- dents. Often, there is a causal relationship between the former and the latter; that is, entertaining images of animals-as-humans enable</page><page sequence="9">Love oř Nature 61 and even encourage such sociopolitical elisions. In Penguins , as I will show, the speciesist camera generally works to obscure the realities of global warming that are altering the habitat of the film's nonhuman stars. However, in addition to these problematic consequences, specie- sist representations of nonhuman animals also contain the potential to foster empathy between human spectators and their cyborg animal others. By breaking down the human-animal binary, these films remind us of our own animality while humanizing other animal species. This breakdown, I argue, encourages affective connections between spectators and their cinematic counterparts. In particular, witnessing other animals participating in the supposedly human emotional domain of love, as in Penguins , or witnessing a human's sincere attempt to approach nature with love, as in Grizzly Man , invites spectators to imagine species categories as fluid and overlap- ping. Looking carefully at how these films bring love to nature, I con- sider love as a broader emotional-political category than desire, and as an affect that is defined by respect and ethics, rather than confined to fraught kinship relations between human beings.9 Lest I sound overly optimistic about love's ability to conquer all spectators and solve social ills, let me hasten to add that a viewer's affective response to filmic animals is not guaranteed, and even when present, is always ambivalent. I would contend, following Judith Mayne and others, that the reactions of spectators are often mixed, and never easy to categorize. There is a troubling tendency, especially in cultural studies work, to "categorize texts and readings/responses as either conservative or radical, as celebratory of the dominant order or critical of it"; this is a tendency I hope to avoid (Mayne 172). Still, I wonder whether filmmakers who draw attention to their own cine- matic techniques- and I would place Herzog in this category- have a better chance of challenging spectators to be reflective about what the film's gaze privileges, elides, or naturalizes. My reading of Grizzly Man will underscore the potentially productive ambiguity generated through its speciesist camera, its layered nature narratives, its col- laged film footage, and the conception of inter-species love Treadwell offers. I would like to posit that the wildlife documentary is particularly conducive to thinking through cinematic ambiguities, in spite of- or rather, because of- its generic convention of representational accu- racy. Human representations of nonhuman nature are always edited, revised, and re-presented in and through a particular medium. The insidious nature of anthropomorphism is that, in the process of this editing, we often forget that these are human stories- products of our</page><page sequence="10">62 ISLE own active imaginations, our own rhetorical and cultural biases, and our own desire to formulate ethical rules of conduct for humans that are somehow legitimized by being "natural." Yet, documentary anthropomorphism has the potential to reveal rather than cover up the fact that these are really our stories, and that these cinemato- graphic "natures" betray ideals of culture. While Mulvey's contention that the "conscious aim" of narrative film is to "eliminate intrusive camera presence and prevent a distancing awareness in the audience" might hold true for that genre, documentary film often showcases and exploits camera presence as part of its appeal (843). With one eye on animality and the other eye on love, I turn now to the films for a closer look at their speciesist cameras, their anthropomorphic narra- tive and cinematic features, and their potential to trouble the human-nature and human-animal binaries in productive ways. "A Story about Love": The Ideology of. Nature in the Antarctic Wilderness March of the Penguins wowed audiences with its dramatic beauty, lighthearted humor, and spectacular footage of Antarctic scenery. A "bona-fide hit," the film "earned $70 million domestically within three months of its U.S. release to become the all-time, second-highest grossing documentary" (Chris 205). True to its genre's conventional claim to educate while entertaining, Penguins combines information on penguin breeding rituals with remarkably beautiful images: sleek penguins nuzzle one another with exquisitely curved necks; the tips of icebergs etch a rugged skyline as they jut from strikingly blue water; and brilliant sunsets color vast skies with deep red and orange streaks. These dramatic shots, coupled with Morgan Freeman's com- forting narration, create an overall effect that might be described as a "combination of nature porn and bedtime story" (Gertz). Although there are no humans depicted in the film until the credits roll, the extremity of the Antarctic environment pushes the question of human presence to the foreground in a certain way; audi- ences tend to wonder: how in the world did they film that?1 Just as the humans holding the camera are implicitly present, the specter of human ideology haunts the film: the story is framed by familiar nature narratives as well as a spectacular landscape. To an American audience, heavily influenced by a Turneresque notion of national identity, early scenes are likely to recall visions of pioneer ancestors, covered wagons, and westward migration: trudging over seemingly endless ice and snow, the penguins resemble nothing so much as a line of slightly hunched human beings walking slowly, heads bowed</page><page sequence="11">Love of Nature 63 against the elements. Frequent long shots exaggerate this effect and reinforce the anthropomorphizing of these animals. Weary travelers, struggling to survive in extreme environmental conditions, the marching penguins are akin to Westward-bound pioneer settlers in their heartiness and fortitude; even while weather (and as we will see, predators) pose threats, the pioneers continue, undeterred. They are, in Freeman's words, "stalwart souls," who "refused to leave" their home when Antarctica's ancient tropical climate took a turn for the colder. Drawing on a longstanding tradition of frontier nostalgia in American culture, the voiceover encourages viewers to see them- selves in the penguins, to admire their fortitude, and to share in their longing to return home. Apparently hard-wired to make the trek to their original breeding grounds year after year, the determined pen- guins journey to, and ultimately arrive at, "the place where each and every one of them was born." Through this touching tale of home- coming, this film assures us that the penguins are loyal, dependable, and family centered. The penguins' survival in an exceptionally harsh environment demonstrates the triumph of civilization over nature and allows well-known human narratives to be inscribed on this remote landscape. Throughout the film, external nature sets the stage for the film's naturalization of family bonding. Nature, defined as the environment the penguins inhabit, is represented as an active character in the film through language and footage that lend it a sense of agency. For instance, penguin fathers are faced with the "mother of all blizzards," "the wind's rage," and a state of perpetual darkness that persists through much of their long winter. Winter itself is ascribed intention- ally in statements like "[t]he brutal winter [ . . . ] will do everything in its power to destroy" the egg. In case the footage leaves any doubt, Freeman assures us that this is "one of the most violent and deadly winters on earth." When light begins to show on the skyline once again, the penguins are credited with achieving the first step toward "victory over winter." At the same time, the film reifies an internal "nature" as well as an external one, a division that resonates with the familiar literary and cultural discourse of American naturalism's "Man against Nature" thematic, as well as with the wildlife film genre. By collap- sing internal and external nature at times, yet reinforcing their dis- tinction at other times, the film manages to present the penguins' behavior as quintessentially "natural," in the sense of being preor- dained, biologically predetermined, and instinctive, even while upholding "nature" as a daunting foe. Overcoming Nature's obstacles</page><page sequence="12">64 ISLE serves to solidify the penguins' collective identity. This is the ideology of nature at work: as Neil Smith explains, "[t]he hostility of external nature justifie[s] its domination and the spiritual morality of universal nature provide[s] a model for social behavior" (Smith 15). External nature is a hostile force that requires taming. Universal nature, under- stood paradoxically as both internal and external, works to legitimate those cultural behaviors that seem natural. When anthropomorphism and the genre of documentary film are thrown into the mix, the ideology of nature becomes more complex. Since the animals are being represented, oftentimes, as humans- due to the speciesist camera's gaze- and since the animals themselves are distanced from the harsher elements of external nature, the act of watching the animals behave works to distance human viewers even further from a natural world that is already too frequently perceived as "other" to human culture. If nature is not even hospitable to its animal residents, then humans are one more step removed from being "at home" in nature. At the same time, by separating the animals from their habitat and subjecting them to the ideology of nature, the animals are more readily humanized. Since the animals serve as the site at which universal nature makes its intentions known, human audiences are still able to draw moral lessons from them. Because the camera makes it difficult not to see ourselves in/as the animals, anthropomorphic identification becomes the "natural" response. One effect this has on the animals, then, is the erasure of their species identity. Freeman's opening voice-over offers clear instructions for under- standing these ideologies and conceiving of the relationship between nature and culture. First, he emphasizes the remoteness of the film's nature: "There are few places as hard to get to in this world, but there are even fewer places that are as hard to live." Of course, just as this environment is "hard to get to" from the point of view of visiting humans, it is also "hard to live [in]" from a human perspective, not necessarily from that of the penguins, who have evolved to live there. Such statements reaffirm the anthropomorphic narrative of frontier triumph previously described and serve to conflate human and penguin cultures. After aligning viewers with the penguins in this way, the voiceover tells us in no uncertain terms what kind of story will be told. Specifically, the film is more than just "a tale of life over death." Indeed, "most of all, [it] is a story about love." These declara- tions reinforce the fact that this is a story about humans told through the penguins- a family melodrama that pits love, loyalty, and perse- verance against the demands of a harsh climate. As Freeman affirms, love emerges victorious.</page><page sequence="13">Love of Nature 65 The film adopts cultural discourses about love to give it a humor- ous, light tone- a tone which, I suggest, threatens to foreclose critical engagement with the social and environmental politics of the film. When Freeman announces that "like most love stories, it begins with an act of utter foolishness," most audiences are likely to smile and nod knowingly. Its depictions of penguin relationships are frequently paral- leled to human flirtations. For instance, the penguins engage in awkward-looking, performative rituals, just like "us": "They're not that different from us, really. They pout, they bellow, they strut, and occasionally, they will engage in some contact sports." Even its conces- sion that penguins are only "sort of" monogamous- "they mate with only one new partner per year, which means that every new season, all bets are off" -is communicated as if with a sly wink and a nudge.12 In this film, the language used to describe the penguins' "love" clearly resonates with human relationships, but there is only one kind of love portrayed here: heteronormative love. The film's primary message is that a family is constituted by strong male and female parents who are committed and loyal to one another- at least until the offspring are able to live independently. Breeding is apparently a couple's only goal; it is what makes a relationship "successful." In the film's words, penguin mating rituals constitute "an ancient and com- plicated affair. There will be tenderness; there will be separation; there will be reunion; and if their partnership is successful, there will be new life." Once the egg is hatched, "the couple has but a single goal: keeping their egg alive." On the other hand, failure is a distinct possibility. In one unfortunate couple's case, when "the ice claims their egg, and the life within it," their "partnership" dissolves, "the long march in vain." Once death occurs, the couple has "no reason to stay" and returns, defeated, to the sea. Given this rhetoric, it is no surprise that pro-life groups have seized on the film as a sure sign that nature sanctions their political agenda. This film's success in the United States is partly a product of the country's contemporary sociopolitical climate, which might be described as "a particularly American discursive environment, defined by historically situated cultural and political discord, in which evangelical Christianity is staging an escalating attack on established science" (Chris 207). Chris points out that the rhetoric of creationism trumps any mention of evolution; for instance, the pen- guins' behavior is said to have been "designed" rather than to have evolved. Residents of a godlike environment, the animals themselves become "not only a signpost for the 'natural,' but a sign of the holy"- with the religious overtones that a deified natural world carries (Chris 206).13</page><page sequence="14">66 ISLE The film's narrative consistently promotes a "culture of life" in keeping with heteronormative, pro-life politics. The representation of procreation as a natural urge is overwhelming; it comes second only to eating and basic survival, and even those are presented as necess- ary mainly to sustain offspring. The film tells us, in unambiguous terms, that the purpose of this journey is "finding a mate." After walking to a breeding ground that is seventy miles from their home in the sea- a "seemingly impossible journey"- the penguins eat first, immediately after which "it is time to find a mate." Like the journey itself, the penguins' desire to successfully breed a chick seems to be "guided by some invisible compass within them." It is not hard to read this journey as a metaphor for life more generally- or, for some, "an allegory for the Christian spiritual journey" (Walker 17). Culture-of-life rhetoric resonates with specific lines of narration in the film. For instance, we are told that "the tiny beating heart within the shell cannot survive more than a moment's exposure to the freezing air." Late in the film, when a leopard seal kills a female penguin who has returned to the sea to feed, Freeman tells us that this predatory act "actually takes two lives: that of the mother, and that of her unborn chick, who will never be fed." Politically aware American viewers are likely reminded of the Laci Peterson case and the subsequent Unborn Victims of Violence Act of 2004, which defines violence against a pregnant woman as two separate crimes. The "unborn chick" is distinguished from "unborn child" by a mere two letters; one almost expects to hear Freeman say "child," given how closely the language here echoes contem- porary discourse. Returning to Haraway's discussion of the ques- tion "who speaks for the animal?" we must acknowledge that, here, it is Morgan Freeman (or rather, the script), whose paternal voice articulates the "language games of fatherhood" by which pro-life rhetoric perpetuates itself. Indeed, fatherhood is central to this film. The father's contribution to the successful birth of a penguin is upheld as "Nature's most endearing role reversal; it is the father who [ . . . ] will make a nest for the egg [ . . . ] keeping it safe and warm." Despite the implications of this paean to devoted fathers, the penguin parents actually share the childrearing. Between the mother and the father penguins making long treks to the water for food, quality family time is rare. The film's remark that "occasionally, the new family can actually spend some time together" seems intended to empathize with the struggles of contemporary two-income families by celebrating the rare occasion when neither parent is working. Although these comments are likely meant to be sensitive to today's shifting categories of motherhood</page><page sequence="15">Love of Nature 67 and fatherhood, the amazement with which the father's role is com- municated-and the fact that his assistance constitutes an "endearing role reversal"- reifies traditional gender roles as normative. The film's final words take us full circle, as the now fully grown penguin offspring return to the sea to begin preparing for the time when they, too, will take part in the breeding ritual. Freeman says, in closing: "And they will march, just as they have done for centuries, ever since the emperor penguin decided to stay- to live, and to love, in the harshest place on earth." Audiences are left with a strong sense that life is not only natural, but a miracle. We need only look at the animal world- the ancestral march, the way the reunited mates find each other by sound, the fact that they locate the same mating ground year after year, the little milky substance the father regurgi- tates for its hungry newborn chick- to remind us how miraculous life is. These processes are indeed wondrous, in large part for all that humans do not know about how they work. In that sense, the film humbles viewers. Still, even with so many unanswered questions, we often succumb to the urge to wrap up these miracles in tidy narra- tives that explain nature in our own terms- religious or otherwise. Instead of preserving what Lyotard calls "the unharmonizable" element of existence, humans tend to want to capture, contain, and make ourselves comfortable with this threat of the animal other's "reticence" (4). Sometimes, though, the speciesist camera generates an awareness of animal subjectivity through a particular form of spectator identifi- cation that transgresses the "frontier" of subjectivity that often separ- ates animals from humans. As Jacques Derrida reminds us, there is a range of ways by which we try to distinguish animals from "us" and effectively "refuse the animal such and such a power" (137). These abundant means of differentiation (and ultimately, subversion) include "speech, reason, experience of death, mourning, culture, insti- tution, technics, clothing, lie, pretense of pretense, covering of tracks, gift, laughter, tears, respect, and so on" (137). In Penguins , several of these grounds of differentiation are called into question when a mother penguin is apparently able to mourn the death of her young.14 Despite Richard Schickel's assertion that Jacquet "refusfes] to impose human emotions on his subjects," I find it difficult not to see the film's penguins as capable of experiencing affect, especially this particular mother (Schickel 68). After her chick fails to survive the winter's final storm, "the loss," Freeman tells us, "is unbearable." To illustrate this point, the camera records her making a moaning noise that sounds eerily human and unmistakably mournful. Revealing the extent of her grief, the film</page><page sequence="16">68 ISLE explains that "[e]very year, some bereft mother will respond to her agony in an unbearable way. Having lost her own chick, she will attempt to steal another's." The group will not allow this to happen, and we watch as the other mothers successfully fend off the bereaved. Although the language used to describe the mother's mourning is melodramatic, and although it could be argued that it serves simply to reinforce the film's pro-life sensibilities, I contend that the scene as a whole opens up unexpected lines of empathy between viewers and this animal. If the ability to mourn is an indicator of subjectivity that humans find compelling, then this scene grants the penguins subjec- tivity on these grounds. In a similar death scene, penguin behavior again pulls at specta- tors' heartstrings as a community of penguin parents tries to protect its young when a bird of prey attacks a group of young chicks. A hovering, circling camera conspires to make the chicks appear fearful: hiding underneath their mothers' skirts, huddling together, waddling away from the predator at a frustratingly slow pace. The predator seems to willfully select one of the frightened chicks before killing it. Here, again, the speciesist camera's depiction of the pen- guins as humans works to facilitate empathy. Coupled with the mourning scene discussed above, these scenes illustrate that penguins do go through the "experience of death" that supposedly separates them from humans. It is worth mentioning that during these attacks it is the community, rather than particular family units, that responds to the tragedy. To a degree, then, traditional kinship categories dis- solve, allowing some respite from the overbearing metanarrative of heteronormativity that usually dominates. These scenes suggest that the very mechanism- namely, the spe- ciesist camera- by which the penguins stand in for humanity and are thus denied subjectivity as animals also contains the possibility for highlighting species autonomy by permitting nonhuman animals to participate in "our" affective domain. As the human-animal distinc- tion loosens, we might begin to see the penguins as "not that differ- ent from us" in new kinds of ways. For instance, if we can see ourselves in the penguin adults, who are protecting future penguin generations from demise, then perhaps we can also see ourselves in the predators, the threat to the film's much heralded "new life." This predator identification opens up the possibility of a more honest self- reflection, in which we come to terms with our frequent role as the perpetrators of the environmental destruction and social injustices associated with, in this case, global warming. Admittedly, the likeli- hood of such self-reflection may be slim, especially since the film's love is so often negotiated through heteronormative kinship relations.</page><page sequence="17">Love of Nature 69 Still, in these occasional moments of crisis and species-blurring, I suggest that an alternate response, in which emperor penguins are seen as an independently valuable species, is possible. As the final credits roll, the human element of this wildlife documentary is shown for the first time, in the form of the film's footage being made. The filmmakers carrying their gear to the scene mirrors the penguins' long march. Skiers fall as they struggle with heavy camera equipment, recalling the penguins' slippery trajectories in earlier scenes, and penguins circle around a photographer (who looks remarkably out of place in a bright red snowsuit), appearing to investigate this visitor and his or her equipment. In the end, as a smiling photographer gives the thumbs up sign, it feels as though the film is finally admitting to an anthropocentric bias: this documentary, the thumbs up seems to say, is mostly about human beings and our remarkable ability to persevere in the face of nature's obstacles. Those who encounter the penguins via DVD are privy to two special features- each of which foregrounds the human elements in the making of this film. The first, "Of Penguins and Men," rep- resents the filmmakers as stalwart pioneers who, with "solitude, cold, and the wide open spaces as [their] only companions," brave the elements and experience extreme isolation for the sake of their artistic project. There is an experience "located outside of time, beyond words," the voice-over tells us. Becoming more solipsistic, the voice wonders: "How can I darken the purity of the dark continent with words?" Indeed, he asserts, "[w]e are now alone, face to face with ourselves." The second special feature is National Geographies "Crittercam." Described as a "high-tech video tool worn by species on the edge," this camera is physically attached to animals, affording scientists and spectators an intimate look at an animal's behavior. This feature's narrator wonders whether the penguins "stand a chance" in the face of "a world threatened by climate change." Even as it suggests scientists have been "galvanized by the threat of climate change" to count the population, the narration perpetuates a sense of Antarctica's remoteness from everyday life. It is a "land lost to eternal ice" that seems like "the last place on earth." Such language makes it difficult to connect with this "frozen desert," and so, difficult to feel responsible for it. Yet, in a dramatic rhetorical reversal, the feature ends by replacing its prior use of the benign phrase "climate change" with the more worrisome and politically charged "global warming." It also warns that the "balanced" environ- ment of ice that is the penguins' "foundation of life" is potentially being disrupted. Despite its insistence that "[i]t will take a long-term investigation to find definite answers" to whether global warming is</page><page sequence="18">70 ISLE actually happening, this feature does remind us that "the future of the world's emperor penguins, and our own" go hand in hand. These special features generally align themselves with the docu- mentary itself, which does little to indicate global warming as a threat of any kind. Even when the film's narration might be directly referencing global warming- such as when we are told that "[t]he ice continues to melt, returning the borrowed water to the sea"- there is no suggestion that this melting is at all uncommon. Like the pen- guins' mating ritual, this ice has been melting, seasonally, for thou- sands of years. The social normativity the film advocates, and the illusion of Antarctica as pristine wilderness, unaffected by human behavior, foreclose the effects of global warming. Through its narra- tive and aesthetic choices, Penguins presents a Disneyfied version of nature in which the Antarctic environment- like the penguins them- selves-seems to be hard- wired to persevere. Still, especially when capped off with the features, the film leaves spectators in an ambivalent place; we see ourselves in the penguins and in the filmmakers, in front of the camera as well as behind it. The Antarctic frontier, this "land lost to eternal ice," seems at once foreign and familiar, fearsome and comfortable, far away and so close. In the darkened theater or on the living room couch, we are left "alone, face to face with ourselves," and we are not sure what the appropriate take-home message is. In this uncertainty, I locate the potential for productive engagement, as the viewer determines what direction her newfound knowledge (however preliminary and incomplete) of the emperor penguins will take. One direction spectators are taking their knowledge is south: Antarctic tourism is on the rise. In her article "A Great March to See the Penguins," Jennifer Conlin warns potential ecotourists to plan ahead, because "Emperor Penguin Safaris," led by Quark Expeditions, is selling out a year in advance. The company's market- ing manager claims that "[e]veryone wants to see the penguins because of the movie" (Conlin 5.2). In this trend, the multiple real- world repercussions of a wildlife documentary come to the fore. Ecotourism is a fraught activity, encouraging love and appreciation for a resource even as it attracts more tourists and ultimately risks damaging that very resource. Implying a need to visit a site before it's too late, tourism also risks reinforcing a perception of nature as inevitably "disappearing." Film spectatorship, a form of visual tourism, contains a similar set of paradoxes. Even when it inadver- tently highlights these paradoxes, March of the Penguins presents us with conflicted choices for getting to know the emperor penguins and their Antarctic home.15</page><page sequence="19">Love of Nature 71 Interpreting the Grizzly Gaze: Crossing a Line with "Mr. Rogers-of-the-wild" Grizzly Man is frequently interpreted as a cautionary tale about an idealistic- some would say deluded- environmental crusader who "crosses a line" in his approach to nature. Whether one thinks Timothy Treadwell was a benevolent hero or a self-destructive hermit, it is difficult not to have a strong opinion about a man who spent thirteen summers living with Alaskan grizzly bears, only to be killed and eaten by one of them. The fact that his girlfriend, Amie Huguenard, died with him complicates the issue even more. She is seen by some as an unfortunate victim of Treadwell's madness, and by others as a willing participant with an equally sophisticated environmental conscience. Because of Treadwell's apparent fearlessness (or recklessness, as many argue) and the location of his adventures in Alaska, compari- sons to Into the Wild's Chris McCandless are tempting.16 Both men wanted to escape from "the conditions of life in modern industrial society: from a mechanized existence, economic dead ends, social entanglements, unhappy personal relations, political injustice"- in short, the general sense of dissatisfaction they found in more civilized environs (Tompkins 4). Both men warrant comparisons to the classic American cowboy: the lone, contemplative male in the wilderness whose "desperate earnestness" is palpable (Tompkins 11). Herzog- who clearly wants to tell a story about Treadwell's "search for himself"- combines his serious, even dour, thickly German-accented voice-over narration with twangy, soulful, original guitar music by Richard Thompson to lend a masculine moodiness to the portrayal of Treadwell and to the film more generally. However, while McCandless may have been romantic about nature, Treadwell seems to be quite literally in love with nature- at least, if his perpetual declarations of "I love you" can be taken lit- erally. Whereas both men participate in a deeply rooted, highly mas- culinized tradition of frontier exploration in the United States. Treadwell presents us with a provocative new twist on this tradition: love. One interpretation of the film is that Treadwell's (self-declared) inability to form successful love relationships with women is part of what propels him to Alaska, where his unrequited love for the grizzly bears ultimately gets him killed. In this interpretation, love- a failed heterosexuality reinvented as a romance with nature- is destroyed by a ruthless, emotionless natural world. Among those who see the film in such terms, some of the film's reviewers mock Treadwell as a "Mr. Rogers-of-the-wild" (People Weekly 31). Others</page><page sequence="20">72 ISLE claim his shaggy blond hair, ambiguous sexuality, and California hippie persona lend him all the scientific credibility of a "gay surfer based in Malibu" (Beale 38). For Herzog, Treadwell is nothing less than "a wonderful fellow filmmaker" (Garcia 16). Herzog praises Treadwell's commitment to the well-being of the bears, as well as his talents as "a great perfor- mer" on one hand, and "a great image-seeker" on the other (Garcia 16). However, in constructing Treadwell as an embodiment of passion and cinematic artistry, Herzog mystifies the ideological and political repercussions of representing Treadwell representing the grizzlies. Instead, he describes the film as "a film of human ecstasies and darkest inner turmoil," and as such, a fundamentally human story. Even while he claims his film is about human nature, Herzog sets up an ideological debate about nonhuman nature between himself and Treadwell that hinges on love: Herzog is confident only in nature's indifference, while Treadwell romanticizes nature. Along with many of the film's reviewers, Herzog articulates this distinction, saying: "I respect the bears. I don't love them, as Timothy did" (Garcia 15). While Herzog (perhaps ironically) romanticizes Treadwell's rugged individualism and obsessive passion, the fact that Treadwell's love of nature gets him killed enables Herzog to argue that nature is insensi- tive to human emotions.17 Reviewers have reduced Treadwell's phil- osophy to a simple formula: "nature is sweet, civilization is nasty" (Geller 52). By that logic, Herzog's philosophy might be something like: "nature is nasty, and so is civilization." Yet the film exposes far more than just these simplistic viewpoints. What appears to be a binary between Herzog and Treadwell is actu- ally more of a network, or a web, of nature narratives at play. All of these narratives have deep roots in American history and culture, roots that might be less familiar to the German filmmaker, who is most invested in an early colonial understanding of wilderness as a place of fear and confusion.18 Again, reviews of the film demonstrate the proliferation of nature narratives at stake in this documentary. Some critics claim Treadwell's experience shows "the inevitability of the natural order."19 Some foreground the consequences of "fatally romanticiz[ing]" animals (People Weekly 31). Others read the film as a sympathetic tale about a free-spirited man who "died the way he wanted to," doing what he loved (Beale 39). Still others call him a big-hearted "bear whisperer," and some even credit Treadwell with being a scientific "pioneer," who was doing important work with grizzly bears.20 Whatever one thinks of Treadwell himself, it is a mistake to con- clude, as Cynthia Chris does, that his film footage "says more about</page><page sequence="21">Love of Nature 73 his desperate (and eventually fatal) alienation, his yearning to jump species, to become one with the bears, than about the bears them- selves" (Chris 205). This desire to "jump species" is an integral com- ponent of the film and does tell us a great deal about Treadwell. However, this desire, especially as filtered through Herzog's editing, says plenty about the bears themselves. Indeed, the film's productive ambiguities concerning nature and animality become most apparent in its depictions of this trans-species affect, which I am calling "love," along with Treadwell. While there is a sense in which the bears are "therapy" for Treadwell- after all, he "discovered" Alaska and its animal residents as a salve for his addictions and failures in the Lower Forty-eight- I contend that the film is just as much about the bears as it is about Treadwell's troubled psyche. I hope to show that Treadwell deserves credit for reminding viewers of animals' agency- of the definitive, autonomous subjectivity that all nonhuman animals possess- and for encouraging ethical inter-species relationships based on respectful love. Focusing on Treadwell's subjectivity, as Herzog and Chris do, is alluring. The story- within-a-story framework- in which Herzog creates a film about Treadwell, who in turn filmed the bears- makes the protagonist difficult to pinpoint. For Herzog, the bears are not really characters in his film, but rather metonyms for all of wild nature; Treadwell is his film's clear protagonist. In Treadwell's footage, the animals- the bears, mainly, but occasionally foxes and other animal "friends"- are presumably the featured actors and actresses. Complicating the issue is the fact that both filmmakers share the stage with their filmic subjects; Herzog and Treadwell are also their own films' protagonists. Herzog rightly recognizes that Treadwell has created a movie with "himself as the central character." And audiences are frequently subjected to Herzog's presence, both in the form of his arguably overbearing commentary, and in one controversial scene, where we see the back of Herzog's head as he listens to the audio of Treadwell's death while a close friend of Treadwell's, Jewel Palovak, looks on in horror. ("You must never listen to this [ . . . ] you should destroy it," he concludes, masochisti- cally. Sobbing, Jewel agrees.). Herzog credits Treadwell with producing a piece of visual art that is "way beyond a wildlife film." Indeed, Treadwell's repeated takes and "methodical" camerawork result in some shots of unexpected beauty. Herzog showcases two in particular: one in which several foxes trot through the natural "set" where Treadwell is recording some grizzly footage, and another in which Treadwell steps out of the shot, leaving only a playful breeze gently tossing trees and</page><page sequence="22">74 ISLE grasses. Some of these serendipitous visual moments, according to Herzog, possess "their own life, their own mysterious stardom." The same terms might well describe Treadwell. Herzog edits Treadwell's footage in such a way as to narrate the story he wants to tell: a story of Treadwell's own "mysterious stardom" that chronicles his "inner- most being, his demons, his exhilarations." However, at the nexus of the competing stories told by the two filmmakers lie the animals, and a closer look at them illuminates the ambiguities and complexities of the speciesist camera. In Grizzly Man , there are two kinds of animals represented, and each is por- trayed through the lens of first Treadwell, then Herzog. As I've men- tioned, Herzog appropriates Treadwell's animal footage either to aestheticize it (in support of his argument about Treadwell as film- maker), or to render it ideological (in support of his argument about nature as indifferent). While Herzog's depiction of nonhuman animals is clearly speciesist, Treadwell's footage tends not to be spe- ciesist, partly because of his genuine respect for the animals' sover- eignty, partly because he is so concerned with how he represents himself, and partly because he did not have the chance to turn his footage into a coherent film narrative. Treadwell's own footage, insofar as we can detach it from Herzog's narratives, is far more layered. The foxes are Treadwell's companion animals- essentially, his pets. Seen through Treadwell's lens, they perpetuate the comforting myth that animals are loveable and sympathetic companions- the cuddly, teddy-bear animals of car- toons, and stuffed children's toys. The foxes, for their part, appear to appreciate Treadwell's presence; much like dogs or other domestic pets, they come across as playful, even loyal to Treadwell. The bears are much more complex figures for Treadwell. The grizzlies are awe-inspiring "majestic creatures"- charismatic megafauna in all their superlative glory. While he does not suggest the bears are con- sistently friendly toward him- his footage includes irritated bears, who appear to snap at him, and they do not appreciate his attempts to pet them- Treadwell does depict the bears as companions, and they generally seem to tolerate him.21 Although they inspire his admiration, the grizzlies are not merely visual spectacles, as is the case with so many wildlife films. Rather, it is the bears' autonomous existence, their very life, that impresses Treadwell. Much of his footage depicts relatively unremarkable beha- viors like eating and sleeping. Banal events excite Treadwell as much or more than standard wildlife film fare like fighting, stalking, or mating. For example, he is awestruck over a very unspectacular sight: a female bear's fresh scat. Treadwell touches his hand to the</page><page sequence="23">Love of Nature 75 still-warm pile and expresses amazement over the fact that it "was just inside her." He tells the audience excitedly that "it's her life! It's her! [ . . . ] Everything about them is perfect." Even though it is their autonomy that amazes Treadwell, the footage also collapses the boundary between him and the bears in various ways. The fact that he frequently occupies the frame alongside the bears undermines the tendency of the wildlife film to draw a stark line between animals and humanity. Indeed, his presence in their habitat begins to seem natural to viewers. Treadwell's ability to share film space with the bears has a democratizing effect that undermines Herzog's efforts to turn them into dangerous adversaries. Cinematographically, the bears are in some ways (like Jacquet's penguins) "just like us"- a point to which I will return shortly. Sometimes, when Treadwell turns the camera's gaze on himself, it is with a more overt purpose. He speaks to us as a newscaster, inter- viewer, confessor, sportscaster, and director at various points. There are times when he clearly seems to be acting, such as when he shoots repeated takes of his verbal tirades against the National Park Service. Even so, he often relinquishes cinematic authority as well, setting the camera down to record animals going through the motions of their daily lives. Even at his most speciesist, the bears' behavior transcends his storytelling. For instance, his sportscaster-style commentating sounds absurd when applied to two enormous male bears fighting over a female. Perhaps because he is so willing to appear in his footage alongside the animals, his narrative presence does not threa- ten the integrity of the bears' identities, just as his physical presence does not threaten the animals. In effect, the filmmakers accomplish nearly the inverse of their professed cinematic intentions regarding the animals. Although Herzog claims to see only disinterested boredom in the bears and does not set out to "narrate" their lives, he ends up presenting them in distinctly fictional terms; they stand in for human narratives about nature, and thus their species identity is largely erased. While Treadwell overtly tells stories about the animals, he is actually more successful at allowing them to retain their identities- not just as a species, but even as individuals within a species. We do not know what a film made by Treadwell would have looked like, since he did not live to make this one. Grizzly Man is Herzog's version of a story he says "lay dormant" in Treadwell's footage, and so Herzog's rep- resentations of the animals, and of Treadwell, are dominant. It is diffi- cult not to be influenced by Herzog's belief that Treadwell sought "a primordial encounter," and in doing so, "crossed an invisible borderline."</page><page sequence="24">76 ISLE Herzog interviews eccentric California and Alaska residents, most of whom had known Treadwell personally, regarding the alleged crossing of this line. Opinions range from Sam Egli, a helicopter pilot who thinks Treadwell "got what he deserved," to Jewel Palovak, who describes Treadwell and Huguenard as heroic individuals who, in opting to live their lives "in wild nature," "truly died doing what they lived for." Perhaps the most interesting of these interviews is with Dr. Sven Haakanson, curator at the Kodiak Museum and an Alutiiq Indian. He explains that "the line between bear and human has apparently always been respected by the Native communities of Alaska," and that Treadwell "crossed a boundary that [these commu- nities] have lived with for 7,000 years." Dr. Haakanson contends that the "tragic" component of Treadwell's death is that "he tried to be a bear, he tried to act like a bear," and "you don't do that. You don't invade on their territory." Finally, he condemns this boundary- crossing as "the ultimate in disrespect." Speaking from the perspec- tive of "Native communities"- a perspective most American specta- tors would align (perhaps stereotypically) with proximity to nature and respect for all species as kin- Dr. Haakanson's opinion is hard to argue with. Marnie Gaede, an ecologist and friend of Treadwell's from California, describes Treadwell's behavior in similar terms, saying he "wanted to mutate into a wild animal." However, she celebrates this desire as "a religious sense [ . . . ] of connecting so deeply that you are no longer human." Bear biologist Larry Van Daele affirms that Treadwell "tended to want to become a bear." He informs us that Treadwell would "woof" at researchers in the field and sometimes imitate the behavior of a surprised bear. Van Daele interprets this as a response to the "siren call" of the "simpler world" of the bears, which, he reminds us, is always foreclosed to human residents. In an interesting variation on the boundary-blurring theme, Herzog concurs, but contends that Treadwell was able to make "a clear dis- tinction" between the human world and the bear world; he simply preferred the latter. "Wild, primordial nature was where he truly felt at home," says Herzog. Ultimately, this cacophony of voices that sing Treadwell's praise or condemn his irresponsibility does not harmonize; there is no clear melody to this documentary's discordant tune. Despite the stark line Herzog and others want to draw between "wild, primordial nature" and human civilization- a line that has been hotly contested in much recent environmental scholarship- Treadwell's footage, behavior, and narration speak louder than the film's metanarrative, urging us to consider the breakdown of these categories in new ways. Herzog's</page><page sequence="25">Love of Nature 77 professed treatment of the bears in terms of "respect," as opposed to love, is undermined by Treadwell's view, which sees these animals as distinct species, worthy of respect and love. This love is manifest in Treadwell's understanding of himself as both human and animal- an understanding that is of central concern to animal studies scholarship. In describing his "bond" with Timmy the fox as a friendship between "this very wild animal" and this "fairly wild person," Treadwell places himself along a continuum of wildness that further blurs the lines between human and nonhuman animals. Both species participate, to varying degrees, in "animality." And yet, he maintains a sense of species boundaries when recogniz- ing the bear's habitat. He is well aware that he is a visitor in the bears' home, and he is often reflective about his potential intrusive- ness. A respectful visitor, Treadwell claims to have learned "the language of the bear" before entering their habitat. "I would not go into a bear's home and kill a bear," he explains, referring to his decision not to carry a weapon in self-defense. By any biologist's account Treadwell invades their space; the standard National Park Service rule is that visitors should stay at least 100 yards away from bears and other large mammals. However disdainful Treadwell is of the Park Service, though, he does approach the animals as his equals, and with a love that certainly seems genuine on camera. When Treadwell chants, "I am in love with my animal friends," while mourning the death of a young fox, it is hard to doubt his sincerity. We might read Treadwell's love, and his behavior more generally, as an instance of what Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari call "becoming-animal"- an intriguing concept for animal studies scho- lars. For Deleuze and Guattari, this somewhat mystical process is tied to masochistic sexual behaviors in which a "body without organs" or a "plane of consistency" is achieved. Abstractly, achiev- ing a body without organs means destabilizing hierarchical cat- egories to a point where identity is fluid, where the "connection of desires, conjunction of flows, continuum of intensities" supercede the interpretation of such flows and desires (161). In more concrete terms, becoming-animal is a humbling process of "exchange and circulation"; it is "an inversion of signs" by which the human agent recognizes, however peripherally, that "what happens to a horse can also happen to me" (155). While masochistic sexual acts are one way this blurring of animal categories can take place, there are other, perhaps better, ways. Treadwell's way seems to be by approaching nature with what he calls love: a combination of respect, admiration, awe, and an intense longing to fully experience the world of another being.</page><page sequence="26">78 ISLE When he is not directly becoming-animal, Treadwell's most prevalent approach to the bears might be termed "tough love." Unlike the classic Western cowboy, Treadwell is a lover as well as a fighter. He alternates, often rather suddenly, between toughness and sentimentality. One minute he is demonstrating his aggression toward the bears by throwing fake punches and yelling at them- a technique he insists is necessary to show them he is "tough" and fearless, and can "hold [his] own" in a challenging situation. The next minute he is consoling them: "It's okay. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I'm sorry." His seemingly bipolar behavior indi- cates his belief that in order to live with these animals he must not only love them, but also make it clear, through demonstrative acts of strength, that he is not afraid of them. He calls himself a "kind warrior," explaining that "once there is weakness they will exploit it, they will decapitate [him]." Yet, paradoxically, he also must remain "gentle [ . . . ] like a flower" even as he stands "on the precipice of death." He understands his own behavior, then, as informed by the need to adapt to the bears' social environment and communicate with them on their own terms. To substantiate his actions, Treadwell inscribes dichotomous ideol- ogies onto the Alaskan landscape, which can be both a romantic pas- toral setting and a frightening, dangerous wilderness. Treadwell nominally sets up the areas he inhabits- the "grizzly sanctuary" and the "grizzly maze"- as antithetical spaces. The first is a pastoral space, in which he says he can "run so wild, so free, so like a child." The second is a dense wilderness, thick with brush that hides his tent from sight, where paranoia and fear infect his actions and his narra- tion. Here and throughout his footage, Treadwell combines the rheto- ric of the frontier and the pastoral. Sometimes he sounds like a stereotypical New Ager who naively embraces nature as a spiritual sanctuary, akin to Gaede's observations. As pilot Sam Egli puts it, Treadwell thought he and the bears "would bond as children of the universe." Herzog makes a similar point when he characterizes Treadwell's view that "everything out there was good, and the uni- verse was in harmony." But this is only part of the story. Treadwell's belief in pastoral harmony enables and informs his actions as protec- tor of wilderness, and in justifying these actions, Treadwell fashions himself as the quintessential frontiersman: he foregrounds the danger of his environment, makes himself out to be a fearless protector of the bears, and highlights his aloneness, even when Huguenard is pre- sumably with him. What results is a unique form of environmental love, underscored by frontier vigor. Since Treadwell is decidedly not out to conquer or tame this wilderness, what would historically</page><page sequence="27">Love of Nature 79 connote conquest translates into an exploratory love that crosses species boundaries. While embracing and retelling these very human narratives, Treadwell seems to alternate between being human and being animal- or rather, he acts out a human-animality that acknowledges he is always both at once. For instance, his demonstrations of domi- nance could be construed as a human privilege or as a way of com- municating between species, one animal to another. After all, grizzlies affirm their own species hierarchies through territorial and exhibitionist displays of toughness. Thus, while human love for nature often morphs into tales of nature's own emotions, perhaps Treadwell's anthropomorphism is not altogether destructive to non- human animals. On the contrary, perhaps such becoming-animal helps draw attention to the speciesism implicit in so many human interactions with animals and remind us of our own precarious animality. Herzog wants no part of nature's love. He would have his audi- ence believe that "what Treadwell saw as love emanating from the bears" is nothing more than indifferent biological urges (Beale 39). Perhaps, then, it is not bringing love to nature, but imagining that nature loves us in return, that is problematic. Herzog's at-first minimal narration increases and builds on itself throughout the film, culminating in a striking scene in which he expresses his argument in no uncertain terms. He expounds: And what haunts me, is that in all the faces of all the bears that Treadwell ever filmed, I discover no kinship, no understanding, no mercy. I see only the overwhelm- ing indifference of nature. To me, there is no such thing as a secret world of the bears. And this blank stare speaks only of a half-bored interest in food. But for Timothy Treadwell, this bear was a friend, a savior. In this powerful scene, Herzog shows some of Treadwell's most impressive footage: a nearly thirty-second-long close-up of a bear's face. During much of this time, the bear stares directly into the camera. Bousé explains that facial close-ups are often used in wildlife films "to ascribe to animals almost whatever feelings and emotions the filmmaker wishes to assign them according to the requirements of the storyline at that moment" (128). Here, Herzog's voice-over assigns the bear- and by extension, nature- a distinct lack of emotion. The proximity of the bear's face lends the shot a sense of directness and authenticity; having removed externalities and gotten as close as we can to the bear's eyes, we seem to see the bear for what</page><page sequence="28">80 ISLE it is. However, the bear's eyes confirm Bouse's point by gazing back at the camera, and holding up a mirror to our own human expectations. This shot is a striking instance of what animal studies scholars have termed "animal reticence": the disarming fact that animals do not talk back to us when we look at them. This silence- this lack of human language- is deafening, and we feel obliged to interpret their penetrating gaze. However, some say the silence is less an absence than a presence; it does not necessarily indicate a lack of communi- cation. Vicki Hearne, who is engaging Wittgenstein, explains: "The reticence of [animals] ... is not the reticence of absence, absence of consciousness, say, or knowledge, but rather of tremendous pre- sence," of "all consciousness that is beyond ours" (170). Cary Wolfe refers us to Stanley Cavell's view that the tendency to deny animals language reveals our "skeptical terror about the independent exist- ence of other minds," a terror Wolfe claims is "in a certain sense, about our failure to be god" (3). Herzog seems to take pleasure in this "skeptical terror" and in titillating his spectators with it. The infamous scene where he listens to the audio footage in front of Palovak is a case in point. More than that, Herzog replicates the all-too-common human tendency to view an animal's apparent lack of (human) language as "a lack of subjec- tivity" (3). Treadwell, on the other hand, draws our attention to the idea that there is a "tremendous presence" and a definitive subjectiv- ity in these bears. His determination to name each of them, while verging on a kind of mastery, indicates his recognition that these bears are not generic "animals," but rather individuals within a species. In this sense, Treadwell offers a compelling alternative to the speciesist camera Herzog holds, which reinforces not only the human-animal binary, but at the same time eliminates interspecies difference between nonhuman animals. Treadwell's bears are not only Ursus arctos horribilis, but also individuals within that species grouping. Deluded though he may be about his role as "protector" of these animals- after all, they inhabit federally protected land- Treadwell's long-term relationships with Mr. Chocolate, Sergeant Brown, Mickey, Saturn, and others represent a sincere attempt by a human being to live among fellow creatures while allowing nonhu- man animals to retain subjectivity. Treadwell's naming and nicknaming (Saturn, he tells us, is the "Michele Pfeiffer of bears") also makes the bears less, well, scary. Grizzlies haunt the imaginations of many tourists, and tales of grizzly attacks exaggerate how dangerous they are. Herzog plays into these fears when he wonders, late in the film, whether Treadwell has</page><page sequence="29">Love of Nature 81 captured "his murderer" on camera. There is something to be said for reducing the irrational fear of grizzlies in the hope that, as human development continues to encroach on bears' habitats, we might coexist peacefully with them.22 If Charlie Russell is right in saying Treadwell's proximity to bears works to "counter the exaggerated depictions of ferocious bears" that permeate contemporary culture, then perhaps he accomplished something useful in that regard (Russell 22). At the very least, Treadwell's actions- and Herzog's depictions of them- have opened up debates about what it means to say humans have "crossed a line" into the territory of the wild. Charlie Russell and Doug Peacock, respected students of grizzly bear behavior in their own rights, both argue that this line has been too carefully drawn, that the idea of giving animals their space has gone too far. Peacock worries that the trend to separate bears and people means that "the spectrum of backcountry adventure is trun- cated at the wild extreme" (Peacock 22). Peacock attempts to make a conservationist argument by reminding us that in our mission to "domesticate this continent, we missed a few pockets of wildness where risk still dwells . . . That anchor of wild risk keeps us tethered." He goes on to claim that the grizzly is "essential to us all, useful to distant corners of the soul," as well as a humbling force that "remind[s] us of our place in the food chain" (Peacock). Certainly Treadwell's experience hammers that last point home. But what about the first? To conceive of the grizzly's "usefulness" as first and fore- most a matter of enriching the human soul is problematic. Animals are not intrinsically valuable in this formulation. What looks like an antiimperialist argument, then, ends up sounding a lot like mastery- albeit a kinder, gentler form of it. It is resolutely humanist in its insistence that "wild risk" is the antithesis of human domesti- cation and that animals fall into the former category. Like Herzog's conflation of animals with wild nature, this utilitarian notion of wild- ness sounds speciesist. Fortunately, Treadwell's footage usually avoids speciesism. The final scene of Grizzly Man-a shot of Tread well walking slowly away from the camera along a pristine stream bed in the grizzly maze- illustrates the film's fascinating contradictions and ends on an ambivalent note. In this scene Treadwell is shadowed by two grizzly bears, who follow him closely and appear to be casual companions, strolling along the same path. A song called "Coyotes" accompanies the last shot and guides our reading of it. The singer imitates mourn- ful coyote "yips," and elegiac lyrics lament the loss of natural resources, including coyotes, the red wolf, and an old cowboy who</page><page sequence="30">82 ISLE cursed humanity during his life. Having just been told by Herzog that this film is less about "wild nature" than it is about our own "human nature" (Herzog never specifies whose human nature is at stake), "Coyotes" encourages this separation by nostalgically aligning Treadwell with the song's deceased cowboy. However, the film footage suggests yet another blurring of boundaries, a final break- down of the alleged line between humanity and wild nature. This scene parallels two earlier scenes- the opening shot, which includes spectacular Alaskan mountains in the background, grizzlies mid- range, and Treadwell in the foreground; and a shot near the end, in which Treadwell walks with his fox friends away from the camera and toward the distant mountains. Echoing these prior shots where multiple species inhabit the same cinematic environment, the closing shot disrupts any easy assignment of animal categories to the film's protagonists. Treadwell and the bears share the final stage as they meander into the sunset together. Too often, the speciesist camerawork of environmental documen- taries showcases the ability of humans to master wild nature. However, Treadwell's sensitivity to animal subjectivities trumps Herzog's attempts to reinforce the human-nature binary. Without a doubt, Treadwell not only imagined, but personally lived out "new practices , other forms of life rejoining humans and nonhumans" (Haraway 141). More than just calling for a réévaluation of the boundaries between humans and "nature," then, Treadwell's experi- ences-especially as mediated through Grizzly Man- challenge us to distinguish between different kinds of human and nonhuman animal species, as well as different kinds of nonhuman nature, in more nuanced ways. Untangling these complexly interwoven categories is essential if we hope to formulate more ethical approaches to nonhu- man nature that don't simply re-stage (and reinscribe) our own social relations. While Treadwell's approach to this untangling is sometimes problematic, it is an approach rooted in love. And it is a small step in the right direction. Commonplace Nature: Cyborg Animals and Environmental Ethics While they provide interesting case studies, Grizzly Man and Penguins also suggest new ways to think through environmental ethics more broadly and point in new directions for the study of wildlife film. These films teach us that environmentalism should acknowledge not just that human and nonhuman animals share a home, but also that we share a subject position: animality. Even</page><page sequence="31">Love of Nature 83 while Penguins and Grizzly Man uphold human-nature boundaries at times, they urge viewers to consider the ways in which these boundaries are becoming increasingly porous. Perhaps in spite of themselves, these films can't help but betray this porousness. In disrupting familiar boundaries, both films also offer the remin- der that we are not in control. Whether we are watching in amaze- ment as hundreds of predictable penguins march miles to breed- Penguins is frank about the fact that "we're not exactly sure how they find their way"- or in awe as unpredictable grizzlies eye their next meal, these cinematic animals embody all we do not know about their social networks, their behaviors, their subjectivities, and perhaps even their emotional lives. What we do not know about other animal species- as shown in the grizzly bear's gaze and in the penguins' apparent ability to mourn- can help to preserve these animals' identities as autonomous, sovereign species. At the same time, this unknowing might spur revaluation of what we think we know about "human nature" and our own animality. Contemporary environmentalism must recognize that humans have "co-evolved" with other animal species, "with historically chan- ging and specific sets of interspecies biotechnosocial relations and with agency a mobile and distributed matter" (Haraway 306). This conception of co-evolution surely applies to both grizzly bears and emperor penguins, as well as to the canine companions who are the focus of Haraway's work. More than that, animals and human- animals "co-constitute each other, at least partly" (307). The "co-evolution story" is important because it "redoes the story of the human place in nature in homely ways that also impact on fortifica- tions between categories of nature and culture" (308). It is precisely these "fortifications" that March of the Penguins and Grizzly Man attend to and, I have argued, work to "redo" in ambivalent but potentially productive ways. Although these films threaten to exclude nature from everyday life by locating it on remote frontiers- the relatively un-homely places of Alaska and Antarctica- they use these environments to situate animals as human-like. Sometimes in spite of the films' narra- tive intentions, whether Herzog's argument about nature's "indiffer- ence" or Jacquet's erasure of penguin identity, the inhospitable locations reinforce the impression that the films' animal subjects have rightful existences apart from human beings. While such depictions fail to underline our co-evolution with animal species, they do provide a space in which animals possess their own subjectivities. At the same time, these films remind us that even the most remote</page><page sequence="32">84 ISLE frontiers have been infiltrated by human access and impact. The autonomy of nonhuman animals, as represented on camera, points back to the fact that we do share a single home- earth- with these sovereign species. Nature is, then, "a commonplace" (Haraway 65). Environmental- ism must re-imagine issues in ways that are what Haraway calls "homely"- that is, in ways that reaffirm a belief in nature itself as home, as our everyday world, which is shared with our "other- worldly" roommates, nonhuman animals. Insofar as the films blur the lines between human and nonhuman animals, I'd suggest they do, help us reimagine "home" as "the place for which we take responsi- bility, the place we try to sustain" (Cronon 89). As William Cronon explains, a broader conception of "home" does not mean we can avoid using and altering that home. But, he says, "if we acknowledge the autonomy and otherness of the things and creatures around us- an autonomy our culture has taught us to label with the word 'wild'- then we will at least think carefully about the uses to which we put them, and even ask if we should use them at all" (89). Of course, whether these films prompt human viewers to respect nonhuman animals, the environment, or each other, remains to be seen. Bousé reminds us that "the fact that we can be led to empathize and identify with wild animals should not be taken to imply that we will necessarily care enough about them to take action on behalf of their protection or welfare" (130). And Chris cautions that, while viewers might congratulate themselves for "making a good media choice," they may be more interested in the cultural capital generated by such "high-value" knowledge than they are in turning that knowl- edge into action (xii). Much more optimistically, in her tribute to Treadwell on the Grizzly People website, Louisa Willcox claims that "[n]o one who had seen Timothy's photos and films, or heard him speak did not, for a moment, reflect upon wild nature afresh, deeply, personally, and with a renewed energy to defend it." I find myself in the camp of more cautious optimists, like Ursula Heise, who specu- lates that in some cases "the advocacy of the cyborg animal can be viewed as at least in part a call to abandon speciesist prejudice and to accept alternative life-forms as beings with an existence and rights of their own" (77). Cinematic animal representations might "take us, through the discovery of otherness in our own technological cre- ations, to the recognition of and respect for the nonhuman others we did not make" (78). While she is addressing more clear-cut cyborg forms- like the electric sheep of Philip K. Dick fame- I suspect her argument applies more broadly to filmic animals like the emperor penguins and Alaskan grizzlies.</page><page sequence="33">Love of Nature 85 To the extent that these two films are exemplary, we might assert that documentary wildlife film has the capacity to facilitate a loving, respectful, emotional -political sensibility toward nonhuman animals, which can form the basis for political action. Of course, this con- clusion is only preliminary; I hope my analysis here opens up other areas for investigation and invites consideration of other wildlife films in regard to questions of love, speciesism, and environmental ethics. For instance, if the wildlife documentary lends itself to the kinds of productive ambiguities I have begun to trace here, then what lessons might we draw from feature films, which do not pretend to be representational or truthful? What kinds of affective relationships between humans and animals do popular films like Old Yeller (1957), Free Willy (1993), and Flicka (2006) depict and encourage? How are wild and domestic animals portrayed differently in terms of affect- in Flicka , for instance, where a mountain lion is shot and killed while a wild horse is tamed, or in Free Willy (now in its third incarnation), where a young boy befriends and releases an Orca whale that has been trapped in an amusement park? Especially given a recent glut of animated films, it seems appropriate to ask whether viewers connect with animated critters differently than they do "real" animals. How does the speciesist camera function in animated films like Over the Hedge (2006), where an enterprising raccoon leads fellow animals into suburbia to replenish their winter food stores, or Open Season (2006), where a domesticated grizzly bear joins a mule deer to defend the forest from hunters? What affective relationships do such films promote? As these questions indicate, the potential for new research in wild- life film is vast and exciting. Given the popularity and abundance of these films, it seems important to ask how love and other affects shape viewers' conceptions of animals and our environments. More broadly, we must acknowledge that nature is increasingly, as Haraway eloquently puts it, "a topic of public discourse on which much turns, even the earth" (65). As the environment becomes much more than just a pressing "topic" for people across the globe, approaching nature with love may prove to be not just an individual affective endeavor, but also a widely attractive "public discourse" that could be politically effective as well. Notes 1. I am grateful to Bridget Keegan for her feedback on this essay as well as to the former participants in the Literature and Environment colloquium</page><page sequence="34">86 ISLE at the University of Washington for helping me sort out my thoughts about these two films. I would especially like to thank Andrea Opitz, who pointed out to me that love was the common thread between them. 2. Chris traces the lineage of both fictional and nonfictional media rep- resentations of wildlife. However, the line between fiction and nonfiction is blurry in this flexible, hybrid genre. Chris rightly considers wildlife film a sputati vely nonfiction" genre, since it often stages scenes or substitutes footage to generate a (fictional) narrative (xx). Grizzly Man and Penguins exemplify the merely "putative" nonfictionality of documentary films invol- ving wildlife; I use the phrase "wildlife film" to refer to this blurry genre. 3. Interestingly, the version of nature Jane Tompkins identifies in the Western applies to these films: "Nature is the one transcendent thing, the one thing larger than man . . . the ideal toward which human nature strives" (71). Further, she explains that the "rhetoric of landscape works in favor of the par- ticular masculine ideals" reinforced by the Western (77). In effect, then, the Western "doesn't have anything to do with the West as such. It isn't about the encounter between civilization and the frontier. It is about men's fear of losing their mastery, and hence their identity" (45). These insights might be useful in a paper strictly focused on Grizzly Man and issues of masculinity. While I will mention some additional resonances with the Western in each film, genre classi- fication is not my primary investment in this essay, nor do I have the space to explore the many intersections between the wildlife and Western genres. 4. Although Brokeback Mountain fits well with my essay's focus on love, its adaptation of Annie Proulx's short story, its explorations of sexuality, and its reinvention of the cowboy figure are complex issues, which demand a level of sustained attention that would require a separate piece. 5. Following Derrida and others, I try to avoid the phrase "the animal," which essentializes all animal species under this general category, unless I am invoking the phrase in order to critique it. I opt, instead, for the plural form, animals. When possible, I identify animals by their particular species. 6. For two excellent collections of film studies work that pushes theoreti- cal boundaries "in the relative absence of the grand theories that once ani- mated the field" (Gledhill 2000: 5), see the anthologies by Williams (1997) and Gledhill (2000). 7. This film's camera is raced as well as gendered. When Freeman tells us the penguin fathers have a hard time leaving their chicks, for instance, American spectators might hear this comment in terms of the social politics of this country, conjuring concerns about absentee (or imprisoned) African- American fathers. 8. For a detailed analysis of filmic animals and issues of gender and sexu- ality, see the chapter "Animal Sex" in Chris's Watching Wildlife. 9. 1 recognize that cinema studies work has long relied on psychoanalytic theory to think through love. However, insofar as it theorizes love as primar- ily desire, this body of work is less useful in considering the sort of trans- species love I identify in these films. In addition to Mulvey's essay, see Silverman and Gledhill (1999) for recent cinema studies work involving gender and psychoanalysis.</page><page sequence="35">Love of Nature 87 10. For a limited answer to this question, see Leah Rozen's "How Did They Do That?" 11. The original French version is arguably even more anthropomorphic than the American version. According to Joe Leydon, Jacqueťs French film focuses on only one penguin couple and has actors "voice the penguins mur- muring sweet nothings to each other" (Leydon 60). 12. Matt Walker reminds us that scientific data complicates the film's cele- bration of penguin monogamy, since approximately "15 per cent of adult emperors change partners every year. And some penguins engage in homo- sexual activities" (17). 13. For an example of a reviewer who also uses this rhetoric, see Josh Larsen's description of the penguins as "beautifully designed to survive, even thrive, in an unforgiving land" (52). 14. Recently, elephants' ability to mourn the loss of loved ones has received increasing attention, as proponents of "the elephant-breakdown theory" explore the animals' reactions to the "collapse of elephant culture" in Africa, Indian, and areas in Southeast Asia (Siebert 47, 44). Charles Siebert explains that "[w]hen an elephant dies, its family members engage in intense mourning and burial rituals" (45). Elephants are generally acknowledged to have acquired not only mourning rituals, but also an "elaborate communi- cation system" (45). 15. It is worth noting that Hollywood cinema is riding the crest of the penguin wave. Two more family films about penguins have arrived, and these are animated. Happy Feet , a Warner Bros, film, continues the caricature of the emperor penguins and gives them voices- or rather, gives most of them voices. This film's protagonist is a penguin named "Mumble" who cannot sing and is, according to Warner Bros., a "misfit" in a land "where each [penguin] needs a Heartsong to attract a soul mate." It seems, then, that the heteronormative breeding message is critical to this film, as it is to March of the Penguins. Notably, one of the posters for sale on the Happy Feet MySpace page showcases Mumble and the text "Don't Be Afraid: I Love You!" While one would suspect this film does not mix its entertainment with the promise of education, some reviewers have deemed it "an animated version of An Inconvenient Truth" and have condemned the infusion of a chil- dren's film with "propaganda." CNN Headline News's Glenn Beck made the analogy to An Inconvenient Truth , as did Fox News's Neil Cavuto. Cavuto also offered a blanket condemnation of the inclusion of political themes in "a kids movie." For recaps of these reactions, see http://mediamatters.org/ items/200611210008. Another penguin cartoon, Sony's Surfs Up , premiered in the summer of 2007. 16. Herzog seems to directly reference McCandless when he goes to Florida to interview Treadwell's parents and better determine "what drove Timothy into the wild." Herzog speculates that, like McCandless, Treadwell wanted to escape the safety of his middle-class background, from which his parents say he emerged as "an all-American boy: handsome, athletic, full of promise." 17. The irony here is that Herzog is his own rugged individual: passio- nate, intense, even maniacal at times in his drive to create cinematic art.</page><page sequence="36">88 ISLE Perhaps best known for pulling a gun on actor Klaus Kinski and for directing his film crew to drag a ship over a mountain in the Andes during the filming of Fitzcarraldo, Herzog has always been drawn to charismatic individuals like Treadwell. For more on Herzog's cinematic goals (including his quest for "ecstatic truth"), see Zalewski. 18. See William Cronon's influential essay "The Trouble with Wilderness; Or, Getting Back to the Wrong Nature" for a concise genealogy of the American wilderness ideology. 19. See Howard. 20. See Grizzly People, Russell. 21. The fact that Treadwell was killed by a bear should be weighed against the fact that he spent 36,000 successful hours living amidst their species (see Russell). There were also several unusual factors that contributed to Treadwell's death that particular summer. Due to a mix-up concerning his airline ticket, he and Huguenard had returned to the "grizzly maze" later in the season than in previous summers; many of the bears they had become familiar with had gone into hibernation, and new ones had come into the region. It was one of these unknown bears that killed them. 22. The nonprofit Treadwell and Huguenard worked for, Grizzly People, describes its mission in similar terms: "to elevate the grizzly to the kindred state of the whale and dolphin through supportive education in the hopes that humans will learn to live in peace with the bear, wilderness and fellow humans."
