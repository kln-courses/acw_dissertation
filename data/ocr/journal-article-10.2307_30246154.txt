<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE POTTERS OF PORVENIR: THE LESSER KNOWN ARTISANS OF MATA ORTIZ SCOTT H. RYERSON 1928 E. 8th Street Tucson, AZ 85719 KIVA, Vol. 60, No. 1, 1994 ABSTRACT Since 1976 the town of Mata Ortiz, Chihuahua, has become well known for the pottery it produces. Attention has focused on Juan Quezada (the creator of the new tradition) and his family, while potters not related to Quezada have received less recognition. Many of these potters live in Porvenir, the southernmost barrio of Mata Ortiz. A short history and description of the town indicates some of the ways in which Porvenir differs from the other barrios. Differences in potterymaking are described, and brief histories of three potterymaking Porvenir families are presented. Because it has been suggested that the pottery of Mata Ortiz is Indian-made, the ethnicity of the residents of Mata Ortiz is investigated. The conclusion is drawn that they are neither the descendants of Paquime nor Indians in any sense in which that term is used in Mexico today, but rather mestizos from various parts of Mexico. RESUMEN Desde 1976 el pueblo de Mata Ortiz, Chihuahua, ha sido bien conocido por la cerdmica que produce. La atenci6n se ha enfocado a Juan Quezada (creador de esta nueva tradicidn) y su familia, dejando a los otros alfareros no aparentados a Juan Quezada, con menos reconocimiento. Muchos de estos alfareros residen en el Porvenir, un barrio al sur de Mata Ortiz. Tanto en la historia corta asi como las descripciones del pueblo, pueden palparse algunas de las formas de como El Porvenir es distinto de otros barrios. En este trabajo se describen las diferencias tecnol6gicas alfareras de este barrio, y se narra una historia breve de las tres familias del Porvenir. Se investiga tambie'n, la etnicidad de los residentes de Mata Ortiz ya que se ha sugerido que es una alfareria indigena. Se concluye que los alfareros no son ni los descendientes de Paquime, ni son indigenas en ninguna manera como este termino es en la actualidad usado en Mexico, sino que son mestizos que vinieron de diferentes partes de Mdxico. The impressive ruins of Paquim6 (Casas Grandes) lie slightly less than 110 km (70 miles) south of the United States-Mexico border in the state of Chihuahua, Mexico. Situated on the west bank of the Casas Grandes River, Paquim6, the presumed center of the prehistoric Casas Grandes culture, reached its zenith during the Medio period, which Dean and Ravesloot's (1993) revised dendrochronology places between A.D. 1200 and 1500. The aesthetic excellence of the distinctive Casas Grandes polychrome pottery was recognized (Kidder 1977 [1916]; 1962 [1924]) for decades before the 1958 to 1961 excavations at Paquim6 by Charles Di Peso and the Joint Casas Grandes Expedition (Di Peso 1974; Di Peso and others 1974). Only 24 km (15 miles) south of Paquim6, in the village of Mata Ortiz, pottery is once again being made. In recent years, Mata Ortiz has become 93</page><page sequence="2">94 RYERSON Nuevo Casas o 5 Kilometers Grandes I - Grandes 0 3 Miles Casas Grandes Paquime ' Coloniao Juarez ' (' Cuouhtemoc 0, San Diego ' anl I da AZ NM .TuQs o .Los Cruces % iTX Santa Rosa\ Map Location I f Map Location Figure 1.

Such recognition is perhaps even more surprising given the relative obscurity of this village in northwestern Chihuahua. A BRIEF HISTORY OF MATA ORTIZ The full name of Mata Ortiz (Figure 1) is Juan Mata Ortiz, but it is seldom called that, even on maps. It is occasionally referred to as "J. Mata Ortiz," but usually just Mata Ortiz and apparently this has been the case for decades. The town was originally named Pearson after Dr. Fred Stark Pearson, president of the Mexico Northwestern Railway Co.(abbreviated as MNW). Characterized as one of the "three most important American entrepreneurs operating in ... Latin America after 1900," F. S. Pearson is also thought to have been "the most important consulting electrical engineer in the world" at that time (Chace 1982:2,3) (see End Note). The town was founded in November 1909 on 300 hectares (1.16 square miles) of land that the newly incorporated MNW had purchased from General Luis Terrazas, a legendary cattle baron and former governor of Chihuahua (Hoard 1928). Terrazas owned San Diego, a hacienda at the confluence of the Palanganas and Piedras Verdes rivers, which join to form the Casas Grandes River some 15 km (9.5 miles) south of Paquim6. San Diego was only one of several hacien- das Terrazas owned in Chihuahua, and a rather minor one at that (Wasser- man 1984:49). Today, the road from the Mormon colony of Colonia Juarez to Mata Ortiz passes by the buildings of this former hacienda, and in spite of their dilapidated condition, one can still catch a glimpse of their former splendor (Lister and Lister 1966). The acreage acquired by the MNW was located at the southern end of the San Diego holdings. There the railroad crossed the Palanganas River, on its route south towards Madera where it connected with existing MNW trackage. It was also on this site that the MNW chose to build the town of Pearson. Two huge sawmills were planned for Pearson in order to exploit the plentiful timber resources of the nearby Sierra Madre (Kerr and Donovan 1968). Their combined projected production would have placed them among the largest in the world, and Pearson was envisioned as "a modern town [with] everything necessary for the operation of the plant" (Hoard 1928:38). The sawmills were built, but much more slowly than planned due to construction cost overruns and the interruptions and depredations caused by the Mexican Revolution (1910-1920). In February 1914 the mills were se- verely damaged by the renegade "general" Maiximo Castillo (Chace 1982: 30). Their near destruction was only one of several tremendous losses suf-</page><page sequence="4">96 RYERSON fered by the MNW during the revolution (Hulse 1986) - losses that forced the railroad into receivership in 1914. Even though some lumber was pro- duced between 1917, when one of the still uncompleted mills was started up, and 1921, when it was apparently closed for good (Hoard 1928:38), neither the mills nor the town of Pearson ever reached the stature that had initially been envisioned. The possibility of post-revolution recovery was hampered by the reduced demand for lumber in the United States after World War I (Hoard 1928:38) and the death in 1915 of F. S. Pearson and his wife, both passengers on the Lusitania (New York Times, 9 May 1915a:II3). In 1925, the name of the town was changed to Juan Mata Ortiz (Almada 1945:436), although several Americans continued to refer to it as Pearson (Hoard 1928; Brand 1937; DeAtley and Findlow 1982:264). Juan Mata Ortiz was a local hero of the Apache Wars and was second in command at the de- feat and death of Chief Victorio in 1880. On 13 November 1882, Mata Ortiz and a small number of troops were annihilated by some of Chief Juh's men. Mata Ortiz was tortured to death, being hated by the Apaches because of his involvement in a massacre of unarmed Apaches near Casas Grandes the pre- ceding year (Lister and Lister 1966:166; Almada 1968:326; Thrapp 1974: 293-307, 376 note 25). It would appear that many of the families who had come to Pearson seeking work during the revolution decided to stay and farm the fertile lands of the Palanganas Valley. The exact nature of Pearson/Mata Ortiz during the four decades following the revolution is unclear. At some point after 1928, the railroad built a large machine shop that provided many jobs for the men of Mata Ortiz, and for a while the town had stores, hotels, restaurants, and a post office with mail delivery. The machine shop was moved to Nuevo Casas Grandes around 1959 or 1960, and the resulting loss of jobs sent Mata Ortiz into severe economic decline, which coincided with Di Peso's excavations at Paquim6 (1958- 1961). Unfortunately, these investigations stimulated the black market for prehistoric Casas Grandes pottery. Before long, many in Mata Ortiz and the surrounding region began to supplement their income by pothunting, an illegal, and therefore risky, pursuit that did not pay particularly well. It was in this larger social and economic context that the new tradition of pottery manufacture originated and developed. When Juan Quezada be- gan making and selling pottery around 1970, a legal and welcome alternative source of income was realized. It caught on slowly at first, but by the early 1980s several families found it profitable, and today the economy of Mata Ortiz is largely dependent upon pottery manufacture. Quezada and several of his brothers and sisters were the first to benefit from this new occupation, and nearly all subsequent attention to the evolving potterymaking tradition has focused on this family. But Quezada and his extended family are not the</page><page sequence="5">The Potters ofPorvenir 97 o 2 Kilometers O I Mile I *k N c:? ).

MATA ORTIZ AND BARRIO PORVENIR TODAY The village of Mata Ortiz is divided into six barrios: Barrio de la Plaza, the central portion of the town, which is also called Barrio Centro (Williams 1991:38); four small barrios (Iglesia, Americano, Adobe, and L6pez) north of Barrio de la Plaza, and Barrio Porvenir south of the town's center (Fig- ure 2). I estimate the population of the entire village to be 1,500. The first barrio one sees from the point where the rutted road crests the last hill and the town comes into view is Barrio de la Plaza, "downtown." Because most of the Quezadas live here and because it is the obvious center of town, many tourists visit only this barrio. Mata Ortiz is bounded on the east by the Palanganas River. The western and northern boundaries of Barrio de la Plaza are the railroad tracks. The once important railroad presence has been reduced to the tracks, the closed, fenced-off station around which people still await the two daily trains, and a small section house on the west side of the tracks that lies immediately north of a large arroyo, Arroyo Secci6n. This arroyo is usually dry, but when it runs, vehicular traffic must stop, and to cross, people must walk the railroad trestle. This arroyo constitutes the southern boundary of Barrio de la Plaza, separating it both physically and symbolically from Barrio Porvenir on the other side. The residents of the northern barrios view Porvenir as the "other side of the tracks," or arroyo in this case. They say that there are more incidents of drunkenness, less organization (see Williams 1991:39 regarding the town's water supply), and more involvement in illicit activities, both now and in the past, than in the northern barrios. Many believe that Barrio de la Plaza is much older than Porvenir, and that when Barrio de la Plaza was full, people crossed the arroyo and began to settle Porvenir (Williams 1991:3-9). This may be an incorrect assumption. My interviews with various Porvenir families indicate that Porvenir is as old as the rest of town. My own hypothesis, which awaits further documenta- tion, is that during the days when Mata Ortiz was called Pearson, the Ameri- cans lived in the wooden houses that were once in Barrio Americano. The merchants, many of whom were Chinese; technical workers, such as railroad engineers, machinists, and school teachers; and bureaucrats lived in the more substantial adobe buildings in Barrio de la Plaza, while the common laborers and farmers lived in Porvenir. If true, it would seem that the "other side of the arroyo" dichotomy existed from the beginning. In many ways Barrio Porvenir (The Future) is like a town unto itself,</page><page sequence="7">The Potters ofPorvenir 99 both physically and in the minds of the residents of Mata Ortiz. The houses are farther apart than are those in Barrio de la Plaza. Large gardens with a few fruit trees are in evidence everywhere, as are chickens or turkeys in the yards or here and there a pig in a pen, giving this barrio a more agrarian feel. There are fewer walls around the houses and yards; people's lives thus seem more open. One often sees a woman drawing water from the well behind her house, wash on the line, folks walking to the outhouse, and smoke curling upward from the mounds of cow chips or cottonwood bark indicating that pottery is being fired. Such vignettes are common in Porvenir, much more so than in the rest of Mata Ortiz. Often the homes are smaller than those of their northern neighbors. In general, the barrio appears less affluent, and it prob- ably is. I would estimate that in 1993, there were approximately 75 house- holds in Porvenir, or about 30 percent of the population of Mata Ortiz. Although the inhabitants of Porvenir feel a social separation from the rest of town, they see themselves as more cohesive, in part because of the tightly interrelated families. Porvenir residents talk about having to go "over to town," referring to Barrio de la Plaza, and there is a definite "we/they" attitude on the part of both groups. As might be expected, the Mata Ortiz town church is in Barrio Iglesia toward the north end of town, but Porvenir has its own small chapel. The residents of Porvenir view the larger church as the church; they see their chapel as auxiliary. But they are very devoted to their chapel, and the present village priest holds service there as well as at the main church each Sunday morning. This chapel and its patron, the Virgin of Guadalupe, also serve as the focal point for a group of matachin dancers, a group made up of Porvenir residents including members from all three of the families to be discussed. The rural roots of Porvenir are perhaps most strikingly expressed in the pub- lic religious ceremonies in which the matachin dancers honor the Virgin of Guadalupe on 12 December (see Burckhalter 1991); San Jose, the patron saint of the main church, on 19 March; Holy Week; and San Isidro, the patron saint of farmers, on 15 May. In addition, they accept invitations to dance at other times, which they do free of charge, except for expenses. The cultural origin of the Porvenir matachines is most likely mestizo. Matachin dancers appear in both Indian and non-Indian communities in many areas of Mexico and the western United States. While many mestizo communities in northern Mexico, both rural and urban, have matachin danc- ers, there is Ittle information about them except for Griffith's (1969) brief account of one such group in Los Mochis, Sinaloa, and Saldafia's notes in Kurath (1967:267-269). In any event, the matachin dancers of Porvenir are an interesting aspect of the Porvenir "subculture," which serves to set it apart from the other barrios.</page><page sequence="8">100 RYERSON A BRIEF HISTORY OF POTTERYMAKING IN PORVENIR In spite of the differences among the barrios of Mata Ortiz, a character- istic shared by the entire village is pottery production. Considering that to- day the economy of Mata Ortiz is based on potterymaking, it is perhaps sur- prising that the industry began just over two decades ago. This new tradition was first brought to the attention of the American public by Spencer Mac- Callum, an anthropologist and art historian by training (MacCallum 1969, 70). In March of 1976, he came to Mata Ortiz looking for the maker of three Casas-Grandes-style pots he had purchased earlier in Deming, New Mexico (MacCallum 1977, 1978a, 1979). Over the next eight years, MacCallum (1977, 1978a, 1979) documented not only the history and changes in Juan Quezada's work, but also his own significant involvement in the development of the tradition. Without his efforts, much of the information concerning the initial development of this craft would probably not have been recorded. Everyone interested in this area owes a great debt to MacCallum (1977, 1978a, 1979, 1981), for his doc- umentation of the early years of potterymaking in Mata Ortiz. Unfortunately, MacCallum's published documentation is limited with respect to the potters of Porvenir. In 1976 when MacCallum began to make frequent visits to the village from California, several Porvenir potters were already working, namely, FElix Ortiz, credited by his neighbors as having been Porvenir's first pottery; F6lix's older brother Emeterio; their half- brother-in-law Salbador Ortiz; and perhaps their second cousin Rojelio Silveira. By 1977, when MacCallum (1977:37) published a list of potters, he apparently had not yet discovered these Porvenir potters, for none of them is included on this list. However, by 1978, MacCallum was illustrating Felix's work in his articles and exhibiting it alongside that of the Quezadas. About this time MacCallum established the same sort of contractual agreement with F6lix Ortiz that he had with Juan Quezada, but because of F6lix's slower pace of improvement it did not last for long (MacCallum, per- sonal communication 1994). Consequently, MacCallum spent comparatively less time in Porvenir, but he did note that there were "several other potters who [had] learned from [F6lix Ortiz]" (MacCallum 1980:2). He believed that the work of these potters was stylistically distinct and of much poorer quality than that of the Quezadas. In spite of the informational foundation laid by MacCallum, the appear- ance of pottery at many shows and demonstrations throughout the U.S., and the widespread sale of pottery, published information on Mata Ortiz essen- tially ceased after MacCallum stopped visiting the village on a regular basis in 1983. Only recently has additional documentation become available (Freeman 1989; Cahill 1991; Williams 1991; Parks 1993). Although these</page><page sequence="9">The Potters ofPorvenir 101 writers address various aspects of the pottery tradition, they, like Mac- Callum, still focus more on the barrios north of the arroyo rather than on Porvenir. This neglect, noted by Williams (1991:7), continues despite his re- alization that, "per capita, there are probably more potters in this area [Porvenir] than in the [other barrios of Mata Ortiz]" (Williams 1991:39). Williams (1991:2) acknowledges the Quezada-centric nature of prior work, and his description of Roberto Bafiuelos and Angela Lopez is a good begin- ning at establishing a balance. Freeman's (1989) rather obscure article in Spanish only briefly mentions a few of the Porvenir potters and their work. There are several reasons why the potters of Porvenir are less well known. The most obvious is that the early Porvenir pottery was, compared to the work of Juan Quezada, relatively mediocre, although in the last six years I have seen quality improve dramatically in the barrio as a whole. It was the superb quality of Quezada's work that had captured MacCallum's attention. Intensifying this attraction was the fact that Juan had been the first potter, apparently inventing his ceramic technology de novo (MacCallum 1977, 1978a, 1979). This feat, in and of itself, is phenomenal and worthy of anyone's attention. Furthermore, Quezada has a certain personal charisma that com- bines with these other factors to create a Quezada "mystique" that strongly affects most Americans. In fact, he is one of the most charismatic people I have ever met. Without the exceptional quality of his workmanship, how- ever, neither MacCallum nor the Americans who followed would have appeared or stayed on the scene. In addition, Juan has no family in Porvenir, so Porvenir has not been in his sphere of activities. Because the focus of MacCallum and other Ameri- cans has been primarily on Juan and his family, their attention was directed to the northern barrios. Also a factor is the geographical and visual isolation of Porvenir. From the north side of Arroyo Secci6n, Porvenir appears much smaller than it re- ally is. I surmise that many buyers have driven to the edge of the sandy, rocky arroyo, seen only two or three adobe houses on the far side, and con- cluded that little of interest lay beyond. One of the early buyers told me that, in his opinion, in the early 1980s there were not many people living in Porvenir (Jim Hills, personal communication 1991). THE POTTERY OF PORVENIR Pottery produced in Porvenir differs stylistically and technically from that made in the rest of Mata Ortiz, and until quite recently most of it was of poor quality. In most cases, in order to compensate for the lower prices paid for their poorer quality work, the potters produced in greater quantity, thus</page><page sequence="10">102 RYERSON establishing a self-perpetuating system of low quality and high production. Nevertheless, their work found a niche in the market. The pottery production of Porvenir tends to differ from that of the rest of Mata Ortiz in five principal ways: 1. The Number of Pots Produced. Many potters in the northern barrios will offer for sale only two or three pots at any given time; Williams (1991:149) notes that 10 or more would be viewed as "a big undertaking." In contrast, many families in Porvenir, even families with only one or two potters, may have two dozen or more pieces available on a Saturday after- noon; one extremely prolific family, that of Nicoldis Silveira, can display up to 100. 2. The Use of Large Designs. Most Porvenir potters tend to use large designs that are not intricately painted. Because painting is the single most time-consuming aspect of pottery production (Williams 1991), many more pots can be produced. 3. The Production of Large Pots. Although some potters not living in Porvenir, such as Consolaci6n Quezada and Taurina Baca, make large pots, most of the huge ollas (from 30 to 50 plus cm [12 to 20 inches or more]) come from Porvenir. Some craftspeople such as Miguel Bugarini and his wife Yolanda Soto make large ollas almost exclusively. Large ollas facilitate the use of large designs. Making large ollas is not easy, and not everyone has solved the technical problems involved, but large ollas do bring in a fair amount of money at one time. 4. The Firing of Many Pots at One Time. Many Porvenir potters fire more than one pot at a time in the same fire. Multiple firings seem to be most prevalent within the Silveira family, where firing 10 to 12 small-to-medium pots (either black or polychrome) as a group is commonplace. This contrasts with the practice in the other barrios, where the custom now is to fire only one at a time. The obvious advantage is that this reduces the time needed for firing. It also disproves Hilario Quezada's contention (Williams 1991:93) that several polychrome pots cannot be fired together - a contention indica- tive of the lack of communication existing between Porvenir and the rest of Mata Ortiz. It is not clear whether less fuel per pot is required in group fir- ing, but because the cow chips used for fuel often have to be purchased, a reduction in the amount needed would certainly lower production costs. 5. The Use of Shoe Polish. The most widespread of these five ways in which the pottery of Porvenir differs from that of the rest of Mata Ortiz is the use of shoe polish to impart the final shine to the pot. This technique reduces the amount of time otherwise spent polishing with a stone. It does not, how- ever, eliminate stone polishing. The potters who stone polish exclusively disdain the use of shoe polish (Williams 1991:117). Both buyers and potters often see its use as a dividing line between better and lesser potters.</page><page sequence="11">The Potters ofPorvenir 103 One interesting effect of using shoe polish is that the pot can take on a patina; it acquires the appearance of age, a mellowness that contrasts sharply with the often crisp, precise finishes achieved by stone polishing alone. This use of shoe polish is reminiscent of the practice of some American Indian potters during the earlier decades of this century, of rubbing a pot with mut- ton fat to give it a sheen and to break the harshness. There are other methodological differences, such as preheating the pots in the sun rather than in an oven before firing, or using a commercial clay pot instead of a washtub to protect the pots from direct contact with the burning fuel. These differences also tend to be barrio-specific, but, in my estimation, they do not affect the quality of the end product. The five charac- teristics discussed all have to do with enabling the potter to make pots faster, which in turn, tends to lower the quality of workmanship. It was this lower quality that caused most American buyers to shun the pottery from Porvenir, a situation that has changed only recently. Although nearly all the pottery produced in Mata Ortiz eventually ends up in the United States, until the mid-1980s the Porvenir potters sold their wares almost exclusively to Mexican buyers from Nuevo Casas Grandes and the border towns of Ciudad Juarez and Nogales. These buyers generally paid less and paid in pesos rather than dollars. Goyo Silveira and his wife Gloria Hernandez, two Porvenir potters to be discussed later, view the day their work became good enough to sell to the American buyers as a major turning point in their lives (see also Williams 1991:42-43). THREE POTTERYMAKING FAMILIES OF PORVENIR In order to help the reader become better acquainted with the potters of Porvenir, three short family histories are presented. (A formal census of all potters in Mata Ortiz is being prepared by Michael Williams.) It is hoped that these family histories will provide the reader with a feeling for the com- plex kinship interrelationships within and among families, as well as for the range in quality of workmanship that exists. These histories also indicate where these families came from and when they arrived in Mata Ortiz, back- ground data that will be significant during a later discussion of ethnicity. Three extended families that are important in the production of pottery in Porvenir are described here: the family of F61ix Ortiz, the related Silveiras, and a second Ortiz family. There are other potterymaking families in Porvenir, for example, the Moras, the Sandovals, the Gonzalezes, and the Bugarinis to name a few, but the three families discussed illustrate many of the factors that make Barrio Porvenir, its potters, and its pottery distinctive.</page><page sequence="12">104 RYERSON The Felix Ortiz Family As F6lix Ortiz is one of Mata Ortiz's best known potters and because he is generally credited with having been the first potter in Porvenir, it seems appropriate to begin with his family (Table 1). (Note that the material in Table 1, as well as in Tables 2 and 3, should be considered preliminary; all these tables reflect work in progress.) In about 1910 Jesdis Ortiz, Felix's grand- father, left his home in Salitral de Carreras, San Luis Potosi, and headed west to the city of Zacatecas, 55 km (34 miles) away. (Interestingly, a town only 12 km [7.5 miles] away from Salitral de Carreras is named "El Porvenir.") Within the next year or so he met and married Rumalda Aguilar, a young woman from Hacienda Bafiluelos, which is about 18 km (11 miles) south-southeast of Zacatecas. Their first child, Hesiquio, was born in Guadalupe, a suburb of Zacatecas. Not long after Hesiquio's birth, they left Guadalupe and went to Pearson seeking work on the railroad. Jesuis' broth- ers, Gregorio and Cirildo, and their wives accompanied them. Their arrival, probably in late 1912 or early 1913, would make them one of Mata Ortiz's founding families. Shortly after arriving at their new home, Rumalda gave birth to a daughter, Dolores. Over the years four more children, a son and three daughters, followed. *A POTTER Tiburcio n=O OA NON-POTTER Ortiz I Escalante JesusA=O Rumalda Gregorio A=O Manuela Cirildo A= O Heronima Ortiz Aguilar Ortiz I Perez Ortiz (Moved away c. 1925) (See Table 2) Hesiquio )=O Jesusita O=A Marcos DoloresO= A JesrusA Anita O=A MargaritaO=A Ventura O Ortiz Rodriguez Sandoval Ortiz Ortiz Ortiz Ortiz Ortiz (Moved away) (Never married) (Moved away) (Moved away) (Never married) Eduviges v=ASalbador Rodriguez (Chava) Ortiz (See Table 3) AngelaO=A Jose' EmeterioA=OFelicidad MarcelinaO=A Carlos FilixA=0 Otila TeodoraO=A Reynaldo Ortiz Ortiz Ortiz Loya Ortiz Chanaca Ortiz Sandoval Ortiz Pedregdn 11 Children Ratl A 8 Children Maricela * Raquel (Live near Las Palomas) Ortiz (Live near Galeana) Ortiz Ortiz AAAO a Table 1.

Accord- ing to Emeterio, the disruption caused by the Mexican Revolution precluded the building of this railroad, so Jesus became a farmer. Hesiquio Ortiz married Jesusita Rodriguez and five children were born before his untimely death in 1947 at the age of 36 or 37. Three of these chil- dren - Emeterio, Felix, and Teodora - still live in Porvenir and all pro- duce pottery. Angela, the eldest, moved some years ago, to an ejido near the border town of Las Palomas, Chihuahua, where she still lives with her hus- band and 11 children. Marcelina, the middle child, moved away after mar- riage and died about six years ago. Teodora, youngest of the five children, married Reynaldo Pedreg6n and lives just across the street from her two brothers, Emeterio and F6lix. Teodora and Reynaldo make miniature, small, and average-size pots of aver- age quality. Emeterio, the second of the five children, was born in 1938. For a short period during the late 1950s he was the town's mailman, but after the rail- road machine shop was moved to Nuevo Casas Grandes, the post office closed. He was one of the early potters in Mata Ortiz, following the lead of his younger brother, Fdlix. Both brothers made pottery prior to 1976 when MacCallum arrived. The quality of Emeterio's work is not what it once was, but his average-size ollas, bowls, and figures are reminiscent of the work of many potters a decade or more ago. As such, they have a certain charm, which appeals to enough collectors to absorb the relatively small number he produces. Emeterio is the informal family historian and has saved many old family photographs and various documents. His active interest in the past seems to be something of a rarity in Mata Ortiz. His one son, Rauil, lives in Ciudad Juarez and is not involved with pottery production. Fdlix Ortiz, born in 1942, was the fourth of Hesiquio and Jesusita's five children. Before becoming a potter, he was a farmer. In contrast to many of the other early potters he maintains that he was never a pothunter, that the designs he uses come from books and from his head. He and his wife, Otila Sandoval, have two daughters, Maricella and Raquel. Otila also makes pot- tery, which she signs "Otila de Ortiz." Fdlix is somewhat vague as to what inspired him to begin making pot- tery. When asked, his recollections often seem contradictory. During one telling of the story he related how he watched Juan Quezada work; retelling the story, he and Juan had almost no contact. He speaks of early experiments with his half-brother-in-law Salbador Ortiz. This hitherto undocumented re- lationship helps explain how pottery production spread to the other Ortiz family.</page><page sequence="14">106 RYERSON Unlike most potters, F61lix does not work in his home but in a small one- room outbuilding between his house and Emeterio's. I am sure that F61ix is correct when he says, "A lot of people learned to make pottery in that little room [his workroom]." And in many ways, what they learned helped estab- lish the Porvenir style that exists today. Fl1ix's pottery tends to be large, often with big, bold designs as opposed to intricate ones (MacCallum 1979:73; Cahill 1991:63-64, note polychrome pot at lower left on pg. 63). This boldness is, I believe, what MacCallum (1978b:3) characterized as "strength of expression and imagination." The pot shown in Black-and- white Plate 6, made by 1980, is stylistically a forerunner of much Porvenir pottery of the 1980s. A few years after the death of her husband, F61ix's mother, Jesusita, gave birth to a daughter, Eduvijes, who goes by her mother's maiden name, Rodriguez. Eduvijes married Salbador Ortiz of the other Ortiz family. Thus, the two Ortiz families became linked, which accounts for Salbador's partici- pating in some of F61ix's early experiments with pottery. The other five of Jesus and Rumalda's children (F61ix's aunts and uncles) and their descendants play no role in the Mata Ortiz pottery tradition. Three of the four daughters moved away after marriage and neither Jesuts nor Ventura ever married. Because F6lix has no sons and Emeterio's only son does not live in Mata Ortiz, after Emeterio and F61lix cease to make pottery, this historic and influ- ential Ortiz family will no longer give its name to the pottery of Mata Ortiz. There is, however, always the possibility that future generations descended from F61ix's daughters might choose to use the surname "Ortiz." Many people related to the Quezadas have chosen to use the surname "Quezada"; it definitely helps to sell pots. Cirildo, Jests Ortiz's youngest brother, and his wife Her6nima, who had accompanied Jesus to Pearson, apparently did not stay long. They moved away about 1925, perhaps back to central Mexico, and there was no contact with them afterwards. Gregorio, the third brother, and his wife Manuela Perez, did live out their lives in Mata Ortiz. Their grandchildren believe that Gregorio was in his early 80s when he died in about 1975. He had been ill for nearly a decade and his death is believed to have been the result of an in- fection brought on by witchcraft. Gregorio and Manuela had at least eight children, but only five - Soledad, Francisco, Carmen, Josefa, and Gregorio, Jr., - reached adult- hood. Of these, the eldest son, Francisco, fathered only one child, who died childless. Carmen lives in Juarez with her family, as does Leonardo, the only child of Josefa mentioned by the rest of the family. Josefa, apparently, was the family's black sheep. Although Gregorio, Jr., continued to reside in Porvenir until his death a year or so ago, all of his children moved away.</page><page sequence="15">The Potters ofPorvenir 107 Consequently, only the eldest daughter, Soledad, now lives in Porvenir as do five of her six children and their families. Four of Soledad's sons have had a great impact on the pottery tradition of Mata Ortiz, especially Porvenir. They are the Silveiras, the most prolific pottery producers in Mata Ortiz. The Silveira Family The Silveira family (Table 2) is one of the larger families in Porvenir, and accounts for a significant percentage of the pottery produced in that bar- rio. Of five brothers and a sister, four of the brothers - Rojelio, Nicolis, Jos6 and Gregorio ("Goyo") - along with their families, make pottery. The remaining brother, Martin, and their sister, Refugia ("Cuca"), do not. These siblings have lived in Porvenir since the accidental death of their father, Juan Silveira, while cleaning a well in about 1958. Prior to that he and his family moved from job to job throughout northwestern Chihuahua. Finding herself widowed with six children, Soledad Ortiz had returned to Porvenir, the home of her parents Gregorio Ortiz and Manuela Perez. A few years after being widowed, Soledad married Francisco Heras. Ac- cording to his stepson Goyo, Francisco treated his six stepchildren as his own and is fondly remembered by them. Francisco had spent many years in the United States, essentially growing up there. He was always curious about his Mexican roots, however, and had returned to Chihuahua in search of them when he met and married Soledad. The rest of his long life - he is believed to have been about 95 when he died - was spent in Mexico. Soledad's eldest son, Rojelio, claims to have been one of the early pot- ters, along with his second cousin, F6lix Ortiz. An admitted former pot- hunter, Rojelio claims to be self-taught and says he began making copies of prehistoric Casas Grandes pottery in the late 1960s. Other potters say that he may not have started quite so early. His family insists that he was one of the first potters but that he did not produce much, so he was not well known. In addition, they maintain that when he began making pottery he did not get much exposure because he and his family lived on a ranch out of town. Rojelio's production remains low, and like many others of his generation (he was born in 1944) his expertise and desire to improve his work seem to have reached a plateau. The next eldest son, Nicolis, his wife Genoveva Sandoval, and several of their eight children have never seemed to worry much about quality. Their interest is in quarttity. No other family makes more pots than they do. Like many families, they work all week and then fire on Saturday morning. By Saturday afternoon there are sometimes more than a hundred medium-to- large-size pots in their home, the fruit of one week's labor. These will most likely all be gone by Saturday night, sold to the Mexican buyers who spe- cialize in corriente (run-of-the-mill) pottery.</page><page sequence="16">108 RYERSON Tiburcio A=0 Ortiz Escalante OA POTTER OA NON-POTTER Jesus A=0 Rumalda Gregorio O Manuela Cirildo v=OHerodnima Ortiz Aguilar Ortiz Perez Ortiz I T(Moved away c. 1925) (See Table 1) Juan A=0SoledadO=AFrancisco Francisco a Carmela 0 JosefaO ACayetano OValentina GregorioZnOElvira (Three died in childhood) Silveira Ortiz Heras Ortiz Pedregon Lujan Ortiz Sema (b.1917) Leonardo A=O A Reynaldo (Children moved away) Ortiz Pedregodn (Lives in Juarez) (See Table 1) Rojelio A=O Monserat Nicolas A=O Genoveva Martiln A=0 Jose A= Socorro Gregorio A=* Gloria RefugiaO(A Elijio Silveira Sandoval Silveira Sandoval Silveira Silveira Sandoval (Goyo) Hernandez (Cuca) (Chacho) Silveira Silveira Villa (Lives in Viejo Casas Grandes) llll FTII 1 II I III III rl71 OAAAAAAy0ooooAAO 0 0 00oA00 AOoAoAoo 00000 Table 2.

Jos6 is mar- ried to Socorro Sandoval, and together they make the best pottery produced by the Silveira family. They have a great deal of business acumen, having branched out into selling gas, oil, and kerosene. Along with their two older daughters Silvia and Trinidad, they make everything from miniature to quite large pieces and are the best paid, per piece, of the Silveiras. Goyo and his wife Gloria Hernandez (Bell, this issue) are best known for their large ollas (Black-and-white Plate 3), although they also produce miniature and average-size pots. Even though they work together, they paint different designs, Goyo specializing in geometric designs, while Gloria favors often fanciful animals. Each signs his or her own work. Because of the combination of large size and adequate quality, their work is often exhib- ited along with that of much better potters, who do not produce such large pots. They, too, have branched out economically. They operate a small abarrotes (corner store) from the front room of their home that is reputed to have the best fresh vegetable selection in Mata Ortiz. The Descendants of Salvador Ortiz One block due east of Goyo and Gloria live Santos Ortiz, Sr., and Julia Estrada, a charming older couple. Their six sons are the core of the second Ortiz family making pottery in Porvenir (Table 3). Santos was the second eldest of Salvador Ortiz and Tomasa CQirdenas' eight children, but of these eight, only Santos and his brother Aureliano stayed in Porvenir. Santos was born there in 1923, a little more than a block from where he now lives. His father, Salvador, had come north from Zaca- tecas in about 1917, at the age of 14, following the advice of his elder brother Manuel, who notified those staying back home that there was good farm land available in northern Chihuahua. In several ways the histories of the two Ortiz families are strikingly similar. Both came from or through Zacatecas, both consisted of sets of brothers, both were seeking work, and both left their original homes during the period of revolutionary unrest. Some members of the two Ortiz families think that because both families came from Zacatecas and have the same surname, they are probably related in some way, but the relationship is untraceable. Salvador may not have come directly to Pearson/Mata Ortiz. He may have spent some time working in the mines at Corralitos as his wife was from there. Her father worked in the mines, and it was common for laborers and their families to be moved north from Zacatecas to work the mines of Chihuahua (Parker 1979:21-47). Once the revolution began, however, it was often difficult for the foreign-owned mines and railroads to maintain an</page><page sequence="18">106 RYERSON Ortiz A=O ? _* A POTTER OA NON-POTTER Manuel A=ONicolasa Salvador A=O Tomasa Ortiz Ramirez Ortiz Cirdenas 4 Children Ruben A=0 Josefina Panfilo A Santos A=0 Julia AurelianoA=O(Mar(a?)

By 1921 Salvador and Tomasa had moved to Pearson, where their first child, Pinfilo, was born. Although farm- ing was Salvador's main livelihood, he may also have done some occasional railroad work. His older brother Manuel and his family also moved to Mata Ortiz, but somewhat later. Only one of Manuel's children, Ruben, remained in town but Rub6n's children are not involved with pottery. As mentioned, only brothers Santos and Aureliano remained in Por- venir. Even though Aureliano had nine children, from a potterymaking per- spective, the branch descended from Santos and his wife Julia Estrada is more important. This couple had seven children, six of whom make pottery. Their six sons are, by age, Salbador ("Chava"), Santos, Jr., Eduardo ("Chevo"), Osbaldo, Macario, and Nicolas. The only daughter, Amalia, the youngest of the seven, now lives in the state of Aguas Calientes and is no longer a potter, although before she left Mata Ortiz she was learning to work with clay. The six brothers, all of whom still live in Porvenir, can be divided into two groups. The first consists of Eduardo, Macario, and Nicolas, each of whom is an exceptional potter. They produce some of the finest pottery in Mata Ortiz, let alone Porvenir. The second group - Chava, Santos, and Osbaldo - is competent, but average, each potter with his own style. Chava, eldest of the seven siblings, and his wife Eduvijes Rodriguez make miniature and small pots as well as various human and animal effigies. Although Chava's pots may lack quality of workmanship, they often have a unique charm that appeals to a certain portion of the market. Santos, Jr., and his wife Berta Chac6n, along with two of their four chil- dren, produce good, reasonably priced Casa-Grandes-style ollas. Although they work with three or four different sizes, they do not make miniature pots or very large ones. Their strong, bold colors and designs are distinctive. Osbaldo, married to Teresa Ibarra, is also best known for his effigies, which are in bas-relief on the sides and tops of his pots. He is stylistically indebted to his younger brother Nicolas, although, as with Chava, the quality of his workmanship does not approach that of his younger brother. Macario was one of the potters who learned in F6lix Ortiz' workshop. He and, to a lesser extent, Eduardo are known for their striking blackware. They obtain an almost gun-metal finish by diligent stone polishing enchanced further with graphite. Perhaps first used by Macario, graphite, a commercial product, is now employed by many Mata Ortiz potters (Color Plate 2, Black-and-white Plates 4 and 7). Both buyers and potters are divided as to the merits and liabilities of using this product (Bell, this issue). Regard- less, in skilled hands its use produces a beautiful and very saleable pot. On a per-pot basis Macario is one of the best paid potters in Mata Ortiz, his work commanding three to five times that of most good potters. Macario's wife,</page><page sequence="20">112 RYERSON Maria Elena ("Nena") Lopez has also become an accomplished potter, known for her unpainted and often uniquely shaped black pots. Without any doubt, Nicolhs Ortiz is the best potter in this family. Not only is his work technically excellent, it is often highly innovative as well. Although his more traditional Casas-Grandes-style pieces are striking, he is better known for his extremely intricate anthropomorphic and zoomorphic effigies, several of which are illustrated by Freeman (about 1988). In 1984, the pottery of both Nicolhs and Macario was decent but average Porvenir pottery. Their careers and their pottery would soon benefit from their association with Debi Flanagan Bishop, a Tucson craftsperson, who in the mid-1980s, fell in love with Mata Ortiz, its pottery, and its people. She recalls that when she first arrived, there was nothing visually exceptional about the Ortiz brothers' work, but it was very thin, especially Nicolas' ves- sels. She soon became a dealer, took Nicolhis and Macario to demonstrate at various exhibitions including one in 1986 at the Arizona State Museum, and generally encouraged them to improve their work. To facilitate her interests, she moved to Mata Ortiz, bought a home in Porvenir and has lived there for the last seven years. Although no longer an active dealer, her presence in Porvenir has helped to change the relationship between that barrio and the American market. Now many Americans visiting Mata Ortiz, including some who might not otherwise have bothered going to Porvenir, drop by to say hello and ask her a question or two. While in Porvenir, they often buy a few pots. Debi knows the people of Porvenir well and can direct buyers to various potters, espe- cially new ones who show potential. Her presence in Porvenir to some extent balances the Quezada mystique that brings most potential buyers to Mata Ortiz. These days, Debi chooses to concentrate on her own artwork; she is best known for her cornhusk dolls and wall murals. The other branch of this Ortiz family, fathered by Santos, Sr.'s, brother Aureliano, is comprised of nine children - four sons and five daughters. Only two sons, David and Luis, make pottery at this time. The work of Luis is basic Porvenir corriente ware and until about two years ago, David' s work was similar. Then David began to paint more intricate designs incorporating fairly fine lines. The demand for his pots increased sharply. They now sell for twice what they once did. All three of these families are in most ways quite similar to one another and similar to other families of Porvenir. The rural, agrarian base from which they have come manifests itself in many ways, but as some families have become wealthier through the sale of pottery, changes are taking place. Trucks and cars are replacing horses and wagons. Most potterymaking fami- lies now own televisions and VCRs. Other, more expensive, amenities such as indoor plumbing, available to the better paid potters of the northern bar-</page><page sequence="21">The Potters ofPorvenir 113 rios, are as yet not a reality for the majority. The outhouse is still a fixture in nearly every Porvenir backyard. Today, as in the northern barrios, there exists a great range in the quality of work produced in Porvenir. On the one hand, there is the truly exceptional work of the brothers Nicolas, Macario, and Eduardo Ortiz. At the other end of the continuum is the corriente ware made by potters such as Nicolis Silveira, Luis Ortiz, and others not discussed here. THE MARKETING OF ETHNICITY Prior to MacCallum's involvement at Mata Ortiz, the town's production of low quality pottery was purchased and exported to the United States by buyers primarily from the Nuevo Casas Grandes area. In the U.S. it was sold at gas stations, secondhand stores, Mexican curio outlets, and other such purveyors of cheap Mexican pottery. It fit in with other inexpensive pottery, mostly from central Mexico. It was in such a store that MacCallum first dis- covered Juan's pots. But, as the Quezada pottery improved and soon became excellent under MacCallum's sponsorship, the marketing of this better Mata Ortiz pottery faced, and in many ways continues to face, a dilemma. There existed no niche for it. The American marketplace tends to think (and this was espe- cially true in the mid-1970s) of Mexican pottery as poorly made, occasion- ally functional, but most importantly, cheap. The Quezada pottery met none of these criteria. In the mid-1970s the only places selling well-made, hand- made, and pricey ethnic pottery were the shops and galleries dealing in American Indian art. Because of the stylistic ties to the prehistoric Casas Grandes wares, Mata Ortiz pottery, which is completely handmade, looks "Indian" but as is discussed below, the residents of Mata Ortiz are not Indi- ans. However, primarily by default, it was in these American Indian arts and crafts outlets where most of the better Mata Ortiz pottery was sold. Ameri- cans were not accustomed to paying several hundred dollars for a piece of Mexican pottery, but they were for American Indian pottery. Although it was not MacCallum's intention (personal communication 1994), a statement he made in 1977 created the impression that Mata Ortiz pottery was in some way Indian. In his first published report in American Indian Art Magazine MacCallum (1977:35) wrote, "it is quite probable that Juan Quezada is a descendent of those same ceramicists who for eighteen generations after about A.D. 1060 produced that florescence in north Mexican polychrome pottery which is popularly called Casas Grandes." Although MacCallum's writings regarding the "Indianness" of the Mata Ortiz pottery quickly evolved away from this point of view, his early remark left an im- pression in some parts of the market that the pottery had been legitimized as</page><page sequence="22">114 RYERSON "Indian made," thus allowing it to become part of the lucrative Indian art market in the United States. In 1978 MacCallum (1978a:44) referred to Mata Ortiz as a "mestizo" community, and the next year he stated that, "by some strict interpretations the work of Mata Ortiz is not Indian pottery" (MacCallum 1979:80). Nonetheless, the perception that Mata Ortiz pottery was Indian-made had taken root in the marketplace. In many stores, it is still sold as such today. Some merchant-distributed handouts (Vertical File, Mexican Pottery from Mata Ortiz, Arizona State Museum Library) claim that the potters of Mata Ortiz are descendants of Paquimd, and thus, by definition Indian. For example, one wholesaler provides a professionally printed card to accom- pany each pot. On the front cover it reads, "Native American Indian Pottery from the CASAS GRANDES culture," while inside it states, "This pot was made by a direct descendent of these people, who lives near the ruins of Paquimd, in the village of Juan Mata Ortiz." Although there is also respon- sible promotional material, this claim typifies much of the information that has been used to "educate" the buying public. Some dealers have been reluc- tant to let go of this notion, probably because it helps to sell the pottery. Of course, the residents of Mata Ortiz could be Indians without being the descendants of Paquimd. They could, for example, be the descendants of subsequent Indian groups once indigenous to this area such as the Suma or Concho, but they are not. Griffen (1979, 1983) has shown that these groups died out long ago. In referring to the residents of Mata Ortiz, Williams (1991:176) has noted that "their ancestors were not indigenous to the area and they don't feel any particular kinship to ... Paquim6." My interviews confirm this assertion. I have spoken with several families in addition to the three discussed here, asking them from where they originated. It appears that most arrived during the decade or so after the revolution, having come from many different parts of Mexico, so they could, therefore, be Indians who moved to Mata Ortiz, but again they are not. Perhaps the question to ask is, In Mexico, who is an Indian? Racially based definitions, such as those used in the United States, were discarded de- cades ago, in large part because of the more heterogeneous racial history of the country; almost everyone is a mestizo, that is, has some Indian heritage (Redfield 1940; Whetten 1948). MacCallum (1979:72) noted that "Juan's Indian heritage may be evident in some of the darker facial features on his mother's side," and the same sort of statement could be made for most of Mata Ortiz' inhabitants. Many will say that one or more of their grandpar- ents had Indian features; but, in Mexico, this does not mean that the current descendants are Indian. Instead, in Mexico more culturally based criteria have been utilized. Spicer (1966:66) addressed this question and concluded that Indians in Mexico are those whose "sense of identity as Indians is</page><page sequence="23">The Potters ofPorvenir 115 strong," that is, those who call themselves Indians, and those who speak an Indian language. To the best of my knowledge, with the possible exception of Quezada's father, who speaks some Tarahumara as a result of working on his ranch with Tarahumara Indians (MacCallum 1979:74, personal commu- nication 1994), no one in Mata Ortiz speaks an Indian language, nor have I spoken to anyone who claims to be an Indian. It must be concluded, therefore, that Mata Ortiz is just a rural mestizo community like many others. Its populace is probably no more Indian than that of any other rural village in Mexico where the inhabitants neither speak an Indian language nor claim to be Indian. In fact, they may be less so; rural, northern Chihuahua has been cited by Whetten (1948:366) as an example of one of the least Indian areas in Mexico. Spicer's (1966:87) cautioning words are worth remembering, "The assumption that [in Mexico] all poor people [are] Indian is not justified." CONCLUSIONS The barrio of Porvenir lies at the south end of the town of Mata Ortiz, across an arroyo, and thus is physically separated from the rest of the village. Porvenir is probably just as old as the rest of Mata Ortiz, but is less affluent and has a more rural feeling than the center of town. In the early years of potterymaking in Mata Ortiz much of the pottery made in Porvenir was poorly executed and did not appeal to the quality-conscious American buy- ers. Spencer MacCallum, the only chronicler of the early years of the pot- terymaking phenomenon and the first patron and promoter of Mata Ortiz pottery, focused his attentions on quality, which at that time meant Juan Quezada, selected members of his family, and a few students. Although MacCallum encouraged F61ix Ortiz and regularly included his work in exhi- bitions, his writings provide little information about the other early potters of Porvenir. The Porvenir potters relied on the Mexican buyers who, not having ac- cess to the gallery market in the United States, specialized in the least expen- sive goods they could find. Porvenir was their primary source. As the market expanded during the 1980s, more and more Americans found their way to Mata Ortiz, demand increased, more people in all parts of town took up potterymaking, and more attention was paid to Porvenir. Through the efforts of these new buyers, and especially Debi Bishop, the mid-to-late 1980s saw the quality of Porvenir pottery improve, gradually making its way from gas stations and swap meets to better shops and eventually, for a handful, into galleries. In reconstructing the history of Mata Ortiz and the potters of Porvenir, I have relied heavily on oral history. This has often been frustrating, but at the</page><page sequence="24">116 RYERSON same time fascinating. I hope that the discussions of the Ortiz and Silveira families that were presented, when taken in conjunction with the work of Bell (this issue), will provide a foundation and a stimulus for other researchers. Finally, the role that ethnicity plays in the marketing of the pottery from Mata Ortiz is a subject that applies to the entire town, not just the barrio of Porvenir. I believe that the "Indianness" of the potters has been a common misconception that needs to be rectified. The way the pottery is marketed in the United States directly affects the potters of Porvenir. Because the inhab- itants of Mata Ortiz are mestizos, not Indians, Mata Ortiz pottery is not Indian pottery. Of course, the fact that the pottery is not made by Indians does not mean that it is not good, collectible pottery. Much of it - Quezada's and that of many other potters, including several from Porvenir - is, in fact, excellent work, worthy of display in galleries and museums. Note: That so little information exists on Fred Stark Pearson (1861-1915) is surprising considering that he was a man worth an estimated $50 million at the time of his death (New York Times, 13 July 1915b: 16). I have found little more than what is available in the basic reference works: The Dictio- nary of American Biography, The National Cyclopedia of American Biography, and Who's Who in America. F. S. Pearson was born in Lowell, Massachusetts, of apparently rather modest means, for he was "obliged to seek early employment" (Plummer 1900:446). Nevertheless, he managed to gradu- ate from Tufts College in civil and electrical engineering with some background in both chemistry and mining. He taught at the college level until 1886. In 1889 he became involved with electric railways, and this field, along with electric power companies, was to be his forte. After 1898 his in- terests shifted to foreign enterprises, especially in Latin America. He became involved in Mexico in 1902. In 1909 he purchased the lumber and railroad holdings of Colonel William Greene, owner of the Cananea copper mine. These railroad properties formed the nucleus of the Mexico North- western Railroad Company. F. S. Pearson has often been confused with Weetman Pearson (Lister and Lister 1966:179), an Englishman who later became Lord Cowdray. W. Pearson was also involved with railroad develop- ment in Mexico and was better known than F. S. Pearson. Neither Pearson went down on the Ti- tanic as claimed by Lister and Lister (1966:179). F. S. Pearson and his wife did, however, lose their lives when the Lusitania sank on 7 May 1915 (The Times [Londonl 14 May 1915:11). Acknowledgments.
