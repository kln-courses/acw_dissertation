One of the strengths of the book is Chris- traud Geary's clear and thoughtful explana- tion of the history of the Bamum kingdom and its encounter with Europeans, and of the use of photography as propaganda for support of the colonial effort. Mandou Yenou is also a moving experience for the reader because of the careful juxtaposition of old photographs next to poems written by Adamou Ndam Njoya, a descendant of the king, and the abundance of carefully selected quotations from German accounts and from Njoya's own Histoire (translated into French from the origi- nal Bamum script invented by Njoya and his court scholars). One does not have to hunt through the book to find the illustrations for the text; because of the physical arrangement the relationship of word to image is inescapa- ble. The result is an almost impressionistic af- fect of the sort created by a documentary film. It therefore comes as no surprise to learn from the authors at the end of the book that a paral- lel film has also been made, Mandou Yenou, un roi noir entre adaptation et resistance. Geary gives the archival sources of the photographs and identifies the cast of charac- ters, including Njoya; his powerful mother, Njapndounke; and other members of his fam- ily; and a long list of German officers, mis- sionaries, teachers, ethnographers, busi- nessmen, and assorted officials and wives. Many of these people were photographers as well as writers. Individuals in the photo- graphs have been identified not only by doc- umentation in archives but also in interviews with present Bamum such as Sultan Seidou (Njoya's son and current ruler), one of Njoya's daughters, and a surviving confidant. The captions are generous and informative, always including exact or approximate dates, and the quality of reproduction, considering the age of some of the photographs, is quite remarkable. Geary provides the reader with a brief his- tory of the Bamum kingdom from its estab- lishment in the seventeenth century to the ar- rival of the first German expedition in 1902. She follows with a fascinating account of the role played by photography in encouraging and justifying the commercial exploitation of the new colony. Because most of the Euro- peans socialized with the elite of the kingdom, the photographs show us only the life of the Bamum court and not of the farmers and slaves who made up the bulk of the popula- tion. Only the Basel Mission teacher, Anna Wuhrmann, occasionally made an effort to capture daily life in her photos; most of the others are consciously posed. Another chapter describes and illustrates the capital city of Foumban and Njoya's palace in fascinating detail, from the original pole-and-thatch buildings to the Europeanized houses and schools that sprang up soon after contact. This is followed by chapters on Njoya's redoubtable Queen Mother, Njapndounke, and glimpses of per- sonal life at the court. Njoya's wives and chil- dren and retainers of the court are also given their own chapters. The great palace cere- monies are dealt with more briefly than one might have expected, but their role here is to illuminate the great theater that was the royal city. The real focus of the book is on the drama played out in the more than thirty years of Njoya's ambitious and sometimes naive struggle to assimilate European culture with- out giving up his own. In the end he lost what he tried to save. Njoya was not the only loser, however; many of the Europeans in this scenario were also innocent, equally helpless in the face of history. The moving final chap- ter, "Mandou Yenou," brings events to their final, inexorable conclusion: the destruction of Njoya and a way of life. This is a valuable book, not only as a documentary but as a work of art. Marcilene Wittmer University of Miami AFRICAN DRESS II A Select and Annotated Bibliography Illa M. Pokornowski, Joanne Bubolz Eicher, Moira F. Harris, and Otto Charles Thieme African Studies Center, Michigan State Univer- sity, East Lansing, 1985. 316 pp. $11.25 paper. This bibliography should be considered and used in conjunction with volume I of the same name compiled by Joanne Eicher (published in 1970 and still available at Michigan State University for $4.00). Together the two vol- umes cite and annotate 2,285 books, articles, bibliographies, and assorted other written and pictorial sources on the broad topic of Af- rican dress. Volume II updates and expands upon the first. There are two introductory es- says here, for example, and the annotations are more pointed and thus more useful; North African references, absent in volume I, are in- cluded. The first short essay, "The Study of African Dress," by Thieme and Eicher, correctly draws attention to an expanded awareness of the subject in the past fifteen years and the consequent greater and more specific atten- tion given to it in exhibitions, books, and arti- cles. The authors define dress expansively in three parts: material form, including artifacts worn or held and body modifications (i.e., tat- toos); the act of dressing, which subsumes manufacture, preparation, donning, weav- ing, gesturing, storing, and their associated protocols; socio-cultural meanings (which overlap protocol aspects), including sym- bolism and other communicative functions of dress items and ensembles. A section follows outlining a "conceptual framework" for Afri- can dress. It briefly considers three more re- lated factors: the physical individual, the so- cial organization in which he or she functions, and larger cultural patterns affecting dress- things such as technology, morals, history, ritual, and aesthetics. This overview men- tions many variables and conditioning factors relevant to this broadly construed topic. Some examples are given to show the importance of considering cultural matrixes and local values Continued on page 78 24 .A</page><page sequence="2">reference given is to a letter of March 31st, 1981, but no addressee is indicated. It is in fact an inaccurate quotation from an opinion given by William Fagg to a London dealer about a head which was formerly in the Pitt Rivers collection-but the head in the sale was a different one, of poorer quality. Yet the Sotheby catalogue gave its provenance as "The Pitt Rivers Museum, Farnham." The compiler of the catalogue claims in a letter to me of July 4th, 1985, that he was given the wrong information. Even so, one expects a reputable auction house like Sotheby's to check the provenance and history of a piece of such pretended importance. I understand that a correction was displayed at the view be- fore the sale, but in a very inconspicuous posi- tion. The piece fetched an all-time record. One cannot help wondering whether it would have done so if it had been correctly catalogued. Caveat emptor. Frank Willett Hunterian Museum, Glasgow BELLIGERENT WOMEN? In this day and age does one really have to explain why it is offensive to be hit with John Povey's reference to "the hysterical ar- rival... in Nairobi of 16,000 mostly bellige- rent women who reduced that city to sham- bles" (First Word, February 1986)? Too bad he was bumped from his hotel room, but it seems remarkably insensitive to be so wrapped up in the big business of African art (to which he devotes his entire column) that he can dismiss the rather more urgent concerns of women from all over the world, including Africa. Eugenia W. Herbert Mount Holyoke College ART OF NORTHEASTERN ZAIRE The American Museum of Natural History is planning a traveling exhibition, to open in 1989, on the arts of the peoples of northeast- ern Zaire. While we will be focusing on the Mangbetu and Azande, we are also interested in objects from the surrounding peoples, in- cluding the Medje, Bangba (Matshaga), Man- gbele, Abarambo, Mamvu, Mayogo, Budu, and Mbuti. The American Museum of Natural History has a very large collection from this area, dat- ing mostly from 1905 to 1915. The exhibition will draw heavily on the Lang-Chapin collec- tion of 1915, which resulted from the mu- seum's Congo Expedition (1909-1915). We are interested in supplementing this material with objects from other collections. Parti- cular areas of concern are anthropomorphic and zoomorphic art, the arts of kingship, and early photographs that document material culture. However, we would like to learn of any pieces from this region, whether in these categories or not. We hope to compile a cur- rent directory of objects that will be of use to researchers. Please send information, and record photographs if possible, to me at the Depart- ment of Anthropology, American Museum of Natural History, New York, NY 10024. Enid Schildkrout books Continued from page 24 when analyzing dress, and the essay closes with a brief discussion of written and visual "information sources," their perspectives and biases, mentioning the structuralist grids applied to the topic by Roland Barthes in Sys- teme de la mode (1967). Overall, the essay is a helpful and well-considered, if under- standably by no means exhaustive, introduc- tion to the complex, fascinating, rich subject at hand. I quibble somewhat with the inclusive or at least the nondifferentiated treatment of mas- querade costuming within dress, not be- cause it is not dress but because the mas- querade provides a major conceptual division between dress that reveals, enhances, and projects an individual's persona and dress that conceals and alters a wearer's identity. This distinction is admittedly blurred in some en- sembles (e.g., a Yoruba oba wearing a beaded veil), but it is no less critical to our under- standing of African values in dress systems. The second essay, by Thieme, is entitled "Resource Materials for the Study of African Dress." It is a selective survey of general ref- erences, government publications, bibliog- raphies, theses, periodicals, HRAF (Human Relations Area Files), films, and museum col- lections. Major examples are given within each of these categories, and most standard sources are cited. It closes with a "User's Guide" to this volume. A potential problem in using any bibliogra- phy, of course, is the assumption that its sub- jects are treated fully. The compilers realize this isn't the case here, but a user might, and one could therefore develop a false sense of security. One easy way to clarify what is and what is not included is to list all periodicals indexed. Sophisticated users will then know where else to look. And in the survey of bibliog- raphies, some of those for modern Ghana are cited, but several others are not, and the coverage of other area or country bibliog- raphies is neither wholly systematic nor com- plete. Most users are unaware of absent cita- tions. One enormous category of omissions, however, is apparent and I believe regretta- ble: sources in languages other than English. Since a bibliography is designed as a research tool, it is difficult to understand why the com- pilers limited their book in this manner, ren- dering it quite inadequate for about half the nations of the continent-Mali, Ivory Coast, Gabon, and Zaire, to mention the most ob- vious, for which most literature is written in French. European scholars not infrequently remark on the linguistic insularity and the consequent limitations of American research. "English-only" bibliographies on important global subjects like dress only perpetuate their justifiable criticism and our untenable provinciality. So, while this bibliography can indeed be useful, its compilers might well want to consider a "volume III" that picks up the thousands of important references on dress in French, German, Portuguese and other languages. Herbert M. Cole University of California, Santa Barbara AFRICAN AESTHETICS The Carlo Monzino Collection Susan Mullin Vogel The Center for African Art, New York, 1986. xvii + 228 pp., 140 blw &amp; 148 color photos, map, bibli- ography, index. $39 paper. African Aesthetics catalogues the collection of Carlo Monzino, whose commitment to the arts began at the early age of 21. In his intro- duction we read of his first acquisitions, in- cluding works by Jackson Pollock and Francis Bacon as well as sculptures from Pre- Columbian, Oceanic, and ancient Mediterra- nean cultures. All these beautiful things, he observed, complemented each other, and there was no need to separate them by area. In other words, each object held its own against fine works of art from other traditions. Monzino lived through the exciting years of collecting African art in the 1950s and 1960s. He looks back on it as an adventure, recalling meeting the widow of the great artist and col- lector Jacob Epstein or spending time with Charles Ratton in search of African pieces. His love for the art and the process of acquiring it comes through in the lively and informal, yet moving, introduction, written in Italian. (I thank Laura Lewis Meyer, Research Assistant to the Director of the Saint Louis Art Mu- seum, for her translation.) In presentation African Aesthetics recalls monumental publications of the 1950s such as African Sculpture by Elisofon and Fagg (1958), to which it is identical in size (11" by 13") and format. As in the earlier publication, the arts are presented by culture from West to East Af- rica, beginning with Dogon art. And again, the photographs, in this case by Mario Car- rieri, are a wonderful strength. The straightforward treatment, without the dra- matic use of light, allows us to study the beauty of the works. Background colors high- light patination and details, which are as- tonishingly clear. Overall the photographic resolution is unchallenged. The layout reads easily, with photos conveniently arranged. Many of the works published in the 1958 book reappear here, including the great Dogon hermaphrodite sculpture (Vogel's no. 6, Fagg's no. 14) and several Fang pieces that belonged to Epstein. Additionally a number of works, for instance the Nomoli figure (no. 23) and the Senufo rhythm pounder (no. 18), are remarkably similar to Fagg's selections (nos. 72-73, 96). It is interesting to compare the two books' presentation of the Fang sculp- ture known as the "Black Venus," formerly in the Epstein collection. Both offer four full- length illustrations of the piece. However, whereas in the older publication all four photographs appear on facing pages, in the current work there are different-scaled photos on four successive pages so that one cannot as easily compare the various views of the sculpture. Further, the cropping of some of the plates is annoying. On the whole, how- ever, African Aesthetics presents a visual feast. As with the introductory essay in the 1958 book, this one, by Vogel, establishes an aesthetic theory that may be applied to the fine selections that follow in the catalogue sec- 78</page></plain_text>
