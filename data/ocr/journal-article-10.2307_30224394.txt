<plain_text><page sequence="1">S. G. Lofts, Ernst Cassirer. A "Repetition" of Modernity (Albany: State University of New York, 2000), XIV + 262 pp. In this slightly revised version of the author's doctoral dissertation, he gives a close and lucid reading of Cassirer's philosophy of symbolic forms against the back- drop of the concerns of twentieth-century continental philosophers. A pleasure to read, the book succeeds as a thoughtful, contemporary introduction to Cassirer's phi- losophy. Despite its many merits, however, this study does not fulfill all of its promise, though the problem in the end probably lies more with Cassirer than with the author. The author regards his study as part of a growing effort, in the face of both the bankruptcy of postmodernity and the paradox of today's "multicultural culture," at a "repetition" of modernity in the spirit of Cassirer. At times moving beyond Cassirer's literal self-understanding but in keeping with Cassirer's own hermeneutical princi- ples, the author attempts to render explicit what has allegedly eluded most commenta- tors: the systematic unity, the hidden "law of the whole," informing Cassirer's account of culture. In the Introduction the author claims that "the antithesis between the de- mand for historical objectivity and the subjectivity of historical recollection" is over- come by the fact that history is part science and part art or, in Cassirer's words, by the fact that history strives after an "objective anthropomorphism" (15f.). The author's justification for this claim seems rather feeble but he makes a good case, on the basis of reasons internal to Cassirer's thought, for interpreting the philosophy of symbolic forms in an insistently holistic fashion. The author also successfully shows how something very much akin to criticisms of modernity informs Cassirer's project. According to theses set forth in Chapter One, Cassirer's conception of symbolic function resolves the crisis over loss of a rational (logocentric) unity by displacing logic from its privileged position; his emphasis on the symbolic mediatedness of reality disestablishes the metaphysics of presence (nonsym- bolic immediacy); and finally, his recognition of the heterogeneity of cultural forms dispels the danger of their absorption into some overarching principle as is found in Hegel. The author acknowledges that, in this first chapter, his claim for the unity yet</page><page sequence="2">660 International Journal of the Classical Tradition / Spring 2003 heterogeneity of cultural forms is merely a promissory note, payable only at the end of the investigation. It would seem, however, that similar caution is warranted for the other two themes of this chapter, especially since the author does not initially entertain any of the traditional reasons for thinking that foundational roles for logic and non- symbolic immediacy might not be so easily dismissed. In the conclusion, as noted below, the author does recognize certain limitations in Cassirer's project, but only with regard to the question of presence or immediacy. In Chapter Two, after locating the original paradigm for the symbolic function in Cassirer's early theory of concept formation in physics and noting the problem of its extension to other symbolic forms, the author elaborates the basic structure of the symbolic function through a highly illuminating comparison with Deleuze's definition of structuralism. The comparison ably demonstrates the author's thesis that the philos- ophy of symbolic forms is "a type of structuralism avant la lettre." The exposition of symbolic function's basic structure is quite valuable, even if a bit too obsequious, and serves as a platform for the remaining chapters which survey specific symbolic forms. There is a chapter on language as, in certain respects, the preeminent symbolic form, differentiating and constructing the objective world; a chapter on the "paradoxical" and "hazardous" philosophy of myth as the expressive fusion of image and meaning; a chapter on religion as the symbolic form that transforms myth and affirms the individ- ual by unveiling and dwelling in an "absurd" opposition of image and meaning or, equivalently, of temporal and eternal existence; a chapter on science as the language- transforming symbolic form of "ideal and pure signification," an explicit and system- atic understanding of the lawful order of nature and mind, transcending context and subjectivity; and, finally, a chapter on art as the emancipatory symbolic form that forms the passageway between expression and signification. Each of these chapters provides an excellent introduction into Cassirer's account of the respective symbolic form, especially in the difficult cases of religion (which he did not always sharply differentiate from myth) and of art (of which he left only a fragmentary account). In the final chapter of the book, the author returns to the issue of the unity amid heterogeneity of the symbolic forms. Their unity, he argues, is functional and the function is a teleological movement towards self-liberation. The self-liberation meant here involves a transition from nature and life to freedom and spirit, the sort of transi- tion anticipated by Hegel and panned by Heidegger. The author accordingly main- tains that, for Cassirer, the unity of symbolic forms constitutes the unity of life and spirit "without, as in the case of Hegel, reducing life to spirit or, as in the case of Bergson, Heidegger, and others, negating the intrinsic value of spirit" (206). At the same time, however, given that the symbolic forms do not exist outside the interplay of life and spirit, formulation of this unity presents a problem. Based upon the later Cassirer's attempt to address this problem in terms of Goethe's conception of Ur- phainomene, the author concludes his study by attempting to show the unity of symbol- ic forms in the interplay of the "basic phenomena" of I, Thou, and it. There are two issues here that the author does not think it necessary to keep separate: the issue of the unity of symbolic forms and the issue of the status of the articulation of that unity. He does a better job with the first issue than with the second as he argues for a dialectic of presence and representation that constitutes the symbolic function, respectively and reciprocally, of the symbolic forms. In the end, however, the author concedes that this dialectic, while deflating any rationalist pretensions to com- plete transparency, implies the ineluctability of presence ("the myth of the given").</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 661 This conclusion would seem to contradict the central thrust of a philosophy of symbol- ic forms (though, to his credit, the author tries to put a positive spin on the dilemma by noting Cassirer's acknowledgment of the positive role played by enigma in the process of thinking). The author's honest admission of this conundrum, moreover, brings us face to face with the other issue, the status of a philosophy of symbolic forms, none of which is formally identified with philosophy. The author concludes his fine study with the singularly dissatisfying line: "It [philosophy] is, in a way, all of these - and yet none of them." Insofar as this conclusion is part of the payment promised in the opening chapter, readers have a right to protest that the author still owes them. This remaining debt aside, the author has, it bears repeating, done a splendid job of elaborating Cassirer's philosophy of symbolic forms and drawing at- tention to its considerable strengths without attempting to conceal decisive shortcom- ings. It is regrettably necessary to add that numerous misspellings and grammatical lapses mar the work. Daniel O. Dahlstrom Department of Philosophy Boston University</page></plain_text>
