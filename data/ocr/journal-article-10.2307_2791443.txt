<plain_text><page sequence="1">RELIGI ON Anthropomorphism and Miracle. By Erland Ehnmark 4 Z (Uppsala Universitets Arsakrift 1939, 12). Uppsala and Leipzig. Pp. vi, 230. In the first part of this very interesting and significant volume the miraculous element in the stories of the gods in Homer is examined with a view to showing in particular the extent to which the divine interference is anthropomorphi- cally conceived. This inquiry leads in the second section to an investigation of the more general question of the importance of anthropomorphism as a religious factor. In Homer when the gods act in a magical way their actions cannot be clearly apprehended as nobody knows exactly what happens to produce the effect. On the other hand, where abstract phenomena are represented in a concrete form it is easier to understand how the wonders were performed, as, for example, when Apollo hid Hector in a thick cloud after having carried him away from Achilles (II. 20. 444). While this concrete character of the description is due ultimately to the inability of the primitive mind to conceive of abstract ideas except in concrete shape, in the epic narrative the primitive view of the phenomena has developed as a poetical device which often appears to take over a metaphorical guise. Thus, Homer puts his own interpretation on the behaviour of his characters, but this, it is contended, cannot be regarded as a rationalistic explanation since ' Homer does not attempt to ' explain but to describe the divine miracles.' He is essen- tially a literary artist and he employs the current stories as instruments of his poetic genius. The ' divine apparatus,' however, is not merely a poetical art-device. ' The gods inter- ' vene because they are the real causes of the events of life; ' their intervention can consequently not be lacking.' The assurance that there are gods who act was never for a moment doubted by the Greeks. Therefore, they find a natural place in the epic narrative as an integral element in the ordinary course of human affairs. In relating this Homeric conception of the miracle to ' anthropomorphism and the natural explanation in the ' myth,' in the second part of the volume, Dr. Ehnmark reviews a quantity of material to illustrate supernatural beings acting in very human and naturalistic ways, devoid equally of omnipotence, omniscience and ethical qualities. He then proceeds to a discussion of the part played by fantasy, [ 69 ]</page><page sequence="2">Nos. 4647] MAN [May-June, 1945 with or without real connexion with the true belief of men in these anthropomorphisms. He is able to show that accepted beliefs have been regarded as true even when the myths are manifestly self-contradictory, as for instance in the case of creation stories in which the creation of the world is described when it is also alleged to have already existed, or when seals are said to have been caught before there were any such creatures in the sea. The primitive mind does not require ' these supernatural things to make sense.' It is content ' not ' to understand.' This leads to a consideration of the function of myth. It cannot be denied, in Dr. Ehnmark's opinion, that its primary purpose often is the giving of sanction, and lending sacred- ness to a form of existence, to a social order, to a religious custom, or to the existing reality as such. On the other hand, it seems equally clear to him that the myth also is atiological inasmuch as certain myths have scarcely any other function than that of explaining phenomena although in these instances it has to be remembered that the explanation usually repre- sents an attempt to account for the present in terms of a primeval reality. It stands, he thinks, between science and poetry. The natural and the supernatural elements are so blended that a clear, graphic imagery of the occurrence described is combined with a naive fantasy. 'That which ' separates the mythic explanation from the scientific, unites ' myth and poetry. Once more the visualization and the ' concrete conception, the epic trait, are seen to be decisive ' factors; only when this is taken into account does it become ' comprehensible that the myth can contain so many contra- ' dictions, and still be believed; that different interpretations ' of the same phenomenon are tolerated side by side.'
