<plain_text><page sequence="1">Theocentric Ethics and Policy P. Travis Kroeker When I was in my early twenties finishing my MA thesis on Karl Rahner's concept of revelation, I remember experiencing a strong desire to move out of the rarified atmosphere of European transcendental Thomism and to find a more concrete focus for my intellectual eros—something more practical and politi cally relevant. At that time I was considering doctoral programs and I was directed to the University of Chicago, and I began to read some of the books of the Chicago faculty. It was then that I first came across James Gustafson's Ethics from a Theocentric Perspective. Beside it in the bookstore was Christ and the Moral Life with its striking cover, familiar to most of you, a dramatic scene depicting Jesus, whip in hand, cleansing the temple. And I remember thinking, yes that's more like it—not an abstract transcendental Christology but the active Jesus who challenges religious and political leaders and their conventional traditions, institutions, and practices. I went to Chicago. I was soon to discover that the cover scene was really a depiction of Gustafson's seminar on theological ethics, with him wielding the whip of dialectic, challenging the traditional assumptions and idolatries not only of his students but of the wider culture—overturning tables of tradition, challenging conventional authorities and orthodoxies, devoted to the purgation of the "eth ics" courtyard and refusing to allow scholars to proceed in a "business as usual" manner. I will now leave behind this image in order to refine some of its central features with reference to my topic, theocentric ethics and policy. I should say at the outset that, despite the title, I will really not say very much about policy but focus more on politics (indeed my paper could be subtitled "piety, paideia, and political theory"). Also, we were asked to relate Gustafson's contributions to the "shape of the field today and in the future." I plan however to relate his contributions to Plato and Augustine, and I hope it will become clear why I have chosen this approach.</page><page sequence="2">20 The Annual of the Society of Christian Ethics I have said that Gustafson practices dialectic, and I readily recognise with many others that his work as a dialectical thinker has made a very important contribution to the field of theological ethics. No one has done more in our guild to show the importance of the interrelationships of various types and levels of rhetoric, analysis, and method in theological ethics. His dialectical work has enabled us to make distinctions that clarify our craft, and it has enabled us to communicate more effectively not only with one another but also with various audiences beyond the professional guild of Christian ethicists: other disciplines within the university, churches, and policy makers in various institutional contexts. Gustafson's dialectic pushes us to reflect critically on the criteria, ends, and principles by which we arrive at our judgments, whether theological or ethical. Such reflection is of crucial importance for the attempt to develop a political ethics. Like Socrates in Plato's Gorgias, Gustafson focuses on the need for ethicists to give an account of their techne and its power. This is especially needed in a political culture in which morality or ethics is often understood to be a matter of private opinion, the power of which is tied to the rhetorical ability to persuade others to hold certain opinions about what is just or good. For Gustafson as for Plato, moral instruction must be related to knowledge based on an understanding of the real nature of the object of one's art. This knowledge, furthermore, is not just a question of information or method but of character—it entails not only the responsibility to be able to explain one's method or procedure but also the commitment to serving the good of its object: that is, to be good or just and the sort of person who seeks a true understanding of this in order to act on it. Moreover, for Gustafson, as for Plato, this practice of dialectic or moral philosophy is finally a religious matter—in order to be practiced properly its knowledge will have to be theological and its character entail piety. Why is that? Because the good is not a human possession, nor is it to be identified with any particular or partial good. The good is the good of the whole, not simply understood as a collection of all parts or all beings, but, as Socrates states in the Republic (509b), the "good beyond being, exceeding it in dignity and power," the transcendent power toward which human beings must be oriented if they are to know the good ordering of the parts that make up the whole, including themselves. This knowledge is therefore a knowledge of what is good not only for oneself or for "one's own" in some narrowly defined community. It is a knowledge of the common good shared in an ordering of nature in which each part serves and shares in the good of the whole. Like Plato, Gustafson is a religious realist.1 1 See, for example, Robert Lowry Calhoun, "Plato as Religious Realist," in Religious Realism, ed.</page><page sequence="3">Theocentric Ethics and Policy 21 So of central importance for Gustafson's approach to theocentric ethics and policy is what he calls discernment,2 and what has also been called judgment or prudence. The perilous responsibility of human discernment or judgment, whether in social policy and politics or in education or pastoral care, is to offer moral direction in a manner that addresses particular problems in all of their contextual complexity; it does so by relating them to a more general interpreta tion of what God is enabling and requiring us, as rational moral participants in the life of the world, to be and to do (2: 146). Human beings exercise such discernment not as the proprietors of the world but as stewards, responsible contributors to the realms in which they participate. And they are responsible in their action and interaction not only to other human beings but also to all other creatures and things, and ultimately to the whole order of reality which exists not only for human beings but for God and God's purposes. Theocentric moral discernment therefore is not a matter of an original will seeking its own interests through an instrumental calculus of how best to negotiate and realize those interests in nature and society. It is rather an act of piety toward God by thinking, feeling, willing selves who, in communication with other selves, seek to order their lives—their desires and interests, relations and ends—with reference to the cosmic whole and what it requires. In terms of politics, then, it seems to me that an important implication of Gustafson's theocentric ethics is a radical critique of conventional modern politics. It entails a critique not only of widespread political rhetoric that invites people to make judgments and choices based on narrow private or sectional interests and goods, nor only of a politics of national self-interest that makes a particular socio-political community the center of value. In my view it entails an even more radical critique—"radical" because it is a critique of a central principium of modern political authority and interpretation, namely, contrac tarian politics and theories of justice. In contrast to a theory of justice as positive right that originates in an agreement among human wills who decide upon the legal and social conventions by which they shall be governed, Gustafson's model of discernment implies a theory of natural right that is not principally constructed by human beings but rather that is present in the order of nature, in the cosmic whole the good of which is measured by God alone. There is present in our experience, then, a moral and spiritually intelligible cosmos that can be discerned by pious, humble, critically thinking human beings. D.C.

Subsequent references to this work will be cited in brackets by volume and page number.</page><page sequence="4">22 The Annual of the Society of Christian Ethics However, while Gustafson argues for an objective natural grounding for moral experience and reason, his understanding of discernment and natural right is not the same as that of Plato or of Augustine. I want to offer some dialectical reflections on the similarities and differences between Gustafson and these pre-modern proponents of theocentric ethics and a classical theory of natural right. These remarks, given our constraints, will have to be suggestive and allusive. I offer them as a way of considering that whatever shapes the field of ethics today must be judged also in relation to these dialectical masters of theocentric ethics. I begin by noting that Gustafson, as does Augustine in De Trinitate xiv and in De Civitate Dei x, relates his theocentric model of discernment to Romans 12:1-2(1:327f.) A theocentric discernment that frees human thought and agency from conformity to anthropocentric conventions that contract our vision of the good is related to a "renewal of the mind" that enlarges our judgment so as to better discern the proper ordering of parts in relation to the cosmic whole. For both Gustafson and Augustine, this renewal is a matter of human orientation to God as the measure of the good. It bears noting also that Augustine cites not only Romans 12:1-2 but also Romans 11:33—God's judgments are inscrutable, God's ways are untraceable.3 "Who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been God's counsellor?" The discernment reflected in the judgment of human beings is not to be equated with the divine measure, which is as distant from us as the infinite is from the finite, the eternal from the temporal, the perfect or completed whole is from incomplete parts. Yet human judgment with regard to worldly things, institutions, and relations is necessary, despite being riddled with perils and especially with unavoidable ignorance—as is so memorably ex pressed in Augustine's discussion of the human judge in Book xix of the City of God. Radical humility is required therefore of human beings in their discern ment; in judging in dependence upon the divine measure one "walks by faith and not by sight." Human beings must recognise the partiality of their vision and their radical dependence upon divine direction and divine assistance.4 There are many points of convergence between Gustafson's and Augustine's positions. I wish, however, to note two important respects in which Gustafson's model of discernment diverges from Augustine's. The first is that Gustafson not only rules out a timeless, changeless human interpretation of divine wisdom and moral order, but also the very existence of such an eternal moral order (1:339). By so doing, of course, he clearly diverges not only from Augustine but also Cf. City of God xx, 2f. 4 City of God xix, 14.</page><page sequence="5">Theocentric Ethics and Policy 23 from Plato. The second point of divergence is that Gustafson rejects the biblical and Augustinian understanding of personal divine agency, both in ordering the good and in assisting our discernment of and participation in that moral order. Let us examine these points of divergence more closely. By ruling out the existence of an eternal moral order, Gustafson effectively eliminates the classical notion of natural right and a political theory which is connected with a teleological cosmology—that is, the view that natural beings have a natural end or destiny which determines what is good for them within the context of the whole and also how they are to pursue that good. Gustafson calls into question such a teleological religious naturalism in deference to the modern natural sciences which are utterly agnostic about such ends. This does not mean that he rejects the view that there is a reliable spiritual and moral ordering of life that can be discerned by human beings. However, I do not see how one can have it both ways—a fundamentally reliable and yet changeable ordering. As can easily be shown, both Augustine and Plato welcome a dialectical self-criticism that refuses to identify the divine good with human traditions that express that good; they are not historicists or traditionalists. Neither would they deny that the structure of moral and spiritual existence is dynamic—indeed it is so by nature, hence the need for dialectic. What they want to insist upon, however, is that God (or, in Plato's case perhaps, the divine Good) is in a position to judge and measure that dynamism and to order it toward its proper place and end within the cosmic whole. And they further claim that human discernment participates in this divine judgment insofar as it gains insight into the truth of that ordering, thereby relating its own partial existence to the constant, trustworthy require ments of the whole. Such participation is able to specify the habits and criteria of good judgment, to give criteria rooted in knowledge of the virtues evident in the well-ordered, pious soul. Only thus could theological ethics be considered a science of moral order rather than merely the collection and clarification of conflicting moral opinions or values. Why is this a crucial issue? Contractarian theory sees ends as necessary for human agency and interaction; human agency is intentional, always motivated by the desire to achieve certain ends. Human action and interaction is therefore teleological by definition, and the moral question concerns which ends are good or just and which are not. The contractarian approach, however, embodies the dualism in modern political theory between the nonteleological natural sciences and the teleological human sciences which interpret values as human construc tions. Can one recover some sense of natural right or objective political common good without resolving this tension? Are the laws of social justice related to the divine measure of the good, or are they humanly constructed conventions rooted in the arbitrary, partial preferences of human wills who say "this is my good"? Here we are brought up against the difficult business of representation or what Gustafson calls "construal," the symbolic language by which we are</page><page sequence="6">24 The Annual of the Society of Christian Ethics oriented in the world. The way we represent the world, the way we envision it, will make all the difference in how we respond to and participate in it. There is here an important point to be made about discernment. Whereas Plato and Augustine ground discernment in a dramatic spiritual cosmos which is ordered by a transcendent and eternal power, in contrast to the changeable temporal partiality of human life, Gustafson's God is not so understood, nor is our participation in that ordering power in the act of judgment so understood. I might add that this is why both Plato's and Augustine's accounts of discernment include representations of final judgment which depict the human soul's ac countability before an eternal divine measure. These accounts of post-mortem or eschatological judgment are not presented as gratuitous mythical window dressing trotted out for their utility in eliciting political, moral or religious conformity (though they have been so abused).5 Rather they are philosophically and dialectically required to make sense of a natural human experience, the experience of moral agency and moral judgment in relation to a transcendent divine measure. They are required in order to give a logos of the ousia of an objective moral order and the act of discerning it by human beings. Human beings have a nature and a purpose which they did not give themselves; their order must be discerned if they are to participate fittingly in the whole. I wonder whether Gustafson's model of discernment does not here become less than fully dialectical and theocentric in orientation, when partial human knowledge and construals of external natural processes or physical causality become a decisive measure for what can be claimed about God and God's relation to the world and to human beings in particular? This brings us to the second point—Gustafson's rejection of the biblical and Augustinian Christian understanding of God in terms of personal agency. I used to think that Gustafson's rejection of personal agency language for God was based entirely on his acceptance of a modern nonteleological scientific natural ism—that the ultimate ordering of the cosmos is best represented as an imper sonal field of spatio-temporal processes, forces, and relations. And I continue to think that this acceptance has crucial theological implications. Gustafson has, I think, accepted the modern restriction of personality and will to human beings and human agency, a restriction which as we know has resulted in the tremen dous aggrandizement of human will and human action into nature in the modern project. Thus while nature is emptied of divine will and personal agency, human beings increasingly become the active constructors of meaning and values in a 5 I take it that Gustafson's rejection of the doctrine of immortality is theologically directed toward such abuses (cf. l:17f., 182f.), although it is also based on evidence taken from the physical and biological sciences.</page><page sequence="7">Theocentric Ethics and Policy 25 disenchanted world that furnishes the resources for the fulfilment of their willed desires. Ironically all of this becomes part of the very anthropocentrism that Gustaf son opposes! So it occurred to me on this, my most recent re-reading of Ethics from a Theocentric Perspective, that Gustafson's rejection of personal agency language for the divine may be in no small way a critical reaction against the idolization of human will and agency in modern society and politics, in which nature is seen simply as raw material for the gratification of immediate human interests and desires. Here too, as I read him, Gustafson is arguing against the contractarian myth which asserts that society and political order is constructed ex nihilo from the pre-social, detached, contextless (and therefore naturally and socially unintelligible) will of individuals. Hence he will not agree with liberal ism's moral privileging of contract-based, as contrasted with natural, commu nities or construals of the "common good." Gustafson adheres to a different view of human freedom and moral agency—not as self-actualization ex nihilo but as service to a larger good given in nature. Gustafson's claim that this modern idolization of human will and agency to some extent finds its authorization in Christian doctrines and symbols is true. In particular the doctrine of imago dei allows not only for a distorted divinization of human power but also for a distorted anthropomorphism and anthropocen trism in theology. But the doctrine of imago dei also accounts for these distortions by relating them to a larger ordering in which one can discern proper and improper agency. Indeed this is why Augustine introduces language of divine agency as the central interpretive principium of political ethics in City of God: one must understand human agency, not in terms of stories of human beings or the gods and other narrative accounts (which must themselves be measured by a larger good), but in relation to God who has created the human power to act and therefore alone can measure it.6 That is, the enlargement required by the Augustinian model of discernment is not simply a matter of extending immanent contexts of interaction, whether historical or natural. Time and space lack ultimacy; they are creations of God who measures them. The scope of the whole cannot be limited to the measures of time and space. Politically, indeed, that would mean conceding success to the largest empires. The enlargement required in human discernment and good judgment, on Augustine's view, is the relation of all created reality to the Creator who made it and orders its true meaning. That is, the world is intelligible ultimately only as God's creative act, and this requires us to be ordered in attunement with that 6 In this connection, cf. Gustafson's claim that one learns more about human agency from great novels than from philosophical or scientific accounts of the subject ( 1:291 ).</page><page sequence="8">26 The Annual of the Society of Christian Ethics act and its meaning. One cannot develop an adequate interpretation of human nature and moral agency without this. God is the measure of all that is, and this must include moral principles of human agency. However, for Augustine this measure is not intelligible through nature in the same way that it is for the Platonists who claim to have access to it through the direct mediation of the soul and the exercise of dialectic. Human sin has vitiated the process of discernment in time and space so that human beings lack the purity of heart and mind necessary to discern the good. Their purification can no longer be achieved by themselves; it requires a divine act in time and space to restore the possibility. It requires no less than a reformation of deformed human nature by sending the eternal form of divine wisdom itself in the temporal form humanly required to discern it, namely that of a humble servant. History therefore plays a role in Augustine that it does not in Plato's model of discernment, but history is not defined solely in terms of human agency (cf. Gustafson, 1:211). The dramatic text finally that must be read in order for human beings to have their discernment enlarged is the text of God's providential trinitarian action into the creation, ultimately by sending the eternal logos into time and space in order to make that enlarged vision both possible and effective. And it is an enlargement that moves all things to their end. Necessary to this vision of life is both eternal good (teleology) and process (temporal change and "becoming"). But the historical and natural development does not render the eternal end transparent, neither through the mediation of secular politics nor through the church. From the immediacy of household relations that entail assorted ills, distresses, and painful necessities; to the political judgments of lawmakers and policy makers in the civic realm whose knowledge, vision and therefore judgments remain imperfect and flawed; to the debilitating and dis couraging barriers to communication and peaceful coexistence that exist in international, cross-cultural relations and that often lead to war (to say nothing of the human interrelations with the non-human realm)—our judgments remain uncertain, partial, and flawed (City of God xix). Tragedy is not overcome in this life. Here of course we are back again at a very Gustafsonian vision of things, but without an ordering vision or pattern of the heavenly city, either in Plato's or in Augustine's sense. I have only been able to suggest that this makes a difference for the attempt to do political ethics, and my own work has been devoted to a dialectical rethinking of modern politics in the light of these theocentric per spectives. But if I have been able to do that with any measure of insight, this is due in no small measure to the pedagogical model provided by Gustafson. His model of discernment forces those of us who see Christian theological ethics as a science to place Christian symbols into ongoing critical dialogue with alterna tive symbolizations of the nature of reality, and to give reasons for the crucial choices we make. In his person and in his work Gustafson both challenges us</page><page sequence="9">Theocentric Ethics and Policy 27 with his rigorous vision of the task and educates us as to how it might be carried out. And here I might permit myself a final personal comment. There are those who have called Gustafson's theological ethics "austere" and "cold" or "harsh"—I myself have never understood this. From the beginning it was his complete personal engagement, his "reason irradiated by affection" and his "affection irradiated by reason," the deeply evident integrity of mind and heart that made him such an effective and memorable teacher and mentor. He taught his students to think critically but not eristically, piously but not sentimentally. A colleague of mine who attended Yale many years ago tells me that H. Richard Niebuhr used to keep his pipe tobacco in a tin displaying the brand name "Revelation." I do not suppose James Gustafson smoked that brand, but he might have smoked a brand called "Dialectic." Such a brand name, emphasizing the search for true knowledge about the things that are, is indeed central to Gustaf son's approach, and to the techne of theological ethics now and in the future.</page></plain_text>
