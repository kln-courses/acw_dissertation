<plain_text><page sequence="1">International Music Council Internationaler Musikrat /Conseil International de la Musique Barry S. Brook and David Bain Music in the Life of Man: Theoretical and Practical Foundations for a World History* I The 1 9th-century philosopher of science Charles Sanders Peirce once offered that "thought is what it Is, only by virtue of its addressing a future thought."1 It will serve our purpose to spend a moment with that statement, rooted as it is in one of the more sophisticated conceptions of joint human inquiry to come from a philosopher. For a world history of music, as individually daunting as it may seem, is very much a matter of joint human inquiry and subject to its laws, what- ever they may be. Peirce's formulation can be brought a lot closer to home with a simple sub- stitution of terms. Try this one: Labor on a set of volumes is what It is only by vir- tue of its addressing a future set of volumes. That proposition is both grand and humbling in Its implications, and we will return to it before we conclude. An even simpler substitution yields this result: Labor on a set of volumes is what it is, only by virtue of its addressing a future thought. Here we come round to the heart of what a daunting project such as our Music in the Life of Man can and should mean: mean within what Peirce would call variously "the community of scien- tists" or "the community of philosophers" (and for which, in Peirce's language, we may read the "unlimited" community of "disciplined and candid minds" - our projected audience). So, let's first describe the labor in question and then maybe we can, hypothe- tical^ of course, catch It in the act of addressing a future thought. MLM will enlist scholars from all over the world and from many disciplines in a vast coordinated effort. It will serve as a focus for both International and reg- * The international office of the project is: Music in the Life of Man: A World History, International Music Council, UNESCO, 1 , rue Miollis, 75732 Paris CEDEX 15, France. 120</page><page sequence="2">ional cooperation in the coordination of existing knowledge and the fostering of new research. The participating scholars themselves are the MLM project's chief strength and promise thus far: not only for the quality of their reputations but, just as critical in this case, for the variety of their backgrounds. Scholars (and, in some cases, networks of scholars) will be contributing music-historical and music-sociocontextual accounts of their respective corners of the world, each resulting volume organized along agreed upon guidelines. An inexpensively published forum for "works in progress" will afford the necessary mutual expo- sure to, and interaction between, hypotheses and working categories: as will the continuing series of international meetings, now being organized along regional lines, and the establishment of cross-regional projects, such as a central system for locating collections of traditional musics in existing archives and central files providing access to organologica! and lexicographical data. Framing the work of the regional coordinators, in both a temporal and a conceptual sense, will be the first and last bound publications of the series: a ground-laying volume of essays devoted to axiomatic questions; and a final, synoptic volume in which linkages, commonalities, and possible universais are proposed, and related hypotheses for future investigations presented. The ten regional volumes will be something quite different from simple collec- tions of chapters on individual countries. Even in those cases where current states are the nominal topics, what will have been addressed is a developing model of vast musical cultures, enormously complicated both in their structures and their origins, and themselves the source of influences spilling over politically determined frontiers and even extending into other geocultural regions. The "altitude" of perspective required for such a task prompts a return to Peirce's vertiginous conception of a thinker addressing an intangible that has yet to exist. Recapturing our leading quotation in its original context, we may be given some philosophical footing on the little-travelled paths we have chosen: "... so a thought is what it is, only by virtue of its addressing a future thought which is in its value as thought identical with it, though more developed." Put another way, the fortuitous presence of lacunae at a particular moment is in itself no commen- tary on the worth or timeliness of an enterprise. As a penetrating observer of scientific life as well as a trained scientist and mathematician himself, and as one of the first to resurrect and put to modern uses the mental experiments of the Middle Ages, Peirce was keenly aware that the precariousness of the serious inquirer's position is not some troublesome exception to a rule to be smoothed over or waited out. Rather, that precarious- ness is something built into the reality of all rigorous inquiry, from the framing and 121</page><page sequence="3">testing of hypotheses in physical experiment to the shaping of explanatory mod- els to account for patterns of social and historical fact. Under the name, "falli- bilism". Peirce made this insight a cornerstone of his entire approach. So, if we are to believe Peirce, no perfectly opportune moment for the inaugu- ration of these volumes awaits us, no research-ripened stage when all the relev- ant data will have been collected and interested parties need only compile it. The very issue of relevance is conditioned by the precarious act of question-ask- ing on scales large and small. And the value of our "radical experiment" can never be judged beforehand, except to say that it can only truly fail by not being launched. In what specific ways, then, can we succeed? Well, to quote Peirce twice more, we may be granted provisional success - the only kind available in pro- jects not limited to practical and predetermined ends - should the volumes 1) "push inquiry" and 2) "not block the way of inquiry". The virtual ensuranceof the first is not difficult to demonstrate; that inquiry has been "pushed" may in fact be one of the main charges lodged against our necessarily hubric and necessarily fallible work. Still, as the following sections will show, a world-wide apparatus, which did not previously exist, is moving into place; its sole object being to bring people of learning together to plan, write, mutually inform, edit, and jointly publish on a subject that, by its nature embraces every level and aspect of human life. As to Peirce's second criterion - that we not "block" inquiry -that is a far more delicate matter. First, the outcome is practically untestable, resting almost entirely on conjectures of what could have been. Second, and more important, it takes more than energy and good will to prevent such a thing from occurring. While a redoubling of efforts could always multiply the number of studies, push them to a satisfactory conclusion, and see to the dissemination of their results, that same forcefulness, if grossly misguided, if too married to unities not yet jus- tified by available knowledge, could do subtle and incalculable harm to sub- sequent generations. Or, on a more overt level, it could frighten a reactive and influential group away from similar adventures, much to their own, and everyone else's, impoverishment. The solution, as we have seen, is not to shy away from the commission of error to such an extent that nothing is said. Rather, it is to do what musicians ought to do when presented with unfamiliar levels and kinds of complexity: be patient; lis- ten openly and carefully; remain fluid. Our time-table and the nature of the edito- rial process allows for this, leaving a span of some eight years between the initial plunge into methodological questions with the first volume and our version of 122</page><page sequence="4">"addressing a future set of volumes" with the twelfth. The editorial guidelines are sufficiently flexible in their boundaries so that the unanticipated will not be forced into molds foreign to its nature, but they are also sufficiently the product of examined assumptions to provide guidance where it is needed and wanted. For instance, the question of musical universais has only recently been raised again and the settlement of opinion is nowhere at hand.2 To have structured one theory or another into the guidelines would have been a grave error. But estab- lished, human univerals - speech, song, extended education and training, the making of tools and their investiture with meaning and value - these are not merely particulars whose claim to universality is that they represent the lowest common denominator. They are full-fledged mysteries, inexhaustible and inter- penetrating, and all musics partake of them in some important and revealing way. They therefore have a place as categories in the guidelines for those who wish to engage with them. II History and Organization of the Project Early History The genesis of the Music in the Life of Man project was a suggestion made by the late Professor Zofia Lissa to the International Music Council General Assem- bly in Moscow in 1 971 that the IMC sponsor a History of the World's Music. She called for a "reconstruction of our axiomatical system into one which would embrace all the musical phenomena, and not be confined (as was the practice in the past) to research in the musical material and cultural values of one part of one continent: the Occident". Although accepted as an IMC activity, the idea remained dormant until UNESCO included it in its cultural program in 1979. A series of exploratory meetings followed (Paris, October 1 979; Berlin, September 1980; SÃ£o Paolo, November 1980). The intention of these meetings was to examine a variety of approaches for such a projected history. The constructive results of these meetings may be seen in the series of preliminary studies pub- lished in The World of MusicXXJ3, 1980, under the title, "Toward a World History of Music".3 A comparison of the first printed account of the project (The World of Music, ibid. p. 56-57) with the present article will provide an interesting insight into how the thinking, the dimensions, and the shape of the project have evolved. 123</page><page sequence="5">A subsequent meeting in Bayreuth (September 1981), was devoted to ham- mering out a means for the practical implementation of MLM (originally entitled Music as a Language of Man: A World History). The "feasibility study",4 prepared following the Bayreuth meeting, dealt with practical questions of structure, time- table, and personnel and presented the first draft of the Editorial Guidelines (see revised version, section III below). The feasibility study was accepted with favour by UNESCO. In early 1982, Music in the Life of Man was formally launched as a UNESCO-sponsored project to be administered through the International Music Council. Operating Structure At two subsequent meetings (Strasbourg, September 1982 and Stockholm, September 1983), a president and Board of Directors representing six major international organizations as well as a general coordinator were designated. The board then appointed regional coordinators for the seven principal regions and a number of special consultants (NB: several sub-regional coordinators and consultants including archaeologists, anthropologists, sociologists, historians, etc. are still to be named). The full operating structure was established as follows: Board of Directors BarryS.

II to IX) devoted to the seven cultural regions, framed by two volumes (Nos. I and XII) containing essays of supra-regional concern, asfollows: I. Methodological volume: introductory essays on such topics as theories on origins of music biological considerations musical archaeology musical systems sound producers paleography and systems of notation common processes, for example: acculturation, synchronism, syncretism, etc. 20th-century tools for musical analysis historiography, Intellectual history, relations to other disciplines II, III, IV.

Synoptic Volume: essays addressing commonalities, universais, hypoth- eses for future research; general conclusions; cross-cultural chronologies, glossary, indexes, concordances. Country Profiles: Since MLM is designed to deal with broad themes covering entire regions or sub-regions, each modern nation will be represented at the end of the appropriate regional volume by a "country profile" containing the basic facts of its national life, its culture, and its music, as well as a chronology of its 126</page><page sequence="8">history (e.g. demographic, religious, racial, and political composition; major cul- tural and musical institutions; educational resources, instruments, genres, etc.) New Research: The Guidelines state that where our present knowledge is insufficient, new research shall be undertaken (e.g. for Oceania). UNESCO Par- ticipation Program funds, as well as private foundation subventions, are being sought for such purposes. Publication: MLM is aimed at the intelligent layman as well as the specialist - Peirce's "community of disciplined and candid minds." On the basis of already evinced publisher interest, it is expected to appear initially in three editions - English, French, and German. Eventually, it is hoped, MLM will also appear in several other world languages: as well as in two-volume, individually organized condensations, to be made available in as many other tongues as possible. Ill Editorial Guidelines (Revised October 1 983) The Music in the Life of Man is intended to provide a comprehensive history of the musical cultures of the world based on our present knowledge and, where such knowledge is insufficient, on new research. It will provide descriptions of the present state of music and musical practice in the main geocultural regions of the world as well as their historical development, taking into account the par- ticular philosophies or concepts of history of each region, the factors that influ- enced historical development, interaction between cultures, and the musical linkages between cultures within a region as well as those that link the main re- gions. The methodology will be analytical, descriptive, and to a large extent com- parative since the aim must be to present broad pictures of culture areas as a whole in terms of their current usages and history rather than detailed studies of the music and history of individual societies. The purpose of these guidelines is to draw attention to some of the important topics that need to be considered by individual contributors. Each contributor will have to interpret the guidelines in terms of the specific problems and prac- tices of his area and to include other materials relevant to his area not mentioned 127</page><page sequence="9">here. The Guidelines as a whole will be refined and expanded during the early stages of Phase Two, the better to assist authors of individual segments. The Guidelines are presented in three parts as follows: Part One. The Synchronic Perspective: music in our time Part Two. The Historical Perspective: successions and evolutions Part Three. Conclusions Special instructions and models will be provided for: Bibliographies and footnotes Iconography-color, black and white Discography Charts, maps, drawings Separate treatment for major types of instruments Separate treatment of terms needing definition Country profiles PART ONE The Synchronic Perspective: Music in our Time I. Social, Cultural, and Historical Background 1.1 . The geographical, social, cultural, and general historical background of the culture area should be provided as an introduction to the main study. It should include geographical location and extent of area, countries, demographic com- position (ethnic groups where appropriate), languages and linguistic groups, impact of social, political, religious, and economic institutions (where approp- riate) on musical life. 1.2. Where a particular philosophy, cosmogony, or world view is important for understanding the organization and use of music in the culture area, or where it is necessary to deal with special attitudes to music, or the role of music in the cul- tures of the area, this can be discussed here. Music, and the act of music mak- ing, may have cosmological connotations or ideological ramifications that will require elaboration under one or more major category-headings in the study. II. Musical Life 11.1 . The study should deal with all genres or "idioms" of music in the area, the institutional influence upon music, as well as the problem of patronage where relevant. 128</page><page sequence="10">11.2. As far as possible note should be taken of the categories and terminology recognized in the culture area for each genre. Further classification of musical types on the basis of function of social categories and the events or institutions to which they are linked may be attempted to facilitate cross-cultural compari- sion. General categories such as court music, ritual music, ceremonial music, etc., should be set up where appropriate. 11.3. The absorption of musical knowledge outside of the cultural institutions developed for that purpose (be they households, attachments to master musi- cians, conservatories) can be considered here as well. Where a culture area makes distinctions between levels of musical activity or between the activities of "specialists" (that is musicians who may not necessarily be professional but re- cognized in society on the basis of achievement) and others, or where an area re- cognizes different categories of musicians, attention should be drawn to this so that its historical development can be discussed at a later stage. 11.4. The systems of training and methods of "recruitment" of musicians in the culture area should be considered. In some cultures these operate through households, attachment to master musicians, or special institutions. 11.5. The extent to which individual authorship of a work, or body of works, is recognized and deemed important may be significant basis for comparison in a later stage of the study: similarly, the recognition of "schools" and lines of influ- ence. III. Musical Systems Where appropriate detailed description of the musical "language" or languages: 111.1 . Sound sources (vocal and instrumental) of the culture area can be viewed as both technological or technical products and symbolic objects/processes resonant with meaning. (For instance, a Tibetan lama and an Italian tenor developing their respective techniques will conceive of the human voice and its boundaries in far different terms). 111.2. Accordance of a gender to an instrument (based on shape, timbre, social function), cosmological role (based on material source, elemental or mythical association), or general anthropomorphic characteristics (based on performer's attitude of identification of reverence) may come into play here. 111.3. Multi-Part Relationships (including harmony, polyphony, polyrhythm, heterophony, etc.). 129</page><page sequence="11">III.4. Review of specific characteristics of the musical system-scales, tuning systems, modes, rhythm, forms, harmony, etc. The same considerations raised in III.2, above, may apply. (Witness the ancient Western identification of the physical generated harmonic series with the masculine element and the theo- retically generated "sub-harmonic" series with the feminine). IV. Performance Traditions IV. 1 . This section should consider: the various performance traditions of per- formance organisations generally emphasised in the culture area - solo tradi- tions, group or ensemble traditions. IV.2. Special consideration should be given to concepts of performance and modes of presentation in the culture area. Use of space and distancing/binding procedures going on between active musicians and audience or other partici- pants may be of special relevance here. Body motion in performance, the phys- ical "languages" complementing the aural in the act of music making may require attention. IV.3. Improvisation should be given full treatment here in cultures where this is emphasized. Some suggested categories are listed below: IV. 2a Improvisation as agonistics IV. 2b Improvisation as embroidery IV. 2c Improvisation as embodiment of creative principle IV. 2d Improvisation as exploration of musical space. IV.4. Song occupies a special position between speech and instrumental music (without being a hybrid of the two; the historical primacy of speech over song cannot be established). V. Music, Related Arts and Communication This section should be devoted to studies of the interrelations of: V. 1 . Music and Dance V.2. Music and Drama (the Music Theatre where appropriate) V.3. Music and Visual Arts V.4. Music and Language (including where appropriate studies of melody and tone, stress patterns and rhythm). V.6. Music and Ritual - Ceremony (in some culture areas music and religion may be given separate treatment). V.6. Music and Therapy 130</page><page sequence="12">PART TWO The Historical Perspective: sucessions and evolutions The main body of the study should be devoted to this part where the materials of the culture area allow for the history to be dealt with in depth taking into account culture specific concepts of historical time. The aspects to be discussed and the chronology to be adopted should be determined by the contributor in relation to the historical materials of the culture area. The aspects listed in Part I can generally also be discussed in historical terms. All available sources of historical evidence, including documentary sources, archaeological and linguistic evidence and oral traditions (or "oral histories" i.e. interviews with musicians, etc.) where appropriate, should be used in order to give as complete a picture of the music history of the area as possible. For convenience of reference the topics can be combined under the following headings, although they could be integrated in the final presentation if approp- riate to the nature of the materials from the culture area. Aspects under each heading should be expanded to fit the characteristics of the area. VI. Social History VI. 1 . The musical results of interaction with other areas through trade, religion, political conflicts. This could be presented in relation to different historical epochs. VI.2. Development of musical life and musical institutions, patronage, etc. VI.3. Change in performance organisation, etc. arising from social factors. VII. Stylistic History VI 1 . 1 . Theory and practice VII.2. Systems of notation VII.3. Sound sources VII.4. History of "forms" (where applicable) VII.5. History of specific genres. 131</page><page sequence="13">VIII. Contemporary Developments in Music VIII.1 . Current creative developments VI 1 1. 2. Performance VIII.3. Education and research VIII.4. Institutions and organizations VIII.5. Role of the media PART THREE Conclusions IX. Linkages, Comparisons, Summation X. Gaps in Existing Knowledge XI. Country Profiles XII. General Bibliography (highly selected and annotated where approp- riate) XII.1. LÃ©xica, encyclopedias, directories XII.2. Bibliographies, discographies, iconographies, etc. XII.3. Histories, monographs, periodicals, etc. IV Implementation Phases of Production The MLM project has three principal phases, devoted to the following: 1) working papers, 2) substantive writing, 3) editing. Working Papers: The first or planning phase has been substantially completed, although all planned formats remain subject to emendation by the Board of Directors, often on the advice of special consultants or as a byproduct of dis- semination to interested colleagues, including those in other disciplines. The coordinators of the seven main regions have each been asked to prepare three working papers: 132</page><page sequence="14">a. Inventory of existing documentation and identification of gaps b. Geocultural consideration for the region in question c. Table of Contents (or synopsis) for the volume(s) devoted to their region. Substantive Writing: We are currently embarked on the second phase - the writing of specific chapters - which is expected to take two or three years. Wherever possible, the writing will be done by scholars from the regions them- selves. Selection of authors is being made by the Board of Directors upon recommendation of the regional coordinations. Thus far, some twenty-five scho- lars have been commissioned. Each author writing on a specific theme is expected to make use of the guidelines where they are appropriate but expected also to feel free to include any other topics or concepts he or she considers ger- mane to the culture involved. The chapters will be submitted to the appropriate regional coordinator and to designated specialists for comment and advice. Ulti- mate acceptance will rest with the Board of Directors. Such self-correcting mechanisms are essential to all phases of the project. The "joint-inquiry" approach is predicated on the expection, justified by the history of science, that those mysterious "cultural guidance systems", which appear to come into ope- ration when a certain number of minds address the same overarching ques- tions, will function for a humanistic endeavour. Editing: The pulling together of the volumes will be an ongoing process that begins during the second (substantive writing) phase and continous for at least two subsequent years. The regional coordinators will be responsible for the ini- tial integration of the accepted chapters and the shaping of their volume or vol- umes in general accordance with the guidelines. An international panel of editors will complete this process and supervise the overall synthesis of the twelve vol- umes so that a cohesive whole can be achieved. Channels of Interaction: Simultaneously with the writing and editing phases a number of complementary activities are being organized: Regional Meetings: Special meetings bringing together scholars working on the project in different regions are planned. They are designed to discuss prob- lems, clarify issues, eliminate lacunae, and avoid duplication of effort. The first one occurred in Kinshasa, Zaire, in February 1983. (Twenty-one musicologists from all over Africa attended - an unprecedented event.) The second and third, which took place in Stockholm, January and May of 1 984, involved coordination of the work for Europe I, Europe II, and for the Soviet Asian Republics. Further 133</page><page sequence="15">regional meetings are planned during 1984-85 in Morocco, Mexico City, and Tokyo. Work in Progress Publications: These regional working papers (and more gen- eral supplementary studies) are being published in a series of MLM pamphlets subtitled Work in Progress. Four of these pamphlets have already appeared; others, in the offing, will also include drafts of the methodological essays plan- ned for Volume I.5 World Inventory of Recorded Traditional Music (WIRTRAM): The Interna- tional Council for Traditional Music (ICTM) has given high priority to this inven- tory, which will cover public archives, private collections, radio/TV archives, commercially published discs, and cassettes. WIRTRAM is designed to answer the question: "Where do music recordings of a given people/ethnic group/music category, etc. exist?" The inventory will also provide information on accessibil- ity, technical medium, compiler and date or original collection, and availability of supporting documentation. All information will be computerized and may ulti- mately be adapted for a supplementary volume to the MLM project. Recordings: With the advice of WIRTRAM, a library of recorded illustrations will be assembled for issuance with the MLM volumes. Recordings will be carefully selected by authors and coordinators on the basis of their suitability to specific texts and their technical excellence. The UNESCO series will be used where pos- sible, as will materials from public archives, private collections, and commercial catalogues. The most effective and appropriate technological vehicles available at the time of publication (cassettes, compact discs, etc.) will be employed. Organology: Special attention will be given to the major musical instruments of the world. Each will be defined, described, and illustrated with pictures and/or drawings. Classification data will include materials, measurements, perfor- mance techniques, musician's status, sociocontextual ambience, etc. The Royal Swedish Academy of Music will serve as a center for this activity. Bibliography: Each author will provide a selective bibliography with his con- tribution. It will be briefly annotated where appropriate for specific items and re- present the latest state of knowledge on the given subject. Significant reference tools, other more complete bibliographies, discographies, etc. should be included. The international and national centers of the RÃ©pertoire International 134</page><page sequence="16">de LittÃ©rature Musicale (RILM), see below, will provide assistance especially for recent publications. Lexicography: Contributors to MLM will be asked to define terms, concepts, and categories, giving transliteration from the original language and an indica- tion of pronunciation. Appendix A (vol. 20) to the New Grove Dictionary, "an index of terms used in articles on non-Western music, folk music, and kindred topics", will be taken as a starting point. These definitions may be compiled in a glossary for inclusion in Volume XII of MLM or in a supplementary volume. Iconography: Photographs, drawings, maps, charts, and other visual materials (both in color and in black and white), will be prepared for inclusion in the vol- umes. The resources of the RÃ©pertoire International d'Iconographie Musicale (RIdIM) will be available (see below). Musical Notation: Modern staff notation will be employed where appropriate for the region. Alternative systems, when chosen for reasons specific to a culture, will be clearly explained. In general, a recorded example will be given preference to a written one (or used in conjunction with it). Related Sources of Information: MLM will be able to profit from the extensive experience and resources of a number of international projects organized through one or more International Member Organizations of the International Music Council. For example: 1 . RÃ©pertoire International de LittÃ©rature Musical (RILM), the worldwide com- puterized abstract journal covering all scholarly literature on music (books, arti- cles, dissertation, etc.) that has appeared since 1967. 2. RÃ©pertoire International des Sources Musicales (RISM), a vast and continu- ing bibliography in many volumes covering notated early music sources, both published and in manuscript. 3. RÃ©pertoire International d'Iconographie Musicale (RIdIM), a network of holdings, gathering and indexing reproductions of visual materials (painting, drawing, graphics, photographs) relating to music, with a view toward serving performers, teachers, musicologists, social historians, etc. 4. World Inventory of Sources of Music Information (WISMI), an IMC project realized thus far in only a few countries, designed to gather factual data interna- tionally and nationally on all aspects of current musical life: agencies and found- 135</page><page sequence="17">ations, public and private; education and research; libraries, archives, and museums; performance groups, concert halls, opera houses; festivals, compet- itions, and congresses; the commercial music industry, including the media, publishers, copyists, music instrument manufacturers, trade unions, etc.; societies, associations, clubs; and publications including periodicals. Conclusion - Point of Departure Labor on a set of volumes in what it is, only by virtue of its addressing a future set of volumes. If Music in the Life of Man and its eventual offspring can teach us anything, it is that, whether the creation being supplanted over time is a music, or a model of man making music, knowledge will grow and expression deepen where con- ' tinuity and experiment are not experienced as mutually exclusive. The game of paraphrase we played in our introduction gave birth to a statement, as we said, both grand and humbling in its implications. It is humbling because for our labors to address a future set of volumes means that they must engineer their own fall from grace -their own obsolescence, as it were. It is grand enough, because for our labors to address those future MLM's, and be defined on the strength ofthat, means that a continuity of purpose is envisioned.
