Opinion Misuse of the Term Strategy During the past decade biologists have become increasingly teleological in the terminology used to describe the activities of living organisms. This tendency is especially noticeable in discussions of evolution, life cycles, and the reactions of organisms to environmental stresses. It is manifested in such titles as "The Reproductive Strategy of Higher Plants," "The Strategy of the Red Algal Life History," and "Plant Strategies and Vegetation Processes." Too many papers have an anthropomorphic approach to biological problems in terms of a search for adaptations that will enable organisms to attain "goals" such as increased drought or cold tolerance. One scientist wrote, "We may usefully view a plant as an intricate control system in which responses to stress are strategies directed toward achieving certain goals." How can plants or animals have goals, or strategies to attain these goals, which really exist only in the minds of the writers? Dictionaries define strategy as the development of plans of action to attain desired ends, usually social, eco- nomic, military, or political. How can a plant or animal, either as an individual or as a species, predict changes in the environment or know what it should do when confronted by an environmental crisis? Plants subjected to water stress of- ten develop smaller, thicker leaves, with thicker cuticle, and have a smaller leaf area and a larger root-shoot ratio. However, these changes did not come about for the purpose of increasing drought tolerance, but because water stress causes physiological and biochemical changes in plants that affect their structure. These reactions to water stress result from screening by natural selection among the numerous mutations and recombinations that have occurred in the evolu- tion of a particular kind of plant. As A. D. Bradshaw wrote in 1965, successful organisms represent a combination of characters that minimizes deleterious ef- fects and maximizes advantageous effects of structure and function. In other words, plant structure and function are compromises to conflicting pressures such as the necessity of absorbing carbon dioxide while regulating water loss. They are not the product of a carefully planned strategy, but the result of the screening of random variations by natural selection. Some writers seem to regard the use of teleological terminology such as, "striving to attain goals," as a way of catching the reader's attention. Others ap- parently use it metaphorically as a convenient method of examining problems. However, it is dangerous because it results in careless thinking and writing, and it misleads readers not trained in science who often mistake the metaphor for the truth. A humanist acquaintance, the late Harry Levy, suggested a warning that, "The attribution of purpose to plants is not intended literally, and if so taken is dangerous to your mental health." Scientists can have goals and can de- velop research strategies to attain them, but plants cannot, unless we are willing to grant that they have intelligence and can make decisions. Terms such as "strategy" and "tactics" are philosophically objectionable when applied to plants and lower animals, and are best left to politicians, the military, and ath- letic coaches. PAUL J.
