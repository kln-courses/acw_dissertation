Nowhere was this use of tex- tile imagery as a symbolic system more richly developed than in the Paracas culture of the south coast ( ca . 600-150 b.c.), a society that buried its elite dead wrapped in many fine weavings. In death as in life, Paracas rulers were lavishly attired in a wardrobe that included mantles, tunics, ponchos, skirts, loincloths, and headpieces. Upon these garments were embroidered rows of brightly colored anthro- pomorphic, zoomorphic and com- posite figures. On each individual garment, only one image is repeated but those same figures reappear on other weavings and in other bundles, suggesting that they con- vey information as a thematic unit about the social persona of the deceased. The isolation and inter- pretation of the iconographie pat- terns produced by this traditibn are one key to the understanding of the religious and social configuration of the Paracas culture. One of the most persistent images on Paracas textiles so con- sistently bears the characteristics attributed to the most ancient of religious practitioners- the shaman during his magical combat with the spirits- that it has been named the "Ecstatic Shaman" This theme is found embroidered on 40 different surviving Paracas garments, as well as on a three-dimensional bone carving in the Museo Nacional de Antropologia e Arqueologia in Lima, and painted on a leather- covered staff in Sweden's Goteborg Etnografiska Museum. In each instance, the human body is arched sharply backward as though doing a back bend. The head is thrown back, and the arms stretch out to the sides or up into the air.

Long strands of unbound hair flow like streamers from the inverted or tilted head. In some images, each strand of hair is metaphorically a serpent, a long, thin, sinuous animal which, like hair, possesses impres- sive self -regenerati ve powers. All of the figures wear a skirt and most have a nude torso. Nine of the images clearly show the torso with skele- tonized ribs; others have unusual geometric markings or protuber- ances from the chest, analogous to the skeletonized ribs. Other items of ritual parapher- nalia include objects clutched in the hands such as flute-like instruments, tubes or batons, fans, knives, and trophy heads. Many figures wear a pectoral morphologically similar to a wooden mirror pendant found in a Paracas funerary bundle, and an adornment, often a trophy head, is sometimes suspended from the neck or chin. So, although some variability in minor details can be detected within the Ecstatic Shaman group, more striking is the icono- graphie consistency. Many traits, however, set this theme apart from the mainstream of Paracas imagery. Other anthropo- morphic figures executed in this- the block color style of embroidery -are fully dressed. They wear the loincloths, skirts, tunics, and head- bands actually found in the Paracas funerary bundles. Their heads are invariably swathed in turbans or covered with elaborate headdresses, and the hair completely concealed. Even their posture is more static and sedate. No other group of im- ages emphasizes the chest by puffing it out or showing the ribs. Some of the variation within the Ecstatic Shaman theme can be attributed to the long span of its popularity. Although many of the textiles used in this study belong to unprovenienced private collec- tions, the remainder, in the Museo Nacional de Antropologia e Arqueo- logia in Lima, are from scientifi- 22 Archaeology</page><page sequence="4">(Above) Paracas mantles are covered with rows of embroidered images .

The Ecstatic Shaman theme is found on specimens attributable to 18 different Paracas bundles that represent a time span of 150 years, from approximately 300 to 150 B.c., what scholars call the Early Intermediate period, Epochs 1 and 2. The 40 garments decorated with this image provide an unusually large sample; most themes embroidered in the block color style appear on an average of four different garments. Thus, the relatively narrow range of variation suggests the stability and coherence of the concept represented by the Ecstatic Shaman. This thematic unit has been described by several scholars as dancers or falling figures. The figure, although smiling, seems to have met with disaster. Its head displays features of a trophy head and its ribs stand out in its bare chest as though from flaying or starvation. Although "dancing" and "falling" may be appropriately descriptive, the symbolism conveyed by the posture of these figures is more complex. The two actions are not mutually exclusive; indeed, both could be interpreted as part of a cognitive set that defines this human image as an ecstatic shaman. The characteri- zation of the figures as dancing is derived largely from the curious posture. With thrown-back head, arched chest, bent knees, and raised arms, the images seem frozen in the midst of frenetic action. The perception of the figures as dancing is predicated on the assumption that they stand with their feet on the ground. This orientation is seen in both instances where this figure is illustrated in a medium other than textile embroidery and where the orientation is fixed. The three- dimensional bone carving in Lima and the painted leather-covered staff in Goteborg, for example, show shaman figures standing erect with their heads thrown back. The per- September/October 1986 23</page><page sequence="5">Although there is some variability in minor details within the Ecstatic Shaman group , more striking is the iconographie consistency . ception of the figures as falling is dependent on their orientation within the larger context of the weaving. In any given piece, the images may be upright, horizontal or inverted. More central to the portrayal of the shaman is our suggestion that this pose denotes magical flight. Dancing and falling are thus ancil- lary to this primary symbolic ex- pression. Whether the goal be ascent to the celestial sphere or descent to the underworld, the destination is reached in a trance induced by danc- ing, the monotonous sounds of music, sensory deprivation, hallu- cinogens or powerful intoxicants. Through his magical flight, the shaman is enabled to traverse un- known territory too perilous for ordinary mortals. And, when his mission is over, the return to the land of the living is often a falling back to earth, cast down by the spirits. As a coherent ideogram, expressing three actions simultaneously, this motif would appear to portray the ecstatic voyage of the shaman to other worlds- the lands of the spirits and of the dead. More than any other attribute, the unbound hair conveys the im- pression of flight. The symbolism of unbound hair is, however, more complex than the simple illustration of an action. As an attribute often emphasized on trophy heads, flow- ing hair conveys connotations of life, death, rebirth, and renewal. Superstitions regarding hair seem universal throughout antiquity because its constant growth and renewal is seen as a point of concen- tration of the vital energy of the whole person. Severe precautions, including braiding, binding or cov- ering the hair, are necessary to counteract the inherent vulner- ability of such spiritual concentra- tions to malign forces. According to the Spanish chroniclers Arriaga and Cobo, long hair was regarded as an important adornment of Inca shamans and may even have been emblematic of certain classes of sorcerers. With few exceptions in Paracas textile imagery, only trophy heads and these shamanic represen- tations have unbound hair, perhaps signifying a state of immunity from spirit attack or a oneness with the spirits, granted by ecstatic trance. Two of the predominant attri- butes that shamanic costume is intended to display are the ability to fly and the prestige of the dead man returned to life. The significance of death as a shamanic state is am- plified by the skeletonized portrayals in some of these textiles. The flight of the shaman to the spirit world is symbolic death and rebirth. Through his sacred ecstatic condi- tion, he enters the lands accessible to mortals only by death, and is miraculously reborn, lb reduce one- self to the skeletal condition is equivalent to re-entering the womb of this primordial life- to a com- plete renewal, a mystical rebirth. Resurrection from the bones is a com- mon theme in mythologies rooted in the shamanic tradition wherein the essence of life is contained in the most enduring elements of the body. The recurrent practice of representing the skeleton on the shaman's costume serves to distin- guish his non-ordinary reality. These depictions of the skeleton, the core of the body, imply the sacred status of the shaman, one who has died and been reborn. On several Paracas garments included in this sample, the Ecstatic 24 ARCHAEOLOGY</page><page sequence="6">In this image , strands of hair as well as the ribs are described metaphorically as serpents- ani- mals which , like hair, possess self-regenera ti ve powers. Shaman is held up in the air with its chest pulled to the mouth of a larger figure, perhaps an initiatory demon devouring the neophyte. Since the concept of ritual dismember- ment, disembowelment by the spirits, and rebirth from the bones is an integral part of shamanic ini- tiation, this manner of portrayal is congruent with the shamanic tradition. T he accessories of the Ecstatic Shaman figure form a symbolic set that contributes to, and assumes meaning from, the more dramatic elements. The pectoral may be a mirror, granting the shaman super vision. A baton, usually grasped in the hand, is held to the mouth in one example, suggesting a flute, or a tube for ingesting hallucinogens. The feather fan confers upon the bearer the qualities and power of the bird, a patron of ecstatic intoxi- cation. Just as the human spirit is concentrated in the hair of the head, the power of the bird resides in the feathers. Thus, feathers are particularly charged with super- natural power.

In addition to the 40 textiles, the bone carving and the painted staff, in five other images the shaman appears as an accessory figure rather than alone as the primary image. A small arched figure with flowing hair may be clutched under the arm of a larger anthropomorphic image, attached to the end of streamers emanating from the body of a larger figure, or incorporated into the face mask of a principal figure. Each of the garments that is decorated with these images comes from a very late Paracas bundle. These late rep- resentations seem to condense pre- viously separate themes into a single more elaborate unit. It is probable that the ecstatic shamanic figure confers supernatural status on the associated larger image. The elements comprising this thematic unit are all coherent mani- festations of the ideology of a sha- manic tradition. In its variant forms, shamanism persisted through time and space in the Andean region from the earliest horizons through the Inca period to the present. The depiction of shamans in Paracas art is entirely consistent with other evidence from Prehispanic Peru, and indeed closes a gap in the con- tinuity of the tradition. In their discussion of the role of the hallu- cinogenic San Pedro cactus in induc- ing ecstatic trances by modern-day shamanic folk healers, archaeolo- gists Douglas Sharon and Christo- pher Donnan point to the probable antiquity of its use by identifying artistic representations of the cactus in many ancient Peruvian art styles. Among the numerous items men- tioned, they name from the south coast a Chavin textile found near Paracas. This textile has a painted depiction that suggests that San Pedro was being used in that area in the first millennium b.c. They note that San Pedro was used on the south coast of Peru after the decline of Chavin influence, using as evi- dence stalks of the cactus painted on large ceramic urns from the Nasca culture (ca. 100 b.c. to A.D. 500). Although there are no apparent depictions of San Pedro in Paracas" art, the magical cactus capable of altering physical perceptions, these images of ecstatic shamans indicate the presence of a shamanic tradition. The garments on which these figures were embroidered were pre- sumably worn by the rulers of Paracas, those men who were buried in the large funerary bundles exca- vated in the Paracas Peninsula. One of the important functions of a Paracas leader would have been to mediate between man and the super- natural forces that influence and determine events in life, to bring psychic calm and confidence to the community, and to heal the sick. The clothing embellished with shaman figures served as a badge of office, an indicator of status, marking the special relationship of the wearer to the supernatural. □ September/October 1986 27</page></plain_text>
