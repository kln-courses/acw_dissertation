<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE 'EVOLUTIONARY' ECONOMICS OF THORSTEIN VEBLEN By THOMAS SOWELL MUCH more is understood about Veblen the social satirist, the personal eccentric, and the literary stylist than is understood about Veblen the economist. One reason for this is the mythology which has grown up around his economic thinking and its relationship to later 'institution- alism'. Like Marx, Veblen suffers from the fact that many of his most knowledgeable interpreters are also disciples or sympathizers who do not always sharply distinguish the words of the master from the traditions of the followers. A reassessment of Veblen must include (1) Veblen's methodo- logical criticisms of traditional economics, (2) his intellectual relationship to Karl Marx, (3) his own economic theories, and (4) the meaning of 'institutionalism' in Veblen's writings as distinguished from the meaning it has acquired in later years. I. Methodology Veblen's central, most often repeated attacks on economics in general and marginal utility theory in particular revolved around (a) its 'un- realistic' assumptions as to human nature, and (b) its lack of an 'evolution- ary' approach to economic phenomena. However, these two apparently independent propositions turn out to be only different aspects of a single underlying argument. Veblen's understanding of the realism-of-assumptions question was much more sophisticated than that of latter-day institutionalists. He realized that 'assumptions' as analytical tools must be judged by their efficacy for the purpose at hand rather than by standards of descriptive adequacy. He saw that to be 'serviceable' an hypothesis need 'not be true to life '.1 There was 'no call to impugn these premises of the marginal utility economics within their field '.2 He understood that the 'economic man' and similar conceptions were 'not intended as a competent expres- sion of fact', but represented an 'expedient of abstract reasoning' Although Veblen's views on this methodological point were substantially the same as those of the present-day 'Chicago school' he has been re- peatedly and erroneously identified with the opposite position charac- teristic of later institutionalists.4 Veblen objected to the marginal utility theory's conception of a passive, adaptive man as inadequate for the purpose of analysing creative change, 1 Thorstein Veblen, The Place of Science in Modern Civilization (New York, 1961), p. 221. 2 Ibid., p. 239. 3 Ibid., p. 142.

According to Veblen, the marginalist theorems 'indicate the conditions of survival to which any innovation is subject, supposing the innovation to have taken place, not the conditions of variational growth '. But what Veblen was seeking was precisely a theory as to why innovations take place. 'The question . . . is not how things stabilise themselves in a "static state", but how they endlessly grow and change.'3 The issues of unrealism, and non-evolutionary viewpoint reduced to one issue only. It was not that the 'unrealistic' aspects of the marginal utility theory invalidated its answers to the questions to which it was directed. It was that these unrealistic elements would invalidate it for explaining what Veblen wished to explain: how men change surrounding conditions rather than simply adapt to them. Veblen asserted: ... it is the characteristic of man to do something, not simply to suffer pleasures and pains through the impact of suitable forces. He is not simply a bundle of desires that are to be saturated by being placed in the path of the forces of the environment, but rather a coherent structure of propensities and habits which seeks realisation and expression in an unfolding activity.4 This assumption was depicted as being more in line with 'later psycho- logy' and 'modern anthropological research' but the view of the marginal utility theory was not rejected as being necessarily wrong merely because it was 'unrealistic'. Of course Veblen as a sardonic critic and an incon- sistent human being sometimes lapsed into random disparagement of unrealistic models, but this was not the position he took where he gave the subject sustained attention. Although Veblen's discussions of economics abound with calls for an evolutionary or Darwinian approach, his statements as to what this specifically involved were sparse and sketchy. Abandoning statics for dynamics was part of it, but only a part. Veblen defined evolutionary economics as 'an inquiry into cultural or institutional development as affected by economic exigencies '. To pursue this problem was to make a major change of purpose in the discipline of economics. Economic pro- cesses were to be investigated not in terms of the equilibrium toward which they tended,6 but in terms of the cultural background from which they had emerged, and in terms of their wider present and prospective social consequences.7 Evolutionary economics sought to understand not merely quantitative changes but primarily 'changes in kind '8-e.g., the move- ment from the handicraft era to that of modern factories with all its atten- I Thorstein Veblen, op. cit., p. 73. 2 Ibid., pp. 176-7. s Thorstein Veblen, Essays in Our Changing Order, ed.

A marginaiist frame of reference could not 'deal with phenomena of growth except so far as growth is taken in the quantitative sense of a variation in magnitude, bulk, mass, number, frequency'.' It was not only, or even primarily, the increase in output from the handicraft era to that of modern manufacturing with which Veblen was concerned, but the great changes in the whole social and economic landscape which it brought. Another Veblenian charge against traditional economics was that of teleology. His approach, by contrast, 'seeks to know and explain the structure and functions of economic society in terms of how and why they have come to be what they are, not, as so many economic writers have explained them, in terms of what they are good for and what they ought to be '*2 He objected, for example, to the consideration of money in terms of its useful functions as a medium of exchange or store of value, rather than in terms of its historical emergence, contemporary economic effects (beneficial or detrimental), and its impact on wider social phenomena. The reduction of wealth to a single money measure facilitates comparisons of persons with widely varying kinds of wealth and life-styles, and thus, according to Veblen, promotes emulation. Social competitiveness was thus one by-product of money; so were 'pecuniary canons of taste'-the habit of judging the merits of persons and things according to their price tags.4 To investigate money from this point of view was to be 'evolutionary'; to investigate it in terms of its economic purpose was to be teleological. Veblen did not deny that money was a medium of exchange, etc., but opposed the whole approach which looked for useful purposes in a given situation rather than factors which caused situations to metamorphose over time. While Veblen frequently implied that an apologetic intent underlay teleological conceptions, his basic objection was to teleology as such. He was opposed not only to the imputation of 'a consistent propensity tending to some spiritually legitimate end5', but also to concentration on the function of an economic entity even where there was no apologetic element of a 'meliorative trend' or of a 'harmony of interests '.6 Even where a teleological approach was taken with a view to improving economic func- tions, Veblen was scornful of it as unscientific: WThat would be the scientific rating of the work of a botanist who should spend his energy in devising ways and means to neutralize the ecological variability of plants, or of a physiologist who conceived it the end of his scientific endeavors to rehabilitate the vermiform appendix or the pineal eye, or to denounce and penalize the imitative coloring of the Viceroy butterfly ?' 1 Loc. cit. 2 Ibid., p. 267. 3 Ibid., p. 124. 4Ibid., pp. 246-7; Thorstein Veblen, The Theory of the Leisure Class (New York, 1934), chapter vi. 5 The Place of Science in Modern Civilization, p. 61. 6 Ibid., p. 68. 7 Ibid., p. 189 n.</page><page sequence="4">180 'EVOLUTIONARY' ECONOMICS OF THORSTEIN VEBLEN There has been widespread misunderstanding of Veblen's attacks on what he regarded as the teleological conceptions of the classical economists. It was not simply a case of a critic of the existing order opposing its defenders. It was their approach even more than their results or their sympathies which were under fire. Veblen likewise opposed what he con- ceived to be reform-oriented teleology underlying the 'grievances and remedies''1 in John Bates Clark's economic writings. He similarly opposed what he conceived to be revolution-oriented teleology in Karl Marx.2 Veblen's detached and essentially anti-Pragmatic philosophy3 contrasts sharply with the outlook of the institutionalist school, as later discussion will show. It will not be surprising to discover that the grafting of institu- tionalist practices on to Veblenian philosophy produced some interesting contradictions. It should be noted, however, that Veblen's harshest criticisms on this and other points were directed to early, even pre-classical economics,4 and that he recognized the historical movement of the discipline away from such metaphysical notions, though with surviving remnants of the earlier thought still in evidence in his own time.5 He observed, for example, that 'it can no longer be said that the concept of normality implies approval of the phenomena to which it is applied .6 He spoke of the 'quasi-evolu- tionary tone of neo-classical economics'7 and praised the 'dispassionate- ness' of such contemporaries as Alfred Marshall and Edwin Cannan.8 Much of Veblen's colourful mockery, which has frequently been quoted against theoretical refinements in general, was in fact directed against practices which he recognized as past or passing in his own day. It might be said of Veblen, as he said of Marx, that critics 'have not sufficiently appreciated the radical character of his departure's in the questions he asked, and hence have tended to misunderstand the answers he gave. Had economics followed Veblen, it would have become a funda- mentally different kind of inquiry. His sustained attacks on the 'pre- conceptions of economic science'10 were not attacks on the validity of particular doctrines but attacks on the general outlook which gave rise to such a line of (to him) meaningless inquiry into economic statics, while The Place of Science in Modern Civilization, p. 188. 2 Ibid., p. 436. 3 Veblen wrote when the Pragmatism of William James and John Dewey was at its peak. However, he rejected its assumption that knowledge was sought exclusively for instrumental purposes and ignored its methodological insistence on the importance of making hypotheses testable. In addition to explicit arguments against it (ibid., pp. 7, 8, 19; Thorstein Veblen, The Higher Learning in America, [New York, 1957] p. 4) he made repeated satiric use of William James's phrase, 'the will to believe'. For example, Thorstein Veblen, The Nature of Peace (New York, 1945), pp. 67, 364; Thorstein Veblen, The Instinct of Workomnanship (New York, 1964), p. 333. 4 The Place of Science in Modern Civilization, pp. 82-147. 5 Ibid., pp. 68-69, 83-84. 6 Ibid., p. 178.

Veblen attacked the questions of traditional economics rather than the answers. 'The postulates of marginal utility' were criticized because 'they confine the attention' to a narrow range of phenomena and thereby tend to 'exclude from theoretical inquiry . . . the facts of cultural growth . . . ', They took as given the individual tastes which Veblen wished to investigate as by-products of the evolution of social conventions under economic stress. Traditional economic laws 'are theorems as to the limits which the economic (commonly the pecuniary) interest imposes upon the range of activities to which the other life interests of men incite, rather than theorems as to the manner and degree in which the economic interest creatively shapes the general scheme of life '2 Just as it is easy to understate the differences in purposes between Veblen and traditional economics, it is easy to overstate their substantive differences in the areas of overlapping interest. Veblen's praise of 'Pro- fessor Marshall's great work'3 was but one indication of this. Veblen's lengthy explorations of the methodological ruins of early economics were designed to show the genesis of certain key preconceptions, of which current disserviceable notions could be regarded as atrophied survivals. A complicating factor in any attempt to understand Veblen's position vis-a-vis other economists is his frequent lapse into reckless misinterpreta- tion of their views. Thus, for example, he would have Adam Smith a defender of the doctrine that profits were wages of superintendence, when in fact Smith had argued against this conception.4 Similarly, Ricardo was blamed for importing Benthamite utilitarianism into economics,5 though it would be difficult to find a more uncompromising opponent of utility in value theory. Veblen's misunderstandings of Marx were too numerous to cite.6 The general effect was to force Marxian economics into the pre- conceived mould of ultra-rationalistic, hedonistic Hegelianism required by Veblen's theory of the effect of ideology on analysis. In viewing both Marx and traditional economists, Veblen never distinguished between their seeing rationality in the economic process and their assuming similar rationality in the participants.

Veblen and Marx In his critique of economics, as in other areas, Veblen had a large, unacknowledged debt to Karl Marx. Veblen's teleology-apologetics charge was an echo of Marx's claim that 'bourgeois' economists were incapable of distinguishing a general economic function from its particular manifesta- tion under capitalism. Marx objected to thus spuriously legitimizing and eternalizing capitalist institutions through innocence-by-association with enduring economic necessities. For example, capital in the sense of an instrument of production is an economic necessity, but capital in the sense of a legal entity causing income to flow to its owners was an artifact of existing arrangements.' Following Marx, Veblen sharply distinguished an essential activity from its particular cultural expression, not only with his well-known dichotomy between 'industry' and 'business', but also with his distinctions between 'clothing' and 'dress ',2 'learning' and 'educa- tion',3 and between the 'citizen' and the 'patriot '. In his methodological discussion, Veblen's distinction between 'taxo- nomic' and 'evolutionary' analysis was operationally identical with the Marxian distinction between 'metaphysical' and 'dialectical' thinking, which Engels had illustrated with the contrast between the taxonomist Linnaeus and the evolutionist Darwin.5 It was essentially the distinction between studying the nature of a thing and studying its processes of development. Veblen's claim that his own 'Darwinian' approach to economics differed in substance from Marx's 'Hegelian' approach was groundless, though it has been uncritically repeated by commentators.6 The difference between Darwin and Hegel, according to Veblen, was that the latter's evolutionary theory was teleological. But, as Engels had pointed out long before, it was a 'blunder' to completely identify the 'Marxian dialectics with the Hegelian'.' Teleology was precisely what Marx and Engels had rejected in Hegel. Engels had criticized Hegel on the ground of teleology in his Dialectics of Nature8 and Marx had hailed Darwin's blow at teleological thinking as his major accomplishment.9 ' Karl Marx, A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy (Chicago, 1904), pp. 269- 70.

SOWELL 183 The idea that Marx envisioned communism teleologically as the ultimate consummation of history, as Veblen charged,' was contrary to both the general trend of his thinking and to his specific pronouncements. If the charge of teleology were reduced to mean simply producing a model whose outcome was a change of which the author approved, then Veblen would be equally guilty with Marx. The 'Soviet of Engineers' which Veblen foresaw was obviously preferable to capitalism in his eyes. To Veblen's credit it must be observed that, unlike Marx, he had grave reservations as to the progressive nature of historical change,3 and as to whether social necessity would produce a change at all: . . . history records more frequent and more spectacular instances of the triumph of imbecile institutions over life and culture than of peoples who have by force of instinctive insight saved themselves alive out of a desperately precarious institu- tional situation, such, for instance, as now faces the peoples of Christendom.4 While Veblen was a socialist, he was an unorthodox one. The common man was never for Veblen the earnest stalwart of socialist literature, nor was he prepared to believe that workers became increasingly destitute under capitalism. The idea that the rich were growing richer and the poor poorer was dismissed as 'farcical'. Capitalism had produced 'an ameliora- tion of the lot of the less favored in a relatively greater degree than that of those economically more fortunate '.5 The facile suggestion has some- times been made that Veblen was simply trimming his sails on this contro- versial subject out of concern for his precarious academic career, especially at the time of his early writings on socialism.6 But where he differed from orthodox socialists Veblen's views remained substantially unchanged throughout his career, even in his later, more radical (or outspoken) period. Moreover, his reason for favouring socialism-waste under capital- ism-remained unchanged, though his emphasis shifted from waste in consumption to waste in production. While his Theory of the Leisure Class dealt with waste by the wealthy, Veblen found the poor equally vain and wasteful. A 'not inconsiderable 1 The Place of Science in Modern Civilization, pp. 416-17. 2 For Marx the epochal significance of the society he envisioned was not that it marked the end of historical evolution, but that it would facilitate further development. Hence- forth social evolution could take place without armed revolution (final paragraph, The Poverty of Philosophy). Engels was shocked by socialists who conceived of socialist society as 'a stable affair fixed once and for all' (Marx and Engels, Selected Correspondence, p. 473). In an unpublished manuscript Marx declared that 'communism is not itself the aim of human development or the final form of human society'.

This was charged to the capitalist economy's emphasis on money, which produced a race for 'pecuniary emulation' which 'no advance in the average well-being of the community can end ... '.2 Veblen estimated waste to account for one-half the economic activity of the country, so that even if socialism 'should prove less effective for the production of goods' it would still represent economic progress.3 In later years, with his emphasis now on waste in production, Veblen decided that under socialism production would 'exceed the current output by several hundred per cent'.4 Greater efficiency rationality and material output had also been pictured by Marx among the incidental benefits of socialism, but only as minor by- products. It was capitalism's 'historic mission' to have already created these things; socialism's mission was to turn them to better human use. Marx's criticism of capitalism was precisely that it was a system 'in which the labourer exists to satisfy the needs of self-expansion of existing values, instead of on the contrary, material wealth existing to satisfy the needs of development on the part of the labourer '. The worker's development as a human being was more important to Marx than his more effective use as a factor of production. On this ground he criticized modern industrial occupations as crippling6 whereas Veblen regarded them as enhancing the worker's intelligence-in the sense that he became 'a more efficient workman '. Veblen's view was more narrowly confined to economic efficiency. Veblen and Marx differed not only as to what they expected socialism to accomplish, but also as to how they expected it to come about. Veblen saw engineers, rather than Marx's proletarians, as the instruments of revolution. This was not a chance difference of assumptions, but reflected a more basic difference between them concerning the derivation of ideas. According to Veblen's theory, the kind of intellectual activity involved in an individual's daily work determined his intellectual frame of reference, his canons of evidence, lines of inquiry, etc.: '. . . the scope and method of knowledge and belief which is forced on men in their everyday material concerns will unavoidably, by habitual use, extend to other matters as well . . .

SOWELL 185 tions and 'pecuniary' ('business') occupations was in part a distinction between what Veblen conceived to be useful and wasteful activities, it was primarily important because of 'the training and selective stress to which the character of these employments subjects the persons employed '. Business occupations involved personal competition and tended to produce or emphasize anthropomorphic and invidious concepts-merit, status, ability, natural rights, etc.-which were among the intellectual bulwarks of a class society. Industrial occupations, dealing with inanimate objects and the impersonal laws of science, tended to produce narrower notions of cause-and-effect, the 'submergence of the personal equation ',2 and a general outlook to which the concepts of the business class appeared not so much wrong as meaningless and irrelevant. Whereas Schumpeter argued that the entrepreneur lacked the necessary romantic appeal to perpetuate his dominance, Veblen argued that the sense of romanticism itself had atrophied in a machine age. Though Veblen granted, at least in his earlier work, that considerable economic progress had been made under capitalism, he nevertheless made the crucial assumption that capitalism's justification in the public mind rested not on this pragmatic basis, but on the intellectual tradition of natural (property) rights, on awe of great men, etc. It followed logically, on this assumption, that those whose mental processes were least receptive to this line of thought were therefore most prone to disenchantment with capitalism. The 'classes immediately in contact with the mechanical occupations' experience 'an ever-weakening sense of conviction, allegiance or piety toward the received institutions '.3 Though Veblen's thinly veiled advocacy of a general strike of engineers and of a 'Soviet of technicians' were products of his later years, the idea that belief in socialism was concentrated in scientific and technical per- sonnel appeared in his earliest writings and persisted throughout his career. Like other theories in which economic factors shape thought and action, it did not imply that rational calculation of individual or class interest was the prime motivation of men. Like the 'economic determinism' in the theories of Marx or of Schumpeter, it implied only that the social scene was differentially perceived by persons in different objective positions in the social organization of production, and that the conflict of differentially conditioned men would eventuate in a drastic reordering of society. The idealism or sincerity of the actors in the drama was not in question.4 1 Essays in Our Changing Order, p. 25. 2 The Vested Interests and the Common Man, p. 40. 3 The Theory of Business Enterprise, p. 154. 4 Thomas Sowell, 'Karl Marx and the freedom of the individual', Ethics, vol. lxxiii, no. 2 (Jan. 1963), p. 121; J.

Economic doctrines Despite Veblen's calls for an expansive conception of economics that would range into sociology, psychology, history, and anthropology, there were Veblenian doctrines which were narrowly economic in the traditional sense. Some of these were passing ad hoc pronouncements but others represented sustained analysis along purely economic lines. Major atten- tion was given to monetary and business cycle theory, with lesser attention being devoted to price theory, and largely descriptive coverage of unions, corporations, and natural resources. In business-cycle theory, Veblen rejected the notion of a true cycle with periodicity,' calling it an 'economic dogma' rather than a theory, 'since it is not held on reasoned grounds '.2 He thought periodicity possibly characteristic of the period from the post-Napoleonic depression to the 'great depression' of 1873, but not later. Moreover, the character of the downswing was regarded as being now a chronic recession intermittently relieved by prosperity, rather than a series of sharp contractions as in the earlier period. This estimate was remarkably similar to one introduced by Engels in a footnote in the third volume of Capital.3 But Veblen's theory of the business cycle-as distinguished from his characterizations of it- were entirely non-Marxian and distinctly his own. According to Veblen, a monetary crisis was brought on by the forced liquidation of over-capitalized corporate assets. Corporate assets tended to be over-capitalized both in terms of historical cost and prospective earning power. The divergence of asset valuation from actual cost was insistently repeated by Veblen as an illustration of the effect of the habit of pecuniary thinking by businessmen in contrast to the more 'realistic' thinking of scientists, engineers, etc. But this kind of over-capitalization played no active role in his theory of the business cycle. Over-capitaliza- tion relative to earning power was what precipitated a monetary crisis when creditors realized that this situation existed.4 Bankruptcy and chain-reactions of credit defaults brought on deflation, which was largely synonymous with depression in Veblen's view. Real output was not con- ceived to vary much between prosperity and depressions; the major variation was in the price level.5 For both businessmen and workers 'the distress which dull times brings is in some part a spiritual, emotional matter',6 based on falling prices and money wages. For Veblen depression was a result of the declining profitability of older capital with its high fixed charges based on its prospective earning power as of the time of its original investment. It was not the Keynesian decline 1 The Theory of Business Enterprise, p. 117. 2 Loc. cit. 3 Karl Marx, Capital (Chicago, 1909), vol. iii, pp. 574 n.-575 n. 4 The Theory of Business Enterprise, p. 99. 5 Ibid., p. 114. 6 Ibid., p. 115; Essays in Our Changing Order, pp. 112-13.</page><page sequence="11">T. SOWELL 187 in the marginal efficiency of new capital relative to the interest rate, but the decline in the prospective earnings of older capital relative to the interest rate, that was important.' However there is not here a conflict between Keynesian and Veblenian theories, but rather a difference of emphasis. Veblen's theory attempted to explain how the economy got into a depression; Keynes's theory attempted to explain why it did not get out. Veblen, like Keynes, was unimpressed by Say's Law, which he treated as an identity.2 Despite the fact that business fluctuations recur 'constantly '3 according to Veblen, there is 'no provision for a shrinkage of assets, and but slight and doubtful provision for a shrinkage of earnings' so that corporations are somewhat 'helpless in the face of adversity '. Businessmen simply lack foresight: '. . . short-sightedness and lack of insight beyond the con- ventional routine seem to be fairly universal traits of the class of men who engage in the larger business activities. '5 As for the long-range or ultimate consequences of business cycles, Veblen's views shifted over the years. In 1904 in The Theory of Business Enterprise he depicted depressions as growing 'more frequent and pro- longed, if not more pronounced '.6 The economy becomes progressively more prone to depressions, requiring less and less of a disturbance to set off liquidation.7 This is because the various parts of the credit economy are more comprehensively linked.8 The remedies for depression-aside from revolutionary abolition of capitalism-include waste by the govern- ment on armaments, public edifices, and imperialistic adventures,9 and a more monopolistic restriction of output along lines suggesting the N.I.R.A.10 A somewhat fascist-like war-oriented state" is depicted as an expedient to which business may be driven in response to the economic pressures of depressions and the growing 'materialistic scepticism' toward the rights of property12-both being results of the 'machine civilization'. A remarkable reversal had taken place by the time Veblen's last major work, Absentee Ownership, appeared in 1923. He now regarded the 'collu- sive regulation' of business and banking as sufficient to prevent any major upsetting of equilibrium,13 particularly when 'helped out by the good offices of the Federal Reserve . .. .'.4 Very uncharacteristically, Veblen's faith in the Federal Reserve's ability to forestall deflation was complete, blind, and unquestioning. It was perhaps symptomatic of the mood of the times that even an arch-critic of the society was convinced that it had become 1 Essays in Our Changing Order, p. 110. 2 Ibid., p. 104. 3 Thorstein Veblen, Absentee Ownership (New York, 1964), p. 92. 4 Ibid., p. 93.

According to Veblen, the business and banking com- munity's 'outstanding liabilities' were 'shielded from any ordinary hazard of liquidation '.1 No such 'sinister eventuality' as deflation 'need be appre- hended '.2 The 'increasing stability of the credit system '3 was repeatedly taken for granted4-and all this just a few years before 1929. However, despite his belief that a depression-proof economy had been achieved, Veblen was not optimistic as to the economic future. He re- garded the intervention of the Federal Reserve as tending to produce secular inflation,5 with the result that money output would rise while real output declined,6 under the combined 'sabotage' of business cartels and labour unions.7 The time in which he wrote was considered to be the 'critical point' beyond which there would be no real increase in output. Absentee Ownership closed with the fantastic prediction of 'a progressive shrinkage of the available means of life'*8 Only socialism could save the situation.9 Veblen's other economic theories did not rise appreciably above the level of his business-cycle theories, either in terms of inner logic or corre- spondence with external results. Indeed, the business-cycle theories were on a higher analytical plane than most of his other theories, in that they were in principle falsifiable by facts (and in practice grotesquely at variance with actual results).10 Some errors were as elementary as arguing in effect that businesses maximize total revenue rather than profits.11 Others were simple ad hoc predictions, e.g. that bankers would increasingly control industry12 -a prediction falsified by the growth of internal corporate financing. Pivotal doctrines in the Veblenian scheme were left in com- pletely unverifiable form. For example, the supposed secular growth in 'business' sabotage of 'industry'-a key doctrine in his over-all picture of the development of capitalism-was not conceived to produce an empirically observable decline in the growth rate; it was supposed to be overbalanced by the progressively more rapid improvement of technology.13 Veblen's treatment of the role of prices in resource allocation-or rather his lack of treatment of it-was remarkable in view of the relevance of this to his arguments against 'the price system'. Allocation was repeatedly depicted as a mere engineering problem.

Marx had repeatedly denounced socialists who envisioned government fiat prices,2 and Engels had argued strongly the need for free market price-determination under socialism in order to avoid simultaneous shortages and surpluses.3 The point is not that Veblen did not agree with such arguments but that he proceeded as if such arguments did not exist or need not be taken account of. Veblen's consideration of the link between utility and the price system was similarly slipshod. 'Usefulness' and 'wastefulness' were usefulness and wastefulness as judged by Veblen, not by the economic agents in- volved. He spoke of 'material serviceability'4 and 'brute serviceability5 simply' as if these were objectively given and readily ascertainable. Yet this line of argument was advanced as one invalidating the theories of John Bates Clark, which were based on traditional subjective utility.6 IV. Institutions and institutionalism The most important thing to be understood about Veblen's discussions of 'institutions' is the special definition which he gave to the term. Institutions were patterns of ideas, not organizational entities. Veblen defined institutions as 'settled habits of thought common to the generality of men'.' These included 'usage, customs, canons of conduct, principles of right and propriety '.8 Veblen was concerned to explain the evolution of these social habits and customs in response to economic and other changes. He differed fundamentally from later institutionalism (a term he did not use) in that he was concerned to analyse the derivation of ideas, not to describe the mechanics of institutions in the sense of organizational entities. Veblen was not engaged in amassing 'facts' about things but in evolving theories about ideas. He attempted, for example, to explain the reasons for the disproportionate representation of Jews among Western intel- lectuals.9 Similarly, his well-known distinction between 'business' and I The Engineers and the Price System, p. 142. 2 Karl Marx, Critique of Political Economy, pp. 103-6; Idem., The Poverty of Philo- sophy (Moscow, n.d.), pp. 84-87. 3F.

His most celebrated work, The Theory of the Leisure Class, was a theory of the derivation of certain con- sumptive ideas and practices or, as Veblen himself put it, 'an inquiry as to why and how the habits of life and of thought of the individual come to be modified'.' It was not merely a static recital of 'facts' in satirical style, but an attempt to trace the development of conspicuous consump- tion, conspicuous waste, etc., from barbarian ages. This purpose is not one which must be ingeniously read into Veblen, but one which was ex- plicitly stated in the work itself: The situation of today shapes the institutions of tomorrow through a selective, coercive process, by acting upon men's habitual view of things, and so altering or fortifying a point of view or a mental attitude handed down from the past. The institutions-that is to say the habits of thought-under the guidance of which men live are in this way received from an earlier time, more or less remotely earlier, but in any event they have been elaborated in and received from the past.2 Despite the anti-theoretical bent of later institutionalists, it is clear from Veblen's criticism of the Historical School that he appreciated the value of theory. These criticisms would apply equally to much of modern institutionalism. Veblen argued that 'the historical school can scarcely be said to cultivate a science at all, their aim being not theoretical work '. Their work 'bears the character of eclecticism rather than that of a con- structive advance'.4 When Veblen criticized traditional economics for not being 'an evolutionary science'5 it was not on the familiar grounds used by institutionalists (and others) that economics could not be a science because of the absence of controlled experiments, the unpredictability of human nature, etc. To Veblen it was not a science simply because econo- mists did not follow what he regarded as scientific methods. The scientific nature of a discipline turned on its methods rather than its subject-matter. The opposite view of the institutionalists, that economics was intrinsically not a science, was more in keeping with Malthus's methodological criti- cisms of Ricardo6 than with anything found in Veblen. Veblen spoke of other 'sciences that deal with human nature' and denied 'the sole efficacy of data' or of 'realism '.7 He added: The insistence on data could scarcely be carried to a higher pitch than it was carried by the first generation of the Historical School; and yet no economics is farther from being an evolutionary science than the received economics of the Historical School.8 1 Essays in Our Changing Order, p. 22. 2 The Theory of the Leisure Class, pp. 190-1. 3 The Place of Science in Modern Civilization, p. 254. 4 Ibid., p. 255. r Ibid., pp. 56-81. 6 T.

SOWELL 191 Veblen himself was by no means reluctant to theorize, or even-in one instance, at least-to express his ideas in equations.' The highly specula- tive character of most of his work was partly obscured by its common- sense categories (captain of industry, leisure class, etc.), whereas a more empirical work dealing with abstract categories (monetary velocity, balance of payments, etc.) might give the appearance of being more theoretical. Of course Veblen was not a theorist in the crucial sense of systematically theorizing. He showed no concern for internal logic or for the difficult process of consistently rendering his hypotheses in testable form. Facts were used for illustrating rather than testing theories. In all these slipshod practices he set the pattern for the non-theoretical (though not the anti-theoretical) aspects of modern institutionalism.2 For example, Veblen argued that the entrepreneur or 'captain of industry' resisted rather than promoted innovations3-and yet he also said that innovations had become more frequent after the ascendancy of the entrepreneur than before.4 Similarly he argued that the machine age produced rationalistic, sceptical, democratic, and pacific ideas, but charac- terized Germany-in the forefront of technology-as 'a drunken savage with a machine gun'.5 He explained this contradiction by Germany's late entry into the industrial age.6 A generation later-after still more techno- logical progress-Veblen's characterization would become even more apt. The point here is not simply that Veblen was wrong, but that he applied no empirical test to his hypotheses and made no effort to state these hypo- theses in such form as to permit others to do so. Nor did he evidence any awareness of the importance of this. Even obtrusive facts to the contrary were either ignored or were casually explained away. Veblen was not policy-oriented, as so many modern institutionalists tended to be. This was not accidental, but followed from his conception of economics and of intellectual activity in general. The kind of discipline which Veblen wished economics to become would have had little value as a guide to practical economic policy-nor did this matter from his point of view. In contrast to 'teleological' economics, economics of an evolu- tionary or 'genetic' character 'comprises nothing in the way of advice or 1 The Theory of Business Enterprise, pp. 198, 199, 203, 208, 210, 211, 212. 2 It has been claimed that it is wrong to say that institutionalists were not theorists (Douglas Dowd, Thorstein Veblen, [New York, 1964] p. 55). Of course everyone is a theorist in the sense of having hypotheses. By this standard anyone who can write at all could be said to be a writer. 3 The Theory of Business Enterprise, p. 27; The -Instinct of Workmanship, p. 173. 4 The -Instinct of Workmanship, p. 194; Absentee Ownership, p. 419. 5 The Nature of Peace, p. 238. 6 Thorstein Veblen, Imnpercial Germany and the Industrial Revolution (New York, 1939), p. 250. 7 Yet a sympathetic interpreter regarded the rise of Nazi Germany as a vindication of Veblen's theory.

Veblen was consistently opposed to the Pragmatists' belief that knowledge was sought as a guide to action. What 'urges men to the pursuit of knowledge is their native bent of curiosity-an impulsive proclivity to master the logic of facts . . . 2 According to Veblen, 'a knowledge of things is sought, apart from any ulterior use of the knowledge so gained '. This is 'the idle curiosity' which Veblen refers to throughout his writings, and which was regarded as a basic human trait as well as the motive force behind mankind's 'continued advance toward a more and more comprehensive system of knowledge'.4 Significantly, Veblen re- garded Malthus's 'humanitarian bias' and 'his weakness for considerations of expediency' as 'the great blemish of his scientific work .' This view of knowledge as an end in itself may help explain Veblen's non-involvement in any movement for reform or revolution, despite his unsparing criticism of the existing order. His celebrated detachment need not have been altogether a pose or literary device. The differences between Veblen and later institutionalists were real and fundamental, but there were obviously important similarities as well. It is a difficult question to what extent the range of similarities represents the coincidences of isolated opinions, to what extent the connexion between a basic conception and its corollaries, and to what extent the personal influence of Veblen's range of views on leading institutionalists who were his students or his students' students. The presence of another indepen- dent element of institutionalism deriving from John R. Commons is a further complicating factor. Veblen shared with later institutionalism an impressionistic approach to economics, a hostility to intellectual 'symmetry and system-building'6 and an emphasis on the non-rational sources of ideas and behaviour. These tendencies are still very much in evidence in contemporary writings but how much they owe to Veblen is problematical. The same tendencies can be found in Malthus, which suggests that they nlay be offshoots of a similar underlying conception. For example, emphasis on the non- rational element in economics undermines elaborate logical constructions and also tempts the economist to substitute his judgement for the judge- 1 The Place of Science in Modern Civilization, p. 268. 2 The Higher Learning in America, p. 148. 3 Ibid., p. 4. 4 The Place of Science in Modern Civilization, p. 9. 5 Ibid., p. 131. Malthus, for his part, argued that economics should be 'practically useful' and not 'merely gratify curiosity' (The Works and Correspondence of David Ricardo, ed. Piero Sraffa, [Cambridge, 1952] vol. viii, p. 286). Yet characteristically Malthus contradicted himself elsewhere by pointing out the practical advances that had grown out of idle curiosity (Thomas Robert Malthus, Principles of Political Economy, 2nd edition, pp. 12-13). He was not, however, referring specifically to economics in the latter instance. 6 The Place of Science in Modern Civilization, p. 68.</page><page sequence="17">T. SOWELL 193 ment of the individuals concerned. This substitution was made freely with no evidence of embarrassment by Veblen, Malthus, the institutionalists, and a considerable contemporary literature on 'waste-makers' and the spending habits of an 'affluent society'. If it is possible for third parties to determine what is 'really' useful, then government economic planning of various sorts becomes not only feasible but often advisable.' Veblen's evolutionary approach to ideas, treating them as 'modern' or 'outmoded' rather than in terms of systematically tested validity, sur- vives in full force in a wide range of literature, but particularly in those writings which have other neo-institutionalist earmarks. Frequently this tendency involves a certain recklessness with the facts of history, in order to show that a particular idea was all right at one time, but is now obsolete because of intervening economic changes.2 If ideas are conceived to age and decay like natural organisms, then obviously it is pedantic to devote great effort to techniques of determining their logical and empirical validity. The systematic theoretical apparatus of economics (including rigorous logic, mathematics, and statistical tech- niques) are thus either dismissed entirely or greatly de-emphasized.3 This particular set of attitudes and practices-of which Veblen was equally guilty with his followers-cannot be said to follow logically from the evolutionary approach to ideas. Marx had the same approach and yet applied his doctrines with a sophistication that put him much closer methodically to modern marginalist economics than to Veblen.4 More 1 Even Malthus, whose socio-political views ranged from conservative to reactionary, accepted this line of reasoning. For example, he had no qualms about recommending schemes designed to cause people to work beyond the point where their own perception of the utility of output and the disutility of labour would have caused them to cease (T. R. Malthus, Principles of Political Economy, 2nd ed., pp. 374, 355, 401). 2 Thus Adam Smith's laissez-faire was once all right because the real world did 'really work this way ... in the days of Adam Smith' (Robert L. Heilbroner, The Worldly Philoso- phers, [New York, 1961] p. 42). In reality, of course, The Wealth of Nations was a sustained attack on the way things 'really' worked in Adam Smith's time. 3With the inner core of analytical principles gone, economics is reduced from a discipline to merely a subject-matter, and one now only arbitrarily demarcated from other subject- matters (similarly reduced from disciplines) such as sociology, history, etc. The appeal of the 'interdisciplinary approach' to non-analytical minds is apparent. It might better be called the non-disciplinary approach, since it usually involves ranging over facts (or simple analysis) common to a number of disciplines with little use of the analytic tools developed in any. The explicit urging of this approach is later than Veblen, and again is especially prevalent in works having other institutionalist earmarks, but Veblen's own casual amalgamation of economics, anthropology, and psychology suggests a common basis for this tendency. To say that more than one discipline is needed for dealing with a particular set of prac- tical problems is a far cry from saying that an interdisciplinary approach is needed. For example, a mathematician who wishes to work in France might well need an understanding of the principles of the French language as well as the principles of mathematics-but he does not need an amalgam of the two (perhaps called 'mench' or 'frath'). 4Schumpeter argued that familiarity with the underlying methods of Marxian economics makes it easier to grasp the underlying methods of modern theory (Joseph A. Schumpeter, Economic Doctrine and Method, [New York, 1954] p. 121). An obvious example is Marx's use of systematic abstraction and successive approximations in the three volumes of Capitol,</page><page sequence="18">194 'EVOLUTIONARY' ECONOMICS OF THORSTEIN VEBLEN specifically, Marx avoided the fatal step of treating the age of an idea as something which would put it beyond a hearing. Veblen's repeated assertions that economics should deal with 'things as they are' implies considerably more than is immediately apparent in this simple common-sense formulation. Any discipline which means to be instrumental, and not merely to satisfy 'the idle curiosity', cannot be con- tent to analyse things as they are. Veblen's position was consistent for Veblen, but not for later, policy-oriented institutionalists. An instru- mental discipline must be teleological at least in the sense that it examines economic variables from the point of view of the degree to which they con- duce to some desired end, and the principles on which they can be made to serve these ends more effectively under other (moderately or radically) different circumstances. An instrumental discipline must abstract from things-as-they-are those elements-principles-which will be broadly applicable to other situations. Conversely, the most obtrusive features of a particular situation as it is may need to be disregarded in favour of an underlying principle common to a range of situations-even if these prin- ciples are not decisive in any particular situation. Even from a purely cognitive, rather than an instrumental, point of view, concentration on things as they are increases the dangers of obso- lescence and superficiality. Things as they are quickly become things as they were; theoretical principles endure longer than hard facts. Moreover, this down-to-earth approach readily degenerates into naive reliance on the perceptions of the economic agents themselves as a substitute for the economist's systematic analysis. The businessmen-don't-think-that-way objection to various economic theories has been one product of this approach. Veblen himself repeatedly advanced this kind of argument,' though in other contexts he noted in passing that the subjects' perception of a situation need not reveal the true relationships.2 so that it is only in the third volume that the analysis begins to 'approach step by step' the conditions visible in the real world (Karl Marx, Capital, vol. iii, p. 38). A less obvious but no less pertinent example is the Marxian theory of history. Here in sharp contrast to the non-theoretical approach of Veblen, Malthus, and the institutionalists, he does not seek the element which best explains 'things as they are' but the element which explains changes. This he regarded-wrongly or correctly is irrelevant for this argument-as the economic element. This did not say, as so many interpreters have misunderstood, that the economic element best explains why things have come to be what they are. It says rather that the economic element is a 'leading indicator' of change. In parallel fashion, modern marginalist economics is intended to make 'predictions about the consequences of . .. change' (Milton Friedman, Essays in Positive Economics, p. 4). It might well be that a businessman does not maximize profits-he may employ incompetent relatives in preference to more efficient strangers-but the practical question which the economist asks is, what will be his reactions to a change in the data, e.g. a large increase in wage rates. There is nothing mysterious in the belief that an employer with a front office filled with his relatives will nevertheless automate the production line when assemblers' wages pass a certain point. 1 For example, The Place of Science in Modern Civilization, p. 178. 2 Theory of the Leisure Class, pp. 47, 114; Absentee Ownership, pp. 114, 130.</page><page sequence="19">T. SOWELL 195 Again Veblen went beyond what was logically required by his basic premiss, and latter-day institutionalism followed him. Marx once more serves as a convenient benchmark, for though he was also a critic of both capitalist society and orthodox economics, he took no such anti-theoretical position against conceptions which ran counter to the economic subject's own perceptions. For Marx abstraction was the essence of science: ' . . . all science would be superfluous, if the appearance, the form and the nature of things were wholly identical '' It was not merely pointless but misleading to concentrate on the individual agent's modus operandi: 'For what each individual wills is obstructed by everyone else, and what emerges is some- thing that no one willed.'2 Since an instrumental theory is meant to pre- dict 'what emerges', it cannot proceed simply by aggregating or averaging the perceptions of the actors in the drama, but only by seeking to con- struct the constraining relationships which lead their mutual pulling and tugging to produce one result rather than another. In short, the institu- tionalist position seems less traceable to their role of iconoclasts than to methodological naivete'. Malthus, who was not an iconoclast or critic of the established order, but who shared many of the institutionalists' methodo- logical confusions, also argued for an approach which would 'account for things as they are .3 Among the positive accomplishments of the institutionalists must be counted much empirical work in a variety of fields. Some of it may have been an aimless agglomeration of facts, serving merely as a stage back- drop for ad hoc assertions, but at its best-in some of the works of Wesley Mitchell and J. M. Clark-important empirical generalizations were estab- lished which were valuable in themselves as well as providing the building blocks for more elaborate or systematic theories. While this aspect of institutionalism is considerably removed from Veblen's usual practices, his role in it cannot be assumed to have been negligible. Veblen argued the need for such work as a necessary preliminary to the theoretical advance- ment of economics, in terms surprisingly similar to those later used by Milton Friedman.4 He saw the immediate advance of economics to lie along the lines of 'monographic' work rather than a 'compendious system of economic theory at large'.5 An early empirical study by Veblen may even have pointed the way; it was a model of the approach and style that 1 Karl Marx, Capital, vol. iii, p. 951; also Marx and Engels, Selected Correspondence, p. 247. 2 Ibid., p. 476. 3 T.

Perhaps the greatest negative effect of institutionalism was its view of theory as a collection of suppositions rather than a set of analytical tech- niques. Mere disagreement with particular theories or opposition to theory in general would have done far less damage than their misconstruing the purpose of theory. Again, Malthus anticipated this tendency.2 In assessing Veblen's role and impact as an economist, it is necessary to note, in addition to his own developed theories and his influence via the institutional school, the embryonic anticipations of later economic doc- trines which are scattered through his writings. While some of these Veblenite beginnings were later elaborated by economists with institu- tionalist leanings, it would be futile to try to determine whether they were inspired directly by Veblen or developed such notions independently. Among the latter concepts found in Veblen are the uncertainty theory of profits,3 the separation of corporate ownership and control (with its be- havioural consequences),4 the concept (or cliche) of 'conventional wis- dom ',5 and the monopolistic competition situation of above-competitive prices but only normal profits in markets served by excessive numbers of firms.6 In the latter case, he was explicitly conscious of breaking new ground: Neither the causes nor the effects of this state of things have been expounded by the economists, nor has it found a place in the many formulations of theory that have to do with retail trade . . .7 V. Summary and conclusions Veblen's attacks on orthodox economic theory were attacks on what these theories were trying to do, not on how well they did it. The methods of these theories-particularly their 'unrealistic' assumptions about human motivations-were rejected as unsuitable for what Veblen wished to do, not as defective for their own purposes. While what was attacked was a limitation rather than a defect,8 Veblen saw that theories can confine men s efforts to problems lying within their scope or as Marx had said earlier, that men only ask themselves such questions as they are prepared to answer.9 The importance of this point has been amply demonstrated 1 Thorstein Veblen, 'The price of wheat since 1867', Journal of Political Economy, vol. i, no. 1 (Dec. 1892), pp. 68-103. 2 For example his criticism of Ricardo's 'natural' rate of wages.

SOWELL 197 by some mathematical economists who ignore factors which do not lend themselves to mathematical treatment, even where these factors may be decisive for the problem at hand. Veblen differed from later institutionalists in trying to explain the development of social ideas under changing economic conditions, rather than describe the mechanics of economic organizations or amass facts about economy. He differed from them also in rejecting the concept of a policy-oriented economics. Veblen and the later institutionalists were similar in proceeding intuitively and with little regard to making their theories empirically verifiable. It was not that he or they did not have the facts, but that they simply did not use the facts in this way. They similarly judged others' ideas in terms of plausibility or as being 'modern' or 'out- mnoded'. Perhaps more than anything else, they spread the misconcep- tion that traditional economic theory was a collection of ready-made answers rather than a method by which relevant questions could be asked and the results systematically tested. Malthus and Marx serve as convenient benchmarks for judging whether particular institutionalist doctrines seem to derive more from their social philosophy or their methodological premisses. While Malthus did not share the Veblenian hostility to capitalism and laissez-faire economics, he was in agreement with the institutionalists repeatedly on points where Marx was opposed. These were almost invariably points involving theo- retical insight and analytical grasp. Malthus was more institutionalist than Veblen in judging the scientific nature of economics by the certainty of its results rather than the logic of its methods.' It is difficult to assess the impact of Veblen either on institutionalism or on the development of economics in general. The diffuseness of post- Veblenian institutionalism has frequently been commented upon: '. everyone who participated in the "revolt" ... filled in the blanks left by its essentially negative criticism with a positive program of his own . There have been no Veblenians in the sense in which there have been Keynesians or Marshallians. Yet many of the attitudes, conceptions, and tactics of Veblen-whether they originated with him or not-have per- sisted and persist still. It would be charitable to believe that the development of modern econo- mic theory was improved by the need to meet the running criticism it 1 T. R. Malthus, Principles of Political Economny, pp. 432, 434. Ricardo saw Malthus's pronouncement that economics was not an exact science as an excuse for intellectual sloppi- ness: '. . .

But it seems at least equally likely that theorists were made more heedless of all criticism by the puerility of much criticism which came from the institutionalist quarter. Nor can it even be claimed that institutionalists made economics more consciously or explicitly aware of its unrealistic abstractions. John Bates Clark, who epitomized the neoclassical approach so hated by institutionalists, had pointed out the unrealism of his own assumption before Veblen's first book appeared,' and even Ricardo had distinguished the analytically 'normal' from the empirically usual in an earlier era.2 Veblen at least saw that un- realism alone was not enough to discredit a theory; later institutionalists seemed to think their work completed when they had showed empirical exceptions to theoretical premisses. Veblen's ventures into technical economics added little to his stature, though he made some suggestive beginning anticipating later work by others. However one might weigh his positive and negative elements, it is clear that Veblen can neither be dismissed nor classed among the immortals. Perhaps the most enduring claim that can be made for him is that he was one of the pioneering minds who questioned the accepted methods and explored new pathways. Since new truths and insights, like precious metals, are products of a process which necessarily includes many fruitless searches, the valuable discoveries which are made cannot be ascribed solely to those who actually make them but must in some uncertain degree be attributed also to those who pour their efforts into the search. As Veblen himself said: The well-worn paths are easy to follow and lead into good company. Advance along them visibly furthers the accredited work which the science has in hand. Divergence from the paths means tentative work, which is necessarily slow and frag- mentary and of uncertain value.3 Cornell University I John Bates Clark, The Distribution of Wealth (New York, 1956 [originally 1898]), p. 77. 2 The Works and Correspondence of David Ricardo, vol. ii, p. 227; ibid., vol. i, pp. 94-95. 3 The Place of Science in Modern Civilization, p. 79.</page></plain_text>
