<plain_text><page sequence="1">Asia Journal, Volume 2, Number 1 (1995) BUDDHIST CULTURE OF ASAKUSA KANNON IN EDO Nam-lin Hur The University of British Columbia Introduction Conventional scholarship on Japanese Buddhism has been concerned mostly with textual studies that focus on the works of major figures such as Kûkai, Saichô, Hônen, Nichiren, Sinran, Dôgen, Ippen, and so on, and to a lesser extent with sectarian chronology and institutional history. We have more than ten thousand articles on Shinran. Under the dominance of textual studies, so-called Kamakura Buddhism occupies too much, and Buddhism in the Edo period represents too little, for Suzuki Shôzan, Jiun, Hakuin, and a handful of other figures are by any measure incomparable to the great teachers of Kamakura Buddhism. Kamakura Buddhism, however, is a fiction. The emergence of new religious thought on Buddhism does not necessarily mean the flourishing of Buddhism or Buddhist culture of that kind. In fact, except for the Gozan system of the Rinzai Sect, it was not until the Sengoku period that Kamakura Buddhism began to ground itself in the religious life of the Japanese people. According to one estimate, about 85% of the Buddhist temples in Japan were built between the mid-sixteenth and mid- seventeenth century.1 From the standpoint of the reality of Buddhist culture, new Buddhism in the Kamakura period has been overemphasized and Buddhism in the Edo period has .been seriously under-evaluated. Another reason for the dominance of textual studies dealing with the religious thought of founders of Kamakura Buddhism is probably the existence of material about them that are well preserved and easily available in print. We already have tons of printed material stacked in the library, but many historians estimate that those materials would not exceed 5% of the document material preserved at temples, shrines, shôya, and other places. Handwritten material related to Buddhism in the Edo 1 For example, about 85% of the 1,735 temples in Mito-han were built between 1451 and 1663, and over 90% of the 6,008 temples listed in a Jôdo Sect report in 1696 were established since 1501. See respectively, Tamamuro (1977: 8-14) and Takeda (1975: 265-8).</page><page sequence="2">26 NAM-UNHUR period are particularly abundant and contain a wealth of diverse information. Sensôji is a good example not only to demonstrate a cultural reality of Japanese Buddhism but also to suggest a revisionist perspective on Buddhist studies. Two aspects of Sensôji culture were most conspicuously associated with the daily life of Edo residents: Sensôji as a prayer center and Sensôji as a leisure space. Better known as the Asakusa Kannon, for the name of the main statue of Avalokitesvara, Sensôji was the most popular temple in Edo. According to one estimate, visitors to Sensôji in the late Edo period numbered more than ten thousand a day in fine weather and not fewer than three or four thousand on rainy days (Nomura 1958: 193-4). The high popularity of Sensôji, however, does not mean that Sensôji culture was an exceptional case. There were many Sensôji in the Edo period in terms of similar cultural features and popularity. Asakusa Kannon and Popular Prayers The focal point of prayer at Sensôji was Asakusa Kannon, a two-inch tall Avalokitesvara statue that has been kept secret in a sealed container in the Main Hall. Buddhas and Bodhisattvas we know in the Buddhist canon are universal in their compassion to their believers. Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, one of the most popular Buddhist deities in Japan, is no exception. The twenty-fifth chapter of the Lotus Sutra of Kumarajiva translation explicitly sets forth the universal compassion of Avalokitesvara and the easy access to it. According to the Lotus Sutra, Avalokitesvara saves people from the "seven difficulties" and "three poisons," and grants the "two desires." The way to reach the compassion of Avalokitesvara is the so-called "easy path" that includes reciting the name of, meditating about, and making offerings to Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva. Responding to the invocation of a worshipper, Avalokitesvara will appear in the form most appropriate to that person's situation out of thirty- three forms, and deliver its salvational power. The doctrinal interpretation of the salvational power and the easy path to reach the compassion of Avalokitesvara, however, fall far short of justifying the extraordinarily popular worship toward this particular Asakusa Kannon, more precisely speaking, toward the Asakusa Kannon statue. In fact, interestingly, most of the temples in the Edo period enshrined Kannon statues, but only a few of them attracted popular</page><page sequence="3">BUDDHIST CULTURE OF ASAKUSA KANNON IN EDO 17 worship, and in the Sensôji precinct alone, there were five independent Kannon halls and even right beside the Asakusa Kannon statue were six more Kannon statues positioned shoulder to shoulder. But none of them were comparable by any measure to the tiny Asakusa Kannon statue in worship and in religious power. The Buddhist doctrine neither preaches the partiality of Buddhist deities' compassion nor defines the degree of salvational efficacy that might be different according to the different shape and the size of a statue. There is not even a mention of indispensibility of a statue in invoking a Buddhist deity. The religious faculty of the Asakusa Kannon was, in a word, a product of cultural invention. We can suggest many factors that were involved in the making of Asakusa Kannon: for example, the wide circulation of its chronicle called Sensôji engi, which tells about the legendary discovery of the statue in the Sumida River; the role of the prominent monk Ennin who made the statue a hidden-Buddha; the affiliation of Sensôji with supreme political powers including the Tokugawa family; and Sensôji's geographical location that served as a cultural boundary between inside and outside of Edo and as a symbolic gate called kimon in the cosmology of Edo, defending against evils from outside (Naitô 1987: 82-3). Even though all of these factors had nothing to do with the intrinsic virtues of Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, they contributed to building the reputation of Asakusa Kannon. Japanese people traditionally understood that the power of a deity was felt when the deity manifested itself on the day of worship to a temporarily provided lodging place called yorishiro. A deity was invited to a lodging place, worshipped, and sent back to its permenent residence in its typical tripartite structure. When anthropomorphic Buddhist statues were introduced, Japanese people understood them not as a visual manifestation of Buddhist deities but as the routinized lodging place of those deities, into which local elements such as miraculous stories, religious authority, political power, and cosmology were attached (Itô 1983). The existence of a particular lodging place is indispensible to the manifestation of power of a deity. The statue of Asakusa Kannon as a yorishiro was therefore the religious base on which the extraordinary divinity of Asakusa Kannon was created beyond the general virtues of Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva. Ways in which the divinity of the Asakusa Kannon were created are striking, especially such invented measures as ennichi ("a day for a connection") and kaichô ("to open a curtain"). The idea of connection-day is that if one worships a certain Buddhist deity on its designated</page><page sequence="4">18 NAM-ÜNHUR connection-day, one can acquire far greater religious merit than on ordinary days. In traditional Buddhism, any day on which one pays worship to a Buddhist deity can be one's connection-day, and the religious merit of one's worship service does not vary according to the date. But this idea was transformed in the Edo period in tune with the traditional idea of a worship day called sainichi, the day when a deity was invited to its temporary lodging place, and gradually developed to attract more worshippers to a temple in two ways. One was the multiplication of connection-day from a yearly to a monthly event. The connection-day of Asakusa Kannon were set on the eighteenth day of each month. Sensôji advertised that if one would worship the Asakusa Kannon on this day, one could make hundreds or thousands more merit than on ordinary days. The other was the invention of new quasi-connection day as specially meritorious dates in addition to the regular monthly connection- day.2 One example, the tenth day of the seventh month was Shimanrokusen nichi that literally means 46,000, therefore 46,000 times more merit. On the other hand, kaichô was a dramatic event of exhibiting the hidden statue to the public for a certain period of time, usually 60 to 90 days. This event contributed to a great extent to raising the religious fame of Asakusa Kannon. Kaichô was indeed a unique Japanese phenomenon not found in any other Buddhist culture, possibly evolved from the traditional idea of secrecy of shintai, the body of a deity. By dramatizing, at intervals of several years, the manifestation of Asakusa Kannon in its statue, Sensôji could anticipate an exploding number of visitors and enormous income. It is no doubt that Asakusa Kannon was the axis of Sensôji's religious life, but in the precinct of Sensôji were also enshrined about two hundred other deities of all kinds, Buddhist and Shinto. And some of them sometimes attracted sizable numbers of worshippers, although they were subject to volatile fluctuations in popularity. Those deities that had reputations for relatively specific functions were also created the same way as was the Asakusa Kannon.3 The religious fame of all these local 2 For a list of kudokunichi of Sensôji in the Edo period that attracted worshippers and their religious implications, see Amino (1962: 453-60). 3 Some examples of such local deities and their major functions were: the Nio (the king who holds a vajra) statue of the Niô Gate who grants general wishes, the Old Woman Sarasvati (Rôjo Benzaiten) statue in the Benten Hall as Daibutsusan who brings economic fortune, the Sanzu-no-Kawa Hag statue in the Enma Hall who lessens toothaches and protects children's health, the Fudô (Acalanâtha) statue in the Arazawa Fudô Hall who prevents fire and epidemic disease, the Yakushi (Bhaisajyarâja) statue in the In-Yakushi Hall who cares for all kinds of eye disease, the stone statue of Kume in Kume Heinaibyôe Shrine who has to do with power and marriage, and the smallpox deity of Hôsô Shrine who takes care of smallpox.</page><page sequence="5">BUDDHIST CULTURE OF ASAKUSA KANNON IN EDO 19 deities was short-lived and fluctuated. According to their needs and the fame of deities, worshippers prayed their wishes to them in a faddish manner and then easily abandoned them. A deity's divinity was never an intrinsic attribute but a constructed quality applicable to any object possessing uncommon power. The boom in popular deities and their ups and downs in Sensôji paralleled two major trends of social life in Edo, particularly among the common people: the development of an individualized life style, and the enhancement of an enterprising spirit and social mobility. Edo was a huge consumer city producing opportunities for a better life but at the same time a problematical city, producing endless threats to its residents, such as, epidemics, malnutrition, and fire. The demand for the worldly benefits, called in Japanese genze riyaku, was so high that Edo people freely created the faddish world of popular deities with various functions called hayarigami, and freely "shopped around" among them according to their needs. The everlasting popularity of the Asakusa Kannon was in a sense a routinized hayarigami, standing extraordinarily high in the waxing and waning world of popular deities. In addition to anonymous worshippers who freely visited Sensôji and prayed, there were prayer patron houses called kitó danna whose members enjoyed the priestly role of Sensôji on a contractual basis, that is, ritual performance by Sensôji and the payment of prayer fees by patron houses. According to a survey in the early 1820s, Sensôji claimed over 450 prayer patron houses, including five daimyo families (Matsudaira 1939-42 vol. 2: 212-288). There were various schedules of prayer rituals for prayer patron houses, but the ritual format and formulae were basically the same. Sensôji monks conducted esoteric prayer rituals which were Sensôji' s specialty, either the ritual reciting of the Mahâprajnâpâramitâ Sûtra, called daihannya tendoku, or Avalokitesvara ritual, called Kannonhô, and sent talismans and votive offerings to the patron house. The daihannya tendoku, which featured the recitation of the Mahâprajnâpâramitâ Sûtra, was a traditional ritual for general well-being in the Tendai tradition. The Kannonhô featured a worship service dedicated to Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva and designed to solicit the renowned miraculous power of the Asakusa Kannon. Actually reciting all 600 fascicles of the Mahâprajnâpâramitâ Sûtra is, in a strict reading of Buddhist doctrine, an act of great merit capable of preventing harm and misfortune on the one hand and of bringing protection and peace on the other. But in practice, the ritual was conducted in a manner of imitating recitation. Priests simply repeated the</page><page sequence="6">20 NAM-UNHUR motion of unfolding the accordion-style pages of the Sûtra and then folding them back in place. As many examples show, a high interest in this formalistic daihannya tendoku ritual was not so doctrinal, but rather, to some extent, had to do with the popular understanding of the Sutra's central message, emptiness Cs ûnyatâ), as a metaphor "to empty everything. " This message of emptiness was indeed not so different from the purification ritual called harae that was performed "to purify" the cause of misfortunes and troubles in the traditional Japanese religion (Gorai 1954: 183-5). To empty something malicious was understood as to purify something malicious. Sûnyata was a purificatory power. On the other hand, the Kannonhô ritual of Sensôji had its own particular formula unknown to outsiders due to its esoteric character. The main body of the ritual followed the general format of an esoteric prayer ritual with six stages, into which Sensôji's own characteristic elements of esoteric mantra were incorporated. The ritual was usually completed within an hour, but depending on the seriousness of the purpose, the same procedure was repeated seven or even twenty-one times in order to increase the ritual's religious efficacy. As even today, the level of the miraculous power which a Kannonhô ritual can produce is claimed to increase by the number of recitations of an esoteric mantra (Shioiri 1988: 339), the ritual efficacy of the Sensôji Kannonhô in the Edo period indeed depended on the recitation of Avalokitešvara mantras by a presiding priest. An audience never understood the mystic Avalokitešvara mantra that a presiding priest mumblingly recited, and yet they believed without doubt its mysterious power in invoking Asakusa Kannon. Avalokitešvara mantra was like kotodama, the spirit of language, in an indigenous sense. The prayer patron houses, however, were not concerned with understanding the symbolism or procedure of a prayer ritual, as long as the fame of Sensôji as a prayer temple satisfied them and as far as they received the embodiments of the ritual, that is, talismans called ofuda and votive offerings called kumotsu. People believed that these prayer items carried the supernatural power of deities invoked by a prayer ritual. In order to ensure the protective power of deities, a family carefully put talismans and votive offerings in the Buddhist altar and Shinto altar, or pasted talismans on a pillar of the main entrance. Fámily members also carried amulets called omamori wrapped in a hemp pouch attached to their clothing. Aware of such deep-rooted concern for the efficacy of talismans and votive offerings, Sensôji monks made it a priority of their prayer business to immediately deliver these products to their patron houses.</page><page sequence="7">BUDDHIST CULTURE OFASAKUSA KANNON IN EDO 21 The religious efficacy of a talisman depended on the scale and the number of repetitions of the daihannya tendoku or Kannonhô ritual performances, just as that of the hemp talisman called oonusa of Ise Shrine depended on the number of times a purification ritual was performed (Yabe 1934: 2-23). As a matter of fact, the popular use of talisman in the Edo period owed much to Ise Shrine priests ( oshi ), who distributed to their patrons hemp talismans, an archaic form of talisman bearing the purificatory power of Shinto deities, when collecting the first offering crop. On the other hand, votive offerings, such as, pieces of silk cloth, colored yarn, goose figurines, paper fans, and red and white rice cake wrapped in an oak leaf, were also important items symbolizing the religious power of a prayer ritual (Sensôji 1978 vol. 3: 587, 688; vol. 13: 149). In Buddhist terms, making an offering of material things to Buddhist deities could bring valuable merit, but offered things themselves could not be treated as a religious fetish bearing the meritorious effect of the worship offering. The importance of votive offerings was in fact comparable to that of sacrificial offerings in Shinto called mitegura or shinsen, with which worshippers had a communal meal called naorai after a worship service and ensured communion with deities (Yanagida 1962-71 vol. 10: 261-84; Tani 1985: 205-35). Interestingly enough, these material products of Sensôji, whether talismans or votive offerings, were the ones that even a daimyo family could not easily afford. When their financial situation was strained, daimyo patron houses sometimes temporarily suspended their contract with Sensôji on the pretext of conforming to sumptuary regulations. Bad crops in their home domain, natural disasters, and even the alternate period of residence in their home domain according to the sankin kôtai system provided good excuses for such suspension (Sensoji 1978. vol. 2: 213, 402- 3, 429; vol. 3: 730; vol. 4: 341). Prayer rituals that were supposed to respond to human predicaments were ironically a luxury, well beyond what regular expenditure could afford. To customers who failed to pay their obligatory fees, Sensôji was never generous enough to confer an extra free ritual service. Markets, Misemono, and Play Two types of market developed over time in the Sensôji area. One was a temporary fair held on special days such as connection-days, Bon matsurì, and the New Year. The other was a permanent street market that formed</page><page sequence="8">22 NAM-UN HUR along the major approaches to the Main Hall and in the spacious inner precinct. The Tôto saijiki of Saitô Gesshin vividly describes the bustling scene of the fair: Not to mention the precinct, the fair stretches to the Komakata Hall in the South, to the Ueno area in the West and to a gravel yard in Yamanojukucho in the East, filling the streets with stall shops which sell decorative items for the New Year, foods for sacrificial offering, worship service equipment, seasonal toys, and gifts. Noisy voices of trade filled the streets throughout days and nights (Saitô 1970 vol. 3: 94). A market and a Buddhist institution look like an odd combination in light of the major function of each: commercial trade versus the promotion of spiritual well-being. But, they were in practice highly dependent on each other for prosperity. Nevertheless, markets in the Sensôji area, temporary or permanent, still maintained some religious residue in terms of the date of a fair and major items for sale, mostly staple products called miyage that were traditionally used as offering objects to deities (Origuchi 1967 vol. 17: 324-7). Moreover, markets formed in a boundary of Edo were a meaningful "other" space that further provided visitors with recreation and entertainment. Surrounded by the expanding commercial zone of market-streets, the inner precinct of Sensôji was a magnetic enclave producing yet another unique culture of its own, and at its very center were misetnono shows featuring the exhibition of wonders and marvels as well as the performance of variety entertainments. Tens of misetnono booths attracted not only worshippers to the Asakusa Kannon but also fun-seekers and idlers from all levels of society. Two groups of lower class entertainers called yashi and gômune rented spaces from Sensôji for weeks or months, set up temporary enclosures, and promoted their entertainment business. Any object, whether natural or manufactured, which were marvelous, wondrous, odd, rare, novel, fascinating, and sensational enough to attract a crowd, might be collected and displayed, including even human prodigies, often in combination with displays of unusual skills and capacities. The exhibition of human freaks and deformities was often used as an object lesson for the phenomenon of karmic causation, that says a sinful act in a previous life was responsible for a present deformity. Compared to the exhibition of natural objects in a simple arrangement, that of handiworks called saiku was a creative world of Japanese craftsmanship, often featuring the thematic composition of topics from famous novels and kabuki plays, or miraculous stories of popular deities</page><page sequence="9">BUDDHIST CULTURE OFASAKUSA KANNON IN EDO 23 Examples of Misemono Exhibitions Year Content of Exhibition 1769 A girl with two fingers called kani musume ("a crab girl"); a giant toad. 1813 A karakuri (contraption) doll installed in a pond near the Benten Hall, a spring- driven automaton capable of a limited range of repetitive motions. 1814 A self-boiling pot. 1816 A porcupine. 1819 Bamboo-wicker replicas of birds, beasts, plants, and historical figures by the renowned basketry artisan Ichida Shôshichirô and his disciples; finely detaile ' craftsmanship. 1820 Ten kinds of artisanry, scenic constructs showing the secret life of courtesans, climactic scenes from well-known novels, legendary anecdotes, and historical figures of China and Japan, with splendid ornamental replicas of animals, plants, and landscape, made of straw, bamboo, mother-of-pearl, and papier-mâché. 1835 Artisanry dolls. 1841 Grandiose tableau spectacles - scenes from novels, kabuki favorites, and legends, heroes and deities from China and Japan, and imaginary animals - featuring mother-of-pearl and ceramic craftsmanship, gaily colored and automated in parts. 1847 "A diamond ship" of glass in subtle motions, a work of collaboration by a contraption craftsman and a doll craftsman. 1848 Opening of a four season flower garden. 1855 Living dolls ( iki ningyô) with foreign faces; lifelike effigies of the kabuki actor Ichikawa Danjûrô (1823-1854), who committed suicide, on his way to Paradise. 1862 Models of an open womb during the ten months of pregnancy showing the evolution of a fetus. Examples of Misemono Performances Year Content of Performance 1742 Acrobatic feats of a man-horse by Kirinnosuke. 1769 Acrobatics ( karuwaza ), martial arts, and superhuman muscular skills. 1814 Solution to a riddle ( nazo-toki ) by Shunsetsubô. 1841 Repertoire of nineteen ball-juggling tricks (kyoku-mari) by Kikukawa Kunimaru. 1844 A composite show of top-spinning tricks ( kyoku-gama ), dancing, and misemono exhibition. 1846 Acrobatics, tight-rope walking, and falconry dancing by Yamamoto Kojima and his group. 1851 Repertoire of ten acrobatic feats by the combination of Sakuratsuna Komanori and Hayatake Torakichi. 1953 Equestrian circus. 1855 Acrobatic variety show by Zôkyô and his group. 1862 Repertoire of eleven acrobatic feats by Hayatake Torakichi. and well-known historical or legendary heroes. With the introduction of the ideas and some tools of peep shows called nozoki and contraption dolls called karakuri ningyô, the world of misemono became livelier and more sophisticated, elevating the popular taste of novel delights, but sometimes degenerating into the sensual depiction of pleasure quarters or sex scandals, often tainted with exaggeration and even hoaxes.</page><page sequence="10">24 NAM-UNHUR On the other hand, the performance of variety entertainments offered the viewers a livelier leisure culture. The misemono performances that prospered in the late Edo period showed faddish ups and downs, depending on the popular taste for the ephemeral and sometimes illusory qualities of the show. Acrobatics, top-spinning tricks and ball-juggling formed the core of the popular repertoire among the kaleidoscopic skills of the show, and illusory tricks, martial arts, swordsmanship, equestrian circus, sleights of hand, and muscular skills were often added to complement this repertoire. The ball-juggling called kyoku-mari performance by Kikukawa Kunimaru in 1841, for example, was said to have attracted about five or six thousand spectators a day, and he was paid five gold pieces a day, an unprecedented amount in the entire history of the misemono business (Asakura 1977: 16-21; Furukawa 1982: 35-7). The top-spinning tricks called kyoku-goma were more often used as a prelude to the selling of medications. Among the dozens of yashi families who sold nostrums advertised as family secrets for generations, the Matsui family built an unsurpassable reputation owing to their superb performance of top-spinning tricks generation after generation. In particular, the thirteenth generation Matsui Gensui was so dexterous that he was called from time to time to perform his arts before the shogun and other high government officials on the occasion of their visits to Sensôji (Nishiyama 1983: 101-10). Compared to the one-man show of ball-juggling and top- spinning, acrobatics called karuwaza was basically a team play complemented by tumbling, illusory tricks, dancing, and martial arts. Owing to such a variegated composition, acrobatic shows usually attracted larger audiences, and the admission fee was much more expensive. As a major center of the misemono attraction in Edo, Sensôji helped an urban popular culture boom. The misemono entrepreneur with no religious mission but with its origin in a donation campaign for temples and shrines in the medieval period, called kanjin kôgyô, simply took advantage of the relatively autonomous jurisdiction of Sensôji over its own precinct and the fame of the Asakusa Kannon. To the consciousness of the populace of Edo, the misemono culture was a natural part of Sensôji culture, not because they were conscious of its historical origin, but because it was just there. Beyond the boundary of the misemono culture, Sensôji culture as a sui generis form of Edo religious culture was indeed expanded further into the realm of play represented by more participatory leisure culture. In the precinct of Sensôji, several commercial archery halls, called yôkyûba, prospered, where patrons enjoyed shooting arrows at targets for a</page><page sequence="11">BUDDHIST CULTURE OFASAKUSA KANNON IN EDO 25 few coins. Archery was a divinatory game in Shinto festivals, but gradually evolved into a recreational play in the Edo period. Terakado Seiken described in the Sensôji chapter of his Edo hanjôki, "A girl runs an archery hall; charmingly made up and beautifully dressed, she flirts and lures customers" (Terakado 1974 vol. 1: 64). The real joy of archery, however, lay in being served by and viewing attendant girls rather than in hitting the target with arrows. These young maids, called yatori-onna or yaba-onna, served customers by beating a drum when an arrow struck the target's bull's-eye or by collecting scattered arrows, but their real job was to lure as many customers as they possibly could. Among businesses run in the precinct of Sensôji, those that most depended on the role of women were teahouses called mizuchaya. Since the famous "twenty teahouses" were established in Sensôji in the mid- eighteenth century, the number of teahouses in the precinct of Sensôji continued to increase to over one hundred by the early nineteenh century (Matsudaira 1939-42 vol. 2: 574-92). Most of the teahouses employed young and attractive draw girls called oyakumi-onna, and let them serve customers in order to survive the fierce competition of the mizuchaya business. On the other hand, the exclusively male clientele could take a rest and sip a cup of tea, while viewing these girls in their best embellishment of make-up and dress. It was natural that the pornographic teahouse culture of Sensôji gave birth to legendary belles, such as, Okita and Oroku, whose beauty dominated the gossip of Edo people (Komori 1984: 256-8). While voyeurism was itself a major force propelling the mizuchaya business in the late Edo period, their services also extended to prostitution carried out in the rear room attached to the teahouse's main hall. Many sources satirically depicted oyakumi-onna in their "business of love," so prostitution in the teahouses must have been quite prevalent. But the government's attitudes toward degenerate activities in the public area were ambivalent; sometimes prohibiting, and sometimes promoting, in order to develop the front village of a temple or shrine called monzenmachi. For example, in order to attract businesses and tourists to the new monzenmachi Otowa of Gokokuji, which was constructed by the donation of Keishôin, the mother of Shogun Tsunayoshi, in 1681, the shogunate basically gave tacit approval to private prostitution at mizuchaya in the area (Hiranuma 1957: 63-87). The role of women was not confined to archery halls or teahouses. Yôji- mise in the precinct of Sensôji, which sold toothpicks, dentifrice, and beans for pigeons, also employed attractive sales girls. What sources describe as</page><page sequence="12">26 NAM-UNHUR the smiling welcome of these sales girls added further attraction to the roughly two hundred incredibly crowded yôji-mise which were already by themselves an attraction of Sensôji (Matsudaira 1939-42 vol. 1: 346-56). Like those in archery halls or teahouses, yôji-mise women selling miscellanies in the precinct of Sensôji sometimes sold themselves. It is quite striking that prostitution was widely practiced in the precinct of Sensôji in the Edo period, but that was not an exceptional phenomenon confined only to Sensôji. Temples and shrines famous for pilgrimage or popular worship, such as, Zenkôji of Shinano, Ise Shrine, Narita Shinshôji, Konpira of Sanuki, Usa-Hachiman Shrine of Buzen, and so on, were all hotbeds of entertainment, whether in the precincts or in the front village. Even though it reached an unprecedented high pitch in the late Edo period, prostitution associated with religious institutions was not so strange in light of the cultural heritage of itinerant female priests, such as, shamanesses, Kumano nuns, puppeteer-prayer nuns, blind street diviners, and fish-peddler nuns who occasionally practiced prostitution (Amino 1984: 172-200; Gorai 1982 vol. 2: 103-36). Moreover, Sensôji was in a favorable location for the prostitution business owing to several factors: the nearby post station Senjushuku, market streets in its own monzenmachi, and especially the neighboring licensed pleasure quarters of Yoshiwara. When Yoshiwara suffered a fire and had to stop its business for some time while repairing or rebuilding, Yoshiwara prostitutes sneaked to the Sensôji area owing to the protective shield of Sensôji and its crowds, continuing their business there as "secret prostitutes" called kakushi-baita (Sensôji 1978 vol. 3: 318-20; vol. 5: 164-6; vol. 7: 271; vol. 9: 87-8; vol. 12: 368; vol. 13: 131, 164, 248-9). The Sensôji administration tacitly permitted them to do their temporary business in its own backyard or front village, as long as the shogunate did not impose a strict ban. Sensôji's tolerance, which was always strongly supported by monzenmachi residents, stemmed not from an interest in collecting rent income from secret prostitutes, but rather from its indifference to prostitution itself. Indeed, the Sensôji administration did not deal with the prostitution problem on the basis of the norm of the Buddhist sangha. Even under the most lax standards of Buddhist doctrine, permitting the business of prostitution in the precinct of a temple was absolutely unthinkable, but in fact not only lay people but also lifetime practitioners of Buddhist norms and ideals were basically immune to such strictures in the Edo period. In their vinaya-blind consciousness, there was no contradiction between Buddhist life in the sangha and prostitution in the Buddhist temple. Whether it degenerated or not, the culture of play that was incubated in</page><page sequence="13">BUDDHIST CULTURE OFASAKUSA KANNON IN EDO 27 the womb of religion and raised in the Edo society was a reality of the Edo Buddhist culture, and furthermore a vital part of it. Together with the market-streets and the misemono attractions, it provided a potential resource which Sensôji could capitalize on. For Edo people, the Sensoji amusement quarters was a public space of between and betwixt where the stakes of freedom, peace, relaxation, and entertainment ran high. Conclusion Edo, with a population of over one million, was a vast consumer city that simply needed space for recreation and entertainment. In particular, the townsmen living in the crowded space and struggling daily for survival were desperate for supernatural beings to make wishes to and thirsty for places in which to rest themselves. Moreover, life in an impersonal and forbidding city, where the production of necessities like food, clothing and shelter was out of their hands, might have made them feel helpless and uncertain. Beyond merely being condoled or entertaining themselves, they indeed should have been regenerated. The approximately one thousand temples located in the spacious outskirts of Edo were, not only the best places for fresh air and relaxing occasions, but also symbolic space for regeneration. The periphery of the shogunal castle-town dotted with temples was, in a sense, a world of dream, liberation, anti-order, the otherworld, and communitas, in contrast to the stage of daily life in the inner city subject to reality, subordination, order, and disparity. Edo residents who were exhausted in their daily struggle enthusiastically sought pious rituals, recreational carnivals, entertainment orgies, equality, anti-order, and liberation in these protected areas, thereby recharging their spirit and body. Sensôji, as a center for prayer and play, provided Edo residents with popular culture for daily consumption, even if not so creative as it might have been. References Amino Aritoshi. 1962.
