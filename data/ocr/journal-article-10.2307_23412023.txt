<plain_text><page sequence="1">Kapkap: The Art of Connecting in Island Melanesia1 Graeme Were NS vol 1. 2006 27 Kapkap: The Art of Connecting in Island Melanesia' by Graeme Were Graeme Were, University College London European traders, explorers and missionaries sailing around island Melanesia in the late nineteenth centu ry often made sightings of a patterned shell valuable worn round the neck or on the forehead of high rank ing persons throughout the region (Brenchley 1873, Codrington 1891, Parkinson 1907). Moseley's (1877) notes during the Challenger expedition are typical for their appreciation of the object as they are is for their lack of insightfulness. A still more remarkable appreciation of symmetry and fertility in design is shown in the patterns which are cut upon the circular plates worn sometimes on the forehead, oftener on the breast. These consist of circular white plates ground down out of Tridacna shell, with a hole in the centre for suspension. On the front of this white ground is fastened a thin plate of tortoise-shell, which is ornamented with fretwork, so that the white ground shows through the aper tures. The patterns are of endless variety, 'no two being alike', and show all kinds of combinations of circles, triangles, toothing, radiate patterns, &amp; c. The shell background is often graved also at its margin. Symmetry is evidently striven after, but with the appliances available the execution falls short here and there of the design. Nevertheless these orna ments are very beautiful. (Moseley 1877:410) Similar turtle-shell patterns appear throughout island Melanesia extending from the Admiralty Islands to New Ireland, Bougainville and as far as the Solomon Islands. Known by the pidgin term kapkap, its provocative nature - its visual effect, its symmetry, and its preva Figure 1. Silas Manisaup wearing kapkap. northern New Ireland. (Photo: Graeme Were. 2000).

Museums and private collectors amassed collections most likely because of their portability, but also because of their obvious decorative appeal and resemblance to a medal. Such was the interest that a collection at the Australian Museum was boxed as 'native curios' and loaded aboard M.V. Neptuna in November 1937, shipped for display at the 150m Anniversary Exhibition in Sydney. Missionaries assembled their own collections as Melanesians gave up their kapkaps as an indication of their faith in Christianity. The collector, Beatrice Blackwood, whose collection of kapkaps is also housed at the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford notes: These ornaments seem to have come under the special displeasure of the missionaries, probably owing to their connexion with ceremonies and fighting, and it is almost certain that their manufac ture will shortly cease altogether. Several specimens in my collection were obtained because the owners had discarded them as belonging to the olden times. (1935:422 - 423) Although well represented in museum collections and catalogues, there has been little meaningful analysis of the kapkap. Museum displays label the kapkap as a 'body decoration' that is 'worn after initi ation' or simply as a 'clan badge.' Further ethnograph ic details are scarce, a fact that at first seems para doxical, especially considering the prominence of kapkaps in museum collections (Fig. 1). Yet given the circumstances of European - Melanesian relations in the late 19th and early 20th century, collectors of kapkaps may be forgiven for acquiring so little ethnographic data. We do know that kapkaps were only revealed at times of high sociality: at mortuary feasts, during warfare or possibly when meeting visiting Europeans, before being hid den away again afterwards. Encounters between Melanesians and Europeans were not always amica ble, and trading was often only chanced by anchor ing close enough to the coast for locals to paddle out by canoe to exchange food and goods (Thomas 2000:275). Many Europeans dreaded setting foot on the beaches of island Melanesia, fearing attack. Hence it is wholly understandable that Europeans would probably have acquired kapkaps without stay ing long enough to collect any information. In this paper, I want to re-examine the kapkap ana its patterns. By drawing on examples in museum col lections around the world as well as field research in northern New Ireland, I want to show that the identifi cation of pattern with island group reflects a misguid ed Western concern to classify according to differ ence alone. Instead, I suggest that by focusing in on the similarities between various kapkaps and their patterns, we can learn how minute variations in the style of kapkaps may communicate social and histori cal ideas in the region, thus enabling us to perceive the kapkap as a vehicle to connect island groups. Kapkaps in Island Melanesia Ever since the first museum collections of Pacific art where amassed, Westerners have obsessively tried to arrange particular kapkaps into discreet island groups according to their patterns, as McCarthy (1946) did in his survey of the collection of kapkaps at the Australian Museum. Many kapkaps, however, do not fall easily into one island group or other, as muse um records clearly indicate. The designs are based on concentric circles with arrangements of zigzags, tri angles, diamonas and tooth-edge designs cut into the turtle-shell which vary from one kapkap to another so much that kapkaps appear the same but minutely different throughout the region. In effect, there is no clearly definable regional system of style - no definite 'New Ireland' or'Bougainville' kapkap - but instead, there exists a broad overlap of stylistic features that extend beyond boundaries between adjacent island groupings. Considering that a healthy trade in shell valuables has existed throughout New Ireland, the Admiralty Islands, Bougainville and the Solomon Islands, and trade journeys were made between many of the islands in the region (Thomas 1991, Reichard 1933, Spriggs 1997), the fact there are stylistic similarities is not that surprising (Fig. 2).</page><page sequence="3">Figure 2. Map of island Melanesia indicating islands of kapkap manufacture NS vol I. 2006 29 In order to try to understand the prevalence of the kapkap in island Melanesia, and the stylistic coher ence of the patterns, we can begin by exploring museum collections from the region. These indicate that there were several areas of kapkap production in island Melanesia and as previous analyses point out, there is a limited array of stylistic features that give clues as to their original provenance. Stylistic Features of the Solomon Islands Kapkap Solomon Islands kapkaps (Fig. 3) share their stylistic composition with many other kapkap designs from the islands region, though they are larger than most, measuring on average around 110 millimetres in diameter. The turtle-shell pattern is based on a series of concentric bands that emanate out from a central motif that resembles a flower or star. Finely cut trian gles, lines, crosses and tooth-edge motifs are aligned and repeated in radial fashion inside the concentric bands. One example of a specific design feature found in the Solomon Islands shell valuable is the so called U-motif or 'bonito dorsal fin' motif, named by Joyce (1935), a feature that distinguishes it from other kapkaps in island Melanesia. Anthropomorphic designs, fish and bird motifs are also present on a number from the Solomon Islands. Arguably the most intricately carved in the Pacific, the Solomon Islands kapkap was worn on the front or side of the head, on a plaited band or cord (see front cover, Burt 1981). Some of the straps that fasten it to the forehead are adorned with shell decorations, while several of the turtle-shell overlays are attached through the central hole with colored beads wound through them. Information is scarce relating to these kapkaps; how ever, Waite suggests that the anthropomorphic designs in turtle-shell could correlate to headhunting (1983:123). In a survey of 32 Solomon Islands kapkaps with anthropomorphic patterns, Schuster hypothesizes that the repetition of the anthropomorphic figures can be best understood as genealogies; the anthropo morphic motifs are 'a representation of the tribal soci ety conceived as an endless succession of individu als' (Schuster 1964:225). He refers to the kapkap as an emblem of tribal identity, reserved for high-ranking persons or proven warriors, whereas Burt (1990) treats the Kwara'ae kapkap of Malaita as an heirloom, inherited by priests as a mark of rank. Stylistic Features of the Bougainville Kapkap The Bougainvillean kapkap (Fig. 4) is very similar to other kapkaps in size, measuring from between 40 millimetres in diameter to around 100 millimetres. Stylistically too, it bears remarkable resemblance to its New Ireland neighbours, with the patterns exhibiting a large central motif surrounded by a series of concen tric circles. Within the circles, rows of geometric designs of triangles, circles and zigzags are aligned. At the centre of the turtle-shell pattern, most Bougainvillean kapkaps have a large star or cross motif. In a fashion similar to the Solomon Islands kap kap, some patterns have anthropomorphic figures radiating from the central motif while others depict shark motifs. Museum documentation at the Pitt Rivers Museum states that the kapkap is worn around the neck while feasting or fighting. A local term, pirir, is used to refer to the kapkap, while the terms 'unah' and 'hatubu' describe the turtle-shell and clamshell respectively. Stylistic Features of the New Ireland Kapkap The New Ireland kapkap (Fig. 1) bears remarkable Figure 2. Map of island Melanesia indicating islands of kapkap manufacture</page><page sequence="4">CL 30 NS vol 1. 2006 resemblance in size and style to other kapkaps in island Melanesia. Based on a series of concentric cir cles, the turtle-shell fretwork includes triangles, circles and zigzags. In the centre of a pattern lies a large star or cross motif, typically with four points around which the geometric designs radiate. New Ireland kapkaps range in size from 35 to around 130 millimetres in diameter and possess a turtle-shell overlay that does not extensively cover the clamshell disc beneath - a distinguishing feature for some of the New Ireland kapkaps. The stylistic features of the New Ireland kapkap appear to permeate the outer islands of New Ireland including New Hanover, St. Mathias Islands, the Tabar Island grouping, the Lihir Island group, and Nissan Island, where collections of kapkaps exist. In all these provenances, the style of the kapkap pattern remains uniform. In a few cases, museum collections docu ment a movement of kapkaps between islands so allowing us to discern the role of outlying islands such as Simberi in the Tabar Islands as focal point for trad ing activity. According to museum labels attached to some New Ireland kapkaps in the Field Museum in Chicago, Simberi Island in the Tabar Island grouping was the chief centre of manufacture for kapkaps and played a pivotal role in their trading.2 Carvers from Simberi may have been especially renowned, and therefore commissioned by clans. There is, however, a stylistic feature of kapkaps col lected from New Hanover that appears to be specific to this island. Here, the pattern differs in the applica tion of motifs; it exhibits a large central cross motif sur rounded by concentric circles. But in contrast to other patterns in the Bismarck Archipelago, there are no motifs inside the circles and the pattern is composed only of straight lines and circles. The kapkap is smaller in size to its New Ireland neighbours but still maintains the characteristic clamshell disc covered by turtle shell fretwork. Stylistic Features of the Admiralty Islands Kapkap The Admiralty Islands kapkap (Fig. 5) measures from Figure 3. Solomon Islands kapkap. (Illustration by Rebecca Jewell, 1998). 30 to around 130 millimetres in diameter. Many kap kaps share characteristics from other parts of island Melanesia, including the use of zigzag, triangle, tooth edge and cross designs. However, there are some fea tures that distinguish several of them from other kap kaps in the islands region. One of the most noticeable is a dark chevron motif incised in a single row around the circumference of the clamshell disc. Another dis tinguishing feature is the symmetry of the pattern: the turtle-shell pattern unique to this region is based on a radial treatment of motif that divides the pattern into four quadrants of equal size. A large number of motifs are incorporated into these patterns that are repeat ed in each sector, running from the centre to the cir cumference of the pattern as well as around the edges. Motifs include lozenge-shaped designs, trian gular shapes, crescents and tooth-edge motifs, which are also used on other material artefacts of the region, such as wooden ceremonial bowls and gourd pots. There is little information on their use in this region except that they are worn as either breast or head ornaments hung from string or a length of beads (Ohnemus 1996:54-57; Rose 1980:251). Museum Collections and Documentation While this outline of stylistic variation pinpoints some distinguishing features of kapkaps, many kapkaps in collections resist this process of classification by differ Figure 3.

(Illustration by Rebecca Jewell, 1998). ence. Retrospective labelling, bad documentation, trading and muddling by art dealers has compound ed the problem of designating provenance, meaning that the place of origin for many kapkaps is almost impossible to specify. Conflicting opinions between collector, dealer and curator hamper accurate docu mentation of museum collections. For instance, docu mentation at the Staatliches Museum fûr Vôlkerkunde in Dresden, Germany, reveals that someone retrospec tively re-labelled the provenance of an Admiralty Islands kapkap collected in 1902 believing that it was from New Ireland. Another kapkap in the Horniman Museum, London, has two different island prove nances written on the reverse of the clamshell disc ('New Britain' and 'New Ireland') and to confuse things further, 'Santa Cruz' is written on the catalogue card as provenance. Gladys Reichard's classic 1933 study of wood and turtle-shell carving in Melanesia epitomizes the Western concern to identify local styles. Influenced by diffusionist ideas, she provides an excellent compara tive survey of kapkaps from across the region with its attentive detail to draw out differences in style between, say, New Ireland and the Solomon Islands. Reichard clearly acknowledges that the provenance indicated by museum records is problematic (1933:8,88). She states that in order to carry out her analysis of over 300 kapkaps residing in Western museums she did not rely on museum documenta tion: 'Except in a few cases their true provenience (sic) is as clearly marked by the style as if it were written on them' (1933:88). In fact, Reichard states that in most cases she dispenses with the original museum docu mentation calling the accompanying data of 'pseu do-provenance' (1933:8). Indeed, she irons out varia tions in the style of kapkap patterns by putting intra regional differences down to trade or bad documen tation, blaming the latter on collectors, whalers and sea captains who 'could hardly expect... to know the difference between the Solomon and New Ireland treatment of line, or the use of triangles in the Carolines and in New Britain' (1933:8). In rejecting all documentation, she relies on her own ideas of what style originally constituted in the island groups where kapkaps were manufactured. Reichard goes on to say that Pacific art dealers were renowned for pick-and-mixing turtle-shell patterns with clamshell discs so as to get the best looking kapkaps for sale to Western collectors (1933:91). If her insights are correct and kapkaps have been tampered with to suit Western aesthetic preferences, then the prove nance of kapkaps bought from Pacific art dealers must be as dubious as their documentation. This brief stylistic survey demonstrates how any analysis needs more careful attention if we are to understand the prevalence of the kapkap in island Melanesia. In acknowledging that our stylistic assess ment of all of the kapkaps from island Melanesia indi Figure 4. Bougainvillean kapkap. (Illustration by Rebecca Jewell. 1998). Figure 5. Admiralty Islands kapkap. (Illustration by Rebecca Jewell, 1998).</page><page sequence="6">32 NS vol 1. 2006 cates a coherence in formal properties that limits any radical form of innovation - since we know that all of the kapkaps came from this region - then it becomes clear that the entire corpus of kapkaps is composed of a series of minute stylistic variations which is the aggregate of all individual styles (compare with Gell's 1998 analysis of Marguesan art). These variations are achieved by incorporating an array of designs, such as zigzags, triangles, and tooth-edging, some of which appear throughout the region while others - such as Joyce's 'bonito fin' motif - are concentrated around specific island groupings. In other words, all of the kapkaps in museum collections are recognisable as coming from island Melanesia and come together as a coherent regional style. In light of this, it would be difficult to deny that the system for creating minute variations in the turtle-shell pattern for the 'collective' art style is comparable to, though not the same as, the system for creating minute variations in pattern for the individual art style. Given that the kapkap is an object of power and prestige across island Melanesia and that the region experienced similar social, politi cal and historical constraints, let us now turn to the kapkap in northern New Ireland to explore the work ings of the pattern further. The Kapkap in Northern New Ireland The New Ireland kapkap is regarded as a symbol of clan strength that harbours protective powers to ward off malevolent spirits. When warfare was endemic to northern New Ireland, the warrior chief (lavanabina) earned the right to wear a kapkap, but nowadays, it is only clan leaders (ma/ma/) who have the right to wear one. Status is achieved in New Ireland, so to become a maimai, a person - usually a male - must show positive leadership gualities and the willingness to learn traditional knowledge. Once these character istics are recognised, the maimai is initiated on top of a wooden platform at a mortuary feast where he receives his kapkap from a land-holding clan (Fig. 6). The maimai can only be initiated and thereby receive his kapkap during a mortuary feast organized on the land of a clan presenting the kapkap. In achieving the status of maimai, the role entitles the person to adjudicate in disputes - usually in matters over land and fishing - and act as an authority in traditional law. A maimai may also act as spokesperson for a clan at a mortuary feast to announce an exchange on behalf of a clan or orchestrate the ritual proceedings, if acting for the land-holding clan. A maimai may in fact speak for any number of clans so long as there exists a history of exchange relations between the clan of the maimai and the nominating clan; however, this process may take many years to achieve with only a few maimai acguiring more than two clan titles. Once initiated, a maimai can speak in all the places belonging to a clan whose rights he has just acquired. As a maimai is initiated as speaker for more and more clans, he can impress his pres ence in wider social circles, projecting his name and influence beyond his own natal village. So for exam ple, a maimai from the east coast of northern New Ireland may acquire the rights to speak in a village hamlet on the island of Simberi in the Tabar group due to a history of exchange relations forged in the past by his ancestors. This accumulation of rights to speak on behalf of different clans entails an increase in the status and power of the maimai, and at the same time, signals the public display of a kapkap in ever-wider social circles as it is revealed at mortuary feasts. The design of the turtle-shell pattern dynamically changes with a wearer's acquisition of status. As a maimai acquires more rights, the kapkap is recarved to reflect the higher status. The size of the clamshell disc and the number of concentric bands on the tur tle-shell pattern are indicative of the number of clans the wearer can speak for. Hence, a maimai's first kap kap has one circular band of radial geometric pat terns. Three concentric bands indicate the power to speak for three clans. The resulting effect is that the kapkap increases with size as more status is gained which means that he may speak in a wider social sphere, thus extending his renown to other villages</page><page sequence="7">NS vol 1. 2006 33 outside his own hamlet. Due to the labour involved, a clamshell disc is not always produced each time a maimai receives a clan title, but exchanged instead. The making of a clamshell disc is secretly performed by a group of men. A giant clam is brought ashore from the reef, baked in a stone oven, which enables it to be broken up into smaller pieces, the flattest part of the shell being used for the disc. Now begins the laborious part: gathered together, the men grind down the bro ken clamshell using an obsidian grinding stone with a small well in the center. Water is poured into the well while the men take turns to grind the clamshell disc until it is smooth, a process that may take up to two months. The cutting of the turtle-shell is commissioned by a land-holding clan organizing a mortuary feast. Clansmen go out to sea and catch a turtle, which is left in the sun turned upside-down until it dies before the ventral plate is removed. The turtle-shell is then baked in a stone oven, making it soft and malleable and easy to work. Once ready, the kapkap carver receives the turtle-shell plate. The maimai of the com missioning clan visits the kapkap carver and describes the design of the kapkap pattern to him. After the pattern is described, the carver goes off into the forest collecting aromatic leaves and wrapping them up into a small leaf package. Under the dark ness of night, he goes to the beach and finds a small crab hole in the sand where he places the leaf pack age in the hole, concealing it with sand before he then returns home to sleep. While sleeping, a maselai, a clan spirit, comes into the carver's house and whis pers into his ear a description of the image, which is manifested as a dream (mirifdaai). Early in the morn ing at sunrise, the carver goes down to the beach again and finds the crab hole uncovered. On seeing this, he then summons help from the ancestral spirits in carving the turtle-shell design. The carver constructs a leaf shelter (baakbaak) in which he secludes himself with his tools to complete the task ahead. Here he smoothes down the turtle shell and cuts the geometric designs using a shark's tooth as a knife, though today, steel tools are com monly used. Visitors are not encouraged to visit though young men may pay some shell money to observe and learn, sitting down quietly and watching intently. Any distraction may cause errors, signifying impending misfortune. The generation of these turtle-shell patterns is the result of a long series of initiatives that have devel oped historically, which have given rise to what we understand today as the style to be. The process of carving each new design is a product of a sequence of stylistic decisions that New Ireland carvers take. These decisions - that create coherence and stability in New Ireland art style - are never enacted without the knowledge of their social outcome and the threats that transgression may bring to clan strength. This is why, like all the kapkaps carved in the past and all those to be carved in the future, the pattern is built on concentric circles with geometric designs carved inside. At the centre of the disc is carved a large cross or star, usually with four points, around which concen tric rings of geometric designs radiate, each band denoting the number of clans the maimai can speak for. The number of geometric designs is limited: there is no innovation in the design of the pattern and most incorporate just two or three different geometric designs at most. Minute variations are thus achieved by how many concentric bands are carved and the combination of geometric designs carved into them (such as zigzags, triangles, tooth-edging etc.), enabling New Irelanders to recognise a kapkap as belonging to a particular clan. Failure on behalf of the carver to adhere to strict stipulations on design would thereby render the kapkap useless, as it would no longer harbour the power to protect or act as an emblem of clan strength. The Art of Connecting These 'same but different' ideas carved into turtle shell are also stressed in northern New Ireland society.3 New Irelanders place special emphasis on social dif</page><page sequence="8">Figure 6. A clan leader (malmai) under going kapkap initiation, man at right Luiso Boas, northern New Ireland. (Photo: Graeme Were. 2000). 34 NS vol 1. 2006 ference and this concern is driven by the need to maintain social distance between kin relations, which necessitates avoidance and spatial separation, or ele ments of respect. These principles are enforced so as to avoid possible situations that could shame a per son by coming into contact with opposite sex rela tions. Moreover, as KCichler (2002) points out, like the seasons and landscape in New Ireland, social rela tions are continually transformed through conception, marriage and death. During a person's lifetime, they acquire new relations through marriage, which means that relationships may be transformed from one of friendship or respect to altogether avoidance, as is the case in New Ireland between opposite-sex in-laws. At the same time, New Irelanders are also con cerned with the way social relations bind them togeth er, most spectacularly in performances at mortuary feasts when related clans make competitive exchanges in acknowledgement of their shared links to the past. Mortuary feasts are the culmination of the work for the dead and the time when land transac tions, marriages and exchanges take place, and are therefore considered occasions when clan alliances are renewed. They demonstrate the paradoxical situa tion faced by New Irelanders: a concern for difference (through spatial separation) but at the same time, a concern to maintain close ties (through mutual respect and care for one another). Tensions over managing social distance continually arise. Due to social and historical events in the region, New Irelanders can always trace common ancestors between each other even in settlements some dis tance apart, putting extreme pressure on the way people maintain social distance from one other. This situation arose because New Ireland was once rav aged by fighting, with factions forming alliances to attack or defend settlements belonging to rival groups. Under a regular threat of attack, small groups moved nomadically across the mountains to hide from the fighting and escape death. These social upheavals led to fragmented clan groups which were scattered over the landscape as they were forced to flee into the mountains, create new settlements and forge alliances with other clans. These migrations are still remembered today when alliances are renewed through exchanges of funerary carvings (malanggari), land and marriage partners at mortu ary feasts. Nevertheless, the alliances between clans are under constant strain because of the geography of New Ireland. Due to the steep mountainous interior of the island, there are excessive demands on the use of garden land and living space along the coastal areas. This results with the dominant clans of each set tlement controlling these spaces, which they maintain through exchange partnerships to the detriment of minor clans. Many of the names of the motifs in the kapkap pat terns refer to these historical movements across the landscape. For instance, the zigzag motif may relate to the abandonment of settlements and migration onwards whilst carved straight lines lining concentric circles in the turtle-shell pattern may signify tracks through the mountains. In effect, even though the design of the kapkap pattern is quite arbitrary, a maimai may elicit the events in his clan's history sim ply by holding his kapkap. So in attempting to create new identities out of a common past without forget ting their historical roots, New Irelanders are using the kapkap as a visual means to express both their clan's individual strength as well as their links to their shared Figure 6.

So how do these circumstances relate in a wider sense to the kapkap in island Melanesia? In fact, much of the social and historical background that I have described for New Ireland also pertains to island Melanesia in general. The region suffered warfare within and between islands and alliances were forged in order to maintain stability and safety from attack, just as in New Ireland. In regions where the kapkap was worn, clan leaders like the New Ireland maimai, and warriors seeking to impose their influence in wider social spheres, most probably donned their kapkaps to mark their power. The minute variation in design of the turtle-shell pattern for the kapkaps across island Melanesia suggests a fear of transgress ing the boundaries of style - since a radically new design may not be powerful. At the same time, it reveals a strategy to gain enough leeway through sty listic innovation to have the edge on a rival clan through its claim to harness new sources of power. So it seems plausible to hypothesise that indeed the kapkap not only became a mechanism in which to articulate common links between clans and social groups, but also a device to attain an upper hand against rivals amid a common social and political background in the wider region. This therefore leads me to suggest that the reason why the kapkap is dis played at times of high sociality is because, during war parties, trade journeys or feasting, clan leaders wore their kapkaps on their head or chest as an object of engagement to highlight their relatedness not just to other groups but also to demonstrate their ability to invoke powerful forces. 13 Notes ' This research was kindly funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (1999-2003) and the Emsiie Horniman Scholarship for Anthropological Research.
