<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PHYSIOGNOMY OF BERNINI'S ELEPHANT Avigdor W. G. Poseq Bernini's sculpture of a small elephant bear ing a 5-meter-high Egyptian obelisk en graved with hieroglyphs that was erected in 1667 in the Piazza Minerva in central Rome has been explained as a kind of heraldic emblem (impresa) of the ambitious, erudite Pope Alexander VII Chigi, suggesting that the exotic beast and the pagan pillar sym bolize the scholarly pontiff's yearning for the gift of divine wisdom (Fig. I).1 This sophisticated interpretation of the sculpture is frequently mentioned in Bernini mono graphs.2 But less attention has been paid to the possibility that the elephant may be an idealized portrait. I propose to show that Bernini not only identified the elephant with his august patron, but gave it the typological features of the pope. Bernini's work has been compared to another sculpture of an elephant carrying an obelisk, one on the Fontana dell'Elefante in the town square of Catania, Sicily. That ele phant, said to be Phoenician, was adopted as the emblem of Catania, and the obelisk once stood in the Roman circus of that city. How ever, the assumed antiquity of the bizarre composition was disproved when it was revealed to have been the work of eigh teenth-century architect Giovanni Battista Vaccarini, who imitated Bernini.3 Other suggestions tracing the precedents of the Piazza Minerva monument to Roman coinage having proved equally unconvinc ing, the composite sculpture is now general ly seen as an original invenzione. Bernini initially submitted several alter native drawings for a sculptural setting of the obelisk that Pope Urban VIII's nephew Francesco Barberini wished to set in the Palazzo Barberini gardens and also fash ioned a small bozzetto of the elephant envis aged in one of the designs;4 but after Urban's death in 1644, the initiative was abandoned. Two decades passed before the project was resumed, this time under the auspices of Pope Alexander VII, who decid ed to place the elephant with the obelisk in front of the ancient church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva. The execution was entrusted to Bernini's assistant Ercole Ferrata, who set the composite sculpture on an architec tural pedestal that bears two tablets with Latin epigrams. One of these says: "In the Year of Salvation 1667, Alexander VII ded icated to Divine Wisdom this obelisk sacred to the Egyptian Pallas [Palladis Aegyptiae]; the monument has been wrested from the earth so that it might be erected in Miner va's piazza, which now belongs to the Mother of God."5 The text mentions the fact that the church stands on the site of an ancient temple of Isis that was rededicated to Minerva, who in the Middle Ages was Christianized as a "type" of Virgin Mary." A humanist would also recognize in the seem ingly anachronistic reference to the "Egyp tian Pallas" an allusion to the Greek goddess of wisdom identified with Minerva. The fact that the word minerva was also a current synonym for "knowledge"7 implies</page><page sequence="2">36 Fig. 1 G.-L. Bernini, Elephant and Obelisk. 1667. Marble and granite. Piazza Minerva, Rome</page><page sequence="3">37 that hgyptian Fall as would be understood as alluding to the divine wisdom that the inscription associates with the obelisk. The message is elaborated in the other dedicato ry inscription: "Let any beholder of the carved images of the wisdom of Egypt on the obelisk carried by the elephant realize that it takes a robust mind to carry solid wisdom."8 The laudatory intent of the mon ument has been even more clearly explicat ed in a panegyric presumably composed on the occasion of the obelisk's inauguration. The encomium says: "The obelisk, symbol of the rays of Sol, is brought by the elephant to the Seventh Alexander as a gift. Is not the animal wise? Wisdom hath given to the world solely thee, O Seventh Alexander, consequently thou has the gifts of Sol."9 Although the author of this verse was evi dently aware that Egyptian obelisks were connected with solar worship, the reference to the "gifts of Sol" has an additional mean ing. Members of the papal entourage were no doubt aware that Alexander VII's prede cessor, Alexander VI Borgia, also an ama teur scholar of Egyptian culture, liked to think of himself as a descendant of Osiris, who was venerated as the sun god.10 When the Roman emperor assumed the character istics of the oriental sun god, he was styled "Sol invictus" [invincible sun]." The title would also be appropriate for the Roman popes, who considered themselves heirs of the Roman Empire. However, it is possible that the "Sol" in the laudatory verse alludes to "Sol hominum" [mankind's sun], a rhetor ical epithet of Solomon as the paradigm of supreme sagacity, which, the versifier says, the elephant shares with Alexander VII. embodiment of bulk or great weight; ele phantine means "unwieldy," and in folklore, "an elephant in a porcelain store" is like "a bull in a china shop," denoting clumsiness. In antiquity, elephants were considered wild, awe-inspiring animals. Since tamed elephants were often used in warfare, in medieval animal lore an elephant came to symbolize the epic struggle of the tempera ments. According to a moralistic exegesis, the elephant was even designated a "Chris tian soldier" who fights evil. This would perhaps make the elephant an appropriate symbol of the moral task of the papacy. The intellectual capacity ascribed to the pachyderm strikes one as unusual. A mod irn viewer might see the elephant as an The conceptual linking of the elephant with the wisdom of Egypt reflects the Ital ian humanists' fascination with hieroglyph ic script, which at that time could be studied on the dozen or so obelisks brought to Rome in antiquity and still seen in the piaz zas.12 The enigmatic pictographs, then believed to contain the secrets of ancient Egyptian priests, were the subject of repeat 2d decoding attempts.13 The eminent philol ogist Athanasius Kircher interpreted the inscription on the Piazza Minerva obelisk as its solemn dedication to the "Highest Genius, by the Egyptians called World Spir it, which has its seat in the sun.'"4 In accor dance with the syncretic method of sxegesis, the World Spirit would probably be associated with the Holy Spirit. Bernini's 3lephant would thus be understood as bear ;r of the divine inspiration. The symbolic meaning assigned to the dephant was also influenced by the many references to the Egyptian culture in the allegorical romance Hypnerotomachia Poli ohili, published in Venice in 1499. The title, said to be derived from a compound of Greek terms, means Poliphilus's duel of love in a dream.15 The author, Francesco</page><page sequence="4">38 Bernini's interest in the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili illustration may originally have been aroused by the Barberini's acquisition of the ancient Preneste domain that former ly belonged to the author of the romance. Whatever the case, Pope Alexander VII owned a copy of the book, which he anno tated in his own hand. On the margin of the text about the elephant's wisdom, he wrote a note about the mystery of the Resurrec Colonna, was formerly believed to have been an erudite Dominican friar from the convent of Saints Giovanni and Paolo in Venice. More recently, scholars tend to identify him with another Francesco Colon na, member of the highest Roman aristo cracy, the signore of Palestrina (ancient Preneste), known as an amateur archaeolo gist and antiquarian.16 The romance has many woodcut illustrations ascribed to a Venetian workshop,17 including some arbi trarily designed, rebuslike pictographs pre sented as authentic Egyptian inscriptions, a few of them adorning obelisks. Scholars have long noticed the similarity of Bernini's composite sculpture to one of the wood cuts—that showing a fantastic monument composed of an obelisk set upon a small elephant.18 The relative commentary says that the elephant's brain is in the head and interprets an inscription in Greek and Ara bic characters on the elephant's forehead as "fatica et talento" [labour and talent], which may suggest that the animal's actions are controlled by a God-given intelligence. The mental qualities ascribed to the elephant were apparently based on the only known ancient treatise on hieroglyphs supposedly composed by an obscure Greek author, Horapollo of Nikopolis, where an elephant is said to be the hieroglyphic symbol of virtue and prudence.19 tion. The seemingly incongruous associa tion of the elephant with a religious theme suggests the pope's familiarity with yet another well-known humanistic textbook, Cesare Ripa's Iconologia, a compilation of allegorical images accompanied by verbal explanations. The illustrations feature two surprisingly small elephants. One accompa nies the female personification of Temper ance, who bears a timepiece and reins, alluding to her control of human instincts.20 The other appears in the allegory of Reli gion, personified by a veiled woman bear ing in her right hand a book and a crucifix, and, in her left, a flame (Fig. 2). This ele phant, described in the text as "Ieroglifico della Religione" [hieroglyph of religion], is typified by a very prominent forehead and an extraordinarily large wide-open eye, which, considering the diminutive size of the animal, may be understood as a visible expression of its piety.21 Ripa says that the moralistic characterization of the elephant is given in Pliny's Natural History, where ele phants, said to be worshipers of the sun and the stars, are seen as "religious animals pos sessing a mysterious intelligence."22 This opinion is also shared by Aristotle, who in his treatise on the nature of animals says that elephants tamed in India have quick perception and superior understanding.23 Aristotle may have observed the animals' behavior, but the characterization may per haps also allude to the elephant-headed Hindu god Ganesha, who symbolizes con sciousness and intellectual integrity. Bernini may not have been familiar with the thoughtful Ganesha, and we do not know for sure whether he ever had an opportunity to study a live elephant; but between Aristotle, whom he would have read, and using the Hypnerotomachia illus</page><page sequence="5">39 tration as his paradigm, he designed the Piazza Minerva monument. However, on closer inspection, the often-repeated com parison of the composite sculpture with the woodcut shows some remarkable differ ences (see Figs. 1 and 3). One is the shape of the elephant's ear: in the woodcut, the contour of the ear is rounded, while the grooved form of Bernini's elephant's ear reminds one of a scallop shell. Considering that a conch is a conventional symbol of sanctity, the shell-shaped ear suggests that the animal absorbed its sacred intelligence through the ears. The wisdom of the ele phant is even more explicit in its very large, wide-open eyes, which, contrasting to the small eye of the elephant in the Hypnero tomachia illustration, indicates a reference to the large-eyed elephant in Ripa's allegory of Religion. But Bernini went even further: the upturned pupils—a conventional indica tion of heavenly inspiration often used in Fig. 2 Allegory of Religion, c. 1608. Woodcut. From C.

Colonna, Hypnerotomachia Poliphili (1499)</page><page sequence="7">41 portraits of saints—and the prominence of the elephant's high-domed forehead give the animal an almost human expression of intelligence (Fig. 4). Writers struck by the effect sometimes thought it a joke.24 This might perhaps be related to Bernini's well known interest in the then-novel artistic genre of witty physiognomic sketches called ritrattini carichi ("loaded portraits"), which contemporary connoisseurs praised as being superior to realistic likenesses in disclosing the true character of the sub jects.25 Bernini applied the representational mode to animals as well; some of his preparatory sketches for the elephant show an exaggeration of its anatomic features. However, the sculpture hardly qualifies as a cartoon, and the allegedly comic intention is not compatible with its being part of a pub lic monument celebrating the sagacity of a reigning pontiff. It seems to me that the human expression of the elephant indicates Bernini's knowl edge of the then-fashionable discipline of comparative physiognomy of men and ani mals. The comparisons had the authority of Aristotle, or, to be more precise, of an anonymous Greek text ascribed to him that expounded a method of divining the charac ter and instinctive behavioral patterns of men by studying their physical resemblance to certain animals.26For instance, an individ ual resembling a lion can be expected to share the animal's behavioral traits, while G.-L. Bernini, detail of Fig. 1: elephant's head</page><page sequence="8">42 similarity to a bird of prey indicates an anal ogous disposition in man. These charactero logical comparisons later formed the basis of Giovanni Battista della Porta's major treatise on physiognomy, which went through several editions in Bernini's life time.27 The text analyzing the similarities of men and animals is illustrated by numerous engravings, each of which shows an animal juxtaposed with a representative human type. Many of the portraits are of historical celebrities, while the animals to which they are compared include common domestic beasts, certain birds of prey, and some exot ic creatures such as a monkey, an ostrich, and even a hippopotamus. The elephant is described as a judicious animal, distin guished by extraordinary natural intelli gence,28 but there is no illustration either of the animal or of a related human type. The individual chosen by della Porta as a repre sentative of outstanding intellectual capaci ties is Socrates, whose portrait, della Porta says, was drawn after an antique bust owned by his brother Giovanni Vincenzo. The fea tures of the sage are compared to a stag, whose intellectual capacity (also mentioned by pseudo-Aristotle) is said to be evidenced by the bone structure of its skull; its promi nent forehead and the perfectly formed, wide-open eyes are described as the visible signs of wisdom (Fig. 5). Bernini's interest in della Porta's descrip tion of the Socratic type is attested in the physiognomic traits of several of his fig ures: for instance, Saint Athanasius, the learned Father of the Church, who stands beside the Cathedra Petri in the apse of St. Peter's. The same bald head and high fore head also occur in a sketch of the kneeling Saint Jerome, who was celebrated for his wisdom, and again in statue of the same 10.

Windsor Castle Royal Collection, England (no. 5603) saint in the Chigi Chapel in Siena. Even more remarkable is the fact that the Socrat ic physiognomy also characterizes Bernini's several sketches of Pope Alexander VII. Two of these showing the pope wearing an oversized tiara are a part of workshop designs for a memorial statue in the Cathe dral of Siena.29 But of greater interest are the designs for the pope's sepulchre in St. Peter's featuring a statue of the pope bare headed. The statue, realized by Michele Maglia after the pope's death, is less reli able as a portrait than Bernini's sketches. The sketches, consisting of only a few rapid strokes, were presumably drawn from mem ory and resemble sharply defined shorthand notes of the salient traits of the pope's phys iognomy (Fig. 6).30Observing the bald head and prominent forehead of the bearded Alexander VII, one notes immediately that he closely resembles the physiognomic traits of Socrates that Bernini assigned to the great Christian sages. If one considers the theory of physiognomic typology, the resemblance is not surprising. It implies that in belonging to the same human type, the pope is also the recipient of God-given wis dom. However, Bernini's elephant also shares the same typologic features (Figs. 4 and 5). The reference to the Socratic type in the elephant may have been motivated by della Porta's remark that the traits of wisdom exemplified in the portrait of the Greek sage</page><page sequence="10">44 also typified Minerva, the ancient goddess of wisdom. By way of what we now call free association, this may have suggested the transference of the Socratic features to the Piazza Minerva elephant. The beast was given the typical bald head and huge fore head as well as the large eyes and the intel ligent gaze, while the ungainly nose was evoked in the elephant's trunk. The phys iognomic traits that indicate the elephant's wisdom also associate that animal with Alexander VII, suggesting that it is he whom the elephant represents. The ele phant's human expression may even be seen a kind of ritratto carico—that is, as a non mimetic typological likeness of the pope. Alexander VII's implicit approval of being represented as an elephant was proba bly motivated by the awareness that in della Porta's treatise, famous Roman emperors are likened to animals. The pope would also have known that his predecessor, Alexander VI, had himself represented in the Borgia apartments of the Vatican as the bull Apis, which in Egypt was venerated as the rein carnation of Osiris.31 The death and resur rection of Osiris would, of course, evoke the Resurrection of Christ, which, as we have seen before, Alexander VII associated with the Hypnerotomachia illustration of the ele phant. The possible linkage of the elephant sculpture with the Egyptian god is also sup ported by a passage in Plutarch, who, draw ing upon Macrobius's description of the Egyptian hieroglyphs, says that Osiris is symbolized by an eye ("Osirin oculo exprimunt").32 One may thus infer not only an affinity between Bernini's wide-eyed ele phant and the immortal Osiris, but also a parallel between the representation of Alexander VI in the guise of the bull Apis and the equally eulogistic portrait of Alexander VII as an elephant. Bernini s imaginative adaptation of the concept of physiognomic similarities of men and animals allows us to understand the relationship between his seemingly whimsical interest in witty caricatures and the expressiveness of his major sculptures.33 However, the anthropomorphic physiogno my of the elephant may be seen as repre senting an inversion of the purpose of the comparative methodology. Instead of using an animal as the means of revealing the individuality of a person, Bernini trans ferred the paradigmatic human traits to the animal, which thus came to represent the personality of the pope. Though the effect was not meant to be comic, the discovery of the pope in the elephant is not unlike the recognition of a celebrity in a witty cartoon. The pleasurable effect was no doubt more enjoyable to those who knew Alexander VII personally and were aware of his cultural ambitions. But even to a modern viewer, the elephant sculpture is one of Bernini's most endearing works. NOTES 1. W. S. Heckscher, "Bernini's Elephant and Obelisk," Art Bulletin 29, no. 1 (1947): 155—182. 2. R.
