<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Turbulent Spectrum: Mormon Reactions to the Darwinist Legacy By Richard Sherlock On 31 December 1930 B. H. Roberts of the First Council of Seventy wrote to Rudger Clawson, president of the Council of Twelve Apostles. The subject of his letter was a protest he was making against a speech given by Joseph Fielding Smith published the previous October. Smith's speech had attacked in uncompromising terms one of the pillars of evolutionary theory, the paleontological record of life and death stretching back hundreds of millions of years. In his letter B. H. Roberts wrote in part: I call in question the accuracy of Elder Smith's position in reference to the whole doctrine of his discourse, as being contrary to a great volume of well developed and ascertained truth, established by the researches of scientists of highest character, of profoundest learning, and world wide research. I hold his doctrine contrary at least to the plain implications of scripture; as tending also to reduce the church of the New Dispensation to the character of a narrow, bigoted sect, foresaking the God-given world movement idea of it; and as injurious to the continued faith in the adherence to the teachings of the Church not by a "scattered few" but by a very great number of its membership.1 But Joseph Fielding Smith was not silent in the face of this criticism. In a paper presented to the Council on 14 January 1931 in defense of his position he wrote, "Any doctrine whether it comes in the name of religion, science, philosophy or whatever i t may be, that is in conflict with the revelations of the Lord will fail Richard Sherlock teaches in the Department of Philosophy and Religion at Â¡Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts.

B. H. Roberts had been a member of the First Council of Seventy for over forty years, a defender of the faith in innumerable situations and a prolific author of works in explanation and defense of the church. Joseph Fielding Smith had been an apostle for twenty years, the son of a church president and destined himself for that office. The issue on which these men collided was ostensibly the paleontological record of life and death that supported the evolutionary superstructure of modern biology. But there was a more profound issue at work. How far could one go in adopting the findings of modern intellectuals before compromising historic Mormonism out of existence? This was the real dilemma for these men. For Roberts, unless there was some accomodation, some reconciliation, a great many educated church members would drift away, unable to see how God could provide one record of His creation in nature and another completely different record in scripture. For Smith, the issue was just as vital; where do you stop once you have given up scriptural literalism in favor of the ideas of men? The faith once delivered to the Saints could easily be wrecked on the shoals of modernism and this, to put it mildly, could not be tolerated. The discussions over evolutionary thought are, thus, only a part of a large and complex phenomenon, a part of the story of adaptation to and conflict with the modem view of man, world, and cosmos that has troubled the American religious scene for over a century.5 The intense debate between Smith and Roberts ended inconclusively with the First Presidency declaring that neither side represented an official church position.4 The profound debate between these Mormon leaders, however, is only symbolic of a much wider spectrum of discussion over evolution that has gone on 2Joseph Fielding Smith to Rudger Clawson, 14 December 1931, Clawson Papers, Church Archives. 'Only some of the vast literature on the development of evolutionary biology and its impact on religious thought can be cited. For the development of evolutionary biology the best treatments are Loren Eisely, Darwin's Century (Garden City: Doubleday and Co., 1958), and John Greene, The Death of Adam (Ames, Iowa: Iowa State University Press, 1959). It impact on American thought is treated in Bert James Lowenberg, Darwinism Comes to America (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1969), and Richard Hofstadter, Social Darwinism in American Thought (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1944). Its impact on religious and philosophical thought is treated in C. C.

For the Mormon reaction there is really no adequate survey. The best discussion of what might be thought of as an "official response" is found in Duane Jeffrey, "Seers, Savants, and Evolution: The Uncomfortable Interface," Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought 8 (Autumn-Winter 1973): 41-75. 4I am treating this episode in depth in another paper that is forthcoming; also see Jeffrey, "Seers, Savants, and Evolution," pp. 63-64.</page><page sequence="3">Sherlock: The Darwinist Legacy 35 in Mormon society since the turn of the century. None ot these views can lay claim to being an authoritative church position. Each one represents a sincere attempt to come to grips with the disturbing challenge presented by Darwin and his intellectual descendants. This paper will examine a spectrum of thinkers whose reactions are as diverse as anything found outside of Mormonism. They stretch from the utter hostility of Joseph Fielding Smith to the subtle theological reconstruction of W. H. Chamberlin with numerous other positions in between. Joseph Fielding Smith: Secure in the Faith The most consistent opposition to evolutionary theory from Mormon sources has come from Joseph Fielding Smith. From his earliest published speeches to the publication of a massive attack in Man: His Origin and Destiny forty years later, the central themes of his position do not vary. Evolution is both untrue and destructive of faith. It is a Satan-inspired idea with which there can be no compromise. His is almost a Protestant fundamentalism in a Mormon setting.5 Smith was not a scientist and he would not have been prepared to argue against the theory on scientific grounds, nor would he have wanted to. For him the word of God as revealed in the literal text of the scriptures was the only certain standard. Everything else must be tested against it. If it conflicted with the scriptures it must be wrong. His earliest published attack on evolution is en tided "The Word of the Lord Superior to the Theories of Men." This was the central concern of his attack thereafter. In an April 1930 address he spoke of his conviction thusly, ' The word of the Lord means more to me than anything else. I place it before the teachings of men. The truth is the thing which will last. All the theory, philosophy and wisdom of the wise that is not in harmony with revealed truth from God, will perish. Itmust change and pass away and it is changing and passing away constantly, but when the Lord speaks that is eternal truth on which we may rely."6 Elder Smith's concern for the literal accuracy of the scriptures was deeply related to a fundamental conviction that evolution would destroy orthodox Christian belief. In this he resembles one of his favorite sources, fundamentalist geologist George McReady Price, who once wrote, "No Adam, no fall; no fall, no atonement; no atonement, no savior." In short, the whole theological structure of orthodoxy was threatened.7 The central problem was Adam and the fall. Smith was convinced that orthodoxy stood or fell with a literal Adam and a literal fall. In fact he argued that ( 1 ) the literalness of Adam and Eve, (2) the fall bringing death on the earth, 5The use of the term fundamentalism can be very vague and is often not a useful label to understand someone's position. In this case, however, I am prepared to argue in depth that Joseph Fielding Smith's fundamental convictions and many of his specific arguments are those of the Protestant fundamentalist.

To deny the story of Adam destroyed the necessity of a redeemer and would end with the destruction of the faith. For him evolution denied the story of Adam. To the evolutionist Adam was a primitive cave man ascended from some more primitive primate and not the offspring of God placed on earth for the divine purpose of populating the world. "If you believe in the doctrine of the evolutionist, then you must accept the view that man has evolved through countless ages from very lowest forms of life up through various stages of animal life, finally into human form. The first man, according to this hypothesis known as the cave man, was a creature absolutely ignorant and devoid of any marked intelligence over the beasts of the field. Then Adam, and by that I mean the first man, was not capable of sin. He could not transgress, and by doing so bring death into the world; for, according to this theory, death had always been in the world. If, therefore, there was no fall, there was no need of an atonement, hence the coming into the world of the Son of God as the Savior of the world is a contradiction, a thing impossible. Are you prepared to believe such a thing as that?"8 For Joseph Fielding Smith, anyone who adopted evolutionary views would end up rejecting the "fundamental doctrines of Christianity"; the two were utterly irreconcilable. Modern evolutionary theory was for him Satanic in character: "What I believe to be the most pernicious doctrine ever entering the mind of man [is] the theory that man evolved from lower forms of life. For its source we must go beyond the activities of men to the author of evil." Feeling so deeply about the issue the next step is obvious; the theory ought not to be taught in the schools. He is the only Mormon authority who ever seriously advocated this move in public, and in those private papers of others that I have consulted I have been unable to find any private advocacy of suppressing evolutionary thought from the schools. He was convinced that "the man who leads his fellows away from the path to eternal life commits the greatest of all sins." Being certain that evolution did precisely that, his hostility to its being taught to the young easily followed. In his earliest published attack on evolution he wrote, "I do not believe that the falsely so-called scientific theory of man's origin has any more right to a place in public schools than the principles of the gospel of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ have â and not half as much." He further urged his audience to protest against the teaching of evolution in the schools. Years later he attacked the teaching of evolution in the schools in an "enticing manner" so that it led men away from God.9 Smith denied that anyone could be a theistic evolutionist. He recognized that there were men who claimed such a title for themselves but they were only hypocrites. It was a clear proposition, either you believe in the word of God or you didn't. This hostility to any kind of "theistic evolution" is the product of several themes that run throughout his works. First is his belief that there is only one true religion, one true theism. As we saw above this true Christianity 'Joseph Fielding Smith, Man: His Origin and Destiny (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1954), pp. 50-51; Joseph Fielding Smith, "The Origin and Destiny of Man," Improvement Era 23 (March 1920): 387.

On a deeper level however, he saw evolution as a completely naturalistic interpretation of man and the natural world. Evolution had no need for God as the creator of man and the father of the human race. These were central in any Christian system. Furthermore, the evolutionist wanted a completely rational, progressing world in which miracles could not be allowed. This could not be tolerated by Smith's deeply held Mormon convictions about the possibility of the miraculous.10 In the course of his voluminous writings he sharply criticized every part ot the evolutionary corpus. He denied that the earth was very old; the scriptures implied that a day, according to God, was one thousand years so the computation of a thirteen thousand-year-old earth easily followed. He denied the specific thesis of organic mutability of species in uncompromising terms. There was an "eternal decree that animals of different families or species shall remain separate from other species and there are bounds they cannot cross." He also attacked the idea of a "primitive man." Adam walked and talked with God. He kept records and passed them on to his posterity. Certainly Adam was not the man described by the paleontologists and the archeologists. If the scriptures are right they are wrong. The search for missing links came under fire as he ridiculed scientists who have "been forced to fraud and deception" to bolster up their theory in the absence of evidence. He seems to have taken great satisfaction in pointing out the hoax of the Piltdown man as a prime example of the willingness of science to be deceived.11 It seems apparent though, that Smith often lumped several different views together and condemned them all. He often attacked the idea of spontaneous generation, which clearly was a naturalistic interpretation of the coming of life on earth. He seems to have believed that the consistent evolutionist also believed in spontaneous generation, which certainly was not true. He also held that evolution demanded a belief in the inheritance of acquired characteristics, something which with the development of modern genetics was simply not the case. Finally he identified believers in evolution with students of "higher criticism" as "two groups of the same general class . . . each . . . bent on the destruction of the story of creation and the development of humanity as this story is told in the Bible."12 Though his lack of scientific learning often led him into errors, he did see clearly the difficulties of any reconciliation between Mormon theology and evolutionary thought. The fundamental intuition of the evolutionist was gradual change from simple to complex, from primitive to sophisticated in 10Science without God would inevitably lead to unbelief. Constant dwelling on the naturalistic understanding of the world would destroy any belief in the supernatural causes of the world. Cf.

But the strong restorationist lmpluse in Mormon thought made the present only a copy of the past and had the effect of shortening the historical perspective that supported evolutionary thought. If present and past could be brought together in this way, the possibility of the kind of elaborate systems of social and cosmic evolution as that envisioned by Spencer would certainly be questioned. Furthermore Mormon anthropomorphism made God the prototype of man. Adam was literally his offspring. To think of a being made in the literal image of God as only the result of descent from other forms of life was a difficult move indeed.13 Mormon thought, however, is a diverse complex of elements, and other thinkers found themes compatible with a variety of evolutionary speculations. One of the most deep-seated of these themes was the conviction that truth was indivisible. Mormonism, so the argument ran, emcompasses all truth. There is not one set of truths in religion and another set of truths in science. All truths are part of one whole, one set of truths that do not conflict. This conviction led several important church authorities to attempt to account in some way for the mass of evidence that conflicted with the traditional views of the creation and the coming of Adam. James t. Talmage : Divided Loyalties The first of these men was Apostle James E. Talmage. Talmage was a trained geologist, a president of two universities, and a man who believed that modern scientific discoveries were important and could not be denied outright. But though he was sympathetic to science, his religious convictions prevented him from becoming a supporter of organic evolution. Ultimately he retreated from any evolutionary thought into the world view of Bishop Ussher and the coming of Adam at 4004 B.C. Talmage did not write or publish a great deal on evolution. His first discussion of the matter came in 1890, before he became an apostle. At the time he was president of L.D.S. College in Salt Lake and taught geology and natural science at the school. In an address to teachers in Utah County he discussed evolution at some length. This speech set a pattern for Talmage's later discussions of evolutionary theory and the ideas surrounding it.14 In the speech Talmage distinguished between a general idea of evolution as a theory of development or change and the specific hypothesis of natural selection and organic mutability advanced by Darwin and his followers. Demonstrating a wide acquaintance with the history of evolutionary thought he discussed the background of the Darwinian synthesis in Buffon, Lamarck, and Erasmus Darwin, Charles Darwin's grandfather. Talmage devoted most of his speech to a criticism of the evolutionary ideas of Darwin and his most prominent supporter, Thomas Huxley. He began by dismissing the idea that life originated in some primordial protoplasm as the result of chance occurences. Any such generation has not been demonstrated, he argued, and all attempts to find or create such matter have failed. Hence, on this "Smith, Man: His Origin and Destiny, p. 248. "James E. Talmage, The Theory of Evolution (Provo: Utah County Teachers Association, 1890).</page><page sequence="7">Sherlock: The Darwinist Legacy 39 point the theistic conclusion was obvious: "Without spontaneous generation 'miracle' in the words of Strauss was and is still necessary to explain the advent even of the hypothetical primordial germ."15 But Talmage well knew that spontaneous generation and evolution were not the same thing. Thus he proceeded to argue against the central thesis of the Darwinian synthesis, the organic mutability of species. The fixity of species was a hallmark of his thinking and it always remained so. He regarded the idea of change from one specie to another as an unproven theory which was largely only speculation. Variations do occur, he admitted, but he called his audience's attention to the sterility of hybrids as a classic example of the "law" that species reproduce only "after their own kind." Each creation was a special work of the Creator marvelously adapted to its specific environment. The insect is fitted for its abode on the leaf; the fish for the water; the bird for the air; each beast for its allotted life; and so man for his. No one form can be transmuted into another. The thought that it could be otherwise is far more wild than the alchemist's dream of transmuting base lead into royal gold. In the fable of old the frog burst when it tried to appear as an ox. Each after its kind â each to its sphere â this is the song of nature; and all praise to nature's God.16 This hostility to the idea of the mutability of species did not prevent Talmage from adopting the language of evolution. There was, he said, a "true evolution" that was not subject to the attacks that he launched. This true evolution was signified by the idea of development and growth. "Is evolution true?" he asked; "Aye: true evolution is true. The evolution that means advancement, progress, growth toa full realization of the intended measure of all things, that is true."17 In line with many others Talmage regarded Mormomsm as the best expression of this true evolution. What more lavish evolutionary thought was there than that men could progressively devolop into gods. This was evolution at its grandest. The evolutionist who failed to see the cosmic evolution of the spirit in man was truly blind. Men were not the offspring of other animals, they were the offspring of God. But they were evolving in his sense, developing and progressing into Divine beings themselves.18 Though he tried to co-opt the language of evolution, a fundamental hostility to the central thesis of the evolutionary system remained. It was still there forty years later. Talmage recognized that certain hard facts from geological and paleonto logical studies could not be ignored. He seems to have been convinced of the necessity to account in some fashion for these well established facts. The most important statement from him in this regard was his 1931 address, "The Earth and Man," but during the same time period Talmage answered many letters on topics surrounding evolutionary theory. With these sources it is not difficult to reconstruct the main contours of his thinking. 15Ibid., p. 9. 16Ibid., p. 17. "Ibid., p. 16. "James E. Talmage, "What Mormonism Stands For," Liahona 6 (February 1909): 829-32; and Talmage, "Fallen But He Shall Rise Again," Improvement Era 22 (October 1919): 1067-68.</page><page sequence="8">40 Journal of Mormon History l almage began by admitting that the earth was considerably older than man. How old he did not know, but the church made no pronouncement on such matters and if geologists said that it was very old then that was probably true. Such a concession as this would not produce shock waves anywhere. American theologians had been saying it since the 1830s without great difficulty, and inside the church many were prepared to accept it. His next move was more challenging. Plants and animals had existed for ages before the coming of man. Furthermore they had lived and died during these countless ages. This was the major concession made in the 1931 address: "According to the conception of geologists the earth passed through ages of preparation during which countless generations of plants and animals existed in great variety and profusion and gave in part the very substance of their bodies to help form certain strata which are still in existence as such." As it stands this statement could be interpreted as merely a report of what geologists believe about earth history. But in a letter a few months later he was explicit on his own belief: I cannot agree with your conception that there was no death of plants and animals anywhere upon this earth prior to the transgression of Adam, unless we assume that the history of Adam and Eve dates back many hundreds of thousands of years. The trouble with some theologians â even including many of our own good people â is that they undertake to fix the date of Adam's transgression as being approximately 4000 years before Christ and therefore about 5932 years ago. If Adam was placed upon the earth only that comparatively short time ago the rocks clearly demonstrated that life and death have been existent and operative in this earth for ages prior to that time.19 As the above letter suggests, Talmage admitted life and death of animals for those countless ages but did not include man in this process. He still believed in the biblical chronology for the coming of Adam. In the 1931 speech he explicitly accepted Bishop Ussher's calculations of the coming of Adam about 4000 B.C. In two other letters, one before and one after the speech, the same affirmation appears.20 If Adam only came four thousand years before Christ then Talmage was clearly headed for difficulty. Talmage's whole concern in giving the speech was to show that the church was not hostile to the well established facts of science. But then what about the remains of human beings that date back at least hundreds of thousands of years? Though he does seem to have wrestled with this problem, he cannot be said to have firmly resolved it in his own thinking. In the 1931 speech he very tentatively suggested that there might have been men on earth before Adam â "pre-Adamic men." To do this he suggested that the period since Adam be regarded as one long Adamic dispensation with whatever came before as a completely different dispensation with which we are not to be concerned. The history of the "Adamic race" (his term) still was correct but now it was to be regarded as only the story of the Adamic peoples and not of every creature that ever lived on the earth. His discussion of this subject is cryptic and "James E.

This is because Talmage himself realized that dogmatic assertions in this area were likely to be more harmful than beneficial. In his journal on the day the First Presidency gave its decision in the controversy between Smith and Roberts, he wrote "This is one of the many things on which we cannot preach with assurance, and dogmatic assertions on either side are likely to do harm rather than good." He seems not to have been hostile to the idea of pre-Adamites but his reticence for speculative discussions held him back from any full scale discussion.21 If he did not want to be dogmatic on some questions, others he was emphatic about. The most important of these was the central thesis of evolution â the mutability of species. He had rejected such ideas in his early address, and he rejected them here late in his life. On this point he was unambiguous. Species do not evolve into other species; they continue to reproduce only "after their own kind. ' ' This was especially true of man. He regarded the idea that man's body was the product of descent from lower life forms as an "unproved hypothesis." Certainly "the holy scriptures should not be discredited by the theories of men." Man was the descendant of God, not lower animals. Of this Talmage remained certain.22 He never forsook the idea of special creations for the evolutionary hypothesis of descent with modification. He was willing to attempt some modification of biblical literalism in the face of science, but on the crucial issues of the evolutionary thesis, Talmage retreated. In a letter written a few months before his death, Talmage expressed some of the thinking that had been part of his fundamental scheme of reference on this topic for forty years. In it he summed up his themes of "true evolution," the necessity of accounting for the facts of science, and the idea of special creation. Undoubtedly true evolution is true, meaning progress from the lower to the higher, from the simple to the more complex. We cannot sweep aside all the accumulated knowledge in geology, archeology or any other branch of science simply because our interpretation of some isolated passage of scripture may seem to be opposed thereto. I do not believe that Adam derived his mortal body by evolutionary processes from the lower animals. The adamic race of men are of an entirely different order.23 In the end Talmage's thinking on evolution is an amalgam of diverse impulses. It is the mark of a man with deeply divided loyalties. As a scientist he knew that the evidence could not be denied; yet as a churchman he could not bring himself to adopt the position of many of his fellow scientists. The safe harbor of special creationism was ultimately more appealing to the church leader than the dangerous waters of evolution. B.H. Roberts : The Struggle for Compromise Talmage's desire to attempt some reconciliation between scientific facts and the received faith was greatly amplified by B.H. Roberts. Late in his life Roberts was attempting to understand evolution and paleontology in a monumental manuscript that has remained unpublished. Through this manuscript it is 21Talmage, "The Earth and Man," p. 5; Talmage, Journal, 7 April 1931. 22Talmage, "The Earth and Man," pp. 7, 9. "Talmage to F. C. Williamson, 22 April 1933, Talmage Papers.</page><page sequence="10">42 Journal of Mormon History possible to look at some of the ways Roberts dealt with central questions of evolutionary theory.24 To begin with, Roberts was extremely fond of Spencensm and other such theories of "cosmic evolution" or "cosmic progress." The manuscript contains profuse reference to Spencer and his American disciple John Fiske. He wanted the members of priesthood quorums who would study his book to read these thinkers and others; they would support Mormonism as far as they went. He also enclosed in the study selected references to George Howison's masterful The Limits of Evolution. Howison was one of the most important personalistic idealists in the history of American philosophy. Roberts was convinced that material of this sort would demonstrate in philosophical language and reasoning the truths of Mormonism. In a letter to a BYU professor, Roberts once gave a bibliography for the study of the Book of Mormon. In one section of the list he included works on internal evidence for the Book of Mormon, "showing the modern trend of religion and scientific development with which the Book of Mormon is in harmony and which in a way fulfills much of the prophetic spirit in the Nephite record." He then proceeded to list Herbert Spencer's First Principles, John Fiske's Studies in Religion, A. K. Rogers's Religious Conceptions of the World, and Oliver Lodge's Science and Immortality.25 The first three works are clearly similar in their outlook; that he thought so highly of them suggests his fondness for the theories of cosmic development or "evolution" that they represented. But theories about cosmic evolution or progress were not a central Mormon worry. More importantly it was not what the scientists thought that they had demonstrated. Roberts was clearly impressed with the amount and veracity of the evidence from paleontology on the antiquity of the earth and the life forms inhabiting it. He was also impressed with the powers of variation in nature; in fact he almost comes to the point of seeing the mutability of species. But at last he reverts to a dispensationalist framework and a catastrophist perspectiveon earth history to solve the dilemmas that he faced. Roberts believed that the evidence for the antiquity of the earth and its life forms cannot be denied. There were millions and billions of years of earth history, stretching back to the beginning when God created the world. Roberts 24In a recent article, Truman Madsen has argued that Roberts's discussion of evolutionary thought and his speculations about a pre-Adamite race are not integral to the manuscript and could easily have been left out. I believe that this interpretation ignores two very crucial points that suggest the importance of this section in the manuscript. First, Roberts himself obviously felt that it was so important that he would not cut it out even when that was the only way to get the book published. In fact, he added material on discoveries of prehistoric men after the reading committee of the General Authori des told him to remove the section. Secondly, it is clear from the discussion surrounding the manuscript that he felt keenly the need to effect a reconciliation between the indisputable facts of science and the received Mormon tradition. Without this he was concerned that many educated individuals would desert the church. Given the times the single most explosive area of confrontation was clearly the theory of evolution and the record of prehistoric humans discovered by paleontology. It thus seems that to be consistent with one of Roberts's great concerns, the manuscript would have to attempt some such reconciliation as it does.

Roberts to Amos Merril, undated, Roberts Papers, Church Archives.</page><page sequence="11">Sherlock: The Darwinist Legacy 43 included in the manuscript citations claiming that the world was at least two billion years old. The clear implication of the text is that he was prepared to accept any such figure that science could demonstrate as accurate.26 More importantly Roberts was prepared to accept the well established fossil records of life and death stretching back hundreds of millions of years. Of these records the most important were those relating to the antiquity of man. This was clearly a very important question for Roberts. The manuscript is filled with pages of evidence concerning the discoveries of the fossil remains of prehistoric men. He quoted extensively from many experts concerning the evidence of the great antiquity of the human species all over the earth. The evidence, he said, was so extensive that he could not present nearly all of it.27 If the human race was this ancient then the Book of Genesis was clearly in for difficulties. But Roberts did not make this move of tampering with the Genesis history in any fundamental way. True, the evidence of the antiquity of human beings could not be denied; but it could be interpreted differently. Here Roberts had recourse to the Mormon idea of a physical and a spiritual creation. If this were true then the first chapter of Genesis might be a record of the spiritual creation and the second might be the record of the material or physical creation. But the second chapter implies that man appeared on a barren world before anything else. Hence Roberts seemed to find some scriptural warrant for the idea of some great cataclysm that destroyed all life on earth before the coming of Adam.28 Here was the answer to the dilemma posed by the evidence of the antiquity of human beings on the earth: a race of pre-Adamite human beings. The antiquity of the present human race did only stretch back about four thousand years; in his calculations in this regard Bishop Ussher was about right. But before this great cataclysm the earth existed for ages: plants and animals, men and women had lived and died for millions of years. The period since Adam has been one long Adamic dispensation, dating from the great event that destroyed all other beings on the earth. He was convinced that this theory was the only way to reconcile the scientific evidence and the Mormon scriptures; nothing else would do. Furthermore, Roberts believed this to be an answer that the Christian world at large eagerly awaited. In the manuscript he wrote of his thesis: Here is a fine opportunity for the development of a great truth. A mighty stride forward in truth was made when it became known that the revelation given to Moses had reference not to the whole vast universe but to just this earth on which man lived and its immediate heavens associated with it; and now with the evidence of life and death on the earth so indisputably evident, including the pre-adamite life and death of man in various stages of successive race life, why not recognize that truth and see that which is inevitable, that in the advent of Adam the time had come for the achievement of some special purpose in relation to man â some spiritual relationship that brought about the introduction of the adamic dispensation? Otherwise the whole volume of facts as they are disclosed are thrown into confusion; and the revealed truths themselves for most men rendered doubtful, being out of harmony with the facts ascertained as to man's antiquity. 26Roberts, "The Truth, The Way, The Life," chap. 24; chap. 31, pp. 3-4. 27lbid., chap. 31, passim; and chap. 31, p. 5. 28His discussion of the idea of two creations is in chap. 30, while the references to the great cataclysm are in chap. 32, pp. 1-3.</page><page sequence="12">44 Journal of Mormon History Roberts was convinced that the tacts could not be denied. The scientists who discovered them he praised as "of the type whence must come the noblest sons of God." They were most certainly not inspired by Satan. But the facts needed to be reconciled with orthodoxy. Here Roberts was convinced that he had found the answer that both Mormons and Christendom at large desperately needed if science and religion were to be reconciled.29 Roberts did not only rely on scientific evidence for his theory of pre-Adamite men. Among other sources of support was an 1854 address by Apostle Orson Hyde. Hyde had argued that if Adam had been commanded to "re-plenish the earth," how could this have been unless the earth had already been populated. To a scriptural literalist the argument seemed quite sensible. Furthermore Roberts said that Brigham Young had agreed with Hyde's speech and thus the argumen t seemed to have prophetic approval. Whether this was actually the case is questionable. Hyde's talk was primarily on marriage; only a short part of it made the above argument. Brigham Young began his own talk by saying. "I do not wish to eradicate any items from the lecture Elder Hyde has given us this evening." It seems more plausible that Young was referring to the discourse asa whole rather than that he was giving his approval to this one short paragraph in the long talk. Nevertheless, Roberts did adopt as sources of support both the argument itself and the prophetic and apostolic source of authority from Hyde and Young.30 This elaborate dispensationalist argument was most clearly not a theory of evolution. It did not deal at all with the central thesis of evolution â the mutability of species and descent with modification. Roberts did discuss this issue at length in the manuscript. Unfortunately, however, his discussion is ambiguous. It suggests a deep uncertainty over the issue and about the implication of organic mutability. As previously, he was impressed with two different sets of evidence. At the outset he was greatly influenced by the biblical argument that species reproduce only "after their own kind." He refers to this several times as the "great law of life." This "after his kind," the law of creation, is iterated and reiterated nine times in this short chapter on creation; the emphasis must be important." He also was greatly impressed with the variation among offspring in nature. He wanted some way to balance these two perspectives of stability and change in nature.31 Roberts called his answer to this problem "the development theory." He thought this theory would preserve the "great law" of reproduction only "after one's own kind" and yet leave room for wide variation within certain bounds. The development theory which I am setting forth as the Bible story of creation differs from both agnostic and creative or theistic evolution ... in this: that both these forms of evolution start with a homogeneous substance which is differentiated into gases liquids and solids (inorganic evolution) thence into life substance and simple forms of life; thence into more complex forms of life until there is produced by an ever differentiating process all the life forms known: whereas the development theory of this chapter and work recognized and starts with the eternity of life â the life force and the eternity of some life 29Ibid., chap. 31, pp. 29 and 28. '"Journal of Discourses, 26 vols. (Liverpool and London, 1854-1886), 2:79-88.

"after its own kind."32 As it stands this view evades the central issue. What are these primeval life forms out of which other forms develop? If they are something less than species themselves then a problem is clearly evident; for the only things we immediately perceive to reproduce "after their own kind are individual species. Once it is claimed that species have developed from other forms the "after its kind" argument is effectively given up. There is no logical reason why all species could not have developed from one primeval life form if the immutability of species is broached. But if Roberts did not want to go as far as the mutability of species then why speak of the development of a myriad of life forms from certain primeval forms. This certainly seems to suggest some idea of the mutability of species. In a later passage he was even more unclear but intriguing: And from a few other forms of life transported to earth there could be development of varied kinds of life yet adhering closely to the great law of life so constantly repeated â 'each after its own kind.' Not necessarily limited to stereotyped individual forms, but developing the kinds from the subdivisions of vegetable and animal kingdoms into various species through development from primeval forms.33 This passage seems on the verge of the idea of the mutability of species. The primeval forms are not individual species but some large grouping such as classes or phyla. But if this is the case then what happens to the "after its own kind" argument? This had traditionally been used to show that horses reproduce horses and dogs reproduce dogs. But if Roberts is now toying with the idea that horses and dogs all descended from some primeval mammalian form then the "after its own kind" argument is in for some serious modification. Furthermore what is to prevent this mammalian form from being descended from even more primitive forms such as reptiles or even amoebas. Quite clearly Roberts's "development view" led him to the edge of the evolutionary theory of descent with modification. Roberts's argument here is faced with serious problems. In order to handle the problem of the antiquity of man he adopted a dispensationalist framework that posited some great cataclysm that destroyed all life on the earth prior to the coming of Adam. Here, however, he clearly argued for an orderly unfolding of life forms. Man in this scheme comes not on a barren world but a world already populated with an infinite variety of plants and animals. Man is the crowning glory of this process of development. He is not the struggling pioneer in a desolate world.34 It is doubtful that any workable reconciliation between these two perspectives could be maintained. Roberts was trying to sustain Bishop Ussher's calculations of biblical chronology in the face of massive evidence that would not support it. He deeply believed that scientists had found evidence that could 52Ibid., pp. 5-6 "Ibid., pp. 10 3,Ibid., p. 8.</page><page sequence="14">46 Journal of Mormon History not be denied, and yet destroyed the traditional understanding of the process of creation and the antiquity of man. Dispensationalism gave him some way out of this problem but it led him to serious difficulties with even more deep-seated convictions in any theistic system. If man really was the noblest of God's creations, then what was God doing destroying a whole race of men in a great catastrophe thousands of years ago? More to the point, if man really was destined to be placed in a lush garden to tend it, then why was he sent into a barren world, where any such garden lay in the distant future when a myriad of life forms had developed from the few "primeval forms." Man in such a scheme doesn't seem much like a crown of creation, especially not a crown placed on earth by a loving Father who is in control of all that happens. Moreover, Roberts's theory of the Adamic dispensation itself reveals a serious tension in his thought. His whole reason for positing such an idea was to account for scientifically established data that could not be denied. Scientists were, for him, noble men engaged in a noble effort, not satanic men out to destroy faith. But what happens when such noble men cannot find any trace of a great cataclysm that destroyed all life a few thousand years ago? The idea of such an event in such a recent past in unsustainable on the scientific evidence; but without it the whole Genesis chronology must be seriously revised. Like Talmage, Roberts ultimately retreated from the implications of organic evolution and the antiquity of man into the less threatening world of cataclysms and dispensations. In the end this too was "contrary to a great volume of well developed and ascertained truth established by researches of scientists of highest character, of profoundest learning and world wide research." Roberts saw clearly that there was a great deal of evidence that could not be squared with the traditional interpretation of the account of creation in Genesis. But he was unwilling to attempt a reconciliation on the basis of a firm commitment to the theory of organic evolution. There were others, however, who attempted precisely that. From the turn of the century Mormon intellectuals have been involved in the reconciliation of the idea of organic evolution with the received faith. Some of these attempts involved bold philosophical systems; others were comparatively milder. What brought both together was a willingness to adopt the central elements of evolutionary theory. Fredrick Pack : Faithful Evolutionist Of these men none was more open about his willingness to accept the specific scientific theory of organic mutability than Fredrick Pack. Pack had been James Talmage's assistant at the University of Utah, and when Talmage resigned to become an apostle, Pack was appointed his successor as Deseret Professor of Geology. Pack had impressive credentials both for a churchman and a scientist. A 1904 graduate of the University of Utah, he proceeded east and obtained a Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1906. He wrote a number of scientific treatises on the geologic structures of Utah and the Wasatch Fault. Asa churchman he was a mission leader, member of a bishopric, stake superintend ent of Sunday schools, member of a stake high council, and finally a member of the general board of the Sunday School. Furthermore he wrote many works for the church and in defense of things dear to the heart of the church leadership. For example, he was a prominent foe to tobacco and a leader in the church-organized</page><page sequence="15">Sherlock: The Darwinist Legacy 47 campaign which led to the passing of a state law that prohibited smoking in public in the early 1920s.35 In 1924, Pack published his major discussion of evolution in his work Science and Belief in God. In it he was forthright and uncompromising in his defense of organic evolution. Evolution was as true as Mormonism for him and two truths could not conflict. Pack began by arguing that nothing in nature was immutable, including species. Change, not stability, was the hallmark of the natural world. "The essence of evolution is the essence of continuous change evolution is essentially a series of changes brought about by the laws of nature." Pack claimed that the notion of the change in species is supported by an "almost unlimited array of evidence in favor of the doctrine of organic evolution." But what of the favorite argument of the critics that evolution meant that horses could reproduce something other than horses and since everyone knew that to be false, evolution stood disproved? This argument had appeared in the earlier Mormon critics of evolution and it was very popular with critics of his own day. With the arrogance of the professional, Pack dismissed this line of reasoning: "Such a statement scarcely merits serious consideration," he wrote, "since no form of the doctrine contemplates the likelihood of a change of that character." The time span envisioned for the development of new species made this argument ridiculous as an attempted disproof of evolution.56 Pack was too much of a scientist to confuse Darwinism with organism. Darwinian theory was one attempt to explain by natural selection the mechanism by which species changed into other species. The fact that evolution had occured was irrefutable for Pack, but the mechanism that had produced this change was open to question. "The fact that scientists do not agree as to the manner in which evolution operates is often interpreted to mean that they disagree in the matter of the validity of the principle itself. This is of course all wrong." Scientists do disagree as to whether or not natural selection is a sufficient mechanism to explain the process but the "doctrine of organic evolution is at present more widely accepted than ever before."37 Pack did disagree profoundly on the question of natural selection. He regarded this as an insufficient explanation of the process. It would explain how some variations were sustained and others were not, but it would not explain the origin of the variations themselves. More deeply, Pack saw that Darwinism, with its ultimate reliance on chance, had no place for the operation of an overarching purpose in nature. Pack believed that this is what was really threatening in Darwinism for those like he who were convinced theists. The idea of organic evolution, including the mutability of species, posed no threat to Pack's faith; Darwinism as an explication of the evolutionary process did.38 It was here that Pack reinterpreted evolutionary theory to account for purposefulness in nature. Contrary to the orthodox Darwinians he argued that the record shows that life developed along "well directed lines." It does not "Basic biographical information is contained in Andrew Jenson, Latter-day Saints Biographi cal Encyclopedia, 4 vols, (reprint; Salt Lake City: Western Epics, 1971), 4:218-19. 36Fredrick Pack, Science and Belief in God (Salt Lake City: Deseret News Press, 1924), pp. 79, 85, 91. "Ibid., and p. 96. 38Ibid., pp. 108-18.</page><page sequence="16">48 Journal of Mormon History support the idea of a random development devoid of plan or purpose. By adding a concept of plan and purpose, Pack thought that the requirements of theism could be satisfied. He felt that such a purposeful law as evolution that did not require "the immediate interposition of Diety" was sufficient. In fact, he argued, it was a more noble view of God to think that He could set up a process that did not require constant supervision than to think that He had to build something that needed constant attention. Someone who built a machine that needed constant repair was certainly less than the greatest builder.'9 But where was man in all of the foregoing? Here Pack was more cautious, undoubtedly because of the emotional nature of the subject. But he remained an evolutionist. He suggested that the evidence was not conclusive in proving that present men had descended from more primitive men and thence from lower primate forms; but it was very persuasive. "To assert as some theologians do that science has failed utterly in its search for evidence connecting man with lower forms of life could only be done by ignoring very pertinent discoveries." Do all animal forms represent one continuous line of descent down to and including man? he asked. "Speaking for the great mass of scientists the reply would be an emphatic 'yes.' " Pack certainly did regard it as highly probable based on persuasive available evidence.40 Pack thought that none of this upset belief in God or faith in the Genesis account. "The search for the origin of man is not a question as to whether or not Diety is the author of his existence. On the other hand the question is merely one of how man reached his present state of development. . . . the doctrine of anthropoid origin of man is not opposed to belief in the Fatherhood of God; it simply attempts to explain the way in which nature operates." The Genesis account was God's way of explaining his creation to ancient men who could not have understood the detailed accounts of modern scientists. If God was "the greatest teacher in the universe" then it seemed entirely reasonable that he would teach men in accord with their ability to understand. "It should not be a source of surprise therefore that many of the scriptural narratives intended for ancient Israel appear to us at least in places to be primitive and even crude." God would not teach men things that were positively untrue but he would put them in a form the people could grasp. Pack even suggested that scientific research might be God's way of giving us new information on the creative process: If God were to repeat the story of man's origin He would probably clear away many of the obscurities surrounding the account contained in the Jewish Scriptures. Doubtless, however, as people become more and more anxious to know the truth, He will supply means for their enlightenment, but no one would care to say whether this enlightenment will come as a direct revelation from God or through the researchers of science.41 Pack's discussion of Genesis attempted to turn the tables on his critics by using evolutionary progression to prove the inspired character of the Genesis narrative. He thought that Genesis represented the successive stages of the creation process and that the geological record told exactly the same story. If this 39Ibidâ pp. 120, 124. Â«Ibid., pp. 193, 173. 4'Ibid., pp. 296, 206, 179.</page><page sequence="17">Sherlock: The Darwinist Legacy 49 were the case then the revelatory character of Genesis was proved because the ancient world did not have the benefit of modern science. Moses must have received his information from elsewhere since no one except God could have told him such truths. The Genesis narrative was an inspired accounting of the stages in the creative process in a form that ancient men could understand. As far as it goes science has confirmed it; science only adds to it more details and modifies the form of the story.42 It should be abundantly clear that Pack was an outright exponent of organic evolution as the mechanism of creation. The more intriguing question is how he was able to depart so greatly from the widely held beliefs and still be considered a devoted member of the religious community. The answer is found in his absolute devoutness in areas that mattered more to the great majority of Mormon people. As Thomas Kuhn has brilliantly argued, scientific departures from orthodoxy can be tolerated so long as the exponent of the new is viewed as a defender of orthodoxy. On the important question from Mormon society during the period, the moral purity of its members as distinct from the Babylon around them, Pack was a staunch defender of the faith. In fact he could be classed as an ardent enthusiast. He published tracts against smoking, he defended the evils of smoking in talks, forums, and before the legislature. He was a key figure in the passage of the 1921 law which prohibited smoking in public in Utah. Moreover, he attacked the drinking of cola drinks because of caffeine content. As a defender of orthodoxy in areas of greatest concern, he could thus be permitted his own ideas in other areas without harm to his standing in the community.43 Nels Nelson : Mormonism as Evolution Though Pack published perhaps the most definite and rigorous defense of the scientific thesis of organic evolution, others were engaged in even more elaborate evolutionary speculations. One of the boldest of these attempts to expound a more elaborate system of cosmic evolution was that of Neis Nelson. Nelson taught English at Brigham Young University from 1883 until 1920, with some time out for a mission and study in the East. He also taught philosophy, religion, and public speaking during his varied career at the university.44 Furthermore he was a convinced exponent of evolutionary thought. The most important of Nelson's discussions of evolutionary thought is contained in his Scientific Aspects of Mormonism. This book was first published in 1904 with the financial and moral support of the church. In a circular sent around to advertise the book, Nelson quoted from Anthon Lund of the First Presidency a letter lavishly praising the book. I have been unable to locate a copy "Fredrick Pack, "The Creation of the Earth," Improvement Era 13 (Septemberl910): 1023-27; 13 (October 1910): 1121-27; 14 (January 1911): 220â30; much of this same argument is found in the book, pp. 248-60.

It is established that the First Presidency was so interested in having the book published that they loaned Nelson $800 to pay the publisher. It seems rather farfetched to suppose that the First Presidency would have done this without at least one of them having read the manuscript and approved of its publication. Moreover, it is known that Joseph F. Smith thought so highly of Nelson that he sent him manuscripts to review for doctrinal soundness and literary merit before deciding whether they should be published by the church. From the mass of letters between Nelson and church leaders it is clear that he was on close terms with Joseph F. Smith and that they definitely approved of his work, so much so that they approved of him giving the book to interested people as an explication of Mormonism with the cost of these gifts to be deducted from what Nelson owed the First Presidency.45 The avowed intention of Nelson's work was to demonstrate that Mormonism was compatible with the best scientific thought of the era. He claimed that Mormonism would be shown to be a uniquely scientific religion. Moreover, Nelson thought that any religion that "is not scientific is scarcely worthy of the credence of our enlightened age." Unless religion agreed with "the Book of Nature" it would fail the test of believability.46 With this fundamental belief Nelson set out to demonstrate that Mormonism is uniquely in agreement with the best "scientific" thought of the age. In the course of this demonstration Nelson developed a vast system of biological, spiritual, racial, and intellectual evolution. In fact, evolution and progress are the key words of his work. What he did, fundamentally, was to link the notions of evolution and progress that were extremely popular at the time with Mormon ideas of eternal progress and call the result Mormonism. Like his mentors Fiske and Spencer, Nelson saw the whole universe moving toward increasing vistas of intellectual, moral, and spiritual growth. In the end Nelson even interprets that most miraculous of Christian events, the resurrection of the dead, in terms of gradual evolution.47 We shall only be able to discuss some of the themes in this complex and sometimes confusing book. For Nelson the world was neither the product of chance nor was it the outcome of some instantaneous event. It was the product of gradual growth and development overseen by God. "If to the idea of evolution there be added the idea of constant oversight, that things happen not by drifting but by direction, then we have fairly the Mormon idea of evolution." This growth, or evolution, was taking place in all spheres of human life. In the intellectual sphere Nelson argued that mankind's ideas of God are developing as their environment and their ideals are changing: "The honest man's conception of God is a progressively growing ideal." Nelson explicitly argued that this is the case because men project onto God their highest ideals. Moreover, since this is true "A copy of this notice is in the Church Archives. See letters of Joseph F. Smith to N. L. Nelson, 11 May and 9 July 1904, and N. L. Nelson to Joseph F. Smith, 9 May, 12 May, and 8 June 1904, Joseph F.

"Ibid., p. 229.</page><page sequence="19">Sherlock: The Darwinist Legacy 51 any attempt to prevent men from developing even more noble ideas of God should be rejected: "Let no council of ecclesiastics presume to lay an embargo on his soul by pronouncing once and for all what God is or is not." This would only be another form of "priestcraft."48 Nelson carried his system of spiritual evolution out to the conclusion that heaven was also evolving with the race. Heaven is described by him as "that state which is the sum total at any moment of what God has achieved." Heaven is thus not so much a place as a state of the soul, and, as everyone knows, states of the soul are always changing. As man's highest ideals change, as his vision of what God is becomes more noble, heaven itself changes. As man comes closer to living the ideals that he professes, he comes closer to heaven itself. This theme of a heaven that is always present and evolving is made explicit later on: That is to say heaven is always a present, not a future state of the soul; and if any being would know the extent, theheighth, the depth and the breadth, of bliss which the universe has in store for him at any time, let him take stock of how much heavenly beauty he sees and feels and lives in the creations immediately around him. . . . He is in the highest heaven who sees most beauty, feels most harmony in the creations immediately around him. The evolution of the whole universe is Nelson's theme and in this extensive vista even the most central themes of Christianity are changing as they are given new meaning by developing beings.49 In such a scheme as this Nelson has a place for almost everything, including Darwin. "It must by this time have dawned on the reader that Mormonism is a transcendent system of evolution â a system so vast and far reaching that by comparison the researches of Darwin and his collaborators important though they have been are but links in an endless chain." Darwin's research was true but it was all only part of the vast evolutionary system under the control of God. Nelson was clearly prepared to adopt anything that science might discover about the process of creation. Whatever way it happened, it was God's way. Science has traced better than theology can the history of creation since the beginning of the operation of this law; and with the facts of science Mormonism has no controversy. Ask me how God created the world and I shall answer: 'In the way it could be created and not in the way it couldn't.' Ask me how long it took Him and I shall say: 'As long as it needed to take.' That is the only commentary of Mormonism on the first chapter of Genesis. The only thing that Mormonism would add to science is the provision that all processes are under the control of God; things happen not by chance but by the plan and supervision of God.50 Nelson's system, thus, clearly has a place for the central evolutionary hypothesis of the mutability of species. On this he is open and direct; if that is the way that God worked he sees nothing wrong in accepting it. "Surely it is a sensible, an economical, a beautiful way of introducing variety into the flora and fauna of the earth; and if it is God's way â and it surely is if it is the way at all â 18Ibid., pp. 62, 18-20, and 20. "Ibid., pp. 38, 56, 60. 50Ibid., pp. 61, 65.</page><page sequence="20">52 Journal of Mormon History let us accept it as a truth with all reverence and humility." Nelson extended his acceptance of the mutability of species into the spiritual realm. Following traditional Mormon opinion, he believed in a dual creation, both spiritual and temporal. For him this becomes a "dual evolution." Even "spirit species" evolved. Now whether God created but one such spiritual germ and produced all the other forms by modification afterwards or whether He created, let us say, many such original organisms, who shall tell? In any event why should there be bitterness about it? Whichever plan we assume one thing is fixed: it is God's way of transmitting the formless and limitless into the formed and the limited.51 Nelson has boldly adopted the central thesis of evolutionary theory and foreclosed any scriptural debate by proclaiming science as supreme in the discovery of the creative process. All the arguments about "after its own kind" are hereby swept aside in the profuse onrush of his system. He seems prepared to accept almost anything, give it a place in the eternal evolutionary system, and call the result Mormonism. The biological evolution of species was only a part of Nelson's system. An equally important part was an all encompassing theory of racial and social evolution. Nelson believed that the world's population could be divided into races and each race would have a role to play in the progressive evolution of mankind. As human society progressed, each race came to the fore as leaders fora season, soon to be followed by the next race in the developmental scheme. But what standard, what measure is to be used to judge the progress of races? Nelson selected a standard that would give precisely the answer that he wanted. The Declaration of Independence was for him the "noblest, most far reaching idea, if possible, which the race has yet conceived."52 This was his criterion of judgment. With this measuring rod in place he proceeded to divide up the human family into three great races descended from the sons of Noah, Ham, Shem, and Japheth. Each of these races had a special place in the evolutionary scheme. As expected, the descendants of Ham are the Asiatics and the Africans. These descendants are themselves lowest on the ladder of racial progress. They are permeated with the spirit of tyranny and slavery â the very antithesis of the "perfect law of liberty" embodied in mankind's greatest ideal. Heargued that the cultures of the old world created by the Hamitic race were all permeated with a perverse desire for despotism. The descendants of Ham are born with such a spirit; it is part of their nature: "No matter what age of the world they should have lived in their civilization would have been the same." Even the contemporary "hordes of Africa and Asia" still are permeated with this "slave tyrant spirit." The material culture of this race also attests to its inferioritv. "No sadder commentary on their mental inferiority is possible than the hovels they sometimes build from the crumbling fragments of princes, palaces and in the very halls of departed royalty." Clearly this race is not a people suited for the better lot of mankind that is to come.53 51Ibid., pp. 66, 71. "Ibid., p. 91. 53Ibid., pp. 94-96.</page><page sequence="21">Sherlock: The Darwinist Legacy 53 However, the race of Ham could not immediately depart the world stage in place of a leap to the highest level. An intermediate "compromise relationship" was necessary. This stage was occupied by the great civilizations of Greece and Rome and their descendants, chiefly the southern Europeans and the Latin Americans. According to him these civilizations were "dwellers in the tents of Shem." They received all that they had from the descendants of Shem since the Hamitic peoples had nothing of any value to give. These sons of Japheth certainly did not measure up very well against Nelson's standard: "Does any student of political science seriously believe that republics can flourish south of the Alps and the Carpathians?" For him the answer was obviously no. The sons of Japheth have had their hour upon the stage and the mantle has been passed to the last and noblestof all the races â the sons of Shem. The Hamitic peoples will remain as manual laborers and the sons of Japheth will be absorbed into the race of Shem; but the people of Shem have now taken over.54 Given his criterion of judgment, the result he gets is obvious. The people of Shem, the northern Europeans, are the "flower of mankind": "the last and noblest of the great races. Its glory has already eclipsed the combined glories of ancient world powers and the end is not yet. The base of this pyramid shall be supported by the Millennium itself, the kingdom of God on Earth." The American continent had been specifically reserved for this race to populate and on which it could develop the most noble ideas ever conceived by man. Finally when the time was ready, "the flower of Shem" appeared â the Mormon elders. "Tall and straight and comely, gifted with intellectual vigor and spiritual insight they are among the flower of Shem reserved tor this conflict with falsehood and artificiality." Mormonism has become a sub-race at Nelson's hand, one destined to rule the world as the final stage of social progress and racial development.55 Nelson's horizon encompasses so many diverse themes and arguments that it is impossible and unsuited for any paper to discuss them all. For example, his moral theory of the atonement or his idea of sin as that which stands in the way of further progress are each very important. Furthermore, his discussion of scripture as fallible because it is transmitted through a human medium and his insistence that all scripture must be viewed as "capable of indefinite organic expansion and application" are classic modernist ideas. All of these ideas deserve study in the context of his system. In a letter written President Joseph F. Smith after the publication of his book, Nelson proclaimed that his only purpose in writing it was "to make men and women think not of what the principles of Mormonism are merely but of what they mean in our lives."56These are the words of the modernist intellectual. The separation of eternal principles from changing and growing meaning was central to the project of reinterpreting the theological framework in order to take account of the evolutionary understanding of man and nature that was a large part of the intellectual heritage of the last half of the nineteenth century. 51Ibid., pp. 101-93. 55Ibid., pp. 97-98. 56N. L. Nelson to Joseph F. Smith, 5 January 1905, Joseph F. Smith Papers.</page><page sequence="22">54 Journal of Mormon History Though his system was vast, Nelson did not deal here with the story of Adam. He did seem to claim at one point that Adam came as a divinely directed being and that his physical body was the product of descent. But he hedged this in with the idea of even spirit species having evolved and the idea that whatever way it was it was God's way. He cannot be said to have dealt with Adam at any length. After his death, however, his son brought out a collection of his writings that discuss the Eden story in some detail. Briefly, he argued that the Garden story was "manifestly divine camouflage to satisfy the questioning spirit of man till his intellect should be ripe enough for the real story." As far as the natural world goes, this story is now being discovered by science. He argued at some length that the garden could not have been real but that the essential element, the idea of a fall, really did happen to a real Adam in a spiritual domain prior to his coming to Earth.57 In his work Nelson had clearly taken up the challenge of evolutionary thought. He developed a vast system of evolutionary theism clearly in harmony with theories very popular in his day. One may not think a great deal of Nelson's system â in some cases it is only a mass of bizarre speculations â but the attempt to deal with evolutionary thought in an open and all-encompassing framework is impressive. Moreover, his close friendship to President Smith suggests at least a hesitancy against closing off the speculative intellectual option represented by Nelson. W. H. Chamberlin : Philosophy, Evolution, and Faith The theological option that was picked up by Nelson was also picked up in a much more impressive fashion by his sometime colleague at BYU William Henry Chamberlin. Chamberlin's was, perhaps, the most impressive Mormon attempt to reconcile evolution and religion. Moreover he was one of the guiding spirits for a whole generation of young Mormon intellectuals who came of age in the generation after the Manifesto. It would be impossible to deal adequately with him and his work short of a paper itself. Here only the barest of sketches can be given of the way in which he was attempting to deal with the problems raised by the evolutionary understanding of nature, man, and history. Chamberlin had an impressive background for his work. In 1886 he entered the University of Utah, where he studied until 1889 when he left to earn money teaching in public schools. He returned to the University in 1891 and after five years finally obtained his B.S. From 1891 he taught science and math at LDS College in Salt Lake. Following a three-year mission to Tahiti, he returned to a temporary teaching position for the 1900-1901 year at Brigham Young College in Logan, teaching geology, then math. He spent two summer terms studying ancient languages and Biblical studies at the University of Chicago, and by the 1903-1904 school year he was made a professor of theology at BYC. In 1906 he obtained an M.A. in philosophy from the University of California under George Howison and in the school year 1907-1908 he studied at Harvard with Josiah Royce. From 1910 to 1916 he was professor of philosophy and ancient languages at BYU in Provo. In the summer of 1907 he had studied psychology at Chicago 57Nels Nelson, What Truth Is (Salt Lake City: Stevens and Wallis, 1947), pp. 54-60.</page><page sequence="23">Sherlock: The Darwinist Legacy 55 and at one point he taught all of the psychology classes at BYU. In 1916 he resigned from BYU and he spent the next year studying at Harvard. He returned to Utah and first taught at the University of Utah and then finally spent his last year, 1920-1921, as director of the theology program at Brigham Young College in Logan. He died in 1921 at the age of 50.58 Chamberlin's system was clearly modeled after his teachers' Howison and Royce. He was very fond of Howison, Royce, Bowne, and A. K. Rogers, and quoted from them frequently in his work: At a later time he studied writings of Henri Bergson, the great French vitalist. In the spring term of 1916 he gave a seminar at BYU on Bergson.59 Chamberlin was a convinced evolutionist who thought that he was going to be able to work out a systematic reconcilation of evolutionary thought and revealed religion on the foundation of personalistic idealism and its related cousin, the vitalism of Bergson. The heart of his position was in the emphasis he placed on divine immanence. For Cham berlin a basic belief was that nature isa living whole. For example he began a very important defense of evolution by exclaiming, "The world not only moves but it livesl It is involved in and is a part of a vast dynamic purposive process." The natural world around man was for Chamberlin a living whole, almost a living being itself, permeated with the spirit of God. He was extremely fond of the eighty-eighth section of the Doctrine and Covenants which speaks of "the light which is in all things, which giveth life to all things which is the law by which all things are governed, even the power of God who sitteth upon his throne who is in the bosom of eternity, who is in the midst of all th ings. "60 This passage is almost a summary of Chamberlin's thought. For Chamberlin the world of nature was a living whole that is in a very real sense the body of God. To be precise, God is not nature itself as a strict pantheism might hold. He is rather "in the midst of all things"; God is at work in and through nature. But God is not nature. This distinction is important for understanding Chamberlin. It allows for organic change in nature but not change in the purposes of God. The natural world evolved, under the control of the Divine Immanence who is working out His purposes in and through Nature.61 Chamberlin thought that "extra-human nature" (his term) manifested the same qualities as those that we label "personal." He called these qualities "attitudes," and he was convinced that nature manifested that collection of attitudes that are called a "person": "Nature has an organization that only a person is known to have." Basically these qualities are clustered around two poles. The first are those that are stable, subconscious, automatic â like breathing or the process of photosynthesis in plants. The second and most 58The basic biographical information is contained in Ralph Chamberlin, Life and Philosophy of W. H. Chamberlin (Salt Lake City: Deseret News Press, 1925). 59Ibid., p. 209. 60W. H. Chamberlin, "The Theory of Evolution as an Aid to Faith in God and Belief in the Resurrection," White and Blue 14 (14 February 1911); Doctrine and Covenants 88:13. White and Blue was the BYU student publication at the time, and Chamberlin was professor of ancient languages and philosophy at the school. 61The most important of his published writings in this regard is his Essay on Nature (Provo: Privately Printed, 1915).</page><page sequence="24">55 Journal of Mormon History important are those that reveal a purposeful response to other beings or to the inorganic environment. It is here that the qualities of purposefulness, self consciousness and self directed activity, crucial characteristics of a person, are most clearly shown in nature.62 The crucial evidence that Chamberlin presented to demonstrate that these qualities exist in nature was the evolution of species. He argued that the purposeful development of species in response to new conditions is a clear indication of the purposeful, self directed activity of "extra-human nature" as it adjusts its outward form to new conditions. A study of the way in which new species originate will even give us a glimpse of the tentative and often random efforts that arise in the formation of stable repeating attitudes or habits. The great similarities between the individuals of a species is significant of the repetitions so characteristic of the life of habit. But whenever or wherever physical changes of note have taken place in the history of the world, then and there, there has been as it were a struggle on the part of the Life of extra human nature to modify its adjustments so that externally viewed, new forms or species such as could live on in the changed and new stable environment have been produced.63 Nature is constantly involved in the creation of new physical forms in response to new and more complex situations. Perhaps the most challenging aspect of Chamberlin's system was that he considered this "extra-human nature" as God. This nature manifests all of the personal qualities that have traditionally been attributed to God and it is the source of individual human lives in much the same manner in which God is said to be the creator of man. Chamberlin said it is upon this God that we depend for our physical bodies that he has created through millions of years of activity. God furthermore is constantly at work calling forth more noble qualities from us, his children. He has engaged in numberless activities on our behalf such that "without much apparent effort on our part a large number of powerful and valuable habits have been formed in us." This activity of God is the measure of his love for us: "Through the development of such attitudes, God has shown his love for man, an eagerness to have him develop in more of his unique life, a reverence for his individuality, a desire to cultivate it."64 Chamberlin's God, like Nelson's, was constantly at work on behalf of the moral and spiritual growth of mankind. Newer and more noble ideals were continuously produced by God to call His children forward to the consumma tion in the Kingdom. He raised up prophets who embodied these ideals and pointed men toward the will of God.65 In the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus, God brought forth the perfect revelation of His will and the supreme motivation for living in accord with that will. The resurrection, which Chamberlin fervently believed in, was the central aspect of that motivation. The resurrection is the supreme source of motivation 62Ibid., p. 15. Â«Ibid., p. 19. 64Ibid., pp. 24, 27. 65For his ideas in this regard see ibid., p. 41, and also his tribute to Joseph F. Smith when the latter became church president, The Crimson 1 (17 December 1903):4-5; Chamberlin, Essay on Nature, p. 37.</page><page sequence="25">Sherlock: The Darwinist Legacy 57 for the moral life; faith in it will support our living in accord with the ideals of Christ as nothing else can. "The knowledge of the resurrection of the Lord gives us confidence to press on into the very difficult life of service until we have come to master it and thus know its matchless joys." Furthermore he thought that evolution would provide a firmer support for belief in the resurrection, and for theism in general. First, evolution provided a firmer support for theism than older views insofar as it supported belief in the immanence of God in nature. Secondly, he argued that the millions of years required to create the human body implied "a measureless interest in our welfare." Surely God would not destroy outright this "noble creation." Hence there is a strong prima-facie reason to expect a resurrection. In conclusion then let us repeat that if a Divine purpose is immanent in nature, nature s forms must be thought of as evolving in a way parallel to the unfolding of the Divine purpose. The use of the theory is a most important means of advancing to a realization of God's immanence in nature and life and a great remover of intellectual difficulties that hamper faith in so many. And finally the theory awakens within us from the above point of view an expectation of the resurrection, or a renewal of God's reactions to our lives, the restoration of the spirit to the body without which there can be little or no life or happiness. That God can do this seems certain and that he will do it is at least as certain as that the uniformity of nature that all science presupposes shall continue. Both the uniformities in nature and the resurrection depend upon the Father's love.66 Nature is the tabernacle of God through which he is working to bring to pass His ends. This is the fundamental religious outlook of Chamberlin's whole corpus of published essays and monographs. The life of man is the product of this wise and loving father who has created and continues to create the physical forms of the human body and the spiritual and moral ideals that guide our lives. This immanentes theology was perhaps best expressed in one of Chamberlin's favorite sections of Mormon scripture: "The worlds were made by Him; all things were made by Him and through Him and of Him." The year before his death Chamberlin expressed much of this same general view in what may be the most concise statement of his mature outlook: The greatest person of all, or God, abides through all changes a perpetual cause ot our experience of material nature. Thus the material elements, as they seem to hide their cause from our view, can be said to be the covering or tabernacle of God and vanishing human forms are elements of that tabernacle. . . . God is the fixed or eternal cause of most things visible or changing in material nature. And so anyone who has seen nature has in a sense seen God.67 To some the immanentes personalism of Chamberlin may not sound like Mormon orthodoxy. But such orthodoxy is notoriously difficult to define. If anything, the preceeding pages should have suggested the impossibility of defining a consistent standard of orthodoxy on the issues discussed here. Moreover Chamberlin could draw on some important parts of Mormon scripture 66W. H. Chamberlin, "The Significance of the Resurrection," White and Blue 16 (11 March 1913): 295. Also for his views on the significance of Christ, see The Parables of Jesus, Brigham Young College Bulletin, no. 2 (January 1904): 3; "A Christmas Message," White and Blue 16 (10 December 1912): 7; and An Essay on Nature, pp. 41-44; "The Theory of Evolution," p. 4. "Doctrine and Covenants 93:10; W. H. Chamberlin, The Life of Man: An Introduction to Philosophy (Logan: Privately Printed, 1920) p. 12.</page><page sequence="26">58 Journal of Mormon History and the writings of revered church leaders for support. He was particularly fond of sections 93 and 88 of the Doctrine and Covenants. These offer at least as much support for his views as other people have found in other sections of scripture for other views. He was also conversant with Parley P. Pratt's Key to the Science of Theology which contains a discussion oÃ­ the Holy Spirit not unlike his own theological system. Though Chamberlin never seems to have quoted him, Parley's brother Orson Pratt, in some of the most competent theological essays ever to come from a Mormon leader, discussed the idea of God in terms that could have been easily adopted by Chamberlin.68 Chamberlin s Mormon commitments were deep and genuine. No one who has read his mission journals, his early article in praise of Joseph F. Smith when he became church president, or some of the letters he wrote in 1917 after his last year at Harvard when he was looking to return to Utah could say otherwise. But his work was threatening on several fronts. First, the philosophical acumen was threatening to a religious leadership that wanted practical men, not speculative theologians. Such speculating would, in their eyes, only destroy the faith of the young; it would do no good in the conduct of life. But a deeper concern lies behind this argument. Mormonism was a religious system that had a unique impact on the lives of many common people. Mormon theological simplicity and scriptural literalism brought the central theological symbols and beliefs into the thought world of common people where they could be easily grasped and firmly held. The world of Chamberlin, sophisticated and philosophically intriguing though it was, posed a difficulty at this fundamental level. His work is subtle and not easy to understand. To encourage such work threatened, to some extent, the vitality of the community of faith. There is, however, another side to this issue, one that Chamberlin saw better than his antagonists. In an era when the choicest sons and daughters of the church were studying secular ideas and naturalistic sciences, more than simple answers were needed. Unless the great features of the Mormon theological system could be expressed in ways at least compatible with modern knowledge, would they be any match in the marketplace of ideas? Those who had tasted the wisdom of modern science needed more than facile answers, without a thorough analysis and defense of its beliefs, another kind of threat faced the community of faith and the commitment to it of these members would be tenuously maintained. Conclusion Leonard Arlington once argued that one of the major biases in the writing of Mormon history had been the picture of unity where the story was otherwise.69 If anything, this has nowhere been as true as in the writing on the history of Mormon ideas. Frequently the desire to see unity on important intellectual or theological issues has led to ignoring or distorting the evidence available from many sources. The response of Mormons to the challenge of evolutionary thought was as diverse as anything found outside of Mormondom. The spectrum 68His fondness for Parley Pratt appears in an unpublished essay sent to President Joseph F. Smith entitled "The Origin and Destiny of Man," in Joseph F. Smith Papers. Â® Leonard J. Arrington, "The Search for Truth and Meaning in Mormon History," Dialogue : A Journal of Mormon Thought 3 (Summer 1968):64.</page><page sequence="27">Sherlock: The Darwinist Legacy 59 of opinion in "Zion" was a microcosm of the spectrum of opinion in other religious communities and among American religious leaders and theologians in general. The Mormon segment of American religious life was more of a reflection of and less of an escape from the vicissitudes of the challenge of evolutionary thought in the post-Darwinian era. The tension between diversity and unity in communities and groups is as old as man himself. To a large measure diversity is healthy, for it prevents men from absolutizing their own private perspectives. But unless there is some unity, some set of beliefs, values, or loyalties common to all members of the group, the group will cease to exist. The profound diversity of Mormon reactions to evolutionary thought suggests an even deeper struggle with the increasing pluralism of twentieth century Mormonism. The conservatives wanted some firm standard, the literal word of scripture, as a guide and test of loyalty and orthodoxy. Their critics saw too much truth in modern thought to accept the conclusions of those who would deny it. The struggle of these two outlooks has been the agony of every major religious system in the modern west. Mormonism may have been less vociferous in its struggle but the agonizing dilemma has been no less real.</page></plain_text>
