If the work of the graphic artist, Linley Sambourne (1844-1910), strikes any chord today, it is because David Levine, late illustrator-in-chief to The New York Review of Books , seems to have been inspired by the broad linearity of his style. Spanning over four decades of Punch , from 1867 to 19 10, Sam- bourne's oeuvre marks a transitional phase between the more academic designs of the 'first cartoonist', John Tenniel, and the sketchy freedom of Frank Reynolds and Phil May, a sty- listic change facilitated by technical innovation. Tenniel con- tinued to draw directly onto the woodblock long after it was possible to effect the transfer through photographic means. By 1888 even Punch had adopted the new process technology and Sambourne 's drawings could be photographed onto the block, thus retaining the originals. Leonee Ormond's biography of Sambourne diligently chronicles the lifestyle of middle-class metropolitan man in the late Victorian era, one which has been admirably pre- served in the house he acquired on his marriage in 1875, *8 Stafford Terrace, Kensington, London, now open to the pub- lic. Convivially clubbable, a frequent guest on the weekend hunting and shooting parties of the rich, Sambourne also participated energetically in the new, fashionable outdoor pursuits, from river boating and coastline cruising to tennis, bicycling and excursions by motor car. Born the son of a City wholesale furrier, he spent a few months studying at the South Kensington School of Art before finding employment in a firm of marine engineers as a draughtsman. But acceptance by Punch'' s editor Mark Lemon of a drawing sent in by a friend 'on spec' changed the course of Sambourne's career. His trickle of submissions soon became a steady flow. In 1871 he was appointed as a regular member of Punch1 s staff and in 1878 was promoted to serve as second political cartoonist. PRINT QUARTERLY, XXVII, 2010, 4</page><page sequence="2">CATALOGUE AND BOOK REVIEWS Ormond describes the relentless grind of topical cartoon- ing that drove some artists like John Leech into an early grave. Sambourne got to learn of the subject of his 'big cut' by at- tendance at the Wednesday evening dinners where topics for coverage were usually decided, or on the following day or sometimes even Friday morning. The deadline for delivery of his drawings was Saturday, a week before the magazine's publication. The work of transferring the designs onto box- wood blocks was done by Joseph Swain's firm of skilled en- gravers, but the main pressure of time still fell on the artists, although Sambourne managed to alleviate this to some de- gree. By taking photographs of models and copying the re- sults he could shortcut the difficulties he experienced in drawing the human figure. With the help of this photo- graphic reference material, he worked through Friday until late in the evening. After finishing the outline he would shade the drawing using parallel thick or thin lines. Once it was dis- patched, the round of normal family life resumed. With maturity, Sambourne came to see his cartoons as part of the great tradition of English graphic satire that ex- tended from Hogarth to Cruikshank - and indeed as a young man he had met Cruikshank. Despite the collaborative nature of Punch editorial that underlay the big cuts, Ormond identi- fies features of Sambourne's output that made a distinctive contribution. Like many caricaturists before him, he was fas- cinated by women's fashions, which, in the Victorian period, needed little by way of exaggeration to provoke mirth. But often his observations were ingeniously entwined with a fan- tastical anthropomorphism. As Ormond points out, this doubtless reflected in part the unease of the age over Dar- win's publication of The Origin of Species - Ernest Griset, who worked for Punch between 1867 and 1869, explored the same theme - but Sambourne continued to mine it for decades. Another time-honoured trick of graphic satire was the parody of star works from the Royal Academy summer exhi- bitions. Sambourne's depiction of Gladstone being held down 'in the Irish sea of troubles' by John Morley is a partic- ularly effective 'Ulster-Marine Study' after Burne-Jones's The Depths of the Sea (1886). Other subjects were derived from well- known book illustrations: Wilful Wilhelm (1892) is a brilliantly apposite skit of Heinrich Hoffmann's Struwwelpeter in which the German Emperor throws a tantrum following Punch's publication of Tenniel's famous cartoon of Bismarck's dis- missal, Dropping the Pilot. Ormond argues that some of Sambourne's finest work was undertaken for Punch's annual 'Almanack' and other pub- lications, on which he could devote more time. He had reason to be proud of the designs he produced for such varied com- missions as the diploma given to prize-winners at the Inter- national Fisheries Exhibition, held in London in 1883, and for an invitation to the Lord Mayor's Banquet of 1888. He even produced an advertisement for Philip Morris cigarettes featuring a saucy señorita sitting on a champagne cork (Sam- bourne had something of a penchant for photographing nude young women and black-stockinged schoolgirls). But perhaps he is at his best, combining narrative clarity with a strong whiff of the grotesque, in his illustrations for the Macmillan edition of Charles Kingsley's The Water Babies published in 1885 and for tales by Hans Andersen executed in the late 1880s and early 1890s but only published posthu- mously in 19 10. Despite the lowly status accorded to graphic artists by the Royal Academy - black-and-white work could be exhibited but no artist working solely in the medium was elected an Ac- ademician - Sambourne had a highly successful one-man show of drawings at The Fine Art Society in 1893. He even distributed prints - presumably reproduced by process meth- ods - on China paper after such works as gifts for friends. He also kept up with artists associated with the Etching Revival: when in 1900 he was involved in choosing the medal winners from among the submissions of prints for the Fine Arts sec- tion of the Exposition Universelle in Paris, his choices were Frank Short, William Wyllie and Seymour Hayden. Finally, on i January 1901, he replaced Tenniel as Punch's first car- toonist, a position he was to hold until his death. Ormond has done justice to Sambourne's life and work, producing a well-rounded account of a significant, if largely forgotten, Victorian graphic artist.</page></plain_text>
