<plain_text><page sequence="1">PHYSICAL VERSUS HISTORICAL REALITY HENRY MARGENAU Summary. The science of the 19th and early 20th century permitted the view that all human experience is subject to the deterministic laws of physics. Reality was conformable with these laws, and the laws could be used to designate what is real. Recent discoveries, particularly the quantum theory and its uncertainty prin- ciple, have modified, though not suspended, the causal laws of physics, thereby establishing a looser correspondence of theory with all those elements of experi- ence in wvhich we confront "the given." A theory, still exact and deterministic in its own terms, is related to the realm of immediate experience by probabilities only. These probabilities are irreducible, despite the current tendency to deny them ultimate status or to explain them away by fanciful mechanistic arguments about "unavoidable interactions" between measuring apparatus and measured objects. Since, in view of this altered situation, physical laws no longer suffice to de- fine all of reality, a concern regarding that which escapes these laws must prop- erly arise. In the paper, this is called historical reality because the characteris- tics of history (in a large sense): incidence, spontaneity, being the last instance of factual appeal, etc., are so peculiar to it. The meaning of decision, which in- habits the historical and not the physical sphere, is tentatively examined and its relation to physical reality is discussed. Some pains are taken to analyze the sense in which probabilities in quantum physics are irreducible. This involves recognition and maintenance of a clear distinction between several kinds of probability, only one of which can serve as basis for the epistemology developed in this paper. 1. The quantum theory of modern physics is too rarely made the object of intensive study by the professional philosopher and the social scientist; it is regarded as an enfant terrible, difficult to understand completely yet vaguely amusing because of the odd things it says about the world. In some fundamental respects, however, this theory has an importance far beyond its usefulness in physics, for it develops a methodology applicable, though not yet applied, to phenomena typical in many fields far removed from the physical sciences. One sometimes hears the dogmatic suggestion that problems of biology, psy- chology, sociology, history, indeed all matters bearing upon collective human affairs, are immune to treatment by natural science because that science pre- supposes a kind of objectivity and invariability in the nature of its subjects which human intercourse does not exhibit. This doctrine ignores the fact that the quantum theory does deal successfully with just such collective vagaries as social science and biology present. It has a way of handling the "unpredictable interactions" between a fact and the knowledge of that fact, and furthermore it achieves a significant treatment of observations which, in a very real sense, may kill or annihilate the system under observation. There is a fair amount of litera- 193</page><page sequence="2">194 HENRY MARGENAU ture upon these questions. The present article considers the relevance of quan- tum theory to problems of the social sciences. In The Nature of Physical Reality (5) I have argued that the use of probabili- ties as essential tools in the description of nature has brought about a separation of our experience into two domains: one, composed of immediacies (observations, measurements) that are not all predictable in detail; and another, refined and rational, which is the locus of laws and regularities, of permanent substances, of conservation principles and the like. The former was called historical, the latter physical reality. At first sight the word "historical" may seem ill-chosen, for it suggests a tech- nical connection with a well-defined discipline. We mean it here in a looser sense which, it is hoped, historians will condone. Historical events, in so far as they differ from physical events at all, are characterized by these qualities above others: they are significant only when observed; they are rather aloof from the- ories; they usually involve human decisions. They lie close to the plane of im- mediacy, in the terminology of reference 5. Thus historical here means inci- dental, emergent; it designates that which simply happens.' The word is meant to carry a strong flavor of the "existential." To be sure, all these traits often adhere as well to the events which interest physicists, and they do not provide a completely satisfactory definition. But they will indicate the motive for our choice of words which may perhaps justify itself as our discussion proceeds.2 The distinction in question does not, it is true, effect a cleavage in our normal responses to the world about us, for physical reality is the best rational account, and the closest possible approach to a uniform description of, spontaneous fact. Indeed the main reason for our reluctance to recognize the distinction lies in the circumstance that ordinary experience hardly requires it: in most of our daily life the rational comes to the surface and meets the deliverances of sense with satisfying congruity. Only on examining the stranger phenomena in the atomic world does the disparity in question reveal itself; in that world exact laws dis- close their statistical character, and the novel manner in which they regulate observable facts becomes evident. Hence arise a number of questions which we here state and then attempt to answer. 1. What, precisely, is the character of the lawlessness of the microcosm? 2. What is the meaning of the laws of physics, and how do they bear upon the lawless events? In this connection attention must be given to the seeming para- dox arising from the fact that these laws do operate with dynamic precision in the macrocosm, while their functioning on an atomic scale is but statistical; in other words we must take occasion to study the gradual transformation of ' Support for this terminology may be found in the writings of many historians. "The problem of the historian is to tell what actually happened. The more clearly and completely he succeeds the more perfectly he has solved that problem. Straightforward description is the very first and essential requirement of his calling and the highest thing he can achieve." (3) 2 A most illuminating review of the various conceptions of what constitutes historical knowledge may be found in (1). Cassirer's analysis contains many suggestions to which the present article, in part, owes its origin.</page><page sequence="3">PHYSICAL VERSUS HISTORICAL REALITY 195 lawlesssness into regularity which occurs as we ascend the scale of sizes, times and masses. 3. Does history belong to the macrocosm, or do its roots reach down into the chaos of the microcosm? 4. If the latter is true-as I believe it is- what opportunity is there for constructing a causal theory of history? In particu- lar, can physical theory form a model after which a theory of history capable of prediction can be fashioned? In dealing with questions 1 and 2 we shall leave aside as much as possible the refined language of physics; we endeavor to sketch a picture of the atomic world with the broad strokes of a brush, a picture admittedly surrealistic but faithful, it is hoped, to the fundamental issues involved in our problem. Question 2 will force us to consider the meaning of probability. The remaining questions are wholly epistemological; their answers depend on some of the specific information gained from an analysis of the former two. In discussing atomic phenomena I shall endeavor to dispense with abstractions and to inject some of the vividness which the atomic world actually possesses. I hope I may be forgiven for an account in the following section that may seem like popularization. 2. The Lawlessness of the Microcosm. Let us transport ourselves to the world of atoms. In doing so we are not considering the use of wholly phantastic arte- facts like flying carpets or time machines which nobody can construct; we are merely supposing our sense organs to be replaced by more sensitive devices which the electronic engineer can actually build. These devices will allow us to perceive very small distances, very short intervals of time and extremely light objects. When observed with this equipment, the microcosm turns out to be a strange place indeed. Perhaps its most striking feature is the failure of visual continuity: the world is not illuminated and filled with moving things; our eyes are now sensitive to the single darts of light (photons) cast off by single luminous atoms, and the effect is a speckled kind of vision with bright patches emerging here and there from utter darkness, the different patches having different durations. Distant objects of large size and mass have a kind of uniform glow, to be sure, and suggest some cohesion in this chaotic scheme of things, but the smaller things nearby give very little indication of uniformity or pattern. It is doubtful whether an observer whose experience is limited to this micro- cosm would find it plausible to speak of the "flow of time" rather than the "emer- gence of sensed intervals." Continuous space would seem a far-fetched abstrac- tion, and our observer would be unlikely to claim that objects-if indeed he were to attribute appearances to the presence of objects-had definite positions at definite instants of time. Certainly he would have no occasion to invent the calculus. Nevertheless, as was already indicated, this world contains some measure of coordination. Patches of light are not completely random but appear in loosely ordered sequences. There are times when nothing can be seen, and then again the visual field is dotted with perceptions. Furthermore, these perceptions often indicate a preferred location in space, though they rarely mark a point. In</page><page sequence="4">196 HENRY MARGENAU view of this our micro-physicist would probably be led to postulate the existence of some sort of objects, vaguely localizable in space and somehow progressing from one place to another. But having never seen a completely continuous path he would not regard them as "moving" in the ordinary sense. Indeed the idea of continuous motion might be as difficult to conceive under these circumstances as is the notion of discontinuous emergence in our molar world. But let us accept the existence of external objects with masses, charges, perhaps colors, position- when-seen, momentum-when-encountered and many other measurable proper- ties. None of these could be said to be "possessed" by, or to adhere uniformly to the objects in the simple way we infer from our familiar experience. There are however, elaborate operational procedures by means of which these properties can be determined. These will now be considered. To learn in a pleasant way some of the peculiarities of the microcosm we go on a rabbit hunt. Experience has taught us that there are atomic rabbits, and we invent and use an atomic gun. The task of hitting the animal is not as simple as it is in our world since we see neither the rabbit nor the impact of our bullets. But there are ways of telling whether the quarry has been struck: a certain re- action takes place which, for the sake of simplicity, we shall assume to be an elementary squeak emitted by the dying victim. Forearmed with such knowledge and a gun we arrive at the hunting ground and wait until the darts of vision characteristic of a rabbit's presence appear in our field of perception. We aim at the region of their most frequent occurrence, preferably at the last identified rabbit flash, pull the trigger and hope for the squeal. It does not come the first time, of course, but we repeat the performance until the animal is struck. Just how we are going to find the corpse and bag it are difficult questions which, for our purposes, need not be answered. Let it be noted, however, that all the implements and processes we are invoking have possible atomic analogs which the physicist will recognize after a little thought. With practice certain rules for successful hunting are acquired. A shotgun works better than a rifle. This will occasion no surprise to our macrocosmic minds, except insofar as the advantage of the gun over the rifle is far greater than merely the greater number of projectiles in the shot cartridge would suggest. It turns out, surprisingly, that the larger bore of the gun makes its use more expedient. On further experimenting with a rifle we find careful aiming to be useless; a Jine gauge precisely directed at the target increases the scatter of the bullets and does not improve the aim. On noting this curious result we perform experiments; we shoot rifles of different gauges at a stationary target and observe their impacts. Large stationary targets do in fact exist (see below) and impacts can be made observable by the use of bullets which explode, i.e., emit light, on striking. Normal bullets, which we employed in our rabbit hunt, do not have this useful property. By experimenting in this way we discover the famous uncertainty principle. It states that a relation between the pattern of impacts on the target and the size of the rifle bore does in fact exist, but the relation is the reverse of what macroscopic common sense would lead us to expect: the finer the bore the greater is the dispersion of the bullets.</page><page sequence="5">PHYSICAL VERSUS HISTORICAL REALITY 197 Closer study of the impact pattern leads to further interesting observations, in particular to the surprising result that the distribution of shots is not the one suggested by the "error law" but by the diffraction of ordinary light passing through a diaphragm. We have thus come to recognize the existence of regulari- ties in the aggregate of events despite the apparent lawlessness of individual occurrences. If theories are to be devised to account for such happenings, they will have to concern themselves with aggregates rather than with single events. For the present, however, we put theories aside and return to the vagaries of the micro- cosm. We note in passing that hunting elephants is a good deal easier than hunting rabbits. These beasts give a more coherent account of their presence. While they do not produce a continuous progression in our field of vision, their seen emergence nevertheless dots a fairly uniform path. Also, use of an elephant gun with a large bore and more massive bullets reduces the scatter of the shots and makes the chase much more worthwhile. From sports we turn to science. Galileo would have found it difficult to dem- onstrate to the inhabitants of the atomic world the validity of the laws of free fall. In transferring his experiments to the microcosm, we again take note of the fact that there are no continuously visible small bodies. Furthermore, re- membering the erratic behavior of the individual rabbit, we consider it wise to deal at once with a large collection of objects. Hence we do what, macroscopically speaking, would be called gathering a handful of stones. True, this figure of speech is hardly descriptive of our exact procedures. For the stones are but in- termittent patches of luminosity, and to confine them to the space of our hand is a difficult task. When transferred to the hand they are not densely packed nor do they stay at rest; all indications are that they jostle and bounce about, and there seems to be no way of quieting them down. This unruly collection of bodies is dropped from a place high above ground, perhaps from some microcosmic leaning tower, and their progress is carefully recorded. It is impossible, as we have seen, to trace a single stone, our record being a multiplicity of individual light emissions. Yet there is some semblance of coherence, especially to an observer far away who is unable to distinguish the light flashes coming from individual stones. To him the falling group has the appearance of a swarm of fireflies which is clustered fairly tightly at the beginning but diffuses into a larger and larger assemblage of luminous dots as it approaches the ground. When all the facts are gathered our observer reports: 1. He was unable to trace unambiguously the path of any individual stone. (This is hardly news to us now, after our experience of hunting rabbits.). 2 The center of the swarm seemed to move with an acceleration of 32.2 ft./sec2, i.e., in perfect ac- cord with the macroscopic law of falling bodies. 3. The swarm grew larger and thinned out as time went on. At this point we, who are accustomed to the regular behavior of falling rocks, are strongly tempted to read their regularity into the microcosm. Every stone, we are prone to say, obeyed the laws of motion exactly as it fell. The reason why we failed to observe it are not hard to see. First, we only caught glimpses of an individual stone and did not trouble to reconstruct its complete path.</page><page sequence="6">198 HENRY MARGENAU Second, it was admitted that the stones were not at rest in the beginning. Hence the initial conditions of motion were different for different individuals and their spreading during the fall should have been expected. And thus we go on to assert with apparent safety: If we had known the velocity and the position of every particle at the moment of its release we could have calculated its path, and the whole firefly phenomenon could have been predicted. The argument just stated attempts a mechanistic denial of atomic uncertainties. It considers motions as essentially continuous, unique and determinate, and it blames other physical agencies for the vagaries manifest in observations. Before turning to the specific forms of the argument, I wish to examine it on general philosophic grounds and appraise its value as a methodological directive. The argument is an extrapolation of familiar molar experience. It is highly questionable, however, whether an observer familiar with the ways of the micro- cosm would have need for an hypothesis of detailed predictability, and conse- quently whether an investigator who regards the atomic world as primary should properly be disposed to make it. Perhaps these are matters of methodological preference. Let us therefore see what the argument nets us in the way of ad- vantages, or of simplicity of description. Practical advantages, aside from a certain satisfaction to our intuition, do not result from the hypothesis that atomic uncertainties are due to mechanical agencies. No theory has yet been proposed to render the vagaries understandable in detail, none is able to predict them. Indeed Heisenberg's principle, when dis- engaged from the "explanations" with which physicists so liberally suffuse it, says precisely that such predictions are impossible. With respect to simplicity, the case against the mechanistic argument is even stronger. There is a parallel to it in the old theory of the ether, which we here briefly recall. This theory made, in effect, two assertions. One was that space is a medium capable of transmitting electrical and gravitational influences; the second was more particular and insisted in assigning the familiar properties of material media to the ether field. Every student of the history of science knows the difficulties and the controversies which ensued because of the tenacious belief on the part of physicists in what at the time appeared to be common sense, the materiality of the ether. The hypothesis was finally discarded because the models invented to account for the behavior of the medium violated every canon of conceptual simplicity. Quite analogously, the facts of the microcosm are now being explained, first by the postulate that there are, indeed, permanent entities called electrons, protons and so forth; to this, the scientist who argues for the reduction of atomic uncertainties in terms of insufficient knowledge, unforeseen interactions and the like, adds the further thesis that the postulated entities have the familiar mechanistic properties of our more primitive experience. This latter thesis complicates matters needlessly; unless it is eliminated we may waste time in wrestling with problems whose very artificiality, like the structure of an ether molecule half a century ago, belies their importance. Neither of the last two italicized propositions is obvious in the sense of strict empiricism. The imputation of permanent existence to an atomic stone that</page><page sequence="7">PHYSICAL VERSUS HISTORICAL REALITY 199 reveals its presence only in the manner of the firefly, indeed with lesser consistency than a firefly, is already a posit not wholly forced by the observations. This assumption, however, has proved helpful and is incorporated in all valid theories of nature. Assignment of exact position at all times, which is demanded by the mechanist, is another, in fact a more risky hypothesis, as is shown by the cir- cumstance that no theory embracing it has as yet succeeded. This latter hypothe- sis must be abandoned. The position taken here can be supported to some extent on purely operational grounds: the position-at-all-times of an atomic particle cannot be found directly by observation, no operation for tracing the detailed trajectory of an electron being known. Thus far an appeal to experimental feasibility can be trusted. But operationalism, as always, is not the whole criterion of scientific validity. In this instance it would indict likewise the first postulate concerning the con- tinued identity of electrons, which cannot be observed directly either. The point here is that validity in science relies also on principles beyond those contained in the doctrine of operationalism, as is shown in extenso in (1). A particularized version of the argument we are criticising is the following. Granted that the luminous spots accompanying what is called the motion of a microsmic stone (e.g., an atom) do not mark a simple continuous path. The reason -says the argument-is to be seen in the unavoidable recoil momentum imparted to the stone by the photon it emits. This causes it to zigzag in a peculiar manner, the corners of its path being made luminous by emissions. If the explanation stops at this point it is innocuous, for it adds nothing of scientific or cognitive value to the patent unpredictability of the stone's behavior. If the argument goes on to give directions for computing the trajectory, it fails. The idle theory which endeavors to restore continuity by cryptic supplementa- tion of observable facts can take other forms. For instance, if the stone is not self-luminous but perceived by reflected light, the theory can say that the reflected photon disturbed its motion unpredictably; if the stone manifests its presence by collison with another object, the latter can be blamed. Nature's perversity seems forever to prevent the theory from becoming specific or, as I should pre- fer to put it, seems always to grant it a hiding place. Man's inability to trace the path of atomic objects is grounded in something far more serious than ignorance; its roots lie in actual indetermination of per- ceptions. In the case of an ordinary firefly, observed as moving from its scintilla- tions in the dark, ignorance of intermediate positions does not prevent their interpolation and hence a construction of its path. The situation with respect to the atom is completely different; interpolation will not work however cleverly it be conceived. What, then, has happened to our argument which ran: If we knew the velocity and position of every particle at the beginning of its fall ...? It is useless, for according to our best present understanding we never shall know these things. To say that under these wholly impossible circumstances the particle would obey the laws of free fall is quite the same as asserting: If the world were populated by angels there would be no wars. And finally, it should be pointed out that the</page><page sequence="8">200 HENRY MARGENAU argument, even when accepted, will not account correctly for the spreading of the swarm of stones as it "falls." This involves what physicists call "diffusion of a wave packet" and has no macrocosmic counterpart. It is thus necessary to take the lawlessness of the microcosm as it affects individual objects at its face value, to desist from trying to embellish it. But it is quite essential that we recognize the regularity-in-the-mean exhibited by the center of the swarm of stones as it fell. Yet, how are these facts to be reconciled? What is it in the individual particle that makes it obey laws of the aggregate? Does it know what the other particles are doing and behave in rela- tive conformity with them? Is an attracting force holding all particles together while some sort of individualistic repulsion keeps them apart? Science holds neither of these specific suppositions to be adequate. It proceeds on the most neutral plane that will join regularity-in-the-mean with individual caprice; it assigns neither purposes nor forces, but colorless probabilities as innate qualities to the microcosmic stones. This, it may be shown, is the least committal and the most effective thing to do in such circumstances. However, before studying prob- abilities, as we do in the next section, we return for another look at this elemen- tary atomic world which we now inhabit. Astronomical objects far away appear and behave like the bodies of our molar experience, as indeed they should, since they are the things we ordinarily en- counter. Quantum theory accounts for this by showing that probabilities congeal to certainties when the masses in question become large. Large masses, therefore, do possess positions at all times and continuous paths to a very high degree of approximation. Nor is there a contradiction in this, or a mystery in the trans- formation of probabilities into near-certainties. An illustration of such a trans- formation which can be visualized is a loaded die. As the load is increased and the weight placed nearer and nearer one surface, the die's behavior becomes in- creasingly regular and predictable. The laws of optics in the microcosm-to take one final example-are as peculiar as those of mechanics. On heating a large body it is found to glow, not with uni- form incandescence, but with pointlike luminous spurts of different colors. As the temperature is raised, the bluer ones begin to predominate at the expense of the redder scintillations. No law suggests what color will appear at a given point at any specified time, but in the aggregate the color distribution agrees with Planck's law at every instant. A small object (a single atom), too, may be subjected to heat treatment and become self-luminous. But the light it emits is not continuous; it reminds even more strongly of a firefly in the dark, except that now the emissions are in different colors. No rule governs the details of the color sequence, yet in the long run the frequency of the individual colors obeys the laws of quantum theory. It may surprise us, however, that every elementary kind of body has its own assortment of colors by which it can be identified, the irregularity of sequence notwithstanding. These examples may be regarded as fairly typical of the microcosm. They defy lawful description when attention is focussed on emergent, incidental, per- ceptual detail, yielding orderly pattern only when treated en masse.</page><page sequence="9">PHYSICAL VERSUS HISTORICAL REALITY 201 3. Reality in the Microcosm. Having learned this lesson we return to our ac- customed sphere. Our bewildering experience will be summed up in the simple question: What things are real in the atomic world? On the molar scale of magni- tudes a similar reflection hardly arose. What we saw was describable by continu- ous processes and by accurate laws. Perception was predictable, the emergent and the incidental were merely unrecognized features on the one regular face of nature. Atomic nature presents two faces and therewith a dilemma. Or is there no dilemma? Suppose you saw an airplane in the sky and identified it as a B29. You look away, and after a moment you observe it again, noting to your astonishment that it is a Thunderbolt. After a while you observe it once more to be a B29. Would you not conclude that you were mistaken at least once about the identity of the plane? Nevertheless, as sense impressions, all three observations may have been real enough; so real that each might have been the occasion for a definite course of action under critical circumstances. If you discredit any of them it is not because it is less real as an observation, but be- cause it is incompatible with the detailed lawfulness of nature, which does not allow a B29 to transform itself into a Thunderbolt spontaneously. In the micro- cosm there is no such lawfulness in detail, and the criterion for rejecting an individual observation as incompatible with others does not exist. Hence we repeat the question: What is real, the individual darts of the microcosmic fire- flies, or whatever inheres in them to make the aggregate of darts conform with laws? Perhaps both are real. Admitting this without qualification, however, is fatal to the proper understanding of large branches of modern physics, and it obscures whatever significance already formulated deductive science may have for other disciplines. In short, failure to make a distinction is an invitation to ignore a problem. Nor has the problem in fact been overlooked by theoretical physicists. Their voices, however, are discordant, often reflecting deep esthetic convictions, sometimes philosophic preconceptions, and occasionally disregard of basic philo- sophic issues. Three different responses are on record: the answer of the ration- alist who favors the coherent aspects of our experience and regards them as pri- marily accented with reality; the plea of the positivist who recognizes the schism but limits his reality to observations, relegating to theory a secondary importance commensurate with its auxiliary function as handmaid to fact; finally, there is the council of the skeptic who, acknowledging the schism, sees in it an indication of error in our fundamental theories of nature. Representatives of the last- mentioned attitude are in the minority. Clearly, we cannot deal with their posi- tion because it will not grant the validity of modern science, which we are ac- cepting (without prejudice, of course, to future improvements of its structure). The other two answers bear responsible messages; partial, to be sure, but complementary. We wish to analyze them against the background of procedures actually used in science. This is best done, perhaps, by considering specific examples. Every observation, every measurement, indeed every perception introduces errors. A measurement without error is an absurdity. Let the measurement</page><page sequence="10">202 HENRY MARGENAU (and measurement is after all only refined perception) be of a star's position in the sky, of the length of this table, of an automobile's speed, or of an electric current; its outcome is never to be believed exactly. This is apparent in the circumstance that the same number will not ordinarily result when the measure- ment is repeated, regardless of the care taken in performing it. Characteristically, only the careless experimenter and the ignorant observer believe raw nature to be unambiguous. To be sure, the different numbers found by the astronomer for the latitude (and longitude) of a star in successive observations lie within a rea- sonable interval, and this convinces him that he is somewhere near a "true" value of the quantity he seeks, that nature is not fooling him with hallucinations. Yet in a very fundamental sense he is witnessing a behavior not unlike the law- less emissions of the microscopic firefly; we thus see that the macrocosm is not wholly without its vagaries, but that it confines them sufficiently so that the observer with some credulity can feign their absence: he can blame himself for nature's equivocality and call the departures from a true value "errors." But what is the true value? Let us look into scientific practice. If ten measure- ments of a physical quantity yield ten slightly different values, not one of them is necessarily regarded as true. Their arithmetic mean is singled out for this distinction, even though it may not have occurred among the measurements.3 The justice of this choice is not provided by the ten measurements, nor by any finite number of observations; it comes from a belief in, or rather the postulation of, a certain uniformity of nature. Thus the very determination of a true value, and in the end the selection of whatever is believed to be true perceptory fact, involves a reference to law and order not immediately presented in the sensory structure of that fact. Here we find the clearest expression of the attitude which has led to the development of deductive science: it relies upon rational elements to straighten out erratic data. It does not ignore the latter's presence, nor does it accept them unrefined. It distills from them an essence and calls it true. But the nature of the essence is partly determined by the process of distillation. Now it is this true value which science takes to be characteristic of its reality. If an electron be real, its charge and mass are assumed to be true values in the outlined sense, whether or not they have occurred in any measurement. The real iceberg is not the exposed portion which the sailor sees; it is a largely unseen object compounded of the truths extracted from former observations and joined by postulations. The farther something is removed from immediate perception, as in the case of atomic entities or the facts of ancient history, the more dependent is its real character upon the lawfulness of the content in which it appears; it is real if that content is true. And here again, true does not neces- sarily mean "observed," anymore than it does in the process of measurement. It means "inferred from observations," and the nature of an inference, a word too often carelessly used, far transcends observations. What is physically real is rather close to the ideal. 8 The use of the arithmetic mean is proper when the errors may be assumed to be distrib- uted in accordance with the Gauss law. For more complicated instances this simple pro- cedure is not adequate. See (2).</page><page sequence="11">PHYSICAL VERSUS HISTORICAL REALITY 203 Truth does not imply finality. The term is not to be taken in an extravagant metaphysical sense but signifies simply the best available. Truth may change. The scientist readily admits that he never knows a true value with infinite pre- cision. This right to maneuver gives him the advantage he needs in rationalizing his observations, in making the best of an equivocal nature pitted against him- self, an agent with rational propensities which force him to construct reality in accordance with rules. A similar lesson can be drawn from many other instances. Real entities have often been inferred from lacunae in natural order before their existence could be certified by the standards of empirical science. Elements were predicted from gaps in the periodic table, planets because of irregular movements of known heavenly bodies; radio waves owed their conception as real constituents of nature to the simplicity of the equations of electromagnetism which implied their existence. The most significant advances of modern physics were motivated, or at least anticipated, by conjectures based upon the neatness of our universal laws; cases in point are the discoveries of the positive electron, the neutron and several types of meson. The whole case of the neutrino rests upon the empirically slender premise of valid conservation laws: this particle simply has to exist if the principles of energy, momentum and spin are to be retained. Yet it has never been seen in the sense that other elementary particles have been observed. There is good evidence that it can never be seen, and even this consideration does not count against its admissibility as a component of real nature. How can such generosity be countenanced except by granting that the real draws its sustenance in large measure from a belief in the lawfulness of the cosmos? The same sentiment finds its expression in the philosophic view which identi- fies the real with the elements of our experience that are causally connected in time and space. Current doctrines of materialism, relativity, much of causality are reared upon this rationalistic credo. Hence it is safe to say-and this is one of the theses supporting the remainder of the present discussion-that physical science would lose its hold on reality if an appeal to law and order were inter- dicted as a major claim. We have seen, however, that lawfulness is at a premium in the perceptory realm of the microcosm. There, regularity is found primarily in aggregates, or, when assigned back to individual events, in the probabilities which inhere in these events. Laws govern these probabilities, they do not govern single occur- rences. To be in harmony with the spirit of physical science we must therefore accept a conclusion unpalatable to many thinkers of the past, the conclusion that probabilities are endowed with a measure of reality. What this means in de- tail and what pitfalls must here be avoided will be analyzed in the following section. Now we do not claim that it is fair to put these arguments in reverse, i.e. to pronounce events resistant to lawful description, unreal. The perception of a single dart of light certainly happens, and the lawful multitude is made up of them. The fact of an hallucination is real and may be of great historical impor- tance. Non-predictability hardly lessens the practical significance of certain</page><page sequence="12">204 HENRY MARGENAU unique occurrences both in the microcosm and the macrocosm. But the point is that they arrange themselves within the structure of our cognitive experience in a manner different from the simple order envisioned by traditional laws of nature. To reconcile these disparities, and to accentuate their presence, I have ad- vocated in "The Nature of Physical Reality" a distinction between physical and historical reality.4 It seems to me that the need for this illuminating division is very great indeed, not only for the sake of terminology but also as a means for stating clearly what science can and what it cannot do. The data of immediate experience always belong to the latter sphere, the enduring entities of physics always to the former. But the spheres often overlap. In the macroscopic world they are nearly coincident, for the seen trajectory of a molar missile is also de- scribable by the laws of mechanics (to take the simplest example). This accounts for the unimportance of our distinction in classical physics. In the microscopic realm, however, the two spheres break apart and science becomes obscure unless this break is noticed. 4. Probabilities.5 Single events, as we have seen by studying the world of atoms, have in general only probabilities for occurring. In special cases, particularly in cases involving objects of ordinary size, these probabilities take on values very close to 1 and thus reduce to certainties. But let us consider an elementary par- ticle (our former rabbit) for which experience indicates that the probability of its being in a given place cannot be 1 for any finite interval of time. Physical laws predict its mean position in a number of observations; for any given posi- tion they indicate a probability only. Now suppose an observation is made and the particle is seen at a definite place. Must we not conclude that at the moment of observation the object was surely at the place where it was seen? And if we grant this much, are we not driven to admit certainty for its position at one instant? Expressing our suspicion more formally, we seem constrained to say: the act of observing the particle has caused the probability of its position, which was less than 1 prior to the observation, to jump suddenly to the value 1 during the act of observation. This consequence expresses an orthodox view, widely accepted and emphasized in a number of textbooks on quantum mechanics. If correct, it raises difficulties with some of the remarks made in the earlier parts of the present paper, and indeed with some of the basic axioms of quantum theory. For instance, it would be preposterous on this view to subject probabilities to physical laws-the dis- continuous change during observation being precisely the feature that defies these laws. The advantage of using probabilities as regular, and as real, entities arose from their immunity to such erratic changes, and the result now tentatively reached once more injects lawlessness into them. The gain sought is thus de- stroyed. 4For a different but compatible presentation of the same state of affairs, see (4). 5This section deals with slightly more technical matters arising from an assignment of physical reality to probabilities. They must be faced if the view here presented is to be acceptable. Readers interested only in the main argument may well omit this part.</page><page sequence="13">PHYSICAL VERSUS HISTORICAL REALITY 205 This is not the only defect of the view under consideration. If it is valid, there is no sense in talking about probabilities at all. For it is then obvious that a single observation can determine a supposedly erratic property exactly. Hence the initial conditions in any problem of motion are ascertainable (remember the example of the falling particle!) and experiment will always prove our theory to be in error.6 Instead of providing a valid theory, the notion at issue can only demonstrate that none is attainable. It also implies that, whenever an observation is made, physical reality sud- denly transforms itself into historical reality. There is no a priori reason why such a transformation should not occur; however, the mathematical features of this conversion are most perplexing and, we feel, objectionable. Suppose that we have given a charged particle an exact momentum by sending it through an accelerating chamber equipped with diaphragms. We then know precisely in what direction and with what speed it is going, but we cannot say at all where it is. The probability of position for this particle has the same small value everywhere. Now let a measurement of the particle's position be made, perhaps by noting the point at which a silver grain is blackened (after development) on a photo- graphic plate. According to the thesis under criticism we must then say: the probability after the measurement is zero everywhere except near the position of the blackened grain. Thus as physical reality, the probability extended through all of space, like a continuous medium devoid of matter. It formed in fact a field. At the instant of observation this field proceeds to vanish everywhere in space and concentrates itself as historical reality upon a point, where it takes on an infinite density. And all this because some human being chose to make an observation! Aside from the miraculous features of this theory, one wonders whether it was designed to deal with the physics of particles or the psychology of perception. The confusion and the welter of contradictions accompanying the thesis stated in the earlier italicised paragraph of this section disappear when we avoid a simple error in our understanding of the term probability. To discover the error we consider a familiar example. 6 Textbooks obviate this conclusion by admitting that some initial properties are indeed ascertainable exactly, but not the full complement needed for a determination of the mo- tion. This is prevented by the uncertainty principle. In the problem of the falling body, for instance, the initial position can be measured with accuracy, but then the momentum can be determined with no precision at all, according to the textbook version. But there is a misunderstanding here. The uncertainty principle says this: If the position of the particle at a given time is known with certainty, i.e., if its condition is such that a series of position measurements may be presumed to give nearly the same answer, then the error in the momentum measurement is infinite, i.e., a series of momentum measurements would yield extremely erratic answers. The principle says nothing about happenings in single observa- tions; in particular it does not assert the impossibility of simultaneous position and momen- tum measurements. Nothing prevents such measurements from succeeding in the sense of yielding numbers, which is what measurements are meant to do. The uncertainty principle warns that these numbers have no significance in determining the dynamic state of the particle. The view we are about to present leads to exactly this conclusion and avoids the annoying self-contradictory issues sometimes encountered.</page><page sequence="14">206 HENRY MARGENAU The physical condition of a regular die may be specified in many ways, some more complete than others. The die might be described as having a certain mass, shape and size. It might be said to have six equal black faces with white dots on them. Another perfectly good way is to assign the probabilities for the appearance of the numbers from 1 to 6 when the die is thrown at random. These are well known to have the value 1/6 each. We repeat, knowledge of these six equal numbers is just as significant with respect to the intrinsic nature of the physical object, the die, as the knowledge that it has six equal faces or that it has a cer- tain mass and size. These parcels of information are not equivalent, to be sure; but each can serve as a basis for the prediction of certain physical occurrences. The psychological stigma of incomplete knowledge which we habitually attach to probabilities must be erased. Let us fix our attention on these probabilities. Suppose the die is thrown and a five appears. According to the reasoning em- ployed in the italicized paragraph above, the former probabilities (1/6, 1/6, * 1/6), for the numbers 1, 2 ... 6 have now suddenly changed to (0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0). Still it is obvious that the physical characteristics of the die have not been altered by the incident of the throw, and the reader doubtless has an uneasy feeling that the meaning of the word probability has shifted during this discourse. Clearly, here is what happened. Initially we meant by probability the quality of the die by virtue of which the results of a long series of throws, say n in number, will contain n/6 ones, n/6 twos, and so forth. In the end we meant by probability the degree of certainty of our knowledge with respect to the outcome of a particular throw. These two are not the same logically, and the confusion incurred earlier was occasioned by our mistaking them to be identical. Their difference is well understood in the theory of probability, where the dis- tinction between the frequency interpretation and its counterparts (Laplacian, a priori definition and others) is fully recognized. If we stick consistently to the frequency interpretation, a single throw, or any number of throws, alter nothing so long as the physical character of the die remains unchanged, and the conclusion reached above is fallacious. On the certainty-of-knowledge interpretation the conclusion follows. Now the certainty-of-knowledge interpretation in the present form is not ten- able because it is hopelessly indefinite. To be acceptable it requires a statement of the evidence to which the knowledge relates. Probability becomes a function of two variables: the event considered and the evidence available. If the evidence is confined to the normal properties of the die, the probability for throwing a five is 1/6; if it includes knowledge that the thrower habitually cheats and has a way of getting sixes, the probability is less than 1/6; if the throw has already occurred and has yielded a five, and if its outcome is included in the evidence, all other evidence becomes irrelevant and the probability is clearly 1. Strictly speaking, all these probabilities are different physical entities and must not be confused. Hence, if the degree-of-knowledge interpretation is to be employed the evidence variable must be held constant during its use; in our example, evi- dence must be restricted to knowledge of the normal properties of the die, noth- ing smuggled in en route. But then the two interpretations agree, the probability</page><page sequence="15">PHYSICAL VERSUS HISTORICAL REALITY 207 does not change when the die is thrown and the dilemma is avoided. Hence- forth, we shall employ the frequency definition of probability, as is customary in most scientific work. It will be called the objective interpretation. Description of physical states in terms of probabilities need not have the triv- ial character exhibited by the ordinary die, whose properties may be specified by writing: P1 = P2 = * = P6 = 1/6. Here the probabilities Pi for throwing the numbers i are constant in time. The die can, however, be imagined to have an internal structure which changes in time. Suppose for definiteness that it is hollow and contains a sprocket with a small weight at its end. The other end of the sprocket is fixed to an axle extending parallel to an edge through the center of the cube, and this axle is driven by a small clockwork. We now have a strangely loaded die, but one in which the load revolves when the motor goes. The proba- bilities Pi are functions of the time. If the mechanism is known these probabil- ities can be calculated; the reverse, however, is not true. Quantum mechanics asserts that there is no mechanism, that the probabilistic behavior is in the na- ture of the physical object and is ultimate. Yielding nonetheless to our propensity for mechanical models we could invest our die with further appliances. Let us assume that the sprocket can be set in one definite position by some manipulation from the outside which does not in- terfere with its being thrown. The same operation also starts the clockwork. We shall speak of this operation as "activating the die." Normally the die is in a stationary state, its probabilities are constants in time. After activation they become functions of the time. How can we determine the variable probabilities by measurement? If the die is known to be in a stationary state it may be thrown a sufficient number of times and the relative frequencies can be computed. Otherwise, more elaborate pro- cedures are required. Merely repeating throws will not do when the die is ac- tivated, because different throws then catch it in different internal states, and a computation of relative frequencies is meaningless. Two correct methods for determining the probabilities in their time dependence are at hand. One is to activate the die, wait a time t and throw it; repeat this procedure many times, always observing the interval t before a throw. The results can then be used to calculate Pi (t). Another method is applicable when many dice with the same internal structure are available. It consists in activating all of them at once, waiting a time t, and then throwing them all. Such are the typical features of the quantum theory of measurements. The die corresponds to an atomic system, e.g., a hydrogen atom. This can be in a stationary state, as it will be for example when it has been left alone for a suffi- cient period of time. In that condition we are unable to say where the electron is relative to its proton, but we can perform measurements (illumination by short x-rays) each of which will locate the electron at some point r, not of course at the same point. From a sufficient number of such measurements we construct P,. The situation is different when the atom is "activated." There are many forms of activation, called "preparation of state" in quantum theory. Perhaps the simplest is exposure to a light wave, which causes the atom to be in a time-</page><page sequence="16">208 HENRY MARGENAU dependent state. The probabilities are determined as in the case of the activated die: either by repeating many times the act of switching on the light, waiting a period t and measuring, using a single atom; or by exposing many atoms simul- taneously to the light, waiting a time t and then measuring all of them at once. The result is found to be a Pr which is a function of t, the same for both methods. The latter method is the one which the physicist most frequently uses. It is not our intention to discuss fully the quantum theory of measurements, which presents complexities for which the activated die provides no analogs. For instance, to make the story more realistic the die should often break after it falls, so that another one must be used when the throw is to be repeated. A fall can also change the setting of the sprocket and thus produce further diffi- culties which have here been ignored. The intent of our discussion was primarily to illustrate the sense in which probabilities can be objective physical quantities. 5. Historical Reality. The lawful world of physical existences contains all ex- ternal objects, from stars down to our own bodies and to electrons. It contains the states in terms of which the objects are described, the fields they generate, the time and space in which they are embedded. Notably, too, it contains the causally evolving probabilities, the states of the quantum theory which modern physics has taught us to regard as functionally ultimate. Man has, of course, experience of this world, not experience in the narrow sense of empiricism but in the wider one of constructing concepts and of creating rules of correspondence. This is the universe of strictly physical reality. Over against it stands the multitude of immediacies over which, as we have seen, physical causation has lost its direct control. A sensation, a measurement, an observation, a will, an action, and certainly a psychological introspection, belong to this class. I do not argue that it is always possible to tell whether a given element of experience is to be assigned to this class with certainty-as in many other instances, here, also, experience shows no sharp boundaries. The failure of a sharp logical distinction is never serious when recognized. At any rate the items last enumerated, and others which partake similarly of the char- acter of immediacy (spontaneity, coerciveness), in our experience will be said to compose historical reality. Epistemologically, the two worlds are related by rules of correspondence (1). My sensation of an object is the historical component of the event in question, reification is the rule of correspondence, and the postulated external entity (desk, tree, lamp) is the physical component of the experience. The distinction made is admittedly useless and grotesque in the ordinary instances of regular cognition, where lawfulness extends into the historical realm and thus annexes it to the domain of physical reality. Classical physics was the formalization of this all-pervasive causal doctrine. Recent discoveries, described in the earlier portions of this paper, force the distinction upon us. The microcosm obviously fails to convey sense if its lawful and its historical phases are confused, and to what ex- tent the distinction can be ignored in the large-scale world of action requires to be investigated. (See below.) An electron, if it moves in accordance with classical laws of mechanics, de-</page><page sequence="17">PHYSICAL VERSUS HISTORICAL REALITY 209 scribes a physical path, a trajectory; it has no history. The actual electron, sub- ject to the laws of the quantum theory, appears unpredictably here or there; it has no path but a history. To be sure, it also has a determinate physical state associated with its "motion," a wave function in this case. This wave function, however, hovers abstractly over its history, guiding it by enforcing a sort of dis- position without concretely assigning its fate. Historicity involves knowing, it implies observation; it arises through a union of a knower and his object of knowl- edge. The inveterate mechanist tries to explain historicity as an aberration from path-like behavior through an appeal to "unpredictable interactions," as we have seen in section 2. So long as this mode of reasoning is forced to fall back on "un- predictable" matters it fails to achieve its mechanistic end and becomes what we have called an idle theory. An equally idle, but no more idle theory, is one herewith proposed: the elec- tron itself, as an individual, decides what value of a physical observable it will exhibit in the act of measurement. While nothing of scientific importance de- pends on whether we accept this dogma-and I believe the meaning of decision in this context is not very clear-physics can not refute it any more than it can invalidate the mechanist's assertion. What is true is this: to account for experi- ence in its fullness even in the atomic realm, physics requires supplementation by aspects of actuality, incidence, decision-in short, historicity. All that precedes seems to show that the accent on emergence is particularly strong in the atomic world, that the atom is the prime actor in the drama of history. When many atoms cooperate, when masses and distances become large, classical physics with its unhistorical lawfulness results. Our elephant hunt was far less exciting than our rabbit hunt. Quantum theory "reduces" to classical physics in the molar world. While this is generally true, there are important exceptions to the rule. Nature permits arrangements in which the randomizing effects of large numbers does not occur, instruments through which the caprice of the microcosm can be pro- jected into the world of ordinary experience. Every amplifier is such a device. A Geiger counter amplifies the passage of a single elementary particle by pre- cipitating an avalanche of ions when a few are initially produced, and the cur- rent thus generated can be further increased by the use of electron tubes. As is well known, much of modern physical research employs such arrangements. Feedback mechanisms achieve the same purpose of amplification, and the bio- physicist is apparently discovering their widespread occurrence in organized nature. There is indeed an increasing mass of evidence to indicate that the deli- cate balance of metabolism and self-maintenance called life depends for its es- tablishment on precisely those mechanisms which are able to amplify a random atomic impulse into historically significant proportions. An example often cited in this connection is the mutation of a gene. A single x-ray photon can bring this about. Suppose now that the frequency of this photon has been observed and is known. According to the uncertainty principle the posi- tion of the photon is then entirely random. Indulging in an anthropomorphism,</page><page sequence="18">210 HENRY MARGENAU we might say it is wholly "up to the photon" where it will interact with its sur- roundings. If it chooses to invade the neighborhood of a gene, the latter under- goes a change which may, under certain circumstances, spell the doom of an individual. In the inorganic world similar processes of random triggering are easily found. A somewhat unrealistic but impressive one is the release of a uranium bomb by a single neutron. Place a sufficiently large block of U235 in a space free of neutrons, then allow a single neutron at some distance from the block to move toward it. Quantum mechanically, its wave function is known, and along with it we know the probability that it will impinge upon the bomb and cause disaster. The his- toric fact whether it will or not is left open by the physics of the situation. These instances demonstrate the ingression of atomic historicity into the gen- erally lawful macrocosm. The merger between physical and historical reality of which we spoke, and which takes place to some degree in the molar world, is not complete. Our distinction carries its validity far beyond the atomic domain and must be reckoned with everywhere. Astronomy is about the only science which is relatively immune to it. Yet all this, while true, seems to have very little bearing upon the problems of history as this subject is usually understood. History is the arena of human action, and action has not yet entered our discourse. What, then, is action? When analyzed, I believe it is seen to be a composite of arrangements and proc- esses in accord with physical laws, plus here and there an element of voluntaristic decision. It is the decision which transfers action from the physical to the his- torical universe, or, rather, makes it an inhabitant of both realms. We used the word decision, albeit in a loose and tentative manner, when the discussion was about electrons in the act of manifesting their presence to the perceiver. There we were unable to invest the term with accurate meaning. In human action there is a similar element of decision, similar in the sense that it also transcends physical lawfulness (as did the manifestation of the electron's position); but in human action we can study it by introspection. And it is recog- nized as conscious, active, voluntaristic intervention, a true component of his- toricity. The problem of human freedom might seem to enter here. Its traditional fea- tures, however, are peculiarly foreign to the present line of thought. What is obviously, introspectively true, is the occurrence of voluntary decisions, the ex- istence of what earlier philosophers called the human will. Physics has nothing to say about the freedom of that will, about its dependence on motivation, habit and so on. The fact of conscious decision is clear for all to see, and the lati- tude needed for action consequent upon decision is guaranteed by the proba- bilistic features of physical reality. This is as far as we need to go. Indeed it is risky to go farther. The physicist who tries to prove freedom on the basis of quantum theory invariably meets a misfortune, whether he recognizes it or not. For if he makes 4A-functions govern human behavior he can prove randomness of action, but never freedom. He can show that man will act in ac- cordance with ethical precepts a certain percentage of the time, that he will act</page><page sequence="19">PHYSICAL VERSUS HISTORICAL REALITY 211 immorally in another percentage of instances. On this theory man's behavior would be a set of random doings, some good, some bad, without a clue indicating which are good and which are bad. This is not the kind of thing philosophers call freedom. What the argument needs to make its case is again the element of decision, of historicity. Since we left the atomic world our discourse has increasingly taken on the character of speculation, at least to the extent that conscious decision, or action, have assumed a dominant role. We now return to safer matters and show in what manner the possibility of action, regardless of its psychological essence, arises from the modifications of physical lawfulness. Consider again the neutron on its way to the uranium bomb. If classical phys- ics were true, a single set of observations on the position and velocity of the neutron at a suitable time would decide whether an explosion will occur. It would leave room for action only to the very limited extent that, if the neutron is found headed for the bomb, we can try to intercept and deflect it before the impact. Usually this is impossible because the speed even of a thermal neutron is greater than ours, and we are forced to resign ourselves to fate instead of being agents in the course of events. Notice, too, that the very decision to intercept the neutron must be taken as a physiologically determined consequence of physical reality, whose historicity can be but an illusion. Decision as such is indeed an impossibility on the basis of classical mechanics. The new physics, with its concession of autonomy to historical reality, leaves greater room for action and avoids this difficulty. Even if a set of observations7 reveals the neutron to be headed for the bomb we can still hope and act for our survival, because what is now dynamically determined is a probability of col- lision, not a necessity. There is no cause for fatalism, but accentuated need for action. This is true even if, classically speaking, the neutron is seemingly winning the race for collision with the bomb. In this instance, as in all others, the physical situation leaves alternatives which action can seize in numerous ways. Decision fits neatly into the spaces presented by the semi-deterministic honeycomb of historical reality. But we do not pretend to have shown that it actually resides there, nor why. This is an illuminating conjecture made reasonable by the prob- abilistic nature of physical reality. To illustrate this point minutely, let us analyze a decision. The suggestion is always strong that we should reduce the psychological act of deciding to physio- logical bases. In other words, when explaining the outcome of a so-called choice we advert to physiological processes taking place in the brain, to reverberating neuron currents, firing synapses and the like, and we assume, following traditional doctrine, that in the ultimate analysis molecular events determine the outcome of our choice. This avenue is now blocked, for clearly such a process of reduction 7 It is often asserted that a measurement of its position and a simultaneous measurement of its velocity, which are necessary to certify that the neutron is headed for the bomb, cannot be made. This is incorrect. Such measurements, when made, have no predictive value, which is, of course, the point here at issue.</page><page sequence="20">212 HENRY MARGENAU will land us in the realm of atomic uncertainties. There is no unique road from the event of voluntary decision to the laws of physical reality. Again, we are forced to take decision as an irreducible act, a component of historical reality which stands aloof from physical lawfulness. A summary of conclusions now reached might run as follows. Nineteenth Cen- tury natural science conceived of man as a detached spectator of an objective universe. It held the spectator-spectacle polarity to be genuine and fundamen- tal. During the present century, discoveries concerning the nature of atoms rend- ered this doctrine untenable. The nucleus of a new philosophy of nature emerged with Heisenberg's principle of uncertainty, whose basic meaning implies a fu- sion of the knower with the known. The theory grew with amazing speed and suc- cess; it led to a mathematical formalism which, in order to attain its purpose, namely lawful description of experience, has to speak of probabilities rather than unique events. Individual events are no longer related in causal fashion, although in the domain of probabilities causality still reigns. Thus has been introduced another, more significant principle of division than the old spectator-spectacle bifurcation: the distinction between physical and historical reality has appeared. Along with these developments, man has been transformed from a spectator to an active participant in the drama of becoming. Room has been made for decision and choice, which had no place in the older scheme of things. What was formerly fate has become history. Before laying away his pen the philosopher, though disclaiming all right to speak as an historian, desires to raise a thought or two for historians to ponder. Physical science has yielded autonomy to the historical process. The detach- ment of the latter from physical lawfulness is the more pronounced the greater the abundance of momentous, unique events having a potency to release an avalanche of history. We live in an era charged with such potencies. The dis- tinction which this paper set out to describe may have a sinister chance of be- coming fatal before it is universally recognized. Hence its grave importance. The other thought concerns the possibility of a science of history. Let no one deny this possibility on the grounds that history has too many variables to be susceptible of scientific treatment, or that it deals with human situations in which inquiry has a profound effect upon what is sought to be known. Natural science has solved both of these difficulties in its long course of evolution, the first by judiciously eliminating irrelevant variables and searching for significant ones, the second by injecting probabilities into the last constituents of its uni- verse. It may be supposed, therefore, that history can take on the structure of science by adopting the pattern of physics. If this plausible thesis is accepted it follows that history, like physics, can predict only mass phenomena such as economic cycles, large-scale migrations, periods of cultural activity, and the like. But it will be unable to address itself to those peak events, to the emergence of powerful personalities, which have so decisive an influence on the course of human affairs. A science of history that wishes to bring these critical phenomena within its sphere of prediction must not follow slavishly the pattern of physical science;</page><page sequence="21">PHYSICAL VERSUS HISTORICAL REALITY 213 such a science must strike out on its own along paths hitherto uncharted by existing disciplines.
