<plain_text><page sequence="1">Achieving a State of Grace F. ANDRE FAVAT I am not enough of an historian to say whether or not those of us who practice and use criticism of children's literature - those of us who write about and teach about children's litera- ture - ever enjoyed a state of grace, but as I survey our current state, I am fairly convinced that if we ever were in a state of grace, we seem now to have fallen from it - so far from it, in fact, that I suspect we were never in it. Now by some ordering of the world, such a condition probably does not make much difference, but if we are in error, then our sins will be revisited in our students. And that, I think, does make a difference. What I would like to offer, therefore, is a plan for avoiding sin - at least with regard to literary criticism and children's literature - one that, ignoring theological impossibility, might help us achieve a state of grace. Children's Literature and Literature First, we must decide whether we understand children's literature to be apart from or a part of literature in general. There is among us an attitude which considers children's literature as being apart from all the rest of literature, and this attitude has caused us to establish for children's literature a separate set of standards. Some argue that different standards are necessary This paper was presented at the Eighth Annual Conference on English Education in Des Moines, Iowa, April, 1970.

Those who hold this position maintain, for example, that children's literature is not characterized by the complexity that characterizes much of the rest of literature, and therefore could not bear the weight of normal critical inquiry. But we have too willingly nodded to assent to this sort of statement, and having thus espoused an apart from attitude, find ourselves in precarious positions. We run one risk, for instance, of accepting less craftsmanship in children's stories than we would accept in conventional stories. C. S. Lewis's Narnia stories, for example, are highly thought of, and they do indeed insist them- selves upon us in powerful ways, but a more rigorous examina- tion of them shows that Lewis's differentiation of his characters through speech is almost non-existent, and that his handling of anthropomorphism is rather clumsy, not only when compared with Kenneth Grahame, or Margery Sharp, or E. B. White, but even when compared with lesser writers of anthropomorphism. By our standards for literature in general, such inadequacies would cause us to have reservations about these stories, but by our standards for children's literature, these inadequacies are overlooked. Now of course, someone will say, "But these things are not as important to children as they are to us." or "Children do not respond to such fine distinctions." But if we succumb to that argument, then we run a second risk, that of giving to children books which by our standards for children's literature we judge to be acceptable, but which we secretly know, by our standards for literature in general, are unacceptable. Surely of all the deceits practiced upon children, this is one of the most reprehensible. If we were to reject this apart from attitude, and were to view children's literature as a part of literature in general, we might operate with greater honesty. A work for children would have to stand on its own as a work of art, and its faults could not be ignored because mere children were reading it. We would find that our standards of judgment for children's literature would cause us to expect more and excuse less. How well we would know then what C S. Lewis meant when he said that no 137</page><page sequence="3">138 English Education book is really worth reading at the age of ten which is not equally worth reading at the age of fifty.1 The Vocabulary and Criticism A second means by which we might achieve grace would be to find a vocabulary of criticism that is semantically viable. As matters stand now, many of the statements made about children's books in no way actually illumine for the reader the nature or quality of the work. Witness some of the statements from one of our most widely used book selection guides: "An enchanting picture book. . . ." or "An entrancing introduction to the city. . . ." or "A charming book about miniature folk " or "Another delectable pictorial presentation " or "A small and delicious book. . . ." Francis Bacon notwithstanding, I have visions of these reviewers sitting at their desks marveling at the succulence of a book's cover or the bouquet of its endpapers. What is lamentable is not only that those who write these reviews are using this empty language, but also that no one is taking them to task for it. We would heap our scorn on a reviewer of literature in general were he to write like that. Reviewing and Criticism Third, we would have to realize that because of the nearly endless proliferation of short reviews which seldom, if ever, aspire to be more than mere reviews, we have stunted the growth of criticism. With literature in general, the review has long been conceived quite broadly, enabling it to be a vehicle for making statements about the nature and function of literature or for plac- ing a particular work within the whole tradition, and so on. The review has provided an arena for the practice of criticism, and as such, has become formative in the highest Aristotelian sense. We would search in vain, I think, for anything such as that among our reviews of children's literature. We do need guidance in book selection by means of reviews, but as with Rumer Godden's Mousewife, I want something more, in this case, a wedding of criticism and reviewing. 1 C. S. Lewis.

It will be difficult indeed to change the way those of us who write about and teach about children's literature go about our business. We might be able to excise meaningless words from our vocabularies, and we might be able to consider more often the nature of children's literature, but the great task will be to change the mental set that gives rise to such vocabulary and which has pre- cluded our thinking about aesthetics or literary theory. Authors and/or their Work Fourth, we would have to place in proper perspective the innumerable articles on the lives of the authors which fill the pages of those journals that wholly or in part concern themselves with children's literature. With literature in general, we have long realized that substituting focus on the author for focus on his work is an inadequate approach. Why is it then that we are so tenacious in maintaining it as an approach to children's literature? Are the lives of those whose books are read by children more interesting, more germane to their work than the lives of those whose books are read by adults? I am sure that everyone involved with children's literature has read over and over how Beatrix Potter wrote her books, what she wrote to her publisher, and how she involved her children friends, and I do not wish to demean these appreciations unneces- sarily, for they do have their place. But, knowing that Sir Walter Scott enjoyed twelve hard-boiled eggs for breakfast, will that information help us to make judgments about his work? Beyond the Texts and Booklists Fifth, in the fashion of the times, we should declare a moratorium, this one on the writing of any more texts about children's literature, or the constructing of any more booklists. We have enough, and they do indeed serve a necessary function, but they do not serve a sufficient one, and more of the same will not alter the situation. With literature in general, the texts that give overviews are elaborated upon by a rich tradition of in-depth studies of the work of particular authors, of innumerable books and articles exploring particular characteristics or themes that</page><page sequence="5">140 English Education many authors have in common, of critical examinations of par- ticular genre, whole books on the picaresque, the Bildungsroman, and the like. If we search for the same among the criticism of children's literature, we are likely to be disappointed. We may come upon essays such as those in Sara Fenwick's collection,2 but these are almost alone in the whole corpus. We find encouraging titles in the journals, but upon reading the articles themselves, we discover very little more than rehashings of plots, with very little high level conceptualization. What we need are monographs on particular topics. What is the nature of the hero in the folk tale? What are the character- istics of the anthropomorphic animal story? In what ways does the will-to-power surface in children's literature? What are the notions of justice as they are imbedded in children's literature? What are the concepts of city and country, of family and indi- vidual found in children's literature? The Training of Critics and Teachers Sixth, if we believe that children's literature is a part of literature in general, we would have to insist that those who practice and use criticism of children's literature have the same basic credentials as those who practice and use criticism of liter- ature in general. Those who would talk about children's liter- ature would need to be trained in aesthetics, literary theory, literary criticism, just as are conventional critics. But besides being trained in these basics, the critic of children's literature would have to be trained in psychoanalytic and developmental psychologies. Now that we have come to view psychoanalytic theory more rationally, we will find that some of our greatest insights into children's literature can come through the application of such concepts as regression, denial, identifica- tion, and the like. We can come to know what the reasons are for Peter Rabbit's having its continuing holding power over young and old alike, and what the reasons are for the fascination we have with Toad or Stuart Little. It is not simply that they are 2 Sara Fenwick, ed. Critical Approaches to Children's Literature.

Similarly, developmental psychology will illumine more than we ever expected. We will discover, for instance, that there are some very specific developmental psychological reasons for children's intense interest in fairy tales, other than that they "love to roam in the colorful world of the tale," as we are so often told. If we have all that training and then add the pedagogical knowledge of the elementary education specialist and the biblio- graphic knowledge of the library science specialist, then we will have the ideal preparation for writing about and teaching about children's literature. Grace Achieved So you have it. Those of us who practice or use criticism of children's literature must decide just what the relationship is between children's literature and conventional literature. We must employ or insist upon a precise critical vocabulary in the reviews we write or use. We must force reviews to take on the functions of criticism, and must eschew appreciations in favor of in-depth, topical studies. And we must bring to bear upon our writing and teaching, knowledge of literature and psychology and not pedagogy or bibliography alone. Such critical efforts would mean that we were increasing the reservoir of knowledge about children's literature from which our students could draw as they approached children with books. The importance of having such a reservoir cannot be over- estimated, and those who are honest with themselves would have to admit that even in an age of affect such as ours, where we have happily re-discovered the child, there is a need for critical knowledge. Indeed, attempts to bring children and books together are likely to be futile unless knowledge of children is matched by knowledge of the literature appropriate for them. In this way, then, can those of us who practice and use criticism of children's literature achieve a state of grace for our- selves. I say achieve because this state will not come naturally, inevitably, or even at all, without our quite directed and specific efforts. And as for our students, at least they will not be burdened by our sins.</page></plain_text>
