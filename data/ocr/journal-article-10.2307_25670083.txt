<plain_text><page sequence="1">HERMANN DEUSER Translated by Dennis Beach, O.S.B. The Pennsylvania State University Christianity?Sign Among Signs?1 The exile from Eden is, semiotically, the banishment of the self-conscious self from its own world of signs. ?Walker Percy, Lost in the Cosmos I William of Baskerville, the sign interpreter and detective, is a passionate nominalist. One night, having dreamed marvels ("I had always thought that dreams were divine messages, or at worst absurd stammerings of the sleeping memory . . ."),2 his pious student and companion, Adso of Melk, surmises also the bottomlessness of the pure system of signs: "I was now realizing that one can also dream books, and therefore dream of dreams' (437). At this, William responds with similar profundity: "A dream is a scripture, and many scriptures are nothing but dreams" (438). The sense of this novel?and its title?is the fictional and thereby living illustration of the basic thesis of nominalism, as it is first found compactly formulated in the final sentence of the text: uStat rosa pristina nomine, nomina nuda tenemus" (502).3 Such names are signs (492), or more pre cisely, signs of signs of things (396), whereby here access to the things remains itself a similarly open epistemological question (317), just as the criminological investigation into the methodical murders leads ultimately into the void, that is, into pure accident (492). In this respect, no ordering of the world and its causal series can ground itself, and it is this cosmologi THE JOURNAL OF SPECULATIVE PHILOSOPHY, Vol. VII, No. 4, 1993. Copyright ? 1993 The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA. 286</page><page sequence="2">CHRISTIANITY?SIGN AMONG SIGNS? 287 cal result of the seventh day that immediately brings with itself conse quences for the concept of God. The self-evident first cause of all order suddenly becomes an open question itself: "How can a necessary being exist totally polluted with the possible?" (493). The nonexistence of God and with it the cosmological and rational insecurity of all reality appears as the problematic achievement of modern spheres of thought, to which the me thodical desire to know the truth as a science of signs has opened the door. Here a second thematic strain of the novel enters the foreground, manifestly as the practical application of the theoretical problem: that, in the face of the nondeducibility of things, one must and can take up directly, consciously, and without reservation moral responsibility for the direction of human conduct in life. The counterimage of this yet to be attained responsibility and humanity is the secret-enshrouded cloister library, mod eled on the labyrinth of evil, and, within it, the devilish, counterhuman, counternatural (apocalyptic) attempt to suppress knowledge. As the sin of knowledge should never again be repeated and as, within the revelation entrusted to the church, everything is thus uniquely arranged and ordered (473ff.), the religious fanatic (Jorge of Burgos?the blind seer!) takes upon himself the right to terror. Ideologically critical4 and with ever more contemporaneous irony (reaching to the extreme characteristics of travesty and sarcasm), Eco shows that such fanaticism for truth is directly, and in the proper sense, devilish: What is attributed to a "divine plan" must in truth be called murder (471). Against this stands nominalist zeal for science as explanation by knowledge and inquiry (395); methodically guided con struction of hypotheses5 opposes authority from mere tradition (447). Thus, in the course of the novel the defense of laughter and the humanness of folly is opposed to the deadly possession of truth, which is only able to express itself in the fanaticism of saints and heretics (476ff., 491). Nominalistic theory and humanistic zeal meet each other where anxiety and freedom, existentially understood, collide. The cryptic journeyman murderer, saint and antichrist, expresses it in this formula: "But law is imposed by fear, whose true name is fear of God" (475). If "entangled freedom" (Kierkegaard)6 is given in this way a religious and ideological significance, then every overcoming of anxiety must appear quite simply "destructive" (475). Margins of freedom are to be narrowly confined and guarded (475f.). The reactionary Utopia of the totalitarian state founds itself on the ecclesiastical-religious ideology of institutional control of conscience, which produces and maintains anxiety by force of authority. If this is opposed?which enlightenment science has done for centuries, and</page><page sequence="3">288 HERMANN DEUSER no longer merely under the auspices of Aristotle!?the alternative cer tainly appears at first glance to have a destabilizing effect, for the nomi nalistic Utopia of truth and knowledge supports itself solely upon fallible argumentation. The following dialogue between the student of the old faith and the nominalistic teacher instructs us here with black humor: "Therefore you don't have a single answer to your questions?" "Adso, if I did I would teach theology in Paris." "In Paris do they always have the answer?" "Never," William said, "but they are very sure of their errors." "And you," I said with childish impertinence, "never commit errors?" "Often," he answered. "But instead of conceiving only one, I imagine many, so I become the slave of none." (306) It seems that the necessary consequence is that this path leads into induc tive contingency and bare possibility, thus into godlessness, at least where God, following the traditional metaphysics of natural theology, is to be conceived of as ens necessarium. This theological obverse of nominalism renders the will of God inscrutable, like a mystical nothingness (501). The "freedom of God is our condemnation" (493); revelation is replaced by "experience" (316), the accessibility and the truth of which a distant God no longer guarantees. Thus we come again to the apt conclusion, expressed again with a schoolboys candor (207): "You act, and you know why you act, but you don't know why you know that you know what you do?" II What impels a semiotician to write a novel? Aside from all biographical considerations of the author, there remains a purely objective, namely, a semiological, explanation: Signs can manifestly refer to each other again and again without limit. The objective reference of a sign represents as such a sign for something else, and so on. But signs are not only always placed successively in this double linkage; they are present?following Peirce's observation and introduction of the interpretant-relation?always already, so to speak, triply linked to one another. More precisely, human percep tion, cognition, and thought themselves are each structured in this config uration; consciousness grasps others and itself in this manner, so that plainly conscious events as such and in their development and operation</page><page sequence="4">CHRISTIANITY?SIGN AMONG SIGNS? 289 must be presented in the same structure. Once this is presumed, an aesthetic consequence is immediately evident. Sign interrelations are like play, in which everything combines with anything, and can thus be freely arranged. Surely, there ensue just as immediately wholly determinate rules and dependencies; yet, these are immanent to the work of art, its material, its genre, etc., and do not directly affect the autonomy of the essentially free play of possible associations. That fact had thus stimulated the semiotician and author of "Stat rosa pristina nomine" to play once through the reality of the possibilities of sign references as if they were actual. Here a suitable definition of the concept of sign is furnished by Peirce. A sign is anything that determines something else [its interpretant] to relate itself to an object to which it relates itself (as its object) in the same manner, whereby the interpretant in its turn becomes a sign, and so on ad infinitum.7 If this were all there were to say concerning signs, aesthetics of itself would not merely remain seen as autonomous, but reality itself would become aesthetic and thereby wholly autarchic, that is, a free play of possibilities beside which there is nothing else. That things are not so does not require proof; the only ones who would register doubts here are aesthetes to whom aesthetics is not an artistic creed but a way to live, in fact, the only way. In any case, Peirce does not belong to these; nor does Kierkegaard, although he, as a pseudonymous author who in his turn founded and edited the "Papers of A," occasionally acted as if only this aesthetic existed, an aesthetic where one must be able to understand in order that one may live.8 Yet where does Eco stand? What guarantees the reality of things? considered nonaesthetically?if we always have only signs of signs of things, which finally trace back to contingent constellations? Of the reality of God nothing more can be said within the novel. Where only the hypotheses of sign-interpreting human beings have reality, religion is, alongside everything else?and in the enlightenment-humanistic zeal, precisely this?merely a sign system among these others. Not simply in need of reform, it is perhaps dispensable, replaceable, purely relative. This is a penetrating objection not merely to Christianity, but to every religion. Religion would thereby become for thinking men and women only an object for the consideration of social-psychological history, would repre sent, from the point of view of the community- or cosmologically con stituted actuality, only a derivative, even relative and interchangeable</page><page sequence="5">290 HERMANN DEUSER function. And the same verdict must clearly obtain for every kind of obligation with respect to the conception of reality (of which religion is merely the supreme example): foundations, norms, value-orientations, all confound themselves in their own sign-dimension. In short, the aesthetic priority of sign systems ad infinitum is a disadvantage for the life-world. We do not live this way; and what is proclaimed in The Name of the Rose to be a moral responsibility clearly requires yet another mode of realization in order to be that which the fictional plane of the novel can always only prefigure, only perform. Ill Why is it that the theory of signs cannot be the same thing as the praxis of an actual semiosis?9 The basis is not only the user of signs, who is the producer of the theory of signs, but still more generally stated, the fact that the triadic sign model of an act of semiosis?or procedurally considered, of its operation?can in all cases only be a determination that recognizes points of departure, orientation, and aim. Certainly, the sign structure allows itself to be abstracted from every such concrete happening; yet in this way the structure is merely abstract compared to the actual case of its occurrence. Peirce has secured this concretizing of the sign-relation in two ways: First, in that the object-relation is a question not only of the object targeted, so to speak, from the sign and internal to the sign, which Peirce calls the "immediate [object]," but also of the object that is decisive for the truth-seeking process, the "dynamic object" of the objective world, a world always referred to and from which the sign in this relation generally originates.10 Alternatively, the concretizing of the sign-relation is secured in that one distinguishes in the interpretant a relation between the "imme diate," "dynamic," and "final" interpretant.11 Herein do the pragmatic points of Peirce's semiotic first achieve full validity. The effect of the sign object in the interpretant is not solely in turn sign- and object-related (and this ad infinitum), but it is essentially habit-taking and action-related. Thus, in actuality, sign-relations are not merely free Unkings of possibilities; rather, they at once refer to objects and imprint and transmit habits of conduct. Once again, religion serves as a good example: Certainly the necessary and particular occupation with originary possibility as such serves as foun dation for the fact that there is religion at all?an occupation thought of</page><page sequence="6">CHRISTIANITY?SIGN AMONG SIGNS? 291 not as an aesthetically produced play, but as the taking-up and carrying out of a characteristically proper and fitting concern with the creation of possibilities that is always pre-given to created beings,12 such as their bringing religious speech to expression in the frameworks of creation ideas, of rituals and liturgies of thanksgiving, of worship, and so on. To this end there then appears with historical necessity the existential and objective exposition of the religion of the age, whose historical relation is constitu tive for it and not arbitrary, and whose coming to presence is first realized by the lived life of the respective religious self-understanding and life-context. If we take, for example, Christianity, it is a question with respect to both these facets of the Christological anchoring of the trinitarian faith in God in the history and the stories told of the man from Nazareth, which again become, in the spirit's present age, actually conduct- and action orienting. 13 Expressed semiologically and with Peirce's terminology: The unassignably historical existence-relation articulates itself in the "dynamic object," and the pragmaticist application and life-world concretization in what is always my life in its present-day context of conduct and action articulates itself in the "final interpretant."14 IV For the Christian religion, this sign theory is portrayed and employed paradigmatically in the conversation between Jesus and Nicodemus (John 3).15 The divine "signs" relate Jesus (v. 2) ultimately to himself as the "Son of Man" (v. 13), which, however, presupposes the fundamental matrix of religious interpretation: to be able to understand oneself starting from God. Such understanding is, furthermore, the activity of the new "Spirit," which blows where it will (vv. 7f.). This spiritual experience remains underivable; it always presupposes itself in its appearance; it is a First.16 Its specific objectification and form of appropriation can then be fully given in a second and a third step: "water and spirit" as signs for baptism (v. 5) are, so to speak, the objective givens, according to which what in the Christian interpretant is called "Son of God" is fulfilled (vv. 16ff.). This interconnec tion can be explicated as follows: The originary and underivable becoming effective has its existential reference in Jesus as the Son of God. In this respect, this characteristically Christological doubling of human and God both is necessary and leads necessarily to the question (v. 9)?held open at this level?concerning the unity of differences, concerning the mode of "togetherness" in one person of historical humanness and a divinity that is</page><page sequence="7">292 HERMANN DEUSER not historically confined. This conflict or, with respect to personal exis tence, unresolvable paradox of ascent into and descent from heaven (v. 13), of love and sacrifice (v. 16), first resolves itself in a third situation, when faith (v. 18) is introduced as a mode of "togetherness." What the originary spiritual experience made possible and the historical, Christolog ical objectification presented, unto the utmost consequences of death and life, comes together successfully in faith?and this can be recounted to the present day. In faith there arises what is consequently not simply a balanced opposition in the symbolism of "light" and "darkness" (vv. 19ff.), but what, in Christian spiritual and lived experience, constitutes the specific differ ence between the "kingdom of God" (v. 3) and the world: The reigning darkness does not have truth at its disposal, but in that darkness and opposed to it, the light does. Are such sign associations able to be exchanged arbitrarily or replaced? The underivable sign of God (1), that is, the originary making-possible of spiritual experience, holds itself open to its (Christological) objectification (2), and it does this again in the interpretant relation of faith (3). In the comparison of religions?again therefore a level of abstraction?the for malization of this sign-association is not only possible, but to a certain extent even required. These operations do not occur, however, on the plane of the lived life of a given time, where determinate behavior- and action-relations (in the historical context) are already decided or to be decided. In this respect, and cutting across all other linguistically moti vated systematization of signs, two things must be kept unmistakably distinct. Eco's interpretation of Peirce has already done this, and with it, in every case relativized the purely aesthetic conception of signs: Semiosis dies at every moment. But, as soon as it dies, it rises again like the Phoenix. . . . The system of systems of codes, which could look like an irrealis tic and idealistic cultural world separate from the concrete events, leads men to act upon the world; and this action continuously converts itself into new signs, giving rise to new semiotic systems,17 V It obviously remains here unclear where the continuity between "every moment" of practical life and the intrinsic theoretical openness of sign systems should be sustained. In Eco's reading of Peirce, howsoever he seeks</page><page sequence="8">CHRISTIANITY?SIGN AMONG SIGNS? 293 to justify the pragmatic action situation as the site of semiosis, the general "process of semiosis" seems always to hover over the concretizings. Peirce's own interpretation of his philosophy in the years after 1900, combined with the keywords pragmaticism, synechism, and continuum, address pre cisely this question: Where are we to conceive the coordination between, on the one hand, the life-situation related practically to objects and directed toward determinable understanding and action and, on the other, the semiotic procedurality that, by means of this life-situation, is to be shown as not isolated and closed off? If this question is not answered, then these two viewpoints?that of living praxis and that of semiotic theory systems?must themselves remain unconnected, and the intrusion of nom inalism, now merely at a higher level, would be repeated. It is not the aesthetic play of sign with sign that now must be challenged, but the triviality of the life-decisions alleged to be ethically binding, which would now submit to circularity or to the infinite series of eternal return of sign for sign. The semiotic systems would be taken seriously as appearance in specific situations, related to specific objects and applied to specific actions and known rules. But upon closer observation, the picture would neverthe less take shape that concretization would ultimately disappear again and again in the vortex of semiotic transpositions and layerings through broad reaching interpretants for signs of objects. Thus especially these signs and their interpreters would disappear, so to speak, on the spot. Once again religion and the religiousness of individual persons provides a model for what this doctrine of signs must mean. For spiritual experience, the Christological tie to determinate historical contexts and the realization of the faith and action that occur within these would certainly have to be semiotically analyzed and, in restricted scope, also grounded. Moreover, at the same time and in contrast to the applied semiotic theory-instrument complex, they would be an essentially underlying model for application, and thus, like life in general (and all its conceivable obligations) would become degraded to mere material for illustrations. Faith, life, and action as notable mirror-images of themselves? Peirce here applied the unavoidable cosmological and ontological conse quences that issue from the described stalemate: that practical life situa tions and semiotic theory, to the detriment of both, stand isolated from one another. (1) Should sign-model and the pragmatic situation-determinacy of the interpretant be similarly valid (without their being played out against one another either structurally or existentially), then actuality itself must be</page><page sequence="9">294 HERMANN DEUSER thought of as a process of truth-formation?in evolutionary terms.18 In this process, human thought and action are given a share, but only a share, never the whole. The perspective needed here, sub specie aeternitatis, does not fall to human being's lot, although it becomes immediately explicit what priority such a perspective assumes: While the totality of a process cannot in principle be thought out and discovered, this impossibility itself is revealed as a problem and becomes a pressing force. (2) The site where this position and this meaning are thought further, and where specific experiences of this type are sought after, is that of religion. It is possible for religion for its part to enter into consideration of this process as a process because it?considered in its genuine activity? cannot go about objectively and measure itself by existing facts. Rather, springing from the indeterminacy of feeling and originary spiritual experi ence, religion works these out and hands them on with historically deter minable symbols and the modes of conduct and impulses of action appropri ate to them. Seen in this way, religion shares something with art, with the difference that the religious symbols are not umade" artistically with refer ence to material (and are thus not a reproduction of that which is properly original). In contrast, religion is always the attempt to bring the creative originariness itself to expression.19 (3) It is only now appropriate to ask how religion, thus determined?or respectively, the process of the evolution of thoughts and the actuality of the continuity, thus semiotically, ontologically, and cosmologically under stood?can stand fast. Here it is a question of the real and the concrete interconnection between an originary richness of possibilities, an existent objectivity, and a conformability to law in which nature and intellect exhibit themselves historically. Peirce's synechism advocated the doctrine that continuity in time and space are real and that human consciousness participates therein.20 At the same time there is to be thought a factically inexhaustible infinity in this, which sanctions first, vague, hypothetical attempts at determination to be admitted as similarly real, as this is valid with reference to existential determinations and statements of law. The God hypothesis thus is also granted its place by the logic of cognition, which cannot dismiss feeling and originary spiritual experience on the basis of fully principled considerations of cosmological evolution, if it does not want to err. Thus the symbolic performances of religion are nothing other than the expression of the conceived reality of the universe. (4) This dismissal of nominalism does not in any way entail the retreat to supernatural objectives, upon whose ungroundable assertion metaphysics</page><page sequence="10">CHRISTIANITY?SIGN AMONG SIGNS? 295 and Christian religion were anachronistically dependent; rather, the syn echistic conception of reality rests upon the scientific disposition to test hypotheses and to formulate laws. Peirce's semiotic is at once then realistic and fallibilistic, without becoming in this way arbitrary or unable to mediate any longer between practical semiosis in the living situation and theoret ically infinite (and abstract) sign-systems. If the doctrine of "fallibilism" is applicable to all modern science, then it seems that traditional morality and religion,21 so long as they want to remain generally in contact with science, have their wings clipped by the same judgment. In opposition to this it helps little to declare valid for the situation of the church a special case of infallibility, and in the face of such "dogmatic" assertions the nomi nalistic objection?semiotically expressed, the purely open series of sign references?is always justified from the outset. The unifiability of fallibilism (as the scientifically unavoidable conception of truth on the basis of proba bilistic induction) and realism (which includes the vagueness of religious hypotheses and the anthropomorphic symbolism of religious speech as well as the existential statements submitted to critical examination) lies for Peirce precisely in this, that "the real thing is that which forces us sooner or later to acknowledge it."22 From this two results follow: first, the maxim not to block the further advance of exploration and the search for truth (thus, for example, to be tolerant! );23 and second, the declaration of experience as the field of origin of all our perception, knowledge, and thought, a field beneath which one cannot go. This second conclusion guards fallibilism from ivory-tower skepticism as well as from the dogmatic pronouncement of ostensibly unknowable facticities. "Experience," in contrast to this, is "the entire mental product, "24 in light of which God cannot be the product of a theoretical inference upon something, but a directly integral constitu tive part of this concept of experience: "As to God, open your eyes?and your heart, which is also a perceptive organ?, and you see him."25 (5) Thus, in Peirce's philosophy of synechism forms of theory and of life come together in a manner that, for our inquiry, is perhaps best described as categorial semiotic. The three universal categories of experience exhibit the ontological formulation of the semiotic structure, that tripartite character that returns theologically in the trinitarian talk of God as the self-expression of this experience.26 In this respect Christianity is a sign among signs. It is this, however, in an explicitly principled and indispensable way?a view of things that even Adso of Melk would not finally rule out, if his teacher and master lived in the nineteenth/twentieth century.

Semiosis is denned, with Peirce, as "an action, or influence, which is, or involves, a cooperation of three subjects, such as a sign, its object, and its interpretant, this tri-relative influence not being in any way resolvable into actions between pairs."

Seen thus (and therefore understood differently than in the novel itself) William and Adso's remarks at the end of The Name of the Rose concerning the conception of God are neither nominalistic nor destructive to onto-theology, as long as this is no longer supported by the conceptual pressures involved in the ancient and medieval metaphysics of substance. On the connection of Peirce's argument for God to the modern history of the problem of the so-called God proofs, see H. Deuser, Gott: Geist und Natur: Theologische Konsquenzen aus Ch. S. Peirce' Religionsphibsophie (Berlin/New York: W. de Gruyter, 1993), Kap. 1. 13. The case could of course be made, with relevant adjustments, through other religions. I focus here on Christianity because it is the milieu of Eco's novel and because it is the religion with which Peirce most strongly identified. 14. That is very well expressed in Eco's later reception of Peirce (as he presents it in "Peirce and the Semiotic Foundations of Openness: Signs as Texts and Texts as Signs," chapter 7 of</page><page sequence="12">CHRISTIANITY?SIGN AMONG SIGNS? 297 The Role of the Reader: Explorations in the Semiotics of Texts [Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1979], pp. 175-99): "Thus, through pragmaticism, Peirce has joined his Scotist realism: the action is the place in which the haecceitas ends the game of semiosis" (p. 195). "Scotist realism" Eco clearly understands here as a form of "Idealism" (pp. 193-94).

Peirce writes in 1909, commenting on his Neglected Argument for the Reality of God [from the year 1908, see CP 6.452-85]: "The most powerful of the proofs of His Being is that the sincere inquirer, (who will first have been freed from Nominalism, so as no longer to confound the assertion of God's Reality, with the proposition that God Exists, since this, being a contradiction in terminis, will not receive five minutes' consideration from any clear headed person,)?if he meditates well upon God's Reality considered as a mere hypothe sis,?and until he has done this, he is unfit to judge of it,?will, as a fact, find himself utterly incapable of doubting it, which is more than a Proof of it to him;?it is a Rational Compulsion" (MS 641, pp. 19, 20). 17. Eco, "Peirce and the Semiotic Foundations of Openness," p. 195. 18. This use is expressed very well in the following citation from Peirce's 1905 essay, "Issues of Pragmaticism": "It seems a strange thing, when one comes to ponder over it, that a sign should leave its interpreter to supply a part of its meaning; but the explanation of the phenomenon lies in the fact that the entire universe?not merely the universe of existents, but all that wider universe, embracing the universe of existents as a part, the universe which we are all accustomed to refer to as 'the truth'?that all this universe is perfused with signs, if it is not composed exclusively of signs" (CP 5.448, n. 1, p. 302). 19. Peirce's definition of religion appears to corroborate this: "In each individual it is a sort of sentiment, or obscure perception, a deep recognition of a something in the circumambient All, which, if he strives to express it, will clothe itself in forms more or less extravagant, more or less accidental, but ever acknowledging the first and last, the A and ft, as well as a relation to that Absolute of the individual's self, as a relative being."

In 1892, Peirce writes in MS 955 (in CP 1.141-75 with omissions preserved): "On the whole, then, we cannot in any way attain to certainty nor to exactitude. We never can have a right to be absolutely sure; nor to maintain a proposition to be quite accurate," p. 8. 22. So stated in MS 860, p. 6, from 1894. 23. Ibid. pp. lOfT. 24. Ibid. p. 15; cf.
