<plain_text><page sequence="1">Logging, Women and Submarines: Some Changes in Kamula Men's Access to Transformative Power Michael Wood James Cook University ABSTRACT In this paper I describe how, for the Kamula, the productive elicitation of both familiar and modern things often requires access to the transformative capacities of 'bush spirits'. The Kamula narratives I deal with outline how elements of modernity (such as money, logging, guns) are relocated into the domain of these spirits. By the mediation of these spirits, some- times disturbing, even dangerous, aspects of modernity are transformed and then produc- tively transferred to Kamula men such that they can apparently more effectively negotiate the new forces that now structure their lives. Through these narrative and magical defini- tions of agency, Kamula men become complicit in a modernity that is increasingly both the source and negation of their power. This essay deals with some recent changes in Kamula ideas about peripheral agents and their transformative powers. The data I rely on involve Kamula stories about the role of peripheral agents - such as 'bush spirits' (dalipatalo) and humans from distant places1 - in empowering Kamula men. I take these stories to be important sites for the production, and reflexive understanding, of new forms of male agency. I am interested in situating these changing definitions of male agency in recent histori- cal contexts primarily associated with the introduction of industrial logging into the area. The narratives I consider define some of the Kamula's capacities and powers for dealing with modernity.2 In these narratives the Kamula refigure modernity into a basic cosmologi- cal structure that crucially inflects Kamula understandings of men's productivity and power. They do this by mapping elements of modernity - such as money, industrial logging, new sexual relationships and guns - into the unseen world of 'bush spirits'. I develop my account of this process by initially outlining stories concerning hunting. These stories show that extraordinary male productivity is a function of relationships with the same 'bush spir- its' that now mediate the Kamula's access to key elements of modernity. As elements of modernity appear through the mediating role of liminal agents I argue that Kamula men are, to an extent, able to access and take some control of the extraordinary powers and capacities that modernity promises. This is because the bush spirits, themselves a key locus of transformative power, can change and absorb into their realm the modern, often by duplicating or imitating it. They then reveal and transfer specific aspects of moder- nity to the Kamula. In particular, they transfer to men an increased ability to be socially effective in modern conditions (by having smart children or acquiring guns). As part of this incorporation of modernity into the Kamula domain through the mediation of the bush spir- its, the stories also define new mimetic spaces (such as the reproductive capacity of dali 228 Oceania 6%, 1998</page><page sequence="2">Wood palalo women), or give new significance to already known sites (such as rivers), for the revelation and flow of modern things and powers to Kamula men. But I stress that while defining new locations and new modes of transfer of modern things the narratives also imply, in varying degrees, the continuity of a pre-existing ontology through which forms of great power and productivity have been made available to the Kamula. I argue for the centrality of a process of 'revelation' as fundamental to Kamula under- standings of contemporary forms of production. In this I am reworking into a different ethnographic context a point often made in recent Melanesian studies (see Wagner 1977:404; M. Strathern 1992a, 1992b:74-5; Weiner 1995a; Hirsch 1994). M. Strathern (1988) argues that Melanesian sociality is structured around 'a continual process of conceal- ment and revelation where persons and things assume transformed states of particular and collective relations' (Hirsch 1994:694). According to Merlán and Rumsey, Highlanders' accounts of social action involve 'a tension between concealed aspects of events ...and a concern with discovery or revelation of that assumed hidden dimension' (1991:224). For the Kamula this kind of world view is crucially related to the concept nesama which refers to 'image', 'photo', 'copy', 'echo', 'age-mate' and 'business partner' - all words which contain the sense of overt and visible reproduction or double. But nesama also refers to the hidden or unseen as in nesama yu which refers to allegory, parable or metaphorical talk. Nesama can also mean the unseen 'double self or 'spirit double'of all manifest entities. This, usually invisible, 'double self, either in this world or in the unseen mirror world, can undergo significant transformations that may have crucial implications for the manifest entity. In this cosmology, as Schieffelin has noted for the Kaluli, the distinction between the manifest world and its unseen mirror world is crucial because: invisible events are not seen merely as explanations for visible events. They are perceived as an integral part of these e vents... knowledge of the invisible gives not hypothetical explanations about possible causes but real understanding of actual relations among events and leads to a practical strategy for dealing with them (1976:108 fn. 4). But for this essay it is Weiner 's (1995a) recent privileging of 'revelation' as the Melanesian approach to 'production' that is of major interest. He argues that to adequately understand Melanesian forms of productivity we need to invert the base-superstructure model that informs some recent writing on the relation between magic and production (e.g. Geli 1992). Following Heidegger's (1977:14) claim that all technology is a form of reveal- ing, Weiner argues that magic, myth and metaphor, not production, are foundational in Melanesia because they generate the form of the appearance of things in these kinds of economies. He rhetorically asks: what if... it was magic and art that were foundational, as indeed our New Guinea hosts constantly tell us, and that techniques and products and things made are only revealed in their thingly quality through magic and myth, art and poetry ?.. .what if the world of production and making, of consumption and controlling was only elicited (rather than produced) what if it were a reflexive by-product of something else like magic and art? (1995a:33-34). In Weiner's view if art or magic is foundational then our task is to outline the specifi- cally Melanesian aesthetic of bringing forth or eliciting things. Weiner argues this aesthetic involves techne - 'the event of bringing forth something into the open and the know-how required for accomplishing that disclosure' (Zimmerman 1990:230, see Heidegger 1977 for details). In this view the Melanesian elicitation of things is not fundamentally mimetic, rep- resentational or referential, but a creative presentation or manifestation. In Weiner's account 229</page><page sequence="3">Logging, Women and Submarines of the Foi it sometimes appears that mimesis, in the sense of reference, reproduction or like- ness, is secondary, or even irrelevant, to mimesis in the sense of 'bringing forth'. The Foi live in a world where that world and its representations are often tightly, if not totally, uni- fied (Weiner 1991:200; 1995a:36, 1995b: 158; see also Geli 1995:251).3 By way of contrast to Weiner's account I emphasise that the Kamula are often just as interested in maintaining a disjunction between the thing and its 'representation', 'image', or 'double self (nesama) as they are in equating the two, because it is via the gap, between the entity in this world and its constituent nesama in the unseen world, that new things may be generated. It is this unseen component of world - where the double or nesama of a manifest thing is often located - that the transformative potentialities of the refractive dou- ble become most evident (cf. Taussig 1993; Lattas 1992).4 Taussig (1993:126) has called this 'mimetic slippage', involving not merely a doubling, but also a shifting from one state to another through metamorphosis. What is often involved is a form of doubling that pro- duces differences or a new thing. There can also be a shift from a hidden to a manifest state that effectively reveals a new thing. For the Kamula certain forms of productivity involve accessing these kinds of capacities, found in the unseen world of 'bush spirits', to diffract and transform entities or their doubles (nesama) into other entities. In both Weiner's and my approach, images (nesama) and metaphors involve new forms of 'revelation' or visibility because they enable us to see aspects of reality that their production helped to constitute (Black 1993:38). In many Melanesian societies, especially in their magical technologies, images connect entities, making them flow (see Wagner 1986) or transform into each other, not just by analogy, but as much by a process of becoming (Geli 1992:42; Deleuze and Guattari 1988). In the symmetric approach (Latour 1993; M.Strathern 1996) that I favour, image, myth and magic are not relegated to 'ideology' or the non-material, but nor can their materiality be identified with pure presence in the way that Weiner argues can occur for the Foi. As they travel through cir- cuits of transformation and telling they gain varying degrees of ontological stability depending on what they encounter and what they might transform into. In my view magic, metaphor and narratives concerning the dali patalo's transformations of modernity are, contrary to Weiner, no more 'foundational' or ontologically secure than anything else, in part because they do not exist in isolation. They are now formulated in response to, and in conjunction with, the novel, somewhat threatening - but also desirable - powers and things of a modernity dominated by logging. Like Merlán and Rumsey (1991:190), I think people in Papua New Guinea have a deep concern with defining the new political economy and have a number of frameworks for undertaking such definitions. This essay outlines only one of these frameworks by showing how Kamula men redefine their own powers via their changing understandings of 'bush spirits' in the context of industrial logging and broader processes of modernisation. For the Kamula forms of productive power lie in controlling potentially revelatory transformations between seen and unseen. By mapping elements of modernity into their own productive other (the dalipatalo) Kamula men redefine themselves as, if not in control of modernity, at least able to access elements of it via their own ontology of productivity and transformative power (see Kramer 1993). For the Kamula it is as if 'the modernisation process takes place with the claim of opening the gates to hidden sources of social wealth' (Beck 1992: 20), not just with the keys of new techno-scientific developments, but also with the keys of their own mimetic technologies. The new possibilities of value production outlined in the following stories are not solely defined by the Kamula's technologies of magical productivity and abundance. Nor are these processes pre-given by industrial logging, the state power with which it is allied and other social technologies of the new political economy. Rather the processes of eliciting modern things emerge, through the stories outlined below, as disturbing, but fasci- nating - even potentially world transformative - conjunctions of both. 230</page><page sequence="4">Wood THE DALI FATALO AND THEIR GIFTS TO HUNTERS This paper primarily deals with only one category of Kamula 'bush spirits', the dali patalo. They reside in trees in the bush where the Kamula hunt and they also live near the sites of Kamula gardens and houses. They are human like, but usually invisible to humans. They also have wings that they use to fly through and above the forest. In accounts of the dali patalo, their activities, their way of life, houses and technologies appear broadly similar to those of the Kamula. The dali patalo also deliberately intervene in human affairs. Being somewhat tricky characters a dali patalo can sometimes pretend to be a companion who has come with you into the bush. If you call out to your friend, the dali patalo will answer using your friend's voice to draw you further and further into the bush and then you will be left there alone. As Nodiya Imali, outlining the dali patalo's wider role to me, explained 'they imitate us'.5 But the dali patalo world and its things are not identical to the manifest world of the Kamula. For the dali patalo 's power to duplicate is also linked to a capacity to shift shape or transform. The spirit double (nesama) of a dali patalo can sometimes change or trans- form itself into a wild animal, usually a pig or cassowary. A dali patalo can be shot by a human in either its animal or human-like manifestation in this world. Men told me that when shot in its anthropomorphic form it will change into a pig or cassowary as it lies dying. The dali patalo can also play tricks on the hunter, when in his or her manifestation as a pig or cassowary, a dali patalo quite deliberately leads a hunter a long way into the bush and then suddenly disappears, leaving the hunter far from the village. The dali patalo can be quite aggressive towards humans - they often take the 'doubles' (nesama) of Kamula children into their own world with the result that the child often gets sick and, if not promptly reunited with his or her double, may die. For Kamula men, the dali patalo are one of the key sources of an intensified ability to hunt. They are often represented as boosting a man's productivity in hunting by offering magical technologies. In these accounts the dali patalo emerge as gift givers to Kamula men. Such transfers can be relatively simple as when a man, while butchering a cassowary that he has just shot, finds, inside the body of the cassowary, a piece of bamboo made into the tip of an arrow used to kill large game. That man will go on to shoot many cassowaries and will shoot them close to the village or longhouse. Equally, if a man comes across a piece of used firewood near a tree or vine commonly thought to be the house of a dali pata- lo then he should take this back to the longhouse and carefully hide it. After this he will be able to shoot lots of game. In both cases the gift is manifested only when the recipient is alone. The recipient should not mention details of the events to anyone nor should he allow anyone to see the magical technology he has acquired. If he does he will lose the ability to hunt that has been transferred to him. Other accounts of transfers between dali patalo and humans involve quite complex transactions of detachable aspects of potency from the dali patalo. This is evident in Miya Koyali's account of an astoundingly successful hunter who died in the late 1960s: He was sleeping at night and he saw a swollen, bloated man (hoholi oplami) com- ing towards him. The swollen man said to him "you take this boy with you". The man said "I have no wife". His wife had died so he was living as a widower [and could not look after the dali patalo child offered for adoption]. And he had a dream (milam 'natili). Very close to his mosquito net there was a boy. And he thought to himself "I have had a dream (milam 'natili)". But the boy was gone. And then in the morning he went to shoot cassowaries from a blind. He went and watched and a cassowary came. He was just putting his steel tipped arrow in the bow and the cassowary ran away and lay down dying. He went up to it - there was much blood. It ran away further, but he came up to it and speared it... he 231</page><page sequence="5">Logging, Women and Submarines butchered it and started to carry it back to the house. He saw another cassowary on the path. It ran away. When he looked at it, it died. The cassowary died. He thought to himself "What did this? Just by looking at it with my eyes it died". He butchered it and took it to the house... He shot lots. He didn't use his bow. He just looked at the cassowary with his eyes and it died. He would look with his sharp eyes [he now has a "sharpened", visionary capacity to see]. He shot many animals - pigs, cassowaries, birds [the unseen dali patalo boy would actually shoot the game for him - the boy was like his assistant even though he could not see the boy]. The dali patalo man who had given him the small boy had told him "if you shoot a cassowary with a man's skin and a cassowary's skin you will die". He was shooting animals at Testapl. He was hunting there and he and his wife came across a very big cassowary with a very tall casque. He did not look at the cassowary, but turned his head away [so as not to kill it]. But his wife said to him "It is a really big cassowary shoot it!". And then he looked at it. When he looked at it, it died. He told his wife to go to the house. He saw the tall casque and thought "I am fin- ished". He butchered the cassowary and the skin that looked like a man's skin he cut that off and threw it away. He took the meat to the house and told his wife to carefully look after their small children. He spoke these commands to his wife. He got pneumonia that night and died. That is what happened. Dali patalo quite often appear to men as 'swollen' or 'bloated' (hoholi - a state asso- ciated with the swelling of dead bodies and flesh surrounding tropical ulcers and sores). Miya explained that in his story this swollen state was transferred to the man who had the vision of the dali patalo - it was the 'strength' (or power) that contributed to the man's capacity to be a successful hunter along with the gift of the child. In this kind of account the hunter's body is transformed by its incorporation of aspects of the dali patalo 's body. Miya's story evokes not merely a siblingship based on the sharing of substance, but a sib- lingship based on the gift of a male child from dali patalo to human. Among the Kamula such transactions involving sons primarily take place between brothers and Miya's story can be understood as outlining the attempt by the dali patalo to create this kind of relationship. Miya's story also sets up a further level of identity through the device of doubling between the human hunter and his dali patalo foster child - they travel and hunt together and while they are almost aspects of the same thing, they never become totally identical. Miya's story out- lines how productivity flows out of a relationship of parallel doubling between the seen and unseen, the man and the dali patalo. It is a relationship based on shared identity, siblingship, parent-child ties and gift giving. The hunter, the source of his productivity and his product are incorporated into an ontology where they all become different aspects of the same thing. Not all relationships with the dali patalo involving the acquisition of hunting ability transformed the parties into such a strong state of identification. Sarkwe, now an elderly Kasigi man, was shot in the leg by a swollen dali patalo while checking a sago swamp for pigs. He killed the dali patalo and after his wound healed he went on to kill lots of game. He was understood to have acquired this power from the dali patalo. Miya, a much younger man, told me that he had seen one of the bloated dali patalo, but was too frightened to shoot him lest he retaliated. As a result of this decision he failed to gain the extraordinary hunting ability that some of the elder Kasigi men have acquired. Another kind of interaction with the dali patalo involves their women. If you see a woman jumping or falling down from a big tree then you will know that a dali patalo man is getting rid of a wife he cannot stand any more. If you shoot her in her womanly manifes- tation she will transform into a cassowary. In other accounts a fight may almost develop between the hunter and other dali patalo who come to defend the woman. However, the bush spirits retreat rather than shoot and kill the man. After surviving this ordeal, and hav- ing eaten the cassowary-cfa// patalo, the hunter is able to shoot many cassowaries close to 232</page><page sequence="6">Wood the village - sometimes two at a time. The hunter who tells how he acquired such powers will lose them. Such transfers of power create a self-contained autonomous or non-relation- al individual who transcends ordinary sociality. The hunter's body, open to the flow of gifts from dali patalo, is partially closed to interaction with humans. At times this secrecy was explained to me in ways that imply that retelling is tantamount to transferring the associated power to hunt to the listener. That is, the copy is as powerful as the actual event. At other times, as indicated in Miya's story where the hunter's wife eggs him on to shoot his own manifestation (nesama), the secrecy and withdrawal into solitude seem to especially concern men's relationship with women as wives. Maintaining distance from his wife would have protected the potentially vulnerable hunter from the consequences of his extraordinary self-identification with the objects of his productive power. The magical transfers from dali patalo are always said to be a secret. This secrecy maintains the power transferred by the dali patalo by preserving a distinction between the overt or widely known, which would diffuse the power and effecacy of the secret, and the hidden or secret that preserves it. Lattas (1992:45) has argued, with reference to the Kaliai, that this distinction is iconic of the general model of productivity being employed, since it crucially relies on a unique mediation of the distinction between seen and unseen, manifest and hidden. Also crucial here is the idea that the duplicating power of the 'image' or 'spirit double' (nesama) of a thing is also a 'self-transforming power' (Taussig, 1993:126) that is productive of new things. Since this productivity involves doubling it comes 'to be absorbed into the doubleness of the secret' (Lattas 1992:45) and hence the secret replicates and contains this power. Another element of the productive agency contained in Miya's account is the role of dreams and special kinds of seeing or revealing. Dreams that involve access to messages or gifts from the usually hidden aspects of the world tend to be referred to as milam 'natili rather than by milamalo 'natili the other Kamula term for dream. Also involved in this kind of productivity is the ability, outside a dream, to be able to see the dali patalo and enter into their world, talk to them and receive gifts. These kinds of interactions are usually said to involve a 'vision' (inoma mayelopi - literally 'different eyes'). But Kamula occasionally extend milam 'natili to manifestations of the dali patalo and their gifts that occur in the 'open' (haliomali dia) everyday world. Such appearances of the dali patalo are sometimes said to be 'like a dream' (milam 'natili epapili). These accounts point to the significance of specific forms of revelation or vision as crucial to these forms of productivity. This reflects a wider Kamuia orientation, found elsewhere in Papua New Guinea (e.g. see Weiner 1991:45), that values seeing as a form of knowledge over other forms of knowledge (such as reporting an event not witnessed). The ability to enter or reveal the usually non-visible realm is not always controlled by the Kamula, but rather the dali patalo choose to reveal themselves to specific Kamula. Some Kamula now link a man's ability to see the dali patalo and access their gift giving to the practice of 'ancestral laws and customs' (toto koko). Such men's bodies were primed to acquire these capacities whereas younger men, by not following custom, are said to have now lost the ability to access the hunting powers made available by the dali patalo: The youngsters - nothing - they can't have these dreams (milam 'natili). Why? Our ancestors before. Our Kamula ancestors in their day - boys like us or like my younger brother. Turtles, megapode eggs, megapodes... turtle eggs they did not eat these. They lived like that and grew. When they were single men then they would get that food and not eat it. They would always follow these customs. The dali pat- alo would reveal themselves. They would regularly see them and gain the ability to hunt. Now as for us who are still young. Turtle, turtle eggs, megapod eggs, large turtle . . . cassowary brains and bone marrow we ate all these things. And so we can- not see the dali patalo. We did not follow our ancestor customs and prohibitions 233</page><page sequence="7">Logging, Women and Submarines and so we have no way to have these dreams (milam 'natili). Older men, like Hapiye, they really listened to the instructions of their ancestors. So they got it - the ability to shoot plenty of game. Now we live without this ability (Miya Koyali). In this account younger men have inappropriately structured their bodies by failing to follow custom and are consequently unable to appropriate or channel the gifts of the dali patalo into their bodies. This is part of a wider sense of unease (further discussed below) about the Kamula's ability to produce socially effective men in the context of modernity. Young men are sometimes said to be lazy, thin and prematurely old because of their close sexual association with their wives. These sorts of ideas are not confined to hyper-critical older men - Akabu, a newly married man of 19, told me that he thought the old days were good because then men and women slept separately, but now they slept and lived together and so there was now much sickness and death among men. Precisely this kind of associa- tion of women and death is found in Miya's story in that the hunter's wife is portrayed as responsible for her husband's eventual death. Another feature of Kamula men's relationship with the dali patalo highlighted in these stories is that they require good interpretative skills, an ability to make quick decisions based on their interpretation of the event as it unfolds and a capacity to reflexively monitor their own interpretation. In the account of the man who could hunt by looking, the teller empha- sises that he has to confirm to himself the status of what he has seen and this then makes sense of not only his ability to hunt, but the course of his life. There are a number of other entities that could be responsible for producing the kind of events often associated with dali patalo - including manifestations of witches or their 4evil spirits' (se or aiyaluma); other bush spirits who were also crucial familiars to mediums (banakaka - now sometimes equat- ed with the dali patalo) ; spirits of entities that live in the Bosavi; water dwelling spirits; real humans or their spirit doubles (nesama); site specific entities (often named and associated with well known stories) as well as the strange things (like dragons, huge black helicopters, submarines) that can emerge from time to time and which may be a sign of something more fundamental (such as oil, gas or Satan). Hence the Kamula have to make sense of an event and evaluate risk in terms of a wide variety of possible interpretations. Any such event itself is subject to fiirther interpretative effort (cf. Merlán and Rumsey, 1991:229), as reflected in the stories in this essay, which stabilise certain interpretations, but not others. Moreover, as Povinelli (1995:511; 1993), has noted from her work in Australia, establishing a convincing account of an ambiguous event also implies the ability to define potential rights and obliga- tions between the entities thought to be operating in the event and defines a basis for further action. In this process of interpretation and other forms of action, the entities in the transac- tion - like dali patalo and Kamula men - come to be defined. But sometimes this process of definition is not always clear. The dali patalo being some- what tricky themselves often appear in the stories with a degree of hedging or ambiguity. The parties can fail to adequately interpret what is required of each other. This is exemplified in the following story of a young man who failed to adequately receive the dali patalo s offered gift: Dupuwa went to hunt cassowaries. As he was making a blind he saw a fallen tree that might have made a good house pole. As he was looking at it he heard a sound 'dudududu' of something running on the ground. He looked and he saw a man with one of his arms cut off. He ran away into a hole in the ground and a cloud of black flies gathered overhead. Then he went back and sat in the blind. And he shot a cas- sowary. This was like a dream (milam 'natili epapili). He gained the ability to shoot lots of cassowaries. He shot five or ten. But the last cassowary he shot he could not tie on to his bundle since there were so many. He left one in the mud [to retrieve later]. And so he gave up his ability to shoot. He went back to the house and soon his body was covered in tropical ulcers. And now he can't shoot (Nathan Dekopuwe). 234</page><page sequence="8">Wood According to the Kamula who listened to Nathan's account, Dupuwa failed to under- stand that his action of leaving one of the cassowaries would be interpreted by the dali pata- lo as indicating that he did not really want to gain the ability to shoot extremely successful- ly. So they took it back. But Dupuwa, and any Kamula listener to this story, is also confronted with the possibil- ity that what he may have experienced was something else entirely, as there are a number of hints in this story that associate the events with witches and their 'evil spirits' (aiyaluma or se). The sound Dupuwa hears is clearly defined as being on the ground and, according to some men, one of the characteristics of witches is that their 'evil spirit' travels along the ground and that to avoid that power one should get off the ground. Dupuwa does not do this, but hides inside a hole in the ground. Such holes were occasionally used as disposal sites for the body of a person executed for being a witch. The hints at the presence of witch- craft in Nathan's story create a sense that accessing the power of the dali patalo is danger- ously similar to coming into contact with the witch's 'evil spirit' - a figure that is an amplified, more dangerously destructive, version of the same transformational power the Kamula encounter in their dealings with the dali patalo. Dupuwa is placed in a situation where the acquisition of a new technique is presented as analogous to occupying a similar space to that occupied by a witch's 'evil spirit'. The ability to hunt is not effectively trans- ferred and any potential relationship spirals dangerously out of Dupuwa's control. MONEY, LOGGING AND THE DALI PATALO The material presented indicates that for the Kamula the achievement of an increment in value through hunting is often derived from forms of mimesis involving replicative trans- formations (of the nesama of a dali patalo into game)6 and metonymically detachable and often transformable aspects of the dali patalo (such as his swollen state, child, wife and firewood). The gifts from the dali patalo, through their transformational capacities, create effective hunters. The unseen realm emerges as the major location of transformative dou- bling and as such, a key site of replicative excess, of productive abundance. But the danger is that it is also the site where one's self (in the form of one's own nesama) can be subject to pressure to become similar to something else that is not fully human (such as a cassowary in Miya's story or a witch in Nathan's). So the domain of transformative power, while produc- tively replicative or incremental, can threaten the integrity of the self. Other threats to the Kamula's sense of self worth are the new powers unleashed by con- temporary capitalism. I want to now outline how the dali patalo through their capacity to undertake transformative mimesis, are able to appropriate to themselves many of the pro- ductive powers of capitalism. They are themselves now engaged in new forms of produc- tion such as logging. The gifts, powers and capacities they now convey to the Kamula extend beyond hunting ability to other things such as money, women and smart children. An initial sense of this new kind of empowerment is found in Akabu's account of what he learned at the Pacific Woods Contractors (PWC) logging camp from some single men from Kiunga. They told him: If a cassowary is lying down dying you cut off its talon and put it in a dead leaf. And then on top you put another dead leaf. You don't talk [to other people] about the thing you have brought with you. You hide it as you bring it to the house. And you live there and you can get access to the dali patalo and regularly talk to them. You take the cassowary talon to a big tree in the bush or under a large vine. You push it into the ground into the roots and you will have a vision [inoma mayelopi]. It is like the stairs to the dali patalo's house. You will see the dali patalo - you will be sitting in one of their firewood shelters. Or in their garden that is where you will sit and look at them. You see what they are doing but they will still not 235</page><page sequence="9">Logging, Women and Submarines see you. When you speak to them they will see you. If you don't speak and just sit watching they will just speak their other languages. But if you speak Kamula then they will talk to you. If you speak English, Gogodala or pidgin they will kill you. 'You are not one of us' they will say. But if you appear as one of them then your life will be saved. In this case they will ask in Kamula 'why have you come?' And you will say 'oh I do not have any money. I came to you to look for money.' [They will say] 'Oh take this magic. From this custom money will come'. They will help. They will give you money or magic. Or they will give to you things to do with the problem that was worrying you. You take the things. And then you go to the store and the money you give away there, that money will come back to you. The store keeper man will put the money in the bank, but it will come back to you. It comes back into your pocket. It will appear by itself. This sort of thing you will get from the dali patalo for when you finish all your money at the store. You can trick the store man... You take out the cassowary talon from the ground after you have fin- ished talking to the dali patalo. Then you go around like a real person. Along with facilitating people's access to money and store goods the dali patalo are worked into 'new' accounts of their response to industrial logging. Many of the themes out- lined in the earlier consideration of the role of dali patalo in hunting re-emerge. Kamula working in the Wawoi-Guavi logging concession told me that the dali patalo are the 'own- ers' or the 'father' of the trees being cut. In some accounts they are said to be the spirit dou- ble of the tree itself or, more commonly, certain trees, especially fig trees, are said to be the home of the dali patalo. Chopping down a tree is equivalent to killing or hitting the spirits or making them homeless. They get especially angry at this and will chop down trees them- selves with the deliberate intent of killing or injuring the chain saw operators and other work- ers. Occasionally certain trees known to be dali patalo houses are preserved rather than cut. The dali patalo have also taken to industrial logging. Workers hear the noise of the dali patalo's trucks and chain saws as the dali patalo go about their own work of deforestation. So just as the bush spirits mirror the Kamula's own hunting, now they also mirror logging, this new form of male productivity. Nodiya explained to me that the dali patalo 'get the nesama ('image', 'double') of the chain saw' and the other equipment now used in the log- ging concession. They deploy the nesama of this technology to produce their own houses and logs according to their 'management purposes'. They also use bulldozers to expand the size of rivers so they can run their canoes up and down them. What is involved here is a kind of reproduction - a reflexive production of a new form of production (cf. Turner 1988:242) - by the dali patalo. This logging by dali patalo threatens the workers - if you hear the noise of the dali patalo operations you are well advised not to go in the bush because there is a risk you will be hit by one of the trees they are cutting. Moreover, you cannot actually see where they are working or where they have worked - nothing is manifested to indicate likely danger spots. So when the workers hear the bush spirits it is better they stay out of the bush on already established paths. From one perspective these stories indicate a deep concern about the workers' relation- ship to logging and their inability to be fully secure in such an environment. But these sto- ries also reiterate the Kamula's fundamental assumption that key forms of productivity always involve a process of interrelating the seen and unseen components of the world. In my view the Kamula are here seeking to impose their own theory of productivity on to one of the most powerful social technologies operating in Papua New Guinea today by incorpo- rating it into the mimetic processes that continue to be crucial to Kamula self-production (cf. Turner 1988:256). The Kamula account of male productivity involves more than just pure presence; rather in the shuttling from new thing to copy (and from copy to new thing) the manifest presence of that thing incorporates its unseen or implicit aspect. As Lattas 236</page><page sequence="10">Wood argues 'the modalities for revealing the real, for creating a sense of presence are determined by a culture's sense of the hidden' (in progress: 10, see also Weiner 1995a). The Kamula copy the unmediated self-evident presence of industrial logging back into the unseen realm so that a complex negotiation of the distinction between a thing and its copy (nesama), the seen and unseen, could potentially be re-established. But industrial logging is not simply copied - it is transformed. Specifically the log- ging of the dalipatalo is not the same as that found in the manifest world because they, and not the Malaysian management, run all aspects of the operation. The dali patalo through these stories are shown to have the capacity to copy and autonomously organise logging in ways that the Kamula are as yet unable to achieve. But the dali patalo have placed such control on the horizon of Kamula expectations, for as we have seen in reference to hunting, it is through accessing the replicative and transformative powers of the dali patalo that Kamula men often become extraordinarily productive. And so these narratives open up a new geography of modernity that, from a Kamula perspective, substantively transforms the new technology into something that is being realised in a manner that conforms to the Kamula's own knowledge of the production or manifestation of things. To this extent, through their narratives, they take control of things - not just in the sense of merely re- conceptualising logging, but by restructuring its constitutive elements they fundamentally alter the possibilities logging might contain. REPRODUCTIVE MIMESIS AND THE DALIPATALO1 Further evidence of the dali patalo 's ability to productively transfer to the Kamula aspects of a logging inflected modernity is found in stories about sex and marriage with dali patalo women. These stories reveal another form of mimesis that the Kamula now attribute to the dali patalo - their role in giving birth to new kinds of children fathered by Kamula men. The stories that articulate this possibility also re-evaluate the way the Kamula men seek to organise marriage and regulate the distribution of reproductivity and sexuality. These stories of the dalipatalo 's new gifts suggest a capacity to maintain the integrity of men's bodies in the context of largely logging related changes in their experience of sex and gender and thus the stories radically redefine the potential of men's relationships with women. In particular, these stories intersect with, and rework, Kamula ideas concerning sexuali- ty especially illicit sex. For the Kamula sexual intercourse outside marriage may result in the body of either the man or the woman becoming the locus of a witch's 'evil spirit'. Since a witch is somebody who devours and kills his or her co-residents, the witch is not just an image of misdirected sexual desire, but also of a consuming desire unstructured or uncon- strained by the requirements of ordinary sociality. The transformation of practitioners of illicit sex into cannibalistic witches occurs partly because the parties enter into a non-human realm, where the distribution of sexuality and reproductivity is no longer regulated by the moral economy of reciprocity underlying the organisation of marriage by sister-spouse exchange. Ideas linking witchcraft and sexuality are in this sense fundamentally linked to the moral organisation of Kamula marriage, family and personhood. But the basic ideas and practices associated with the reproduction of Kamula families are now being challenged by the opportunities for illicit sex opening up to modern Kamula men. Logging has facilitated an association of promiscuous male sexuality with wealth, power and modernity (with its 'new custom' or 'new way of doing things'). This only became an easily enactable form when Kamula men started travelling to the Wawoi-Guavi concession and when visiting Port Moresby as members of landowner delegations recruited by interested logging companies. In both places the association of sex and witchcraft became weakened. From the Kamula men's perspective the availability of casual sex in these places was something to be welcomed and actively pursued. Some men argue that they will only become a witch if they have illicit sex with Kamula women. Others suggest 237</page><page sequence="11">Logging, Women and Submarines that 'reciprocating' (asiyama) by making payment for sex prevents the emergence of the 'evil spirit', whereas unreciprocated illicit sex will result in its emergence. Maybe the cus- tom of 'evil spirit' only operates in the village, but not in Moresby where the 'custom' is different because there are no 'evil spirits'? Others now claim that if you don't worry about the possibility of the 'evil spirit' then nothing will happen to you. Nonetheless, some peo- ple, especially those new to 'Moresby custom', do express concern at the 'bad custom' of buying sex in Moresby and Wawoi-Guavi and refuse to indulge, claiming to be frightened about both sickness and 'evil spirits'. But generally most Kamula who visit Moresby active- ly pursue sexual affairs in displays of their new wealth (provided by the logging company) and power. They are enacting a somewhat transgressive power to enter a new world - a world unconstrained by the demands of a moral economy based on reciprocal marriage exchanges, a new world where desires can be expressed and gratified in ways that are unconstrained by past 'laws' or 'prohibitions' (aiyaluma) or by concerns about witchcraft. These potentially dangerous opportunities are evident in the stories men tell that explore the possibility of having sex with, and then marrying, dali patalo women. The sto- ries redefine male sexuality as having the power to transcend the power of witchcraft and contain the promise to men that they can reproduce new kinds of persons who can effective- ly enter modernity. In these stories the dali patalo are shown to make gifts of their transfor- mative mimetic powers, especially their reproductive powers. Arguably this gift giving is analogous to their capacity to significantly boost a man's hunting ability. Some of these themes are evident in Kaiya Mapi's version of events that apparently occurred in the Sepik area: There was a man going to his bush house by himself. He was going down a steep ridge when he came across a group of women. They had all sorts of strange food in their net bags [snakes, frogs, very large snake-like earth worms (waheli) - this worm is a widely known manifestation of the witch's evil spirit]. He hid because he was afraid. They were arranged in order of birth and were totally naked. The last one was the youngest with firm breasts. The eldest called out 'Come quickly'. But the youngest stopped to pull out of the ground a large earth worm (waheli). While she did this the others had moved a long way off - 40 km or so. He approached her and said would you like to come with me to my village. She said she would go with him. On the way he had sex with her. She told him to have sex with her quickly otherwise her father would be very angry and powerful, but if he had sex with her then her father's strength would be finished. The man's 'blood' would kill [or make ineffec- tive] the woman's blood that linked her to her father. Then there was a big wind. She said that was her father coming and that he would not kill either of them. And the father did not kill her. They travelled back to the village. On the way back he fed her sweet potato. He also threw away her net bag with all the strange food contained in it. When he got to his village he sat her down in a garden of bananas. Then he went and told his sister that he had come with a woman he wanted to marry. So his sister went and saw the woman and gave her some of her clothes. The couple have had some children - one of whom is now a pilot and the other a university student. Even though this is a story that refers to events in the 'Sepik-Madang' area, these kinds of dali patalo women can be found in the land around the PWC camp where (in 1997) most Kamula forestry workers lived. Kaiya explained that if you saw one of these local dali pata- lo women you should not be frightened and run away. If you were 'lucky' enough to see one 'you should grab her and immediately have sex' and then take her home. That way her 'strength' will be overcome and she will not go back to her father lest he be angry at her. Nor according to Kaiya should you worry about the 'evil spirit' of a witch or that sort of thing, because what will emerge from the association will be extremely bright children. 238</page><page sequence="12">Wood One PWC worker, Eric, a Gogodala man whose father had been a pastor to the Kamula at Wawoi Falls, almost achieved this desirable relationship with a dali patalo woman who lived near the camp site. Emesiye's son, Akabu, told me that: One day in the evening Eric was coming back from the ridge near the PWC camp. As he came back he saw the dali patalo there. One was like a white skin. She had very long hair. She spoke a mixture of English and Gogodala to Eric. When Eric saw the woman he looked back to the camp but it was dark - there were no lights so he could not see it. And he went with the woman. They went to 39 kilo [and had sex] and then came back. Eric then went to the woman's house. He went to the dali patalo house. The woman went and spoke to her kinsmen. They asked Eric 'will you marry this woman?' And he said 'I will live with her'. They discussed things and he said to the dali patalo 'Oh I am going to the house. I am going back to my place'. He went down from the dali patalo house to the earth. When he touched the ground the PWC camp was lit up. He went to the washing place [which is where his girlfriend's father is known to live]. He was there and the woman's father came and told him 'you have made my girl's body bad. You have spoilt her body. And so you will marry her'. And then he went to his house and the door was open. The dali patalo woman had opened it. His brothers had locked the door when they went to sleep. It had opened by itself. He went and lay down to sleep. His brothers asked where have you been. His skin was covered with rotting foliage. They heated some water on the fire. They washed his skin with hot water and soap. And they washed him. Then a Bamu man - a medium - came and told him 'you will not marry this woman'. He blocked the path. So he did not marry her. In explaining this text I was told that his skin was covered with large earth worms (waheli), rotting foliage and fruits. These are the foods of the dali patalo so he was partially transforming himself into their food as he increasingly identified with their life-world. But the recurrent association of dali patalo and these worms can also be understood to represent the dali patalo as dangerous, possibly witchlike (who might start to consume parts of Eric's trans- formed body). In this case the links between the human and the dali patalo appear too danger- ously unstable and further development of the relationship was blocked by the medium. Despite such dangers, successful relationships with these kinds of non-human agents are known to have occurred in other parts of the country. As Nodiya explained to me in Balimo: There was news from the Madang - that the first man to marry a masalai was a Sepik man. He cut his name into a tree. Later he went back to that tree and he saw a woman there with his name on her leg. They became friends and talked about getting married. They set the date of the marriage for January 1, 1997. This was in the news all over the country. It was in the newspapers, but no newspapers have come from Moresby since Christmas (English paraphrase). The emphasis on Madang and the Sepik region as the places where relationships have been successfully established with masalai women in part reflects Kamula men's self-percep- tion of their own inferiority compared to the skills of workers from other provinces. In partic- ular at PWC, most of the elite workers, who often train new Kamula workers, were from the Sepik and Madang regions. Hence I think, from a Kamula perspective, it is appropriate that men first developed ways of dealing with these new kinds of bush spirits in the Sepik-Madang region, rather than in the Western Province. Knowledge concerning masalai flows, like other forms of new knowledge, from these regions rather than from the Kamula's own domain. These stories fundamentally rework and positively revalue illicit sex, especially male sexuality, as capable of disempowering the witchlike dali patalo women (a metaphor of all 239</page><page sequence="13">Logging, Women and Submarines the other strange women the Kamula men have now started to encounter) and their powerful kin. Further, these accounts position peripheral women - like the dalipatalo - as links to modernity with Kamula women being implicitly positioned as less able to mediate such connections. And indeed a number of Kamula men have temporarily, and sometimes perma- nently, abandoned their Kamula wives for new wives from more distant areas. The stories of marrying dalipatalo women are optimistic accounts of such processes in that male sexu- ality has the power to safely transform the dali patalo into a domestic relationship that ensures access to modernity through the reproduction of smart children. This is exemplified in the figure of the pilot who, like his parents, possesses a remarkable capacity to link seen and unseen worlds and transcend the distance between the two. GUNS, LOGGING AND EVIL VIOLENCE Another site for the productive mediation of seen and unseen, near and far involves the recent emergence out of local rivers of submarines, submarine people and their guns. I first started hearing submarine stories in July 1 995. 8 But they were pre-figured in the story of the creation of the extraordinarily clear and reflective Kamki spring. While water is often encoded in Kamula myth as a locus of alien, often destructive, powers, in accounts of the origin of Kamki, water is linked with the creation of modern 'things' (clothes, steel axes, engines etc) through the intervention of the ancestors of the Australians (see Wood 1995 for further details). A submersible boat then travels inside, not on top of, the Aramia river and its tributaries, before going to Australia to give all the modern things to the 'white skins' whose ancestors were travelling inside the boat. While no Kamula put it to me in these terms, the submersible boat is something of a prototype of contemporary submarines and the gifts of guns from the submarine people could be understood as the return of some of the 'things' originally alienated from Kamula. In some accounts it is the Australian govern- ment or army that is said to be sending the submarines. Australia does this because Papua New Guinea is like Australia's daughter and consequently the Australians are now trying to help Papua New Guinea partly because the 'Asian' companies are not helping the people. The submarines now regularly travel up the Aramia, Wawoi and Bamu rivers. In some versions a mother submarine comes up to the mouth of these rivers and releases smaller sub- marines which then travel upstream. The operators of the submarine meet with a man and give him a gun and ammunition and, in some versions, distribute uniforms and military equipment such as a portable radio, knives, a compass, etc. The people in the submarine give out guns to those selected men who want them. These guns - pump action rifles, pistols, guns with laser sights - are in profusion in the submarine. Once you get a gun your name and village are entered in a computer. In some accounts the submarine computer already con- tains the names of people and the kind of gun they will get. Sometimes the guns are given in exchange for marijuana or cash, but most accounts stress that the submarine crew simply give the guns and equipment without any reciprocity. In one account the submarine people also provide two weeks training in the bush on how to operate the guns. They are establish- ing something like an army and they have their 'agents' in every village in the Balimo area. A more detailed idea of the transfer of guns from the submarine people to Kamula men is conveyed in an account of Nathan's visit into a submarine that had travelled high up the Bamu river into Agila, one of its tributaries, that is very close to the PWC base camp: Nathan was fishing at Agila. It appeared covered in weeds. It was like an ugu [a Gogodala word the Kamula use to refer to dangerous water dwelling beings]. He was fishing pulling up the line when it came up. He ran away but then he thought 'oh this is how you get guns' and he went back. He looked in the water and then a dark object appeared.9 It came out of the water [its front opened up like a crocodile's mouth] and a woman got out and threatened him with a gun. 240</page><page sequence="14">Wood He put up his hands lifting up his bamboo bow in a gesture of surrender. He could not escape because he was out on a fallen tree. She then gave him bubble gum. Inside the gum there was something that made his head spin. Then she wiped 'black power' above and below her eyes [it's like oil, but was explained to me as magic]. And she told him to go in. She then abruptly disappeared - she was suddenly at the other end of the submarine talking to her boss. [This capacity to shift place invisibly was explained as an effect of the 'black power'.] Nathan went in but he couldn't see her anywhere. He went to her room but it was locked. Then he saw her and she asked him what things he wanted. She wrote down a list of the things: 2 rifles, each with 50 rounds 1 hand-held radio 1 uniform 1 cup, 1 plate, 1 spade But they told him he was too young. He was still only 18. He should come back when he was 19. They put the date as 1/1/97 at Daiyapi [a logging camp on the Wawoi regularly visited by Kamula from Wawoi Falls]. But he missed this ren- dezvous They asked him where was he from. 'Wawoi Falls'. They had been there looking for Miya, but only saw a woman sitting fishing in the river. So they did not surface to give guns. They only come up when they see a man. They were looking for Miya. Miya now has a pistol and a uniform. He cannot show this in the open. Otherwise they will kill him (Akabu Emesiye). In my view these accounts reveal an integration of Western things (guns) with Kamula forms of productivity by shifting the alien submarine people into the category of gift-givers analogous to the dali patalo. The story initially defines the submarine as something like, but not identical to, an ugu. So far as I am aware there is no specifically Kamula proper name for these 'water spirits' - one Kamula translation of ugu is 'able to live in the water' (yu dulu dia balano). These water spirits, often covered in weeds, tend to be associated with specific named places such as unusually large areas of water in river bends or, as with Diliki, a danger- ous place for canoes where the Wawoi River is forced between two narrow cliffs. These water spirits are capable of capsizing canoes and pulling a person into the water and drowning them. In the accounts I have recorded they do not give things to the Kamula as do the dali patalo. But in Gogodala ugu also meant 'spiritual force' (Crawford 1981:50) - in this sense the 'ugu of canoes is what used to drive them and make them powerful' (Alison Dundon pers. comm.). There is also some suggestion that in the past ugu were, through a medium, able to transfer knowledge concerning likely dangers such as the coming of enemies (Alison Dundon pers.comm.). These more specifically Gogodala ideas are, perhaps, reproduced in the stories of the submarine operators since they are understood to give the guns to protect the recipients from possible danger (such as rascals or from events associated with the apocalypse). The submarine operators are also like the dali patalo in that both secretly transfer power. The submarine operators will monitor people in groups, but they will only surface and make contact when a man is alone. The guns cannot be shown in public - the only indication that they are around is that people hear them at night when the owner uses them to hunt. As Akabu explained: Your nesama ('image', 'spirit double') is in the computer. If you tell anyone about the details you will die. Or if you use the guns against your own people you will die. They will shoot your nesama in the computer and you will die. 241</page><page sequence="15">Logging, Women and Submarines This account, and that concerning Nathan, echoes the idea, also found in stories of transactions with the dali patalo, that the gifts these kinds of entities give may require reci- procity in the form of the recipient's life. More crucially this account also suggests that sub- marine people exercise control over the Kamula through controlling the Kamula's nesama. This reiterates the Kamula's basic assumption that reality is crucially structured by transfor- mations in the unseen component of that reality. It reiterates the idea that control of the 'other' can often best be exercised by control of their form-shifting double. There are lots of ideas as to why the submarine people give the guns to the Kamula. Some people suggest it is to help them when One World Government emerges prior to the year 2000. This is a time when people simply do not know what is going to happen - perhaps all property will be owned by the new Government and people will starve. Any infringement of the new property regime will be punished by execution. Other men think the submarines might be giv- ing the guns in preparation for the third world war that will precede the year 2000. They are helping different groups in the Western Province now, but in the war the submarine people will not help. Rather each group will fight alone. In some versions the crew of the submarine is said to be made up of supporters of the Irian Jaya independence movement (Organisasi Papua Merdeka - OPM) and the people (such as the Suki and Gogodala) who have already received arms are now linking themselves with the OPM. They will help the OPM to liberate themselves and then later the OPM will help groups, like the Gogodala, with their problems. Some Kamula men claim they need the guns for dealing with rascals either in the vil- lage or when they visit Moresby. Others say they will also be used in relation to the forth- coming development of the Makapa forestry project. They claim that caches of arms are now being built up in some villages close to the project. If there are any problems with the project they will use the guns to destroy it - as one man put it 'now the people will not have respect. It is a new way'. In mid-1996, Kamula working in Block One of the Wawoi- Guavi concession saw the guns as potentially useful in work related disputes with the log- ging company. One man explained how he and his Gogodala friends were talking about 'doing evil'. He said they would do a 'back deal' with the police at Balimo and leave with them statements that justified their actions. Then one day, after they had got their guns either from national 'dealers' or from the submarine people, they would blow up the base and maybe kill the manager - they would tear the place down like a 'revolutionary army'. Later that year a Malaysian supervisor at Block One was killed by a disgruntled work- er. The background to the death was a reputed promise made by the supervisor to the chain- saw operators that he would increase their pay if they increased output. The workers kept their part of the bargain and increased their output, but there was no increase in their pay. They argued with the supervisor and they went on strike. During an argument the supervisor was stabbed by one of the strikers. In other versions the supervisor came and told the strik- ers to go to work and when they refused he went to get his gun to force them back to work. The manager had apparently done this kind of thing before and the workers had reported the earlier incidents to the police: They had reported him to the police. The police said if he did this again they should kill him. The man who stabbed him had these thoughts in mind. He was thinking of what the police had said. So he stabbed him. He got off free. He is a free man (Melanesian Pidgin - paraphrase). While in this account the attacker suffered no punishment by the state, those who went on strike were later sacked by management and there was no pay increase.10 For the Kamula workers, pay and lack of promotion were key issues in their experience of the work place. In early 1997, most Kamula in the Wawoi-Guavi concession were pri- marily employed in low paying jobs such as assistants to chainsaw operators, assistants to dozer operators or as cross-cutters (who trimmed already cut logs). These workers took 242</page><page sequence="16">Wood home an average fortnightly income of around K50 (after bookings from the store were deducted). In certain weeks, especially during the wet season when few days of paid work were available, some men took home less than K15 per fortnight. Some idea of Kamula resentment and anger caused by low pay is reflected in a cross-cutter's account of the mur- der of the supervisor at Block One: The Sepik chain saw operator was working for two weeks. He got his pay and it was only 19 kina. He went to the paymaster and he said 'It's not my responsibility see the boss'. So he went there and argued 'Am I your dog? I am a man! A dog can go from house to house and eat left over rubbish. But I am a man. I have to buy my own food. I have a family. This 19 kina is not enough for me'. They argued and he killed him. The court said the wrong was with the man killed not him, so they sent him home. Maybe Bill [a Kamula worker] will do the same to the Acting Camp Manager. Bill was widely understood by Kamula fellow workers to be a victim of a 'wantok sys- tem' that favoured the more experienced and skilled workers from Madang and the Sepik. Bill had gained no promotions and management rejected his claims to skill and knowledge. While I was at PWC Bill was demoted from hookman to a general hand at the logging pond. He and a number of other Kamula workers immediately started planning their resignations. After they had resigned they planned to come back and blow up the place. They knew the magic (osolo) for bringing down the clouds so that they could not be seen. They also had magic for making the police say nothing against them. Under the impact of this magic the police would be quiet or even 'happy' (siyeli) that they blew up the place. Consequently they would not be beaten up by the police. In any case, the police know only of 'rascals' from Balimo and Kamusi, but not from Wawoi Falls. Bill was thinking of making a 'map' so they could plan their retreat and talked in enthusiastic detail about how he would make bombs and a howitzer that he had seen Rambo make. He thought they should blow up the generators because then everything else would be destroyed. He said that by the time I next come back to Papua New Guinea they should have given the company a 'warning'. But by the next day it had become more equivo- cal - Bill thought that maybe in the year 2000 they would come and fight the 'Chinese'." Understood in the context of such work-related conflicts the stories of the gun-giving submarine people emerge as sources of potential resistance and transformative challenge. They offer the Kamula the opportunity to destructively transform and thereby redefine the constraints and inequalities that are intrinsic to industrial logging. The narratives of work related violence and guns both prefigure and complement broader national processes. Recently, the president of the Forest Owners Association stated that if the national govern- ment failed to give landowners representation on the National Forest Board then landown- ers would take the law into their own hands and stop all logging in Papua New Guinea. According to the president the landowners 'would start burning down company equipment and property on logging sites in the country' (The Post-Courier, 12 February, 1997). The stories of guns also redefine Kamula men's agency as potentially capable of defending the Kamula against a vaster set of uncertainties presented by modernity - evi- dent in concerns about the year 2000 and the increasing militarisation of daily life. The accounts of the guns point to an increasing blurring of the distinction between the 'legiti- mate' army, insurgents like the Bougainville Revolutionary Army and OPM, rascals and ordinary village people now apparently organised on a paramilitary basis (see Kulick 1993:12; A. Strathern 1993). The submarine stories also deny the relevance of national boundaries to contemporary flows of power in the context of globalisation. These implications have now become mat- ters of national concern. Early in 1997 The National and The Post-Courier reported the South Fly member of Parliament Mr. Zeipi stating that a submarine was sighted in the Fly River in Western Province.12 Mr. Zeipi said that: 243</page><page sequence="17">Logging, Women and Submarines The situation is very serious if the reports are true. This submarine may be trans- porting high-powered firearms to certain locations along the Fly River (The National 12 February, 1997). He mentioned that the submarine had 'agents' among the Gogodala and Lake Murray people and that it was possible that the submarine had a relationship with a gang that was 'according to intelligence... linked to the West Irian freedom fighters' (The Post-Courier 12 February, 1997). Mr Zeipi called upon the Defence Minister, the National Intelligence Organisation and the police to investigate, but no doubt these investigations have been over- shadowed by Sandline's challenge to the Papua New Guinea army's monopoly of violence and the army's own blurring of previously understood distinctions between government, military and civic society. CONCLUSION In this paper I have sought to link certain strands of the 'new Melanesian anthropology' (Foster 1995:5) - with its emphasis on the role of metaphor and image in the productive elicitation of things and persons and their mutual transformations in gift giving - to issues of Papua New Guinea's changing political economy, especially as manifested in industrial logging. I have argued that for the Kamula the productive elicitation of both familiar and modern things involves access to the transformative capacities of bush spirits. The bush spirits transform elements of capitalism and modernity by reproducing them in their domain. These bush spirits are then able to productively transfer, often by gift giving, key elements of this foreign or otherwise inaccessible modernity, to the Kamula. The narratives about these transfers imply a specific notion of transformative power that is part of the Kamula's understanding of the properties of things and events. As Ortner has recently noted, any account of power simultaneously involves 'the cul- tural construction of forms of agency and effectiveness in dealing with powerful others' (1997:146). If a person's ability to self-reflexively formulate their capacity to act derives not only from their present and past, but also from their expectations for the future (Ricoeur 1986:311) then the narratives outline potential capacities for the Kamula to deal with modernity. The usually hidden, but novel, aspects of the world evident in the narratives, define - if only fleetingly and ambiguously - possibilities that may be further realised in the manifest world. In this way the narratives also create a space for an identity that is open to radical surprise, to fundamentally new encounters (Ricoeur 1986:3 11) and to the possibil- ity of the radical transformation of the world. In the narratives modernity emerges as a site that simultaneously threatens and realises certain notions of male self-worth and dignity. While modernity threatens to reduce men to an inhuman, doglike level, it is also the vehicle for the realisation of men's desires (in the form of access to new kinds of women, overcoming threats of witchcraft) and increasing power (through access to guns). The narratives articulate new imaginative ways for realising the self (Lattas 1992:28) where that self can gain some purchase on the otherwise overpow- ering and destabilising forces of modernity. The narratives concerning relations with dali patalo women involve potentially effective negotiations of new forms of sexual practice that radically challenge other Kamula notions of masculine worth. The stories of guns given to Kamula provide an orientation to future actions that can radically redefine the Kamula's work situation while also dealing with the failure of the state to adequately protect them in the context of intensifying, perhaps apocalyptic, violence. Finally, while industrial logging is fundamentally beyond Kamula control, mapping it into the realm of the dali patalo creates the possibility that some control may be established in the future, especially given the dali patalo 's apparently effortless (see Geli 1992), replication of this form of production. The stories also link men's capacity for new forms of self definition, power and desire 244</page><page sequence="18">Wood to older notions of Kamula masculinity and self-worth (while at times subverting elements of these older definitions). It is Kamula men, rather than Kamula women, who continue to be defined as the primary mediators of the increased productivity and power located in the peripheral world of the dali patalo and other remote, asocial or anti-social agents. While both men's and women's moral worth and dignity are often challenged by the events narrat- ed, it is primarily men's power that is enhanced in these stories. But as Kamula men identify modernity as containing new and desirable sources of power they, at times, reinforce modernity's dominance over their potential self definition. The projects of self-definition suggested in the stories do not stand in opposition, or essen- tial antagonism, to the modern powers that have entered the Kamula domain. The stories are not simply counter-hegemonic to a hegemonic modernity because, as Mageo has argued, 'hegemonies do not exist in any rigid opposition to counter-hegemonic discourses' (1996:53). The dali patalo, their ugu like analogues and the Kamula, are all fully engaged with the power of the state and capital to produce new forms of wealth, desire and violence. So elements of modernity have already mingled with, and changed, the Kamula's cultural logic of transformative power and male productivity. Indeed now many of the narratives (and the magical technologies they contain) are not uniquely Kamula, but an amalgam of regional, national and Kamula understandings of the events described. There is no simple sense of a homogeneous Kamula cultural logic being reproduced in these narratives. These stories could be interpreted as demonstrating that, as the radically new kinds of subordination and dependency associated with capitalist production are 'naturalised' and domesticated by appearing to involve the same kind of social relationships good hunters used to have with the dali patalo, then the stories disempower all Kamula. The stories merely mask the radical shift in political economy by presenting it as a replication of Kamula men's past capacity to access transformational power. The 'internalisation' of modernity into the realm of the bush spirits further reinforces modernity's centrality in con- temporary life in such a way that men come to think that they, through relationships with the bush spirits, still have a capacity to effectively access a form of transformative power. In this kind of analysis the Kamula would be understood to be suffering from an exaggerated or mystified sense of their own agency since all that really occurs in the stories is a recon- ceptualisation, not a transformation, of colonising elements of capitalist modernity. The sto- ries are merely a Kamula 'ideology' in that the transformative power of the bush spirits is not really the origin or source of Kamula agency; their agency is not derived from peripher- al spaces, but is rather the product of their actions (including their acts of narration). Power in this view is only generated by, and an effect of, human action (Feldman 1991:3). But this account necessarily ignores the Kamula's sense that the revelation of things often involves forms of agency and power that do not just derive from humans (see Latour 1993; Wood 1995). Some versions of the ideology thesis take a view of image or represen- tation as always less real than the real. This is a view that fails to adequately describe the sense of reality the Kamula attribute to images, visions and dreams. It too abruptly dis- counts the Kamula's own theory of power that allows for the possibility of transformational flows between the often hidden image (nesama) and the manifest entity, where both are understood as different, but integral and real, aspects of the one thing. Here I am reminded of Nodiya's claim, while discussing stories about the role of bush spirits in logging, that 'sometimes these things come true'. While Nodiya was speaking English, in Kamula the word for 'true' (ikadabe) is also the word for 'real'. Following Nodiya's advice, but perhaps insufficiently highlighting the sense of equivocation he conveyed, I have emphasised in this essay the potential power of metaphor (see Black 1993), narrative and dream to create and change the world. As Nodiya implies these narratives and images cannot always simply be opposed to 'real' events or actions. For the Kamula, the central 'problem' of modern things is the problem of how to effec- tively elicit them. An aspect of this problem is how to make modern things commensurate 245</page><page sequence="19">Logging, Women and Submarines to the Kamula's own sense of the reality of things and to the associated forms of effective male agency, productivity and self-worth. The Kamula seek to do this without closing off the potential transformative properties (see Kramer 1993; Fardon 1995:20 fn 10) of these modern things or without undermining the expectation, especially manifest in the accounts of the submarines, that there are further 'aspects of an indeterminately vast "other" yet to be discovered" (Merlán and Rumsey 1991:231). From the material considered above, the Kamula's 'answer "to this problem is that they make modern things similar by reproducing them or copying them into their pre-existing modes of conceptualising productivity via forms of transformative mimesis associated with bush spirits. But in the process they have changed their own understanding of that productivity and its mimetic technologies. As they do this they radically transform their own understanding of the world and their power in it. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Versions of this paper were presented at a small gathering of Melanesianists in Cairns 1996 and at a meeting of the European Society for Oceanists in Copenhagen in December, 1996. In writing this paper I was helped by a generous group of people - notably Pat Townsend, Jimmy Weiner, Jen Badstuebner, Mark Busse, Alison Dundon, Bilai Laba, Andrew Lattas, Rosemary Hill, Stuart Kirsch, Bruce Knauft and two anonymous reviewers. I also want to thank the management of the Wawoi-Guavi concession for their co-operation. Mr. Apok and Mr. Lee of Pacific Woods Contractors allowed me free access to all aspects of their operations and were generous with their hospitality. The workers and their families at PWC looked after me in often quite dangerous conditions. Obviously this piece could not have been written without the help of Akabu Emesiye, Nodiya Imali, Miya Koiale and Nathan Dekopuwe. NOTES 1 . There is a vast literature on 'bush spirits' (masalai) in Papua New Guinea. Some of it is summarised in refer- ence to ideas of conservation by Bulmer (1982:68-70) and Wagner (1977). Recent discussions of masalai can be found in Sillitoe (1996) and Robbins (1995) - on Pacific spirits see Mageo and Howard (1996). Burridge's (1969) account of the Tangu concept of imbatekas prefigures many of the issues I raise here - a point I owe to Bruce Knauft. It is also worth noting here that Kamula ideas about masalai have been influ- enced not just by regional discourses circulating within Papua New Guinea, but also by the ideas and prac- tices of the largely Malaysian staff working in the Wawoi-Guavi concession. This is something I hope to pur- sue in more detail later. 2. The modernity referred to here is not entirely co-extensive with Westernisation. What perhaps is also happen- ing in the Wawoi-Guavi logging concession, and perhaps in other logging concessions in Papua New Guinea, is the emergence of a Malaysian or Malaysian-Chinese 'modernity' (see Ong 1996). I have yet to adequately look at this process. 3. In much the same way as Maclntyre (1995) has criticised M. Strathern's (1988) portrayal of Melanesian sociality, I think Weiner 's account of the Foi places them in a relationally based world (M.Strathern 1996:529) of innate sociality without much conflict or need to create sociality. This is also a world whose 'internal' rela- tional logic is sometimes theorised in dualistic opposition to the transformative possibilities of state sponsored capitalism and Western individualism (e.g. see Weiner 1995b: 165; M. Strathern 1988) whereas I prefer to emphasise heterogeneous entanglements rather than dualistic oppositions. 4. And Jimmy Weiner (pers. com.) has pointed out that my emphasis on the Kamula's engagement with mimetic transformative doubling in contrast to his account of the Foi as more concerned with elicitation via poiesis may reflect crucial ethnographic differences between the two groups. On this reading the Foi are simply less interested in creating and intervening in diffracting mirror worlds than are the Kamula and other groups around Mt. Bosavi. Hence my emphasis on the gap between manifest presence and its component unseen dou- ble (nesama) is less relevant to an analysis of the Foi. 5. Nodiya was using English here. He back translated 'imitate' to the Kamula verb atatoma which also means 'to enact', 'rehearse', 'copy' and 'try'. 6. Other transformations that relate to this point involve the nesama of humans and the 'evil spirit' of witches changing into game, but I do not elaborate on these here. 246</page><page sequence="20">Wood 7. This section was influenced by a reading of some of the literature that explores the relationship between gen- der and mining - such as Robinson's (1996) useful overview and Gerritsen and Maclntyre (1991). A late reading of Spyer's (1997) work was also relevant to this section and to the paper generally. 8. Stories of the arrival of boats and submarines bringing guns to Papua New Guinea have a longer history and wider spatial distribution than the kind of submarine stories I retell here (e.g. see Williams, 1976:342; Lattas in press). Alison Dundon has recorded stories about submarines being sighted by Gogodala in the Aramia and I was told by a Gogodala teacher working at Wawoi Falls that these submarines give out guns to Gogodala who 'know' life in Moresby or who have become rascals. Bilai Laba has heard stories concerning the 'first' sight- ings of the submarine in Lake Murray (see fn. 13). Mark Busse told me that the Boazi speakers (of Lake Murray) do have stories about canoes that travel underwater carrying a particular type of non-human being. Finally, Stuart Kirsch pointed to a South American connection by directing me to submarine stories discussed by Chernela ( 1 988) and Turner ( 1 988:264-265). 9. The reference to 'seeing' here is a reference to ordinary vision. I have no record of the term milam'natili being used to refer to the experience of seeing submarine people. The Kamula I spoke to deny that seeing sub- marines involves milam'natili because it occurs 'in the open' or 'outside' (haliomali dia) rather than in a dream or via the otherwise non-visible world. Despite this I think the process of seeing submarines and gain- ing guns is similar to events that get categorised as milam 'natili. 1 0. The arresting officer on the case told me that no gun was used by the victim to threaten the workers. The arrested suspect later escaped from Daru before he went to court and a warrant for his arrest is still in place. 11. The reference here to the year 2000 points to a complementarity between rascalism and millenarianism sug- gested by Kulick (1993:13 fn 3). 12. In Bilai Laba's version of a Suki story about the appearance of the first submarine at Lake Murray a man pad- dling by himself in his canoe was lifted up out of the water by the submarine. The man was given a large gun (or cannon). He was told on what ridge to place it and the westerly direction it should face (because that is where the 'monsters' come from). Later the submarine people came back to Lake Murray disguised as tourists. They called out for the man they had given the gun to. He took them onto the lake where they revealed themselves by taking off their hats and introducing themselves by their correct names. They inspected the gun and gave instructions on its maintenance and use. Later Mr. Zeipi's cousin saw a submarine in the Fly River and since then there have been many dealings with the submarines. This story was told to Bilai Laba by Kusuba Tangura of Gaima Corner, Daru. Bilai Laba told Kusuba's story to me in English in the Cairns International Hotel in May 1997. REFERENCES BECK, U. 1992.
