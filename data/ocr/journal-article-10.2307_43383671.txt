<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Forgotten Icon: The Sword ZÜLFIKÄR IN ITS OTTOMAN INCARNATION1 Jane Hathaway Ohio State university Visitors to the Turkish Naval Museum in Istanbul's busy quarter of Be§ikta§ immediately confront the large green battle flag of the celebrated admiral Barbaros Hayrettin Pa§a (1466-1546), whose tomb lies only a few tens of meters from the museum. Prominently displayed on the banner is a stylized version of the early Islamic caliph 'Alfs double-bladed sword Zülfikär. In this depiction, typical of Ottoman iconography, the sworďs two blades are wide- ly splayed (figure l). Zülfikär is a Muslim icon whose image was commonly employed by the Ottomans for centuries. Nonetheless, the museum seems not to recognize this reality. For the banner's caption identifies Zülfikär as a symbol of the Christian Trinity (iiçlii testis ), and continues: 16. yüzyilda Osmanli donanmasi ûç dinin de hüküm sürdügü ticarî cografyaya egemen olmuçtur. Bu nedenle, Hiristiyanligin simgesi de sancaģa i§lenmi§tir...2 [in the sixteenth century, the Ottoman navy achieved hegemony over the com- mercial geography where [all] three religions [i.e., Islam, Christianity, and Juda- ism] prevailed. For this reason, a symbol of Christianity is embroidered on the flag...] Between the sworďs widely-splayed blades is a six-pointed star: Solomon's Seal or the Star of David, likewise a common Islamic symbol. Yet the mu- seum has reinterpreted it as a Jewish symbol that, like the " iiçlii testis ," sup- posedly represents Ottoman tolerance and ecumenism. This astonishing caption would seem to reflect the alienation of the Turk- ish Republic, or at least of one Republican museum, from the symbolic uni- verse of the very empire to whose relics it is heir. Yet a closer examination of the iconography of the Zülfikär sword during the Ottoman era reveals that the Ottomans themselves indulged in a reinterpretation of the sword's historical, or at least scriptural, reality, creating in the end a distinctively Ottoman icon whose visual multivalence arguably imbued it with spiritual significance to viewers from a variety of cultural traditions. *A Turkish version of this article appeared in Cogito 19 (Summer 1999).

The Sword Zülfikär in Islamic Tradition The sword Zülfikär is as old as Islam itself- or, according to Shťite belief, as old as humanity. Shťite tradition holds that Adam carried the sword out of the Garden of Eden with him, along with the Ark of the Covenant, Moses1 staff, and his own coffin.3 According to Sunni tradition, the sword originally belonged to al-ťAs b. Munabbih b. al-Hajjāj, a wealthy leader of the pagan community in Mecca and an implacable enemy of the early Muslims. Al- though the sword's maker was said to have been the Arabian smith Marzüq, it has also been asserted that the sword was of Indian workmanship; In- dian swordsmiths were well known for the quality of their steel swords.4 A substantial mythology grew up surrounding accounts that the weapon was double-bladed; as we shall see, the two blades would loom large in later Mus- lim iconography. Some modern scholars have posited that the sword was 3John Renard, Islam and the Heroic Image: Themes in Literature and the Visual Arts (Co- lumbia: University of South Carolina Press, 1993), 96. 4A.

In this sense, the sword had two blades, al- though the blades would have met in a single point.5 The biographical (sfra) literature of the Prophet, however, maintains that the sword took its name from small hollows or grooves (s. fuqra) in the blade, "for more easy cleaving of coats of mail."6 It was with such a sword, perhaps, that al-' As b. Munabbih fought at the battle of Badr in 624 CE. Pursuing his strategy of raiding the trade caravans on which pagan Mecca's wealth depended, the Prophet Muhammad and his Muslim followers, from their base in Medina, attacked a Syrian caravan re- turning from Mecca. A relieving force of Meccans engaged the Muslims at the wells of Badr north of Mecca, but was soundly defeated. Al-' As was slain in battle, and the Prophet took his sword, Ziilfikâr, as part of the victori- ous Muslims' booty.7 Early Muslim sources are not clear as to whether the Prophet fought with Ziilfikâr in subsequent battles. The Prophet owned and used a number of swords, all with different names, as did his companions.8 (It is worth noting in this regard that Ziilfikâr is not included in the col- lection of swords belonging to the Prophet and his companions housed in the Holy Relics room at the Topkapi Palace Museum.) According to Islamic tradition, however, the Prophet bequeathed the sword, along with his ring and the rest of his weapons, to his cousin and son-in-law, 'All ibn AbTTālib, at the battle of Uhud, where the Meccans defeated the Muslims in 625 CE.9 'All subsequently became the fourth caliph, or leader, of the Muslim community following the Prophet's death. It is as 'Airs sword that Ziilfikâr is chiefly re- membered; indeed, the extensive mythology surrounding the sword centers on cAlFs possession of it. 5Zygulski, Ottoman Art in the Service of the Empire , 46, 48. 6Abū Jafar Muhammad b.

The proverbial expression "'All is the best of young men, and Ziilfikâr is the best of swords" ( Lãfatã illã ť Ali ; wa-la say fa illã Dhü'l-Faqäri) is well known.10 In later Muslim, above all Shťite or Shťite-influenced, lore, Ziilfikâr acquired magical properties. It was said to be the longest sword in the world. The sword's two blades, by then construed as two separate points, were said to serve the purpose of putting out the eyes of enemies of Islam.11 This belief may in turn have drawn on the legend, transmitted in the Iranian epic Shãhnãma , of the hero Rustam slaying Isfandiyar by shooting a double- tipped arrow into his eyes, his only vulnerable spot.12 On 'All's death, Ziilfikâr passed into the hands of his sons Hasan and Hu- sayn. The fate of Ziilfikâr following the martyrdom of Husayn in 680 CE is shrouded in mystery, made all the more opaque by the allegiances of the various communities who have laid claim to the sword. In the early centu- ries of Islam, Ziilfikâr came to be regarded as a symbol of ťAlId legitimacy; those who professed to possess the sword by the same token professed to represent the family of the Prophet ( ahi al-bayt ), whom various proto-Shťite groups regarded as the only legitimate claimant to leadership of the Mus- lim community. Indeed, Twelver Shťite tradition maintains that the sword remained within the 'Alīd line until the disappearance of the Twelfth Imam in 873 CE.13 The Abbasid caliphs, who initially posed as the defenders of the ahi al-bayť s right to the caliphate, are the first dynasty said to have had the sword Ziilfikâr in their possession. Supposedly, the renowned Abbasid caliph Hārūn al-Rashld (786-809 CE) allowed his Persian general YazTd to use the sword in battle.14 The last Abbasid caliph said to have possessed the sword 10EI2, s.v.

According to some traditions, the Fatimids, proponents of an Ismaili counter-caliphate, stole (or liberated, depending on one's point of view) the sword from the Abbasid palace during the tu- multuous days following al-Muqtadir's murder by his general Mu'nis, and carried it off to what was then their capital at al-Mahdiyya in Tunisia.15 After the fifteenth century, the whereabouts of the sword Zíilfikâr no longer occupy a prominent place in various sectarian traditions. The im- age of the sword, however, remained vital to the self-presentation of the chief contenders for religious legitimacy and military supremacy in the re- configured Muslim world of the pre-modern era. Some of the earliest pic- torial representations of the sword can be found in manuscripts produced under the Mongol Ilkhanid regime, which ruled from Tabriz in what is now northwestern Iran during the late twelfth and the thirteenth centuries. An illuminated manuscript of the polymath al-Bīrūnfs (973-1048 CE) Chronicle of Ancient Peoples, produced in Tabriz in 1307-1308 CE, includes represen- tations of the sword as a saber with a forked blade.16 Since this depiction arguably displays no original Mongol influences,17 we may speculate that this image of Zíilfikâr derives from regional pre-Mongol pictorial traditions. Given the early Ilkhanids' flirtation with Buddhism, Shťism, and Sufism, as well as strong 'AlTd and mystical tendencies in the Tabriz vicinity during the Middle Ages,18 these traditions may reflect those influences, as well. Among both the Ottomans and the Safavids, who seized control of most of Iran early in the sixteenth century, the image of Zíilfikâr was closely tied to veneration of 'All. Although the Safavids espoused a militant brand of mystical Shťism, characterized by fervent devotion to 'All and his descen- dants, Zíilfikâr does not appear to have had the iconographie significance in Safavid art and heraldry that it did among the Ottomans. In the period im- mediately preceding the Safavid conquest of Iran, however, when Iran was divided into various Timurid, and later Turcoman, principalities, there are faint indications of the sword's symbolic importance.

'All carries Ziilfikâr, which appears as a scimitar with two separate, curving blades. The blades appear almost to overlap, so that the sword re- sembles nothing so much as a pair of shears.19 Beneath the hooves of 'Alfs horse lies the corpse of one of the enemies of Islam whom 'All has vanquished; his garment is pierced with two pairs of puncture wounds- presumably the work of Ziilfikâr.20 This Khawãrnãma manuscript was produced in the south- ern Iranian city of Shiraz, then under the rule of the Karakoyunlu Turcoman dynasty, who conquered the province from the Timurid prince Ibrahim b. Shahrukh. Remarkably, the artist has painted the faces of both 'All and the Prophet; in most traditions, rendering the features of any of the Abrahamic prophets or of Muhammad's family is strictly taboo. Here, however, both men resemble fifteenth-century Persian gentlemen, painted in the rather stubby, truncated style favored by the Shiraz school throughout most of the fifteenth century.21 Following the same tradition, an illuminated sixteenth- century Ottoman manuscript of the poet Lámťí Çelebi's Maqtvl-i Āl-i Resül depicts 'All wielding a virtually identical version of Ziilfikâr in battle; here, the sword skewers an enemy horse. In this Turco-Persian pro-Shťite tradi- tion, as in the Shirazi Shťite tradition, 'Alfs face is fully visible.22 The Ottoman Zülfikär Tradition Under the Ottomans, Ziilfikâr came to be associated in particular with the Janissary corps, the elite corps of Ottoman infantry, which originated in the fourteenth century.23 The Janissaries' attachment to Ziilfikâr is part and par- cel of their devotion to 'All and, by extension, of their association with the Bekta§i sufi order, an order noted for its pronounced 'Alīd tendencies. Janis- sary lore relates that Haci Bekta§ Veli, the Anatolian mystic who inspired the order, counseled the second Ottoman sultan, Orhan (1326-1362), on the proper dress for his new corps of soldiery, recommending that their head- dresses be white to distinguish them from the red headgear of the provincial cavalry.24 According to Bekta§i legend, Haci Bekta§'s white felt robe inspired 19Basil Gray, Persian Painting , 2nd ed.

In some versions of the legend, Haci Bekta§'s sleeve (yen ) fell over the soldiers' heads when he blessed them; in others, he cut lengths of felt from the hem of his robe to serve as makeshift headdresses.25 Aside from their Bektaçi affiliation, the Janissaries1 devotion to 'All was most clearly manifested in the corps' deployment of representations of the sword Ziilfikâr. Ziilfikâr figures prominently in the insignia, or renk, of sever- al companies (s. orta ) of the imperial Janissaries, quartered in Istanbul.26 The famous Codex Vindobonensis , a sixteenth-century compilation of Viennese paintings of Ottoman officials, depicts Janissaries marching in processions carrying outsized wooden replicas of Ziilfikâr.27 Janissary and Bektaçi tomb- stones also bore carved images of the sword and related Shťite-influenced imagery. Some of the most anthropomorphic examples of Ziilfikâr occur on Janissary tombstones.28 The most famous and widespread of these representations, however, was the image of Ziilfikâr emblazoned on the Janissaries' battle flags. According to legend, Orhan had emblazoned the image of Ziilfikâr on the banner he gave to the Janissaries on their creation, so as to place the new corps under the protection oPAlî.29 In later Ottoman history, these flags were carried not only by the Janissaries but by the sultan himself. Inasmuch as the Janissar- ies were the sultan's personal corps of soldiery, composed of his servants (s. kal), who surrounded his person on the battlefield, the Ziilfikâr banner was not simply a Janissary banner but a sultanic banner. It was inextricably linked to the sultan's power and legitimacy. The Ottoman Ziilfikâr banner took the shape of a pointed rectangle, a tri- angle, or a forked pennant (figure 2). Its ground was either red, the Ottoman dynastic color (a/), or white (aíc), the color of the Janissaries' headgear. The sword was depicted on the banner in highly stylized fashion, with two sepa- rates, however, that Haci Bekta§ died in the thirteenth century (p. 456).

Often, the sword image was com- posed of lines of calligraphy, con- taining the proverb "There is no greater young man than 'All, and no greater sword than Ziilfikâr." Zdzislaw Zygulski has pointed out the anthropomorphism of the sword as portrayed on Ot- toman Ziilfikâr flags: the blades resemble legs, the quillons arms, the pommel a head. Zygulski speculates that this anthropo- morphism may stem from a form of Turkish "nostalgia," and given the anthropomorphic Ziilfikâr's frequent association with hand motifs (interpreted in an Islamic context as the hand of Fātima, or sometimes that of 'All or Husayn), we may speculate that it is influ- enced in part by Central Asian shamanistic traditions.30 According to the late Mam- luk chronicler Ibn Iyās, who wit- Figure 2.

Indeed, the Topkapi Palace Museum's collection contains a red Ziilfikâr banner that Selim carried to Egypt (figure 2). Just how widespread the use of the Ziilfikâr banner was among Ottoman armies during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries can be surmised from the widely dispersed specimens, most of them captured by the Ottomans' ad- versaries, still to be found in various European museums. The visitor to the former Doge's palace in Venice may be surprised to see, on looking up while 30Zygulski, Ottoman Art in the Service of the Empire, 50-51, 53.

This transformation gave the sword a widespread popular appeal that it arguably could not previously have had. A banner, after all, could be seen and embraced by a far greater number of people, military and otherwise, than an actual sword. It could also be reproduced, so that armies in various locales and various divisions of a single army could carry their own banners. These sorts of considerations gained importance as Muslim armies grew more numerous and defended increasingly large and diffuse territories. By the sixteenth century, Ottoman armies were routinely engaged on two fronts: the western front against the Hapsburg empire, and the eastern front against Safavid Iran. These were, in addition, enormous armies totaling pos- sibly hundreds of thousands, composed of imperial forces stationed in the capital combined with levies from the provinces.33 A typical levy from Egypt alone by the early eighteenth century consisted of 3,000 soldiers.34 By con- trast, the Muslim army at Badr numbered roughly 300, the defeated Meccan force 1,000;35 even the Muslim army that took Yarmuk in what is now Jordan from the Byzantines in 636 CE numbered only 46,000.36 In these changed circumstances, the transformation of Zülfikär from a single material object to a mass-produced symbol presented unsuspected opportunities. The cult of the sword, if we may call it that, was far more easily spread by means of images displayed on banners and wooden replicas than it could ever have been by the sword itself. It was arguably by means of its dissemination through these banners and wooden replicas, with their accompanying mythology, that Zülfikär acquired its iconographie status. In this respect, the sword's dissemination and popularization resemble those of notable Christian icons, such as the Virgin of Guadalupe (figure 3), whose image on flags, signboards, votive candles (and, more recently, T-shirts) has "Personal visit to the museum of the Doge's palace, Venice, June 1995.

Historians and anthropolo- gists have asserted that the wide- spread popularity of the Virgin of Guadalupe in Mexico drew (and draws) on pre-Columbian beliefs in fertility goddesses.38 In like fashion, among the Ottoman Janissaries, the lore of Ziilfíkâr resonated with the sword legends that abounded in other cultures with which Janissary recruits had come in contact.

Meanwhile, soldiers from eastern Anatolia, the Caucasus, and the Kurdish regions may have been familiar with what Mehrdad Izady calls "the ancient Iranic rite of worshipping the deity represented as a sword stuck into the ground," practiced currently among Kurdish Alevis in eastern Anatolia.41 Michele Membré, a Venetian envoy en route to the court of the Safavid Shah Tahmasp in 1539, noticed outside a church in Georgia "a wooden mast with three or four of their daggers ... and two swords all stuck into the said wood."42 Similar tales of magical swords and spears from other bodies of Eu- ropean, Iranian, and Arab mythology may well have filtered into Zíilfikâr lore: the legends of Alexander the Great from the Iranian epic Shãhnãma; the tales of the Byzantine border soldiers known as akritoi , epitomized by the epic of Digenes Akrites; and the fanciful lore of the first Mamluk sultan, known as Sīrat al-Zãhir Baybars.43 Indeed, the compatibility of the Zíilfikâr legend with these various traditions must partially explain the readiness of Janissaries from such disparate backgrounds to revere the sword and the man who wielded it.

Zülfikär as displayed on a fluttering forked naval banner could arguably be mistaken for the crosses flutter- ing from the masts of Crusader and, later, Holy Roman Empire vessels. Corresponding three-pronged flags displaying crosses were not uncom- mon within Christian contexts, for that matter. An icon of St. Sergius in the Monastery of St. Catherine in the Sinai carries a cross banner divided into three at the bottom (figure 4); not coincidentally, St. Sergius was regarded as the patron saint of the Middle Eastern nomads. A similarly divided flag appears in a relief carv- ing of St. George on a church wall in Figure 4. Icon of St. Sergius, Monastery of St. Catherine. From David Nicolle, Arms and Armour of the Crusading Era, 1050-1350: Western Europe and the Crusade States (London: Green- hill Books, c. 1999), 508, figure 758. Fordington, England.44 The strong resemblance to a Christian cross may not have been coinci- dental, given the eastern European and Anatolian Christian origin of many of the Janissaries, particularly before the devņirme fell into disuse. In this regard, it is telling that the widely-splayed version of the Zülfikär image, as opposed to the "pair of shears" version familiar from Mongol and Timu- rid times, developed solely under the Ottomans. Even Ottoman Ziilfikârs without widely splayed blades typically retained the flavor of a cross since the quillons were typically placed in such a way as to serve as the cross's ft arms. Our examination of the iconographie tradition surrounding the sword Zülfikär in the Ottoman Empire would lead us to believe that the Ottoman image of the sword functioned as a sort of iconographie Rorschach test: that is, the image resonated with whatever religious or ideological tradition from which the viewer happened to come. As a result, the sword image and the lore that it evoked could accommodate recruits to Ottoman military and ad- ministrative culture from an array of cultural and religious backgrounds. In this sense, the sword was emblematic of the accommodation and ecumen- "Nicolle, Arms and Armour of the Crusading Era, figures 843 and 891c; vol. 1, pp. 333, 350; vol. 2, pp. 810, 818. 12</page><page sequence="13">THE FORGOTTEN SWORD / HATHAWAY ism that were built into the Ottoman administrative system, even if they served practical, rather than ideological, motives. This brings us back to the entrance foyer of the Naval Museum and the misidentified Zûlfikâr emblazoned on Barbaros Hayrettin Pa§a's flag. The supreme irony of the Naval Museum, however, is that its walls are lined with nineteenth- and early twentieth-century paintings that clearly demonstrate that by that time, Ziilfikâr had become a canonical image of Ottoman armed might. Several late Ottoman and even early Republican oil paintings show the Ottoman navy and army flying flags displaying a modestly two-bladed Ziilfikâr, less anthropomorphic than the specimen on Barbaros Hayrettin's flag.45 Whether or not these paintings reflect historical reality, they demon- strate that for late Ottomans, a standardized and somewhat sanitized two- pronged Ziilfikâr had become a marker of Ottoman military hegemony. This Ziilfikâr clearly reflects a late Ottoman reimagining of the "classical" Otto- man past that endows the sword image with a symbolic significance that it may or may not have had when actually in use. Still, the iconographie meaning of the sword within an earlier Ottoman context survives in these paintings. Within only a few decades, however, this entire construction of symbolic meaning had been lost to the organizers of the Naval Museum. Thus, although the museum has retained the physical evidence of this ico- nography, it has lost its meaning. We might say that the Naval Museum's curators have failed the iconographie Rorschach test, or at least that the entire premise of the test has changed. Instead of remaining a Muslim icon that accommodates the viewer's particular cultural context, the sword im- age has been recast as a hegemonic Christian symbol, and Ottoman history has been reshaped to accommodate that symbol. I leave it to the reader to speculate on what lessons this curious (and decidedly postmodern) circum- stance holds for historians, preservationists, and the divers heirs to the Ot- toman patrimony. 45Examples include D.B. 1508 by Hiisnii Tengüz; D.B. 1748, Abdiilhamid [is?] Review of the Ships at Sarayburnu , by Ibrahim Çalli; and D.B. 1936, Fatih Sultan Mehmet Marching from Edirne to Istanbul , by Hasan Riza. 13</page></plain_text>
