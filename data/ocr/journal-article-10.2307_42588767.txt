Your attention is invited to a class of cases which exemplify the practice of attributing effectiveness to non-human agents. A critical analysis of some of these cases provides grounds for questioning the desirability of legitimizing this practice» There is a group of scholars and educators whose guiding metaphor is the machine. They direct their efforts toward restricting the office or position of teacher to that of a functionary or impersonal channel between scholars and students because they believe that all teachers constitute a potential source of intellectual pollution. As a result, they chose to delegate to teachers mostly house-keeping responsibilities such as carrying out routines, invoking and enforcing rules, filling out forms, running movie machines and slide projectors, assigning and checking work in textbooks and workbooks, giving and grading tests, and the like0 The rest of the driving they reserve for themselves. Advocates of this approach to teaching, one might call them "Ef- fectivists, " seem to act on the belief that much of the pain, grief, and conflict in the world stems from the fact that a significant amount of validated knowledge is contaminated by error of the human agents involved in the process of transmitting it from the scholars to the students. Some Effectivists try to reduce this contamination by inventing and pushing what they conceive to be teacher-proóf cur- riculums, programs, methods, techniques and textbooks. The more daring and enterprising Effectivists are engaged in attempts to de- vise and substitute objective, error-free and ultra-rational, non- human agents for human and, therefore, potentially subjective teach- ers who seem to be disinclined toward or incapable of achieving a desirable degree of skill, objectivity, accuracy and rationality. Until recently, most Effectivists restricted their propositions to the kinds of things which were useful in efforts to accomplish teach- ing and learning tasks. As such, they were perceived with a benign tolerance. But with the seeming proliferation of error, pain and conflict in the educational world, several new classes of experts and entrepreneurs have also adopted the outlook and methods of the Ef- fectivists. Prominent among these are some experts in Administra- tion, Counseling and Curriculum Development who identify them- selves with the Humanism of the Seventies. Having appointed themselves prime movers and having their pack- age of innovations marked "Handle With Care" receive routine hand- ling, some have decided that the office or position of teacher can</page><page sequence="3">JOURNAL OF THOUGHT 133 and must be assumed by non-human movers or agents in the form of effective programs, effective methods, effective questions, effec- tive policies, effective reports, effective report forms, effective sequences, "ad infinitum." Occasionally, they go beyond the modest claims of the founders of Ef f ectivism by saying that their creations are more than useful because they are as effective and, in some cases, more effective than human teachers. Comprehending the transition of "some things" like books, pro- grams, methods, techniques, from the state of useful, inert, dumb objects to "someones" that can be labeled "effective teacher" poses a problem. One way of rationally accounting for this remarkable process of transformation is set forth below. The process can be highlighted at several points. Most occur where an internal, abstract, "something" becomes external, concrete and real, or, viceversa, an external, real, live "someone " becomes an internal, abstract "something. " Illustrative of the first case, one finds expressions of doubt about the degree of effectiveness of schools and teachers. "Effectiveness" is rarely, if ever, defined. This state of affairs is reflected in the statement: "Hard questions about the effectiveness of our schools and teachers have neither been asked nor answered. " For critical purposes, "effectiveness" is defined here as "embodying that aspect or quality of achieving a desired effect or result. " Note that this definition includes the normative term "desired" and, when used in discussions about public education, entails a social or normative rather than an expert judgment. Next, a "constructed type" or concept is created in the conceptual realm of an Effectivist. This concept symbolically represents an objective, error-free, ultra -rational, but universal, fictitious en- tity which has been personified by the arbitrary label "the effective teacher." The definition of the term "effective teacher, " is rarely, if ever, stated. An example of personification by simile is "The machine can be programmed as an effective teacher far beyond the limits of its human counterpart " Personification by arbitrary at- tribution of human capacities is exemplified in the case of "This group was taught by programmed instruction." Assumption of a uni- versal agent is illustrated by the case "What are the specialized skills and attributes of 'the' effective teacher?" Third, the prime mover makes an extensional bargain with other interested persons to limit themselves to descriptive and analytical statements about the conceptional realm, "effective teacher." They</page><page sequence="4">134 JOURNAL OF THOUGHT say, for example, "The effective teacher seeks to be as objective as possible in assessing his/her effectiveness in a teaching situation. " Fourth, this bargain is knowingly or unknowingly broken and the fictitious person or "the effective teacher" of the conceptual realm is reified i.e0, smuggled into the physical world and made real by attaching the label "effective teacher" to a particular person. This step across the threshold which divides conceptual realm from the natural world is exemplified by the statement: "Mr. X, an effective teacher who had demonstrated his ability to solve many complex teaching problems, taught one group of students. " Fifth, Mr. X who embodies the fictitious person labeled "effec- tive teacher" is then delegated the responsibility of teaching a set of items of information to a group of students whose achievements are measured prior to and after exposure to the human agent's in- struction. In many, if not most cases, the Effectivist has dictated both the criterion measures and the protocol questions which are used to measure achievement. Sixth, the obtained measures are quantified, treated statistically and synthesized into statistical or scientific images of teacher and student achievement. With this procedure, the offices of both the human teaching agent and his students are arbitrarily separated from each person. Subsequently, the personal or subjective aspects of the human teaching agent and students are discarded under the as- sumption that personal differences factor out. This process of depersonalizing the human agent and his students results in the reduction of the semantic space between the connota- tions of "human" and/or "non-human" agent. Only the offices or objective, impersonal and functionary qualities, aspects and func- tions of the persons involved are highlighted. The remaining semantic space between the human and non-human is further reduced by personifying anon-human entity like a program, method, technique or textbook by simile or by descriptive state- ments attributing to it qualities, functions, and aspects connoting humaness» Specific cases of attribution include, for example, "Pro- grams provide opportunities«,.., " "Method using delayed feedback..., " "Technique for building. . . , " "Programmed texts consistently pro- duced» . o , " and the like0 Thus, by attributing similar qualities, as- pects or functions to both human and non-human agents and by making the non-human agent the subject and the human agent the object, connotations of the attributes attached to both the human and the non-human agents acquire closer affinity in semantic space. This</page><page sequence="5">JOURNAL OF THOUGHT 135 affinity, in turn, seemingly legitimizes the final personification of a non-human entity by labeling it "teacher. " Thus, the office of teacher is (a) conceptualized, (b) universalized, (c) described, (d) analyzed, (e) personified, (f ) attached to a ficiti- tious person, and (g) reified by embodying it in a live teacher» It is then separated from the live teacher, attributed to a non-human agent and, through a series of personifications or arbitrary attach- ment of anthropomorphic labels, transformed into a "someone "which it seems legitimate to call an "effective teacher. " The difference between a non-human and a human teaching agent is a difference that makes quantitative and qualitative differences. In the first place, it may be more economical in many cases to purchase and maintain a non-human agent than to hire and maintain a human agent while the inanimate entity is merely consumed. More impor- tant for the Effectivist, however, much is gained by substituting a seemingly objective, supra-rational non-human agent that is imper- sonal as an elevator door for the person of the human agent with his subjective propensities and tendencies to contaminate the pool of validated knowledge. Finally, scientific management makes it man- datory. At the risk of killing off the persons of the human agent, i.e., students and teachers, by over-emphasis of the personal and subjec- tive, some explicit and implicit assumptions which appear to legiti- mize the attribution of the quality of effectiveness to non-human agents or agencies will be examined below. First, while one may attribute some ills of society to the subjec- tivity of teachers who seem to propagate error, the assumption that it is the case in a specific case has not been validated as demonstra- bly or even probably true. The proposition appears to be self-evident and vibrant in behavior-general terms, but it goes limp when stated in behavior- specific terms. Second, while many Effectivist s continue to consciously or uncon- sciously prescribe forms of prior, regulatory behavior by ascribing a functionary role for teachers, none has validated the value judg- ment implicit in the assertion that the role of teacher as a func- tionary is the most efficacious. Also, when such value judgments are made, few, if any, Effectivists go on to vindicate the standards invoked in their case for validating claims in which they attribute as much or more "effectiveness" to non-human agents. Third, it must be granted that in formal discourse a group of ad- vocates may mutually and tacitly consent to and cooperate in the</page><page sequence="6">136 JOURNAL OF THOUGHT construction and use of a constructed type or fictitious person and call this abstraction "the effective teacher. " Also, it is both ap- propriate and even desirable for them to make descriptive state- ments of abstract fact or relations and/or expressions of opinion about this "effective teacher" or fictitious person. Conventionally, however, one is not permitted to reify and treat as real this ficti- tious person or "effective teacher" and to make value judgments about it. Fourth, while the office of teacher may arbitrarily be separated from his person for purposes of. analysis, it seems counter-produc- tive to do it for purposes of practice. Fifth, the Effectivists' guiding metaphor of the machine is a sim- ple, sharp intellectual tool and, expertly and imaginatively used, has served to open up rich veins of thought. Like any other tool, how- ever, it is not, by definition, universally useful or appropriate. More to the point, it appears to be entirely inappropriate for use in gathering, classifying, rationally accounting for data and justifying and making value judgments in and about many aspects of public edu- cation in a democratic society in peacetime. Sixth, it is intellectually inelegant at the least and harmful at worst to personify and then to reify an abstract entity in empirically grounded research. This assertion holds also for the use of only de- scriptive facts to validate value judgments and to vindicate the standards of value invoked to validate such judgments. Seventh, the separation of the office or position of teacher from the person in practice seems neither desirable nor defensible accord- ing to best current thought which now takes into account affective learning. It seems equally fruitless to separate the office of stu- dent from his person for the same reason. It is as much as to say that only externally motivated cognitive learning is possible or de- sired and seemingly sanctions an autocratic approach. Eighth, is the consideration of accountability. Even the most dis- criminate use of "effective" implies a human prime mover. This human agent is the only sort that can be held accountable within the conventional meaning of the normative term "desired" in the defini- tion of "effective" or "effectiveness. " Beyond this, one can take and defend the position that despite in ter subjective reliability, extensional bargains and empirically ground data, the term "effective" is technically a shibboleth which means "I like it. " Finally, if one accepts the position of the Effectivists, one logi-</page><page sequence="7">JOURNAL OF THOUGHT 137 cally is left with a set of propositions which go something like this: Given a program of teacher education which is stamped "effective, " some teachers who undergo it successfully may, in turn, be labeled "effective ." Given that they are effective, it is probable that they will select and use only programs, methods, techniques and texts that are certified "effective." If it should happen that some effec- tive teachers who necessarily use only effective programs, methods, techniques, and texts to teach students who do not achieve at a satisfactory level, they logically must be labeled ineffective, defec- tive, or strictly speaking, futile 0 If it is the case, then the Effec- tivist logically must escalate to "effective" behavior modification techniques ... ad infinitum, driven by the prime mover that moves him.</page></plain_text>
