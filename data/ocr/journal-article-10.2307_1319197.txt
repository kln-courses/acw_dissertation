<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sex and Gender: An Introduction. 4th ed. Hilary M. Lips. Mountain View, CA: Mayfield. 2001. 553 pages. $45.95. This text is appropriate for first and second year undergraduate courses in sociology, women's studies, and other areas that stress thinking about our gendered society and the importance of change. For those looking for the consistency and flow of a textbook over a collection of articles by various authors, this is a very useful book. Lips has given us a good teaching tool and the text will be useful to those hoping to stimulate class dis- cussion. A book like this would work very well beside readers such as Kimmel's The Gendered Society or Ashton-Jones et al. The Gender Reader. The fourth edition contains 14 chapters divided into three parts. Part one begins with a fairly standard chapter on the myths and stereotypes surrounding masculinity and femininity and suc- cessfully illustrates, for an introductory audience, the social context and construction of stereotypes. The student reads a clear presentation of stereo- typing as varying from culture to culture, and as involving social sanction for those who transgress stereotypical boundaries. The terms "sex" and "gender" are clearly defined, differentiated, and supported by a discussion of their frequent mis- perception and misinterpretation. There is a nice discussion, as in every chapter of the book, of the ways that researchers have unpacked gender and its social construction. Further, issues of race, ability, sexual orientation, age, and class are problematized in relation to the subject matter and the research throughout the book. Chapter two surveys theoretical perspectives on sex and gender, including psychological, socio-biological functionalist, social learning, cognitive develop- ment, gender schema, and social interaction theo- ries. The surveys address the origins, develop- ment, and maintenance of behavioural differences and similarities between males and females. Fem- inist responses to these various constructions are also postulated. Chapter three delves into methodological issues and that is a particular strength of this text, as is exploring the "whys and hows" of research concerning gender. The text discusses various methods, such as case histories, narrative approaches, phenomenologi- cal methods, survey, observation, and experimen- tal research in relation to independent and depen- dent variables, research bias, question formula- tion, research design, and data analysis. Lips includes an important discussion of ethnocen- trism, anthropomorphism, and heterosexism. Part two is divided into six chapters that ex- plore various research strategies for studying sex and gender, the roles of biology and environment in shaping gender and sexual differentiation, per- ceptual and cognitive abilities in relation to gen- der similarities and differences, sexual orienta- tion, hormonal and reproductive considerations, as well as mental and physical health as they relate to sex and gender. These chapters clarify that most psychological research on gender is grounded in essentialist assumptions while under- scoring the importance of social constructionist approaches. Lips presents a wealth of information about the social construction of gendered inequal- ity in these chapters. If it is simply a matter of hormones and biology then why are women more likely to be poor, to be single parents, or to be diagnosed with depression? If one theme ties together all of these chapters, and indeed the entire book, it is the notion that stereotyped thinking must be confronted, questioned, and changed. Part three includes five chapters on childhood socialization, the role of family and peers, eco- nomic and political life, the workplace, and the justice system. In each of these chapters, power is problematized. An epilogue, "The Ties That Bind" leaves the student with a thought provoking assessment of ways that current cultural defini- tions of both masculinity and femininity are con- straining. This chapter stimulates thought about ways that patriarchal society limits everyone's lives: men and women alike. Further, it allows the interested student to realize that not only has</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 373 much changed since 1900, but that it is now vital for every successful individual to develop quali- ties traditionally associated with both genders. Each chapter ends with a summary, a list of key terms, and suggestions for additional reading that will be helpful to ambitious students and essay writers. The detailed 65-page bibliography has been expanded and updated to include ap- proximately 2000 items. This contributes directly to one of the text's major strengths: its ability to evaluate and resituate major issues in light of new research. Research, since the first edition in 1988, makes it abundantly clear that studies devoted to gender related issues are of utmost importance. The text deals well with diversity, and continues to make an effort to include the lives of Native American women. Essentially, though, this text does no more than the vast majority of texts in universities and colleges today. I would like to have seen a theoretical elaboration of post-modernity and the postcolo- nial context of contemporary research. But, ad- mittedly, these topics are difficult to broach in an introductory text. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Sex and Gender is its ability to focus on both theory and methodology in such a way that does not bog down in sheer boredom or lose the introductory reader in jargon-filled complexity. This text does justice to the theoretical and empir- ical nature of its subject, while attempting to stimulate progressive change in society. REFERENCES Ashton-Jones, Evelyn, Gary Olsen, and Merry G.
