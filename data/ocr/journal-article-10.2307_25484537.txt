<plain_text><page sequence="1">R.T. Smith Altered Light: Outside History Like Aeneas, who had to brave the mysteries of Avernus and transcend past sorrows before he could re-enter the light through the ivory gate, Eavan Boland faces the shades of her personal, cultural and gender past. Her 1990 volume Outside History explicitly chronicles this attempt to shed the constricting husk of myth and enter the nightmare of history. To accomplish this transformation, she must abolish the traditional notion that the kitchen, the garden, the convent and par lour (in short, the domestic realm) do not afford merely a sheltered demesne for the personal affairs once designated as "distaff," but can indeed provide a venue for today's women to reckon with. Boland must subvert her culture's habit of viewing history as "his-story", and "her-story" as mere heresy or irrelevance. She must, in fact, re-enter the light through the more chastening gate of horn. Given the temper of the decade, Boland's project would seem timely and inevitable, but the male-legislated and -dominated Field Day Anthology of Irish Writing on the one hand and the hostile review of Outside History in The New York Times Book Review on the other suggest that paternalistic and patronising obstacles remain. Though these vestigial forces may be willing to admit that women need (or can) no longer be relegated to the role of art's symbolic furniture (muse or virgin, Mother Ireland or aisling vision), they still wish to define and orchestrate the nature of the poems women write. When Boland suffers their censure or neglect, it is perhaps because she casts the same sceptical and rebellious eye as Dickinson in observing that the other members of her household "address an Eclipse, every morning ? whom they call their 'Father.'"1 Boland's project of resistance to the patriarchy is complex. It is, in the midst of a poetic revival of Horatian decorum and tidiness, at once a commitment to a blemished lyric where scars must be acknowledged and salved, and a radical political act which would expose readers to the crepuscular ambiguities of emotional life and encourage them to abandon what Dickinson referred to as the "quartz contentments" and "dimity convictions", to acknowledge and testify and heal. Even in America, the list of canonised poets who are women is not long ? Dickinson, Rich, Plath, Bishop, Moore, and Sexton, with Rita 1. Emily Dickinson, 'To T.W.

Britain admits few others ? Rosetti, Barrett Browning and Stevie Smith, with Wendy Cope, Penelope Shuttle and Fleur Adcock still on probation. In Ireland, in spite of the strong anthology of women poets, Pillars of the House, and the more recent Wildish Things, only the works of Boland, Mebdh McGuckian and Nuala Ni Dhomhnaill have been acknowledged as significant contributions. Considering the political awareness and almost universally-declared will to change, this lack of progress suggests the Keatsian stasis of the "Cold Pastoral" or the house arrest Boland describes in "An Old Steel Engraving": we have found the country of our malediction where nothing can move until we find the word, nothing can stir until we say this is what happened and is happening and history is one of us who turns away while the other is turning the page.2 But Boland, unlike Keats, finds no enriching ambivalence in such suspension. She recognises that women poets may have been granted rooms of their own, but their father's house seems to open a limited number of mansions to them. Although she imagines the available chambers as haunted and empowering in "The Rooms of Other Women Poets" ? "a room you came to as I come to this/ room with honeyed corners, the interior sunless ..." ? they are still places where one cannot help but "feel/ the ache of things ending in the jasmine darkening early." (p. 12) Throughout Outside History this twilight feeling conveys at once a stimulating resonance and an urgency, for time is running out, and woman is still "Under glass, under wraps" like the dressmaker's porcelain model in "The Shadow Doll" (p. 17). In her pamphlet A Kind of Scar (reprinted in America as "Outside History"), Boland records the abruptness with which women have gone from inhabiting Irish poems as specular objects to inventing them. She admits that this transit is "a disruptive one",3 raising "questions of identity, issues of poetic motive and ethical direction."4 The tensions between her rights as a person and the traditions of her country complicate and enrich the texture of her writing as she strives 2.

This gift for wounding an artery of rock was passed on from father to son, to the father of the next son... (p. 22) while registering her awareness of the contained fury behind finesse and the fact that it has, less through reward or invitation than as an historical inevitability, fallen to her ? This gift... is an aptitude for injuring earth while inferring it in curves and surfaces; is this cold potency which has come, by time and chance, into my hands. This poem introduces questions of purported trespass and usurpation, art's necessary cruelty in the service of kindness ("the cicatrice of skill"), and the frigid distance that threatens to accompany the mastery of any craft. As David Baker writes in The Kenyon Review, "What she inherits is a remainder or artifact of the male imagination dominant in the making of history and poetry."9 The jagged, linear dislocations and frayed stanzas reinforce this sense of suffering, the "learned" scars. Clearly, Boland has no illusions about the cost of shar ing the power, and she recognises that seizing the language ("findfing] the word") is as dangerous as it is necessary. While her male Irish counterparts manipulate the centuries-old dynamic of subjugation to Britain to provide volcanic subtexts for their work, Boland attempts to d?colonise the body and psyche of 5.

In his essay "Yeats and Decolon isation", Said describes this predictably resultant birth of solidarity as "the mobilising force that coalesce[s] into resistance against an alien and occupying empire on the part of peoples possessing a common history, religion, and language."10 Traditionally, the women of Ireland have been invisible, officially banished to the outposts of child-minding, housekeeping and cooking (though they have, in fact, also engaged in taxing physical labour). Boland wants to escape the prescribed and slanted history that would cast her as aisling, Galatea, Gretta Conroy or the shade of Dido, and to enter genuine history by asserting her voice in service of experiences that are not merely peripheral nor eccentric, but central. She writes that she "came to believe that my invisibility as a woman was a disguised grace. It had the power to draw me, I sensed, towards realities ..Z'.11 These realities provide her with the occasions of poems like "A False Spring" and "What We Lost", which address what Jung called "the terrible ambiguity of an immediate experience/LAlthough her poems carry some explicit ideology, it is nearly always rendered dramatic, and not coded for its adherents alone. Her task is to find, or create, the authentic and aesthetically communicable gender signature in an attentive orchestration of a narrative. That narrative is occasionally, due to its accustomed status as marginal, fragmented and "full of chaos". The very title of Boland's collection, however, alerts the reader to a still broader arena. Ever aware of the weather and the diurnal and solar cycles, these poems are extra- vagant in Thor eau's sense of "wandering out". They record the seasons and stations of emotion as they coincide with "dusk before thunder" (p. 11) in "The Black Lace Fan my Mother Gave me", "Easter light" in "The Latin Lesson" (p. 20), "failing light" in "What we Lost (pp. 43-4), and "light/ which was short-lived and elegiac" in "We are Human History. We are not Natural History" (p. 38). One of the high ironies Boland reveals is that, whether in the fruitful summer light of "The Photograph on my Father's Desk", the chilled light of autumn ("The Carousel in the Park") or winter darkness ("Outside History"), tradition both locks women in the house with the "trapped heat and sleep" (p. 55) of "Midnight Flowers", and outside the public forum. They are at once excluded and enclosed. The poet counters by carrying her words and actions outside, as far as the river, into the mountains and beyond, inhabiting the shadows and thresholds between noon and dawn. Her imagination thrives in these places and moments of passage which 10. Said, p. 74. 11. Boland, a Kind of Scar, p. 20. 89</page><page sequence="5">IRISH UNIVERSITY REVIEW reflect the current state of women's liberation. One of the dramatic accomplishments of Outside History is its interweaving of this penum bral motif through all three movements of the book. In "The Rooms of Other Women Poets", the shadows become so vital that they "have leaves" (p. 12). In "Object Lessons" they shelter a romantic scene. In "Spring at the Edge of the Sonnet" they "seem nothing more than// sweet exchequers for a homeless kiss" (p. 53). Nearly half the poems in the volume refer overtly to shadows and twilights. The nexus of this image-cluster occurs in "The Latin Lesson", where the narrator studies Book VI of The Aeneid at Easter while a "storm light comes in from the bay." (p. 20) She savours the beautiful "vagrant and strange" words "to discover// the pathway to hell and that these/ shadows in their shadow-bodies ... are/ the dead." (pp. 20-1) In the realm of shades, Aeneas is transformed by contact with the supernatural and the supra-rational. Following him there, the student discovers the glamour (in the old Gaelic, spellbinding sense) of words as well as their power to make things happen. Scott Ward, writing in Southern Humanities Review, accurately identifies "The Latin Lesson" as a poem about "manners and responsibility",12 which are less distinct categories than they at first appear. Unlike the early pundit who proclaimed Fatti maschii, parole femine (Deeds are masculine, words are feminine), the convent girl of this poem understands that words can be actions and that neither gender holds legitimate sovereignty over them. Governing her tongue while being governed by it, Boland refuses euphemism in the service of diplomacy and uses her civil speech to subvert and revise, rather than to subjugate and repulse. Her bold yet tortured assertions are moving enough to make one doubt Auden's claim that poetry makes nothing happen, while the density and intensity of implication in her poems are provocative enough to occupy the most resistant reader. In spite of the distinction Boland makes in her title "We are Human History. We are not Natural History", her emphasis on the natural context in which human events occur reveals her to be the most important kind of nature poet. Clearly not intoxicated by the wild sensuality of nature, she attends to the natural cycle, whatever is begotten, born and dies. In this poem, the encounter between children and "a swarm of wild bees" (p. 38), which suggests both venom and honey in "a final/brightness", is the focusing event which will give one evening its radiance in a woman's memory, will fix the social and psychological resonance within a particular summer and a specific awareness. As Mary Kinzie suggests in American Poetry Review, Boland's "natural world, still agriculturally precarious, is everywhere 12. David Scott Ward, untitled review, Southern Humanities Review, Volume XXVI, Number 3 (Summer 1992), p. 299. 90</page><page sequence="6">ALTERED LIGHT: OUTSIDE HISTORY imaginatively inhabited."13 The revenant victims of famine, oppres sion and expulsion have been "made use of" by nature. Their ghostly insistence draws Boland to her local landscape, which Kinzie writes "is a terrain crowded and peopled and poignant in almost directly inverse proportion to its current appearance of abandonment and dereliction".14 If this natural world often finds parallel in the crucible of the kitchen, it is because here is the source of bread and meditation, the engine room of the sustaining social unit. In its dedication to process and plenty, it is the most natural-seeming region of the house. Lacking the strident pitch of some of her more ludic colleagues who would hope to overthrow all oppressions by men with each individual speech act, Boland appears to exhibit none of those "pathologies of power" (to use Eqbul Ahmad's term) that usually replace the resident tyrannies. The tenderness, sorrow and generosity ? but not weakness or resignation ? that inform her poems about romantic allegiances, truces and losses suggest an amplified amnesty that excludes neither gender. The man, for example, in "Object Lessons", is not auto matically assigned blame for the couple's failure. Her poems attempt what Said calls "bridging the gap between imperial center and peripheral territories",15 which may accurately represent the Irish male-female conflict in geographical terms. Said identifies Yeats's own greatest enterprise as the attempt to reconcile the necessary disruption of colonial upheaval with "the discourse of reason, of persuasion, of organization, with the requirements of poetry".16 Not content simply to tend her own garden, to nurse her personal complaints, to yield to what the equally spirited Dickinson called "that white sustenance despair", nor to accept the role of nourishing symbol recommended by Bishop Gilbert of Limerick in the Middle Ages when he claimed women were to "marry, and serve, those who pray, work, and fight",17 Boland has chosen to assert her own auctoritas, to do the praying, working and fighting for herself, though she does not invite denigration of the currently empowered males, as do the title and editorial spirit of the recent book of interviews with Irish women writers entitled Sleeping with Monsters. It may seem unnatural to discuss in sociopolitical terms a book of lyrical poems which are, foremost, language rendering and evoking experience too vital and rife with integrity to yield to fashionable 13.

But this approach occurs in the wake of two kinds of reviews Outside History has drawn. The first, a well-intentioned and celebratory piece in Poetry Ireland Review, claims that the book is "beyond praise".18 This would perhaps suggest that the collection transcends description and meticulous analysis, which does not serve as invitation to confront the book on its own serious grounds. The second is William Logan's attack in The New York Times Book Review, which, while occasionally attempting to soften the blow by admitting that the book displays some skill and contains an occasional decent poem, actually dismisses Boland as "a darling of the sure particu lar"19 and asserts that "[p]oems of quiet desperation in the kitchen do not form an original aesthetic."20 Logan's unsympathetic perspec tive amounts to an American version of what Jody Allen-E?andolph calls the "Irish bardic tradition radically exclusive to women poets and dismissive of themes drawn from women's experience."21 While the Poetry Ireland review seems perhaps too blinded by Boland's brilliant imagery and poignant psychological candour, Logan's review is too determined to see her as a poet of formula, "the passionless household poem, its subject the incident reminiscent, its tone the retrospect melancholy, its diction the vernacular significant."22 The shortfall of the first lies in its hasty enthusiasm where a more ruminant perspec tive will find the leaves so green because the roots run deeper than imagined; the wild volley of the latter seems a desperate phallocentric attempt to deny the validity of a woman's venue and experience. This is not to minimise the etched precision of Boland's imagery nor the intricacy of its patterns. Contrasting poetry to fiction in The New York Times Book Review (19 May 1992), Jeffrey Paine includes Boland in a list of "competent poets" "writing poems that often aren't dense enough to require a second reading, yet taken together, they are sending X-ray beams of nuanced perception into the margins, among the changed symbols and meditations of our late 20th century lives."23 Although Boland's poems do gather force as one looks beyond each star to discern the whole constellation, as one would expect of a writer with such a passionately held socio-political agenda, her language within poems is anything but transparent. Writing with a Yeatsian "fiery shorthand", she creates on the page a charged field rich with 18. ?ine Ni Ghlinn, :"Beyond Praise", Poetry Ireland Review No. 32 (Summer, 1991), p. 94. 19.

Even the six couplets of "Mountain Time", one of the shortest and least complex poems in Outside History, testify to the subtlety of Boland's technique: Time is shadowless there: mornings re-occur only as enchantments, only as time for her to watch berries ripen by on the mountain ash; for him, at a short distance from her, to catch fish. Afterwards, darkness will be only what is left of a mouth after kissing or a hand laced in a hand; a branch; a river; will be what is lost of words as they turn to silences and then to sleep. Yet when they leave the mountain what he will remember is the rowan trees: that blemish, that scarlet. She will think of the arc of the salmon after sudden capture ? its glitter a larceny of daylight on slate, (p. 19) Ignoring the book's architectonics and evolving treatment of light and dark, male and female, damage and value, one is still drawn to the richness of implication resulting from such features as the initial pair of well-behaved rhyming couplets giving way to snaggled enjamb ments and unpredictable, emphatic caesuras. Although the dominant twelve-syllable line legislates for order, reinforcing the "for her ... for him", "he will... she will" parallels, the "enchantments" mentioned in the second line imply a less stable rhetorical moment. The opening phrase suggests the way time is frozen in memory, but also extreme, uncompromising black-and-white perspectives. The woman celebrates the landscape, watches "berries ripen", as the man intrudes on nature, trying to hook fish. None of this is very surprising, and the centre of the poem suggests that the two activities are somehow complemen tary, but not without reminding the reader that darkness will be both the aftermath of affection and "what is lost of words/ as they turn to silences ...". The pronoun in that last phrase is not carefully anchored, in order to refer at once to "words" and the couple, who clearly provide the antecedent for "the/' in the next line. As this hush falls, some kind of sorcery is taking place here, most clearly revealed by the man's remembering what the woman has focused on, and vice versa. Yet the man will see the ripening colour as "that blemish" and will think of the ash as the Druidic "rowan". (Both common names refer to Sorbus aucuporia, whose species name derives from fowlers' use of its berries to make a paste for catching birds.) The woman, meantime, will recall the shadowed opulence of the salmon in the writhe of capture. Its "glitter" will resemble the shine of daylight on slate, but as 93</page><page sequence="9">IRISH UNIVERSITY REVIEW "larceny", as if daylight has stolen some valuable darkness from the slate, as the man has stolen the fish from the river. Perhaps this exchange of attentions is not so extreme as it seems and merely a sign that the couple are quietly sensitive to each other's interests. Both the river and the tree branch are ramiform, anthropomorphic, bewitch ingly inconclusive. It also seems unlikely that an Irish poet would casually introduce a salmon, the traditional vehicle of wisdom in Irish folklore, in a poem. The wisdom enacted by the two principals is quiet and enchanted, a covenant, and yet the violence and transgression of the final image are not altogether banished by its vitality. Some ominous suggestion still hovers over this scene, an awareness of the unenchanted world to which the couple must return, perhaps underscored by the man's oblivion to the fish's plight and the allusion to seizure by force, the whisper of rape. Recalling the bloody scarlet as "blemish", the bucolic enchantment and the voracious cast, one may easily remember the "brute blood of the air" and "white rush" in "Leda and the Swan" and it is difficult not to review the Yeatsian question of knowledge accompanying power. A final complexity derives from the near-formal impression of the closing couplet with its four words ending in "r" sounds, the echo of "salmon ... sudden", the long "a's" of "daylight" and "slate". One almost feels the poem returning to its deceptive initial calm, a calm now haunted and strained. As David Walker finds in all of Boland's newer work, her "insights about that [familiar] life are notably more idiosyncratic, sharply delineated and surprising"24 than either her earlier work or that of other poets. Perhaps this is because the feature of her birthright Boland is claiming in her poignant scenarios from the lives of women in contemplation or interacting with men is complexity, fruitful ambivalence, ambiguity. Logan's review proclaims, "When a poet is so self-divided, so drawn to the realms she despises, it should not be surprising if her poetry suffers division too .,.".25 But what one finds instead in Boland's poetry are torsion, counterpoint and ? even in the midst of poems whose overall tone is meditative or decisive ? a socket of uncertainty where negotiation and accommodation of contrarieties continue. In poems filled with shadows, passage, wounds, confessions of frustration and failure, dying myths and fading treasures, fioland is still very much a poet of hope and passion, using the language lovingly to display her mastery (an unfortunately gender-loaded term that wants subverting) of enjambment, pace and rhythm. A mark of her excellence, Dickinson's "courteous, yet harrowing grace", is the 24. David Walker, "Improvising the Blackbird", Field, No. 44 (Spring 1991), 97. 25. Logan, p. 22. 94</page><page sequence="10">ALTERED LIGHT: OUTSIDE HISTORY deployment of eruptive, disorderly colloquial language, sparks and shards of scenes, jolting metres, fragments and tangled, resistant syn tax ? all extending the frontiers of meaning. Examples of her syntactic refraction abound, but two of the most challenging are the closing sentence of "The Latin Lesson", which begins with "and", then employs the conjunction three more times to bind its slowly unfolding compound predicate, or the final twilit sentence of "We are Human History. We are not Natural History": And this ? this I thought, is how it will have been chosen from those summer evenings which under the leaves of the poplars ? striped dun and ochre, simmering over the stashed-up debris of old seasons ? a swarm of wild bees is making use of. (p. 38) As poetry of equally excellent psychological insight, an ability nourished by the author's outside perspective, Outside History draws praise from Peter Sirr as an advance beyond that "extraordinarily self aware"26 earlier book The Journey, and from Susan Stewart, who states in American Poetry Review that the poet "takes certain risks with the reader: she constantly turns to interior scenes bound by the frame of diurnal time and commands us to think of what it means to watch a life."27 A life, one might add, under constant, nervous male surveillance. "We Were Neutral in the War", with its "exclusions" and denials akin to those at the dinner party in Joyce's "The Dead", and "Distances", with its candied apples' "mush inside the crisp sugar/ shell" (p. 63), reflect the unacknowledged domestic and cultural pain and exemplify this bondage. In a review of Edna St Vincent Millay's poems, Boland discusses the perils of such self-restriction, expressing disappointment that the American poet's "introversion raises expec tations of a definite and achieved self", while "electing] to be a female stereotype in her poems."28 No such disappointment awaits the reader of Boland's self-scrutinising explorations, which never become mere emotional autobiography nor display imaginative timidity. Neither does she attempt to camouflage ideological, national nor personal distress with the rattle of polemic. In her relentless excavation of the local events and moments that bear witness to women's legitimate place in history and the inter 26.

Although each poem represents a significant skirmish or pitched battle in the quest for full investiture, none of the individual poems in Outside History is more impressive than the structural certainty, the spectrur^i about which she has designed the volume. The initial section, "Obje?t Lessons", introduces motifs of exile (as in "The Game"), fragility and damage, and the puzzling interactions between men and women, through meditations on an elegant fan, the furniture of a room, a mug, a text, a doll and silver dinnerware. Although she makes no pretence of presenting "objective" lessons, she does focus on "objectionable" ones, lessons in which the outsider's perspective is given weight, the acts and words in the private house and garden are recognised as too close to the lens for conventional history to examine. This is an insurrection against traditional male iconography. In these evidently quiet moments, she finds impacted drama and the first trip, albeit literary, to hell's darkness for confrontation with troubling spirits. Orchestration of light, silence, weather and locale provide transition from one poem to the next. The intelligent, unyielding inquisition of Boland's voice provides steady steerage from the Paris caf? and souvenir of 'The Black Lace Fan my Mother Gave me", through an Audubon bird book, into the countryside and the customs, and con cludes with the return to the ritualised marital inertia of perhaps the same caf? couple where "past and future are/ the fended-off and far fetched" (p. 24). References to the ghostly and blemished anticipate the grimmer presence of the past in the second section, a more explicitly feminist sequence which gives its title to the overall book. With characteristic masculine certainty, Robert Frost once said, "Politics is about the grievances, poetry is about the grief". The powerful chthonic presence in "The Achill Woman" of the famine as it ravaged the west of Ireland argues that the distinctions between politics and poetry on the one hand and grievance and grief on the other are less evident than Frost imagined. Although Boland herself has thoroughly discussed the origins of this opening poem of the title sequence, it is worth repeating that the narrator comes "all talk, raw from college" (p. 27), armed with her "set text/ of the Court poets of the Silver Age" and blithe resolution to study, only to encounter in the dim light the soft-spoken endurance and courage of a local woman as "An Easter moon rose." In the previous section, Lenten talks and Easter lessons provided the backdrop for an imaginative descent into mythical and symbolic hell. Here, the hellish presence is historical, rather than Virgilian, the severity of existence on an Atlantic-facing island. Although any connections to Achilles, who inhabits Avernus, and the name of this place are not of the poef s making, she is surely 96</page><page sequence="12">ALTERED LIGHT: OUTSIDE HISTORY aware of the disparity between the Greek warrior's blind rage and the contained anger of the modest islander. The narrator "made a fire/ and took down my book" (p. 28) (Is it possible to ignore the ironising echoes of Yeats's "When You Are Old" here?) and went to sleep, oblivious to "the harmonies of servitude", the fact that the woman's grace and dignity have been wrested from severity and sorrow. This narrative, charged by the current narrator's shame at her own earlier inability to see, begins the central sequence, which Jody Allen Randolph has described as follows: The formal structure of the sequence is as fully accomplished as its themes. It has an ingenious clock-like configuration: twelve poems cycle through timescapes of changing light and changing seasons, suggesting both the twelve positions on a lock face as well as the twelve months of the calendar. In a private interview, Boland described the sequence as a study in the breakdown of control: 'It deals deliberately with the artificial construct of time and the seasons, and the ways in which these artifices of control ultimately break down.'29 As do liturgical calendars, syllabi, parliamentary procedure ? all the imperial devices for collecting and classifying experience into manageable abstractions. In the sequence's second poem, "A False Spring", the narrator says: I want to find her, the woman I once was, who came out of that reading-room in a hard January, after studying Aeneas in the underworld, how his old battle-foes spotted him there.... (p. 29) Instead of finding the younger woman, who is "embodied now", no longer ghostly, she is left with early narcissi and "what one serious frost can accomplish." (p. 30) This is both autobiography and a myth blending attempt to speak to other women of their altering lives. The narrator abruptly begins the next poem, "The Making of an Irish Goddess", with, "Ceres went to hell," (p. 31) and the speaker must "make the same descent", suffer the same dislocations and scars ? the failed harvests, the fields rotting to the horizon, the children devoured by their mothers.... (p. 32) 29. Allen-Randolph, p. 20. 97</page><page sequence="13">IRISH UNIVERSITY REVIEW By the end of the poem, in spite of her desire to communicate hard earned knowledge, the Ceres-mother sees her own daughter, "her back turned to me." From poem to poem, landscape, season and myth overlap, interweave and inform, with language the one hopeful fluency, but even the word is almost doomed, as the woman weeping in "the re-enactment" (p. 42) of "We are Always too Late" cannot benefit from the protagonist's experience ? "And she never even sees me." Despite the shared stories, the women are as far outside history as "These stars ?/ these iron inklings of an Irish January" (p. 45), and the sorrow-initiated whispers in the ears of current sufferers "are always too late." The entire urgent sequence carries tinctures of anger and resolution, as the events of the past keep emitting their wintry light into the present, as do the dead stars. The final section, "Distances", focuses on the past, the narrator's childhood and children, isolation and the struggle to escape it, "door step kisses", and as Boland insists, "the same thing in a different light." These poems seem at once less directly political, less intricately linked and more occasional, yet they document an era before women had succeeded in raising their voices. In some respects, the section is more reminiscent of her poems before The Journey, yet they also display her characteristically quiet pathos and the counter-weighting and complex beauty of the commonplace: I could be undone every single day by paradox of what they call in the countryside blackthorn winter, when hailstones come with the last apple blossom, (p. 55) Sean O'Riordan once wrote that an adult may explain away a passing horse with a label, losing it, while a child will embrace and wonder at all the horse's qualities, sweating haunch, clopping hoof and horsy smell. That enthusiasm, that god-filled feeling, he suggests, is the heart of poetry, and that very haunted and lucid "thisness" is what Boland's poems never lack. Epiphany has always been in the wind that blows through her words, but the voltage is higher in Outside History than in other volumes because the specific historical events such as the Flight of the Earls and the pictura loquens from Renoir and Degas have given way to a more urgent frame. Evidently aware of her new exigency and temerity, Boland seems to have re written some of her earlier, though already successful, poems with increased voltage: "In Exile" occupies much of the same thematic territory as the earlier "An Irish Childhood in England: 1951", while the plenteous "Listen. This is the Noise of Myth" becomes the spare and wrenched "We are Always too Late". In terms of influence, both the occasional anonymous accretion of detail and the Plath-oracular 98</page><page sequence="14">ALTERED LIGHT: OUTSIDE HISTORY voice and slender lines have given way to a compound of Lowell, Hardy, Dickinson and Yeats all governed by a timbre that is distinctly Boland, created by the multiple displacements of a subject whose ethnic language has been outlawed, whose gender has remained mar ginalised despite camouflaging "reverence" and who was physically absent from her native landscape and language during important formative years. Despite these assaults upon identity, she is able to see beyond any Pauline strictures suggesting that "the letter killeth, while the spirit giveth life." Like all major poets, Boland strives to shape an alphabet of the spirit, signs and gestures that possess the valour of action and pro mote life. It is in the hues and values of her words, and not in the kitchen locale, that one finds her "original aesthetic". Her poetry, reminiscent of Charles Wright's claim that poems must be both reliquary and transcendent, renders images with the brilliance to remain in the mind as artefacts and discoveries whose emotional and intellectual radiance extends far beyond their circumstances. In "yield ing" to what de Man often calls "the temptation of immediacy", she has demonstrated that the urgent is not synonymous with the transitory. Perhaps her own brave poems testify that words are actions and that, so long as writers are willing to overthrow the mis-govern ing forces of canonical inertia to sing against the darkness, it is not, in fact, too late, and that the time of healing is not so distant as she fears. 99</page></plain_text>
