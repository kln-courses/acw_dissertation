<plain_text><page sequence="1">African Archaeological Review, Vol. 13, No. 2, 1996 New Research on the Holocene Settlement and Environment of the Chad Basin in Nigeria Peter Breu nig,1 Katharina Neumann,1 and Wim Van Neer2 Recent investigations of three archaeological sites in the Nigerian part of the Chad Basin during the Holocene reveal key stages in the cultural development and environmental history of that region. At Dufuna, a dugout boat was dated to around 6000 BQ making it the oldest known boat in Africa and one of the oldest in the world. Boats may thus have contributed to the mobility of the population of the southern edge of the Sahara 8000 years ago and, thereby, to the cultural homogeneity of this period. The pottery site at Konduga is around a thousand years younger than Dufuna but still belongs to the time of Mega-Chad. The site is on the Bama Ridge, an old shoreline. Its pottery, decorated in the Saharan tradition, belongs to the earliest ceramic phase of the West African Later Stone Age, long before the beginnings of food production. Although this site was probably settled by pioneers advancing into a largely flooded landscape along the slightly raised shoreline, the human occupation of the area previously covered by Mega-Chad began along a broad front around 2000 BC Archaeological and palaeoecological finds from two settlement mounds at Gajiganna are described as case studies for this phase, which predates the well-known site of Daima.

INTRODUCTION In contrast to the Sahara, little is known of the pre-Iron Age cultural development and Holocene environmental history of the West African savanna. Of necessity, overviews such as that by S. Mclntosh and R. Mclntosh (1983) have developed models of settlement and environmental history for the Sahara, in which the savanna has then been included. The present paper deals with the southwestern Chad basin, which is no exception to these tendencies. Although the region's unusual richness in prehistoric sources has been known since Graham Connah's fieldwork in the 1960s (1976, 1981), the settlement mound at Daima has remained the only site shown on most archaeological maps. The lack of attention paid to archaeological research in this region stands in stark contrast to the importance of the Chad basin. Together with the rest of the Sahelo-Sudanic zone, it is considered to be the area of origin of the major African cultigens and thus of food production in sub-Saharan Africa (Harlan, 1971). The beginning of food production and its terminological treatment in the division of African prehistory have been central concerns until recent times (Sinclair et al, 1993). However, from the varied use of the term "Neolithic," taken from European and Near Eastern prehistory, it is clear that no unified view has been reached. The same applies to the importance attributed to food production in human history in general. It has been considered as anything from an epochal change to a relatively subsidiary supplement to the foraging economy, expressed by the terminological treatment of the beginning of food production as a late development in the Later Stone Age (Shaw, 1981). These varying attitudes arise to some extent from the extreme paucity of tangible facts which might transform theoretical</page><page sequence="3">Holocene Settlement and Environment of the Chad Basin 113 postulates into concrete statements. Results such as those from Dhar Tichitt in Mauretania on subsistence strategies leading to the domestication of Pennisetum are among the much-quoted exceptions (Munson, 1976; Amblard and Pern?s, 1989). Our aim in a long-term joint research program by the University of Frankfurt (Germany) and the African partner universities in Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) and Maiduguri (Nigeria) is therefore to contribute to the insufficiently researched archaeology, archaeobotany, and archaeozoology of the origins of animal and plant domestication and to incorporate them into the discussion of a primary center of domestication in Africa. We believe that progress may be made only by means of extensive excavation and collaboration with archaeobotanists and archaeozoologists. Every year since 1989 the project has included several months of fieldwork, working toward a typological and chronological framework, as well as the recovery and analysis of faunal and floral remains. The project has carried out research in the southeast of Burkina Faso. Various assemblages of the Later Stone Age were recorded. At Maadaga, a large rock shelter at the edge of the Chaine de Gobnangou, the Later Stone Age was stratified above a rich macrolithic complex (Breunig and Wotzka, 1993). With the help of numerous thermoluminescence dates, a basic framework for stages in ceramic development reaching back 4000 years was constructed (Ballouche et al, 1993). The investigation of charcoal from the sites shows changes from forest formations to savanna in the course of the last 7000 to 8000 years. These seem to have been due mainly to human impact ? most probably the use of fire for hunting purposes ? whereas climatic fluctuations were of minor importance. However, indica tors of large-scale cultivation have not been observed in the charcoal samples, and remains of cultivated plants are completely absent from the sites (Neumann and Ballouche, 1992). Apart from dog, the animal bone assemblage ? not securely datable ? consists entirely of remains of wild animals. From Oursi in the north of Burkina Faso recent research has defined a sequence of vegetation history with indications of an abrupt change in the pollen spectrum around 3000 years ago. Plants from open habitats, plowed and ?Fallow land, increase clearly from 3000 bp, giving the first in dications that agriculture may have been practiced here (Ballouche and Neumann, 1995). As this area is rich in prehistoric sites, it is hoped to follow the development of cultivation back to its early stages using ar chaeobotanical methods. The pollen diagram from Oursi clearly shows human influence on the development of the vegetation. It thus represents a clear contrast to the widely held tendency to attribute the vegetation his tory of the whole Holocene in the Sahel to climatic change rather than to human settlement and activity (cf. L?zine, 1989).</page><page sequence="4">114 Breunig, Neumann, and Van Neer NIGER Fig. 1. Map of the Chad basin showing the sites discussed in the text. In Nigeria, work is concentrated in the area around Maiduguri, the administrative center of Borno, and in another case on the region north of Potiskum (Yobe State) (Breunig et ai, 1993a, b; Breunig, 1996). Fur thermore, in late 1993 excavations were begun to the south of Lake Chad on settlement mounds in the vicinity of Daima. These mounds, all with stratified deposits several meters in thickness, represent archaeological po tential comparable with that of Near Eastern tells ? as shown by Connah (1976, 1981) in the case of Daima. The reasons for the formation of the tells in the southern Chad basin arise from the seasonal flooding of the clay plain during the rainy season. Then as now, the inhabitants protected their settlements from flooding by building them on relict islands of sand. Through continuity of settlement and the use of clay for building, thick</page><page sequence="5">Holocene Settlement and Environment of the Chad Basin 115 Fig. 2. The Dufuna boat. A tree trunk lies directly over the boat. deposits accumulated, containing extraordinary amounts of archaeological material. The preservation of organic material, including that of botanical remains, is good. We are therefore confident that we will gain knowledge about the history of plant cultivation and the exploitation of natural re sources in this region. While this part of the project is still in its initial stages, other inves tigations, on which detailed reports follow, are more advanced. These concern three sites from various stages of the Holocene in northeast Ni geria (Fig. 1). Each represents, in our opinion, a key site in the Holocene settlement of the Chad Basin.</page><page sequence="6">116 Breunig, Neumann, and Van Neer DUFUNA ? AN 8000 YEAR OLD DUGOUT BOAT At Dufuna (ca. 12?17N, 11?11'E), a small village on the Komadugu Gana River, outside the former extent of Mega-Chad, a dugout canoe was discovered, which is dated to 7264 B.P. ? 55 years (61164-6005 CalBC, KN 4683) and 7670 B.P. ? 110 years (6556-6388 CalBC, KI-3587) according to the conventional C-14 dates. This makes it the oldest boat in Africa and one of the oldest in the world. The boat was found at the edge of a seasonally flooded basin, 5 m below the surface. It is stratified below clays and sands ? some containing pollen ? whose alternating sequence is evidence of deposition in standing and flowing water, presumably as a result of shifts in the river channel. There are no associated archaeological finds. A few sherds and charcoal fragments were found in the layers above the boat. In a layer of gray clay directly above the coarse sand in which the boat lies, a small, complete, undecorated pot was found. A tree trunk is embedded in the same layer, transverse to the axis of the boat. The date of the trunk is 2612 B.P. ? 48 years (809-786 CalBC, KN-4689). The boat is fully preserved apart from a few missing fragments from the tops of the sides (Fig. 2). It has a length of 8.40 m and maximum breadth and height of around 0.5 m. The sides are barely more than 5 cm thick. The bow and stern are both pointed, giving the boat a notably more elegant form than finds of similar age from Mesolithic Europe, such as the dugout from Presse in the Netherlands (Van Zeist, 1957), which is dated to 8265 B.P. ? 275 years (Gro-486) (conventional date) and is the oldest boat in the world apart from suggested Late Palaeolithic skin boats (Ell mers, 1984; Tromnau, 1987). It is highly probable that the Dufuna boat does not represent the beginning of a tradition, but that it was preceded by a long development and that the origins of water transport in Africa reach even further back in time. The boat was made from the genus Khaya (family Meliaceae), Af rican mahogany. The four species of mahogany occurring today in Ni geria cannot be separated by their wood structure. K. ivorensis and K. anthotheca are rain forest trees, K. grandifolia grows in drier forests, and K. senegalensis extends through the savanna regions up to the southern edge of the Sahel where it is found along water courses (Keay, 1989; Maydell, 1986). All species of mahogany are suitable for boats and ca noes as the wood keeps well under water because of the phenol content in its heartwood (Irvine, 1961; Richter, personal communication). The wood of K. senegalensis is the heaviest of the African mahoganies and less easy to work than the other Khaya species. Nevertheless, it is often</page><page sequence="7">Holocene Settlement and Environment of the Chad Basin 117 used in the savanna regions today, and its suitability for boat building is well-known. Judging by the modern distribution, K. senegalensis would be the only species that could have grown as far north as the Dufuna region. However, as the climate was most probably more humid 8000 years ago, it is possible that the more southerly species were carried to this area by river. The boat will remain in the ground until the problems of conservation have been solved. Accordingly, the analysis of the boat's sides and the tool-marks on them will only be possible after the boat is lifted. However, even without the tool-marks it is likely that axe- or adze-like tools would have been necessary to hollow out the tree trunk, with or without controlled burning. Ground stone tools of this kind are known in West Africa only from later archaeological contexts. The tools were therefore probably unground core-axe-like and pick-like bifacial tools of macrolithic appearance, such as are known from Rim 1 (northern Burkina Faso) at about the same latitude (Andah, 1978) and known elsewhere in West Africa for decades (MacDonald and Allsworth-Jones, 1994). In some cases they have been considered as an adaptation to the forest environment (Shaw, 1980, p. 77). The inhabitants of Dufuna probably used the boat in exploiting the fish stocks of the Komadugu Gana. Whereas the present-day river almost vanishes in the dry season, and fishing plays a relatively minor part in local subsistence, hydrological conditions around 6000 BC would have made aquatic resources much more available. The boat existed at the same time as Mega-Chad, whose surface is agreed by most geographers to have been 40 m higher than its present level (Bawden, 1972). Today this would make it the largest lake in the world together with the Caspian Sea. The former shoreline of Mega-Chad indicates that Dufuna would then have lain barely 50 km from the lake. The flood plain at Dufuna may even have been a permanently flooded lagoon of Lake Chad, formed by inundation of the Komadugu Gana. Under these conditions fish would have been in abundant supply all year round. If these assumptions are correct, the makers of the dugout belonged to a population that spread along the southern edge of the Sahara, from north Kenya through the central Sudanese Nile Valley to the western Sahara, and adapted to the resources of the lakes of the early and mid-Holocene wet phase. The dugout indicates that water transport was part of the cultures of this period. The vicinity of the Mega-Chad inland sea stimulated the manufacture of boats in West Central Africa at a time for which comparable finds are known only from Europe.</page><page sequence="8">118 Breunig, Neumann, and Van Neer KONDUCA1 Fig. 3. Rocker stamp-decorated pottery from Konduga (around 5500-5000 bc). KONDUGA - THE BEGINNINGS OF POTTERY PRODUCTION Just as pre-Neolithic or epipalaeolithic pottery production is known in the Sahara with "wavy line decorated pottery," there seems also to have been a ceramic phase in the wetter regions of West Africa before the be ginnings of food production (Shaw, 1981, p. 216). Pottery was manufactured</page><page sequence="9">Holocene Settlement and Environment of the Chad Basin 119 in the West African south of the Sahara for 3000 years before the first food production, for which there is no firm evidence much before 3000 bp. The long-known observation, made in various parts of the world, that the inven tion of strong vessels suitable for use in cooking is not necessarily related to food production can be further confirmed by a newly discovered, very early pottery site in northeast Nigeria. The site is called Konduga. It is situated on the highest point of the Bama Ridge, which consists of beach sands and extends north as far as Niger and south into Cameroon (Grove, 1985, p. 39). The ridge is up to 12 m in height and spreads out in places to a width of several kilometers. It is generally considered to represent the shoreline of Lake Chad in the early and middle Holocene (Bawden, 1972). The site was found by H. Thiemeyer during geographical surveys. It is in a sand quarry, from whose undisturbed sections pottery was recovered, associated with charcoal which yielded dates of 6340 B.P. ? 250 years (5515-4994 CalBC, KN-4300), (Thiemeyer, 1992, 1993). Excavations to a depth of 1.2 m below the surface have revealed finds distributed through three horizons, of which only the lowest (1.0-1.2 m below the surface) is relevant in the present context. This assemblage is very small, consisting of quartz fragments, one abraded flake, charcoal particles, and a few sherds. There are no faunal remains. The age of the assemblage has been con firmed by a further C-14 date from individual charcoal fragments (6180 B.P. ? 60 years, 5241-5004 CalBC, UtC-2248). However, there is an unex plained discrepancy between these dates and a thermoluminescence date from pottery of 4150 BC. The context of the finds is stratigraphically secure. The sherds have unabraded edges and cannot have been transported any great distance. Their spatial distribution also suggests rapid incorporation into primary de posits: all conjoining sherds were found less than a meter apart. The deposition of the charcoal found with the pottery most probably took place not much later, and it is unlikely that older charcoal could have intruded into the sand ridge. It seems reasonable to assume that the available C-14 dates represent the age of the pottery. The pottery is heavily tempered with quartz fragments. Its surface is extensively decorated with a rocker stamp technique (Fig. 3). Typological parallels may be easily found with pottery of a similar age from the Sahara. In the eastern central Sahara, for example, pottery decorated in the style of Konduga succeeds the wavy line complex and falls into the sixth or fifth millennium B.P. (Schuck, 1990, p. 135). Shaw (1978/1979, p. 70) has sum marized the characteristic techniques of pottery decoration in the pre-food producing phase of West Africa as consisting exclusively of comb decora tion. The question of whether the rocker stamp technique known from</page><page sequence="10">120 Breunig, Neumann, and Van Neer Konduga is also present as an archaic element at the other sites still needs to be addressed. According to Shaw this technique, together with groove, roulette, and cord decoration, is not characteristic until the later ceramic horizons (after 3500-3000 B.P.). The importance of the site to the history of the landscape comes from the first direct date for the shoreline. The structure and laminated nature of the sand deposits leaves no doubt that they were laid down in water. The dated charcoal fragments are clearly rounded, which is considered to be typical of beach sediments (Thiemeyer, 1992, p. 116). The majority of the species in the modern plant communities of Kon duga is of Sahelian origin even though Konduga belongs to the Sudanian zone in the sense of Keay (1959). This is due mainly to the fact that the recent vegetation around the site is completely anthropogenic and consists of millet fields and fallows which are heavily grazed. In contrast, the char coal samples recovered from the site (Table I) indicate a Sudanian woodland or even a forest around 5500-5000 BC. In the upper layers frag ments of Terminalia were found which gave modern radiocarbon dates. Obviously Sudanian species were able to exist in the Konduga area up to modern times, and most probably a combination of overexploitation and decreasing rainfall is responsible for their disappearance in the twentieth century (Ballouche and Neumann, 1995). The date of the pottery is early for northeast Nigeria and breaks ? as does the Dufuna dugout ? the 3000 B.P. barrier, earlier than which no evidence of settlement had previously been known in the southwestern Chad Basin (Connah and Jemkur, 1982; Connah, 1984). However, it seems certain that the environs of the early and middle Holocene Chad basin were inhabited and ? in view of the desiccation of the Sahara ? were even important as an ecologically favorable environment. On the other side of the shoreline, away from Palaeo-Chad, there were probably extensive la goons, fed by the Yedseram and other rivers, such as are known today on a smaller scale as seasonal floods at Konduga. The Bama Ridge could thus have been a narrow land bridge at the time of the early and middle Holo cene lake, leading into a largely flooded area and playing a central part in the later settlement of the former lake bed.

Whereas Konduga simply provides evidence for the presence of a community that manufactured pottery comparable with that of the Sahara, the sites described below, some 3000 years younger, provide a more detailed picture of settlement and environment at the end of the Stone Age. In the time elapsed between Konduga and Gajiganna the landscape changed drastically. The waters of Lake Chad, more than 40 m above their present level in the Konduga phase (ca. 6000 B.P.), fell to</page><page sequence="13">Holocene Settlement and Environment of the Chad Basin 123 Fig. 5. Section through Gajiganna A. around 20 m above present levels by the time of the sites around Gajiganna (the earliest of which, not dealt with in the present paper, date back to around 3700 B.P. according to uncalibrated C-14 dates). Previously submerged areas dried out, forming a habitable landscape that was colonized by a population bringing with it domesticated animals and building the first villages in the southwestern Chad basin. Following the conventional view of the spread of domestic animals, particularly cattle, through North Africa over several millennia (Shaw, 1981, p. 223; Smith, 1984), it may be assumed that these groups came from the north, driven southward by the desiccation of the Sahara. However, this is difficult to prove archaeologically. According to the geographical division of northeast Nigeria by Tuley (1972), Gajiganna is situated in the northern part of the Bama Deltaic Complex. This complex has a very gentle, undulating relief, consisting of slightly raised sandy areas and clay plains which predominate toward Lake Chad. Delta sediments of the rivers Yedseram and Ngadda, and longitu dinal dunes in the southeastern and northern parts of the complex, are also present. Between the dunes are clay depressions, which combine in the east to form a clay plain with only sporadic sandy cover. The clays are lagoon deposits from the lake. Gajiganna was situated on the edge of this lagoon (Fig. 1).</page><page sequence="14">124 Breunig, Neumann, and Van Neer Fig. 6. Section through Gajiganna B. Stratigraphy and Dating Both of the sites at Gajiganna presented here (Gajiganna A and Ga jiganna B) consist of low mounds, around 2 m in height and 150 m in diameter, situated directly next to each other. They are surrounded by clay flats, which in places retain rainwater on the surface well into the dry sea son. Surface prospection and trial excavations in the environs of Gajiganna A and B have located numerous similar sites with comparable finds (Fig. 4). The two excavated mounds are thus representative of a phase of relatively dense settlement of this region, dated to the centuries before and after</page><page sequence="15">Holocene Settlement and Environment of the Chad Basin 125 3000 B.P. However, they do not represent the earliest settlement phase, which, according to recent excavations of sites nearby, goes back as far as 3700 B.P. (uncalibrated) and is characterized by a pottery facies quite dif ferent from that of Gajiganna A and B (Wendt, 1995). The northeastern sides of both mounds are eroded. The strong winds of the dry season have carried away the finer sediment, leaving concentra tions of archaeological material on the surface, which led to the sites' discovery during geographical surveys by H. Thiemeyer. In both cases, 5 x 5-m trenches dug at the highest points of the mounds revealed similar stratigraphy and almost identical finds. Settlement mound A consists of about 2 m of deposits (Fig. 5). The upper part of the meter-thick main cultural layer (layers 3, 4, and 5) is dated to 2960 B.P. ? 50 years (1286-1022 CalBC, UtC-2795). The sedi ment in these layers consists largely of clay. As there is no explanation for the natural deposition of clay on a mound situated on sand, we as sume that the clay was brought onto the site by the inhabitants in the form of mud-bricks or, more probably, daub for houses. However, apart from small daub fragments, we have no evidence to support this assump tion. The structural remains have probably been destroyed by the shrink ing and swelling of the clayey soil. Below the upper cultural layer there is a sterile sand horizon (layer 6), formed during a phase of increased aeolian deposition which may have been the result of a drier climate or of human influence on the environment. The lower cultural layer, only some 20 cm thick, is dated to 2930 B.P. ? 60 years (1236-1009 CalBC, UtC-2329) and is, thus, not clearly separated from the stratigraphically later phase. The stratigraphy of mound B at Gajiganna is very similar (Fig. 6), again with an upper and a lower cultural layer. The difference in the C-14 dates is clearer than for mound A. The upper cultural layer (layer 3) has a date of 2740 B.P. ? 50 years (967-813 CalBC, UtC-2331), and the lower cultural layer (layer 4) is dated to 3150 B.P. ? 70 years (1490-1318 CalBC, UtC-2330), 3140 B.P. ? 110 years (1520-1310 CalBC, UtC-2332) and 2880 B.P. ? 165 years (1304-834 CalBC, KN-4675). A pit, dated at its base to 3040 B.P. ? 120 years (1429-1052 CalBC, Kl-3605), reaches from the lower cultural layer to a depth of 4.5 m below surface. The upper cultural layer was also identified in a small test excavation at the foot of the mound, where it yielded dates of 2730 B.P. ? 50 years (966-811 CalBC, UtC-2796) and 2750 B.P. ? 70 years (971-811 CalBC, UtC-2797). The calibrated C-14 dates suggest an approximate duration of settlement at Gajiganna A and B from 1200 to 900 BC for the upper cultural layer and from 1500 to 1200 BC for the lower.</page><page sequence="16">126 Breunig, Neumann, and Van Neer Table II.

The lowest cultural layers are below the modern surface of the seasonally flooded clay plain surrounding the mounds. The surface of the clay must once have been at a lower level; otherwise, the settlements would have been built in water. Palaeoecology and Palaeoeconomy Evidence for the environment and economy is provided by well-pre served organic material: pollen, animal bones, and charcoal. However, attempts to recover fruit and seed remains by large-scale wet-sieving and flotation were unsuccessful. Only the kernels of Ziziphus sp. (carbonized) and Celtis sp. (uncarbonized) from Gajiganna A provide evidence for the</page><page sequence="18">128 Breunig, Neumann, and Van Neer gathering of wild fruit. Uncarbonized modern seeds, particularly of grasses which grow today in the area around Gajiganna, were found at depths of up to 330 cm, indicating severe bioturbation, which may have affected stra tigraphie integrity. Although the extent of any disturbance is difficult to estimate, the total mixing of deposits may be discounted in view of the logical sequence of charcoal dates and the existence of some intact contexts (burials). Analysis of pollen from the sands below the cultural layer at Gaji ganna B revealed a predominance of the pollen type Eugenia, which, together with other hygrophilous taxa, points to dense vegetation at the edge of water. The later settlement phases, on the other hand, are repre sented by plants of the open savannah, together with indicators of disturbance (A. Ballouche, personal communication). Further information on the environment and economy comes from the abundant faunal remains. Approximately 18,000 faunal remains were studied, of which almost 2000 were identifiable at site Gajiganna A and more than 1400 at site Gajiganna B (see Table II). The inhabitants used a wide variety of animals to meet their protein needs. Mollusks were collected, especially Aspatharia, which is a large aquatic bivalve, and Pila, a large terrestrial gastropod. During its estivation in drying swampy areas, the latter mollusk can be easily collected in large quantities. Fishing was practiced for a limited number of species: Polypterus sp., Heterotis niloticus, Gymnarchus niloticus and especially Ciarias sp. All these fish can live in shallow waters, which would have made exploitation easy. The other aquatic animals that were captured were terrapins, which are freshwater turtles that can survive in drying waters by burrowing into the mud. Besides fishing and harvesting of mollusks and aquatic turtles, hunting played a role in subsistence. At least 12 bird species were hunted, the majority of which live on or near water. Among the exploited wild mam mals the following species occur: giant rat, guenon monkey, viverrids, wild cat, serval, warthog, bohor reedbuck, duikers, and oribi. The majority of the faunal remains, however, comes from domestic animals: goats, sheep, and cattle. Sheep were rare in comparison to goat, which indicates that the available pasture may have been limited and used primarily for cattle (Redding, 1984). Whether this was due to climatic conditions, to overgraz ing as a result of the large size of the flocks, or to a combination of both factors is uncertain. Gajiganna is one of the earliest sites with domestic animals in West Africa south of the Sahara. The radiocarbon age of the site fits nicely with the theory of the spread of earliest pastoralists in Africa as shown in the isochronic diagram presented by Shaw (1981, p. 224) and recently updated by Krzyzaniak (1992).

Around 3000 B.P. (according to uncalibrated radiocarbon dates), probably even half a millennium earlier, herders arrived in the West African savanna. Among the few earliest find-spots in the savanna (Daima and Gajiganna in Nigeria, Douentza in Mali, Kintampo and Ntereso in Ghana), Gajiganna provides one of the largest and most secure samples. Further research is presently being conducted to try to reconstruct the possible seasonal occupation of the site. The cattle and goat remains comprise several juvenile and neonate specimens which should allow us to determine approximately the season during which they died. Combined with data on the present-day movements of herds in the area (Brauk?mper, 1996) an attempt will be made to obtain a model for the past. Today the area of Gajiganna is a rather harsh environment, belonging to the southernmost part of the Sahel. It is visited only during the rainy season by herders. Isolated bodies of water of limited extent are present. They are fed by the annual rains. The animal remains found at the sites allow a reconstruction of the former aquatic and terrestrial environment. The fish fauna comprise four taxa, of which the clariid catfish are the most common. These fish prefer shallow habitats and can survive in strongly deoxygenated waters with elevated temperatures and a high salinity. Atmospheric oxygen can be taken up by an accessory breathing organ. Both Heterotis and Gymnarchus are most common in marshy waters with abundant aquatic vegetation (especially Echinochloa stagnina). They also have accessory breathing organs allowing survival in oxygen-depleted waters. This is also the case for Polypterus, a taxon that prefers sandy bottoms and that occurs in considerable numbers in drying pools. Today the isolated pools near Gajiganna still contain Ciar?as. It can be considered a relic of an originally much richer fish fauna, which survived the last arid period until the present day. A natural enrichment of such an isolated pool is possible only through a connection with another body of water where more species occur. Establishing whether the waters near Ga jiganna were already isolated from the rest of the Chad basin at the time of occupation is difficult on the basis of the fish remains alone. In any case, the ichthyofauna was richer than the present-day relic faunas in iso lated waters of the Sahara, where clariids, cyprinids, and cichlids usually predominate (Van Neer, 1989). This could mean either that the water was still connected, even if only seasonally, with the Chad basin, or that the disconnection and the resulting decline in the number of species had hap pened only shortly before.</page><page sequence="21">Holocene Settlement and Environment of the Chad Basin 131 Regarding the number of species identified, it should be emphasized that it is quite possible that the ichthyofauna 3000 years ago was richer than indicated by the remains. Fishing techniques or dietary preferences may account for this. Geomorphological observations in the area also seem to indicate that the backwaters of a once larger Lake Chad formed a lagoon which extended as far as Gajiganna. On the basis of the vertical distribution of the identified species, an attempt was made to identify an evolution in the local environment, pos sibly toward more arid conditions. The only trend that can be seen for the terrestrial fauna is an increase in wild carnivores in the upper cultural layer of site Gajiganna A. This may be an indication of increased aridity and less phytomass, which resulted in a concentration of herbivores around the water. Carnivores preying on these animals followed and, as a result, be came more vulnerable to pr?dation by man. The chronological distribution of aquatic fauna was also analyzed. It might be expected that increased aridity and a possible decrease in the available water would be reflected in a reduction of the number of species, with the most resistant ones remaining numerous. It was also interesting to look at the distribution of the sizes of fish through time as adverse hy drologie conditions and overfishing may result in a decrease in size over time. However, no such trends are seen. Fifteen taxa have been identified in the charcoal samples from the upper and the lower layer of Gajiganna B (Table III), six of which are present in more recent vegetation (Ballouche and Neumann, 1995). In the lower layer the number of species is higher than in the upper one, but this is probably due to the larger number of identified fragments. As for the small number of charcoal fragments, the two layers are treated as a single unit covering a time span of several hundred years. Firewood was collected from the dunes as well as in the inundated depressions. The wooded grassland might have formed the grazing area for the cattle, whereas shrub was suf ficiently available to feed the goats. Taxa such as Ziziphus sp. and Balanites aegyptiaca indicate that grazing and browsing occurred, but the impact on the vegetation probably was not as severe as can be observed today. Char acteristic elements of the modern degraded pastures, such as Guiera senegalensis, Boscia senegalensis, or Calotropis procera, are missing in the samples. Nevertheless, the low number of sheep may indicate that there was already some overgrazing. Goats have a different diet and compete less with cattle for the same fodder. Typical forest plants, as have been found in Konduga, are not present in the charcoal samples. However, the bones of the forest duiker Cephalophus testify that there must have been some denser woodland or even patches of forest, probably at the edge of the water. In general, the</page><page sequence="22">132 Breunig, Neumann, and Van Neer Fig. 7a.

This fits with the mammalian fauna whose modern distribution is in the present-day Guinea and Sudanian vegetation zones of Nigeria (Happold, 1987). Elements typical of Sahelian savanna, such as gazelles, are completely absent. Ten of fifteen taxa in the charcoal samples are no longer present in the recent vegetation. The modern phytogeographical distribution of these taxa includes the Sahelo-Sudanian zone, and the mean annual rainfall in the Gajiganna area (as it was measured up to the 1970s) would be sufficient to support all of them. Species such as Terminalia and Prosopis africana are known for their excellent qualities as firewood, as charcoal, and for construction purposes (von Maydell, 1986). For that reason it seems rea sonable to suppose that overexploitation in the course of the past 3000 years is responsible for the impoverishment of the vegetation. Small-scale climatic fluctuations such as the great drought of the 1970s might well have accelerated the extinction of those species that reach the northern limit of their distribution in the Gajiganna area. Burials Although human bone was found in almost every stratigraphical unit, graves are confined to the upper cultural layer of Gajiganna A. The dead were buried within, or at least in the immediate vicinity of, the settled area. Grave pits could not be identified, and there were no grave-goods. All the skeletons were in the crouched position, lying on the side with arms flexed and with the hands in front of the face. There was no uniform orientation. Apart from one burial where the head was missing, the skeletons are com plete and undisturbed, although poorly preserved and very fragmented. According to anthropological analysis by F. R?sing (University of Ulm), two of the total of four burials are of young adult or middle-aged males, 178 ? 4 and 169 ? 4 cm in height. At least one of them shows negroid characteristics. There is also the burial of a 7 to 10 year-old-girl, and a juvenile female 158 ? 8 cm tall. Artifacts Pottery is by far the most abundant category of artifact. From both excavations, covering a total of just 50 m , around 180,000 sherds, weighing 750 kg altogether, were recovered. Based on the amount excavated, Gaji ganna mound A alone must contain an estimated 200 tons of pottery.</page><page sequence="26">136 Breunig, Neumann, and Van Neer o 0 O J J ^ 9 10 11 n ? o ?

Quaternary).</page><page sequence="30">140 Breunig, Neumann, and Van Neer The typological and technological study of the pottery will form the basis for the internal chronology of all sites investigated in the study area. By tying in the pottery chronology from current excavations immediately south of Lake Chad (Ngala-Daima region) and studying the temporal and spatial distribution of the key types, we hope to gain an outline of the course of settlement in the southwestern Chad basin during the Holocene. In this context, the settlement mounds Gajiganna A and B represent an early stage, but not the earliest. On the basis of the pottery, two phases can be distin guished in both mounds, identical to the stratigraphical separation between the upper and the lower cultural layers. The most conspicuous distinguishing feature is the tempering of the clay: whereas the clay of the later pottery phase is so heavily tempered with plant material that the surface is some times covered with plant impressions (analysis in progress), vegetable temper is completely absent in the earlier phase. Instead, only mineral components are used. Both groups have in common rounded vessel bases, hemispherical or globular bodies, and a common range of forms (dishes, jars, bowls, and globular vases) which may be subdivided further. The decoration is charac terized by painting on the upper part of the vessel and mat impressions on the lower part and, further, by its clear, uniform structure and various comb impressions arranged in horizontal bands (Figs. 7a and b). An older phase (between ca. 3700 and 3300 B.P.) is not present at the sites descibed here but is found at Konduga (the assemblage described above) and in the Ga jiganna region (Wendt, 1995). Compared to the pottery, lithic artefacts are sparsely represented (ca. 18 kg from both excavations). The reason for this is undoubtedly the distance be tween Gajiganna and the nearest sources of raw material (Garba, 1993). Except for Hadjer el Hamis 180 km to the north, a small range of hills consisting of rhyolite at the southern edge of Lake Chad, all lithic sources are well over 100 km south or southwest of Gajiganna. According to analyses carried out by S. Freeth (University College of Swansea, Great Britain) on the Gajiganna lithics, meta-vulcanites from Maroua (Cameroon), 200 km away, represent the most distant raw material source. Raw material from Hadjer el Hamis was abundant in Daima (Connah and Freeth, 1989). The fact that this material is absent from Gajiganna may suggest that access to this area was blocked by the lagoon, at the edge of which Gajiganna was situated. The most abundant stone tool group consists of fragments of grinding stones made of plutonites or sedimentary rocks. This is probably due to the importance that plant foods ? wild or cultivated ? must have had. As the de gree of fragmentation is very high, and most of the pieces are only a few cen timeters in size, it is hardly possible to reconstruct forms. Only one type, with a pointed base and dished sides, is definitely known at Gajiganna (Fig. 8: 20); it has already reached the British Museum in London as the "Sao-hat" of the</page><page sequence="31">Holocene Settlement and Environment of the Chad Basin 141 Chad basin (Connah, 1981, p. 49). Ground stone axes, adzes, and chisels were probably also important. Complete examples in this category range from 20 to just over 2 cm in size (Fig. 8: 1-8, 18, 19). They are made from vulcanites of varying textures. Flakes of this material occur in the excavated areas and all over the surface of the site. Almost all have ground surfaces, suggesting that they were detached during tool use. A few flakes were made into arrowheads, which, together with stone beads, represent further categories of lithic artifact (Fig. 8: 9-17). The arrowheads have bifacial invasive retouch and concave bases. This is a Saharan type which occurs only rarely in the West African savannah. The few parallels include sites of the Kintampo culture in Ghana (Davies, 1980, p. 215; Right, 1976, p. 214) and Dutsen Kongba (York, 1978) and Shilma (Con nah, 1981, p. 62) in Nigeria. The relatively high number of bone artifacts (80 from the excavations of both mounds) suggests that bone as a raw material probably compen sated for the shortage of stone. Tool forms include unilateral harpoons, indicating the exploitation of aquatic resources (see, however, Connah, 1981, p. 117). Bone points of various forms may be classed as weapons. Chisel-like tools are common. Rings made from long bones were probably for ornament (Figs. 9a and b). Art is represented by various anthropomorphic and zoomorphic clay figurines, all fired (Breunig, 1994). The anthropomorphic figures include some with clearly defined anatomical details such as ears, nose, eyes, and mouth and highly stylized forms on which only the hairline is shown. The animal figures include zoologically unclassifiable forms, on the one hand, and numerous conical fragments, on the other, probably representing the horns of boviform figurines. Boviform figurines are also predominant several centuries later in the Daima I phase south of Lake Chad, where anthropo morphic figures are absent (Connah, 1981, pp. 134ff). As far as Gajiganna is concerned, the great importance of cattle in the economy seems to have influenced the art. The art is simple but is among the earliest in Borno and comes, as in Daima, from a period before the beginnings of iron production. Considering the well-known figurative art of the Nok style, it seems reason able to suggest that art in this region has its roots in the Stone Age. SUMMARY Fieldwork carried out by the German-Nigerian project since 1991 has led to the discovery of sites which have yielded key data on the Holocene settlement and environment of northeast Nigeria. The present radiocarbon dates are listed in Table IV and summarized in Fig. 10, which represent the current state of research.</page><page sequence="32">142 Breunig, Neumann, and Van Neer The Dufuna find shows that the earliest boats known in Africa were built in the Chad basin, independent of contemporary developments in Europe. This, the earliest form of transport known from this region and period, shows the similarity of the early Holocene cultures at the southern edge of the Sahara in a new light. The dugout canoe may also have been one of the means of transport with which, around 7000 years ago, groups with pottery decorated in a Saharan style moved south along the shore of Mega-Chad, leaving their traces at Konduga. The sites in the Gajiganna area document the beginnings of animal domestication and village settlement in the region previously submerged by Mega-Chad. The inhabitants lived on low settlement mounds, close to clay depressions which were probably flooded all year round at the shifting edge of a lagoon connected to Lake Chad. In the course of at most 600 years (according to uncalibrated C-14 dates) of occupation, either the climate be came drier or human influence produced similar effects on the environment. All usable fauna of the region were hunted, including fish and other aquatic animals. Judging by the bone remains, however, wild animals were less im portant than domesticates, among which cattle were predominant. These were the earliest known domesticated animals in the region, and their age of around 3000 years fits with the general pattern of the appearance of early domesticated cattle in Africa. The importance of plant foods in Gajiganna is more difficult to estimate. Despite intensive searches, no remains of cul tigens have been found, so that we initially assume the existence of a nona grarian, pastoral economy, with the exploitation of wild plants. Reasons for the abandonment of the settlements are not known. The most likely are palaeoecological changes, which are known to have taken place during or after the occupation of Gajiganna. The lagoon dried out, and Lake Chad must have retreated to approximately its present extent. The waters returned only in the rainy season, and environmental conditions probably came to re semble those of today. The population, whose economy was at least partially based on aquatic resources, may have found conditions no longer suitable for living. Shortly after Gajiganna, settlement of the clay plains to the East began, which are only seasonally free of water. One of the important questions ad dressed by our current investigations concerns the supposition that the settle ment of this region spread from the former lagoon shore, including Gajiganna.
