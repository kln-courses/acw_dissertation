<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jokes of Nature andJokes of Knowledge: The Playfulness of Scientific Discourse in Early Modern Europe* by PAULA FINDLEN URING THE SIXTEENTH AND SEVENTEENTH centuries natural his- tory, and to a certain extent science in general, rediscovered its capacity for playfulness in the form of the scientific joke. By scien- tific joke, I mean the lusus naturae, or joke of nature, and the lusus scientiae, orjoke of knowledge, that populated the museums and sci- entific texts of the period.I The relation between the natural paradox oflusus and the scientific demonstrations and experiments that were also lusus points to the way in which the dynamic between art and nature and between collector and audience unfolded in the spectacle of science. "Nature hasjoked (lusit) uncommonly in all the outward appearances of natural things," declared the Danish physician Olaf Worm in the I651 catalogue of his museum.2 More generally, as an introduction to his monumental De plantis (I583), the Italian natu- ralist Cesalpino commented: "The wonderful wisdom . .. which governs and regulates the nature of the universe, and the incredible *Aspects of this paper were presented at the Northern Californian Renaissance Conference, San Francisco State, 1987, and at the History of Science Society and Brit- ish Society for the History of Science Anglo-American Conference, Manchester, En- gland, 1988.

It is important to note that the sixteenth- through eighteenth-century usage of "lusus" did not clearly distinguish between "lusus" proper, or intellectual play, and "ludus," or social play such as games. 2Worm, Museum Wormianum (Louvain, 1655), 8i.

"3 In- corporating phenomena as diverse and seemingly unrelated as flow- ers, shells, seahorses, fossils, giants, unicorns' horns, loadstones, and zoophytes, many Renaissance naturalists considered lusus nat- urae to be the key to an efficacious reading of the book of nature. Concommitantly lusus scientiae evidenced man's ability to match nature's complexity with his own artifice. Despite the wealth of evidence on this subject, it has been largely ignored or confined to the marginal notes of more mainstream top- ics. Most discussions of scientific jokes have focused solely on the jokes of nature, looking at them from the vantage point of the his- tory of geology and paleontology.4 The only sustained treatment of jokes of knowledge appears in the literature on anamorphic art. 5 But these two subjects represent only a tiny fragment of the numerous phenomena that were classified as playful. Thus we need to broaden our definition of lusus to understand fully its implications for early modern scientific discourse and to explicate the relation between sci- ence and poetics in the Renaissance. The multiplication of scientific jokes in the sixteenth and seven- teenth centuries provides an intriguing way to look at natural his- tory during this period. First, the direct relevance of classical thought to natural history, especially Aristotle, Ovid, and Pliny, will be addressed, as the origins of scientific playfulness are found in these authors. Second, a discussion of lusus allows us to investigate aspects of pre-Linnaean taxonomy, in particular the need for alter- native categories in classifying problematic phenomena, for lusus was frequently used as an anti-definition-a means of explaining something that would otherwise have been without explanation. Third, the social relevance ofjoking in early modern European cul- ture offers an opportunity briefly to investigate the development of an audience for science, to understand the dynamic between curi- osity and virtuosity which was central to the practice of science. 3Andrea Cesalpino, De plantis libri XVI (Florence, I583), sig. a.2. 4Nicoletta Morello, La nascita della paleontologia nel Seicento (Milan, 1979); Roy Por- ter, The Making of Geology (Cambridge, Eng., 1977); Paolo Rossi, The Dark Abyss of Time, trans.

Jokes are not self- evident; put in contemporary terms, they were an instance of the seemingly occult properties of nature made manifest through the discerning eye of the Renaissance naturalist. As such, lusus fre- quently distinguished more unusual phenomena from the quotid- ian. In other instances, it became an organizing principle that de- scribed the process of diversification in nature. Both definitions supported the notion that play could create order, that lusus naturae were in fact examples of the subtlety of nature's architecture and lusus scientiae evidence of man's mastery of this complexity. In treating these jokes, we therefore need to ask whether play can be considered an essential structure for scientific activity, and in general intellectual activity, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries - a structure that was as viable in the age of "scientific revolution" as the more rationalist approaches of Galileo and Descartes, who cer- tainly did not make a sport of their science.6 While playfulness has a long intellectual and philosophical tradi- tion, it was only fully activated in the sixteenth and seventeenth cen- turies. "Pythagoras, Socrates, and Plato had the habit of hiding all divine mysteries behind the veil of figurative language to protect their wisdom modestly from the Sophists' boastfulness, ofjoking seriously and playing assiduously, iocari serio et studiosissime ludere," wrote Marsilio Ficino in his Platonic commentaries.7 The human- ists' fascination with figurative language was borne out by the anal- ogies spun by natural philosophers, which held the fabric of their universe together. In keeping with the Renaissance tradition of serio ludere, as seen in More's Utopia and Erasmus' Praise of Folly, which dealt with the most serious political and theological subjects of the day by treating them with irony and humor, the late Renaissance naturalists framed their reading of nature through a similar process 6For discussions of play as an organizing principle, seeJohan Huizinga, Homo ludens (Boston, 1955), and Paul Feyerabend, Against Method (London, 1978). Also important to the specific argument that contrasts the Galilean and Cartesian approaches to a more playful science is Krzysztof Pomian, Collectionneurs, amateurs et curieux (Paris, 1987). I do not wish to imply that the more "mainstream" science of this period did not have its playful aspects. Indeed, Galileo's patronage strategies, particularly his involvement with the Lincean Academy in Rome, indicate that despite his theoretical rejection of this brand of science he did not fully exclude natura ludens from his own world. 7Ficino, Proem. in Platonis Parmenidem (Opera, 2: 1137), in Ioan P.

Scientific jokes clearly demonstrate the new role of ob- servation in early modern science, and what the naturalists and col- lectors of the period observed was playful. In this respect, joking can be characterized as a practice central to Renaissance science, for it ef- fectively connected the discourse on playfulness to the social expe- rience of the naturalist-collector.9 The historiography of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century sci- ence has, in recent years, produced a spate of works attacking the idea that science proper is a wholly rational process that emerged separately from and in opposition to late Renaissance natural phi- losophy. The corrective to the positivistic approach has set up as an alternative structure an occult tradition of science that co-existed with and flourished in the post-Copernican and Newtonian world. "The occult discourse is essentially symbolic," writes Brian Vick- ers. "In whatever discipline-astrology, alchemy, numerology, or magic-nature is significant not in itself but as a system of signs pointing to another system of mental categories."Io While Vickers' observations are certainly correct and explain well the system of meaning under which lusus, as a semantic category, was subsumed, he and many of the other scholars of the occult tradition continue to discuss the persistence of the "irrational" as an oppositional struc- ture, at odds with the process of modern science.

Rather than assuming that the traditional polarities set up within the study of science are constants, I wish to shade the meanings of"rational" and "irratio- nal," investigating the gradations of these categories. As a construct that drew on a wide range of discursive practices, lusus provides an interesting opening into the social, cultural, and philosophical sys- tems of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries -a way of unravel- ing the tangled webs of meaning that constituted science from the Renaissance to the Enlightenment. REDISCOVERING PLINY Before we go into any detail about the jokes themselves, a brief philological excursion is necessary. Where did the term lusus nat- urae originate and how did it evolve into its sixteenth- and seven- teenth-century forms? The classical world delighted in many forms of play: competitions, public spectacles, games of chance, games of love, jokes of language, jokes of knowledge, and of coursejokes of nature were all encompassed within this one world. The most ob- vious starting point for our purposes, however, is Pliny's Natural History. In this encyclopedic work, lusus and other variants ofludere appeared several times. Discussing the endless possibilities of hu- man physiognomy, Pliny stated: "Nature, in her ingenuity, has cre- ated all these marvels in the human race, with others of a similar na- ture, as so many amusements to herself (ludibria sibi), though they appear miraculous to us." In other chapters, Pliny singled out shell- fish and flowers as examples of nature's "sportive mood" due to the variety of their shapes and colors. I2 "Pliny, Natural History, trans.

I have used Bostock and Riley's translation throughout and cite the most relevant parts of the Latin from the Loeb ed. of Pliny's Natural History, trans. H. Rackham (Cambridge, MA, 1938): "Haec atque talia ex hominum genere ludibria sibi, nobis miracula, ingeniose fecit natura" (I: 526); "Fir- mioris iam testae murices et concharum genera, in quibus magna ludentis naturae va- rietas" (3: 230); "In hortis seri et coronamenta iussit Cato, inenarrabili florum maxime subtilitate, quando nulli potest facilius esse loqui quam rerum naturae pingere, lascivi- enti praesertim et in magno gaudio fertilitatis tam variae ludenti" (6: 160). 296</page><page sequence="6">JOKES OF NATURE AND JOKES OF KNOWLEDGE Not surprisingly, Renaissance terminology was greatly indebted to Pliny's use oflusus. The humanists' interest in Pliny was as much for the breadth of his vocabulary as for his history; his emphasis on nature's playfulness corresponded with their own conception of a plenitudinous universe. I3 The passages from the Natural History re- ferring specifically to lusus naturae appeared frequently in the works of naturalists as diverse as Ulisse Aldrovandi, Guillaume Rondelet, Conrad Gesner, Girolamo Cardano, Levinus Lemnius, and Filippo Bonanni. 4 Aside from the precise acknowledgement of Pliny, his philosophy of nature was generally evident in the language of nat- ural history during this time. "So Mysterious is Mother Nature!" exclaimed George Caspar Kirchmayer. "Thus do the greatest curi- osities lie hid in the smallest facts."Is The post-classical conception oflusus also subsumed Pliny's no- tion of the painting of nature. "So great is the variety [of shells]," wrote Filippo Bonanni, "that one can say that which Pliny said of flowers, nullifacilius est loqui, quam rerum Natura pingere. "I6 As a eu- phemism that reflected the breadth of nature's imagination, the im- age of natura pictrix expressed nature's ability to diversify; in this fashion she added color and shape to the world outlined by God. More specifically, the concept described images made by chance- seemingly random examples of nature's ability to be both artist and canvas.'7 Ulisse Aldrovandi's Musaeum Metallicum, for example, was filled with instances of nature'sjoking in this fashion: stones re- sembling humari appendages as well as ones containing crosses, '3Charles G.

I8 Describing an unusual stone in his museum, the Veronese collector Lodovico Moscardo underlined its painted quality: "In this stone . one sees nature joke with art, since in it she reveals many lines that form the shape of trees, houses, and countrysides, as if the learned hand of a famous painter had sketched them. "I9 From this perspective, the naturalists perceived lusus to be nature's recreation; by diversifying herself in unusual and surprising ways she escaped from the weariness of her more mundane tasks, turning the process of creation into an aesthetic experience whose lusus was played out in the challenge its artifice gave to art itself. Examples of nature painting herself also featured prominently in the Jesuit scientific enterprise. The polymath Athanasius Kircher, founder of the museum at the Collegio Romano, particularly ad- vised his readers: "in a certain marble-like stone you may see cities, mountains, and clouds painted. In this fashion there is [an image of] a turreted city, complete with houses provided with windows, in my museum. ..." For Kircher and his disciples Gaspar Schott and Filippo Bonanni, such images were iconographic displays of the word of God which, on a scholarly level, mirrored the popular fas- cination with prodigies as portents. "If a natural effect may be pro- duced by art," wrote Kircher, "then in this display nature is taught by art to reveal" (fig. I).20 Both Kircher and Bonanni expanded nature's ability to paint to include the geometry of her creations, perhaps in response to their fear of her more chaotic potential and of certain philosophical ten- dencies that emphasized this disorder. By adding the play of shapes and proportions to the more general definition of lusus as variety, theJesuits expanded its importance, transforming it into an essential structure for natural philosophy. Comparing mathematics to the study of nature in his Arithmologia (I665), Kircher suggested: "And numerical nature plays in the exact same way with crystal, topaz, amethyst, and other precious stones, some of which Nature has composed as triangles, others as tetrahedrons, and still others as '8Aldrovandi, Musaeum Metallicum (Bologna, 1648), 480, 488, 528.

In the age ofpost-Tridentine reform, it was hardly surprising that Catholic scholars, writing from within the Church, would empha- size nature's capacity to organize rather than present herjokes as ex- amples of her willful independence from any higher order. While ac- cepting Plinian natural philosophy on the whole, theJesuits rejected Pliny's insistence on chance as the ultimate creative force in the mak- ing of lusus naturae. Bonanni, for example, attacked the atomistic explanation of the formation of matter, which emphasized the ran- domness of nature's playful creations. Hypothetically imagining the laughter of Democritus at the sight of the Jesuit's vast shell collec- tion, "showing himself to be a bad philosopher and no Catholic, by giving no credit to things insignificant in appearance," Bonanni re- affirmed the centrality of detail to his own natural history.22 Unlike the sixteenth-century naturalists, who perpetuated Pliny's humanistic definition of lusus as variety, the seventeenth- century writers strove to reveal nature's architecture. Perhaps the most literal application of the seriousness of nature's hidden struc- ture appeared in Kircher's Diatribe deprodigiosis crucibus (I66I). Here the microscope became an instrument of religious as well as scien- tific revelation, for its magnifying powers allowed the viewer to dis- cern more easily crosses formed naturally in fruit, rather than using the naked eye.23 In fact it seemed that nature had left her brush- strokes everywhere, if only one looked closely enough. As humorous as it may seem to us to imagine a large proportion of the scientific community peering through technology's latest wonder to discern the pattern that God had left behind in his natural productions, the search for symbols in all parts of the natural world par.ticipated in a complex system of meaning central to late Renais- sance culture. The idea of the "serious joke" (ioco-serio), a term re- appearing constantly in the literature of scientific paradox, suc- cinctly sums up the ability of seventeenth-century discourse to 2"Kircher, Arithmologia (Rome, I665), 282. 22Bonanni, i68I, 31-32. 23Kircher, Diatribe de prodigiosis crucibus (Rome, 166I), 60.

The notion of the scientific joke, particularly in the hands of the Jesuits, who at times seemed to specialize in nothing but this sort of scientific sophistry, became a didactic tool that organized nature from her smallest to her largest creatures, well beyond Pliny's more amorphous interpretation of res mirabilia. By incorporating the me- dieval vocabulary of illusion, which conjured up the lusa diabolica,25 the seventeenth-century naturalists developed a category expansive enough to include the wonders of nature alongside the greater works of God and the artificial creations of man. While this is only one of the many examples that could be offered to illustrate the dynamic properties of the language with which the sixteenth- and seven- teenth-century naturalists discussed thejokes of nature, nonetheless it should sufficiently demonstrate that while nature certainly played from antiquity to the eighteenth century, she did not always play in the same way at any given time. DE SUBTILITATE Having surveyed some aspects of the vocabulary of scientific jokes, let us now turn to the place of several lusus in late Renaissance cosmology. Did nature joke more in one place than another? In a chapter on fish, Pliny hypothesized: "the vulgar notion may very possibly be true, that whatever is produced in any other department of Nature, is to be found in the sea as well; while at the same time, many other productions are there to be found which nowhere else exist."26 Like the mineral world that produced fossils, the sea also housed innumerable jokes, particularly because so many species of 24At the end of his "Oratio de Lusibus Magnae Rerum Parentis Naturae," presented to the faculty at Altdorf in I605, Michael Piccanto Franco concluded: "Hoc auditores modo Natura ludit; sed ita tamen ludit ut seriis non desit. Desinamus igitur &amp; nos lu- dere adeoque eo veniamus, cuius potissimum rei causa convenimus." In Caspar Dor- navius, Amphitheatrum sapientiae socraticae joco-seriae (Hannover, I619), 184. 25See Du Cange (n. I) for the medieval definitions of"ludere." The definition of illusion in the OED (5: 48-49), also points out that this word was not in use until the late Middle Ages. Regarding proscriptions against curiosity, see Jean Ceard, La curiosite' a la Renaissance (Paris, 1986), II5, and Krzysztof Pomian, "Collection- microcosme et la culture de la curiosit6," in Scienze, credenze, occulte, livelli di cultura (Florence, 1982), 535-57. 26Pliny, 2: 358-59 (IX.I). 30I</page><page sequence="11">RENAISSANCE QUARTERLY marine life defied strict classification in one kingdom or another. Was coral plant or mineral? Was the hydra animal or plant? Few six- teenth- and seventeenth-century naturalists pretended to have de- finitive answers to these paradoxes of classification. Instead the much simpler, and philosophically satisfying, solution was to intro- duce these problematic phenomena into the ever-flexible category oflusus. According to classical lore, the sea's extreme fecundity derived from its warmth; in Aristotelian teleology this added heat facilitated the production of new and diverse phenomena.27 The sixteenth- century natural philosopher Girolamo Cardano echoed Pliny's sen- timents in his De rerum varietate (I 557): "In plants and in trees, nature is varied, but she is most diverse in those [creations] which originate in the sea, or at least in a place near the water. . . .28 Surely this elab- oration of the sea's procreative powers explains the popularity of wonderous trees in the natural lore of the day which, due to their proximity to water, engendered birds out of shells growing from the branches.29 In Cardano's terms, sea creations like the hydra, coral, pearls, and the nautilus exhibited the subtilitas that equated power and order with diversity. Discussing another classic Plinianjoke in his De sub- tilitate, Cardano queried: "why, when nature has joked so variously in flowers, nonetheless did she produce neither green nor black ones?"30 Obviously a further distinction needs to be made between the jokes of nature which exhibited a deficient sort of variety through the absence of probable combinations that the natural phi- losopher could induce hypothetically and those lusus whose expan- siveness surpassed the intellectual powers of the naturalists who classified them. In a universe that operated on the concept of plen- itude, quantity was equally as important as quality; to merit sublim- ity, a joke needed to meet both of these criteria. At first instance, lusus subsumed particularly rich elements of the quotidian such as flowers and shells. Things unexplainable by or- 27An example of the continuation of this myth in the sixteenth-century occurs in Lesserees de Guillaume Bouchet (1584-98), ed. C. E.

Such phenomena were neither transparent nor potentially diabolical or catastrophic in their pecularity. Instead, their difference exemplified the "irregular reg- ularity" with which nature confounded her observers.3I As such they provided benign fulfillment of the heightened curiosity about nature's secrets. "It is the majesty of Nature which cultivates human curiosity," noted Gaspar Schott. 32 One example of this more ordi- nary sort of scientific playfulness was the birth of a gigantic cabbage in a hospital garden in Nuremberg in 1697. As a scherzo di natura, it merited an article in the Galleria di Minerva that year. This cabbage "is privileged in the natural order, because it is not according to the usual laws of nature. Though it shares its major features in common with others of its species, [it has] a large and notty stem: thirty-four massive heads of cabbage resulted from it."33 The best example of this sort of playfulness was the category of zoophyte in late Renaissance taxonomy. Central to the claim of the sea's fecundity, it also applied to a variety of"plant-animals" on land as well. One of the most fanciful and elaborate zoophytes that puz- zled naturalists was the Scythian lamb (fig. 2). Described by Scaliger as a superior ludum and by Claude Duret as a "true zoophyte," this creature consisted of the body of a lamb rooted to the ground by a stem, and reportedly survived by eating the grass around it. 34 Al- though often skeptical about the veracity of this prodigious creation, many naturalists nonetheless reported its existence. As one contem- porary observed, "Indeed if Nature playfully brings forth the monk fish, affecting an imitation in the sea, why might she not give birth to a lamb in a row ofplants?"35 The theoretical existence of fantastic zoophytes in distant lands, like the Scythian lamb, was constantly reaffirmed by the very real presence of more mundane phenomena that also crossed and confused these boundaries.

Its sexual ambiguity, as seen first in the debates overs its ability to generate spontaneously and later in the discovery of its her- maphroditism, was a physiological manifestation of the occult properties of ludere and of nature's ability to threaten man's rigid perceptions of normality and abnormality. In the first instance, the spontaneous generation of snails, an Ar- istotelian dictum defended by Bonanni as late as the early eighteenth century, was perceived to be a physical metaphor for the mystery of creation. Not only was the snail playful in its outer appearance, its shell, but also in its internal organization. Delightfully, for the eigh- teenth-century naturalists, the lens of the microscope and the tools of dissection revealed that the snail's true generative powers were no less complex. "But the most surprising Circumstance that attends these Creatures, is this," instructed Noel Antoine Pluche; "they are all Hermaphrodites, and have the two Sexes united in them; so that each of them gives to the other that Fecundity which, at the same time is communicated to itself. "38 The seemingly occult joke of one century had become a trope of fecundity in the next. Discussing some form of stones in oxen, Lorenzo Legati, cata- loguer of the Cospi Museum in Bologna, clearly distinguished them from prodigies or markedly unique phenomena. "Thus nature jokes," he hypothesized, "in this manner making it seem that oxen lay eggs." Like the sexuality of the snail, the apparent signs of female fertility in oxen rendered them biologically problematic. Here a double entendre can be discerned, for stones unto themselves might be classified as lusus -the presence of the mineral world within the animal one-and the purposeful confusion of this sport of nature for 36The best discussion of taxonomy during this period is M.

In all instances, what separated the jokes from the marvelous or the prodigious was the regularity with which they occurred. Elab- orating on his discussion of "Diverse Oxen's Eggs, as Cardano called them, " Legati added: "These are only monstrous in name, not being outside the order of Nature in their fabrication. And more use- fully they would be called Balls or Globes, having no other similar- ity with Eggs than their shape. .. ."39 The snail would always be hermaphroditical, the chameleon would always change colors, "just as an actor puts on a mask,"40 and this predictability differen- tiated them, say, from Siamese twins or two-headed calves whose appearance was truly unheralded. Given their regularity, what made thejokes of nature unusual? As Legati's description of the monstrous eggs suggests, all lusus shared the quality of illusion. More or less, they fit Cardano's definition of the third, and most common, type of secret which "was known to many, but nevertheless without evident cause. "4I Thus the natural- ist, as purveyor of such secrets, held the key to the system of nature through knowledge of its subtlety. "The shell Aura Marina is formed in the likeness of an ear," re- ported one collector of scientificjokes. Explaining the nomenclature of articulated coral, the same naturalist noted, "in its joints it seems to want to imitate animal bone. "42 In categorizing nature's subtlety, lusus was not merely an alternative category, created in opposition to the more normal taxonomic principles of the day. Rather it in- corporated the important organizing principle ofhomology, such a central feature of pre-Linnaean taxonomy, through its recognition and concommitant naming of parallel structures in diverse organisms.43 Its crystallization as a category that clarified the rela- 39Legati, 20-2I.

Renaissance natural history fabricated categories that purpose- fully demonstrated the permeability of the boundaries among king- doms, challenging the ability of the naturalists to taxonomize their world. A particularly interesting demonstration of nature's illusive qualities concerned the controversy over the existence of giants. The museums and cabinets of curiosity in early modern Europe abounded with examples of this instance of nature's largesse. "I con- fess," wrote Thomas Molyneux, "there is hardly a considerable col- lection of this kind, or a printed description of a Musaeum extant, where some part or other of a Giant is not to be met with."44 The lusus of giants lay not only in the quality of seeming, that is, in the animal bones that seemed human or at times were simply mineral formations in the shape of a human appendage; thejoke was a trope of proportion as well. For those who believed in giants, the play of nature was worked out in their grandeur. "Here there are jokes of nature, as marvellous in the smallest things as in the largest of her productions," remarked Cardano (fig. 3).45 The specific controversies over the existence of giants have been well discussed byJean Ceard and Antoine Schnapper, so I shall not repeat the details here. What concerns us is the paradox of classifi- cation which these arguments engendered. For if giants did not ex- ist, as many critics argued, then what was the provenance of such inexplicably large remains? Regarding the furor over the remains of a Teutonic king uncov- ered in France in 1613, the acerbic spokesman for the Parisian med- ical community, Jean Riolan the Younger, preferred the explanation (Rome, 1987). For a review of recent literature on this subject, see Paula Findlen, "Empty Signs? Reading the Book of Nature in Renaissance Science," Studies in the His- tory and Philosophy of Science, forthcoming. 44Molyneux, "An Essay Concerning Giants," Philosophical Transactions 22 (1700): 489.

He and many of his contemporaries who advocated this form of the lusus explanation simply transferred the Plinian notion of the sea's fecundity to the earth by pointing out that the play of fossils was much more diverse and perplexing than that of the sea.46 Once again the innocent jokes of nature were confounding the scientific com- munity. The illusive nature of unicorn's horns, also a popular item in the naturalist's repertoire, strengthened the interpretation of giant's bones as fossil plays. In his De unicornu (1645), the Danish physician Thomas Bartholin described an example of Homo Monocerotus (half man, halfunicorn) as an instance in which Natura lusit. 47 Besides uni- corn's horns, the other obvious analogy to the place of giants lay in the perception of pygmies. The classical explanation of this example of nature's deficiency also revolved around the quality of seeming. Galen "judges pygmies to be a certain species of apes," wrote Con- rad Gesner, "not men, but with a shape and erect stature similar to men ..." 48 While the ancient perception of pygmies occasionally reinforced the arguments against the existence of giants, the pres- ence of diminutive men in the courts and museums more often was cited as evidence that giants had their place among nature's cre- ations. The famous naturalist Ulisse Aldrovandi collected broad- sheets depicting contemporary dwarves, and the museum of the senator Ferdinando Cospi in seventeenth-century Bologna em- ployed a dwarf as both exhibitor and exhibit-a specific example of the facility with which the practice ofjoking moved easily from the intellectual to the social realm.49 "Among the other worthy and notable particulars that are conserved in our museum," wrote Francesco Imperato, son of the Neapolitan apothecary Ferrante, "is a small pygmy, a little less than a span in height."50 The physical presence of the stuffed body, preserved for the anthropological delectation of visitors to his museum, served to remind its viewers that such things did exist, and that if nature saw fit to create tiny 46Riolan, Gigantomachie pour respondre a la Gigantostologie (Paris, I613); Ceard, 1978, 74-75.

"Similarly why indeed might [man] not be given to deficiency, especially given the excessive magnitude of Giants?", queried Cas- par Bartholin in his Depygmaeis (I628). 5 To be effective, the trope of proportion had to operate in both directions. Subtilitas was not only found in the delicate and minute intricacy of nature's smallest beings; rather it was the web of elaborate and harmonious relation- ships between smallest and largest, between ordinary and extraor- dinary, that forged the intricacy of sixteenth- and seventeenth-cen- tury taxonomy. METAMORPHOSIS AND MIMESIS Returning to the classical canons that gave play a central role in scientific discourse, let us consider the role of Ovid's Metamorphoses. Ovid held a particularly important place in all aspects of Renaissance thought. From the numerous editions, translations, and imitations of his poetry to the artistic renderings of his tales which appeared in cycles as noteworthy as those decorating the studiolo of Francesco I de' Medici and in gardens and grottoes, encapsulating the perpetual tension between nature and art, Ovidian imagery was a powerful presence in the Renaissance imagination.52 The fascination with Ovid makes evident the centrality of fables to all aspects of Renais- sance culture, including science. Aldrovandi, for example, included fabulae as an important category of description for any natural ob- ject, and he even made a pilgrimage to the location of Ovid's house to pay homage to the poet. 3 Thus the place oflusus in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century science underscored its poetic construction. Only once in his work did Ovid explicitly use ludere with the same connotation that Pliny gave it. More influential, however, was his image of metamorphosis. At one point in the fifteenth metamor- phosis, Pythagoras reflected: "Nor does anything retain its own ap- pearance permanently. Ever-inventive nature continually produces one shape from another. Nothing in the entire universe ever per- 51Bartholin, Opuscula quatuor singularia (Hafniae, I628), IO, 19. S5The literature on this topic is enormous.

"54 The nat- ural history of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries abounded with such transformations, for the most part lifted directly from Ar- istotle, Ovid, and Pliny. Paraphrasing Kircher, Gioseffo Petrucci explained: "The works of Nature are prodigious. Whoever does not penetrate the reasons behind them, imagining it to be impossible, does not believe in them. . . . Do not doubt that the most extrav- agant Metamorphoses that we hear of occurring at all hours in lands distant from our own are jokes [scherzi] of ingenious Nature."55 Certain naturalists seemed to make the observation of these trans- formations their specialty. The best illustration of Ovid's influence is undoubtedly Giovan Battista Della Porta's Magia naturalis (I 5 58). Here horses engendered wasps, mules drones, and red toads arose from dirt and menstrual blood. 56 It appeared that nature was con- stantly in flux, always in the process of becoming something else. The most frequently cited passage from Ovid regarding the or- igins of nature's transformative powers concerned the tale ofPerseus and the Medusa's head. After saving Andromeda, Perseus hid the head among the weeds to protect people from its terrible power: The freshly gathered weed, still living and absorbent, drew into itself the power of the monster; hardening at the touch of the head, it acquired a strange new rigidity in its leaves and branches. The sea nymphs tested this miracle, try- ing it on several twigs, and were delighted to find the same thing happening again. By scattering seeds from these plants over the waves, they produced more of this substance. Even today coral retains this same nature, hardening at the touch of air: that which was a plant when under water becomes rock when brought above the surface. 57 Describing the coral displayed in the museum of the Veronese apothecary Francesco Calzolari, Benedetto Ceruti used this tale to explain the plant's transformation. Ovid's fictive device served to explain scientific fact. "We have our own Gorgons," advised Paolo Terzago of Manfredo Settala's museum in Milan. "If you wish to 54Referring to the arrival of spring, Ovid mused: "Everything then is in flower, the fertile earth plays [ludit] with brightly colored flowers" (XV, 204-05).

Appropri- ately Aldrovandi explained the etymology of pietra gorgonia as a name for coral "because the poets pretend that the Gorgons trans- formed themselves into stone. "58 Drawing on another passage from Ovid, in which the urine of lynxes turned to stone, JohnJonstone wrote ofjuices that calcified: "Nature hath wonderfully sported herself in them, sometimes it hardens before it touch the ground and sometime when it is fallen down."59 Truly at times we must wonder whether or not the nat- uralists drew on Aesop as well as Ovid, ironicizing the concept of metamorphoses by pointing out that they did not always turn out well!6o The last element of my brief lexicography concerns the relation between lusus and mimesis. Yet another aspect of the joke's possi- bilities was its ability to imitate and transform. In scientific terms, this definition had two applications. The first, cast in the Ovidian and Plinian modes, concerned thejoke of nature. The importance of mirror images in Greek thought, particularly the notion that sim- ilarity produced a magical bond between two objects, must certainly be the origins of this relation.61 Yet we also need to consider the tale of Narcissus who, looking into the pool of water, was "excited by the very illusion that deceived his eyes. "62 As Agrippa described na- ture's mimetic propensities in his De occultaphilosophia (I 533): "The world is the image of God, man the image of the world, animals that of man, plant life that of animals, metals that of plant life, and stones that of metals. "63 More specifically, the French surgeon Ambroise Pare directly related lusus and mimesis in his popular treatise Des monstres etprodiges (1573), remarking: "one sees in rocks and plants 58Ceruti and Chiocco, 5, Io; BUB, Aldrovandi, MS I43, V, c.332.

"64 While the idea of nature unfolding herself could be applied to a variety of phenomena, it was most precisely delineated in the dis- course concerning fossils and generally in the ability of the mineral kingdom to serve as a repository of the images extant in the other two kingdoms. Although a growing number of naturalists had their suspicions about the inorganic nature of fossils by the end of the sev- enteenth century- "nature neitherjokes nor imitates but makes real and perfect minerals," observed one critic -during this period they were usually classified as spontaneously generated mineral forma- tions on which the book of nature was writ, just as Aristotle had suggested.65 Describing an armarium filled with figured stones (Lapides IAIOMOPPOI) in the sixteenth-century Vatican miner- ological collection, its keeper Michele Mercati noted: "The plays of nature are united here, almost as a likeness in stone of living things, shaped by no other assistant than the innocent joke of nature. "66 Similarly prized by collectors of rare horticulture were the flow- ers that assumed various shapes. In a description of an anthropomor- phic orchid found in the Roman College museum, Gaspar Schott conveyed the sense of wonder that the viewing of such exotica pro- duced: "Whoever examines the figures or rather the signatures of this plant, impressed in many flowers, frequently is rightfully amazed at the power or rather zealousness of nature in her produc- tions. Thus nature has joked (lusit), imprinting a human figure in some of them."67 Nature, in this conception, was cast as Narcis- sus - forever looking at herself in the mirror that the juxtaposition of the three kingdoms provided. On a more abstract level, the increased interest in physiognomy during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, as seen in the pop- ularity of Della Porta's De humana physiognomia (I586), can be viewed as the sublime example of the obsession with nature's pro- 64Pare, On Monsters and Marvels, trans.

In the study of signs in the human body, the body itself became a repository of all the images of the natural-and fre- quently the unnatural- world, as Pliny had initially suggested (fig. 4). Elaborating on the analogies between macrocosm and micro- cosm, Kircher described the play of nature on the earth "just as eter- nal Wisdom has played with the fabric of the human body. "68 Just as nature imitated man, from the apes that "imitate the form, effigy, and human gestures" to the anthropomorphic bits of flora and fauna, man himself mimicked nature.69 In a remarkable passage ofLaurentJoubert's Traite du ris (1579), the ability of man to apply nature's transformative powers to himself was delineated: It is written that a barbarian, when asked what he thought was the most re- markable thing in this theatre of the world, answered (not as a barbarian but as a wise person) that man surpassed completely all capacity of admiration. For he is not only prince among the animals, and of a divine splendor by virtue of his reason and understanding, interpretor of all Nature, but also of the nature of a Proteus, or of a chameleon; of a frail and unsteady strength, he transforms himself into everything he wishes again and again. This is found to be very true when one observes that the mind's vehement movements dissolve and undo the body, just as devil-fish and polyps change their diverse colors at every oc- casion, according to their surroundings.70 The mirror of nature worked both ways. Not only did the lower cre- ations serve as repositories of the higher ones in the great chain of being, but man, the most perfect of all natural creations, became the ultimate lusus. THE ILLUSIONS AND DELUSIONS OF SCIENCE As has been extensively discussed in the art historical literature, the notion of nature as her own transforming agent had its parallel in the ability of man to imitate or recast nature. 7 Nature did not only produce her own metamorphoses and mimeses; she also could be re- shaped and recreated in the laboratory.

(I would like to thank her for confirming this for me). Despite its absence, it is a particularly apt way of summing up this aspect of scientific play, especially since a variety of experiments were frequently described as "lusus" or "ludi," and many of the artificial devices constructed to mimic or contort nature, particularly in gardens or grottoes, were called "giuochi." 314</page><page sequence="24">0 nTi 0 z Til z 0 nTi 0 z 0 nTi 0 nil FIG. 4-Similarities.

"A curious thing has just accidentally happened to me," wrote Francesco Carli in a hasty postscript to the Jesuit Kircher. While performing an experiment to produce talcum, Carli had left a residue of the mixture in a glass vial, after transferring the compound to another container; "the next day I found the res- idue condensed into many figures, each representing a living flower," explained Carli. Kircher, in turn, responded: "Before the second of the current month, I received your most learned letter, and with it the marvellous experiment (esperienza) of the distilled tal- cum-effects which demonstrate how playful nature is (quanto scherzevole la Natura) more than they bring honor to you. And if my studies allow me enough leisure to try this experiment, I wish to see it for myself."72 Not unlike something that might appear today in theJournal oflrreproducible Results, thejokes of knowledge complex- ified the Ovidian and Plinian implications of ludere. Their variety was not found in nature but derived from it. On the most basic level, man's ability to play mimicked nature's own instincts. "Whoever imitates, does he not make ajoke of sorts? So says Plato in his tenth law. "73 Should it surprise us that this com- ment was made in the context of a discussion of Giuseppe Arcim- boldo's paintings, the creator of fantastic visions of nature and art at the court of RudolfII in Prague? The penchant for arcimboldesques- monstrous and artificial physiognomies as one contemporary illus- tration labelled them (fig. 5)-in the sixteenth and seventeenth cen- turies provides ample evidence of the expansion of nature's metamorphic potential. Water, for example, removed from its nat- ural context to the painted canvas, became a compendium of its parts, the sum of which produced a human face whose physiog- nomy, or rather readability, defied even Della Porta's complex cat- egories. 72Pontificia Universita Gregoriana (hereafter PUG), Kircher, MS 564 (X), f I04 (Carli to Kircher, Verona, IO September 1668); f I 13 (Kircher to Carli, Rome, 4 Feb- ruary 1669). 73Gregorio Comanini, II Figino overo della fine della pittura (I 59I), in Trattati dell'arte del Cinquecento, ed.

"75 The use of lusus naturae, as shells certainly were, to create a lusus sci- entiae that was an image of the ultimate lusus, man, set in motion a chain of operations that playfully inverted (or even subverted) na- ture's ability to mimic and ultimately transform herself. While the eighteenth-century naturalists classified this particular form of lusus as an aesthetic rather than a scientificjoke, Renaissance virtuosi incorporated both components of playfulness into a larger philo- sophical framework. Besides the jokes that perpetuated the variety found in nature, there were also many that added to it. Many museums offered pur- ported examples of"real" giant's bones, unicorns' horns, or the fa- mous basilisk, a lizard of legendary ferocity. On one level, the phys- ical existence of these legendary creatures, whose presence in a collection was considered proof of their authenticity, was designed to fulfill the variety of nature which the classical literature promised. Equally, the renowned many-headed hydra or the imaginary fish created by Spallanzani in his eighteenth-century natural history col- lection served as more ironic comments on the obsession with rarity during this period.76 On a trip to Modena in I664, the English vir- tuoso Philip Skippon visited the ducal palace where he was given a 74A particularly popular item was the figurine of a man made out of shells.

He particularly noted the presence of: "A Hydra with seven heads, the middlemost of which was biggest, and had two canine teeth, and six little ones between, a long tail, two feet, with four claws on each, and five rows of tubercles on his back. ... Very probably this Hydra was fictitious, the head being like that ofa fichet, or of that kind, the body and feet were of a rabbet or hare, and the tail was made of common snake's skin, the back and neck covered with the same. "77 Forged of many parts of various an- imals, such spectacles prefigured Barnum's mermaid. They invited the viewer either to participate in the joke, by understanding the subtle transition from natural to artificial, or to be deceived by it and, in a sense, to become the joke himself. But the practice ofjoking was not simply about taxonomy. It also entered the theatrical world of scientific demonstration and exper- iment, where illusion and delusion were bywords. In the prologue to his Magia universalis (1657), Gaspar Schott warned his readers: "Here the theater where art and nature play is exposed to curiosity: but while they play for the learned, they deceive (illudunt) the ignorant."78 Deception was a particularly important feature of the lusus scientiae; play and illusion were never very far apart, both lin- guistically and practically. Upon seeing the EnglishJesuit college in Antwerp in 1663, Skippon remarked, "In their Officinapharmaceutica we observed curious shells, and many artificial imitations of nature."79 Books of secrets like Alexis of Piedmont's Secreti (1555) and Della Porta's Magia naturalis (1558), such an important part of the diffusion of scientific knowledge in the sixteenth and seven- teenth centuries, were filled with recipes that advised their readers on the counterfeiting of nature, and all of the objects present in the Renaissance museums invited the viewer to authenticate their verity as well as their rarity.8° While on a popular level, the illusory qualities of scientific play were classified as charlatanism, the more scholarly play of the vir- tuosi increasingly became a central feature of scientific activity. "I shall not pass by a merry conceit of the loadstone," wrote Della 77Skippon, "A Journey through part of the Low Countries, Germany, Italy and France," in A Collection of Voyages and Travels, ed.

Suggested experiments included the creation ofa ouija board by put- ting a wooden figurine in a rowboat in the middle of a container of water, surrounded by the letters of the alphabet. Through the ma- nipulation of a magnet, the rowboat mysteriously spelled out words to the amazement and delight of the audience. Another popular item involved a sheet of paper with a piece of metal attached to the back. When placed against a wall, behind which a boy with a magnet was hidden, the paper unfathomably moved on its own.8I "Did you not see how miraculous the play of the elements would be?," exclaimed Kircher in an elaboration of his theory of universal magnetism.82 And indeed the scientific ludi dreamed up by the natural philoso- phers prefigured the more spectacular demonstrations of electricity, those "physical and magnetic recreations" that populated eigh- teenth-century science.83 The games of knowledge unfolded in several different stages. First was the remystification or masking of natural phenomena through artificial devices; second, the presentation of the game through demonstration; and third, the repeatability of the play for the initiated which the textbook explanations of these academic rid- dles offered. The jokes of knowledge did not have a purely social function, though their preponderance was no doubt due to the pop- ularity such demonstrations and puzzles enjoyed in the courts, uni- versities, and academies of early modern Europe. Rather, they pro- vided the perfect mixture ofdocere and delectare, for they taught and amused simultaneously. 84 "For several days I have had a public demonstration of the im- possibility of motus perpetui artificialis," wrote Gaspar Schott to Kircher.85 The experimental work of the seventeenth-century Je- suits at times drew heavily on the experimental tradition laid out in the books of secrets. They too offered their audience a chance to play on its own, to practice the paradoxes and metamorphoses so lavishly 8'Della Porta, 1957, 204-05. 82Kircher, Magneticum naturae regnum sive disceptatio physiologica (Amsterdam, 1667), 47. 83John L.

"The marvels that you deigned to show me in your most curious gallery, Father .. ," wrote Filippo Sbarra after a visit to the museum at the Collegio Romano, "have led me to sub- mit to your criticism some of my inventions, which I have worked on as a diversion from domestic cares."86 Describing his own col- lection of human stones, Kircher suggested to his readers a formula for creating their own lusus: one needed only to fill ajar with urine and wait for it to calcify. On the less mundane side, compression ex- periments in a glass tube in which "the various spectacles of the plays of nature ... are exhibited" were also popular items in the Jesuit repertoire.87 Performed before an amazed and appreciative audi- ence, experimental play revealed a human subtilitas that scientific showmanship demanded. The optical work of theJesuits combined ludere and illudere with the greatest sophistication. Like Cardano and Della Porta, they were fascinated by magic lanterns, distorting mirrors, and other forms of optical illusions. Narcissus no longer looked into the mirror and saw simply himself; rather, as Kircher suggested, the mirror told him "that man can be transmuted into any possible form." Was this not a fulfillment of the taxonomic principle upon which Della Porta had based his Dephysiognomia ? One looked into an ordinary mirror and saw only the mask of humanity. But a distorting mirror revealed one's true self: "For had you looked into the mirror when it was up- right, you would have seen your face changed into the head of a crane with a great long neck. If you inspected it [closer], like the flooding of a dike, similarly you would make a rhinocerus' horn grow out of the front of your head. ... In a word, no monstrous thing is so deformed, that you might not adorn yourself with a sim- ilarly formed shape by gazing at yourself in the mirror." In this re- spect, the games of distortion were emblems of moral truth. One looked in the mirror, never knowing what sort of phantasm might emerge. The mirrors also distinguished one's ability to read a joke, to get the trick. As Kircher described in his Ars magna (1761), "Many of the unlearned were fooled by the phantasm of each Catoptricus. As long as their eyes cannot discern the outward appearance of the 86PUG, Kircher, MS 564 (X), f.ISo (Sbarra to Kircher, Rome, I9 July 1667). 87Kircher, 1677, 2: 52-53; see also Schott, loco-seriorum naturae et artis, sive magiae naturalis centuriae tres (Wurzburg, 1677), 43; Kircher, Physiologia Kircheriana Experimen- talis (Amsterdam, I680), I49. 321</page><page sequence="31">RENAISSANCE QUARTERLY things shown, they investigate [them] with palpitating hands, not without causing laughter, so wonderfully does the work of the Catoptricus elude the vision of the eyes."88 Pietro Scarabelli described Manfredo Settala's collection of opti- cal illusions-filled with "a thousand playful deceits"--as a means of transforming images with extravagant diversity: "From this mir- ror Democritus would have no less reason to laugh than Heraclitus to cry, for together they laugh and cry at the monstrous inconstancy of the human condition, of which Ovid would laugh: Nihil est, toto quod potest in orbe Cunctafluunt, omnisq; vagansformatur imago." Thus the scientific playfulness of mirrors was a conscious attempt to rewrite the fable of Narcissus, blending "poetic fiction" and scien- tific fact. 89 It was a short step from the creation of artificial metamorphoses, plays that reproduced transformations found in nature, to the inven- tion of anamorphoses, distortions of the mind that produced super- natural effects in the literal sense of the word. The anamorphic art of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, if not created by the Je- suits, was fostered by their passion for it. The works of Kircher, Schott, Mario Bettini, andJean-Franqois Niceron were filled with examples of tricks of perspective. In fact, the term anamorphosis first appeared in Schott's Magia universalis. 9 The anamorphoses par- alleled the optical tricks we havejust discussed. In the first instance, the mirror itself transformed and distorted the regular form pre- sented in front of it, just as the "mirrors" between each kingdom transformed phenomena in the translation from one kingdom to an- other. In the latter instance, the mirror or particular point ofperspec- tive made the already distorted image clear and transparent. Describing the process of anamorphosis, the creators of this "se- cret" of perspective made it clear that they were aware of the limits that they had surpassed.

For those who work in them usually create masks, statues, satyrs, or other grotesque figures made of shells, using their natural color and configu- ration according to what is most appropriate for the representation of certain parts. By using these rules, they could also create some disfigured and de- formed figures from inlaid work or shells, which would neither be well- ordered nor represent anything [like the objects from which they were cre- ated], thus resembling those of the second part of this book. And this will be so much the more agreeable, that through these works, which seem to demand nothing more than rusticity, one will see perfect images and well-ordered pic- tures emerging from a confusion of shells, stones, putty, etc. placed in a dis- orderly fashion and without a plan to their appearance. These can be made so dexterously and with such artifice that, looking at the figure through the hole of a sight, one will not perceive the material of which the work is composed, but instead will think one is seeing an ordinary, well-executed picture. 9I As Niceron noted, confusion and contortion -the recreation of the labyrinth that Ariadne's thread alone could unlock -were an equally important part of scientific play. The model of the labyrinth was perceived to be a more accurate mirror of the social and political con- fusion of the seventeenth century; as Kircher and many of his con- temporaries articulated, after the turmoil of the Thirty Years' War and the numerous other upheavals that they had experienced, the only thing that remained clear was that no boundaries were absolute and no categories transparent.92 From this perspective, the semantic field of lusus offered a flexible terminology that succinctly, if im- perfectly, taxonomized the confusion of the scientific and philo- sophical world. In part, we can view the creation ofanamorphic games as a social message, an intellectual metaphor for the age. Within the narrower parameters of scientific play, however, it exemplified the desire to traverse the boundaries between the natural and unnatural world. Contemporary descriptions of these spectacles suggest how closely 91Jean-Francois Niceron, La perspective curieuse ou magie artificielle des effets merveilleux (Paris, 1738) bk. 2, 7. 92There is a large literature on the relation between the social and political structures of the seventeenth century and their cultural manifestations.

"And would not such pictures seem to have been painted rather in order to rep- resent visions of sinister nightmares or witches' Sabbath revels, ca- pable of evoking fear and gloom and even of causing abortions in pregnant women," wrote Gregoire Huret, "than in order to depict natural and pleasing subjects in the normal way?"93 Surely some of the more mathematically naive viewers must have thought that they had finally witnessed a ludibrium daemonorum (demon's jest), and one that illustrated the ability of demons to insert themselves in all forms of human activity, including the ecclesiastical laboratory. Early in his career, in fact, Kircher was accused of black magic after demon- strating one of his optical illusions and was forced to reveal the mechanism of his apparatus to save himself from further suspicion. 94 The emergence of the majority of these illusory productions from the monastic scientific culture of the seventeenth century, in partic- ular theJesuits and the Minims (to which both Mersenne and his pu- pil Niceron belonged), is important in understanding the social con- text of this form of scientific play. The optical work in which these orders specialized served scientific and religious ends simulta- neously. Working within the Jesuit community, for example, Kircher and Schott had little reason to fear the charge of witchcraft which the creation of such diabolical phenomena might have pro- duced for a less well-connected laymen. Rather, these scientists as- sumed the guise of the Christian magus, conjuring up images to pro- voke the ignorant into obedient and awestruck silence, and to teach the learned that even the devil's play could be scientifically dissected if not in fact turned into white magic. From magic squares to magic lanterns to tricks of perspective, the plays of knowledge were de- signed to demystify natural operations that had been categorized as beyond plausibility and therefore dangerous to know. At the same time, lusus maintained a hierarchy of knowledge which distin- guished the learned from the ignorant in a way that neatly corre- sponded with the moral hierarchy of the universe. The scientific jokes, both of nature and of knowledge, through- out this period were constructed to parallel each other in their at- 93In Baltrusaitis, 76. 94Kircher used the term "ludibrium daemonorum" for celestial portents; Kircher, 1671, 706; Conor Reilly, Athanasius Kircher S.

The functions of lusus, in all in- stances, was to identify the precise moment in which these para- doxes of classification arose. "Nature, in fact, is nothing but a greater art," observed Leibniz, "and we cannot always clearly dis- tinguish the artificial from the natural. "95 And the perpetual confu- sion between these two categories fueled the playfulness of scientific discourse in early modern Europe. * * * * * By the late eighteenth century, the jokes of nature had disap- peared almost entirely from science. Relegated to a smaller and more precisely delineated portion of the natural world, they could no longer claim to be a taxonomic principle that ordered and explained nature. No longer did nature play in infinity. Under the influence of Galilean, Cartesian, and Newtonian science she submitted herself to an increasingly rational and selective structure, one that offered less scope for the poetic propensities of sixteenth- and seventeenth-cen- tury science. The Renaissance system of nature, constructed through use of analogy, established meaning through a reflexive system of signs, symbols, and correspondences which created horizontal relations among kingdoms and worlds. By the eighteenth century, the hier- archies of correspondent meaning in which lusus participated had been replaced by an increasingly vertical taxonomy that explained natural operations in functional rather than symbolic terms.96 Sim- ilarly, natural philosophers like Robert Boyle sought to correct the perception that nature was allowed any independent action in the process of creation. More than any other component of late Renais- sance natural philosophy, lusus testified to the existence of an ani- mated nature, at odds with the late seventeenth- and eighteenth- 95Leibniz, Protagea, in Rossi, 61. "Quinci si puo notare come, non solo le cose della natura hanno il consenso a quel fine per cui sono fatte, ma quelle anco dell'arte, perche la medesima anima del mondo guida l'una e l'altra, onde sono similissime"; Tommaso Campanella, Del senso delle cose e della magia, ed. Antonio Bruers (Bari, I925), 2i8. 96A useful book in this regard is James Larson, Reason and Experience: The Repre- sentation of Natural Order in the Work of Carl Von Linne (Berkeley, 1971); Giulio Bar- santi, "Le immagini della natura: Scala, mappe, alberi 1700-I800," Nuncius 3 (1988): 55-I25; Heninger, I6. I am particularly indebted to Lorraine Daston for clarifying some of the distinctions between Renaissance and Enlightenment visions of natural order. 325</page><page sequence="35">RENAISSANCE QUARTERLY century emphasis on God as a creator of absolute categories, impermeable to the changes that a playful nature wrought. "So that, instead of a True God, they have substituted, for us, a kind of God- dess, with the Title of Nature," reflected Robert Boyle on earlier vi- sions of scientific agency. 97 Both the gender of nature and the gender of science were at a crucial moment of transition. 98 And the disap- pearance oflusus signified increasing approval of a more passive role for nature in eighteenth-century science, denying her the right to arbitrarily adjust or even rewrite the framework of the universe. Within this new epistemological framework, what replaced lusus? In the first instance, naturalists sought to explain away the playfulness of various phenomena. Fossils found their place in the animal and vegetable kingdoms, nature's paintings were classified as trivial irregularities in stone, and giant's bones and unicorn's horns were revealed as the remains of entirely ordinary beings or as frauds. Similarly, the English naturalist John Ray sought to convince his readers that mountains were not monstrous, "examples of confu- sion in Nature," but part of nature's regularity and beauty. 99 Par- ticularly important to the regularization of nature were the meth- odological procedures used to arrive at these conclusions. "If one were to open up more cadavers, says Monsieur de Fontenelle, the singularities of the jeux de la nature would become more common." 00 Thus dissection, the technology of the life sciences, became an apparatus for unmasking lusus. Despite the attempts to rid nature of her playfulness, jokes did not entirely disappear from science during the Enlightenment. Given the pervasiveness oflusus in the language of science until the eigh- teenth century, it would have been a gargantuan task to eliminate this vocabulary entirely, no matter how preferable a portion of the scientific community thought this would be. The language of play was a particularly rich and descriptive terminology; as such, it re- tained a certain usefulness to elucidate natural processes for which more precise terms were unnecessary, mainly because they were no 97Robert Boyle, A Free Inquiry into the Vulgarly Receiv'd Notion of Nature (London, I685-86), 133-34. 98Carolyn Merchant, The Death of Nature: Women, Ecology and the Scientific Revo- lution (San Francisco, 1980); Londa Schiebinger, "Feminine Icons: The Face of Early Modern Science," Critical Inquiry 14 (1988): 661-91. 99John Ray, Miscellaneous Discourses (1692), in Porter, 44.

On a limited scale, lusus continued to describe the process of diversification. Even Gi- acinto Gimma, a man who specialized in turning Renaissance lusus into Enlightenment fables, allowed that the variety of colors in cer- tain species of coral were instances in which "nature has wished to joke" ("ha voluto scherzar la Natura"). However, in another pas- sage on coral, he elaborated on his intent: they were a sleight-of- hand ("giuoco di mani"). oI The other aspect of nature's playfulness which lingered in the vo- cabulary of the eighteenth century concerned artifice. Whatever at- tempts scientists made to organize nature, they could not deny that she still had the capacity occasionally to surprise them with her tricks. The collector Francesco Ginanni described the contents of one section of his museum in Ravenna, containing stones painted and sculpted by nature, as "accidentaljokes, andjokes of nature. "102 Gimma and the author of the 1765 Encyclopedie article on "jeu" also conceded that such stones could be described as plays, provided that one separated them from the mistaken lusus of fossils, which had since been revealed to be the imprint or calcified remains of living creations. Gimma added a further caveat. Specifying that the joke was only a matter of form and color, and therefore not essential, he underlined the quality of seeming in the language of scientific play. 103 It was the superficial exterior alone that played; the vital op- erations of the internal organism remained sacrosanct, removed from such frivolity. Continuing this line of thought, he suggested, "indeed jokes of nature are not dissimilar from what occurs in ice." Likewise Battarra affirmed that "Stalagmites and Stalagtites are plays of nature," in contrast to fossils that long ago had lost their poetic image. 04 By reducing nature's playfulness to her most superficial aspects, scientists essentially eliminated lusus from the language of active sci- '0iGimma, Della storia naturale dellegemme, dellepietre e tutti i minerali over dellafisica sotteranea (Naples, I730) I: 155, 335.

Its cosmological significance was formally and fi- nally conflated with the social playfulness of ludi, emphasizing its attractiveness as a parlor game rather than as an intellectual con- struct. The premise of Renaissance natural history had itself become the joke for the eighteenth-century scientists, at the expense of the naturalists who preceded them. "There are some people who know the taste of collectors of natural history for the marvelous," reported the editors of the Encyclopedie. "Knowing how to put it to profit, they make [the collectors] pay dearly for stones changed by accident, asjeux de la nature, that they have had the secret of forming by art. "Ios Thus while the plays of nature continued to work themselves out in the cabinets d'histoire naturelle and public spectacles of the eighteenth century, they no longer disrupted the realm of science. 06 The par- adox oflusus is this: in the desire to play with rational discourse, to insert herself at every opportunity, she eventually exhausted her possibilities. The competing systems of meaning between which she fit were no longer central to the scientific discourse of the late eighteenth century, and without them lusus quietly slipped away into the realm of fantasy.
