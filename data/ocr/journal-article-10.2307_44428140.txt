<plain_text><page sequence="1">Deconstructing Modern Educational Technology Andrew R. J. Yeaman The Postmodern Postmodernism is "post" to the beliefs of the modern age of industrial, scientific, positivististic enlighten- ment. In What is Post-Modernism? Jencks classifies societies by their major forms of production (1 989). The divisions are: premodern-agricultural (10,000 BC- 1450), modern-industrial (1450-1960), and postmod- ern-information (1960 to the present) (p. 47). This chronology runs parallel to the historical descriptions by Foucault of sovereignty giving way to disciplinary society (1977) and to Deleuze and Cuatarri's description of the current state of social control (1 983, 1987). Although "the notion of postmodernity becomes a parody of the notion of modernity" (de Man, 1 986, p. 120), postmodernists question whether progress really exists. They observe changes in consciousness resulting from the automation of knowledge and the treatment of education and training as commodities (Lyotard, 1984). This essay directly challenges the received stability of the scientific world view. The stability is only appearance (Locke, 1 992). That scientific analyses of social life are biased by social changes is a major theme of Modern Conditions, Postmodern Contro- versies (Smart, 1 992). The legitimacy of knowledge as a token of shared principles has become questionable. Lyotard gives the name "metanarratives" to rationales for automation that call on the emancipation of humanity (1984). These are explained in The Post- modern Condition as the grand myths of technological and scientific progress. Despite their nobility, these modern beliefs are social fictions. Human problems often cannot be solved by the machines and computers of technoscience. Education delivered by televisions and computers is not accompanied by any wish to look deeper for truth but by a faith in utility; that to be worth gaining, the information presented must be useful (p. 51). The narrow function of the technological curriculum is not Andrew R. J. Yeaman is Consultant with Yeaman &amp; Asso- ciates, Denver, Colorado. EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY/February 1994 15</page><page sequence="2">to provoke original insight but the absorption of standardized facts. Memorizing this authorized knowledge is the goal, and obedience is the performance criteria monitored. Lyotard also comments on the inhumanity of schooling as it has emerged in the last two centuries in company with industrial production (1 991, p. 4). In this regard, Lyotard does not mean postmodernism as an artistic or architectural trend, but the questioning of the metanarratives of modernity and the need to question (p. 127). Postmodernists understand that the biggest human difficulties will not be repaired by technological fixes. The authentic problems are in the quality of human conduct in terms of ethics and questions of what is ethical. The need for fully dimensional consideration is due to the limits of the linear thinking that preceded. Where "strategies" were once seen leading directly to desired results, side-effects are an important concern today. Unintended, unanticipated results are most apparent in the ecological effects of modern science. Asbestos, insecticides, radioactive materials, and carcinogenic chemicals have become icons memorializing the failings of modern science in trying to make the world a better place. Postmodern thinking does not dispute the value of trying to improve both the world and human relations, but it does question the possibility of doing so with only science and technology. Belief in industrial, urban solutions accompanied the development of the modern world. The Utopian dream of navigating cyberspace and controlling all things by pressing a few keys underlies this type of thinking. Postman warns that not only what people think about is changed but also the symbols that people think with are changed (1992). The warning can be applied to modernity. Factory production means clothes are not sewn at home but must be purchased and cannot be repaired. Automobile transportation means work place and home are not part of the same community. Quantitative intelligence testing means education and occupational opportunities are limited and not available to all who aspire. This short list of generalizations illustrates how, along the way, rationality is warped by technoscience. Deconstruction Deconstruction is the sign of postmodern thinking. It is not a step by step formula. Nor is it ideal for uncovering absolute truth. It is a mode of criticism, and it uncovers why someone thinks there is truth in a certain situation. Texts chosen for deconstruction are ones with which deconstructors identify or feel a positive relationship. Deconstruction seeks the deconstructive moment or place where texts contradict themselves and fall away from their official meaning. Derrida used deconstruction in 1966 to signal surpassing structuralism: "It is a question of explicitly and systematically posing the problem of the status of a discourse which borrows from a heritage the resources necessary for the deconstruction of that heritage itself." (1978, p. 282). These ideas were first presented in Edmund Husserl's Origin of Geometry: An Introduction (1 962/1 989) where Derrida addresses the phenomeno- logical authority for obtaining meaning that rests with readers and, as a radical critique of Western metaphysics, suggests the impossibility of determining absolute, historical truth. Language itself may be endlessly self-referential. From that position it is still possible to continue but only with uncertainty. Each text can be deconstructed not once but in many different ways. Derrida's important, original contributions were accompanied by valuable work from Barthes, Baudrillard, Cixous, Foucault, Kristeva, Lacan, Lyotard, and Sollers, among others of the French Tel Quel group (Adams &amp; Searle, 1986). The result was a profound change in understanding that first affected literary interpretation and analytic philosophy, and is today found in all disciplines. Deconstruction often contributes to research and teaching in English, languages, literature, social studies, and related subjects. Many articles and books have been published on deconstruction. Introductions to deconstruction are supplied by Leitch (1983), Norris (1982), and Norris and Benjamin (1988). Introductions to deconstruction in education are provided by Atkins and Johnson (1985) and Gilbert (1989). At present Derrida, alone, has over 20 books in print in English. Derrida explains that deconstruction is not a negative operation, that in Heidegger's original German Destruktion means the dismantling of a system (1985, pp. 83-87). Similarly, Abbau means "to take apart an edifice in order to see how it is constituted or deconstituted." Rather than the fury of nihilism, deconstruction is an affirmation. It exceeds the struc- turalist approach as a way of finding out how something works because it addresses beliefs funda- mental to Western philosophy and communication. Johnson, an American second-generation decon- structor, gave this everyday definition of deconstruction in an interview (Saluszinsky, 1987): The training most people get from the beginning, in school and through all of the cultural pressures on us, is to answer the question: "What's the bottom line?" What deconstruction does is to teach you to ask: "What does the construction of the bottom line leave out? What does it repress? What does it disregard? What does it consider unimportant? What does it put in the margins?" So that it's a double process. You have to have some sense of what someone's conception of what the bottom line would be, is, in order to organize the "noise" that's being disregarded, (p. 164) 1 6 EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY/February 1994</page><page sequence="3">Examples of deconstruction can be found in the education research and theory literature. Brooke deconstructs the control model of writing that is taught to composition students (1989). Buck and Osborne deconstruct three myths about progress in education (1990). Hlynka deconstructs limp french fries as an alleged training problem (1991a). (Compare those postmodern french fries with Rossett's modern french fries (1991).) Lather deconstructs feminist teaching in higher education (1992). Hlynka and Yeaman deconstruct postmodern educational technology (1992). Yeaman deconstructs visual communication and discussed the creation of deconstructive messages (1994). In the next section of this essay, two metanarratives of modern educational technology will be deconstructed. Modern Educational Technology Metanarrative: The Shannon-Weaver Model How communication works can itself be communi- cated with certainty. Educational communication func- tions hydraulically so that knowledge flows from the instructor to the learner. The epistemology of educational technology follows this linear transmission of information (Saettler, 1990, p. 265). It is based on the Shannon-Weaver model for telecommunication apparatus (1949). The model's source is Shannon and Weaver's book, The Mathe- matical Theory of Communication, which is about hardware and data transmission. For example, the origin of bits from binary digits is credited to J. W. Tukey (p. 4). Most of the ideas in the text are expressed in algebraic notation. According to Shannon and Weaver there are five parts to a communication system (1 949). These are the information source, the transmitter, the channel, the receiver, and the destination. Basic textbooks in educational technology accept the way the Shannon- Weaver model reduces communication between people to an abstraction (Heinich, Molenda, &amp; Russell, 1989; Kemp &amp; Smellie, 1989; Thompson, Simonson, &amp; Hargrave, 1992). Subsequent elaborations are also presented such as the Schramm model, which includes feedback and overlapping fields of experience between the person who sends the message and the person who receives it. See, for example, the diagram presented by Smith &amp; Ragan (1993, p. 16) and the more complex models reported by Saettler (1990). Deconstructive Commentary on The Shannon-Weaver Model What a blessing it would be, Agathon, if wisdom could run from the fuller amongst us to the emptier, while we touch one another, as when two cups are placed side by side a bit of wool conveys water from the fuller into the emptier. (Plato, 1956, p. 74) A line of boxes linked by arrows flowing left to right is the central expression of educational technology, yet Socrates' metaphor, denying this possibility, travels across the years through translators and copyists. There is some irony in this. The banquet scene of the Symposium is rich in mysticism and undercurrents. Perhaps Socrates makes a gracious remark while he takes his seat, having entered late. His intention is vague: He wishes to receive wisdom? To give wisdom? To exchange wisdom? He regrets the impossible but is he giving an invitation, hinting at a challenge, or paying a compliment? Socrates' ideal, physical model of communication is too simple to be true but that is unimportant in the setting: an evening of eating and drinking. The gathering is to be resolved in competitive speech making. Those who speak deliver speeches suitable to their characters. Aristophanes is comic, Agathon is inflated, and Socrates is mystical. The conveyance of meaning is subordinate to each speaker's identity so that the speaker is very much the message. This supports rejecting the hydraulic metaphor as implausible. Despite being self-contradictory, the image of the flowing message persists in the Shannon-Weaver model. Just as its ambiguity may have been useful for Socrates, the Shannon-Weaver model may have a modern utility. Thinking about the human activity of communication as a pipeline ignores the context (McLuhan &amp; McLuhan, 1 988, pp. 86-87). Besides the commonsense that people do communicate, although no one knows precisely how or what, the pipeline image builds a legend of neutrality. Similarly, the feedback loop and overlapping fields of experience in the Schramm version give a false appearance of consensual communication. The illustration of flowing communication hides that social roles and purposes can be coercive (Nichols, 1 990, p. 38). Taking a schematic diagram of hardware as the foundation for educating is reification. That fallacy objectifies people. It converts them into things. When a technician says the computer and the printer are shaking hands, the metaphor is anthropomorphic. Applying the Shannon-Weaver model to humans reverses that anthropomorphism. The prose of Shannon and Weaver is rewritten so that it extends what is meant by machine readable text (Easthope, 1990; Yeaman 1 993a). The diagram may be redrawn with the head of a speaker and the head of a listener and other details (Fales, Kuetemeyer &amp; Brusie, 1 988, p. 25; Kemp, &amp; Smellie, 1989, p. 15). Not only are students and trainees transformed into components, but the readers of educational technology textbooks are also transformed into components. All data are to be processed, without subtlety or deviation, until the right answer is found. By Haraway's definition: " a hybrid of machine and organism" (1991, p. 149), the social EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY/February 1 994 17</page><page sequence="4">reality of educational technology creates cyborgs. This reification is the modern practice, theorizing and research of educational technology. The component model is widespread. Reddy critiques language about language as a metaphorical conduit (1979). Reddy looks at how Shannon and Weaver (1 949) describe the transmitted signal and the received signal. Reddy points out that the message, having endured the apparatus and been reconstructed, supposedly stays the same. Reddy's analysis is important in human terms. It is tempting to believe the information stored in libraries can be accessed by anyone who wants to know. However, "There are no ideas whatsoever in any libraries." (Reddy, 1979, p. 309). Information is useless to people who are unable to read or to cyborgs who are unable to analyze, synthesize and criticize what they read. Convergent findings were produced by Winograd and Flores' review of cognition, language and action (1987). They deny that communication can be adequately represented as the transmission of information. They argue that language is action in a system of human social action. Pouring wisdom into people like a fluid is mythical (Carroll, 1990) but belief in the cognitive funnel continues. Hardware advocates such as Perelman believe access to computerized resources through high- speed telecommunications will be a panacea (1992). Technology in education is a phrase gaining in frequency as a synonym for media and communication. Information technology is often mistaken for educational technology (Yeaman, 1987), which is what the pipeline metaphor of communication suggests. The accurate conveyance of data is generally taken as good, right and powerful, and modern assumptions about education and communication as neutrally transmitted information persist (Bowers, 1988). Metanarrative: The Systems Approach How instruction works can itself be taught with certainty. The practice of educational technology is a natural system, like a tree, with an identifiable and decodable set of parts. The relationships between the parts can be isolated and manipulated so that manage- ment objectives can be effectively implemented. The Shannon-Weaver model and its descendants are used to depict the systems approach to communication and education. In the 1940s and 1950s there were extensive collaborations between several disciplines concerned with systems (Noble, 1991). The telephone schematic of Shannon and Weaver's general communication system became the foundation of information theory. This coincided somewhat with the biological basis of general system theory (Bertalanffy, 1968). Both coincided somewhat with the theory of control systems or cybernetics (Wiener, 1961). And they all coincided somewhat with the labeled boxes and flow lines depicting the functioning of computers and human memory. Many of the concepts in the original texts are expressed with equations, requiring readers to be literate in mathematics and science. The dynamic systems view was thought vastly superior to mechanistic, cause and effect, behavioral analyses (Laslow, 1972). Research in systems disciplines was rewarded with grant funds, especially from military sources, as there were direct needs. The practical application of systems theory established logical and mathematical relationships through systems analysis. In sociocultural situations, such as managing business, government and education, this became known as the systems approach. Systems science is the source of instructional design technique and both reflect the top-down, management point of view (Nunan, 1983)'. Just as nature'is seen to function, culture is seen to function, too. The subsystem components must be identified and their relationships understood to cause and improve functioning. The result is the development of steps for successfully designing and delivering instruction that ensures effective performance. These media production procedures are descended from instructional management, an application of systems analysis. They are often known by their military name as Instructional Systems Development (ISD) and are usually referred to as models. By the 1960s educational technology had gone beyond devices and become a way of problem solving (Finn, 1962, pp. 29-30). Technological development was accepted as "the central organic process of our society" (p. 32). Organicism had replaced mechanism as the dominant metaphor (Heinich, 1970). Technology was redefined as design "that reduces the uncertainty in the cause-effect relationships involved in achieving a desired outcome" (Rogers, 1 983, p. 1 2). Saettler writes this about instructional systems design in The Evolution of American Educational Technology. "A systems approach is a decision-making tool that enables those who manage the system to state their bias in the form of a goal, and to operate the system so that performance will achieve a particular goal" (1990, p. 350). Many models for systematically designing instruction were put into practice over the decades since the organic systems approach replaced physical and mechanical metaphors (Shrock, 1991). The difficulty in choosing between models indicates the status of the field. Andrews and Coodson compared 40 design models along 20 dimensions (1980/1991). Taylor and Doughty identified 12 major tasks among 20 instruc- tional development models (1 988). The models are not so much empirically based on systems research as they are founded upon agreement about conventional practice. Although discrepancies persist between research and practice there was an important break with the earlier 1 8 EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY/February 1 994</page><page sequence="5">folk wisdom of instruction that failed to connect learning experiences with learning outcomes (Shrock, 1991). Many teachers and instructional designers currently learn how to use media along with a systems model such as the ASSURE model (Heinich, Molenda, &amp; Russell, 1989) or the Kemp model (Kemp &amp; Smellie, 1989). Contemporary books giving a thorough introduction to designing instruction systematically are provided by Kemp (1985), Seels and Glasgow (1990), and Smith and Ragan (1993). There is no doubt that systems models are extremely useful for developing instruction that is effective and efficient from a modern viewpoint. Deconstructive Commentary on The Systems Approach Today we have naming of parts. Yesterday We had daily cleaning. And tomorrow morning, We shall have what to do after firing. But today, Today we have naming of parts. Japónica Glistens like coral in all of the neighboring gardens, And today we have naming of parts. (Reed, 1 947, p. 27) Worldwide war half a century ago caused training to gain tremendously in importance. Millions of people were trained for the sake of their own survival and for their duty to their nations. Reed's wartime poems bear a self-reflecting title: Lessons of the War (1947). They catch the new soldiers' feelings of dread, boredom, fatigue, futility, and frustration. The naming of parts featured in their training is an oversimplification: life is not only a matter of communicating but also requires a context of living with other people. Communication is a part of being a person. Life and living are more than the messages transmitted and received as signals: they are organismic systems. While bees pollinated japónica and almond blossoms in a natural system, soldiers and war workers were taught to function in an artificial system. One of the ways in which instruction was developed was from linking cognition with performance: a soldier who could identify the pieces of a weapon would be able to use it properly in combat. Once the parts are named they are unquestionable. Similarly, some organic systems also have parts named for machinery and the distinction has been blurred. Human endeavors lose their cultural dimensions and became organic just as machines become more alive by being labeled as intelligent. The renaming of educational hypermedia as intelligent hypertutoring indicates this sort of blurring (Bereano, Haselkorn, &amp; Karovsky, 1991). From being recognized as a system, training became educational technology and took on the rhetoric and power of scientific authority. System is an ambiguous word that refers to both any institution that is socially constructed and any organic whole. The design principle of being systematic seems to have been confused with being systemic, in the physiological sense. Culture seems to have been confused with nature. The knowledge base of educational technology includes science but the practice of educational technology is not the practice of science. This paradox exists because instructional theory comes from rationalism, whereas learning theory comes from empiricism. Although derived rationally, ISD models and their components are subject to verification and justification through psychological experimentation. Gaining knowledge in this way does not lead to the normal puzzle-solving research of a Kuhnian paradigm (Barnes, 1983; Kuhn, 1970). The cognitive effects of instruction and computer based expert systems for instructional design are still far from predictable and Winn comments, "There has always been opposition within the field to research and theory that has at times bordered on hostility" (1988, p. 808). Discussion To question the most basic principles of modernity redefines the meaning of schooling, and also calls into question the very basis of our history, our cultural criticism, and our manifestations and expressions of public life. (Aronowitz &amp; Giroux, 1991, p. 58) The meta narrati ves of the Shannon-Weaver model and the systems approach are the intellectual backbone of educational technology, but they also provide discourses invested in the media text as authority. How systems of education and training are looked at depends on who produces the instruction and those who receive the instruction (Nunan, 1983). Response choices are usually predetermined and limited to socially acceptable correct or wrong answers. Learners as receivers are used like inanimate machines, unable to question what the bottom line obscures. Wells makes the authority claims overt: "I am telling you to do something." (1986, p. 262). The heritage of information theory and systems is problematic to educational technology because this is a war machines approach to controlling people (Noble, 1991). Instead of helping people manage their own lives, letting them gain personal satisfaction, and their own political liberties, the systems approach authorizes the industrial age mentality of fixing people because they are bad machines. Instructional management and instructional systems are recognized for their business and military values in managing human behavior (Andrews &amp; Hakken, 1977; Bowers, 1988; Callahan, 1962; Cuban, 1986; Nunan, 1983; Wells, 1986). Instruction is an institution that frequently treats people as objects or numbers. An extreme belief, held by some educators, is that making people think like computer programs is highly desirable. Many education and training practices, whether in school or the work place, merely serve to process people. The modern factories of education are inherently dehumanizing. Educational technology functions by reconstructing EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOG Y/February 1994 19</page><page sequence="6">people into cyborgs. Teachers, instructional designers, media managers, and professors are becoming preoccupied with hardware, and they hold serious conversations about twisted pair and nine pin connectors. The general result is the fitting of people to the requirements of machines and programmed logic. The conservative view of the human-computer future describes students in human-computer dyads as peripheral devices (Damarin, 1992). A less conservative view is that the dehumanized cyborgs of fiction come from a social reality that is already here. What was once laughable as organizational paper shuffling has become a nightmare of electronic bureaucracy, where people report to computers instead of human supervisors (Zuboff, 1988). The information society is not only a product of efforts to improve the conditions of life for people but also a product of the industrialization and the militarization of everyday life (Noble, 1991). Despite all the research and development that is done in educational technology, almost no consideration is given to solving the world's major problems. That the artifacts of technoscience arą manipulable and correctable is obscured by the systems approach giving the power of nature to artificial processes including itself. Social contexts drive the knowledge and practice of educational technology. From an anthropological perspective the beliefs and behaviors of modern metanarratives are responses to ecological pressures. This theory of cultural evolution successfully extrapolates to the culture of educational technology (Yeaman, 1990). In particular, the field's research and theory emphasis on achievement appears socially constructed. Although there is high status from affiliation with cognitive psychology and computers, the technology based on the science is questionable. Achievement measures from educational technology are usually quantitative but mathematical distributions have considerably less validity for describing people than for describing the physical world. What is regarded as natural may only be cultural (Yeaman, 1993). Educational technology is absolutely modern. The key words are megabytes, bandwidth, effectiveness, performance, and cost. Instructional designers, instructors, and media managers are faced with the bleak possibility that their central roles are in: • Labeling learners with test results. • Supporting the social processing of students and trainees into those who may and those who may not do other things in life. • Not just bringing people to be able to perform but controlling them by monitoring performance continuously. • Producing obedient cyborgs. A Postmodern Prescription The goal of education is neither the engineering of learning as an end in itself nor the production of cognitive components or technical skills for the technological infrastructure of the information age ; rather it is the cultivation of human beings , through an encouragement of a deep self-understanding along with an understanding of and participation in the world. The best schools are those that are personalized , that are organized as communities of teachers , students and parents who are fully engaged ' who understand why they are learning and teaching , and who together . construct a full, rich interdisciplinary curriculum , a nurturing , attentive pedagogy , and a sense of worldly commitment and care. (Noble, 1 991 , p. 1 90) The postmodern breaks with the modern by revisiting the original enlightenment agenda to make life better for everyone. The goals given by Noble come from the best of the modern educational tradition (1991). These goals do not judge the quality of instruction on the ratio of computers to students nor do they call for more computers. They draw attention to the important questions in life as distinctly human problems for people to solve by working together. Similar goals can be visualized for employee development and the training of managers. The modern venture has become diffused through institutionalization and trapped in its own jargon and procedures. Scientific ideals of social equality became technology for sorting people into classes. Forces for industrial production dominate. To be rated as worthwhile, all activities must be financially profitable or directly useful. Education and training, information and knowledge, are commodities to be sold and bought. The single-minded goal of usefulness for the greatest number of people has resulted in turning the population into components of a megamachine. People are continuously threatened on an economic level by having their performance checked for the sake of the modern myth of progress. This age of discipline and industry is not much different from the age of kings and farming that came before. But enough of the modern, except to say that this inhumanity is what the postmodern recognizes. Postmodern thinking can be read in the educational technology literature and can be heard in scholarly presentations at national conferences. Here is a representative selection: Nichols redirects educational technology towards: "A moral condition in which technology is used more to educate and less to subjugate the people and the earth" (1990, p. 38). Muffoletto fears "the system is in control" but offers hope that media courses can give educators ways of thinking about their relationships with daily teaching and prepackaged instructional media (1990). Damarin is concerned by the patriarchal limitations imposed on women and works toward demystifying mathematics, science, and technology (1992). DeVaney criticizes the 20 EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY/February 1994</page><page sequence="7">award winning educational computer program Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego for being loaded with oppressive stereotypes (1993). DeVaney asks for intervention by placing "the technology in the hands" of people who are not represented and who are misrepresented so they can produce their own videos, films, and computer software. Anderson seeks a constructivist approach to hypertext that is not psychological but is philosophical and allows for feminist research (1991). Hlynka comments on the modern state of things: "Educational technology appears to have become stuck fast in a technological, means-ends quagmire" (1991b, p. 29). Hlynka suggests an open systems approach focused on the complex and the transformatory. Koetting and Januszewski point to the excessively scientific bias for theories of control and request the admission of theory to the field that is less empirical and more conceptual such as critical inquiry (1991). The deconstructive commentaries of this paper and the analyses reported in the previous paragraph suggest the need for action on Noble's goals (1991). Three categories of rethinking emerged from the search for a prescription: educational technology and techno- science, educational technology and design, and educational technology and culture. Therefore, here is a modern rhetorical device, a tentative checklist of answers to the question: What Might Be the Demands of Postmodern Educational Technology? Technoscience • Overturn myths that dominate and obscure. • Acknowledge that technology has art and craft as the foundation of its design creativity rather than science. • Avoid faith there is a perfect world ahead if only technology is allowed to flow freely. • Question the empirical gathering of social numbers for hiding ideology as science. • Question science and technology because they have a history of unanticipated side effects. • Question technoscience because scientific methods and solutions are often driven by technologies and are usually shaped and limited by technologies and culture. • Question all prescriptions for their modern inflexibility, including those with the tentative heading, "What might be the demands of postmodern educational technology?" Instructional Design Issues • Accept there are probably several workable solutions to every instructional design problem, not just one ideal solution. • Examine and learn from instruction that supposedly fails as well as instruction that succeeds as predicted. • Be cautious: All media are metaphorical and never mean exactly what they seem to convey. It is not possible to escape from language, but metaphors, symbols, and models should be used with care. • Look for self-contradictions in your own messages and in other peoples' messages. • Expect diversity in the way students and trainees understand and what they understand. This increasingly comes from the teaching of English, and related subjects, where commonsense understandings of media are being replaced by analysis and interpretation. Advocate this way of understanding as superior to the myth of the linear, pipeline transmission of knowledge. • Break away from the tradition of communication that assigns power to the creators of instructional messages and denies it to learners. Its authoritarian approach is its failing. • Avoid idealism suggesting there is a perfect meeting of minds. Although people are engaged in communication all their lives, there is seldom an absolute correspondence in understandings. • Evaluate technological fixes, not only to see if the original problem has been solved but to see what else has been changed. Have new problems been created? • Plan by considering needs and not just technologies. Your task is to solve real world problems and not to advocate mythical 'solutions such as computers. Cultural Aspects • Realize that all educational communications are non-neutral and exist in a sociopolitical context. • Seek to read and analyze culture as text. • Become more aware of the varying meanings of symbols and metaphors across cultures. • Critique media carefully for crosscultural commu- nication possibilities and problems when selecting media for instruction. • Expect diversity in the way students and trainees understand and what they understand. This comes from differences between people culturally, socially and psychologically. • Collaborate with learners when designing an instructional message. • Invite learners to participate when redesigning an instructional message in the evaluation stage. • Design education and training that fits all classes of people, not just the majority. • Give video and computer production equipment to students and trainees so they can express themselves and learn from making their own programs. • Apply Lasswell's political science model of communication, not so much as psychology but as a sociological question: "Who says what in which channel to whom with what effect?" (Saettler, 1990, p. EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY/February 1994 21</page><page sequence="8">265). Consider Foucaulťs questions such as: "What are the modes of existence of this discourse? Where does it come from; how is it circulated; who controls it?" (1986, p. 148). Ask Cherryholmes' questions: "Who is authorized to speak? Who listens? What can be said? What remains unspoken?" (1988, p. 107). Conclusion There are severe problems with the univocal meaning of modern educational technology in a democratic society. It casts aside the epistemologica! dimensions of the social context as power relations; the cultural context of stereotypes; the varying interpretations of readers and viewers; the multiplicity of voices, messages and languages; and the choices of media as ways of representing and shaping thought. The accepted reality is that authors, teachers and instructional designers, and their technologies and devices, are the dispensers of unequivocable, objective truth. These blinders enable the field of educational technology to persist in maintaining the modern illusion of shared minds. By following and perpetuating the grand myth of technological and scientific progress, the modern profession of educational technology will neglect its ethical obligation to every human being. □ References Adams, H.
