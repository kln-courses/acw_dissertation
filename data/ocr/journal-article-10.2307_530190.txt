<plain_text><page sequence="1">389 Domestic Artifact Assemblages and Ritual Activities in the Bolivian Formative Marc Bermann University of Pittsburgh Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Jose Estevez Castillo Instituto Nacional de Arqueologia La Paz, Bolivia Survey and excavation in Oruro, Bolivia, have begun to reveal the nature of residential life during the Formative Period (1800 B.C.-A.C. 300) in central highland Bolivia. This reportpresents the results of recent investigations at the "Wankarani complex" site of San Andres. Excavation revealed clusters of clay figurines, grinding stones, and chipped stone bifaces in domestic contexts. Patterns of interassemblage variability and differential dis- card at the site suggest such artifacts were placed in ritual caches. Introduction There has been little archaeological investigation of the Formative Period (1800 B.C.-A.C. 300) in the southern Andean high plateau or altiplano. Major developments during this period included the emergence of sedentary lifeways, new technologies (metallurgy and pottery), re- gional ideologies as represented by widely-distributed iconographic styles (such as the Yaya-Mama tradition), and complex polities (centered around public-architecture sites such as Chiripa). The Formative Period also saw the devel- opment of mixed agropastoral economies based on newly domesticated tubers and chenopods as well as the domestic camelid (Kolata 1993: 59-63). Over the past 50 years, investigation centering on pub- lic-architecture sites has documented some aspects of For- mative Period adaptation and ceremonial life, particularly ritual activities involving temples and carved monoliths (Chavez 1988; Chavez and Chivez 1975; Kolata 1983: 245-252). Lacking parallel investigation of contexts, how- ever, virtually nothing is known of Formative Period life in general, and household ritual activities in particular. Al- though small clay figurines have been found at Formative Period residential sites throughout the southern altiplano, the exact context of their occurrence has rarely been re- ported (Bermann 1990; Bermann and Est&amp;vez 1992; Brockington et al. 1985, 1986; Ibarra Grasso and Lewis 1986; Ponce Sangines 1970: 38-42). Our 1992 investigation of Formative settlement and subsistence in the canton of La Joya, Department of Oruro, included preliminary exploration of domestic con- texts at the site of San Andres. Several features found in house remains at San Andres provided new information on Formative Period household activities and ritual. The Wankarani Complex of Bolivia The site of San Andres belongs to the Formative Period "Wankarani complex," a poorly-known archaeological cul- ture of the central Bolivian highlands (FIG. 1). Sites of the complex (typically isolated mounds of house remains and occupational refuse) resemble in form and ceramic style the type site of Wankarani, located in the Department of La Paz (Ibarra Grasso and Lewis 1986: 142-151; Ponce Sangines 1970: 16-25; Walter 1966). Wankarani sites range from 0.5-20 ha in size, with estimated populations of 80 to 4000 individuals (Bermann and Est&amp;vez 1992; Ponce Sangines 1980: 14). Carlos Ponce Sangines' excava- tions at the type site provided a set of radiocarbon dates that remain the basis for a very general chronology (Ponce Sangines 1970: 41-42). These radiocarbon dates, together with those derived from San Andres in 1992, suggest that some Wankarani sites were occupied before 1200 B.c. The Wankarani complex thus represents one of the earliest pottery-using populations of Bolivia (Bermann and Est&amp;vez 1992; Ibarra Grasso and Lewis 1986: 136; Ponce Sangines 1980: 13). Although the complex was first recognized in the 1930s, there has been little investigation of Wankarani sites, and none in the last 25 years.

At the site of Uspa-Uspa, stone Figure 2. Stone llama heads have been found on the floors of Wankarani complex houses. These specimens (from different sites) were photographed at the Museo Nacional Antropol6gico "Eduardo L6pez Rivas" in Oruro. The specimen on the left is ca. 55 cm tall. llama heads were found both on house floors and grouped together in caches outside the houses (Guerra, personal communication, 1992; Wasson 1967: 148). Other ritual items-clay figurines-have been collected at Wankarani sites, and at Formative Period sites in the Departments of Cochabamba, Oruro, and La Paz (Ber- mann and Estevez 1992; Brockington et al. 1985, 1986; Ibarra Grasso and Lewis 1986: 152-157). Although Was- son (1967: 150) found small clay zoomorphic figurines (dogs and llamas) on the surface of several Wankarani mound sites, our own observations suggest that these items probably represent modern offerings. Excavation at San Andres San Andres is a small mound site located 1.5 km from the Rio Desaguadero, near La Joya, Bolivia. The site measures roughly 4 m in height and 60 m in diameter (FIG. 3). Pilot fieldwork at the site in 1992 included random surface collections as well as excavation of three test units (FIG. 4). Excavation took place in natural and arbitrary levels. Natural layers thicker than 5 cm were divided into arbitrary levels. Fill was passed through 1 cm mesh screens, and all artifacts were collected, although the size of the screen prevented systematic recovery of fish remains. Soil samples were collected from each excavation lot to provide fish remains and flotation samples. When artifacts were divided up by class after removal from the screen, each artifact was compared to a series of scaled shapes to determine if the artifact was larger than 20 sq cm. Two test units totalling 21 sq m (Units 1 and 2) ex- plored house remains partially visible from the surface. Neither of these excavations went to sterile soil. A third test pit (Unit 3) along the mound's eastern edge revealed a complex sequence of ashy midden deposits. Results of Investigation At the apex of the mound, Unit 1 exposed the stone wall foundations of Structure 1 along with 1 sq m of house floor, and a large outdoor refuse pit. Unit 2 completely revealed Structure 2. The shallow position of Structure 2 on the mound, and the shallow deposits overlying the structure suggest that occupation at San Andr~s ended not long after the final abandonment of Structure 2. Radiocar- bon dates from Structure 2's hearth and from deposits below the floor suggest that occupation of the structure ended in the 12th or 13th century B.c. (TABLE 1). Architecture Structure 2 (FIG. 5) measured roughly 3.4 x 2.8 m, and displayed an oval plan, in contrast to the circular houses excavated by Wasson at Uspa-Uspa (Wasson 1967: 154).</page><page sequence="3">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 22, 1995 391 Figure 3.

J 0 C stone wall foundations Structure 2 closely resembled the Uspa-Uspa houses in construction techniques, however. As with the Uspa-Uspa houses, the walls of Structure 2 consisted of mud brick or cut sod placed on two rows of unmodified field stones and adobe blocks. The entrance of the structure had probably been in the NE section of the house. Ethnographic analogy suggests that the roof would have been made of paja (thatch) and taken a conical form. Clay with paja impres- sions and small quantities of burned paja were found inside the structure. Major features in the housefloor included: a large posthole; a small storage or refuse pit; and a double- chambered hearth made of stone slabs and clay. A small amount of ash, charcoal, and several fragments of cooking vessels were found near the bottom of the hearth. The house floor consisted of compacted soil and sand. Occupational debris had been pressed into this surface while the house was occupied, and thin layers of sand and silt had accumulated on it, probably during Oruro's noto- rious windy season (August-September). At least twice during the occupation of the house, the residents refloored the house by covering the occupational and aeolian depos- its on the old surface with a layer of clean soil.</page><page sequence="4">392 Bolivian Formative/Bermann and Esttvez Castillo Table 1.

Plan of Structure 2. Numbered circles mark locations of artifact caches. After exposing the uppermost of Structure 2's three floors in its entirety, we excavated the SE quarter of the dwelling below the level of the uppermost floor. The deposits below the uppermost floor can best be described as a "floor zone"-a 15-cm-thick layer of silty clay loam, with ash and sand lenses and microstrata (FIG. 6). We could not completely determine which microstrata represented occupational surfaces, refuse accumulation contemporane- ous with the house occupation, or natural and cultural deposits from periods when the structure was not occu- pied. Most of the layers seemed to represent aeolian accu- mulation and occupational levels. Level g (FIG. 6), however, appeared to resemble in soil type and artifact content (large bone fragments, large sherds, fire-cracked rock) the occupational fill found outside the structures. Level g thus may represent a period when the house was abandoned and used for refuse disposal. House Contents Artifacts found in the "floor zone" layer included frag- ments of undecorated cooking vessels; fragments of animal bone (camelid, bird, rodent, and fish); chipped stone tools (mostly expedient flake tools, but some irregular blades); ground stone tools; slag from copper smelting (escoria); part of a ceramic spoon; and items of personal adornment. Among the latter were several pendants of polished marine shell. We also recovered part of a black obsidian projectile point, and a small stone cone (trompito) of unknown function. Worked bone implements from the structure included awls, scrapers, and part of a polished tube. Most of the artifacts were found near the walls of the house, where they may have been overlooked or pushed during household cleaning. The floor zone also yielded two fragments from ceramic tubes, one with paint-filled, incised decoration (FIG. 7A). Similar hollow pottery tubes (generally referred to as trumpets or "sopladores") have been found at Chiripa, Pukara, and other south-central Andean Formative sites (Brockington et al. 1985; Ch6.vez 1988: 23; Ponce Sang- inds 1970: 48). The precise function of these tubes is unknown, but Ch6.vez (1988: 23) describes them as "ritual paraphernalia."</page><page sequence="5">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 22, 1995 393 South North 0cm bd surface d 25 d -50 stone Figure 6.

Artifact density inside the structure averaged 120/cu m, while density outside the structure averaged 580 artifacts/cu m. The outdoor deposits also contained more charcoal and fire-cracked rock. In addition, the in- door and outdoor artifact assemblages differed in several ways not apparent from simply comparing the proportion of artifact types in indoor and outdoor contexts (TABLE 2). The most prominent difference between indoor and out- door assemblages, one we initially noted during excava- tion, was in mean artifact size, with the majority of artifacts from inside the structure being relatively small. Roughly 70% of the 177 artifacts found inside the structure were smaller than 20 sq cm. In contrast, only 48% of the 206 artifacts from outside Structure 2 in Unit 2 were smaller than 20 sq cm. A similar pattern was observed in the smaller artifact assemblages from Unit 1. Roughly 83% of the 39 artifacts found inside Structure 1 were smaller than 20 sq cm, as opposed to 40% of the 92 artifacts found outside the structure. To further test the apparent contrast in artifact size, 70 artifacts were drawn at random from the indoor and out- door assemblages respectively, and individually measured (FIG. 8). Comparison of the indoor and outdoor samples showed that the 17.7 sq cm difference in mean artifact size between the indoor and outdoor assemblages was very significant statistically (5% windsorized log transformation t = -6.121, .001 &gt; p. &gt; .0001). It is worth repeating that this aspect of interassemblage Table 2. Artifact representation inside and outside Structures 1 and 2: counts and percentages.

A random sample of artifacts drawn from indoor and out- door contexts indicates that artifacts found inside the domestic struc- tures tended to be smaller than those found outside. variability would not have been noticed if we were not specifically interested in artifact size differences. In fact, without further investigation, Table 2 shows how the relatively similar proportions of items such as sherds, axe fragments, and chipped stone fragments in indoor and outdoor contexts of Units 1 and 2 would suggest that the assemblages were indeed fairly similar. The pattern of size differences, however, indicates that important factors structuring interassemblage variability at San Andres are not reflected in artifact frequencies, and would easily be missed if we had simply compared assemblages in terms of relative proportions of artifact types. These size differences are probably a function of trash disposal: the house occupants kept Structure 2 fairly clean, and discarded large artifacts outside the structure. Small items were probably overlooked during cleaning, or pressed into the structure's dirt floor. The differences in artifact size between interior and exterior assemblages illustrates how easily excavation confined to only one of these contexts (as is common in traditional approaches to domestic architecture in the south-central Andes) would provide an incomplete picture of a Wankarani occupation by not compensating for differ- ential discard modes. The interpretive implications of this interassemblage variability can be further illustrated by simply comparing the faunal remains from inside and out- side Structure 2. As shown in Table 3, bird bones (primar- ily from aquatic/shore birds) make up a relatively high percentage of the housefloor non-fish faunal assemblage (38%) in comparison to camelid bones. Thus if we only had recovered faunal remains from the housefloor, and had noted the large quantities of fish remains inside the dwell- ing (not shown in Table 3), we might have suggested a riverine orientation for the San Andres population. But bird bones only constitute 16% of the non-fish faunal assemblage from outdoor contexts, in contrast to 67% for camelids. This difference is probably a function of size; fish and bird remains tend to be smaller and more fragile than camelid bone fragments, and were more likely to be left in the house, while camelid bone fragments were discarded outside. Stone Tool Discard Patterns During excavation we were impressed by the quantity of stone tools inside the dwelling. In addition to a number of grinding stones, the uppermost floor and the 2.4 sq m area of floor zone yielded 22 whole, chipped stone bifaces (hoe blades) and 17 large fragments of bifaces. The stone tools associated with Structure 2 were unusual not only for their quantity (would a single household really need so many hoes?) but also for their size. The stone tools in the structure were exceptions to the general small size of interior artifacts. In fact, whole bifaces (measuring be- tween 7 and 15 cm long) and a handful of grinding stones Table 3. Faunal remains from inside and outside con- texts: counts and percentages. Fish remains are not shown because their small size prevented systematic recovery.

Over 90% of the specimens found in Structure 2 that were larger than 20 sq cm were stone tools. In contrast, many of the larger specimens outside the structure were fragments of pottery or camelid bone. The grinding stones and bifaces in Structure 2 suggest that particular classes of stone tools had a different discard pathway than pottery, bone, and other types of stone tools. This differential discard treatment alone might suggest the special nature of these artifact classes in Wankarani house- hold life. As we discuss below, this interpretation is rein- forced by the context in which most of the stone tools were found. The discovery of three clusters or offering caches in Structure 2 suggests that at least some of the grinding stones and bifaces, along with clay figurines, were used or stored for ritual activities. Figurines and Bifaces: Ritual Caches? The locations of the three artifact clusters found in Structure 2 are shown in Figure 5. The caches were made at different times and took slightly different forms. Cache 1 consisted of a cluster of artifacts grouped together on the uppermost floor and was clearly associated with the final occupation of the structure. In contrast, Caches 2 and 3 consisted of artifacts placed in shallow pits. The Cache 2 pit was located in the middle of the floor zone, and could not be associated with a particular floor. The Cache 3 pit was slightly below the original floor of the structure and thus may have been a sub-floor offering. Comparing the cache pits with three refuse features at San Andres suggests that Caches 2 and 3 were not simple refuse pits. The three refuse features consisted of a shallow pit in the uppermost floor of Structure 2 (U2 R4), and two outdoor refuse pits (one outside Structure 2 [U2 R7] and one outside of Structure 1 [U1 R4]). The fill and artifacts of the cache pits differed markedly from these refuse fea- tures. The cache pits displayed relatively clean sand fill, unlike the ashy fill of the refuse pits. Nor did the cache pits contain the fire-cracked rock, chipped stone, and burned animal bone fragments found in the refuse pits and all other refuse deposits at San Andr&amp;s (FIG. 9; TABLE 2). The cache objects did not display a purposeful arrange- ment, although the artifacts of Cache 2 had been covered with an inverted grinding slab or batin. As can be seen in Figure 8, each cache consisted of a set of whole bifaces, fragments ofbifaces (FIG. o10), and a small number of intact grinding stones. In addition, Caches 1 and 2 each included a fragment of an unfired orange clay figurine (FIG. 7B, c). Unfortunately, both of these figurines were damaged dur- ing excavation. Cache 3 did not contain a recognizable figurine, but it did include a small pocket of orange clay smashed beneath a grinding stone that may have been part of a figurine fragment. No other figurines-fired or unfired-were found at San Andres. The San Andres specimens are similar to the flat clay anthropomorphic figurines found at Uspa-Uspa and other Wankarani sites (Ponce Sangines 1970: 28). While the poorly-preserved San Andres figurines do not display the clear facial features of published Wankarani figurines, they do resemble published figurines in general form. A com- parison of the Cache 2 figurine fragment (FIG. 7C) with figurines from other sites suggests that the San Andres specimen is the bottom half of an anthropomorphic figur- ine with incisions depicting a hand. What the Cache 1 figurine fragment (FIG. 7B) represents is unclear, but it is similar to unpublished figurines in the museum at Oruro. Although unfired clay figurines have not been reported from elsewhere in the Oruro region, unfired figurines of humans and animals were common grave goods in burials dating to the later Tiwanaku Period at the lake-side settle- ment of Lukurmata (Bermann 1990: 286-287). Bifaces made from a black, volcanic rock are ubiquitous at Formative Period and Middle Horizon sites in the Oruro region (Bermann and Est&amp;vez 1992: 5; Ponce Sang- ines 1970: 42; Walter 1966: 82-86). The nearest known source of this type of rock is Querimita on the edge of Lake Poop6, some 150 km to the south (Ponce Sangines and Mogrovejo 1970: 55). Bifaces closely resembling the San Andres specimens have been found in association with the prehispanic quarry tunnels at Querimita (Guerra, personal communication, 1992; Ponce Sangines and Mogrovejo 1970: 64). Although the bifaces are usually described in the literature as consisting of basalt, analysis of rock sam- ples from the Querimita quarries has suggested that the tools were probably made from rhyodacite, dacite, or quartz-latite (Marquez, Kussmaul, and H6rmann 1975). The bifaces are generally thought (based on ethno- graphic analogy) to have been hafted for use as agricultural implements (Ponce Sangines 1970: 42). The narrower, or proximal, end would have been hafted. The breakage patterns observed in the San Andres bifaces may support this interpretation. Fragmentary bifaces tended to have broken laterally into proximal and distal fragments. Several distal fragments exhibited a projection or lip caused by a snap fracture, a pattern of biface breakage consistent with the use of bifaces as hoes (McAnany 1992: 205). Yet the sheer quantity of bifaces at sites in the La Joya area, and their association, even when broken, with residential occu- pations, may point to uses beyond preparation of agricul- tural fields. One possibility is that the bifaces may have functioned as all-purpose tools, used in a range of activities from wood-working to butchering.

Contents of San Andres domestic features. tion of the edgewear on the San Andres specimens using the naked eye and low power magnification (20x) revealed great variability in the location and extent of polish, scratches, and microflaking, suggesting a variety of scrap- ing, cutting, and chopping uses. A total of 47 whole bifaces were found in Unit 2. Of these, 13 were found in cache contexts in Structure 2. As shown in Table 4, 70% of the whole bifaces from the caches exhibited no signs of microflake damage (crescent, step, or scalar flake scars). In contrast, 79% of the intact bifaces found outside of cache contexts displayed mi- croflake scars, chiefly, but not exclusively, along the distal edge. It is very unlikely (chi-square with continuity correc- tion = 7.862, p = .005, Cramer's phi-square = .46) that this difference in the proportion of bifaces showing edge dam- age is simply an artifact of sampling. Experiments have shown that even 20 minutes of green plant cutting is likely to leave microflake scars on tools comparable in hardness to the latites and rhyodacites found here (Richards 1988: 70). It is possible, therefore, that some of the San Andres bifaces were placed in caches unused. At the least, the disparity in edge damage suggests that many of the bifaces in the caches, if used at all, were used for different purposes than bifaces found elsewhere at the site. This interpreta- Figure 10. A sample of bifaces from Cache 1 of Structure 2. S.3 Cm. I::~ :I</page><page sequence="9">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 22, 1995 397 Table 4.

Edge damage on stone tools can result from trampling and discard as well as use, and macroscopic examinations may be highly inaccurate (Young and Bamforth 1990). More rigorous analysis is required of the edgewear patterns before we can really discuss stone tool uses or the spatial patterning of tools at San Andres. It is possible that Caches 2 and 3 represent storage pits containing items that were not used together, perhaps simply valuable items stored together. Cache 1, however, suggests a deliberate grouping of objects on the house floor before abandonment of the structure, rather than storage. While a larger sample of houses is obviously needed to reconstruct domestic activities, the Structure 2 caches represent the first documentation of Wankarani figurines in context. If we accept that the figurines had ritual uses, the caches may represent deliberate offerings, perhaps associated with house dedication or abandonment ceremonies. Further, the association of the bifaces with figurines in cache contexts suggests that some bifaces had ritual significance in addition to utilitarian functions. Conclusion Investigations at San Andres documented a range of Wankarani household activities including preparation and consumption of camelids, fish, and birds; spinning and weaving; copper smelting; expedient flake tool making; and grinding and scraping tasks. Further research will be needed to determine whether the large quantities of bi- faces were produced at the site or imported in a finished state. We found few of the biface thinning flakes one would expect from manufacture of bifaces. The excavations also revealed in domestic contexts two classes of "ritual arti- facts" common in the circum-Lake Titicaca area to the north-ceramic tubes and clay figurines. Patterns of interassemblage variability, evidence of dif- ferential discard pathways, and cache settings suggest that other household rituals at San Andres, perhaps connected to house dedication or abandonment, could have involved both the figurines common in Formative Period Bolivian sites, and several types of relatively mundane household items usually viewed as purely utilitarian in function. That artifact size affects discard patterns is not a new observation, nor is it surprising to find different artifact assemblages in different contexts since assemblage variabil- ity reflects functional, depositional, and taphonomic proc- esses. For this reason, archaeologists acknowledge that study of assemblage content patterning is important both to distinguish between discard modes and to understand the "behavioral context" in which sites form (Binford 1976: 340; Newell 1986: 143). Nevertheless, the interpre- tive implications of differential discard modes have not always been pursued in household archaeology. As we have suggested for San Andres, simple exceptions to general domestic discard patterns may reveal activities difficult to elucidate or document in other ways. It was the marked difference in discard treatment of certain large, mundane items that initially suggested their special status. That this "special status" was of a ritual nature was suggested by the discovery of the three caches, indicative of a "meaningful association" of these items (Binford 1976: 340). Acknowledgments This paper is dedicated to the late Mario Mercado of Intiraymi S. A., killed in a plane crash near Oruro in January 1995. His enthusiasm for Bolivian archaeology was only part of his larger devotion to Bolivia, its people, and its heritage. His warmth, generosity, and personal interest in the prehistory of Oruro made our research possible. We were also aided by funds from the American Council of Learned Societies. Much assistance was pro- vided by Intiraymi S. A. and Battle Mountain Gold Com- pany. In particular we wish to thank from these corpora- tions Guido Arce and Marwin Columba. Our investigation could not have taken place without their support and personal interest in Bolivian prehistory. We are most grate- ful to Luis Guerra for sharing his extensive knowledge of the Wankarani complex and for help provided us by the Museo Nacional Antropol6gico "Eduardo L6pez Rivas" under his direction. Special thanks should also be extended to Pedro Flores (and son) for allowing us to work on his property. Marc Bermann is an assistant professor of anthropology at the University of Pittsburgh.
