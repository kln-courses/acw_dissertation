ABSTRACT The shearing and bending injury mechanisms of the knee joint are recognised as two important injury mechanisms associated with car-pedestrian crash accidents. A study on shearing and bending response of the knee joint to a lateral impact loading was conducted with a 3D multibody system model of the lower extremity. The model consists of foot, leg and thigh with concentrated upper body mass. The body elements are connected by joints, including an anatomical knee joint unit that consists of the femur condyles, tibia condyles and tibial intercondylar eminence as well as ligaments. The biomechanical properties of the model were derived from literature data. The model was used to simulate two series of previously performed experiments with lower extremity specimens at lateral impact speeds of 15 and 20 km/h. In simulation of lateral shearing response of the knee joint, an impact shearing force was applied to the knee element and the shearing displacement between articular surfaces was calculated. The predicted peak shearing displace- ment was 8 - 9 mm during the first 1 0 ms of the impact. This displacement is the main effect of the intra-articular failure of the knee joint to the lateral shearing force. In simulations of response of the knee joint to lateral bending load, the predicted lateral bending angle was about 8-13 degrees at 20 ms after impact, the corresponding strain of the medial collateral ligament (MCL) was 12 - 15%. The results confirmed that bending failure of the knee is dominated by the knee lateral rotation during the period of 15 - 50 ms after impact. The outcomes from the simulations are analysed and discussed in terms of the injury mechanisms of the knee joint. The mathematical modelling of the response of the knee joint to transient shearing and bending loads gives a better understanding of the injury mechanism of this body region in car-pedestrian accidents, and it is able to predict the risk of knee injuries corresponding to these two mechanisms. INTRODUCTION Since the 1 970s the importance and complexity of pedestrian impact protection in car-pedestrian accidents have attracted great attention in the traffic safety field. A recent study (Mohan et al., 1995) of pedestrian impact protection indicated that the percentage of pedestrian fatalities in traffic accidents compared to all killed road users still account for a major group in highly motorised countries (HMCs) (from 14% in the USA to 32% in the UK), and especially the proportion of the pedestrian fatalities is much higher in less motorised countries (LMCs) (from 33% in Indonesia to 47% in Thailand) than in the HMCs. Investigations of car-pedestrian impact accidents have shown that the head and the lower extremities are the most frequently injured body areas. Of all pedestrian accidents in the HMCs almost 90% occur in built-up areas and when the vehicle's impact speed is lower than 30 km/h. In these accidents, injuries to the lower extremities are the most frequent. Even though these injuries are not fatal they are still serious due to the long term consequences. During the past couple of decades the injury mechanism of the lower extremities, associated with car crash accidents, has been 3130</page><page sequence="2">extensively studied using different methods. Research on the biomechanics of the human musculoskeletal system has primarily concentrated on experimental studies. In vitro experiments have been carried out by several researchers (Aldman, et al., 1979; Bunketorp, 1983) to investigate the injury mechanisms of this body region. Cavallero et al. (1983) investigated the kinematics and injuries of pedestrians on the basis of tests with cadavers. Kajzer et al. (1990 and 1993) performed in vitro experiments with human subjects, and detected the maximum effect of either shearing or bending load to the knee. In parallel to in vitro experimental studies, Aldman et al. (1985) developed a rotationally symmetrical pedestrian dummy (RSPD) model to simulate the dynamic response of the pedestrian lower extremities. Based on the RSPD model, Ishikawa et al. (1 992) simulated the car-pedestrian impact event by using a mechanical dummy model and then analysed the influences of the car front structure on dynamic response of the simulated body segments. Recently, mathematical tools from the field of applied mechanics have been used to obtain a better understanding of the complicated mechanical behaviour of the pedestrian impact problem. Van Wijk et al. (1983) and Janssen et al. (1986) simulated the car-pedestrian accidents by using a mathematical model of a pedestrian, and then investigated the dynamic response of the pedestrian in the impact accidents. However, there are some limitations to the methods mentioned above. For the biological experiments one often has difficulty obtaining test specimens due to ethical problems. Some physical quantities are difficult, or even impossible, to measure when using biological specimens or mechanical models in the experiments. For example, the shearing and bending injury mechanisms were recognised in several experimental studies, but the process of injury inside the knee is still not completely clear. The mathematical models mentioned above lacked biofidelity for pedestrians as the model was based on a mechanical crash dummy which is used as a substitute for car occupants in car frontal crash experiments. Due to these limitations, there is a growing need for mathematical modelling of the human body suitable for investigating the impact biomechanical response of the body segments in vehicle crash accidents. In our current study, the computer simulation of dynamic response of the knee joint was carried out with a human lower extremity model to analyse the injury mechanism of this body region, and to predict the risk of injury to the knee joint in extended position from lateral impact shearing and bending loads. METHOD AND MATERIAL A 3D mathematical model of the lower extremity was implemented in the MADYMO 3D program. The model was used to simulate the experiments with lower extremity specimens to lateral impact loading. These experiments had previously been performed by Kajzer, et al. (1990 and 1993). The lower extremity model was built up based on the biometrics of the specimens used in the experiments SET-UP OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY MODEL - The model consists of foot, leg, thigh and part of the pelvis in combination with a concentrated upper body mass of 40 kg (Figure 1). The body segments were connected by the ankle, knee, and hip joints. The universal joint model was used in the present study to represent the hip and ankle joints. In order to describe lateral dynamic behaviour of the knee joint, leg and thigh segments were connected by an anatomical knee joint model. Figure 1 . The mathematical model of the lower extremity. Body Segments - The geometry, mass distribution, moment of inertia and center of gravity 3131</page><page sequence="3">of the body segments of the model were generated by the program GEBOD (Generator of Body Data) (Baughman, 1983). The GEBOD uses thirty-five measurements of human-body dimensions to provide data for determining the size of body segments, the location of joints and the inertial properties of each segment. To consider the effect of the soft tissue to contact characteristics, the stiffness of body segments were described by a force-deformation function. The data of yield limit force and corresponding deformation for each segment was based on the published data from human subject tests in which the tolerance level of the body segment was determined (Yamada, 1970; Viano et al., 1978; Viano and Stalnaker, 1980; Pritz et al., 1978). The maximum stiffness of the thigh segment used in the mathematical model was defined as 1 0 kN at 60 mm deformation. Soft tissue deformation of 40 mm was simulated with a compression force of 1 kN. The maximum stiffness of the leg segment used in the mathematical model was defined as 5 kN at 40 mm deformation. Soft tissue deformation of 30 mm was simulated with a compression force of 0.5 kN. The foot stiffness against the ground was considered. The maximum stiffness of the foot segment was set at 5 kN at 30 mm deformation. Soft tissue deformation of 15 mm under a load of 0.5 kN was simulated. Joints - Joint properties was described in three dimensions based on the range of the joint physiology movement. The loading response of the joints was defined by a moment-deflection function. Hip joint - Based on Kapandji (1970-2), the range of motion of the hip joint was defined as 120 degrees in flexion, 25 degrees in extension, 45 degrees in abduction, 30 degrees in adduction, 60 degrees in medial rotation, and 30 degrees in lateral rotation. The universal joint model with stiffness 0.9 Nm/° in flexion/extension and rotation as well as 0.5 Nm/° in abduction/adduction was used to represent the hip joint. Ankle joint - based on Kapandji (1 970-2) and Allinger et al. (1993), the range of motion of the ankle joint complex was defined as 25 degrees in flexion, 40 degrees in extension, 30 degrees in abduction, 25 degrees in adduction, 15 degrees in inversion, and 1 0 degrees in eversión. The universal joint model with stiffness 0.9 Nm/° in flexion/ extension and 0.7 Nm/° in abduction/adduction as well as inversion/eversion was used to simulate ankle joint complex. Knee joint - The basic geometry of knee joint in the present study is similar to the anatomical knee model developed by Yang and Kajzer (1992). The knee joint was described mathematically (Figure 2) by ellipsoids and planes. These simplifications are necessary for the implementation of the knee model in a commercial multibody system software package, such as MADYMO 3D program.

ACL = anterior cruciate ligament; PCL = posterior cruciate ligament; MCL = medial collateral ligament; LCL = lateral collateral ligament; CM/CL = posterior part of the capsule. The geometry of the tibial and femoral condyles were based on anatomical measurements, which corresponds to average dimensions of the knee structure measured in the experiments (Kajzer et al., 1990 and 1993). The skeletal parts of the knee joint included the femoral condyles, the tibial condyles and the tibial intercondylar eminence. The femoral condyles were represented by two ellipsoids. The distance centre between the two ellipsoids is 50 mm. The width of the femur condyle is 90 mm. The tibia condyles were designed as two planes which 3132</page><page sequence="4">represented the lateral condyle and the medial condyle of the tibia The tibial intercondylar eminence was represented by two planes to simulate the impact response of this part of the tibia articular surface. The height of the tibial intercondylar eminence is 10 mm. The width of the tibia condyles model is 84 mm. The menisci were not included in the knee model in the present study due to the complexity of modelling them, even though menisci can play a certain role in contact between the articular surfaces. Table 1 Length of the knee ligaments Ligaments Length (mm) ACL 35 PCL 38 MCL 73 LCL 50 CM* 55 CL* I 45 * CM and CL was assumed to represent the posterior part of capsule. The major ligaments and capsule of the knee joint were represented by the spring-damping elements: the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), the medial collateral ligament (MCL) and the lateral collateral ligament (LCL) by one spring each. The posterior part of the capsule is represented by two springs, one for the posterior medial part (CM) and one for the posterior lateral part (CL). The insertion locations and dimensions of the ligaments were based on anatomical measurements of the knee specimens (Girgis et al., 1975; Trent et al., 1976; Andriacchi et al., 1983) The dimensions of ligaments measured on the knee specimens show large differences. An average value for the length of the ligaments was chosen and used in the model as summarised in Table 1 . The ligaments consist of parallel collagen fibres and ground substance. The ligament strength is mainly derived from collagen fibres, and is also related to its structure as well as the viscoelasticity of the ligaments. To describe viscoelasticity of the material, different models of viscoelastic body can be used, such as the Maxwell model, the Voigt model, and the Kelvin model (Fung, 1993). The behavior of the ligaments in the present study was described by the Kelvin model. Table 2 The characteristics of the ligaments Force Rupture force Ligament per unit strain (Ņ) (N) ACL 3100 6330 PCL 4570 5710 LCL 3110 3840 MCL 5260 5260 CM 1000 CL I 1000 I The characteristics of the human knee ligaments were investigated by Girgis et al. (1975), Trent et al. (1976), Kennedy et al. (1976), Noyes and Grood (1976). The strength and stiffness of the ligament increase with an increased speed of loading. In these investigations, the highest loading speed of 3 cm/s was used in the study on the ACL strength by Noyes and Grood (1976). This loading speed is still lower than that in our study. Therefore, the ligament strength used in the present study was increased based on the investigations mentioned above and Wismans (1980 and 1985). The force deflection characteristics for the ligament elements used in the present study are illustrated in Table 2. Contact stiffness of the femur and tibia condyles in the current model is based on data from static tests by Walker and Hajek (1972). They carried out an experiment with four cadaver knee joints and measured the compression of the joints in axial static loading of 1500 N. The condyles were virtually stable at 2 mm compression of the tibia articular surface after 30 minutes of loading duration. A force deformation characteristic of 750 N/mm for each condyle interface was used in the knee model. The friction coefficient at the interface of the condyles was assumed to be 0.05 in the knee model, since the friction is small due to the synovial fluid lubrication. CONFIGURATION TO SIMULATE SHEARING RESPONSE - The simulation of shearing response of the knee was based on the subsystem experimental set-up with lower extremity specimens under shearing load (Kajzer et al., 1990). Experiment Set-up - In the experiments for shearing response of the knee, the leg specimen (Figure 3a) was loaded with two impactor faces: one just below the knee joint and another at the ankle 3133</page><page sequence="5">Ievel. In this configuration the maximum effect of the shearing force on the knee joint was obtained, and the bending movement of the knee joint was limited by the support behind the lower part of the thigh. The deformation of the knee joint was similar to that which occurs in accidents when a pedestrian lower extremity is subjected to a shearing force during the early stage of impact from the side by the car-front. The mass of the impactor was approximately 40 kg, and the impactor face was equipped with a force transducer for the registration of the impact force. The two impact speeds of 15 km/h and 20 km/h were used. Three marks were made on both the thigh and the leg. Each mark was fixed on the long bone with a small nail. The shearing displacement between femur and tibia could be estimated by means of high speed film analysis. During the experiments, data were registered by a digital system with prefilter of 1000 Hz. The motion behavior of the lower extremity specimen was monitored by two high speed cameras. Mathematical Modelling - The simulation set-up of shearing response is shown in the Figure 3b. The lower extremity model was placed in an extended position on a plane represented ground. The upper part of the thigh was constrained by a support in the horizontal direction and allowed translation in the vertical direction as well as rotation around hip joint. The distal end of the thigh was also constrained in the horizontal direction by a support and free in the vertical direction. The lower support was located 20 mm above the knee joint. The impactor was simulated by two hyper ellipsoids linked by a impactor arm. The weight of the impactor was defined as 40 kg. The location of the upper impactor was set below the knee joint level of 20 mm, and the lower impactor at the same level as the ankle joint. In this configuration, a pure shearing force was applied to the knee element by the impactor from the lateral- medial direction. The following parameters was calculated: the impact force, the shearing displacement between articular surfaces, the contact force on the medial side of the tibial intercondylar eminence, and the ligament strains. These parameters are the most important when assessing the shearing injury of the knee joint. The injury mechanisms to the tibial intercondylar eminence, the femoral articular cartilage, and the ACL ligament can be analysed with the results of the simulations. Mechanical Properties of Impactor - In the experiments, the impactor face was padded with Styrodur© foam of 50 mm thickness. The mechanical property of impactor was measured in a compression test of the impactor interface. The interface deformation of 25 mm was obtained at 4 kN compression force. In computer simulations the characteristics of impactor were based on this test result. Figure 3.

CONFIGURATION TO SIMULATE BENDING RESPONSE - The simulation of the bending response of the knee was based on the subsystem experimental set-up with lower extremity specimens under bending load (Kajzer et al., 1993). Experiment Set-up - In the experiments for the bending response of the knee, the leg specimen was loaded by one impactor face at the ankle level. In this configuration (Figure 4a), the maximum effect of the bending moment of the knee joint was obtained. The lateral rotation of the knee joint was similar to that which occurs in accidents when a pedestrian lower extremity is subjected to a bending moment during a slightly later stage of impact from the side by the car-front. The mass of the impactor was approximately 40 kg, and the impactor face was equipped with force transducer for registration of the impact force. The two impact speeds of 1 5 km/h and 20 km/h were used. Two lines were drawn on the thigh and the leg of the lower extremity specimens and used to make a high-speed-film analysis of the knee lateral bending angle. The knee lateral bending angle was calculated as the difference between the positions of these lines at each time step. Mathematical Modelling - The simulation set-up of bending response is shown in the Figure 4b. The lower extremity model was placed in extended position on a plane represented ground. The upper part of the thigh was constrained by a support in the horizontal direction and allowed translation in the vertical direction as well as rotation about hip joint. The distal end of the thigh was also constrained by a support in the horizontal direction. The support was located 60 mm above the knee joint. The impactor was simulated by a hyper ellipsoid. The weight of the impactor was defined as 40 kg. The location of the impactor was set at the level of the ankle joint. In this configuration, a pure bending moment was applied to the knee element by an impactor from medial- lateral direction. The bending response of the knee joint to lateral impact loading was predicted by the bending rotation angle between the leg and the thigh, the ligament strain, and the contact force on the lateral side of the articular surfaces. The computer simulation runs are summarised in Table 2. Each simulation was based on the subsystem experimental set-up at an impact speed of 1 5 km/h or 20 km/h. 3135</page><page sequence="7">Table 2 Computer simulation matrix Run Load Impact speed Impactor location Impact direction (km/h) 1 Shearing 1 5 knee-ankle lateral-medial 2 Shearing 20 knee-ankle lateral-medial 3 Bending 1 5 ankle medial-lateral 4 Bending 20 ankle medial-lateral RESULTS RESPONSE TO SHEARING LOAD - Two simulations with the lower extremity model exposed to lateral shearing load were performed, and the results are presented as follows. In the simulation at impact speed of 15 km/h, peak impact force to the leg was 2.1 kN (Table 3), The first maximum shearing displacement between the articular surfaces was calculated as 8 mm 8 ms after impact. The peak contact force of 1 .4 kN was reached on the medial side of the tibial intercondylar eminence.

The peak contact force of 1 .8 kN was reached on the medial side of the tibial intercondylar eminence. On the medial side of the tibial intercondylar eminence, the contact force was always higher than on the lateral side. Figure 5 shows a comparison of the time histories for the impact forces between computer simulation and previously performed experiments. The time histories of the impact forces from the experiments are available only for impact speed of 20 km/h. From computer simulations, the time histories for the shearing displacements, the contact forces on the tibial intercondylar eminence, and the ligament relative elongation are shown in Figure 6. RESPONSE TO BENDING LOAD - Two simulations with the lower extremity model exposed to lateral bending load were performed, and the results were as follows. In simulation at an impact speed of 15 km/h, the peak impact force to the leg was 2.1 kN (Table 4). The peak contact force on the lateral side between articular surfaces was 3.2 kN. The MCL relative elongation of 1 2% was reached at about 20 ms after impact, and the corresponding bending angle was 8 degrees. The MCL relative elongation of 20% was reached 45 ms after impact, and the corresponding bending angle was 15 degrees.

The MCL relative elongation of 12% was reached about 15 ms after impact, and the corresponding bending angle was 9 degrees. The MCL relative elongation of 20% was reached at about 38 ms after impact, and the corresponding bending angle was about 18 degrees. 3136</page><page sequence="8">Figure 7 shows a comparison between results from computer simulations and previously performed experiments for the impact forces and the lateral bending angles of the knee joint. The time history plots for the MCL ligament strains from computer simulations are shown in Figure 8. DISCUSSION This study was aimed at describing the dynamic behavior of the knee joint to lateral impact load by using mathematical models. In earlier experiments with the lower extremity specimens (Kajzer et al., 1990 and 1993), the injury mechanisms of the knee joint were investigated in terms of the shearing force and lateral bending moment of the knee. Internal knee damage1 was examined by dissecting the specimens after the impact experiments. What happened inside the knee during the course of the impact was not completely clear. In this case, a shearing "injury time window" and a bending "injury time window" were proposed. In each "injury time window", some particular time points were assumed to correspond to the observed damage of the knee structures. The time when the damage of the knee components occurs and the force/moment at the knee region were discussed only within the range of the "injury time windows". Durations of 30 ms for shearing response and 70 ms for bending response were assumed in the shearing "injury time window" and the bending "injury time window", respectively. In the computer simulations, analyses of the displacement and dynamic responses of the knee joint enable us to understand the failure process in more detail. A shearing displacement between the knee articular interface occurs due to the delay of the femur movement when impact force is transmitted through the knee joint. Analyses of the motion of the knee joint in the simulations of shearing response showed that when a lateral impact occurs just below the knee joint the first response of the intra-articular can be transverse motion of the tibia condyle relative to the femur condyle. At the first stage of the impact the proximal end of the tibia was pushed forward in a lateral-medial direction, while the 1 In this paper, the term "damage" refers to the structural failures in physical models, the substitutes used in the impact experiments. distal end of the femur remains still. At an impact speed of 20 km/h, the first peak shearing displacement of 9 mm was reached 7.5 ms after impact (Figure 6), and at an impact speed of 15 km/h the 8 mm shearing displacement was reached at a similar response time. Further analysis of the high- speed-films from the experiments (Kajzer et al., 1990) indicated that the shearing dislocation of the knee in the experiments was about 10 mm at the same impact speeds as in the simulations. The shearing displacement leads to the stretching of ligamentous structures of the knee joint and a concentrate contact force between the medial femur condyle and the tibial intercondylar eminence. The knee resistance to the shearing displacement may primarily result from the contact between the medial femur condyle and the tibial intercondylar eminence. The peak contact force on the intercondylar eminence was predicted as 1.4 kN at 15 km/h, and 1 .8 kN at 20 km/h about 8 ms after impact (Figure 6). The contact forces result in concentrate stress in the contact facet of the intercondylar eminence and medial femoral condyle. The transverse fracture of the tibial intercondylar eminence and/or failure of the femoral cartilage may occur, when the stress exceed its tolerance level. These simulation results corroborated the findings of Kajzer et al. (1990) regarding the damage to the tibial intercondylar eminence. In their experiments tibial intercondylar eminence fractures were found in about 67% of the subjects. The peak ACL ligament strain calculated in the simulations was about 8% for an impact speed of both 20 km/h and 15 km/h about 8 ms after impact (Figure 6). The ACL strain level was the highest of all the knee ligaments, which means that the ACL might have the highest risk of injury under shearing loads. The failure strains of the human ligaments ranged between 13% and 30% (Butler et al., 1986; Trent et al., 1976; Kennedy et al., 1976; Noyes and Grood, 1976). The ligament failure can fall into three stages depending on the strain level of the ligaments. In the first stage when the ligament strain is in the range between 5% and 1 0% for the maximal strains during physiological extension, of which the 10% level is close to the lowest reported failure strains, the micro-fracture of the collagen fibres may have taken place. It could correspond to the micro- trauma of the ligaments. Ligament failure in the second stage result from the progressive strain level of the ligaments. The partial rupture of the ligaments 3137</page><page sequence="9">may take place when the strain level of the ligaments exceed the range of physiological extension. In the final stage, the total rupture of the ligaments occur, and the reported final failure strains varied from 13% to 30%. In this study, considering the simulated specimens from the elderly human, we proposed that the first sign of partial rupture of the ligaments can occur at 12% of the corresponding strain. When the strain is greater than 20% it is assumed that a total rupture could occur. In the simulations we noted that during the first 30 ms of impact the calculated ACL strain was under the strain level of 12% that results in ligament failure. A direct connection between the ACL failure and the ligament overstreching could not be found from the simulations. It is assumed that the ACL failure under lateral shearing load could occur due to a combination of certain level of tension and shearing force. Kajzer et al. (1990) reported that the avulsion or rupture of the ACL was found in up to 70% of the investigated subjects in the experiments, but the mechanism of the ACL failure was not described due to the limitation of the experiment set-up. The ACL failure phenomenon can be more easily analysed using computer simulations than by using experiments. Analyses of the shearing displacement of the knee articular interface and the ACL strain level in the simulations indicated that during the process of the shearing displacement the ACL was stretched with the certain strain level, at the same time a shearing force acting on the insertion area of the ACL. The shearing force caused the ACL avulsion from the insertion area. This is the reason why the ACL accounted for a major group of shearing damage in the experiment study. From the mathematical simulations, it appears that the ACL failure is not directly correlated to the ACL stretching and not in the form of a typical ligament rupture. In the simulations, the predicted failure of the tibial intercondylar eminence and the ACL occurred during 5 - 15 ms after impact to the knee , which confirmed the timing first failure in the shearing "injury time window" assumed in the experiments. In this shearing "injury time window" 30 ms duration was proposed to cover the process of shearing injury. The computer simulations in this study show that the duration for the shearing process is no longer than 20 ms after impact as the active shearing was over. In simulations of bending response of the knee joint, the impact level was chosen to be near the ankle joint at the medial side of the leg, which gives maximum effect of the bending rotation at the knee joint and the same bending response of the joint as in car-pedestrian lateral collision accidents. The calculated MCL strain was greater than 20% about 40 ms after impact (Figure 8). A high risk of MCL injury was predicted in this type of impact loading to the knee joint in the simulations. When the knee was laterally bent, the MCL is stretched by a tension force while a compression force is acting on the lateral side of articular interface due to the contact of the lateral condyles. The peak contact forces were 3.2 kN and 5.7 kN, at impact speeds of 15 and 20 km/h, respectively (Table 4). At this moment concentrate stress might take place at both the medial and the lateral side of the entire knee joint. The failure of the ligament components could occur first in the tension side due to the difference of the ultimate tensile strength of the ligaments and ultimate compressive strength of the bone. The most frequent damage to the knee joint by lateral bending found in the experimental study was avulsion or rupture of the MCL (Kajzer et al., 1 993). Figure 5.

The process of the MCL failure was further analysed with the time history plots of the MCL relative elongation and the lateral knee bending angle from the computer simulations (Figure 8). Two stages of the ligament failure, the partial rupture and total rupture, were predicted from these results. During the stage of partial rupture, the relative elongation of MCL and corresponding lateral knee rotation angle were: - 12% and 8 degrees at about 20 ms for impact speed of 15 km/h; - 12% and 9 degrees at about 15 ms for impact speed of 20 km/h. At the stage of total rupture, the relative elongation of MCL and corresponding lateral knee rotation angle were: - 20% and 15 degrees at about 45 ms for impact speed of 15 km/h; - 20% and 18 degrees at about 38 ms for impact speed of 20 km/h. 3139</page><page sequence="11">5.0 5 : 5 ; ; 5.0 , ; J ; : Simulation „ Simulation i Z 40 t --Test i y 40 „ í -"Test i ^ i I ! 1 i ž i I j i - j g 3.0 -j j I I ' g 3.0 ~jpr"' I j ] j 0 2.0 -ur'~&lt; -I- i i i o 2.0 -//"A-i i i &lt; i- 5 / A ' i i i i i «o I «'i - 5 E l/'i / A ' i i i i i - E «o í I «'i '' í i i ! - 1.0 I j j - E 1.0 j. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 Time (ms) Time (ms) _ 30 ; ; j ; ~ 30 ; ; ; 1 25 LI Simulation! j | 25 i l Simulatici i . 0 Test 4^ - - Test ^ ^ ~o ! : : ^ © 20 i ' i ' X* " © 20 i j i y.ó/r... ?

The time histories of the MCL relative elongation from the simulations of knee bending response, (a) at impact speed of 15 km/h, (b) at impact speed of 20 km/h. These results indicated that the bending injuries of the knee joint are dominated by the knee rotation during the period of 15 - 50 ms after impact at a speed of 15 - 20 km/h. The range of the knee rotation angle was 8-18 degrees, and the failure strain of the MCL was 1 2 - 20%. It is necessary to mention that neither a pure shearing nor a bending load is ever likely to take place in real accidents, where a combination of shearing force and bending moment is common. In this study the shearing and bending response of the knee joint to lateral impact was simulated separately 3140</page><page sequence="12">to better understand the injury mechanisms of the knee. In car-pedestrian crash accidents, the pedestrians are often struck from the side by the front structure of a vehicle when crossing a street in a more or less perpendicular direction. The injuries to the knee region by the lateral impact force are observed frequently in those accidents. For the leg first impacted by the bumper, the knee injuries are often in the form of intercondylar eminence fracture, ACL failure, and MCL failure. The intercondylar eminence fracture and ACL failure are attributed to the lateral shearing force acting on the articular interface, and the MCL failure is correlated to the lateral bending moment during the impact by the bumper (Kajzer et al., 1990 and 1993). From the simulations it appears that shearing injuries to the knee joint can occur very early after the impact at time when the bending effect is very limited. Injuries to the knee correlated with bending can occur first at about 20 ms after impact. The behavior of the knee at impact depends on its geometry and the mechanical property of the ligamentous and bone structure. It is necessary to set up the mathematical model of human body segments with appropriate configuration and material characteristics. However, the limitation of the mathematical knee modelling still exists due to the lack of experimental data needed to determine model parameters. The living tissues are more complex in both structure and behavior than engineering materials. Reasonable simplification for the mathematical model is a common solution in modelling. In the present study, the knee model was constructed with main functional components under simulated impact condition, therefore it can meet the needs of simulating the dynamic response to the lateral impact loading. The ligament tissue is a viscoelastic material which is strain-rate sensitive. The ligament increases in strength and stiffness with an increased speed of loading. Kennedy et al. (1 976) found an almost 50% increase in the load to failure when the loading speed was increased fourfold from 0.208 cm/s to 0.833 cm/s during tensile testing of the knee joint ligaments. In the case of lateral impact to the leg, the knee joint ligaments are exposed to a loading speed much higher than in the study performed by Kennedy et al (1976). In this study the ligament loading speed (extension rate) can be estimated as high as about 50 cm/s. The available data from the literature of the ligament strength are limited by the difference of the loading speeds. Scaling of the ligament strength is necessary for study of the ligament response at high loading speeds. CONCLUSIONS Shearing and bending injury mechanisms of the knee can be investigate with the current knee joint model. The following injury-related parameters can be analysed: shearing displacement, shearing force, lateral bending angle, ligament strain (the ACL for shearing and the MCL for bending), and contact force between articular structures. At a lateral impact speed of 15 - 20 km/h, the shearing displacement between articular surfaces is about 1 0 mm and takes place during the first phase of impact. In our subsystem tests it occurred in the first 1 0 ms. Shearing injuries of the knee joint are dominated by this displacement during the first 20 ms of the impact. The lateral bending angle of the knee at an impact speed of 1 5 - 20 km/h is about 8-13 degree 20 ms after impact in our subsystem tests, the corresponding MCL strain was 12 - 15%. Bending injuries of the knee are dominated by the bending rotation 15 - 50 ms after impact. The current study shows that the mathematical modelling of the knee joint can be used to predict even unknown responses to the impact load, such as relative motion between the articular surfaces and the ligament strain. The mathematical model of lower extremity can be a useful tool to optimize the design of the car front in terms of shape and materials to reduce its aggressiveness against the pedestrian leg.
