<plain_text><page sequence="1">CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA L'ANCIENNE CIVILISATION DES BARREALES DU NORD-OUEST Argentin. (Ars Americana II.) By S. Debendetti. Paris: G. van Oest 1931. 14 X 11 inches; 56 -j-lxviii pciges; illustrations and sketch-map. 350 fr. This is the second monograph of the Ars Americana series, and is published in the same form, and illustrated with the same sumptuousness as the first on the Archaeology of the Amazon Basin, recently reviewed in the Journal. It consists essentially of sixty-eight plates, all of which, except the first two, illustrate the pottery and objects of stone, bone, and metal discovered in pre-Hispanic cemeteries, on two sites?La Cienaga and La Aguada?in the Catamarca province of North-West Argentine. No less than fifty-five of the plates are devoted to the pottery, eight of them coloured. The production of these illus? trations merits high praise. The plates are preceded by a short introduction in which a general account is given of the site and exploration, with illustrations in black and white of the designs ornamenting the pottery. The first two plates show the nature of the country where the sites explored are situated. It is now a desert region, characterized by dead forest to which the term Barreales is applied. There was nothing on the surface to indicate the archaeological treasures buried beneath it, and brought to light by exploration during the years 1925-29. Some five thousand specimens were obtained, now in the private collection of Sr. Barretto, under whose care the archaeological expeditions were carried out. All the pottery is of a funerary character. It is very varied and the types differ fundamentally from those already known to Argentine archaeology. It shows characteristics of style restricted to a single culture and a single art. Most of the pottery is black, but some is coloured. In some cases the outer surface is polished, probably with graphite, before firing. The decoration is geometrical, zoomorphic, and anthropomorphic, the latter highly stylized. Modelling is shown in vases of animal and human form. This ancient pottery must be assigned a high place in the scale of values of the discoveries made in the Argentine. "The material is so fine, the walls so thin, the firing so perfect that many specimens when struck</page><page sequence="2">CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA 479 sound like porcelain. We cannot help admiring the perfection of form, the regu- larity of the technique and the accuracy of execution, when we remember that these ancient potters were unacquainted. with the wheel." Stone vases are ornamented with anthropomorphic forms in relief. The metal objects, few in number, are of copper and gold, the former east, the latter laminated. There is a map of the Argentine showing the situation of the sites explored, a detailed description of the plates, and a Bibliography. The only criticism to be offered is of the price, which must make the volume prohibitive to almost all except public bodies. E. A. P.</page></plain_text>
