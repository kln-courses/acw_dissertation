<plain_text><page sequence="1">Doric Measure and Architectural Design 1: The Evidence of the Relief from Salamis MARK WILSON JONES Abstract Modern understanding of the design of ancient buildings, sculptures, and other artifacts depends in part on being able to identify the system of linear measurement utilized at the time. But while numer- ous examples of measuring instruments and standards inscribed in stone have been recovered from the Egyptian and Roman periods in particular, the scarcity of documentary evidence for the Greek world is re- flected in a bewildering and often conflicting range of opinion. The induction of metrical units from surveys, buildings, or urban layouts cannot provide unequivo- cal results, and consensus is accordingly lacking, both about the number of different feet used by the Greeks, and regarding their individual lengths. This paper focuses on the metrological relief recently discovered on the island of Salamis, which is only the second known example of its kind. On the basis of a fresh survey it can be shown that, contrary to previous discussion, the slab records the so-called Doric foot of ca. 327 mm, thus providing the first firm evidence for the very existence of this unit. An attempt is then made to reconstruct the original form of the relief on the basis of symmetry, leading to the hypothesis that first, despite differences, the proportions of the figure were governed by simple mathematical ratios comparable with those of Vitruvian Man, and second, the relief fa- cilitated the comparison of the Doric foot with the so- called Attic foot and the Egyptian royal cubit by means of convenient conversion factors. The conclusion re- views the implications with regard to the study of the architecture of the Classical period.* Ancient art and architecture were steeped in math- ematical harmony. Today this issue is either consid- ered tangential to the experience of beauty or is con- ceived almost exclusively in terms of proportion and geometry. But for the Greeks and Romans, these went hand in hand with measure and number. Only when proportion, geometry, measure, and number acted in unison was it possible to achieve true mathemati- cal harmony, or symmetria, literally "the coming to- gether of measure(s)."' The question of measure is especially important to architecture and allied disci- plines in which production is governed by design, for this entails instructions that are necessarily ex- pressed in quantities. If logic did not tell us this by it- self, the point is amply confirmed by sources as differ- ent as Greek constructional specifications and the theoretical writings of Vitruvius. So to understand the design of an ancient building, it is important to know the system of measurement utilized at the time. The fact that the Roman foot was so widespread, and is so abundantly documented, provides a welcome foundation to the study of design in this period.2 All manner of Roman buildings can be seen to display clear patterns of commensuration.3 On the basis of dimensional standardization, it is possible to discern how the majority of imperial architects defined the proportions of Corinthian and composite columns.4 And although the question of measure was arguably less important where geometry came to the fore, be- cause the irrational ratios generated tend not to favor dimensional simplicity, disparate geometrical progres- sions departed from a metrically simple starting point.5 Greek metrology rests by comparison on shifting sands. The relation between different types of units is clear enough-for example, that the cubit or elle (pechus) is 11/2 times the foot (pous), these being respectively subdivided into 24 and 16 fingers or digits (dactyloi) - but consensus is lacking both about the number of different feet in use and their individual lengths. Whereas Roman metrology can be established by various types of measurement (based principally on measuring rods, representations of the same at full size on architects' and surveyors' tombs, and the dis- tances between roadway milestones), none of these are available in the Greek context. Already in the 16th century the foremost architects in Rome knew of excellent approximations to the length of the an- cient Roman foot. Baldassare Peruzzi, for example, * I am most indebted to the Ephorate of Antiquities of Attica for permission to study and measure the subject of this paper (inv. 5352) in the museum at Piraeus.

Each box represents an indi- vidual sample, with the letter codes denoting types of unit as defined by R.C.A. Rottlinder as follows: F3, the Vindo- nissa foot; Fl, the Punic foot; C, the Roman foot; F2, the "Compromise" foot; BI, 16 digits of the Egyptian royal cubit. (After Rottlinder 1996b, fig. 3) left record on one of his drawings of a conversion fac- tor that yields a value of 295.9 mm, one that comes very close to the peak of the distribution curve asso- ciated with actual ancient measuring instruments (fig. 1).6 The contrast is painfully clear in Robert Hussey's 1836 publication on Greek and Roman me- trology; he was able to synthesize various Roman evi- dence in favor of the same foot value as Peruzzi's, but for Greek evidence he was left groping in the dark.7 All he could do was rely on literary sources such as Pliny (HN 2.21), who put the ratio between the Greek and Roman feet as 25:24, and observe that the value of 308.2 mm for the former thereby obtained yielded 100 feet for the stylobate of the Parthenon, thus explaining the appellation hek- atompedon.8 This unit, sometimes called the "com- mon" foot, continues to be uncritically cited as a statement of fact,9 although surviving standards of about this length are known to date only from Egypt and the Levant,10 and William Bell Dinsmoor in- sisted adamantly that this was a unit "which no Greek ever employed."" Given that little in the way of hard data has ap- peared since Hussey's time, the modern understand- ing of Greek metrology rests essentially on the in- duction of metrical units from the measurements of buildings. But this is a notoriously problematic activ- ity; witness the difficulties in establishing the unit used for building the Parthenon (Hussey's assump- tion has certainly not met with general approval)12 or, for that matter, with understanding how the term hekatompedon applied to it and other major build- ings.3" Whatever efforts are made to exclude assump- tions,14 it is impossible to avoid them. How can we be sure, for example, that Greek stadia really were 600 feet long, as their name suggests?15 The trouble is that the induction of Greek building measures is sub- stantially based on the investigation of Doric buildings and therefore on the premise that we know how they were designed; this issue, however, represents one of the most intractable problems of all architectural his- tory. The planning process had to take into account a variety of refinements and adjustments (principally those that flowed in the wake of the corner prob- lem), and these are so interconnected on the one hand, and are such a mixture of rote and experi- mentation on the other, that the hierarchy of under- "i WilsonJones 1988, 64-5; cf.

Con- versely in order to understand better the design of the Doric temple we need a solid grasp of metrology, so scholarship remains trapped in a vicious circle, like a dog chasing its tail. Opinion in recent decades has tended to polarize. On one side is the "reductionist" school, which ad- mits just three main foot units for the Greeks, of 294-296 mm, 325-328 mm, and 348-350 mm.16 Since they are thought to divide broadly on regional and ethnic lines, by convention-not by any means universal-these units are respectively called the Attic or Cycladic foot, the Doric foot, and the Samian or Ion- ian foot.'7 On the other side is the "permissive" school, which envisages that many Greek states had their own standards.Jos De Waele goes as far to argue that, in the- ory at least, every Greek building could have been set out according to its own distinct foot unit.18 It is tempting to conceive of metrology as an ob- jective science, but it is clear that a substantial dose of subjectivity underlies the interpretative divergence just described. This debate in fact reflects a much wider one over the extent of communality and conti- nuity in the Greek world. Do we see the Greeks as a united people, speaking just three or four main dia- lects and using just two or three architectural orders, or do we focus instead on the heterogeneity of hun- dreds of separate political entities, of which dozens potentially had sufficient autonomy to sustain their own system of measures? Historical parallels can be invoked to support either position; on the one hand there are the essentially standardized Egyptian and Roman systems, and on the other the variety associ- ated with the city-states of Medieval and Renais- sance Italy, with centers as small as Mantua and Vi- cenza having their own distinct measures. And since approaches to metrology inevitably reflect thinking about ancient design practice, it is hardly surprising that, for example, De Waele's interpreta- tions on this score tend to conflict with those ad- vanced by "reductionists."19 An important resource for this debate is the data- base, set up by Rolff Rottlinder, of physical premet- ric measures (more than 300 at a recent count), typ- ically metal builders' instruments and reference standards inscribed in stone, although the former are unknown for Greece itself. Rottliinder distinguishes between units for Aegina, Crete, Miletos, and Salamis, along with a "common" Greek foot, an "Attic-Olympic" foot (which differs from the usual Attic foot), and a "Byzantine" foot (fig. 2).20 The so-called Doric foot, however, has to date eluded capture. Some Greeks were certainly familiar with major non-Greek units, notably the main components of the pharaonic system. Open to question remains the relevance to the Greeks of an 18-digit foot, in the Roman context called the Drusian foot.21 When contemplating the implications of all this, it must be remembered that the physical discovery of a particular unit does not necessarily mean it was used for construction, just as the ab- sence of one, given the vagaries of archaeology, can- not be taken as proof that it was not. Against this background, research cries out for tangible artifacts. Thus an object now of central im- portance is the metrological relief discovered in 1985 built into the church of St. Dimitrios at Perivo- lia on the island of Salamis, and since displayed in the archaeological museum at Piraeus (fig. 3). It is only the second known relief of this kind after the fa- mous one at Oxford (fig. 4).22 With its anthropo- morphic design similar to that at Oxford, the new discovery eloquently confirms what is obvious from numerous texts, that ancient units of measure derived-or were thought to have been derived- from the human body. Moreover, the Salamis relief is arguably more important for metrological studies than that at Oxford, which may have had a primarily symbolic function. Although the Salamis relief has also been interpreted in this way,3" we shall see defi- 16 Dorpfeld 1882, 1883a, 1883b, 1890; Riemann 1935, esp. 1-6 and the tables; Dinsmoor 1961; Von Gerkan 1940, esp. 141-50; Gruben 1976, 447, s.v.

Meanwhile De Zwarte (1994 and 1996) claims the name "Ionic" for a unit of 298.86 mm and uses "Attic" for the 325-328 mm foot (for which he assigns the value 326.6 mm). 18 De Waele 1980, 1981, 1985, 1988, 1990a, 1990b, 1995, 1998.

(Courtesy Ashmolean Museum, University of Oxford) nite evidence of a practical application. In any case, it displays a wider range of standards than its cousin, including not just the fathom (orgyia), measured from outstretched fingertip to fingertip, and two types of foot, one anthropomorphic, one in the form of a rule, but also a cubit rendered as a disembodied forearm and a variety of smaller measures associated with the three hand outlines: two half-feet (hemipo- dia), two spans or hands or half-cubits (spithamai), and a two-thirds foot measure (orthodoron). Nor does the list end here, as we shall see in due course. Since it was first presented by Ifigenia Dekoula- kou-Sideris at the 13th Congress of Classical Archae- ology in 1988, and subsequently published in AJA, the Salamis relief has been the sole focus of articles by two other scholars, of an excursus to an article on the Oxford relief by another,24 while also being in- voked in support of related discussions. As pub- lished, it documents none of the traditional triad of Attic, Doric, and Samian units, but rather two or more noncanonical measures. That represented by a straight builder's rule was reported as 322 mm long, which is close to the Doric foot of ca. 327 mm, yet not close enough to be equated with it. Here, it seems, is potential corroboration for Rottlinder's conception of a family of measures linking much of the ancient world (fig. 2), for he claims that the Sala- mis cubit was derived from the progenitor of his sys- tem, inasmuch as its length corresponds to 28 digits of a 30-digit "Nippur elle," a cubit known from a bronze measuring standard found at this site that is datable to the third millennium B.C.25 The recovery of two hitherto undetected units would also seem to be "a key argument in favor of the 'permissive' line in ancient metrology, and a serious blow to the 'reductionists."'"26 De Waele does indeed regard the Salamis relief as crucial support for his argu- ments, while specifically associating the ca. 322 mm foot with the unit he supposes to have been used for the design of the Hephaisteion in Athens.27 Furthermore, the fact that the 322 mm unit is near to the so-called Doric foot, and yet not actually the same, may be seen as fuel for Rottlander's doubts over its very existence.28 THE SALAMIS RELIEF: ITS UNITS OF MEASURE In the summer of 1996, I visited the Piraeus museum in the pursuit of unrelated research and chanced upon the recently installed Salamis relief. Being curious to check the veracity of the not-quite-Doric foot rule, I laid my measuring tape over its length and read off, to my great surprise, not the published 322 mm but around 5 mm greater! Here then, after all, was a value entirely consistent with the accepted range of the Doric foot, that is, 326-328 mm. Had Dekoulakou- Sideris made a simple error of measurement or tran- scription? Well, not exactly; paradoxically, her 322 mm foot was also present. Because of the technique used to carve the relief, the value obtained from any of the representations depends on the way they are mea- sured. Unlike the Oxford slab, on which the figure is raised with respect to the rest of the block, here the 24 Dekoulakou-Sideris 1990; Rottlinder 1991-1992; Slap- sak 1993; Berger 1993.

(Traced by Manolis Korres and the author; annotations by the author) representations are sunk into the surface, with a depth oscillating around 4 mm. The crucial detail is the edge of the cuttings: these are not vertical but bevelled, with the width of the bevel generally varying between 11/2 and 21/2 mm. This means that the lower, recessed surface of any element measures 3-5 mm less than the point where it meets the plane of the block. Dek- oulakou-Sideris's measurements relate to the bot- tom of the cutting, leaving those in the plane of the block out of account. A review of the literature re- vealed that this feature had been noticed already, but in the context of a discussion, that only served to confuse matters further.29 To make sense of the Salamis relief, it is necessary to begin with a new survey embracing its detailed charac- teristics; accordingly, Manolis Korres kindly drafted with me a 1:1 tracing on acetate, an annotated copy of which is reproduced here (fig. 5). Since minor dis- tortions can occur, first in tracing and later in repro- duction, the principal recorded measurements are listed in table 1. The units in bold type were cited by Dekoulakou-Sideris, these indeed being the most se- cure, although damage is such as to render the orthodoron a "guestimate." Further potential can- didates have been added in normal typeface: "E," "G," "H," and 'J." Of this last group the first two, measured across the hands with bunched fingers, suggest themselves by their rough equality as well as the prominent attitude of the thumbs. But it is diffi- cult to be sure how these units were supposed to be measured; in particular, the one labelled G yields two sets of values according to whether one takes its maximum width (GI) or that measured perpendicu- lar to the outside edge of the hand (G2). Nonethe- less, it is curious that the former roughly matches half the foot rule (A) while the latter matches half the anthropomorphic foot (F). As for the palm mea- sured from fingertip to the junction of hand and wrist (H), it is impossible to define the transition from hand to wrist with any precision.30 Measuring to the recessed surface does not produce an accurate concordance between the various mea- sures, as Dekoulakou-Sideris herself noted. For ex- ample, a cubit can be extrapolated from the foot 29 Slapsak (1993) argued that the spread of possible foot values was so broad that, even if at its top end it does approach the value of the Doric foot, the slab cannot have functioned as a practical standard. o30 The comparable measurement on the disembodied forearm is too poorly defined for consideration here.</page><page sequence="7">2000] DORIC MEASURE AND ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN 1 79 Table 1.

Recalculating the cubit from the rule now yields 49114 mm, that is to say, al- most exactly the same as the forearm. As for the vari- ous ways of either measuring directly or calculating the foot (on the basis of the length of the span, half- foot, and orthodoron units), differences are con- tained within two-thirds of a millimeter except in one case, as shown in table 2. So the inaccuracy that has perplexed students of the relief so far, attributed either to sloppy craftsmanship32 or the theory that it had no practical function,3 in effect evaporates. If this improved precision is not enough by itself, there are other arguments for measuring on the face of the block. First, this is where the mason would have indicated the outlines to be cut at the beginning of manufacture.34 Second, it is only on the front, flat surface that architects and craftsmen could have placed rigid instruments or straight edges for cali- bration. Reading the size of the recessed cutting pre- sents no problem with modern flexible tapes, but we can be confident that most ancient measuring devices were rigid or semirigid. Thus the builder's rule (A) and its related units clearly document a foot of around 327 to 3271/2 mm, or the so-called Doric foot. Here is proof of its exist- ence, confuting those who wish to imagine it away. The other unit (F, G2), of around 306-307 mm (not 302 mm), may represent a local standard,35 or it might be 31 Alternatively, the variation can be expressed in terms of the foot values calculated on the basis of the measure- ments taken at the recessed plane of the cuttings, which are as follows: A = 322 mm, the assumed foot; B = 242 mm, yields 3222/3 mm (or 322 + 2/3 mm); C = 487 mm, yields 3242/3 mm (or 322 + 22/3 mm); E/Gi = 159? mm, yields 318 mm (or 322 - 4 mm?). 32 Dekoulakou-Sideris 1990, 449. 33The most puzzling thing about Slapsak's analysis (1993) is the failure to realize the implications of the bev- eled technique (described pp. 128-9) for the divergences noted (pp. 122-4, 127, 129). 34 Slapsak 1993, 129. 35 A similar unit (305.8 mm) has been induced for the theater at Epidauros, not far away by boat, on the eastern shore of the Peloponnese; see Rottlinder 1991. A 307 mm foot has been induced for the Parthenon, see De Waele 1984.</page><page sequence="8">80 MARK WILSON JONES [AJA 104 Table 2. Derivation of the Units on the Salamis Relief Inferred Approx.

So while the Salamis relief confirms the existence of one of the traditionally accepted triad of Greek feet, this is not to say that other units did not exist. In short, extreme opinions at both ends of the spectrum require trimming back in favor of a more balanced view. From what has been said so far, it is evident that the Salamis slab permitted notjust the verification of the "Doric" family of units, but also its comparison with at least one other type of unit. Since, however, it has been argued that the Oxford metrological relief had a primarily symbolic and decorative function, such a possibility needs to be addressed for the Sala- mis relief.36 However, the Oxford slab differs in sev- eral respects: the main figure has a raised profile that hinders measurement (the elevation of the chest prevents a straight rule from touching both finger- tips); the gabled shape of the slab may suggest that it was originally set up well above eye level and was therefore inaccessible; the artistic work is of rela- tively high quality.37By contrast, Roman metrical stan- dards, such as the one set up in the forum at Lepcis Magna (fig. 6) and others found in North Africa, are more obviously utilitarian, with straight elements comparable to the ruler of the Salamis relief.38 And the latter is significantly more serviceable than the Oxford figure as a metrical standard even as regards the anthropomorphic outlines: as mentioned, their sunken profile facilitates measurement, while the pro- nounced stylization aids definition (note for exam- ple the sharply pointed thumbs). We have also seen how the metrical consistency between the vari- ous measures (table 2) lies within reasonable limits of accuracy. So quite apart from any symbolic con- tent it may or may not have had, the Salamis relief was certainly an instrument of practical intent. The same conclusion is suggested by a fresh line of investigation inspired both by the disposition of the various representations and the measurements of the slab itself. Is it a coincidence that the horizon- tal axis defined by the center of the foot rule falls 11/2 Doric feet from the top of the block, while the axis defined by the fingertip of the extended arm bisects the block almost exactly (fig. 7)? The tolerances are around a millimeter or so, for the ruler and the edges of the block are not precisely parallel. At the same time, the height of the block is near enough to the length of the outstretched arm (L) for them to be presumed equivalent, and therefore nominally 788-790 mm.39 This is a curious dimension insofar as it is neither too long to be 21/2 feet of the ca. 306-307 mm foot, nor short enough to be 23/8 of the 327?2 mm (Doric) foot; the nearest fraction is 22/5 Doric feet, but this is not a whole number of dactyls. In theory it is possible that there was no signifi- cance attached to the block height, but this seems unlikely given that the axis of the rule, a datum al- ready defined as 11/2 Doric feet from the top of the block, is also one Attic foot from the bottom (294- 296 mm). The possibility of more measures coming into play is further raised by the fact that the block height and arm length are equivalent to 1?2 Egyptian royal cubits, a unit length both Burkhardt Wesen- berg and Eric Fernie detect in the overall mea- 6 Slap'ak 1993, 126-8. 7 Fernie 1981, 259-60.

The height of the block ranges from 789 mm (left) to 791 mm (right), with some high spots reaching 792 mm; the arm length, measured from fingertip to armpit, is subject to interpreta- tion due to the rounding of the latter, but can be esti- mated between 783 and 787 mm.</page><page sequence="9">2000] DORIC MEASURE AND ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN 1 81 C;4 722 8.8.7 8665 'Z4~ f Z3~23j' 12 26 857 2i2,I95IL 45 2 8,45 886 10 0 10 20 50 40 CM Fig. 6.

To confirm and explain such coincidences, however, it is necessary to attempt a reconstruction of the fig- tiure as a whole. THE SALAMIS RELIEF: A RECONSTRUCTION OF ITS ORIGINAL FORM It is now time to signal a shift of gears. What fol- lows is inherently speculative and, by comparison with what has been said above, far more subject to in- terpretation. The Salamis relief, being broken, cannot be reconstructed with absolute surety; nonetheless, certain assumptions are almost inescapable. Aside from the head, a symmetrical composition for the body and the whole relief can be confidently intu- ited on the basis of the Oxford example. As for the overall armspan, several factors converge on a single value. First, there is the look of the result, for the po- sition of the centerline has to be compatible with a head that is of reasonable width for the body. Sec- ond, an estimate for the armspan of around 2 m may be made on the basis of comparison with the Oxford relief.41 Third, a value of 6 feet is likely, not just be- cause the fathom was a standard Greek measure, but also because the armspan of Vitruvius's metrological man has the same dimension (De arch. 3.1); this yields close to 2 m (actually 1.962 m) using the 327 mm unit. Fourth, this particular value of 6 feet brings in its 4 Wesenberg 1974. Fernie (1981, 257-9) supports this hypothesis by noting that the ends of the relief measure 261.5 mm tall, or half a royal cubit. 41 Applying the ratio of arm length to chest width of Ox- ford Man generates approximately a 2.05 m width for Sala- mis Man based on his arm length. However, it is clear that the latter must have had somewhat narrower shoulders, for the distance between the face and the high point of the shoulder is substantially smaller relative to that on the Oxford figure.</page><page sequence="10">82 MARK WILSON JONES [AJA 104 / \ / \ /\/ \ / M2 \/ 1 AF \/ \/ \ IThroat :7= ISternum Umbilicus N\ M1 2/3 AF 315 DF 3/8 RC 3 COMMON FEET? = 50 Attic dactyls = 45 Doric dactyls 3 DORIC FEET = 48 Doric dactyls 3 1/8 DORIC FEET = 50 Doric dactyls 4 ATTIC FT = 3 3/5 DORIC FEET = 3 3/8 SAMIAN FEET = 2 1/4 ROYAL CUBITS Fig. 7. Analysis of the metrological relief from Salamis, scale 1:10, assuming an axis of symmetry consistent with an overall width of 6 Doric ft. measured from fingertip to fingertip of the outstretched arms, with the precise value calculated on the basis of a foot of 3271/2 mm (the value derived from the foot, cubit, hemipo- dia, span, and orthodoron measures highlighted on fig. 5). The annotated dimensions and proportions fol- low as a consequence. wake a quite startling series of correspondences, highlighted in figure 742 and listed as follows: 1. The measurement from the central axis to the outside end of the straight rule becomes 50 Doric dactyls (giving a total of 100 dactyls, pre- suming that bilateral symmetry was maintained on the other side of the body). 2. The arm length becomes two-fifths of the total arm span. This creates a modular scheme in which the 6 Doric feet armspan corresponds to 10 modules of three-fifths of a foot each, with the chest (measured from armpit to armpit) 2 mod- ules and the arm length 4 modules. The height of the block is also 4 modules, which helps explain the otherwise curious dimension of 225 Doric feet. The accuracy here is somewhat lacking, but the discrepancies remain less significant than those associated with the Lepcis Magna relief.43 3. Thanks to the fact that the margin from the tip of the fingers to the side of the slab is approxi- 42 The methodology behind the drafting of the illustra- tions was conceived so as to minimize the potential for error or manipulation. First, as mentioned, the survey (fig. 5) was traced on acetate, full-size, with Manolis Korres. Next, the result was scanned in a form compatible with computer aided design software (Autocad, release 14), and a line drawing created by "tracing" over the scanned image on another layer. Having then established by eye the notional ideal height of the block, all the lines and cir- cles denoting the ideal proportions were then generated by the software (using midpoints and endpoints of lines and edges, quadrants and centers of circles, and com- mands such as "offset," "copy," and "mirror"). 43 225 X 327 mm = 786 mm. This value compares better with the anthropomorphic arm length than it does with the height of the block; see supra n. 39.</page><page sequence="11">2000] DORIC MEASURE AND ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN 1 83 \\/ 11/8 I/ \ / 1/8 \ i HH/1'0 // \ / \ l \ L--------------.--------------- - - - - -.------...\ -- - --&gt; . --l-...--- - _--- - L ..........

Comparison of Leonardo da Vinci's adaptation of Vitruvian Man (left) and Sala- mis Man (right), scale 1:20, overlaid with the principal proportional relationships in terms of a 6 ft. armspan and height (H). mately 1 module, this scheme generates 12 modules (or 71/5 Doric feet) for the overall breadth of the block, that is to say, three times its height.44 4. The theoretical overall breadth of the slab translates as 2368 mm, or 4V2 times 526 mm, a value possibly identifiable as the Egyptian royal cubit. This theoretical breadth also corresponds to 8 times 296 mm, a value identifiable as the At- tic foot, although it is similarly slightly greater than the length usually cited for this unit. 5. It is further possible that the first and second fingers of the open hand marked 3 Attic and 3 "Common" or Salamine feet from the central axis (and hence a total span of 6 feet assuming bilat- eral symmetry), however the outline of these fingers is too poorly preserved to be certain. Taken together, these considerations suggest that the Salamis relief embodied an orchestrated metri- cal scheme for verifying not just the Doric foot and the 306-307 mm unit, but also the Attic foot and the Egyptian royal cubit as well. Let us now move on to a further level of specula- tion. Having seen that Salamis Man combined simple ratios with a 6 foot span, and knowing that these are characteristics of Vitruvian Man, it is natural to won- der if the former also responded to a proportional canon involving a total height of 6 feet. I do not pro- pose here to make a detailed comparison between Salamis Man and Vitruvian Man, since this would give an inappropriate emphasis to the latter; there must have been several Greek canons, and Vitruvius gives us a glimpse of only one of them-a glimpse that is likely to be not only a simplified version, but also one that suffers from textual corruptions. Leonardo da Vinci's rendition of Vitruvius's canon makes a useful basis for comparison for our purposes (fig. 8), de- spite the obvious anachronism, precisely because Le- 44At 203 mm, the margin between the outstretched arm and the side of the block is about 7 mm more than the value predicted by the scheme described. This is sub- stantial, it must be admitted. However, the surplus could have been matched by a corresponding shortfall on the other side of the complete original block, thus retaining the ideal unit values proposed here. Alternatively, the ideal di- mensions of the block were deliberately rounded off to 71/4 x 25/2 Doric feet as to facilitate execution.</page><page sequence="12">84 MARK WILSON JONES [AJA 104 onardo made a series of adjustments in order to gen- erate a more lifelike image.45 In fact, it is interesting to see that the bottom of the Salamis relief coincides almost exactly with Leonardo's adjusted level for the umbilicus, suggesting that this part of the anatomy could have governed the conceptual limit of the block. The two systems are otherwise similar in some respects, but they differ markedly as regards the size of the hand, the height of the breast musculature, and the level of the shoulders. The width of the torso, measured across the top of the shoulders, is one-fifth of the armspan in Salamis Man, as opposed to one-fourth according to Leonardo (and the Oxford relief, too). Such systems filter the pattern of life for the sake of mathematical neatness, with opinion evidently differing as to the specific ratios chosen. So while Salamis Man cannot be a direct ancestor of Vitruvius's, it is probably an earlier manifestation of the same desire to legitimate a metrical system by reference to a human archetype. The question of whether the Salamine canon could correspond to a canon used by practicing Greek sculp- tors goes beyond the scope of this study.46 I will con- fine myself tojust one suitable comparison, the famous bronze statue in Athens' National Museum that was recovered from the sea off Artemision and is thought to represent Poseidon or Zeus, or called sim- ply the "God from the Sea" (fig. 9).47 Dated to around 460 B.C., this work features a generically similar pose, with the outstretched arms and the bearded head turned to look along one of them. Its detailed charac- teristics (with the flexed knees and one bent arm), to- gether with the fact that the published drawings are not true orthogonal projections (having been based on photographs), mean that it is impossible to make a rigorous comparison. Nonetheless, as a percentage of the total, the height to the level of the shoulders, the breast muscles, and the navel are close to their equiva- lents on Salamis Man (assuming him to be 6 ft. tall). Once again, though, the hand of Salamis Man is much larger relative to that of the Artemision statue's. In short, Salamis Man may have corresponded to a sculp- tor's canon, but this was not necessarily the case. The mathematical neatness tends to suggest that sculptural concerns were subordinated to metrical ones. Is it possible to say anything about the likely char- Fig. 9. Line drawing of the bronze statue of a god found in the sea at Artemision, now in the National Museum, Athens. (Wiinsche 1979, fig. 17) acteristics of the Salamis relief in its original setting? It is reasonable to suppose that the various standards of measure had to be readily accessible, that is to say, placed neither much higher than the viewer's head nor below waist level. Therefore, Salamis Man must have stood more or less at eye level with an upright adult man. Acting within this constraint, it would have come naturally for the designer of the relief to fix the top of the block at an elevation of metrologi- cal significance. What better than to have located the top of the slab/head 6 feet from the pavement? Of course, very few men attain a height of 6 Doric feet (6 ft. 5 in. in the Anglo-American system), so observers had to look slightly up to Salamis Man. This means that the various small-scale metrical representations (the foot rule, the disembodied foot and hand) lay conveniently displayed within reach, with the ob- server's arms comfortably inclined either up or down. The lower part of this hypothetical "metrological monument" would consequently have been a double square with a height equal to 11/2 times that of the up- per slab, setting in train an extraordinarily comprehen- sive cascade of metrical relationships (fig. 10). Literally dozens of arithmetical ratios, such as 1:3, 3:4, 4:5, 5:6, 45 Vitruvius's text specifies that the distance between the throat and the hairline corresponds to V6 of the total height, but Leonardo judged this measurement to work better using the crown of the head instead.

Reconstruction of the original form of the metrological relief from Salamis, scale 1:20, with conjec- ture of its placement and context based on the assumption that the height of the crown of the head from the pavement matched the overall width measured from fingertip to fingertip of the outstretched arms. The annotated dimensions and proportions represent the calculated values that follow as a direct consequence. 9:16, and so on, could have been checked using such an instrument. We may reasonably speculate, as did Dekoulakou-Sideris, that other metrical standards were present on the left side of the body, and that these may have defined the family of measures associated with either the Attic foot or the 306-307 mm foot. It is also important to note that the precision attainable from measuring the individual outlines was proba- bly exceeded by that obtained by correctly dividing the larger distances established by their placement. From the lack of any line representing the silhou- ette of the torso, it appears likely that the body out- line terminated with the chest, floating freely as it were. However, other key anatomical limits could have been delineated in abstract fashion-as mentioned, the bot- tom of the block marks a plausible level for the navel. We can only guess how all of this was resolved in terms of materials and detailed design, and the possible role played by an explanatory inscription. It is rea- sonable to suppose that our slab was only a shadow of similar reliefs displayed in the Athenian agora. In such contexts metrological monuments are likely to have been made to more exacting standards of preci- sion, thanks no doubt to the use of marble as op- posed to limestone, perhaps incised lines, like those on the entasis template discovered on the marble walls of the Didymaion, and maybe calibrated metal inserts (a technique thought to have characterized the rules sunk into the metrological relief from the Roman period found at Thibilis in Algeria).48 The 48 Rakob 1974, 77; Hallier 1994.

Perhaps the official Athenian controllers of weights and measures, the 10 metrono- moi Aristotle mentions (Ath. Pol. 51.2), turned to just such a monument for public verification of the tools of their trade. AN INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM OF MEASURES? In one sense this reinterpretation of the Salamis relief goes against Rottlinder's conception of a Med- iterranean-wide network of measures (fig. 2). If the phantom (1V2 X 322 = 483 mm) Salamis cubit was re- lated to the Nippur elle, as he claims, by the ratio 28:30, then presumably the real (491 mm) cubit was not. Nonetheless, the general theory that metrical standards crossed national borders is strengthened, for the Salamis slab does seem to have encapsulated a veritable international metrical convention. If we suppose that the nominal dimensions mentioned above in Doric feet, Attic feet, and Egyptian cubits were those actually intended, then their use in concert confirms a set of relationships long since put forward as possible conversion factors, namely that 8 Doric feet equals 5 Egyptian royal cubits, and that 16 Attic feet equals 9 Egyptian royal cubits (fig. 11).49 Since Herodotos (2.168) gave the Samian cubit equal to the Egyptian royal cubit, and since feet correspond to cubits divided by 3/2, this is the same as saying that 16 Doric feet equals 15 Samian feet. Alternatively, the re- lation between all four distinct lengths (Attic foot: Doric foot: Samian foot: Samian cubit/Egyptian royal cubit) can be expressed via the following whole num- ber progression: 27:30:32:48.50 Having established the most conspicuous relation- ships embodied on the Salamis relief, one might ask ROYAL CUBIT 500 2:3 5:8 9:16 400 - SAMIAN FOOT 15:16 -- DORIC FOOT 15:16 9:10 2732 300--" COMMON FOOT 24:25 ATTIC FOOT Fig. 11. Hypothetical arithmetical relationships between the principal units of measure associated with the metro- logical relief from Salamis if the other foot unit, that of the footprint itself, also engaged in some similar network. A unit of ca. 3061/2 mm could have fitted one of two ratios with respect to the Doric foot, either 14:15 (in theory yielding 305.66 mm),5" or perhaps more likely 15:16 (in the- ory yielding 307.03 mm). While there is the tenuous possibility that a 306-308 mm unit corresponds to the "common" foot that Herodotos mentioned,"2 it might equally be identified as a local "Salamine" foot. 4 Von Gerkan 1940, 141-50; Bfising 1982. 5o Taking 327 mm for the Doric foot, this series yields values for the other units that are perfectly consistent with those generally cited: The Attic foot = 9/10o X 327 mm = 294.3 mm; the Samian foot = 16/15 X 327 mm = 348.8 mm; the Egyptian royal cubit = 8/5 X 327 mm = 523.2 mm. Using the 3271/2 mm value of the Salamis foot rule itself, this yields unit values of 294.75 mm, 349.33 mm, and 524 mm, respectively. 51 With such an imperfectly preserved artifact it would be illusory to try to decide between these options on the basis of the accuracy of the outlines. Their placement may offer further clues. It seems plausible that the outermost fingertip of the disembodied hand pointed out a fathom in these feet (figs. 7 and 10), but unfortunately the finger in question is too damaged to help us further with this par- ticular inquiry. The axis of the footprint (which has so far eluded explanation) lies about 3?2 ft. using a ca. 307 mm foot from the presumed center line. Furthermore, the hori- zontal axis of the disembodied forearm lies 6 Doric digits below the top of the slab, i.e., at a level equivalent to '5/16 of the total if the proposed reconstruction is correct, which is tantamount to 6 feet of 307 mm. In short, the 15/1 factor is the most likely option. However, it should also be noted that the alternative '4/15 ratio would extend the series of interrela- tionships just mentioned so as to make it 27:28:30:32:48. 52 If the 16/15 ratio applies, then by arithmetic the foot- print is also 25/24 of the Attic foot, this being the ratio which, as we saw earlier, Roman writers used to relate the "Greek" foot to their own, and hence also to the Attic foot, given that the Attic and Roman units are to all intents and pur- poses the same. In addition, Herodotos (1.178) tells of a "common" Greek cubit that was shorter than the Egyptian royal cubit by three digits. One cubit plus 3 digits equals 27 digits, and 27 digits of the ca. 307 mm unit corresponds to 518 mm; at 5 mm shorter than the royal cubit, the dis- crepancy is substantial, but perhaps Herodotos's approxi- mation was accurate only to the nearest whole digit.</page><page sequence="15">2000] DORIC MEASURE AND ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN 1 87 It is not my intention to make a claim for a univer- sally valid system. The fact that weights and measures were reformed on different occasions tells us that al- ternative equivalences must have existed. Another ratio than the one implied here (7:4 and not 16:9) seems to have informed the relationship between the Egyptian cubit measures and the Roman foot on the Lepcis Magna relief.53 The ratio 7:4 is also that between the Egyptian royal cubit and a foot of ca. 299 mm, which now seems to be definitely attested at Didyma.54 It may be impossible to establish which factor was dominant when and where, although it re- mains highly likely that attempts were made to inter- relate the glut of ancient metrical standards that exist in the ranges 512-530 mm and 290-300 mm (fig. 1). It might be speculated that the system applied on the Salamis relief was instituted as part of a spe- cific reform; Solon is thought to have carried out one such reform, and later ones have been proposed in discussions of the Oxford relief.55 The possibility that the Greeks could have recon- ciled their metrical system with an important standard like the royal cubit is quite consistent with textual evi- dence. As already mentioned, Herodotos believed that the Samian and Egyptian cubits were identical. A trilingual building inscription at distant Susa from the time of Darius (522-486 B.C.) demonstrates the international character of the workforce: The stonecutters who wrought the stone, those were Ionians and Sardians. The goldsmiths who wrought the gold, those were Medes and Egyptians. The men who wrought the wood, those were Sardians and Egyp- tians. The men who baked the brick, those were Baby- lonians. The men who adorned the wall, those were Medes and Egyptians.56 The various nationalities of builders had to coop- erate, and in any such enterprise it made sense to adopt a common measure, for which the royal Egyp- tian cubit, with its long ancestry, was eminently suited. We may also imagine that each group tailored its na- tive units so as to relate to it in a convenient fashion. Some degree of dimensional coordination may have taken place already in the seventh or even eighth century in the context of trade associated with the Naukratis emporium, but the participation of Greek military engineers in the campaign of Psammetichus II (595-589 B.C.) in Nubia57 would have provided fur- ther impetus to do so. At about this time the exploits of Antimedes, serving under Nebuchadnezzar in the Levant, inspired his brother, the poet Alkaios, to write: You fought alongside the Babylonians and won great fame, and saved them from troubles, killing a warrior man who lacked only a single span from five royal cubits in height.58 Poetic licence apart, would Alkaios have men- tioned the Egyptian measure unless it meant some- thing to his Greek audience? The influence of the Orient on Greek art and culture has for some time now been widely acknowledged, and there is also a growing awareness as regards the more technical as- pects of building.59 A design based on a metrical sys- tem derived from the Egyptian royal cubit has been argued for the monumental kouros from Samos now in the Getty Museum, an interpretation that gives some substance to the link between Egyptian and Samian measures that Herodotos mentioned.60 And if someone outside Samos had wished at some stage to create new units (or to have modified existing ones) so as to suit the Egyptian royal cubit, what was easier than to have divided it into 16 parts (the Greeks' own feet were divided into 16 digits), and to have taken nine for the "Attic" foot and/or 10 for the "Doric" foot?61 5 Hallier 1994, 2116. It has also been argued that the 518 mm Nippur elle related to the Roman, or ca. 296 mm, foot, as 7:4; see Rottliinder 1996a, 237. In this way the digits are in each case identical, there being 28 of them in the former and 16 of them in the latter. 54 Haselberger 1996, esp. 160 ff. Cf. De Zwarte 1994, 1996. It is possible that this ca. 299 mm unit was related, in more or less simple arithmetical terms, to the other units discussed here; calculation generates the following rela- tionships: 4:7, 6:7, 32:35, and 65:64, in terms of the Egyp- tian royal cubit, the Samian foot, the Doric foot, and the Attic foot respectively. 55 Crawford 1972.

Pheidon, the tyrant of Argos, was, according to Herodotos (6.127), "the man who established the system of measures for the Peloponnesians and performed the most ar- rogant action of any Greek, when he turned out the Eleians who manage the Olympic Games and held them himself." The reliability of this tradition has been challenged, particu- larly as regards the question of coinage standards (see Mac- Donald 1992, 71), yet Pheidon's foot has long been identi- fied with the ca. 327 mm foot (hence the name 'Doric- Pheidonic' foot) because of its perceived popularity in the Peloponnese and in Peloponnesian colonies. But if Pheidon did fix a foot standard, is the 327 mm foot the right one? Ar- istotle reports that under Solon "the measures used in Attica became larger than the measures of Pheidon" (Ath. Pol. 10), so there is a possible case for identifying the 306-307 mm foot with Pheidon and the 327 mm foot with Solon.</page><page sequence="16">88 MARK WILSON JONES [AJA 104 IMPLICATIONS FOR INTERPRETATIONS OF ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN For methodological reasons I have avoided so far the analysis of buildings, but it is safe now to con- front this problem with the physical artifacts behind us. Even though the Salamis relief by itself proves the existence of the Doric foot, it is yet worth adding rein- forcement, given Rottlainder's scepticism. Comple- mentary documentation comes in the form of the se- ries of little crosses Dieter Mertens observed on the unfinished temple at Segesta, crosses used for cali- brating the upward curvature of the stylobate. Spaced at an average of 3.26 m apart, they lend themselves most economically to intervals of 10 Doric feet.62 Then there are specifications and building accounts, where they may be compared with a well-preserved building, as in the case of the Erechtheion. It was on the basis ofjust such evidence that Dorpfeld was able to converge on the 327 mm foot in the first place.63 The simplest of all groundplans are circular or square freestanding structures, such as tombs or cel- ebrative monuments, for which an important dimen- sion is likely to be the overall external width.64 So, for example, it comes automatically to associate the 32.7 m external radius of the tumulus at Belevi near Ephesos with 100 Doric feet.65 At a much smaller scale, the roughly contemporary Monument of Lysi- crates (fig. 12) in Athens measures 3.275 m wide, or 10 Doric feet. Simple gridded plans of the type that were popular for Hellenistic Ionic temples in Asia Minor are similarly transparent. For example, the column spacing of the Temple of Athena Polias at Priene is 3.54-3.55 m, or 12 Attic feet, while that of Leto's temple at her eponymous sanctuary near Xanthos is 2.95-2.96 m, or 10 Attic feet.66 So no doubt the approximately 3.26 m column spacing of Hermogenes' temple at Teos, which fits very much into the same tradition, represented a module of 10 Doric feet.67 Of the various lessons that the Salamis relief holds for the architectural historian, one of the most fun- damental is the apparent ease with which an array of arithmetical ratios, each simple in itself, is brought together into a complex that is rich in interdependen- cies. Also important is its testimony in favor of a highly developed, precise, and conscious effort to relate dif- ferent families of units to one another. This lends cre- dence to analyses that have at times detected the use of two units in a single building (or sculpture),68 while at the same time it might explain how it is pos- sible for two or more rival metrological interpreta- tions to seem equally valid. One possible manifestation of metrical synchronism is the Monument of Lysicrates (fig. 12). While the overall width of the tholos, as mentioned, is 10 Doric feet, that of the podium, excluding the moldings, is 10 Attic feet. The height of the podium is 12 Attic feet, but that up to the base of the columns is 12 Doric feet. The column height is 12 Attic feet, or al- ternatively 12 Doric feet if it includes the steps imme- diately under the columns, and so on.69 This type of approach demands that the design of profiles, as well as the very existence of "negotiable" elements such as the steps just mentioned, be evaluated according to the metrical game. The combination of as many as a dozen or so distinct units has been read into the Tower of the Winds in Athens (although one has to suppress the unkind thought that the authors could get virtually any unit to fit if they so wished).70 In any event, the impetus was sometimes more practical in origin, as in the case of numerous Roman buildings in North Africa that were conceived in terms of the Roman foot but built by local builders using a speci- fication translated into Punic cubits; this is the con- text in which the relief from Lepcis Magna (fig. 6) had a practical application.71 The ultimate locus for metrical intrigues is of course the Parthenon. A number of different values for the foot have been proposed, most of which cor- 62 Mertens 1984, 34-5, pl. 33, insert 21b. 6 D6rpfeld 1890, 168 ff; cf.

In addition, the lower column diameter equals 0.330 m (1 DF) and the upper column diameter equals 0.295 (1 AF). 70 Rottlinder, Heinz, and Neumaier 1989, esp. 75. Rott- lander and Heinz have similarly invoked various units other than the normal Roman foot for Trajan's column (see Rottlinder 1996b, 16 ff.), but this is highly improb- able since the use of the usual Roman foot for Trajan's forum as a whole is incontestable. 71 Ioppolo 1967; Barresi 1991; Wilson Jones 1993, 408, 433; Hallier 1994.</page><page sequence="17">2000] DORIC MEASURE AND ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN 1 89 -- I ra I c u -- - ---- dLJ [1.76 &lt;thoto interior) 6 AF 2a.94 10AF=9DF i 327 (base of tholos) 1 F Fig. 12. The Monument of Lysicrates, Athens, ca. 330 B.C., elevation at 1:60, showing the principal dimensions in Doric feet (left) and Attic feet (right). (Bauer 1977, fig. 9) respond more or less with one of the units already encountered: the Attic foot, the ca. 307 mm ("com- mon" or Salamine?) foot, the Doric foot, and the Doric cubit; Ernst Berger has singled out a larger "Pro- portionsmodul."72 There are several instances where important architectural limits match whole numbers in three or four of these units: for example, the height of the order is 16 modules, 28 Doric cubits, and 42 Doric feet, while the height of the facade (ex- cluding the pediment) works out as 30 Doric cubits, 45 Doric feet, 48 "common" or Salamine feet, and 50 Attic feet. Given the diffuse preference for decimal and duodecimal numbers, it is unwise to underesti- mate the potential impact of chance, but the Par- thenon is not an enterprise where this word comes easily to mind. Might such "coincidences" be the de- liberate product of just the sort of metrical agility that found expression in the Salamis relief? Most monuments, however, were probably built using a single unit of measure, which returns us to the problem of appraising different proposals for individ- ual examples. Since it documents more than one type of foot, the evidence of the Salamis relief can in some instances cut both ways, as in the case of the Temple ofJuno-Lacinia at Agrigento. Mertens' analysis is pred- icated on a Doric foot, which, at 328.7 mm, is a bit longer than the version on the Salamis relief, but rec- ognizable as such all the same.73 Meanwhile, others advocate a foot of around 308 mm on the basis of a neater numerical sequence in some respects, this unit being similarly a little longer than the "common" or Salamine foot represented on the same slab.74 So both proposals have potentially equal claim to docu- mentary evidence. Perhaps we can escape from the either/or trap by wondering whether the architect worked with both units. On the other hand, there would be dangers of pushing such arguments too far, that is to say, beyond a few examples such as those cited earlier, which may be assumed to be exceptions to the general rule. The fact that the height and the spacing of the columns at the Temple of Zeus at Olym- pia are 20 and 10 Egyptian royal cubits respectively75 does not, in my view, tell us that this was the unit used for design, nor that the contractors were Egyp- tian. It is probably just a fortuitous outcome of choos- ing 32 and 16 Doric feet. This said, we may imagine that the architect, probably conversant with the knowl- edge displayed by the Salamis relief, enjoyed the met- rical "pun." In contrast to the Temple ofJuno-Lacinia, the evi- dence from Salamis can lend support to some pro- posals at the expense of others. A topical example is 72 Berger 1984, 123-5; cf. supra n. 12. 73 Mertens 1984, 98-108. 74 De Waele 1981; Ceretto Castigliano and Savio 1983; Hocker 1985-1986, 1993. 75 Riemann 1935, 56 ff., table 2.</page><page sequence="18">90 MARK WILSON JONES [AJA 104 the Hephaisteion in Athens, inasmuch as two con- flicting analyses of its design have been published re- cently, one by R. De Zwarte and one by De Waele.76 Refining slightly the value used by Herbert Koch be- fore him, De Zwarte opted for a foot of 326.6 mm, provoking criticism from De Waele, who instead pro- posed a value of 322 mm-invoking in support the (incorrect) published length of the footrule on the Salamis relief. In fact, the real value as we now know it better supports De Zwarte's proposal. Of course, metrology is not the be-all and end-all of interpreting design, but rather one important as- pect; there are other qualities to take into account. Strong evidence exists, as I will argue in the sequel to this article (Part 2), that the typical Doric temple of the classical period was inherently modular in character-and a module is not the same thing as a foot unit. From the testimony of written sources it seems that Greek architects associated a design mod- ule, or embater with a suitable physical architectural element,77 and it is well to question analyses that do not take this lesson to heart. Curiously, most recent interpretations put to one side Vitruvius's advoca- tion of modular design,78 a method generally thought to be applicable, if at all, to buildings of the Hellenis- tic and Roman periods. Nor has sufficient attention been given to the fact that in his system the module corresponds to the width of a triglyph. In my view this was the key to a method that was well established as early as the middle of the fifth century B.C. While the demonstration of this proposition is to be under- taken in Part 2, it is appropriate to briefly highlight certain metrological aspects that relate directly to problems akin to those already confronted here. On repeated occasions the metrical units, real or putative, that scholars have induced for Doric tem- ples turn out be simply related to triglyph modules. A representative example is the Temple ofJuno La- cinia at Agrigento mentioned earlier; the common denominator between the competing ca. 308 mm foot and Doric foot is the width of the triglyph, for this is double the former and 30 dactyls of the latter. As for the Parthenon, the real reason why Berger's Proportionsmodul produces such a clear pattern must be its identity with the nominal triglyph mod- ule used for the outline design. The fact that the ac- tual triglyphs are in reality about half a digit or 1 cm narrower than the theoretical ideal value (42 dactyls of a Doric foot a fraction under 327 mm long) should not blind us to this possibility, especially if we remember to make the distinction between scheme design and detailed design. Minor adjustments were an inevitable part of the notorious problem of resolv- ing the frieze at the corners. The definition of the triglyph module in the first instance seems to have depended on the same metrical climate that gener- ated the Salamis relief, and it is this that explains why the various units it records have been claimed for the Parthenon, each with partial if not complete success. The importance of modular design may seem to reduce the necessity of identifying the foot units used, but it is an issue that remains nonetheless fun- damental, for in the majority of cases the triglyph module was conveniently expressed in terms of famil- iar units of measurement, of which the most familiar were the Doric and Attic feet. The triglyph widths of medium size temples frequently correspond to either multiples and fractions of these feet (e.g., 11/2 or 13/4), or round numbers of their respective dactyls (e.g., 20, 25, and 30). Indeed, this is a not insignificant ar- gument in favor of the modular hypothesis; vice versa, if this proposal should come to be accepted, it would represent yet another argument sustaining the diffusion of the Doric foot. CONCLUSION To conclude, the metrological reliefs from Salamis and Oxford (whatever the precise purpose of the lat- ter) attest to the use or familiarity in Attica of the so- called Attic and Doric feet, the Egyptian royal cubit and/or the Samian foot, and one other unit (the 306-308 mm "common" or Salamine foot). While this is a tiny statistical sample, it is all we have. On balance, the evidence comes down on the side of the "traditionalist" triad of Attic, Doric, and Samian/ Egyptian units, while further suggesting that the in- terrelations between them were not only well under- stood but rationalized by means of convenient arith- metical ratios. There is, however, no need to be overly zealous in excluding all other candidates--after all, a fourth (306-308 mm) foot is present on the Sala- mis relief itself, while there is mounting agreement in favor of a 298-300 mm unit.79 No doubt other units did exist elsewhere in the Greek world, but it is likely that for major building projects the involve- ment of skills and/or materials drawn from outside 76 De Zwarte 1996; De Waele 1998. 77 Coulton 1989, esp. 86. 78 Vitr.

In short, to return to the historical parallel mentioned earlier, Greek metrology falls somewhere between the standardized ancient Egyp- tian and Roman systems and the heterogenous expe- rience of Medieval and Renaissance Italy, tending more toward the former than the latter. If the induc- tion of a foot unit from a building's measurements can be supported by other types of evidence, such as inscriptions or working drawings, then that is all well and good.80 Otherwise it is best to be circumspect; no longer is it enough to adopt metrical analysis to conjure up foot lengths that happen to suit precon- ceived theories about ancient metrology and archi- tectural design. 89 WISE LANE LONDON NW7 2RH UNITED KINGDOM MWJONES@EMAIL.COM Works Cited Ahrens, D. 1968-1971.
