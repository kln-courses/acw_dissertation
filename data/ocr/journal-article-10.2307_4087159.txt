<plain_text><page sequence="1">Life of the woodpecker.-Alexander F. Skutch. Il- lustrations by Dana Gardner. 1985. Santa Monica, California, Ibis Publications. 136 pp. ISBN 0-934797- 00-5. $49.95.-Alexander Skutch has been living in, and reporting on the avian life of, neotropical forests for over 40 years. His writings, reflecting dedication and an eye for detail, have contributed more to our current (meager) knowledge of the life histories of tropical birds than have probably those of any other living worker. In this book he has produced a non- technical treatise that focuses on the family Picidae, similar in many ways to his earlier book on hum- mingbirds. The book is divided into 10 chapters that consider major features of the life history of wood- peckers, including "the woodpecker family," "food, foraging, and storing," "the dwelling and the terri- tory," "daily life," "drumming, voice, displays, and pair formation," "nesting," "the fledged young," "social life," "usurpers, parasites, and predators," and "woodpeckers and man." The style is decidedly low- key: there are no citations in the text, little discussion of technical issues, and no systematic perusal of the species of woodpeckers. In short, Skutch has attempt- ed to produce a book of enjoyment and wonder rath- er than one that is probing and scientific. As a lover of woodpeckers, my reaction to this ap- proach is positive. Skutch is an astute observer, an excellent writer, and has organized the book in a relaxed, charming, and enjoyable fashion. The infor- mation presented and observations discussed are in- teresting, and references are rarely misinterpreted. Furthermore, the illustrations, painted by Dana Gardner and spread liberally throughout the book, are, at least to my taste, excellent. There is no attempt at completeness-a relatively small number of species</page><page sequence="2">July 1986] Reviews 653 is illustrated-but the portraits are elegant and ren- dered in a naturalistic style that I find beautiful. As an academic endeavor, there is little question but that the book does not, and indeed was not in- tended to, "boldly go where no man has gone be- fore." Yet the information is solid, and combined with Skutch's fine writing, makes a work from which al- most any ornithologist or natural historian can de- rive a great deal. Two shortcomings should be noted, however. First, Skutch's access to literature is clearly limited, and the majority of literature sources (listed in a "bibliography" section in the end) are strictly ornithological journals. Consequently, there are no references to the considerable number of recent works published in such general sources as Ecology, Animal Behaviour, Behaviour, or Behavioural Ecology and Socio- biology. Second, Skutch's approach is descriptive and often lacks a modern, evolutionary perspective and style; indeed, some of his anthropomorphic touches and anecdotes are reminiscent of some of this cen- tury's early bird popularizers (William Leon Dawson comes to mind). It is easy to be critical of such a style, but the result is a product far more entertaining, and (at least in Skutch's case) not necessarily less illumi- nating, than the standard technical journal article. In summary, this book would be a fine addition to any coffee table or community library and would make an especially nice gift to friends and relatives. It is not cheap, but the price is reasonable and it may already be possible to obtain it at discount from some sources. I recommend it to bird enthusiasts, natural historians, and professional ornithologists who would like a well-written, produced, and illustrated book presenting good natural history on what is certainly one of the most interesting of avian families.-WAL- TER D.
