<plain_text><page sequence="1">OZO TITLE-TAKING INSIGNIA IN ONITSHA EDITH MELIE * BETTYWASS The Ozo title-taking ceremonies are the means by which an Igbo man gains higher religious, social, economic, and political status.' In effect, it elevates him from a commoner to a member of the elite. In 1880, Adolphe Burdo observed titled men using articles associated with Ozo status, and in 1910, A. Tepowa described the ceremonies and their accompanying ritual articles. Since then several authors have analyzed the Ozo rites.2 Although the Ozo society is found throughout the Igbo area, our information pertains particularly to Onitsha, Nigeria, where members of the society are called the Agbalanze. In 1977, we asked thirty such titleholders to assess the im- portance of articles used in contemporary title-taking cere- monies. Our purpose was to record continuity and change in the array of items believed essential to the ritual, and to con- sider in general the importance of Ozo title-taking today. The city of Onitsha, known for the pomp and pageantry of its Ozo ceremonies, has been a prominent commercial center in Nigeria for the past century, though it appears to have greater antiquity. Because of its strategic position on the Niger River, where it is on the trunk route linking the eastern states to Lagos, Onitsha was the focal point of canoe and motorboat traffic bringing local foodstuffs from the Upper Niger and Benue valleys and the delta towns for distribution to various parts of the country. The natural geographic advantage has been further intensified by the ?5,000,000 Niger Bridge, opened in 1966 to link Onitsha and Asaba and provide a faster, more efficient transportation system. Onitsha continues to be the scene of rapid change resulting from advances in indus- trialization and communication, and from the growth of trade stimulated especially by oil resources. Changes in the commercial sphere of a culture are often countered by the reinforcement of traditional culture.3 Ozo ceremonies, for example, are more prevalent today than they were in the past. In 1944 Duffy recorded that 190 members be- longed to the Agbalanze society. From 1960 to 1967 (before the Nigerian Civil War), membership was about 150;4 between 1971 and 1977, the number more than doubled, growing to 360. In February, 1980, 511 members were recorded. Further evi- dence of the increasing popularity of title-taking is the inci- dence of such ceremonies. Prior to the colonial era, titles were taken mainly during traditional festivals like the new yam fes- tival. After the adoption of Christian holidays by the civil ser- vice, it became more convenient to do so during Christmas, the New Year, Easter, public holidays, and festive weekends. As demands for initiation increased, so did title-taking days. Today the initiation of one or sometimes two men is scheduled for nearly every weekend of the year, as well as holidays and some weekdays. The primary function of the title is to confer priesthood in the ancestral cult upon qualified Onitsha men. However, statements made by the thirty Ozo men in our survey indi- cated other reasons for title-taking besides one's eligibility to officiate as spiritual head of a lineage. They expressed political, social, and economic motivations as well: (1) to acquire a posi- tion allowing full participation in the politics of Onitsha, (2) to satisfy demands of relatives and friends, (3) to demonstrate fi- nancial worth, (4) to be benevolent and provide entertainment for family and friends, and (5) to make an economic invest- ment providing security for the future. Certainly, an important role is the exercise of priestly pow- ers. Ozo titleholders are expected to "break kola nut," the greatest symbol of Igbo hospitality, and pour libations of wine while praying to Chukwu (God) and ndimmuo (the spirits) at AN OZO MAN ADORNED WITH TITLE SYMBOLS, THE WHITE FEATHER (UGO) AND WHITE LEATHER FAN (AZUZU) HE IS PREPARED TO BREAK KOLA NUT AND OFFER PRAYERS IN HIS ROLE AS A TRADITIONAL PRIEST 65</page><page sequence="2">home, at village meetings and at social gatherings of ethnic significance. In this role, the titled man occupies an inter- mediate position between the people and the ancestral spirits. Since the kola nut breaking is a function both of seniority and of spirituality, the okpala (eldest son or traditional heir of a lineage) is strongly encouraged by family members to take the title. Usually family members also offer financial support to- ward title-taking. As an Ozo man, the eldest son is then in a position to pray to the spirits on behalf of his family and lineage. The title is also a form of investment. Each Agbalanze member is entitled to a portion of the fees paid by an initiate of his clan, or ebo, a patrilineal, residential, and political subdivi- sion. Each initiate pays two sets of entrance fees, those pre- scribed by his ebo and those demanded by the Onitsha Ag- balanze society. In addition, if he violates traditional practices, he is fined by either his clan or by the Agbalanze. The income that accrues in money, hot drinks, goats, and cigarettes is di- vided among titled members who are present at the time of sharing. Allotment is determined by an individual's relation- ship to the initiate. Thus, a titled man who belongs to the same clan as the initiate receives shares from both the clan's and the Agbalanze society's incomes, while the titled man who is not from the initiate's clan receives his booty only from that col- lected by the general Agbalanze group. In the past, some men depended on the proceeds of sub- sequent initiations for their livelihood. Today, because of the highly inflated cost of living in Nigeria, the dividends from other men's Ozo fees cannot sustain a titleholder, despite the frequent adjustments of fees. In any case, since the Ozo title marks a well-to-do person, the economic rewards of Ozo are regarded as a token. For others, however, especially the re- tired and the elderly, these dividends are still a welcome addi- tion. The Ozo title is a prerequisite for traditional political power in Onitsha. The highest official is the Obi (king), who has polit- ical, social, and religious power. He is elected to preside over the six ebos into which Onitsha is divided. Each ebo has an ad- ministrative head appointed by the king as a member of his council. The ebos are further divided into twenty-two wards or villages (ogbe), which have their own councils consisting of of- ficials from three groups: the okpalas; the Ndichie, the red- capped chiefs whose title is of a higher rank than Ozo and is available only to Ozo titleholders; and Agbalanze members. With the exception of the Obi and the Ndichie, the Agbalanze are above all others in Onitsha in social, political, and religious status. The prerequisites for title-taking are related to social caste, financial ability, and age. An Igbo man must be a freeborn citi- Second Third Rank Insignia Most Most Most Least Mean Based Items Important Important Important Important Ranking on Mean Osisi 21 7 0 0 3.75 1 Ugo 5 12 4 0 3.05 2 Okwa-chi 1 4 5 0 2.60 3 Nzu 0 3 9 1 2.15 4 Okpulukpu 2 2 1 9 1.78 5 Akpukpo-ewu 0 0 4 2 1.67 6 Azuzu 0 1 3 6 1.50 7 Ikenga 1 1 3 4 1.48 8 Okike 0 0 1 12 1.07 9 Ogbonuke 0 0 0 10 1.00 10 ORDER OF IMPORTANCE OF OZO INSIGNIA AS RANKED BY THIRTY OZO TITLEHOLDERS IN THE 1977 SURVEY zen, which means that he can trace his descent to an original Onitsha settler who was not an oru (slave) or osu (slave dedi- cated to the service of his owner's deity).5 (This practice is not in keeping with a 1956 law prohibiting discrimination against anyone who wishes to join title societies.6) The candidate must be able to finance the expensive ceremony himself or with as- sistance from supporters. It is difficult to assess the exact cost of title-taking. One interviewee said that the cost of the Onitsha Ozo was comparable to "millipede's feet," meaning that the fees are paid in several segments.7 Theoretically, the title can be conferred at any age, but most title-takers are be- tween forty and sixty. At that age, men are well established and have a comfortable livelihood, and they are given the re- spect accorded the mature and the elderly. Another explana- tion for the older age is that ideally a younger brother should not take the full Ozo title until his senior brother is titled. In practice, a man who acquires wealth before his older brother does can become a titleholder, provided the older brother is not the okpala of his lineage. Exceptions have occurred where an older brother who is an okpala delegates his priestly author- ity to the next qualified man who is more interested in ancest- ral worship. Having satisfied the requirements for the Ozo ti- tle, a candidate may begin the process of initiation into the Agbalanze society. The title is achieved in two major stages involving a chain of ceremonial acts that contribute to the "purification" of the candidate, sanctifying him for his future role as patrilineage priest.8 During the first stage, called Igba-Oko-nti ("scratching the ears"), the postulant notifies the siblings of his father's lineage of his intent to take the title by serving them palm wine. He next notifies the close patrilineal kinsmen, those considered the sons and daughters of his ebo, by paying fees prescribed by the particular ebo. The chief priest (okpala with Ozo title) of the patrilineage leads the prayers and sacrifice to the ancestors, who are implored to accept the postulant what- ever his previous conduct might have been. At this stage, the aspirant obtains some of the insignia of the Ozo titleholder as symbols of his religious role. These insignia are the okwa-chi, a lidded vessel; the ikenga carving, a symbol of the personal spirit (chi); and the okpulukpu, a boat-shaped wooden container with a domed lid. A male goat is then sacrificed to the ances- tors, who are represented by the okposi, a collection of wooden images. With this ritual, called the ikpa-mmuo, the aspirant formally declares that he has renounced all impure acts. The aspirant concludes this phase by providing an akpukpo-ewu, a goat skin, upon which he is seated by the Agbalanze of his patrilineage. In the future, the goat skin will be spread wher- ever he wishes to sit. From this first stage until the final initiation, the candidate is ironically called "Eze-Ozo" (King of Ozo). This is to say, "You have begun but still have a long way to go." An interval rang- ing from one to as many as twelve months of further prepara- tion follows before the final initiation, its length determined partly by one's financial state of readiness for the feasting and partly by the position one occupies in the queue of Ozo aspir- ants. Since all the members of Agbalanze are required to be present at each initiation ceremony, usually no more than one person can be initiated at a time. Candidates from a family may, however, be initiated together if only one compound is used for the ceremony. The initiation reaches its climax with the day of the Ozo dance (mmacha n'Ozo), the second major stage, which involves both religious ritual and social celebration. On the eve of the mmacha n'Ozo a vigil is observed in the patrilineal compound 66</page><page sequence="3">by members of the Agbalanze society and close relatives and friends of the initiate. In the presence of the okpala and the Ag- balanze members, the candidate pledges his solidarity to the society and reaffirms his vows of purity. In a dark room the Obi's emissary performs the ima-nzu, where the candidate is rubbed all over with white clay (nzu). As the candidate emerges he announces his Ozo name, receives the osisi (staffs) and wears his ugo (eagle feathers), all of which are indicators of his new status. During the night of the vigil, the Ozo candi- date does not see any women, including his wife, because women represent instruments of impure acts.9 Following the vigil, the status of the wife must be elevated in the presence of the ancestors before she can resume further interaction with her husband. To satisfy this requirement, very early the fol- lowing morning she presents a goat and a large smoked fish to the husband as offerings to the ancestors. In a polygynous re- lationship, it is only the senior wife who performs this rite. She and the rest of the nuclear family members then announce their own title names because they are considered to have taken the title along with the man. In mid-afternoon of mmacha n'Ozo, the initiate, wearing tra- ditional Ozo attire, is led to the shrine of the ancestors (ani), where he hails his forefathers and prostrates himself. Elabo- rate merry-making in the form of eating, drinking, and danc- ing to egwu-Ozo (music of Ozo) follows. The merriment comes to a climax with iti-obi, the dancing of the initiate among the Agbalanze. During the dance the initiate is embraced three times each by his eldest son, his eldest daughter, and his senior wife. These embraces are a public announcement of the resumption of social interaction with his senior wife and his heirs, all of whom have also been elevated in status. The Ozo rites constitute a purification and transformation of the man, a spiritual rebirth in which his personal and social identity is changed to enable him to associate more dclosely with the an- cestors. The Ozo Insignia Symbolic objects and special traditional dress are essential for enactment of the Ozo title rites. These insignia mark the social position, honor, and authority accorded the Ozo man. The thirty titleholders included in the 1977 survey designated twelve objects as important insignia in the rites: osisi, ugo, okwa-chi, nzu, okpulukpu, akpukpo-ewu, azuzu, ikenga, ogbonuke, otulaka, okike, and nzali. With the exception of the last three items, which are now rare, all must be acquired in order to complete the title-taking ceremonies. Excluding the otulaka and the nzali, the insignia are listed in the table in their order of importance as they were ranked by the thirty Ozo titleholders. 10 The subjects were asked to des- ignate one item as most important, one as second in im- portance, one as third, and to select two as least important. The order is derived from weighted scores that yield a mean ranking: the object designated as most important was weigh- ted as 4, the second as 3, the third, 2, and the least important, 1. For the last category some men selected only one item in- stead of two, and some felt that no item was least important. Since all of the insignia (except the few that are almost never used) must be acquired in the process of title-taking, it could be said that all are important. But because reasons for becom- ing an Ozo member vary among aspirants, it follows that a man would rate each of the insignia according to its relation- ship to his primary motivation, that is, the predominant role (religious, political, social, or their combinations) that each sees himself as filling. For example, if a man takes the title in order to become more eligible to officiate as the spiritual head of his lineage, he ranks highest those items with spiritual asso- ciations, like the okwa-chi, or vessel of god, and okpulukpu, another sacred vessel. If, on the other hand, the socio- economic role dominates, an item that readily signals aristoc- ratic status, such as the ugo, eagle feather, is ranked highest. The staff called osisi, which has the highest mean ranking, marks social authority and power, but it also has a spiritual as- sociation. It serves as the core emblem of office because its in- herent symbolism pertains to all spheres of activity significant to the man in his Ozo capacity. Conflict between the indigenous religion and Christianity influences the perceived roles of titleholders, hence the differ- ent rankings of insignia items. After taking the title, some Christian members virtually abandon the ritualistic items of insignia. This practice is common among those who work out- side Onitsha where the atmosphere does not lend itself to tra- ditional worship. Indeed, these men find themselves going back to church to show that despite their new Ozo status (by which they are designated ancestral priests) they are still de- vout Christians. This situation depicts one of the contradic- tions experienced by a culture that is struggling to maintain and enrich its traditions while, at the same time, adopting practices of other cultures. it.

Presentations will be limited to one-half hour. Proposals from scholars in any discipline will be considered, but the focus must be art-historical. Papers must not have been presented or published previously, and must be based on research in Africa. All abstracts will be considered by a panel of scholars, and those papers which are selected for presentation will be published following the conference in "Iowa Studies in African Art". Perception of roles is related to age and occupation as well as to the economic status of the titleholder. The younger and the more aggressive Ozo members with relatively high incomes are preoccupied with their money-earning occupations. Usually they take the title for socio-political satisfaction, that is, to demonstrate their financial worth, provide entertainment for the local people, and acquire the "power of speech" in city matters. While they are qualified to perform priestly duties, they may not be conscious of that role if their occupations take them away from Onitsha, where traditional practices predom- inate. Occasionally they come home to participate in the initia- tion of new Ozo members and to dance the egwu-Ozo. This ac- tivity calls for using the osisi, ugo, and azuzu more frequently than the insignia reserved mainly for religious worship. There may also be much older Ozo men in the lineages who oversee the traditional and spiritual roles. After retiring from work and settling in Onitsha, these members become well versed in the traditions and, as spiritual and political heads of their lineages, are more conscious of a deeper, complex mean- ing in the customary roles. Although they too participate in the social functions of the Ozo title, they do not regard an item like the osisi merely as adornment. Rather, they see it as a symbol of the spiritual immortality of their lineage. Elderly Ozo members do not believe in dressing elaborately, because that would attract attention; only young men seek the admira- tion of women. Items of insignia that are perceived to enhance one's appearance rather than to serve as instruments of wor- ship are therefore not highly ranked by older men. The object rated the most important in this survey, the osisi, is the staff of office for Ozo titleholders. Carved from the udala tree (the star-apple tree), it measures between 1.6 and 2 meters and has a diameter of about 7.5 centimeters at its base; it tapers very slightly at the top. Actually, two different osisi staffs are used, both acquired on the eve of the title-taking ceremony. For this occasion they are rubbed with nzu (white chalk or cal- cium carbonate) as a symbol of purity. One is decorated only with circular grooves carved at its upper tip and is called osisi- afulu (plain osisi); the other has groups of metal bands in- terspersed along its length and is called osisi-ona (banded osisi). The banded osisi has a decorative carving at the top. The plain osisi is used only at the initiation ceremony, mark- ing the initiate as different from other members of the Ag- balanze society. After initiation, the white chalk is washed off and the osisi is kept in the sanctuary of the patrilineage until the death of its owner, whereupon it is cut into pieces- symbolically severing the deceased from Ozo entitlements meant only for the living-and buried with him. Thus, the plain osisi is symbolic of the mortal nature of Ozo status and of the ultimate death of its owner as well. It is therefore appro- priate that the initiate holds the staff in the left hand, for the left is regarded as the inactive side of the body. A common oath among titleholders is "Cut my osisi"; in other words, "Take my life (if what I say is not true)." The plainness of the osisi signifies its perishability and also counteracts the aristo- cratic associations of the title. The banded osisi also functions as a religious symbol. It is held with the right hand and represents the immortality of the titled man's spiritual role and of the initiate's patrilineage. After one's initiation, the staff is cleaned of the white chalk, and some people polish it with wax. The object is kept at the sacrificial altar of the owner, where it receives its share of wine, blood,and feathers whenever the ancestors are feted. The banded osisi is not cut into pieces at the death of its owner. Rather, it represents him in the sanctuary of the patrilineage, 68</page><page sequence="5">where the staffs belonging to all of the deceased Agbalanze members of the lineage are kept. As a dress item, the osisi enhances one's appearance, adding dignity to its user. During initiation, the whiteness of the staff emphasizes the typical Ozo attire. Its vertical line runs parallel to the human body, enhancing one's stature. For the elderly and those who are not strong, the osisi also serves as a sup- port, especially during the Ozo dance and long walks. All Agbalanze men use their banded osisi during Ozo initia- tions and other traditional ceremonies. The metal bands jingle to the rhythm of their movements, producing a sound that is meant to be heard by the living and the dead. For the living, the osisi indicates authority by its thumping sound, which stands for a final statement or a command. For the dead ances- tors, it is a signal of the Ozo man's whereabouts. During the Ozo dance, as the heavy thumps of the staff resound to the rhythm of the songs, the Agbalanze respond in unison, affirm- ing the solidarity of their society. The banded osisi is rarely used during burials, nontraditional ceremonies, or everyday activities of a secular nature. Ugo is the name given to the eagle feather worn by the Ozo- titled man. It is also the Igbo word for the eagle itself, recog- nized as the king of birds in Onitsha, where it is a symbol of aristocratic status. The eagle stands for a "king" who is both a political and a spiritual head, a leader who has been cleansed and prepared for spiritual worship. The meaning of ugo is ex- tended to symbolize "dawn," "ripe," or "bright" as indicated in the saying "Our eagle is ripened" (Ugo anyi-achaa). When a person takes the Ozo title, his relatives are "ripened," for he has effected the "dawn" or "opened up" the sanctuary of his patrilineage. The lot of kinsmen who are already titled is said to be improved by the new Ozo man. The significance of the ugo is extended to Ozo members' wives. When a man takes the title, the wife is automatically cleansed also, though not to the extent that she can assume roles reserved for Agbalanze mem- bers. Two white eagle feathers pointing upward from a woven band are worn around the head during initiation, repeating the color and line of the white osisi. Like the osisi, the two feathers denote initiate status. Titleholders attach only one feather to the back of a cap of their choice. The ugo, ranked second among all items, is important as a mark of both social identity and spiritual purification. Because of its versatility, it is the most common insignia, conveniently worn for all occasions: village meetings, Ozo ceremonies, bu- rials, and all other traditional as well as some nontraditional but important activities. When an ugo is worn out, it is re- placed. The Ozo man wears the ugo as his emblem until his death; it then forms part of the burial clothing. The okwa-chi ("vessel of god") is a lidded container about 30 centimeters long in the form of a boat. 11 It is carved from any hard wood, such as that of the kola nut tree (iroko) or the star apple tree. Ranked third in importance in our survey, this in- signia functions as a spiritual object. In it are placed four carved balls called mkpuluchi ("seeds of god"), signifying the initiate's covenant with his god to uphold his new code of conduct. Thus, the okwa-chi binds him to purity of behavior. The okwa-chi is colored with white chalk and must remain immaculately white throughout its lifetime, with no blood or dirt touching it. During the Ozo dance, it is balanced on the head of a young virgin. Its whiteness merges with her white dress and the white attire of the initiate. The okwa-chi is kept in the sanctuary until the death of its owner; at that time, it is smeared with blood, split into pieces, and buried with the Ozo man's effigy during a second burial ceremony.

Carved of very hard wood, it is also boat shaped, but its finish is not as smooth as that of the okwa-chi.The okpulukpu is analogous to the banded osisi in significance. It too survives the owner, rep- resenting him after his death, when the vessel is placed in the custody of the patrilineal head. A patrilineal leader may keep several okpulukpu, all differently marked and representing the forefathers, whom he evokes in times of worship. Like the banded osisi, the collection of okpulukpu functions as a tally of titles bestowed on a patrilineage. Besides the spiritual and identification functions, the okpu- lukpu has a practical use as a safe for money, kola nuts, and the wooden stick images representing ancestors of the titled man. Because of its sacred nature, no one else in the house may touch the contents. The core purification ritual of Ozo title-taking is marked by the ima nzu, where a generous covering of white clay is applied to the body of the initiate. This is usually done in the dark on the eve of mmacha n'Ozo. In an exclusive sanctified ancestral house of the patrilineage, the king's emissary applies the nzu dressing while the Ozo code of conduct, based on purity of behavior, is recited to the initiate. The essence of purity in Onitsha is represented by white. This symbolism is repeated in the white chalk of the osisi, the white feathers of the eagle, the white paint of the okwa-chi, and the white garments of the initiate. Whiteness, according to Henderson (1972:251), "symbolized absence of the 'heat' of anger and hostility and the absence of contamination by female sexuality." The importance of the nzu is thus derived from the color, which cleanses symbolically as the chalk is rubbed over the entire body. The white clay constitutes the only covering on the upper body for some initiates; for others a simple white shirt or vest is worn. A white loincloth extends from the waist to the knees. When the initiate emerges from the sacred ancestral house he announces his Ozo name for the first time. The new name is associated with his elevated status and, with his new chalk- whitened countenance, conveys a mysterious aura for the on- lookers: they look upon the initiate as a priest who has deal- ings with the spirit world. The akpukpo-ewu, a hide from a male goat, is often killed dur- ing the first stage of the initiation called inyedo mmuo ("pacify- ing the ghosts"). After the required Ozo fees have been paid to the clan members, the initiate is led to the akpukpo-ewu by the okpala of the patrilineage who, in the presence of other Ag- balanze members, ceremoniously seats the applicant on it. From then on the skin is placed wherever the Ozo man sits; an akpukpo-ewu placed on a chair in a strategic area of the living room indicates a seat kept for the exclusive use of the titled man, who is usually the head of the house. The Ozo man's goat skin is a symbol of his pure life. A seat not covered with it is regarded as unclean for the titleholder; such seats are for commoners, who are considered to be impure. An Ozo man may own one or more akpukpo-ewu obtained from goats slaughtered during yearly religious sacrifices that he performs as a spiritual leader. However, our survey shows that not all employ the goat skin. Eighty percent use it during traditional ceremonies, and 73% use it at village meetings. El- ders and strict followers of tradition may be seen going to events with the rolled-up hide tucked firmly under the arm. It is becoming less common at Ozo initiations and burials, even though these occasions demand long periods of sitting. The popularity of goat skin is diminishing because it is not conve- nient to carry. Another item is replacing it: the younger gener- ation of Agbalanze members simply "wipe off" the uncleanli- ness of a seat with the fan (azuzu). The azuzu, another symbol of purity because it is used to clean areas for sitting, is a circular fan about 35 centimeters in diameter, smaller than the azuzu of Ndichie members, who are senior to regular Ozo titleholders in socio-political status. The fan as an item of Ozo paraphernalia is a recent borrowing from the Ndichie, but is now frequently carried by Ozo members on all types of occasions.12 The leather fan may be decorated with any motif except for that of the abani (a single-edged sword), which is reserved for the azuzu used by the Obi of Onitsha and his Ndichie. A titled man is particular about the design on his azuzu, as it is part of his apparel and a measure of his taste in dressing. The azuzu is also an implement of etiquette. When titled people meet, they "slap" each other's fan twice, first to the right and then to the left. This method of greeting is also ex- tended to people who are closely related to the titleholders, usually family members. The lightweight azuzu is held with the left hand while the banded osisi occupies the right hand. How- ever, in the absence of the osisi the user holds it with the right hand. The fan has borrowed some political significance from the osisi. An Ozo man who presides at a clan meeting may use the azuzu in place of the osisi to enforce order when disputes arise. This is done either by waving the fan, or, for more serious issues, by striking it against some solid object, producing a dull thud, to demand silence. More than one azuzu may be owned at a time, and the owner uses them at his discretion. At his death the azuzu is part of the Ozo man's dress while he lies in state. After burial, the fan may be inherited by the late Ozo man's son or a friend if they are members of the Ozo society. The ikenga is one of a group of carved wooden sculptures called okposi. 130 Okposi sticks, or ogbonuke, about fifteen cen- timeters tall, represent various ancestral personalities (includ- ing the collective ancestors) whom one invokes during prayers. Each male worshipper of the traditional religion owns a group of such forms. The ikenga is differentiated from other okposi by anthropomorphic features and horns. It serves as a symbol of one's spirit (chi). Two forms of ikenga exist among Onitsha Igbo. One is abstract and cylindrical with simple horns; the other has a face with round, full features and complex horns. The Ozo man uses the latter form. An attribute that is peculiar to the owner may be represented in the image. For example, the ikenga of a warrior may hold a machete, or a dancer's ikenga may wear a short skirt. This carving, used only by men, is believed to determine the owner's destiny. Therefore, when something beneficial hap- pens to the owner, the ikenga is greeted; but if misfortune oc- curs, it is showered with abuse. One's chi may be benevolent or mischievous, a help or a hindrance. As a personal god, it is influenced by spiritual relationships with members of one's age-set. During traditional ceremonies, the ikenga is offered its fair share of every food item, for it has to be pacified. Thus the ikenga is an instrument of worship. The reason that it ranks low (eighth place) in importance among Ozo insignia is probably because its ownership is not limited to members of the society. While it is considered necessary to the Ozo man as spiritual leader of the traditional religion, it is not an item that indicates Ozo membership. The wooden ogbonuke, like the ikenga, is a form of okposi. This okposi stick represents one's age-set (ogbo, age-set; uke, misfor- 70</page><page sequence="7">tune). The "age-set misfortune" image usually has a carved indentation or engraved marking in the middle. The object serves to remind the Ozo man of his age mates or comrades who are directly or indirectly concerned about his behavior, and it is feted during sacrificial offerings. In the past an Ozo man would invite friends of one's age-set to be present to in- voke the ogbonuke. At his death, members of the age-set broke up the image, thereby severing the owner's relationship with them. As these practices no longer exist, the ogbonuke ranks low in importance among Ozo insignia. Nevertheless it re- mains fundamental to the beliefs of the ancestral cult that con- fers the Ozo title. Some Ozo insignia that are disappearing are the okike (the elephant's ivory tusk), the otulaka (a small tusk from the elephant or walrus), and the nzali (a black horsetail switch). These insignia are less common, not because they are unim- portant but because they are rare and therefore expensive. Most of the very few okike existing today have been inherited from forefathers. Sixty percent of the respondents in the 1977 survey said they would use the okike for Ozo ceremonies if one were available. The object was considered important enough that it ranked in ninth place in respondents' assessment of the importance of insignia, even though it is not generally obtain- able. Ozo titled men carry the okike as a sign of their aristocratic status. Both the tusk, standing for the might of the elephant, and the feather of the eagle, king of birds, are elements in a theme: Ozo members are great men. During the Ozo dance amid the merriment of initiation, the horn is sounded to com- municate the presence of the titled men. The creamy white color of the ivory also represents purity; therefore the appear- ance and size of the okike is in keeping with the symbolic and decorative functions of the other white insignia. Another reason for the disappearance of the okike is that it impedes the movement of the owner. Formerly it was con- veyed to ceremonial places by teenage boys. With the intro- duction of compulsory education, boys are not readily availa- ble to render such services. The otulaka is a small ivory tusk with the same functions as those of the okike. Since it was smaller, in the past many more people could afford to buy it. Its present rarity, coupled with the fact that Ozo men have other accoutrements to carry, has led to its unpopularity and almost complete disappearance from the ceremonies. An item that is vanishing along with the okike and the otulaka is the black horsetail switch (nzali). Titled people waved the switch at village meetings to demand quiet or to conclude an issue. Its political function has been taken over by other in- signia, such as the osisi and the azuzu. The nzali is almost totally extinct, and an Ozo man who uses it is regarded as unfashion- able. The objects necessary in the Ozo title-taking ceremonies are selected by the men of Onitsha primarily for their symbolic rather than their artistic merit. Impracticality and unavail- ability are major reasons for the disappearance of some paraphernalia. The Ozo rite remains strong in spite of Duffy's prediction in 1944 (p. 36) that the European pattern of ideas and customs would eventually result in the disintegration of this Onitsha institution. The emphasis on preserving ethnic identity, as well as expressing status and affluence, would seem to indicate that Ozo ceremonies will be retained and may continue to grow as a vital part of Igbo culture for years to come.

Information in this article is extracted from Melie (1977). Data about the importance of Ozo insignia were obtained from answers to a questionnaire constructed by E. Melie and administered by her husband, Chike Melie, in 1976-77. The Melies, who are residents of Onitsha, have partici- pated in Ozo title-taking ceremonies for Mrs. Melie's father and other relatives. 2. Several authors have written about various aspects of the Ozo rites. Others who have described its paraphernalia in- clude S.R. Smith (1929), R.R. Duffy (1944), J.O. Nzekwu (1964), and R.N. Henderson (1972). 3. Several authors have observed this phenomenon. As an example, statistical validation of the increased use of indi- genous dress in relation to change in the political and eco- nomic power structure of another Nigerian group, the Yoruba, is given in a study of photographs spanning 75 years in Wass (1975). 4. The drop in membership during the 1950s may be allied to the negative influence that Christianity asserted upon traditional customs. 5. The early history of the people recognized as Onitsha indigenes is legendary. Anthropological sources (Nzimiro 1972:41; Nzekwu 1964:201; Smith 1929:5; Henderson 1972:76) record the supposed migrations and subsequent settlement of Onitsha by groups coming from two directions in the 15th and 16th centuries. The Igala-speaking people came from the north and were joined on their southward journey by the Awka-Orlu Igbo-speaking people. Together they found their way down the Niger River, mainly to trade and to seek safety from their slave-dealer chiefs. From the west, people migrated from Benin as a result of an alleged quar- CONTRIBUTORS DANIEL E.

These two waves of migration formed the indigenous elements that now inhabit nitsha Inland Town. They are called Onitsha Igbos and are dis- tinct from other Igbos in their traditional beliefs and cul- tural practices. Their cultural practices, which include the Ozo title, are believed to have emanated from both the Igala and the Benin kingdoms. The Ozo accoutrements seem to contain many Bini symbols which can be verified by examination of the bronzes of Benin (see Fagg 1963). 6. See Laws of Eastern Nigeria (1963:1-4) on the abolition of the osu and ohu (or oru) system. 7. Tepowa (1910) estimated the cost of Ozo entrance fees in Onitsha to be ?f,50-f,200 per title-taker. Duffy (1944) cited the cost of membership as ?f,200-f400. Nzekwu (1964) stated that initiation fees alone ran as high as ?700. The cost was ?700-?900 in 1972 according to Nzimiro (1972). It is not clear which expenses related to title-taking are included in each of these figures. Melie (1977:31) estimated the costs in the period 1971-77 in three parts. Fees for the ogbe (village) were N600-N2000. The Agbalanze fees were N400, and the cost of entertainment at the final event was N500-N2000. The total expense for the whole ceremony was N2000-N9000, or about $3,200-$14,000 (N1=$1.60). 8. For a more detailed explanation of the sequential acts leading to the Ozo title, see Henderson, Chapter 7, "The Ozo Title System: A Pathway to Self-Purification" (1972:247-66). 9. Henderson notes that whiteness and abhorrence of sex- ual contact with women are the consistently emphasized elements in the notion of purity (1972:251). 10. The ranking of some objects, an exercise requested as part of the survey, and separation of spiritual from secular meanings may be interpreted as an imposition of Western values on an alien experience. The authors agree that cer- tain cultural systems are to be viewed in their totality. However, the Ozo ritual and its contingent values are being modified and adulterated by Western influences. Therefore, an analytical method derived from a Western approach only provides detail toward better understanding of aspects of meanings as well as awareness of the exis- tence of a variety of ways in which Ozo members view their statuses, roles, and the accompanying insignia. 11. Justine Cordwell pointed out, in personal conversation, that the symbol of a stripped-down European galleon of the 16th century is also found in sacred plots of Benin City and its environs. The galleon shape symbolized the power of what had seemed to be the magical force of European inventions-great wind-powered ships being one of the most prominent of these inventions. The symbol is also found in the art of the Fon of Dahomey (now Benin Repub- lic). 12. The azuzu probably began to be incorporated into Ozo articles in the late 1940s or during the 1950s. Duffy (1944) did not list the azuzu among the insignia for the Ozo title but did identify it as property of the Ndichie. Nzekwu (1%964) includes the azuzu among Ozo objects. 13. For a major study of ikenga see John Boston (1977). Ikenga are also found among Igala, Idoma, Igbira, Bini, and other Edo-speaking peoples, and Ijo. Bibliography Boston, John. 1977.
