<plain_text><page sequence="1">Does Cigarette Print Advertising Adhere to the Tobacco Institute's Voluntary Advertising and Promotion Code? An Assessment ELIZABETH M. BARBEAU, WILLIAM DEJONG, DOUGLAS M. BRUGGE, and WILLIAM M. RAND AL F of all adult smokers take up smoking by age I 5, 9o% by age i 8. Those who do not initiate smoking H I-I il by age Zi are unlikely to do so thereafter (i). Recent national surveys estimate that 26-30% of I2-I4 L q, year olds have tried cigarettes (z). Unfortunately, t 9*4..5 after years of decline, smoking prevalence among high school seniors seems to be increasing (3). Cigarette advertising appears to be critical to the industry's success in recruiting young smokers. Tobacco companies spent $4.6 billion in I99I to advertise and promote cigarette use, $3z8 million of which was devoted to cigarette advertising in print magazines (4). While cig- arette advertising in magazines has declined as a percentage of total advertising expenditures, it has remained stable in magazines with large youth readership (5). Several studies have demonstrated an association between expo- sure to cigarette advertising and adolescent smoking behavior. Youth who respond favorably to advertising are more likely to initiate smoking than those who respond negatively (6-9). Young people who smoke or who report intentions to try smoking are particularly aware of cigarette advertising as demonstrated by their ability to recall or recognize specific cigarette advertisements (IO,II). Other studies have shown that young people smoke those brands that are most heavily advertised (I2-I5). In addition, the introduction of youth-oriented marketing campaigns appears to be related to subse- quent increased adolescent consumption of the advertised brands. This pattern was observed among adolescent girls after the introduc- tion of Virginia Slims in i968 (i6), among adolescent males after a 473</page><page sequence="2">474 JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY * VOL. I9, NO. 4 major campaign for smokeless tobacco that was designed to promote use by "beginners" (I7), and among persons less than age I8 follow- ing the launching of Camel's "Old Joe" campaign (I4). To counter criticism of its advertising practices, the Tobacco Insti- tute, a trade association that represents the six largest U.S. tobacco companies, implemented in I965 a Voluntary Cigarette Advertising and Promotion Code that places specific restrictions on advertising and promoting cigarette use among adolescents (I8). The I990 ver- sion of the code (i) proscribes any suggestion that "smoking is essen- tial to social prominence, distinction, success, or sexual attraction"; (z) prohibits any depiction of a "person smoking in an exaggerated manner"; (3) allows ads to include "attractive, healthy-looking per- sons provided there is no suggestion that their attractiveness and good health is due to cigarette smoking"; (3) prohibits depictions of "any smoker participating in, or obviously just having participated in, a physical activity requiring stamina or athletic conditioning beyond that of normal recreation"; and (5) requires that any models used in advertising be (and appear to be) older than z5 (I9). The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether con- temporary print advertising for cigarettes adheres to the Voluntary Cigarette Advertising and Promotion Code, as judged by how ado- lescents perceive this advertising. To do this, we showed students in grades 6-8 (ages IO-I5) a sample of recent cigarette print ads and assessed their perceptions of those ads against the tenets of the Code. Our general research question was whether a sizeable percentage of the students would report that the ads communicated to them that smoking leads to popularity, success, sexual attraction, physical fitness, and even good health. METHODS Sample Selection Potential study subjects were enrolled in grades 6-8 in eastern Massachusetts public school systems. A stratified cluster sampling technique was used to select a representative sample of eastern Mas- sachusetts schools. The strata were defined according to a classification of towns and cities developed by the Massachusetts Department of Education (zo). By this scheme, all 3 5I state municipalities are assessed on I5 eco-</page><page sequence="3">BARBEAU ET AL. * CIGARETTE ADVERTISING 475 nomic and demographic variables and then divided into seven homo- geneous types. Public schools were eligible for recruitment if they included grades 6-8 and were located in eastern Massachusetts (i.e., zip codes greater than 0I400). Of 230 eligible schools, i6 schools were selected at ran- dom, with strata representation proportional to the population of each stratum. We sent written invitations to the school principal or the district superintendent, as directed, and made follow-up calls one week later. If a school declined to participate, we randomly selected another school to approach from the appropriate stratum. In total, we approached z5 schools to achieve a total sample of I6 schools, yielding a partic- ipation rate of 64%. Refusals were evenly distributed by stratum. Within each of the selected schools, the school principal selected one class each of sixth-, seventh-, and eighth-graders to participate in the study. Schools had three options for obtaining student consent to participate, approved by Tufts University's institutional review board. Four schools elected to waive the consent process, seven required written parental consent, and five opted for implied parental consent (i.e., only parents who declined participation signed and returned a form). A total of 98I students were invited to participate in the study. Parental consent was denied in 68 cases, yielding a total of 9I3 sub- jects and a participation rate of 93%. Consistent with the demo- graphics of eastern Massachusetts, 36% of the study subjects were drawn from schools in urban centers, and z25% from schools in eco- nomically developed suburbs. Selection of Advertisements A report on adolescent magazine readership was used to identify the I 5 most popular magazines among boys and among girls ages I z-I 5 (Xi). We examined the September I994 issue (or, for weeklies, the issue for the first week of September) to locate cigarette advertise- ments. Ads were found in Ebony, Hot Rod, Jet, People, Soap Opera Digest, and Sports Illustrated. We examined the same magazines for ads of non-cigarette products that are typically consumed by youth. To be considered for use in the study, an advertisement had to include a photograph or illustration of a human model or an anthro- pomorphic character. We selected four cigarette and four non-ciga-</page><page sequence="4">476 JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY * VOL. 19, NO. 4 rette ("filler") advertisements, which were converted to 3 Smm slides for viewing by the students. Both the cigarette and filler ads included a wide diversity of models by gender and race. The selected cigarette ads were for Marlboro, Camel, and New- port, the three brands most popular with youth (I 5), plus Virginia Slims. Some of the ads appeared in several magazines. Because all cigarette ads are subject to the Tobacco Institute's Voluntary Adver- tising and Promotion Code, it was unnecessary for us to establish additional selection criteria. The selected filler ads were for Bacardi rum, Payless shoe stores, Wolverine boots, and Cover Girl cosmetics. These ads were included in the stimulus set to help obscure our particular interest in the ciga- rette ads. Questionnaire Administration We developed a self-administered written questionnaire for study subjects to record their perceptions of the advertisements. While some questions assessed the general appeal of the ads, most assessed the ads against specific tenets of the Voluntary Cigarette Advertising and Promotion Code (Table i). The intent was to capture respon- dents' perceptions of the advertisements in relation to the industry's voluntary restrictions, that is, to discern whether the industry adheres to the code as perceived by those it is supposed to protect. Through focus groups and pilot testing, we sought to ensure that the questionnaire items used age-appropriate vocabulary. In most cases, the questions included actual language from the Code. In some cases, however, the questions substituted terminology that our study population could better understand. For example, the Code states that cigarette advertising shall not suggest that smoking is essential to "social prominence" or "distinction." We replaced these words with synonyms such as "popular" and "cool." Using a set of four-point scales, we asked the study subjects to indi- cate their level of agreement or disagreement with a series of written statements about each advertisement (e.g., "This ad says that using this product will make people look cool"). We also presented the subjects with a list of adjectives (e.g., healthy, attractive). For each, the subjects indicated with a "yes" or "no" response whether the people shown in each ad are supposed to look</page><page sequence="5">fL. fL.

A set of open-ended questions was used to elicit the subjects' esti- mates of the ages of the models shown in the Newport, Marlboro, and Virginia Slims ads. The final portion of the questionnaire included questions about the respondent's demographic characteristics and smoking behavior, including current smoking status, intentions to become a smoker in the next year, and smoking status of friends and persons residing in their home. A member of the project staff (DMB) introduced the study to each class of students, saying that its purpose was to obtain their reactions to magazine advertising. He explained that they were to complete the questionnaire independently and that their responses would remain anonymous and confidential. Each advertisement was projected for up to four minutes, during which time the students completed the set of questions for that ad. The ads were shown in the following order: Payless, Marlboro, Ba- cardi, Newport, Wolverine, Camel, Virginia Slims, and Cover Girl. Once the ads had been evaluated, the subjects completed the demo- graphic information section. The staff member then collected the questionnaires. Data Management and Analysis Responses on the completed questionnaires were entered into a com- puter datafile using Paradox 4.0 for Windows. All data were dou- ble-entered; discrepancies were reconciled by returning to the origi- nal questionnaire. All statistical procedures were performed using SPSS 6.o for Windows. Given the sample sizes involved in this study, the percentages that are reported have maximal standard errors of I.7%, and maximal confidence intervals of plus and minus 3.3 %. RESULTS The following descriptive statistics are based on the total number of respondents to each question, which in some cases is smaller than the total sample size. Demographic Characteristics The students ranged from IO-I5 years old, with 98% II-14 years</page><page sequence="7">BARBEAU ET AL. * CIGARETTE ADVERTISING 479 old and almost half I3 years or older. The students were equally divided by gender (49% male). Racial/ethnic identification was as fol- lows: Asian (5%), black (4%), Hispanic (io%), white (77%), and other (4%). Smoking Behavior Of the 905 students who responded, 6I8 (68%) reported never hav- ing tried cigarettes, while z87 (3 z%) said they had. Fourteen-year-olds were four times as likely to have tried smoking than ii-year-olds. These findings are roughly comparable to those reported from a I993 statewide survey of Massachusetts youth, which found that z6% of Iz-I3 year-olds and 46% of I4-I5 year-olds said they had tried smoking (zz). Of the 90I students who responded to the question, I55 (I7%) stated that they were likely to try smoking in the next year. Of the 6I8 who reported not having tried cigarettes, only 33 (5%) indicated that they were likely to try smoking in the next year. Of 896 students, 8i (9%) reported smoking on at least i but less than zo of the last 30 days, while z6 (3%) reported smoking on zo or more days. By comparison, the I993 Massachusetts survey found that I% of students aged Iz-I5 had smoked on zo or more of the last 30 days (zi). Responses to Advertisements Table z presents the percentage of students who agreed or strongly agreed with each of a series of statements about what the cigarette and filler advertisements communicated to them about using the products. The results are reported separately for each of the ads. According to a majority of the students, the four cigarette ads say that smoking will make people look cool (range 7z% to 84%) and attractive (range 5z% to 8I%). The vast majority of students stated that the Camel, Newport, and Virginia Slims ads say that using tobacco will make people popular, while 5o% reported that to be the case for the Marlboro ad. A sizeable percentage of students also indicated that the four ads communicate that smoking will make people successful in life (range 39% to 53 %), sexy (range 4I% to 78%), attractive (52% to 8i%), and healthy (range 37% to 55%). A majority of students stated that</page><page sequence="8">4- &gt; O rY 00 0 \- D N &gt; \ oo a\ I HDt 4-o o N&lt;.. * \ 00 00H0 N4 4-o C) ) - 00 00 0 0 00 0~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~0 1 4-o H Ct 4-J O.

The greatest variability in response was found on whether what the people in the ads are doing requires exercise and physical energy. The Marlboro ad was most often found to show this (78%); the Virginia Slims ad was least often (i6%). Table 3 shows for each ad the percentage of students who stated that the people in the advertisement are supposed to look a certain way, as defined by a list of adjectives provided in the questionnaire. According to a majority of the students, the people shown in the four ads are supposed to look popular, cool, successful, attractive, and healthy. Greater response variability across the four ads was found for the adjectives sexy, pretty, and athletic. Comparisons of the appeal of the four cigarettes ads versus the filler ads indicates that, with only one exception, there are no differ- ences in responses to these two sets of ads (Table 4). That is, the cig- arette and filler ads portray equally appealing people as measured by responses to the survey questions. Table 5 shows the median esti- mated age of the models appearing in each cigarette ad, as well as the percentage of students estimating that the models are under age z5, the minimum specified in the Voluntary Cigarette Advertising and Promotion Code. The median estimated age was under z5 for four out of the six models. With the exception of the Marlboro cowboy, sizeable percentages of students estimated the models' ages to be under z5. DISCUSSION These findings indicate that, despite the Tobacco Institute's Voluntary Cigarette Advertising and Promotion Code, current cigarette print advertising communicates culturally positive messages to youth about smoking. In short, the Code is failing to do its job. The Code states that cigarette advertising "shall not suggest that smoking is essential to social prominence, distinction, success or sex- ual attraction." Yet a very large percentage of the grade 6-8 students in our study reported that the advertisements they saw communicate that smoking will make people popular, cool, successful in life, and sexy. The Code states that cigarette advertising shall not "picture a per-</page><page sequence="10">44J oo N r \ N l 00 4) ( 00 0 \D 0\ 0 \ 0\ 00 N4 0 0 &gt; H : 4-4 ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ - Pv oo 00 &gt; * -?

Yet a sizeable percentage of the students reported that the advertise- ments they saw communicate that smoking will make people attrac- tive and healthy.</page><page sequence="12">484 JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY VOL. 19, NO. 4 According to the Code, "Cigarette advertising shall not depict . any smoker participating in, or obviously just having participated in, a physical activity requiring stamina or athletic conditioning beyond that of normal recreation .. ." Yet 78 percent of the students said that one of the cigarette ads does this, while two other ads were said to do this by 40 and 30 percent of the students, respectively. Finally, the Code states, "No one depicted in cigarette advertising shall be or appear to be under z5 years of age." Yet four of the six models in the test ads were estimated by a majority of students to be under z5. The median age estimated for one model was i9. Comparison of the cigarette versus filler ads showed that the two sets of ads portrayed people who were equally appealing to the respondents. If the Code were effective, it would be expected that the people portrayed in the cigarette ads would be less appealing to young people than those in the ads for other products. This was not the case, which provides additional evidence that the Code is ineffec- tive in protecting youth from perceiving positive images in cigarette advertising. A potential criticism of the study is that we tested only four cigarette advertisements. In response, we note that all of the ads were selected from mainstream magazines that have a large youth readership, and that they are representative of long-standing image advertising cam- paigns run by Camel, Marlboro, Newport, and Virginia Slims. Cer- tain cigarette advertisements that do not include models or cartoon characters might meet the tenets of the Code, and a relatively small percentage of students might judge such ads to communicate unde- sirable messages about the supposed benefits of cigarette smoking. The fact remains that the Code is to apply to all cigarette advertising. Another potential limitation is that the advertisements were pre- sented in the same order each time, owing to the logistics of the study. Although we cannot totally rule out a learning effect, the fact that our general results are consistent across advertisements, while each of the four advertisements evoked a very different profile of responses, argues that any learning effect involved is not a reasonable alterna- tive explanation of our results. Defenders of cigarette advertising might also argue that we would have faulted the tobacco industry for violating the Code no matter what percentage of students indicated that the selected ads commu- nicated undesirable messages. The results clearly show, however, that</page><page sequence="13">BARBEAU ET AL. - CIGARETTE ADVERTISING 485 the vast majority of students believed that the ads communicate ideas that are in violation of the Code's standards. The demonstrated failure of the Tobacco Institute's Voluntary Cig- arette Advertising and Promotion Code brings into question whether the tobacco industry is capable of self-regulating its image advertis- ing. Indeed, it may be the very nature of image advertising that, by portraying people (or anthropomorphic characters) who use the prod- uct, it inevitably communicates culturally positive messages to youth about smoking. For that reason, alternative public policies to deal with the prob- lems caused by image advertising need to be introduced and evalu- ated. Shortly after the Federal Trade Commission announced that it was seeking an order to prohibit R. J. Reynolds from using the Joe Camel campaign to promote Camel cigarettes to children, the com- pany retired this image. This followed a Food and Drug Administra- tion regulation to ban all such advertising in publications with significant youth readership and to replace it with black-and-white, text-only advertising (z3). While this regulation is being challenged by the industry, the Io5th Congress is considering a bill (S.I4 I 5) that would mandate similar restrictions on advertising. These and other public policies deserve serious consideration for their potential to help limit youth smoking.

This investigation examined whether, despite the Tobacco Insti- tute's Voluntary Cigarette Advertising and Promotion Code, current cigarette print advertising communicates culturally positive messages to youth about smoking. Methods. Nine hundred thirteen students in grades 6-8 (ages io-I 5) were shown a sample of four contemporary cigarette print ads (Camel, Marlboro,</page><page sequence="16">488 JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY * VOL. 19, NO. 4 Newport, and Virginia Slims) and completed structured written assessments designed to capture their perceptions of each ad. Results. Across the four ads, between 37% and 84% of the students reported that the ads communicated to them that smoking will make people popular, cool, successful in life, sexy, attractive, and healthy. Sizeable per- centages of students reported that the ads show people using the product in an "exaggerated" way, and that what people in the ads are doing requires "exercise and physical energy." The median estimated age of the models in the ads was under age 25 for four out of the six models. Conclusions. As perceived by adolescents, current cigarette print adver- tising violates basic tenets of the Voluntary Code, thus bringing into ques- tion the tobacco industry's ability to self-regulate image advertising. These findings suggest that the FDA ruling to prohibit image advertising for tobacco in publications with significant youth readership deserves serious consideration.</page></plain_text>
