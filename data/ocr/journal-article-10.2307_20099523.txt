<plain_text><page sequence="1">THOMAS NEMETH DEBOL'SKIJ AND LESEVlC ON KANT: TWO RUSSIAN PHILOSOPHIES IN THE 1870s KEY WORDS: Debol'skij, Lesevic, Kant, time, positivism, neo-Kantianism The Russian study of Kant initiated by Jurkevic and Karpov in the 1860s, urged by Lavrov and facilitated by M. I. Vladislavlev's 1867 translation of the Critique of Pure Reason, however imperfect,1 was for the most part not sustained in the ensuing decade of the 1870s.2 In secondary discussions of this period, however, two individuals are prominently singled-out primarily for their apparent 'flirtation', albeit brief and guarded, with Kant's ideas and/or legacy.3 Both did in fact espouse a qualified 'return' to Kant in an attempt to resolve perplexing issues in the positions they held previously, and both almost imme diately afterwards, apparently sensing an inadequacy with their own self-proclaimed Kantian-inspired solutions, moved on to positions adumbrated but not explicitly developed in the works we will examine here. Neither of them was the first in this; nor were they to be the last writing in the Russian language. They deserve consideration not only for their attitudes with respect to Kant as such but as examples of attempts to vitalize the philosophical systems of the time through rectification of conceived omissions. Nevertheless the question still remains whether the respective 'flirta tions' with Kantianism by both Debol'skij and Lesevic have any sub stance. That is, both unquestionably found their earlier philosophies to be deficient in the area of epistemology. Yet in attempting to fill in the respective lacunae did Debol'skij and Lesevic make genuine attempts to incorporate Kant's 'Critical philosophy', or any significant yet internally consistent portion of it, into their own respective positions? In this paper we will examine their individual attempts to meld 'Kantianism' with 'empiricism', on the one hand, and positivism, on the other. We will see that regardless of whether empiricism and/or positivism in themselves are guilty of epistemological omissions the respective attempts by Debol'skij and Lesevic reveal precious little that can be Studies in East European Thought 45: 281?311,1993. ? 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

Debol'skij's endeavor is marred by a fundamentally inadequate understanding of the Kantian enterprise that is revealed all the more clearly by his criticisms of it; Lesevic's project is utterly devoid of specifics, but clearly he values not the historical Kant but the Kant of those contemporary neo-Kantians who viewed him as an opponent of metaphysics. I Born in November 1842 in St. Petersburg Nikolaj G. Debol'skij led a philosophically long and productive life, although unusually isolated from regular academic circles. Apparently self-educated in philosophy Debol'skij, the son of a priest, attended the Institute of Mining in St. Petersburg and then the university there, passing in 1865 the examina tion for the candidate degree in natural sciences. During the 1870s he taught at the gymnasium level and from 1882 to 1887 at the St. Peters burg Theological Academy, where he lectured on metaphysics, logic and psychology. By this time he had long since passed to a dialectical standpoint, closest to Hegel of the major Western thinkers but with an unmistakable stamp of his own. Judging from his own statements Debol'skij's views in the 1860s were not atypical; like so many others of his generation he held to a materialist world-view. Yet unlike many contemporaries he came to recognize that this materialism was itself a metaphysical standpoint that fundamentally stood in opposition to the empirical methodology on which it supposedly rested.4 This concern led him to the empiricism of Hume and Mill, the views of the latter being then fashionable in Russia. In their positions vis-?-vis metaphysics, however, Debol'skij found 'discrepancies and vacillations'.5 A reading of Kuno Fischer's study of Kant at this time6 followed by an examination of the Critique of Pure Reason itself revealed to him new possibilities leading to his first published book in 1870, Vvedenie v ucenie o poznanii,7 which he says he saw at the time as a 'lucky' reconciliation of empiricism and Kantianism. While the 1870 text may mark Debol'skij's closest approach to Kant, at least in his book-length treatises, the question of how close this actu</page><page sequence="3">DEBOL'SKIJ AND LESEVIC ON KANT 283 ally was nevertheless remains.8 Several years later in 1878 Debol'skij wrote that the chief goal in his first work, as well as subsequently, was "to show, contrary to empiricism, that metaphysical or ontological cognition is possible, i.e., that in addition to a theory of appearances, cognition of what exists in itself, a theory of things in themselves, is possible."9 Such a position, however, hardly appears compatible with Kantianism either by itself or in 'reconciliation' with any other doctrine. On the other hand, it is possible that the Vup is such a synthesis but that Debol'skij's 1878 statement misrepresents his earlier position in terms of his latter concerns. Regrettably Debol'skij does not elaborate further on precisely how or for what reason(s) he viewed his position of 1870 as partly Kantian. Debol'skij starts in the Vup with the stance, however confusingly argued, that philosophy is the discipline or 'science' that concerns absolute truths. Yet, on the other hand, enamoured by the successes of natural science and given empiricism's at least unilateral alliance with it he uncritically adopts what he takes to be a central tenet of empiricism, namely that speculative philosophy is impossible because all knowledge is experiential. Are these two positions irrevocably opposed? They are if and only if we maintain that experience provides conditional knowl edge. Without further ado Debol'skij, making a dubious move holds that unconditional knowledge means knowledge of the unconditional or absolute. The question, then, is whether experience does indeed reveal an absolute. The empiricists contend that experience yields only a manifold, i.e., no enduring, unitary thing;10 the idealists, or dogmatists, to use Debol'skij's preferred terminology, though, rightly insist that thought requires unity. They with their idealist framework, on the other hand, are unable to explain the manifold of the sensibly perceived. Agreeing with the formers' conception of experience, i.e. that it does not provide a manifold, the dogmatists find experience alone cannot account for knowledge. For Debol'skij both are wrong in that "experience undoubt edly reveals to us a unity in cognitive objects, and this is why philosophy is possible as an empirical science" ( Vup, 11).11 In discussing Kant's position on space and time Debol'skij in the briefest possible way recapitulates the former's first three arguments in the Metaphysical Exposition of space. He does not here dispute Kant's</page><page sequence="4">284 THOMAS NEMETH conclusion that space and time are a priori forms of sensible intuition12 and accepts without complaint the claim that they, therefore, "obviously cannot be considered as properties of things in themselves but only of appearances perceived by us" (Vup, 90).13 Unfortunately, as the history of Kant scholarship shows, it by no means obviously follows from the former claim that space and, correspondingly, time are properties exclusively of the phenomenal world. Regrettably Debol'skij also pays no attention to the respective transcendental expositions. Debol'skij proceeds to a summary, albeit devoid of argument or critical analysis, of the main conclusions Kant establishes in the Critique of Pure Reason. There is little point in discussing Debol'skij's synopsis in any detail at this time. Of far more interest is what he sees of value, and indeed of little value, in Kant's epistemology and why. In contrast to sensibility the function of the understanding lies not in providing immediate representations but mediate ones through a sub ordination of one representation under another. This it does by means of judgments, which thereby serve to unite representations and so produce a unity. The understanding's function, however, is still quite external to that which is united. Here lies, for Debol'skij, Kant's first misunderstanding. A second misunderstanding is that "according to Kant only appearances can be objects of cognition; the categories are applicable to them alone. One may ask how the recognition of the existence of things in themselves, as the cause of appearances, is in keeping with this theory" (Vup, 114).14 The attempt to resolve these two 'misunderstandings' served as the basis for the further development of philosophy. Indeed already at this early date Debol'skij acknowl edges that the proposals put forward by the triumvirate of Fichte, Schelling and Hegel represent the most complete solution to the problems posed by Kant.15 While surely not uncritical of Hegel, and in particular of certain details in the logical transitions from one concept to another in the mature system and in the construal of some concepts that make it ultimately quite arbitrary,16 Debol'skij views Hegel's dialectical method as representing important progress beyond Kant's theory [But does he really mean to say Kant's method?]. On the other hand, Kant's faith in the power of thought, proceeding from principle, legitimized the dogmatism inherent in the search for a single principle such as is found</page><page sequence="5">DEBOL'SKIJ AND LESEVIC ON KANT 285 in Fichte. In his discussion of Schopenhauer's views he also states, albeit without argument, his rejection of the Kantian table of categories as it stands, the ascription of apriority to space, time and causality and the separation of the faculties of reason and understanding. Nevertheless, Debol'skij's chief concern in the Vup is with situating the unity found in thought, the 'unity of psychic life', vis-?-vis the pure manifold of sensation, the empiricists alleging sensation alone exists in experience. Here Debol'skij finds Kant makes progress at least compared to the idealists and the empiricists.17 The former's actual 'argument' for his position, however, is in its brevity somewhat dis appointing: "Let us assume that a union of states a and b takes place. Obviously this unity would be impossible if in the transition from a to b the consciousness of the identity of our self were lost.. . . Unity is not a result but a condition of the union of sensations" ( Vup, 177). Notwithstanding the acuity of Debol'skij's observation that the unity of thought requires what Kant calls 'a logically simple subject' (B40718), it is impossible not to agree that discursive thought necessarily requires a unity of the multiplicity of the elements constituting it, which by our initial assumption it does have, and thus is an analytic proposition, i.e. an at least partial definition of discursive thought. From this argument alone, however, we are by no means entitled to the claim that "the individual is conscious of himself as identical in the change of his various states" (Vup, 111). The substantiation of such a position would require not only an account of consciousness but also of self-conscious ness, neither of which Debol'skij provides and certainly does not follow from what he has said or will say. Unfortunately Debol'skij fails, at least here, to specify what kind of 'unity' he has in mind, an omission that prevents us from attempting, or even conceiving to attempt, to fill in some of these gaps ourselves. This is not to say that Kant himself did not hold "that all the variety of empirical consciousness must be combined in one single self-consciousness" (A117n). The important point, however, is that already in the first edition of the Critique Kant maintained that the connection between psychic states is only possible according to a priori rules (A108), whereas this stipulation is entirely absent from Debol'skij's account. Clearly for the former the unity with which he is concerned is grounded in a synthesis that is a priori with respect to any empirical cognition, and such a synthesis therefore</page><page sequence="6">286 THOMAS NEMETH requires a priori rules. By failing to provide for them and by his silence on the nature of the derived unification19 Debol'skij ensures that the proposition in question can only be strictly analytical despite his own claims involving self-consciousness that could be interpreted as synthetic. In Debol'skij's eyes Kant's recognition of the logical simplicity of the subject of cognition represents an advance over 'dogmatic' theories.20 He, however, faults Kant for his strict functional separation of this subject from sensibility and the manifold presented through it. Given Kant's unquestioned assumption of the Humean passivity of sensation the entire weight of unification falls on reason (razum), which produces the forms of sensible and discursive cognition,21 and these in turn act as an intermediary between reason and appearances. Debol'skij levels what I take to be two separate charges against this view: 1) The process of unification is fundamentally obscure, "since reason, producing the categories exclusively by its own activity, thereby breaks its original unity" (Vup, 179); and 2) If the forms of cognition are so produced, their origin and application are incomprehensible. Undoubtedly the transcendental deduction of the categories is a difficult and obscure text, although saying it is so is no substitute for a demonstration. But it is Debol'skij's characterization of the categories that shows a disturbing tendency to interpret Kant along exceedingly idealistic lines. It is a dangerous distortion to view the categories as produced by the understanding ? let alone reason ? which then stand, as it were, as a third, independent component or element in the cognitive process, thus sundering some original, pre-cognitive unity. Rather, all discursive thought takes place in judgments and since "all judgments are functions of unity among our representations" (A69/ B93), the judgmental forms are the 'functions' of the unification of representations. In this way a specification of the forms of judgment is also a specification of the functions of unification. Although the under standing introduces a transcendental content into its representations (A79/B105), whatever original unity is present is not thereby disrupted. Perhaps even more indicative of Debol'skij's idealistically-inclined reading of Kant is the second charge above. Admittedly the latter himself provided ammunition for both those who would contend that a derivation of the categories from a single principle is possible as well as</page><page sequence="7">DEBOL'SKIJ AND LESEVIC ON KANT 287 those who would wish to deny this possibility. That Kant ultimately failed to provide one and that in the second edition of the Critique he expressly disavowed the attempt (B145?146) should be decisive. Nevertheless, however we may read Kant, Debol'skij's dismissal of him, in part because he does not provide such a derivation, reveals more about Debol'skij and his vision of philosophy than about Kant. More over, Debol'skij does not tell us why an explanation of the origin of the categories should be so important. Rejecting the 'Kantian' and the empiricist solutions to the problem of the origin of the elementary cognitive forms, the latter because its explanation of the origin of the categories too is incomprehensible, Debol'skij proposes a third possibility, viz. "that the interaction of reason and sensibility is in no need of the forms but on the contrary produces them itself. Consequently, in no way are these forms innate, and they serve no use at all since without them reason is yet able to enter into an intercourse with sense content" (Vup, 179). In what I take to be a reiteration of this possibility in other terms he further on writes: "As we said, however, a third solution is possible, viz., that the forms of reason, i.e. universal representation,22 concepts, and ideas, arise neither exclusively a posteriori nor exclusively a priori, i.e. from the unity of self-consciousness. Let us suppose that in the elementary acts of cogni tion the elements and manifold of content as well as the unity of the cognizing subject is given. In this case their combined action will be more comprehensible than under any other presupposition. It seems to me that this has a factual basis" ( Vup, 180). That the categories perform an essential role in bringing the sense manifold into one consciousness (B143) unmistakably forms an impor tant step in Kant's transcendental deduction. Indeed, far from being of no use the categories are the 'functions of judgment' that are employed to determine the manifold of an intuition and thereby represent this manifold "as belonging to the necessary unity of self-consciousness" (B144). The categories, pure concepts of the understanding, or reason as Debol'skij says,23 apart from sensibility are empty logical functions yielding no determinate and thereby known object. How much of this Debol'skij realized is unclear. Our intention in mentioning Kant's stance is simply to show the distance between their respective positions on this issue. To confuse matters further Debol'skij apparently fails to realize</page><page sequence="8">288 THOMAS NEMETH that Kant would not contest his assertion that the unity of the cognizing subject is given even in the most elementary acts of cognition. This unity, though, is not empirically given, as Debol'skij believed, but presupposed in all (discursive) thought. Debol'skij fails to spell out here in the Vup the mechanism or manner by which 'reason' and sensibility interact, as Kant tried to do in the transcendental deduction. For the latter what is found to be neces sary in the representation of an object is indicative of the underlying structure of the cognitive process. Objects must, therefore, conform to this structure in order to be represented as objects (Bxvi). On the other hand, were we to view the categories as superfluous for the interaction of sensibility and 'reason', i.e. the understanding, some other mecha nism must be established to account for their applicability to objects. This mechanism in turn presumably operates according to some rule(s), for otherwise the production of the universal concepts would not be universal, which Debol'skij concedes they are, and would be fortuitous. Such rule(s), however, would then merely ground the categories and function, certainly if we accept the thrust of Kant's metaphysical deduc tion linking the structure of cognition to a logical table of judgments, as more primitive categories. Another transcendental deduction, one possibly even more intricate than Kant's, becomes necessary. Such hardly represents a step forward. Additionally, if the categories are a 'product' of the interaction of the two faculties we must account for how appearances can "be given in intuition independently of functions of the understanding" (A90/B122). We have to explain how it is that a product of an interaction can yet regulate that interaction. Debol'skij's proposal raises more problems than it either solves or eliminates. To illustrate the 'factual basis' of the third possible solution Debol'skij asks us to examine the smallest possible sensation, smallest with respect to intensity and temporal duration. The time-span in which this sensa tion occurs nevertheless retains the peculiar properties of time in that there is a unity of advancing temporal moments. Such a minimal sensa tion, therefore, presents itself as both "a manifold, because it consists of moments of time, and as an absolute unit, because for the perceiving subject the entire series of temporal moments that constitute it are fused into a single present time. It can be said that reducing the</page><page sequence="9">DEBOL'SKIJ AND LESEVIC ON KANT 289 duration of a sensation to the minimum proportionately highlights the unity of the cognizing subject" (Vup, 182). Considered as evidence in support of a third solution the above example clearly will not suffice. No mention is made of the production of the universal concepts, the categories, nor do we find in it support for a categoryless interaction between reason and sensibility. In fact far from distinguishing himself from Kant on the basis of it the cited illustration can easily be read as an example of what Kant called the 'synthesis of apprehension' (B160?161 and A98?100) and thus as one of the three syntheses that must be found in all empirical knowl edge. Far from serving as ammunition against Kant the illustration only reveals his meager acquaintance with Kant's central arguments and tenets. Yet to confuse matters further Debol'skij does not restate his 'third' solution' at the end of the illustration but instead concludes: "Thus the unity of the cognizing subject is a necessary condition of sensation, regardless of whether we view the latter as composed of (temporally) elementary parts or as something capable of infinite durational dimin ishing" (Vup, 182). On the assumption that Debol'skij really does not mean to say 'sensation' in the first instance but 'the consciousness of sensation' and 'sensation' thereafter,24 we have not a reiteration of the proposed solution but a return to the substantially different claim concerning the necessity of a unity of consciousness. Debol'skij himself fails to specify whether he views this claim as in any way identical or even tantamount to the proffered solution. Whatever the case may be, its philosophical modesty ensures its success: The unity of (the repre sentation of) time does entail the unity of consciousness for the very reason discussed earlier. But we have made no advance over that presentation. The question still remains whether there are conditions for the unity of consciousness in representing a manifold of intuition, and this Debol'skij has not yet addressed. Although rejecting the apriority of space and time, Debol'skij's discussions give every indication that he accepts their originality (pervonacaVnosf), i.e., that they are not derivative, and their univer sality. Indeed he explicitly states, albeit without argument: "Every sensation, as we already saw [sic ? TN], has a spatial and temporal</page><page sequence="10">290 THOMAS NEMETH character" (Vup, 202). So much for space and time as forms of intuition.25 Debol'skij depicts space and time as arising at the interface of reason and sensibility just as do the pure categories. Since they are not 'in' reason they are not a priori, and since they are not 'in' sensibility, therefore derivable from it alone, they are not a posteriori.26 How an intuition could arise in this way is again left unsaid; how a form of all intuition could so originate is also unclarified. For Kant the a priori intuition of time makes possible the concept of alteration and thereby that of motion. The concept of motion, however, also presupposes space. In the 'First Critique' Kant ostensibly raises this issue in order to show that "transcendental aesthetic cannot contain more than these two elements, space and time" (A41/B58). Debol'skij takes exception with this stance. He writes: "Kant recognized space and time as original representations, and motion as their synthesis.27 . . . While accepting the originality of spatial and temporal properties in our sensations, we, nevertheless, are not asserting that the concept of motion arises only from the synthesis of the concepts of space and time. On the contrary, we think that motion is given to us in the act of perception along with space and time as their original unity" (Vup, 201?202). If I understand him correctly, Debol'skij asserts in direct opposition to Kant that there is an additional, original element of transcendental aesthetic and that this element is motion, which can be conceptually seen as the unification of the concepts of space and time. Of course, much depends on the meaning of 'original unity', an expres sion Debol'skij does not define. That we must view motion as a con ceptual, though not ontological, unification of space and time follows from his qualification 'original', for otherwise the combination would not be original. Kant conceives motion as presupposing 'something empirical', an existing something (A41/B58), whereas for Debol'skij "the form of motion is nothing other than a representation of our means of uniting the spatial and temporal manifold" (Vup, 205). No mention is made of anything existing. As Debol'skij accords a special status to space and time, as well as a number of other concepts, neither a priori nor empirical, motion too can certainly be no more a posteriori than they. A cornerstone of Kant's doctrine of transcendental idealism is that since space and time are conditions or determinations of sensibility that</page><page sequence="11">DEBOL'SKIJ AND LESEVIC ON KANT 291 which we perceive in space and time is an appearance and not a thing in itself. On the other hand, Debol'skij's thoroughly ambiguous theory of space, time and original concepts in his own eyes leaves no room for the Kantian dichotomy. Without realizing a distinction between the notions of 'noumenon'28 and 'thing in itself and accepting the traditional criticism of Kant's position that merely to speak of what things in themselves cannot be is to make a knowledge-claim concerning them he writes: "Any theory that accepts noumena ultimately turns out to be self-contradictory. Asserting that we know only appearances it at the same time speaks of things in themselves and cannot provide an account of how these things in themselves, being uncognizable, can yet enter the sphere of cognition" (Vup, 209). On this basis we can confidently conclude that Debol'skij rejects Kantian transcendental idealism, although on the basis of his view that space and time univer sally arise at the interface of reason and sensibility he should have accepted it. Inasmuch as space and time, according to his theory, certainly cannot be conceived as properties of the sensibly given considered apart from its interaction with reason, we have no choice but to admit the realm of the in itself and with it a transcendental idealism for much the same reason as does Kant. Indeed, despite the realism29 he apparently espouses there are troubling indications that already in this early work Debol'skij has proceeded quite some distance along the road to idealism. He writes: "The most general concepts to which we come are the concepts of permanency and inconstancy. Everything given, as constantly given, has being, and as a given something that is changed by other given things it suffers alteration" (Vup, 208). As permanency is a property of time ? "for change does not affect time itself, but only appearances in time" (A183) ? it is doubtful that permanency and inconstancy are our most general concepts. In fact, Debol'skij himself seems to be of two minds in this. A few paragraphs further on he claims: "The concepts of alteration and being are the most general concepts attainable by humans" (Vup, 209). The only way to resolve these statements rests on equating permanency and inconstancy with being and alteration respec tively. The tenability of such a move, however, is questionable. The concept of alteration, as Kant recognizes, presupposes permanence: "Alteration is a way of existing which follows upon another way of</page><page sequence="12">292 THOMAS NEMETH existing of the same object. All that alters persists, and only its state changes" (A187/B230). Moreover the concept of permanency with which we are dealing here is that of relative, not absolute, endurance. This is clear from Debol'skij's failure to distinguish between what Kant calls 'the representation of something permanent in existence' and a permanent representation (Bxli). Debol'skij's very equation of perma nence with being would require a disregard of its reference to time, and as relatively enduring we would be attributing existence to the given only when it is given, leaving us with a Berkeleian idealism. Debol'skij's tenuous hold on realism is further weakened by his rather cryptic and puzzling comment that ". . . we will not be deviating from the truth if we recognize that the concept of being is abstracted from the unity [of the subject ? TN], the concept of change from the manifold of our objects of cognition, and the concept of causality is their unity just as motion is the unity of space and time" (Vup, 208). From where did this notion of abstraction come? Earlier we were told that 'universal concepts' arise neither from the unity of the subject nor from the manifold alone; now we are told that the concepts of being and change, the most general of all, are abstractions from these two respectively. Furthermore, can we abstract a concept from a single thing, in this case the subject? Does the subject, which Debol'skij earlier called 'logically simple', nevertheless, have a being that is the same as external objects? Or if the being of the subject is merely logical, i.e. outside space and time, as Debol'skij earlier implied, are we not com mitted, based on his present statement, to view everything apparently in space and time as also merely logical? Putting the philosophical viability of Debol'skij's constructions aside, however, we still can readily see that an immense chasm separates them from Kant's. If we take Debol'skij's statement quoted above as his con sidered view, it is well-nigh impossible to construe the universal concepts mentioned as elementary rules to which appearances are subject and to see how they are involved in judgments. In fact, despite the title of his book and his periodic invocation of what he at one point calls a simple rule: "Do not transcend the bounds of the possibility of experience" (Vup, 210), Debol'skij seldom adheres to it but instead is engaged in a delineation of an ontology of mental concepts that bears scant resem blance to the Critique of Pure Reason. While asserting that there are a</page><page sequence="13">DEBOL'SKIJ AND LESEVIC ON KANT 293 number of universal concepts in cognition, Debol'skij completely over looks a demonstration of the role they might play in making cognition possible. It should come as no surprise that the role of consciousness is notably absent from this account. And despite his frequent allusions to cognition, Debol'skij never tells us, never so much as raises the issue of, what cognition is. Furthermore, no body of knowledge enters the scope of his investigation as a paradigmatic case-study, whether it be New tonian physics or Euclidian geometry. On such a fundamental issue as that of the external world Debol'skij reveals the poverty of his explora tions: "If we are asked how an identical external world is possible for all subjects, we frankly confess our inability to answer this question" (Vup, 221). Yet he does not question whether knowledge is possible at all or if it is, under what circumstances. A questioning of the reliability of knowledge-claims and the development of a theory of truth do not fall within his purview. All of these concerns we today regard as part and parcel of epistemology. Judging from his own conclusion to the Vup the chief debt Debol'skij owed to Kant is seeing "that in experience the elements of unity and the manifold are always given together" (Vup, 223?224), a position he never grows tired of repeating. Indeed, such is the extent of his acknowledged indebtedness here. Debol'skij's major subsequent works reveal greater sophistication and a deeper penetration into the problems raised, although they fall outside the chronological and for the most part thematic scope of the present study. The Kantian inspiration, already so illusive in 1870, quietly slipped out of the picture, despite his continued use of much terminology we more readily associate with Kant than later German Idealism.30 In his previously mentioned 1878 preface to the Filosofija buduscego Debol'skij claims that what he had earlier in the Vup called the 'absolute' or the 'unity', i.e. the transcendental unity of apperception, is a thing in itself.31 He there identifies this not as an individual but a universal principle, presumably meaning thereby the position he would develop further on that the absolute is no longer to be identified in any manner with an individual mind but God or, to use his own terms, Supreme Reason or the First Mind.32 Although ethics naturally is not his concern in the Vup, Debol'skij in 1872 devoted a series of articles to moral philosophy in one of which he briefly comments on Kant's position. His intention, he tells us, is not</page><page sequence="14">294 THOMAS NEMETH to expound or elaborate on Kant's views but to indicate their 'universal guiding truths' despite the falsity of the final conclusions to which Kant arrived.33 Ethics seeks the general foundations underlying our estima tion of what is morally good or bad. To affect this we can proceed with an eye toward either the terminus a quo, the cause of an action, or the terminus ad quern, the sought goal. The laws derived from the latter viewpoint find their expression in obligation as opposed to the necessity found in causal laws and are termed principles or norms. Viewed from a naturalistic or historical viewpoint we see morality as a necessary result of certain causes; yet speaking subjectively or ideally the par ticular individual submits freely to an absolute demand. Thus, we face the dilemma of accepting the apparent contradiction between theory and the fact of subjective morality or we must restrict the scope of theory and supplement it with the theoretically indemonstrable possi bility of ideal freedom. An acceptance of the first alternative, Debol'skij says for an unspecified reason, is something we cannot agree to par ticularly in the absence of a definitive demonstration of the incom mensurability of the ideal demands with those of cognition. The second alternative alone remains as a viable option. It requires us to conceive empirical, causal connections between phenomena as the peculiar, empirical manifestation of the moral law operating subjectively within us. Debol'skij regrettably refrains from any further explanation of how two radically divergent, if not diametrically opposed, interpretations of the same human action, interpretations which yet are not contradictory, can arise from a difference in standpoint. Nevertheless, this is for him the great truth in Kant's moral philosophy that leads to the concept of an ethical commonwealth and that serves as a necessary hypothesis in moral theory. This also marks Debol'skij's closest approach to Kant. As mentioned Kant proceeds to realize a moral philosophy that contains not particular truths but a single general principle of human activity.34 Rejecting the details of the Critique of Practical Reason or, as he puts it, the book's 'forced argumentation' Debol'skij makes the now familiar Hegelian charge that Kant's categorical imperative being devoid of particular content thereby lacks at the same time all practical significance. Debol'skij concedes that the moral principle is absolute but holds that its content is taken from contemporary human desires. What changes in time is the value placed on these desires.

And although morality speaks of ideals its contextual foundation in what exists leads Debol'skij to the almost Hegelian-sounding assertion that "moral progress is worthy of the name only when people grow accustomed to a moral appreciation of what exists and is possible, without jumps and stops, and not when they in the name of broad aspirations sacrifice their real foundations."36 In other words, humanity can progress morally only when it sees the morality of what is real. It remains unclear to what extent Debol'skij interpreted this as a strict moral defense of the status quo. The pervasive ambiguity of Debol'skij's early ethics as well as epistemology renders their definitive assessment a perilous undertaking. Nevertheless, his specific criticism of Kantian ethics notwithstanding, it is here and not in epistemology that we find Debol'skij's closest approach to Kant and this only with great reservations. II Comtian positivism was introduced into Russia as early as 1847 through the efforts of the economist V. A. Miljutin, who was one of the first in his country to be acquainted with the Cours de philosophie posi tive?1 During the 1860s and early 1870s such writers as Antonovic, Pisarev, Lavrov and Mikhajlovskij discussed the views of Comte. More over, John Stuart Mill's 1865 tract Auguste Comte and Positivism appeared in a Russian translation as early as 1867. Positivism not only enjoyed swift attention from the Russian intelligentsia but won a number of early converts. Not all of these, however, espoused an allegiance to the Comtian version, and not all were interested in it as a philosophy in our contemporary sense or even in developing it into such a philosophy. Born in January 1837 into a family of the Ukrainian dvorianstvo in the Poltava province Vladimir V. Lesevic attended a gymnasium in Kiev and then the School of Military Engineering in St. Petersburg.</page><page sequence="16">296 THOMAS NEMETH After three years of military service in the Caucasus he studied at the General Staff Academy in St. Petersburg, from which he graduated in 1861 and where he became acquainted with Lavrov, who possibly if not probably first drew Lesevic's attention to Kant.38 Attracted seem ingly from the start, however, to the positivism of Comte, Lesevic already during the 1860s penned at least a pair of works from that viewpoint. In the early 1870s, finding an epistemological deficiency in positivism, he turned some attention towards the neo-Kantianism then popular in Germany in hopes of filling in this philosophical lacuna. Soon afterward, however, he relentlessly moved on again this time with his attention focused on the positivism of Avenarius and Mach.39 The period during which Lesevic was comparatively most receptive to Kantian and neo-Kantian ideas and formulations occurred in the mid-1870s and is represented by two of his most important works: the Opyt kriticeskogo issledovanija osnovonacal pozitivnoj filosofii from 1877 and the Pis'ma o naucnoj filosofii from 1878.40 True to posi tivism Lesevic holds that if philosophy wishes to be a science (nauka), it must follow scientific methods, which alone guarantee the reliability of the respective discipline.41 Today at last philosophy is in a favorable position for such a development in that there are universally recognized sciences from which methodological rules can be abstracted and can in turn be applied to the traditional objects of philosophical inquiry. A characteristic trait of all scientific techniques is that nothing can be accepted without proof. Yet because of its philosophical deficiencies we find within positivism certain positions, e.g. an ontological realism, asserted dogmatically, i.e. without proof. While espousing an adherence to the fundamental thrust of Comte's views Lesevic attempts to excuse the former for his apparent ignorance of Kant's writings. Yet like Kant Comte too, in Lesevic's eyes, is concerned with determining the limits of what can be scientifically investigated and the appropriate method for doing so. Nevertheless, Lesevic indisputably recognizes that Comte failed to provide a critical foundation for his system despite his allusion to the need for an investigation of reason and its employment. Indeed Comte rejects at least for now the possibility of a separate study of the laws of intellec tual activity.42 As a result we find in his writings only 'rudiments' of philosophically critical principles. On the other hand, Lesevic considers</page><page sequence="17">DEBOL'SKIJ AND LESEVIC ON KANT 297 it essential to provide a grounding for the positivist system. We are in Kant's debt for having demonstrated that "a 'critique' of the cognitive faculty must precede (predsestvovaf) all knowledge assumed by the scientific method" (Opyt, 99).43 At first it appears that Lesevic wants to have it both ways: On the one hand, true to positivism he holds that epistemology must base itself on the body of established knowledge, principally psychology, without reducing itself to the latter. On the other hand, in saying that epis temology "must establish the principles that guide thought to attain actual, non-illusory knowledge" (Opyt, 125) Lesevic would seem to be asserting the direct opposite. The apparent contradiction vanishes, however, when we realize that he views the job of epistemology as merely ascertaining the principles, qua conditions, that make scientific knowledge possible. The priority of these principles is purely logical. Here Lesevic seeks to vindicate Kant against Hegel's criticism that "the examination of knowledge can only be carried out by an act of knowl edge."44 Lesevic asserts that Hegel commits a fundamental error of ordinary thought in confusing the act of cognizing with the theory of cognizing. "Kant did not set out to teach swimming but intended only to determine the conditions that make swimming possible" (Opyt, 135).45 It is Lesevic's conviction, enamored by his fundamental positivist belief, that epistemology, which he conceives as the instrument of philo sophical criticism, will examine metaphysical problems to disclose their genesis and ultimately thereby remove the peculiar sense metaphysics attaches to them. Make no mistake, however, Lesevic's enthusiasm for Kant is strictly limited.46 The former assigns a mere historical significance to Kant's realized system, finding in it "a false psychological theory, an uncritical relation to many of the positions of traditional metaphysics and an erroneous direction to the criticism that too often becomes consumed in polemics with the Leibnizian-Wolffian school" (Opyt, 159). The result was Kant's own distortion of his fundamental accomplishment. Only with the passage of time due to recent scientific achievements has it become possible to view Kant correctly. Although the honor of initiating the return to Kant belongs to Otto Liebmann, a large number of neo-Kantians seek to reformulate Kantianism on the basis of the latest positive, scientific knowledge. Owing to its careful philosophical</page><page sequence="18">298 THOMAS NEMETH consideration of contemporary science positivism should devote some study to the neo-Kantian literature. To do so does not mean that positivism relinquishes its realism or in any way endeavors to imitate another school. It would merely result in a recovery of the critical realism already at least implicitly contained in Comte's thought but misunderstood or ignored by Comte's successors.47 Regrettably Lesevic is largely silent on that most crucial issue in Kant's transcendental idealism ? the nature of space and time. We can infer, however, that inasmuch as he finds no criterion for the objectivity of perceptions, no criterion by which to determine whether a sense impression "comes from without or is conditioned by the state of one's organism" (Opyt, 127), Lesevic rejects viewing space as the form of outer sense. Indeed, his theory is particularly prone to the serious objection that it lacks any precise means of differentiating 'inner' from 'outer'. He himself maintains that determining whether a perception is one or the other can be accomplished "only by means of comparison with other moments" (Opyt, 127). Yet for such a comparison to be successful must we not have some criteria by which to compare? In the Pis'ma, which the author tells us is an edited series of letters to a young friend and is actually philosophically more interesting than the Opyt in spite of its relative neglect by scholars, Lesevic makes clear that he finds philosophical value in the neo-Kantian movement solely as it marks a rejection of metaphysics and produces results that "can be considered scientific" (Pis'ma, 12).48 Not all participants in the move ment, however, share equally a commitment to an anti-metaphysical stance. An examination of contemporary science and of its relation to Kant's philosophy reveals the impossibility of literally 'returning' to his thought and system (Pis'ma, 4). In fact the closer we examine Lesevic's own constructions the less we see of Kant. The former clearly states that Kant's thought runs aground on the issue of the a priori and that positivism, properly developed, must eliminate all reference to it. For example, with regard to causality Lesevic faults not only Kant but Comte as well, who he sees as delaying positivism's development by his hesitation in addressing the issue of causality radically. Lesevic himself views causality in terms of an association between two phenomena or, as he phrases it, a "correlation between cause and effect" (Pis'ma, 32)</page><page sequence="19">DEBOL'SKIJ AND LESEVIC ON KANT 299 much more reminiscent of Hume than Kant, with the proviso that Lesevic does not doubt the tenability or usefulness of causal-talk. The utility of causal-talk becomes evident in Lesevic's discussion of perception, wherein he states that the cause of perception is due to both subjective and objective factors without delineating precisely what these factors are. Although he largely refrains from metaphysical speculation about the ultimate nature of causality, he gives no indica tion that a psychological treatment of it is anything but exhaustive. In fact Lesevic admonishes against speaking of a universal law of causality that regulates or has to do with particular, individual phenomena, calling such an explanation the result of anthropomorphism. He extends this analysis to the entire field of natural science holding that all talk of eternal, unalterable natural laws has no place in 'scientifico-critical philosophy' (Opyt, 172). The psychological direction of Lesevic's approach to epistemology, however, is clear even if not spelled out. In the Pis'ma Lesevic continues his discussion of causality. There too he finds that the concept of causality 'in all likelihood' originally arises out of a 'generalization' of subjective representatives and then is applied to phenomena of the external world. Although psychologically this process is necessary, he cryptically tells us that "critically it is impos sible not to recognize it as very unsatisfactory" (Pis'ma, 29), pre sumably meaning there is no causality or causal force 'in itself. Here in the Pis'ma he holds that the very notion of a priori knowledge is a contradictio in adjecto since only an act of the understanding, such as the connecting of a given object construed as cause with another construed as effect, that can be corroborated a posteriori can be scientific and therefore an element of knowledge.49 The seemingly important point here is that the understanding creates concepts a priori without an internal restraint preventing the ascription of an objective significance to them. The critical enterprise for Lesevic consists in demonstrating this and establishing the condition or condi tions under which concepts become knowledge. For all his talk of 'critical realism' Lesevic, nevertheless, holds a very uncritical conception of both doctrines which he sees as set off from it: Idealism rejects the very existence of independent Objects (ob"ekta), and naive realism denies any participation or contribution on the part</page><page sequence="20">300 THOMAS NEMETH of the cognizing subject in the formation of perception. Certainly as applied to Kant's transcendental idealism Lesevic's characterization is thoroughly inadequate and mistaken. Without demonstrating how he understands Kant's concept of the a priori, he seeks to dismiss all a priori concepts from philosophy. Objective universality, so important in the Kantian a priori, Lesevic views as "a metaphysical illusion from which scientific knowledge certainly must be freed" (Pis'ma, 75). Again, Lesevic's interest is not in the role such universality plays in cognition ? an epistemological inquiry ? but rather in its origin as the result of the subject's cognizing activity (Pis'ma, 68) ? as construed by Lesevic, a psychological investigation. Kant's name is seldom mentioned in the Pis'ma. In the only sustained discussion of his views there Lesevic writes that the former's "so-called Copernican turn was essentially a restoration of the dogmatic technique, upon which a false psychology led him to a false theory of cognition, and the great task he posed he incorrectly resolved" (Pis'ma, 11). Such are hardly the words of a disciple or even of someone paying homage to a great teacher. Kant's 'false psychology' was based in his irreductionism, i.e. in equally treating perception, representation and concept as elementary psychic functions. His error was in thinking that only concepts, only certain concepts, can provide the foundation making experience possible, because only judgments, logical judgments, can make experience possible. Kant mistakenly failed to differentiate scientific, logical thought from natural, ordinary thought, which con structs its judgments without concepts. Presumably then, Kant con fusedly mistook scientific judgments for ordinary ones, dissecting the structure of the former while interpreting the results as the underlying structure of the latter. Unfortunately relegating all these comments to a comparatively lengthy footnote (Pis'ma, lit) Lesevic fails to argue for any of his contentious claims. Although Lesevic mentions Kant's name frequently in the Opyt there is but one reference to the 'First Critique' and this to the second edition preface. Based solely on the Opyt there is no evidence that Lesevic had so much as read extensively in the Critique of Pure Reason. In the Pis'ma there is but one citation, albeit lengthy, of the 'First Critique' in Vladislavlev's translation. Like his friend Lavrov Lesevic's interest in Kant stems in large part from a view that the history of thought reveals</page><page sequence="21">DEBOL'SKIJ AND LESEVIC ON KANT 301 progression towards truth. As neo-Kantianism dominated Germany Lesevic felt it incumbent on him to turn to it. Yet it must be empha sized that his interest in Kant was only through the neo-Kantians and ultimately because of them.50 They, in turn, were of interest to him only insofar as their positions could be married to positivism, and thus shorn of idealism and metaphysics. Lesevic's swift turn from a supposedly (neo)Kantian-enriched positivism to the positivism of Avenarius and Mach is not at all surprising when we realize his lack of philosophical commitment to the former and that his position during his '(neo)Kan tian' phase already had much in common with the later positivists. In the end we find his talk of a critical, i.e. Kantian, positivism is just that ? talk with little if any substance much like that of Lavrov's supposed Kantianism. The Opyt itself is for the most part a polemical attack against various French disciples of Comte (principally Littr?), and thereby their Russian adherents (chiefly Vyrubov), for whom philosophy, and epis temology in particular, was deemed of little if any significance. Rather than an epistemological tract, the Opyt is a treatise seeking to justify a quasi-epistemology and the concerns of theoretical and methodological reflections from within positivism. Nevertheless the overriding question is not something such as how a particular domain of knowledge is possible but what concepts can properly be employed in the positivist outlook.51 And the Pis'ma, while far less polemical than the Opyt, tacitly accepts the positivist approach towards fundamental philosophical issues; no arguments are offered there for that approach. Despite his harsh words about common sense, reminding us as much of Hegel as of Comte, Lesevic offers no 'Refutation of Idealism' or indeed of any proof of his fundamental realism. He apparently fails to grasp its ultimate metaphysical foundation, and at least in this respect his views have something in common with maligned common sense. Ill A detailed reading and comparison between the ideas of Lesevic and those of Kant will surely reveal similarities and agreements in certain places. Even two fundamentally disparate thinkers are unlikely to differ</page><page sequence="22">302 THOMAS NEMETH on all issues. What emerges most vividly, however, from such a reading is not the salient views shared by Kant and Lesevic but their dramati cally different approaches and, most importantly for our purposes here, that the latter simply fails to address most of the epistemological issues Kant did.52 Yet since Lesevic himself claims the need for an elaborated epistemology is what first drove him to seek guidance from Kantianism, these omissions are all the more surprising. While we certainly cannot fault him for replying to or addressing every point uttered by Kant, we can expect him to offer a sustained examination of those issues which he faults others for omitting. As we have seen, there are few if any concrete lessons he learned from Kant. For all his talk of 'critical realism' Lesevic's position is anything but critical in either the Kantian or the broader sense, particularly of its own presuppositions.53 For him the elimination of metaphysical speculation from a discipline renders it 'critical' (Opyt, 99). Indeed, Lesevic often seems to identify 'critical' with 'empirical'. Nevertheless, however, there are strains in his developed positions ? from all evidence not even realized ? that had he pursued another tactic, this other possible approach could have led him to a stand some what closer to that of Kant, albeit at the expense of his psychologistic positivism. One of these strains lies in Lesevic's adamant acceptance of realism along with a rejection of the correspondence theory of truth. He readily admits that, strictly speaking, knowledge is limited to our repre sentations: "Ordinary thought compares a representation with its object and defines truth as the agreement of the representation with the object. The critical point of view does not allow for such a comparison. We know that in our possession we do not have objects, only their repre sentations. We, therefore, can compare representations only with repre sentations" (Opyt, 126). The 'reality' of his realism, consequently, must be defined independently of our epistemological access to it. On what basis we have such access is unspecified, but it can be interpreted along' the lines of Kant's negative conception of the thing in itself. Lesevic does not deny a 'necessity' to the way in which we represent the world (Opyt, 179), but lacking a 'transcendental' perspective,54 i.e. any notion of the transcendental employment of the understanding and of transcendental reflection, he arrives at a phenomenalism that overtly concedes the relativity of knowledge. In doing so he leaves the door</page><page sequence="23">DEBOL'SKIJ AND LESEVIC ON KANT 303 open for a conceptual contrast between a knowledge of appearances and a knowledge of reality ? the former asymptotically approaching the latter ? and thereby also an emergence of the problems of affection and 'noumenal causality' that have haunted so much of Kant-interpreta tion.55 These problems do not disappear just because Lesevic prefers to speak of 'correlation' rather than causality. In fact he fails to explain how his proposal can be utilized and yet allow us to meaningfully speak of reality and of our lack of knowledge of it. Ultimately the reader is at a loss to understand what Lesevic has shown or even a clear idea as to what he had hoped he had shown. Rather than profiting from Kant's critique of empiricism, particularly that of Hume, Lesevic gives no indication that he was so much as aware of it. Despite his talk of logical conditions of knowledge, he fails to specify what they are, how they function, or their role in making knowledge-claims objectively valid. He is completely silent on the entire notion of a transcendental rule-governed synthesis, preferring instead (subjective) psychological explanations of general concepts. It is in this sense that all of his talk of a need for an epistemological enrichment of positivism notwithstanding, Lesevic gives no indication that he under stands the fundamental task of a Kantian epistemology. We have seen, however, that in both Debol'skij and Lesevic the flawed execution of their stated intentions does not completely prevent the emergence of lines of thought that could have led to a closer convergence to transcendental idealism. That they did not see or at least comment on this makes us question their actual acquaintance with the Kantian texts and the positions argued for therein. Alternatively we are led to question their respective commitments to enriching their previous views through an infusion of Kantianism. In either case our point stands, viz. that despite claims to the contrary in the secondary literature, and indeed by the principals themselves, neither Debol'skij nor Lesevic in the 1870s made a sincere effort to 'reconcile' his philosophy with that of Kant. Although both Lesevic and Debol'skij wrote the works we have examined here subsequent to Jurkevic's ontological subversion of epistemology, neither reveals any familiarity with it and, not surpris ingly, failed to address and respond to the philosophical approach it represented. Perhaps in the right hands the 'epistemological' work of</page><page sequence="24">304 THOMAS NEMETH Lesevic and Debol'skij could have acted as a corrective to Jurkevic's stand and thereby stemmed the blossoming of the distinctly ontological trend in later Russian philosophy. Nevertheless, it is difficult to see how their basic misconstruals of the discipline could reverse Jurkevic's quite independent undermining of it. Whether because of the low caliber of their respective work or because of the evolving position of the authors, the direct influence of Lesevic and Debol'skij on the subsequent development of Russian philosophy was slight.56 It is unfortunate, however, that such loudly proclaimed excursions into epistemology produced such amateurish results. Fortunately despite the invocation of his name, Kant-studies in Russia did not receive a further setback as a consequence of the imperfections in the works we have examined here. On the contrary, quite independently scholarly examinations of Kant's thought were soon to multiply rapidly, spearheaded at Kiev University by the continuing interest there of Sil'vestr S. Gogockij (1813?1889) and Aleksej A. Kozlov (1831?1901).57 That Debol'skij and Lesevic themselves each viewed their 'Kantian' period as transitional by no means helped attract contemporary attention to the works we have examined. Within slightly more than a decade confessed defenders of Kant's system (A. I. Vvedenskij and A. Vol'nskij) were to emerge in influentially strategic positions. In retrospect, for Kant-studies the 1870s in Russia represent a calm between the formative decade of the '60s and the ever acceler ating tempo of the '80s onwards. NOTES 1 To the extent that he is remembered today, it is as the teacher and predecessor of the neo-Kantian A. I. Vvedenskij and as the opponent of Solov'ev's advancement at St. Petersburg University. Lossky claims that Vladislavlev's translation is, apart from its cumbersome style, 'quite satisfactory'. Nicholas O. Lossky: History of Russian Philosophy, International Universities Press, New York, 1972, p. 163. C. G. Arzakan'jan notes, however, in the Soviet edition of Kant's works that Vladislavlev's translation contains "many distortions, mistakes and inaccuracies." Arzakan'jan mentions only Vladislavlev's awkward render ing of Ding an sich. Immanuil Kant: Socinenija v sesti tomakh \Works in Six Volumes], torn 3, M, 1964, p. 759. To this list we must at least mention his inconsistency in rendering law (zakon) and rule (pravilo) as well as understanding (rassudok) and</page><page sequence="25">DEBOL'SKIJ AND LESEVIC ON KANT 305 reason (razum) and representation (predstavlenie) and intuition (intuicija). For an example of the last of these see I. Kant: Kritika cistogo razuma [Critique of Pure Reason], perev. M. Vladislavlevym, St. P., 1867, p. 50. Moreover, Vladislavlev omits whole sentences. Not surprisingly Russian-language scholarly studies of Kant's thought in the ensuing years rarely referred to this translation. In an appreciative essay on his teacher and predecessor Vvedenskij makes no mention of Vladislavlev's philosophical relation to Kant or to the quality of his translation of the 'First Critique'. See Aleksandr Vvedenskij: 'Naucnakh dejatel'nosti M. I. Vladislavleva' ['The Scientific Work of M. I. Vladislavlev'], ?urnalMinisterstva narodnogo prosvescenija, 1890, #6, pp. 181?211. 2 For example, in his two-volume Logic text from 1872 Vladislavlev makes clear the gulf separating his position from that of Kant at least with respect to that topic. Indeed, in his discussion of the concept of causality Kant's name does not even appear. This is not to say that Kant's name and positions go totally unnoticed. Vladislavlev provides an exposition of Kant's views on logic but without much comment. See M. Vladislavlev: Logika [Logic], St. P., 1872, torn 2, pp. 177?185. Furthermore, Vladislavlev notes that he is in agreement with Kant concerning the synthetic nature of all (sic!) judgments in the empirical sciences and arithmetic. Ibid., torn 1, p. 141. His major criticism of Kant, however, and "almost all representatives of formal logic" lies in their definition of a judgment as "the meaning of the relation between concepts." Implicit in this definition, according to Vladislavlev, is the presupposition that a judgment cannot contain some thing that is not already contained in the concepts, whose relation the judgment concerns. Vladislavlev finds the Kantian definition excessively restrictive in that "numerous classes of real judgments" are excluded. His own example is that of "The man slipped and fell." For Vladislavlev this judgment is simply a statement of fact, an observation, but hardly the expression of a relation between the concept of man and that of slipping and falling. Ibid., torn 1, p. 122. Although Vladislavlev apparently accepts the notion of a priori judgments (see ibid., torn 1, p. 135), there is no basis for believing that he accepted the notion of a priori concepts. 3 This, their self-characterization, has been uncritically accepted, as we will see, by certain historians of Russian philosophy, most notably Zenkovsky and Walicki. See, for example, Andrzej Walicki: A History of Russian Thought from the Enlightenment to Marxism, Stanford University Press, Stanford, 1979, pp. 353?355. 4 In his eyes empiricism, with its rejection of metaphysics, upheld the fundamentally inscrutable nature of the thing in itself, while materialism is a metaphysical doctrine making a claim concerning the nature of the thing in itself. 5 N. Debol'skij: Filosofija buduscago [Philosophy of the Future], St. P., 1882, p. iv. 6 There was a keen interest in Fischer's work at this time in Russia. Jurkevic directed his lectures on Kant at Moscow University against Fischer's interpretation, and Vladislavlev studied under Fischer during his sojourn abroad. 7 N. Debol'skij: Vvedenie v ucenie o poznanii [Introduction to the Theory of Cognition], St. P., 1870. Hereafter this work will be referred to as Vup, and page references will follow immediately thereafter. 8 It is an understatement to say that the amount of secondary literature on the Vup is meager. Yet what there is fails to raise this issue. Zenkovsky appears to take at face value Debol'skij's self-interpretation. See V. V. Zenkovsky: A History of Russian Philosophy, trans. George L. Kline, Routledge and Kegan Paul, London, 1967, vol. 2, p. 621.</page><page sequence="26">306 THOMAS NEMETH 9 Debol'skij: Filosofija, op. cit., p. xvi. In the original Debol'skij has italicized the entire quotation. I have omitted the emphasis as unnecessary in this context. Although recognizing that he did not pose the problem in precisely these terms in the earlier work, Debol'skij maintains that this was due to an inadequacy in his termino logical development. Nevertheless, he continues, the same concept of the 'thing in itself is present there only under other guises. 10 Vup, 11 Debol'skij is of two minds in this. Later in the text he does not say that empiricism cannot find a unity in experience but merely that empiricism "cannot explain the unity of cognition." Vup, 88. 11 In 1878 he said that this characterization of philosophy arose out of "respect for the empirical prejudice." Debol'skij: Filosofija, op. cit., p. vii. 12 Vup, 90: "Thus space and time are not empirical concepts but original forms of our sensibility and a priori intuitions of it." 13 In what surely must be a typographical error Debol'skij quotes Kant from A34/B51 as saying "time is the a priori formal condition only of outer appearances. Space, as the pure form of all intuition, is the a priori condition of any appearance in general." Needless to say, this passage has space and time interchanged. Fortunately the transla tion of the remainder of the passage is correct, and Debol'skij's comments provide no evidence that it is anything but an unintentional mistake or a typographical error. 14 It is difficult to see precisely what Debol'skij takes the second misunderstanding to be. Granted that Kant took knowledge as limited to appearances, to hold that things in themselves exist and furthermore serve as the cause of these appearances is to raise a logically distinct issue. Regrettably the former provides no indication at this time of what he takes the correct understanding of these matters to be. Nevertheless in discussing the course of German philosophy after Kant Debol'skij places emphasis on the role played by the problem of affection rather than the more general one of transcendental idealism. From this we can conclude Debol'skij found the issue of noumenal causality to be Kant's second misunderstanding. 15 Vup, 115. Debol'skij does not mention specifically what problems found such a solution in the German Idealists. Presumably it cannot be that of affection since, as we have seen, it is in Debol'skij's eyes a pseudo-problem. 16 In 1878 Debol'skij, however, wrote: "The critique and exposition of Hegelianism presented in my book was one continuous misunderstanding." Debol'skij: Filosofija, op. cit., p. vii. 17 Debol'skij often alludes to the former as recognizing the activity of the Ego as the source of all cognition. While this may hold of Fichte it certainly does not of Kant's rationalist predecessors. 18 This and all future references to the Critique of Pure Reason are in the now standard first and second edition pagination. All translations are taken from Immanuel Kant: Critique of Pure Reason, trans, by Norman Kemp Smith, St. Martin's Press, New York, 1965. 19 Accordingly it would be a mistake or at least highly confusing were we to refer to the process Debol'skij has in mind by Kant's technical term 'synthesis'. As Kant writes, synthesis is an act that requires the manifold of a priori sensibility to "be gone through in a certain way, taken up, and connected" (A77/B102) in order to be known. This 'taking up' and 'connecting' in Kant is determined by a priori rules, which as we shall see Debol'skij rejects. 20 It is difficult to reconcile this with Debol'skij's earlier statement that Schopenhauer's</page><page sequence="27">DEBOL'SKIJ AND LESEVIC ON KANT 307 theory made an "essential correction to Kant's philosophy" in part because of his "greater attention to the psychological side of the matter." Vup, 122. 21 Vup, 178. Needless to say, Debol'skij fails to provide any textual support for this highly unusual, nay absurd, reading of Kant. 22 One cannot be certain what Debol'skij has in mind by representations (predstavlenija) here. As Kant calls space and time 'singular representations' (B136n), Debol'skij could legitimately be referring here to the intuitions of space and time. In quoting Kant Debol'skij consistently renders Anschauung as vozzrenie and Vorstellung as predstavlenie. 23 One might be tempted to suggest that razum is simply Debol'skij's unfortunate rendering of Kant's term Verstand were it not for the fact that he evidently was aware that razsudok was more appropriate. See Vup, 88: "... we can recognize three cognitive faculties: sensibility, understanding [razsudok] and reason [razum] proper." Therefore inasmuch as Debol'skij was aware of Kant's distinction between the faculties and yet attributes much that is proper to understanding to reason, we must conclude that he had a poor grasp of Kant's views here. 24 This 'correction' is needed to avoid a possible ambiguity arising with the term 'sensation'. To this point Debol'skij gives every indication that he uses 'sensation' in the narrow sense, as the 'matter' of experience or as Kant at the start of the Transcendental Aesthetic puts it: "The effect of an object upon the faculty of representation, so far as we are affected by it, is sensation" (A19?20/B33). Of course, this bald definition will need modification and qualification as we proceed, but to hold at the outset that sensation requires the unity of the subject is untenable except in a Berkeleian idealism. 25 We also have a basis for arguing that Debol'skij accepted, although he does not say so explicitly and may not even have realized it completely, that space and time are themselves, in Kantian terms, intuitions. Our previous citations have shown that for Debol'skij as for Kant time "relates immediately to the object and is single" (A320/ B377), i.e. is represented as a unity of a manifold. 26 Apparently Debol'skij unknowingly uses the term a priori in a different manner than Kant, while addressing the same issues thereby adding to the confusion. By his restriction of the a priori to reason and his limitation of reason to the logically simple subject, what Kant calls the transcendental unity of apperception, Debol'skij divorces everything but the subject from the a priori. Yet apart from the restrictiveness of his terminology it is not clear that the chasm separating Debol'skij from Kant is as wide as it may at first appear. Like Kant (Bl) the former holds that cognition begins with experience. The interaction of the cognitive faculty and the sensible manifold is certainly not a posteriori even in Kant's system. 27 As already said Debol'skij does not provide references; this is no exception. There is also not a single mention in Debol'skij's text of any Russian-language literature. Thus we have no way of knowing whether he was aware of the previous writings on Kant of Karpov and Jurkevic. To add to the problems of interpreting Debol'skij he seldom provides definitions of his key terms. 28 Debol'skij here does provide a definition. He writes: "A noumenon is a supposed extrasensory object underlying our sensible perceptions as something absolutely external and inaccessible to our cognition" {Vup, 208). As Kant himself at times iden tifies the noumenon and the thing in itself, we can overlook Debol'skij's indiscretion. 29 "We have no right to admit anything as existing without the subject of cognition, and</page><page sequence="28">308 THOMAS NEMETH this is why we consider a world in which only objects would exist to be impossible. But obviously at the same time the existence of the subject alone without any content is inconceivable" (Vup, 222?223). Debol'skij fails to realize that the inconceivability of solipsism is precisely what he must show and not merely assert. Thus, unlike Kant, who seeks to prove "the existence of objects in space outside me" (B275) is a necessary condition of "the determination of my existence in time," Debol'skij simply accepts a realist stance on the grounds that its rejection would leave the subject without any manifold to unify. While this may be true, it still leaves open the logical possibility that the subject itself generates the manifold, which, I believe, is precisely the solipsist's stance. 30 "Debol'skij to an even greater degree than Cicerin approached the style of pre Kantian rationalism . . ." D. I. Cizevskij: GegeV v Rossii [Hegel in Russia], Dom Knigi i Sovremennyja Zapiski, Paris, 1939, p. 300. 31 "The inadequacy of the philosophical terminology that I had worked out at that time allowed me to speak of 'things in themselves' only as a phantom, a mass of contradic tions. What I, however, then called the 'absolute', the 'unity', etc. is the same thing in itself, only under other names." Debol'skij: Filosofija, op. cit., p. xvi. The difficulty here is that in the Vup the unity does not itself produce the manifold, but the combination of the manifold; in the Filosofija buduscago the thing in itself is "the fundamental cause which, not being an appearance, produces or engenders appearance" (p. 1). Taking at face value Debol'skij's later statement requires us to radically re-interpret the Vup along lines the text does not permit. 32 Ibid., p. viii. This trajectory, however, also involved reinterpreting the role of the absolute or unity from a pure form to a creative mind that is the non-sensible foundation of all appearances. The best short account to date of Debol'skij's later views can be found in Semen Gruzenberg: Ocerki sovremennoj russkoj filosofii [Sketches of Contemporary Russian Philosophy], St. P., 1911, pp. 7-23. 33 Debol'skij informs us that he does not take exception with the fundamental principle behind the Critique of Practical Reason. Unfortunately he does not inform us what this principle is. N. D-skij: 'Obzor perevodnykh filosofskikh socinenij imejuscikh svjaz s voprosami pedagogii' ['A Survey of Translated Philosophical Works Having to Do With Pedagogical Questions'], Pedagogiceskij sbornik, 1872, # 2, p. 239. 34 Debol'skij fails to comment on why he qualifies activity with the word 'human'. Kant is quite explicit on holding that his is a principle for all rational beings, a fact that the former acknowledges. Moreover, Debol'skij insists on speaking of a single principle not principles, because "it is impossible to admit the existence of several moral standards independent of each other." He does not elaborate further. Ibid., p. 241. 35 Ibid., p. 248. 36 Ibid., p. 241. 37 V. K.: 'Pozitivizm v russkoj literature' ['Positivism in Russian Literature'], Russkoe bogatstvo, 1889, no. 3, pp. 11?12. 38 "P. L. Lavrov already in the Academy had a great influence on the then-forming world-view of Lesevic, who was acquainted with Lavrov and visited him at home." E. Ganejzer: 'V. V.

The entire piece runs from pp. 44?</page><page sequence="29">DEBOL'SKIJ AND LESEVIC ON KANT 309 96. For a contemporary 'appreciation' by a prominent historian/sociologist who received an impulse toward positivism and possibly neo-Kantianism from Lesevic see N. Kareev: 'Pamjati V. V. Lesevica' ['In Memory of V. V. Lesevic'], Sovremennosf, 1906, kn.l, pp. 131-134. 39 Galaktionov and Nikandrov recognize only two periods in Lesevic's development collapsing without foundation the flirtation with neo-Kantianism together with the period under the influence of Avenarius. A. A. Galaktionov and P. F. Nikandrov: Russkaja filosofija IX?XIXvv [Russian Philosophy of the 9th?19th Centuries], L, 1989, p. 459. This hasty and superficial analysis appears to have been a received tenet during the Soviet era, for another historian writes: "Lesevic's philosophical work can be divided into two periods." P. S. Skurinov: Pozitivizm v Rossii XIX veka [Positivism in 19th Century Russia], M. 1980, p. 223. 40 V. Lesevic: Opyt kriticeskago izsledovanija osnovonacal pozitivnoj filosofii [An Attempt at a Critical Investigation of the Fundamental Principles of Positive Philosophy], St. P., 1877 and V. Lesevic: Pis'ma o nacnoj filosofii [Letters on Positive Philosophy], St. P., 1878. Hereafter the former will be referred to as Opyt, and that latter as Pis'ma. Page references to each will appear immediately following the designation. 41 Actually the Opyt is unclear as to whether there is a single, general scientific method or several. 42 Opyt, 93. Cf. Auguste Comte: The Positive Philosophy of Auguste Comte, trans. Harriet Martineau, Calvin Blanchard, NY, 1858, p. 34. 43 Although Lesevic does state that Kant demonstrated this in the 'First Critique' and the Prolegomena he does not specify where in either of these works Kant did so. 44 G. W. F. Hegel: The Logic of Hegel, trans, by William Wallace, Oxford University Press, London, 1965, p. 17. Lesevic does not so much as specify the particular Hegelian writing, let alone the page reference, but his words amount to a translation of the cited passage albeit without indicating that he is quoting Hegel! See Opyt, 135. 45 Lesevic completely misses the point of Hegel's criticism in that a determination of the conditions of swimming is not itself swimming but a determination of the conditions of knowledge would itself be knowledge. 46 One recent writer claims that Lesevic's positivism attempted "to utilize the principles of Kantian critical philosophy." Unfortunately, he fails to argue for this position or provide support for this assertion. It would be interesting to have a specification of what Kantian principles Lesevic allegedly employed ? interesting because there are none that we would recognize as distinctly Kantian. Walicki, op. cit., p. 353. 47 Zenkovsky says that Lesevic's attraction to Lange, Riehl and Paulsen does not speak well of his philosophical penetration since the latter three belonged to three different tendencies in neo-Kantianism. There is, however, no evidence that Lesevic did not himself realize the existence of different schools of neo-Kantianism. That he mentions different authors and has some words of praise for them does not make him a disciple. See Zenkovsky: op. cit., pp. 708?709. 48 Galaktionov and Nikandrov naively contend that in the Pis'ma Lesevic "propagan dizes neo-Kantianism." Op. cit., p. 460. They provide no evidence in support of their claim. 49 Left unsaid here is an undemonstrated connection between corroboration, scien tificity and knowledge. Also unsaid is that a priori knowledge speaks of the means by</page><page sequence="30">310 THOMAS NEMETH which the knowledge is acquired, whereas corroboration has to do with validation or support, as it were, ex post facto. By making such corroboration a necessary condition for knowledge Lesevic has made a priori knowledge impossible by definition. One of the clearest statements of this is: "If hypotheses are proven to be true a posteriori, the explanation is changed into knowledge" (Opyt, 169). 50 Zenkovsky says that Lesevic "studied Kant chiefly through his followers . . ." Op. cit., p. 708. Actually there is no indication that Lesevic studied Kant at any length or in any depth. While to a slight degree expressing some interest in how the neo-Kantians updated an earlier philosophy in light of contemporary scientific developments and drawing on this experience in his own efforts to rework positivism, Lesevic failed to pursue the analogy or concretely carry through with it. 51 The theory of cognition "teaches that only certain representations have an imme diate relation to objects and clearly defines the immediate and general significance of concepts." Opyt, 290. 52 That Lesevic takes "purely immanent material as his point of departure" hardly demonstrates "the unquestionable influence of Kant's epistemology" as Zenkovsky maintains. Op. cit., p. 709. One could just as readily substitute here a host of other names including that of Comte for Kant's. In fact, whereas a case can be made for saying that the 'purely immanent' does serve as Lesevic's terminus a quo in that he claims to adhere rigorously to it and refrain from any deductions that go beyond it, the same cannot be said of Kant. The sense in which Kant takes the 'purely immanent' as his starting point is hardly the same as Lesevic's. 53 Although failing to develop his point further, let alone along Kantian lines, Kozlov noted: "I find the philosophical direction that Lesevic calls 'critical realism' is not clarified by the author of the OpyC A. Kozlov: Review of Opyt kriticeskago izsledovanija osnovonacal pozitivnoj filosofii, Universitetskie izvestija, 1877, vol. 11, p. 370. 54 Zenkovsky correctly sees this as well. Op. cit., p. 710. 55 Solov'ev at least hints that he too recognizes this problem in Lesevic's thought: "The relativity of knowledge is asserted here on the basis that we know only appearances, while the being of things in themselves remains inaccessible to our mind. The very concept of appearance, however, which determines this entire view, is not subjected to sufficient analysis and critique." Vladimir S. Solov'ev: 'Pis'mo k redaktoru Voprosov filosofii i psikhologii, N. Ja. Grotu' ['Letter to the Editor of Problems of Philosophy and Psychology, N. Ja. Grot'], Sobranie socinenij, torn VI, St. P., 1911?1914, pp. 250?251. 56 Lesevic's influence was felt almost exclusively in social scientific methodology, and even there was confined more or less to those sympathetic to Populism. Debol'skij's own critical and dismissive attitude toward his early work ensured its consignment to oblivion. While his later work received some recognition for its quasi-Hegelianism, he was hardly a player in the philosophical disputes of his time to the degree as was, say Cicerin. Providing an entirely uncritical account of Lesevic's views and accepting at face value his claims for a critical positivism Walicki attributes Lesevic's scant influence in part to "the mediocre professional level of the Russian neo-Kantians, but above all to the fact that in Russia the function of neo-Kantianism was not so much to undertake a critique of metaphysical systems as to pave the way for a revival of metaphysical idealism." Walicki, op. cit., p. 356. Not for a moment does Walicki entertain the</page><page sequence="31">DEBOL'SKIJ AND LESEVIC ON KANT 311 possibility that Lesevic's neglect was a result of the meager philosophical content of his thought and in particular that the professed rapprochement with Kantianism was mere talk without substance. The Russian neo-Kantians could not turn to it for guidance or inspiration simply because there was nothing in it that could serve in that capacity. 57 Gogockij's interest in Kant can already be seen in his relatively early short work Kriticiskij vzgljad nafilosofiju Kanta [Critical Views on Kant's Philosophy], Kiev, 1847. Kozlov's doctoral dissertation Genizis teorii prostranstva i vremini Kanta [The Genesis of Kant's Theory of Space and Time], while submitted to St. Petersburg University, was published in Kiev in 1884 as well as serialized in the house organ Kievskie universitetskie izvestija between the years 1882?1884 under the title 'Genezis transcendental'noj estetiki (ili prostranstva i vremini) u Kanta' ['Genesis of Kant's Transcendental Aesthetic (or Theory of Space and Time)']. 1 Hastings Road Old Bridge, NJ 08857 USA</page></plain_text>
