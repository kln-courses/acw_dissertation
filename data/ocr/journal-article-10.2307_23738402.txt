<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW LITERARY STRUCTURE AND THE CONCEPT OF DECADENCE: H UYSMANS, D'ANNUNZIO, AND WILDE Laurence M. Porter DECADENCE, CONSIDERED AS A EUROPEAN LITERARY phenomenon of the last two decades of the nineteenth century usually is char acterized as an unwholesome mess of morbid, neurotic, or maca bre subjects, overly-refined style, and hedonistic protagonists exotic flotsam on a restless impressionistic sea. The decadent hero surrounds himself with a hermetic cocoon, and creates for himself a private, invertebrate, self-consuming, and parthe nogenetic world. The author of decadent literature is ordinar ily assumed to be as self-indulgent and self-absorbed as his hedonistic protagonists. So it would seem almost a contradic tion in terms to associate "structure"—implying detachment and discipline—with literary decadence.1 Such a description fits decadent plots, characters, themes and style rather well. Nevertheless, several reservations must im lAmong the great number of definitions of decadence that have been published, I would particularly recommend Ingeborg Bernhart, "Décadence et style décadent," L'Information Littéraire, 28 (1976), 23-27, with a good bibliography; A. E. Carter, The Idea of Decadence in French Literature, 1830-1900 (The University of Toronto Press, 1958); Francois Livi, J-K Huysmans: "A Rebours" et Vesprit décadent (Paris: Nizet, 1972); and J. M. Smith, "Concepts of Decadence in the 19th Century French Literature," Studies in Philology, 50 (1953), 640-51. Some modern critics have not yet gone beyond a melodramatic hand-wringing in the face of the Decadent movement, defining it as "an unholy worship of evil beauty," and characterizing a work like The Picture of Dorian Gray as "the gleeful recognition and celebration of a depravity whose wellsprings are within the soul" (Christopher S. Nassaar, Into the Demon Universe: A Literary Exploration of Oscar Wilde [Yale University Press, 1974], pp. 10 and 62 [cf. 37]). 188</page><page sequence="2">HUYSMANS. D'ANNUNZIO, AND WILDE mediately occur to a literary historian. Leaving aside the minor figures like Octave Mirbeau who produced long series of penny dreadfuls consistently absorbed with drug abuse, sado-masoch ism, and perverted sexual activity, one finds that the greatest writers among those commonly identified as "decadent"—Huys mans, D'Annunzio, and Wilde—produced "decadent" works during only a brief portion of their careers, as part of a tran sient vogue. Most major "romantic" writers, in contrast, pro duced demonstrably "romantic" works throughout their lives. Applied to literature, moreover, the very word "decadence" smacks of anthropomorphism writ large. It implies that litera ture and society must age, decline, and die together like a human body. Prestigious dramatizations by Baudelaire, La forgue, Eliot, Toynbee and Spengler perpetuated this notion, but the historical fact remains that the apogee of the "deca dent" period in literature, from 1884 to 1900, corresponded to an era of unusual peace, prosperity, and progress in Europe. An extraordinary flowering of literary and artistic creativity ensued, from 1900 till the First World War. Decadent litera ture reflects the stability and self-assurance of a society strong enough to examine itself dispassionately and to satirize its own weaknesses. The decadent protagonist presents a spectacular display of kinky sexuality and diseased estheticism. He turns his back upon the expectations of society. Did like causes—depraved authors—produce like effects? Superficially, the structuring of decadent novels may appear just as lax as the morals of the protagonists. But this apparent untidiness is mimetic. It re flects the moral confusion of the protagonists rather than the fecklessness of the authors. The latter have proven themselves quite capable of artistic self-discipline. Huysmans and Wilde wrote distinguished critical essays. Wilde and D'Annunzio were expert in the formally demanding media of poetry and theater. The good Huysmans critics like Victor Brombert, Lilian Fürst, and Michael Issacharoff have recently avoided the term "de cadent" altogether: in the summer 1976 issue of Nineteenth Century French Studies, Alice Kaminsky formally proposed 189</page><page sequence="3">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW abandoning it.2 I should like to evade this Lovejoyian skep ticism (I allude to his famous article "On the Discrimination of Romanticisms"), and identify the structural features in our authors which may reveal a clearer picture of the confusion. II With A Rebours in 1884, Huysmans inaugurated the decadent novel. Many painstakingly documented chapters form an epi sodic parade of the protagonist's tastes in interior decoration; women; literature; jewels; liqueurs; the visual arts; philosophy; flowers; candies; mistresses; perfumes; foreign countries; and music. The topics fall into no obvious order. With the hind sight provided by Huysmans' later novels, one might say that the protagonist Des Esseintes is fitfully, unwittingly living the initial stages of a return to religion through art, a program drawn up years before, incidentally, by Chateaubriand in Le Génie du Christianisme. But the potential archetypal pattern of Withdrawal, Enlightenment, and Return is never actualized. Enlightenment does not reach Des Esseintes in his suburban refuge, and his reluctant return to Parisian mediocrity is forced by his doctor's orders. Plotless though it may be, Huysmans' A Rebours is not an anomaly. Like Flaubert's Bouvard et Pécuchet five years be fore, it revives the ancient, elusive genre which Northrop Frye has labeled "anatomy," and which he and Bakhtin have also called "Menippean satire." Anatomy consists in a rich com pendium of opinion. Its unity is thematic rather than mimetic. It grows out of what one might call an author's encyclopedic ambitions or, less admiringly, a magpie instinct to gather odd information. Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy would be a classical example. The anatomy often employs a cena or ban 2See Victor Brombert, "Huysmans et la Thébai'de raffinée," Critique, 30 (November 1974), 973-94!

(Balzac fre quently exploits this device.) The banquet also reduplicates on the physical plane the avid ingestion of ideas—a characteristic joyfully parodied in the first version of Flaubert's Tentation de saint Antoine which juxtaposes the cerebral saint and his gluttonous pet pig. Frye observes that the anatomy deals less with people as such than with mental attitudes . . . The Men ippean satire . . . differs from the novel in its characterization, which is stylized rather than naturalistic, and presents people as mouthpieces of the ideas they represent. ... A constant theme in the tradition is the ridicule of ... a kind of maddened pedantry which the philosophus gloriosas at once symbolizes and defines. ... At its most concentrated the Menippean satire presents us with a vision of the world in terms of a single intellectual pattern. The intellectual structure built up from the story makes for vio lent dislocations in the customary logic of narration. . . . the dramatic in terest is in a conflict of ideas rather than in character.3 No decadent masterpiece after A Rebours is an anatomy. The reason why, I think, is that anatomies tend to serve the purpose of exploring new materials—they represent an intellectual fer ment, a grand brassage d'idées, at the outset of a new literary movement. Examples would be the pre-Renaissance trésors, Pierre Bayle's Dictionnaire historique et critique, or Madame de Staél's De l'Allemagne. As Huysmans put it in his retro spective 1903 preface to A Rebours, his motivating desire had been "to shake off prejudices, to break apart the limits of the novel, to introduce art, science, and history into it; in a word, no longer to use that form except as a frame into which more important undertakings might be inserted."4 After 1884, Huys mans, D'Annunzio, and Wilde all reveal the residual influence of the anatomy genre, in their affinity for lengthy conversa tional debates: between the cynical Lord Wotton and the ideal istic Basil Hallward in Wilde's Picture of Dorian Gray; be tween the scientist Des Hermies and the novelist Durtal in ^Northrop Frye, Anatomy of Criticism (Princeton University Press, 1957), p. 310. 4Joris-Karl Huysmans, A Rebours (Paris: G.

(Huysmans, of course, returned to the anatomy form in 1898 with the non decadent work, La Cathédrale, a compendium of information concerning Christian symbolism.) This practice of imparting information through dialogue contrasts with the massive author ial treatises used to present background information in the realist and naturalist novel. Here again, Flaubert's polyphonic Tentation de saint Antoine marks him as a precursor. Huysmans' reflections on a new form for the novel led natur ally to the self-conscious structure called the mise en abyme, after Gide's Journal for 1893.5 The English expression is "internal reduplication." This means that a stylized replica of the main novel or other artistic work is contained within the whole as one of its parts. In the strict sense upon which I would insist in order to distinguish internal reduplication in the arts from related concepts, it must fulfill five conditions. (1) Its presentation must be mimetic rather than diagetic: it must be rendered, described, or cited, rather than being merely named or alluded to. (2 8c 3) It must not be subject to metaphorical displacement: the inner replica must be in the same medium as the main work, and it must have the same general subject. (4 8c 5) It must not be subject to metonymic displacement: the inner replica must be introduced or created by a main char acter, and it must have an effect upon the plot. Perhaps the best-known literary examples are the play within a play in Ham let, and the inner novel of Gide's Les Faux-Monnayeurs. Thus internal reduplication (which I shall use synonymously with mise en abyme) may be distinguished from related devices such as allusion, ecphrasis, symbol, parastory, exemplum, and sub BThe best study of internal reduplication to date is Bruce Morrissette's "Un héritage d'André Gide: la duplication intérieure," Comparative Literature Studies, 8 (1971), 125-42.

There Des Esseintes has an inner room, made like a ship's cabin, constructed inside his dining room. Separated from the outer window by an aquar ium, this shell creates a monde gigogne "like those Japanese nesting boxes which fit one inside the other" (p. 29). Huysmans' next novel, La-bas, transforms internal reduplica tion from a transient motif to a generative principle. At the outset, the writer-protagonist Durtal complains that the reign ing Naturalist literature has regrettably obliterated the neces sary, desirable distinction between art and world, by embracing the trivial, contemporary, and vulgar. He proposes an esthetic counter-ideal of a spiritual naturalism, exemplified by Christ's crucified body in Griinewald's altar-piece. Huysmans seconds Durtal's efforts to separate art and world, by transforming the main narrative into a framework for Durtal's biography of Gilles de Rais, a case study of Satanism and sadistic pedophilia in the Middle Ages. Generally speaking, the persistent auto biographic element in Huysmans' fiction (he admits to it in En Marge) is intrinsically antinaturalistic insofar as it renounces attempts at an objective, scientifically verifiable observation of the world. So far as I know, La-bas is the first novel about writing a book in which that book is actually quoted in extenso, if one excludes autobiographical accounts and confessions (like Machaut's Voir dit) which contain the story of their own making. It takes up one-third of the text. Elsewhere, Durtal's friendship with Carhaix, and his prolonging his liaison with the demonic Mme Chantelouve, are substantially motivated by his desire to docu ment himself on the supernatural and the Black Mass (a desire which depends, in turn, upon his "unsuspected, and hitherto unexpressed, mysticism"—chapter 7).

Just before Durtal re ceives the first anonymous letter of seduction from Mme Chan telouve, Gilles' hired magician encounters Satan. Gilles' recon version to Christianity occurs shortly before Durtal completes his arrangements to attend the Black Mass, disgust at which will cure his curiosity concerning the demonic. Throughout, the banquet setting inherited from Menippean satire accom panies a lively exchange of views in Carhaix's apartment con cerning the symbolism of bells, Manicheism, Satanism, spirits, and exorcism. Ill Oscar Wilde shared Huysmans' esthetic aim of re-establishing barriers between life and art. His essay "The Decay of Lying" defines "the true decadence" from which "we are now suffer ing" as the final stage of cultural decline, "when life gets the upper hand, and drives art out into the wilderness."7 Great art demands detachment, and "all bad poetry springs from genuine feeling" Wilde comments in "The Critic as Artist" (CW, p. 1052). Or as Wilde put it tersely at the beginning of his early poem, "Hélas": To drift with every passion till my soul Is a stringed lute on which all winds can play, Is it for this that I have given away My ancient wisdom, and austere control? (CIE, p. 709) The painter Basil Hallward, in Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray published in 1890, "initially agrees with his creator. He claims that "an artist should create beautiful things, but should put nothing of his own life into them. We live in an age when men treat art as if it were meant to be a form of autobiography. We have lost the abstract sense of beauty" (CW, p. 25). But Basil, like the actress Sybil Vane and like Dorian himself, lets 7Complete Works of Oscar Wilde (London and Glasgow: Collins, 1968 [1948]), p. 978 [CW], There is an excellent brief summary of Wilde's critical positions in the preface to The Artist as Critic: Critical Writings of Oscar Wilde, ed.

The portrait of the title results from a confusion between life and art, a loss of control. Basil paints it because of his unconscious homosexual attraction to Dorian. This bond makes his creative powers dependent on Dorian's presence and his friendship. Sybil's acting talents derive wholly from feelings sublimated and diffused because they have as yet no object. Once she falls in love, she can no longer act. Dorian embraces callous hedon ism when the painting's incorruptible beauty and Lord Wot ton's insidious words show him how fleeting is his own physical existence and opportunities for pleasure. He becomes the sec ond creator of his portrait as his sins slowly transform it into a seamed and leering mask, but he cannot direct its changes, and his inclinations to repentance cannot alter the image for the better. Because Basil, Dorian, and Sybil admit life into the do main of art, art loses the frame which keeps it inviolate. Like Mallarmé's Hérodiade and Valéry's Jeune Parque, it falls sub ject to contingency. IV The early D'Annunzio, scorned in Italy but acclaimed in France, published II Piacere in 1889. The self-contemplating attitude of that first novel is evident not only in comparisons of the artist-hero and the ladies who attract him to famous paintings, but also in the reproduction of four of the hero's sonnets, and in one true mise en abyme. The last, a thirty-page intimate journal, anticipates Alissa's journal in Gide's La Porte étroite by twenty years. With it, D'Annunzio spells out what Huysmans and Wilde suggest: the mise en abyme results from the emergence to awareness of what had been subliminal. Ob viously the demonic adventures of Gilles de Rais in Lá-bas suggest the repressed instinctual life which we fear; likewise, the attic room where Dorian locks up his deformed portrait is the epitome of repression. In retrospect, Huysmans realized, and discussed at length, how A Rebours instinctively antici pated, in microcosm, all his future work of Catholic inspira 195</page><page sequence="9">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW tion (1903 preface, xiv-xxi). And Wilde stated in "The Critic as Artist": It seems to me that with the development of the critical spirit we shall be able to realise, not merely our own lives, but the collective life of the race. ... It is not our own life that we live, but the lives of the dead, and the soul that dwells within us is no single spiritual entity, making us per sonal and individual, created for our service. . . . We have whispered the secret of our love beneath the cowl of Abelard, and in the stained raiment of Villon have put our shame into song. ... It is the imagination that enables us to lead these countless lives . . . and the imagination is the result of heredity. It is simply concentrated race-experience (CW, p. 1041). Huysmans' Catholicism, and Wilde's imagination, are mani festations of the collective unconscious. But D'Annunzio overtly associates unconscious mental proc esses with the device of internal reduplication. The angelic Maria Ferres' journal quite literally depicts her desperate strug gle to subdue her increasing love for the protagonist. Reflecting on the mystery of another nascent attraction, D'Annunzio ana lyzes the situation as a phenomenon so often encountered in our mental world, when the germ of an idea or a shadowy fancy suddenly reappears before us after a long interval of unconscious development as a finished picture, a complex thought. . . . The same law governs all the varying activities of our being; and the activities of which we are conscious form but a small part of the whole.8 D'Annunzio's third novel, 11 Trionfo della Morte, refines his internal reduplications. He combines three potential, rather than actual, mises an abyme in a series. They show the passive hero George imprisoned by his past, like the writhing moth which his dominating Hippolyta pins in her hair. His morbid dependency on others is reflected by his inability to do more than to recreate others' remembered actions, feelings, and works of art. The series reveals George's creative capacity diminish ing together with his possibilities for action. In Part One he 8Gabriele D'Annunzio, The Child of Pleasure (II Piacere) (New York: Modern Library, 1925), chapter 8, p. 68. 196</page><page sequence="10">HUYSMANS, D'ANNUNZIO, AND WILDE and Hippolyta reread and comment on the three hundred love letters he had written her. In Part Two he recalls the Tennyson poem, "The Princess," which he had translated for his favorite uncle, and thinks of imitating his uncle's suicide as a means of retreat from his lecherous father and desperate mother. In Part Six, George no longer composes (the letters) nor translates (the poem), but simply performs Wagner's Tristram and Isolde on the piano. Both opera and poem link love with death and foreshadow George's leap over a cliff, with the struggling Hip polyta in his arms. D'Annunzio's decision not to actualize the mises en abyme of II Trionfo della Morte weakens the inward-looking structure of the novel. Inspired by the example of Zola and Wagner, he reinforces it in another way. He makes the causal network around the protagonist temporal rather than spatial. Realism had set its heroes in a spatial network: their behavior and destiny were determined by physical, economic, and political circum stance. D'Annunzio, in contrast, makes George's fate depend upon his interaction with three pasts: personal, familial, and racial. George's disgust at his own father makes him see family life as devoid of value. Hereditary degeneracy forces the main characters, Zola-like, to re-enact the sins of their forebears. Hip polyta, formerly an epileptic, "found a special pleasure in arti ficially exciting and tormenting her own feelings." George, himself delicate and refined, nevertheless suffers from "the hereditary lewdness" of his father, so that in him "sensuality had assumed almost morbid forms."9 Moreover, D'Annunzio, inspired by Zola and Wagner, continues to exploit the Leit motive which he had introduced in his second novel, L'lnno cente. These verbal refrains are identical or nearly identical sentences recurring at several different points in the narrative, and pointing to the obsessional preoccupations of the charac ters. Zola had employed them to evoke an atavistic instinctual self harking back to the caveman, driven by lust and rage. D'An nunzio uses them to show George enslaved by memories and "D'Annunzio, The Triumph of Death (II Trionfo della Morte) (New York: The Modern Library, [1923]), pp. 171 and 300. 197</page><page sequence="11">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW fascinated with suicide. But he uses them far more frequently than Zola. And D'Annunzio, like Wagner but unlike Zola, also finds positive values in the unconscious: it functions as the re pository of collective, instinctual wisdom reflected in cere monies, rituals, and songs. Hearing the pilgrims sing Ave Maria as they pass by night, George feels that in their song the rites of dead and forgotten religious survived; incomprehensible sym bols of powers fallen centuries ago subsisted there intact. . . . They were transmitted from generation to generation like an inner heritage, inherent in the corporeal substance. ... As much as the mountains, the valleys, and the rivers . . . they formed a part of the structure of the country and of the race.10 The notion of a collective unconscious recurs in D'Annun zio's II Fuoco in 1900. The hero Stelio's formal lecture, which occupies forty pages, celebrates "the occult genius of the [Ital ian] race."11 This mise en abyme once more represents the emergence of unconscious contents to awareness. Stelio eschews his prepared text and entrusts himself to inspiration. As he speaks, Little by little he felt his effort becoming easier and the efficacy of his will being supplemented by an energy free and obscure as an instinct that rose from the depths of his unconsciousness, operating by an occult process impossible to gauge (pp. 51-2). Elsewhere in II Fuoco, D'Annunzio's growing familiarity with internal reduplication enables him knowingly to create physical metaphors of the unconscious. When the heroine, La Foscarina, looks down a well-shaft at "that deep inner mirror," she sees "her own face . . . her terror and her ruin . . . the immovable Medusa which she carried in the center of her soul," and in her imagination she sees Stelio's face next to that of her dreaded rival, Donatella Arvale (p. 253). Later she again experiences terror when the lovers visit a deserted estate where Stelio insists on lOD'Annunzio, The Triumph of Death, p. 230. Cf. pp. 286, 355, 373, and 375.

La Foscarina instinctively fears to enter, and when she does she cannot leave Stelio. He, absorbed by the myth of Theseus which comes to life in him, desires a fresh young virgin to conquer. When he reaches through a gap in the hedge, playfully to seize La Foscarina's dress, she can read in his lust ful expression that he is momentarily confusing her with Don atella (pp. 282-91). In these two scenes, both juxtaposed with the word "unconscious" or "unconsciousness," the heroine must confront her repressed jealousy and fear of growing old, first in her own face and then in Stelio's. V Such self-reflexive elements in the structure of the prose fiction of European decadence divert the gaze of the work—as in con temporary Symbolism—away from the outside world towards internal, esthetic problems. Introversion suggests that the out side world is a preliminary sketch for the work of art, more highly organized than the world because its vision integrates the rational and material with the supernatural and the uncon scious. But the internal reduplications of decadent literature serve also as the vehicles of a quasi-naturalistic insight: uncon scious forces underlie the surface of our conscious psyche, and also link us to domains outside the self. In short, the greatest "decadent" literature is not a weird paracriminal aberration by the counterculture of the Victorian age, but rather, a re spectable tributary of modern psychoanalytical thought. Perhaps the most noteworthy adventure of modern criticism, based as it is upon psychological insights, has been to identify and analyze the mental constructs which have generated our successive images of Western man. At the turn of the century, the Cartesian model dominant for the past two hundred years had relegated non-rational mental activity beyond the pale of humanness. But during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, writers began to test the boundaries of this "human ness" by employing dreamers, madmen, and the devil as pro tagonists. The greatest romantic dream-literature (Blake, No 199</page><page sequence="13">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW valis, Nerval . . . ) subverted the rationality not only of the literary characters, but of the literary structure as well, through the devices of the layering of narration, the doubling and split ting of characters, narrative discontinuity (creating meaning through juxtaposition, like Philip Wheelwright's "diaphor"), and the archetype of Inversion (a peripety accompanied by a reversal of values). Like the romantic layering of narration, the Decadent mise en abyme creates the semblance of a repressed unconscious embedded within the conscious mind. At this juncture we are not far from the practice of writers like Proust and Joyce, where characters' unconscious mental processes per vade and shape long sections of the narrative. Thus Decadence constitutes an essential episode in the deconstruction of the neatly compartmentalized Cartesian duality, composed of the conscious self and the unconscious world. 200</page></plain_text>
