<plain_text><page sequence="1">Like a Whisper in the Heart Steven Janeo SAB G.I.A., G-4614, $1.20 Steven Janeo describes his piece as "a contemporary Christmas madrigal" and requests that it be performed playfully. The lyrics mix sacred and secular refer ences in a manner comparable to earlier carol/madrigals, such as Tomorrow Shall Be My Dancing Day and The Holly and the Ivy. The Sylvia Dunstan poem meta phorically grants anthropomorphic char acteristics to stones which "shout reply" to the extraordinarily busy angels, who are "singing, winging, swinging, leaping, and flinging wide the doors." This activ ity culminates in the final statement, "Glory, glory welcoming Peace, my love, forever more. Gloria in excelsis Deo." It is a joyous piece, frivolous enough to use in a secular setting and serious enough for a church service or concert. Best of all, the SAB contrapuntal score is skillfully constructed, with simple voice leading, moderate voice ranges, and beau tiful, fun phrases in each of the three parts. Without exception, groups of four sixteenth notes are scale passages in the key of F major. Specific interpretive mark ings—dynamics, breath marks, staccatos, etc.—provide great opportunities to teach musical symbols and terms, and basic rhythmic combinations of notes. Clean layout of the contrapuntal lines allows singers to easily look up or down to other parts to compare various combinations of notes that make up one beat or a full measure—an excellent tool for teaching musical notation and sight-singing. This practical and fun composition is appro priate for middle school, junior high, high CHORAL JOURNAL oicir SIMON CARRINGTON Rodney Eichenberger André Thomas • Orchestra Michael Allen Dean angeles Bob Gillespie • Bobby Adams Jim croft Michael Haithcock Craig Kirchhoff Anthony Maiello JVillSicatr, IS SPONSORED BY CCIS WWW.MUSICATE.COM Featuring a 2-hour private Clinic for Your Band, Choir or orchestra with a Nationally known Conductor! tv «ail dkcwiye, sdncaticha! opt i ok to tcstirais ccmpetitioks?
