Washington, DC: The Catholic University of America Press, 1998. 312 pp. Cloth, $59.95?This collection includes essays by contemporary scholars on a range of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century thinkers. Because space precludes commentary on every contribution, I will fo cus on the introduction by McCarthy and the essays by Richard Ken nington, Pamela Kraus, Robert P. Kraynak, Paul J. Bagley, and Nicholas Capaldi. In a well-crafted introduction, McCarthy explores several ironies that attend our inheritance of the Enlightenment. We habitually speak of the Enlightenment (rather than one illumination among others), yet it re mains that "public opinion accords far greater esteem to the Buddha, or even Socrates, than to any Enlightenment thinker one might care to mention" (p. 2). We fancy ourselves to have surpassed the Enlighten ment, yet by subscribing to the notion that we are wiser than our ances tors, we endorse an idea of essentially Baconian origin (p. 3). These iro nies prepare McCarthy to make the claim that none of the major thinkers of the Enlightenment is transparent. A considerable amount of "exegetical energy" (p. 11) is required to understand their texts. This is true not only because "modern thinkers have not always disclosed their thoughts with the utmost candor or frankness" (p. 11), but also because "egalitarian skepticism," the inability to suspend "everyday human alle giances," and the hermeneutically intolerant nature of "postmodern tol erance" (p. 12) make it difficult for contemporary readers to take seri ously their ambition to understand the whole. Kennington's essay on "Bacon's Reform of Nature" raises the question whether the primary goal of modern rationalism is the speculative ap prehension of truth or the practical mastery of nature. Holding that Bacon addresses the problems that arise from this question "not only first, but more fully than anyone after" (p. 43), Kennington argues that modernity follows Bacon in adopting the mastery goal. Although Bacon makes extensive use of biblical language, Kennington vigorously denies that his revision of philosophy's telos is biblically inspired. Rather, "by knowingly altering the meaning of biblical charity, Bacon provides a bib lical sanction for the humanitarian character of modern science" (p. 45). For this science, Kennington argues, "the truth of propositions about natural things is established not by reference to that which is always and everywhere, but by means of method, by a methodical verification, at a particular place: naturalism is inevitably historical" (p. 50). Ken nington's suggestion of a strong link between "naturalism" and histori cal inquiry, whether or not adequately substantiated, may go some way toward illuminating why a thinker like Vico would have been as sympa thetic to Bacon as he was. Pamela Kraus examines "Method and Metaphysics: The Foundation of Philosophy in the Discourse on Method." Her intention is to avoid the usual habit of interpreting the Discourse by reference to other, allegedly more coherent Cartesian texts. What justifies according hermeneutic priority to the Discourse is the fact that it is "the only writing that treats the whole of Cartesian philosophy and shows the parts of that philoso phy in relation to one another" (pp. 57-8). Kraus considers the relation between part 2 and part 4, between "method" and "metaphysics." She</page><page sequence="2">SUMMARIES AND COMMENTS 159 rejects the common notion that Descartes begins the turn to rigorous philosophy in part 4; her claim is that part 2 and part 4 are essentially continuous. In part 2, Descartes is less concerned to embark upon the quest for certainty than to "establish a new kind of philosophy" (p. 63). This is accomplished through the decision "to transform philosophy into an art" (p. 64). But how can philosophy, thus transformed, be the basis of all human inquiry rather than one art among others? In part 4, ac cording to Kraus, Descartes's main concern is to address this problem by replacing the authority of nature with the free exercise of reason and by grounding the art of philosophy in the power of the human mind. Kraus emphasizes the novelty of Descartes's reflection on the human mind. One might, however, take her analysis of the replacement of ne cessity with possibility as the mind's object to be additional confirma tion of the view that Descartes is best understood as a successor to Scotus and Ockham. Robert P. Kraynak's essay on "Hobbes and the Dogmatism of the Enlightenment" takes aim at the view that Hobbes's thought is an an tidote to dogmatism. Rather, Hobbes propounds "a new form of dogmatism... that is more insidious and dangerous than any kind al leged to spring from classical and medieval thought" (p. 78). Kraynak locates this dogmatism not in Hobbes's personality or rhetorical style but in his separation of the mind from nature. Hobbes's radical rejec tion of opinion requires him to take the mind itself as the new starting point of philosophy. For Hobbes, he argues, the mind must reject any thing external to itself and rely upon "self-evident mental ideas or arbi trary constructs" (p. 84). Once Hobbes has radically detached the mind from nature, Kraynak asks, how can he reconnect it with reality so that it can apprehend something beyond its own operation? Here Kraynak finds Hobbes's only option to be "dogmatic assertion," understood as in cipient idealism, "the creation of reality from mental concepts by willful assertion" (p. 89). Hobbes's commitment to constructivism runs far deeper than many commentators suspect (as I attempt to show in Truth in the Making, New York: Routledge, 2003). As a corrective to the view that Hobbes is essentially an empiricist, Kraynak's essay is valuable. His suggestion that Hobbes's philosophy boils down to simple dogmatism, unable to offer any support for its premises beyond mere assertion, would require more development. In "Spinoza, Biblical Criticism, and the Enlightenment," Paul J. Bagley reminds us of the large influence exerted by the Tractatus theologico politicus on the Enlightenment. Spinoza examines the Bible closely in order to expose traditional theological doctrines as human inventions with no basis in Scripture itself. He thus appears to assume that Scrip ture has a clear meaning, ascertainable by careful application of his new method. What such application actually shows, however, is that much of Scripture has no stable meaning at all, so that "the genuine signifi cance of scriptural teachings will have to be reducible to a few plain, simple, and universal instructions" (p. 135). These instructions appear to coincide with the Tractatus's seven articles of faith that teach obedi ence to God, which Spinoza identifies as the sole purpose of Scripture. These articles of faith, Bagley observes, assume that "God is a king or a sovereign ruler who governs, judges, and shows mercy" (p. 143). Ac cording to the Tractatus itself, however, any such anthropomorphic</page><page sequence="3">160 ELIZABETH C. SHAW AND STAFF characterization of the divine nature is derived ex captu vulgi, a false prejudice incompatible with the philosophic idea of God as a being that acts only from the necessity of his own nature and perfection. Thus, ac cording to Bagley, Spinoza ironically "compels his attentive readers to a kind of faithlessness" (p. 144). Bagley concludes that Spinoza's esoteri cism indicates his preference for an Enlightenment "more akin to that described by Plato than to that advocated by Kant" (p. 149). Closing the volume is Nicholas Capaldi's essay on "The Enlighten ment Project in Twentieth-Century Philosophy." Capaldi wants to dis tinguish Bacon, Descartes, and Hobbes from their eighteenth-century heirs on the ground that only the latter believe in the autonomous and self-explanatory character of natural science. Twentieth-century posi tivism shares this commitment, according to Capaldi, who claims that analytic philosophy as a whole inherits the technicist framework. Be cause he holds that contemporary analytic philosophers take "science as their model" (p. 275), Capaldi infers that such analysts will have diffi culty thinking beyond their own framework and are therefore more akin to technicians than philosophers. "The analytic technician always hopes to escape the limitations with more technique; in this, he con fuses technique with science. The riders and the tunes change, but the carousel's progress is illusory" (p. 275). Some of Capaldi's claims are formulated too generally to convince those not already sympathetic with his standpoint. Nonetheless, his insights into the dependence of the technical upon the pretechnical and the essential unity of the En lightenment project are important and admit of further development (perhaps through dialogue with the work of Stanley Rosen and Alasdair Maclntyre). Modern Enlightenment and the Rule of Reason is edited to a high standard. It is refreshing to have a volume of essays that address the philosophical core of modernity, without reducing it to a debate be tween "rationalists" and "empiricists." The collection succeeds admira bly in prompting us to rethink the foundational texts of modern enlight enment.?Robert C. Miner, Baylor University.</page></plain_text>
