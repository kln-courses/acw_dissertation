<plain_text><page sequence="1">HEBREW UNION COLLEGE ANNUAL The need for additional media for Jewish scholarly works has been greatly felt for a number of years and it was this that stimulated the late Professor David Neumark to publish The Journal of Jewish Lore and Philosophy, four numbers of which appeared. The publication was later taken over by the Board of Governors of the Hebrew Union College, who decided to issue an annual instead of the former quarterly. With characteristic liberality, the Board of editors invited scholars from various lands and of various shades of religious belief to contribute their efforts and the first three volumes include valuable scientific studies in every branch of Jewish learning. The first volume, almost double in size of each of the other two, is divided into seven sections, including Biblical, Hellenistic, Talmudic, Philosophical, Poetic, Historical and Modern Studies. The biblical division is introduced by a Study of the First Chapter of Genesis, by M. Lambert, who follows in the trodden path of the higher critics. He elaborates on the theory, often advanced, that this chapter consists of at least two versions, one primitive and anthropomorphic, the other more idealistic and scientific. Wherever a phrase or a clause fits in neither version, it is assumed to be the work of a later redactor. In two parallel- columns, the author gives the two versions as he conceives 2 Hebrew Union College Annual. Board of Editors: DAVID PHILIP- SON, Chairman; K. KOHLER, JACOB Z.

About ten years ago, Dr. Julian Morgenstern published a paper in this journal in which he brought forth the novel suggestion that the festival of Sukkot was orignally celebrated from the third day of Tishri to the tenth of the same month, the last day being regarded as a separate holiday, which was designated as the New Year. Continuing his studies along these lines, he succeeded in working out a theory about the existence of three distinct calendars in ancient Israel, which he elabo- rates in greater detail in a lengthy contribution to this volume. The supposition that the three calendars differed only in the manner in which the months were known, is discarded by him. While it is true that the early Canaanite calendar had names for the months descriptive of the agricultural seasons in which they fell, as is indicated by the four surviving names in the Bible, and that the second calendar indicates the months by number and the third by the Babylonian names, Dr. Morgenstern believes that the differences in these calendars were much more vital, affecting the observance of the festivals in the various seasons of the year. According to his opinion, the transition from the first calen- dar to the second took place some time about 586 B.C.E., and from the second to the third calendar at the end of the fourth century. The first, Canaanite Calendar, was a purely solar calendar, while the second was a luni-solar calendar, retaining, however, the old agricultural festivals at about the same time of the year as in the older calendar. It was not until after the period of Ezra and Nehemiah that the dates of the festivals began to be shifted and the New Year day was transferred to the first day of the seventh month and the Sukkot festival to the fif- teenth of the month, while the Passover festival was celebrated on the fifteenth of the first month. It was then also that the tenth day of Tishri assumed the importance that was later attached to it, with the complex ritual of sacrifices introduced by the priests. The third calendar, in which the months are known by their Babylonian names, did not come into existence as an accomplished fact until the beginning of the Chris- tian era, and since then has been the official calendar in use among Jews. The presentation of this very novel theory is most striking and the numerous citations which are brought to support every successive step make it appear quite plausible. It will be of interest to note what Bibli- cal scholars will have to say regarding the various details in this study. Among the other Biblical Studies included here is one by William Popper on "The Sequence of some Prophecies in the First Isaiah," in</page><page sequence="3">292 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW which the author reveals to us some hidden beauties of diction and suggests in passing the transference of some lines from their present position so as to enhance their rhetorical value. Dr. E. Taubler discusses "Kharu, Horim, Dedanim," the names of certain tribes inhabiting Canaan in the pre-Israelitish period and quotes copiously from Egyptian inscriptions to establish their identity. Dr. Harry Torczyner, in his article "The Riddle in the Bible," discusses the various uses made by biblical writers of the riddle, including a very ingenious interpretation of the nineteenth Psalm, which is regarded by him as a remnant of an ancient riddle. The place of the Book of Ruth in the Bible forms the subject of a study by L. B. Wolfenson, who endeavors to assert that the term "canon," as understood by Jews, applied only to laws and regula- tions such as are included in the Pentateuch, although there is a second- ary sense to the term, that of a collection of books conforming to a certain standard. The last article in this division is that of Samuel Krauss, dealing with the "Service Tree in the Bible and Talmud and in Modern Palestine." After discussing the meaning of the term Mesha in Gen. 10. 30, which has puzzled all commentators, the author arrives at the conclusion that Mesha was a service tree, after which the country was named and later the people inhabiting the country. He digresses often to explain the meaning of other words and names, even private names, where he is able to display his extensive knowledge of Talmudic archeology, a branch in which he is now the recognized master. Admit- ting that the venerable Immanuel Loew, the authority on the botany of the Talmud, has not approved of his conclusions, he still dedicates this study to Loew in honor of his seventieth birthday anniversary. The section devoted to Hellenistic Studies is initiated by an article on Early Christian Epigraphy, by Ludwig Blau. The publication of a volume on this subject some time ago by Karl Maria Kaufmann stimu- lated Dr. Blau to search in it for references to Jews and Judaism, of which he found quite a few. The closeness of the early Christians to Judaism is evidenced not only by their frequent quotations from the Bible, but also by their use of phrases and even theological concepts found in the Rabbinic literature. The apocryphal legend of Asenath, daughter of Potiphar and wife of Joseph, is treated in a lengthy contribution by Dr. V. Aptowitzer. After presenting a wealth of material from rabbinic literature dealing with the character of Asenath, some indicating that she was really a member of the family of Jacob, being the daughter of Dinah by Shechem, and others speaking of the manner in which she delivered Joseph from the</page><page sequence="4">HEBREW UNION COLLEGE-GREENSTONE 293 hands of Potiphar, the author proceeds to the consideration of the apocryphon, "The Legend of Asenath," discovered in the Greek language in the sixth century and soon after translated into Syriac. It is his opinion that the booklet was written originally in Hebrew, by a Pales- tinian Jew during the first century, and was soon translated, also by a Jew, into Greek, with the aim of having it serve the purpose of pro- paganda among the heathen, when the movement towards Judaism on the part of cultured pagans was at its highest. Asenath, an Egyptian woman, devoted to the idolatrous worship of the Egyptians, was ac- quainted with Joseph and through him with the religion of Abraham and became a faithful and devoted follower of that religion. This story was regarded best fitted to attract the many heathens who could no more be satisfied with their ancestral faiths to adopt the Jewish religion. The religion of the Jews at the time of Jesus is identified by Dr. Louis Ginzberg with the religion of the Pharisees, which was identical with the religious views of the great masses of the people at that time. Taking Harnack's idea of the teachings of Jesus as being viewed from three aspects, namely the Kingdom of God and its coming, God the Father, and the infinite value of the human soul and the higher righte- ousness and the commandment of love, the author elaborates these three concepts as understood by the Pharisees, according to the tradi- tions found in rabbinic literature. This article is the substance of a lecture which the author delivered before the Harvard Divinity School several years ago. Dr. Jacob Mann again reviews the several Jewish institutions to which reference is made in the Synoptic Gospels. Among these are the rite of circumcision, the'redemption of the first-born son, the pilgrimages to Jerusalem, marriage ceremonies and table customs and the "last supper" as a paschal meal. In most instances he finds that the Gospels simply recorded customs that actually existed among Jews during that period, although he sometimes is confronted with references that are not borne out by the known practices of contemporaneous Jewry. The last article in this division is by Dr. Solomon Zeitlin, who dis- cusses related subjects from the standpoint of their treatment in the Gospels. His conclusions in several instances are at variance with ac- cepted beliefs and theories of modern and ancient scholars and he characteristically concludes his study by expressing his doubt about the historicity of the central figure in the Christian religion. Baptism for proselytes, so frequently mentioned in the Gospels, he believes was not a Jewish Halakah until after 65 C.E., so that all New Testament</page><page sequence="5">294 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW references to this must be regarded as additions after that date. He ingeniously distinguishes between the "washing of the hands" and the "impurity attached to the hands," the former being an institution es- tablished in 65 C.E., a modification of the laws of purity. It is doubtful whether this theory, which attaches such great importance to the eighteen Gezerot, instituted in 65 C.E., and which Dr. Zeitlin has made the pivotal point for many a departure from ancient traditions, in a number of articles, will be accepted by scholars generally. With regard to a matter that has been the subject of controversy among scholars for centuries, one should not be so positive in his assertions. A Genizah fragment, which Dr. Israel Abrahams acquired and which is now in the Library of the Hebrew Union College, contains several fragments of prayers. The first is a form of Viddui (Confession of Sins) and it is in this that Dr. Abrahams believed to have found the lost con- fession of Mar Samuel, mentioned only by its initial words in Yoma 87b. Whether the identification is established or not, the fragment is certainly deserving of the close attention of students of the Jewish liturgy. "The Origin and Composition of the Eighteen Benedictions" is the subject to which Dr. K. Kohler devoted much time and energy. Even after the many new investigations of the subject, since the time of Zunz, Dr. Kohler finds the subject of fascinating interest. While discarding the Talmudic tradition that the origin of the Eighteen Benedictions is to be ascribed to the Men of the Great Synagogue, and even regarding the institution of the Keneset ha-Gedolah itself as fictitious, Dr. Kohler still finds that the Eighteen Benedictions arose at an early age, possibly in pre-Maccabean times, and came from a Hasidean source. He analyzes the benedictions found in our present version, comparing them with other versions and throwing new light on many phrases and expressions found there. Perhaps the most interesting part of this article is the translation given at the end from the seventh book of the Apostolic Constitutions, which the author regards as having originated in Jewish prayers. The notes accompanying the translation indicate how the early Christians made use of the Essene prayers, only in very few cases adding a reference to Jesus. Dr. Jacob Z. Lauterbach discusses "The Arrangement and the division of the Mekilta," showing the confusion that exists in the present editions, which vary from one another and especially from the two manuscripts, the Oxford and the Munich. He also mentions another manuscript of the fourteenth century in the Library of the Jewish Theological Semi- nary, of a work in which frequent references are made to the Mekilta,</page><page sequence="6">HEBREW UNION COLLEGE-GREENSTONE 295 but following a peculiar form of division. The author concludes his study with a comparative table showing the division into treatises and chapters in the two manuscripts and the three earlier editions. In Rabbinic times, there were three distinct forces arrayed against the purity of the Jewish monotheistic belief: the polytheistic conception, the Gnostic idea of duality and the Christian belief in the trinity. Dr. A. Marmorstein brings together the various references in the Talmud and other Rabbinic literature, classified under these three headings, indicating the zeal with which the Rabbis endeavored to struggle against these incursions on the purity of the Jewish belief, trying by symbol, parable and direct appeal to impress the people with the grandeur and sublimity of the unadulterated monotheism, which has always been the glory and distinction of Judaism. This article forms a natural transition to the next section, devoted to philosophical studies, including two articles. Dr. Neumark con- tributes an exhaustive review of Malter's "Saadia Gaon, his Life and Works," beginning with a most glowing panegyric on the work, saying that it "threw open all avenues and doors to the remotest and most in- conspicuous sources of information," and later proceeding with a cri- tical analysis of Malter's presentation of Saadia's philosophy, pointing out a number of errors in the estimate presented in that work . Harry Austryn Wolfson discusses the proofs presented by medieval Jewish philosophers of the existence of God, comparing these with classical, Christian and modern philosophic thought. The poetic section contains a solitary brief article by Samuel Poz- nanski regarding the authorship of some liturgical poems ascribed to Moses ibn Chiquitilla, and a note on the same subject by Israel Davidson. The section devoted to historical studies also contains a single article by Dr. Alexander Marx, who, with characteristic thoroughness, discusses the life of an Italian Rabbi of the early part of the sixteenth century, throwing considerable light on the every-day duties of the medieval Rabbi. David ibn Yahya, a refugee from Portuguese persecutions, be- came the Rabbi of Naples at the persistent urgings of the leaders of that community, including the brother and son of the famous Isaac Abrava- nel. Although promised a salary, he received none for ten years. After that, the community contracted to pay him an annual salary of 100 scudi in gold, but at the time he made no claim for the back salary that was due to him. Several years passed and the community found itself unable to meet its obligations. Even after conditions improved, the leaders refused to honor his claim for the money due him for the past years.</page><page sequence="7">296 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW David then addressed an appeal to the Rabbis of his time, in which he relates all the details of the proceedings, emphasizing his onerous work in behalf of the community, especially in connection with the education of the young. It is this document, that is preserved in the Library of the Jewish Theological Seminary, which Dr. Marx presents here, with his illuminating notes and thorough-going introduction. There are nume- rous points of human as well as historic interest in this document, which are pointed out in the introduction. The volume concludes with an essay by Dr. I. Elbogen, entitled "De- struction or Construction?", dealing with the changes that have come upon Jews and Judaism during the past century and a half. Judaism in the pre-Mendelssohnian period was in a state of degradation and decay, and it was only through the activities of the German school of students that new life and a new turn was given to Jewish strivings and ideals. Even the modern national ideal would have been impossible without the works of the pioneers in the field of the "Science of Judaism." Dr. Elbogen's thesis is open to such different interpretations and so much ink has already been spilled on the discussion of this subject that it is futile to enter into an extensive analysis of his arguments on the facts that he marshalls in their support. It is encouraging to note that more than one half of the contributors to this volume are American Jewish scholars, although most of them received their early training in European seats of learning. The volume, which is most creditable to the love of scholarship that is gradually permeating the lives of American Jewry, was printed in Germany and because of that a number of printer's errors have crept in. The student will not be disturbed by these, as they are readily noted and corrected. The second volume of the Annual (1925), opens with a sad note announcing the death of one of its editors, Dr. David Neumark. The volume itself begins with an article by Julian Morgenstern, entitled "Moses with the Shining Face," with reference to Ex. 34:29-35. This is rather a textual study than a theological exposition of the phenomenon described in these verses. The author endeavors to establish the fact that these verses as well as the preceding sections in Ex., and similar sections in Num. 11 and 14, emanate from a single source, which he designates as J2 and which he places in the latter part of the seventh century. He sees in all these passages the glorification of Moses and the position assigned to him as the intercessor with God, also the appeal made to the preservation of the reputation of God among the nations of</page><page sequence="8">HEBREW UNION COLLEGE-GREENSTONE 297 the earth and the reference to the merit of the patriarchs (Kiddush ha- Shem and Zekut Abot). In passing, he also touches on the origin of these ideas as found in the Prophets, and the whole notion of human inter- cession as already indicated in the case of Abraham. This notion, how ever, that the righteous person may have more ready access to the favor of God is so human and so universal that it may be hazardous to set any particular date for its inception. Chaldea has played an important part in ancient Jewish history and a resume of its early beginnings, in 851, and its history during the period of the Assyrian and later Babylonian ascendancy, is of tremendous in- terest to the Jewish student. A. T. Olmstead presents here a brief narrative of the Chaldean dynasty until the country became merged with Persia, under the rule of Cyrus, placing special emphasis on the relationship of the Chaldean kings to both the northern and the southern kingdoms of Judea. W. J. Chapman presents in a brief article a theory regarding the dating of the reigns of certain kings, as found in the Bible, by which he endea- vors to solve some complications in the duration of the reigns of several kings of Israel and of Judah. A strong appeal is made by William Popper for the greater use to be made of the occurrence of parallelism in the Bible for the solution of the many problems created by biblical criticism. The metric test has of late been applied to the study of the Bible with satisfactory results. In the same manner, the test of parallelism might be employed, as indeed it was employed by the author himself in several of his previous studies. George Buchanan Gray and George Adam Smith recognized the value of this test, but did not make use of it to the extent that it could be used. From several striking examples which he quotes, especially from the book of Isaiah, the reader will see the great value of that study and the effect that it may have on the whole subject of biblical research. The value of the observation of parallelism for exegetical purposes is brought out plainly in several of the meanings given to Hebrew words in the following article by Joseph Reider. He takes up a number of un- certain Hebrew words in the Bible and by comparing the roots with the same roots in cognate languages arrives at some new and very interesting interpretations. The fact that the institution of the apostolate can be found among Jews already in biblical times, even as early as the time of Hezekiah, leads Herman Vogelstein to assume that Christian apostles mentioned</page><page sequence="9">298 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW in the New Testament functioned in a manner well-known to the Jewish writers of the Gospels. He began these studies with an article that appeared in the Monatsschrift about twenty years ago and in this contri- bution he still further elaborates his theory, pointing to the apostolic mission of Ezra and to the Pesach epistle of Darius II, found among the Elephantine papyri. Other expressions, especially from the Books of Chronicles, are quoted by him in corroboration of the theory that there were special messengers, who were invested with authority, to proclaim certain messages or perform certain acts in distant communities, or who were sent by the distant communities with similar powers, to the central authority. The Hebrew word shalah and shaliah assumed a technical sense, applying to these plenipotentiaries or apostles in the later books of the Bible. In his article "Judaism in the Church," Leo Baeck endeavors to present an outline history of the persistence of Jewish ideas in the Christian Church. In a graphic manner, he relates the struggle of Paul against the Jewish conception of law and the entire break with Judaism on the part of Paul's successors, especially the Gnostics. The Papacy endeavored to compromise between Paulinism and the Old Testament, but the conflict continued in the schools and manifested itself again at the rise of the Reformation. This is entirely a new point of view, of exceeding interest, although sometimes rather strained. Arabists and Hebrew philologians will find considerable interest in the contribution of Joseph Horovitz on "Jewish Proper Names and Deriva- tives in the Koran." The author first mentions all biblical proper names found in the Koran, determining as far as possible, whether they were derived from Jewish sources or from Syrian Christian sources. In the second chapter, he enumerates in alphabetical order Hebrew words which were adopted by Mohammed in their original or somewhat modified form. The subject, although technical, presents many interest- ing points and the author speaks with authority on the matter, with which he is apparently fully familiar. Not only in his Mishneh Torah, but also in his commentary to the Mishnah as well, Maimonides is primarily the decisor, the authority to decide the law when there are conflicting opinions regarding it. "He never left unsettled open controversies, and he took opportunity to settle questions of merely academic character, if according to some point of view there could be attached to it actual significance also". Dr. Michael Guttmann has collected all the decisions found in the Siraj of Maimonides and arranged them in alphabetical order, according to</page><page sequence="10">HEBREW UNION COLLEGE-GREENSTONE 299 the tannaitic authorities of the Mishnah, indicating in every instance the principles which led to the particular decisions. Dr. Jacob Mann throws additional light on the Palestinian ritual from Genizah fragments which he discovered in the Cambridge collection. He brings together twenty-one fragments, more or less complete, cover- ing practically the whole range of the liturgy, daily, Sabbaths and holi- days and even special home prayers, adding numerous notes and provid- ing each one with detailed introductions. He also permits himself frequently to make excursions in the further discussion of some moot points, presenting new light and novel suggestions, as for instance his discussion of the place of the Ten Commandments in the liturgy and the custom of concluding a blessing with Amen, about which opinions and rites differ considerably. The author is fully cognizant of the difficulty of establishing the rite in vogue in Palestine, although all these manu- scripts come from the "Palestine Synagogue" of Fustat. He admits the existence of the Babylonian rite in Egypt and even suggests the possi- bility of the blending of the two rites in one or the other synagogue or in all of them. The value of these fragments and the explanatory notes accompanying them is by no means impaired by these doubts, honestly postulated at the very beginning of the article. In a brief article on "The Origin of the Tahanun," Solomon B. Freehof endeavors to show that practically all the Tahanun prayers found in the various rituals, with the exception of that of Saadia, are based on the individual prayers of the Rabbis of the Talmud, of which thirteen have been preserved. In analysing these prayers, the author finds them all to be of a nature that would fit them for public service and related in one way or another to the blessings of the Amidah, after the recitation of which they were inserted. That many customs and ceremonies in Jewish life may have had a superstitious or even a heathen origin can hardly be doubted. However, Jewish genius and adaptability have given to these observances ethical or religious meanings and thus made them valuable assets for the pre- servation of the religious life. Dr. Jacob Z. Lauterbach presents an attractive theory regarding the development of many Jewish ceremonies, taking the ceremony of breaking a glass at weddings as an example whereby his idea is illustrated. He admits from the start that he would treat it not from the standpoint of comparative folklore, although that would have been exceedingly interesting. He simply develops the thought that the ceremony carried with it through Jewish history and the changes it underwent in the course of centuries. The only reference</page><page sequence="11">300 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW to this ceremony in the Talmud is found in connection with two incidents related in Ber. 30b, occurring at the weddings of a son of Mar the son of Rabina and of a son of Rab Ashi, both belonging to the last period of the Babylonian Amoraim. There is no mention of this custom throughout the period of the Geonim and other Rabbinic authorities up to the time of R. Eliezer b. Nathan of Mayence (RABaN), who flourished in the first half of the twelfth century. It is rather hazardous, under these conditions, to assert that this was an old established custom among Jews. It is even questionable whether the stories as related in the Talmud present an established custom or an isolated incident. Lauterbach's assumption that the original reason for this custom was to drive away or to propitiate the evil demons and the proof which he adduces for this from the preceding and following stories in the text is not at all convinc- ing. There the whole tenor of the text is that it is not proper to indulge in excessive joy in this world. Life is a serious matter and great hilarity might make us forget the earnestness of life. This thought finds ex- pression in many places in Rabbinic literature and even in some com- munal institutions. The fact that there is no other mention in early Rab- binic literature of the custom of breaking a glass at weddings is no proof that it did not exist, but it makes its existence then extremely doubtful. It is in this connection that comparative folklore would be of great service as it is quite likely that the custom was borrowed by the Jews. However, the author has made a valuable contribution in collecting all the data on the subject from medieval literature, even if his conclusions are not generally accepted. "The Law of Nature, Hugo Grotius and the Bible" is the subject of an elaborate article by Dr. Isaac Husik. Dr. Husik first explains the mean- ing of the term "law of nature" and its development through ancient Greek and later Roman philosophy and law. He then asserts that the Jews have failed to develop a philosophy of law. Just as they indulged but little in speculative theology they also abstained from theorizing about law. He could find but few references in Talmudic literature and even in later Rabbinic and philosophic writings to any subtle distinctions among different classes of laws, such as were made by the Stoics or later Christian writers. Perhaps the seven Noahide laws, which the Rabbis mentioned so often, were understood by them in the sense of natural laws, as understood by the Stoics. In the second chapter, Dr. Husik takes up for special consideration the famous work of Hugo Grotius "De Jure Belli et Pacis" and tries to point out the extensive use made by this great Dutch lawyer of the Bible and even of the Jewish commentators</page><page sequence="12">IIEBREW UNION COLLEGE-GREENSTONE 301 on the Bible. Dr. Husik quotes copiously from that work, presenting the manner of interpretation adopted by Grotius and his attitude towards biblical law and in general toward biblical writings. There is a re- freshingly broad tolerance and deep understanding permeating this great work and it is well that these excerpts be again and again presented to the public, even of modern days. Dr. David Philipson presents, as the last article in this volume, several letters adressed to Dr. Samuel Adler, Rabbi of Temple Emanuel, which throw some light on the early history of the reform movement in Germa- ny and in this country. These include a letter by Dr. I. M. Wise, two letters by Ludwig Philippson, a letter by Abraham Geiger and a lengthy letter by Dr. Kohler, before his arrival in the United States. An interest- ing letter from Moritz Lazarus to the Faculty of the Hebrew Union College, thanking them for the honorary degree of D. D. which they conferred upon him in 1895, concludes the article as well as the volume. The third volume (1926), which is dedicated to the memory of Dr. Kaufman Kohler, begins with a contribution by Michael Guttmann on the use of the term nokri in the Bible. The author is apparently un- familiar with the illuminating study on the terms nokri and ger of the late Mayer Sulzberger, in his "The Status of Labor in Ancient Israel," although he refers to his earlier book on the Law of Homicide. However, he seemed to have come to a similar conclusion regarding the meaning of nokri, as a complete stranger, who comes to the land for only a short while, although Sulzberger considers him a "hostile stranger." Our author takes considerable pains to explain the law which allows the taking of interest from the nokri, on the ground that he was usually a trader coming to the country for a short while, and desirous of maintaining his relationship with his native land. Such a stranger would undoubtedly not hesitate to take interest from an Israelite, therefore it would have been unfair to make the law of interest in relation to the stranger binding upon Israelites. He also goes into a discussion as to the relation of the nokri to the laws of homicide, quoting the various Rabbinic decisions on this point. An elaborate treatise on "Musical Instruments in OT" is contributed by Sol Baruch Finesinger. The author takes up in detail the various stringed and wind instruments found in the Bible and discusses them in the light of the various interpretations given to these terms by ancient and modern exegetes. A useful bibliography is appended to the article. Dr. Morgenstern supplements his article on the "Three Calendars of Ancient Israel," which appeared in the first volume of the Annual, by a</page><page sequence="13">302 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW number of additional notes and excursuses, which throw additional light on the main thesis and also clarify a number of related points of consider- able interest. The longest of these is the excursus on the calendar of Enoch and of Jubilees, where the author takes sides against Epstein's well-known study of this subject. In "Some Notes to the Text of the Scriptures," Dr. Joseph Reider continues his interesting suggestions with regard to the meaning of some obscure words and phrases. The Arabic language is so rich in vocabulary that it is possible to find in it support for many a novel rendering of difficult Hebrew roots and Dr. Reider often resorts to the Arabic for corroboration of a suggested reading that he offers. Almost one half of his notes deal with the book of Job and in most instances his interpreta- tion involves an emendation of the text, although often apparently plausible. From a number of haggadic passages, which he presents, Dr.V. Apto- witzer seeks to establish the fact that the Rabbis of the Talmud believed that reward and punishment are meted out to animals and even in- animate things in the same manner as they are to human beings. This is contrary to the opinion of Maimonides who, in his argument against the Mutazilist doctrine, says that "nothing was heard of this in our faith in the olden times, and the teachers of the Talmud likewise mention nothing thereof." While the collection of these references is extremely interesting and valuable, it is doubtful whether the statement of Mai- monides is refuted thereby. The Mutazilist belief was that there was retribution for animals in a future world, in the same manner as that prescribed for human beings and that this retribution is individual. In all the haggadic passages quoted by Dr. Aptowitzer there is not one that can be interpreted as pointing to such a belief. In practically all of them, the reward promised to certain animals is to redound to the species as a whole, and not in any future existence. In fact, the last four quotations given would indicate that the Rabbis believed that there is no future judgment for animals, and consequently no future retribution. On the other hand, the passages brought to show that both the heavenly bodies as well as plants and inanimate objects are also subject to the laws of retribution are so obviously poetic in nature that it is impossible to say that they indicate any set beliefs or doctrines. The various versions of the sun and moon stories are evidently poetic efforts to explain a natural phenomenon, while the figures regarding the guilt of the earth, already found in the Bible, were merely transferred from the inhabitants to the earth itself.</page><page sequence="14">HEBREW UNION COLLEGE-GREENSTONE 303 In line with his article in the first volume of the Annual, where he discussed the Jewish aspect of Early Christian Epigraphy, based on a volume of Carl M. Kaufmann, Dr. Ludwig Blau presents some interest- ing data suggested by a work on Early Christian Archaeology by the same author. Dr. Blau takes the opportunity to appeal to American Jews to establish, in connection with their seminaries and seats of learn- ing, archaeological museums, in which copies of recent discoveries may be included, and perhaps also some originals. In the discussion presented by Kaufmann on the ancient architecture, art and symbolism of Chris- tianity, Dr. Blau finds many significant references to Jewish practices, which are corroborated by Rabbinic sources which he brings as sup- plementary to the documents included in the work. He also takes up special subjects, such as the women's gallery in the synagogue, the laws with regard to plastic arts and many other topics, for special discussion and consideration. Dr. I. Elbogen throws some new light on the Kalir piyyutim for the Tal and Geshem prayers, which he corroborates by manuscript copies of Kalir's piyyutim, which he was able to discover. Dr. Israel Davidson gives the complete poem of Sahlal b. Netanel Gaon, which is referred to by S. D. Luzzatto in his letters to Rapoport. In a brief introduction, Dr. Davidson presents the history of this poem and the underlying ideas in it. He does not establish the identity of the poet nor even the approxi- mate date and place when and where he lived, beyond surmising that he belonged to the school of Yanai and Kalir. Since the publication of Dr. Jacob Mann's "The Jews in Egypt and in Palestine under the Fatimid Caliphs," mainly based on new discov- eries made through the Genizah fragments, many new fragments have been deciphered, which throw additional light on this subject. Dr. Mann collected a number of these and gives them in extenso, providing each one with illuminating notes and indicating its value in the history of the Jews during that period. New names of notables are thus unearthed and much new knowledge about personages well known and often found is brought together for the use of the future historian. A contribution of primary importance is made by Dr. Alexander Marx in the publication, for the first time, from a manuscript in the Jewish Theological Seminary Library, of the text of a letter directed to Maimon- ides by the Rabbis of Southern France. The subject of the letter is an inquiry of the great sage as to the attitude Jews should take to the sub- ject of astrology, which was so widely believed in during the middle ages both by Jews and Gentiles. Maimonides' reply, in which he denies any</page><page sequence="15">304 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW efficacy to astrological speculations, has been printed and is found in several manuscripts, but the query which elicited this important pro- nouncement is now published here for the first time. In a brief note the author pathetically refers to the fact that some of the material was collected by his friend and colleague, the late Dr. Israel Friedlander, who intended to include this correspondence in his proposed edition of several smaller treatises of Maimonides. Dr. Marx prefaces the public- ation of the texts, with a lengthy introduction, in which the general opinion of cultured Jews in medieval times regarding astrology is clearly stated. There is also an analysis of the questions propounded by the Rabbis of France, indicating their hesitancy to follow a belief, so general and so deeply rooted, without the sanction of the great authority of the sage of Egypt. Their veneration for Maimonides is manifested not only in the lengthy hyperbolic titles ascribed to him at the beginning of the letter, but also in the complete confidence in his learning and piety which is expressed throughout the document. Maimonides' reply is a categor- ical denial of the belief, regarding its adherents either as fools or im- postors, and making it antagonistic to Jewish doctrine and tradition. In reprinting Maimonides' reply, Dr. Marx had the aid of the printed edition, as well as of several manuscripts, and the variants are carefully noted by him at the bottom of the page. The author has placed all students of Maimonides as well as students of Jewish history and philo- sophy under a debt of gratitude for the careful and thorough manner with which he edited these important texts. Abraham Kahana publishes two letters written by the notorious Karaite forger, Abraham Firkovich, which cast a lurid light on the machinations and character of this literary impostor, not only in his scientific work but also in his personal and family associations. The volume concludes with some notes by Harry Austryn Wolfson, addition- al to an article on "The Classification of Sciences in Medieval Jewish Philosophy," which appeared in the Hebrew Union College Jubilee Volume. While the last two volumes are comparatively free from printers' errors, the editing of all the three volumes is exceedingly defective. There is no indication whether the articles by foreign authors were written in English or were translated from manuscript. In either case, a thorough revision of style and diction should have been made by the editors. JULIUS H. GREENSTONE Gratz College</page></plain_text>
