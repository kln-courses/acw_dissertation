<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Jewish Quarterly Review, Vol.95, No. 4 (Fall 2005) 715-720 Peter Sch?fer. Mirror of His Beauty: Feminine Images of God from the Bible to the Early Kabbalah. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 2002. Pp. xiv + 306. At the center of the Peter Sch?fer's innovative study stands the Bahir, the earliest kabbalistic tractate, which appeared in Provence at the end of the twelfth century. For the first time in the history of Judaism, the Bahir unfolds the complex notion of God as both one and possessed of a rich inner life. Although the text does not use the term sefirot for God's inner divine potencies, Sch?fer explains that all of the essential character istics of later kabbalistic systems are in place within it: "the total of ten; the clear separation between the three upper sefirot and the seven lower ones; the tension between God's love and his punishing judgment in the fourth and fifth sefirah, which is balanced out in the sixth; and finally the tenth sefirah, the Shekhinah, which is defined as an explicitly female principle" (p. 120). Sch?fer is most interested in the final of feature of the Bahir ?its emphasis on God's femininity. In Mirror of His Beauty, he ex plores the sources of the Bahir's claims for a feminine aspect of the divine, even as he questions traditional arguments about origins and influences. When the Bahir appeared at the end of the twelfth century it was attributed to a second-century Jewish mystic, a fiction intended "to guar antee its age and thus its orthodoxy " (p. 119). Sch?fer works "to place the Bahir's concept of God in historical perspective and to demonstrate that its authors were right to claim that all they did and intended to do was reaffirm the 'old,' to reestablish the 'Torah which was given to Moses on Mount Sinai" (p. 6). But as Sch?fer argues, "the problem is what they conceived as 'old.' Most likely not what we today, after centuries of critical biblical research, have come to understand" (p. 6). The Bahir, then, does not encapsulate ancient Israelite religion as it is understood by modern historical scholarship but instead revives "polytheistic counter tendencies in the monotheistic program of the Hebrew Bible, a new breaking up of an encrusted monotheism that had become all too secure of its superiority over 'pagan' polytheism and, worst, had neglected or suppressed some of the basic needs of human beings" (p. 6). Sch?fer demonstrates both the existence of a tradition of the feminine divine within ancient Jewish texts and the concealment of that tradition by the rabbis and by medieval Jewish philosophers. The continuities and breaks in the tradition of the feminine divine mean both that the Bahir</page><page sequence="2">716 JQR 95.4 (2005) must be read in the context of ancient sources, particularly the Wisdom tradition, and that these ancient sources are inadequate to explain the emergence of the feminine divine in the Bahir itself. Sch?fer thus turns to an argument for possible Christian influences on the twelfth-century re-emergence of the feminine divine within Judaism, a point which I will take up in more detail below. The first half of the book might easily stand on its own as a survey of God's femininity from the Hebrew Bible to the Bahir. Sch?fer provides detailed textual readings of the figure of Wisdom as she appears in canon ical (Job and Proverbs) and noncanonical (Jesus Sirach and the Wisdom of Solomon) Jewish texts. God's companion and even helper during cre ation, sometimes called God's daughter and God's spouse, Wisdom in these biblical and extrabiblical texts is complex, multifaceted and, with the exception of the book of Job, is always explicitly identified as female (chapter 1). Sch?fer then turns to the first century CE. Jewish philoso pher, Philo of Alexandria, arguing that Philo brings together the biblical and extracanonical Wisdom traditions with Greek philosophy. Sch?fer argues against those who claim that Philo allows the male Logos to efface feminine Wisdom. Instead, Sch?fer demonstrates that for Philo the Logos and Wisdom co-exist and at times seem to be identical. For the first time, feminine Wisdom is explicitly identified with the divine (chapter 2). Arguing for the primarily Jewish context of the Gnostic Apocryphon of John, Sch?fer goes on to explicate its complex cosmology and soteriol ogy and the place of the feminine divine within them. Unlike the more thoroughly Christian Valentinian Gnosticism described by Ireneaus of Lyons in the late second century, in the Apocryphon of John the creation of the material world is not the result of Wisdom's fall but of her infinite desire for God. Moreover, Wisdom comes into the material realm to save humanity, a role taken over by Christ in the Valentinian system. Hence, according to Sch?fer, at least certain Gnostic texts rework and expand the biblical Wisdom tradition; Wisdom is now no longer simply a com panion, wife, or daughter to God, but a co-creator and redeemer of cre ation (chapter 3). Sch?fer opens chapter 4 with the claim that within rabbinic Judaism "the threads tied by biblical and extrabiblical Wisdom traditions, by Philo, and by the 'Gnostics' were cut, forgotten, or completely trans formed" (p. 79). Wisdom appears in the Mishnah, Talmud, midrashim, and targumim, but only in the form she takes within Sirach, where she is associated with the Torah itself. God alone creates and the feminine imag ery of daughter, wife, and mother found in the Wisdom literature is now applied to Zion and Israel (as they are also elsewhere in the biblical litera</page><page sequence="3">SCH?FER, MIRROR OF HIS BEAUTY- HOLLYWOOD 717 ture). The rabbis did, however, create a term for God with a clearly femi nine gender: Shekhinah. "One of the most common designations for God in Rabbinic Judaism," according to Sch?fer, the term literally means "God's 'indwelling' or 'presence' among the people of Israel at a certain place, particularly and probably originally in the Temple" (p. 86). Tracing the concept of the Shekhinah within rabbinic literature, however, Sch?fer insists that "at no point" during its development "can an inclination be observed to take seriously the feminine gender of the term" (p. 102). "Even when referring to the biblical Wisdom," Sch?fer continues, "the Midrash is at pains to ignore any possible female aspect" (p. 102). Although the rabbis began the process of distinguishing the Shekhinah from God, Sch?fer argues that the process takes its most extreme form in early medieval Jewish philosophy (chapter 5). Sch?fer assumes the iden tity of the biblical Kavod ("Glory of God) and the Shekhinah and shows that philosophers from Saadia Gaon (882?942) to Judah ha-Levi (before 1075?1141) understand the ?ztW/Shekhinah as God's first creation, not as the manifestation of God on earth. None touch on the question of God's gender, marking the complete effacement of the biblical, Philonic, and Gnostic female Wisdom. For Sch?fer, this "remote and asexual God . . . represents the farthest that Jewish tradition could depart from the Wisdom tradition, as developed in the Hebrew Bible and later noncanoni cal ramifications." Although the philosophers believed that they were re storing a non-anthropomorphic and therefore pure monotheism, Sch?fer argues that they instead devised "concepts quite alien to the much richer biblical and early postbiblical lore" (p. 118). Given the emphasis on a male or gender-neutral deity in the rabbinic and philosophical traditions, the question then becomes why ? at roughly the same time as the philosophers are writing?the metaphorically com plex and multiply-gendered conceptions of the deity found in the Bahir emerge. After providing an account of that text in chapter 6, part 2 of Mirror of His Beauty returns to the question of origins. Chapter 7 assesses the current scholarly arguments. According to Sch?fer there is general consensus that the Bahir goes much further than the biblical and postbib lical Wisdom traditions in its depictions of the complex inner life of the deity and that there is no evidence that the authors/editors of the Bahir knew Philo, who does understand the Godhead as possessing a feminine dimension. What then of the argument put forward by Gershom Scholem for the Gnostic origins of the bahiric conception of the Shekhinah? Con ceptually, Sch?fer argues that while there are close analogies between Gnostic conceptions of the feminine divine and that found in the Bahir, the close connection between Wisdom and evil found in many Gnostic</page><page sequence="4">718 JQR 95.4 (2005) texts is absent from the Bahir. More importantly, Sch?fer is worried by the geographical (the eastern Mediterranean versus Western Europe) and temporal (second, third, and fourth centuries CE. versus around 1200) gaps between Gnostic texts and the Bahir. To make his argument for the Gnostic roots of the Bahir, Scholem is forced to the rather tenuous ?and undocumented ? argument that Gnos tic tendencies travel to the West by way of Christian heretical movements and thereby became known to the authors/editors of the Bahir. Here we come to the most original, and no doubt controversial, aspect of Sch?fer 's book. If we are to look at the context of twelfth-century France and Western Europe more broadly for possible influences on the Bahir's con ception of a feminine divine, Sch?fer asks, why look only to heretical forms of Christianity? Instead, why not look to the emerging popularity and veneration of the Virgin Mary in twelfth-century France? As he rightly argues, "there is nothing in these heretical Christian movements that resembles the role the Shekhinah plays in the bahiric system of the divine potencies and as God's messenger on earth," while the Virgin Mary does provide a close, if not exact, parallel in orthodox Christianity" (p. 147). To substantiate his claims, Sch?fer briefly surveys the centrality of the cult of the Virgin Mary in twelfth-century Western European Christianity (chapter 8). What is missing from his account is attention to the role the Wisdom traditions play within the liturgies devoted to Mary and hence the importance of these biblical traditions to the developing cult of the Virgin. Sch?fer then turns to what many may see as the greatest problem with his argument for links and mutual influences between medieval Western Christianity and Judaism: the apparent anti-Judaism of the Christian Marian tradition and Jewish polemics against the Virgin Mary (chapter 9). Although the former were unlikely to lead to Jewish admiration or emulations of Mary, attention to Jewish anti-Christian polemics reveals a more complex picture. Most tellingly, the most virulent embodiment of anti-Christian polemic, the Zerubbavel Apocalypse, an early seventh-century Palestinian apocalyptic text written against the backdrop of a Byzantine Christianity in which the Virgin Mary was highly venerated, denigrates Mary the mother of Jesus but simultaneously elevates Hefzibah, the Jewish mother of the Jewish Messiah. For the first time in Judaism, Sch?fer shows ? here following an argument first made by David Biale ?a female figure finds a place within the messianic group that brings redemption to Israel. In other words, the author of the Zerubbavel Apocalypse both rejects and subtly emulates Marian traditions. The text,</page><page sequence="5">SCH?FER, MIRROR OF HIS BEAUTY- HOLLYWOOD 719 Sch?fer writes, thereby "tells the same story twice, deliberately rejecting and accepting it simultaneously" (p. 215). Sch?fer ends by eschewing the search for pure origins, instead arguing that scholars focus on "the interplay of various factors in their particular historical dimensions" (p. 224). The shared resources of the Hebrew Bible provide Judaism and Christianity with "a common storehouse of motifs . . . and thus encourage very similar modes of thinking" (p. 224). Sch?fer wants to go further, however, arguing for the mutual influence of Judaism and Christianity throughout their histories and particularly in the twelfth century. The Jews of twelfth-century Provence did not live in ghettos or in "otherworldly conventicles" but in the midst of a predominantly Christian culture (p. 147). Sch?fer suggests that they "could not escape the explosion in Marian theology and the veneration of the Virgin, which was taking place literally before their very eyes" (p. 239). To the question of whether it is possible to prove direct contact between Jews and Christians in Provence with regard to religious matters, Sch?fer responds: it is as positivistic as it is na?ve to approach the question by looking for direct textual evidence of Christian "influence" on the Jewish doctrine of the Shekhinah ? or rather, to regard direct textual evidence as the only conceivable proof for any kind of religious exchange between Christians and Jews. The Jews certainly did not convene in their syna gogues or schools to hatch out ideas that they had heard from their Christian neighbors, which they liked so much that they set out to imitate them consciously and purposefully. This is quite a na?ve model of cultural interaction. But Jews and Christians did live in the same world, rather than in two separate worlds rigorously sealed off one from the other. Jews could not avoid seeing and hearing their Chris tian fellow-countrymen, and even if they did not report to us what they saw and heard, we can assume that they did see and hear a lot of what was happening on both sides, (pp. 238?39) But without textual, visual, or archeological evidence, how much are we justified in assuming? Is the appearance of the feminine divine itself evi dence for the mutual influence of Christian and Jewish texts in the twelfth century? This question becomes all the more pressing when we realize that al though the first indication scholars have of the Bahir is from twelfth century Provence, the text itself claims much more ancient authorship.</page><page sequence="6">720 JQR 95.4 (2005) Sch?fer acknowledges that the Bahir most likely includes traditions that significantly predate its first known appearance. He insists, however, that "the prevalent intellectual climate of the place and of the time ?in other words, a shared Zeitgeist ? makes it highly probable that the emphasis put on the feminine image of God in the Bahir was the product of the final editor of the book, or of a circle of editors who flourished in the late twelfth century" (p. 242). Although I find much of Sch?fers argument compelling, here he seems dangerously close to undermining the inter locking claims he has so carefully presented. The twelfth century saw an increased valorization, even divinization, of the feminine that influenced the editors of the Bahir. But now it seems that the only evidence for the late twelfth-century origins of the Bahir's feminine divine is the fact that a broadly based cultural valuation of the feminine takes place at that time. Other modern scholars argue that the text originated in the East in Late Antiquity; if they are right, perhaps its account of a feminine aspect of the divine is influenced by Byzantine Mariology. Short of textual, visual, or archeological evidence, it is not clear how we are to chose between these and other hypotheses. University of Chicago Amy Hollywood</page></plain_text>
