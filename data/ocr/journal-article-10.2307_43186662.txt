The two main paradigms for explaining the sociological significance of nonhumans are constructivism and actor-network theory. We propose a pragmatist synthesis inspired by George Herbert Mead, demonstrating how interactions with nonhumans help constitute the social self - that is, the identity one constructs by imaginatively looking upon oneself as others would. Drawing upon observations of humans interacting with objects, animals, and nature, we identify two complementary ways that nonhumans organize the social self and enable people to experience group membership in absentia: (I) by molding how one is perceived by others and constraining alternative presentations of self and (2) by acting as a totem that conjures up awareness of, and feelings of attachment to, a particular social group. This formulation moves beyond constructivist claims that nonhumans refect people's self-definitions, and it offers a corrective to actor-network theory's neglect of sociality. Keywords nonhumans, self, Mead, pragmatism, actor-network theory In Mind , Self, and Society , George Herbert Mead ([1934] 1967:175) memorably attacked individualistic conceptions of the self by arguing that self-consciousness arises from "the individual's ability to take the attitudes" of others: "The taking of all of those organized sets of attitudes gives him his 'me'; that is the self he is aware of' (p. 175). In other words, our sense of who we are comes from imaginatively looking upon ourselves as we believe others do: "Only in so far as he takes the attitudes of the organized social group to which he belongs . . . does he develop a complete self or possess the sort of complete self he has developed" (p. 155). The self is social because it arises through interaction, as we do not respond to oth- ers' actions directly (i.e., stimulus-response) but to our anticipation of how they would inter- pret our actions. This emergence of the self out of our expectations of others' expectations 'New York University, New York, NY, USA 2The New School for Social Research, New York, NY, USA Corresponding Author: Colin Jerolmack, Dept. of Sociology, New York University, 295 Lafayette Street, 4th Floor, New York, NY 10012, USA.

Interestingly, in a footnote of Mind, Self, and Society Mead introduced a parallel, if less celebrated, argument that humans engage in anticipatory role-taking toward objects as well: It is possible for inanimate objects, no less than for other human organisms, to form parts of the generalized and organized - the completely socialized - other for any given individual, in so far as he responds to such objects socially or in a social fashion (by means of the ... internalized conversation of gestures). ([1934] 1967:154) Mead elaborated this theory of human-object relations in other writings, arguing that as we anticipate the "resistant character" (Joas 1997:154) of objects in response to our manipulation - which is a requisite step for determining how to adjust our behavior in relation to objects - we come to recognize ourselves as objects. According to Mead ([1932] 2002: 139), "The thing, then, arouses in the [human] organism the tendency to respond as the thing responds to the organism." While the notion that humans imaginatively take the role of nonhumans in interacting with them appears in several of Mead's essays ([1932] 2002:135-51; 1938:159-73; cf. Glaeser 1998; Joas 1997:145-66), Mead neglected what we consider the more sociologi- cally significant point about human-nonhuman relations: that humans may imaginatively take the role of other humans in determining how to adjust their behavior toward nonhu- mans. If part of the way in which we respond to "objects socially or in a social fashion" (Mead [1934] 1967:154) is by invoking the attitudes of others, it follows that in the process we can become conscious of ourselves in relation to those others - even if they are not copresent. Interactions with nonhumans, then, can be an important part of the process by which the social self is internalized, enacted, and sustained. This article develops Mead's implicit thesis about nonhumans and the social self. Drawing upon a wide array of empirical observations of humans interacting with objects, animals, and nature, we construct a theoretical framework that accounts for some important ways in which the social self may be constituted through interactions with nonhumans. Such a con- ceptualization helps sociologists understand how group membership can be invoked and experienced in the absence of other people; and it reveals the ways in which relationships with nonhumans organize , not merely reflect , one's social position and relations. While we are not the first to analyze the connection between nonhumans and the self (see Bell 1994; Cerulo 2009; Fine 1997), it seems that the bulk of literature in this area fails to move beyond cultural constructivism - that is, demonstrating how people interpret and relate to nonhumans through the use of symbols that they borrow from their cultural tool kit, a process that is usually said to reproduce cultural values and social identities. For instance, Greider and Garkovich (1994:1) argue that landscapes "reflect our self-definitions that are grounded in culture." In this view, the process of interpreting and relating to nature is really "about us , rather than the natural environment" (p. 2). Similarly, scholars of human-animal relations are quick to note that it is merely a cultural convention that Americans "eat cows but not poodles" (Irvine 2004:34); and they celebrate Geertz's explanation of the Balinese cockfight as "a story the Balinese tell themselves about how their society is structured and what the structure means" (Arluke and Sanders 1996:3). This sociological narrative is rou- tinely replicated in analyses of humans' relationships to inorganic objects, which are described as "prepackaged with meanings pertaining to social values, roles, and identities" (Chambers 1983:302). Objects are thus understood as "expressive equipment" (Goffman 1959) that individuals and groups use in their presentation of self. In sum, constructivist</page><page sequence="3">66 Sociological Theory 32(1) accounts of objects, animals, and nature typically conceive of nonhuman entities as a sort of canvas upon which humans paint social identities. While constructivism helps us see how objects and other species are just as "social" as categories like race and gender, it falls short of accounting for the ways in which nonhumans are enmeshed in social life. The problem is not that constructivism is "wrong" but rather that it is "too obviously right, too readily taken for granted, to generate the friction, force, and freshness needed to push arguments further and generate new insights" (Brubaker et al. 2006:7). For our purposes, the key problem in most constructivist accounts of nonhumans is that they are only portrayed on the receiving end of interaction: People project their self- definitions onto ostensibly inert objects, landscapes, and animals (but see Irvine 2004; Sanders 2003); nonhumans are simply docile, objectified embodiments of pregiven social arrangements. This article takes a different approach, conceptualizing nonhumans as actively shaping the self and social relations. Of course, the currently predominant theoretical paradigm for looking at relations with nonhumans - actor-network theory (ANT) - does grant an active role to nonhumans. By deprivileging intentionality and potentiality, nonhumans emerge as actants : "any thing that does modify a state of affairs by making a difference" (Latour 2005:71). ANT draws atten- tion to the myriad mundane ways that nonhumans guide and constrain social life and make institutions durable over time and across space, and its "principle of symmetry" (Latour 1993) demands that the distribution of agency in any given situation must be empirically demonstrated rather than decided a priori based on ontological categories (e.g., human, non- human). An automatic door, for example, becomes an actor when a person passes through it, for she must adjust her behavior to the door's "demands" to get to the other side, and it does not appear in this moment that the person has more agency - that is, makes more of a differ- ence in the state of affairs - than the door (Latour 1988). This does not mean that objects inherently "possess" agency; rather, "the agency of nonhumans (as well as humans) is a distributed effect of relations among other heterogeneous entities" (Baiocchi, Graizbord, and Rodríguez-Muñiz 2013:327). Because nonhumans always mediate everyday life, according to ANT, the sociologist's task is to describe precisely how human-nonhuman "assemblages" act in concert to produce "social" order in situ (Law 1992). ANT's insistence on treating nonhumans as mediators, as opposed to constructivism's conventional portrayal of nonhumans as intermediaries, is key: Intermediaries are merely vehicles for the transport of pregiven meanings or forces, but mediators "transform, translate, distort, and modify the meaning or the elements they are supposed to carry" (Latour 2005:39). Nonhumans are thus never simply the "hapless bearers of symbolic projection" (Latour 2005:10); they are participants in society1 that can "authorize, allow, afford, encourage, permit, suggest, influence, block, render possible, [or] forbid" particular actions of humans and other nonhumans (72). The "network" in ANT is to be understood not as a stable struc- ture of interconnected points but rather as a description of a "string of actions where each participant [human or nonhuman] is treated as a full-blown mediator" whose role in shaping the course of "social" life is fully accounted for (128). Thus, for instance, we cannot ade- quately understand the work of scientists and fishermen attempting to "seed" scallops in a bay off the coast of France without accounting for the ways in which scallops variously "resist" or "agree" to being anchored in the bay (Callón 1986). The radical empiricism of ANT provides both a rationale and a method for including nonhumans in the study of social life. However, its emphasis on "interobjectivity" (Latour 1996) rather than intersubjectivity (e.g., Blumer 1969) results in a depiction of human- nonhuman interaction that is for the most part alien - if not hostile - to sociological</page><page sequence="4">Jerolmack and Tavory 67 conceptions of the self. While constructivism privileges interpretation and largely ignores the "agency" of nonhumans, ANT singularly focuses on the actualization of assemblages and its effects and ignores symbols and sociality (cf. Garrety 1997; Krarup and Blok 201 1; Vandenberghe 2002). As Tim Ingold (201 1) observes, ANT's focus on actualization ends up substituting action for agency.2 This is a problematic conflation even for some nonhumans and completely misses the mark if we take Mead's notion of the social self seriously. We aim to develop a pragmatist approach to studying human-nonhuman interaction that incorporates the insights of constructivism and ANT and moves beyond their limitations. The sociological warrant for doing so is straightforward: (1) because people often take the attitude of other humans when interacting with nonhumans and in doing so become aware of themselves as members of a group and (2) because nonhumans can shape our interactions with other people and their impressions of us, it follows that nonhumans are a constitutive feature of the social self - not just a reflection of it.3 Below, we sketch two distinct yet complementary ways that the social self is manifested through interactions with nonhumans, touching on relations with inorganic objects, animals, and nature. Nonhumans mold the social self by structuring how one will be perceived by others and constraining the possibilities for alternative presentations of self, and nonhumans act as totems by conjuring up awareness of, and feelings of attachment to, a particular social group. In both of these cases, it is the person's tendency to reflexively take the role of other people that makes human-nonhuman interaction sociologically significant.4 MOLDING THE SELF One of the most mundane yet crucial ways in which nonhumans play into the construction of the social self is by setting up interactions. We buy a new shirt and are slightly nervous about how (or whether) our loved one will react to us in it; we practice a musical instrument and imagine audiences impressed with our feat; we take a picture during a vacation and envi- sion the story we will tell our friends as we show them the image. The extension of action and interaction into the future means that our actions at one moment often point toward other moments and people (Tavory and Eliasoph 2013). In fact, it is only in rare moments of "flow" (Csikszentmihalyi 1975) that our actions are not oriented toward these more distant narrative futures. These considerations mean that in many situations in which we interact with nonhumans, we are, simultaneously, preparing the grounds for an interaction with other people whose perspectives we already anticipate. In many cases we actually manipulate the physical envi- ronment as a way to provoke our future selves into actions they may be reluctant to take (think, e.g., of setting an alarm or writing a reminder in a calendar). In this way, interaction with nonhumans molds our interaction with other humans: It lays the foundation, gives us materials, and shapes new relevancies in interaction so that it transforms both the situation and the self evoked in interaction. Such forms of molding, however, are not always within our control. This is for two main reasons. First, as ANT and science and technology studies remind us, objects are not docile. Nonhumans "misbehave," acting back upon us in unexpected ways. We may imagine that the picture we took during our Caribbean vacation will elicit a conversation about beaches and "the good life," only to find that the conversation uncomfortably moves to our figure and whatever happened to our dieting regimen; we may imagine audiences enthralled with our mastering of the violin only to be met with stony silence. Second, as we detail below, such moments of molding are sometimes nonvolitional. Nonhumans constantly surround us,</page><page sequence="5">68 Sociological Theory 32( I ) but we often do not have as much say about how they shape our selves and our interactions as we might like to imagine. We are sometimes surprised or annoyed when they transform situations in unexpected ways. The first way in which nonhumans may shape interaction in ways that actors do not intend is by operating as perceptual affordances (Gibson 1979) or " interactional hooks" (Goffman 1959). Iddo Tavory's (2010) study provides a case in point. He found that Orthodox Jewish men who wore yarmulkes (skullcaps) got constantly "called upon" as Jews as they walked through the neighborhood they lived in. Anonymous people in the bus station asked them on an almost daily basis, "whether it was Jews believed that . . . "; other Orthodox Jews often nodded to them; and rarely, someone would shout an anti-Semitic slur. Talking to Orthodox Jews in the neighborhood, however, Tavory was told that they often forgot that they were wearing the yarmulke. Orthodox men constantly wore it (some of them even to bed), and it became a habitual, nonreflexive aspect of their appearance. But like a visible tattoo or a wheelchair (see Davis 1961; Sanders 1990), the yarmulke then provided anony- mous others with a stable social identification for interaction and constrained the Jewish men's abilities to enact different membership identifications. In this way, members effec- tively relegated boundary maintenance to anonymous others - whether they wanted to or not. Nonhumans can mold a particular social identity not only by invoking a situationally irrelevant aspect of self but also by disrupting or discrediting our presentation of self. Clinton Sanders's (2003:413) observations of public settings reveal that people commonly treated guardians and their pets as a "couple identity" in public. As "the most 'responsible' member of the human-animal couple," people expected the person to control the dog. When the dog behaved, it reflected well on the owner. However, "when the animal bites, fails to 'mind' the caretaker, jumps on strangers, or in other ways breaches the boundaries of 'appropriate' public behavior, the caretaker's identity suffers." To remedy others' negative judgments brought on by their dog's unruly behavior, Sanders finds that human guardians routinely engaged in "repair work" such as placing blame on the immediate situation, redefining the impropriety as "cute," and overtly disciplining the dog. Use of these remedial tactics dem- onstrates that people were aware that "their social identities are linked to the identity of the human-animal couple" (2003:413; see also Haraway 2003 and Irvine 2004 who, like Sanders, argue that people and dogs coconstruct and co-inhabit social worlds). Like the yarmulke, dogs served as interactional hooks, but they often worked against the presentation of self that their guardians aspired to accomplish. In both of these examples, nonhumans mold interaction by signaling how one "ought" to be perceived by others. The way in which molding works in these instances is not a complete surprise to those involved, even if the resultant social self runs counter to people's situa- tional aims: People are often cognizant of the fact that their sense of self is tied to their pets (Irvine 2004); and even if they sometimes forgot they wore it, Orthodox men often talked about the yarmulke as something that visibly marks an ethno-religious boundary. Yet the materiality of these nonhumans provides affordances for molding selves in interaction as other people expect the bearers of these markers to enact certain identities whether or not the bearers consider such signs to be situationally relevant facets of the self.5 In certain contexts, nonhumans can also provide resources for what could be called an "interactional ambush" by imposing a social identity onto people that is completely outside of their situational expectations - but which they must nonetheless reckon with. We found this out as we were sitting at an outdoor café planning the outline of this article and a pan- handler walking along the street stopped and asked us for money. Deep in conversation, we shook our heads and carried on. However, the panhandler spotted one of the authors'</page><page sequence="6">Jerolmack and Tavory 69 wallets, which he had carelessly left on the table with a bit of a $20 bill sticking out of it. Staying put, the man said, "You got money. You are full of cash. Give me $5." This time, unable to simply deny that he had money, the author felt obligated to sternly reply, "No, I don't want to, it's mine." The panhandler lingered, staring at him, and uttered, "I don't like you" before walking away. The interaction appeared strained for the panhandler as well as the author. Using the wal- let as an interactional hook, the panhandler punctured the pretense that surrounds many panhandler-passersby interactions. People can usually shrug or deny that they have any money. But with money clearly visible, this route was blocked, and the author had to either give the man money or say what is usually kept implicit in interaction - that the fact that he has money does not mean that he is obligated to give some of it away when asked. The exposed $20 bill molded a particular social self for the (unsuspecting) author in the interac- tion, shifting the situation's set of interactional relevancies by compelling the author to inhabit the category of "moneyed people" when the panhandler came along and noticed it. The author's annoyance came not from being asked for money but from his helplessness in escaping the interactional ambush set by his wallet - which enabled the panhandler to con- struct him as someone who could give him money but selfishly refuses to do so. The way nonhumans mold particular selves in these cases may seem trivial, as it is part of the fabric of mundane interaction. Yet to understand how objects play into interaction, a simple constructivist account is insufficient. Although the meanings nonhumans are entan- gled in are socially constructed, they are not passive reflections of our social will. Dogs defy their guardians' commands and presentations of self, wallets force their owners to inhabit situated identities that they neither expect nor want, and yarmulkes are used by curious pass- ersby as a bridging device for interactions that compel Jewish men to situationally forefront a religious membership category. As people extend into the nonhuman world surrounding them, the things they extend into often resist their signifying intentions. Although nonhu- mans are implicated within a web of human signification, their materiality provides a set of affordances that cannot be easily managed. However, saying that a nonhuman sometimes resists human actors' best efforts is not to imbue it with the same sense of agency as humans have. This is to completely miss what happens in the examples above. In all three cases, an alter uses nonhumans as a hook for interaction with an ego. The difference between the action of the wallet and of the panhan- dler, as Mead saw so well, is that even though the wallet may have had an effect, it did not take the perspective of others into account when "acting." To the degree that it "acted," it did so in a blind, brute sense. What makes molding social , not merely "interobjective" (Latour 1996), is that nonhumans become resources that an alter uses to constrain and transform the presentation of self that an ego can enact. When people intentionally use nonhumans to mold another person's particular self, they anticipate the position in which their interaction with the nonhuman places the other person socially. It is this two-step anticipation that constrains and shapes interaction in novel ways. Take any of the examples above: For an Orthodox Jew to decline an invitation to discuss religion or to deny that he is Jewish when his yarmulke has already indentified him as an Orthodox Jew would be rude or even absurd. He must situationally inhabit this social cate- gory, lest he break the intersubjective fabric of sense-making (Garfinkel 1967). For a dog's guardian to fail to restrain her dog in public or at least offer excuses for its poor behavior would be to renounce any claims to the status of a responsible dog owner - and maybe even claims to the status of a responsible person. Last, the author could no longer politely deny the class differences between himself and the panhandler once the man pointed to the money sticking out of his wallet - the wallet "gave away" his social status to the panhandler, mak- ing it impossible for him to continue with the pretense that he was not a moneyed person.</page><page sequence="7">70 Sociological Theory 32( I ) Both the panhandler and the author took this new reality into account as the interaction progressed. In all three examples, an ego is put in a new interactional position by virtue of being inti- mately identified by an alter with the nonhuman. Nonhumans mold selves in these cases because both parties explicitly or implicitly realize that the nonhumans that actors are engaged with (and which they extend into) shape their potential identifications and thus adjust their presentation of self accordingly. In this way, nonhumans mold the social self that people present - or "fall into" - in interaction. EVERYDAY TOTEMISM While the notion of molding highlights the situational and often fleeting ways in which non- humans potentially transform our sense of how others perceive us, the complementary con- cept of totems highlights the deeper and more enduring ways that nonhumans anchor the social self. The notion of "everyday totemism" is thus not so much a different way in which nonhumans shape the constitution of the social self as it is a deepening of the same set of theoretical considerations. In studying Australian societies that practiced totemism, Durkheim famously argued that each totem species was sacred because it embodied an "objectified and mentally imagined" image of the clan; worshipping it was a way to express social solidarity and sanctify the col- lective (Durkheim [1915] 1995:284). Importantly, Durkheim observed that the totem "is not only a convenient method of clarifying the awareness the society has of itself: It serves to create - and is a constitutive element of- that awareness " (p. 231, italics added). Although Durkheim anticipated Mead's insight that people can become conscious of social membership through their interactions with nonhumans, he does not seem to have considered the possibility that totems could "act back" and actually structure patterns of social belonging. This was one of the great insights of Lévi-Strauss (1963). His well-known critique of Durkheim was that totemic animals are not merely incidental symbols of the group but rather are "good to think with." Totemic logic not only reflected preexisting social relations but rather was an epistemology that used empirical observations of "the diversity of species" as "conceptual support for social differentiation" (p. 101). Animals and plants were not utilized "merely because they are there" (cf. Durkheim) but "because they sug- gested a mode of thought" in which observable biological differences between "species x and y" became useful for drawing social distinctions between "clan a and clan b" (p. 13). Although our invocation of totemism is in part figurative, as we are not referring to the cult worship of plants and animals, we use the phrase "everyday totemism" to highlight two key ways in which the social form that we describe below is consistent with Durkheimian and Straussian depictions of totemism: (1) myriad mundane - and putatively secular - inter- actions with nonhumans can excite deep feelings of social belonging (à la Durkheim), and (2) nonhumans can "act back" and pattern communal sentiments (à la Lévi-Strauss). They do so, we argue, in ways that are similar to the molding examples we have described above but that are usually far more consequential for actors' definition of self - serving as a sort of anchor - and that are part of a more-or-less committed project of self-constitution in which actors are engaged. Although Michael Bell did not frame it quite this way, his book Childerley (1994) nicely illustrates both facets of everyday totemism. Childerley examines how rural villagers viewed nature as an escape from the ills of society. Disgusted by "the selfishness, greed, power, and domination they see in social life," locals anchored their sense of self in nature, which they viewed as a "moral preserve" that is free from social interests (p. 138). In doing so, Bell argues that they rejected the collective conscience as a source of morality and constructed in</page><page sequence="8">Jerolmack and Tavory 7 1 its place the "natural conscience." What is most interesting to us, however, is how this sanc- tifying of nature appears to have invoked and even strengthened group membership. Bell points out that salient class tensions constantly threatened to undermine social solidarity in the village: Many of the long-term residents, who were working class, distrusted the wealth- ier newcomers, and they often found little to agree on when it came to politics and moral values. Yet everyone passionately identified as "country people." While Bell finds that vil- lagers related to nature differently depending on their class position, by grounding their sense of selves in nature villagers felt that they transcended (at least provisionally) the social categories that divided them. Rich and poor residents, for instance, would commiserate over the encroachment of suburban sprawl and the protestors who arrived from the city to disrupt foxhunts. In this way, nature became a totem that all locals could rally around equally; their shared identification as "country people" mitigated class antagonisms and generated com- munal sentiment. Significantly, Childerley goes beyond a demonstration that nature is socially con- structed - that is, that it reflects people's self-definitions and culture (Greider and Garkovich 1994). Nature was more than a symbol of community; it provided the foundation upon which a loosely knit array of people could forge community by becoming aware of what they shared in common. Whether or not the newcomers and the original villagers saw nature in the same way, when either the suburbs or cosmopolitan protestors encroached upon "their" nature, it united them. It is not simply that nature was an ambiguous "boundary object" (Star and Griesemer 1989) that they could rally around despite their differences but that, in its physicality, "nature" could be threatened in ways that organized these coalitions and defini- tions of self. A second case, which further clarifies the ways in which nonhumans invoke deep feelings of social belonging and act back on communal ties, is Colin Jerolmack' s (2009) ethno- graphic study of men who breed domestic pigeons in New York City. Jerolmack (2009:437) argues that this group of working-class "pigeon flyers" constructed a distinct social world around their birds. Echoing Durkheim, he shows how each flyer's interactions with his pigeons aroused an awareness of himself as part of the collective in absentia by summoning both retrospective and prospective social ties. Group customs dictated breeding, such that each man internalized the attitudes of the group and aimed to create pigeons that aligned with the standards of his peers. Moreover, the men campaigned for status at "the pet shop" based on their birds' appearance and performance in flight. Thus, even when the men inter- acted with their pigeons alone on their roofs, their animal practices were social in the Meadian sense because they were guided by the men's perceptions of how others would judge their birds and, by extension, them. Moreover, the personal feeling of satisfaction that each man obtained when his birds "fly nice" or "look good" - something that he could not completely control since it depended on the birds' actions - came from invoking member- ship in a group of "pigeon flyers" who valued these aesthetics and imbued respect on those who achieved them (Jerolmack 2013:107). Invoking Lévi-Strauss, Jerolmack demonstrates that the animals were not simply emblems of pregiven social arrangements (e.g., Fine and Christoforides 1991; Geertz 1973); rather, they shaped patterns of belonging. Pigeons that did not meet standards of the breed were coded as "garbage," and men who allegedly possessed "garbage birds" were ostracized by others as "garbage flyers." Thus, while flyers worked hard to present themselves as "decent flyers," their birds commonly undermined their posturing, thereby lowering the men's status in the group. Moreover, Jerolmack describes how the practical demands of pigeon keeping compelled pigeon flyers - who in New York were historically ethnic whites - to form new cross-racial social ties. The copious amount of feces produced by hundreds of pigeons, and</page><page sequence="9">72 Sociological Theory 32(1) the fact that the birds need to be let out several times per day to learn how to fly as a group, meant that most flyers enlisted others - usually their sons - to help them clean their coops and train the birds. Because these practical demands persisted even after the sons and neigh- bors of ethnic white flyers left the city for the suburbs, Jerolmack discovered that the remain- ing white flyers recruited some of the Latino and black boys who moved into their neighborhoods to help them on their rooftops. The actions of pigeons, then, propelled relatively ethnocentric men whose social spheres did not otherwise overlap with blacks' or Latinos' in their neighborhood to forge a racially diverse group. As Jerolmack (2009:452) writes, "a shared commitment to, and investment in, pigeon keeping unites these men on neutral turf. . . . The more a man invests his time and esteem in pigeons, the more those who count the most are others who keep pigeons, regard- less of age or racial-ethnic identity." Jerolmack (20 13:1 45-46) goes on to note that, ironi- cally, the "race" (i.e., breed) of pigeon that one kept became of greater concern - and of greater consequence for his status in the group - than his own race. While traditional constructivist accounts recognize that nonhumans can reflect, or pro- vide "expressive equipment" (Goffman 1959) for, collective identities, the above examples illustrate a more dynamic and dialectical relationship between humans and nonhumans in which the latter galvanize social sentiment and structure group affiliation in surprising ways. However, as in our examples of molding, everyday totemism cannot be grasped by simply conceiving of nonhumans as "actants" that affect human behavior (Latour 2005). Sociality is crucial. People interact with nonhumans "in a social fashion" (Mead [1934] 1967: 154) by invoking the attitudes of the group, as the pigeon flyers did when deciding on how to breed and train their birds; consequently, such interactions can arouse feelings of social belonging. Moreover, people's relationships with nonhumans can provide the foundation upon which they organize communal ties, as Childerleyans did when their love of nature led them to mute class tensions and relate to each other as "country people"; consequently, nonhumans can anchor the social self. In these ways, in everyday totemism we can conceive of humans as interacting - even bonding - with a community in absentia when all that we can see is a human interacting with a nonhuman. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS To see the intellectual "cash value" (James 1907) of the Meadian perspective we have advanced, it is useful to show how our theoretical frame challenges the empirical and ana- lytic focus of actual work in the ANT and constructivist traditions. To do so, we look at two paradigmatic texts - Michel Callon's (1986) ANT study, "Some Elements of a Sociology of Translation," and Geertz's (1973) celebrated telling of the Balinese cockfight. In both cases, we show how thinking through a pragmatist theory of self corrects some problematic assumptions of their work and highlights aspects of their findings that transcend their own theoretical positions. Michel Callon's (1986) essay is one of the most highly cited, and oft-taught, works of actor-network-theory.6 The study follows the network of scientists, fishermen, and scallops that together are enmeshed in the process of attempting to "seed" scallops in the French bay of St. Brieuc. As Callón masterfully shows, focusing only on the work of the scientists and the fishermen misses some of the crucial aspects of the story as it unfolds. While fishermen, the scientists trying to seed and anchor the scallops, and the scientific community in which they are working are all important actants, the scallops themselves are no less actants. When the scallops "agree" to anchor themselves in the bay, the social assemblage is strengthened; when they "rebel" and fail to do so the following year, the whole project falls apart. Through</page><page sequence="10">Jerolmack and Tavory 73 this case, Callón makes a few points, out of which we focus on the following: (1) that non- humans shape networks of humans and nonhumans no less than do human actors in the network and (2) that to shape a network, each of the actants can be metaphorically seen as being involved in an attempt to "enlist" other actors by making themselves into "obligatory passage points" for others actants' projects. Although the study is groundbreaking for its illustration of the crucial importance of non- human action, and while the notion of "obligatory passage point" is a useful concept for understanding how actants shape social configurations, a number of difficulties emerge. To begin with, Callón often analytically slips in the article. To sustain the principle of symmetry between humans and nonhumans, only actual action should be taken into account - that is, actualization. Yet to tell the narrative, Callón (1986) needs, time and again, to say that actors act in order to achieve some goal. He thus finds himself talking about the scallops' "goals" (p. 207) and about scallops "willing" to anchor themselves (p. 211). But even if we chalked up this anthropomorphism to metaphor, two other problems emerge. The most troubling is why Callón finds himself telling the story of the St. Brieuc scallops through the eyes of the scientists - it is they who are trying to position themselves as obligatory passage points and they who enroll other actants into their network (see graphs on pp. 207, 217). From an actor- network perspective, this is ostensibly a pragmatic decision - the story could have been told through the eyes of the fisherman, the scientific community, or even the scallops; in this particular case it simply made more sense to focus on the scientists. But it is precisely in this move, we argue, that ANT glosses over the differences between action and agency. The three scientists who are at the core of Callon's narrative exercise agency - they imagine what the scientific community would think, what the fishermen may want, and how scallops "should" act - and it is through imagining these other perspectives that they decide how to act.7 Thus, it is by inhabiting their social self that the scientists can enroll others. The scallops do act back. But what this acting back consists of is in the chang- ing of the situational landscape in which human agents can take each other's perspectives, and the kinds of perspectives that they can assume. Thus, although Callón attempts to avoid precisely such asymmetry, it is only by differentiating the kinds of action taken by scallops from the kind of agency exercised by the scientists that his narrative ultimately becomes persuasive. Now let us turn to a classic constructivist take on human-nonhuman interaction: Clifford Geertz's (1973) famous essay on the Balinese cockfight. Geertz memorably called the cock- fight a "story" the Balinese "tell themselves about themselves" (p. 448), meaning that the structures and narratives governing matches provided a "metasocial commentary upon the whole matter of assorting human beings into fixed hierarchical ranks" (p. 448). For instance, rules prohibited matches among villagers from different social strata, thus ensuring that a lowly peasant would never have the chance to rub elbows with, or defeat, a chief. The same men who "dominate and define the society," Geertz noted, "dominate and define the sport" (p. 435). In addition, norms dictated that side bets reflect social allegiances, such as the cus- tom of never betting against the cock of one's kinsman. The cockfight, then, was a playful "simulation of the social matrix" (p. 436); it "spelled out externally in a collective text" the enduring social order that existed in Balinese society at that time (p. 448). "Deep Play" makes an important contribution both to the study of culture as the creative enactment of meaning and to showing how relations with nonhumans can be analyzed as meaningful social rituals. Yet Geertz's (1973) portrayal of the cockfight as a "story they tell themselves about themselves" precludes the possibility that interactions with animals can shape society's stories. Parts of his own narrative seem to contradict this constructivist reduction of nonhumans to passive objects onto which people project pregiven social arrangements.</page><page sequence="11">74 Sociological Theory 32( I ) For instance, we catch glimpses of cocks "acting back" by refusing to fight at all or by continually running away. And we see men drawn to the birds as birds (not just status sym- bols), spending "an enormous amount of time with their favorites, grooming them, feeding them ... or just gazing at them with a mixture of rapt admiration and dreamy self-absorp- tion" (Geertz 1973:418-19). For such "cock crazy" men, their birds structured the rhythms of their days. They "spend most of their life" with their roosters and organized their primary groups accordingly. Geertz described cliques of men "squatting idly in the council shed" with a rooster in their hands for hours, holding the birds between their thighs, bouncing them gently, and ruffling their feathers "with abstract sensuality" (p. 419). Although Geertz does not develop this theme, it seems that the birds - as in Jerolmack's (2013) analysis - pat- terned the men's social relations and formed the basis for a particular kind of group member- ship. The actual needs of the cocks (e.g., to be fed and groomed) seemed to have structured the social scene in ways that Geertz glossed over in his writing. To productively incorporate nonhumans, sociologists need to go beyond boilerplate con- structivism and ANT. Starting from Mead's social psychology allows us to appreciate how people become social selves in the act of taking the perspectives of others in interaction. This, as actor-network theorists seem to forget, means that agency can never be equally dis- tributed between humans and nonhuman actors. Rather, there is a spectrum of agency, with doors and yarmulkes occupying one end, humans the other, and cocks, pigeons, and dogs somewhere in the middle. Human agency depends on the social self and is thus enmeshed in actors' anticipations of others and their imaginary perspective taking. Nonhumans, at least those on the inert part of the spectrum, act in ways that are incapable of such perspective taking. The resulting differ- ence is consequential, and thus actor-network theorists' attempt at a radical symmetry between humans and nonhumans ultimately falls short. Then again, much of the allure of ANT comes from its ability to account for a point that constructivists (and sociologists in general) usually sideline - that nonhumans are not simply passive recipients of human meaning. Nonhumans act in surprising ways and organize, rather than merely reflect, social worlds and selves. They do so by molding how one will be perceived by others and by con- straining the possibilities for alternative presentations of self, as well as by acting as totems that conjure up awareness of, and feelings of deep attachment to, a particular social group. Whether they are specifically interested in nonhumans or not, we argue that sociologists would do well to take these considerations into account. They should do so because nonhu- mans are a constitutive feature of the social self, meaning that our interactions with nonhu- mans serve as an important medium through which social action is organized. How classed interactions emerge, how religious selves are invoked, and how subcultural affiliations are cemented often depend on such interactional moments. Last, this perspective provides an additional theoretical payoff for thinking about nonhu- mans. When Mead lectured about taking the attitude of the other, he thought in rather abstract terms. Although the other is often specific (as in play), Mead emphasized the "generalized other," an imagined collective conscience that we internalize and anticipate. But what our examples point out is that, in many interactional contexts, we take the place of a concrete other, an other who is entangled in, and extends into, a web of nonhumans that shape his possible routes of action. In a very real sense, the self we anticipate shifts in relation to these nonhumans that we are entangled within. We expect a different thing from a visibly "wal- leted" person than from someone whose wallet we cannot see and something different from a person with a yarmulke than from someone not wearing one. The way nonhumans affect interaction, then, is through shifting the anticipations people have of each other, often in ways that are surprising and beyond their control.</page><page sequence="12">Jerolmack and Tavory 75 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS For comments on prior drafts, the authors thank the anonymous reviewers at Sociological Theory , Max Besbris, Nahoko Kameo, Harvey Molotch, Olimpia Mosteanu, and panelists and audience members who participated in the 2012 Belonging Today workshop (organized by Kaisa Ketokivi and sponsored by New York University's Institute for Public Knowledge) and in the 2013 American Sociological Association panel Theorizing Materiality. NOTES 1 . Actor-network theory (ANT) banishes the notion of "society" altogether and replaces it with "collec- tive," arguing that what we think of as "social" relations are in fact particular configurations, or collec- tions, of humans and nonhumans. It is for this reason that we bracket "social" in our description of ANT. 2. Scholars in science and technology studies (STS) have developed myriad critiques of ANT's concep- tualization of agency and networks (see, e.g., Barad 1998; Cetina and Bruegger 2002). While such studies have made significant strides in theorizing materiality, for the most part they have not focused on the role of nonhumans in constituting the social self. Therefore, for the purposes of our article, STS is categorized as a derivative of ANT. 3. In this way, a pragmatist perspective ties in to recent discussions in the philosophy of mind regarding "extended cognition," the expansion of the concept of mind to incorporate its nonhuman environment (see, e.g., Clark and Chalmers 1998; Dennett 1996). However - and herein lies the crucial sociological difference - this extension of the self cannot simply incorporate the nonhuman into "the human mind," precisely because, as we show, nonhumans invoke and even create particular social selves. 4. While we recognize that there can be significant differences in the kinds of interactions - and selves - that emerge from human encounters with objects versus other sentient beings, we aim to develop a broad framework for understanding both and leave it to future empirical research to specify the distinctions. 5. Analyzing materiality also underlines the fuzzy boundary between the material aspect of human exis- tence and nonhumans. The difference between a yarmulke and skin color or gender is not as obvious as it may seem; the dog, as a marker of a couple-identity, is perhaps a step removed, but not as far as we may think at first. Indeed, as Berger and Luckmann (1966) put it, human action is always externalized and objectivated. Even words take on a life of their own (see also Ricoeur 1973). 6. To give some indication, the article has been cited (according to Google Scholar, accessed November 1 1, 2013) 4,847 times since its publication - a feat all the more impressive for its being a chapter in an edited volume. 7. That an actor can also take the perspective of a nonhuman is crucial here. For a pragmatist account of such perspective taking, which may sometimes (but not always) be anthropomorphic, see Cohen's (1989) masterful essay "About Steaks Liking to Be Eaten" (see also Cerulo 2009:536).
