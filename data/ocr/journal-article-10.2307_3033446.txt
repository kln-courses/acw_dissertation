<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE MONKEY MEMORIAL SERVICE OF JAPANESE PRIMATOLOGISTS Pamela J. Asquith is with the Laboratory of Human Evolution, Kyoto University. In a small shady grove between two large enclosures containing chimpanzees and Japanese macaques stood a wooden table and chair facing a large rock on which is written in Japanese: 'Monkey memorial stone (saruzuka) erected by the Primate Institute's volunteers in April, 1973'. On the table which served as an altar were four neatly stacked offerings of bananas, apples, sweet potatoes and a box of sweet red bean-filled cake, a burning candle and flowers. Beside the table were two or three graves of monkeys. A priest from a local Buddhist temple sat in the chair facing the table and memorial stone. It was 3 p.m. on 15 October, 1982 at Kyoto University's Primate Research Institute in Inuyama, Japan. The annual sarukuyo or monkey memorial service was about to begin. In attendance were the head of the institute, administrative office staff, veterinarians and scientists and secretaries from the various departments. To begin the service, the head of the Institute's office staff said to the priest, 'Shall we begin the ceremony of sarukuyo?'. The director then made a short speech saying that because many monkeys had died from disease and experimental use, let us pray for them. A veterinarian next told how many monkeys had died that year: in experiments, 49; from disease, 50; from accidents, such as bites, 8, and from management mistakes, 7, giving a total of 114 animals. He said we must try to reduce the number of deaths from disease which about equalled those (unavoidable ones) from experiments. The priest then read two sutra chants sitting in the chair facing the memorial stone, after which everyone went one by one to the altar to say a brief prayer. To my surprise and delight, the first to do this was a chimpanzee, which, accompanied by its keeper, laid a bouquet of flowers by the memorial stone. Oshoko refers to burning incense for the dead. Two dishes, one each of unburned incense and of burning incense, are set side by side on the table and before praying, one picks up a small amount of unburned incense, brings it to the forehead and places it in the dish of burning incense. This can be done once, twice or three times (three times is most formal). Each person did oshoko and said a prayer for the monkeys: 'Yasuraka ni nemutte kudasai' (Please sleep peacefully). After everyone had paid their respects the food from the altar was fed to the monkeys in the enclosures. Just beyond the sarukuyo area a long table had been set up and in the equivalent of a wake that followed, everyone helped themselves to sake (Japanese rice wine) and small snacks and stood around or sat on the grass. A party-like atmosphere prevailed and it went on for at least 1 l/2 hours or until the drink was finished. I was told that people were happy as they believe that the souls (tamashii) of the monkeys have gone to a happy place. So ended an annual ceremony that appears to reflect rather conspicuously an attitude to primates for which there is no real equivalent among Western 4 researchers. The independent development of primate behaviour studies in Japan and the West has given rise to some comment on culturally based differences evident in and as an explanation for the methodology and focus of the respective studies (Umesao, 1960; Frisch, 1963; Watanabe, 1974; Reynolds, 1976; Asquith, 1981). The author is at present researching this in depth in Japan. Because of the often made, but fairly ill-defined (because difficult to define) observation that the Japanese have a'special' or 'closer' relationship to animals than do Westerners, I was interested to attend the memorial service for monkeys that have died in the course of researches made on them. Primatology is a relatively new science in Japan, as it is in the West. Begun by Imanishi Kinji and the group that grew around him in 1948, the first journal of Japanese primatology, Primates, (pronounced by the Japanese as the Latin prema't"es as it refers to the taxonomic Order) was published in 1957. Thus any special service connected with non-human primates was likely also to be of recent origin. However, the feeling there was a need for such a service may have been based on beliefs more deeply rooted in Japanese culture. Such was my question as I enquired further about the sarukuyo. A similar ceremony is held by Osaka University's primatologists each spring. Further, some large medical and physiology departments hold a memorial service for other animals such as mice sacrificed in experiments. On asking various people what the service for monkeys means to them or why they attend, I received the following answers. One said he felt you should attend as it reminds you of the importance of animals too. He does not really believe that animals' souls go to heaven or return in other bodies afterwards, but the service is important as a reminder not to needlessly kill animals. In answer to the question, 'Do Japanese believe the souls of monkeys go somewhere, or exist at all?', one primatologist said he believed in the existence of souls of monkeys he had come to know, but not of monkeys he did not work with. Another in attendance said he felt he should go to the ceremony although he was a Shintoist, not a Buddhist, because everyone else goes and because all life is important. He also felt that making prayers for animals was a bit of a business proposition so far as the temple was concerned (there is a fee for the prayers). Another researcher dislikes experiments done on animals and goes to say 'excuse me' to the monkeys. Another, not a scientist, was surprised to hear how many monkeys had died and felt one should pray for their souls. For some people this person felt the service was a way to say excuse me' and also 'thank you'. In these comments there is a basic affirmation of the importance of an animal's life, that it is not to be taken for granted. How extensive is this attitude and on what may it be based? The Buddhist priest who is hired to perform the sarukuyo at Osaka University is monk master at Toneyamagobo in Toyonaka-shi near Osaka. There are two temples on the grounds, one for animals (Shoanji) and one for people (Joankuji). The animals' temple is undecorated while that for people is very ornate inside with gold paint and hand-painted screens, etcetera. The practice of performing a ceremony for animals was begun here only twenty-five years ago. I was told that scientists, veterinarians and other professionals who had to kill animals in their work first asked the monk master to perform a ceremony. Now, people bring their pets or favourite animals to be buried here, or rather some of their hair only is buried and the corpses are burned elsewhere in the interests of hygiene and space. Each grave is topped with a stick with the name of the animal (pet name), date of fdeath and number. Since 1956 over 18,800 animals' souls have been prayed for there. Every year 700-800 animals are buried. The day I was there (May 22, 1982), the hair of number 18,845 was buried, a young Alsatian dog. There is in addition an annual ceremony held at the end of May to which 300-400 people come to pray for the souls of their animals. A place filling this function is quite rare in Japan and even newsworthy. At the animal temple there were two thick scrapbooks of newspaper clippings and photographs of the history of these animal ceremonies, and the monk master pointed out the important people who had attended, such as the mayor of the city. It has its business side too and a price list of 3</page><page sequence="2">burial costs is displayed. Costs vary according to the size of the animal from 1500 (?3.60) yen to 5000 yen: 1500 yen for a bird, small cat, etc., and up according to small, medium, large-size dogs or other animals such as a goat. The animal ceremony has two names, ireisai or prayer ritual for dead animals and kanshasai, or thanking for animals. Ireisai breaks down into the following meaning; i - comfort, console; rei - soul; sai - festival. Kanshasai breaks down into: kansha - thanks; sai festival. It is interesting that the idea of consoling ('excuse me') and thanking the (souls of) monkeys was very much present in the remarks of those attending the sarukuyo at the Primate Research Institute. The value of the animals' soul is evident too in Buddhist thought in that the Buddhist prayer book, okyo, uses the same prayers for both humans and animals. What significance if any can be attached to the fact that such a ceremony occurs in modern research? Some care must be taken not to make too fine a point of a rather striking practice. Many primatologists in Japan have never attended a sarukuyo. Those who attended said that most Japanese now do not know the meaning of the chants or prayers said for the monkeys, nor the significance of the formality distinctions of doing oshoko (burning incense for the dead) three times instead of two or one, nor the prayer said at the time of doing oshoko, and so on. People are not au fait with the meaning of the details of the rituals, but this by no means implies that no importance is attached to doing the rituals. Nor do the recent origins of the ceremony (1956 for the general Toyonaka-shi ceremony requested by scientists and 1973 for the Primate Research Institute's) lessen its cultural significance. On the contrary, it points to the strength and persistence of certain beliefs that may be said to need assuaging in the face of modern science. Something of a parallel to this has already occurred in a different context in Japan, as I shall explain. The monkey memorial service is Buddhist. Buddhism entered Japan in the middle of the 6th century and was promoted on an extensive scale by Prince Shotoku Taishi (574-621) at the end of the 6th century. Direct results of Buddhist teaching were a reluctance to kill animals and general use of a diet restricted to fish and vegetables. However, by the 1930's eating meat had become quite common, and butcher's guilds apparently had masses said regularly for the souls of slaughtered cattle (Eliot, 1935, p. 191). Here again the abuse of a belief needed to be compensated for. Thus, paradoxically, the very novelty of the monkey memorial service reaffirms the existence among modern primatologists of anciently held feelings of awareness of and importance attached tc ;;ie life of each animal. There is no direct equivalent to this in Western practices. Such clues lend some justification to enquiries into the effects of different cultural beliefs on the performance of science. Pamela J.
