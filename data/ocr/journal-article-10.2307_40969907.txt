<plain_text><page sequence="1">PHILOSOPHY AND IDEOLOGY: REFLECTIONS ON HEIDEGGER1 BY STANLEY ROSEN I Jljach age has its own crisis, and however tedious the thought may be, ours is no exception. It is suggestive of the nature of our crisis that it was given its most pertinent name by a poet, who in turn was influenced by the founder of psychoanalysis. We live, as is now notorious, in the age of anxiety. Some of us disappear into the abyss, some find their salvation by peering resolutely into its depths, others betray their anxiety in a refusal to acknowledge the presence of the abyss. One way or another, we are all implicated in the disturbing and various strands of a crisis engendered by the decay of reason. My own formulation of this crisis, by no means original with me, is that it has been caused by a long decay in our understanding of the meaning of "reason." Anxiety may well be an enduring feature of the human condition, but how we respond to it is determined by our con- ception of "being reasonable." The peculiar nature of the con- temporary crisis is for me best indicated by a disconcerting fact: once we penetrate certain problems of rhetoric and history, it can be shown that the most fashionable champions of "reason" in our time accept some of the crucial contentions put forward concern- ing its nature by the opponents of the rational tradition. For the sake of brevity, I will limit myself to mentioning two main characteristics of the meaning attributed to "reason" by its friends and enemies alike. The first is the belief that reason is identical with, or modeled after the paradigm of, mathematics. i This paper was delivered as a lecture at Haverford College, under the auspices of the department of philosophy, on April 14, 1967, and again at Trinity College, Hartford, April 10, 1968, and at Williams College, April 11, 1968.</page><page sequence="2">REFLECTIONS ON HEIDEGGER 261 To "be reasonable" is thus something like to count, to measure, or to intuit numerical and geometrical forms. Or it is to perceive the presence or absence of deductive structures, to carry out "logical inferences." The second characteristic belief about "reason" today is that it is identical with, or a creature of, his- torical consciousness. This may be understood to mean either that the "rational capacity" is a subjective production or project of the historical individual, or a more general determination of the total historical process. These two characteristics, the "mathe- matical" and the "historical," are by no means mutually exclusive. One obvious example of a contemporary philosophical movement which incorporates both characteristics in its conception of "being reasonable" is ordinary language analysis. In this instance, the hard center of the mathematico-scientific model of rational speech is blurred by the soft exterior of linguistic use or history. Another example is the "anti-platonic" branch of contemporary meta- mathematics, for which logical calculi may be regarded as creative projects of the historical human consciousness. Of the many consequences which follow from the contemporary dominance of the "mathematical" and "historical" conceptions of reason, I am here particularly concerned with one. At the risk of some oversimplification, I shall call it a practical consequence. I refer to the widespread opinion that reason is incompetent to guide us in choosing the ends or values by which we live, and more specifically in terms of which we find coherence, integrity, or wholeness in our lives, whether in a private or public sense. To indulge once more in simplification, this opinion takes three main forms. The first states that reason is restricted to drawing inferences, clarifying meanings, and establishing the truth or falsehood of facts. The second states that although reason is involved in the choice of ends or values, the entire process is a function of the historical situation; and in the non-Marxist world at least, this is normally taken to mean that no reason can be given for the workings or process of history. The third states that reason, even in the tasks assigned to it under the first form of the</page><page sequence="3">262 SOCIAL RESEARCH general opinion, is a slave, employee, tool, or derivative of more fundamental modes of apprehension, such as the passions, moods, biological or psychological inclinations, and the like. Again, these three forms of the general opinion may combine with one another to produce a wide range of philosophical positions. I shall make no attempt to list them, but pass instead directly to a general observation. Wherever philosophy renounces the authority of reason to choose ends or values in a way not vitiated by passion or history, by the urgency of the flesh or the transience of taste, a vacuum is created in our lives that must necessarily be filled by unreasonable, and indeed by insane or absurd, ideologies. In sum, if it is true that ours is an age of nihilism, the cause lies in the fact that what we regard as progress in our under- standing of "how to be reasonable' ' is actually retrogression or decay. Needless to say, I am not suggesting that reason has nothing to do with counting and inferring, or that it is entirely independent of history. The problem is to do justice to the richness and complexity of man's rational nature, to avoid a denatured conception of reason. The present article is not in- tended to solve this problem, but to illustrate how it is that we have become so susceptible today to a denatured interpretation of our rational faculty. The following discussion takes the form of a reflection on the ideology of existentialism and the thought of Martin Heidegger. And my first purpose is to suggest in somewhat more elaborate form why the view of reason held by its most fashionable spokesmen, and by those who abominate ex- istentialism and Heidegger, or think that they oppose this latest form of "continental nonsense," is in fact closely related to the view of Heidegger himself. To this I now turn. II Let us begin with the famous contemporary distinction between "facts" and "values," or in David Hume's terms, between "is" and "ought." In the formulation as derived from Hume, it is assumed that "facts" are not "values," as Nietzsche more con-</page><page sequence="4">REFLECTIONS ON HEIDEGGER 263 sistently taught. We see here a modern revision of the classical distinction between theory and practice. One finds very clearly in Aristotle, and more ambiguously in Plato, recognition of the difference between an attempt to see mentally "how things are" (theory), and an attempt to ascertain the relative degrees of ex- cellence of the various modes of human conduct (practice). For both thinkers, however, these two kinds of mental activity are related precisely by what one could call "the logical structure of the world." Of course, "logical" means something quite different here from the meaning attached to the term by its contemporary admirers. "Logic" is derived from the Greek word logos, which means both "speech" and "reason." To the Socratic philosophers, the world is "logical" or "reasonable" because it provides us with a basis for speaking meaningfully about the relative merits of the various human activities. There is thus a reasonable basis in the world for distinguishing and responding to the unreason- able. The Aristotelian tradition, still alive in our ordinary lan- guage, refers to reasonable speech in this sense as the consequence of prudence or practical intelligence. The classical conception of reason is inseparable from the no- tion of "good." This notion in turn contains two dimensions which we may call "noble" or "beautiful," and "useful." Modern philosophy generally, and empiricism in particular, tends to begin with a radical separation of these terms (although sooner or later the beautiful is redefined as the useful). The useful is separated from the noble or beautiful for two reasons which seem them- selves to be opposed to each other: the influence of Christianity on the one hand, and of mathematics on the other. For the Christian, the good refers finally to God, and therefore to an other-worldly or trans-rational dimension, whereas the useful re- fers primarily to this-worldly calculation of essentially selfish interest.2 In other words, "utility" has primary reference to 2 This distinction is perhaps most clearly stated in the Kantian ethic, for the very reason that Kant attempts to give a "reasonable" formulation to the Christian teaching, without transforming it into a species of rationalism. Kant's identifica-</page><page sequence="5">264 SOCIAL RESEARCH man's fallen condition, and is therefore implicitly associated with sin rather than with goodness. For the seventeenth-century, mathematically-oriented philosopher (with the outstanding excep- tion of Leibniz), however noble or beautiful he may regard math- ematics to be, reason is the activity of discerning geometrical and logical form, or the intelligible structure of "this" world. The useful is then the rational extension of man's power, thanks to an understanding of the mathematical order which underlies experi- ence.3 By the extension of his own power, man makes himself (in the famous phrase of Descartes) "master and possessor of nature/1 and thereby inevitably reduces the mastery and power of God. In a very deep sense, modern philosophy accepts the Christian associa- tion of utility and sin, with the radical difference, of course, that it repudiates the religious significance of sin, which it calls instead "freedom," whether as "self-interest" or "self-fulfillment." In passing, I may mention that the "worldly" character of the useful contributed to the rapidly increasing importance of history in the seventeenth century, and paradoxically enough, to the ultimate secularization of religion through the medium of post-Hegelian philosophies of history. One might object to the preceding remarks that, in seventeenth century philosophy, the mathematical order of the world was re- garded as proof of the goodness, reasonableness, and power of the creator-God. A proper examination of this issue would fill several tion of the most important with the transrational is as much an ancestor of existentialism as Kierkegaard's emphasis on paradox. For the Christian demotion (Augustine) of the pagan notion of utilitas (Cicero), cf. H. Blumenberg, "Kosmos und System," Studium Generale, Heft 2, 1957, p. 68 (esp. n. 33). For the philo- sophical distinction between the beautiful and the good, see Descartes, Passions de l'Ame lxxxv; cf. cxlv, cxlvii and Meditationes, Adam-Tannery, Vol. VII, p. 15. 3 Although the initial impetus for the conception of order in mathematical terms came from the influence of Plato, the transformation in the understanding of the nature of mathematics as applicable to the study and manipulation of the sensible world was the most important factor in the seventeenth century revolt against the "ancients." For the difference between Leibniz and such thinkers as Descartes and Spinoza, see his Discours de Métaphysique, II (God is not a tyrant because reason is prior to will), IV (the rebelliousness of those dissatisfied with God's work), XVIII-XIX (against the repudiation of final causes).</page><page sequence="6">REFLECTIONS ON HEIDEGGER 265 large volumes. In the present context, I take refuge in the explicit character of the modern, mathematically inspired project to mas- ter nature, with special reference to the repudiation of teleology: the doctrine of final causes or ends intrinsic to nature. If "to rea- son" is "to know," and "to know" is to discern numerical and geo- metrical order, then there is no rational significance to statements about the "nobility" or "baseness" of numbers and shapes, no knowledge of God's intentions in creating those numbers and shapes. Whatever we may hope or believe about the eschatologi- cal significance of the mathematical order, there is no rational evi- dence or demonstration of these hopes and beliefs. In this sense, mathematically inspired philosophy confirmed the "fundamental- ist" contention of Christianity that faith is extra-rational, and in- deed, absurd. It led or contributed strongly to the force of the view that all expressions concerning the good in any sense other than the useful are empty of cognitive or rational content, however necessary for human existence. In a word, it played a decisive role in establishing the view that one may speak rationally about util- ity, but not about nobility or beauty. This view is one of the major tenets of what may be briefly called "positivistic empiricism." It is not necessary in the present context to discuss the "logical" or "ontological" defects in the vari- ous versions of positivistic empiricism. If time permitted, it would be instructive to consider the classical case of David Hume, who makes most evident the lines of parentage connecting contempor- ary empiricism and existentialism. Hume's skeptical epistemology contains in a sober form the seeds of Nietzsche's doctrine of crea- tivity and the will to power; it anticipates in its emphasis upon pas- sion and imagination the radically irrational nature of the contem- porary understanding of reason shared by empiricists and existen- tialists alike.4 We even find in Hume's melancholy, and his turn 4 The following passages may be cited from Hume's A Treatise of Human Nature (Oxford: 1955), in support of the general statement in the text: for the derivation of ideas and memory from the imagination, pp. 88 if., 265-267; for the "natural order" as a product of the imagination, pp. 251, 258-259; for philos-</page><page sequence="7">266 SOCIAL RESEARCH for relief from philosophy to the passionate, physical, concrete character of everyday life, the ancestor of existential dread as the illumination of man's being-in-the-world.5 Hume would seem to testify to the truth of the inference that, if the positivistic empiri- cists are correct, one would do well to become an existentialist. Nor is it an accident that existentialists, in attributing nihilism to the consequences of rationalism, accept without quarrel the posi- tivistic definition of reason. But I must leave my historical preface at these few remarks. I hope they will at least have suggested why the present opposition between empiricists and existentialists is more specious than real. The inner agreement between these two broad groups has contributed significantly to the astonishing ac- celeration in the popularity of existentialism. When reason asserts, or makes evident, its inability to assist us in the search for meaning and coherence, the result is a proliferation of romanticist ideolo- gies. And the ideology of existentialism is not simply more ob- viously "human" than the ideology of computers but one might venture to say that it is more reasonable as well. In any event, existentialism seems to address itself to the "whole man" as empiricism, or positivistic empiricism, does not. Unlike even "ordinary language philosophy," it has learned to speak in the language of ordinary life. Let us turn now to a general considera- tion of the existentialist ideology, in order to see as clearly as possi- ble the character of its popular appeal. Ill The ostensible dispute between empiricism and existentialism is in fact an internecine quarrel about eschatology. The empiri- cists in their presently dominant form seem to have taken too liter- ally the words of Saint John: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God." This kind of fundamentalism seems to have led to a reduction of existence to speech, or almost to a failure ophy as "calm passion," a specious inference of rest from motion, a matter of feeling, and a slave to the passions, pp. 103, 115, 415, 437. s Ibid., p. 270.</page><page sequence="8">REFLECTIONS ON HEIDEGGER 267 to remember that one must first exist in order to speak.6 It is true that the linguists would reply: speech alone gives meaning to existence. But one may wonder whether, if existence is a mode of speech, it is possible to make more than a verbal distinction be- tween existence and non-existence. To speak of the "logic of negation," for example, is radically different from speaking about the significance of death. The existentialists, too, at least in their most serious moments, would agree that speech gives meaning to existence, but they define speech as the consequence of the pre- logical dimensions of the structure of existence. For existential- ism, the structure of existence is not logical because it does not consist of pure forms and their rationally determinable relations» The existentialist regards the classical doctrine of forms as defec- tive in at least two related senses. The forms, he says, are not the true visible presence of things, but mental "photographs" or sub- jective distortions of the true visible presence. Second, although originally created or "projected" by man, thanks to his "will to power," or desire to dominate his environment, the forms assume an independent status as an obstacle between man and existence. To a "reasonable" man in the Greek sense of the term, forms are bonds that hold things together, thereby granting intelligibility as well as existence. To the existentialist, the term "bond" is an ac- curate suggestion of their true function; namely, to serve as chains which restrict man's freedom. The path to freedom for existentialism, in a way which is a direct consequence of the mod- ern rebellion against antiquity, lies in casting off the chains of will corrupted by reason, and returning to prior intimacy with Being e Philosophical students of ordinary language would of course maintain that the study of words is for the sake of sharpening "our perception, though not as the final arbiter of, the phenomena" (John Austin in "A Plea for Excuses," Philo- sophical Papers, Oxford: 1961, p. 130). My own feeling is that this qualification is forgotten in practice, if not in theory. The statement in the text of this paper refers to the practical impression and influence of the linguistic empiricists, and not to a correct understanding of the principles which motivate them. I believe my statement is sufficiently general to cover the various forms of linguistic em- piricism, which for the purposes of the present paper are less important in their differences than in their similarities.</page><page sequence="9">268 SOCIAL RESEARCH as accessible through "mood." True speech emerges from the intimate experience of existence, from man's "openness" or at- tunement to the world, and not from the objectification of that experience in the artificial bonds of logical discourse. With some narrowing of focus, existentialism might be understood as a conse- quence of one aspect of the revolutionary teaching of Rousseau. "Man is born free, yet everywhere he is in chains." The chains are forged by reason, which is evil; the fire that melts the chains is the "sentiment of existence," which is good. Of course, the good- ness of this sentiment was for Rousseau inseparable from its pleasantness, whereas for the existentialist, the key, liberating sentiment is painful. But Rousseau was more pagan than Chris- tian; existentialism is in large part an elaboration, in "up to date" terms, of the Christian doctrine of original sin and redemption. Rousseau's concern with the sentiment of existence as the source of happiness led him to a defense of democracy. The existentialist's concern with the sentiment of existence as the source of freedom leads to an essentially democratic doctrine of sincerity or authen- ticity. Few people reason well; but the sentiment of existence is immediately accessible to man as man. Of course, the purity of this sentiment is from the beginning beclouded by the various evils that stem ultimately from ratio or discursive and calculative rea- soning. But even though a great Thinker be required to think away the evil and difficult chains, the resultant freedom is not re- stricted to great Thinkers, but is available to each of the former slaves. Despite its difficulty as an academic enterprise, existential- ism speaks to the common man, and his preoccupation today with death, loneliness, alienation, the absence of God, or summarily, with anxiety or dread. However serious, however virtuous it may authentically be, existentialism owes its public success to the ease with which it may be converted into a public ideology. This pub- lic ideology is especially attractive because it confirms the widely felt distaste for the public. Existentialism is a public ideology which grants the superiority of the private to the public. It ap- peals to each member of the public, but as a private or unique</page><page sequence="10">REFLECTIONS ON HEIDEGGER 269 individual. The ideology of existentialism fills the vacuum in our time which has arisen from the decay of reason, and especially of political philosophy, as well as from the loss of old-fashioned religious faith. And it satisfies the remaining traces of our prefer- ence for the private individual. Despite its suspicious continental origins, and the residual Anglophilia of many philosophy profes- sors, I am tempted to say that existentialism is as American as ap- ple pie.7 IV So much then for an introductory portrait of existentialism as an ideology, and the strength it derives from the contemporary decay in the understanding of "reason." Let us now try to see how the various features of this ideology have their more serious counter- part in the thought of Heidegger. It is instructive to begin our discussion of Heidegger with a reminder of his own brief foray into the world of political ideology. As is well known, Heidegger was an early member and enthusiastic supporter of the Nazi Party, albeit for a relatively short time. This attachment gave birth to a number of speeches, delivered during Heidegger's tenure as rec- tor of Freiburg University, which may fairly be described as an effort to justify National Socialism by assimilating the terms of his own philosophy to those of the popular Nazi vocabulary.8 For ? In many ways, John Dewey illustrates the "American" dimension of existential- ism, and one could show similarities between existentialism and nineteenth century American literature; perhaps Thoreau is the best example. »The full texts of these speeches are not currently available in English. See Die Selbstbehauptung der deutschen Universität (Breslau: 1934) and Nachlese zu Heideg- ger, G. Schneeberger, ed. (Bern: 1962). The only serious studies of the philosophi- cal significance of these speeches, so far as I know, are by Europeans: K. Lowith, Heidegger: Denker in dürftiger Zeit (Göttingen, 2nd ed., 1960) and Gesammelte Abhandlungen (Stuttgart: 1960) are basic; cf. also his article, "Les Implications Politiques de la Philosophie de l'Existence Chez Heidegger" in Les Temps Modernes, Paris: 1946 (2). A very valuable study, A. Schwan's Politische Philoso- phie im Denken Heideggers (Köln und Opladen: 1965) may be highly recommended and has been of great assistance to me in preparing parts of this paper. Finally, cf. the articles by J. P. Faye, "Heidegger et la 'Révolution' " and "Attaques Nazies Contre Heidegger" in Médiations, Autumn 1961 and Summer 1962, which show the care taken by Heidegger to speak in the Nazi idiom.</page><page sequence="11">270 SOCIAL RESEARCH obvious reasons, this aspect of Heidegger's career has not been emphasized by his disciples, but I believe they are quite mistaken in their claim, however sincere, that it is irrelevant to the master's serious thought and should be put to one side as a naive aberra- tion. The very least one could say is that the ease with which Heidegger succeeded in accommodating the teaching of Being and Time to the resolute choice of Hitler and the Nazi Party, provides us with an essential clue to the political philosophy implicit in his ontological analysis of human existence.9 It may be wise to state in advance the general difficulty of the political implications of Heidegger's thought. On the one hand, Heidegger places man in the position of having necessarily to choose, and to translate into action, the historical manifestation of Being. On the other hand, he forewarns man against the possibility of making a correct choice, and even maintains that to choose at all, in the terms of acting for or against what is humanly desirable or undesirable, is to contribute to nihilism. To some degree, the apparent contra- diction in this advice may be explained by a change in Heidegger's thought, but this is not the full explanation. As I hope to show in the balance of this article, the contradiction is ingrained in Heidegger's teaching from its beginning to its end. And this "practical" embarrassment is the sign of a theoretical incoherence. At least in the early period of Heidegger's thought, the process by which Being reveals itself in history (and in a sense to be ex- plained later, as history), was regarded as a consequence of human activity.10 Therefore, the process could be modified by man's will » Cf. Lowith, "Les Implications Politiques . . . ," p. 358: "La possibilité de la politique philosophique de Heidegger n'est pas née à un 'déraillement' qu' on pourrait regretter, mais du principe même de sa conception de l'existence qui combat à la fois et assume 'l'esprit du temps.' " The truth of this observation is thoroughly documented in Schwan's by no means hostile book, cited above. IOC/.

In a sense peculiar to Heidegger, German students were told by him that "the Führer himself and alone is the present and future Ger- man reality and its law/' 13 The will of the Führer as the expres- sion of the historical destiny of the German people thus replaces "Ideas/* science, and the specious freedom, academic or otherwise, by which an objective rationalism has duped the West.14 These practical translations of Heidegger's teaching have been neither repudiated by him nor altogether superseded by later develop- ments in his thought. They follow from Heidegger's peculiar interpretation of Being as Time or History, in the first as well as the last stages of his thought.15 Bearing in mind the clue of Hei- degger's political pronouncements, let us now try to obtain a gen- Kampf entfaltet, im Kampf gesteigert und als Kampf bewahrt bleiben."

Being, to repeat, is a process, and a total process, rather than a static entity, sub-stratum, sub- stance, or principle.17 This process has no "ground" other than its own activity, which is thus involved with Nothingness, and in two senses. First, Being, as a totality or whole, is delimited or finite, and so defined by Nothingness.18 We cannot conceive of Being as a whole except by an encounter with Nothingness. But, second, we cannot grasp the sense of our life as a whole except by facing up to our death; Nothingness is not simply external to Be- ing, but occurs within the world of human existence.19 Since man is a being-in-the-world, he could never encounter Nothingness if it did not occur within the world. The world, one might say, is woven together from the threads of Being and Nothingness. Although the importance of Nothingness in Heidegger's later thought may perhaps be said to have decreased, the same funda- mental theme is constantly present in the relationship between Be- ing and Time. Time is the horizon within which Being occurs or 16 The best general introduction to Heidegger's thought is Otto Pöggeler, Heideg- ger (Pfüllingen: 1963); the most comprehensive introduction in English is W. J. Richardson, S.J., Heidegger (The Hague: 1963). Both works are extremely sym- pathetic to Heidegger; neither gives any account of his political activities or their relationship to his thought as a whole. 17 In what are perhaps the most obscure passages in neiaegger s puuusucu writings, he refers occasionally to the unknown and unthought "source" of the Being-process: e.g., Identität und Differenz (Pfüllingen: 1957), p. 44; Nietzsche (Pfüllingen: 1961), Vol. I, p. 471; Vol. II, p. 484; Unterwegs, p. 31. But that this "source" cannot be understood as a transcendental ground of Being seems clear from Der Satz vom Grund (Pfüllingen: 1957), pp. 184-185, where Being is said to be "groundless" or an Abgrund in the sense that it "is" as grounding, or "is" the same as its ground. In any case, there is no doubt that Being, as process, and so as the opening within which this process unfolds, is Time. is Was ist Metaphysik? (Frankfurt: 1951), pp. 35-3Ò.

Time not merely reveals or "gives birth," but it also con- ceals or "destroys." 20 If there is anything in Heidegger to corres- pond to the general characteristics of Being, about which tradi- tional philosophers speak, it would be the patterns of temporality, the "ways" 21 in which things (that is, beings) come to be and pass away.22 Being is thus the "way of ways"; it is not the Greek physis but the Chinese Tao.2S For these "ways," since they are patterns or accumulations of temporality, are themselves coming to be and passing away. One of the most fundamental aspects of Heidegger's thought is understood wh'en we realize that Being, as radically temporal, lacks any vestige of eternity, and so is equiva- lent to, if not identical with, what has traditionally been known as genesis. The Being of Heidegger is a genesis without a generator, or, as Nietzsche said, "a work of art giving birth to itself." 24 In the ab- sence of eternity, a radically temporal, radically immanent world owes its "sense" or "significance" to the way in which it presents itself to man. Differently stated, the world is a presentation only to and because of man, who assists it in its birth-throes, and who may thus be understood as the midwife of Being and truth.25 Just as the radical temporality of the Being-process excludes any eter- nal or "objective" standards by which to distinguish between truth and error, which are even said to be essentially the same,26 so it subtly erases the distinction between thinking and doing in the 20 Heidegger's analysis of "Der Spruch des Anaximander" is paradigmatic for this theme in his teaching (in Holzwege, Frankfurt: 1952). 2i Hence, I believe, the special significance of Heidegger's continuous emphasis on philosophy, or genuine thinking, as a "way" or Unterwegs. 22 Cf.

Hence the extraordin- ary importance which Heidegger gives to poetry and "poetic think- ing." 29 Heidegger claims to avoid the problem of "perspectivism" or "subjectivity" implicit in Western philosophy from Plato to Nietzsche, despite the central role he gives to man in the revela- tion of Being or truth. Since Being is process, it has no fixed na- ture in the traditional sense of the term. Instead, it may be de- scribed as a process which reveals itself, epoch by epoch, to man,30 and thereby, since man is that aspect of Being through which the revelation occurs, to itself. Beneath the Nietzschean surfaces of Heidegger's thought we may detect a continuing Hegelian reson- ance. Being is not nature but History, or, to distinguish it from history in the vulgar sense, Historicity. Human history is then the medium through which Being as Historicity presents itself to itself, or becomes self -conscious.31 Man is the self-reflexive dimen- sion of Being (to use my own terms). As a consequence, the domi- 27 in this respect, Heidegger carries through a pervasive theme in modern philosophy, to which he ostensibly objects, but which he gives a "poetic" re- formulation in place of the mathematical or epistemological. Relevant here is his explication of the authentic sense of crocia, àX^Oeta and 'o70s in pre-Socratic thought. For a technical discussion of these interpretations, and expansions of several other points raised in the present paper, cf. my "Heidegger's Interpretation of Plato, Pt.

At the same time, each revelation is also an obscuration, and in two dif- ferent senses. The first sense is in a way analogous to Hegel's understanding of each philosophical teaching prior to his own as a necessary but in- complete element in the final revelation of the whole. Given the identification of Being as Historicity, no epoch can manifest the truth of Being as a whole, in any way other than to show that the Historicity of Being precludes a final wisdom concerning it. But second, since Being is a process whereby beings occur, the process itself is obscured by the very manner in which it functions. It is possible for a man to attain to the understanding that Being as a whole reveals-and-conceals itself as a series of epochs or perspec- tives. The term ' 'perspective" must then be understood as re- ferring to Being rather than to man. In attaining to this under- standing, man lets Being be in its own terms, or as it conceals-and- reveals itself, in and through the fundamental activities of man. He does not enforce a partial and subjective interpretation on to the Being-process, as for example the Platonic theory of Ideas or the Aristotelian categories.32 Such an interpretation erects a static and distorting screen between man and the self-revealing-and-con- cealing process of which man is himself, so to speak, a sub-process. The fact that man sees being rather than Being means that he fails to see the absence of Being. He fails to see that he does not see Being, and that he cannot "see'' Being, if "to see" means "to reason" in the traditional sense. For "seeing" qua "reasoning" or ratio is a seeing of things, a measuring of the forms of beings as they look or appear to us, and not an openness to Being as the process whereby things take shape, whereby beings form (in the 32 This problem is most fully treated in the two volumes devoted to Nietzsche.</page><page sequence="17">276 SOCIAL RESEARCH active sense of the word).33 In sum, there are two different senses in which Being is concealed. The first, and structurally intrinsic sense, is the concealment of Being by its own activity, by the emergence of beings. The second sense is the concealment of Be- ing by philosophical theories or perspectivai visions imposed on to Being by the human will. As I noted in the comparison to Hegel, these concealing theories are not simply deplorable mistakes, all- too-human errors which might have been rectified by greater intelligence or closer scrutiny. They are necessary errors, the "err- ance" of truth, the way in which Being has hitherto chosen to re- veal - or rather, to conceal - itself.34 The gift of Being, even though requiring man for its disclosure, seems very much like Fate. But what has happened to the resolute choice by which the individual and the people were said in Being and Time and the political speeches to determine their future and even save the Western world? The attempt to give a coherent account of Hei- degger's teaching would seem to founder upon a change in that teaching. And so we must turn again to Heidegger's own history. The least one can say is that there is a shift in emphasis, follow- ing the early writings, on the degree of autonomy and so of free- dom 35 enjoyed by man. It is interesting to note that this change takes place in the time just following Heidegger's resignation from his post as rector of Freiburg University. A cynic might express the change as follows.36 Prior to Heidegger's disillusionment with the Nazis, he emphasized the contingency of Historicity and man's capacity to ground a true understanding of Being in historical ac- 33 The best known statement of Heidegger's criticism of the "correspondence theory" of truth is probably in Piatons Lehre von der Wahrheit, but again, the Nietzsche volumes present a much more adequate treatment. 34 A good summary and documentation of this point will be found in bchwan, Politische Philosophie, eh. II. 35 Die Selbstbehauptung, p. 15: freedom is self-legislation. This corresponds to the notion of Eigentlichkeit in Sein und Zeit. In the later work, freedom is called "das lichtend Verbergende" (Vorträge und Aufsätze), p. 33. 36 Lowith, Denker in dürftiger Zeit, p. 55; Schwan, pp. 94, 105, 171. For a more sympathetic account of Heidegger's Kehre by a penetrating author, cf. W. Schulz, "Über den philosophiegeschichtliche Ort Martin Heideggers" in Philosophische Rundschau, 1953-1954, Heft 2-3, 4, esp. pp. 83 ff.</page><page sequence="18">REFLECTIONS ON HEIDEGGER 277 tions. After this disillusionment, he came to insist upon the neces- sary duality of truth and error, and man's incapacity to resist or alter what fate gives in the shape of each epoch.37 Heidegger has himself uttered a complex statement concerning this much-de- bated issue of the "turn" in his thought.38 He affirms the turn in the admission that the thinking of Being and Time was still a prisoner of the metaphysical language it sought to overcome. But he denies it by insisting that he has always remained within the "matter for thought" of Being and Time; namely, the "time- character" out of which Being occurs. The "happening" of the turn is then interpreted as itself a happening of Being, and so the "transition" between the two stages of his thought is itself a gift of Being, or a consequent expression of the light-that-conceals. V For all its difficulties, Being and Time presents us with a co- herent and detailed analysis of human experience, which may be accepted or rejected in much the same way that the reader would consider the merits of, say, the pragmatism of John Dewey. The second stage of Heidegger's work, although by no means homo- geneous in style or content, and despite many lucid and compelling strands, is radically more obscure. Instead of beginning with man or the structure of human existence as revelatory of the pervasive ways of Being, Heidegger comes more and more to begin with a direct meditation on Being itself. This meditation has often been compared to the procedures of the German mystics, whom Heideg- ger himself greatly admires.39 The existential analytic disappears altogether, or at least sinks into the background. The language is no more that of phenomenology or ontology, but that of a prophet. What one might perhaps call "analytic" thinking is largely re- 37 For a relatively straightforward passage defining the "new" position, cf.

Even in his etymological analyses of the fundamental words in Western thought, Heidegger speaks - or rather sings - as a shepherd of Being, a new Hesiod whose Muse is not human experience but Being itself. Heidegger is nevertheless right to insist upon the continuity between the two stages of his thought. For in both stages, Being is understood from within the horizon of temporality. And both stages manifest the same funda- mental difficulty in Heidegger's teaching: how to distinguish be- tween man and Being. I have emphasized that, for Heidegger, Being is a process that "occurs" as a "show" in and through man or Dasein. Not merely is the horizon of man's vision temporal, but as the opening within which the show of the Being-process transpires, it is identical with, or exemplifies, the Being-process. The openness of Sein and the openness of Dasein are one and the same. Given his special etymologies of the constituent terms, which I believe to be de- cisively influenced by Hegel and Nietzsche, Heidegger accepts the Parmenidean utterance that "thinking and being are the same." "The same" is for Heidegger the scission within Being between it- self and thought; but at the root of this duality is a unity which one may follow Heidegger in calling their need for each other. In the present discussion, beyond what has already been said, I shall limit myself to mentioning an example that illustrates the diffi- culty of distinguishing between man and Being.41 According to Heidegger, to name "man" is to name residence in the fourfold unity of heaven, earth, divine and mortal; this fourfold unity is also the "structural" framework of a "thing" or "being," and hence is identical with the structure of Being or the World.42 The 40 Richardson, p. 16; Vorträge, pp. 138 ff.; Unterwegs, pp. 30 ff., 180, 200, et passim. This is not to suggest, of course, that the untranslatable "dichtendes Denken" is equivalent to "poetry." Cf. Was ist Metaphysik?, p. 46; Was Heisst Denken?, pp. 8, 92 ff., 125 ff.; Humanismus, pp. 75, 79, 115, 119. 4i For a detailed discussion of this point, see the article cited in note ¿1 above. 42 Vorträge, pp. 163 ff.: cf. Identität und Differenz (Pfüllingen: 1957), pp. 21 ff.</page><page sequence="20">REFLECTIONS ON HEIDEGGER 279 fourfold unity articulates the structure of the way of ways, and so too underlies the capacity of human activity to reveal Being by liv- ing in harmony with it. As is suggested by the unusual importance Heidegger gives to agricultural imagery, Being "grows'' from the soil as a harmony of the gift of heaven and the shaping work of man, who thereby shapes himself as well. Since the speech of man is the speech of Being, man both creatively participates in the (self-) revelation of Being, and is the passive audience of that revelation.43 This am- biguity in the relationship between man and Being gives rise to two different temptations when we try to understand the genuine sense of the "gifts" or "happenings" which constitute the His- toricity of Being.44 The temptation is very great, despite Hei- degger's consistent denial of eternity, to understand Being as the gift of a Deus Absconditus, a temptation to which contemporary theologians are submitting with steadily increasing momentum.45 On the other hand, we may feel ourselves tempted to say that, since Being reveals itself to the vision and speech of man, it is really man who gives himself the gift of Being, albeit in such a way as to prevent himself from making full use of it. These two temptations are strangely similar to the two extreme interpretations that have been given to the teaching of Hegel. Either, namely, that the world is the unfolding of God, or that it is the self-fulfillment of man. The "orthodox" interpretation of Hegel would presumably maintain that both alternatives are cor- rect; that is, man becomes fulfilled by the unfolding of God, or the 43 Cf. Was Heisst Denken?, pp. 127-128; Vorträge, pp. 208 ff., for a confrontation of the passive and active sides to speech or thinking. The reinterpretation of Sein und Zeit, p. 212, given in Humanismus, p. 83, is extremely illuminating here. See also Einführung in die Metaphysik, pp. 131 ff. and Richardson, p. 296. In Heideg- ger's political speeches, the active side is exaggerated to the point of violence. 44 Heidegger plays upon the etymological relation between Geschehen and Geschenk to Geschichte. In the text, for purposes of simplification, I have not distinguished between Geschichte and Geschichtlichkeit, but the context should make clear which sense of "Historicity" is intended. 45 Cf. Hans Jonas, "Heidegger and Theology" in Review of Metaphysics, Dec. 1964, and W. J. Richardson, S.J., "Heidegger and God - and Professor Jonas" in Thought, Spring, 1965.</page><page sequence="21">280 SOCIAL RESEARCH final identification between the development of Absolute Spirit and human history. Such an interpretation is possible in the case of Hegel because of his claim that both developments have a culmination or completion in his own time, as reflected in the systematic exposition his writings give to wisdom. For Heidegger, of course, there is no wisdom in this sense because there is no transcendence of Time; the Being-process, as it were, is not circu- lar. We may also, and perhaps more profitably, compare Hei- degger to Nietzsche. The many similarities between the teachings of the two men could be represented by the following ambiguity in Nietzsche's thought. If all interpretations of the world are ac- tually, as Nietzsche claimed, human projects or subjective inven- tions, if the very notion of " world" is already an interpretation of chaos, what of Nietzsche's own teaching? Is the doctrine of the will to power itself a human perspective, or is it a transcendence of chaos and a true revelation of the nature of genesis as the eternal return? Does man become God in enacting (if not understand- ing) Nietzsche's teaching, or does the enactment of that teaching confirm the divinity of nature? Nietzsche once remarked that he who would understand Zara- thustra must have one foot beyond life.46 This expression captures the dilemma faced by a thinker who identifies Being with Time. If the identification is true, it can be seen only by one who tran- scends and so contradicts it. Nietzsche is more consistent than Heidegger at least in this sense; he recognized that his teaching gave man the gift of eternity. Heidegger makes no such claim; as a result, his revelation stands unprotected before the winds of Time by anything other than the resoluteness, or finally the sub- missiveness, of the prophet.47 But how are we to distinguish reso- luteness from deluded stubbornness, or submissiveness from en- slavement? What distinguishes the revelation of God from the cunning of Satan? What is to prevent the ostensible merits of 46Ecce Homo in Werke, ed. Schlechta, Vol. 2, p. 1076. *? Cf. Was Heisst Denken?, p. 52.</page><page sequence="22">REFLECTIONS ON HEIDEGGER 281 Heidegger's relevation from being erased by the next epochal gift of the Historicity of Being? The identification of Being with Time, and of Time as His- toricity, results in a melting away of man into Being, and thence in what I am inclined to call a "fatalistic anthropomorphism." Nevertheless, it is easy to sympathize with Heidegger's intention to overcome the dualism implicit in the distinction between "be- ing" and "thinking." Very deep in the philosophical enterprise of Western man, and for that matter in the speculative thought of man wherever we find him, is the striving for unity, not simply within oneself, but between oneself and the environment or world. Heidegger's doctrine of authentic existence, and its subse- quent revision in the doctrine of recollective, poetic, or listening thinking, are unmistakably similar to the religious doctrine of salvation through unity with God. But traditional religion, like the tradition of philosophy which Heidegger calls "Platonism," provides a standard of salvation or human perfection which is rooted in a distinction between Being and Time. Within the tradition, "reasonable" or genuine thinking makes possible the uncovering of divine commandments or rational ends, or the evaluation of the daily perplexities of human existence by what one may call the light of Being. Heidegger, like most philos- ophers after Hegel, repudiates these commandments and ends as specious constructions derived from the mutilation of Being and its partition between two worlds: the supersensible or eternal and the sensible or temporal. But by replacing eternity with Histo- ricity, Heidegger achieves a unity which is in fact a monism as un- tenable as the consequences of "mathematical" thinking. In the first stage of his thought, Heidegger distinguished be- tween "ontological" and "on tic" speech, or speech in terms of Be- ing and speech in terms of things. Although this terminology is not prominent in his later writings, the distinction continues in an exaggerated form. Genuine thinking is the thinking "of" Being, in the dual sense that man thinks Being, and his thoughts are given to him by Being. As is especially clear when the thinking</page><page sequence="23">282 SOCIAL RESEARCH 4 'of" Being comes to be identified with an acceptance of its gifts, the genuine thinker can attach no "worth" to "what happens*' or is "revealed." To pass judgment on the justice, dignity or excel- lence of the gifts of Being, is to succumb to "moral Pharisaism," 4S to the merely ontic and subjective interpretations which are be- neath the dignity of the genuine thinker; and even worse, which replace the merely subjective or merely "objectified" projections of man for the genuine apprehension of the voice of Being.49 It degrades the dignity of Being to the level of mere utility.™ In other words, genuine thinking, exactly like mathematical ontology, is unable to make value-judgments. In Being and Time authen- ticity follows from the resolute self-acceptance of the Historicity of one's time, from obedience to the silent voice of conscience in the face of Being-unto-death, from acceptance of the possibility given one by the concrete historical situation. Nothing is said as to which contemporary possibility is authentic; since the ontological foundations of authenticity result in the identification of the his- torical situation as our only guide to action, we are encouraged to act in accordance with the spirit of the times. It is therefore a perfectly natural consequence of Heidegger's teaching that we identify ourselves with the most forceful expression of the spirit of the times, as he himself did with Hitler and the Nazi Party in 1933. It is, then, scarcely a matter of chance, or of Heidegger's naivete, that he found it possible to translate his ontology into the terms of folk, blood, soil, and the will of the Führer.51 But strangely enough, the susceptibility of Heidegger's thought to dominance by the spirit of the times becomes more evident with the changes he introduced in his "post-Hitlerian" period. We have already exam- ined the evidence, and it remains only to summarize the issue. The obscuration of Being by beings is encouraged by the technical, calculative or objectifying thinking which seeks to dominate the *sSein und Zeit. p. 291. 49 Humanismus, pp. 99, 105-106, 111; cf.

But this process of domination cannot itself be dominated or terminated; it must fulfill itself as a mandate from Being. And this mandate, despite its parlous and even nihilistic character, with the danger it brings of the destruction even of the human race, in being ful- filled, also reveals the sense of Being as Historicity.52 It reveals the sense of Being as presence-and-absence, but also as temporal process which, in completing each stage, "clears the stage" for new possibilities, for which man, and the exemplary authentic thinker, can only wait. To attempt to accelerate the demise or completion of our present parlous stage would be to surrender to its implicit nihilism, for nihilism is the will to will, the will to dominate Being instead of letting it be. Nihilism is now identified as the forgetting of Being, but yet also as the gift of Being, which must be allowed to run its course. Here again we see the ambiguous relationship between man's ac- tivity and the revelation of Being. Being gives man nihilism, yet man is the agent of nihilism. Hence the strange conclusion that to act against nihilism is to act against Being, and so to perpetuate nihilism. The practical inference from this line of reasoning was now no longer to favor the Nazi regime, but rather to state that all contemporary ideologies are metaphysically the same,53 One might then express the difference between the early and the later Heidegger as a change in emphasis from resolution to "calmness" in the sense of resigned letting-be (Gelassenheit). In either case, history is given decisive control over the shape of human destiny. Whether we regard historical events as mere contingency or as the voice of fate, the practical result is the same: man becomes the prisoner of the most forceful contemporary opinion. In his desire not to do violence to Being, man is violated by Being. The re- sult is strangely similar to the practical consequences of the identi- fication of reason and mathematics. Since philosophical thinking 52 Schwan 's summary of texts on this point is clear and convincing (ch. VIII, pp. 146 ff). sa Schwan, p. 131 and note 46.</page><page sequence="25">284 SOCIAL RESEARCH can give no guidance with respect to the reasonableness o£ ends or values, the vacuum is filled by ideology. VI And so I return to the general considerations with which I began. In my necessarily brief sketch of Heidegger's interpre- tation of Being, I hope to have suggested the relation between his ontology or authentic thinking and some of the most power- ful elements within contemporary ideologies of irrationalism. It is a shorter step than one might suspect from the conception of Being as "happening'' (Geschehen) to the popular slogan, "It's what's happening, baby!" The contemporary celebration of nihilism that has effaced the lines of separation between "pop cult" and philosphical culture cannot, of course, be exclusively understood in terms of the philosophical teaching that derives from Heidegger, Nietzsche, and other nineteenth century sources. It is nevertheless true that ever-increasing numbers of Americans are undergoing a course of evolution (or devolution) which, with all allowances for the differing environment, is strikingly similar to what took place among German intellectuals in the years following the First World War. The peculiar flavor of contempo- rary American life (and of course, not just American) arises from a mixture of such apparently diverse elements as a susceptibility to German philosophies of history among our academicians, the unreasonableness of positivistically-oriented scientific rationalism, the American tradition of individualism, and the cumulative effect of long-unsolved political problems. We are living today in an age which is dominated by two types of an apparently opposing nature: the radically historical indi- vidual, with his emphasis upon discontinuity, spontaneity, and freedom in the sense of the repudiation of tradition, and the technologically-oriented epigone of the mathematical branch of the European Enlightenment. The first type, as we have pointed out at some length, faces the winds of history with a resolute help- lessness that either encourages or acquiesces in political chaos.</page><page sequence="26">REFLECTIONS ON HEIDEGGER 285 The second type, despite the extraordinary power at his disposal, is perhaps even more helpless than the first, who has at least learned from history to distrust the fatuous optimism of reason conceived as the crystallization of passion. We may surmise the inner connection between these two types from the following phe- nomenon. Of the four virtues defined within the Socratic tra- dition, wisdom is never and moderation rarely praised by in- stances of the aforementioned two types of individuals. In the political dilemmas of our time, we are exhorted to be either courageous or just, but the prevalent conception of reason makes both courage and justice irrational. When courage and justice are sundered from wisdom and moderation, they cannot serve as the basis for a rational political philosophy, but give birth to ideology instead. One may honor the righteousness with which the "treason of the clerks" is con- demned, whether in the name of intellectual or existential in- tegrity. But one must not cease to ask for the criterion by which integrity is distinguished from corruption. It may well be true that the heart has reasons which reason does not know. But let us at least insist that the reasons of the heart be known to the heart, and so that it be able to give an account of its reasons to rea- son. The severance of the heart from the head, whether directed by the head or the heart, leads neither to integrity nor resolve, but only to a meaningless death.</page></plain_text>
