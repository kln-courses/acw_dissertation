<plain_text><page sequence="1">The First Million Years: The Archaeology of Protohuman Culture NICHOLAS TOTH KATHY D. SCHICK INTRODUCTION The paleoanthropologist's dream is to discover some relict population of pro tohumans in an isolated part of the world who have remained virtually unchanged in some 2 million years of hominid evolution elsewhere. Both biologically and culturally they would be a nearly perfect analogue to our early stone-tool making ancestors. During the years following this hypothetical discovery, care ful studies might be conducted regarding these creatures' social organization, communication systems, physical and cognitive abilities, technology, and sub sistence patterns. From this cornucopia of information, explanatory models of early hominid behavior and adaptation could be generated and applied to the early prehistoric record. The possibility of such a discovery is, alas, nonexistent. In the present day there are no reasonable facsimiles of the world's first animals to make and use flaked stone tools, so we are restricted to the hard evidence of the prehistoric record and the imperfect analogues of modern phenomena in our attempts to gain insights into how early hominids lived. Specialists in protohuman archaeology sometimes have the feeling of groping in a very dark, but not quite pitch-black, room in search of some unknown creature; bits and pieces of information are ADVANCES IN ARCHAEOLOGICAL Copyright ? 1986 by Academic Press, Inc.

SCHICK recovered and subjected to analysis, but a firm image of the total animal is ever elusive. The challenge to paleoanthropologists is to find out as much as possible about early hominids and to try to explain why events and processes in hominid evolution occurred as they did. Unlike the archaeologists studying more recent periods, we can make no. assumption that the prehistoric creatures being studied were very similar to existing peoples either physically, mentally, or culturally. Preconceptions as to what these early hominids were like may vary depending upon one's predispositions and sources of evidence-occasionally they may appear to be just slightly subhuman, and at other times, just slightly super-ape.

Although archaeological data bases and theoretical stances change through time, prehistory only happened in one way. There is a definite reality recorded in those ancient sediments, and it is the archaeologist's challenge to decipher it. It is essential that we pursue all lines of evidence to the limits of our interpretive abilities in order to obtain the clearest possible picture of early hominid behavior and adaptation. Scope This chapter is a review of methodological and theoretical advances in the field of the archaeology of human origins since 1975. We stress the period between approximately 1.5 and 2.5 m.y.a., within a time span referred to as the</page><page sequence="4">4 NICHOLAS TOTH AND KATHY D. SCHICK "Plio-Pleistocene" (the commencement of the Pleistocene epoch is now consid ered to be about 1.7 m.y.a.; Berggren et al. 1980). It will be noted that all of the archaeological evidence from this period is restricted to the African continent (Figure 1.1). Evidence appears in various places in Africa during this time span for some important biological and cultural developments in the course of human evolution (Figures 1.2 and 1.3). Despite the fact that there have been claims of very early cultural or hominid fossil traces from Europe and Asia prior to 1.5 million years ago, it is our opinion that these ea A.a. 5'b. ,b H. h. e H~~... / Flgure 1.3.

(After Howell 1978.)</page><page sequence="5">THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF PROTOHUMAN CULTURE 5 claims have not been demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt, although early occupation of the Eurasian landmass is certainly a possibility. Two important reviews of Lower Paleolithic archaeology have recently been produced. The first, by Jelinek (1977), provided a global look at the Lower Paleolithic. This chapter focuses specifically upon the earliest archaeological traces, rather than the span of the entire Lower Paleolithic summarized by Jelinek, and provides a detailed look at the nature of the evidence and archae ological inference. Of course, it also includes new issues and advances in the field since the mid-1970s. More recently, Isaac (1984) has presented a summary of early Stone Age archaeology in East Africa. While this chapter deals with the same general period as that covered by Isaac's review, it considers the whole African continent in its scope and specifically addresses a wider range of topics, for example, the evidence and arguments regarding biological evolutionary trends, as well as discussions of hominid cognition and intelligence. In addition, we have provided a wide-ranging bibliography on diverse areas of inquiry con tributing to the study of the early archeological record, so that the nonspecialist will be able to refer to them as required. Nature of the Evidence The world's earliest archaeological traces usually consist of concentrations of flaked stone artifacts (the principal criterion for recognizing protohuman cultural remains) found sealed in ancient sediments, such as deposits of river channels or floodplains, lake margins, marine beaches, or cave breccias. Often fossil bones (including, rarely, those of hominids) are found in association with the stone artifacts, and sometimes traces of other organic materials such as fossil pollen, root casts, or leaf impressions are recovered as well. Various aspects of hominid behavior not demonstrably "cultural" in the ethological sense will also be con sidered in this review. Plio-Pleistocene landscapes have often changed radically over time; tectonic movements, transgressions and regressions of large bodies of water, and climatic shifts have all resculpted the earth's features. For example, most early sites in East Africa are located in stratigraphic horizons overlain by many meters of sediment. These sites were deeply buried after the time of their occupation and have subsequently been partially reexposed, normally through processes of uplift and erosion operating some hundreds of thousands or millions of years after their deposition. Historical Sketch Early investigations into the Stone Age of Africa were, in many ways, a by product of the effects of European colonialism. As new missionary posts, farms, industrial ventures, and towns spread throughout the continent, local archae</page><page sequence="6">6 NICHOLAS TOTH AND KATHY D. SCHICK ological materials were encountered and sometimes investigated. During the first part of the twentieth century, a number of pioneers in African prehistory made substantial contributions in their respective geographic areas, including Camille Arambourg and Pierre Biberson in North Africa, Louis and Mary Leakey in East Africa, J. Desmond Clark in Central Africa, and John Goodwin, Carl Van Riet Lowe, and Raymond Dart in South Africa. The focus of much of this pioneering work was to establish a cultural-histor ical sequence within a given geographic area, and to correlate this with local sequences elsewhere on the continent as well as with events in Europe and Asia. Some behavioral interpretations were made (e.g., Dart 1953), but the primary emphasis was upon documenting and describing changes observed in lithic in dustries and associated faunal assemblages through time. This large-scale en deavor was an essential first step in the archaeological investigation of the African continent. Starting around the middle of this century, studies were initiated that also sought more information about early prehistoric behavior patterns. The Leakeys' excavations at the Acheulean site of Olorgesailie in Kenya in the 1940s (Isaac 1977) mark an important turning point in field methods, since they stressed horizontal exposure of prehistoric materials in order to investigate their spatial patterns and to consider what these patterns might signify in behavioral terms. This type of excavation became a standard in subsequent research at many African Lower Paleolithic localities, such as Olduvai Gorge (Leakey 1971) and Kalambo Falls (Clark 1969). In addition, J. D. Clark's emphasis upon cultural ecology (1964) had a strong influence in fostering interest in the relationships between environment, adaptation, and material culture in African prehistory. During the 1960s and 1970s, approaches to archaeological problems began to mature by shifting from a generally inductive to a deductive approach, with the construction of testable models an essential ingredient of this new emphasis (e.g., Binford and Binford 1968; Clarke 1968, 1972; Schiffer 1976). A front runner in bringing this approach to the study of protohuman archaeology was Glynn Isaac (summarized in Isaac 1984), who helped direct a set of multi disciplinary investigations in East Africa, especially at Koobi Fora. It would appear that the number of researchers actively involved in early Stone Age studies has increased at a nearly geometric rate since 1975 and has started to involve more African nationals as well (e.g., Kaufulu 1983). Within this grow ing body of research have been some important shifts in theoretical and meth odological approaches, which are discussed below. Recent Trends Probably the most important recent trend in studies of protohuman archae ology has been a gradual shift from a cultural-historical focus based mainly upon stone-artifact typology toward empirical, behavior-oriented investigations, em</page><page sequence="7">THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF PROTOHUMAN CULTURE 7 phasizing careful examination of the hard evidence from archaeological sites. The emphasis in such research has been less upon comparisons of artifact in ventories among sites (although this is still of interest) and more upon identifying and interpreting the material patterns from selected, well-preserved sites. Along with this emphasis on the physical evidence has emerged the realization that many prehistoric patterns may be best understood in light of data generated from observing modern phenomena (e.g., actualistic studies). For protohuman archae ology, these have included experimentation, ethnoarchaeology, and animal be havior studies. Although quantitative analysis has continued to be an important part of many studies of the early archaeological record, there has been some deemphasis of these among many archaeologists. In particular, although artifact measurements and quantitative assessments of tool type frequencies are still carried out and considered valuable for purposes of assemblage comparisons, there has been a general shift or expansion of concern towards questions with more anthropologi cal or behavioral interest. Some widely held assumptions about the nature of early hominid behavior have been seriously questioned: For example, did these protohumans really live at home bases? Did they habitually share food? Did they hunt? A number of important research problems have been identified more clearly, and attempts have been made to find criteria for evaluating the likelihood of given interpreta tions from the available evidence. These research problems include 1. Reconstructions of early hominid diet: Was meat a substantial part of the diet? Do animal remains from archaeological sites attest to hominid scav enging or hunting or to some other phenomena? Upon what types of plant foods did early hominids rely? 2. Understanding the nature of archaeological sites: Do concentrations of stone tools and, sometimes, bones suggest a home base, or "central place," similar in many ways to modern hunter-gatherer camps? Do these sites document food sharing among early hominids? To what extent do geological or biological forces affect the original contextual integrity of a site? What was the duration of occupation and frequency of reoccupation? 3. Understanding the adaptive role of technology: What precipitated the de velopment of a flaked stone technology? How did early hominids make stone artifacts? What range of functions could these artifacts have served? What other materials besides stone were used as tools? Was the controlled use of fire present in the early Stone Age? 4. Understanding land-use patterns: What were the sizes of foraging ranges of these early hominids? What ecological zones were exploited? Is there evidence to demonstrate seasonal occupation? Along with these theoretical and methodological shifts has developed an en hanced realization that these questions could be best addressed using the better</page><page sequence="8">8 NICHOLAS TOTH AND KATHY D. SCHICK preserved and most carefully excavated and documented sites. Justification for digging up abraded and weathered artifacts from ancient river gravels devoid of fossil bone, for example, has become less apparent. CHRONOLOGY Establishing the order of events in prehistory is a fundamental necessity for understanding relationships between hominid evolution, cultural development, and environmental changes. To accomplish this, reliable dating methods are needed to correlate stratigraphic sequences in different geographic areas. In Africa, it is fortunate that considerable volcanic activity in the Rift Valley has formed rocks (lavas and ash falls) for which absolute radiometric age estimates can be obtained. The principal dating methods used in Plio-Pleistocene studies are the po tassium-argon technique (both conventional 40K/40Ar and the 4Ar/39 Ar step heating methods) and fission-track dating (238U decay). The radiometric dates obtained by these techniques can then be cross-checked by studying paleomag netic reversal sequences and biostratigraphy of well-known and fairly well-dated sequences, such as in the Omo basin in Ethiopia or at Olduvai Gorge in Tan zania. The techniques of amino acid racemization, thorium-uranium decay, and thermoluminescence are not discussed here, since these techniques have proved to be somewhat controversial for this period and so have not been widely used. Recently two methods of correlating strata from different geographic areas have been applied to the dating of Plio-Pleistocene sites in East Africa. One, used by researchers such as Francis Brown and Thure Cerling, is based on "chemical fingerprinting" of volcanic deposits in different areas (discussed below). Major and minor atomic elements as well as glass sherd morphology of tuffaceous horizons can be compared among volcanic deposits from diverse regions. The rationale in such comparisons is that close chemical similarity between strata implies that they have been deposited during the same geological event. A layer from a stratigraphic sequence that has been fairly securely dated by a variety of techniques can then be correlated with its chemical twin from another area that has not been so reliably fixed in time. The other correlative method involves the use of molluscan rather than mammalian fauna to make biostratigraphic correlations among areas. Williamson (1982) has argued that molluscan biostratigraphy from a continuous stratigraphic sequence at Koobi Fora, Kenya indicates that a number of field correlations of strata in different areas were incorrect and require revision. An important advance in the construction of chronological sequences over very broad geographic areas has been the correlation of mammalian fauna (es pecially pigs) between sites in East and South Africa (White and Harris 1977).</page><page sequence="9">THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF PROTOHUMAN CULTURE 9 As a result, approximate ages can be assigned to the South African cave sites for which no absolute radiometric technique has been applicable. Two major dating controversies in Plio-Pliestocene studies in East Africa have arisen since 1975, both concerned, directly or indirectly, with claims for the world's earliest stone tools. The first was the KBS Tuff controversy at Koobi Fora, Kenya. Stone artifacts had been found at the base of this tuffaceous deposit (Isaac 1976b), and hominid fossils, including a larger-brained form (KNM-ER 1470, now designated Homo habilis), were found below the tuffaceous unit. Fission-track dates by Fitch et al. (1974) for this tuff were originally argued to be approximately 2.6 m.y. old. This would have made these stone tools the oldest known in the world at the time and put the first evidence of a major hominid brain expansion more than 0.5 m.y. earlier than that from other African sites. The team of Curtis et al. (1975) then independently dated samples of this tuff and arrived at considerably younger potassium-argon ages of approximately 1.6 and 1.82 m.y. Biostratigraphic work by Brown et al. (1978), Cooke (1976), Maglio (1972), Shuey et al. (1978), and White and Harris (1977), showed that the fauna from the KBS Tuff level also suggested the younger date. Meanwhile, Hurford and Gleadow (1976) reported a fission-track date for the KBS Tuff of 2.44 m.y., corroborated by a revision in the potassium-argon date by Fitch, Hooker, and Miller (1976) to 2.42 m.y. Gleadow (1980) later revised the fission-track date of the KBS Tuff to 1.87 m.y., close to the potassium-argon dates proposed by Curtis' group. This younger age for the KBS Tuff has also been corroborated by more recent po tassium-argon dates obtained by McDougall et al. (1980) and McDougall (1981), reported as 1.89 and 1.88 m.y., respectively. In sum, the consensus for the date of the KBS Tuff has shifted from an earlier date of approximately 2.5 m.y. to a later one of about 1.9 m.y. The second controversy involved the dating of the Hadar Formation of Ethi opia, where a wealth of early australopithecine fossil material had been found (Johanson et al. 1982). Two major stratigraphic units of the Hadar Formation were dated: the Kadada Moumou Basalt (KMB), about one-third the way up from the base of the sequence, and the BKT-2 tuff near the top of the sequence. The initial dates by Aronson et al. (1977) suggested an age of 3.0 m.y. for the KMB lava. Subsequent work by Walter and Aronson (1982) revised the po tassium-argon dates for these two layers, indicating somewhat greater age for each: a shift from 3.0 to 3.65 m.y. for the KMB lava, and from 2.6 to 2.9 m.y. for the BKT-2 tuff. More recent analyses of samples of the BKT-2 tuff indicate an even greater age for this marker bed, or approximately 3.14 m.y. (Hall et al. 1985). Although the date of the KMB lava has not yet been fully resolved, it appears that the BKT-2 tuff may be approximately 3.1 m.y. old. This is critical, since correlations of this tuff to a tephra layer at the Gona archaeological sites at Hadar</page><page sequence="10">10 NICHOLAS TOTH AND KATHY D. SCHICK would imply that their stone tools, found below as well as above the correlated strata, are at least 3.1 m.y. old (this issue is discussed more fully in the section concerning early archaeological sites). While all dates assigned to Plio-Pleistocene sites should be regarded as work ing hypotheses pending further refinement, it is clear that the Plio-Pleistocene period in Africa has one of the most reliable sets of radiometric dates in the world for pre-radiocarbon times (albeit with ranges of error at specified levels of probability). By comparison, the early Paleolithic chronologies of Europe and Asia must usually be regarded as rough approximations based primarily upon correlations of faunal, geological, and climatic evidence. TERMINOLOGY AND CLASSIFICATION The Earliest Artifact Assemblages The smallest units of analysis of archaeological materials from early Stone Age sites are most often individual objects of stone and bone. Lithic materials found out of their normal geological natural context are classified either as unmodified but transported manuports or as modified artifacts. These modified stones can usually be divided into those that have been flaked and those that show other forms of modification, such as battering or pitting. Terminology and classification in paleolithic archaeology attempt to (1) create a sense of order out of these groups or assemblages of stone artifacts and (2) devise a system of artifact classification so that different assemblages can be compared through time and space. It is often hoped that artifact classes either represent stylistic norms of the toolmakers or approximate functional categories of the artifacts (or both). The most widely used classificatory system in early Stone Age studies is that proposed by Mary Leakey in her analysis of sites at Olduvai Gorge (1971). This system divides artifacts into different classes, or types, based on their overall morphology (Figures 1.4 and 1.5). Modified objects that do not necessarily exhibit deliberate flaking include hammerstones-probable percussors for flaking stone-and some spheroids. Most of the other lithic artifacts from early Paleolithic sites consist of a range of flaked forms, which can be usefully divided into cores, retouched forms, and debitage (Toth 1982). Cores are pieces of stone from which potentially service able flakes have been removed, whereas retouched forms are pieces of stone from which small, presumably unusable flakes (less than approximately 1 cm in maximum dimension) have been removed. These cores and retouched forms normally go under the rubric of tools in archaeological literature; in Leakey's system, they are divided into choppers, polyhedrons, discoids, spheroids, sub spheroids, proto-bifaces, bifaces, heavy-duty scrapers, light-duty scrapers, bur ins, awls, outils e'cailles, laterally trimmed flakes, and modified nodules and blocks.</page><page sequence="11">b~~~~~~~~~~~~ hk 0 5 10 Figure 1.4.

(After Leakey 1971.)</page><page sequence="12">12 NICHOLAS TOTH AND KATHY D. SCHICK This system has proved very useful in comparing artifacts from different archaeological sites, but it has certain drawbacks. As noted above, there is often an assumption that these "tools" were, in fact, the principal lithic forms used by early hominids and, as such, represent stylistic modes or "mental templates" (Deetz 1967) of their makers. Experimentation has suggested, however, that many of the core tool forms of the early Stone Age were probably by-products of flake production and that sharp flakes and fragments were very important tools for early hominids (Toth 1982, 1985b). An alternative way of classifying these forms is from a more strictly technological viewpoint, grouping together artifacts showing similar modes of flaking. This approach has been used by Biberson (1966) in North Africa, based on a system devised by Ramendo (1963), and by Toth for East African sites (in Bunn et al. 1980; Toth 1982). Debitage (French, "waste") can be divided into classes such as wholeflakes and a range of fragments such as splitflakes, snapped flakes, and miscellaneous angular fragments. Whole flakes can be subdivided in many ways; a simple yet very serviceable six-type flake classification for early Stone Age sites has been suggested by Toth (in Bunn et al. 1980; Toth 1982, 1985b). Leakey (1971) has a utilized category that includes stone artifacts that have been lightly flaked or battered in a way that implies use. These forms include anvils, hammerstones, cobblestones, nodules, and blocks, heavy-duty flakes, and light-duty flakes and other fragments. Since spontaneous retouch (New comer 1976), hammerstone abrasion, trampling, stream action, and diagenetic processes can also simulate forms of utilization, these terms are sometimes difficult to apply to the entire range of early Stone Age sites. Although Keeley (1980) has suggested that use wear can be microscopically distinguished from alteration by other processes, most early stone artifacts are not made of the fine grained siliceous rocks (flints, cherts, etc.) for which his methods have proven applicable. The next stage of classification is to group a set of artifacts from a horizon at a given site, often referred to as an assemblage, with similar sets of artifacts from other sites. A prime example is Leakey's classification of sites at Olduvai Gorge -'(1971) into culturalfacies, or industries. The designations for these include the following: 1. Oldowan (with relatively high proportions of choppers, discoids, and polyhedrons); 2. Developed Oldowan A (with relatively high proportions of choppers, spheroids, and battered blocks, and with new forms such as proto-bifaces and awls); 3. Developed Oldowan B (with relatively high proportions of spheroids, sub spheroids, and battered blocks, and with awls and outils ecailles); 4. Developed Oldowan C (with relatively high proportions of light-duty</page><page sequence="13">THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF PROTOHUMAN CULTURE 13 scrapers, and with awls, outils ecaills, laterally trimmed flakes, pitted anvils, and punches); 5. Acheulean (with relatively high proportions of bifaces such as hand axes, picks, and cleavers) (see Figures 1.4 and 1.5). These categories have been applied to many East African sites as well as to sites from other parts of Africa and the Middle East. Although Olduvai Gorge must be regarded as possessing the longest relatively unbroken cultural sequence yet known anywhere in the world, it should be remembered that it represents early hominid occupation in a relatively small sedimentary basin containing some rather distinctive types of raw materials which may have had a profound effect on the artifact forms produced. The variation that can be observed across time and space at Olduvai is not precisely paralleled in other parts of Africa, and so its artifact assemblages should not necessarily be used as the cultural yardstick by which to measure all other sites. The Nature of Technological Changes Because of the wide variety of early Stone Age technologies observed in Africa, it is difficult to make generalizations about technological changes through time across the entire continent. Much of this observed variation is probably due to the types of raw material available, as well as to other possible factors such as technological norms and functional requirements. The superb chronological sequence at Olduvai Gorge permits the most detailed analysis of technological changes in the early Pleistocene (Leakey 1971), although, as just mentioned, different sequences may well be expected in other sedimentary basins. Sites from Bed I at Olduvai (between approximately 1.7 and 1.8 m.y. old) are characterized by assemblages of lava cores (especially choppers and poly hedrons) with relatively high proportions of quartz and quartzite debitage and retouched flakes. Leakey characterizes these assemblages as Oldowan. In Lower Bed II and lower Middle Bed II sites (from 1.7 to 1.4 m.y. old), new elements can be detected: quartz or quartzite becomes the predominant type of raw material of cores as well as of debitage and retouched pieces, and artifact forms such as spheroids or subspheroids and modified battered nodules and blocks become common. There appears to be a significant correlation between the use of this raw material (quartz or quartzite) at Olduvai and the appearance of these battered forms; whether the majority of these battered pieces represent well-curated hammerstones, food processors, bolas stones (Leakey 1971), or other functional forms remains to be demonstrated. Leakey (1971) assigns these assemblages to Developed Oldowan A. In Upper Middle Bed II and Upper Bed II (estimated to be about 1.6 to 1.4</page><page sequence="14">14 NICHOLAS TOTH AND KATHY D. SCHICK m.y. old), smaller retouched tools become more common, and a significant new element can be seen at some of these sites: bifacial or (less commonly) unifacial forms (picks, hand axes, cleavers) made on large flake blanks. Assemblages with a low proportion of bifaces are assigned by Leakey (1971) to Developed Oldo wan B, while those with a high proportion of bifacial forms are designated as early Acheulean. The advent of large bifacial forms in Upper Middle Bed II is a technological trend documented at approximately the same time (ca 1.5-1.4 m.y.a.) at Peninj, on the west side of Lake Natron in Tanzania (Isaac 1965, 1967a). These types of artifacts are the hallmark of Mode II (Clark, 1971), or Acheulean, technologies that become widespread by the Middle Pleistocene in much of Africa, Europe and the Near East, as well as in parts of India. It is not possible at present to generalize about the functional significance of these artifact forms, but experi mentation has demonstrated that many of them are excellent tools for animal butchery (Jones 1980; Toth 1982, 1985b). Toth (1982) has suggested that these forms were designed for heavy-duty butchery of larger mammals-the overall size of the tool designed to provide a comfortable grip prior to the development of hafting devices. Whether the technological trend toward large bifacial forms represents a major behavioral and adaptive shift in prehistory or is simply a new element of the same general hominid pattern cannot at present be determined. Leakey (1971) has pointed out that these tool forms and early Homo erectus appear at roughly the same time in East Africa (in later Bed II times at Olduvai), perhaps indicating an advanced hominid grade with new technological elements. We would agree with Isaac (1984) that it is perhaps best at this time to group all early archaeological sites prior to Acheulean biface technology into the Oldowan Industrial complex, or Mode I, stage of technology (Clark 1971). This classification system groups assemblages within a gross technological stage without implying any necessary cultural, chronological, or cognitive connec tions. The tools included in this industrial designation do not have a strictly chronological or cultural-historical significance, since Mode I technology also appears at later sites contemporaneous with Acheulean and even more advanced technologies. Site Typologies Other approaches to classifying early Stone Age sites have included Leakey's (1971) suggestion that Olduvai sites can be divided into: (1) living floors, (2) butchery or kill sites, (3) sites with diffused material, and (4) river or stream channel sites. Binford (1981) has pointed out that this system includes both behavioral and geological criteria. Isaac has proposed a classification scheme that organizes sites into categories based upon aspects of their contents and their</page><page sequence="15">THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF PROTOHUMAN CULTURE 15 context. These categories are Type A sites, having a concentration of artifacts without bone; Type B sites, having stone artifacts associated with bones of a single large animal; Type C sites, having associated artifacts and bones of nu merous animals; Type D sites, having vertically dispersed artifacts with or with out bones; Type G sites, having materials transported and redeposited in geo logical context; Type 0 sites, having only faunal materials with no definitive artifactual evidence; and Type M sites, having a concentration of bone with marks from stone tools, but no associated stone artifacts (Isaac 1984; Isaac and Crader 1981). This system stresses descriptive rather than interpretive criteria for developing an initial classification of sites. These systems of classifying Plio-Pleistocene prehistoric occurrences have not used purely behavioral criteria because of the pitfalls in making inferences that go far beyond the evidence at hand. For instance, certainly some of these early archaeological sites are devoid of bone simply because conditions or preservation were so poor that any bone present was destroyed before fossilization; other sites have been reworked by geological forces so that much of the behavioral integrity which originally existed has been lost. For this reason, such classificatory sys tems have limited usefulness; until clear behavioral differences between Plio Pleistocene sites can be demonstrated, it will be difficult to devise more inno vative schemes for meaningful site classifications. THE EVOLUTIONARY RECORD Fossil Hominids in the Plio-Pleistocene Since 1970, the number of new fossil hominid discoveries from the Pliocene and early Pleistocene has increased dramatically. With this larger sample of individuals from relatively well-dated sediments, a clearer picture is emerging of probable phylogenetic relationships among early hominid forms. Recent discoveries at Hadar, Ethiopia (Johanson and White 1979; Johanson et al. 1982), Laetoli, Tanzania (Leakey et al. 1976), and the Middle Awash Valley, Ethiopia (Clark et al. 1984) have demonstrated the existence of small-brained, bipedal hominids between approximately 4.0 and 3.0 m.y.a. No stone artifacts are known from this period, although reconnaissance and survey of sediments in these localities was directed toward the identification of both fossils and artifacts. These primitive hominids at Hadar have been designated Australopithecus afarensis (Johanson et al. 1978). Johanson and White (1979) argue that the individuals found during this period represent a sexually dimorphic species an cestral to all subsequent hominids-one descendant lineage leading to the larger brained genus Homo and another leading to the later australopithecines (first A. africanus and then A. boisei and A. robustus in East and South Africa, respec</page><page sequence="16">16 NICHOLAS TOTH AND KATHY D. SCHICK tively). This model has met with some opposition. For example, Tobias (1980) has argued that the fossil materials assigned to A. afarensis are, in fact, simply an East African variant of A. africanus, the latter known from cave deposits in South Africa. Others, including Leakey (1981), argue that two lineages are represented by these early hominid fossils-smaller australopithecines and larger representatives of the genus Homo. Between 3.0 and 2.0 m.y.a. new hominid forms appear in the fossil record, and it is during this period that the earliest stone artifacts have been recognized. In South Africa the sites of Taung, Sterkfontein, and Makapansgat have yielded fossils that have been assigned to Australopithecus africanus (Howell 1982). In East Africa the fossil evidence from this period comes primarily from the Omo Valley of Ethiopia (Howell 1982). The earlier fossils here bear morphological similarities to A. africanus (Howell 1982), and, at the base of the sequence, perhaps to A. afarensis (Howell, personal communication 1985). Later in the Omo sequence, by about 2.4 million years ago, robust australopithecines (desig nated A. boisei) appear and soon replace fossils attributed to A. africanus here. The earliest of these are from Member E of the Shungura Formation (Howell and Coppens 1976), which has recently been redated to approximately 2.4 m.y.a. (F. Brown, personal communication, 1985). The first larger-brained hominids begin to appear in the fossil record elsewhere about 2 m.y.a., for example below the KBS Tuff at Koobi Fora (Howell 1982). These specimens have been attributed to the species Homo habilis. It is unfortunate that the time interval between 3 and 2 m.y.a. is so poorly known in East Africa, since it would appear that this period documents both the emergence of Australopithecus boisei and Homo habilis, as well as the first securely dated stone implements. Between approximately 2.0 and 1.0 m.y.a., the robust australopithecine form continues in East Africa and another is also seen in South Africa at sites such as Swartkrans and Kromdraai (Howell 1982). The South African forms have been designated Australopithecus robustus (sometimes called A. crassidens). In East Africa there also appears a new, larger-brained form of hominid, Homo erectus, which is first seen about 1.5 m.y.a. at Koobi Fora, Kenya and at Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania (Howell 1982). At present there is no direct association of stone tools from sedimentary layers that have yielded earlier australopithecines; this may be an important negative correlation, suggesting that a flaked stone technology was not a habitual trait of these protohumans. Even in the cave breccias of Makapansgat and Sterkfontein, where numerous fossils of A. africanus have been discovered, no definite stone artifacts have been found. The first stratigraphic associations of stone tools with hominids include the forms A. boisei and H. habilis in East Africa and A. robustus and Homo sp. in southern Africa (see Figure 1.3). It is generally assumed that the larger-brained, Homo form was the major toolmaker, although the direct association of stone artifacts with fossils designated as robust aus</page><page sequence="17">THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF PROTOHUMAN CULTURE 17 tralopithecines, as well as some attributed to Homo habilis at FLK Zinj (Leakey 1971) and with a robust australopithecine at Site FxJj 20E at Koobi Fora (Harris 1978; Isaac and Harris 1978), warrants further investigation. Ideas about the course of hominid evolution often change radically as fossil samples are enlarged and dating techniques used to establish chronology are refined. It is likely that the scheme presented here will be modified in the future as more fossil hominids and early archaeological sites are found and chro nometric techniques further refined. Evolutionary Dynamics and Hominid Adaptations One very important outcome of hominid paleontological research done during the 1970s has been further documentation of the chronological disjunction be tween the evolution of bipedal locomotion and the expansion of the hominid brain. The set of musculoskeletal changes allowing fully efficient bipedality is now known to have been present between 3 and 4 million years ago in small brained hominids found at Hadar and Laetoli. Furthermore, these small-brained bipeds exhibit many ape-like features in their cranial and postcranial anatomy (Johanson and White 1979). The first solid evidence for expansion and possible reorganization of the brain exemplary of the human line appears nearly 2 million years later in fossils attributed to the genus Homo. This evidence of the temporal separation in the emergence of these two important traits in human evolutionary development was, of course, foreshadowed by previous recognition that the first large-brained hominids were contemporary with relatively small-brained, yet bipedal, australopithecines. The new fossil evidence adds a greater sense of time depth and sequence to the evolutionary development of these traits. It further highlights the importance of bipedality within the entire hominid line rather than just among the larger brained forms, which appear to be relatively recent phenomena in hominid evolution. Studies by Holloway (1983), however, suggest that important changes in brain organization might have preceded brain size increase. He argues that cerebral brain endocast patterns of early A. afarensis indicate that, despite its relatively small, ape-size brain, significant reorganization may have occurred by this time involving an increase in the size of association areas in the parietal cerebral cortex. Thus, we might not be able to preclude some selection for increased intelligence prior to 2 m.y.a. and preceding the brain expansion seen later in the hominid line. Both the osteological evidence provided by the 3 to 4 million year old Hadar hominids, particularly in features of the pelvis and femur (Lovejoy 1982), and the fossil footprints discovered in 3.7 million year old sediments at Laetoli (Leakey and Hay 1979), then, document that by this time the hominid line had</page><page sequence="18">18 NICHOLAS TOTH AND KATHY D. SCHICK undergone some major evolutionary changes that adapted them to locomotion on two feet. Whether they also conducted many activities in the trees, retaining some form of arboreal locomotion as well, has been a subject of some controver sy. Some researchers (e.g., Lovejoy 1982) maintain that the overall anatomical configuration of the earliest bipeds, including that of the lower and upper limbs and of the pelvis, indicates an animal well adapted to walking bipedally but poorly adapted to aboreal climbing. Others have stressed that some of the fea tures of these hominids indicate a significant use of the trees through arboreal locomotion (e.g., Stern and Susman 1983; Susman et al. 1984; Tuttle 1981), since some other features, particularly of the lower limbs, indicate possible differences from modern human bipedal gait (Stem and Susman 1983). Such traits as relatively long, curved phalanges and a number of features of articular surfaces and muscles of the arms and legs have been advanced as evidence of a significant use of the hands and feet in arboreal climbing. As of yet, no definitive criteria have been established to resolve the debate over whether some admittedly primitive features of the limbs of the early bipedal hominids are merely vestigial "baggage" retained from a fairly recent arboreal ancestor or whether they truly indicate locomotor function. It would appear that osteological evidence that could reliably indicate the plastic response of bone (rather than just its genetic make-up) to stress during the life of the individual might help settle this issue. Another long-standing evolutionary view-that the abrupt expansion of the hominid brain is contemporaneous with and linked to the prominent manufacture and use of stone artifacts (e.g., Oakley 1961)-has not yet been completely overturned. Thus, from the web of what had been thought to be associated, co occurring evolutionary developments (i.e., bipedal locomotion, brain expansion, and some dependence upon stone tools), the latter two could yet prove to be relatively synchronous and possibly related features. The development of stone tool cultures recognizable in the archaeological record and the enlargement of the hominid brain both substantially postdate the bipedal adaptation and, from the evidence so far available, may not be far separated in time. Although there are a few candidates for sites predating the appearance of fossils attributed to the genus Homo, as discussed later, this evidence is so far somewhat equivocal. And it may well be that larger-brained hominids had emerged by the late Pliocene, between 2 and 3 million years ago, but are as yet undiscovered or undetected. Nevertheless, from the evidence so far available, the development of a fairly prominent, widespread archaeological record, with stone artifacts of deliberate manufacture deposited in unprecedented and conspicuous concentrations and in larger num bers, begins to appear at approximately the same time as the earliest representa tives of the genus Homo, or approximately 2 million years ago. As is discussed later in this chapter, the significant expansion and reorganiza tion of the hominid brain appear to be distinctive of the emergence of the genus</page><page sequence="19">THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF PROTOHUMAN CULTURE 19 Homo. Although archaeological sites document manufacture and use of stone artifacts, it cannot be ignored that consistent use of non-stone materials may have accompanied or even predated the use of lithic materials. In fact, it would seem probable that the achievement of bipedal locomotion may well have evolved due to a strong selective advantage of some important use of the hands or forelimbs, since it does free the hands for structural changes and manipulative roles both during and outside of locomotion itself. Such roles could have included some dexterous use of the hands in feeding, in tool use or manufacture (though with little or no archaeological visibility), or possibly in offensive or defensive throwing. Alternatively, a critical factor in a bipedal adaptation may have been transport of some materials critical for overall evolutionary success. The possible impor tance of carrying in human evolution, particularly the transport of foodstuffs, has long been emphasized by a number of researchers (e.g., Isaac 1978a,b; Lan caster 1978; Lovejoy 1981). In one evolutionary scenario, carrying has been proposed as a crucial factor in the very divergence of the hominid and pongid lines and in the evolutionary development of bipedal locomotion itself (Lovejoy 1980). In this provocative model, for which, however, little supportive data have yet been advanced, provisioning behavior by males carrying foodstuffs to their respective, more centrally located mates and offspring gave the emerging homi nids a powerful selective advantage over their quadrupedal ape relatives. No evidence has yet been provided that would help decide between these two models (carrying or manipulation) for the evolution of bipedal locomotion in the hominid line, if either of these is, indeed, the critical variable. The fossil evidence for dietary adaptations, to be discussed more fully later in this chapter, suggests a strong niche divergence between the hominid lines which coexisted between 1 and 2 million years ago. The more robust australopithecines contemporary with early forms of Homo have relatively massive jaws and mas ticatory muscles and extremely large grinding molars, features thought to indi cate a diet consisting of relatively coarse, hard, nutrient-poor foodstuffs (e.g., Grine 1981, 1984; Milton 1986; Robinson 1963). The larger-brained forms, with much less robust chewing muscles and usually smaller cheek teeth, would appear to have had a diet that did not emphasize such hard foods. A possibly significant factor in the emergence of the genus Homo may have been an adaptation involv ing the inclusion of greater quantities of meat in the diet, possibly through hunting (particularly of smaller animals) or through scavenging (particularly of larger prey; see the section "Diet" later in this chapter). Perhaps significantly, evidence for the use of stone tools on animal carcasses (cut marks on bones and microwear polishes on artifacts) is found in the early phases of the archaeological record, at approximately the same time as the emergence of the larger-brained hominids.</page><page sequence="20">20 NICHOLAS TOTH AND KATHY D. SCHICK THE EARLIEST ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES Claims for the world's earliest archaeological sites have lately been pushed back in time. The evidence, at present, is based on three important criteria: (1) objects that show deliberate modification by protohumans-these are usually flaked stone tools but potentially could include modified bones as well; (2) well dated sediments, ideally using independent dating techniques to cross-check for reliability; and (3) definite contextual association that relates the artifacts to their sedimentary context; that is, these artifacts must be found sealed within dated sediments. Claims from the Miocene Two dubious claims have been made for stone artifacts from Miocene con texts. The fist was from Leakey (1968), who argued that Kenyapithecus wickeri (now designated as a form of Ramapithecus) was associated with broken bones and a battered lava cobble at Fort Ternan, Kenya (ca 15 m.y.a.). Based on this association, Leakey concluded that this creature was a stone-tool-using, om nivorous primate who had broken bones for marrow. The other claim was made subsequently by Prasad (1982), who described an allegedly flaked quartzite peb ble, said to be found eroding out of late Miocene sediments (ca 9 m.y.a.) from the Siwaliks in India; ramapithecines have been discovered in contemporaneous deposits. These claims rest upon the purported artifactual nature of the objects de scribed, and in the latter case, the supposition that the quartzite cobble was, in fact, definitely from the early sediments. Since both cases are ambiguous, these claims should be regarded as unproven, pending further investigation. Makapansgat, South Africa: Claims for Early Tools Dart had previously developed the hypothesis, based upon broken faunal remains at Makapansgat, that gracile austalopithecines in South Africa had developed a tool tradition, labeled the "osteodontokeratic" culture (Dart 1957), using bone, tooth, and horn as raw materials. In the light of subsequent paleon tological and naturalistic studies, Brain (1981) has suggested that the breakage patterns of at least the majority of bones from the early members of the cave sites in Africa bearing A. africanus do not show definite signs of modification by hominids. Rather, the bone assemblages examined appear, in their composition and state of fracture, very much like those expected in faunal accumulations which have suffered quite a bit of destruction and carnivore damage (Brain 1981). Maguire (1965) reported that a large number of geologically foreign stones were found in old mining dumps at the Makapansgat Limeworks in southem</page><page sequence="21">THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF PROTOHUMAN CULTURE 21 Africa. He argued that pitting observed on these stones, which were principally of quartzite and sandstone, was evidence of very repetitive and localized percus sion, and that these stones had been transported to the cave and used there for pounding activities by australopithecines. This argument ultimately rests upon the original provenience of these pieces (as they were retrieved from excavation dumps), and upon whether they represent actual artifacts. While these stones are intriguing, further geological and archeological research would be necessary in order to establish the context, antiquity, and artifactual nature of the specimens. The Gona Sites, Hadar, Ethiopia Claims have been made for very early stone tools from the Pliocene deposit of the Hadar region of the Afar Triangle. Simple lava cores and debitage have been recovered in situ from two contexts that are provisionally dated as well over 2 million years old. At the site of Kada Gona 2-3-4 (East Gona), Roche and Tiercelin found flaked lava artifacts within two high-energy conglomerates, the older of which is stratigraphically below the AST-2 tephra horizon (Corvinus 1975, 1976; Corvinus and Roche 1976, 1980; Harris 1983; Roche and Tiercelin 1977, 1980). The AST-2 tephra horizon has been correlated stratigraphically to the BKT-2 tuff in the Ounda Hadar region (Taieb et al. 1978; Walter 1980). The BKT-2 tuff, first dated at approximately 2.6 m.y. by the potassium-argon and fission-track methods (Aronson et al. 1977), was later revised to approximately 2.9 m.y. (Walter and Aronson 1982) and has been potassium-argon dated in more recent studies to approximately 3.14 m.y. (Hall et al. 1985). Therefore, the stone artifacts from the lower conglomerate at Gona East could be over 3.14 m.y. old, if the new date for this tuff and, importantly, its correlation with the AST-2 tephra overlying the site are ultimately corroborated. This tephra, though chemically quite similar to the BKT-2 tuff, is not identical to it, and although the field correlation of the two strata appears to be reasonably sound, further re search will be necessary for final corroboration (Walter, personal communication 1985). The West Gona site, excavated by Harris (1983), has been provisionally correlated to the East Gona areas as lying just above the AST-2 tephra horizon. Again, if this stratigraphic correlation and the tuff date hold, this site would be younger than 3.1 m.y. old. It would, however, still lack a minimum age estimate unless a datable overlying horizon could be found. At this site lava artifacts (one chopper core and the rest debitage) and bone fragments were excavated from a fine-grained silt deposit. Each of these claims for very early archaeological sites in the Hadar depend upon the artifactual nature of the stone (which appears certain), the geological correlations from one area to another, and the reliability of the radiometric dates. As Isaac (1984) points out, the early age of these artifacts may well be correct, but more geological fieldwork in this region will be necessary for final cor</page><page sequence="22">22 NICHOLAS TOTH AND KATHY D. SCHICK roboration. Perhaps in light of the KBS Tuff controversy of the mid-1970s, in which initial claims for very early dates for sites in that stratigraphic level were proven false by more thorough research, it would seem wise to err on the side of caution. There are a number of archaeological occurrences in different African lo calities that appear to be in the time range of 2.5-1.5 m.y.a. Some of these, especially in East Africa, are from sediments that have been dated by radiometric means, while others, as in North and South Africa, depend upon faunal and geological correlations for claims for Plio-Pleistocene age. A brief summary of the early sites and their evidence in East, North, and South Africa is presented below. The Omo Valley, Ethiopia Archaeological sites have been discovered in sediments of Member F in the Omo Valley, Ethiopia. Among these sites are those excavated by Chavaillon, including Omo 57 and Omo 123 (Chavaillon 1970, 1976, 1980b; Chavaillon and Boisaubert 1977), and by Merrick, including Sites FtJi2 and FtJil (Merrick 1976; Merrick and Merrick 1976; Merrick et al. 1973). Omo Tuff F, which underlies the sites, yielded an average potassium-argon age of 2.04 m.y., and Tuff G, which overlies the sites, had been dated to approximately 1.93 m.y.a. (Brown and Lajoie 1971). Thus, the archaeological sites from Member F were originally estimated to be approximately 2.0 m.y. in age. More recently, F. Brown (per sonal communication, 1985; Brown et al. 1985) has redated Omo Tuff F to approximately 2.4 m.y., suggesting that the archaeological sites from Member F could be closer to this date, or up to 400,000 years older than originally thought. At these sites, most artifacts consist of small angular fragments of smashed quartz pebbles; more rarely are artifacts in lava, chert, or chalcedony. The principal raw-material sources during Member F times may have been 20-30 km away from the sites; the nearest source of any such rocks appears to have been within some small channels several kilometers to the east of the sites (Merrick 1976). The lack of standardization of these artifacts, as well as their small size, may well be due primarily to the paucity of raw material within the region, with primarily small quartz pebbles available for flaking (Merrick 1976). Chavaillon and Boisaubert (1977) and de Heinzelin (1983) have also reported artifacts at Omo Site 84 from Member E deposits below Tuff F. If the geological field correlations are correct, and the new radiometric dates indeed prove Tuff F to be 2.4 m.y. old, this site could be approximately 2.5 m.y. in age. Again, further fieldwork and a larger sample of radiometric dates should resolve this uncertainty. If the stone artifact assemblages from Gona and the Omo are truly at least 2.5 m.y. old, it will be quite interesting to see what hominid forms will be documented in this time range through further fileldwork.</page><page sequence="23">THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF PROTOHUMAN CULTURE 23 Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania The longest cultural sequence in the world has been recorded from the famous locality of Olduvai Gorge in northern Tanzania. Diligent work by Louis and Mary Leakey as well as other researchers has recovered the physical and cultural remains of hominids ranging in age from just under 2 million years to the Holocene. Early sites from Beds I and II include DK, FLK NN, FLK Zinj, FLK North (Levels 1-6, Deinotherium level, and Sandy Conglomerate level), HWK East (Levels 1 and 2, Sandy Conglomerate, and Levels 3-5), MNK Skull site, EF-HR, MNK Main, FC West, FC, SHK, TK, and BK. All of these sites formed in a sedimentary lake basin in either lake margin or stream contexts. The principal raw materials for artifacts were lavas and quartz or quartzite, with cherts being available locally in Bed II times (see Hay 1976a, 1976b; Leakey 1951; Leakey 1971, 1975, 1976). A number of researchers have conducted various analytical studies of the Olduvai materials in recent years, for example those of Stiles (1983; Stiles et al. 1974), Bunn (1981, 1982b, 1983b), Potts (1982, 1984a), and Potts and Shipman (1981). These sites are located in sediments within the prehistoric lake basin at Olduvai. They generally contain some hundreds or thousands of stone artifacts (cores or core tools and debitage) as well as some dozens or hundreds of un modified stone manuports. In many instances here, the artifacts are distinctly anomalous clasts within their fine-grained floodplain settings. Most of these sites also contain hundreds or thousands of faunal bone specimens, sometimes whole but usually broken or fragmented (Leakey 1971: 261). Sometimes these materials are found in concentrations that are somewhat diffuse vertically, although they are contained within a delimited horizontal area. In other cases, distinct vertical concentrations or artifacts have been discovered; these have usually been inferred to represent specific occupation surfaces (to be discussed further later) (Leakey 1971). Koobi Fora, Kenya Archaeological research directed by Glynn Isaac and J. W. K. Harris at Koobi Fora has recovered a wealth of early archaeological sites ranging in age from approximately 1.9 to 1.5 million years. Artifacts, primarily of lava, have been found in stream channel, stream floodplain, delta, and lake margin contexts. Excavated sites at Koobi Fora include FxJj 1, 3, and 10 in the Lower Member (ca 1.9 m.y.a.) and FxJj 11, 16, 17, 181HS, 18GSL, 18GSU, 18NS, 20M, 20E, 20S, 20AB, 23, 33, 37, 38, 50, and 64 in the Upper Member (ca 1.5 m.y.a.); a single site, FwJi 1, has been excavated at nearby Ileret. On site, GaJi 5, though lacking stone artifacts, was identified by the presence of cut marks on bones collected from the surface, presumably induced by stone tools (Bunn 1982b).</page><page sequence="24">24 NICHOLAS TOTH AND KATHY D. SCHICK The Koobi Fora archaeological project has promoted an integrated set of studies into aspects of early hominid behavior and adaptation, with diverse lines of investigation being followed by a number of researchers (Bunn 1981, 1982b, 1983b; Bunn et al. 1980; Harris 1978; Harris and Isaac 1976; Isaac 1976a, 1976b, 1978a, 1978b; Isaac and Harris 1978; Isaac et al. 1976; Isaac et al. 1971; Kaufulu 1983; Keeley and Toth 1981; Kroll, n.d.; Kroll and Isaac 1984; Schick 1984; Sept 1984; Toth 1982, 1985b; Vincent 1985). Chesowanja, Kenya Based on investigations by Gowlett and J. W. K. Harris, two localities from the Chemoigut Formation at Chesowanja, Kenya have yielded in situ stone artifact concentrations with some fossil bone at Sites GnJi 1 and 2. The artifacts are predominantly in lava and consist mostly of flakes and flake fragments with some simple Oldowan core and core tool forms. One site has yielded hard red clay fragments which may indicate a fire of unknown origin. Based on radi ometric dates of approximately 1.4 m.y. for an overlying lava, these sites have been assigned an age of approximately 1.5 m.y. (Gowlett et al. 1981; Harris and Bishop 1976; Harris and Gowlett 1980). Melka Kuntur6, Ethiopia Chavaillon has described a number of excavated occurrences at Melka Kun turd, Ethiopia, which may be approximately 1.5 m.y. old. These include Sites Gombore I B, with over 10,000 artifacts (Oldowan core forms and some flakes), and Garba IV C and D, with similarly large quantities of artifacts but including greater proportions of retouched pieces. Lava and obsidian are the most common raw materials. (Chavaillon 1971, 1980a; Chavaillon and Chavaillon 1976; Chavaillon et al. 1979). Gadeb, Ethiopia Clark and Kurashina (1976, 1979; Clark 1977) have excavated a number of Plio-Pleistocene sites on the Plain of Gadeb in the highlands of Ethiopia. Gadeb Sites 2B, 2C, and 2E have been described as Developed Oldowan occurrences, consisting primarily of flaked lava cobbles. Potassium-argon dates and paleo magnetic studies bracket the artifact-bearing sediments between approximately 1.5 and 0.7 m.y.a., and Clark has suggested the date of the earlier assemblages from the sites to be about 1.5 m.y.a. Peninj, Lake Natron, Tanzania Two excavated assemblages of early Pleistocene artifacts were found in stream channel contexts near the Peninj River on the western side of Lake Natron in northern Tanzania and dated to approximately 1.5 m.y.a. (Isaac 1967a). These sites, MHS and RHS, are characterized by large unifacial and bifacial forms</page><page sequence="25">THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF PROTOHUMAN CULTURE 25 made on large lava flakes. These artifacts are characteristic of early Acheulean technology, as also seen at the site of EF-HR in Bed II of Olduvai Gorge, which is roughly contemporaneous with the Peninj occurrences. By this time, then, about 1.5 million years ago, we are seeing at these East African sites the emergence of new stone technologies (Mode II), which were discussed earlier. Northern Africa The coast of Morocco has yielded one of the longest and best-studied se quences of early Stone Age artifacts in North Africa (Biberson 1961, 1966, 1967). Although relative chronologies have been established here based pri marily on geological criteria, absolute dates have not been derived for these occurrences. However, the galet amenage ("pebble tool") industries are pre sumed to be about the same age as early East African sites (Isaac 1982a). The best known early Stone Age site in the sequence is the STIC Quarry at Sidi Abderrahman near Casablanca (Biberson 1961). In Tunisia, a lithic industry characterized by battered spheroids and cobble cores was found at Ain Hanech, associated with a Villafranchian (early Pleistocene) fauna (Biberson 1961). These sites are believed to be well over 1 million years old. South Africa Two of the australopithecine-bearing limestone caves in South Africa have yielded breccias with stone tools in them. At Sterkfontein, in Member 5, stone artifacts and bones have been recovered from a calcified sedimentary infill of a solution cavern (Leakey 1970; Mason 1962; Robinson 1962). Bones within the Member 5 breccia include approximately 1200 specimens from at least 41 indi viduals of macrovertebrate species, predominantly artiodactyls (Brain 1981:213 218). The 284 stone artifacts extracted from the breccia consist primarily of core forms. Most of these have been classified by Mason (1962) as cores but by Leakey (1970) as core tools, in view of what she considered evidence of utiliza tion in chipped or blunted edges. Most of these are typical Oldowan tech nological forms but also include some pieces with bifacial flaking. At Swartkrans a small number of stone artifacts have been recovered from breccia deposits in the Outer Cave (Brain 1970, 1981; Leakey 1970), although the exact stratigraphic provenience here has been somewhat difficult to decipher. Since the artifacts had been extracted from a deposit subsequently shown to have two distinct components, and most of the adhering matrix had previously been removed from them, their assignment to a specific stratigraphic horizon has been problematic (Brain 1981:227-228). Only one artifact, a quartzite flake, shows conclusive evidence of derivation from the earliest (Member 1) breccia, from which fossils of both the robust australopithecine and Homo forms of hominid have been recovered; the abraded condition of this flake would indicate considerable fluvial transport before its</page><page sequence="26">26 4ICHOLAS TOTH AND KATHY D. SCHICK inclusion in the cave deposit (Brain 1981:227, 238). Six other artifacts show possible but inconclusive evidence of derivation from the earlier Member 1 (Brain 1981:228). Twenty-five artifacts have been assigned to the Member 2 breccia on the basis of adhering matrix, but it is not known whether these had been scattered through out the deposit or located within a distinct horizon (Brain 1981:245). These are predominantly core forms of Oldowan technology (particularly choppers) but also include a few crude bifaces, a cleaver, a heavy-duty pick, and some flakes. Most of these are made of quartzite cobbles; rarer raw materials are diabase, chert, and quartz (Leakey 1970). The faunal remains from Member 2 include one Homo specimen, but no australopithecines, and large numbers of antelope, in contrast to the contents of the Member 1 deposit, which yielded large numbers of cercopithecoids and robust australopithecines in addition to the other fauna (Brain 1981:237, 244). STUDIES OF EARLY TECHNOLOGY Humankind's ability to modify elements of its environment into a range of usable tools was undoubtedly one of the principal behavioral traits that contrib uted to the success of the genus Homo during the Pleistocene. To fully under stand how this story unfolded, one should start with the earliest evidence of technology. In view of the increasing number of reports on the technology of the modem chimpanzee (Boesch and Boesch 1981, 1984; Goodall 1971; McBeath and McGrew 1982; Nishida and Hiraiwa 1982; Sugiyama and Koman 1979), it seems likely that before the advent of a flaked stone technology, hominids used unmodified or minimally modified objects as tools. Such primitive implements, with the exception of heavily battered or pitted stones, would probably be hard to identify in the prehistoric record. The principal types of artifacts identified in the early prehistoric record, then, are flaked and battered stones. Whether stone was the principal raw material for tools is not known, but considering the diverse materials used by chimpanzees, we think it likely that a range of materials other than stone was likely to have been used by the early bipedal hominids. Obvious types of materials available for use would include bone, tusk, horn, shell, hide, wood, bark, leaves, thorns, grass, and mud. Most of these, unfortunately, would be expected to have little or no visibility in ordinary archaeological circumstances after the passage of more than a million years. Experimental Studies of Stone Artifact Manufacture and Use Since it is presumed that neither modern hunter-gatherers nor other primates now occupy technological or adaptive niches similar to those of Plio-Pleistocene</page><page sequence="27">THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF PROTOHUMAN CULTURE 27 hominids, experimentation has been an important avenue of inquiry into the nature and the role of early stone technology. Pioneering work by prehistorians such as L. Leakey and J. D. Clark paved the way for more detailed studies of recent years. Jones (1979, 1980, 1981), working at Olduvai Gorge, has conducted an ex perimental program of stone tool manufacture and use, concentrating on Acheulean technology. Based on the geological work of Hay (1971, 1976a, 1976b), the major sources of rock types used by hominids for artifacts have been identified in the ancient sedimentary basin at Olduvai. In one study, Jones (1979) argued that the type of raw material used (rock type, blank form) had a profound effect on hand-ax morphology, and that conventional assessments of artifact refinement must be reexamined in light of raw materials utilized. This view partially corroborated that of Stiles (1979), who argued that the poorly made hand axes of the Developed Oldowan B were a function of using quartz rather than lava for tools. Clark (1980) has also stressed the effect raw material could have upon resultant artifact form. Jones (1980) has conducted other experiments in animal butchery with replicated stone tools, emphasizing the effectiveness of large bifacial forms for butchery-related activities. In his work at Koobi Fora, Toth (1982, 1985b) emphasized a holistic approach to lithic technology which considered raw-material acquisition and transport as well as artifact manufacture, use, and discard. A long-term experimental pro gram was conducted to study artifact manufacture. An important element of this work was to examine the relationships between cores and flakes at archaeological sites to determine whether certain stages of core reduction are preferentially represented by the flakes (e.g., the early stages of flaking a core or the continued flaking of a previously reduced core) or whether all stages of core reduction are represented in expected proportions. Predictions as to what sorts of flake popula tions are produced at various stages of core reduction were based on experimen tal artifact manufacture. This approach is somewhat analogous to studies of element composition in faunal studies. Among the conclusions of this study were the following: 1. Many of the supposed "core tools" of the early Stone Age are simply the by-product of flake production and do not really represent stylistic norms or mental templates of early hominids. Much of the variability in early Stone Age industries could be due largely to variation in raw-material type, size, and shape and in the extent of flaking or core reduction. 2. Flakes were an integral part of early hominid tool-kits, especially for activities involving cutting (Keeley and Toth 1981; Toth 1982, 1985b; Toth and Schick 1983). 3. There is clear evidence that early hominids curated (sensu Binford 1979) and transported raw materials from place to place. Artifacts are sometimes found several kilometers from their nearest source (Harris 1978; Isaac 1976b), and at</page><page sequence="28">28 NICHOLAS TOTH AND KATHY D. SCHICK most sites later stages of flaking are preferentially represented, arguing for cura tion and transport of previously flaked cores (Toth 1982, 1985b). The second part of this investigation entailed the use of experimentally made stone artifacts for a range of tasks, and the assessment of the relative efficiency of diverse artifact forms. Activities such as butchery of animals (from goat to elephant size), bone breaking, hide working, and woodworking were performed with a variety of artifact forms. The overall utility of flakes and retouched flakes for cutting activities was one important finding of this research. In addition to these studies, Willoughby (1985a; 1985b) investigated the forms and functions of spheroids and subspheroids from Paleolithic sites. These artifact types are found in large numbers in Bed II at Olduvai Gorge and at some other early sites but are virtually absent from sites at Koobi Fora. Based on the results of her study, she suggests that spheroids may have been used as hammers for plant food processing, perhaps in association with stone anvils. These conclu sions appear to rely primarily upon ethnographic analogy for the inferred function. Studies of Refitted Pieces Conjoining lithic materials from prehistoric sites can be very informative, as has been demonstrated in more recent archaeological sites (e.g., Cahen et al. 1979; Villa 1982; Villa and Courtin 1983). Members of the Koobi Fora Research Project have attempted to refit artifacts at a number of sites. At one site, FxJj 50 (Bunn et al. 1980), it was possible to reconstruct the sequence of flake removal from a number of cores. This approach has been very useful in a number of ways: 1. Important technological information can be readily inferred, since a "blow-by-blow" account of flaking patterns by early hominids is provided (Bunn et al. 1980; Toth 1982, 1985b). 2. Patterns of distribution of refitted pieces can be an important criterion in assessing whether a site has been significantly disturbed by geological or other forces. For example, Schick (in Bunn et al. 1980; Schick 1984) and Kroll and Isaac (1984; Kroll, n.d.) have shown that at Site FxJj 50, refitted pieces are normally found in proximity in discrete parts of the site, which argues against redeposition downstream. 3. Refitted pieces may give an indication of the stages of flaking represented at a site. Toth (1982, 1985b) has argued that only partial segments of the entire core reduction sequence were seen at FxJj 50 within the excavated areas. For example, only 6 out of 63 cores and retouched pieces had any conjoining pieces of debitage, and most sets of conjoining flakes indicated previous core reduction outside of the excavated area, as well as subsequent removal of the core from the immediate (excavated) site locale. This also supports the argument that lithic material was curated and transported from one locality to another, leaving only partial stages of flaking at one place.</page><page sequence="29">THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF PROTOHUMAN CULTURE 29 4. Finally, refitting studies by Kroll at FxJj 20E (personal communication, 1979) have shown that while some flakes from a core appear thermally altered, other flakes from the same core do not. This suggests that a fire had occurred at the site after the core had been flaked (this is discussed in more detail later). Microwear Analysis of Stone Artifacts The methodological breakthrough of Keeley (1980) in establishing that micro scopic edge-wear patterns (in the form of polish and damage on working edges of stone artifacts) can identify the worked material and the type of motion of the tool has been an important step in understanding the adaptive role that stone tools played in prehistoric societies. Keeley's criteria for assessing stone tool function include the brightness, texture, and luster of polish as well as striations, pitting, and microflaking. For suitable raw materials, it is now possible to identify with a reasonable degree of confidence those artifacts used long enough to develop identifiable wear traces, to infer how they were used and on what material, and thus to establish on empirical grounds the relationship between artifact form and function. At present the technique is restricted to fresh, fine-grained siliceous raw materials (flint, chert, and chalcedony), although investigations by Sussman (1984) with artifacts in vein quartz may ultimately make this raw material ame nable to microscopic identification of at least some functions. A major problem in applying these techniques to early Stone Age studies in Africa is that most artifact assemblages are dominated by rock types unsuitable for microwear analysis with the present techniques and state of knowledge. Nonetheless, some artifacts of suitable materials are sometimes found at early sites, and a small sample of fine-grained siliceous artifacts from Koobi Fora sites was subjected to microwear studies (Keeley and Toth 1981). Out of a sample of 56 artifacts, 9 had identifiable wear traces. Four had polishes which enabled them to be interpreted as butchery tools; three flakes were interpreted as wood working tools (two for scraping, one for sawing); and two artifacts showed classic plant polish as developed in cutting soft vegetable matter. These tantalizing results indicate that early stone technology-was directed toward a range of activities. Further, the presence of wood polishes on certain stone implements strongly suggests that these were "tools to make other tools," something not observed in chimpanzee technology. Another interesting observa tion is that none of the Koobi Fora artifacts with use polishes would have been classified as tools in the formal sense but would have been placed into the debitage category by traditional classification schemes, since they are unre touched flakes and fragments. Future studies of artifact assemblages made from fine-grained siliceous mate rial, such as the white cherts at some Olduvai Gorge sites (Leakey 1971; Stiles et al. 1974), would very likely enlarge our sample of early artifacts with microwear</page><page sequence="30">30 NICHOLAS TOTH AND KATHY D. SCHICK evidence and, thus, increase our knowledge of the functions of early stone artifacts. Bone Technology Clark (1977) has discussed the problem of identifying bone tools from early prehistoric sites. The question of whether hominids modified and used bone tools is more difficult to resolve in comparison to stone tools, since other animals are attracted to bones and may produce patterned modification as well (e.g., Binford 1981; Bonnichsen 1973; Brain 1981; Bunn 1982b; Potts 1982; Shipman 1981). As mentioned previously, Dart (e.g., 1957) argued that the faunal remains in the cave breccias of Makapansgat showed clear evidence of modification that could be attributed to the use of bone tools by australopithecines. His claims have subsequently been called into question by the taphonomic investigations of Brain (1981), who demonstrated that many of these patterns of bone modification could be caused by nonhominid agencies. Brain's demonstrations are very valu able in showing evidence of the workings of nonhominid agencies at the site, but one still cannot completely rule out the possibility that some of the bone was modified and used by hominids. More recently, some strong arguments have been forwarded for evidence of bone tools at early Stone Age sites. A set of curious bone fragments has been recovered from the South African cave sites of Swartkrans and Sterkfontein by Brain (1981, 1982). These appear to be limb shaft fragments that have been polished and microscopically scratched at one end. Experiments by Brain (1982) suggest that these pointed bone fragments may have been tools used to dig up edible bulbs. A study by Shipman (1984) has reassessed Leakey's claims of bone tools from the lower beds at Olduvai Gorge (1971). Shipman reported microscopic use polishes on 41 out of the 125 specimens designated by Leakey as bone tools. Shipman has claimed that three types of tools may be identified: (1) bone anvils, with puncture marks that are found at sites with stone awls, (2) tools used on soft substances, and (3) tools, often larger ones, used on mixed substances (presum ably hard and soft materials). These intriguing studies demonstrate the need for careful examination of well preserved faunal materials from archaeological sites. As more experimental work is directed towards studies of bone technology, it is likely that any distinctive patterns of hominid-induced bone modification through manufacture and use will become more readily identifiable. Wood Technology At present there are no Plio-Pleistocene archaeological sites in Africa with preserved wood, much less wooden artifacts. The earliest known wooden imple</page><page sequence="31">THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF PROTOHUMAN CULTURE 31 ments that have been reported are from sites less than 0.5 m.y. old: these include the shaped, wooden spear point from Clacton, England (Oakley et al. 1977), the club-shaped object from Kalambo Falls, Zambia (Clark 1970), and the charred wooden spear from Lehringen, Germany (Movius 1950). However, based on the presence of wood polishes on artifacts from Koobi Fora sites mentioned above, it seems likely that simple wooden artifacts were made and used by Plio-Pleisto cene hominids, although we have no way of determining their nature (Keeley and Toth 1981). Fire There is a general appreciation of the great evolutionary significance of the controlled use of fire by early hominid populations, as summarized by Oakley (1956). The obvious advantages of fire would have included such luxuries as warmth and light; protection from animals; making many foods easier and safer to eat as well as helping preserve some, such as meat, for longer periods; driving game in the hunt; woodworking by charring and scraping; and providing a focus for social interaction. The earliest generally accepted evidence of fire in the prehistoric record comes from a number of sites less than 0.6 m.y. old, for example Choukoutien in China, Verteszollos in Hungary, Terra Amata in France, Kalambo Falls in Zam bia, and Cave of Hearths in South Africa. But, as Isaac (1972) has pointed out, charcoal does not normally appear to survive for long periods of time in tropical environments, so that typical hearth structures characteristic of later periods of time around the world may not be as recognizable in the earlier Stone Age. Dart (1948) argued that darkened animal bones from the Makapansgat breccias demonstrated the use of fire by the australopithecine also found at the site, whom he dubbed Australopithecus prometheus. This alleged evidence of fire was sub sequently demonstrated to be due to manganese staining of the sediments rather than thermal alteration (Oakley 1956). New claims for the use of fire by early hominids have been made since 1975. These include evidence from (1) Site FxJj 20E at Koobi Fora, Kenya, (2) Chesowanja, Kenya, and (3) Swartkrans in South Africa. At Koobi Fora, patches of reddened sediment were found at the level of artifacts and bones (Harris 1978; Isaac and Harris 1978). Conjoining pieces of stone from the same core at this level showed that some of the pieces were discolored, probably due to thermal alteration, while other pieces from the same core were unchanged (E. Kroll personal communication, 1979). This strongly suggests that there was a fire at the site after flaking had occurred, though whether it was of nonhominid or hominid origin remains uncertain. At Chesowanja, in Kenya, over 40 fragments described as "burnt clay" were found associated with a linear scatter of stone artifacts and bones (Gowlett et al. 1981). Here the investigators strongly argued that this association was probably</page><page sequence="32">32 NICHOLAS TOTH AND KATHY D. SCHICK more than chance and could well be evidence of the hominid use of fire. Howev er, as indicated by Isaac (1982b), baked clay fragments are very common in early Pleistocene sediments, and many are probably the result of natural brushfires igniting tree stumps or logs. Finally, C.K. Brain (personal communication, 1984) has found bone frag ments from the South African cave of Swartkrans that are darkened and appear to have been burned. Shipman (1984, personal communication, 1984; Shipman et al. 1984) reports that microscopic criteria have been established to distinguish unburned bone and teeth from those that have been subjected to various high temperatures. This method has potential value for determining whether osteological materials from prehistoric sites have been thermally altered. It must be admitted that none of these cases, at present, demonstrates beyond doubt that humans were making or using fire in the very early Stone Age. To establish this claim, it would seem necessary to demonstrate the existence of a discrete, hominid-constructed feature, such as a hearth structure, containing concentrations of burned bone or stone, although the earliest controlled fires may in fact have been much more casual. Alternatively, some type of artifact associ ated with fire technology, such as the charred tip of the Lehringren spear (Movius 1950) or an abraded piece of pyrite used to produce sparks for fire manufacture, could perhaps serve as proof of fire technology in the early Stone Age, but no such evidence is yet known. Structures and Shelters Pongids commonly fashion simple nests of vegetation either in trees (chim panzees and orangutans) or on the ground (gorillas). It seems likely that, for a group of tool-using hominids foraging in the grasslands of Africa, some sort of modified sleeping places for safety and comfort might have been constructed, If hominids did sleep or carry on other activities in trees, there would probably be little archaeological visibility of this use of aboveground vegetation in the pre historic record. If ground-level (or aboveground) sleeping quarters were also the locus of tool-manufacturing or tool-using activities, although we might expect archaeological residues to document these activities, it would be more difficult to infer the use of sleeping places per se without additional evidence indicating structures or shelters. Leakey (1971) has described a stone circle at Site DK in Bed I of Olduvai Gorge; this circle measured about 5 m across and consisted of pieces of vesicular lava rubble which outcropped nearby, with stone artifacts and bone in associa tion. Leakey suggested that the stone circle was actually the remains of a struc ture, the rocks being used as a windbreak or to hold down other construction materials such as branches.</page><page sequence="33">THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF PROTOHUMAN CULTURE 33 This feature from an early Pleistocene site is certainly an enigma, and it appears to be unique in the very early archaeological record. Potts (1984a) has suggested that it may be a natural phenomenon, perhaps formed when trees pushed through the lava and created a bare patch. Isaac (1984) also questioned the artifactual nature of this feature. However, if the spatial plots of the Olduvai floor are accurate (some materials in the stone circle were removed before the nature of the feature was realized, and part of the stone array has been recreated from recorded provenience information; Leakey 1971), it is possible that this feature could represent some sort of protective structure built by stone-tool making hominids. If this was the case, the low frequencies of stone artifacts and bones actually within the circle might well be expected. Several individuals could have easily lain or sat inside the circle, and if there had been thorny branches around its circumference, it might have served as a deterrent to preda tors. Modern pastoralists in East Africa today often protect livestock with simple defensive structures of this sort (Gifford 1977, 1980). Clark (in Leakey 1971) has also suggested that a relatively bare semicircular area of Site FLK Zinj at Olduvai may represent the area of a windbreak made of branches or other perishable material. This semicircular arc even faces today's prevailing winds and may have done so in the past. While this idea is intriguing and may indeed be true, additional corroborative evidence would be necessary for the acceptance of such a hypothesis. (Further discussion of this evidence appears later in the section "Studies of Spatial Configurations.") Brain (1981) has suggested that the cave sites of Sterkfontein and Swartkrans in South Africa may have been natural sleeping quarters for hominids and other primates, since their fossil bones occur there in such high numbers relative to other taxa. At Sterkfontein, in Member 4, a minimum of 85 Australopithecus robustus individuals were found, by far the most common taxon, and a minimum of 3 individuals of Homo sp. came from the same breccia. It would appear that australopithecines were frequent visitors to these caves and often died within them, probably from predation by other animals. Brain (1981) argued that by Member 5 times at Sterkfontein, larger-brained hominids had become the mas ters of the cave and had emerged as the hunters rather than the hunted. SITE-FORMATION PROCESSES: COMPARATIVE MODELS Nature of the Problem Though epistemological issues have become prominent concerns in nearly all modern archaeological studies, they present particularly acute and pressing prob lems for those working with the early archaeological record. Questions regarding</page><page sequence="34">34 NICHOLAS TOTH AND KATHY D. SCHICK the nature of, and the manner of inference from, archaeological data have special pertinence within the realm of early hominid archaeology. In fact, questions that would seem somewhat superfluous to archaeologists concerned with later periods of time have become the focus of concern and deliberation in many recent studies. The question of what constitutes actual archaeological evidence, that is, unquestionable residual traces of prehistoric hominid behavior, has assumed a position of primary importance in the field in recent years. Researchers in the early record are not blessed with a multitude of clear-cut features and diverse artifacts at early sites, such as definitive structures, hearths, vessels, artifacts of materials other than stone, and composite artifacts. Rather, they must content themselves with a small body of indisputable artifactual evidence along with a larger bulk of more ambiguous data. An important problem, then, in the study of the early archaeological record can be the mere identification and recognition of definitive cultural traces, in the first place, and the sorting of them from the effects of other processes operating within the environment. Early archaeological evidence is relatively scarce geo graphically, as well as somewhat meager in terms of quantity and variety. Stone artifacts are a sufficient and nearly necessary condition for identifying an archae ological occurrence in the early record. However, other aspects of these sites, notably, fossilized animal remains coinciding with stone artifacts at the same locality, as well as the concentration and spatial array of all of these materials, have often, in the past, been taken as de facto indicators of ancient behavior patterns (e.g., Isaac 1969, 1972, 1976a; Leakey 1963; Leakey 1971). It is now becoming apparent that beyond the presence of stone artifacts, other aspects of these traces must not be assumed to be induced solely or even partly by hominid hands. Patterns of spatial arrangement and spatial "associations" among mate rials found at early archaeological sites must be viewed with a critical eye before they can be ascribed to the action of prehistoric hominid behaviors (e.g., Binford 1981, 1983; Brain 1981; Isaac 1983, 1984). Underlying the problems in identifying cultural traces in the early record is the question of how to draw from extant evidence unambiguous behavioral in terpretations. For one, the analytical link between the material residues we find and any behavioral correlates in the past can be not only tenuous, but downright suspect, when we are dealing with creatures so remote from living Homo sapiens sapiens. These ancestors are separated from us by more than 1.5 million years of time and probably 100-150 thousand generations, as well as by a myriad of genetic, morphological, and most certainly, behavioral and social transforma tions that challenge our interpretation and understanding. Analysis of very early archaeological traces through simple analogy is particu larly fraught with difficulty, since no modem analogues come even close to the species under investigation. It is not even clear whether it would be more appro priate to invoke comparisons, particularly with regard to elements of subsistence</page><page sequence="35">THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF PROTOHUMAN CULTURE 35 and foraging modes, with one or another ethnographic case among recent or modem hunter-gatherers, or whether some elements of the ancient behavioral repertoire would be better compared to some of our nonhuman primate or even nonprimate relatives. To proceed with the study at all, a more cautiously applied uniformitarian approach (Gifford 1981) seems in order, exploring diverse work ing hypotheses to obtain a best fit with existing data (Chamberlin 1965; Isaac 1984; Monks 1981). However, as discussed later, rarely have alternative hypoth eses been explicitly considered (see Binford 1984). Furthermore, we have had inadequate comparative information about the effects of diverse site-formation processes to use in developing and evaluating alternative models. Taphonomic studies have now contributed significantly to our understanding of the transformation of organic remains from living things into fossil record, or from the "biosphere to the lithosphere" (the subject of taphonomy as defined by Efremov, 1940; see Olson 1980), and many of these findings have profound implications for archaeologists (see Gifford, 1981, for an overview). However, archaeological site formation can involve numerous behavioral, biological, geo logical, and other processes that are not readily disentangled in the final product. We have now sufficiently "come of age" in paleoanthropology to realize the complexity of the phenomena with which we are dealing, but we are still grap pling with how to go about unraveling their component parts. Avenues of Approach: Sources of Comparative Models In Schiffer's (1983) overview of the development of site-formation research, he notes the disparity between the burgeoning growth in our knowledge about site-formation processes and the actual implementation of this in archaeological research. This has certainly been true for studies of the Lower Paleolithic; for instance, paleoarchaeologists have often been guilty of ignoring or at least mini mizing the obviously important impact of sedimentary processes upon archae ological materials. But early archaeology has been additionally hampered by a real lack of adequate information about many of the agencies (physical as well as biological ones) that may have contributed enormously to material patterns at archaeological sites. Since 1975, many of the analytical perspectives emerging out of site-formation research (e.g., Gifford 1977, 1978; Schiffer 1972, 1976, 1983) have been applied explicitly to the study of the early archaeological record (Binford 1981; Brain 1981; Bunn 1982b; Isaac 1981a, 1983, 1984; Potts 1982; Schick 1984). This has generated a concerted search for and exploration of comparative models for processes that may have helped form early sites and a more cautious application of these to the evidence at hand. As yet there is no well-defined methodology for accomplishing this, but there has been a distinct</page><page sequence="36">36 NICHOLAS TOTH AND KATHY D. SCHICK trend toward actively seeking and seriously considering information about alter native models for "how it happened." Sources of inspiration for pattern recognition and verification, or, in the ver nacular of the discipline, comparative models, have come largely from other established fields, particularly taphonomy, ethnoarchaeology, and primate be havior studies or from actualistic studies, which involve observation of, or direct experimentation with, particular aspects of site-formation processes. Taphonomy and the Archaeology of Human Origins Faunal remains constitute an important element of analysis at many early sites and, as pointed out by Binford (1981), a major springboard for some of the most vivid behavioral interpretations of our evolutionary past. Hence, findings of taphonomic research have naturally become an extremely important concern in the field. In fact, one of the most energetic debates of recent years has been over the significance of faunal remains uncovered at early sites and what inferences can be made from them regarding early hominid behaviors (discussed later in the section "Formation of Early Archaeological Sites"). Some important evolution ary implications regarding the development of human social behavior, foraging patterns, and diet depend upon the outcome of these debates (see Binford 1981, 1983; Brain 1981; Isaac 1983, 1984; and Potts 1984a, for further discussion and arguments on the issues and the evidence). Gifford (1981) has critically examined the background and development of taphonomic studies and their contributions and relevance to archaeological inves tigation. In this review she presents two major steps in searching for patterned regularities in the creation of a fossil assemblage: 1. Establishing the link between an individual trace and the process that has produced it. (This entails comparison of diverse processes and their respec tive effects, as well as establishing the range of variation and areas of separation and overlap between effects of diverse processes.) 2. Establishing the same link between sets of traces and the processes that produced them, that is, the fossil assemblage composition and its patterns of modification and their respective causes. (Achievement of this level of recognition entails being able to predict causes from their effects in actu alistic studies.) These requirements essentially demand the ability to construct "if and only if' conditional statements for observed phenomena, which has rarely been ac complished in the field: "The gravest problem in actualistic research is assuming that a given agent is necessary and a sufficient condition of an observable attribute when no such relationship has actually been established" (Gifford</page><page sequence="37">THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF PROTOHUMAN CULTURE 37 1981:394). Such rigor has not yet been achieved in most areas of paleoanthropo logy. Nevertheless, a concerted search has been initiated for such causal rela tionships to apply to the fossil record, and headway has been made in this direction (see Behrensmeyer and Hill 1980; Johnson 1985; Shipman 1981, for overviews of some of the major aspects and findings of taphonomic research). Taphonomic studies of particular relevance for early archaeological research include those that examine bone weathering and skeletal disarticulation (Beh rensmeyer 1978b; Brain 1967a; Hill 1976, 1979a, 1979b); bone collecting ac tivities of carnivores and other animals and the nature of these bone accumula tions (e.g., Avery 1984a, 1984b; Avery et al. 1984; Behrensmeyer 1983; Behrensmeyer and Dechant-Boaz 1980; Binford 1981; Brain 1968, 1981; Bunn 1982b, 1983a; Dechant-Boaz 1982; Hill 1975, 1976, 1979a, 1979b, 1980; Mills and Mills 1977; Sutcliffe 1970); observational and experimental studies of pat terns of bone breakage and surface modification by diverse carnivores (e.g., Avery 1984b; Binford 1981; Binford and Bertram 1977; Bonnichsen 1973, 1979; Brain 1980, 1981; Haynes 1980; Hill 1976, 1980); experimental studies of bone abrasion by a variety of natural forces (e.g., water and particle abrasion) as well as various preparation techniques (Bromage 1984); and observational studies of bone abrasion by animal trampling on rocky substrates (Andrews and Cooke 1986) to mention only a few examples of the rapidly growing number of contri butions in this arena. Some researchers have focused upon criteria that appear to differentiate faunal assemblages produced by scavenging from those produced by hunting activities, for instance, in terms of the size and age of animals repre sented (Vrba 1980). Another important area of taphonomic research has been investigation of the effects of hydraulic forces on bones and bone assemblages (e.g., Behrensmeyer 1975; Boaz and Behrensmeyer 1976; Hanson 1980; Voorhies 1969), discussed in more detail later in the section on experimental studies of site-formation processes. An overview of various approaches to faunal analysis of Stone Age sites has been presented by Klein (1980) and Klein and Cruz-Uribe (1984), and Clutton-Brock and Grigson (1983) have compiled a set of problem-oriented studies dealing with modern and archaeological faunal mate rials and their relevance to prehistoric reconstructions. The development of concrete, universally accepted, if-then statements about all of these processes has not yet been achieved; however, there are emerging some generalizations which have been applied to faunal remains at early sites. First, carnivore kill sites tend to differ from transported assemblages in the predominance of axial elements in the former and of limb elements in the latter. Among modern carnivores, hyenas appear to be the most powerful bone-collect ing agent, although this behavior is variable both within and between hyena species. Among modern felids, leopards alone seem to produce moderate ac cumulations of transported carcass parts at areas used frequently for consump tion. Porcupines as well as rodents produce fairly distinctive gnaw marks on</page><page sequence="38">38 NICHOLAS TOTH AND KATHY D. SCHICK bones, particularly on larger ones; porcupines also produce accumulations of relatively dry, more durable elements from the landscape (Brain 1980). Finally, carnivores often produce distinctive modifications of bones and bone surfaces in the form of breakage patterns and a variety of gnaw marks, punctures, striations, and other grooves produced by working bones with their teeth (e.g., Binford 1981; Brain 1981). More specific comments on the application of such criteria to some early archaeological materials is made later in this chapter. The wealth of information from such diverse areas of taphonomic investiga tion can only be evaluated in a comparative framework, most specifically with regard to the hominid behavioral components in the archaeological system and how they have contributed to the observed traces. To better understand the causal relationships of possible prehistoric activities, we have turned primarily to eth noarchaeology, as well as to studies of closely related nonhuman primates and to experimental studies. Contributions from Ethnoarchaeology: Potential and Piffalls Observations of contemporary or recent peoples have long been an important source of insight for making behavioral inferences in archaeology and for identi fying the causal link between observed archaeological traces and the behaviors that produced them. In the archaeological study of human origins, especially popular references have been to the few modern hunter-gatherer societies still living in tropical latitudes (Hayden 1981), such as the Australian aborigines (Gould 1968, 1969, 1980; Hayden 1977, 1979), the Bushmen, or San, of the African Kalahari desert region (e.g., Bunn 1983a; Lee 1979; Lee and DeVore 1976; Yellen 1977), the Hottentots of southwest Africa (Brain 1967b, 1969), and, less often, some groups living in more northerly latitudes (e.g., Binford 1978, 1981). In using such analogies, it should be, and generally is, expressly stated that these living peoples are not being used in any way as "living fossils" or primitive relics of early populations in a cultural sense. Rather, certain aspects of their lifestyles, particularly elements of their subsistence, foraging patterns, and use of the landscape, are of special interest for possible comparisons and contrasts with the archaeological record of lifeways of culture-bearing hominids. Particular areas of interest for comparisons, therefore, have included (1) large scale aspects of behavior and their material residues, such as foraging and land use patterns, utilization of plants as well as a variety of animal resources, sexual division of labor, and the differential use of space within a camp area; and (2) more particular activities, such as processing of food resources, and patterns of breakage and other modification of bones. There have been a number of cautions against indiscriminate use of analogy of modern peoples to a prehistoric ancestor of unknown disposition (e.g., see</page><page sequence="39">THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF PROTOHUMAN CULTURE 39 Binford 1968, 1981, 1983; Freeman 1968; Gifford 1980; Gould 1978; Schrire 1980; Wylie 1985). These have rightly stressed either the limited range of exist ing hunter-gatherer lifeways relative to all those which have probably existed through time or the philosophical and logical problems of using such analogies to reconstruct lifeways that are unknown at the outset. Nonetheless, behavioral reconstructions must begin somewhere, and modem behavior patterns neces sarily serve as a source of possible models for early hominid activities; the problem is in recognizing continuities and discontinuities in the course of human development. There are some behavioral attributes which have been controversially ascribed to Plio-Pleistocene hominids, particularly some which appear to be universal among modem peoples but have an unknown time depth in our past. Among these would be some commonplace aspects of modern human behavior, such as the occupation of an area for some period by a social group, usually involving one or more sets of related individuals, or a "family"; maintenance of fairly low population densities yet with fairly large ranges compared to mammals of similar size (Foley 1984); the use of a central place for a variety of activities, including sleeping, food preparation, eating, and socializing; and the regular construction and use of some sort of shelter or structure for purposes other than just sleeping. In addition, somewhat more complex aspects of these behaviors may or may not be present by Plio-Pleistocene times, such as transport and delayed consump tion of food, sharing of food resources with possible implications of reciprocal relationships, involvement in meat consumption and hunting activities, sexual division of labor in food procurement and child-care activities, and the repeated focus of many of these social and feeding activities at a central place (referred to in the archaeological record variously as a living floor, a camp, or a home base). Recent debate in paleoanthropology has surrounded. many such issues and they have by no means been resolved as yet, as is further discussed later. However, there is a current trend toward a more cautious application of available eth nographic models to the evidence at hand. Primate Behavior Studies: Expanding the Range of Models Faced with the obvious and indisputable limitations of ethnographic analogy, another source of useful comparative information has been emerging from the field of primate behavior studies. Interesting and potentially useful areas of study include 1. The growing body of evidence on tool manufacture and use by chim panzees, including reports of the use of termite sticks, leaf sponges and spoons, branch waving and throwing (e.g., Jones and Sabater Pi 1969; Lawick-Goodall</page><page sequence="40">40 NICHOLAS TOTH AND KATHY D. SCHICK 1968; McGrew 1974, 1977; Nishida 1973; Nishida and Hiraiwa 1982; Struhsaker and Hunkeler 1971; Sugiyama and Koman 1979), and also the more recently discovered use of stones and wood for cracking open nuts (Boesch and Boesch 1981, 1984; Sugiyama and Koman 1979); 2. Foraging and land-use patterns among primate groups, which can extend our sense of possible arrangements and constraints in patterns of group feeding, in ranging behavior, food choices, sexual division of labor, and so on. The comparisons made by Isaac (1980, 1981b) between ranging patterns among various primate groups (baboons, chimpanzees, gorillas, and patas monkeys) and those seen among human foragers (the Kalahari San in Isaac's examples) demonstrate some of the major differences between land-use patterns among humans and nonhuman primates, as well as some of the inter- and intraspecific variation among the nonhuman primate groups. For instance, in the examples cited by Isaac (1980, 198 Ib) nonhuman primates adopt a foraging pattern that primarily entails the common animal pattern of eating on the move, albeit with a wide range of variation between species and within a given species. Foraging pattems observed among many nonhuman primates, as discussed by Isaac, include (1) movements of entire troops or social groups, as observed in patas monkeys and baboons (Hall 1965), and in reduced range, as among gorillas (Schaller 1963); (2) occasional splitting off of males and females without young (Rowell 1966) in baboon troops; (3) splintering of the troop into smaller groups among hamadryas baboons (Kummer 1968); and (4) quite variable patterns of movement observed among chimpanzees, with dif ferences between social units or even within the same group at different seasons. Observed foraging patterns have included simultaneous movement of the entire social group (Nishida 1968), fluctuating dispersal and temporary regrouping (Suzuki 1969, 1975), differential use of the home range among sexes (e.g., among females with infants, estrous females, and males moving individually or in gorups; Wrangham 1977), and temporary group congregations at places of food resource bonanzas, such as at feeding stations put out by humans or at fruiting trees. 3. Evidence of meat-eating and hunting activities among nonhuman primates. As is discussed further in the section on evidence for hominid diet, there have been numerous reports emanating from primate behavior studies documenting pattems of predation and scavenging among chimpanzees (e.g., Hasegawa et al. 1983; Morris and Goodall 1977; Nishida et al. 1978; Suzuki 1971; Teleki 1973a, 1973b, 1981; Wrangham 1977), baboons (e.g., Harding 1973, 1974, 1975; Hausfater 1976; Morris and Goodall 1977; Strum 1975, 1976a, 1976b, 1981), and orangutans (Sugardjito and Nurhuda 1981). Such information on the predation and scavenging practices of nonhuman primates can help put hypothetical behavior patterns of early hominids into</page><page sequence="41">THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF PROTOHUMAN CULTURE 41 perspective within the range of modem primate patterns. It can also help us understand the ecological constraints on such activities and the practical matters of techniques and strategies of predation, size of prey relative to the predator, and methods of consumption and distribution of meat resources within the social group. For instance, predation is observed primarily among males, sometimes involves group cooperation, is accomplished without the use of tools, focuses upon prey smaller in body size than the predator, and often entails some distribu tion of the acquired meat among other members of the group, even those not involved in the predatory attack. Once again, precise analogues for elements of our prehistoric condition are not being sought; rather, we are working to expand our comparative record and, we hope, to recognize and better understand the similarities and differences between our closest living relatives and our prehistoric ancestors. Although in the case of primate studies, since foraging practices rarely involve materials that would last in the archaeological record, we must imagine potential material effects of rang ing behaviors; such comparisons can expand our foundation for constructing and testing models of early hominid behavior. Experimental and Observational Studies A method of approach to the study of site formation that has exhibited a rapid growth surge in early archaeology is experimental research. In retrospect, this has been a natural way to go: faced with remote processes operating at quite distant points in time, an effective way of understanding many contributing site formation processes has been to examine the process-product relationship in an experimental situation. Cultural Processes Since archaeological studies depend ultimately upon artifactual evidence, ar tifact replication has become a common approach to understanding prehistoric technologies. This approach has been applied in earnest to the early archae ological record in experimental studies of the manufacture and use of early stone artifact forms (Jones 1979, 1980, 1981; Toth 1982, 1985b; Toth and Schick 1983). Bones have also come under the scrutiny of experimental investigation in numerous studies of bone fracture by stone percussors (e.g., Bonnichsen 1973, 1979; Bunn 1982b; Potts 1982) or under controlled mechanical stress (Davis 1984) and in studies of bone modification by carnivores (discussed earlier) or by stone tools during butchery activities (e.g., Binford 1981; Bromage and Boyde 1984; Bunn 1981, 1982b; Potts and Shipman 1981; Shipman 1981; Shipman and Rose 1983).</page><page sequence="42">42 NICHOLAS TOTH AND KATHY D. SCHICK Noncultural Processes Vertical Dispersion and Damage: Trampling and Other Processes. The effects of noncultural processes upon cultural materials have also become a topic of considerable interest in archaeology as a whole (see Wood and Johnson 1978) but particularly so in studies of the early archaeological record, where cultural traces make up a distinctly minor portion of the overall deposit. A prime example of this enhanced view of site-formation processes is Villa's (1982) explicit con sideration of evidence for vertical disturbance of deposits at several Old World sites ranging from the Lower Paleolithic to the Epipaleolithic. Pursuits in this area have involved experimental studies of the effects of trampling (by humans and other animals) upon deposits, either as a cause of bone surface damage or breakage (Bunn 1982b; Fiorillo 1984) or of burial and vertical dispersion of artifacts (Gifford personal communication, 1982; Gifford and Behrensmeyer 1977; Villa and Courtin 1983). Vertical movement of artifacts through wetting and drying of unconsolidated sediments was examined in an experimental study by Cahen and Moeyersons (1977). Effects of Sedimentary Processes. An area of growing interest has been the effect of sedimentary processes upon both artifactual and faunal materials found at archaeological sites. As noted earlier, taphonomic studies have for some time been examining the effects of fluvial processes upon animal bones both within natural channel contexts and in the laboratory. Of special interest has been how flowing water can alter assemblages according to the different transport potential of various bones (see Gifford 1981:419-424, for a summary of some of the major results of these experimental studies). Such research has provided impor tant criteria for recognizing hydraulic sorting of bone assemblages, largely through the ratio of easily transported elements (such as vertebrae and ribs) to those lag elements that tend to resist transport (such as mandibles and teeth) (Badgley and Behrensmeyer 1980; Behrensmeyer 1975; Hanson 1980; Voorhies 1969). The effect of sedimentary processes upon stone artifacts at sites has also become a subject of growing interest. Pioneering experimental studies by Isaac (1967b) and by Harris (1978) indicated the value and necessity of understanding how alluvial processes can affect and help shape the cultural deposits contained in ancient sediments (see discussion in Shackley 1978). Experimental work by Shackley (1974) identified microscopic traces such as ridge flattening and abra sion produced on flint implements by sedimentary load in a stream. Unfortunate ly, many artifacts at early archaeological sites in Africa are made of volcanic rocks that undergo some surface deterioration over time, possibly by chemical weathering processes in the alkaline sediments, and may not be amenable to this sort of analysis. Much of the experimental and observational research carried out so far in this</page><page sequence="43">THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF PROTOHUMAN CULTURE 43 .arena has been concerned with the action of sedimentary forces in dispersing, reconcentrating, and burying archaeological materials. The longitudinal study by Gifford and Behrensmeyer (1977) of the formation and burial of a Dassenetch campsite in northern Kenya provided direct insight into the combined effects of human trampling and several discrete flood events on site materials (primarily animal bone in this case). A program of experimental studies by Schick (in Bunn et al. 1980; Schick 1984, 1986, n.d.) has examined the effects of sedimentary processes upon mate rials like those found at early sites in East Africa. Stone replicas of early artifact forms along with animal bones were placed in various geological environments in East Africa and monitored over a period of 4 years. These experiments-in a sense, simulated sites-were finally excavated with full documentation as to provenience of the materials and sedimentation and burial at the site. Of particu lar interest in these studies were changes in the assemblage composition and the spatial disposition of site materials. The results of these studies, in combination with those from stone-manufacturing experiments (Toth and Schick in Bunn et al. 1980; Schick 1984, 1986, n.d.; Toth 1982, 1985b), have been applied to material configurations at several early sites at Koobi Fora to help assess the degree of disturbance each has suffered during the sedimentary process (Schick 1984:181-239). Schick's criteria for judging degrees of disturbance included (1) debitage size fraction, (2) conjoining evidence, (3) spatial patterns (such as separation of larger and smaller materials), (4) dip, orientation, or imbrication of artifacts, (5) physical condition of artifacts (e.g., abrasion), and (6) sedimentary and paleo geographic context. Paleontological Excavations as Controls A final category of relevant research which has now been initiated in this arena may be regarded as prehistoric actualistic studies: the excavation of paleon tological sites that are known to have no hominid input into their formation. These may be seen as paleontological controls which, while the precise modes of site formation are not known and have not actually been observed, are at least essentially natural, or affected only by physical and nonhuman biological agen cies. Such faunal assemblages have, after all, been affected by diverse agencies over time. They are no longer surface assemblages for which we have to imagine the effects of diagenetic processes and differential preservation-they have al ready been through it all. Specific studies of bone modification by nonhominid agencies in fossil assemblages include excavations by Behrensmeyer (1984) of 9 million-year-old sites from the Miocene in Pakistan, by Toth (Toth et al. n.d.) of a 15-million-year-old Miocene site in California, and by Fiorillo (1984) of an</page><page sequence="44">44 NICHOLAS TOTH AND KATHY D. SCHICK other site of Miocene age in Nebraska. Of special interest in these studies has been: 1. Taxonomic diversity of the assemblages, with up to 15 mammalian species documented at one site by Behrensmeyer (1984:3) and at least 7 observed by Toth and Schick (Toth et al. n.d.). 2. Skeletal element representation, for example, axial elements and teeth dominate Behrensmeyer's (1984) assemblages, but limb elements and teeth are predominant in Toth and Schick's excavation to the near exclusion of axial elements, possibly due to fluvial removal of these more readily trans portable bones (Toth et al. n.d.). 3. Bone fracture patterns, not yet fully analyzed or reported but with spiral fractures evident in each study (Behrensmeyer 1984; Toth et al. n.d.). 4. Patterns of bone surface modification, for instance, signs of carnivore damage (Behrensmeyer 1984; Toth et al. n.d.), or grooves and striations, some of which may be trampling damage (Behrensmeyer 1984; Fiorillo 1984). While the results of these various studies have not yet been fully documented, preliminary reports indicate quite a large range of variation among natural bone accumulations with regard to assemblage composition (by taxa and by elements) and evident bone modification. From the early results, it appears that a number of criteria which have sometimes been used to infer effects of hominid behavior in bone accumulations, such as taxonomic diversity, fracture patterns, degree of fragmentation, and some types of surface modification, can be mimicked by some natural phenomena. Such controlled excavations of paleontological deposits-using archae ological methods of horizontal excavation, careful extraction, and full documen tation of provenience for the express purpose of comparison with faunal mate rials in archaeological sites-have been initiated only fairly recently. When further information derived from studies of this sort has been widely reported and synthesized, comparisons with faunal assemblages at early archaeological sites will be feasible, and a more realistic assessment of the archaeological materials will be made possible. Considering Different Models These diverse approaches to the study of early archaeological traces, which use findings and perspectives from the field of taphonomy, from primate behav ior studies, and from actualistic studies entailing controlled observation, direct experimentation, or paleontological excavations as controls, have served to broaden our perspective on site-formation processes operating in the early ar</page><page sequence="45">THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF PROTOHUMAN CULTURE 45 chaeological record. As of yet, diagnostic criteria for distinguishing clear-cut evidence for the action of one process instead of another have been relatively few, but the search is truly on. We are now becoming acutely aware of the complexity of the phenomenon we are studying, and are in the process of slowly acquiring the proper analytical tools with which to proceed. Future research will benefit from carefully prepared, state-of-the-art syntheses of findings in each of these research areas, which should be forthcoming within the next several years. THE FORMATION OF EARLY ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES: UNTANGLING THE WEB? Discussion of current issues surrounding early archaeological site-formation processes would be incomplete without further comment on the recent debates over the meaning of faunal remains at these sites and, by extension, the nature of the sites themselves. Rather than attempt the lengthy task of recapitulating the many arguments and counterarguments on this issue (see Binford 1981, 1983, 1984; Bunn 1981, 1982a, 1982b; Isaac 1978a, 1978b, 1980, 1983, 1984; Potts 1982, 1984a, 1984b), a brief summary of some of the salient points is presented here. This would appear to be a valuable undertaking, not only as a chronicle of a fairly major issue in the field today but as a graphic example of how actualistic studies from diverse arenas are now being applied to an important problem in archaeological interpretation. It will also demonstrate some of the remaining difficulties encountered in making comparisons between modem phenomena and early archaeological evidence. Sites as Phenomena in Need of Explanation At the outset of this section, a reminder seems in order that the early archae ological sites in question do indeed merit and even require explanation, since they represent unprecedented, rather aberrant features on the paleolandscape. Not only do these artifacts demonstrate hominid manufacture, but, more impor tant, at least by 2 million years ago they occasionally appear in distinct con centrations within the archaeological record, representing new and remarkable features in prehistoric sediments. They are recurrent but evidently still rather special-rare occurrences over time and space for the first million years or so of the undisputed record of human cultural evolution. The production of a single tool for an express purpose or set of purposes may perhaps be readily understood, particularly in light of tool using and manufacturing by other animals. But here we are faced with a more crucial question: How and why were these artifact concentrations produced?</page><page sequence="46">46 NICHOLAS TOTH AND KATHY D. SCHICK The origins of the faunal concentrations at many of these sites are more problematic. Paleontologists regularly encounter natural faunal accumulations produced without human or hominid involvement. Questions such as the follow ing then arise: 1. Does the actual composition (by taxon and element) of the faunal deposits at early archaeological sites differ in fundamental, diagnostic ways from that in strictly paleontological occurrences (i.e., in which hominid intervention can be ruled out entirely). Do such deposits indicate carnivore accumulations (dens or kills) or natural death accumulations (attritional assemblages), or are they un diagnostic of either set of formative agencies? 2. Are there types of modification (fracture patterns, element-part representa tion, or surface traces) which indicate formative processes at work on the faunal deposits found in archaeological context? 3. Beyond such specific evidence of formative processes affecting either the composition or modification of the faunal assemblage, an additional question that might be asked addresses the association of disparate materials at these sites: Why do two phenomena of some rarity-faunal concentrations and, particularly, stone-artifact accumulations-consistently (though not exclusively) co-occur? Significance of Faunal Remains: Possible Explanations A basic question at hand, then, concerns the dynamics of site formation; or, how has a set of processes combined to form deposits of stone artifacts and bones at the same locale? There are various possible explanations for the development of such coinciding concentrations. An admittedly nonexhaustive list of these, but one that covers some of the major possibilities so far conceived and seriously considered, includes hypotheses that theorize these sites constitute some com bination of the following (grouped according to the primary bone-concentrating agency and the order of entrance of hominids into the system): 1. Hominid acquisition of complete carcasses or parts from complete car casses, and accumulation of these at certain locales. Carcasses and carcass parts may have been acquired either through scavenging of fresh carcasses before significant ravaging by carnivore or other agencies (termed "early scavenging" by Potts, 1983) or through hunting activities by hominids. Animal remains were transported by hominids along with stone artifacts to another locale for further processing and consumption. This model indicates an active association between the artifacts and the faunal deposits at a site in that both were transported to that location by hominids involved in eating animal resources, including quantities of animal flesh and organs. Afterwards the animal remains could have been further</page><page sequence="47">THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF PROTOHUMAN CULTURE 47 gnawed, bones broken open, and some even removed by carnivores and other animals. 2. Hominid reaccumulation of carnivore "leftovers." Faunal remains may have been extracted by hominids from carnivore kills or dens and then trans ported to the site locale where they were further modified by hominids extracting leftover nutrients, for instance, marrow contents of long bones or any remnant tissues. This model would entail hominid scavenging, termed "late scaveng ing," by Potts, 1983) or food acquisition after other predators or scavengers had worked over a carcass. It would also still entail an active association between the artifactual and faunal materials: hominids were bringing both stone and faunal materials (at least bones) to the site and obtaining food from the faunal animal parts, though probably deriving less nutrition in the form of soft tissues than in the previous model. 3. Hominid processing of carcasses at sites of natural death. Hominids might have been periodically feeding upon carcasses found at places on the landscape where animals had died. This model would also make available to the hominids the entire animal carcass, but does not entail subsequent transport of animal parts to another location. More than one animal at such sites would presumably entail repeated death at that location or mass death, perhaps through some catastrophe. 4. Hominid invasion of carnivore dens, lairs, or kill sites. Faunal concentra tions may have been produced at the site location by nonhominid, bone-collect ing predators or scavengers, such as hyenids or leopards, and afterwards the remains were acted upon by hominids. The hominids also imported stone tools to the location, possibly for purposes of food extraction or processing, and left many of them at the site locale. Again, this model indicates an active association between the artifacts and the faunal deposits, and it entails "late scavenging" activities but with different implications about foraging activities and competi tion with carnivores than in the second model. 5. Fortuitous association of carcass remains and stone artifact deposits. The abandoned artifacts and the animal remains may have been deposited at the site location in a fortuitous, passive association, perhaps brought about by some third factor, such as a source of water, shelter, or shade, but with no direct relationship between the two; that is, the artifacts may have been consistently left behind by hominids coincidentally in localities where predators accumulated bones (e.g., dens) or repeatedly preyed upon animals (i.e., kill sites) or at locations where accumulations of faunal remains were produced over time by natural deaths (e.g., at watering places; Binford 1981, 1983). 6. Secondary reconcentrations. The artifactual and faunal materials may have been combined and perhaps even reconcentrated by geological processes that helped form the archaeological deposit, for instance, by hydraulic forces, creat ing a spurious association after the initial deposition of the materials. In this model, the different site components may have been produced by disparate agencies and even in separate locales.</page><page sequence="48">48 NICHOLAS TOTH AND KATHY D. SCHICK Hypotheses of Early Archaeological Site Formation: Evaluation and Discussion The possibilities mentioned above for the development of combined con centrations of stone artifacts and bones are discussed here in light of some hypotheses that have been promoted or considered by various researchers for the formation and significance of early archaological sites. Sites as Hydraulic Jumbles? The effect of hydrological forces at work on a great number of early sites cannot be ignored or minimized. Most of these sites are found in alluvial deposits laid by flowing water. Some are located directly within channel deposits, and others are in floodplain sediments deposited in the vicinity of stream channels or lake margins. Experimental studies (Schick 1984) have shown how fluvial processes at work in such environments can drastically affect site materials by 1. Removing more easily transported materials, determined largely by size and morphology, from a site (such as smaller pieces of similar shape or more spherical pieces of similar size). 2. Distributing site contents over some distance, thus changing spatial config urations and "associations" among materials. Such redistribution can drastically affect assemblage composition, notably by moving smaller debitage and bone, as would be expected, first and farthest. The combined processes of hydraulic erosion and deposition can create spatial patterns of materials that could be interpreted as intrasite activity variation (e.g., "tool kits"). 3. Reconcentrating materials derived from upstream locations. Such recon centrations would tend to occur particularly in areas where flow velocity is checked locally, for instance, in the vicinity of obstacles, sharp bends, or chan nel confluences and divergences. Such deposits or dumps would potentially mix materials from diverse locations and with different formative histories. A partic ular caution here is the potential for obstacles to stream flow, such as carcasses or vegetation, to help trap materials washed from upstream in a channel or on a floodplain. The obvious impact of fluvial processes upon some sites set in channel con texts has long been recognized at Olduvai Gorge, where one of four site catego ries was designated as a river or stream channel site (Leakey 1971:258). At Koobi Fora, Harris (1978) duly recognized the channel context for many of the Karari sites, and Isaac and Crader (1981) added Type G (i.e., redeposited in channel deposits) to the previously established set of site categories for this region (Isaac and Harris 1978). Binford (1977), in his review of Isaac's book on the Acheulean site of Olorge sailie (Isaac 1977), suggested that many Lower Paleolithic sites could very well</page><page sequence="49">THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF PROTOHUMAN CULTURE 49 be redeposited jumbles of artifacts and bones with a minimum of behavioral information preserved. Isaac (1977), had in fact suggested the possible impor tance of fluvial forces in affecting some of the Olorgesailie sites through the "kinematic wave effect" (as described by Langbein and Leopold 1968) or the creation of "traffic jams" or materials interacting in fluid flow. More precise analysis of the nature of Koobi Fora sites and assemblages within diverse sedimentary contexts has now been carried out in independent studies by members of the Koobi Fora Research Project. Kaufulu (1983) has provided a detailed assessment of the sedimentary contexts of many of the sites and an estimate of the probable impact of sedimentary agencies upon their contents. Schick (1984) has examined the composition and overall spatial configuration of some Koobi Fora archaeological assemblages in light of experimental studies on the effects of behavioral and sedimentary processes in addition to information on sedimentary context. These studies indicate that sites at Koobi Fora exhibit differences in formative histories and a range in degrees of disturbance. As would be expected, sites in finer-grained, floodplain deposits usually appear to have suffered less postoc cupational alteration than have sites in coarser, channel contexts; however, vary ing degrees of hydrological disturbance can be detected in either context (Schick 1984). For example, while Sites FxJj 1, 3, 10, and 50 are all in fairly fine grained deposits, FxJj 50 shows signs of only minimal sedimentary disturbance, while some of the evidence at FxJj 1 and 3, although ambiguous, indicates the possibility of effective fluvial disturbance and rearrangement of site materials. Likewise, FxJj 16, 18GL, 33, and 63, while all in coarser-grained, channel contexts of various sorts, also appear to have been affected to varying degrees by sedimentary processes: FxJj 33, in a shallow sand wash, appears to have been affected most severely, while FxJj 63, although moderately winnowed, appears to retain more of its behavioral integrity. The results of these studies, in combination with strong evidence from con joining studies showing the tight spatial array of debris from artifact manufacture at some sites (Bunn et al. 1980; Kroll n.d.; Kroll and Isaac 1984; Schick 1984), indicate that the some of Koobi Fora sites from floodplain context are sufficiently free from reworking by hydrological forces to justify continued search for other forces responsible for the material patterns at hand. It is a selected set of sites from such floodplain contexts that is presently undergoing the most intensive examination for signs of formative agencies. Sites as Home Bases? Up until 1980, the dominant hypothesis advocated in the archaeological literature for the formation for these early occurrences would appear to be some version of the "camp" concept. That is, early sites were conceived as places where groups met on a regular or even daily basis and carried out a variety of activities, including the consumption of meat and probably other</page><page sequence="50">50 NICHOLAS TOTH AND KATHY D. SCHICK foodstuffs. Such a site has been variously termed a living floor (Leakey 1971), a camp (Leakey and Lewin 1977), a home base (Isaac 1976a, 1978a,b), or simply a central place (Isaac 1984). Perhaps the most detailed set of social and behavioral inferences from the early archaeological record has been offered by Isaac (e.g., 1978a, 1978b, 1980). He hypothesized that early sites served as the centralized focus for transport and delayed consumption of food. Along with this, he has also inferred sexual division of labor in foraging activities, sharing of food resources at the home base, and probable enhancement of other social and communication activities among members of the foraging group. Since 1977 he has headed a team re search effort not only investigating the archaeological evidence at hand but also conducting active experimental and observational studies seeking to understand various site-formation processes. In these studies, hominid and nonhominid agencies alike have received serious consideration regarding relative input into site patterns (see Blumenschine 1984; Bunn 1982b; Bunn et al. 1980; Isaac 1981a, 1983, 1984; Schick 1984; Sept 1984; Toth 1982). Beyond the circumstantial evidence for this hypothesis, in the repeated coinci dence of artifacts and faunal remains at the same location, corroborative evi dence for some kind of a meaningful, functional association between the stones and the bones at some sites has now been derived from other evidence. That hominids were using stone artifacts to disarticulate and deflesh animal carcasses has now been extrapolated from 1. Cut marks made by stone tools. These have now been reported on faunal materials from sites at Olduvai Gorge and Koobi Fora (Bunn 1981, 1982b; Potts 1982; Potts and Shipman 1981; Shipman 1981, 1984). Positions of these striae appear to indicate disarticulation of joints, meat removal from bone, and also skinning operations on distal limb bones. In addition, possi ble evidence of breaking open of bones with stone percussors has been noted, but the problematic nature of reliably distinguishing this from car nivore fracture has been duly recognized (Bunn 1981, 1982b). 2. The microwear evidence for butchery activities reported by Keeley and Toth (1981) on a sample of flakes from archaeological sites at Koobi Fora indicate meat cutting activities conducted with unmodified stone flakes (discussed earlier). Tooth marks (gnaw marks, punctures, etc.) also evident on many of the bones have been interpreted as traces of carnivore action that took place before or after hominid exploitation of those animal parts (Bunn 1981, 1982b; Shipman 1986). Sites as Stone Cachesfor Meat Processing? An alternative to the home base hypothesis has been outlined by Potts (1982, 1984a), who proposed that the focus of these transport activities are caches of stone previously created by</page><page sequence="51">THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF PROTOHUMAN CULTURE 51 hominids. This hypothesis is claimed on grounds of conservation of energy, in that there is superior transport efficiency in carrying carcass parts to a deliber ately produced stone cache rather than moving materials between the more distant raw material sources and the exploited animal remains. This hypothesis purposefully omits the social and economic implications surrounding the home base hypothesis (i.e., food sharing, reciprocity, and intensive social interaction at the central place). Potts (1984a) does, however, adopt a view of incipient development of these features in his proto home base concept. Sites as Residues Left by Hominid Scavengers? Binford's spirited coun terarguments on the issue of the meaning of these stone-bone accumulations (1981, 1983, 1984) have questioned the logic of inference for many of these interpretations from the existing data base. He has argued that the body of behavioral interpretations that has been attributed to early archaeological sites, particularly the home base hypothesis and its many implications regarding devel oping social organization, are not justified by the evidence. At the bottom of Binford's reassessment of the issue is a fundamental question regarding the nature of the association between the stone artifacts and the faunal remains at early sites. In essence, he has opened a very active exploration of the question of the origin of the faunal deposits at these sites and has seriously considered carnivores as major agents in their formation. Binford (1981, 1983) approached the study of faunal remains at Olduvai sites from a comparative perspective, comparing and contrasting the composition of these assemblages with those produced by a number of known agencies in the modern world. He relied on the preliminary faunal tables compiled for the Olduvai sites (Leakey 1971) for his data on the taxonomic and element composi tion of their bone assemblages. For purposes of comparison he relied largely upon data he had collected on Alaskan wolf kill sites and dens, Nunamiut Eskimo dog yards, and Nunamiut kill and occupation sites (Binford 1978, 1981). In these comparisons, carried out primarily through factor analysis, he de tected a variety of patterns, many of which he interpreted as representing car nivore scatters or kill sites. Others departed significantly from patterns he would predict for carnivore-produced assemblages (Binford 1981:249-288). These bone assemblages, which he has found to contain relatively high proportions of lower limb bones, Binford has interpreted as produced by hominids scavenging bones from carnivore kill sites (Binford 1981; 1983:56-57) for their nutritious marrow content and relict dried meat. Some ultimate conclusions of this study (Binford 1981, 1983) were that the early archaeological record provides no conclusive evidence for hominid hunting activities or for the use of base camps to which food was transported for consumption and sharing. In his recent analysis of the Middle Stone Age faunal remains from Klasies River Mouth Cave in South Africa (Binford 1984), he has argued that this site, as well as many earlier</page><page sequence="52">52 NICHOLAS TOTH AND KATHY D. SCHICK Palaeolithic occurrences, appear to represent mid-day rest locations near water sources, where scavenged bones of larger mammals were processed and con sumed. Discussion Unanimous consensus on or resolution of these matters clearly has not yet been achieved. Nevertheless, some of these models can be eliminated as major formative agencies in some of the sites. The "hydraulic jumble" model may successfully be eliminated for at least some of the early sites based on conjoining studies and other analyses of site context. The "fortuitous association" model is also contradicted at some sites by evidence of butchery marks from stone tools on mammalian remains, for example, at FLK Zinj at Olduvai Gorge (Bunn 1982b; Potts 1982) and at Site FxJj 50 at Koobi Fora (Bunn 1982b). However, as Potts (1984) has pointed out, identifying agents which have modified bones does not necessarily indicate those which have accumulated them. Since evidence exists of bone modification by both hominid and carnivore agencies, major alternatives would appear to be reduced to some combination of carnivore-hominid accumulation, and subsequent hominid-carnivore modifica tion of these faunal remains. This impasse may be partly due to insufficient consideration of the known corpus of information on site-formation processes but is probably ultimately the result of the restricted size and scope of the data base at present. It is now becoming apparent that hominids and carnivores were both involved in some interaction with faunal remains at particular locales. If, in fact, hominids were developing a niche that was in direct competition with other carnivores, our ancestral line may have even helped shape the evolutionary development and niche differentiation among the competing lines. In any case, if hominids were engaging in behavior and feeding patterns that converged on some aspects of those of carnivore predators or scavengers, it may well prove difficult to dis tinguish between a strictly hominid pattern and that of contemporaneous car nivores. We should not expect that early "hominid-induced" patterns of faunal accumulation, food extraction, or bone modification should necessarily follow precisely those seen in ethnographic or recent archaeological cases. Beyond the problems presented by the juxtaposition of faunal and artifactual materials at these sites, a separate question that demands consideration is posed by the mere concentration of artifacts at the site localities. Some of the sites, such as FxJj 50 or FxJj 20 at Koobi Fora, a great many of the Olduvai sites, such as FLK Zinj, DK, TK Upper Floor, TK Lower Floor, FC West Floor, and the sites at Melka Kunturd, contain over a thousand or even several thousands of artifacts. Other sites at Olduvai have yielded similar large quantities of artifacts in more vertically diffuse concentrations (e.g., FLK North Levels 1, 2; MNK Main; HWK East Levels 3-5). Along with flakes and fragments, these concentration</page><page sequence="53">THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF PROTOHUMAN CULTURE 53 generally involve large numbers of cores and additional quantities of unmodified manuports, entailing the transport in most cases of dozens, sometimes even hundreds, of pounds of lithic material altogether (e.g., Leakey 1971; Potts 1982). Are these merely palimpsests of materials brought in and abandoned through repeated occupations or use of that locale? If so, then it appears that we might suggest the repeated use of that locale by the stone-tool wielding hominids and may consider different models of how and why such lithic concentration were produced. Potts' (1982, 1984a) stone cache proposal argues for the superior conservation of transport energy when simultaneously using both stone and animal resources if stones are first cached in a small number of places, and then as carcasses or carcass parts are obtained they are brought to these locations. Computer simula tions of raw material and carcass extraction from specific sources indicated that energy could be saved if stone was transported from more distant sources and brought to a number of caches closer to areas where carcasses were being exploited. Although such caching behavior appears to be inconsistent with behavior patterns not only of nonhuman primates but of human foragers in tropical and subtropical latitudes (see Binford 1980), Potts' model for the development of these concentrations certainly warrants serious consideration. It attempts to model site formation within a foraging strategy format and avoids at the outset assumptions as to hominid social organization and other behaviors which may or may not also be involved in this strategy. It may prove difficult, however, to identify criteria to verify the stone cache model of artifact concentration in favor of other possible models, for instance, that these sites are by-products of behav iors revolving around these locales rather than deliberate caches. For instance, an alternative hypothesis for the production of such artifact concentrations would be that they are a natural outcome of the established propensity of these hominids to carry stone artifacts around with them as they moved from one place to another (Schick 1984; Toth 1982, 1985b). This perspective is gained from studies at Koobi Fora, where most stone materials used for artifacts were obtained from stream gravels and not from specific source locations as is the case for some of the Olduvai Gorge raw materials. A concept of systematic acquisition and cach ing of stone has, perhaps, been more readily modeled in the Olduvai situation, where the individual sources can be traced and the sites may be seen as subse quent cachements of these materials. On the basis of conjoining and technological studies of materials from Koobi Fora, it appears that many of these sites are fixed points on the landscape in a dynamic system of artifact manufacture, use, and transport activities. For exam ple, materials brought in and abandoned even at the relatively moderate-size Site FxJj 50 represent a complex mix of artifacts as diverse stages of lithic reduction (Schick 1984; Toth 1982, 1985). Most of the cores appear to have been flaked</page><page sequence="54">54 NICHOLAS TOTH AND KATHY D. SCHICK before their importation, many were then flaked further at the site, and most were removed from the site vicinity. Sites can be viewed, then, as loci where con centrations of materials develop and where stone imports exceed exports; that is, an import-export imbalance in stone artifact transport has produced recognizable sites where the imports have exceeded the exports, sometimes by a significant margin (Schick 1984). Such a system of movement and deposition of materials would be likely if hominids habitually carried potentially useful materials around with them "just in case' they might be needed and regularly stopped at certain locations on the landscape where, over time, they left behind more stone than they brought in (Schick 1984). In this sense, the site may be seen as a "store" of material, but one produced as a by-product of repeated activities at a locale rather than through intentional stockpiling activities. In any case, exactly why hominids left behind so much material at some sites is another interesting aspect of this question, and one that has not been fully answered. It would appear to be consistent with the repeated use of particular, favored locales on the landscape, probably due to some important benefit(s) they offered, whether in the form of food resource abundance, water availability, or protection. It has been suggested (Toth 1982) that other materials, perhaps foods, may have gained priority for transport upon vacating the site locale. Another possibility might be that the prospect of forag ing in the vicinity of sites in particularly favorable locales provided some security regarding immediate raw material availability, and so reduced the propensity to draw materials away from the site (Schick 1984). We do not yet have enough carefully constructed, widely disseminated, schol arly syntheses of diverse formation processes that would permit a consensus on the fundamental issues raised here, on the meanings of faunal remains at sites or the significance of these artifact concentrations. In addition to the research out lined above, studies of the background distribution of both paleontological and artifactual materials in ancient deposits, such as have been conducted by Isaac (Isaac 198 lb; Isaac and Harris 1975) for the past several years, will be useful in assessing the special attributes of the larger-scale deposits identified as sites. The accuracy of our interpretations will ultimately depend not only on the detail of the archaeological data set used but also on the reliability of purportedly diag nostic criteria for distinguishing patterns created by hominid agencies from those produced by nonhuman agencies. For instance, do we have full documentation of the conditions and attributes of natural faunal accumulations? What range of pattems regarding taxonomic diver sity, body part representation, numbers of individuals, accumulation density, bone breakage, and surface modification are observed at attritional death as semblages, mass death assemblages, and in kill assemblages from a range of carnivore sizes, species, and intraspecific groups? What patterns in these at tributes are produced by different human groups? How does the nature of a faunal assemblage change during the processes of burial and fossilization?</page><page sequence="55">THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF PROTOHUMAN CULTURE 55 If future developments in the field permit and promote construction of power ful syntheses of comparative information, we would have a sounder substrate on which to construct and test models of early hominid behavior. The authors strongly urge others in the field to engage in the demanding but essential task of compiling information already gathered in relevant areas of research (e.g., hunt er-gatherer studies, primate-foraging research, and processes of bone accumula tions and modification by human and nonhuman agencies) into thoughtful, crit ical syntheses from an archaeological perspective, for inclusion in either this series or other volumes of wide dissemination and interest. If these were done thoughtfully and conscientiously, and without preconceived bias for any particu lar model, we should produce powerful tools for developing and evaluating models for the formation of our archaeological sites. STUDIES OF SPATIAL CONFIGURATIONS The patterns of spatial configurations of materials at early sites have been a subject of interest and investigation for some time (see Carr 1984; Kroll n.d.; Kroll and Isaac 1984, for recent overviews of site spatial analysis). In particular, ever since the methodological advance of horizontal, large-scale excavation pro moted by Mary Leakey at African sites, especially during the 1960s and 1970s, the arrangements and spatial associations among objects has been a tantalizing but challenging field of analysis. A great deal of the time and effort expended in excavating these sites is devoted to the retrieval and sometimes tedious prove nience documentation of even minute fragments of bone and stone. At Koobi Fora sites, data was collected on the three-dimensional location of all materials. The assumption is that this infonnation can provide valuable information regard ing on-site behaviors, and in any case, it should not be destroyed or lost. Development of Spatial Analysis of Early Sites The compilation of horizontal plots of material from early sites has been produced by Leakey (1971) in her monograph on the archaeology of the lower beds at Olduvai Gorge. The earlier approach to the analysis of such distributions, either in the field or from sketch plots of excavated materials, was conducted largely on impressionistic grounds and focused on patterns of fairly broad scale. Site spatial patterns were discerned which resembled those produced in later archaeological periods or in modern times by specific sorts of activities. Two possible "features" which have been noted and interpreted within the early record include the stone circle, or ring of large lava blocks, at DK at Olduvai Gorge and the overall pattern of debris at FLK Zinj at Olduvai. The latter consists of a relatively dense concentration of artifacts and fragmented bone, bordered by an area with very low material density, and finally surrounded</page><page sequence="56">56 NICHOLAS TOTH AND KATHY D. SCHICK by an outer scatter of larger materials. The stone circle phenomenon at DK has sometimes been cited as possibly representing supports for a crude shelter or windbreak. The pattern at FLK has also been suggested as possible evidence of a windbreak, which might have occupied the relatively barren area separating an inner occupation area (with smaller, primary refuse) from the outer scatter (of larger, secondary refuse) (see Leakey 1971). Such inferences are based upon intuitive comparisons with modern examples, and, like many intuitions, they may or may not be correct. To date neither strong corroborative nor contradictory evidence for these inferences has been advanced. Interpretive Studies In several studies, archaeologists have been looking in greater detail at certain features of site spatial configurations: their overall shape and size, as well as the spatial density and type of materials involved. In two independent studies, Ohel (1977) and Davis (1978) found some basic intrasite differences in spatial config urations within Leakey's site plots from Olduvai Gorge. Ohel distinguished two major types of patterns: (1) circular concentrations with many bone fragments and many small artifacts and debitage, which he interpreted as areas for food consumption, and (2) elongate, more diffuse con centrations with fewer artifacts and greater quantities of large bones, which he interpreted as areas for carcass dismemberment or food processing. Davis detected somewhat similar sorts of patterns in his study of Olduvai plots and made very similar inferences from them, though he also added a pattern type consisting of very sparse remains, which he interpreted as representing sleeping areas. Again, such interpretations are based largely upon intuition. As of yet, such studies have not offered further traces to aid in evaluating such inferences. Of course, some natural and perhaps even artificial features that may have helped to organize activities spatially, such as shade trees, bushes, simple windbreaks, or substrate differences, may be ever elusive to analysis. Some research has been devoted to the distribution of diverse artifact clalses (Davis 1978) in the hopes of finding toolkits indicative of specific activities. A variety of analytical techniques have been used in discerning and measuring the co-occurence of particular artifact types at archaeological sites. There are, of course, some necessary problems in assigning functional meaning to such asso ciations. After such co-occurrences have been identified, interpreting the ar tifacts involved as toolkits is necessarily an inference derived from the spatial data and the typological designations used in classifying the tools. Even if certain groupings of artifacts do, in fact, represent discrete activity areas of a site, we must know the functions of the tools to understand the nature of the toolkits. As noted previously in the discussion of early stone technology, the functions of these artifacts cannot be presupposed from an imposed typological classification.</page><page sequence="57">THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF PROTOHUMAN CULTURE 57 Most artifacts from the period are in materials not amenable to current methods of microwear analysis. Thus, studies which identify areas rich in choppers or scrapers within these early sites, although such evidence is certainly intriguing and possibly of functional significance, in no way demonstrate that chopping or scraping activities actually took place at these site locales. In recent years intensive computer-assisted analysis has been carried out on the spatial arrangement of materials at the Koobi Fora sites (Bunn et al. 1980; Kroll n.d.; Kroll and Isaac 1984). As this research is currently in progress, only preliminary results can be presented here. Some regularity has been noted in the dimensions of spatial arrays of materials within well-preserved excavated sites, with overall scatters ranging from approximately 5 m to 20 m in diameter, and areas of denser concentration within these between 1 or 2 m and 7 m in diameter (Isaac 1984). Smaller stone material tends to be concentrated within the denser areas of distribution. As direct evidence of on-site artifact manufacture, conjoin ing studies have now documented knapping areas at some early sites at Koobi Fora, such as FxJj 50 and FxJj 20 (Bunn et al. 1980; Kroll n.d.; Kroll and Isaac 1984; Schick 1984). In addition, the spatial arrays of many of these conjoining artifact sets match well the size and shape of spatial patterns of debitage pro duced in knapping experiments (Bunn et al. 1980; Schick 1984), indicating little postoccupational disturbance. Kroll's (Kroll and Isaac 1984) study deals not only with delineating patterns of horizontal and vertical distribution of materials at early sites, but deals with evidence of conjoining among stones and bones in discerning interrelated spatial units. Her research attempts to explicitly consider the effects not only of hominid behaviors but also a variety of other agencies in producing site patterns. It seems evident that we require a better understanding of the process-product relationships active in creating intrasite spatial patterns of material. Along with this, we need to establish additional diagnostic criteria to help substantiate in ferences made from the pattems at hand. Still, if interesting and statistically significant patterns can be identified, this is an important first step in describing and delineating spatial distributions of site materials. The relative impact upon site patterns of hominid behaviors and a host of nonhominid agencies can then be evaluated. ENVIRONMENTAL RECONSTRUCTION AND LAND-USE PATTERNS Much of the recent research on paleoenvironments and paleoclimate in this period has been directed towards (1) determining the paleogeography and sedi mentary regime of early archaeological and hominid fossil site localities and their surrounding regions; (2) reconstructing vegetational and faunal components of</page><page sequence="58">58 NICHOLAS TOTH AND KATHY D. SCHICK the environment; (3) reconstructing aspects of the climate and hydrological bal ance of the system, such as the degree of salinity and alkalinity, temperature, and shifts between wetter and drier conditions; (4) determining possible patterns of seasonality at prehistoric sites; and (5) discerning large-scale patterning of ar chaeological sites on the Paleolithic landscape. Important sources of evidence for examining many of these questions have included not only stratigraphic and geological analysis of site environs and local sedimentary basins, but also studies of more particular environmental traces, such as palynological analysis, faunal analysis, and chemical studies such as oxygen isotope analysis. Some attention has also been devoted to evidence of seasonality within local deposits, although this has proven more elusive and somewhat difficult to establish. Paleogeography and Sedimentary Context: Biases in the Record At the outset, it is necessary to point out the obvious biases of the sedimentary record. The stratigraphic record available for this period documents primarily (1) sedimentary basins with alluvial and lacustrine deposits in East Africa, (2) lime stone cave deposits in South Africa, and (3) stream and beach deposits in North Africa. There is a built-in bias, then, in the difference in sedimentary regimes in diverse parts of the continent. East Africa has, overall, the best preservation of occupational debris left on landform surfaces and subsequently incorporated within alluvial sediments; many, though not all, of these sediments appear to have been deposited under relatively gentle, low-energy circumstances. The sites in North Africa are generally within fairly high-energy deposits, probably re deposited through stream or beach processes. The limestone solution caverns in South Africa appear to represent a somewhat special sedimentary circumstance, with much of the contained material (fossil and artifactual) probably washing in through openings from the ground surface, but with some of it perhaps represent ing occupations or activities carried out (by hominids and other animals) within the underground caverns. The earliest sites in East Africa are primarily from sedimentary basins at low to moderate elevations. For instance, Olduvai Gorge is located within a basin in the Serengeti Plain, at a present elevation of around 1200-1500 m (Hay 1971). The early sites at Olduvai (Bed I and Lower Bed II) are located on relatively flat terrain, which was periodically flooded, surrounded by forested highlands on the south, east, and north (Hay 1976a:219, 223). Both the lower Omo basin in southern Ethiopia and the Koobi Fora basin in northern Kenya appear to be part of another tectonic depression (the Turkana depression) of the Eastern Rift Val ley (Howell 1976).</page><page sequence="59">THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF PROTOHUMAN CULTURE 59 There is relatively little early record for hominid occupation of highland areas. Of course, if they had utilized such environments, chances of discovering some record of this would be relatively poor, due both to the paucity of sedimentation in these more erosive regimes and, probably, to the rarity of exposure or discov ery of any pockets of sediment which may have been preserved. For example, if it were not for the sample of South African cave breccias, initially uncovered by mining activities, there would be no known evidence of hominid occupation of the veldt highlands (or any other environment) in this part of the continent. As the adage goes, "absence of evidence is not necessarily evidence of absence." There is, for example, a relative lack of fossil pongids from the Pliocene and Pleistocene, ostensibly because fossils do not normally preserve well in tropical forests, leaving virtually undocumented the evolutionary development of chim panzees and gorillas during this period. A distinctive move by hominids into the cooler highland zones in East Africa is not seen in the prehistoric record until later in the Pleistocene, as documented at the site of Gadeb on the Ethiopian plateau by Clark and Kurashina (1979). They have suggested that this move may have been made possible by controlled use of fire. Clark and Kurashina suggest that in Ethiopia, at the time of early occupation at Gadeb and at Melka Kenture as well (perhaps by 1.5 m.y.a.), we are seeing hominids venturing out of tropical and subtropical grasslands and steppes and into montane grassland and forest-savanna ecotones. Gadeb, on the west side of the south-east plateau, is at a significantly high elevation of over 2300 m. Common elements, then, of environments in which the majority of the early sites and hominid fossils have been found, indicate hominid habitation at least within sedimentary basins in the vicinity of streams and lakes. As indicated above, if hominids were also occupying and depositing artifacts in more erosive upland zones, archaeological visibility would of coursebe minimized and would probably depend upon the discovery of localized sedimentary deposits. In addi tion to evidence of geological and geomorphological settings of these sites (e.g., Behrensmeyer 1982; Bishop 1978; Butzer 1982), important paleoecological in formation has been collected from evidence of the fauna and flora in Plio Pleistocene times, as discussed next. Reconstructions of Fauna and Flora The overall picture derived from geological, faunal, and floral evidence at fossil and site localities in East and South Africa suggests a variety of local environments, including treeless and wooded savannah as well as open and more closed woodland (Boaz 1977). The sites in the Eastern Rift Valley exhibit evi dence of the "mosaic" vegetation patterns evident in much of the Rift today: dry savannah and open woodland-savannah with forest development along major</page><page sequence="60">60 NICHOLAS TOTH AND KATHY D. SCHICK drainages (Isaac 1984). In South Africa, as well, the environmental picture seems to be that of dry grassland and scrub, with more bush cover evident at the earlier site of Sterkfontein than at the later sites of Swartkrans and Kromdraii (Butzer 1982). Habitat reconstructions in the early record have depended largely upon the fossil animal communities, particularly those inferred from vertebrate as semblages. The fauna in Africa at this time has been described overall as a savanna-mosaic mammal community (Behrensmeyer 1982; Van Couvering 1980) involving a range of species adapted to an integrated set of habitats with grassland, open or continuous woodland, and bush. This community of animals and plants had replaced the Miocene rain forest community over much of Africa by the Plio-Pleistocene, by which time hominids also appear to have become consistent members of the community. By the time of the Plio-Pleistocene boundary, the communities of flora and fauna appear to have become "struc turally identical to modem savanna-mosaic communities" (Van Couvering 1980:297). Animals typically found in these environments, and characteristic of archae ological site locales, include a predominance of bovids (such as antelope, wilde beest, gazelle, and buffalo), a variety of pigs, equines, giraffes, elephants, hippos, rhinos, a range of carnivores (large cats and saber-toothed tigers, hyena forms, dogs, jackals, and foxes), a number of other primates (particularly ba boons and other monkeys), porcupines, hares, and rodents. In addition, a variety of nonmammalian fauna have been found at early archaeological sites, including birds, lizards, tortoises, crocodiles, turtles, snakes, fish, and molluscs (Bunn 1982b; Isaac 1982a; Leakey 1971; Potts 1982). Based upon the modem habitats of similar taxa, the animals represented at the sites often derive, then, from a variety of ecological zones, ranging from grassland forms to woodland and aquatic or water-dependent forms. Pollen does not tend to survive extremely well in alkaline environments char acteristic of the Plio-Pleistocene in much of East Africa, presumably due to severe seasonal fluctuations between wet and dry periods rather than the chem ical environment per se (R. Byrne, personal communication, 1985). Nev ertheless, a good deal of palynological research has been conducted, largely by French palynologists, within sediments at the early archaeological and fossil localities in East Africa, with some positive results regarding regional and local vegetation structure and climate. A pattern perceived by Vincens (1980) in pollen spectra from Koobi Fora indicates a shift between 2.1 and 1.8 m.y.a. to a colder, dryer climate, which would seem to correspond to the drying conditions indicated by isotopic evi dence, as mentioned below. A similar, perhaps correlated, drying pattern had been previously detected by Bonnefille (1976) in pollen from the Omo basin, where there appears to be a shift from more humid, montane forest vegetation</page><page sequence="61">THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF PROTOHUMAN CULTURE 61 present at about 2.5 to 3 m.y.a. to more drought-resistant forms by about 2 m.y.a. Following this period of relatively dry conditions, Vincens (1980) has noted a cooling peak with a return to a more humid climate after 1.8 m.y., perhaps continuing to the relatively humid climatic period detected by Bonnefille (1976) at approximately 1.5 m.y. At the time of these sites, vegetational patterns were significantly different from those found in the region today; although grasses dominated and many modern tree genera were present (e.g., Acacia, Commiphora, and Salvadora), shrub and tree cover was apparently more dense than at present, and a high proportion of montane elements indicate highland forests extended down to lower elevations than at present. Pollen has also been recovered from a sample of sediments just below the archaeological horizon of Site FxJj 50 at Koobi Fora and dated to approximately 1.5 m.y.a. These patterns indicate a semiarid, wood ed savannah dominated by grasses with Acacia and Commiphora trees along with some Ficus, or fig, while adjacent plateaus were apparently covered with juniper forests (Bunn et al. 1980; Vincens 1979). Isotopic Evidence for Climatic Change Patterns can be seen in oxygen isotope composition of carbonates that give further indication of climatic conditions and changes over time, since the 180 content of meteoric water is predicted to be higher in more arid times. For example, research by Cerling et al. (1977) has suggested an abrupt climatic change from more humid to drier conditions at 1.8 to 2.0 m.y.a. in the Koobi Fora region and at Olduvai Gorge approximately 0.5 m.y.a. The drying trend at Koobi Fora approximately 2.0 m.y.a. corroborates the indications from the pollen evidence, as noted earlier (Vincens 1980). Jo Ann Gutin and Paul Abell (Gutin, personal communication 1985) are currently designing a program of research to investigate possible oxygen isotope evidence in lacustrine shells for increasing seasonality over time from the Oligocene to the Lower Pleistocene in Africa. Site Environments and Land Use: Case Studies Some specific details of local stratigraphy and depositional situations in the early record have been provided by intensive research in the respective sedimen tary basins (for summary and overview of this research consult Behrensmeyer 1982; Bishop 1978; Butzer 1982). A common element, as has already been discussed, is evidence of occupation of sedimentary catchments in the vicinity of streams and lakes.</page><page sequence="62">62 NICHOLAS TOTH AND KATHY D. SCHICK Environments at Olduvai Gorge and Hominid Behavior Extensive geological research by Hay (1973, 1976b) at Olduvai Gorge has provided not only comprehensive analysis of the chronology and stratigraphy of this sedimentary basin but also reconstructions of the local environments of the archaeological sites along with consideration of implications of these environ ments for activities and lifeways of the hominid inhabitants. The climate appears to have been semiarid but wetter than at Olduvai today. Hay's lithofacies analy sis revealed that the earliest (Bed I) sites were located on a floodplain on the eastern margin of a shallow lake basin. All hominids and most occupation sites from this bed were found in lake-margin deposits on the eastern side of the lake; only two sites were discovered on the western margin (Hay 1976a, 1976b; Howell 1978). Salinity (as measured by mineralogical evidence and isotopic values) fluctuated inversely over time with size of the lake, which was least saline at the southeastern edge, where freshwater streams were feeding into the closed lake basin (Hay 1973). At the time of Bed II occupations, the geographic distribution of sites ex panded, and their placement shifted to locations along ephemeral stream chan nels feeding into a now more saline playa lake (Hay 1976b). At the time, the lake was shrinking in size and shifting eastward. Hay's study of source locations for artifactual materials also revealed an interesting pattern: proceeding from Bed I into Bed II times, proportionally more raw material was brought in from more distant sources. Isaac (1984) has discussed this extension of ranging patterns as understandable in view of greater scarcity of water and other resources in the more arid conditions of Bed II times. This may perhaps be the case, but the observed pattern could also be explained by other factors which might have been operating by Bed I1 times. For instance, perhaps there was a greater overlap or intersection among ranges of different stone-transporting hominid groups or even more deliberate stone procurement and transport by Bed II times. As of yet there have been relatively few seasonality studies carried out on evidence from early archaeological sites, largely because good criteria for determining season of occupation have not yet been established for this period. Nevertheless, an at tempt to discern possible seasonal patterns was made by Speth and Davis (1976) in an analysis of faunal remains from sites in Beds I and II at Olduvai Gorge. Based upon comparisons with seasonal predation patterns among the !Kung, Speth and Davis reported clear patterning in Olduvai-site faunas which they felt had seasonal significance; some they grouped as "wet-season" sites (4 in stances), that is, those rich in the turtle Chelonia (the dominant !Kung prey during the rainy season); others appeared to be "dry-season" sites (18 cases), that is, those rich in bovids and carnivores (which the !Kung hunt during the dry season). They suggest that if reoccupation occurred at these sites, it seems to</page><page sequence="63">THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF PROTOHUMAN CULTURE 63 have occurred in the same season repeatedly, since there is fairly discrete separa tion in patterning between the two types of sites. While ecological differences between the prehistoric Olduvai habitats and the !Kung environment would seem to limit the validity of this comparative study, patterns of this sort warrant further investigation. Evidence from Koobi Fora: Patterns of Environmental Distribution The Koobi Fora sites were deposited in a sedimentary basin in northern Ken ya, which Brown (1982) has now linked with the lower Omo Valley sequence, each being part of the same large-scale depositional system. The hominids and the archaeological sites at Koobi Fora have been recovered from floodplain, channel, lake-margin, and delta floodplain deposits (Isaac and Harris 1978). Paleochannels here characteristically have sandy or silty bed load and appear to be intermittent streams or delta distributaries (Behrensmeyer 1976). Studies of fossil distributions by Behrensmeyer (1975, 1978a) and of archae ological site distributions by Isaac and Harris (1978) revealed intriguing pattern ing in environmental locations of these traces. Behrensmeyer found that, while robust and gracile hominid forms were found in nearly equal abundance near the paleolake margin, robust forms were more than three times as abundant as gracile forms in channel contexts. It is not clear whether this pattern is due to taphonomic factors, habitat differences, sampling error, or some other reason. Isaac and Harris (1978) have observed that the locations of hominid fossils at Koobi Fora are primarily in sediments deposited near the lake margin, while archaeological sites are found primarily further toward the outer edge of the sedimentary basin. They have reasoned that this need not necessarily indicate regional differences in activities or occupation, but could simply be a result of better raw-material availability and hence site visibility inland in the vicinity of cobble-laden streams (Isaac 1984). A question here might be why more stone and tools were not transported and deposited in greater quantities closer to the lake, as appears to be more characteristic of behavior patterns at Olduvai Gorge. A likely answer might lie in the greater transport distances between raw material sources and the lake margin at Koobi Fora than was the case at Olduvai Gorge (Toth 1985). Isaac (198 1b) has undertaken a long-term study of the distribution of artifacts and bones along erosion scarps at Koobi Fora. This work has colloquially gone under the rubric of studies of the "scatters between the patches." The purpose is to document the background distribution of bones and stones and to investigate how anomalous are the apparently dense occurrences that we call "sites." Re sults of this study so far would indicate that the excavated site locales appear to represent quite unusual features within the stratigraphic horizons they sample,</page><page sequence="64">64 NICHOLAS TOTH AND KATHY D. SCHICK although between these larger concentrations are found small-scale concentra tions of similar materials as well as background scatter of isolated or very low density finds. This study may yield important information regarding larger-scale landscape use, particularly in areas where fairly detailed stratigraphic resolution might be achieved. A great deal of headway has already been made in reconstructing early site environments and ecology, primarily due to the interdisciplinary efforts of some large-scale and long-term research projects in African paleoanthropology. Fine scale resolution of many aspects of these environments has been difficult to achieve, at least in part because the period is so remote and the data base often scanty. While there is need and demand for greater resolution in our paleoen vironmental reconstructions, many basic environmental parameters are fairly well established. These have provided a substrate for much of the recent research on hominid diet discussed next. DIET Documenting the dietary patterns of early hominids is an essential part of understanding their evolutionary history (see Isaac 1971). The spread of homi nids throughout the Old World during the Pliocene and Pleistocene must be highly correlated with dietary shifts and technological adaptations as these crea tures encountered new environments and potential foodstuffs. During the early Pleistocene the prehistoric record documents the success of one lineage that is known to have coexisted with Homo in time and space: the robust australopithe cines. Both were evolutionary experiments in bipedalism, both successful for hundreds of thousands of years, yet only one ultimately survived. Did different dietary patterns play an important part in this story of success and failure? Robinson's dietary hypothesis (1963) argued, based upon comparative ana tomy, that the evolutionary divergence between South African robust and gracile australopithecines was due to dietary differences: the robust form ("Paranthro pus") was essentially a more specialized vegetarian, while the gracile form, thought to be closer to the Homo lineage, had a more omnivorous diet that included significant consumption of meat. This was an important early attempt to explain evolutionary change due to dietary adaptations. Although his phy logenetic scheme has not been supported by subsequent investigations, Robin son's interpretations of dietary niches based upon comparative morphology are still widely accepted. A major emphasis in paleoanthropology since 1970 has been the search for clues to help reconstruct early hominid dietary patterns. This has happened alongside a growing interest within archaeology in constructing ecological mod els of subsistence patterns, such as in optimal foraging theory, which considers</page><page sequence="65">THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF PROTOHUMAN CULTURE 65 such variables as diet breadth, foraging space, feeding period, optimal group size, and the overall cost-benefit functions of different foraging strategies (e.g., Perlman 1980; Smith 1983; Winterhalder and Smith 1981). A hypothetical list of potential foodstuffs that early hominids could have exploited includes such items as fruit, berries, nuts, seeds, legumes, melons, leaves, bark, sap, gum, shoots, buds and flowers, roots, tubers, corms, rhi zomes, fungi, and algae from plant sources; meat, fat, hide, marrow, viscera, blood, and brains from vertebrates, as well as edible parts of numerous inverte brates, such as insects and molluscs. Other foodstuffs of animal origin could have included eggs and honey. A number of lines of inquiry have been pursued in reconstructing early homi nid diet, some stressing modem comparative analogues and others the actual prehistoric evidence. Both of these approaches are discussed next. Studies of Bones from Archaeological Sites Probably the one area of protohuman archaeology that has generated the most excitement and controversy recently has been the construction of behavioral and dietary inferences from faunal remains at prehistoric sites. Unlike most plant matter, animals can, under the right conditions, leave tangible evidence of their presence in the form of fossilized bones at early archaeological sites. If hominids were involved in utilizing edible parts of animals for food, then there should be patterns of collection or modification that can be recognized in the prehistoric record. With the luxury of hindsight, it seems almost incredible that so little attention was generally paid to bone modification and body-part representation until recent years, with some notable exceptions, such as Dart (1953). Probably the main reasons for this were a lack of knowledge about taphonomic processes and the often tacit assumption that bones from archaeological sites were obvious by products of human diet or technology (Binford 1981). As noted above, based primarily upon the co-occurrence of bones and stones at early archaeological sites in Africa, many researchers, such as Dart (1953), Leakey (1971), and Isaac (1969; Isaac and Crader 1981), have suggested that these sites represent behavioral residues of hominids consuming meat, either hunted or scavenged, at some central place, home base, or camp. Since the question of the agencies accumulating these bones has been discussed earlier in this chapter, we address here two specific lines of argument regarding the possi ble significance of these faunal deposits for hominid diet and subsistence: (1) evidence for food-procurement activities, and (2) various arguments for scaveng ing by early hominids. Detailed analyses of the faunal remains from Plio-Pleistocene East African sites have recently been reported by Bunn (1981, 1982b, 1983b) and Potts (1982,</page><page sequence="66">66 NICHOLAS TOTH AND KATHY D. SCHICK 1984a, 1984b). Bunn analyzed 11 sites from Koobi Fora and 4 from Bed I at Olduvai Gorge; Potts analyzed 5 sites from Bed I at Olduvai. The patterns that emerged from these studies include the following: 1. The fauna from most of these sites shows diverse mammalian taxa from a range of habitats. 2. Large mammals are usually well represented, with animals of the size range of topi, wildebeest, and zebra predominant. 3. Teeth and limb shafts are normally the best represented body parts, with elements such as vertebra, scapula, and pelvis poorly represented. 4. Limb bones are usually highly fragmented. 5. Most sites show striations interpreted as tool cut marks, as well as others interpreted as toothmarks made by carnivores on some bones. 6. These cut marks are often found characteristically in particular areas of the skeleton; for example, at FLK Zinj at Olduvai, Bunn (1982b) observed that relatively high proportions of certain bones had cut marks (the distal and prox imal humerus and the proximal radius-ulna of small mammals, and the distal metatarsal, distal humerus, and proximal radius-ulna of larger mammals). Many of these cut marks are found in anatomical positions that are consistent with activities such as skinning, dismembering, and removing meat from bones (Bunn 1982). Both Bunn and Potts infer that these butchery marks are indicative of meat and marrow processing by early hominids, but neither precludes scavenging as a major means of their acquisition. Bunn (1982b) concludes that these patterns, along with apparent transport of these animal remains to the site, give support to the food-sharing model of site fdrmation. On the other hand, Potts suggests that these patterns indicate acquisition and transport of animal remains to stone caches for processing and consumption, without necessarily invoking a home base model (Potts 1982, 1983, 1984a). Binford's (1981) analysis of the composition of faunal assemblages from Olduvai Gorge produced a scavenging model for early hominid activities repre sented at these sites, though he found no evidence to indicate hominid transport of procured carcass parts back to a central place (1981:294). His model entails the utilization by Hominids of carcasses which have already been heavily rav aged by other predators and scavengers. In South Africa, Vrba (1980) has examined the fossil bovids from the aus tralopithecine cave deposits of Sterkfontein and Swartkrans. She has proposed an interesting model for assessing whether animals responsible for collecting bones were predators or scavengers: low percentages of juveniles are more charac teristic of a scavenged assemblage, while high percentages of juveniles are more characteristic of a hunted assemblage; also, the distribution of animal weights in a hunted assemblage is more restricted due to the selective predation of preferred</page><page sequence="67">THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF PROTOHUMAN CULTURE 67 prey size, while scavenging is more opportunistic and will thus select a wider range of animal sizes. Vrba argued that the bovid evidence from South African cave deposits, when ordered chronologically, suggests initially, an assemblage accumulated by non hominid predators, with hominids included among the prey; later, a scavenged assemblage, with hominids perhaps as the principal scavenger; and finally, a hunted assemblage of a smaller size range, with hominids as the principal preda tor. This view has been corroborated by Brain (1981). Shipman (1983, 1986) has also explicitly considered a model of opportunistic scavenging among early hominids. Working on the premise that, based on docu mented cut-mark evidence on bones from some early sites, the bones and stones in these instances are causally associated and reflect food-procurement activities by the hominids, she has argued that criteria used by Vrba (broad size range and few juveniles) as well as additional criteria (broad range of habits and habits and a skew toward large animals) tend to support a subsistence model involving foraging and scavenging (Shipman 1983). Important actualistic studies have been carried out to help assess the likelihood of hominid scavenging and hunting activities in the Plio-Pleistocene. Modern East African landscapes have been analyzed to measure the relative abundance of scavengeable carcasses and the nutrients that could potentially be obtained by early hominids. Pioneering work by Schaller and Lowther (1969) has been elaborated by Blumenschine (1984) in his study of scavenging opportunities in modern East African parks, using optimal foraging theory to analyze nutritional yields from carcasses that could have been accessible to early hominids. From preliminary results of his study, Blumenschine (personal communication 1984) has suggested that there might be a dry season peak in hominid scavenging opportunity with regard to partially consumed lion kills in heavily wooded areas around water sources, or of whole carcasses resulting from natural deaths further away from water. In other circumstances, marrow and brain components of a carcasses would rise in importance and only small amounts of flesh would be available. From the results of these diverse studies, it appears certain that early hominids were exploiting some animal food soruces. It cannot be determined at present how much meat and marrow was consumed or the relative importance of scav enging and hunting activities in their subsistence patterns, although a scavenging model is currently favored. Plant Studies Based on ecological models of modern hunter-gatherers and primates, it is generally acknowledged that the majority of the caloric intake of early hominids must have been from plant food sources. Unfortunately, plant remains are not</page><page sequence="68">68 NICHOLAS TOTH AND KATHY D. SCHICK normally preserved at early Stone Age sites except in the occasional form of root casts, fossil pollen, or perhaps phytoliths. Even when such plant traces are recovered, it is difficult if not impossible to demonstrate that the plants repre sented were part of the hominid diet. Several researchers have attempted to model early hominid plant exploitation based on modem analogues. These studies have included that of Peters and O'Brien (1981) who, on the basis of data on modem primate feeding behavior, extrapolated an early hominid plant food niche of approximately 140-333 genera and speculated upon hominid competition with other primates such as chim panzees and baboons. Mann (1981) reviewed human diet in an evolutionary context and discussed possible reasons for speciation in the evolutionary record. Sept (1982, 1984) has examined modem East African environments to assess food resource possibilities for early hominids and has ranked food types in terms of calories/handling time (harvesting and preparation). One interesting conclu sion of her work is that the most diverse and nutritious plant foods were located along channel courses. Stahl (1984) discussed hypothetical hominid dietary se lection before the use of fire and evaluated toxins and indigestible plant foods. From this she has ranked plant foods in order of edibility without fire and suggested that early hominids probably required a steady source of animal pro tein in order to obtain their essential amino acids. Vincent (1985a, 1985b), has investigated the possible role of underground plant resources (roots, tubers, etc.) in early hominid foraging patterns by examining modem East African habitats, conducting harvesting experiments, and studying modem Hadza gatherers. Milton (1981) has discussed the overall trend toward increased intelligence within the primate line and has linked this phenomenon with the exploitation of plant foods with a patchy distribution. The location of such food resources must be remembered and transmitted in order to enhance foraging success; thus, selection would have tended to favor more intelligent forms. Milton has further suggested that within the hominid line this pattern may have been intensified in the savanna-mosaic environment to include greater quantities of mobile animal fdods in addition to sessile plant resources, producing even stronger selection for intelligence and communication abilities within our ancestral line. This hypoth esis would appear to suggest that a major factor in the evolution of intelligence in hominids, at least in the early stages, could be linked closely with changes in feeding behaviors and not necessarily with evolving technology. Studies of Digestion and Feeding Strategies In comparative studies of digestive tract differences among primates, Milton (1984) has noted that humans have a relatively greater volume in the smaller intestine than do apes, who show relatively greater volumetric capacity in the colon. She suggests that the enhanced volume of the human small intestine may</page><page sequence="69">THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF PROTOHUMAN CULTURE 69 indicate that the human gut is well adapted to the rapid processing of high-quality foods that can be digested and absorbed in passage through the small intestine. ("High quality" foods are those with a relatively high ratio of energy and nutrients to non-nutritive, indigestible bulk, and "low quality" foods are those with a relatively low ratio of accessible nutrients to indigestible matter). Further more, since high-quality foods have a more patchy distribution in a savanna mosaic environment than do food resources in a tropical forest, the successful exploitation of highly dispersed, high-quality foods may have depended to some extent upon significant exploitation of animal protein, as well as upon increased mobility to improve the efficiency of the food search (Milton 1984). Milton (personal communication 1985, 1986) has given further consideration to the significance of human gut morphology and its possible implications for early hominid evolution, including the divergent evolutionary pathways of the robust australopithecines and the Homo lineage. She would link the extinction of the robust lineage to a strong dependence upon a low-quality diet, which may ultimately have placed robust australopithecines in direct competition with more digestively specialized ungulates (e.g., Demment and Van Soest 1985), while the success of the larger-brained lineage may have been largely due to a more omnivorous feeding strategy involving a greater proportion of high-quality foods. Microwear on Stone Tools As has been previously mentioned, polishes on suitable stone tool edges can be interpreted along functional lines and may shed light on dietary behavior (Keeley and Toth 1981). Polishes interpreted as those produced in animal butch ery have been reported from Koobi Fora (corroborated by.cut marks on bones), and others have been inferred to be woodworking polishes and those produced by cutting soft plants. These plant polishes may be directly related to exploitation of plant foodstuffs, but they could also represent some nondietary activity, for instance, cutting bedding materials or providing a grit-free surface upon which to lay meat during butchery. Microwear on Hominid Teeth Several researchers have examined the teeth of fossil hominids, as well as teeth of modern animal forms whose diet is known, to try to infer the types of foods eaten by these protohumans (or more accurately, how much gritty material was in the diet that could produce striae, pits, and other forms of tooth-surface modification). This work includes studies by Walker (1980, 1981) and Teaford and Walker (1984) which suggest that hominids prior to Homo erectus were primarily fru</page><page sequence="70">70 NICHOLAS TOTH AND KATHY D. SCHICK givorous but that H. erectus had a more gritty diet, perhaps from digging up roots and tubers or consuming gritty meat. Grine (1981, 1984) has reported differences in tooth wear between gracile and robust australopithecine forms, the latter exhibiting more crushing and puncture-crushing, presumably from harder foods. Puech (1984; Peuch et al., 1983) has argued that H. habilis teeth exhibit few striations or pits, suggesting a soft, frugivorous diet, but that they also show etching which may indicate consumption of acidic plant foods. This line of inquiry appears to have great potential as a dietary indicator, particularly if analysis of a larger sample of hominid teeth throughout the world reveals major patterns of tooth wear. On a cautionary note, it is important that geological or diagenetic processes be excluded as agencies that produce striations and pitting; in East African studies, for example, the role of volcanic ash-fall particles in inducing atypical wear patterns must also be considered for many tuffaceous stratigraphic units. Chemical Studies of Bone Several chemical methods for making dietary inferences from bone have been applied to more recent archaeological sites and may have potential application to ancient fossil bone as well. These included studies of stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios (Chisolm et al. 1983; DeNiro and Schoeninger 1983; Parker and Toots 1980; Schoeninger and DeNiro 1982; van der Merwe and Vogel 1978; van der Merwe et al. 1981; Vogel and van der Merwe 1977). The ratio of 13C to 12C isotopes in animal tissues is largely a function of the types of plants eaten by that animal or by its prey (C3 or C4 plants depending upon their photosynthesis processes). Mass spectrometric analysis of ratios of 13C to '2C in archaeological animal remains allows reconstruction of certain aspects of basic dietary adaptations. C3 plants (with the C3 or Calvin, photo synthesis pathway) have a significantly lower '3C/12C ratio than do C4 plants (with the C4, or Hatch-Slack dicarboxylic, pathway). Thus, animals eating C3 plants (e.g., African savanna shrubs and trees) have a relatively much lower 13C/ '2C ratio in their tissues than those consuming significant amounts of either C4 plants (e.g., African savanna grasses and many plants of hot semiarid regions or cultigens such as maize, sugar cane, or sorghum) or marine animals, which are also rich in the 13C isotope. Collagen has been an important source of carbon isotope evidence chronicling some dietary shifts in prehistory, since it is often preserved in bone in more recent archaeological sites (Vogel and van der Merwe 1977; van der Merwe and Vogel 1978). In addition, '5N/I 4N isotope values can be an indication of the amount of meat eaten by an animal. Research into fossil bones using carbon and nitrogen isotopes is now being conducted by S. Ambrose (personal communication, 1985). If such isotopic differences can be shown to be preserved after hundreds of thousands or even millions of years and throughout</page><page sequence="71">THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF PROTOHUMAN CULTURE 71 the process of mineralization of fossil bones, this would become a valuable source of dietary evidence for the early prehistoric record as well. The ratio of strontium to calcium in bones has also been used as an indicator of the degree of carnivory in an animal and can, hypothetically, separate carnivores from herbivores and omnivores (Schoeninger 1980; Sillen 1981; Sillen and Ka vanaugh 1982; Toots and Voorhies 1965). Research in progress by A. Sillen (personal communication, 1984) suggests that this technique might be applicable to Plio-Pleistocene fossil bones as well. Paleopathology In one intriguing study, Walker et al. (1982) argued that a pathological condi tion was found in Koobi Fora hominid KNM-ER 1808, described as a Homo erectus. Bony growth on the leg bones has been provisionally diagnosed as chronic hypervitaminosis A, possibly caused by a long-term, ultimately fatal overdose of that vitamin. The authors have suggested that eating large quantities of raw liver (perhaps from a carnivore carcass) could have produced such a pathological condition and may thus be evidence of carnivorous behavior. Future Methods It is likely that new methodologies will be tested against the prehistoric record in attempts to reconstruct aspects of early hominid diet. These may include, for example, organic trace studies on stone tool surfaces or on the teeth of hominids themselves. These studies could potentially take the form of some biochemical analysis or the actual microscopic identification of organic structures. Studies by Loy (1983) claim to have identified species-specific hemoglobin traces on recent prehistoric tools in Canada; perhaps other techniques can be applied to early prehistoric material as well. Finally, if coprolites (fossil feces) retrieved from Plio-Pleistocene deposits can be demonstrated to be of hominid origin, they could potentially provide a wealth of information about diet in the form of microscopic organic structures found within them. For example, some fossil localities at the Omo have produced large numbers of animal coprolites (G. Eck, personal communication, 1984). SOCIAL BEHAVIOR As anthropologists, it should be of paramount interest to us to understand the development, complexity, and variation in social behavior throughout the course of hominid evolution. Unfortunately, most aspects of social behavior do not readily leave tangible clues in the prehistoric record. Division of labor, social</page><page sequence="72">72 NICHOLAS TOTH AND KATHY D. SCHICK bonds, dominance and leadership, reciprocity, ideology, communications sys tems, sexual behavior, rituals, music, modes of learning, and taboos would probably leave only very subtle traces, if any at all, for the prehistorian to decipher; the nature or state of development of these features are basically unknown for the early Stone Age. Nevertheless, several important and controversial theories about protohuman social behavior have been proposed, using such criteria as comparative anatomy, sexual dimorphism, and modem human and nonhuman behavioral analogues. For example, Lovejoy's (1981) theory for the origin of bipedalism (mentioned previously) asserted that bipedalism, monogamous bonds, male provisioning of females and infants, and a reproductive strategy geared toward longer-term in vestment in an offspring constituted an important, integrated set of features of hominid evolution. To date there have been relatively few instances in which very early archaeological evidence has been used to infer social behavior. Dart (1953) argued, based on patterns of bone modification and alleged trauma at prehistoric sites, that the australopithecines were instinctive "killer apes" and that modem humans were the beneficiaries of this heritage. This view was later popularized by Ardrey (1961). Brain (1981), as previously mentioned, was able to show that many of the patterns discerned by Dart within the bone accumula tions could be due to nonhuman forces such as carnivore activity. More recently, Isaac (1978a, 1978b) and Lancaster (1978) have elaborated on views presented by Lee (published 11 years later in 1979) and proposed a model of early hominid food sharing that would include elements of home base, or central place, foraging, meat eating, and a sexual division of labor, based on concentrations of stones and bones at early East African prehistoric sites. These views have been questioned by Binford (1981), as already discussed in this chapter. COGNITION AND INTELLIGENCE Some attempts have been made to get a reasonable idea of the mental abilities of early hominids. These have focused both on comparative anatomical and archaeological evidence. Comparative studies of endocasts of hominid brains and those of modern humans and other primates have been one avenue of investi gation. Holloway (1974, 1976, 1983), Holloway and de la Coste-Lareymondie (1982), and Falk (1980, 1983) have compared fossil brain endocast morphology to that of modern humans and pongids. These studies have considered cerebral organization and hemisphere dominance as well as the possibility of developed language capabilities. The results suggest that there may have been a major structural change in the Homo lineage, with more cranial asymmetry and better development of Broca's area, the brain center for language abilities. Holloway</page><page sequence="73">THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF PROTOHUMAN CULTURE 73 (1969) has also emphasized the cognitive similarities of tool making and language. Isaac (1976b) and Gowlett (1979) have maintained that the number of artifact types might be a relative indication of the level of cultural complexity of pre historic technologies, in addition to the amount of skill required to produce them. Although it is certain that the diversity and idiosyncratic nature of lithic indus tries has generally increased through time, there are many examples of recent hunter-gatherers who, with the full cognitive abilities of Homo sapiens sapiens, have produced very simple stone technologies with low diversity in artifact types (e.g., the Tasmanians). Thus, only minimal levels of the potential skill and abilities of a group can be deduced from the material culture it has produced. In a study by Wynn (1979), Piagetian criteria were applied to stone artifacts from the Oldowan and later Acheulean of East Africa to assess the level of cognitive development of the toolmaker. These criteria included symmetry of planform of the artifact, symmetry of cross section, and the ability to produce an arbitrary straight line or edge. These criteria were met by the biface-makers of the later Acheulean at Isimila (presumably Homo erectus or archaic Homo sa piens), but not by the hominids of Oldowan technology from Beds I and II at Olduvai Gorge. Wynn concluded that Acheulean hominids possessed sophisti cated mental capabilities while earlier Oldowan hominids did not. In his experimental studies of Oldowan technology at Koobi Fora, Toth (1982, 1985b) found that much of the stone technology from this period was a fairly causal affair, and that, to a large extent, it constitutes paths of least resistance in the production of cutting or chopping edges. As such, early stone technology only represents a minimal level of cognitive ability on the part of the toolmaking hominids and may not be a reliable indicator of their full mental abilities. How ever, it is clear that these hominids had a good intuitive sense of geometry in flaking stone: they were evidently adept in locating on their cores the acute angles and areas of high mass from which to detach flakes (also discussed by Gowlett 1984). In examining early stone assemblages, one is struck by the "6clean" and efficient detachment of flakes from cores by these hominids in contrast to modem beginners in stone knapping who, for the first few hours, often end up with little more than two battered "hammerstones" after bashing two cobbles together. Based upon his analysis of flakes from early archae ological sites (1.5-2.0 m.y. old), Toth has also suggested that the evident direction of core rotation during artifact manufacture may indicate preferential right-handedness in early toolmaking populations, possibly evidence of pro nounced lateralization of the brain by this time (Toth 1982, 1985a). Toth (1982, 1985b) has also noted that the organizational skills of early tool using hominids were much more complex than those seen in nonhuman primates. This is indicated by the archaeological evidence of curation and transport of stone for future use over substantial distances. Early stone technology can best be</page><page sequence="74">74 NICHOLAS TOTH AND KATHY D. SCHICK viewed as a simple curated one (sensu Binford 1979) in which stone tools or raw materials were habitually transported from location to location. Evidence of nonutilitarian behavior that might suggest ritual or a sense of the aesthetic is another possible line of inquiry when assessing early hominid mental abilities and sense of symbolism. Although reviews by Marshack (1972, 1976), Edwards (1978), Edwards and Clinnick (1980), and Oakley (1981) have noted intriguing evidence for possible symbolic behaviors from later phases of the Lower Paleolithic, no such traces have yet been identified as early as the 01 dowan. Dart (1974) noted that an unmodified jasperite cobble from Makapansgat appeared to have anthropomorphic features and might have been collected by australopithecines for this reason; Oakley (1981) also emphasized the reddish hue of this apparent manuport and speculated upon its possible symbolic signifi cance. Leakey (1971) also identified a "pecked and grooved" cobble from Site FLK North in Bed I of Olduvai Gorge that appeared to have baboon-like fea tures, but she pointed out that the resemblance was most probably coincidental. Without more evidence, none of these objects can conclusively be regarded at present as anything but natural. There has also been the suggestion that certain raw materials in the early Stone Age were selected for aesthetic reasons or at least due to some sense of curiosity. Hay (1976b) has pointed out that the preference for a green lava at some 01 dowan sites may have been due to its pleasing color. At Koobi Fora as well, artifacts found at some sites are occasionally in some exotic, colorful raw mate rial. In one case, a large flake of chert, brown with a brilliant orange band, was found at Site FxJj 20. No other example of this rock type was found in the extensive excavation. Although the flake was very fresh and sharp, and thus a prime candidate for microwear analysis (Keeley and Toth 1981), no use wear was apparent on this artifact. Suggestions as to selection of these materials for aesthetic reasons may well be flights of fancy, however, and are difficult to demonstrate. CONCLUSION Plio-Pleistocene archaeological research during the 1970s and early 1980s has stressed the critical analysis of the hard evidence from prehistoric sites. In this, there has been increasing use of comparative, actualistic studies of modem phenomena, such as experimentation, ethnoarchaeology, and ethology, in gener ating models to evaluate and explain prehistoric patterns. Since 1975, studies of the early archaeological record have gone far beyond the mere excavation of sites and the description and quantification of their lithic and faunal assemblages. In re-exploring many of the issues at hand in studies of</page><page sequence="75">THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF PROTOHUMAN CULTURE 75 early archeology, such as evidence for hominid diet, the nature and origin of artifact and bone accumulations, the nature of early stone technologies, and the use of resources available on the landscape, a wide-ranging search for applicable comparative models has intensified. And in using data from actualistic studies, it is becoming increasingly apparent that one should be very cautious when the sample of such analogues is quite small, since it might create a distorted or restricted picture of the full range of variability of the phenomena. Some archeologists, including Isaac (1984), have emphasized a Popperian approach to archeological investigation, considering multiple alternative hypoth eses to be tested against available data rather than focusing on a given or "pet" model to the near exclusion of others. Although Binford (1984:8) has criticized Isaac's actual implementation of multiple working hypotheses in his research designs and analytical procedures, it seems apparent that rarely has full and equal consideration been given by others to such alternative hypotheses. Ideally, future research and model building and testing will explore alternative models more rigorously. It is also clear that no matter how crisp our theoretical approaches and analyt ical methods, we are very much at the mercy of the preservation and recovery of the prehistoric evidence. Ultimately, better preservation provides a better chance of understanding what has happened prehistorically. The number of "prime" early Paleolithic sites, well excavated and well documented, with the association of fresh stone artifacts and well-preserved bone in low-energy sedimentary situa tions is not extensive. More emphasis should be placed on archaeological recon naisance and survey to find new localities with such evidence. Archaeology is, of necessity, a blend of inductive and deductive reasoning, and it is often new evidence, as well as new hypotheses, that change our conceptions and under standing of the prehistoric past. The ideal situation would perhaps be a Pompeii-like ash fall that buried a site at the time of occupation. This may seem farfetched, but probably no more so than the chances of finding fossilized, Pliocene hominid footprints, as at Laetoli. These types of fortuitous discoveries may yield unique behavioral clues which abandoned or geologically disturbed sites do not provide. At present archaeologists are by no means prepared to outline a historical sketch of any kind regarding what happened in the early stages of development of our lineage. There are far too many unknowns at present to attempt this. Our data base is, however, expanding, and we rely upon further excavations, analyses, and relevant actualistic studies to build a firmer foundation for our interpreta tions. Clearer patterns are emerging in some areas of inquiry and, overall, the com plexities involved in interpreting our very remote past are better appreciated. New hypotheses have been forwarded to explain patterning within our present data base, and these will likely receive further testing. Some new methodologies</page><page sequence="76">76 NICHOLAS TOTH AND KATHY D. SCHICK are being applied to the early archaeological record (e.g., microwear analysis of stone artifact toothwear studies, trace element analysis, SEM studies of bone modification, and isotope analysis of fossil bone), which should help better define criteria for making some of our inferences. We would predict that future research will place more emphasis on ecological models of protohuman adaptation, with hominid diet as a major area of investiga tion. The question of hominid scavenging versus hunting as an important feature of subsistence has emerged as a matter of widespread interest, and will most like be a focus of many future studies. In addition, the relative importance of animal versus plant foods in hominid diet could emerge as a problem of major concern and research in future years. The precise functions of stone tools is of critical importance in these studies, and analyses of various artifact types and raw materials should help provide valuable information as to the role of stone tools in our early prehistory. The ultimate goal of the study of protohuman archaeology is to document what happened over time and space and to explain why it happened. The evolution and radiation of the genus Homo is a fascinating and unique story in the history of life on earth, and its study entails incorporating findings from a great many sub disciplines. Documenting and understanding the course of this trajectory will demand both additional data gathering in the early phases of our prehistory and refinement of the methodologies we use to interpret the evidence at hand.
