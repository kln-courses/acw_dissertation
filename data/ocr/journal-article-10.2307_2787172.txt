This most welcome series of monographs on the religions of the world, the first four of which were issued in 1905 and noticed in MAN, 1906. 105, continues to make steady progress, while maintaining the high standard of excellence of which the opening volumes gave promise. These were followed last year by six others: Magic and Fetishism (Haddon), Hinduism (Barnett), Religion of Babylonia and Assyria (Pinches), and the three standing at the head of the present notice. Thanks to their frequent historic contacts and inter-relations, these naturally present many features in common, and may be conveniently discussed together. All the writers recognise one fundamental fact which had hitherto been over- looked or too little observed, although on it depends a right understanding of the composite character of the religious systems prevalent in Europe throughout historic times. When the proto-Aryan groups spread, probably at long intervals, westwards [ 74 ]</page><page sequence="2">1907.J MIAN. [No. 47. from the Eurasian steppe, they did not find the land a tabula rasa, but in many parts, as in Pannonia, Helvetia, Gaul, and Britain, already occupied by the men of the Stone Ages originally from North Africa. These were not exterminated, but for the most part Aryanised in speech and to some extent in general culture by the warlike invaders from the east, who, themselves for the most part worshippers of the personified forces of Nature and especially those of the upper regions, necessarily failed to extirpate the grosser beliefs, the demonologies, and chthonic deities of the indigenous populations. Hence the result was a blend of finer and coarser elements, which still persists in many places, often presenting the most violent contrasts between the lofty conceptions of the " Olympians " and the cruLde superstitions and magic practices of the votaries of the goddess Nerthus or Erthus and other terrestrial divinities (Tacitus). All this is well brought out and constantly borne in mind by Mr. Anwyl in his masterly essay on Celtic Religion in Pre- Christian Times, where he remarks that " nothing is clearer than the miarvellous persistence of traditional and immemorial " modes of thought, even in the face of conquest and subjugation, and, wha,tever ideas on religion the Aryan coniquerors of Celtic lands may have brought with them, they, " whose conquests were often only partial, could not eradicate the inveterate beliefs of " their predecessors, and the result in the end was doubtless some coinpromise, or else the victory of the earlier faith " (p. 5). And again, " The more the scainty remnants " of Celtic religiot are examined, the clearer it becomes that many of its characteristic " features had been evolved during the vast period of the ages of stone . . . We are thus compelled, from the indications which we have of Celtic religion, in the names of its deities, its rites, and its survivals in folk-lore and legeiid, to come to " the conclusion that its fundamental groundwork is a body of ideas, similar to those " of other lands, which were the natural correlatives of the phases of experience through which man passed in his emergeuice into civilised life " (p. 7). The rest of the volume may be briefly described as a luminous expansion of this broad principle, enriched by many valuable details, especially in the Welsh field. In the Irish a little weakness is here and there betrayed, as, for instance, in the omission of all reference to Phoenician contacts and influences, of which there can be no reasonable doubt. In this connection it may be pointed out that no allusion is made by any of the writers to the late James Bonwick's Irish Druids and Old Irish Religions which, if somewhat unieritical, embodies a vast array of data bearing on the early religious notions of the Celtic world. Here are copious references to the Phoenician phallic rites of pagan times, and to the Plhceniciaii god Baa], as in the salutation, Bal Dhia dhuit, "the God Baal be with you," which might still be heard on the banks of the Suir almost within the memory of man. Although Mr. Squire's fascinating little essay on British anld Irish mythologies does not profess to supplement Mr. Anwyl's volume, nevertheless it forms a necessary sequel to that work, and does largely increase our knowledge of the old Celtic deities, as may be at once gathered from the two chapters on the gods of the continental and insular Celts. That there should be some overlapping of both spheres was indeed inevitable, seeing how closely interwoven are the mythologies and religious systems of all cultured peoples. Perhaps the brightest feature of this volume is the lucid way in which the gifted writer shows how the dim old heathen legends do not die out, but rather receive a fresh lease of life, when they become transformed and glorified by the almost inspired touch of the early Christian myth-mongers. Thus the caiildron of heathen lore "has altered strangely little in passing down through the " centturies to become the Holy Grail which had been filled by Joseph of Arimathea 4" with Christ's blood . . . The savage cooking-pot, which would refuse to serve " a coward or perjurer with food, has beeni only refined, not altered, in becominig the [ 75 ]</page><page sequence="3">No. 47.1 MAN.

Like its pagan prototype, it cured wounids aind sickness, and no oine could grow " old while in its presence. Though, too, the place ini which it was kept is but vaguely pictured by Sir Thomas Malory [in the Morte D'Arthur], the thirteenth century Norman-French romance called the Seint Greal preserves all the charac- " teristics which most strike us in Taliesin's poem " (pp. 75, 76). But space forbids to pursue this attractive subject further. In the foreword to his Religion of Ancient Scandinavia, Mr. Craigie tells uis that his chief endeavour has been to extricate the strictly religious element from the voluminous mythologies in which it has been enveloped by the Icelandic skalds, who, themselves poets, and writing in advanced Christiain times, were naturally attractedt more to the poetic and legendary aspects of the subject than to the already half- forgotten pagan beliefs of their Norse forefathers. In this he has been fairly successful, and we have here almost for the first time a clear and consecutive account of the great gods, Thor and Odin, apart from their heroic and legendary associations; of the subordinate gods and goddesses; of their temples and images; and lastly a most informing chapter on " Ceremonies and Ministers of Religion." It is instructive to note that there was no distinct order of priesthood; the religious functions being superintended by persons who also enjoyed temporal authority. First came the king, " on whose attitude towards the gods and their worship the prosperity of " his people was believed largely to depend." In virtue of their twofold office these priestly chiefs were regarded as divine and called so (gobi from god, god) whence pre- sumably the theory of " the divine right of kings " so deeply ingrained in the Teutonic temperament. But the priestly office was also hereditary, and could be transferred fronm one chief to another, the position being thus strictly analogous to that of the kings of Hawaii and other parts of Polyiiesia, who were not only rulers and priests in their own person, but were also descended from a long line of deified ancestors for whom lengthy theogonies and genealogies were prepared and embodied in the local oceanic sagas. In Norseland, as in Polynesia, the divine and the human elements thus become inter- mingled. Sometimes the gods appear as men and the men as gods, while the theogonies are called genealogies, and often merge imperceptibly in the human genealogies as if the half-inspired singers, after deriving the deities from mortals, had redressed the balance by reversing the process. When we read of the exploits of the lesser deities, the vague entities hovering between heaven and earth, the oesir, the nornir (Fates), the valkyrjur (war-maidens), of Frey also and Njord and Baldr, and when we are told how Hrafnkel gives Frey joint possession with himself of all his worldly goods, we begin to wonder where the line is to be drawn between the human and the divine. Even after allowing for the full play of the anthropomorphic concept, we have still to ask, Are marny of these shadowy beings real gods, or demni-gods, or eponymous heroes, or only brave men deified perhaps like the war-god Ty, later supplanted by Odin ? And Odin himself, our Woden, as in W17ednesday, is in the same, category, at times aii all-powerful god, at times earth of the earth, endowed with intensely human attributes. Mr. Craigie makes several allusions to human sacrifices, as when the goddess, Thorgerd, is appeased by the sacrifice of King Hakon's son, and how as many as ninety- nine men are immolated at the great gathering held every nine years in Denmark. We know, of course, from Caesar how universal and how horrible were the holocausts in Celtic Gaul, and the question arises, Was the practice introduced by the proto-Aryans from the East, or borrowed by them from the Eurafrican aborigines ? Borrowings there possibly may have been, but they were not needed, since a careful consideration of all [ 76 ]</page><page sequence="4">1907.) MATN. [Nos. 47-48. the evidence shows clearly that the trail of blood must have followed the track of the invaders alolng all their routes to Northern, Central, and Southern Europe. Wherever deep rivers had to be crossed during the migrations there bridges had to be built, and as this was held to be an offence against the river god, atonement had to be made by the sacrifice of the aged, of anybody above the age of sixty. Hence in Latin sexagenarians were called senes depont(ani, explainied by Festus as those qui sexagenarii de ponte dejiciebantur. This toll was paid on the opening of the bridge, and repeated annually on the anniversary of the event, though in later times the so-called argei, straw effigies as priscorum viroruni simulacra, were substituted for the living offerings to the river-god. This custom, which could not have been borrowed from the Western peoples, prevailed everywhere amongst the Itali, the Slavs, and even the Germani, as shown by the Low German saying, Kruup unner, kruup urnner, de Welt is Di gram, "Creep under, " Creep under, grim to thee is the world." Thus is established the universality of human offerings amongst the proto-Aryans before they came in contact with the Neolithic populations of Central and Western Europe. A. H.
