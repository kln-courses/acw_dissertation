<plain_text><page sequence="1">Luxemburgensis The Emergence of a European Sovereignty The fact that a parallel can be drawn between the process of European integration and an emerging sovereignty illustrates the political nature of European integration. No matter what definitions of sovereignty are used - and we will come back to that - it is clear that the European Community has one fundamental characteristic: it is a framework within which an attempt is being made to translate into action, through an institutional process, a complex of economic, social, and human aspirations. If politics consist in making possible what is desirable, then the Community does indeed deal with politics. What is important is the degree of originality and auto- nomy in the community, rather than references to such notions as 'subject to international law* or 'political recognition'. Much has been written on the concept of sovereignty and on various aspects of its changing nature. One need not go as far as Politis i1 'Sovereignty has already been virtually abolished and if the word is still used in official and, to a lesser extent, scientific language, this is due to the failure to adapt visually, to the disappearance of a light which for long has burnt so brightly.' If it can be said that the notion of bon plaisir y applied by an extreme anthropomorphic transfer to a state, is disappearing in the western world, it remains none the less true that important traits of sovereignty continue to be ideas which must be reckoned with and they exist in fact, or in men's minds (which some- times comes to the same thing). Thus it can be said that the following characteristics of sovereignty remain (even in changing forms) : -on the internal plane, the organization must be statist; it must 1 Politis: JL¿ problème des limitations de souveraineté in Recueil de Coursy Vol. 6, 1925, pp. 5 ff. and p. io.</page><page sequence="2">8o LUXEMBURGENSIS comprise a complex of subjects and aspirations and a decision-making process which enables the basic aspirations to materialize, if need be even against minority positions. - on the external plane, the organization must be able to deploy itself. Although it is not indispensable that it should be recognized as a state, at least it should be accepted by other states outside as a reality and even perhaps as a partner in international affairs. The fact that a body such as the European Community can be subjected to internal influences and pressures (for example, by governments or by multinational corporations) or to external ones (the influence of other states through certain member-states) does not mean that the notion of sovereignty should be discounted. The same thing happens also within the nation-states, without their existence being called in question. It has never occurred to anyone to deny re- cognition to a state merely because it depends upon one or two basic materials which are in the hands of a foreign company or because its defence, let alone its foreign relations, are taken over by law or in fact by another state. With regard to the Community, on the other hand, certain limita- tions - although they may often be less clear - are put forward to cast doubt upon the existence of the genuine autonomy of the system. This is, on the whole, understandable in that the Community by reason of its constitution, its objectives, and its methods, does not directly dwell upon the issue of internal and external sovereignty. To the extent to which the Community's powers are limited, its methods gradual, founded on the articulation of relations between states, the terms of comparison cannot be those of the traditional concept of 'sovereignty'. Very often the first act of a country (for example, after secession) is to proclaim its internal and external sovereignty. In the Community's case, sovereignty is largely the outcome of the effective functioning of the system and of its achievements. After a brief look at the Community from the point of view of its constitution, we will see how it works, bearing in mind its specific characteristics. Finally we shall try to draw up a balance-sheet between the loss of sovereignty of the member-states and the gain of sovereignty within the Community. THE CONSTITUTIONAL NATURE OF THE COMMUNITY Political scientists have rightly placed at the heart of the problem the question as to whether the Community is irreversible. Article 240 of</page><page sequence="3">THE EMERGENCE OF A EUROPEAN SOVEREIGNTY 8 1 the EEC states that the treaty has been concluded sine die . The treaty can only be modified by common consent and only after the institu- tion itself (the Council) has decided. The problem of the Common Market's irreversibility is usually seen in the light of a possible disintegration of the whole. Its history has not confirmed these gloomy predictions. To be sure, in the picture which is often drawn of sovereignty with regard to the Com- munity, the notion of the whole complex is seen as a peculiar characteristic. From this, it follows that some unrealized ambitions, abandoned initiatives or postponements are seen, in varying degrees, as denials of the irreversible nature of the Community. But the failures and delays, no matter how bitter they may have been, have not been regarded by the Community as hindrances to the process of integration, but rather as encouragements to follow up integration by different methods. Should crises or tensions arise around existing Community policies, and should the Community be driven in on itself and fail to take the matter up again in the form of fresh actions and perspectives, then a decisive blow against its irreversibility would have been struck. Most observers agree that the Community is irreversible, by reason of the links and networks which have been established. Some dis- agree. It is doubtful, therefore, if any useful purpose can be served by prolonging the discussion on this point, since in any case the argument will only cease when all the clashes and postponements within the Community have disappeared, or when - an unlikely event - it has achieved the status of a state seated by right in the General Assembly of the United Nations. It must be remembered, too, that in many states tensions between opposing groups and rival regions are played out against the back- cloth of a possible break up of the whole. In a world in which argu- ments of this kind become more and more bitter, who would want to deprive himself for ever of this supreme weapon of dissuasion and who, for that matter, could guarantee that such a thing would never happen ? The treaties have a constitutional aspect in that they express political aims and envisage a dialectic of powers by which their policy is put into practice. The Community is the legal person on the internal and external plane (Article 210). The laws of the Community are im- posed directly (or indirectly) upon the member-states and private parties. These constitutional characteristics are undeniable, but they tend to be disputed in terms of sovereignty, when it comes to putting</page><page sequence="4">82 LUXEMBURGENSIS them into practice. The legal order peculiar to the Community has been validated by the courts of justice, especially the court of the European Community. The Community has been granted sectors of activity in which it alone can act. This implies the withdrawal of the member-states from a number of external capacities (common policy in trade; agreements of association; negotiations on definite internal policies). It is for the Community, too, to pronounce on certain taxes, on agreements between enterprises, on the tariffs in support of enterprises, etc. In so far as common policies are defined, the Community becomes re- sponsible for implementing them and disposes of the power to modify them. Vast sectors of human activity have thus gradually come within the competence of the Community. Side by side with these areas of exclusive responsibility, there are a growing number of areas of joint responsibilities, shared between the Community and the member-states. This is particularly noticeable in the realm of regional, social, and industrial policy. The evolutionary character of the Community's responsibilities is confirmed by the facts and noted in the treaties. The Community has gradually extended its horizons, using at first more cautious methods and ending up, in some cases, with decision-making procedures in the fullest sense of the term. The treaty provides for this in Article 235, which gives the institutions the necessary powers to implement the policies which derive from its objects. Social legislation and environ- mental matters are examples of this. Of course, the limitation of sovereignty acquiesced in by the mem- ber-states, especially in international agreements, does not imply that the new entity itself has acquired its own powers. For example, the member-states may agree not to empty waste matter into the sea. The body dealing with this may even have the power to lay down rules concerning what waste can be emptied into the sea. The member- states may therefore have ceded to such organizations a large portion of their authority in specific matters. But this agreed loss of sover- eignty does not lead to the emergence of a new sovereignty. The powers given to the organs of Eurocontrol are wide, but we cannot speak here of a new sovereignty. For the notion of sovereignty to be taken into account the authority must cover a large part of human activity. It is the extent of this field of action which enables links and arbitrations between different interests to operate. Without a minimal sense of the common good and of a common allegiance no autonomous action is conceivable. If sovereignty is</page><page sequence="5">THE EMERGENCE OF A EUROPEAN SOVEREIGNTY 83 abandoned and powers allocated elsewhere for technical reasons, a new sovereignty does not necessarily emerge. But if the reaction to events leads to a common action and thus those whose task it is to defend the common good can play their part, then autonomy and sovereignty begin to emerge. Redistribution , in different forms, which is the expression of the solidarity of the members, is a basic characteristic of sovereignty conceived in this sense. Lastly, the behaviour of the actors must be conditioned by the needs of the whole rather than by the different points of departure of those who take a purely national point of view. In so far as the actors are under pressure from public opinion and in so far as public opinion can be informed and influenced by the body whose task it is to promote the Community - in this case, the Commission - a popular current is introduced into the process - in contrast to diplomatic attitudes. This is a necessary condition of an emerging sovereignty which cannot ignore the pressure of the man in the street. The pressure of public opinion therefore weighs heavily upon the Commission and the Council. Side by side with trends of opinion (rare) in support of a national position, transnational cur- rents in support of various solutions appear. To be sure, public pressure finds its most 'sovereign' expression in a parliament elected directly by universal suffrage (something which the Community possesses only in principle). Popular pressure in the Community (one of the characteristics of internal sovereignty) is sufficiently pronounced for it to be possible to speak of the beginning of sovereignty; indeed it can make itself felt more powerfully than in many countries whose 'sovereignty' is beyond dispute. It can, therefore, be said that the system itself contains the seeds of autonomy and sovereignty. But does not the way in which this power emerges cast doubt upon its autonomy? THE EVOLUTION OF SOVEREIGNTY The most debatable point about the uniqueness of the Community is that it is based on the member-states and especially the national governments. This is true as far as the process of decision-making is concerned, but is realized to a great extent in the participation in the carrying out of decisions which have been taken. This point must therefore be examined more closely in the light of</page><page sequence="6">84 LUXEMBURGENSIS the whole context of the environment within which the Community operates. The fact is that the members of two of the three Institutions are appointed by the governments unanimously. Although there are no representatives of the member-states in the Commission and in the Court of Justice, yet the treaties provide that a minimum number of nationals from each country should be appointed to both these Institutions. The members of the Commission cannot be removed for the dura- tion of their mandate, unless by disciplinary action or by a vote of no confidence in the European Parliament. They neither ask for, nor re- ceive, any kind of directives and are supposed to act completely independently in the general interest of the Community. (The mem- bers of the European Parliament are made up of delegates chosen by the national parliaments from their own midst, although the govern- ments are not without influence on the method of selection.) It might be tempting to stress the conditions of appointment of the members of Institutions, called upon to represent the common interest rather than the way in which these members carry out their duties - a way which should be 'European'. Is it naive to speak of the genuine independence and authority shown by those who are in- vested with these offices ? This is neither the time nor the place to make a study of the behaviour of the members of the executive and the holders of judicial office. This author, speaking for himself, starts from the assumption that, beginning with a certain level of functions and a certain political or administrative level, men prefer to exercise fully the functions entrusted to them rather than to watch the erosion of the moral credit upon which their careers are based. There is nothing exceptional in the fact that the members of the executives and of the judiciary are appointed by the governments since in those states in which the members of the highest offices or of certain constitutional bodies are appointed by the governments, the method of appointment is rarely given as grounds for questioning the autonomy of those who are appointed, or, to go one step further, the autonomy of the system. Their nomination by the government is more than counter-balanced by the fact that they must work with the members of the Council and of the governments of all the member- states and that their success depends largely upon the support of the public which does not approve of partisan views. Is not the Commission, assuming that the members are inde- dependent, forced when making decisions to do what the member- states demand ? Does not the well-known realism of the Commission</page><page sequence="7">THE EMERGENCE OF A EUROPEAN SOVEREIGNTY 85 lie finally in proposing what is acceptable to the lowest common de- nominator or what can be achieved by using more or less instant coalitions between the most varied interests ? Can it not even be said that the close contacts made by the Commission in the drawing up of their proposals place these within the lines drawn by the experts of the different member-states ? Such a danger is undeniably virtually inherent in the system. The Commission, just as the government of a western-type industria- lized state, is confronted by an enormous number of problems which it must resolve by fitting its decisions into a unified complex of policies, without being itself able to take every decision. It follows that the Commission, if it wants to remain at the centre of things, must put forward proposals which can further integration, naturally, but which are also such as will be supported by the member-states. Inevitably therefore the experts of the member-states play a great part during the phase when the position of the Commission is being drawn up. Nevertheless, in many cases there is disagreement between the services and the appropriate cabinets of the Commission and the experts of the member-states (which are not involved at this stage) which the Commission must settle. What is more important is the realization that in those matters which involve the Community's future, the Commission alone is responsible. It is with regard to these proposals that the political nature is asserted of the Commission's right to initiate and it is also in regard to these proposals that the Commission is directly engaged with the Ministers in the Council, often without the shield of an intermediary body.2 The fact that the member-states are directly associated, through the procedure known as administrative committees, with current ad- ministration and implementation of the Council's rulings, is not in itself likely to restrict the largely autonomous way in which the Commission applies the community law. The Commission's position in these committees is very strong for constitutional, as well as for technical reasons (knowledge of files ; comradeship at work) so that the number of decisions arrived at which are contested by the mem- ber-states and have to be brought before the Council remain at about one in a thousand. The national governments naturally find their most open field of expression within the Council. Here again the question arises as to whether the Council can work as an autonomous body, rising above 2 In 1972 the Commission met with governmental and private experts during its sessions.</page><page sequence="8">86 LUXEMBURGENSIS the sum of the initial positions of the delegations of which it is com- posed. On the negative side, it cannot be said that the beginning of a new sovereignty can be seen in the Community. On the affirmative side, it can be said that the tensions within it are the natural expression of a federal or a pre-federal system which is constitutionally charac- terized by the struggle between the federation, eager to increase its powers, and the states which form it which are anxious to retain as much as possible of their autonomy. The very fact that the member-states are in different degrees eager to maintain their prerogatives is not an argument against the genuine- ness of the system. However, if this eagerness were to lead to the blocking of decisions or their deflection in the direction of negotia- tions of the classical kind, it would not be possible to speak of an emerging sovereignty. The Communitarian process has been examined in an impressive number of studies and the course taken by some proposals has been the object of almost clinical analyses. Attempts at quantification and qualification of the whole are, on the other hand, rarer. This is because the minutes of the Council, like those of the Commission, are not published and such a study can only be carried out on the basis of a complete documentation, extending over a fairly long period of time. This being said, the first criterion of the characteristic autonomy of the system is that of its effectiveness. From the quantitative point of view, the reserve of decisions not accepted by the Council corresponds by and large to the sum of pro- posals submitted in one year. If one cannot therefore speak of the in- effectiveness of the proposals in quantitative terms, neither can one question the efficacy of the proposals in terms of the results actually obtained in the Council. The Commission's right to amend its pro- posal and the Council's right to amend the Commission's proposal are fundamental to the system. Both the Council and the Commission use this right freely. But this being said, there are very few instances of the Council simply rejecting one of the Commission's proposals. Thus, one can count on one's fingers the proposals which the Council has modified to such an extent that they have differed substantially from the one put forward by the Commission. Normally, the Com- mission adapts its proposal to make it acceptable to the Council, without going so far as to abandon any of the principles upon which it is based. While preferring to leave to others the task of making quantitative</page><page sequence="9">THE EMERGENCE OF A EUROPEAN SOVEREIGNTY 87 and qualitative analyses of the function of the proposal, it can safely be said that every initiative in the Community has been taken in the Commission and that every proposal has borne the profound im- print of its action. Some proposals have been accepted as they stood, others have been modified over the years, under different initiatives. The Commission exerts its influence through media suitable for political action (contacts with professionals, seminars, conferences, and press communiques; interventions in the European Parliament and in the Economic and Social Committee, 'green papers'), the whole operation being designed to detect popular aspirations and to assure popular support for its policies. The margin of support which the Commission enjoys is proportional to the degree of popular allegiance in Europe to the Community and to the spirit of solidarity the people are ready to show. Innumerable public opinion polls in Europe indicate that there is basic support for the process of inte- gration upon which the Commission can count. Of course, it is not to be expected that public opinion will mobilize itself in favour of Europe, beyond the point at which it is engaged nationally. Yet it is always on the issues which reveal the fragility of the Community that public opinion reacts most strongly - for the Community is never immune from challenge or crisis (unlike most countries which will remain whatever happens). This, then, is the political role of proposals by the Commission, which can help to crystallize positions and produce the 'drama'. Hence arise too the attempts to restrict the right to propose. It is be- cause the right of proposal can have such an influence on the formu- lation of the decision that it is only fully recognized to the Commis- sion in questions which are the object of a fundamental consensus - be it matters which are formally written into the treaty or matters which it has been agreed to incorporate gradually within this frame- work. These elements, though important, render less acute the problem of the majority vote in the Council, although this remains one of the touch-stones of the system. Indeed, the opportunities for action in the Communitarian system, and the rules of the game, are funda- nentally different according to whether the debate takes place in terms of a majority vote or in terms of the maintenance of the rule of unanimity. It must be noted in this respect that the Community is a body in which the vote is very frequently used. This is true of the Commission itself and of the many committees which surround it for the implementation of the Council's regulations. Even though the</page><page sequence="10">88 LUXEMBURGENSIS Council has appeared somewhat grudging in allocating competence for the making of secondary community law, it must nevertheless be recognized that, on the whole, the Commission has been given executive powers which are largely comparable to those which a national government receives from its parliament. If we add to these current questions those on which there is a regular vote in the Council (questions of procedure and finance; staff and statutory affairs) and taking into consideration decisions for which unanimity is legally necessary (see Article 100 and Article 235/ EEC) it can be seen that the limit within which an effective vote can be cast is relatively narrow (by restricting 'vital' matttes, i.e. subjects upon which neither the Commission nor the member-states would ever dream of being outvoted for the sake of it). The fact is that for these intermediate questions, the Council has resorted more fre- quently to the vote. Moreover, now that it has been enlarged to nine, it seems to be showing a sort of defensive reflex, and accepts the re- course to the vote more readily and especially resorts to a show of hands, from which the partners may draw their own conclusions. The problem then of the qualified majority cannot be given a de- finite answer in one sense or the other. Can the member-states themselves decide whether a problem is a Community matter or remains within the jurisdiction of the member- states ? The Community has not been spared conflicts over authority as between states and 'federation'. It must be admitted that every time there has been opposition of a political and theoretical kind be- tween the Commission, on the one hand, and one or more member- states on the other over these matters, it has been more often than not the governmental rather than the federal authority which has dominated. The concern of the member-states, shared more or less tacitly by the Commission, has always been not to endanger possible practical progress for the sake of maintaining institutional positions leading to inflexibility. This attitude has been facilitated by the Com- mission's profound conviction that the pressure of events will, in the end, change the outlook of recalcitrant states, and that in such matters it is better to govern with events than against them. The Community's evolution has done nothing to prove the Commission mistaken about this. In conclusion, the participation of the member-states in the deci- sion-making, as well as the conflicts over authority, are quite simply inherent in any federal-type system. The genuine and 'sovereign' character of the Community does not spring from the system so</page><page sequence="11">THE EMERGENCE OF A EUROPEAN SOVEREIGNTY 89 much as from the way it has been applied. In this respect, it is diffi- cult to deny the emergence of a sovereignty, though one cannot assert that the Communitarian system works with all the complete- ness which characterizes a strong government. One cannot help being struck by the fact that appreciation of the unique character of the Community varies according to whether it is seen from the angle of member-states, of states outside the Com- munity or of the industrial enterprises. While the governments and administrations of the member-states have very precise views on the powers delegated to the Commission, they remain firmly convinced that, on the whole, they themselves hold the reins of the system sub- ject to a continuous battle in defence of their own interests and pre- rogatives. This attitude is based very largely upon the conviction that what the Commission proposes - and which has a fair chance of success - falls within the range of what is tolerable. Although the dialectical tensions thus set up, are not of a revolu- tionary nature, nevertheless they show that the system has reached a definite degree of maturity. They convince the member-states that they are participating fully in the game and are 'at home' in the Com- munity. Those who see the system from further away, for example business circles and nations outside it, tend to discern more easily its uniqueness and character. On the plane of economic reactions, many sectors have out- stripped the institutional aspect of the EEC. There have been many instances of multinational companies, especially those whose de- cision-making centres are outside the Community, anticipating what the Community was to become and orientating their policy in terms of this new factor. On the more formal plane of recognition, the non-member states have, from the first, sent diplomatic missions to the High Authority. For the countries of the West, the conclusion of agreements with the Community has been regarded as a natural outcome of 'recognition', regardless of any positive support which any of them may have in- tended to give to the Community, as a partner in international affairs. Thus with reference to non-member states, the 'reality' of the Community no longer seems to be in doubt. There remains among some of them, however, the problem of accepting the Community as a partner in international affairs. But the absence of recognition and the refusal to consider the Community as a partner is more and more seldom put forward as an argument for the lack of reality and of uniqueness in the Community.</page><page sequence="12">90 LUXEMBURGENSIS Thus, when 'recognition' is refused systematically and for political reasons the refusal in itself serves to give more prominence to the whole problem; in the long run the refusal to make political realities coincide with political recognition leads to frustrated, and even schizophrenic attitudes. It can even be said that the member-states are more reluctant to give up 'sovereignty' in external matters than in internal matters. The history of relations between the Commission, the Council and the member-states which led to the decision of the Court of Justice on the ERTA,3 as well as the events which followed illustrate this point. Undeniably, the processes of integration which, in themselves tend to reduce the importance of the diplomatic function in the classic sense in relations between the member-states have given rise to a new way of co-ordinating the positions of the member-states which is conducted, in general, by those who have been in charge of classic diplomatic relations. It would be unrealistic to expect of them a spontaneous adherence to full recognition of the Community with all the consequences which this would entail for the role of the Com- mission. Thus the gradual filling in of the external contours of the Community has followed the laws of functional development, and internal resistance against external pressures has possibly been stronger than in many other fields. The Commission has taken this into account, by devising a whole panoply of procedures running from the exclusive representation of the Community by itself alone (for example, the final phase of the Geneva negotiations) to the pro- posal for mixed delegations, let alone negotiations conducted in the name of the member-states in a co-ordinated form. The member- states often hesitate to take the final step - this is especially true in new fields such as financial relations - and confer the role of spokes- man on the then President of the Council, rather than on the Com- mission as the constituted negotiator, which would be equivalent to recognition of a handing over of authority. The Commission has put no obstacle in the way of these formulae, realizing that they they are transitory and that in time the need for external coherence will end by imposing a single negotiator. The recognition of the existence of the Community in all its in- ternal and external implications also implies a choice in favour of the federal power with which a body such as the Community is obliged to live, but which cannot come about suddenly through a political 3 European Road Transport Agreement.</page><page sequence="13">THE EMERGENCE OF A EUROPEAN SOVEREIGNTY 9 1 decision. On the other hand, the Community's attributions are a function of what its partners are willing to confer on it, and thus they appear in the eyes of the latter as delegated tasks rather than as tasks originating in the Community. It must be added that in a pre-federal system which is taking shape, change cannot take place without some prerogatives and privileges which have hitherto been firmly held, passing into other hands; moreover, these transfers must take place in a Western-type society in which the maintenance of acquired rights is erected into a dogma. It follows that such transfers can be spread over a generation of officials, and indeed may only take place after the departure of an official who was too attached to his own fief. The tendencies towards resistance are compensated for by the fact that the non-member states have an even stronger tendency to see the Community as an entity and to endow it with responsibilities which in turn leads it to behave as an entity. We come now to the question whether it is possible to draw a parallel between the notion of government in a national setting and in the setting of the Community. The nature of the 'decision' which the Community can make in comparison to that of a government does not appear at first sight to be a fundamental distinction. In Western-type democracies, the governments' room for manoeuvre is in fact very restricted and the results which they reach depend to a great extent on choices of the moment, on the political regrouping of interests, on the account taken of public opinion and of the in- fluences upon it, on the support of organized interests, etc. If it is true that because of the objections of a member-state, some actions have not been undertaken at Community level, it is also true that others could not have been undertaken except through the Community. Similarly, one cannot really state a priori that the quality of decisions in the Commission is superior or inferior to what takes place within the member-states; in fact, many things cannot be solved within the national framework so the question is super- fluous. The Communitarian system has granted the Commission a greater power of innovation which is wider than that of the national govern- ments, bound by their daily activities and limited by public opinion. One can of course reproach the Community for passing its decisions in package-deals in which the most varied elements are mixed. At the same time, there is a tendency to lose sight of the fact that, within the national framework, decisions are also made in package deals, for</page><page sequence="14">9 2 LUXEMBURGENSIS instance in the governmental programmes which are negotiated at the beginning of each session. The difference between the Community and the national states in this respect may lie rather in the extent of the stratification of prob- lems linked to each other than in the nature of the Community. Moreover the need to consider public opinion is common to both systems. The proof of this is the part taken by the Community in the press and the crowd of journalists who besiege the Council when it meets. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE LOSS OF SOVE- REIGNTY OF THE MEMBER-STATES AND THE GAIN OF SOVEREIGNTY OF THE COMMUNITY If sovereignty was considered as a mass one could examine its dis- tribution between the member-states and the Community, and analyse the changes in this distribution taking place over time. A priori , one might be tempted to suggest that the traditional mani- festations of internal and external sovereignty (i.e. the possibility of taking judicial decisions which are directly applicable; the accredi- tation of ambassadors) are indivisible acts, which would mean that as the role of the Community increased that of the member-states would be reduced and vice versa . This is no doubt true from the point of view of the traditional manifestation of sovereignty, but far less so if the decision-making in the Community is taken into account as well as the fluctuating nature of the powers of the Community. The problem is seen in a quite different light when a different de- finition of sovereignty is taken as the starting-point: the capacity of a body to transform the aspirations of a whole entity into political actions which can lead to decisions. In such a case one might well speak of sovereignty at Community level (for example, to be the spokesman in negotiations with the United States on the organiza- tion of world trade; to settle the level at which enriched uranium should be stored for peaceful purposes) without such sovereignty being exercised at the level of the individual states. Inversely, the state regains a part of its national power by working from within the complex. Insofar as a state which can only act within the complex finds it closed to its aspirations, a kind of frustration sets in compar- able in nature to the reactions of individuals and collectivities faced with an impotent state. The problem of 'missed sovereignty' within the Community might thus be more real than that of sovereignties</page><page sequence="15">THE EMERGENCE OF A EUROPEAN SOVEREIGNTY 93 'dominated' by the grip of the Community system (for instance by the recourse to the vote by a qualified majority). One may speak of 'lost sovereignty' when the degree of integra- tion achieved makes it impossible for the member-states to settle some problems among themselves which they were free to settle formerly and when the Community itself takes no action to settle them. This situation can arise when international competition pre- vents one state from taking alone the internal measures which seem desirable to it, but it can also arise when the decisions which have already been taken by the Community are not flexible enough to take account of the changing factors. Again, it is because operational 'sovereignty' can also only work through the whole entity that a state may be tempted to deflect from within the behaviour of the entity in order to make it serve special interests, for instance, particular engagements which it may have taken with regard to nations outside. The scene is further complicated by the collision between motiva- tions founded on the need to respect the external manifestations of sovereignty and the necessities springing from the need for action. In such a case a member-state can block every proposal for action by the whole entity on the grounds that it would lose its sovereign attributions (in the traditional but not effective sense). The intensity with which 'missed sovereignty' is felt by the other partners depends not only on the extent of the missed opportunities but is proportional to the degree of arbitrariness inherent in an attachment to external values which are no longer based upon reality. Thus the Community has speeded up the need to exercise sove- reignty in action on the level of the entity as a whole, but at the same time the starting points - often inspired by the anxiety to preserve external signs of past positions - have introduced brakes into the system. The refusal to make the external manifestations of sovereignty co- incide with the demands of functional sovereignty creates a field of tensions into which the Commission can insert itself in order to bend the member-states towards making a more supple mechanism of de- cision, and towards institutional progress. It is difficult to deny that the way in which functional sovereignty works and expresses itself depends largely on the type of social organization to which it is applied and on the procedures according to which the body draws up its decisions. It is therefore premature to attempt to answer the question as to</page><page sequence="16">94 LUXEMBURGENSIS what will be the external manifestations of the sovereignty of a Com- munity which is gradually coming to exercise the functions expected of it. The institutional form devised for the whole complex will de- pend on the type of society towards which we are travelling. The real question is thus whether the Communitarian system will speed up this evolution and whether it follows a creative line. Decision- making by 'concertation' which is characteristic of our society, as opposed to the notion of 'command' naturally attached to the notion of a leader, offers to the Community the opportunities for action and innovation which can be, in many cases, more genuine than those of which national leaders can make use, who are naturally inclined to solve first the immediate problems facing their electorates. From the point of view of the questions discussed here, the im- portant thing is that the peoples and the political leaders should be convinced that the problem is looked at and can be solved in a 'European' way. The delays and failures registered so far have most often been caused by the resistance of those elements which hold the technical levers in the member-states and in industry, and which have resisted any change which might jeopardize their own positions. In one way or another, these refusals are the expression of attachment to the manifestations of past sovereignty. Without minimizing the effect of these brakes, it must be recognized however that they can- not in the long run stand up against public pressure and the political will of the leaders, upon both of which the Commission and the Parliament have considerable influence. The Community's history is studded with fallen taboos. In the Community, crises have become a kind of natural pulsation. Whenever the need to act has been resisted there is a crisis, giving the Commission an opening for action. At the risk of pushing the paradox a little too far, one can say that the re- luctance of the Community to invest itself with a form of classical sovereignty gives rise to its new process of sovereignty. In many respects, the process of overgenerating can be applied to the technique of integration. The vicissitudes of the Western currency during the last few years are a good example of the burgeoning sovereignty in the Community. What had heretofore been a matter practically excluded from the Community on the grounds of sove- reignty has gradually become a policy disciplined in common, al- though that common discipline may have zig-zagged and changed course. The need to domesticate together currency on the one hand, and the resistance, global and political to monetary integration on the other, give to the Commission room to manoeuvre towards a</page><page sequence="17">THE EMERGENCE OF A EUROPEAN SOVEREIGNTY 95 closer union of the whole. The very fact that the possibility of creat- ing monetary parity unilaterally within the Community is being dis- cussed, in itself illustrates the change of mind which has come about. The most hopeful sign of an emerging sovereignty can be found in the popular reactions to governments whose policies could lead to a sort of self-excommunication. The demonstration of sovereignty made by a member-state, if it ultimately fails because it cannot resist the rationale of the common action, proves the strength of the momentum of the common action. The history of the Community underlines that it has hardly been able - for reasons inherent in every federal system - to manifest 'sovereignty' with the sole aim of obtaining its recognition. The manifestations of internal and external sovereignty have been ex- pressed only much later on the formal plane, the character of emer- gent sovereignty residing very much more in the feeling of allegiance to a policy carried out in common, a feeling which triumphed over the manifold trials of strength with which it was confronted. The capacity to act, which appears in the long run to be the only valid criterion of sovereignty is won in this way every day. From this point of view the Community would seem to have brought to its members a net gain of sovereignty. Translated from French</page></plain_text>
