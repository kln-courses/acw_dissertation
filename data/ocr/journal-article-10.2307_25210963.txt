The kindest verdict on this book can only be "not proven", for the evidence really will not support the construction placed upon it. Das Gupta starts with the representation of the vajra in Tibetan and other Buddhist art and proceeds via the Gandharan representations (with a sideways look at Zeus' thunderbolt) to an analysis of Vedic references, before briefly looking at the "anthropomorphic figures" of the Gangetic Copper Hoards, which it is his contention are the remains of actual vajra weapons. The author struggles valiantly to make the Vedic descriptions fit his identification but has to resort to undue forcing of the evidence. Thus, one citation of the vajra as possibly narya and one as manusa (in contrast to its amanusa victim) are enough to establish its anthropomorphism (pp. 39-40). The sphya is interpreted as "shoulder" (pp. 42-3) rather than the "shaft" or "pole" which is compatible with later developments of meaning. On pp. 49-50 the obvious parallelism in the listing of the parts of the vajra in one text and of an arrow in others quoted is disrupted by his interpretation. On p 58 three passages are adduced in support of a "boomerang effect" but on the next page as many allusions to the vajra burning are dismissed as metaphorical. When he cites on p. 76 another researcher's using a model "anthropomorphic figure" to test this effect, he omits to point out that this was with out the shaft which is vital to his attempts to integrate the textual and artistic evidence with the actual shape of these objects. One could go on, but most decisive is simply the fact that he quotes on pp. 72-3 a dating by thermoluminescence of the occasionally associated Ochre Coloured Ware which rules out linking these "anthropomorphic figures" with the Vedic Aryans, but does not attempt to counter this. Beside such points the way that the book is produced from typescript, with far too many mis-spellings, wrong divisions of words between lines, and other disfigurements, is of small account. J. L.
