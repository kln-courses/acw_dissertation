<plain_text><page sequence="1">Kete, Kathleen. The Beast in the Boudoir: Petkeeping in Nineteenth Century Paris . Berkeley, University of California Press, 1994. Pp. x, 200. 9 black and white plates, bibliography, index. This is a slender, attractive, enjoyable and teasing volume. Its 135 pages of text are illuminated by many interesting de- tails on Parisian petkeeping and by a number of engaging illustrations. And they tease us with a tray of interpretive ideas on this particular petkeeping culture. The descriptive side of the book is the strongest, however, partly because it is the most straightforward, partly because it quotes liberally from contemporary ac- counts - especially those of press and memoir. It is here, for example, that we find some rich detail on the mid-century passion for the domestic aquarium, on the registered breeding of dogs and cats, and on the recommended training, nourishment and grooming of such ani- mals. More poignant and provocative is the recollection of the debate over sci- ence-inspired vivisection, in which abso- lutists on both sides fought tooth and nail over the meaning of the word "humanity". Here too we find the still familiar, anthro- pomorphic characterization of canine and feline - the former, protective, loyal, even self-sacrificing, the latter, wilful, ma- nipulative and self-serving. But problems arise along the front of ideas, essentially because the ideas - of which there are plenty - are not fully enough developed. Not in the chapters themselves, and not in the three page In- troduction or the two page Epilogue. To be sure, the central idea is clear enough, namely that petkeeping offers a window into the world of the French middle class. Having secured entry into this bourgeois 58 Urban History Review / Revue ƒèbistoire urbaine Vol XXIV, No. 2 (March, 1996 mars)</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews / Comptes rendus "interior", we discover items previously unseen from the street. The insistence on prettifying and perfuming domestic ani- mals reflected a desire to contain a bes- tial Nature, red in tooth and claw. The custom of "infantilizing" those same pets, dressing them up like dolls, spoke not only to an anthropomorphic urge, but also to one of feminizing them according to male expectations of female behavi- our. The bourgeois fear of rabies was even more suggestive. This disease was said to be spread either by the unkempt and infected dogs of the working class quarters, or induced spontaneously by an animal's sexual frustration. Thus it had connotations about class, and the primi- tive well-spring of sexual behaviour, as well as about a middle class horror of los- ing control - especially to a malady known to produce a gnashing of teeth and foaming at the mouth. That said, these ideas and arguments are more often affirmed than developed. Part of the problem lies in the use of lan- guage. While most of the descriptive text is perfectly straightforward, the same cannot be said of the sections ad- dressed to ideas and significance. Too often the latter turn opaque, clouded by such droplets as "dialectics at a stand- still", or "metaphoric space outside of conventional time", or "omnipresent ar- rangement of the imaginary in ordinary life." (p. 75) Part of it lies in the author's self-assigned brevity, a condition which makes it difficult for readers to connect fem- inist leadership against vivisection with the feminization of family pets, and these in turn with the growing popularity of cats - a species long associated with female sexu- ality-and the allegedly related transforma- tion of bourgeois culture at the turn of the twentieth century, (p. 135) Finally, part of the problem lies with the failure to situate these petkeeping bour- geois within the setting of their class cul- ture. The fact is that readers are ex- pected to deduce the degree to which Paris had been "embourgeois,e" by the mid-nineteenth century. But if we are to understand middle class concern about social order, scientific progress and the alienation of individuals in modern soci- ety, if we are to grasp their sense of what was crude and what refined, their appre- ciation of appropriate gender roles, we need to be told something directly - rather than inferentially - about the nature of that culture: their numbers, their sources and levels of affluence, their life- style, above all their values and the per- ceived differences between those values and those of other classes. In the ab- sence of such a class portrait, and with- out prior knowledge, readers may have some difficulty relating the rich and ex- plicit details of Parisian petkeeping to the sparse and implicit treatment of French middle class culture.
