<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Beginning of the Early Bronze Age in Southern Turkmenia on the Basis of Altyn-depe Materials by Ljubov B. Kirco In recent years problems having to do with the way in which the brilliant cultures of the Bronze Age, particularly the early urban civilization of Altyn-depe, were formed and established have engaged the central attention of a number of Soviet archaeologists studying the early agricultural remains of Central Asia (Kirco 1980, 1986; Masson 1981a: 10-29). With this aim the Karakum expedition of the Leningrad Division of the Institute of Archaeology of the USSR Academy of Sciences is carrying on special stratigraphic investigations into complexes of the Early Bronze Age and the Late Aeneolithic period at Altyn-depe and is deploying operations on a broad front in order to study the Middle and Late Aeneolithic at Ilgynly-depe in southern Turkmenia (Korobkova 1987: 126-27). At Altyn-depe in 1982-1985 the eighth and ninth building levels of excavation 5, which are dated from the end of the Late Aeneolithic period (Namazga III) to the beginning of the Early Bronze Age (Namazga IV); i.e. the end of the 4th millennium B.C. to the beginning of the 3rd millennium B.C., have been investigated over an area of about 600 sq.m. Extensive collections of massive materials and structural remains enable one, on the one hand, to outline a concretely historical picture of the way in which that portion of the settlement functioned, and, on the other hand, to define a whole series of features reflecting technical, technological, and cultural development, as well as particularly distinctive complexes. The portion of the settlement studied is located at the eastern edge of the 'hill with the wall' in the northeastern part of Altyn-depe. In the 9th structural level areas devoid of dwelling structures occupied a large part of the excavation (fig. 1). In the southwestern half of the excavation an extensive sector which had not been built up (courtyard A dimensions exceeding 20 x 12 m.) was studied. Judging by the nature of the strata ? delicate horizontal layers of clay mixed with organic detritus, ash, inclusions of lime, finely divided fragments of ceramic ware, and animal bones ? the northwestern part of courtyard A was an open square. In the northern corner of the courtyard the grave of an 11-year-old girl (*) was found between levels 9 and 8 (burial C1) Anthropological identifications of burials 836-845 were made by A.V. Gromov; the remainder were analysed by T.P. Kijatkina, Cand. Hist. Sc. [1] 33</page><page sequence="2">736) with a rich inventory: a bronze plaque and a rod; a silver double-spiral-headed pin; a marble vessel and lamp; a large chalcedony bead; a bone instrument for plaiting mats (?); and a terracotta top or 'head' (Kirco 1986: fig. 1). The burial apparently took place at the end of period 8. The southeastern part of courtyard A was intensively utilized for workshop purposes: the strata here are not homogeneous, and a number of refuse pits containing a large quantity of ash, organic remains, large ceramic sherds, and bones were investigated. The following graves were found lacking burial goods in the southern corner upon a floor of tamped clay: a boy of 7 (burial 839); a woman of 40 to 50 (burial 840); and a man of 45 to 50 (burial 841). It is possible that this was the remains of a burial chamber. Jn the eastern corner of courtyard A an individual grave, lacking inventory, of a woman of 35 was cleared out (burial 842). In the northern and northwestern parts of the excavation, dwelling complexes of the ninth building period were studied. Initially, a small northern house (about 20 sq.m.) of two rooms with carefully plastered walls and a floor of tamped clay (rooms 15 and 7a) had been built. The workshop annexes of this little house had apparently lain to the northwest (room 19). Part of the floor of room 15 had been destroyed by a sizable refuse-pit of period 8, filled with an enormous quantity of lumps of clay and pieces of clay objects, including also fragments of vessels that had not been fired. To the west of room 7 there was a second house (the northwestern one) with an area of about 45 sq.m., consisting of a vestibule (room 7/8), two dwelling rooms (9 and 6), and workshop cubicles (rooms 1 and 5). The walls of these rooms were not plastered; there were no hearths or tamped-clay floors. The entrance of the house was through the southeastern wall of room 8 and led in from the courtyard (rooms 2-4). Two structures positioned in the middle of courtyard 2-4 (about 10 x 8 m.) were studied. In the western corner a rounded burial chamber (room 3) about 2 m. in diameter which contained a family (?) grave, without inventory, of an adult man (burial 739), a woman of 30 to 40 (burial 738), and a boy of 5 (burial 795) was cleared out. A considerable area of the courtyard 2/4 was occupied by a considerable architectural structure (5.8 x 2.7 m.), that was partially broken into by a pit of the end of period 8, and consisted of a series of small parallel walls about 0.3 m. high. The space between the walls was set for one-third its length with bricks in such a way that long, narrow channels were formed (fig. 2). This type of installation is quite familiar at early agricultural sites in southern Turkmenistan and other areas; it constitutes the foundation of a substantial granary in which ventilation ducts beneath a wooden (?) flooring ensured circulation of air in order to keep the grain dry. To the east of courtyard 2/4 there lay an area which had not been built up, apparently extending to the edge of the settlement. In a late phase of period 9 (level 9a) a reconstruction and a rearrangement of workshops and dwelling complexes of the northern part of the excavation were carried out. Habitation rooms 6 and 9 were carefully re-plastered; tamped-clay floors of multiple layers were made within them. In room 6 about 30 stone tools were found, especially 34 [2]</page><page sequence="3">Fig. 1 - Plan of structures in excavation 5 at Altyn-depe: 1. - level 8; 2. - level 9a; 3. - level 9; 4. - level 10; 5. - burned clay. [3]</page><page sequence="4">Fig. 2 - Foundation of granary in courtyard 2/4 of level 9. pounders and hammers for working metal goods (2). The upper part of the wall in the southern corner of room 6 had been destroyed by a grave, without inventory, of an adolescent of 15 or 16 (burial 728). To the west of room 9, at the site of the northern house of level 9, four utility compartments (7, 8, 14 and 15) were built. The north? western wall of room 15 in level 9a and its western part were broken into by the pits of two individual graves of period 8. Burial 827 is that of an adult male accompanied by a ceramic bowl with simple ornament (fig. 15); burial 828 is that of an adult male (fig. 3) before whose face in a small plaited basket a stone lamp, a stone vessel with a cubical reservoir, and a stone drill or mace head all had been set, together with a bronze rod or staff; the forelegs of a ram had been placed near the arms of the skeleton (3). (2) Functional determination of stone and bone tools were made by G.F. Korobkova, doctor in historical sciences. (3) Paleozoological identifications were made by N.M. Ermolova, Cand. Biol. Sc. 36 [4]</page><page sequence="5">Fig. 3 - Plan of burial 828, inventory: 1, 2, 4 - stone; 3 - bronze.' In level 9a a second economic/household courtyard, 10/22, was also provided with a barrier on the side toward the edge of the settlement. In the southeast sizable workshop rooms ? 13/27, 23, and 25 ? also adjoin courtyards 2/4 and 10/22; these are built up against a sizable wall c. 0.6 m. thick that divided the block and that can be traced for more than 20 m. To the south of this wall an areaway between houses or a group of auxiliary rooms (30, 32-34) runs in a narrow strip, and beyond them the next southeastern dwelling and workshop complex commences (rooms 28, 29, 31), a great part of it extending beyond the limits of the excavation. Room 33 is disturbed by a family (?) grave of period 8: a male (?) 30-some years (burial 843), a boy c. 8 years old (burial 844), and a woman 55 to 60 (burial 843) were buried at the same time in a pit 1.15 x 1.05 m. (fig. 4). At the bottom of the pit remains of textiles were traced, and the persons buried had been covered over with a plaited mat. The man had hanging at his belt, apparently on a cord, a bronze and a bone seal-button; by the boy's head stood a small conical handmade vessel of coarse kitchenware paste. Marble objects, probably in a sack, were placed behind the shoulders of the woman; 37</page><page sequence="6">Fig. 4 - Plan of burials 843-45, inventory: 1 - ceramic; 2, 10, 11 - bronze; 3 - bone; 4-9 - stone. they consisted of two small vessels, two beads, a stone cap or head, and a lamp with cover; a bronze rod or staff (?) and a bronze plaque also were found. A similar collection of objects: an analogous stone lamp, a vessel decorated with horizontal cannelures (fig. 5), and a bronze rod ? was found 1.4 m. to the east of burials 843-845, apparently relating to a further grave located beyond the limits of the excavation. Analysis of the condition of the stone tools of level 9 shows that in a majority of the workshop complexes intensive work had been going on in the processing of stone and in the manufacture of stone tools. A particularly large number of such tools were in workshop rooms 13/27, 23, 25, in the south-western complex (rooms 28-34), and in the part of courtyard A which adjoined them. But in the northern complexes, particularly in rooms 6 and 9, there was a concentration of tools for breaking up ores and for making metal implements by hammering, and in the adjoining portions of courtyards 2/4 and A there were many tools for sharpening the blades of metal manufacturers. It is interesting that in all the complexes of level 9, except for courtyard 2/4, there were represented in small but statistically significant quantity (7-12%) 38 [6]</page><page sequence="7">Fig. 5 - Marble vessel of period 8. specialized tools for making ornaments of metal foil. Such ornaments, in particular round plaques, were found in burials of periods 7 and 8 that were studied in the strata of level 9 (burials 736 and 845). The shift from building level 9 to level 8 in excavation 5 at Altyn-depe is determined by a major change in architectural plan (fig. 6) and is associated first and foremost with the erection, upon the northeastern edge of the hill, of a fortification wall about 2 m. thick, which has been preserved to a height of more than 2.5 m. (fig. 7). The wall was built upon a specially prepared horizontal floor dressed with clay, and coated with bricks c. 46 to 50 x 20 cm. to 25 x 10 to 15 cm. Buttresses, with square cross-sections (0.7-0.8 x 0.7-0.8 m.) were constructed on the interior or settlement side at every 1.6 to 2.2 m. at the same time and bonded with the bricks of the wall. An analogous but smaller buttress (0.5 x 0.5 m.) was erected on the exterior, northern part of the wall, at 3.3 m. from the edge of the excavation. The fortification wall and the buttresses were carefully plastered. The sun-dried bricks for the construction were apparently made here on the spot, as is also suggested by the many lumps of raw clay, including ones with finger impressions, found in the fill of the complexes in the northeastern half of the excavation. Several hearths in the northern corners in the form of small fired pits, dug into the ruins of buildings of level 9, relate to the time when the wall was erected. Study of the brickwork and applied plasterings has shown that the wall was subjected to pronounced erosion, particularly at heights of 0.35 m. and of 0.6 m. above its foundation. In the first case, at the end of period 8 a second exterior buttressing (0.5 x 0.5 m.) was built, and the space between the buttresses was filled with massive raw clay blocks, so that [7] 39</page><page sequence="8">a single projection (0.5 x 2.1 m.) formed. But erosion of the wall continued, and as a result in period 7 a large section of the wall in its southern part collapsed, forming a projection that was initially taken to be the foundation of a tower. Apparently the wall was not later repaired because the washed-out ruins remained in place. In addition to the wash-outs and collapses, at least six large cracks, perhaps seismic in origin, occur within the thick section of the wall that has been examined. But these damages may also relate to a later period. The fortification wall, being the architecturally dominant feature of this part of the settlement, determined the direction of the axes for the planning of buildings of periods 8 and 7, and it apparently existed as late as period 6. It is only structures of level 5 that overlie its remains. In period 8, and also in the ninth building level, a great part of the southwestern half of the excavation was occupied by the extensive rectangular courtyard A (area more than 180 sq.m.) bounded on the northwest and northeast by the outside walls of the dwelling complexes (fig. 8). In the higher southeastern part of courtyard A the stratifications are of the nature of refuse. Here three substantial refuse pits were brought to light, (cutting through the strata of level 9 as well), and filled with water, organic remains, large animal bones, and fragments chiefly of household ceramic wares. In the northwestern part of the courtyard the character of the strata is somewhat different ? horizontal levels with delicate spots of ash, small bones of animals, and ceramic fragments, the result of the erosion of higher-positioned refuse pits of the southeastern part. The refuse strata in the northwestern part of courtyard A are covered over with materials from the crumbling of the adobe walls. In the northern corner a square (1.3 x 1.3 m.) burial chamber was found with the grave of three persons lacking burial goods ? a man 35 to 40 (burial 683), a woman 40 to 45 (burial 684), and a child 5-6 (burial 685). The northwestern complex of structures, which thrust only in part into the outline of the excavation, consisted of at least three rooms. Room 2 (more than 9 sq.m.) and room 3 (more than 11 sq.m.) were dwellings, as determined by the dimensions and the character of the fill. In room 3 a rectangular hearth of four bricks set on edge, lightly fired on the inward sides, was found upon the floor. The northeastern part of room 3 was heavily destroyed by refuse pits and burials of period 7. The major portion of the northeastern half of the excavation is occupied by a central complex drawn out in a line running northwest-to-southeast and consisting of a house of 80 sq.m. and of a small courtyard (room 6), having an area of more than 30 sq.m., which adjoins it and has a wall in common with it. The house of the central complex consisted of six rooms (nos. 5, 22, 24-26, and 311-33). Passages between rooms were not discovered, although the facing in all the rooms had survived up to 4-6 courses of brick; i.e., to a height of 0.6-0.8 m. The walls were not plastered, and for this reason it was possible to discern the bricklaying system and to take a large number of brick-dimension measurements. The main rooms are room 22 with an area of more than 20 sq.m. and room 5 about 17 sq.m. In the western corner of room 5 there was a small workshop cubicle (0.7 x 1.0 m.). The fill of rooms 5 and 22 consists 40 [8]</page><page sequence="9">Fig. 6 - Section of the Early Bronze period in excavation 5 at Altyn-depe. Fig. 7 - Fortification wall of period 8.

Utility rooms 24-26, 31-33 are small (2.5-5 sq.m.). In the southern part of room 25 a cubicle is closed off, and in the northern corner a hearth (0.5 x 0.8 m.) has been excavated. Numerous pieces of wood are found in the fill of rooms 22, 24, and 25: both withes of about 1 cm. diameter and staves of up to 3-5 cm. diameter. The brick fill is covered over in all the rooms with an ash layer 0.1 to 0.3 m. thick. The center of the fill and the floor of room 22 is broken through by a refuse pit (2.4 x 3.5 m.) of the end of period 8. Remains of two hearth-podiums of period 8 which were cleared out in the southern part of courtyard-room 6 are particularly interesting. Only the southern corner with a border at its edge and a little column at its angle has been preserved of the first [10]</page><page sequence="11">and earlier one. The earlier hearth was destroyed during the construction of the second two-chambered hearth measuring 1.4 x 1.5 m. This later hearth is made of unfired bricks set on edge; the bottom is lined with pebbles and small fragments of larger stones, including fragments of broken tools. An inner partition is also made of bricks set on edge; it divides the hearth into two unequal parts: eastern (internal dimensions 0.75 x 0.9 m.); and western (0.3 x 0.9 m.). The maximum preservation of the side walls and the partition is 0.3 m. The bottom of the western part of the hearth is deeper than that of the eastern part by 0.2 m. In all likelihood extremely hot fire was not used within the hearth; the firing of the flanking walls and the partition was fairly slight. Both firewood and dried cattle dung were used. Unfortunately, the second hearth was severely damaged through the construction in period 7 of a burial complex, and it was not possible to trace the remaining details of its construction. In the fill of the rooms of the central house and of the small adjoining courtyard, large quantities of ceramic materials ? both fired and unfired ? and stone tools ? chiefly smiths' tools ? were found. The nature of the central complex is less than completely clear, but the curious architectural appearance of the rooms ? without wall plasterings and floor coatings, hearths on unbaked clay foundations ? and the large quantities of smiths' tolls and instruments for breaking up ores allow one to suppose that we have here not simply a dwelling but rather a workshop complex, perhaps the residence and workshop of a smith. To the east of the central complex lies the northern complex, similar in plan but smaller, consisting of a house of more than 30 sq.m. and of a courtyard adjoining it to the northwest, (room 14, more than 25 sq.m. in area). Room 4 had an area c. 12 sq.m., and room 15 c. 8 sq.m. The nature of the fill and the architectural appearance of this house are analogous to those of the central house. Here, the walls are not plastered; the floor coating and the hearths are on unfired clay foundations. In the fill of the rooms there are considerable ash deposits, collapsed unfired and fired bricks, and large quantities of ceramics, stone tools, and objects of unfired clay. In the fill of room 4 the grave of a woman 40-50 years old (burial 741) without burial goods was discoverd. It had been dug down from a courtyard of level 7. Room 14 had the ash and refuse fill characteristic for a courtyard on the edge ot the settlement. Here, two pits with animal bones, ceramics, and organic remains were cleared out, and, at the transition between levels 8 and 9a, three individual graves were excavated, without inventories, from the end of period 8 ? a woman (?) 40-50 (burial 743), a man 20-25 (burial 744), and a child 4-5 (burial 745). The north-eastern walls of the northern complex and of the eastern complex lying a little farther south were built in places right up against the inward buttresses of the fortification walls. The eastern house is about 50 sq.m. in area and consisted of 4 rooms ? 23, 28-30 (respectively 11.5, 9, 5, and 6 sq.m.). In the western corner of room 23 a small hearth or pit was uncovered. Between rooms 28 and 29 a passageway 0.5 m. broad and without threshold was excavated; it was the sole passageway in the walls of structures of period 8. In room 28 at the level of the foundation of the wall a grave, without inventory, [11] 43</page><page sequence="12">of a child c. 7 yrs. old (burial 797) was excavated which was interred at the end of period 8. South of the central and eastern houses a number of rooms of dwelling-workshop complexes lying mainly outside the limits of the excavation (rooms 34-37) were partially exposed, as in level 9. In the angular space between the houses, room 35 was excavated which contained the inventory-less grave of an adult (burial 796) dug down from a courtyard of level 7. The majority of stone tools of level 8 are associated with ore processing and the shaping and sharpening of metal instruments and ornaments. In the northern complex a relatively great part (13-17%) of the tools are for breaking up ocher; perhaps work for decorating ceramic vessels was performed here. It was from courtyard 14 that a pit was dug downward, cutting through the strata of room 15 of level 9, containing production wasters for the processing of clay objects, including fragments of unfired vessels. The character of the structures and fills of level 8 is altogether different from that of the dwellings of other complexes of the Altyn-depe Early Bronze Age; perhaps this differences arises from the nature of the buildings in question: an area for production. Yet it is not out of the question that the structures of level 8, as with the northwestern house of level 9, are not buildings themselves, but something on the order of foundations for structures that were erected upon them. In any event, the planning of the structures of level 8, oriented toward the fortification wall, determined in very great measure the planning of the sector in periods 7 and 6 that has been studied. The strata of levels 8 and 9 in excavation 5 at Altyn-depe were most densely filled with an enormous quantity of fragmentary and almost complete artifacts: bones, clay vessels and objects made from terracotta, bone, bronze, and various sorts of stone. Unfortunately, there still remains much that is unidentified or functionally unclear, though even now one can judge the nature of the range of productive activities and arrive at a preliminary typological characterization of the cultural complex. Data regarding the main branches of production on the part of the people of Altyn-depe in the Early Bronze Age ? agriculture and stock-raising ? are scanty by virtue of the limited nature of the sources (stone working implements, structural and osteological remains). A single hoe has been found among the stone implements (fig. 12, 11), indirectly suggesting a dominance of metal (or wooden?) implements for tilling the soil. Judging by the ubiquitous discoveries of milling stones, grinders, pestles (fig. 10, 6; 12, 3) and mortars (fig. 10, 5), the grinding of grain took place in every house; yet the storehouses for grain supplies were held in common. The foundation of a granary, discovered in a courtyard of level 9, encompassing an area of 15 sq.m. with a presumed height of no less than 2 m. might have stored c. 30 tons of grains: i.e., (according to ancient Sumerian norms) a year's supply for 100 adult men and women (Masson 1976: 105). The centralized storage of produce is also suggested by the absence of large storage pits or structures with storage containers in the houses. Utility rooms 44 [12]</page><page sequence="13">in houses of the Early Bronze Age ordinarily have very insignificant floor plans and are more likely closets for keeping a small quantity of goods necessary for everyday use. Concerning the composition of livestock, the osteological data show a sharp predominance of smaller horned animals i.e., sheep and goats (more than 80% of all bones identified); large horned cattle (Bos) come to about 5%; and the bones of Sus are extremely rare. Wild game is represented in the main by the onager (kulan) (5-7%) and the gazelle [djeiran) (4-5%); the remaining animals ? the wild boar, the moufflon, the elk, and beasts of prey ? are only represented by single finds. Dog bones of various breeds and sizes have also been found. Also, depictions of dogs are most frequently encountered among the clay and terracotta animal figurines (fig. 18,2-4, 6,9); statuettes of rams are also widely represented (fig. 18, J&gt;, 7). Depictions of draft animals ? oxen and camels (fig. 18, 10) ? are fairly rare. Construction Techniques All buildings are made of standard rectangular unfired brick 8-12 x 19-22 x 39-46 cm. with dimension ratios 4:2:1. Study of laid brick has shown that the distortion of the dimensions of a brick is associated with its deformation under the pressure upon various sectors of the wall within the structure; when it was prepared the bricks were practically uniform. In removing the walls of levels 8 and 9 it was discovered that upon manufacture simple signs or symbols were applied to the broad sides of all bricks. More than ten such symbols were brought to light; they were applied with the fingers of the hand, and they consisted of one, two, or three transverse or diagonal stripes, two crossing stripes forming a sort of x, a single half-moon impression, one or two oval impressions, and one or two semicircular impressions with an indentation at one end composing an oval or subtriangular pattern (fig. 9). The walls of companion buildings in complexes were often built of bricks having the same markings. Thus in period 8 the walls of rooms 6 and 11/12 are laid in brick with a single-stripe marking, those of rooms 2 and 3 in brick with two stripes, of rooms 4 and 15 in brick with three stripes, of rooms 5, 22, and 24-26 in brick with two oval indentations, etc. This testifies to careful checking and apparently to planning of the quantity of brick necessary for specific needs. Clear-minded organization was also required for the preparation at a single time of the enormous mass of brick for the erection of the fortification wall. Horizontal building areas were specially prepared. If in altering the plan layout the walls of preceding periods were not used as foundations, the bases of walls belonging to a single complex are all on the same level, sometimes on a special spreading of ash. All the walls were correctly bonded (?), sometimes through the use of half-bricks. A distinctive foundation was laid beneath the floors: first the lower space was spread with a layer of ash containing lumps of raw clay; above this a layer of raw brick fragments or waste was spread and tamped down; and then tamped-clay floors up to 12-16 cm. thick were spread above this surface. The plastering of walls and the smoothing of [13] 45</page><page sequence="14">^^^^^^^^^^^B^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^B ^^^^^^^^ ^ ^^H^^^^H ^^^^^^^HHjfetf|^^^^^^^^^^^^B Fig. 9 - Markings on bricks from the walls 1^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ - structures 8. 46 [14]</page><page sequence="15">floors were carried out with stone or ceramic trowels (fig. 12, 13; 18, 17). Thus study of the remains of buildings reveals a high level of qualitative skills, the existence of a system of account and planning, and also the cooperation of a group of builders, (the erection of the fortification wall was obviously a community effort). Regarding metallurgy and metal-working, we are in a position to judge primarily on a basis of stone working tools and, to a much lesser extent, of a few metal objects. Ore processing was carried on at the settlement; large concretions were broken down with hammering implements or heavy mauls (fig. 11,4), and, with the aid of mortars and pestles on ore-grinding stone (fig. 11, 7, 20), ores were reduced to a powdery state. Thus far no slag or casting implements have been found; apparently these sorts of work, dangerous as to fire, were undertaken outside the settlement. There is no doubt that the majority of metal artifacts during the late Aeneolithic and the Early Bronze Age of Southern Turkmenia (Sajko &amp; Terehova 1981: 110, fig. 3) were cast. It is possible that complicated lost-wax casting was already known. Smithing work on semi? manufactures was done with small anvil-hammers, of various sizes, shapes, and weights for cold-hammering and hot-forging (fig. 10, 11; 11, 8; 12, 20); these were used both with and without handles. Especially interesting are instruments for making ornaments of sheet metal by cold-hammering and laminating: burnishers for pressing out metal foil (fig. 11, 3, 6) on special anvil-stands (fig. 10, 8; 12, 22) and miniature hammers for cold-hammering of decorative ornaments (fig. 12, 7) in a special matrix-form with a hemispherical working surface (fig. 10, 9, 13, l?, 16; 12, 2, 4, 6). In addition, there were found in almost every household activity-dwelling complex various sorts of abrasives and whetstones for sharpening and grinding metal implements (fig. 10, 14), including specialized examples: for knife and dagger blades (fig. 11, 2; 12, 13); for implements with transverse blades of a type of axe-adze and for sharpening needles and awls (fig. 11,5). Metal tools include: awls roughly square in section, double-edged or ending with a tang (fig. 13, 8-12) and pieces thereof; fragments of the blades of single-edged knives (fig. 13, 2, 2, 4); a single sharpened dagger or dart-head with a ricasso and a flat tang (fig. 13, 3); a broken piece of a file (fig. 13, 7); and a small adze (fig. 13, J&gt;). Metal ornaments and objects for show were mainly found in burials. These are rods or staffs (?) with one end thickened and the other end shovel-shaped or in the form of a stepped lozenge (fig. 13, 13-15); rounded and slightly dished plaques (fig. 4, 20) of sheet metal (4); and the oldest metallic rectangular seals in Central Asia of two types with cruciform ornament ? a button-seal (fig. 4, 2) and a stamp seal-like object with a lug handle (fig. 16, 4). A spiral-headed, shield-shaped, silver pin is an import from southwestern Turkmenia (Kirco 1986: 142, figs. 1, 2). Two other pins, with flat and mushroom-shaped heads, functioned possibly as awls (fig. 13, 16-17). Stone working was an important activity of the inhabitants of Altyn-depe at the (4) In the literature these ornaments are ordinarily interpreted as being round mirrors without handles. But a well-preserved plaque from burial 845 has a small hole for sewing it onto a garment.

[17] 49</page><page sequence="18">beginning of the 3rd millennium B.C.; stone tools and other artifacts are extremely diverse. The widely used stone tools and objects were made primarily from local varieties of stones present in the Kopet-Dagh; limestone, sandstone, diorite, granite and flint pebbles are characteristic for all phase of development of the culture of the ancient agriculturalists of southern Turkmenia. But in the complexes of levels 8 and particularly 9 a whole range of altogether specialized implements and rough-outs of stone tools is represented. For the shaping of stone objects practically all forms of manufacturing techniques were employed; at the same time, many flint pebbles were utilized in the labor process generally without treatment or with minimal adjustment. The detachment of flakes and blades from cores was done with the help of pressure tools. Splitting and shaping was done on special anvils with hammers and, mainly, cleavers of various weights and shapes (fig. 10, 4, 7, 10); and the finishing and polishing was done with various sorts of abrasives (fig. 10, 3), among which were some unique examples, such as, in particular, a heavily worn whetstone for sharpening axes (fig. 10, 12). Objects of soft varieties of stone were made by an abrasive technique on preliminary shaped and sawn semi-manufactures that had prepared forms (fig. 10, 1; 12, 8). Single-ended or double-ended drills were widely used; chocks and ends of such manufacturing have been discovered (fig. 14, 4). A series of objects were finished by polishing. An high, even artistic level of craftsmanship is particularly characteristic for objects made of marbles, jasper, and semi-precious stones that apparently, like metal artifacts, had a symbolic or prestige value. Such are the elegant translucent marble vessels with conical, cylindrical, spherical, or cubical containers and flattened, rounded, or everted rims. Their surfaces either have the glow of polished stone or are decorated by horizontal and vertical flutes or grooves (fig. 3, 2; 5; 14; 13, 15-19). Roughly cylindrical lamps which slightly narrow towards the base had a flattened round lid with an opening for the wick (fig. 4, 9). A unique lamp is one of dark-red jasper decorated with circular ornaments produced by drilling and encrusted with bits of turquoise (fig. 3, 3). A flat square seal-button with a drilled-out cross-shaped ornament is also made of the same jasper (fig. 14, 2). Small, schematic, seated anthropomorphic figurines are made of marble (fig. 14, 6-8), including apparently some that were quite realistically executed; a fragment of the face of such a figure has been found (fig. 14, 3). Alabaster and marble biconical beads (spindle-whorls?) (fig. 4, 4, 5; 14, 12) and circular flattened heads or tops (fig. 3, 4; 4, 6) are widely represented; such a head or top of polished stone (fig. 14, 12) was found that was made of the same stone as a spherical mace head, a fragment of which was discovered in level 9 (fig. 14, 11). Elongated beads lenticular in cross-section are made of chalcedony and agate (fig. 14, 2), and two flat trapezoidal beads from the grave of a child (burial 818) are of lapis lazuli (fig. 14, 10). The main source of data on the ceramic productivity of the beginning of the Early Bronze Age at Altyn-depe consists of an enormous mass of fragments of ceramic vessels and clay and terracotta objects. These require special processing and examination. 50 [18]</page><page sequence="19">Fig. 12 - Stone implements of level 9a. [19] 51</page><page sequence="20">Preliminarily, one may merely point out some features of the ceramic complex of periods 8 and 9. Table I Proportion of Wheel-Thrown and Hand-Made Vessels in Levels 8 and 9 of Excavation 5 at Altyn-depe (in %) Technique Wheel-thrown or finished on wheel Hand-made Hand-made: Geoksjur, Yalangac, Kara IA, and Namazga II types Decoration: Level 8 Level 9 yes 3 none 23 5 yes 51 63 none 16 25 yes 4 4 none 3 4 On the basis of counts of the aggregate collection of ceramic wares (more than 9000 rims of vessels were considered), table I shows the overall relationships of hand? made and wheel-thrown, painted and unpainted vessels in levels 8 and 9. Analysis of these rough but statistically sound ratios for all the defined workshop and dwelling complexes (variations in correspondence consisted of 1-2% in the assemblages of a single period) shows that wheel-thrown pottery actually appears in level 9 but only constitutes a stable group in the assemblages of period 8. Thus, the appearance of a primitive potter's wheel represents the most important development in the production of ceramics during this stage. A peculiar feature of ceramic production consists in the fact that this most important technical invention is still practically not evident in the forms and decorations of the vessels; i.e., in the most striking ceramic attributes. Differences between hand-made and wheel-thrown vessels are perceptible (and that only for a single category) in the nature of the past of which they are made. Ceramics of level 9 and 8 of excavation 5 are represented by fragments of utility, cooking, and table wares. Hand-made utility vessels are made of clay paste with an admixture of sand; the dimensions of the grain of the temper material are related to the size of the vessels. Wheel-made utility wares are made of paste without perceptible admixture and bear on their surfaces traces of rough workings with a knife. The main shapes of these vessels are jars with oval or compressed globular bodies narrowing at a low neck with an everted rim. Parts of the hand-made vessels are covered with a red slip and are painted with large geometric motifs: stepped crossed; lozenges; zigzags; half-crosses; divided by bands of red pigment (fig. 15). Cooking vessels are represented by hand-made jars with compressed globular bodies and rounded rims, made of clay paste with an admixture of grit and gravel, and by 52 [20]</page><page sequence="21">Fig. 13 - Bronze objects: 1, 2, 3, 10, 13, 17 - level 8; the remainder - level 9. [21] 53</page><page sequence="22">enormous (up to 0.6 m. diameter) thick-walled low cylindrical or cylindro-conical vessels with flattened rims made of clay paste with a large admixture of adobe and then slipped. It is our assumption that these 'tazi (heavy, friable, and awkward) stood in courtyards or rooms and served for the kneading of a paste (of flour, for the baking of bread? or of clay for pottery?). Fine ware is hand-made from a clay paste with a small admixture of sand and sometimes a very small vegetable temper. The main shapes of vessels are conical and hemispherical bowls (fig. 15), covered spherical-sectioned vessels, cylindro-conical basins (fig. 15), and jars with low necks (fig. 15). Although there is a comparatively small range of shapes, the vessels vary rather considerably within each shape both in proportions and in details. The vessels are carefully shaped, and many of them are covered with a reddish or light-brown slip; the surfaces are polished and are often brought to a shine with special bone (fig., 18, 14) and stone burnishers. Firing is not always even; the surfaces of vessels bear light and rose-colored spots, and the section of a sherd often shows a strip of poorly fired clay. Painted design varies through diverse combinations of a relatively small number of geometric stepped and linear motifs, and is analogous to the ornamentation of the Altyn 8-9 assemblages from excavation 1 at Altyn-depe. Among the mass of fragments of tableware vessels, there also occur a small number or early Namazga IV ceramics from sites of Namazga-depe type: light slipped vessels with an admixture of finely divided vegetable matter in the paste, painted with geometric and geometrically stylized zoomorphic designs continuing the Aeneolithic Kara-depe traditions. Ceramic wares of the Jalangac, Geoksjur, and Kara 1A Middle and Late Aeneolithic types are also constantly present in the assemblages. This last is apparently the result of ancient pits and disturbances, resulting in the mixing of strata; yet the increase in the quantity of this mixed ceramic ware in levels 8 and 9 to 7-8% indicates that these strata lie close to those of the fourth millennium B.C. In general, the multiplicity of variants in features of form and designs of ceramic vessels and the unstable consistency of the paste and firing testify that the preparation of ceramics was carried out within the precincts of the family and that ceramic production had not yet grown beyond the range of household crafts. Apparently other operations, too, were carried out by the resources of the individual family: the making of small clay objects; the processing of hides, skins, pigments, wood, bone, plaiting, and weaving. Enormous quantities of various domestic and cult objects, from the many spindle whorls, heads or tops, wheels for model carts (fig. 16, 33, 34), and 'stands' (5) to the zoomorphic and anthropomorpic figurines, seals, reliquaries, lamps, etc., which form, together with the ceramics, a characteristic cultural assemblage of the Early Bronze Age of southern Turkmenia, were made of clay, that ordinarily was subsequently fired. (3) 'Stands' \podstavki] is an arbitrary designation for large truncated-conical objects of c. 10-15 cm. in diameter and 8-12 cm. high, sometimes with a vertical aperture through the center. Possibly they are rough partially prepared objects for the production of vessels. 54 [22]</page><page sequence="23">Fig. 14 - Stone objects: 1, 2, 4, 11-19 - level 8; the remainder - level 9. [23] 55</page><page sequence="24">56 [24]</page><page sequence="25">Some of these objects were decorated with black, red, and yellowish pigments before firing, and sometimes after firing. The processing of pigments is demonstrated by stone implements for breaking up large pieces of ocher and by pigment grinding stones or mortars (fig. 12, 5), grinders, and pestles (fig. 11,9) for pulverizing them. Brushes were used to apply pigment to objects; a holder for such a pigment brush has been found (fig. 18, 15). The processing of hides and skins was carried out with stone scrapers and fleshers of stone or pottery sherds (fig. 18, 26), and stone burnishers were used to work pigments into leather (fig. 11, 2). Stone implements for processing wood are also represented by several finds ? chopping tools, adzes (fig. 10, 2; 12, 3), chisels, wedges, shaving knives, etc. Bone objects are few in number. They include: working tools: awls (fig. 16, 8; 18, 22, 13), needles for cloth (fig. 18, 22), the kocedyk ? an instrument for plaiting mats (Kirco 1986: fig. 1, 2), and the above-mentioned spatulas and burnishers for ceramics and the handle for a brush; or else carved seal-buttons (fig. 4, 3\ 16, 5), fragments of bone rods with a simple zigzag ornament. (Analogous rods in a tomb of the Middle Bronze Age at Altyn-depe formed part of a set for some sort of game or divination [Masson 1981: 64, pi. XIX, 2]). Stone cutting tools were used to apply designs on objects, and awls and needles were sharpened on special whetstones. Numerous stone and terracotta tops or heads that are found throughout the excavations attest to spinning and weaving. Their shapes and sizes are as varied as are those of ceramic vessels. Spindle-whorls and tops or heads are represented mainly by hollowed conical, biconical, and sphero-conical shapes. Many of the terracotta examples are decorated with pinchings or indentations of the edges (fig. 16, 13, 17, 22, 29), incisions (fig. 16, 14), or zigzags drawn upon the side surfaces (fig. 16, 29, 27); painting designs were encountered only twice (fig. 16, 25, 26). The distinctively cultural features of the assemblages at the beginning of the Early Bronze Age at Altyn-depe are in many respects defined by five categories of objects and one category of finds for which no production or domestic purpose has been assigned: seals and their impressions; anthropomorphic figurines; reliquaries; lamps; and rods or staffs. The seal-amulets are represented by two types: stamp seals with a lug on the back; and seal-buttons with holes for sewn attachment. These seals are square or round in shape and are made of copper (fig. 4, 2; 16, 4), stone (fig. 14, 2), bone (fig. 4, 3; 16, 5) and terracotta (fig. 16, 1-3). All seals have on their faces a cruciform design of varying degrees of complexity enclosing zigzags, stepped triangles, and solar symbols. The design is applied to stone seals by drilling, to metal ones by punching (?) and by casting. The fact that these are actually seals ? objects which frequently bore impressed signs ? is now proven beyond dispute by lumps of clay found in strata of levels 8 and 9 with impressions (fig. 16, 9-22, 22). The impressions are produced not on amorphous lumps of clay but on clay bullae in the form of a low cone with a flat base of 6-8 cm. In addition, one and the same seal is impressed upon the same bulla several [25] 57</page><page sequence="26">times (fig. 16, 20, 22). The character of the lines on the imprints shows that we are dealing with imprints of metal (fig. 16, 9, 22), stone (fig. 16, 22, 22) and terracotta (fig. 16, 20) seals. The conical bullae with impressions in their unprocessed state could be applied to any object with a flat surface; in all probability, they functioned to ward off danger or denoted ownership (by the community, the temple?). These finds have come down to us in damaged shape, and only a light firing in the layer of ash into which the fragments of the bullae had fallen has saved them from complete destruction. Anthropomorphic figurines and their fragments have been found in large quantity in levels 9 and 8 of excavation 5 at Altyn-depe, but all of them are damaged to one extent or another. The figurines are made of stone, clay, and terracotta. Seated female figurines of the first type ? massive ones, with rectangular shoulders and cut-off suggestions of hanging arms ? have modelled representations of breasts (fig. 19, 5). Fragments of massive thighs with straight legs divided by a stroke and with a flat base (fig. 19, 15, 17) perhaps pertain to the same type. Such figures have analogies at Kara-depe and Khapuz-depe (Masson &amp; Sarianidi 1973: pi. XXIV, 6). Also relating to the first type is a fragment of the torso of a female figure with an unique iconographic representation (fig. 19, 4). The goddess depicted had a coiffure in the form of braids of hair falling over the breasts to the waist; they were decorated with black pigment. Alternating diagonal red and black stripes and a representation of a triangle filled with two-sided, toothed black lines had been applied to the figurine's shoulders. The figurine itself had been painted yellow. All of the coloring had been applied after firing. The second type consists of elegant figures lacking arms or breasts, with legs flexed at the knees, the lower legs sometimes bent forward and representing the feet (fig. 19, 6, 7, 9, 10, 16). The pubic area is rendered with black pigment (fig. 19, 10) or by a triangle with pricked ornamentation (fig. 19, 20, 16). Such figurines in every way continue Late Neolithic traditions (Masson 1982: pi. V, type III, 2). Perhaps the elegant little head with a complicated coiffure of locks and a triangular crown (fig. 19, 2) falls to the same type. Figurines of the third type are small seated anthropomorphic figures with barely suggested faces and without sexual features ? in marble (fig. 14, 6, 7) or in terracotta (fig. 19, 2). Perhaps these figurines are variants of those of the second type. Beside the seated figures, standing figures of three types are represented in the assemblages. A fourth type consists of figurines on a cylindrical base with nearly square shoulders and lowered arms (fig. 19, 29, 27). To judge by the applied beard in twinned goatees these are images of males, finding direct analogies in the Kara-depe materials (Masson 1982: pi. V, type IV, 2; XXI, 16). Anthropomorphic figurines of the fifth type have a barely suggested projecting head, arms outstretched to the sides, and separated legs (fig. 19, 11-14, 20). To judge by analogous torsos from Namazga-depe and Altyn-depe (Masson &amp; Sarianidi 1973: pi. XIX, 4; XXVIII, 4), these are also male figures. A sixth type ? the most numerous anthropomorphic figurines ? are statuettes 58 [26]</page><page sequence="27">Fig. 16 - Terracotta objects; bronze (4), bone (5-8), and clay (34) objects: 1, 4, 13, 14, 17, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 27, 28, 29 - level 8; the remainder - level 9. [27]</page><page sequence="28">on conical or cylindrical bases, with arms outstretched or bent in various ways and with faintly suggested pinches of heads or without heads at all (fig. 19, 23-26). The figurines frequently have on their torsos pricked designs or incised symbols ? a cross on the base (fig. 19, 22) or a triangle on the neck (necklace?) (fig. 19, 2j&gt;). Such figurines, as well as the type five examples, are ordinarily interpreted as being figurines for cultic purposes (to be offered upon invocation of the deity). Thus, the three-dimensional anthropomorphic figurines at the beginning of the Early Bronze Age are represented by images of six types ? supposedly three female (seated) and three male (standing) ? with three types of details: 1) Figurines with all the main parts of the human body, the sexual features, and complicated modelled or painted details of coiffure (types 1 and 4); 2) More sketchy representations without thorough working of some parts (head, breasts, arms), and sometimes lacking sexual features (types 2 and 5); 3) Anthropo? morphic seated and standing images without sexual features and almost without working of individual parts of the body (types 3 and 6). This triple structure perhaps reflects a definite functional purpose of the figurines and the complex of ideas associated with them: the image of a divinity and his or her servants and worshippers (?). Incised terracotta box-reliquaries are widely represented in the complexes of the Early Bronze Age period. They appear first among Late Aeneolithic materials and continue all the way down to the Middle Bronze period. But in strata of period 8 in excavation 5 at Altyn-depe a new variant of these box-reliquaries is represented: one on small cubical feet, having on opposite sides not only excised decoration but also two pierced cut-outs: one in the upper part, broad and shallow, and the other narrower and deeper (fig. 17). The author considers that the reliquaries, these elaborately decorated containers, served as receptacles for valuable cult objects, in particular figurines of divinities, and that they were models of decorated dwellings. In that case the apertures mentioned above are representations of niches or windows and of an entrance or doorway. Such niches and doorways have been found in well preserved dwellings of Middle Bronze times at Altyn-depe. Cylindrical and more or less rectangular in section (fig. 2, 2) stone and terracotta lamps are an indispensable attribute of the burial inventory of rich female (?) graves of the Early Bronze period. Such lamps are not yet known for earlier periods. This is the only category of objects that does not have genetic predecessors in the late Aeneolithic materials of southern Turkmenia. They continue in use during the Middle Bronze period, but in much less quantity and only in its early phase. These lamps are plainly associated with the complex of ideas about the shadowy world beyond the grave and with a certain specific and rather quickly disappearing burial rite or with a social group that vanishes during the Middle Bronze period (?). Study of a massive complex of materials mentioned above from the beginning of the early Bronze period at Altyn-depe enables to refine in detail our ideas about concrete phenomena among the cultural assemblages and also allows one to show for the first time a definite genetic connection between all the components of the proto urban culture at Altyn-depe and the earlier agricultural sites of the late Aeneolithic 60 [28]</page><page sequence="29">Fig. 17 - Terracotta reliquary on feet, level 8.

In its general aspect hypothesis on genesis of the early proto-urban culture at Altyn-depe has been suggested on the basis of the late Aeneolithic assemblages according to the restricted data without detailed typological substantiation. Then both origin and development of methods and technological achievements of the Early Bronze period formed the economy of the civilization in the same manufactures: pottery, metal working processes, building have been roughly traced. Nowadays the preliminary typological data show that practically all substantial cultural components of the Early Bronze period assemblages-types of dwellings and burials, both in shape and in design of vessels, anthropomorphic figurines, metal and stone objects, terracotta wares seem to be strictly analogous to the late Chalcolithic assemblages of Geoksjur I and Kara I. All over the Early Bronze Age gradual transformations in assemblages were conditioned by the development of technical and technological processes and by the change of cultural patterns and stereotypes. Painted female figurines can be used as a clear example. The triangular signs incised on the figurines' shoulders are identical to one of the most widespread pottery motifs of Kara IA, but on the other hand they represent the immediate genetic predecessor of the signs incised on the shoulders of the figurines of the Middle Bronze, called triangles with resnicki (little eyelashes). Braids to the waist are also analogous to the figurines' coiffures of the Middle Bronze. Both our figurines and those of the Middle Bronze represent the same female deity but in an absolutely different way, conditioned by the complete change of cultural patterns and standards. Thus in the Early Bronze Age in Southern Turkmenia the development of the late Chalcolithic traditions went side by side with the generation of later cultural developments. REFERENCES Kirco, L.B.
