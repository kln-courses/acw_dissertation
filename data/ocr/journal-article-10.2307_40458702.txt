Buryat Shamanism in Relation to Other Shamanisms Introduction The Buryat shaman has a dual relation to the past of his society, par- ticular and general, in which the particular in turn is double: He bears a relation to his personal past, in which he is fostered as a shaman in his own descent line, and he has a general relation to the past as the bearer of those determinate traditions of Buryat society which are related to shamanism, which are thus particular to the shaman. On the other hand, he has an active relation to the Buryat present: he is socially recognized as such, and he is called forth as a shaman by his own social group; he can only function as a shaman if he is recognized as one in potentia by his contemporaries. His local group then undertakes to pay for his training and the ceremonials of becoming a shaman, costume (the hat, cloak, boots) and paraphernalia (the drum, staff, and whip), and the gifts of the nine peltries or idols (ongons) of his cult, on his behalf; and they see to the equipment of his tent in order that he may fulfill the social roles and functions that are required of him. He has moreover, a dual relation in his social personality. He is at once hated and needed, reflecting the ambivalent relation in society of the 'wild', 'bad' social type that is necessary for the orderly functioning of the traditional social group. He has a personal and general need of his social role as shaman, as the condition of his social existence, and his mental health, hence of the condition</page><page sequence="2">106 LawreînCE Krader Amhropos 70. 1975 of his biological existence, including its shamanist mental aspect and role, just as the society hates but needs him for the promulgation of its relations to its own past and to its natural surroundings, hence for the continuation of all that is characteristically Buryat in its constitution as a cultural group. The shaman has internalized the judgment that has been passed upon him by his people, which is to become a shaman, just as the society has internalized his shaman's role. And just as all Buryat shamans come to their calling unwil- lingly, the society comes unwillingly to the shaman. But whereas the shaman gives himself up entirely to his life as a shaman, during the portion of his life cycle in which he is a shaman, the Buryat society has certain reserves in regard to him. Elements of the Buryat tradition relate not at all to shamanism among the so-called shamanist Buryats, or are merely colored by shamanism ; finally, there is a tradition among the shamanist Buryats which relates not to the contemporary shamanism, but to shamanism in another form, in the distant past. The period of Buryat society and history that we are concerned with, which will be our ethnographic present, extends from the beginning of the seventeenth to the beginning of the twentieth centuries. It was caught in its internally contradictory relation to its own past as a condition of its back- wardness, which the shaman helped to maintain, and in an external contra- diction in its relation to the Russian empire which comprised and ruled over it. The Buryats in this period had some of the characteristics of an advanced society, internally divided, and opposed within itself, but not all. The social cleavage was neither profound in fact nor symbolically marked; the conflict between higher and lower social classes was barely perceptible, because these classes were hardly formed. The Buryats during our ethnographic present developed pastoralism of a complex and high type; in the protohistoric period, prior to the seventeenth century, they had gotten their subsistence by a com- munal hunt, the zegete-aba, which the shaman directed, serving at once as the lay and the spiritual leader of the social group. The shaman, as the leader of the society in the earlier period, was honored therefor. His relation to his former position in society, during the later period, was wholly external and formal, serving both as the means of holding back the development of Buryat sjciety and as the symbol of its backwardness. The shaman is thus the pro- jection onto the ethnographic present of the past of his social leadership in the collectivity. He is ambivalent in relation to the social history of the en- tirety, representing a social and economic relation that no longer exists in substance, but which is still maintained in rituals as a matter of form. The shaman maintains these relations to the past in his person, just as the group recognizes in him the relation to the wild beasts of the forest that once were hunted en masse, but are so no longer. The shaman's costume by its peltries and pendant animal tails symbolizes those anachronistic relations. The members of the society, including those devoted to the rites of the contemporary shamanism and those who are not, recognize the shaman's power in the shaman himself, just as the shaman recognizes it in himself; the first recognition is the condition of the second, not merely as a source of self-</page><page sequence="3">The Shamanist Tradition of the Buryat» (Siberia) 107 confidence, but as a socially necessary condition. At the same time each devout Buryat recognizes in himself the charisma of the other, the shaman. He ack- nowledges thereby the shaman's power and the validity of his consecration which he himself, the devout, has supported by material means. He is thus already committed to the external acknowledgment of the shaman's conse- cration, which he internalizes as its recognition in himself, and which thus becomes the condition necessary for the shaman's existence and role. The shaman exists in a state of tension with the forces of nature, which he half comprehends and subjects to his manipulations. He functions as healer and diviner, presiding over the ceremonies of the various Buryat groups. The Buryat shaman exists in a state of tension with the members of his society, with other shamans, with other specialists in their ritual, the smiths, or darxat, and the witches or the black shamans. As such he reflects, without generating or advancing, and only by half-comprehending, the am- bivalences, conflicts and tensions of the social group: he understands the particular cases, he has no understanding of the conditions which have gener- ated them. He is a specialist of trance, generating in himself that state, and the related state of the enhancement of the others, which they are prepared both by themselves and through his intermediation to receive. His training is his internal preparation and the preparation of others for these psychic states, which are acquired at great personal cost and risk of mental health, and at like cost and risk alongside the economic cost to his social group, which considers him to be dangerous, a highly specialized and necessary evil, valued therefore. The social history of the ease with which the state of trance is induced is in part a social condition, in part a psychological conditioning. The shaman, at the same time, has a history of mental illness prior to his prepa- ration for his calling, leading up to it, and leading him into it. The group whose shaman he becomes recognizes the potential in the incipient shaman and counts itself fortunate for having such a person for themselves. As we shall see, the Buryat society was not always thus, nor all of it ; nor was shaman- ism always thus among the Buryats, for it was localized in time and space among them, the aberration called forth by them and which they called forth in the shaman. It is neither a deep nor a universal factor of Buryat society and history 1. The collective and individual psychoses directly or indirectly connected with shamanism were not inherent in Buryat nature, but were particular conditions localized in their history during the period which we have taken as their ethnographic present. 1 If we insist on this point it is because psychiatrists and psychoanalysts with whom we have discussed it are generally of another opinion. They have seen in the Buryat shaman a psychic aberration of a universal type. This is partly true, in my view, and the other part will be the thesis here propounded. The aberration is a deep factor in the mental history of the shaman who acted as a goad or incitation, evoking it in his group. The group evoked this state in one of their number, and came to need it. The etiology of this mental state falls outside our purview. Our attention is focussed on the interrelation between the individual mental state and the social history of the condition.</page><page sequence="4">108 Lawrence Krader Anthropos 70. 1975 The shamans by the ambitus and responsibilities of their ritual were divided into two kinds, those who presided over the rites of the larger social groups: the tribe, the clan, the confederations of tribes and clans, and the major lineages; and those presiding over the rites of the village and the family. There was no especial conflict between these two kinds of shaman; many shamans performed both kinds of function. Each type of shamanist role, the greater and the lesser, dealt with different concerns of Buryat life. The sha- manist rites of the large social unities of the Buryats related to the problems of maintenance of the herds of livestock, the main source of livelihood of the Buryats of that time, and to the heightening or lessening of conflicts between the major Buryat social groups among themselves and with the outside world. The lesser shamanist rites dealt with the concerns of daily life of the members of the local kin-group, clustered in the village and the closely related families of the village: with the sickness and death of the individuals and the dying out of families or descent lines; they feared the local black shamans, male and female, believing that these would eat up their souls and cause them to die. Childlessness, the death of the children, fear of being shamed before the society were the concerns of the small social groups of the Buryats, which called into play the shaman's rites on the local scale. The Buryat shaman was not the religious leader, in the sense of being the representative of the cosmic order, the moral order of society, and the cosmic order as reflected in the moral order, his role being more limited in the period we have in mind. In earlier times he was the law-giver, the religious leader, the expression of the laws of the universe and of the social laws, even being their legislator. But during the recent past he was the outsider, taken on sufferance because he was needed to cure a psychic illness which he gener- ated, which the others generated in him, for which they prepared him, for which they prepared themselves, and for which he prepared them, the task for which he was chosen, for which he chose himself, which he could not avoid, but did not want, which was required of him by the group, and which they had come to need and want, which they invented for him. The social group discovered in him the shamanist potentiality which he came to recognize in himself and in the other, he himself being that other. In the distant past, he was a positive figure who represented the social, historical and natural forces that shaped Buryat culture. In the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries he represented an intercessor to whom the Buryats turned in time of trouble; at the same time, shamans were feared, placated and killed for witchcraft. The shaman in this later period maintained a minor role as the representative of the cosmic and moral order; the rites of the largest social unities of the Buryats, which he conducted, were no longer of importance, for the Buryats were now comprised in a far more powerful political entity, the Russian empire; they were gradually settled in wooden houses and sedentary villages toward the end of the period; they underwent the transition from pastoral nomadism to agriculture ; the leader of the larger group was appointed by agreement with the Russian administration. The shaman gradually lost his role as sustainer of the cosmic and moral order</page><page sequence="5">The Shamanist Tradition of the Buryats (Siberia) 109 during the course of the nineteenth century; on this the learned Buryats are agreed. He became the sustainer of a new perception of the cosmic and moral order by his aberrancy. This new order was remarkable for the internal har- moniousness of its representation of the world; it was at the same time discon- tinuous with its shamanist past, and is continuous with its present condition of life without shamanism of either sort 2, save in diluted guises, colorations of contemporary practices, survivals. I. The Buryat Shaman Our concern is primarily with the shamanism of the Buryats who live to the west and north of Lake Baykal, today virtually a thing of the past, the last consecrated shaman having died in 1964, about 80 years of age (Mixaj- lov 1968: 290). Excellent materials were gathered in the last half of the nine- teenth century concerning the shamanism of these Buryats by M. N. Xanga- lov. At the beginning of the twentieth century important material and oral collections were made by C. 2. Zamcarano. During the 1920s, G. D. SanZeev [Sandschejew] published a series of articles on the Alar Buryats. These ethnographic details circumscribe the place, the time and the provenience of our account. It is a commonly held opinion that shamanism is a religion, that the Buryats were once all shamanists and latterly became divided, some remain- ing true to the faith, while those to the east of Lake Baykal became Lamaists. As to the relations between the Lamaists and shamanists, the learned Buryat, Dorzi Banzarov wrote: "The ancient popular religion of the Xalxa Mongols and peoples neighboring them i.e., Buryats was known in Europe by the name of shamanism, but among their descen- dants of the Xalxas it has no especial significance. Mongols at the time of their adoption of Buddhism called it the Black Faith (xara Sajin), i.e., rude, unenlightened, in opposition to Buddhism, which is called the Yellow Faith (§ira §ajin)" 3. Banzarov's account has much truth in it, but more than anything else, regardless of the truth or falsity, it helped to establish, and typified the matrix within which the studies of Mongol and the related Buryat shamanism was to be conducted for the following century 4. Now that Buryat shamanism has become a matter of past history, it is fitting to examine critically its constitution and function. It was the product of an unlettered past, before the Buryats developed their own literature. Most 2 Documentation for these introductory comments will be found below, and in Kräder 1963: 57-115; 1954. 3 Banzarov 1955: 51; - later Rintchen, Vladimircov and Zamcarano found evidence of shamanism among the Xalxas. 4 Cf. Kudriavcev 1940; Rumjancev 1954; Vjatkina 1956; Klementz 1924; Krol' 1896 and 1917; Molodyx and Kulakov 1896.</page><page sequence="6">110 Lawrence Krader Anthropos 70. 1975 of the phenomena of Buryat shamanism, as they are related to the material elements of the practices, are therefore matters of their oral tradition. Buryat shamanism was a monopoly of a professional element in the society, it was a social phenomenon and a specialization of role and function within the society, but it was not an institution associated with schools, seminaries, academies in which a religious doctrine with an associated creed and dogma was devel- oped. The Buryats have been associated with the high cultures of Europe and Asia; they are not, nor where they during this period, a primitive people. But their shamanism is not in any sense a systematic religion 5 administered by a body of specialists, such as is the case among the neighboring religions of Buddhism, Christianity and Islam ; nor is this true of the religions of eastern and northern Asia generally. It would be equally difficult, for example, to speak of systematic religion, in this sense, in traditional China. Therefore, to pair the Black and Yellow Faiths, as Banzarov did, implies a subtle distortion of shamanism; nevertheless, he set forth a deep element of the Buryat and Mongol world- view: There is a division and pairing of shamanism and Bud- dhism, and a color symbolism has been attached to each; these are elements of the Buryat world-view which will be encountered again. The social functions of the shaman as given by Sandschejew (1928: 976) are: 1. Mediator between men and spirits; 2. Specialist in folk-medicine; 3. Maintainer of the shamanist philosophy; 4. Bearer of the traditions of the people. The ritual functions of the shaman were listed by Banzarov (1955: 94) as follows: 1. To bless the start of any sort of undertaking; 2. To exorcize the spirits causing human illness; 3. To protect the herds from diseases or predators; 4. To perform the incantations on hearing the first thunder of spring. Shamanizing, according to Banzarov (1955: 88) is the invocation of spirits, and is applied primarily in ceremonies of curing ; the shaman combines the functions of sorcerer, physician and priest, he is visionary and mystic, joining a burning imagination to knowledge of natural forces. The two lists of functions of the shaman are not complete; others, as social-integrative and psychic-ameliorative, are discussed passim by both authors, and by Xangalov, as we shall see. Above all, they do not differentiate between the various kinds of shaman; they both have in mind the white shamans; but not entirely. Moreover, they do not differentiate the greater shamanism from the lesser. Their listings are nevertheless a good point of departure in considering the functions of the shaman, and permit us to dif- ferentiate between the social and ritual functions in a general way. Sanzeev's 5 Buryat shamanism is considered a more harmonious doctrine than that of their neighbors. Cf. Sandschejew 1930: 41.</page><page sequence="7">The Shamanist Tradition of the Buryats (Siberia) 111 list covers the religious, medical, philosophical and traditionary functions of the shamans ; naturally, there is an overlapping between his list and Banza- rov's: thus, the philosophical would bear upon, or be comprised in, the re- ligious and traditionary, etc. The method of our inquiry will be to examine and critically apply the reports of the learned Buryats; where, as in the case of Banzarov, there is a case of a stereotyped thought which is shared with other learned traditions, hence imposed from without, our task will be to extract elements which relate directly to the Buryat social life and culture, hence did not appear in these reports by chance. We may add that the scientific method demands this in any case, but this is the more important at present because there are no Buryat shamans to test the accuracy of our judgments any more. There is another important reason: there is a virtual absence in the literature of the protocols of interviews, the treasure house of ethnography, with shamans of the Buryats. The development of the study of shamanism by Buryats is such that there is a progression from Banzarov to Xangalov; in the twentieth century, Zamcarano and Sanzeev developed an even higher level of sophisti- cation. None of the writers has contributed as many details as Xangalov. Therefore we are taking the writings on shamanism of D. Banzarov and M. N. Xangalov, C. 2. 2amcarano, and finally G. D. Sanzeev and T. M. Mixaj- lov as a universe of discourse, our primary source materials. They are Buryats, even if they have become learned in Occidental scientific ways, which is true above all in the case of Professor Sanzeev. Second, being Buryats they have had a longer, earlier and more intimate familiarity with the shamanist prac- tices that they have reported; and third, they have established a closer rap- port, marked with a higher degree of understanding, with the Buryat shamans, than anyone else has ever had. Fourth, they have examined critically the conceptions of those coming to the subject from outside, such as N. Agapitov and B. Petri. 1. The Shaman The central figure of Buryat shamanism is the shaman, male bo, female odogoy/odogon, corresponding to Classical Written Mongol bilge, udagan/udugan respectively (Xalxa, Kalmuk bo, etc.). Both male and female shamans are divided into black and white, to which a corresponding orientation or direction, moral status, side or handedness, and affection cr disposition is attributed: Shaman, male or female (Xangalov 1958: 482ff. ; 1958: 363ff.) Orientation west east 6 Side or hand right left (cf. Krader 1963: 63) Color white black Morality good evil Affection love fear 6 The orientation according to Kudriavcev (1940: 28) is not east -west, but north- east-southwest. The heavenly cosmology coincides with the physical geography of Lake Baykal which extends in a great curve from the northeast to the southwest.</page><page sequence="8">112 Lawrence Krader Anthropos 70. 1975 According to the given dichotomy the white shamans are in the service of the western deities and are helpful, the black are in the service of the eastern and are harmful to men; the white shamans intermediate with the spirits in behalf of human weal, the black in behalf of human woe. To the white sha- mans is attributed likewise an orientation to the upper world (of the west) or the setting sun; to the black, an orientation to the underworld and to the sunrise. (The traditional yurt of the Buryats is so arranged that right and west likewise coincide.) These shamans struggle not only in favor of or against human beings and their fate, but also with and against the spirits, which are likewise divided by orientation, side or hand, color, morality, affection or disposition toward men; the two kinds of shaman fight against each other. Xangalov in the references cited mentions that they eat each other, or people. What is meant by this is shown more explicitly elsewhere by him and by Sandschejew (1928: 976-977) : It is people's souls or spirits, and the same of shamans1 souls or spirits, white or black, that they swallow up (Buryat : idexe, literally, to eat). This commentary on the soul or spirit indicates a compli- cation that is not readily explicable in Occidental conceptions, for the Buryat pneumatology is more intricate than the formal Judaeo-Christian one. The dual structure of the spirit world indicated in the foregoing passage is then organized in the traditional Buryat cosmology and pneumatology upon the basis of a trichotomy. The Buryats have conceived the spiritual world as a parallel to the organization of the Buryat social world: the social world is divided into three, the spirits into three, and the souls of men into three. All these trichotomies are hierarchized: Society is divided into the highborn, the commoners, and the slaves. The spirits, being the highest feature of Buryat worship, are vener- ated, invoked for blessing, and for exorcism of evil and sickness, human and zootic; they are divided into the high, the middle and the low. The higher spirits, tengeriner, live in heaven, and are directly or indirectly in control of everything in the cosmos, taking care of mankind. They are in turn divided into three, the two lower ranks within the superior category functioning as intercessors between man and the highest beings. The spirits of the middle rank are considered to be those of the commoner Buryats; they are the spirits in the service of the shaman. Finally, there are the social class, and the spirits, of the slaves. In each of the parallel hierarchies of spirits and men the lower orders are subordinate to the highest. The triple division of the cosmology and society is paralleled again in the triple division of the Buryat doctrine of man, their traditional anthropol- ogy. Man is conceived as being composed of three parts: body, beje, the physical organism ; amin, the principle of breath and life resident in the living organism ; and hilnehen, the soul of man, which in turn is submitted to a triple division, again hierarchized into an upper, middle and lower order in the Buryat pneumatology. There are indeed numerous souls of man, and the hierarchy is not a simple, but a category into which the various souls are cast. The first of these souls is the lowest, that which is housed in the human body, more particularly in the skeleton, and in the skeleton as a whole, not in any</page><page sequence="9">The Shamanist Tradition of the Buryats (Siberia) 113 one part. (It is the skeleton which is the visual frame of the shaman's costume, outlined on his boots and cloak.) The lowest soul is the invisible copy of the skeleton, and if the skeleton is injured, as by the breaking of a bone, that soul is harmed. Animals are in possession of such a soul, and in sacrificial rites, the bones of the consecrated beast are protected from injury, otherwise its soul would be injured and the sacrifice would be rejected by the deity to whom it was offered. The second soul has the capacity to leave the body and live in the world ; it can transform itself into a flying thing, as a wasp or bee, and can undertake activities of which its owner is unconscious. In its original state it is anthropomorphic, and its seat is the organs of the trunk of a man: the heart, liver, lungs, also the larynx, and the blood as well. This soul is easily alarmed, and is disposed to flee from danger, and must then be tempted back, especially in the case of the middle class of souls of the child. It is this soul which is invoked, projected and manipulated in the shamanistic rites, e.g., in the curing of illness. The third or highest soul is called on death to the highest tengeri, and its passing marks the end of the mortal span of him to whom it was attached. Aside from this it is little distinguishable from the second soul, for both reflect the physical and social condition of the man, in health and wealth, in this life and the afterlife; they have the physical and psychological attributes of the owner. The chief soul has a character, good or bad, as that of its owner; if the man was a good man, his kinsmen will ask his highest soul to intercede on their behalf before the tengeri; if he was evil, then that soul is evil and dangerous: it is the cause of sickness in children and of female illnesses among women, and must be propitiated by offerings 7. If we scrape away that which was borrowed by Banzarov from the European conceptions, we perceive that the ordering of the world of men and nature by a division based upon a color symbolism is repeated and complicated among the Buryats. It is not an absolute dualism, for the forces of good and evil are not balanced, nor is the outcome in doubt. The man's life determines his fate ; there is no other fatalism. The amount of good or evil that he does or brings about is weighed and balanced, and his life after death is thereby determined. The role of the white shaman, however, is to effectuate the good outcome, and prevent its frustration by the evil spirits and the black shamans who serve them. Thus, the comparison with another religious system, that of the dualism of the ancient Avesta, or that of the dualist (heresy) of Christi- anity, is not entirely borne out among the Buryats, there being only a super- ficial analogy between the Avestic conflict, which opposes the forces of light and of darkness, and that of the white and black shamans of Buryat shaman- ism 8. 7 For documentation of these data see Kräder 1954 : 326-328. 8 In the ancient Persian and the traditional Buryat conceptions, in the dualist heresy of Christianity and of Islam, in Mahayana Buddhism, and in Manichaeanism, but not in Judaism, Nestorian and orthodox Christianity nor in orthodox Islam, good and evil are both creative principles. Nevertheless, the nature of the conflict, and the relative balance of forces of good and evil, differs between the ancient Persian and the Buryat conceptions. The State cult found in the ancient Avesta is absent in the Buryat, although Anthropos 70. 1975 8</page><page sequence="10">114 Lawrence Krader Anthropos 70. 1975 E. B.Tylor (1958: 194-195) distinguished between spirit and soul, con- sidering the spirit to be simply the personification of an (abstract) causality; souls, on the other hand are spirits proper to men. The importance of this view is that it is embedded in Tylor's theory of animism, which has been adopted by many 9 as the general category of religion within which shaman- ism is found. But this analysis of the Buryat spirit-soul relation must be further analyzed: the middle class of Buryat souls, and the upper, both of which are closest to man, are a projection of the given individual's personality, the lowest is not. Thus we have to modify Tylor's thought to make it appli- cable to the Buryat conception of the spirit world. There is a further evidence of a dichotomy which is carried through, but this takes the form of a polar- ization, at one end of which is an abstract spiritual being, which Tylor calls the personification of a cause, at the other end is the soul, the expression of the individual personality, with its physical possessions, its mental faculties such as cleverness or dullness, etc. and its disposition (e.g. meanness, gener- osity). The given personality in its composition is a feature of the Buryat conception of the individual and of his middle and upper souls ; in opposition is the feature of the heavenly spirit which orders the sunrise and sunset, seasons, growth of livestock, disease or health of men and beasts, and so on. These are causes of the natural order as they were understood by the tra- ditional Buryats, whose pneumatology was not particularly shamanistic; for those Buryats who were Lamaists, as the Xori of Transbaykalia, had a con- ception of the world that was not different at that time from that of the western Buryats. In a general way the distinction made by Tylor is valid in application to the traditional Buryats, but its contents must be considerably modified. Thus, the lowest soul of the Buryats is more like a spirit in Tylor's conception. the greater shamanism of the latter sought at various times (e.g., early in the nineteenth century) to establish such a cult. The doctrines of the two peoples differed in their angel- ology and diabology. If Wilhelm Radloff is cited in connection with dualism in Asian beliefs, it is not in order to explicate a Buryat matter, but in order to separate it from the ancient Iranic dualism. Radloff wrote (1884: 13) : "In the world of shamanism there is no eternal uprightness. The gods of light and of darkness do not act according to ethical principles, but allow themselves to be won over by sweet offerings..." Buryat shamanism is neither as "unprincipled" as that of the Turks of Southern Siberia, whom Radloff had in mind, nor as strict in their dualism as the ancient Avestans. Above all, we cannot be misled by such terms as 'gods of light and darkness', for this places too much emphasis on a parallel with the Mazdaism of the ancient Iranians, which is spurious from the viewpoint of the contents of the beliefs and practices of Turks and Buryats alike. Vla- dimircov (1925) has pointed, finally, to a formal derivation of words in modern Buryat not to a connection of the cultic side (cf. Persian Ormuzd, A hura Mazda; Buryat Xurmus, etc.; cf. Weinstein 1964: Tuvinian Kurbustu). 9 Bogoraz 1904-1909; Klementz 1924; Kudriavcev 1940; Tokarev 1956; Mixajlov 1968; Benedict 1938.</page><page sequence="11">The Shamanist Tradition of the Buryats (Siberia) 115 2. Being and Becoming a Shaman The difficulty with the proposition of a sharp spirit-soul dichotomy is to be found in the closer examination of Buryat shamanism proper, as opposed to their pneumatology in general. There are several ways to become a shaman among the Buryats; the most important is the possession of (and possession by) a shaman ancestral spirit, called utxa in Buryat. It may be regarded at once as a generalized spirit of the given shamanist descent line and alter- natively as the soul of the particular shaman-ancestor, or both at the same time, depending on whether the particular person or the entire line, or some part of it is intended. Sanzeev conceived it as an independent force moving alongside and about the actual genealogical line, zigzagging in and out of it, now skipping a generation, now appearing in the female line or in a collateral branch10. Xangalov (1958: 482; 1958: 144-145) generally referred to it as an abstract concept (rather than in terms of the vivid imagery of Sanzeev), that of the origination, root or core. Each shaman has an utxa, his line, shared with the other shamans in it, has an utxa; the two are both the same and other. Thus it is a spirit and a soul, the spirit of a single person and the soul of the many: the utxa has no particular personality, therefore it is not a soul; yet all these definitions may be overstrict. Not all Buryat descent lines have such an utxa, only the shamanist. Moreover, the utxa may descend either through males or females, whereas the Buryat genealogical system is patri- lineal, as a rule. For the following Buryat shaman descent line, a man, origi- nally of the Tarsaj ulus of the Kuda Buryats, later resident in the Kulunkun ulus, married the daughter of a mighty black female shaman (her name is not given) (Xangalov 1958: 485): 6.

Fidot male black shaman This is a six-generation genealogy, which is quite usual in Buryat tra- ditional social life, for it defined a frequently encountered exogamic group. The founding ancestor, with reference to the utxa, however, was the woman, a black shaman, whose younger son (her elder son did not become a shaman), Hoxor-Xara-Köstö (xara 'black') was also a black shaman, as were his de- scendants, down to the fourth generation. The last-named descendant bears a Russified name. The genealogy extends from the end of the seventeenth 10 Sandschejew 1928: 978, cf. p. 977.

The Bulagats and Exirits are assumed to be exogamous at this time. Totxoto married a daughter of Unjatxa, an Exirit Buryat. Both Bulagat and Exirit are divisions of the western, or Cis-Baykal, Buryats. b) At this time the last battue hunt, Tajtarugi-zegete-aba, of these Buryats took place. Thereafter the predominant form of economic life was pastoralism. c) Barlak was a white shaman (ibid. 127-128). d) In this generation shamanism declined among Buryats (ibid. 133). Neither of Barlak's sons had a call or gift (Xangalov : desire) to become a shaman. e) Balixaj was born in 1753, 11 years old in 1764 (ibid. 136). /) Balixaj was reckoned to be ca. ninety years old when M. N. Xangalov's father Nikolaj was 5 years old (ibid. 148). Nikolaj is assumed to have been born in the 1830s, about 85 years after the birth of his grandfather (further precision is idle). During Balixaj 's lifetime, agriculture and wooden dwellings were introduced among Buryats. Xangai was buried, replacing cremation. g) From Balixaj 's birth (4th ascending generation) to M. N. Xangalov's is 105 years. By the evidence of the generation count and generation lengths given in both Xangalov's and Sanzeev's studies, we infer that the white shaman Barlak was born ca. 1700. The beginning of the genealogy, in the generation of Totxoto's father-in-law dates therefore from the latter part of the sixteenth century. Barlak was the unique shaman in this line, who received his gift as a youth on a journey from his kinsmen's village to his home, while alone, asleep at the foot of the mountain Talgata. A great horseman, one of the western spirits, dressed in white, riding a white horse, appeared in the dream. The white costume included many bands and animal skins (cf. Krader 1956 : 382- 392). The man struck Barlak's head, uttering the word: Tarxaj; Barlak became a white shaman, serving the western etc. spirits. He was consecrated in his dignity by the shaman Abada of the Bulut Buryats, receiving nine drums and the great cloak of the highest rank of shamans. He avoided strife with the black shamans, hence was unlike the other shamans of his kind; he gradu- ally became a wealthy man. His wife, Bere, drank much, and was a capricious person, violent when drunk. The white shaman Barlak married two female spirits, by one of whom, DoSxin-Somon, he had two daughters. He had two sons and a daughter by his wife on earth (Xangalov 1958: 127 f.). Barlak entered into a disputation with the white shaman Malanak, of the Kuda Bur- yats, the latter maintaining that the heavenly spirits suffered, as did the earthly folk, from sickness, etc. Barlak, however, maintained that the life of the three ranks of heavenly spirits, tengeri, xat, zajan, was free from care (ibidem 130-131). Few Buryat accounts of the reception of the shaman's gift are as circum- stantial as that provided by Xangalov in respect of his own ancestor Barlak. Aside from these means of becoming a shaman, a Buryat became a shaman as well by other means (ibidem 370-371): 1.) A person who was killed by 11 The data concerning the length of the genealogy and the generation count is an important contribution.

Bümal iulun (manifestation 12 of the stone, Sulun). If a person drank tarasun, the distillation of the fermented milk containing a thunderstone in it, he could (would?) become a shaman, such a potion being accounted more than ordinarily powerful. Such a shaman was accounted budal utxataj, endowed with the utxa of lightning, budal. (It is implied that meteorites are connected with, or the products of , lightning.) In reference to his own ancestors, Xangalov wrote, "White shamans, both male and female, of that period [Barlak's time] still enjoyed the respect and love of the people, but these affections were not so easily acquired, on top of this one must be clever, with a natural gift of the modern shaman's inspiration. Rich clansmen eschewed this, for the people already began to hold the shaman in a certain mistrust, even misprision and dislike. A proverb tells of this : Xun müzarxada bo bolxo, A man degenerating becomes a shaman, Xonin muYxada loro bolxo A sheep emaciating becomes a pacer. Another old Buryat proverb runs : Zürxelhen xün bo bolxo A painstaking person becomes a shaman. Hence, in former times, in order to become a shaman it was necessary to take great pains and much time to learn well how to shamanize, to practise the various shamans' ways, skills at body movements, voice mimicry, etc." 13. Xangalov's conception of the history of the shaman has been known from the time of his writings of the zegete-aba: the ancient Buryats practised the collective hunting surround, a form of primitive communism, in which every adult participated, both men and women, and all received an equal share in the product. The possession of a horse in the hunt was not general, and influenced the distribution of the product, disturbing the notion of pure communism. Later, the direction of the hunt fell into the hands of the shaman. In the period of decline of the zegete-aba, the shaman also lost his power 14. The proverb cited by Xangalov was repeated in a variation by San- zeev in a later version (Sandschejew 1928: 983) : xüni mû bõ bolxo, morihï mû loro bolxo. The worst of men becomes a shaman, the worst of horses becomes a pacer15. 12 The manifestation is a supernatural omen. Thus, in the shamanist and lamaist beliefs, a striking feature of the landscape, as a stand of trees in the middle of a plain, or a stone visible in the middle of a body of water, is remarked as a bumal burxan, a manifestation of the Burxan, Buddha, high god, etc. 13 Xangalov 1958: 134. The account here given is a posthumous publication. 14 Xangalov 1958: 11-32. ObSõestvennye oxoty u severnyx Burjat (zegete-aba na rossomax) (1958: 33-95). Joint with Klementz cf. 1958: 54-55, also pp. 96-100. The relation of Xangalov's historical reconstruction of shamanism to his general notion of Buryat history will be discussed below. 15 An ambler (or pacer) is a horse that has been taught an unnatural and diffi- cult pace.</page><page sequence="15">The Shamanist Tradition of the Buryats (Siberia) 119 Sanzeev's gloss of this proverb is that it points to the miserable con- dition of the shaman (1928 : 982-983) ; he is under obligation to the lineage because his training and his paraphernalia are costly; it is they who undertake the cost of his preparation. This point is also made by Xangalov (1958 : 134) ; both indicate the opposition between social riches and the shaman's plight. Implicit is the fact that the shaman's is a specialized and highly trained craft. The shaman is the worst kind of human being, in a psychopathological state that often leads to his death. No causal connection is drawn between the mental and physical condition of misery of the shaman on the one side and his low status on the scale of desirable companionship by the Buryats on the other. It is rather that these considerations are associated with each other and with the social function and personality of the shaman in the Bur- yat view. The shaman performs socially useful functions, and is maintained by his kinsmen therefor. He maintains his relations with the spirit world as a grave risk. The Buryats have taken as shamans certain of their number, chiefly the descendants of shamans, but only certain individuals in the shaman descent line. The shaman candidate has dreams of the sort mentioned above by Xangalov, he faints, falls in convulsions. His utxa demands of him that he become a shaman, continuing the work of the shaman line. He becomes nervous, has hallucinations ; all shamans known to Sanzeev, about 100, became so unwillingly. The prospective shaman becomes indolent, ill-tempered, shy of men. The spirit, translated into the shaman, sings through his mouth while he is in a state of trance. The shaman MaxoSkeev was antishamanist in his youth ; on falling sick he went to Irkutsk for (western medical) treatment, in vain. The spirits told him he must become a shaman (Sandschejew 1928: 972-979). The shaman masters and is mastered by the spirits, just as he is in a dual relation to his community and society. His kinsmen and neighbors need him, and at the same time hate and fear him. (This relation was not the case in Barlak's time, according to Xangalov, but changed thereafter, lasting down to the early twentieth century.) The traditional Buryat society had a different calculus of personality types than that which is fostered by occidental civilization. The shaman in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries was usu- ally in need of psychic or other kind of social-medical help himself. The sha- man Barlak had an unhappy family life; we will have occasion to revert to this in discussing the ongons and najgur below. Generally, the shamans existed in a state of tension and a relation of opposition that was resolved in a fan- tastic way, by visions and hallucinations ; this was found useful in application by the Buryats, who thus sought to resolve their social tensions and opposi- tions, likewise in a fantastic way. The relation of tension and opposition was particularly marked in the black shamans, male and female, who opposed both the white shamans and the ordinary Buryats. A female black shaman was hated by her neighbors, who feared that she would have the evil spirits eat them. They called in two black shamans who sought to destroy her utxa, for which they were to receive forty head of stock. They were ineffective, however, and had to call in a third</page><page sequence="16">120 Lawrence Krader Anthropos 70. 1975 black shaman, in order to bring about her death. They buried her face down- ward, in a coffin of aspen wood (an unclean wood), transfixed to the soil by spears of aspen wood (Xangalov 1958: 484). Hatred between neighbors among the Buryats is focussed upon one person, in this case an old, isolated person; on this basis, Buryat black shamanism may be classified as witchcraft, comparable to that found in New England in the seventeenth century. A black shaman of the Kuda Buryats lent money to a Buryat named Tasxan of the Bilcir (Xangalov's own group). The black shaman asked for the return of the sum, but Tasxan did not comply, and the black shaman appealed to Barlak (Xangalov's ancestor). Barlak required that Tasxan repay the black shaman, who demanded interest on the loan; this Barlak refused to allow. The angry black shaman then sacrificed to the eastern spirit, Boro- Sarga, petitioning that he eat (the spirits of) Barlak and his family. Boro- Sarga required something in turn from the black shaman, who was obligated to give it to him. On returning home he found his younger son on the point of death ; the dying son told his father that that which wanted to eat Barlak and his children gave to Boro-Sarga his, the black shaman's, own son (Xan- galov 1958: 122-123). We may note the themes of hatred, fear and guilt in this account; it is a tale of the lesser shamanism, of the small village group. The spirit speaks through the shaman's mouth. The ongons are images or representations made of felt, fur, wood, etc., of the spirits; they are the spirit's mouth, with whose help the shaman communicates with the spirit world, and to the society. Both the shaman and the ongon are the mouth or speaker. The ongon is at the same time, in one of its forms, a mask, the sym- bolic property of the shaman. The Börtö ongon, or Börötö öbögön of the Xalxa Buryats, Nelxaj district (börtö "grey", öbögön "elder") is the figure of a human head, made out of wood, with a mouth ; in the mouth is a piece of fat ; it has a nose, eyes, eyebrows, moustache and beard. "From the shaman's invocation it is evident that the ongon Borto was borne there by the shaman Horton from Mongolia. Beside this ongon the Balagán Buryats have no other [in common]" (Xangalov 1958: 190). An exhaustive study of the Buryat ongons was made by Zamcarano, according to whom the term ongon designates both the figure itself and the spirit which it represents. There are two categories of ongons: 1. Great shamans, male and female, or princes. These protect the devout from misfortune. They are the edzens (masters) of mountains, valleys, etc., to whom offerings are made as mighty and high beings. 2. The lower order of ongons are the spirits of Buryats who died untimely, suicides, the miserable, the deranged. These spirits are weak, nagging, but dangerous, feared because they may attack infants and the sock. The rites of this second sort are a private, family affair, the sacrificial offerings bearing the character of a redemption or ransom. The sacrifice on their behalf is in fact called their nourishment. The first type of ongon rites have a more public and broad character (2amcarano 1909). The ongons may be schematized, according to 2amcarano's specifications, as follows :</page><page sequence="17">The Shamanist Tradition of the Buryats (Siberia) 121 Ongons Social relation Public Private Institution Tribal, clan Village, family Temperament Masterful Weak Disposition Generous Mean, vengeful Rank High Low The ongons are further divided, without respect to the above character- istics, as follows : warm (their own) : xalün foreign: xari They are geographic and general, or related to a specific group, whether local or large-scale (see above). Further, they are divided as cosmic/geographic versus human. 2amcarano recounts the provenience of the ongons that he collected among the Aga (Transbaykal) Buryats at the beginning of the twentieth cen- tury. In regard to the second category of ongons, one represents a girl, Arxan, daughter or daughter in law of the shaman Arbaj of the Kori Buryats. She was married in the late months of pregnancy and was mocked by the young people, and died; on her death she became an ongon (2amcarano 1909: 386- 387). These Transbaykal Buryats were under the domination of Lamaism; how- ever, the shamans among them sought to counter-attack ; "Under the pretext of despair from drought and crop failure, the shamans prepared bloody sacrifices to tengris, heavenly spirits, on a vast scale, the cult of ongons was strengthened in the form of shapes of shamans of old, a few people were consecrated as shamans, etc." (¿amcarano 1909: 380). Thus ongons played a role both in the larger political scene and in the private lives of people. Nevertheless, we observe that ongons played a role wholly external to shamanism, combining with it, but also separating from it. The shamans used the ongons to their purpose; the people turned to the ongons as they did to the shamans for their own purpose : to calm their fears or voice their despair, in the face of misfortune. The western Buryat cult of ongons was more closely tied to shamanism just as their shamanist practices were more developed than the eastern. Sand- schejew (1928: 934f.) reports the ceremonies of shamans in connection with ongon-spints for the protection of the livestock, sacrificing an animal, dedica- ting it to the protective spirit of the stock (adaha ongolxo: adahan, cattle; ongolxo, infinitive verbal form, from ongon). 2amcarano (1909: 380-381) re- counts the story of a girl, Dabaj who was educated, a school teacher, bak§i. She became an ongon, protector of livestock, but there is some confusion as to how she, a Buddhist, became involved in this cult. The ongons described by Xangalov have in certain cases no connection with shamanism, in par- ticular those involved with the private or family cult (1958: 135-136). It may be posited both of the eastern and western Buryats that the private thematics</page><page sequence="18">122 Lawrence Krader Anthropos 70. 1975 of the ongons are the same, having only a superficial connection with shaman- ism. Both the family cult of ongons and the family shamanist rites had the same end, that of alleviating the sense of misery and misfortune. The ongons of the private cults had a connection, in the majority of cases cited by Xan- galov and Zamcarano, with personal unhappiness and misfortune: women who died young, before marriage, people who died of hunger, families whose fire died out. 3. The najgur We shall consider the najgur as ancillary and supportive rather than as a matter substantive to Buryat shamanism. It is the state of preparation for the Buryat shamanistic hallucination ör possession. Kulakov (1896), who was among the first to call attention to the term and its meaning in Buryat sha- manism, considered it to be the background to becoming a shaman: those became shamans who suffered from these seizures, entering into the shaman's trance in the ceremony itself, having passed through the preparatory state of najgur. Mixajlov has added much to our understanding of the phenomenon: here it is a ceremony performed by a group of people in a kind of collective psychosis or hysteria; as many as 20-30 people gathered around a psychically disturbed person wandering from village to village, going into the homes, performing a swaying/tottering dance (in Buryat najgafa, hence the noun, najgur), singing or chanting a prayer in the form of a lament in a chorus. The najgur groups, despite, or because of the mental state of the leader, had dura- bility, were institutionalized in the given form, and had a known content in their ritual song and dance; for example, the najgur group of the Alar Bur- yats lamented a certain childless Balixaj. The content of the najgur is sorrow- ful, consisting of laments expressing the misery of suffering man, his appeals to the supernatural redeemer for surcease. Thus, in the najgur "Ancient Zajan" (spirits) the orphaned life of two Xori maidens is told, how they were neglected by their stepmother and the lamas, how they were driven from their Xori kin, wandering in the white light. This najgur dance is found among the Alar and Boxan (both western) Buryats, where the orphans became honored as western zajans - holy martyrs. The najgur is marginal to the phenomena of Buryat shamanism. It is doubtful whether the concept of martyrdom, for example, is other than a Christian acculturation. More important, the conflict, alluded to above between the Xori (Buddhist, eastern) Buryats and the Alar (shamanist, western) Buryats has its echo in Mixajlov's circumstantial account. The najgur group appears to have been formed around the shaman; on the other hand, very few spirits were dedicated to these groups (Mixajlov 1968: 290; Klementz 1924: 7). The najgur appears to be an intermediate phenomenon, between the greater shamanism and the lesser, the small, family rites. In its thematics - and again we apply the distinction set forth above by 2amcarano and Mixajlov regarding the ongon cult - the najgur is concerned with private</page><page sequence="19">The Shamanist Tradition of the Buryats (Siberia) 123 woe. This is opposed to the major thematics of the greater shamanism of the Buryats, which is concerned with the protection of the herds, the astral, meteorological and seasonal phenomena of nature. 4. The Buryat uliger The heroic tales and songs (uliger) of the Buryats have a definite if restricted relation to shamanism. The principal relation between the hero of the uliger and the shaman is one of tension; it is primarily with the female shaman : "The uligers express religious conceptions which has not yet extended from the frame of animism. Recourse to worship was not connected with particular rituals, for- mulae of worship were simple and pronounced by the hero himself. The heroes bypassed the shamans; even more, the female shamans, opposing the hero (as in the uliger 'Ajduraj Mergen') are destroyed." In the uliger Abaj Geser, the female shaman gathers human tears which she hurls at the heavens, into the hut of Xormusta, in the battle with evil monsters. This, however, is an exceptional matter; usually the hero acts alone (ULANOV1963: 177). Zamcarano studied the heroic tale Ajduraj Mergen (the Wise) and his sister Agu Goxon in which is recounted the episode of Sodogoj xan (1959: 14), the dwarf shaman (female) ; likewise an episode of the uliger Alamii Mergen concerns a female shaman Arianajxan (Zamcarano 1959: 52). These episodes have no particular reference to shamanism as we know it ; the shaman presides at a wedding ceremony, she is a dwarf no higher than 0.7 meters, in the ser- vice of a prince. The uligers have to do with complex society, with a prince, his court and retinue, etc. Moreover, as Ulanov has pointed out (1963: 175), the outlook of the uliger is optimistic ; the hero can conquer through his own resources over the evil forces of nature. Shamanism, on the other hand, is more complex: the family rite of shamanism, likewise the rites of the ongons and najgurs, are fearful, without hopeful outcome. The greater shamanist ceremonies, however, are not unlike the uligers in outlook, for they abound in optimism, in hope of the shaman's powers. The time of reference of the uligers long antedates the ethnographic present of our account. II. Buryat Shamanism in Relation to Other Shamanisms Buryat shamanism was a concrete social and historical phenomenon, characterizing the traditions of Buryat culture, in the form that we know it, from the seventeenth to the early twentieth centuries. The traditions included a world- view, folk-medicine and a religio-magical cult of nature. It was a re- adaptation to new political, economic and social conditions of an earlier set of cultural practices, in the course of which the shaman's social role and his</page><page sequence="20">124 Lawrence Krader Anthropos 70. 1975 cult came to be segmented and distorted. Nevertheless, because of the high place of Buryat culture as a whole among the peoples of eastern Siberia, the new shamanism, even in the given form, has been taken as the climax of the development of shamanism in that part of the world. It is not the place here to discuss shamanism as a world-wide phenome- non. Elsewhere, we have tried to show that shamanism has been used in various senses : - as the religion of an ecstatic, charismatic leader (in a number of Christian, Jewish, Buddhist, Islamic and other cults and sects), hence as an element in any or all religions ; as the religion associated with specific cui tic practices (world-tree, fire cult, soul-loss and -flight, etc.) ; as the tradition of a group of neighboring and in part related peoples of north and east Asia; as a broad cultural phenomenon including a religious component. Until there is agreement on general usage, further precision is idle. (Thus, for example, ecstasy is a feature of romantic love in European and Oriental literature of the nineteenth century; it appears to have an archaic root.) We will therefore restrict our use of the term to the Buryats, as we have set it forth here. It is not a dualistic creed, any more than the ancient dualisms were shamanistic ; we have tried to parse out the meaning of Radloff and Vladimircov in this sense, but only on the surface of the problem. Shamanism is not the religion of a magician, although the shaman performs the acts depending on mass- suggestion and auto-suggestion of magic. Moreover, the shaman is and at the same time is not a priest. The distinctions are factitious and verbal. Sha- manism among the Buryats is a body of traditions that sought to understand the world of nature and man in a way that mixed together elements of sophisti- cation and primitivity; it sought to manipulate the world of nature, of the small social groups and large political unities in accordance with human inten- tions. The manipulations were in accordance with keen observations of nature and human society on the one hand and crude advantage taken of naive, suffering people on the other. The shaman's gaze and vision, his messages and paraphernalia are the technics of a distinctive social role and cult, philosophy, psychology, and morality. The existence of shamanism among other peoples will be argued here, but not as a common phenomenon, rather as variations, the central theme of which exists nowhere; there is no essence or classical form of shamanism. This thesis must be immediately modified. The shamanism of the western Buryats was considered to be more harmonious in its world-view than that of the Darxats of Xövsgöl, western Mongolia (Sandschejew 1930: 41-42; Dioszegyi 1963: 57-81). The Tungus are held to have taken over, by means historically specified or not, some of the shamanist practices and beliefs from the Buryats (also from Manchus and Yakuts) 16. Buryat shamanism is thus regarded as the center or high point by comparison with the shamanism practised by peoples living to the southwest and northeast of them. Although we regard 16 Shirokogorov 1935 : 407. - Vasileviõ (1959 : 157f .) has proposed the further dif- fusion of elements of spiritual culture from Tungus-Evenks to the Chukchis. The assumption of movement in both cases from complex to simpler societies, appears valid here.</page><page sequence="21">The Shamanist Tradition of the Buryats (Siberia) 125 the shamanism of each people as an entity per se, we recognize that they are in contact with their neighbors, and some commonalties and influences can be drawn among them. On the other hand, there is neither a uniform doctrine nor uniform cult of shamanism nor a hierarchy among all the peoples accounted shamanist. Moreover, shamanism monopolizes neither the religious, medical, philosophical nor loristic forms of the peoples in question. The shaman as a specialist of the society, applying the technics of trance to the acts of curing and divination, has been described in all parts of the world. The specialization has led to a general theory of the shaman in con- nection with the division of labor in society 17, which is relevant to the Buryat data pertaining to the economics of shamanism, as collected by Xangalov and by Sanzeev. The political side needs to be examined further in connection with the distinction that we have drawn between the greater shamanism and the lesser, a distinction already implicit in the writings of 2amcarano and Sanzeev. During the nineteenth century Buryat shamans sought to organize politi- cal movements and a proto-state formation, particularly directed against the Lamaists. In making these attempts they drew a line between their operations on the grand political scale, affecting the fates of nations and empires, and the small social scale of their activities. Further, in acting on the grand scale they sought to revive, in a changed form, the role of leader of the community that was ascribed to them by Buryat tradition in ages past. The change in form of the community, the society and the polity, and the external relations of the Buryats, doomed the political adventure by the shamans beforehand; they, however, had only a dim awareness of the historical and social changes that made their plans impossible of achievement. We shall examine below the social and psychological implications of the distinction between the greater and the lesser shamanism, and of the periodization in question; here we shall say only that this theory of the periodization was made relevant to the Bur- yats by Xangalov who reported such a tradition among them. In regard to the Buryats, we must distinguish therefore between a scientific theory as such, which is capable of being tested for its truth, or degree of truth, and a folk tradition. The Buryats believed the periodization to be true, wherein, at an earlier time, they lived under the leadership of the shaman. Shamanism, according to this tradition, was the collective cult of their ancestors at the time that the basis of their subsistence was the practice of the great communal battue. Life was in common, the product of the hunt was shared by all. Wil- helm Radloff early announced the theoretical relation of shamanism and the hunting culture ; it has had both echoes and further development in con- temporary writings of Okladnikov (1955 : 166 f.), Anisimov (1952), Findeisen, (1957), and Lommel (1965).

Harva, Âke Ohlmarks, Mircea Eliade, A. E. Jensen, A. F.

On the other hand, Xangalov, Sanzeev, Stern- berg, Shirokogorov (1935), Zelenin (1936) and the present writer have proposed that shamanism is to be regarded not only from the viewpoint of its religious or religio-magical, but also of its philosophical, naturalist (primi- tive or proto-scien tifie), and medical, elements and functions. The latter inter- pretive tendency - it is not at all a school - fits the Buryat materials best. This consideration is linked to another: the term "religion" is given a meaning by the first set of writers that deprives it of concrete reference for our purpose. The attitude of scepticism follows from two distinctions that are offered for consideration. The concerns of religion cover those of shamanism only in part, as we have seen ; the concerns of shamanism of the Buryats cover those of religion also only in part. Thus shamanism has a limited area of contact with religious belief, practice or rite, and doctrine. (We will not pursue this matter, being conscious of the unusual complexity of the problem and the conflict of opinions in reference to it.) The second distinction is more concrete, regarding what is meant by the world religions, Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam ; these are world religions in the sense that they have consciously formu- lated policies of ecumenism, that is, of the quest for commonalty of rite, belief and doctrine, purporting to overcome the differences of culture, language, social class, nationality, region, locality and historical accident. Such a state- ment is evidently nonsense if it is said of shamanism, which exists only in the cultural life of particular peoples, who have no holy text or doctrine in common, and to whom ecumenism is an external affair. The question of a limited shamanist ecumenism, on the other hand, may be situated : 1. In the objective reality of the facts; 2. In the subjective viewpoint of the outside observer who may desire that it exist for reasons of his own beliefs and persuasions. 3. In the objective conclusions drawn from the facts by the outside observer as ethnologist (which is almost never without admixture of 2.). To this schema we shall add : The shamanist ecumenism may be regarded as a fact by the shamanist devout. This is in turn a complex matter, for it touches on what may or may not be accepted as a fact. Thus: 18 Bogoraz 1904-1909; 1910; Jochelson 1926; Sternberg 1925; Kagarov 1913; Schmidt 1931, 1949, 1952, 1954, 1955; MacCulloch 1920; Benedict 1938; Lowie 1952; Radin 1937; Klementz 1924; White 1959; Harva 1938; Ohlmarks 1939; Eliade 1951; Jensen 21960; Anisimov 1959; Findeisen 1957. 19 Schmidt (1955: 659) regarded shamanism as a degenerated form oí religion, Findeisen (1957 : 200) has defended shamanism from this form of attack.</page><page sequence="23">The Shamanist Tradition of the Buryats (Siberia) 127 a) it may be a subjective judgement, the desire or wishful thinking by the shamanist. In turn it raises the question, long a part of the sciences of man: is a social fact a fact if it is so regarded by the members of the society? (cf. Thomas and Znaniecki 1918: Introd.); b) it touches on the question of the native informant or any sort of layman as an ethnologist, who has himself drawn his conclusions from cross- cultural observation, comparison and generalization. Petri (1925) in respect of the Buryats and Bogoraz (1904-1909: 414) 20 in respect of the Chukchis have indicated that these peoples have placed themselves and their neighbors, all the peoples together who have a shared belief in the shaman's powers, on one side, and foreigners (Christians) on the other. Moreover, we have already cited the relations that have been drawn by Sanzeev and Dioszegyi between Buryat and Darxat shamanism. However, ethnologists have written of shamanism in North America, Panama, Chile, and Australia, raising a question of the commonalty of the phenomena of a totally different order, which has never, to my knowledge, been separately discussed, and then brought together, with the first. The nineteenth century writers, in reference to Siberian shamanism in general: Saskov, Mixailovskij, later Xaruzin, Cubinov, Nioradze, Ohlmarks, Harva, Zelenin, Schmidt, had healthily simplified the problem because of the geographical delimitation. They did not have to face the problem of the provenience of shamanism on a world- wide scale ; evidently the commonalty of the phenomenon even in such a wide area as Siberia is different from an ambitus that includes all of Eurasia, the New World, etc. Those who have developed the concept of a world-wide sha- manism, as Bogoraz, MacCulloch, Eliade, Findeisen have not revealed the basis on which they have drawn this distribution (Eliade 1968 has ex- cluded Africa) 21. It may be, simply, on the basis of the distribution of a given criterion, as ecstasy, soul-loss and flight, heavenly journey in a state of trance, etc. ; it may be on the basis of an evolutionary sequence, or on the basis of the psychic unity of all mankind with the given content (this appears to be a widespread presupposition, particularly among those who have drawn the relation of shamanism-animism). We have already considered how fragile the basis will be if we take up the criterion of trance or ecstasy alone in relation to shamanism. Finally, abstraction has been made of the concept of shaman- ism by those who think of it as a religion; it is a double abstraction. First, it is an abstraction from the ethnographic context in which it is found; secDnd, it is an abstraction that purports to bring together and to generalize the materials on a world scale. But it is not always a scientific procedure; it is often an imposition upon the materials of a form that has been preconceived. 20 The Chukchis treat alien shamans with as much veneration as their own. ¿L mis, iar îrom simpinying tne proDiem, complicates it iurtner, ior now sna- manism is not taken by Eliade to be a human universal. It has undergone an enormous migration, but skips a continent according to him. How has. this come to be ? The metho- dology for this conclusion is given as historical, but that is not an explanation, it is merely the statement of a problem.</page><page sequence="24">128 Lawrence Krader Anthropos 70. 1975 Thus, Schmidt and Eliade were opposed to each other over the question of whether the white shamanism (Eliade 1951 : ch, 1) or the black shamanism (Schmidt 1952: 696-704) is the true or the classical form (Schröder 1955). The problems of the two are different. Schmidt had intended to reconstruct the historically original form of shamanism among the Inner Asian (Altaic- speaking) pastoralists ; Eliade, although his intention was to contribute to the world history of religion has adopted a formal definition to which the phenomena described are submitted, without reference to their historical chro- nology. He then adopts the criterion of the heavenly ascension (or descent into hell) of the shaman's soul, the shaman being in a state of ecstasy, as the crucial test of the phenomenon in the archaic state. At this point history is no longer relevant. The conception of an archaic conception of ecstasy implies not a historical but a systemic perspective, presupposing that the course of development of the shamanist conception is known. But the relation of the Chukchi, Koryak, or Eskimo shamanism to the shamanism among more south- erly peoples is speculative, even granted the appearance of the boa constrictor motif, etc. The relation of Nivkh-Gilyak and Ainu shamanism is likewise obscure; that of the Miao, Lolo, Tibetan and the archaic Chinese has con- nections to the others, as far as is known, that are but sketchy and wholly external. Findeisen (1957: 198-199) 22 has placed shamanism in developmental conjunction with the magic, in fact the magician, of the Upper Palaeolithic, 15 000 years ago ; when or how the one became the other has not yet been elucidated. The thesis of archaism advances at once too much and too little; it remains a speculation, of considerable interest, to be sure, both Eliade's and Findeisen's presentations being instructive in a high degree. Schmidt's schema is purely schematic, a brilliant piling on of hypotheses. The black shamanism of the Buryats, in the form known to us, is related to specific cultural-historical and social conditions, behind these, concrete economic and political conditions; their black shamanism cannot be discussed apart from these, and remains unrelated to any hypothetical "original" or "classical" form of shamanism. On the other hand there is an indication that black sha- manism is a form of degeneration of a former stage of Buryat shamanism, which came to light after the publication of Schmidt. Thus we can support his thesis in part, but that part is but minor, and is unconnected with any notion of a classical form of shamanism : it is a fortiori opposed to the notion of black shamanism as an original or classical form. It is for a reason uncon- nected with his major thesis that a minor part of it has been corroborated; the major thesis cannot be followed, for it has many presuppositions that have been only superficially spelled out, if they have been made explicit at all. Schröder (1955 : 852) has criticized both Eliade and Schmidt for adopt- ing a purely historical conception, ignoring the structural [and synchronie]; his objection is further, that ecstasy (the basis of both their theories) is found not only in shamanism but in other religions (p. 855). Nevertheless, Schröder 22 This takes the archaistic thesis of Eliade "au pied de la lettre".</page><page sequence="25">The Shamanist Tradition of the Buryats (Siberia) 129 finds the specific characteristic of shamanism as the ecstatic transformation of the shaman's being in the service of the community, opposing the conception of the shaman as magician, or priest (pp. 879-881). The views of Schmidt and Eliade and of Schröder have some basis in fact but they assume alike that there is a basic shamanism. The difficulty with this view is that it has not cleared up the matter of the foundation of the putatively unitary phenomenon of shamanism on a world-scale. Shamanism has been conceived as a stage of the psychic evolution of man, in the manner of Auguste Comte's fetishism and E. B. Tylor's animism 23. Sternberg did not reveal the presuppositions underlying his con- clusion that shamanism is the mystic sexual union of the shaman and "his" spirit, which is asserted likewise by Bogoraz, by Zelenin (despite his differ- ences with Sternberg) and by Arthur Waley in respect of the archaic Chinese shamanism. Is the basis of this thought that the sexual union is a universal feature of mankind, reflected in myth, as the sight of the heavenly bodies in the solar theory of F. Max Müller ? As a subaltern difficulty regard- ing the thesis of the unity of the phenomenon of shamanism, we note that Lévi-Strauss has described a number of shamanistic experiences in the New World. He expected to find the shamanist ecstasy among the Cuna and the Kwakiutl in accordance with his theory, but in fact did not (1949a and b; cf. 1967: 182). In Kroeber's materials problems of an opposite type are raised pertaining to a possible universality of the shamanist phenomena. It does not relate in particular to ecstasy, but to the social utility of the shaman's role as a type of personality (Kroeber 21948: 298-299) 24. 23 Evans-Pritchard (1965 : ch. 2) has criticized the theory of Tylor according to which man first evolved the concept of soul, then that of spirit. The usefulness of the distinction, within the limits set forth above in reference to the Buryats should not be clouded bv the doubt cast uoon the evolutionarv argument. 24 The Lassik Indians had a kind of leader whom Kroeber identified as a shaman ; he communicates with spirits (shadows, or souls), effecting cures of mental illness in himself and others. One woman of the Lassik tribe lost her baby, fell it, and arranged with a shaman doctor to cure her. She was told that it was her own child coming back to urge her to accept him as a spirit helper, aiding her to become a shaman herself. The cure consisted either of becoming a shaman or of getting rid of the memory of the child. Kroeber added: "In these societies there is a complete social and cultural acceptance of spirits and their ability to talk and aid; acceptance also of the power of the shaman who is so aided, and of the place of the shaman in the community. But in our culture a person who falls sick, hears voices, communicates with spirits, and acquires special abilities from them is classified as deranged." We have formulated this (see above) in terms of a theory, held by the traditional Buryats, of a different calculus of personality types from that of Occidental precepts of mental illness and its cure or cures. Kroeber has pointed to the aberrancy and specialization of the California sha- man. He has also pointed out the shaman's control of the First Salmon Rite in Northern California at the beginning of each year's salmon run; it is comparable to the greater shamanism of the Buryats, connected with the ritual of the large social groups. In our end-results, namely, the differences between the calculus of personality types of the Lassiks and that of western civilization on the one hand, and between the Buryats and western civilization on the other, our materials and conceptions accord very Anthropos 70. 1975 9</page><page sequence="26">130 Lawrence Krader Anthropos 70. 1975 The theory of a universal schema of religion, thought, philosophy, science in connection with shamanism has been taken up by many. Thus, the priest is sometimes counterposed to the shaman, the former being more formally and publicly consecrated, the latter informally and privately 25. Lowie brought out the private religious experience of the shaman in this connection, and in a modified way, Radin and Benedict (see below). This approach, when taken alone, is inapplicable to the Buryats, the Tungus, and the Chukchis; yet the phenomenon of shamanism among these peoples is far too important, in any world survey, to be ignored. Bogoraz, for his part, placed shamanism on a ladder of evolutionary development of speculative and cosmological thought, but the schema lacks precision, and is far too much concerned with the Chukchi particularities to permit generalization. (D. Zelenin had already criticized Bogoraz on this score.) Shirokogorov had a more sophisticated view of sha- well with those of Kroeber's. Likewise Kroeber's data on the social organization of shamanism among the Indians of northern California, particularly in regard to the greater and lesser shamanism and respective social roles and functions, appear of concur with our own regarding the Buryats. Nevertheless, there is an important difference in theory : Kroeber apparently concluded that the Lassik and other California shamans, despite the fact that they fell ill of (a psychosomatic) disease, heard voices, etc., were not deranged in the view of the Lassiks. If there is no further evidence than that which he put before us, then perhaps he did not fully make out his case. See his "Handbook of the Indians of California" (Kroeber 1925). We consider that the Buryat shaman also heard voices, etc., and was for this and other reasons regarded as mentally unbalanced or unstable or ill by the Buryats; he would also have been so regarded by professional and lay opinion in the west. The difference between Buryat and western cultures lay not in the evaluation of the mental health or disease of the individual, but in those consequences in social behavior that they drew from the evaluation. In the western case such a person tends to be ruled out of all socially useful tasks; this is the opposite of what Buryats by tra- dition had done (see also Wallace 1961 : 192). Hsu (1971 : 23f.) has recently argued for greater cultural relativity of the concept of personality. We are arguing here for the greater generality or even universality of the evaluations of the aberrancies of personality and, at the same time, the cultural relativity of what frames of action, in regard to the different types of personality, are acceptable within or admissable to the society. This is at once on the side of Hsu's argu- ment: greater loosening of the terms of applicability of the concepts; but also against him: greater generality of the terms of reference of the basic concepts. Like Hsu we arrive at a variability greater than that which is ordinarily applied in culture-personality theory today, but by a different path, namely through interaction between the core concept and the variable social matrix. 25 Anisimov (1952: 201) has written that "... the securing of a special, privileged, social position for the shaman was, in historical perspective, the first step on the path to formation of a priesthood". Findeisen (1957) has considered the shaman to be a kind of priest possessed (Besessenheitspriester). Schröder (1955: 880) has opposed any connection of shaman and priesthood or magicianpriest. Petri (1923) considered that the Buryat shamans underwent a course of training quite comparable to that of priests ; this should meet Schroder's objection; the Manchus traditionally had a like preparation for their shamans. These cases refer to highly developed forms of shamanism, no different from the religions of high cultures generally. They are marginal to the shamanism that we are dealing with. The traditional Buryat evidence tends to support Schröder rather than Findeisen.</page><page sequence="27">The Shamanist Tradition of the Buryats (Siberia) 131 manism than the foregoing, having sought to place the Tungusic psychomental complex on a graduated scale of development, a primitive science, philosophy, etc. His contribution failed to relate the schema concretely to social, economic, technological, etc., conditions, therefore it remains a pure idealism, an abstrac- tion. But, within its own frame of empirical facts, it remains a model of expo- sition of the Tungusic conception of the world, just as the exposition by Bogo- RAZ remains a statement of unparalleled importance with regard to the Chukchis ; both are ethnographies of the first rank, regardless of the theoretical burden that was placed upon them. Bicurin, D'Ohsson, Bretschneider, Yule, Cordier, Rockhill, Ho- worth, Vladimircov, Paul Pelliot, and Roux collected reports from Chinese, Persian, Turkic, Mongol, and European sources pertaining to ancient and medie- val shamanism 26. All these writers have detected evidence of the great sha- manism in the service of the State, etc., agreeing that the shaman in former days acted in a state of frenzy or ecstasy, but they say nothing of the state of mind of the audience or the relation of the participants in the ritual. The data collected by de Groot, Waley, and Eberhard on shamanism of ancient China 27 likewise want any reference to the latter relation, whereas it is a marked feature in the shamanism of the Chukchis, Tungusic peoples, and Buryats. The medieval reports bear out, at least in part, the idea of Xanga- lov, that once the shaman had a higher social position than that which he enjoyed in Xangalov's day; here may lie the kernel of historical data which Xangalov detected in a vague, distorted form in a later millennium. The Altaic societies whose practices were recorded were of course related to, but different from the Buryat, and this difference must be borne in mind, raising a problem of comparison among the Altaic-speaking peoples. Thus, Valixa- nov, the Kazakh contemporary of Banzarov, conceived the shamanism of his people in a closely related way to that of Banzarov: it is a religion, the precedent underlayer that still survives amidst the superimposed Muslim faith of the Kazakhs; it is the worship of natural forces personified in the spirit of the shaman: "He worshipped both the spirit as the living shaman and the dead spirit (ongon)" (Valixanov 1958: 144-148). These ongons, Kazakh arvax, are the spirits of the dead shamans (pp. 148-153), a theory of euhemerism that animates the conceptions of Xangalov, 2amcarano and SanZeev regarding the great ongons of the Buryats as well. Valixanov also perceived that shamanism of the Kazakhs was in a state of tension relative to Islam, much as the shamanism of the Mongols and Buryats stood to Lamaism at that time. The shaman is a healer and diviner among the Kazakhs, whose shamanism is fundamentally that of the nomadic sector of the people. The parallel is not exact, on the other hand, for the factors of time depth from 26 Biöurin 1950/1: 353, 11:46,97,202; D'Ohsson 1834; Bretschneider 1910/1: 257; Yule and Cordier 31910; Rubruck 1900: 111, 239-247; Vladimircov 1922; Roux 1958a and b; Howorth 1876-1927; Pelliot et Hambis 1951. 27 de Groot 1892; Eberhard 1968; Waley 1955; Franke 1930; Ssu-MaCh'ien 1961; Needham 1956; Wieger 41965: s.v. wu.</page><page sequence="28">132 Lawrence Krader Amhropos 70. 1975 the day of the conversion of the Kazakhs to Islam and of the eastern Buryats to Lamaism are different; the respective social milieux are different, the distinction between the greater and lesser shamanism, and of the greater and lesser ongon ceremonies being found only among the Buryats. Shirokogorov (1935: 271) had mentioned that the Tungusic shaman is recognized as such by public opinion; Lévi-Strauss (1967: 173) pointed to the participation of the audience in the healing ceremony of the Kwakiutl which Bogoraz had found among the Chukchis, and which we have failed to detect in the medieval accounts of shamanism among the Altaic-speaking peoples, or among those of the ancient Chinese. Yet this interaction is a con- dition without which the shamanism of the Buryats from the seventeenth to the early twentieth centuries cannot be said to exist. The shaman is the battler with the impersonal forces of nature, personified as the spirits, on behalf of the people. The cosmology of the Buryats reflects the difficulties of human adaptation to the environment and the fragile dominance over it that has been achieved within their culture: the diseases, deprivation and early death that they suffered. The shamanist ideology is their means of coming to a rationalized explanation of their physical and mental pain through untimely loss of kinsmen, friends, neighbors. This is the meaning that one can extract from the notion of altruism of the shamanism advanced in part by Eliade (1951: ch. 6) and by Schröder (1955: 871f.). The altruism is half the story, in reference to the Buryats: the shaman is involved in a struggle with his com- munity and with himself at the same time that he struggles on behalf of the community. Thus the shaman's role in the battle with social and natural forces is an ambivalent one. The personal relation and vision in connection with shamanism was brought out by Lowie (1963: 173-178) and Benedict (1938: 648-650), Lowie having introduced explicitly the factor of the subjective emotional experience in the preparation and cult of the shaman of North America and North Asia into his theory (1952 : 14-16, 19-21) 28. The personal and direct relation of the shaman to his cult and calling has been brought by Radin (1957: 55), Stern- berg (1925), Zelenin (1936), Dyrenkova (1930), and Mauss (1968:519). While that factor must not be lost sight of, it is not the entire matter; it must be directly complemented by the relation of the shaman to the community. The relation of the shaman to sorcery and magical control has been brought into the center of the discussion by Lévy-Bruhl (1922: 241), Jensen (1960), Lévi-Strauss (1967), Harva (1938) and Schröder (1955) ; this element was separated from shamanism by the last named and by L. C. Faron (1962: 1151-1164) who has proposed, on the basis of South American materials, that the shaman is the pole of the sacred, the sorcerer as the pole of the profane. The factor of manipulation by means of sorcery or magic is important in the case of Buryat shamanism, there being a polarization of the shaman's 28 Lowie based his theory in part upon his own work among Plains Indians, in part upon accounts of peoples of North Asia by Bogoraz, Jochelson and Sternberg.</page><page sequence="29">The Shamanist Tradition of the Buryats (Siberia) 133 function which comprises the relation: nature / social group. The Buryat sha- man seeks by his rites to manipulate the forces of nature in curing and divi- nation, but if he seeks to extend his manipulations to the internal affairs of the small social group, he is hated and feared. Both the outside world of nature and the inner world of the village and family are parts of the sacred (as well as of the profane) world of the Buryats; the shaman's relation to the sacred, however, has a plus and minus valence. (There are also aspects of the sacred which fall outside his competence.) Thus the polarity of the sacred and profane among the Buryats is other than that which Durkheim posited in his work, Les formes élémentaires de la vie religieuse 29 and other than that which Faron posited in relation to the Mapuche. The rituals of the social groups over which the Buryat shamans presided were wholly formal and external to the social relations of the groups in question; they are relics of an earlier time, prior to the widespread practice of pastoralism. Durkheim had projected the polarity of the sacred and profane onto a screen of synchro- nie time, without taking into account the period of historic development of the society in question. From another point of view, his conception of the polarization is timeless, being extrapolated from time. The role of the Buryat shaman changed from one period to the next ; those that bore upon an earlier period and were carried into the later were deprived of substance in the views of the Buryats, as we have seen in the evidence of Xangalov. It is when the latterday shamans acted against the popular views that they came to be regarded as dangerous in themselves. Their dangerous content in this con- nection was separate from the dangerous forces of nature; - the latter were dangerous per se because they were more or less uncontrolled and unknown, and it was the shaman's task by his little knowledge and his great play upon group psychology that was intended to bring them under his power. The nine- teenth century ethnographers, writing when the Buryat system was still active, stressed the shaman's command of the nature lore. In this regard, the views of Banzarov, Xangalov (as well as Valixanov) are particularly in point. They are further borne out by Zamcarano writing in the early twentieth century. In order to understand this point, it is necessary to submit the views of the acculturated Buryats to a critique; in particular, those of Xangalov, the most copious and explicit writer on the subject. The recent edition of his works by G. Rumjancev is an invaluable contribution to the study of Buryat shamanism, for it combines all that Xangalov published, both alone and in conjunction with N. Agapitov and D. Klementz, together with a part of his unpublished work. The problem of critique may be resolved into four questions: 1. elements which were particularly distorted by the work of Agapitov; 2. elements which were distorted by Xangalov's Europeanization, viz., Rus- sification, in general; 3. elements of his ideology, that is, his romantic and glorifying attitude toward the Buryat past; 4. errors of fact. Sanzeev has 29 Durkheim's work relates primarily to the Australian tribes.</page><page sequence="30">134 Lawrence Krader Anthropos 70. 1975 expressed himself pointedly on the first matter in 1928. Rumjancev has expressed himself on the fourth point in his Foreword to the Collected Works, and passim in the notes appended to volumes 2 and 3. We must advert to the second and third points, for they are not external to Xangalov's character as an observer and writer. Here we cannot, as a general rule, delineate par- ticularities, but retain a general awareness of Xangalov's tendency. He loved his people, their institutions, and in particular, those of the past. He loved his ancestors, above all his shaman ancestor, whom he memorialized with zeal. But Xangalov's zeal was in no way excessive, for we can detect the elements which formed his shaman ancestor, Barlak, his character and his doctrine, as for instance his disputation with the white shaman Malanak. We can perhaps understand why Barlak held the view that the heavenly beings lived in a state of eternal bliss, and why Barlak entered into marital union with female spirits; his wife on earth was a drunkard, and prone to violent acts when drunk. We cannot say that Xangalov overpraised his shaman ancestor; we can say that he took the man's side: we know nothing of the motivations of Barlak's wife Bere. But this is a fact of a Buryat man's life, just as the veneration of a shaman ancestor was a fact of Buryat life. Far from being a distortion of the facts, it tells us something that we ought to know, without which Xangalov would have been nothing, and his report a nullity. He could only think as a Buryat, with Russian influence; we are for- tunate that he was a precise, literate, and expressive person, so that we are able to mark out the Buryat trends of thought and the Russian trends. These were not in conflict, nor did they change his character as the ethnographer of Buryat life; thus the report of Barlak's struggle with the black shaman over the repayment of a loan tells us something of Barlak's probity and cour- age. On another level, it tells us of Xangalov's attitude toward Barlak, and the ideals of social character that they shared. On the most basic level, the report tells us of social and economic relations of the Buryats at the beginning of the eighteenth century: they had a money economy, they lent money at interest, a shaman (black) engaged in this practice, and another shaman (white) acted as arbiter in a dispute over the matter. We learn on yet another level how these old traditions provided the descendants with moral standards, make the precepts explicit by the tales which exemplified the uprightness and courage of the ancestors. Thus, the shaman Barlak was a hero not because of his relations to nature or its fantastic representation in the spirit world, but because of his relations to men, thereby serving as a moral preceptor in the society, to his descendants. The black shaman for his part sought to intervene in these relations by manipulating them to his advantage; that is, by manipulating them in one word. He was hated because he was a black shaman; he was hated as a man who manipulated social relations, a conniver ; he was a conni ver in his capacity as a conniver. The tale is cautionary: he lost his younger son at the end. The Buryat taught their children by means of these tales the right and the wrong. This tale transposes the relation of society to the shaman, of the shaman to society and to other shamans from the sacred to the profane realms. The black</page><page sequence="31">The Shamanist Tradition of the Buryats (Siberia) 135 shaman was condemned by his society to a bitter fate because he sought to manipulate the relations between men as though these were relations between things. The judgment of Buryat tradition, that is, the society, was decisive; for this is a folktale, the burden of which conveys to us how black shamans, who are properly so-called, were judged in flagrante. These men could act no otherwise because they were black shamans ; it was their black shaman nature that caused them to act as they did, just as Xangalov, in recounting the tale gave it the moral and social burden that he did: he could do no other, being a Buryat, being seized of the Buryat historical-cultural standards, moral virtues, and social viewpoint. It was his character to be such. In these matters, the European slipped away and the Buryat stood forth. But one must know what to look for, since at times he thoroughly objectified his relations to Buryat culture, and stood apart from it (Xangalov 1958: 158). The shaman Barlak marks the end of an era. The shaman and shaman- ism thereafter fell into a lower status. The dating of this transition is not precise; from other genealogies we infer that the decline in the status and standards of the shaman in society began earlier, but the matter that we are dealing with, the tradition of the shaman as a moral hero, is not capable of further precision. Xangalov has communicated to us on many levels by his tale (at least six have been enumerated here). The Buryat shaman was indeed a sorcerer, but the factors of historical periodization and the organization of Buryat social institutions must be borne in mind in deciding this question; moreover, the relation of Buryat society to its past must be introduced. The shaman was a socially recognized sorcerer in the matter of considerable substance : healing in the small group rites ; and in matters of form in the large-group rites. In the past, when he was both the lay and religious leader, the distinction between form and substance in the large-group rites was nonexistent; hence, in those earlier times, the dis- tinction between form and substance at any level of the social institutions was not to be found; on the other hand, the Buryats in the earlier time and during our ethnographic present had a hierarchy of social institutions, the small group and the large 30. The shaman performed, in the later period, a forbidden art if he transposed the relation from the past to the present, and from one level of social institutions to another, from the large-scale to the small, and conversely. The white shaman acted, in the later period, solely in a ritualistic and formal way, emptied of content in relation to tribal and clan ceremonials in their cyclical, seasonal rites. These acts, as social relations, emphasized the formal side of the contact between the shaman and (the larger) social group; the black shaman had nothing to do with this side of the cult. 30 The evidence for this series of propositions lies in the traditions reported by Xangalov, ¿amcarano, Sanzeev, and supported by others whom we have not cited: Erdeni Vambocyrenov, F. A. Kudriavcev, A. Okladnikov, N. Poppe, M. N. Bog- danov, A. Ulanov, I. Manzigeev, S. Baldaev, G. Rumjancev, the evidence lies, fur- ther, in the analysis of the Buryat uligers, which we have only touched on.</page><page sequence="32">136 Lawrence Krader Amhropos 70. 1975 On the contrary, the latter was operative in the small group context, and not in the formal ritual, but in close relation to the substance of human life : the tensions between individuals coming into daily contact with each other in small villages and families. The manipulations of the shaman in regard to the external nature were regarded by the Buryats as benevolent, in reference to the earlier traditions handed down; those manipulations directed toward the inner constitution of the small social group were the opposite ; although excep- tions are reported, this is generally true; further, which is more important, this became increasingly the case in the course of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The black shamanism fulfilled the more substantive and less formal role in the small, the white shaman acted in the opposite direction. Thus, the polarity is not that of sorcery sacred and profane: this is a mere abstraction. The polarity is the manipulation, held to be sorcery, directed outward, toward the control of nature, and the manipulation, held to be sorcery, directed inward, toward personal relations between close kinsmen and neighbors. The latter, when degenerating into hatreds and fears became the substance of the black shaman's art, or witchcraft. In order to make this point clearer, we will cite an example of recent shamanistic practice in the part of Mongolia neighboring the Buryat country. Rintchen encountered in 1956 a black shaman of Köbsögöl ayimaq, north- west Mongolia, whose shamanism, as Rintchen states, has nothing to do with Buddhism. The center of his cult was the spirit of the wife of a Buryat merchant and that of the merchant himself, both of whom had fallen victim to Mongol bandits at the end of the 19th century. The woman had been a shaman whose spirit then began to torment the camps of the kin and neigh- bors of the bandits. Rintchen's informant told how a black shaman divined through his own master-spirit, Gesser (a hero in Mongol and Tibetan folk religion) that the two dead Buryats were to be converted into genii loci. That black shaman, whose spirit was Gesser, consecrated a man, in fact Rintchen's informant, among the kinfolk of the brigands, as a shaman, and the new shaman-designate became the disciple of the familiar of Gesser. The informant of Rintchen was born ca. 1926; the master of this younger black shaman had probably performed the rites of the cult of the murdered Buryats during the period from their death up to the succession by his disciple. The latter did not take over the cult voluntarily; he was so designated by his social group and his master. Thus, if it is a calling, then it is an involuntary one (Rintchen 1958:51). The problem is a wholly human one, the murder of strangers, the feelings of horror and inner torment by the kinsmen of the murderers, and the expia- tion by means of the new cult. The prohibition of shamanism in Mongolia could not overcome the devotion to the cult by the young black shaman, who had been jailed three times for this reason. Further, the manipulation feared by the Buryats was not that of mani- pulation for an evil purpose alone, but the disturbance of the social system, and of the order of nature and culture. This fear was the projection outward of the human uncertainties and social tensions within the group upon the</page><page sequence="33">The Shamanist Tradition of the Buryats (Siberia) 137 screen of their relations to nature, their relations within society, and within the grand polity, to the world outside the Central Asian forest-steppe. Such social understanding - it should be understood that social criticism does not come into the matter - as the Buryats developed was deflected into these pathetic figures that we have seen through the ongon cult, hence it did not achieve a high level. Those outstanding figures of the past depicted by Xan- galov belonged to another era and another kind of shamanism. The shamanist axis was therefore not within the polarity of the sacred and the profane: Durkheim's frame of reference does not, to this extent, bear upon our problem of shamanism. It is rather a series of arrested moments of the history of the society, in which the small social group is separated from the larger society of its own, and hence the past from the present. It is at the same time the problem of anachronism. The shaman who sought to impose the mode of treating the concerns of the past upon the present mode, and that of the large social group of the past upon the small group of the ethno- graphic present, was condemned as the black shaman. Likewise, and this is the problem raised by Rintchen, the black shaman transposed the great cult of the past, as the cult of the hero Gesser, onto the cult of small group guilt and horror. The ambiguity of the Buryats and the Mongols toward the sha- man's calling, and of the Buryat shamans in regard to themselves is thus a relation of their present ambiguity upon their past. Anisimov (1952: 230) passed a judgment, based upon his Tungusic mater- ials, regarding past ethnographers : "Narodnik ethnography (Sternberg, Bogoraz, i. a.)... following this social illusion was inclined to the proposition that the 'gift' was not a privilege but was essentially a misfortune for the shaman." If we can assume, and I am convinced that the matter is not so simple, that the Tungusic materials are relevant if not decisive for the Buryats, then a dialectical approach to the problem is called for: neither privilege nor mis- fortune, but a relation between the two. In any case, not a privilege but a relation of social recognition, need and fear. The polarity of plus and minus reactions to the shaman is real, but only in interaction of each upon the other in the society, and in the matrix already indicated: of the present upon the past and the past upon the present. The dialectical moments, moreover, relate the particular shamanism to the generality of shamanism; the generality is usually the imposition of one schema upon all the others. All those mentioned moved in the opposite direction: Bogoraz and Sternberg on the one side, Anisimov on the other, did not begin from the concrete particularity of the schema of Chukchi, Nivkh or Evenk shamanism, but from an abstraction. The next step is to turn these abstract relations on their feet. In fact, Ani- simov, Bogoraz and Sternberg elsewhere are quite concrete, and we owe them much for their labors (cf. Vasileviõ 1969: 250f.). The question of the universality of shamanism or of the shaman as a widespread figure in the distribution of religious types, cults, relations, must be posed on many levels. We have already mentioned the relation to univer- sality of the subject and the object, whether it is the universal in the eye of the shamanist or in the eye of the observer. From the viewpoint of the devout,</page><page sequence="34">138 Lawrence Krader Anthropos 70. 1975 the matter of shamanism never goes beyond his own people and the immedi- ately surrounding peoples of his acquaintance; at the same time, it is never a matter of religion alone, nor is it all that there is of the cultic practices of the Buryats or other peoples in question; there is no ground here for the universalization of the phenomenon. Moreover, we observe from the strictly ethnographic viewpoint that the form and content of shamanism is radically different from one period of the history of a people to the next, and from one subgroup of the society to another. The Buryat relations to the sacred, within the scope of their forms of shamanism alone, extend into every variation conceivable, from the friendly to the inimical, and from the sacred as fearful and malevolent to the sacred as hopeful and benevolent. Their shamanism is a cosmogony on the scale of the heavens and the medical plants of earth; it is a moral order and a psychological calculus. These are closely interwoven matters that are difficult to identify among all the distant peoples to whom shamanism is attributed; 1 do not even speak of the material paraphernalia, for they will be found to have a different distribution. Yet many are convinced of the wide spread of shamanism, or even of its universality as a coloration or aspect of all religions. These conceptions are necessarily an abstraction and simplification, at best a working with for- mulae: The shaman is the charismatic leader of the community; or he is the religious leader of the hunting culture; or the cult of shamanism is the flight of the soul. Findeisen has written in the line of Bogoraz, Jochelson, and Sternberg in which the shaman is a spiritistic medium found in western culture, northern Siberia and elsewhere. These accounts do not explain how these phenomena recur here and there, but if we are to deal totally with the concrete phenomenon of shamanism we must determine what there is within it, or about it, or connected with it, that is recurrent in this way. Thus, D. Aberle has conducted a study of shamanism as the wild, uncontrolled, type of religious experience connected with temporary loss of soul in Southeast Asia; he is likewise conversant with the cultures of Inner Asia, so that he has a factual basis on which he has written. But the common theoretical frame for world shamanism has been put forward by none, unless we revert to the animist and vaguely evolutionary perspective of Tylor, Bogoraz, i. a., which, however, is not an explanation; it is rather the designation of an area which an explanation will be sought, and a name which may be attached to it when it is found. The psychological explanations likewise have not accounted for the varieties of experiences between peoples and the recurrence of the com- mon phenomena cross-culturally. There is left the recurrence of the base in experience to which the generality of shamanism is a response : here and there in the world, in small social groups, a charismatic leader of the religious cult arises, who by his or her experience of misery, hence, by his character of misery, bespeaks the miseries of "his" people. The poor natives of the colonial period of recent centuries had a double misery: their low level of material culture to begin with, and the rigors of the colonial regimes. Internal flight or fugue, as soul-loss, is one recurrent response to these conditions. Here belong the old Ghost and Earth Lodge cults of North America, the cargo</page><page sequence="35">The Shamanist Tradition of the Buryats (Siberia) 139 cults of Melanesia, etc. The shamanist icons, as the drum and the world-tree, then shrink in importance as attributes of the phenomenon; they are not found in the shamanism that has been identified as such in Southeast Asia and Oceania. We take as the significant characteristic of shamanism the inter- nal flight of the members of a society in their miserable condition; the objec- tification of that misery without even the most elementary critique, that is, without inquiry into the source of the misery ; the externalization of the flight as a group relation on the one hand, and the direct representation of the social unity on the other. (Here we comprise the najgur group and ceremonies wholly within Buryat shamanism.) Shamanism in its cultic aspect serves as the representation both of the miserable condition of the society as a whole and of the small social groups within the society; in regard to the first of these, a direct abstraction of that social unity has already been made by the people themselves, but without generalization as an ecumenical doctrine, and without its objectification as the mediate expression of the unity of the group. Shamanism is therefore the antithesis of the collective representation, which in the case of the Buryats, and not in their case alone, necessarily lies elsewhere. Shamanism, moreover, does not exist in abstraction as the religion of the people, or as its primitive science and philosophy alone. In our introductory remarks we alluded to the shaman as a wild, bad social type the ethnographized Buryats, ca. 1860s-1920s. This must be separated from the judgment by Friedrich Nietzsche who wrote in his "Wille zur Macht" : 'The 'wild' man (or, morally expressed, the bad man) is a return to nature - and is in a certain sense his reconstitution, his salvation from culture..." The concept of the shaman must be saved from Nietzsche's judgment, which is, on top of everything else, incomplete: what sense is "a certain sense?" If the shaman is the wild, the socially incompatible man, he is nevertheless socially needed. Morally, the shaman is both good and bad, socially desired because undesirable. Nietzsche, moreover, has understood the problem of the wild man in a reversed way. It is not the degeneration of human nature by culture that is the cause of the Buryat judgment of the shaman as the wild type. From the viewpoint of anthropology as an empirical science there is no such thing as an uncultured human being. The blind beast is a caricature and the underlying concept is an oxymoron, a contradictio in adjecto. We must not only stand it on its feet, but in its context, on its own ground. He has likewise understood the problem in a distorted way: the sha- man is the wild man, the bad man par excellence. But he is not the result of the degeneration of a pure human nature by culture ; he is the degenerated result in the recent past, which is our ethnographic present, of known social and historical events, the reflex of those very ones to which Nietzsche was subjected. Were the results in both cases the same? Turning from the place of Buryat shamanism among other shamanisms to the place of the Buryat shaman in Buryat society, the problem then becomes one of the Buryat conception of the person and of the shaman as a person. In the period preceding the one which we have been looking into, the shaman had been socially, morally and psychologically whole; if he was not thus in</page><page sequence="36">140 Lawrence Krader Anthropos 70. 1975 fact, he was represented as such in the subsequent Buryat tradition, both as a mythical and as a historical figure : an anchor, a stabilizing force in a troubled time. On the other hand, the shaman had not composed the problem of the person in the ethnographic present, he had contributed to its decomposition. He combined within himself the disjecta membra of the person, whether of the Lassiks, the Buryats or the Eskimos. The Buryat social consciousness went no further; their shamanism and their shaman went no further than the passive expression of their social turmoil and misery in the lesser shaman- ism, the lesser ongon cult and the najgur ceremony, the opposite of the ancient shamanism and the world- view of the uligers.
