<plain_text><page sequence="1">FARM FUNDAMENTALISM-ITS FUTURE DoN F. HADWIGER Iowa State University Introduction ACCORDING to a tried-and-true formula for preparing a scholarly paper, one first quotes a respected authority, thereby establishing the significance of his subject. Then one disagrees with the quoted au- thority, to show that the last word on this significant subject is to be found in the paper. This strategy is to be questioned only if-as in the present situation- the quoted authority happens to be a fellow panelist. Nevertheless, it would seem appropriate to quote Professor Karl Brandt at the outset, because his emphasis on the political role of farm funda- mentalism served as a stimulus to the organization of this panel. In a paper presented at the annual meeting of the Western Farm Economics Association and later printed in the Journal of Farm Economics, Professor Brandt said in part: ... I do not believe that the assumed power of the farm bloc is what has kept legislation in the same tracks for twenty-seven years. I believe the causes lie much deeper, namely, in what has so aptly been analyzed by J. S. Davis as agricultural fundamentalism. I would add to it that as an indestruc- tible strand of a society's tireless memory all urban people have a fond affection for the farm, from which they or their forebears came. It is the Paradise Lost Complex of modern electorates that creates the phenomenon of increasing will to grant farm aid as the proportion of farm votes dimin- ishes, a phenomenon typical of all industrial societies under representa- tive forms of government.1 This thesis is somewhat unique. Most studies of American thought and attitudes make scant reference to agricultural fundamentalism except as the expressed creed of the Jeffersonians. However, a few intuitive analy- ses have linked fundamentalism and subsidies, one of which agrees fur- ther that fundamentalist attitudes are in crescendo during a period of industrialization.2 1 "Guidelines for a Constructive Revision of Policy in the Coming Decade," J. Farm Econ. (February 1961), p. 10. 2 Max Lerner, America as a Civilization (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1957), p. 139. Reference to fundamentalism as an inducement to farm aid is also made by Richard Hofstadter in his Age of Reform (New York: Vintage, 1960), on page 8, by Bradford Smith in Why We Behave Like Americans (New York: Lippincott, 1957), p. 209, and by Gordon E. Baker, Rural versus Urban Political Power (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1955), p. 1. 1218</page><page sequence="2">FARM FUNDAMENTALISM-ITS FUTURE Another view Professor Brandt has said that Americans have a fondness for the farm. On the other hand, Walter Prescott Webb felt that most Americans have no illusions about farm life, nor any affection for it. Because so many of us are fugitives from agriculture, Webb said, our fiction writers could not fill the farming life with joy, zest, and high virtue, as they did the roman- tic Wild West. We no less than the authors Hamlin Garland, Sherwood Anderson, Sinclair Lewis, Edna Ferber, and Willa Cather know the "ugli- ness drudgery, and tragedy" in rural life. Webb would have Hamlin Gar- land say- I cannot hope to deceive you, you farmer boys who have become actors, merchants, railroad men, salesmen, and college professors. You have the basis and the knowledge to judge my work. I must stick to the verities of life, be true in detail, however, unpleasant. You will read my story and be carried back to those intimate things that you have known best and hated most, and having escaped them you will read of them with pleasure. Your sympathy for your own kind will be awakened. If there was, then, a streak of rural sentimentalism in Webb's urban man of the 1930's, its only root was sympathy-for "the mother you left there, or the sweetheart who has now become the old and broken wife of another man." The urbanite viewed the farm not as a paradise, where virtue was lost, but as a purgatory where virtue was attained much too dearly.3 Webb's image of rural life, rather than Brandt's, appears dominant in current media. For the most part, television's historical hero is still the cowboy, writ larger by comparison with the grubby, nerveless farmer who invades some scenes, even though television's contemporary hero is innocuously urbane, whether in the person of a private detective, doctor, South Sea skipper, or cowboy. Perhaps both Brandt's and Webb's romantic images have a place in the cluttered American mind, and both may have some impact on our farm policy. Federal farm policy is the product of a complex of attitudes, be- havior, institutions, and accidents, as Professor Brandt-no fundamentalist himself-certainly recognizes. A Critical Question Professor Brandt's hypothesis deals with the relative importance of these factors, a matter of consequence. If an undemanding urban funda- mentalism increasingly buoys our farm subsidies, then the political guide- lines for farm assistance are quite broad, and its future is not a matter for great concern. I wish to question Professor Brandt's hypothesis-to ask 3 The Great Plains (New York: Grossett and Dunlap, 1931), pp. 453-483. 1219</page><page sequence="3">DON F. HADWIGER how important agricultural fundamentalism is and will be, relative to other influences, in shaping our various government programs for agricul- ture. May it first be suggested that there are two kinds of agricultural funda- mentalism, with distinctive political consequences: economic and social. Economic Fundamentalism Two tenets Economic fundamentalism has been succinctly stated on the seal of the U.S. Department of Agriculture: "Agriculture is the Foundation of Man- ufacture and Commerce." As discussed by Professor J. S. Davis in the article to which Professor Brandt referred,4 it appears to contain two tenets: a. Food and fiber are the basic or essential needs of a civilization. To many Americans, the tremendous costs of procuring and storing agricul- tural surpluses may seem a small enough price for some peace of mind in an atomic as well as a Malthusian age. Besides, these caches of raw prod- ucts are scarce trophies of America's superiority over the Communist world in the things that count. Our surpluses would be less comforting, obviously, were we to recognize that farmers are only one link-and not necessarily the indispensible one-in the chain of food and fiber produc- tion. How wonderfully this unrecognized fact might be illustrated, in some quarters, should our spacemen someday return with a reasonable substitute for Cuban cigars. b. Farmers must be prosperous if the nation is to prosper. As a funda- mentalist proposition, this has long been fallacious, since agriculture is not the single or perhaps even a major catalyst of recession.5 In another sense, however, it has validity. On the assumption that prolonged hardship in any significant segment of our economy can ultimately weaken the whole interdependent structure, we have institutionalized in the federal govern- ment the search for and treatment of problem areas. How do urban people view the farm problem? Do they feel that their own prosperity is connected with that of the farmer? Or do they recog- nize a competition between their own demands on government and those of the farmer? Are they in any case inclined to insist that farm programs be inexpensive and effective? Or do they have any cognizance of the farm problem at all? ' "Agricultural Fundamentalism," originally published in Economics, Sociology, and the Modern World, Norman E. Himes, editor (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Univ. Press, 1935). 'D. Gale Johnson, "Government and Agriculture: Is Agriculture a Special Case?"

Voter studies by the Michigan University Survey Research Center have revealed that perhaps over ninety percent of the people have little or no knowledge of or inter- est in, much less a conceptual framework from which they can act on, a variety of issues. Most voters evaluate politicians and parties on the basis of such criteria as the nature of the times, and the benefits which have been bestowed on the voters' group.6 This coincides with Professor Gabriel Almond's finding that only a thin layer of the population-the "informed public"-is able to articulate and act upon opinions on a range of issues. The remainder-the "mass public" -tends to be inattentive and unconcerned except with regard to those issues which have a direct, readily-felt impact upon them.7 According to this hypothesis, in the event that food prices had risen sharply (as have medical costs), a strong reaction might have been forthcoming from some sectors of the urban population. Other real or assumed grievances are not so apparent to urban citizens. One editorial in Life magazine sought to personalize the tax burden im- posed by the farm problem, using the following verbal shock treatment: If a man came up to you and asked you for a lot of money so he could raise the price of your food and of the shirt on your back, would you hand it over-or sock him?8 The impact of still another grievance-against the farmer as a political tyrant-will be subsequently discussed. To the extent that these penetrate urban consciousness, federal policy-makers will-and doubtless already do -feel urban pressure to reduce farm aid. As indicated below, however, urban reactions to farm problems, based on increased awareness, are not all unfavorable to farm subsidies. Protective impulses Many urban people, especially the more informed and influential, are surely concerned about the surge of rural-urban migrants whose needs strain the city's resources, and who tend to reinforce Webb's image of the farm as a place of hardship. Proceeding deductively, it would seem that rural-urban migration would stimulate both protective and humanitarian impulses. With regard to the ' Angus Campbell et al., The American Voter (New York: John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 1960), pp. 168-265. 7The American People and Foreign Policy (New York: Harcourt, Brace and Com- pany, 1950). 8 (April 20, 1959), p. 39. 1221</page><page sequence="5">DON F. HADWIGER first, there would be a desire to slow rural-urban migration to a pace at which migrants might be absorbed without detrimental effects to the metropolitan economy and social institutions. To this end, urban people could agree with Pope John XXIII, who ad- vocated a host of governmental measures for agriculture throughout the world, on the ground that- If such steps are taken, the following advantages, among others, will ensue: it will be easier to determine the source and the direction of the movement of workers who have been released from the farm labor force by the progres- sive modernization of agriculture. It will be less difficult to give them the professional training they need to fit profitably into other sectors of pro- duction. Finally, they can be given the economic aid, orientation, and spiritual assistance required to integrate them smoothly into a new social environment.9 Economists may well argue that some existing programs are not geared to these goals. Needless to say, few among even the informed public are competent economists; and in any case, alternatives to the price supports program which were directed more to these ends, such as the Brannan Plan, have proven politically unfeasible. Equity and humanitarian liberalism The desire to control the rate and the conditions of rural-urban migra- tion is obviously no more fundamentalist than the desire for equity, which Professor Walter Wilcox has seen as significant, or the desire to help society's underdogs, which Professor Max Lerner has found to be a strong trait in American civilization. Professor Wilcox has stated- Minority groups such as farmers have succeeded in getting favorable legisla- tive action over a period of years in part because of their appeal to equity considerations related to the issues presented. We might add that farmers also lose nonfarm support on issues where they cannot make a strong ap- peal on the basis of equity.10 Lerner asserted that in America "Humanitarian liberalism . . . has held its dominance in the empire of the mind." As an intellectual force it "has developed in its concrete struggles an armory of facts and argument and a passion for battle," among the goals of which have been "aid to farmers at the mercy of a shifting market.""' Such attitudes of mind may have motivated urban liberals to support high fixed price supports, although with increasing reluctance, despite the unwillingness of many rural congressmen to reciprocate on some other "liberal" measures, and perhaps despite a gnawing fear that the price Mater et Magistra (American translation). 0o Social Responsibility in Farm Leadership (New York: Harper, 1956), p. 4.

Farmer political power Although moved by a desire to promote agricultural well-being, on humanitarian grounds or as a means to the health of the whole economy and society, urban legislators have also tended to observe party lines on farm policy, which suggests that the farm problem is still a political issue of consequence. But the context has changed. Profesor Brandt is correct in questioning the power of any "farm bloc" in the Congress. In fact, no farm coalition has existed in recent years, nor does such a combination appear any longer feasible.12 Furthermore, the structure of rural power based on the homogeneous one-party district, and exploiting the seniority rule and other institutional arrangements within the Congress, has begun to dis- appear during the last decade,13 even though agricultural interests in the Congress have continued to shape the contours of existing programs, and have exercised a near veto power in this area. The very factors related to the demise of the farm bloc, however, have permitted agriculture's economic interests to be better expressed at the polls. As indicated in elections over the past decade, the farm vote can be a pivotal element in a number of states because it fluctuates more sharply in response to economic appeals than that of other groups.14 It is true that the farm vote has tended to be a protest vote-against Communist, Vatican, labor union, and financier conspiracies, as well as against low farm prices and controls. But while the parties may be damned if they do, experience shows they will almost certainly be damned if they do not. The demonstrated strength of the farm vote helps explain the continuance and increase in farm program expenditures during the past decade. This voting power might be further used to gain farmer economic ends, if farmers and their political representatives were willing to cooperate with urban counterparts in achieving them. One obstacle to doing so- social fundamentalism-is discussed below. Social Fundamentalism Two views Jose Ortega y Gassett commented as follows on the differences between the country and the city: 12 John P. Heinz, "The Political Impasse in Farm Support Legislation," Yale Law Journal (April 1962), pp. 952-978. 13 Don F. Hadwiger, "Political Aspects of Changes in the Farm Labor Force," Labor Mobility and Population in Agriculture (Ames: Iowa State Univ. Press, 1961), pp. 62-67. "Ibid., pp. 68-71. 1223</page><page sequence="7">DON F. HADWIGER The man of the fields is still a sort of vegetable. His existence, all that he feels, thinks, wishes for, preserves the listless drowsiness in which the plant lives. The great civilizations of Asia and Africa were, from this point of view, huge anthropomorphic vegetations. But the Graeco-Roman decides to separate himself from the fields ... by means of walls. . . . This lesser, rebellious field, which secedes from the limitless one, and keeps to itself, is a space sui generis, of the most novel kind, in which man frees himself from the community of the plant and animal, leaves them outside, and creates an enclosure apart which is purely human, a civil space. Hence Socrates . . . can say: "I have nothing to do with the trees of the field, I have only to do with the man of the city."15 Social fundamentalism, on the other hand, rejects the inference derived by contrasting the rational city and the vegetable country. Social funda- mentalism instead emphasizes the "good life" of the man of the farm, and the farmer's contribution to society. The agriculturalist, being in harmo- nious contact with the soil and with nature, is assumed to be more indus- trious but less greedy, unsophisticated and thus straightforward and hon- est. Rooted and self-sufficient, with a close-knit, happy family, the farmer is relatively invulnerable to the appeals of radicalism, revolution, "for- eign" ideologies, and violence. Social fundamentalism, carried to its logi- cal conclusion, assumes that the farming life, as contrasted with that of the hunter, nomad, and urbanite, is the ideal human condition. In the best-ordered society, according to the fundamentalist, the farmer's influ- ence would be dominant. The era of social fundamentalism Social fundamentalism was significant in pre-20th century agricultural countries as a rationale for opposing both industrialism and the cultural imperialism of foreign metropolises. Notable among the agricultural fundamentalist movements were the Jeffersonians in the United States16 and some of the Russian Slavophiles.'7 Both groups contrasted the virtues of the husbandman with the vices of a decadent Europe. The Jeffersonian farmer was to be the foundation stone for a Republic of free men, while the Slavic peasant was to be the bulwark of religious orthodoxy and czarist autocracy. But the farmer proved to be no match for the forces of industrialism and urbanism, whether these appeared in the guise of 19th Century "Revolt of the Masses (New York: W. W. Norton, 1932), pp. 164-165. Ortega y Gassett's analogy was surely not inspired by a comparison of the mechanized farmer and the horticulturalist suburbanite! 16 Daniel Boorstein, The Lost World of Thomas Jefferson (Boston: Beacon Press, 1948). 17 Tolstoy, for example.

In this century, agricultural fundamentalism has had virtually no appeal in weak and underdeveloped nations. Leaders in these areas are gambling on rapid industrialization (somehow to be imported fairly free of political, economic, and cultural trappings) as the best security against imperialism-now viewed as basically economic rather than cultural. Al- though industrialism is valued as a means to achieve national autonomy, it is also viewed as a good in itself: the leadership in these still-agricul- tural countries have rejected fundamentalist tenets in principle. Fundamentalism in an industrial society It must be clear that, as a program for industrial countries, true agri- cultural fundamentalism would amount to thoroughgoing nihilism. But most current "fundamentalist" positions apparently do not seek a return to the agrarian society. Instead they stress the contribution made by the existing, small farm population. Some fundamentalists, it is true, would seek to prevent any further decrease in the number of farmers, although others apparently look toward removal of all marginal farmers, thus un- encumbering the efficient commercial farmer whom they consider to be the chief depository of rural virtue. Fallacies of contemporary fundamentalism It may still be worth summarizing the fallacies in a fundamentalism which is centered on the social role of the existing farm population, or a portion thereof.18 a. Chief among these is the assumption that today's farmer is still dif- ferent, that he has been spared from the pressures toward bureaucratiza- tion, specialization, conformity, atomization, and the other presumed characteristics of urban, industrialized society. In fact the farmer is more dependent upon governmental services and regulation than most other economic groups; and because of his highly competitive situation, the commercial farmer may have less freedom in the use of his resources than do most other producers. He can, of course, sacrifice efficiency in the interest of gaining a wider range of choice, but in so doing, he loses any claim to special virtue in the eyes of some fundamentalists. Is the farmer really more secure in a social and psychological sense? 18 The current validity of fundamentalist tenets was explored in Professor A. Whitney Griswold's Farming and Democracy, and by John M. Brewster in "The Relevance of the Jeffersonian Dream Today: A Current Look at Griswold's 'Farming and Democracy'" (paper presented at the Homestead Centennial Symposium, Univer- sity of Nebraska, June 11-14, 1962). 1225</page><page sequence="9">DON F. HADWIGER As the rural community disappears, can he find his way into new com- munities, and are these any different from those of Maurice Stein's sick suburbia?19 Is his family still close-knit, despite the "working wife," and his childrens' separate interests that not only keep them in town a good deal but even argue for an urban family residence? Is he more stoic than others have been when faced with the possibility that, as a farmer, he is an economic has-been? It is doubtful that today's farmer feels less threatened by existing social and economic forces than does the urban citizen. b. A second fallacious assumption in a social fundamentalism based on the role of existing farmers is that American farmers perform a vital role in the preservation of a free, democratic society. Even granting the condition that a farmer minority could make its will prevail within our political system, there is little evidence that farmers are a force for, or the "backbone" of, a free democratic society. A much stronger case could be made for the opposite contention. Voting and attitude studies by the Michigan University Survey Research Center, by Samuel Stouffer, and by others, indicate that farmers as compared with other groups are poorly- informed, unskilled in and often uninterested in political participation, less capable of independent judgment, and yet often unwilling or unable to understand the views of others.20 Rather than having served as a stabilizer of democratic society, the record of rural people is one of ineffective resistance to totalitarian com- munism, and vulnerability to fascist appeals. Although fascism is some- times held to be a consequence of urban rootlessness, one observer of the election just previous to Hitler's assumption of power stated: "The ideal-typical Nazi voter in 1932 was a middle-class self-employed Protes- tant who lived either on a farm or in a small community, and who had previously voted for a centrist or regionalist political party strongly op- posed to the power of big business and big labor."'21 The fascist label Some writers have even asserted that the Populist movement of the 1890's spawned the only indigenous American fascism.22 Certain pro- grams and attitudes of the Populists are cited as proof, such as the un- compromising personalities of certain leaders, the reliance on a "devil" 9The Eclipse of Community (Princeton, N.

Even if genetically linked to the Populists, however, these groups appear to be far removed in spirit and program from the movement which enacted mechanisms for popular government, which championed many welfare and regulatory measures that have since become law, which made an honest effort to form a partnership with the urban working man,23 whose grass roots membership tended to be well-informed, and whose view of the economic and political system of the time was sounder in most re- spects than that of less radical opponents.24 Even some of those who find in it the seedbed of American fascism tend to view the Populist era as one of the finer moments in the history of farmer politics, and they would perhaps agree with Grant McConnell's thesis that the agrarian democracy exemplified therein is today not in evidence.25 Whatever the merits of the argument that indigenous fascism was rooted in the Populist era, it would seem that the fascist label more accurately describes the contemporary social fundamentalist than it does the Populists. The Populists were fundamentalists, but of a temper that permitted them to solicit the partnership of all lower-income Americans, and to stress that the main division in American was between "producers and non-producers." And since the Populists operated in a setting in which the majority in this nation were still farmers, the mechanisms championed as a means of increasing farmer power were those which would inaugurate majoritarian democracy. Contrast this with the con- temporary agricultural fundamentalist who, based on an insupportable assertion of rural superiority, seeks political arrangements in which the farmer minority may dominate the rest of the population. The Impact of Social Fundamentalism on Farm Policy As an urban phenomenon No doubt social fundamentalism is still alive in the American mind, although its influence upon political behavior is difficult to measure. The farmer as pioneer, and the farm (or log-cabin) as the birthplace of great men, are a part of our living American tradition. With our ideals of free- 23 Eric Goldman, Rendezvous with Destiny (New York: Vintage, 1960), pp. 36-42. 24 For a sympathetic evaluation of the principles and program of the Populists, see the concluding chapter in John D.

HADWIGER dom and individualism being challenged both from abroad and by our own gigantism, we may well treasure the image of the farm as the out- post of the individual entrepreneur. In addition, a minority of urban Americans have a personal attachment to a particular farm, on which they spent their youth, or at least some of their holidays. These delightful images persist, but are we governed by them? Ameri- cans have a place for sentimentality, so that it rarely, if ever, gets in the way of "progress." Thus, despite our fond memories of the small town and its corner drugstore, there is little demand that government subsidize either institution. And is not the high school FFA-er following a familiar pattern when he pleads the principles of agricultural fundamentalism before going off to prepare for a career as an economist? Sentiments, and the rhetoric which they inspire, are one thling. Decisions are often based on something else. For this reason, a more relevant urban attitude of mind might be dubbed the Elephant's Graveyard Complex. Many Americans may well hope to retire on the proceeds of their family's farm, or to "hole up" on the old home place in the event of depression, loss of health or job, atomic attack, or some other catastrophe. Few want to move to the farm, apparently, except for a handful of wealthy status-seekers who purchase farms near the metropolis in which they work, where they may raise registered or racing animals (the losses and depreciation on which serve as tax write-offs), or operate what amounts to a feed lot or dairy palace, run by hired "cow-sitters."26 The race to the fringe of suburbia is inspired by a desire for peace and com- munion with nature, but definitely not for agriculture-the wooded areas are the first to be settled.27 As a rural phenomenon Fundamentalist attitudes are often voiced by those speaking to or for the farmer, leading to a presumption that fundamentalism is still a part of the belief system of rural society. Yet, farmers often act contrary to fundamentalist tenets. To give some examples: a majority of Iowa farmers would advise their children not to be farmers, according to one survey;28 and rural communities all over America are trying to lure a factory, despite the warnings from their folk- lore. As for young people who decide to farm, it is just possible that they are lured more by the technological and organizational challenges than by the familiar but mossy fundamentalist mythology. 6 Jean Gottman, Megalopolis (New York: Twentieth Century Fund, 1961), p. 231. 7 Ibid., pp. 222, 234. 28 Wallace's Farmer, May 15, 1959, p. 34. 1228</page><page sequence="12">FARM FUNDAMENTALISM-ITS FUTURE Many farmers, in ignoring fundamentalist tenets, may have outrun their institutions. Fundamentalist embroidery has normally lined the pro- grams and purposes of the agencies which serve the farmer, whether rural churches, farm magazines, educational agencies, local governments, farm organizations, or political representatives. Now, embarrassed by a declining clientele, many farmer agencies face a hard decision: should they proceed according to the old presuppositions about the role of agri- culture, on the assumption that fundamentalist attitudes among all seg- ments of the population are adequate to support rotten borough institu- tional structures; or should they throw off the cloak, in which case they must be prepared to retool and bid vigorously for new functions, includ- ing service to the urbanized farm population? One can note the many decisions to take the latter course. A similar set of alternatives can be discerned in the dispute among farm groups over government farm programs. Defenders and opponents of government measures have often taken fundamentalist stands-with equally dubious sincerity, the one asserting in effect that government aid to family farms is for the purpose of assuring national health, the other that government assistance robs rural people of their individualism, thus impairing their ability to set the moral standard for the nation. Needless to say, positions with regard to the role of government in agriculture are subject to a more rational defense, which many farm spokesmen may now consider the more persuasive. One can make an ap- pealing argument for assistance for farm families on grounds such as used by Pope John, or champion greater individualism and local re- sponsibility, without bogging either position down by linking it with an untenable theory of rural superiority. The backlash of urban resentment Fundamentalist positions are increasingly a liability, rather than an asset, in securing support for farm programs. To the extent that rural people and their representatives refuse to acknowledge our metropolitan society or to understand its needs, and especially if their resistance to political adjustments is based on the stated assumption that only rural people are fit to run the country, it will be increasingly difficult to con- tinue to solicit the urban support essential to the maintenance of these programs. If those who feel that the soul is purified through communion with nature continue to veto proposals for national and state parks, for green belts, for planning and financing urban development, and if they even insist on "God's time" at the expense of daylight communion, these social fundamentalists will have to hope that urban citizens possess a forbearance and compassion that fundamentalist doctrine would never 1229</page><page sequence="13">DON F. HADWIGER accord them. If fundamentalists join with reactionaries and parochial urban interests to deny the means and authority for the myriad services which rural migrants need, they should indeed be surprised if urban support is forthcoming for farm-to-market roads; rural school systems; relief from overburdened property taxes; tax concessions for farm trucks, farm gas, and cooperatives; trespass laws; subsidies for land-grant uni- versities; and farm income programs. Whereas the agricultural fundamentalism of urban minds is submerged and of imponderable influence, resentment against the rural funda- mentalist is explicit and moving. A bitter polemic pours forth on such occasions as the defeat of the proposed U. S. Department of Urban Affairs. Father James Vizzard of the National Catholic Rural Life Con- ference noted that "those who are convinced that such a cabinet-level de- partment is urgently needed are placing the blame for the defeat squarely on the shoulders of farm lobbyists and rural minded Congressmen," and he found it significant that this action came a month before Baker v. Carr (March 26, 1962), which challenged the constitutionality of rural- weighted legislatures. He concluded, "it will not be many years before rural domination is ended. When that day dawns, farmers are going to wish that their spokesmen had been more careful not to alienate friends."29 Impact Upon Public Policy To evaluate agricultural fundamentalism solely in terms of its impact upon farm programs, however, is itself a kind of fundamentalism. The chief significance of social fundamentalism is that, by contrasting an idealized image of the farm with the existing metropolitan culture, it discourages efforts to create a satisfactory environment for the majority of Americans. It would fasten an escapist mentality onto the urban resident, while making an obstructionist of the farmer. Fundamentalism tends toward self-fulfilling prophecy. Our complex and artificial urban society must bid for the "good life" by means of rational, purposeful planning, but this cannot be accomplished by minds which liken the metropolis to Kipling's pit of the living dead, into which certain rejected citizens were conveniently dumped. In Kipling's story,30 these unfortunates fought over the few caves which could serve as abodes, lived off the bony crows which were lured into the pit, and existed without hope except for the few who knew the way out through a maze of quicksand. 29 Catholic Rural Life (May 1962). 80 Rudyard Kipling, "The Strange Ride of Morrowbie Jukes," The Sahib Edition of Rudyard Kipling, vol.

To the extent that agricultural programs depend on urban attitudes, a request for sympathy and a willingness to recipro- cate in kind will go much further today than a reliance on fundamentalist attitudes. DISCUSSION: FARM FUNDAMENTALISM-PAST AND FUTURE KARL BRANDT Stanford University The philosophical topic of our session has the rare quality of being as live an issue today as it has been for decades, particularly since there are ever new, up-to-date versions of it. This demonstrates the vitality of agrarian fundamentalism as a social and political accompaniment of the historic process of economic development. We have heard three papers on this subject by representatives of three disciplines of the social sciences. Professor Fite, a historian, had a thoughtful and well documented review of the evolution of agricultural fundamentalism in the latter part of the 18th century and all of the 19th- from Thomas Jefferson to William Jennings Bryan. I subscribe to almost all of this scholarly and objective account. The second paper, by Professor Hadwiger, a political scientist, contains valuable information on political processes and the functioning of repre- sentative government that deserves more consideration by the econo- mists. He credits me with having provided the occasion for his discussion by what I would call occasional poaching on the hunting ground of the political scientist. He certifies that I am not a fundamentalist.
