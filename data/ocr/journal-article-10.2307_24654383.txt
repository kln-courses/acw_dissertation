<plain_text><page sequence="1">The End of Distress: the End of Technology? MICHEL HAAR Université de Paris "Being itself is distress" (die Not).1 At first look, this expression merely illustrates by means of a dramatic image the often reiterated theme of "oblivion to Being." Metaphysics leaves Being in a state of abandonment by reducing it to being as such. It conceives of Being as the most consistent of beings, the most certain, the most worthy to form the basis of all other beings. It calls Being the maximum of reality, from which want, absence, and temporality are excluded; pure rationality without a trace of nothingness. By seeking the positive alone, not counting as true anything but whole, flawless presence, it unknowingly opens the path of nihilism. It counts Being as nothing. But what is meant by "Being itself'? Does Heidegger mean that Being "suffers" from being forgotten, or from the reinforcing of that oblivion? Is he not using anthropomorphic language? What is the connection here between Being and man? Distress in the human sense is a condition of extreme destitution in which, at least momentarily, all recourse is lacking, anguish and despair increase, and the threat of death appears. How can Being itself be threatened in this manner? Are we not necessarily dealing with a transitory distress, a crisis linked to an age in history? How then are Being and historical age or epoch articulated? It may be that the translation of Not by "distress" engages us from the outset in too narrow an interpretation. For Not renders not only the passive meanings of indigence, destitution, distress, but also the active senses of urgency, requirement and constraint. "Being itself is constraint." In what way does Being constrain us? It constrains us to understand and say it, to "bring it to language." We cannot fail to understand Being, even 43</page><page sequence="2">44 Michel Haar The End of Distress: The End of Technology? silently, and every word we say says Being. All philosophy, all ordinary comprehension respond to the constraint, even the necessity to be. This constraint is not exterior to Being; Being itself is pressing and constraining, by its mere incessant coming to birth. And yet if Being "calls" or summons man, it does not subjugate him. The exigency which Heidegger has named the "call" of Being implies at once constraint and distress. It implies constraint in that at all times Being has already shown us a certain face of its truth, in that we can not withdraw from the understanding of Being which dominates each age. There is distress in that the understanding is not a listening. In order to be thought, Being needs man and utilizes him. But ordinarily man does not respond to the call and so leaves Being unthought. Listening is an understanding which demands effort, "piety," collectedness of thought. Simple understanding would be a vague comprehension of the world, which exists de facto and emanates from the atmosphere of an age. Thus the technological understanding of Being is the present order, even if it is not thought in its essence. The call itself (Anspruch) bears in it this doubleness of constraint and distress, for Anspruch means at once claim or constraining hold, and apostrophe, address, the addressed voice (from an-sprechen). On the one hand, Being claims us, commands us to obey; on the other it asks us to listen with sincerity, to be opened in mind and even in heart.2 It is the Not, the distress and constraint of Being, which is translated in the ceaselessly repeated metaphysical question "what is being?". However forgetful this question, its insistent pursuit and return constitute the flow and the breaking of history. Every age, the Greek, the medieval, the modern or technological, discovers as its necessity a fundamental way of saying the Being of being. Thus every age experiences the original constraint of Being at the same time as it brings about its long but always transitory "placing in suspense," épochè. Every age is answer, but also question, in other words, keeps the call, the "sending out" of Being suspended until there comes a new sending out or destiny. "Whatever has destiny advances each time in itself towards a matchless instant, which destines it to another destiny ... "3 That "matchless instant" is the one in which the age veers toward a new necessity. The Suspended Turning Can it be said, however, that our age recognizes yet a destiny of this kind, capable of being superseded by "another destiny"? "The history of Being is ended," "Metaphysics is completed." The great principles of</page><page sequence="3">Research in Phenomenology Volume XIII 45 rationality—identity, non-contradiction, causality, etc.—which formerly were only speculative have passed into the reality of the technological world. A future of unlimited objectification is sought after everywhere, a future of universal calculation which no one has completely charted and which engulfs those who plan along with those who are planned for. Is the man of technology aware that the constraint under which he operates is in essence metaphysical? On the contrary, he recognizes none but the constraints or needs which are objective or calculable, only those problems which he can solve. He knows and wishes himself to be more completely "liberated," "efficacious," and "equipped" than ever before. Why would he care about the ontological principle of technological power? How could he perceive through the colossal deployment of organisation, information, automation, equipment, and cybernetic control the reign of metaphysics? Being is no longer in question. Its meaning is established, definitively, it would seem, in the obviousness and the efficacy of technological rationale. What then becomes of the distress and the constraint of Being? Man, the "civil servant of technology,"4 is hardly concerned with these, whatever other cares or ills he may know. He seeks, and more and more he obtains through universal calculability, what Heidegger calls "extreme security," which goes hand in glove with a formidable increase in both terror and the brutalization of sensibility. This brutalizing of sensibility is characterized in particular by complicity with or indifference towards the destructive consequences of technology, such as the levelling and assimilating of all varieties of life style, the stereotyping of cultural productions, the spurious, calculated character of political ideals, the disfigurement and exhaustion of the earth, and the obliteration of the sacred. Everything which eludes organization, which cannot be diffused by the media, ceases quite simply to be experienced. "It seems almost that, under the reign of will, the Being of pain is closed to man, and likewise the Being of joy."5 Or again, as the Rilke commentary has it, "Death conceals itself in the enigmatic. The secret of pain is still veiled. Love has not been learned."6 The man of technology appears to be outside the realm of pain. Not only does desolation not reach him, but, a few details aside, he is rather satisfied with reality. At the utmost, he briefly experiences the feeling that what some have called "nihilism," others the "world crisis," is the price to be paid for greater efficiency, greater technological "perfection." The absence of distress is the supreme and most hidden distress.. .The absence of distress consists of this: one imagines that one has the real and reality well in hand and that one knows what is the truth....7</page><page sequence="4">46 Michel Haar The End of Distress: The End of Technology? What Heidegger distrusts as "the danger" above all others is that distress might no longer be apparent, that it might remain forever imperceptible. History would then be suspended at the technological age, which would thereby become the ultimate, unique, and unsurpassable truth. The very essence of man as he who assumes a free relation of openness to Being, who "watches over" Being, would find itself then doomed to vanish. "Man" would be immutably imprisoned in his most recent metaphysical figure: that of the "living one who works," the "beast of labor," methodically occupied in devastating the earth. "The danger" concerns not the empirical man, but the essence of man which, if it were forever established on the side of mere calculating thought, would be dead. This is why the threat of a settling into technology of indefinite length represents for Heidegger a prospect much more bleak, a death threat greater than any threat of the physical destruction of humanity by an atomic war. For the overcoming of technology, or even the simple arrival at another relationship with it—one of serenity, forbearance, or detachment—in other words a true "turning in the essence of Being itself'8 (Kehre im Wesen des Seins selber), a mutation marking the whole age, is apparently neither sure, nor even very likely. The completion of technology is not its end, but its "unlimited" perfecting. That there might one day be "another history," "another beginning," remains concealed, remains undecided. The present technological twilight may be able to be changed into "a night before a new morning,"9 but it is just as possible that it foretells an "endless winter."10 At this moment in our age, the danger is closer to us than the hope of a turning point, whence the distress in Being itself. It is doubtless legitimate to speak of a "Heideggerian hopefulness," provided that we situate it beyond any mere optimism or pessimism. This is not optimism, for if ever a new dawn, "a future history more originally destined," is to appear, it will have to do so after the disappearance— whether by progressive extinction or a brutal collapse—of the whole technological order of things. "Before Being can show itself in its initial truth, Being as will must be broken, the world must be turned upside down... "n No optimism here, as the wasting away and destruction of the metaphysico-technical world will most likely stretch out over a length of time apt to disappoint any ordinary expectation. "That wasting away will last longer than the history of metaphysics completed to this point."12 There is, however, no pessimism in this either, for the possibility of a saving power, that is, the possibility of retrieving a free relation to Being is ceaselessly reaffirmed: "there where the danger lies, there grows also what saves."13</page><page sequence="5">Research in Phenomenology Volume XIII 47 Such a saving power cannot be attained without a mutation of Being itself, that is a change of ages. No human initiative or enterprise can produce so prodigious an upheaval as the overcoming of technology. And yet the danger "is" not really present to it, unless thought can recognize, beyond apparent advances or improvements in reality a threat within Being. If the thought of danger is the beginning of being saved, does not the turning depend greatly upon thought? "We look upon danger and in this glance we perceive the growth of that which saves."14 From one point of view, man seems powerless over the destiny of Being. He must not, on pain of being trapped in calculating and technical thought, enter into any activism or, more especially, into any rebellion. No action will ever change the essence of technology. That is why "we must not do anything, only wait."15 But waiting does not signify resignation or submission; on the contrary. For from another point of view, it seems precisely that in order to "turn," to change ages, Being "needs" man, needs his waiting, his "assistance," his "conversion": "the essence of technology cannot be conducted in the metamorphosis of its destiny without the aid of the essence of man. "16 It would seem that Being cannot one day "turn" unless man has first turned toward it. Does not the turning depend largely upon this turning around? If not, what is the meaning of those calls to conversion which Heidegger ceaselessly sends out?... We are not yet thinking... We no longer know how to listen ... We have lost the sense of dwelling, of things, of the earth, of the simple ... Let us learn to think, to listen ... Does he not write, "The saving power must come from there where there is a conversion (a turning around, Wende) of mortals in their essence"?17 What link binding man to Being is implicated here? What good is thought, and what can it accomplish in a time of distress? For Heidegger thought alone acts. "Thought is the true act."18 It would be idealistic, however, to believe that by itself thought can overcome technology. If it announces a metamorphosis, and if that metamorphosis even comes about, if the turning point arrives in "effect" in Being, "this surely does not mean that technology would be put aside."19 How can it be that the turning, although far off, uncertain, or even improbable according to history (even non-objective history), may in some way be already there, and that the saving power reach us "here, now, and in the small things" (in Geringen)20? We are surely at the turning. And at the same time we are short of it. Could there be a splitting of Being? Is our world—and Being itself—not double? "It is a head of Janus,"21 says Heidegger about the age of technology: distress and saving power; earth devastated by technological exploitation and earth</page><page sequence="6">48 Michel Haar The End of Distress: The End of Technology? preserving itself, sheltering the simplicity of things; universal activism and calculating domination, and the serenity of forbearance; twilight and dawn. Metaphysics pushed to its extreme consequences cohabits with the extra-metaphysical. How is such a coexistence of contraries compatible with the unity of Being? Forgetting and the Withdrawal of Being Heidegger always refused to define "Being itself." "Being itself is the enigma."22 "Being is what it is."23 This is not mysticism, as it has been supposed, but it comes from the fact that all definition of Being obliges us to enter into a circle. What Being means we have always and already known obscurely, we must always have understood it already, although not conceptually, in as much as we are. And all definition of Being is impossible or absurd, as Pascal had remarked,24 for it requires the explicit or understood use of the word being defined in its definition; or in Heideggerian terms, it must anticipate the meaning of what is to be defined, or pose as determined by thought the very thing which determines it to think. To define Being is to miss in it the very initiator of the question we ask about it. It is also, by asking what it is, to reduce it to a being. Now Being is neither a particular substance nor an essence of things, neither a foundation of the world, nor God, nor a first principle immanent or transcendent. Being is not situated in a place apart. It "gives itself' {es gibt), comes into presence, everywhere that there are beings mineral, vegetal, animal, manmade or not, or man. Being is the coming into presence of beings, the very manifestation, temporal and indissociable, of these beings. Man alone, of all beings "comprehends" Being. The animal has a natural environment. Man is man by virtue of his openness to Being. If it is impossible to posit Being apart from man, it is equally impossible to posit man in isolation from Being. This isolation of man, his self-positing comes about, however, when under the sway of the metaphysics of subjectivity, man forgets that his relation to Being is determined by Being. Man forgets that he depends for what is proper to him under Being, that Being is not at his disposal, that every capacity proper to him, every "gift," is given to him. Because he wills himself master of being, man refuses to recognize the unmasterable power of Being. He does not accept the fact that all action, all thought is merely response to the demand of Being.</page><page sequence="7">Research in Phenomenology Volume XIII 49 How is such a forgetting—or metaphysics itself—possible? How can Being, if it is the very gift of presence, allow itself to be forgotten? Doubtless principally because of its extreme proximity. Being is not possessed by us; it is what we are. We have difficulty thinking the very thing which feeds our thought, just as we have seeing the light by which we see beings. Thus that which is closest is also the least accessible. But forgetting is a deficiency. And where is one to find the slightest deficiency in the inexhaustible and incessant flow of what enters the field of presence? And yet the coming into presence, the very giving is hidden, conceals itself, and with it that which presents itself, that which gives itself. How does this happen? Being is to be thought as presence, not in the sense of the full actuality (Gegenwart), but that which ceaselessly approaches us (An-wesen), as presentation, uncovering. Uncovering sketches out, in each age, the limits of what is accessible in general. This limit is conceived by metaphysics as the horizon of the transcendental subject, but it encompasses the subject itself, for the horizon "is simply the side oriented towards us of an opening which surrounds us."25 At the same time as it liberates being as a whole, the opening or presence hides the inaccessibility to everything else except to a determined period's totality. It hides no being. It dissimulates a "withdrawal" which is faceless and nameless. To each uncovering or unconcealment there belongs a re-covering, concealment, which is not the ontic dissimulation of something determined. The forgetting of Being does not indicate a neglect or weakness in human memory, but the essence of uncovering. The word "forgetting" (obliviscor, "to efface") is taken in its sense of incontrovertible and massive eclipse of withdrawal. No one can say what it hides. In truth it hides nothing, but this nothing belongs to Being itself as its withdrawal. Forgetting of Being therefore signifies the forgetting of the withdrawal of Being. This forgetting makes possible the metaphysical idea of an extensive totalising of being in experience and knowledge. On the contrary, it is impossible for the thought of withdrawal that "everything" be given, that the "totality" be effectually achievable, in whatever time, whether in the whole succession of times by successive and cumulative revelations, or in a tota simul. In uncovering itself, Being withdraws. "Reconcealment, withdrawal, is a way in which Being 'endures' as Being, in which it dispenses itself, that is, gives itself out."26 In naming withdrawal, that hard nucleus of unrevealed, indescribable night, the Lethe at the core of aletheia, does Heidegger presume to reveal at last the extra-metaphysical name of Being? Not at all; and yet Being is not un-nameable.</page><page sequence="8">50 Michel Haar The End of Distress: The End of Technology? The "Identity" of Being at the End of Metaphysics Whatever the name that metaphysics gives to the Being of beings: idea, substance, subject, object, will to knowledge or to power, it seems that metaphysics is summed up in the project of assigning an exclusive and unique name to Being. The moment it is "identified," Being is lost as Being, reduced to a being, for to name Being is to say what it is, what thing, not just anything but the most perfect and permanent of beings, the universal summit and base. It is also to affirm, "Being is this, and nothing else." The exclusiveness of the name posits Being as excluding nothingness. Metaphysics cannot think Being as the other than being, but only as the most being of beings, the surest, the most positive. The fact that "the most being" regularly doubles to become the commonest and the most perfect (ontology and theology) allows us simply to give to positivity the form of totality, the form of the system. For God is understood as the cause of ordinary beings. Being is not unnamable: it is ceaselessly uttered, given epithets. But no name defines it exhaustively and exclusively. All the names of Being are corrections, so to speak, of other names, sometimes contrary ones. Thus when Heidegger "defines" Being as presence, he makes it clear that there can be no question of an absolute and whole presence, nor of a presence unto itself, but only of a presence which approaches us (An-wesen) and remains withdrawn. Being is sending out or "dispensing" (Geschick), but also a "suspension," épochè. Because without language, "the house of Being," there would be neither naming nor clearing, it could be tempting to see in language the most adequate name for Being. This would be to forget Being as original and mute gift, Being as silence. There is no proper name for Being. Even time is called only the "first name" of Being, that is, its most forward name, in order to avoid the massive identification: Being equals time. Whoever would at all cost assign an identity to Being would be thrown from one contrary to another: unconcealment/withdrawal, word/silence, superabundance/lack, the near and common/the distant and original, recollection (/ogosj/oblivion (Léthé), presence/secret, etc. Therefore Being must be said "in many manners." To attribute to it a singular name is inevitably to set it up as a metaphysical subject which is constantly and absolutely present. The use of other names—the gift (Gabe), the sending out or "mittence" (Geschick), the enframing (Gestell), the appropriating event (Ereignis), the foursome (earth heaven/mortals-gods), the play between thing and world—responds to this necessity. At the end of metaphysics, Being enters as it were into its "crisis of identity." Negatively speaking, it is no longer "identifiable" in the</page><page sequence="9">Research in Phenomenology Volume XIII 51 traditional sense; no name any longer suits it adequately and properly. Thus the event of appropriation (Ereignis) that is the "co-appurtenance" or the "reciprocal summoning of man and Being,"27 cannot be considered as a new transcendental denomination of Being. Positively speaking, Being is delivered from the domination of the identity principle A = A. For Ereignis designates the non equal identity of man and Being. Non equal because man depends upon Being, whereas Being is dispensed to man. Ereignis refers us to the possibility that the reciprocity between man and Being might arrive and be thought outside the metaphysical representation, outside the relation of subject to object, for example. It refers us also to "the possibility of passing beyond the mere reign of enframing,"28 that is, the possibility of overcoming the essence of technology. How can this possibility coexist with the effective pre dominence of technology? How does Heidegger think the articulation of these two dimensions Ereignis and GestelP. The paradox of "completed metaphysics" is that with it nothing is completed, that the age is frozen in its mold and tends to be indefinitely self-perpetuating. The "constant presence" so much desired by metaphysicians finds in technology its perfect realisation in the form of the Bestand, the basic reserve; nature is transformed into a gigantic store of constantly available and indefinitely transformable energy. If the age's closing in on itself, the absence of possible mutation, means the absence of distress, how does one explain this stubbornness of distress? What, on the contrary, is the condition of a possible turning point in history? "With out errancy," writes Heidegger, "there would be no relation between destiny and destiny; there would be no history."29 But why must history be "errant"? What is the meaning of errancy? What is its relation to distress on the one hand, and to the absence of distress, on the other? Errancy and Distress Of the Essence of Truth defines errancy as the tendency, apparently issuing from man, to resist the withdrawal of Being, to turn away from the "secret" (namely that unconcealment is at the same time concealment), in order to turn towards the evident, the accessible, the practicable. "To turn, insistant, towards the accessible and to turn away, eksistant, from the secret go hand in hand. They are one and the same thing."30 Aversion to the secret therefore characterizes existence itself and corresponds to its insistent propensity to give itself over to what is habitual, current, and masterable. "To insist" is to adhere to the evidence of being. Errancy closes access to the oblivion of Being. It is oblivion forgotten, oblivion fixed in place, for a time. All certainty and all security are errant and not</page><page sequence="10">52 Michel Haar The End of Distress: The End of Technology? erroneous, by virtue of the enclosing in an evidence which hides its "blind spot" from itself. In the everyday, such expressions as "that goes without saying," and "no problem" translate this secure-feeling blindness. "To settle down into daily life is equivalent to refusing to allow the concealment of that which is concealed to reign."31 Signs of errancy are not, of course, reducible to what ordinary life and common sense consider as "going without saying" (news, fashion, gadgets, social and political behavior), but they embrace all the thinkable structures of an age, its conformity as well as its rebellions. And yet man in errancy itself cannot escape from all relation to the secret. He puts himself in relation to the secret each time that he discovers that he cannot maintain himself in the full and total positivity of well known being. His refusal to recognize concealment cannot keep the latter from reigning. "Man is in the ek-sistence of his Dasein subjected at the same time to the reign of the secret and to the threat issuing from errancy. Both of them keep him in the distress ofconstraint [die Not der Nötigung]."32 Whence the "disquieted agitation" which marks Dasein, always torn away from the quietude of familiar being, were it only by the Stimmung or affects, which make him feel, suddenly, the strangeness of being as a whole, were it only by the sudden and simple unavailability of the "ready-to-hand," of the instrument which one has within reach, made to work, and which gets out of order. Man can neither find tranquillity in errancy nor affront the secret and distress. "The full essence of truth. . . keeps Dasein in distress (Not) by the perpetual movement (Wende) of coming and going. To be there is to re-turn to distress, Dasein ist die Wendung in die Not."33 Man experiences distress each time he is called back from being to Being. Is not anguish a form of distress in as much as man finds himself rejected by it from worldly existence to being-in-the-world as such? The text clearly marks the fact that the initiative in this "return" comes from Being; it is not Dasein which keeps itself in distress, but "the full essence of truth," that is, Being as uncovering and withdrawal. To exist ekstatically is to have the possibility of turning towards the secret (distress), but also of turning away from it (errancy). Like anguish, distress is not a state in which man could dwell, but the sudden revelation of the "movement," the global play of Being. Distress may be understood as the reverse of errancy. But if one is good (echt), the other is nevertheless not bad, for both are equally "necessary."34 Man is not originally responsible for either one. Not he, but Being as sending out (Geschick) decides between openness to distress or flight in errancy. Errancy is "necessary" because it comes from Being itself in that the latter withdraws and "itself leads beings astray with errancy."35</page><page sequence="11">Research in Phenomenology Volume XIII 53 The "necessity" which reigns over the history of Being has nothing about it of a logical obligation. In order for there to be "necessity," man has to have welcomed and received the distress of Being, has to have returned to it and again have turned away. In the Notwendigkeit, which we too banally represent as static and serene, free and transhistoric, Heidegger invites us to underscore the movement, the "turning" ( Wende) against a background of "distress/constraint" (Not). All necessity is errant, and all errancy is necessary. Every age, insofar as it establishes necessary and unshakable truths, "errs," that is, it forgets the distress and the withdrawal of Being. But this errancy is good, "succorable," as Hölderlin would have it, for it contains in its very movement the seed of transition to a new age by the return to distress. It is also good because it is necessary for each age to impose its own face of the true, to block the horizon and to forbid temporarily all other access to Being. It was necessary for the Greeks not to know the principle of subjectivity in order to be the Greeks. And yet errancy is not characterized only by the closing in upon itself of each age; it creates an historial link from age to age; it directs the linking together of the different ages inas much as the errancy of one weighs upon the next. Thus the Platonic determination of truth as an adequation predetermines the ulterior form of truth as certainty for the subject. If errancy is forgetful of Being, it is the guardian of its own tradition. Errancy rests upon the consolidation of acquired evidence, but it still allows destiny to turn, still preserves the possibility of a turning. Now the era in which technological rationality is set irreversibly in place seems paradoxically to suppress, or at least radically to transform both errancy and distress. It is as if the imperative to indefinite improvement which is proper to technology had led history to a point of no return. How could the world of technology which reinforces and refines itself ad infinitum, protecting itself from self-destruction, how could it ever yield, of itself, to another age of Being? The possibility of a return to Being becomes extremely faint. Progressive disintegration or the brutal collapse of the technological world would not be a veritable turning, but a shifting out of history, a passing for a "long interval" by way of the zero point, to be followed by "the abrupt time-span of beginning." Can the turning be an empirical event situated at the historical end of the age? Is it not rather a change in the relation to Being, which can intervene outside of all chronology? If a turning is still possible, how and in what time is it to come? The absence of distress corresponds to the fact that the sovereignty of metaphysics has become imperceptible. The "evidence" of technological rationality is so powerful that its metaphysical bases (the principle of</page><page sequence="12">54 Michel Haar The End of Distress: The End of Technology? reason, the "will to will," that is, productivity for productivity's sake) no longer have to be questioned nor even to be named. They have become invisible because they are so evident. In uttering purposely the name of Being (idea, substance, subject... ) errancy still maintained a direct relation with Being, with its questionability. No more distress, no more access to that trembling margin where suddenly uncovering and withdrawal are to be recognized together once more. Figures of the Absence of Distress The absence of distress brings about therefore the reign of a metaphysical truth more immovable than at any other period: being is "placed under security" in an unlimited manner. Total "security" (securus comes from sine cura) presupposes the elimination of all possible care concerning Being. The real, being true, that is, technically produced and manipulated, is protected from any mutation of its "truth." The product is being, man the producer of products; this is not to be questioned, production is just to be subjected to perfected organization. The politico-economic putting in order of being is all the more bitter and violent as it has no other goal than to hide its "emptiness of Being." Organization organizes nothing so much as it does the "locking up," "the insurrection of being against Being." In other words security demands the systematic blocking, the violent obstruction of all the dimensions in which a relation to Being could unfold, such as the earth, world and thing, Stimmung, language.... The relation to the earth is not lost by the fact of a vague uprooting of man in industrial society, because he is cut off from nature or lives in a homogenized and artificial environment. Rather it is the technological product which excludes the very existence of something like an earth, that is, a ground which is non-objectifiable, un-limitable in the world, a pure, incalculable upsurge of nature or a peculiarity of place which cannot be universalized. If there is no more "earth," no more "native soil," nor specific place irreducible to any other, it is because technology demands the destruction of the earth and its replacement by a uniform and universal neutral space. Scientific knowledge of space, beginning with its géométrisation and its mathematisation, is prelude to the technological domination of space, which is domination at a distance. Anchoring as well as wandering, proximity as well as distance are cancelled. Thus communication and observation satellites make it possible to project image or sound from any point on the planet to any other point Technology achieves "spatialization," in other words absolute mastery of space (of which the conquest of cosmic space is</page><page sequence="13">Research in Phenomenology Volume XIII 55 merely a consequence). Spatialization conceals not only the specificity of place but also the capacity for things to compose space themselves and to reveal places by virtue of themselves. From the point of view of universal coordinates of space made uniform, an object is no longer anywhere. It suffices to compare an "historic" bridge which by linking the banks of a river founds as it were the site of a city, with a prefabricated bridge of an autoroute for example. The latter has no greater affinity with one space than with another. It has no place, no earth. Should one even speak in terms of a "world" of technology? In order for there to be world, the whole opening of Being must come into play, the play of uncovering and of withdrawal, of earth and heaven, of closeness and distance. We do not belong to a world unless we can be situated there, near to or far from things, themselves familiar or disquieting. Now the spatialization, the uniformization, and the calculability of all relations introduces what Heidegger calls the "without distance,"36 abolishes all closeness and all distance. A world is also a configuration of historiaP7 options, one which knows itself to be related to destiny. Now in the world of technology, all decision appears as already having been made. No further choice is possible, no further event worthy of that name. Alone there continues the destruction of the earth to the benefit of the perfectly circular movement of production and consumption. The "circle of wearing out for consumption is the sole process which characterizes the history of a world become non-world."38 The "world" of technology has become "non-world" because the fixity of the technological project forbids any feeling of a decision which marks an age. This "non-world" remains afterward lost in a multifarious "indecision": all differences tend to be erased—between the important and the accessory, between the near and the far-off, between the state of war and the state of peace, between joy and pain. Undifferentiation gives birth to indifference. "The indigent age does not even feel its distress {Dürft) any longer."39 Indifference or insensitivity to all Stimmung (tonality or disposition), even to those of the greatest suffering, is doubtless the greatest misery, brought by the absence of distress. For all things, all situations have a resonance or "ambiance" which opens us to them. All Stimmung reveals a distress, which demands to be said—even if adequate words cannot always be found—and a "good distress" because it sets a path, were it the path of errancy. "There where, in the abyss of Being, there is not to be found an opening giving a disposition (stimmende Eröffnung), there is not either the distress/constraint (Not) which obliges to name and to say."40 The absence of distress does not correspond to an objective absence of suffering but to a loss of sensitivity to any kind of</page><page sequence="14">56 Michel Haar The End of Distress: The End of Technology? Stimmung. Poverty, despair, violence, even terror no longer reveal anything, especially anything related to a destinai distress of Being. Unlimited suffering, measureless pain signal the condition of the world and everywhere silence it as the fullness of distress. In spite of everything, this situation, at the base of its history, is without distress. But in the light of the history of Being, this is the supreme and most hidden distress. For it is the distress of Being itself.41 The immense pain which is passing over the earth can discretely awaken no change, for it is felt passively as an object offered to an act....42 It is taken up in the movement of technological objectification. "Distress" is objectified as quantitatively measurable penury and subjected to humanitarian acts such as "technical assistance," which, if it is politically, economically, and morally justified, dissimulates nevertheless the essence of distress. The quantifying of penury in other forms—the calculating of natural resources or animal species, the measuring of the "healthfulness" of the environment from different pollution rates—hinders the possible experience of a destruction of the earth. Thanks to the numerical evaluation which leads one to believe that every lack, every poverty is calculable, technology reintegrates "distress" into its own project. The counter-projects, such as the ecological preservation of nature, also belong entirely to its reign. "Technology ... is the organization of poverty."43 Figures for the technically organized absence of distress are innumerable. All of the modern world could be placed under their very heading, from its most colossally visible, "gigantic" forms, such as forced planning and bureaucracy, outlandish levelling of styles of living, over-equipping, overarmament, down to its more hidden forms: the abasing of language into jargon, the effacing of the sacred. Language on the one hand "computerized," on the other simply levelled and impoverished by the media, is reduced to the transmitting of pre established messages. Turned into a simple tool of communication, language rises up against utterance, excluding more and more from itself any capacity for an original showing of things. Is the need for poetic utterance still felt by the civil servant of technology who has adapted well to his task of regulating the cycles of production and consumption? How could the dimension of the sacred still appear, in the absence of a poetry capable of celebrating it? The connection between the disappearance of the sacred and the reign of technology is clear : even before its being the</page><page sequence="15">Research in Phenomenology Volume XIII 57 "trace of the divine,"44 the "space which grants dimension for gods and god,"45 the sacred unfolds as the salutary and the safe (das Heile), the "untouched," that which remains intact, inaccessible to any manipulation, to any project of enframing. The safe is the very condition for the appearance of a sacred. Now technology absolutely can not leave safe, leave alone any one region of the world which might escape its clutches. The integral profanation of the world is part of the essence of technology. Moreover, since "perfect security" is achieved, says Heidegger, the search for a dimension that is intact and safe, a disquiet about the possibility of a "saving power" no longer even have meaning. The absence of distress implies, as does in Kierkegaard "despair with an additional degree," that the salutary or saving is no longer foretold, nor desired, nor imagined. The Temporal Ambiguity of the Turning How will such a profound distress, one which is not only self-ignorant, but also self-complacent, ever be able to "turn." The turning depends at once on a "favor" of Being and on a "conversion" ( Wende) of man. Only Being is capable of "destining" one day the metamorphosis of its "last age." Only Being is capable of granting what Heidegger calls the "grace" (Held) to answer its call. But only thought can conduct the absence of distress back to the distress that it really is. Thought alone can "see" Being there where it is most hidden and forgotten, in the essence of technology. How does this "conversion" come about? Even if the forgetting of forgetting is unavoidable, Heidegger has shown that man can at least, in this distress of truth "experience errancy as such."*6 Even if all access to a "salvation" is refused him, man can at least "see the absence of salvation as such." He can also "see the danger as such,"47 When, in the same way, he can see the absence of his distress as such, the distress that it harbors turns, turns into necessity perceived in Being itself. The "as such" brings forward the necessity of Being, which, because it is affirmed, changes into freedom. To give oneself over to distress (constraint/necessity, Not) is, says Heidegger, to set free at once the essence of man and the truth of Being; it is to accomplish the "freedom of the offering."48 This "offering" is thought itself, as a gift in return thanksgiving : Denken is Danken. The Heideggerian conversion requires, as does in Nietzsche the amor fati, an affirmation of necessity, the "turning of distress," provided that this fatum not be thought of as fatality or determinism, but as a free "sending out," free "destiny" of Being. Heidegger writes of the eternal</page><page sequence="16">58 Michel Haar The End of Distress: The End of Technology? return that this doctrine must not be subjected to the "pretended 'antinomy' between freedom and necessity."49 In the same way as the Nietzschean eternal return, the turning is not a fatally determined event "unfolding blindly somewhere, but the turning of distress [Notwendig keit]."50 Is not the turning, like the eternal return, the transmuting of the most extreme distress and necessity into grace and freedom? "Man is not freed except insofar as he is included in destiny (Geschick)."51 But can the event of this transmutation be situated in any time whatsoever? If one must give up the idea that the turning accomplishes an "effective" change, an overcoming of technological domination, must one not at the same time give up any attempt to situate it chronologically? Is not the turning both outside chronological history and outside all determinable time, even outside the history of Being? We must not ask, "where and when will it come about? No one knows; nor is it necessary to know. Such knowledge would be the worst thing for man, if his essence is to be the one who waits, he who waits by thought for the essence of Being.52 The turning is not an event in "ontic" history, but how is it to be situated in the history of Being? Certainly not in the same way as an age. The turning would express rather the singleness of history as it releases itself whole, to thought, of a piece from the Greek dawning to the twilight of technology. As is the Ereignis, the turning is written only in the singular, singulare tantum. Pure singularity does not belong to any historical or temporal sequence. Is it not significant that Heidegger should have given this same name (die Kehre) both to that which he also calls "the eschatology of Being,"53 the gathering up of history in a final extremity, and to this long development in his own thought of ever more insistent conversion towards the primacy of Being over man, and finally to the thought of Being as such, from its beginning in Being and Timel And yet the turning does seem to be accomplished in the present with the coming to light of the essence of technology and the thought of the danger which it entails. "When we open ourselves to the essence of technology, we find ourselves caught in a liberating call."54 The turning "makes its appearance (Kehrt ein) in what is presently the age of Being."55 Now this "here and now" is constantly and simultaneously thrown into an indeterminate future, when the question of waiting for a turn in Being arises or when the turning appears uncertain because the indefinite perpetuation of technology threatens. The same text that describes the "appearance" as it were actual, insists strongly on waiting</page><page sequence="17">Research in Phenomenology Volume XIII 59 and distance with respect to "the far-off coming of the essence of Being itself."56 This temporal ambiguity—present/future—shows even more clearly when Heidegger describes the thing and the world. On the one hand, the thing (a simple pitcher of water) assembles here and now earth and heaven—the concealment of the source and the visible process of the seasons—and guards the experience of a certain closeness against any objectification. But on the other hand, under the domination of scientific and technological rationality "the thing as thing remains null"57; "never yet have things been able to appear as things to thought,"58 and this means, strangely, even in prescientific ages. In any case modern man everywhere meets only objects which are neither near nor remote, which are "without distance." How can the turning take place here and now and remain under expectation? How can the thing at once appear and not appear as thing, assemble and not assemble the world? It seems that the turning takes place neither in present nor in future time. Could it be that it does not take "place," not because it is "u topian," but because it belongs to another ek-static time, the time of the "appropriating event" having broken with the history of Being as it extends into technology? "It is suddenly that the turning comes," like lightning, the text several times emphasizes.59 It surges forth like the Einblitz, "the lightning entrance" of the world and the thing (historical dimensions) into the history and the age of technology. The night of technical enframement is torn through by the lightning flash of the thing. But how can we understand the coexistence—even if only for a fraction of a second—of these two heterogeneous dimensions? The thing and the world, would they even be glimpsed or dreamt of, as the hypothetical solution at the close of an age, and have they no other Being than marginal, no other time than virtual? Do the turning and the Ereignis coexist with the Gestell as the possible with the real? Does the thing appear only as a possible thing beyond or before the object? Yes, provided that we suppress the "only" and immediately add: the possible is not the hypothetical, it is not the virtual inferior to the real except in its metaphysical acception; the possible is not to be understood in its restrictive sense but as the higher wealth and power of Being itself. The pitcher is not virtual, and more than ... "the bench, the bridge ... the stream, the mountain... the horse, the book, the picture... the cross.... "60 These things enumerated by Heidegger have no techno logical function, are powerless, are neglected. They are "modest and minimal," discrete and rarely perceived. But they are presently. Their poverty shelters the wealth of Being. The articulation of the turning as re-entering of Being and of enframing remains nevertheless difficult to apprehend. Sometimes the two dimen</page><page sequence="18">60 Michel Haar The End of Distress: The End of Technology? sions are simply juxtaposed. Enframing and saving power "cross paths" and can indefinitely cross paths like the trajectories of two stars."61 This juxtaposition would be the basis of the "pessimistic" perspective of an infinitely long reign of technology. Sometimes, on the contrary, Heidegger emphasizes the internal link between the two dimensions, the fact that Ereignis, the saving power comes not after technology, but coincides with the apprehension of its essence. The Gestell shows "in the negative" the Ereignis, which does not liberate any new age but delivers this age from its oblivion. Finally, the theme of a succession of ages reappears when the Gestell is designated as the "prelude," or the "fore-glow" ( Vorschein) of the Ereignis. Does not the Ereignis then become inevitably the first period of a "future history"? * * * The internal link of simultaneity which Heidegger establishes most often between the thought of the essence of technology and the turning remains in many ways enigmatic. How are we to understand that "with the turning... the world comes about"?62 Is this to say that the thought of the thing and of the world springs from taking into consideration the objectification of the world as its other facet? Is there not a leap between the reading of technology—as uncovering and ultimate metamorphosis of the history of metaphysics—and the figure of the thing as meeting of earth and heaven, of men and gods? How is it that the extra-metaphysical can arise from the consideration of the essence of metaphysics ... if the entire age is stamped with the figure of metaphysics? In other words, if technology were Being itself, the thought that Heidegger defines as obedience, response, co-belonging to Being, would it not necessarily find itself exclusively subjected to the technological "imperatives"? How can there be a non calculating thought? If technology were Being itself, would the call to let things be—near or remote—the call to retrieve the earth and the authentic habitation, the call to regain a non-instrumental relation to language, be heard? Could it even be uttered? In order for there to be simultaneity of the Gestell and the Ereignis, of calculating thought and thought of Being, is it not necessary for the double face of the Janus bifrons to rest upon one single bust or base? In order not to conclude upon an unthinkable split in Being, must we not admit that its untouched dimension, that which "re-enters," has not been wounded either by metaphysical errancy, or by final distress, and thus that Being has not been radically compromised and torn at its base by its course through the ages, and that to a certain degree it remains in itself</page><page sequence="19">Research in Phenomenology Volume XIII 61 imperturbable? "The darkening of the world never tarnishes the light of Being."63 "Never," that is in any historical moment whatsoever. "... The earth remains sheltered within the inapparent law of that possible which earth itself is."64 What power thus protects the earth from the "great fatigue" of technology, "the wear and the over-multiplication of the artificial"? The earth—the essence of nature or the primordial possible which bears up worlds—protects itself. "The hidden law of the earth conserves it in the moderation which is content with the birth and the death of all things in the assigned circle of the possible."65 This assurance, utterly different from metaphysical certainty or calculated security, is scant and elemental, but miraculous. It tears Heideggerian thought away from nihilism to which the impossibility of overcoming metaphysics in effect would inevitably reduce it. The belonging of man to Being, even extremely inaccessible, the earth, even devastated, remain both indestructible. Listening is never in vain, the elemental layer never lost. This assurance or this confidence keeps the task of the deconstruction of the wayward tradition from wearing itself out in a gratuitous formal game. But does it not considerably weaken the import of the discourse on distress and on danger? "Thanks to this listening," writes Heidegger, in one of his finest lectures, "we are allowed to hear the song of the earth, to hear its vibration and its shuddering, the earth which nevertheless remains out of the reach of the colossal tumult that man is presently organizing on its devastated surface."66 If the earth, shaken, it is true, nevertheless conserves its own music "out of reach," if we can perceive it, as we can listen serenely to the "voice of Being" above the din of the age, that is because distress, however deep-lying and impalpable its pain may be, is always overcome already, without work, without mediation, graciously.
