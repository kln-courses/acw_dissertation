<plain_text><page sequence="1">INTERNATIONAL POLITICS, LAW, AND ORGANIZATION Force, Order and Justice. By ROBERT E. OSGOOD AND ROBERT W. TUCKER. (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1967. Pp. viii, 374. $10.00.) This is a difficult book to discuss. It is divided into two parts, each by a different author, which are meant to arrive at the same goal by different paths. The two parts do not really fit together, however, and they are also of strikingly different quality. Professor Osgood's section, an historical discussion of changes in the means of interna- tional violence, the role of violence, and strategic thinking about its use over the last two centuries, is disappointing, often unoriginal, and unsatisfac- tory; Professor Tucker's essay, addressed strictly to normative concerns, is stimulating, original, and valuable. Osgood's introductory chapter, on the insupera- bility of obstacles to international order, is a good summary which, as he acknowledges, owes much to Rousseau, Aron, Waltz, Hoffman and others. (It also states a viewpoint that Tucker relies on later, and thus represents the only problem dis- cussed about which one can be certain the authors are in agreement). Osgood then proceeds to give a good brief history of modern warfare up to the nuclear era, demonstrating the failure of both "laissez-faire" (e.g., balance-of-power) and "sys- temic" (e.g., general disarmament) theories about the control of international violence. In a chapter titled "The Control of Force" he continues with an account of developments since the end of World War II, in which the problems and pros- pects of nuclear arms control receive an informed and speculative (though not often original) discus- sion. Osgood's history is marred, however, by the vir- tual absence of any consideration of political fac- tors in the expansion and control of force. His emphasis is entirely on developments in weaponry and strategic thinking, and on the gradual break- down of European alliance systems. Taken in con- junction these factors are said to account for the drastically increased scope and intensity of vio- lence in the last century. But of the political roots of international disorder, the underlying processes -nationalism, imperialism, revolution and the emergence of mass-based governments-which de- termined that the developments Osgood discusses would have such catastrophic results, almost no mention is made. His preference for regulatory (as opposed to laissez-faire or systemic) controls on force remains merely a prejudice, therefore. The "professional" managers of conflict who are ex- pected to accomplish such regulation seem to be the same kind of people whose strategic thinking is earlier described as having once been so disas- trous. Nor are Osgood's assurances that "they" have learned the lessons of the past satisfactory, for it is not the state of decision-makers' intellects but the political forces operating on them which are decisive in setting the direction of their be- havior. For what purposes do the professionals-the theorists and practitioners of nuclear deterrence today-manage force? Cui bono? Professor Os- good's few references to such questions are not</page><page sequence="2">1968 BOOK REVIEWS AND NOTES 1013 reassuring for here, when he does discuss the polit- ical dimension of violence, he betrays an often un- alloyed cold-war nationalism, as evidenced by the following remarks: ". . . military deterrence in Asia must depend far more than in Europe on local non-nuclear fighting capabilities. Yet no mili- tary deterrent can prevent wars that capitalize on the vulnerability of the Third World to insur- gency, except by the demonstration through mili- tary resistance that such wars will fail or involve too great a risk of disadvantageous escalation." The "Third World" is a concept from the realm of propaganda, not social science; and the theory here put forth is one not of "deterrence" or "regu- lation" but rather of expansive American power. Osgood rather precisely describes where such thinking has led in the past, but apparently fails to see any connection, and this is discouraging since he is presumably a professional manager of force himself. Professor Tucker's contribution, a discussion of the philosophy of force developing contempora- neously with the events Osgood describes, is of a different order altogether. His is a lucid, often brilliant treatment of normative judgments and their empirical roots and consequences: still the sort of thing that political science does best. Among the propositions for which he offers per- suasive argument the following are the most chal- lenging: 1) The perceived aversion to force in mod- ern times is unfortunately accompanied by a ready ability to justify its excessive use. 2) The 'moral economy" of force depends largely on its quantitative effects, and the development of nu- clear weapons therefore heightens all preexisting dilemmas about the use of force. 3) Rules for the restraint of force are in practice completely fragile as long as the rightfulness of any degree of force thought requisite for preservation of the state in extremes is accepted; the theory of nuclear deter- rence, which proposes to police "limited" wars with the underlying threat of utter destruction, is the ultimate expression of this essential incompat- ibility between the idea of limits and the idea that national self-protection is necessary for the preservation of individual and communal happi- ness. Tucker's own view of the role of force is ambig- uous, since he recognizes both the sometime valid- ity of the argument from necessity and the per- verse uses to which it is often put. (Indeed, his discussion of the intellectual and physical crimes committed in the name of raison d'etat is both trenchant, and happily free of Osgood's national- ism). He offers a qualified "optimism" about the prospects for successful deterrence and "crisis management" regulation. This solution to the problem of force is also Osgood's, and here Tuck- er s analysis is like Osgood's in being not political enough: his idea of a "new beginning" seems at the moment to be wishful thinking (though that is surely preferable to nationalist bias). After his previous comments, this conclusion is surprising. At the end, however, he does note the extent of the disaster that will occur if his optimism proves unjustified, and asserts that we must somehow go "beyond deterrence" eventually (which is the point that Osgood ignores). Having pointed out the critical need for some world order, and the presently insuperable obstacles to it, he has taken his analysis as far as it can go. The result, in any event, is an essay well worth reading and reread- ing.-PHILIP GREEN, Smith College. The Trial of the Germans. By EUGENE DAVIDSON. (New York: The Macmillan Co., 1967. Pp. vii, 636. $12.50.) Yet another book on the Nazi Era-could well be ones first reaction to the title of Eugene Da- vidson's The Trial of the Germans. That reaction could be followed by a second one, upon reading the sub-title "An Account of the Twenty-two De- fendants Before the International Military Tribu- nal at Nuremberg": Why rehash the Nuremberg Trials more than twenty years after they oc- curred? After reading Mr. Davidson's voluminous ac- count and perusing his twenty-two page bibliogra- phy which is a painstaking collection of Allied and German primary and secondary sources, both con- temporary and historical, and covers the entire pe- riod of the Third Reich as well as much of the material of the Trials, I submit that this book be ranked the definitive one volume study on Nu- remberg. It is not only a very scholarly volume, but it raises the questions of the Nuremberg Trials-the legal as well as the moral ones-in a manner and at a time that make this book a major addition to the bookshelf of the historian, the political scien- tist, the international lawyer, the legal scholar, but above all, the political decision-maker in the age of nuclear weapons, total war, and such "unde- clared" warfare as Vietnam. The leaders of National Socialism and the archi- tects of the Thousand Year Reich come to life again in the book the twenty-four originally named the twenty-two who stood trial of whom eleven were sentenced to "death by hanging"; those who would be tried later; and those who did not have the courage to face the consequences of their actions which resulted in the deaths of mil- lions of innocent people, and escaped trial by sui- cide. Grouped into the major political, social and eco- nomic institutions which were the pillars of the Third Reich, the reader encounters once more Ju-</page><page sequence="3">1014 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW VOL. 62 lius Streicher, at the "Core of the Conspiracy"; "The Number-Two Man," Hermann Goering; Bormann, Hess (the only man still in Spandau Prison and probably the only one of the defen- dants who should have been committed to a men- tal hospital) and Rosenberg representing the NSDAP in "Action and Theory." "The Diplo- mats," Ribbentrop, Neurath, and Papen; Schacht and Funk for "the Party and Big Business"; Frick "The Law" and "Youthleader" Baldur von Schir- ach; "Party, Police, and Army" are tried in the persons of Kaltenbrunner, Keitel and Jodl; and Grandadmirals Raeder and Doenitz representing "The Navy." The final chapters of the book deal with "The Proconsults," Frank and Seyss-Inquart; Speer and Sauckel, who were charged with "Build- ing the War Plant" on "Forced Labor," and the "Propagandist" Hans Fritzsche making a poor substitute for Goebbels who had taken his own life. Each one of the men and his ambitions, his rise to power, his weaknesses and vices in many cases, his strengths in some instances, as well as their pettiness and rivalries, their visions and blindness are portrayed with painstaking accuracy, based on thorough examination of memoirs, documents, re- cords of interrogations, and on what friends, rivals and foes said about the defendants. Their behav- ior during the various stages of power in their lives and while they stood in the dock as accused is described and analyzed. If most of them emerge as a weak, sick and sorry lot, it is because that is what they were-not of what the author made them. By the same token, the Tribunal, the Prose- cutors, and the Defense appear as they must have been-and in the sober light of hindsight some of their actions are as petty and sorry and as moti- vated by blind zealousness and political overeager- ness as most of the defendant's actions had been in earlier days. In his meticulous examination of the Trial rec- ords and his fair narration Eugene Davidson pre- sents all facets of the drama at Nuremberg: the arguments of judges and prosecutors, the struggle of the defense lawyers to obtain evidence on be- half of their clients, the ideological orientations of the justices representing the Allied powers, and the attitudes of the defendants towards their for- mer superiors, who had escaped the trial by sui- cide, and their behavior towards each other as well as their responses to their charges. The great- est merit of the book, however, is the re-examina- tion by its author of the moral and legal questions raised by Nuremberg, the complex issues of "war guilt," "crimes against humanity," and "prepara- tions to wage war." These issues have been con- fronting mankind since the beginning of time, but they have taken on new, vast dimensions with the systematic extermination programs of innocent peoples devised by the National Socialists as well as the large-scale killing of soldiers and civilians in total warfare. Davidson concludes his first chapter with the observation that the Nuremberg Trials served as "catharsis of the pent-up emotions of millions of people" which had to be provided, and as a "re- cord of what had taken place duly preserved for whatever use later generations would make of it." "The record would not completely document the infamy in the twentieth century, but it would re- veal one vast concentration of evil that could be exorcised." The final chapter, an evaluation "Two Decades Later," defends Nuremberg as a "political event," "if not as a court." In it, the Nuremberg Tribunal is assessed as of doubtful legal validity, but once more its role in pinpointing the moral issues con- fronting mankind in our age of kill and overkill is stressed. The book presents an autopsy of an era, but the author goes one step further, he does what a true scholar should do-once the facts have been presented as accurately as possible, he tries to re- late them to the norms and values which must be our concern in this age of ideology and total war- fare.-ELKE FRANK, Hunter College, City Univer- sity of New York. The Years of Opportunity: The League of Na- tions, 1920-1926. By BYRON DEXTER. (New York: Viking Press, 1967. Pp. xxiii, 264. $8.50.) Politics and Diplomacy of Peacemaking: Con- tainment and Counterrevolution at Versailles, 1918-1919. By ARNO J. MAYER. (New Yoik: Al- fred A. Knopf, 1967. Pp. viii, 918. xx. $15.00.) New perspectives on the Versailles settlement and the early history of the League of Nations, such as those suggested by the titles of these works, are overdue. Neither book, however, pro- vides convincing explanation of the interpretive thesis which its title suggests. Neither faces up to the task of explicitly relating the historical record to an appraisal of the possible and the probable. The gap between what is asserted or assumed and what is demonstrated is partially closed by argu- ment in Dexter's book, but one wishes for more evidence; in Mayer's lengthy work, citations abound, but no sustained attempt is made to show just what it is that they prove. Byron Dexter, the long-time managing editor of Foreign Affairs, has written an interpretive essay for "the general reader." The book is padded by discursive background commentary and by the texts of the Covenant and the Charter, leaving only about 120 pages which deal with the first seven years of the League. It provides a mellow resume which is not inaccurate (except for the as- sertion that Japan did not submit reports on its</page><page sequence="4">1968 BOOK REVIEWS AND NOTES 1015 mandate in the Pacific) but which immerses events in atmospherics so deeply that they lose outline. Discussion of the Mosul opinion of the Permanent Court, for example, which could hardly have been less incisive, is followed by the com- ment: "It was a very interesting judicial opinion, following a line of reasoning along curves that caused eyebrows to be raised among lawyers." The principal thesis, however, is clearly set forth and is worthy of attention, for it contrasts both with an orthodoxy which has long prevailed and with the assumptions of the Mayer book. The "opportunity" which Dexter sees was to make use of the League as the instrument of Britain and France in maintaining a settlement which, on the whole, was fair and moderate. The crisis for the League was the attempt to maintain an effective guarantee of the territorial provisions of Versailles as an essential condition for disarmament and the reconstruction of Germany, through the Draft Treaty of Mutual Assistance and the Geneva Pro- tocol. "The pacifist illusions of the time," however, gave Stresemann the opportunity through adroit appeal to deprive the League of the "core of orga- nized power" which was needed for collective se- curity and to turn it into an instrument of ap- peasement through the Locarno agreements. While Locarno "did not itself produce Hitler," it "guaran- teed the success of his strategy." Mayer's work, in contrast, is a major feat of his- torical scholarship. Following his Political Origins of the New Diplomacy, 1917-1918 by eight years, it represents an exhaustive exploration of avail- able sources in many countries. At the very least, it is a vast compendium of contemporary com- ment. Unfortunately, it is not much more than that. It is clear that the author has brought to his work a viewpoint based on conviction. In the preface, he deplores the tendency "either to avoid crucial controversial issues or to treat them in terms consonant with the current conventional wisdom" and gives credit to several "fellow inter- nal exiles" for having "fortified" his "critical out- look." Already his work has been hailed by the New Left for having identified the origins of what it sees as the main theme of American diplomacy: "Containment and Counterrevolution." But no- where in a very long work is there more than a sketchy statement of the interpretative thesis or an attempt to weight its merits in comparison with other viewpoints or emphases. In part, it is because the present work is a sequel that one feels a lack of orientation. The main categories are es- tablished in the earlier book and the various strands of political and social movements in the several countries are identified. But one looks in vain there also for an appraisal of options which justifies the categories. In Mayer's approach, "the forces of order" con- front "the forces of movement." In "this first round of the international civil war of the twen- tieth century," the European Right undertook the "twin assignment of stabilizing governments throughout Europe and of containing if not de- stroying the Russian Revolution." They used the "spuriously inflated bogy of Bolshevism" in calcu- lated efforts both to advance foreign policy goals and to fortify political positions at home. It might appear that "the clamor for a punitive peace" was not the best approach to these objectives. In Mayer's view, however, this "was stirred up as part of a vast political design" the purpose of which was not to fend off the revolutionary Left but "to rout and destroy the very core of the forces of change, . . . pre-emptively" before it could rally around Wilson and make gains toward "the forty-eight hour week, collective bargaining, graduated income taxes, and social welfare mea- sures." Wilson and Lloyd George, who correctly, Mayer points out, "rejected the conspiratorial view of the Russian Revolution," fell victim, it would seem, to this counter-conspiracy of the Right. Ultimately, it is a matter of taste and of philos- ophy whether one accepts a conspiratorial (or a counter-conspiratorial) view of history. Neither proof nor disproof is likely to be convincing. It must be pointed out, however, that a thesis may gain currency and prestige from the apparent sub- stance of narrative and citation to which it is re- lated. It is almost an earmark of revisionist his- tory to mobilize detail and disregard proportion: one thinks of Tansill and of Beard. In my opin- ion, the mass of evidence which Mayer sets forth does not support his view. It is an extended cata- log of folly rather than a telling collection of clews. It shows the blindness and despair of men overwhelmed both from within and from without by forces not comprehended, and taking refuge in nationalism, rather than conspiratorial calculation. It induces renewed respect for Wilson and even engenders sympathy for Lloyd George. In this new time of turmoil, it is poignant reading indeed. One matter of revisionism in style should be noted. Mayer has succumbed to two expressions which are dear to undergraduates but which have rarely if ever appeared in serious writing. Neither was used in his earlier work. In the belief that they constitute linguistic decay rather than lin- guistic development, I have woven them into a concluding assessment: While I am "not about to" deny the value of this work as documentation of popular and political responses to a turbulence which swept across national boundaries, it is "not all that" valuable as an interpretation of the moves and the motives of the men at Versailles. -WHITNEY T. PERKINS, Brown University.</page><page sequence="5">1016 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW VOL. 62 The Functioning of the International Political System. BY ANDREW M. Scorr. (New York: The Macmillan Company, 1967. Pp. x, 244. $3.95.) Professor Scott seeks in this essay to apply sys- tems theory to the field of international politics. He is inspired to do so by his disenchantment with the persistent vogue of the "view of world politics that has been dominant for generations.;' Founded on the "obsolete" concepts of equilib- rium and balance of power this traditional view is unable to cope with new realities, fails to avail it- self of modern empirical techniques and is of little use in the practical exercise of problem-solving and policy formation. Yet the "new approaches" which treat today's problems with today's tech- niques have failed to make this old approach the relic it deserves to be. No one has as yet gathered these new approaches together and presented them in an ordered fashion. What is needed is a new method. The author proposes to use systems analysis which has the ca- pability of integrating these new yet disparate ap- proaches into a coherent whole. The integrating mechanism is the "vocabulary" of systems analysis which "makes possible the conversion of separate currencies into a common currency" linking to- gether "observations relating to nationalism, loy- alty, ideology, capabilities, statecraft, collabora- tion, conflict, escalation, deterrence, negotiation, decison-making, communication, community for- mation and so on" (p. 9). His second point is a promise not to clutter his model with normative assumptions. He admits that systems theory is no freer from involvement with normative elements than the theories of yes- terday, but he does not propose to substitute a new set for the old. He explicitly rejects models such as Easton's "authoritative allocation of values" and anthropomorphic and teleological "baggage" such as "systems maintenance" and pursuit of goals. To be effective, he claims, the systems approach must produce a value-free framework "hospitable to many types of support- ing analysis." Professor Scott then uses the vocabulary of sys- tems analysis to describe the "new approaches." International relations, the nation-states, govern- ments and politicians are replaced by such termi- nology as systems, subsystems, actors and deci- sion-makers. The language stresses the interrela- tionship of the "individuals, organizations and na- tion-states" that make up the international sys- tem. It also succeeds in dividing the new ap- proaches into two categories-one dealing with ac- tivities occurring within a system, the other with activities occurring between or among systems. Creation of images, ideology, communication and decision-making are examples of intrasystemic phenomena; they are either attributes of specific systems, as would be the case of ideology, or are specific functional systems in themselves, such as communication. Intersystemic activities may be exemplified by negotiation, deterrence, threats, conflict and collaboration. The latter category clearly demands a plurality of systems. To sum up, the first category presupposes interaction among disparate functions within a unified whole. The second presupposes interaction between or among unified wholes. The point is that both in- trasystemic and intersystemic activities and the approaches which analyze them deal with aspects or parts or a larger whole but not with the whole itself. Thus the new approaches emerge as applica- ble to elements of the whole international system, but not to the system itself. What is this total system? The application of systems language to the new approaches suggests that the model of a system at a subordinate level is a self-contained unit composed of complemen- tary interrelated parts. It follows that the maxi- mal system-in this case the international system -should be structurally similar. But the picture of the international system which emerges bit by bit as one makes his way through the book turns out to be a different type. One is first told that the international system is a "conflict" system. Then it is asserted that the system is evolutionary. And finally, in a burst of candid prescriptive rhetoric, the reader is apprised that the defects of the in- ternational system stem from a characteristically unsystemic lack of capability to provide direction and purpose. The system "has been seriously defi- cient in rules, norms, and institutions to facilitate collaboration and to regulate conflict" which "can be remedied only by the development of supple- mentary forms of (transnational) authority" (p. 230f). The Hobbesian world of nation-eat-nation will evolve contractually into one that will in the end produce a world sovereign. It is evident that until such time as the miracle is wrought, norma- tive assumptions which appear not uncongenial to the lesser constellations would be inapplicable to a "system" that has yet to arrive at systemic coher- ence. Once achieved, however, one is left to won- der if such an ideal world polity, alone and un- challenged by anything but environment, could justifiably be considered a system. Professor Scott's target appears to be the under- graduate classroom. He has made an interesting contribution by applying systems analysis to the "new approaches" in order to bring them together in a single volume. In attempting to give them place in one all-inclusive theory, however, he has stretched the analytical framework beyond its ca- pability.-FREDERIC WURZBURG, University of New Hampshire.</page><page sequence="6">1968 BOOK REVIEWS AND NOTES 1017 The Politics of the Third World. BY J. D. B. MILLER. (New York: Oxford University Press, 1967. Pp. xiv, 126. $3.75.) This brief, readable volume begins with the ob- servation that "the Third World [is] a cant phrase, derived from the French tiers monde and used to describe those countries which are plainly neither Communist nor Western." It ends with the con- clusion that "A Third World characterized by unity, purpose, and effective tactics is . . . a chi- mera." In the intervening pages, the author strug- gles to demonstrate the existence of something re- sembling that cant phrase while at the same time denying its vitality if not its validity. Despite the concept's ephemeral nature, how- ever, the author identifies the states that comprise the Third World, analyzes the well-springs of na- tional interest that often undergird their policy determinations, discusses their roles in the United Nations and regional groups, and evaluates their relations with the maj or powers. Finally, in a chapter entitled "Vulgar Errors," the author at- tacks what he somewhat patronizingly refers to as "certain illusions about the Third World." This endeavor more so than the rest of the book seems to depend almost wholly on the author's judg- ments of what motivates Third World states, what exactly they are striving to do, and why. After de- scribing the first "vulgar error" as one of viewing the states as a bloc or harmonious group, the au- thor proceeds to commit what often appears to be the same error by treating them as a unified group in foreign policy attitudes and actions. Yet, his analyses, taken individually, usually make sense to this reviewer. In their demands for trade liberali- zation without reciprocity, for example, the author asserts that Third World states are not seeking to despoil the advanced countries but to give impe- tus to an increase in trade that can only serve to enrich both sides. The widely shared myth that the poor countries of the world, like the poor of the American ghettoes, can improve their lot only at the expense of richer states or citizens is one of the most durable and devastating fables. It must be exposed and discarded if some semblance of real stability is ever to be achieved. Througllhout this book, Professor Miller develops interesting if not unique observations concerning the special attributes and needs that characterize the political life of Third World states. Their leaders, he notes, began as agitators for indepen- dence who promised great changes once the impe- rial yoke was removed. Their failure to achieve these kinds of changes has produced a "decaying national movement" in many, and it has become clear (at least to Professor Miller) that two groups are now indispensable: one, the European- educated people in commercial, professional, and administrative posts who are the only ones who can run the government and the economy effec- tively; and, two, the army, which is the only group that combines discipline, modernization, and opportunity to coerce. The author provides a few examples of military-governed states-Egypt, Nigeria, Burma, Ghana, Pakistan, and Indonesia -but he suggests no evidence that might support a conclusion of indispensability. Although the case for greater "efficiency" is an obvious one, whether a class of technocrats aided by a military elite can evoke the national spirit and call forth the sacri- fices of the masses to support a successful modern- ization effort remains an unresolved question. Times have also changed in terms of the foreign policy imperatives of Third World states, accord- ing to Professor Miller. The early flamboyant mil- itancy of the independence movements and the ef- forts to stay clear of entangling alliances with the East or West established a common bond among them that led to the holding of the Bandung Con- ference of 1955 and the enunciation of the "Ban- dung spirit." The abortive effort to hold a "second Bandung" in Algiers in 1965-described appropri- ately by the author as a "non-event"-leads him to the conclusion that "there is little future for Afro-Asianism as such." Yet, much of the book tends to belie such a sweeping conclusion. More positive bases for developing unity and coopera- tion than the older anti-colonialism and anti-Wes- ternism are emerging in such fields as trade, aid, development, and United Nations politics. Al- though the author avoids discussion of human rights, here in particular Afro-Asianism has found a rallying cause that can support a unanimous Third World condemnation of South Africa and Rhodesia as the worst offenders. The efforts of Afro-Asian states to spur the world community into taking effective action against these two major transgressors have, in fact, been far more productive of Afro-Asian unity than of changing policies within the two states. In addition, the ter- rible destruction that has been visited upon Viet Nam to "protect" it has tended to rekindle a com- mon abhorrence of military alignments that may have been weakened prior to 1965 and the massive American involvement. The author, who is Professor of International Relations at the Australian National University, has done a generally first-rate job of discussing and interpreting the politics that characterize many Third World states. The book, however, contributes little to scholarly inquiry in the field that is essentially new or helpful to a deeper un- derstanding of the Third World states. One can hardly expect a penetrating, definitive piece of work on such a complex, motley group of entities in little over one hundred pages. But, in spite of</page><page sequence="7">1018 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW VOL. 62 this drawback (or conceivably because of it), the book is one that can be highly recommended as a supplement to the introductory international poli- tics course. It should have a stimulating and chal- lenging impact on the student who is in the pro- cess of being initiated into the rather nebulous world of international politics because its central themes are developed from a different frame of reference than those found in most textbooks on international politics. Thus, it can supply the stu- dent with a new perspective for analyzing and evaluating world politics.-JAcK C. PLANO, West- ern Michigan University. The Intermediaries: Third Parties in International Crises. By ORAN R. YouNG. (Princeton: Prince- ton University Press, 1967. Pp. viii, 427. $10.00.) The author in this volume on third-party inter- vention in crises asserts that his purpose is to break new ground in generating hypotheses about the management of conflict. He further states that the study is chiefly "an hypothesis-raising" rather than "an hypothesis-testing" effort. The central goal of the various lines of enquiry-six in num- ber-is to outline at least the rudiments of general theory of third-party intervention. But the theoretical material and apparatus which the author develops, he feels, is not suffi- cient. To add clarity and relevance to the theoret- ical material and apparatus, it is necessary to en- gage in testing of theory by applying it to prag- matic situations. He singles out the peace-keeping effort of the UN as the concrete situation to test, and points out that this form of third-party inter- vention is currently under the doctrines developed during the Hammarskj6ld regime, which "take a dim view of the possibility of constructive United Nations intervention in superpower crises." Since the international system is changing rap- idly (what the author means by "system" is not explained), he advances the proposition that "the overall framework of the international system" in- cluding "the more specific relationships between the Soviet Union and the United States, have been moving in directions which place the notion of constructive United Nations intervention in fu- ture Soviet-American crises clearly and definitely within the realm of the possible." While the Hammarskj ld concept of the limits of the United Nations intervention in conflicts be- tween power blocs still prevails today and is likely to remain so in the foreseeable future, the author asserts that the propositions he advances in this volume "are more nearly a set of supplementary ideas than the basis of an alternative to the pres- ent theory. . . . In fact, they constitute," in the author's opinion, " a response to the broad spec- trum of international crises to which the prevail- ing theory does not address itself." These "supplementary ideas" derive from an analysis of the rapid and substantial changes that are presently taking place on a number of fronts. The author observes that there is a decline of bi- polarity and a trend toward a pluralistic arrange- ment of power centers. He describes the develop- ments in this area as focusing on four themes: "1) polycentrism within the established blocs; 2) the declining efficacy of maj or alliance systems; 3) the rise in the numbers and salience of extrabloc actors; and 4) the emergence (or indicated emer- gence) of several new 'great' powers." The analysis of these four themes, predicated on a number of possible variables, is highly speculative. However, the speculations appear to be educated ones and require the thoughtful and concentrated attention of the reader. How then will all this affect the prospects for third-party intervention by which the author, if the reviewer understands him correctly, means the United Nations? Is it likely to reduce or enhance the prospects for third-party intervention? The author continues his speculation, and engages in a somewhat tortuous description of "a full-blown version of a modified balance-of-power" where "the United Nations could come to act more nearly as a concert mechanism than as an independent opin- ion factor." This, however, the author avers might be a temporary phase since it would very likely be highly unstable. He concludes that "the possibili- ties of third-party intervention in various situa- tions would almost certainly become salient again." Whether the author's "supplementary ideas+" based on predictions such as the "hard shelled" territorial state is declining and that the sense of international community is growing, thanks to the advent of nuclear weapons, will in- deed supplement the Hammarskjdld concept, this reviewer can not predict. The author manifests no hesitation in answering the question affirmatively. The review's conclusion about this book is that the hypothetically minded student of international relations might possibly find the analysis stimulat- ing even if somewhat discursive, and the pragmat- ically minded, unrealistic and difficult to follow.- DAVID W.

Despite the lapse of time in the fast-moving world of diplomacy, the book holds up well.</page><page sequence="8">1968 BOOK REVIEWS AND NOTES 1019 Professor Grosser begins with the proposition that foreign policy may be evaluated on the basis of the extent to which it has "attained the goals for which it was intended." His concluding chap- ter, using that criterion contends that de Gaulle's "positive record is short, and the negative record very long." In between, chapters examine that rec- ord with respect to Algeria, tropical Africa, Fran- co-German relations, Europe, defense, and East- West relations and NATO. Prefatory chapters deal with the record of the Fourth Republic and de Gaulle's foreign policy conceptions. An epi- logue carries the account forward from 1965 to 1967. Professor Stanley Hoffmann of Harvard Uni- versity wrote a special foreword and the author revised the epilogue for the American editions and Lois Ames Pattison made the very competent translation. The author does not apply his criterion to de Gaulle systematically, nor does the material lend itself to such application consistently. Often, de Gaulle's goals are not defined publicly or are so ill defined as to be useless in attempting to evaluate his success. Take Algeria, for instance. What goal did de Gaulle have in Algeria in 1958? Integration? Inde- pendence? Autonomy? One may argue very plau- sibly that he had no goal except to end the war as soon as possible while preserving as much of French influence and interests as possible. If so did he succeed? No one can say. No one knows what was possible. Grosser believes that "de Gaulle did not, from the beginning, desire the pol- icy that he adopted in the end," that he wanted Algeria to have "a sort of internal autonomy," rather than full independence. If so he failed. By Grosser's criterion, de Gaulle also failed in tropical Africa. His "community on a federal model" col- lapsed within two years and de Gaulle was com- pelled to improvise another facade behind which French control might be maintained. So, too, with his policies toward the western alliance. Neither NATO nor Britain nor West Germany nor Spain has become a suitable weapon in his assault on the United States. Grosser sees "the most impor- tant aspect of other European countries have not yet become aware of that role." He may, indeed, be playing that role as he sees it, but as long as "his five European partners are in fundamental disagreement with him," he cannot play it very well. Is that success? Grosser is especially severe in evaluating de Gaulle's military policy. He believes that conven- tional forces would be more effective for French defense, especially as de Gaulle's nuclear force lacks that essential element of deterrence-credibil- ity. But, is defense de Gaulle's goal? If so, only conjecture can measure its success until-or-unless- his force fails to deter. If not, what is his goal? In either case, the problem of evaluation by Grosser's criterion is very difficult. Quite apart from problems of application, more- over, one is obliged to ask whether the author's criterion is adequate. De Gaulle suggested another criterion himself in The Edge of the Sword: "men are remembered less for the usefulness of what they have achieved than for the sweep of their en- deavors." By that criterion, de Gaulle fares well. The res- toration of France to great power status, the use of NATO to control American foreign policy glob- ally, the elevation of balance-of-power politics to a global plane, the organization of a bloc of neu- tral nations behind France, and the replacement of American influence in Latin America are sweep- ing endeavors, indeed. But, is the amount of re- membrance as important as the cause? Is de Gaulle to be remembered as the greatest showman since Barnum or as a great statesman who maxim- ized French power and influence. To answer that question one must adopt differ- ent criteria than either Grosser or de Gaulle. Does not "the usefulness of what they have achieved" evaluate statesmanships? Should not de Gaulle be judged by the extent to which he has served the enlightened self-interest of France than by the glamor of his performance or his ability to achieve such goals as he chooses? Grosser's selection of criteria and his failure to apply them systematically detract from the value of this essay. Nevertheless, it deserves the atten- tion of serious students of French and interna- tional affairs. The author is an astute, perceptive Gaullogist who sheds much light on his subject. We will be much in his debt when he writes for the Fifth Republic as systematic and scholarly a study as his La Quatrieme Republique et sa poli- tique exte'rieure.-WILLIAM G. ANDREWS, State University of New York, Brockport. The Sea in Modern Strategy. BY L. W. MARTIN. (New York: Frederick A. Praeger, 1967. Pp. 190, $5.00.) There is hardly any question that the grand concepts of war at sea as developed primarily by Alfred T. Mahan have lost their glorious individu- ality. The reasons for this are at least three-fold. First, the nuclear weapon sits perched above all considerations of war, and, despite much talk about "firebreaks" and the "tradition of non-use," the super-powers can hardly envisage a major war between themselves in which there is little danger of nuclear weapons being used. One of the results of this circumstance is that it inhibits conceiving of a war which is both on a grand scale and pro- longed, which is the kind of war that makes the classical naval strategy come to life. Second, with sea forces able to throw inland and land forces</page><page sequence="9">1020 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW VOL. 62 able to hurl out to sea missiles or aircraft capable easily of three thousand miles range, the pre- viously sharp distinction between the dominion of the sea and that of land has become exceedingly blurred. Third, we live in a world in which, at least so far as surface and naval air power are concerned, there is really only one great sea power, the United States. The Soviet Union has a formidable submarine fleet, and, after some back- tracking, is now adding substantially to her sur- face fleet. Nevertheless, despite its tremendous ad- vances in performance since World War II, the submarine (where it is not a strategic weapons launcher) is still mostly an instrument for chal- lenging maritime control rather than establishing it, and the Soviet surface fleet is not the kind of challenge to U.S. naval power that we have ob- served in naval races of the past. One might also add that insofar as naval opera- tions like those conducted in 1950-1953 around Korea and since 1964 around Vietnam need to be described in strategic terms, the conceptions handed down by Mahan and others still do well enough. At least, our present author seems to think so, and I believe he is right. This situation very much affects what is left to write about. On the other hand, large sums of money are being spent on naval armaments, in which there have been very great changes since the end of World War II. These changes, as well as compara- bly drastic changes, which have occurred also in the political climate, call for continuing clarifica- tion of the appropriate character and functioning of modern naval arms under those various sets of circumstances that appear sufficiently probable to warrant the kind of anticipation which costs money. Hardly more than two years ago we had the work by Admiral Sir Peter Gretton, Maritime Strategy: but Professor Martin has justified the assumption of himself and of the Institute for Strategic Studies, under whose auspices he pro- duced the present book, that there was room for yet another approach. Admiral Gretton's book and this one are, after all, the only new books of their kind that have been available for some time, and the market has therefore hardly been surfeited. Professor Martin first examines the nature of modern naval forces. He has done his homework well, and the disposition to do so is usually an ex- cellent substitute for a high security clearance- without entailing the disabilities often clinging to the latter. Professor Martin then moves on to consider such things as the use of sea power in "wars of intervention" characterized by Korea and Vietnam, and "occasions for limited war at sea" where he discusses among other things the curious view originally put forward by Mr. Paul Nitze and apparently embraced also by Mr. Robert S. McNamara (although neither is mentioned in this connection in the book) that naval power acting by itself may on occasion serve an important role in restraining enemy aggression, thereby presum- ably making it unnecessary for troops to become involved in the mud and jungles of another Viet- nam. I think the generally negative attitude which Professor Martin shows to this idea is entirely correct. Other chapters, among the total of eight, bear titles like "Cost and the Naval Balance" and "Sea Power and Non-Belligerent Action," which adequately describe their content. This is an honest book, and it contains a, good deal of useful information. It is also intelligently organized. I wish it were possible for me to be more enthusiastic about it. The reasons I cannot, lie in the tone of the book, both stylistically and intellectually. The writing is clear enough, but ex- ceedingly and everlasting bland, lacking the occa- sional penetrating and skillfully executed phrase which makes the person reading it content at the moment not to be doing something else. No doubt more important is the equally bland quality of the thinking, reflected in the author's disinclination really to struggle with an idea or insight, whether his own or someone else's. Professor Martin often expresses a preference for one view over another, but it is rarely other than a mild and tentative preference. He ob- serves that contemporary admirals seem not to grapple with the really critical questions of future naval war, but neither, beyond pointing this out, does he. A significant question to which he draws notice he dismisses with the comment that it "might perhaps be debated"-but the debating he leaves to others. On what is among the most cru- cial of relevant issues, the effects of nuclear deter- rence in determining levels of engagement or com- bat, he gives to the somewhat exceptional views of a colleague the accolade that his argument "is by no means implausible," but that is the end of it. All this gives one the sense of non-involvement, and how is the reader to become involved when the author is not ?-BERNARD BRODIE, University of California, Los Angeles. The European Common Market and the W~orld. BY WERNER FELD. (Englewood Cliffs. Prentice- Hall, Inc., 1967. Pp. vii, 184. $4.95.) This is a valuable little book, which is almost monographic in nature. It seems to be one of sev- eral studies of the European Economic Commu- nity commissioned by Prentice-Hall. Professor Werner Feld, Chairman of the Department of Government at Louisiana State University, has examined the relationships, internal and external, that have grown up with the existence of the Eu- ropean Economic Community. The EEC is a political entity whose chief worth</page><page sequence="10">1968 BOOK REVIEWS AND NOTES 1021 is economic. Its inception created the third great economic union. These economic unities-Ameri- can, Soviet and European-create a host of prob- lems and prospects. They cannot be ignored; they must be accommodated. The formation of the EEC was no simple pro- cess. It had predecessors of limited purpose and value. Its members were involved in organizations as various as NATO, OEEC (OECD), and GATT. The possibility of conflicting allegiances was seri- ous. Most nations brought with them a baggage train-special relationships with former colonies, monetary zones, and settled trade patterns. Reconciling these conflicting interests and obli- gations was no easy task, and the first decade of the EEC was devoted to this delicate, often exas- perating task of internal harmonization. The com- ing years must be devoted increasingly to a recon- ciliation of conflicts with the rest of the world, the theme of Feld's work. The relationship of the EEC to the American common market has been one of efforts to accom- modation marred by irritating incidents like the "war of the frozen chickens." The connections with the Communist bloc has been one of growing intercourse with surprisingly minimum frictions. The EFTA nations are an especial difficulty, for this is a rival bloc of like nations with common associations. The most crucial matter could be the special relationships with the developing societies, most of whom are former colonies. These pride- ful nations-so jealous of their nationhood and their economic independence-have practically de- manded and received a special association with the EEC from their former metropolis. With this privileged position goes inevitably the peril of economic dependence, the handmaiden of political dependence. The EEC is no monolith; it is beset by strains and fissures. Vital interests must be protected. The sheltering of French agricultural inefficiency has aggravated the more efficient agricultural nations of the market. The privileged arrangement for the many and diverse French client-states caused no small exacerbation within the walls. The strength of the German industrial complex constitutes a source of discomfort, raising faintly the specter of the Zollverein. The French veto of the British ap- plication caused a trauma among certain quarters within the EEC. Moreover, there is a fundamental disharmony in the Common Market along the lines of the ancient American experience-the sus- picion and conflict between the large and the small states. The Benelux powers fear and resist the transformation of the entity into a Gallic or Teutonic economic community. The political and economic power of the Com- mon Market is quietly and steadily growing, and its existence creates certain problems for the world economy. Any such markey is a form of economic regionalism with its protectiveness, provincialism, and discrimination. It has begotten other such re- gional corporations-the Latin American Free Trade Association and the Central American Common Market. This economic regionalism can produce distortions in the trade patterns of the world economy. The common markets and cus- toms unions promote intramural trade at the ex- pense of international trade. More and more, trade may be between the blocs, not among the nations. High tariffs may decline among the na- tions only to reappear among the blocs. True in- ternational trade may suffer with the proliferation of these markets. The greatest prospect for the EEC lies in the political arena. The original conception envisaged the growth of political unity, possibly a suprana- tional European state. Already, the embryonic structure exists in the form of extranational par- ties, interest groups, parliaments, courts, and coun- cils of ministers. Certain practices and rituals of the Eurocrats approached diplomatic intercourse and vaguely hinted of sovereignty. De Gaulle complained that Commission President Walter Hallstein was assuming the prerogatives of a "chief of state." Moreover, present French policy resists political integration while basking in the benefits of economic union. De Gaulle seeks in- stead a l'Europe des patries-united in certain po- litical and economic matters but separate in their nationhood and sovereignty. Professor Feld has ably considered the place of the EEC in the politics and economics of the world. The work is written with a husbandry of words and a care of expression that is admirable. It is comprehensible to the informed layman with- out losing its value to the specialist. The treatise avoids the pitfalls-common to such works of po- litical economy-of inundating the reader with charts and statistics. Detail and statistical illustra- tions are abundant and useful, but the book is not burdened by them. The excellence of the work is slightly lessened by the absence of a bibliography. The EEC literature is growing rapidly, and such a compilation would have been helpful. However, this omission is partially compensated by com- plete references in footnotes.-VERNON C.

The translation of Kurt Muller's book only proves that you can not tell a book by its outside cover. Only if the reader happens to look inside the title page will he discover that originally Muller's book was entitled Uber Kalkutta nach</page><page sequence="11">1022 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW VOL. 62 Paris? The title change in the translated version therefore gives the impression that it is com- pletely devoted to a discussion of communist for- eign aid. Although the original title is sexier than the actual product, it is nonetheless a more accu- rate reflection of the scope of the book. Unfortu- nately the discussion of foreign aid makes up less than one half of material covered and much of what is devoted to foreign aid is simply a listing of foreign aid and trade agreements. Because of the mislabeling, the reader sits with the expecta- tion that there will be more analysis of communist foreign aid than there actually is and therefore he is disappointed when he does not find it. Much of the other material in the book if taken on its own terms would be interesting in itself, but since the appetite is whetted for a discussion of foreign aid, one sits and waits for the main course only to see it flit by without feeling really satisfied. As for what is actually in the book, it is fair to say that Muller has brought together a good deal of useful information about Soviet relations and ambitions in the less developed world. Thus this could be a handy reference source. Unfortunately there are numerous shortcomings in this volume which prevent the realization of this prospect. One of the major problems is that Muller's book was originally written in 1963 and subse- quently revised for its translation into English. Since communist policies in the developing coun- tries have changed so rapidly, it is not enough to make an alteration or two in the old manuscript in the expectation that the book will then reflect the current state of events. In several cases the entire context has changed. For example on p. 73, Muller attempts to show how the communists at- tempt to subvert a country through the use of communist trained functionaries in the schools, ca- dres, and publishing houses etc. As an illustration he cites the Ghanian weekly paper, The Spark. But as Muller himself recognizes, since the Ger- man version was published, Nkrumah has been overthrown. Since this is the best example that Muller seems to be able to find, it would appear that this particular case if it proves anything, proves the opposite. That is, such endeavors have not been ultimately successful from the commu- nist point of view. His example of communist sup- port for Oginga Odinga in Kenya is similarly in- appropriate. Because of the day to day gyrations in Cuban foreign policy, Muller finds himself with all kinds of inconsistencies in his handling of Soviet and Chinese relations with Cuba. On p. 56, he talks of the Russian desire to create Cuban-style bridge- heads all over the world. Subsequently he de- scribes China's anger because Cuba has opted to follow Russian foreign policy. At this writing at least, the Russians would be quite surprised to hear that the Cubans have been classified as loyal followers of the Moscow line. The changes over time may also explain why Muller's long lists of reasons and explanations al- ways fail to provide a complete answer to the problem he is trying to analyze. This happens on p. 62 and again on p. 92. It often seems that new paragraphs which have been added to bring the book up to date disprove the analysis so one is left wondering why the analysis was made in the first place. The effect of such incidents! creates a very dis- jointed book. Perhaps this can be blamed on poor editing. This unsettling feeling is made worse by the fact that the last two-thirds of the book con- sists of 200 pages divided up into 28 chapters; that is an average of 7 pages per chapter. To say the least, it is uncommon to read chapters that are only 3 to 4 pages long in a book devoted to the social sciences. Moreover the book's editors apparently made no effort to tone down some of the intemperate political language. The commu- nists or their sympathizers are almost always re- ferred to in such terms as "hacks" or worse. The book also contains numerous small mis- takes. On p. 26, Muller says that communist coun- tries provided sizeable loans only after 1956 whereas on p. 240 he acknowledges that the Czechs were an exception and started lending in 1954. He omits a Soviet loan of $45 million worth of sugar to China in 1961. He is also wrong on p. 96 when he states that India does not extend for- eign aid. Similarly he is incorrect when he claims that the other communist countries are incapable of building a complete plant without Russian sup- port or supplies. There are important exceptions such as the Rumanian oil refinery at Gauhati, India and the Czech tool works at Ranchi, India. On occasion, it is the Russians who find them- selves forced to rely on outside help as in Nepal where they have had to call in the Czechs to pro- vide equipment for the Russian sponsored sugar mill and cigarette factory. Muller is also wrong when he says that Soviet statistics do not reflect technical services provided by Soviet technicians. There are some larger questions as well that Muller never confronts. Have the Russians ever thought through the consequences of their foreign aid program? If their aid is successful, and eco- nomic development in fact takes place, will this lead to communism as Muller seems to think or to an economically viable and independent gov- ernment? Lest the reviewer be misunderstood, there are many redeeming sections in this book. Muller finds traces of Sino-Soviet animosity as early as 1956. He also shows how the Russians start with an adverse foreign trade balance in their dealings with less developed countries and generally end</page><page sequence="12">1968 BOOK REVIEWS AND NOTES 1023 up with strongly favorable balances of trade. Only Malaysia seems to have avoided this hazard. He also explains how the Russians have managed to provide themselves with a loophole for the legal reselling of commodities purchased from the de- veloping countries. Also Muller has gathered fairly complete lists of loan agreements extended by both the Russians and the Chinese. But as if Muller were destined to have a difficult time with this translation, even that which is valuable may be of no use for the researcher. For some reason, the translators have neglected to include either an index or bibliography. This makes much of the material irretrievable and therefore of limited use. -MARSHALL I. GOLDMAN, Wellesley College. Insurgent Era: New Patterns of Political, Eco- nomic and Social Revolution. By RICHARD H. SANGER. (Washington: Potomac Books, 1967. Pp. 231. $6.95.) One category of books on international politics is that of the interpretive report by the diplomat or journalist who does not pretend to be a social scientist and who may be pleased that he is not. In the 192040 period books of this sort were espe- cially numerous and influential in shaping popular images of such things as conditions in the Uka- raine or the exploits of Abd-el-Krim. Too few of them were written by shrewd diplomats. Some went beyond personal involvement to discuss events they did not know immediately. This book falls into the latter sub-class. Written by a former American F.S.O. with experience in the Middle East and Africa, it is representative of a category which has declined in numbers during an age of higher levels of knowledge and new methods. The author undertakes to sketch the history of eight cases of unrest since 1917. He uses "societal revolutions" as the frame for Communist struggles in Russia and China, the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 and Cuba's 26th of July Movement. Distilla- tion creates unsatisfactory generalizations, e.g., the account of the Bolshevik seizure of power (pp. 29-31). Problems of analysis are also apparent. The chapter on Egypt begins with the statement that "The Egyptians are not Arabs. . . ." They might not be, but their recent leaders have thought that they were with significant political results. Glibness is not absent. Mohammed Ali is described as a "son-of-a-Macedonian-tobacco-mer- chant-turned-Pasha" and his importance in mod- ern Egyptian history passed over lightly. Few of the book's historical summaries are creative. The best one of them is about Cuba. Under the heading of "Independence Rebel- lions" Mr. Sanger discusses Indo-China, concen- trating on the emergence of Ho Chi Minh and the military events up to the Geneva Conference. Subsequently, Vietnam from 1954-1967 is discussed under the third main part of the book, "Cold War Conflicts," a section which also includes chapters on Magsaysay and the Huks, and the Congo. The author adopts the view that communism is largely responsible for Vietnam's troubles. He did not make use of Douglas Pike's study of the Viet Cong. Against the liberal tide, his interpretation of Diem is sympathetic without being unbalanced. Included under "Independence Rebellions" is Gan- dhi's nonviolent nationalism. More might have been said about the inclusion of the Indian leader and satyagraha. Apparently it was the author's in- tention to illustrate that protest takes many forms and to suggest that the study of insurgency should not be limited to political violence. What principles were used for inclusion of some struggles but not others? No clear explanation is given. Is there a theory to tie together the cases selected? The reviewer could not discover any other than what is found in the statement that "no man need settle for a dirt floor merely be- cause his father did." Some men, of course, will settle for a dirt floor if they can get rid of foreign- ers, a point indirectly recognized by the discussion of India. A "Life Cycle of A Revolt" is presented in Chapter 1. The model includes the elements of the leader, popular cause, support for the party of revolt, outside help, use of mobs, and others. All the cases selected do not fit the model. Is there any larger pattern to these upheavals? The author speaks of seven waves of unrest since 1648, the most recent beginning about twenty years ago. In an appendix he offers an uneven listing of violent events for 1945-1966. Yet there is no suggestion about the meanings of these waves and events other than the implied teaching that change is permanent. Perhaps the main disappointments about the book are the lack of definitions to help tell one conflict from another, and the fact that the in- sights of the diplomatist were withheld in his ef- forts to photograph epic landscapes.-PAUL F.
