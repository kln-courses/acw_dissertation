DUNN Columbia University It is good to see Kropotkin's articles on Mutual Aid, first published in The Nineteenth Century between 1890 and 1896, and in book form in 1902, brought again to the attention of students of evolution. With all its faults it is a great human document, an expression of the indignation, shared by many and clearly and popularly expressed by Kropotkin, which is aroused when man is viewed as a creature formed by struggle against his fellows, and when his institutions and societies are seen as results primarily of this struggle. It was T. H. Huxley's essay on "The Struggle for Existence in Human Society" published in The Nineteenth Century in February 1888 which aroused Kropotkin's indignation and his articles and later book (it is the 1914 edition with its preface which is now reprinted) were direct replies to Huxley's essay. For comparison with this re-issue I took down my copy of the original edition of 1902 of Mutual Aid which I read as a student over 40 years ago. My notes recalled the impression it had made upon me, for I too was trou- bled by the antithesis in man's nature, and had been led to Kropotkin by Graham Wallas' The Great Society which I read in the same year 1914. To look at those two books now is to see as in a mirror the young man with that time as a background. Then I saw dimly what seems clearer now-that both views, Kropotkin's and Huxley's, were incomplete and distorted be- cause they confused scientific with moral or ethical questions, and tried to justify their views on both from the same evidence. There are many causes of this confusion. "Aid" and "struggle" appear where we use them in a narrow, anthropomorphic sense to be transitive verbs which imply the kind of consciousness (our own) which seems driven to form ethical judgements. It is an all too common practice for those who aim at objective views justi- fied by the facts and the reasoning method of natural science to use such words without precision and to attribute to a natural process such as evolu- tion meanings and motivating forces which are expressions of human (and often humane) aspirations and fears. Surely we should not adduce the be- havior of such stereotyped automata as ants or their societies as evidence for either view; nor should we, as Huxley did, preface our arguments "I am as strongly convinced as the most pronounced individualist can be--." Kropotkin's use of the evidence was determined by his philosophical posi- *Mutual Aid, by P.

It was Huxley's characteriza- tion of the cosmic (evolutionary) process as a "dog-eat-dog" affair against which Kropotkin's ire and opposition were aroused, and for which he tried to substitute his ethical idea of mutual aid, buttressed by evidence of coop- eration in animal societies. Although T. H. Huxley occasionally justified his ethical views by his reasoning as a scientist, he did not try to derive them from evolutionary evidence. This remained for his grandson to do fifty years later (J. S. Huxley, Evolutionary Ethics, the Romanes Lecture, Ox- ford 1943); but the impression left by that attempt was that if one tries to derive today's ethics from evolutionary principles, he ends up by seeing its highest achievement in human societies of today and ascribing to the evolu- tionary process itself an ethical purpose. And this takes us out of the realm of science and into that unseen universe of belief into which Wallace, with more simplicity and directness, retreated. These thoughts are not intended to belittle the achievements of Kropotkin or of Huxley or their followers in the last century or in this one. They faced our common dilemma and chose their sides; and since the processes of reason by which we all must live, are forwarded by defining alternatives and putting forward the issues to be clarified, we owe for this real service our thanks to all of those concerned in this controversy and to Professor Ashley Montagu for again calling it to our attention.</page></plain_text>
