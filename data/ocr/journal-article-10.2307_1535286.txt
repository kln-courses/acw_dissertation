<plain_text><page sequence="1">560 BOOK LIST classified as a form or sub-branch of either Aramaic or Canaanite, but rather as a rep- resentative, thus far unique, or another independent branch of the larger Northwest Semitic family" (p. 293). A. Wolters considers the literary structure of the text, which he arranges in par- allel lines: after the title come four sections, each beginning with narrative and ending with a quotation of what is said. F. Israel, like other contributors to the volume, dis- cusses the classification of the language of the inscription, and argues that it is neither an Aramaic nor a Canaanite dialect, but he finds an affinity with the language of Israelite poetry. It is "le plus ancien specimen atteste par l'epigraphie de la langue poe- tique des Semites nord-occidentaux au cours du premier millenaire" (p. 316). The volume end with a list of contributors and an index of biblical references. [J.A.E.] Katrina J.A. LARKIN, Ruth and Esther. Old Testament Guides. 106 pp. Sheffield Academic Press, Sheffield, 1995. C6.96, $9.95. This is an impressive contribution to the Old Testament Guides series. The range of scholarly opinions and arguments are clearly presented and a particular interest is shown in matters of text, canon and versions. In the Introduction, Larkin begins with a comparison between the books of Ruth and Esther, and it becomes clear that the similarities are fairly superficial in comparison with the differences that emerge as one reads through the guide. She discusses tradi- tional issues such as date, context, literary style and character, and theological concerns in reference to each book but also includes more recent preoccupations with structure, narrative artistry and the history of interpretation. Her presentation is very fair to all sides of different arguments, and one often wonders where her own sympathies lie. However, in the nature of the genre as an impartial introduction to the books this is probably no bad thing. Larkin mentions recent feminist scholarship in reference to Ruth, but scarcely in reference to Esther, which some might see as an omission. There are excellent bibliographies and suggestions for further reading. [Katharine J. DELL] C. LEVIN, Derjahwist. FRLANT 157. 456 pp. Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, Gottingen, 1993. This new contribution to Pentateuchal criticism is not as rooted in the older source-criticism as its title might seem to imply. Levin describes the substructure of his work as "eine(r) redaktionsgeschichtliche(n) Erganzungshypothese, die sich ftr die vorre- daktionellen Quellen mit einer Fragmentenhypothese verbindet" (p. 34). His Yahwistic redactor is located in an exilic situation (in both time and space) between Deuteronomy and the Deuteronomistic History. The main arguments for this dating are the redac- tional character of the work and the prominence given by the redactor in Genesis to the fact that Yahweh is "with" the patriarchs even when they are in a foreign land. Levin's work and the recent books of John Van Seters (Prologue to History [Louisville, 1992] and The Life of Moses [Kampen, 1994]) were written independently of one another. Though they agree on the date of "J" and (rightly in the reviewer's opinion) in noting many contrasts between this work and the Deuteronomistic corpus, they differ both in many details of the analysis of the text and especially in the fact that Levin believes that not only did J have extensive, apparently written, sources but that it is possible, on the whole, to distinguish the source-material from J's own contribution. In this he acknowledges his debt to those like K. Budde, H. Gunkel and the elder R. Smend who distinguished two strands within the J source, but with the difference that (i) for him the "later J" is not an independent source but a redactional layer, and (ii) the "older J" is not a continuous account of Israel's origins, but a series of shorter narratives dealing with, e.g., the primeval history, Abraham and Lot, Joseph in Egypt and the Moses tra- ditions. An important feature of Levin's analysis is his attempt to identify the J redaction by positive evidence, in the form of the distinct theology of Yahweh's accompanying presence: this builds a stronger case for the unity of the material than a process of analysis by elimination of other, more easily recognizable, units (i.e. E, D, P). On the other hand, and possibly because of his rigorous dependence on this method, he is</page><page sequence="2">BOOK LIST unable to identify more than a very meagre account of the Exodus story from this source (a further difference from Van Seters), with no account of the plagues or of any legislation, covenant or theophany at Sinai. It seems to be implied that all other mate- rial (even the "E" passages) is of later origin. The result is a reconstructed narrative which is very much fuller in Genesis than in Exodus. A more detailed study of Levin's theory would need to examine whether it is as well grounded in Exodus as it seems to be in Genesis and whether the arguments he puts forward for an exilic date are really as compelling as he suggests. But this is without doubt a weighty contribution to Pentateuchal study and a refreshing change from the recent tendency to focus on Deuteronomistic contributions to the pre-Priestly Pentateuch. [G.I. DAVIES] L.M. MCDONALD, The Formation of the Christian Biblical Canon. 205 pp. Abingdon Press, Nashville, 1988. The character of this book is primarily historical, but the author clearly indicates his view that the canon of Scripture is an unnecessary straightjacket for the Christian Church rather than having any continuing authority. Only the first three chapters deal with the O.T. Ch. 1 makes some reference to "canonical interpre- tation" and its problems; ch. 2 considers the meaning of the key terms "scripture" and "canon". Ch. 3 addresses the major historical issues about the canonization of the O.T. in Judaism and Christianity: McDonald emphasizes the diversity of views about the lim- its of the canon in first-century Judaism, and claims that from the beginning Jesus and the early Christians embraced a canon of Jewish scriptures which was wider than the Hebrew Bible as it is known today. In support of this claim he cites (and adapts) the list of over 150 references or allusions to the deuterocanonical/apocryphal and pseude- pigraphical literature in the N.T. collected by Kurt and Barbara Aland. It is, however, most misleading to overlook the fact that many of the so-called references or allusions are uncertain. For example, at the beginning of the list Matt. iv 4 is said to be a cita- tion from or allusion to Wisdom xvi 26: but it in fact contains an almost verbatim cita- tion of the LXX of Deut. viii 3 introduced by "It is written", whereas Wisdom xvi 26 presents an adaptation and paraphrase of the same verse from Deuteronomy. This is of no relevance at all to how the Wisdom of Solomon was regarded in the earliest Church. The next example (Matt. iv 15 ~ 1 Macc. v 15) is no better. In its reconstruc- tion of the early history of the canon the book is often very speculative and it contains a number of minor errors (for example the inclusion of three Greek biblical manuscripts among the "Lists of Old Testament Books in the Western Churches" on p. 179, where it is also not mentioned that the limited contents of Codex Sinaiticus are due to its being only preserved in part. [G.I. DAVIES] W. McKANE, A Late Harvest: Reflections on the Old Testament. x + 182 pp. T. &amp; T. Clark, Edinburgh, 1995. ?19.95. McKane states in the preface that these "'Reflections' have a relation to the transactions of the Honour seminar on Old Testament Theology which I conducted... in the University of St Andrews and as such they are a con- catenated description of my own Odyssey" (p. vii). Ch. 1 begins with the repetition by Moses Maimonides of "a dictum of earlier Jewish scholars to the effect that 'the Torah speaks in the language of the sons of man"' (p. 1), and with the contrast between the biblical use of anthropomorphic language about God and the philosophical preference for the via negativa when speaking of him. McKane goes on to consider the philosophical ideas of Thomas Aquinas and other thinkers, including in modern times A.M. Farrer (whose name appears as "Farrar"). The discussion goes on in ch. 2 to "the limits which Maimonides places on our knowl- edge of God and the economy which he imposes in making affirmations about God" (p. 23). It comes to a focus on the Israelite prophets whose message purports to be the words of God. "Maimonides has rejected the idea of a God who speaks", and so he seeks to account for prophecy in a way that "excludes supernaturalism" (pp. 40-1). McKane describes and discusses his attempt to solve the problem. Ch. 3 first looks at William Fulke, an Anglican of the late 17th century, who 561</page></plain_text>
