<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME ASPECTS OF MODERN PHILOSOPHY ') by Herman Meyer (Enschede, Netherlands). ? 1. Modern philosophy is engaged in considering problems which science puts before the reflecting and contemplative mind. Such questions appear if the scientist reflects upon the fundamental assertions which he takes for granted, or upon the language he uses, or upon the end which he has in view. The questions we have in mind are sometimes said to appear on the border of science and philosophy. It seems more to the point to say that they appear on the border of the particular branches of science in a manner which it will be the business of this paper to explain, and we shall therefore often refer to them as border-problems. For each branch of science we may distinguish between theory and application, and the problems left for the philosopher to tackle differ according to whether they spring from theoretical or applied science. Scientific theory is governed by two things: first its means of discourse or language and second its fundamental concepts and assertions. Often scientific language developed into a special technique, particularly in the case of physical science and mathematics, where the scientist cannot go far without a considerable technical skill in handling his language. During the last half century it became more and more evident that scientific language gives rise to important philosophical questions. Technical developments always have a tendency to become independent, as if they come to a life of their own. This is true for the technical mastery of nature as well as for the technical mastery of scientific language. Inventions, once made, have a way of enfranchising them selves from their discoverer. Inventions may influence the well-being of humanity to an extent which the inventor never dreamed of. Scientific language may govern our way of thinking and our outlook on human activities without our being aware of it, so that we do not know up to which point such influence is justified. As a matter of fact our mental habits depend more than we realize upon the language we use. Scientific language is appropriate for a certain field of mental activity and is worse than useless outside that field. One of the objects of philosophical study of scientific language is to avoid the pitfall of *) Translation of a paper read at the first scientific meeting of the Dutch section of the International Association for Logic and the Philosophy of Science, 13 December 1947 at Utrecht (Holland). The writer did not overlook the importance of "existentialism" and the phaenomenological method advocated by Husserl, but in order to do justice to thse comparatively new philosophies at least another paper of the same size as the present one would be required. So it was thought more proper to drop treatment of them altogether. For discussion see notes. 338</page><page sequence="2">using a certain type of that language outside its legitimate domain. Fundamental concepts and assertions which scientists constantly use as a matter of course incite philosophical reflection in quite a different manner. We may ask, how it is that theory corresponds in good approximation with practice. Or, to put it the other way round: why does nature behave herself in accordance with theoretical predict ions? Once caught in these knotty questions, philosophical problems are bound to arise, and it becomes necessary to account for the exact meaning of the fundamental concepts and assertions used in science. So far we have considered only border-problems following from scientific theory, i.e. from an arrangement of experiential facts in series of causes and effects in a provisionally satisfactory manner. Applied science gives rise to border-questions of still another nature. Every applied science demands arrangement of experiential facts as means and ends. The physical or biological experimenter starts his work with a certain objective in view: to put a definite question to nature. He looks for the best arrangement or conditions in order to elicit an answer from nature which is clear and unequivocal. Apart from this every branch of science has a far wider influence on human society than developing our knowledge in that particular field. Science for science's sake is all fine and good, butt we should never forget that science may thrive either to the advaiitage or to the undoing of mankind. The tension between unmitigated scientific interest and the joy of the discoverer on the one hand and the scientist's inevitable responsibility as a member of human society on the other, is more than ever before the subject of philosophical discussions. So there are three kinds of philosophical problems: those that take their origin from the study of language, those which are connected with the fundamental scientific concepts and those which follow from the social consequences of scientific investigation. We may summarize this introduction by the following statement: In the field of science and art the scientist or the artist are at work without giving much thought to other things than learning and improving all the tricks of the trade, so that by means of these they may contribute to science or art by creative work or at least by gathering more facts. This is true even of logic: while a logician is at his calculus he does not philosophize. Many find satisfaction in scientific or artistic work of this sort. Some, of a more sophisticated mind, wonder at the remarkable properties of their means of discourse. They refuse to take it for granted that their theoretical calculations are applicable to nature. They are oppressed by their social respons ibility. In such a frame of mind it may happen that they are looking for a point of view from where to embrace all science or all art 339</page><page sequence="3">into a higher unity of laws and norms. Then they have turned into philosophers. ? 2. Once upon a time men did not come to philosophy in this way. General concepts; which had been formed in all sorts of manners, were analysed again and again to see what could be derived from them. These general concepts took their origin from almost every where, except from science as we now understand this word. This could hardly happen otherwise. For the first philosophical curiosity was concerned with human destiny and the second with the world around him. That the notions of reward and punishment precede that of causality is really in the natural course of things. Generally speaking: representations taken from human activity and related to man helped to form his ideas about nature. We shall see that this way of philo sophizing continues up to the present time and it constitutes the dis tinctive difference between what I shall call old and new philosophy. One of the consequences of the preponderant place, which man took in old philosophy, was that philosophers clung to ancient texts. We can let either men or facts speak for themselves. New philosophy does the latter and old philosophy the former. And if among the people that wrote down their opinions, some were considered particularly venerable, philosophers were prone to forget the wisdom of the words: Trust blindly to no fav'rite pen, Remembering authors are but men. Caught in the habit of swearing by ancient texts, great courage is required to free oneself of it and we must therefore admire as a heroic deed the work of Francis Bacon of Verulum, who in the sixteenth century for the first time forcefully defended the position to let the facts, and these only, be our guide in science and in the philosophy we build on science. ? 3. Before citing some examples to show how the new way worked in modern philosophy, we first look at the question how the so called philosophy of Being compares with it. Is it not turning away from human representations, when philosophers seek to know the "principles of Being as Being", according to the description given by Aristotle in the fourth book of Metaphysics? The scope of this lecture, where we are mainly concerned with modern philosophy, does not permit to distinguish between the various schools of Greek thought. It is a common feature of Greek philosophers that they ascribe some sort of metaphysical existence to all kinds of "universals" and "essentials", empirical and ideal.2) The latter may be valued higher than the former or the reverse, 2) The terms "universals" and "essentials" are used here in the same sense as in B. Russell's "History of Western Philosophy" 1946, chapter XIX. 340</page><page sequence="4">that is to say one may attach more importance to "essential" qualities of observable things than to "ideas" which are said to serve as their prototype, or the reverse; in any case the "essentials" which are expressed by "is" as a copula exist just as well as the "universals" expressed by "is" as a verb. Now, wherever Greek philosophers looked for the principles of Being, they invariably used representations related to man to account for what we may call for short "principles of nature". The Ionians took in turn water, air and the undeterminate infinite as the principle of nature. None of these are founded on observation in the sense of well devised experiments. The first and the second are naive generalisations of rather obvious representations taken from sense-experience. The third is less naive, for it is in a way the acknow ledgement that such generalisations are insufficient. One step further and we see that this acknowledgement turns into a philosophy of change and development, as it becomes clear that the form-less, in determinate, in-finite are nothing but negative concepts which cannot account for the positive content of experience, showing us a variety of changes of place, shape and properties like color, firmness, heat and so forth. Nor do these negative concepts explain the variegated and inventive nimbleness of our mental life. In his philosophy of change Heraclitus puts the very human idea of a never ending strife between contradicting properties in the forefront. All these explanations are in the first place generalisations of human representations and therefore they humanize nature. There is however a section of philosophy of being where the human element in the principles of nature is less obvious, but still clearly discernible. This is the philosophy Which identifies thought and being, in order to explain how man arrives at detecting law and order in the world around us, which shows us nothing but fleeting change. This iden tification is the more surprising because the world around us seems entirely separated and different from our mental life. Still this philo sophy explaining nature and thought out of a common principle, which was started by Parmenides, managed to keep alive in some form or another for more than 2400 years and it counts among its champions some of the greatest names in the history of human thought. Thinking is supposed to be a specifically human mental activity, which goes far beyond anything animals can do. To be fair we should bear in mind that at the dawn of philosophy it made a tremendous impression that man is able to produce in his mind something akin to law and order out of the confusion of our sense-perceptions. This consdousness of regularity and the means of communicating it to others did not, to all appearance, exist in the animal mind.3) It is therefore the acme a) How cautious we should be to make bold statements of this kind is proved by recent observations on bees, who have developed an amazing 341</page><page sequence="5">of extending a human principle to nature, if the principle of Being is identified with the principle of our consciousness of regularity. By doing this man is more than ever made the measure of all things. ? 4. Yet there are in Antiquity men whose thoughts moved into an other direction, approaching modern ideas. If we let the facts speak for themselves, we find that their language consists of numbers and measures. Those who discovered the connection between the length of a string and the pitch of the tone it produces must have measured and observed; such a thing cannot be found by reasoning. Whether the Pythagoreans or some earlier experimenter made this discovery is of less importance than the survival of the spirit from which it was born, long after Pythagoras had become a mythical figure. E.g. in Aristarchus of Samos, who, as is well known, let the earth and the planets turn round the sun, but who also devised a method of measuring the distance from the earth to the moon. And then, of course, there is Archimedes, the greatest of all known ancient scientists. Why Greek philosophy did not follow up the border-problems deriving from experimental physical science and astronomical obser vations and turned to pure reason instead, is a fascinating story bound up with the names of Socrates, Plato and Aristotle. For our purpose Aristotle is perhaps the most interesting of the three, because of his wide historical influence, and also because he developed something which he took for genuine physical science. For him everything grew or changed for the sake of some end, and this led him to introduce into the whole of nature what we commonly call a purpose. This is a typic ally human conception and by applying it to the external world as a whole, he thought of the principles of nature as analogous to human activity. In an artefact we see a human purpose realized in the shape of a tool or an institution which did not exist before. Hotuo faber, toolmaking man, imagines an inventor of objectives and plans, according to which organisms are created. Nobody ever observed such an inventor in the same way as one can observe oneself to take an objective in mind, to devise a plan for its execution and to use one's hand to realize the plan with the help of some material at one's disposal. It is one thing to extend this observation to living organisms, but it is quite a different matter to maintain that changes in lifeless nature happen along similar lines. In this way Aristotle arrives at a conceptual structure, which had its key-stone in the idea of a prime mover.*4). system of making kown to their fellows the variety, the distance from the hive and the direction of food. See K. von Frisch: "Die "Sprache" der Bienen etc.", Experientia Vol. II, 15 Oct. 1946. 4) Professor van Meisen argued, that while condemming the philosophy of Being, I advanced one of my own in the following sections. To this remark I opposed the view that nothing was further from my mind than to consider modern philosophy as a philosophy of Being. Though the subject of the 342</page><page sequence="6">? 5. The main lines of thought developed in any philosophy of Being are all pre-designed in Greek antiquity and it is therefore of little use for our present purpose to follow them up until more recent times. We prefer to show by means of a few examples, which position modern philosophers take when confronted with philosophical problems and in which manner they differ from their ancient predecessors and from those who follow in their wake. In order not to lose sight of the threads which are woven into the garment of modern philosophy it is desirable to distinguish between two main subjects. The customary distinction between natural sciences and sciences of the mind is not very hulpful here, because philosophy itself belongs to the latter. We therefore shall make a distinction according to the subject-matter, namely first in so far as our search of knowledge is concerned with nature and her laws and second in so far as it is devoted to man and his well-being. It would perhaps seem obvious to combine the know ledge of man with that of all living beings, but now-a-days biology uses extensively all sorts of physical and chemical notions, so that such a combination would not clearly separate the two subjects. Anthro pology has some peculiar traits which are useful here, although we shall in one place transgress into the field of general biology. It is furthermore hardly necessary to point out that we have chosen more or less at random some instances which serve to illustrate the foregoing arguments, in order to lift our view from the sphere of generalities into the precisely determined field of particular facts. Even so we cannot fully discuss the examples. ? 6. Let us start with inanimate nature. The border-problems which arise if we begin to wonder why physical theories can be interpreted as predictions have grown in number since the inception of quantum mechanics and they all have philosophical aspects. Probability and the incertainty-relations formulated by Heisenberg; simultaneity and its connection with time and movement; the principle of the constancy of the quantity of energy in connection with entropy and so on. These ques tions are all specific for the latest developments of physical science and it is therefore not easy to compare them with earlier and earliest ideas. paper dit not permit to disclose my, views on epistemology, yet it is clear that a philosophy which depends for its problems upon the actual state of science cannot claim for its outcome to be fixed and immutable as Aristotle claims for the philosophy of Being he is in search of. Professor Freudenthal argued that there is not a clear cut breach in the development of physics and mathematics, to which professor Clay opposed that the method of Galilei radically differed from that of scholastic physical science. My answer to Professor Freudenthal was, that I was not concerned with the history of physical science, which may or may not show a certain continuity, but with the way in which philosophy now comes to its problems compared with the older approach to philosophical questions. 343</page><page sequence="7">We therefore choose a different subject, namely how we can distinguish the smallest particles from which we imagine matter to be built up. We lay stress on being distinguishable and we shall not enter into the representation of "smallest particle". To-day our conceptual formulation of the latter far outruns any representation as a visual or palpable entity and has nothing in common with the rather crude ideas of Greek atomists about very small grains of irregular shape. It is however important that the principle which accounts for the identity of a thing, in this case a particle, the so called principium individuationis, has completely changed since the days of ancient and mediaeval philosophy. At that time the fundamental question was not: "How do we ascertain the identity of a thing in the course of time?", but: "What is the essence of a thing which remains identically the same?" The "essence" stood for just that relation to Being which some flight of pure reason was expected to procure. The One and the Many as subject of metaphysics, that is the question of a philosophy of Being in connection with the individuality of a thing. For, it was argued, in order to understand nature as manifold, we must first know what is the essence of the individual thing. But the conception of Being did not give any clue to the One and the Many and so this metaphysical problem has never been solved. As far as I know Leibniz was the first to make an entirely different approach. He linked the individuality of a thing up with the physical prediction of its future state. We can render his ideas on the subject as follows: If I measure the change of some property of a thing, e.g. its quantity of movement at a definite place and moment, I can insert the result of this observation into a physical relation (or law) governing this change. I can then predict the future state of the thing, e.g. its time and place, as the outcome of a calculation. If the prediction holds, i.e. if I do observe the thing as predicted, I thereby define its individuality. I then say: this is the same thing as that on which I made my first measurement.?) It is remarkable that Leibniz, who in this way treated the concept of individuality in quite a modern manner, also stuck to the old way of discussing the problem of individuality. But we should not forget that Leibniz lived in two worlds, at the beginning of new ideas represented by Galilei and Newton and at the end of scholastic-Aristotelian conception s) "Potissimus realitatis phaenomenorum indicium, quod vel solum suf ficit, est successus praedicendi phenomena futura ex praeteritis et praesentibus, sive illa praedictio in ratione aut hypothesi hactenus succedente, sive in con suetudine hactenus observata fundetur" etc. "Die philosophischen Schriften von G. W. Leibniz", uitg. C. J. Gerhardt 1875?1890, deel VII, p. 320. "En elders: Legern quandam esse persistentem, id est quae involvat futuros eius quod ut idem concipimus status, id Ipsum est quod substantiam eandem constitutere dico". Brief aan Voider 21.1.1704. Beide plaatsen vond ik vermeld in geschriften van H. Scholz. 344</page><page sequence="8">of nature. In his "Nouveaux Essais sur l'Entendement humain" he argues that in order to know a thing so that we can distinguish it from any other, we must know an infinite number of properties.6) This is in agreement with the old theory of the content and the extension of a concept. The content is smaller if the extension becomes larger, i.e. if more individuals fall under a concept it says less about specific proper ties. On the other hand the content is larger if the extension becomes smaller, i.e. a concept has to include more properties, the fewer indivi duals fall under it. In the extreme case of only one individual the concept has to include all imaginable properties. In occordance with his meta physical ideas Leibniz was therefore lead to posit the existence of "monads", each of which reflects all the properties in the world from its "point of view". Here again we see the anthropomorphic side of the old philosophy and this impression is confirmed if we read Ch. XXVII of the "Nouveaux Essais''. This chapter, entitled: "Ce que c'est qu'Identit? ou Diversit?" treats among other things of the "personal identity" (? 9) and defends the conception of "Monads". As a logician Leibniz might have reasoned that an all embracing determination coincides with the indeterminate of the old Ionians, and he would then have reverted to the scholastic-Aristotelian idea that ^determined matter (materia prinr$a) is the principium individuationis. Now we understand the flaw in the reasoning as a consequence of incorrect use of language connected with the word "all" and may therefore dismiss this version as spurious. Leibniz's definition of the individuality of a thing as defined by a physical prediction which holds true, involves other difficulties, as we shall presently see, but it has the great merit of breaking with the old method of stating general concepts about the world around us without regard to experience. In his definition, Leibniz is no longer concerned with what some venerable authority found out by pure reason and contemplation, but with the answer which a physical experiment gives to the question: "How do we know a thing to remain identically the same in some definite respect2'? 7) This definition of the identity of a thing is nothing but an abstract framework in which we place the experiment. We have to wait and see whether the experiment gives us an answer which fits into this e) Op.c. Livre III, ? 6: ".l'individualit? enveloppe l'infini, et il n'y a celui, qui est capable de le comprendre qui puisse avoir la connaissance du principe d'individuation d'une telle ou telle chose". 7) It was argued both by Professor Preudenthal and Professor van Meisen, that the Greek philosophers and the scholastics did reason from ex perience and not at random. This however does not" save the position in comparison with Leibniz's definition. For according to this definition it is feasible to insert the results of the first experiment in any mathematical function set up as a physical law. In the same way it is possible to start from some well established observation and reason on that foundation without 345</page><page sequence="9">framework. If it does not, ? worse still, if the experiment shows that we can strictly deny the possibility of a well founded physical prediction, our definition will be of no avail. Now that is what happened when the experiment was made to determine at the same time the exact place and the quantity of movement of a particle. The phaenomena we observe when a sheaf of fast moving electrons pass through a narrow aperture and fall on a photographic plate at a suitable distance behind the aperture, has reopened the debate on the individuality of particles. These observations give rise to the surmise that the electronic rays interfere and are refracted just like light. The means of discourse of which physical science disposes are of such a nature that the laws governing interference and refraction take the shape of mathematical equations representing waves, whereas in the case of collisions other equations are used, derived from point-mechanics, with corrections in accordance with the theory of general relativity. The "particles of matter", electrons, protons etc. cannot therefore be imagined as things or objects in the ordinary sense. This is a particularly in structive example how scientific language determines the interpretation we attach to physical laws, for if we could express interference and refraction of electrons in a manner not connected with wave-equations, we should certainly not represent ?electrons as "waves". As it is Niels Bohr was lead to his principle of complementarity, Which is pure philo sophy of natural science. The peculiarity of scientific language referred to just now, gives rise to the logical problem, how the rules of inference should be formulated in case we want to draw conclusions from ob servations in the field of wave-phaenomena to those in the field of point mechanics and vice-versa. Mme. Paulette Destouches-F?vrier devoted some remarkable studies to this subject. Here we have a typical example of modern philosophy. The facts speak for themselves and the fundamental problems they give rise to are considered by philosophy. Faced with the interference of electronic rays it is impossible to answer the question about the identity of a particle in a simple and unequivocal manner. We could make this clear by means of the concept of probability, but for our purpose it is perhaps more striking to use a simple illustration. a flaw, just as the mathematical operation on the result of the first experiment may be quite correct. But Leibniz requires that the result of this operation is confirmed by a second experiment. Likewise we may ask that the result of applying pure reason to experience must be confirmed by further evidence. On top of that we may ask that counter experiments refuting the results of the reasoning or mathematical operation are devised and as long as these fail to produce a refutation we may accept the knowledge disclosed by pure reason if it is corroborated by experience. That is why I called a scientific theory a provisionally satisfactory arrangement of facts in series of causes and effects, Cf. K. R. Popper: ?Logik der Forschung" 1935. 346</page><page sequence="10">As we said before the phenomena referred to are expressed by means of wave-equations. This leads to the hypothesis that moving elecIrons (and indeed every moving object) are accompanied by a group of waves the amplitude of which cancel each other out, with the exception of a narrow interval. This interval we can denote as the centre of energy of the group of waves.8) Now let us imagine a kindergarten in which a row of swings are erected. The childern swinging there do not keep time like soldiers marching, but swing irregularly. We further imagine the planes in which the swings move orientated, that is we distinguish between a negative and positive direction (clockwise and anti-clockwise) and we multiply the kinetic energy of each swing by the negative or positive unit according to the direction in which it swings at a certain moment to. Then the algebraic sum of all the kinetic energies at that moment t0 will tend to zero if there are enough swings. If however a number of children near to each other keep time, then the addition of their kinetic energies will not be zero. Suppose that at a later moment ti other children keep time. If we can teach the children in such a way that two children keep time at a certain moment during say two seconds, next an adjacent pair of children during the same interval, and so on, then the centre of energy of all the swings, which is repres ented by the finite value referred to, moves along the row of swings at a definite speed. But if. a complete stranger comes into the kinder garten to observe how well the children are trained, the little folk will as likely as not forget discipline and will not keep time as they were, taught. In other words the phaenomenon will be disturbed by obser vation ! And children being what they are this cannot be avoided. Something very similair happens in the case of moving particles. We can write down mathematical relations representing waves accom panying these particles in such a way that the centre of energy of these waves moves with a velocity equal to the mechanical speed of the particle. But if we want to observe the moving particle to check the equation we find that the phaenomenon is disturbed by our obser vation. For that reason there is no way of determining how the system of moving particles would behave unobserved and it is impossible to ascertain where one particular particle is located at the beginning and at the end of the experiment. So Leibniz's definition of individuality does not help us and we must try to find another definition suitable for the occasion. Tentative definitions will show that the concepts 8) This hypothesis first advanced by L. de Broglie, has since been dropped because the centre of energy is not stable on account of the dispersion following from the equations used to express the hypothesis. Cf A. Haas op.cit. ch. II and Charles Piatrier, op.cit. ? 18.?. For our purpose it is superfluous) to dwell on this technicality. 347</page><page sequence="11">of "thing" or "object" need revision and that, in atomic physical science, we cannot talk sense unless we describe a group of particles and their properties. Furthermore the notion of objectivity has only relative value on the atomic scale, for we cannot express the state of a system of particles by means of a determined physical quantity, in dependent from the state of the observer. The outcome of measurements on the system depends upon the disposition prearranged by the observer and will differ according to his aim, because he cannot at the same time measure the location and the quantity of movement. This means that an element of subjectivity enters into the field of physical science. It follows that he cannot draw any conclusions from his experiments as to Being. Neither can he do anything of the sort in connection with ob servations in daily life, i.e. with "experiments" on a much lager scale than atoms and electrons. For such inferences are relativized, because they depend upon the scale of magnitude and upon the choice of the measuring instruments by the observer.9) We find here a typical opposition between the old way of philoso phy and the new one. The extension of abstract reasoning and of fundamental concepts into fields, where they make no sense, is refuted by means of the Baconian prescription: Let the experiment speak ! From the experiment alone we can learn something about nature and even so notning more than is related to the domain which the experi ment covers. Therefore we should always pay attention to extra polation of knowledge derived from experiments into fields for which the experiment was not intended. The relative value of our knowledge e) The whole difference between classical and quantum-mechanics, which is the same as the difference between observations on a relatively large scale and those on atomic scale, is reduced to the so-called "principle of subjectivity" by Professor and Mme. Destouches-F?vrier in their paper referred to at the end as follows: "Principe de subjectivit?: Les r?sultats de mesures ne peuvent ?tre con sid?r?s comme des propri?t?s intrins?ques des syst?mes observ?s (ou, ce qui est ?quivalent, il n'existe pas de grandeur d'?tat)". The discussion following the lecture about objectivity and subjectivity in physical science centred around two different ideas. Professor Clay, while admitting the facts of the case, did not lose all hope that one day objectivity would be restored so as to exclude all personal elements from the results of measurements and the physical laws which govern atomic phaenomena. This elimination of the observer, he remarked, was just what had happened in physical science since the Renaissance and without having any idea of the way out of our present difficulties he stressed the importance of the old saying "Never say never" in view of the most unexpected recent discoveries in this field. ? In accordance with these remarks I may add here that the interdependence of scientific language and our interpretation of physical laws, which I stressed in this section, does not preclude the possibility of 'different conceptions with the progress of science. If these laws and inter pretations were relevant for a philosophy of Being, they would be immutable as Being. A striking elucidation of the controversy was presented by a remark from ir. R. Vermeulen in connection with a view expressed by Professor E. W. 348</page><page sequence="12">is prohibitive for fancy-flights from experience into the lofty regions of Being. Even the concepts of "thing" and "object" and the time honoured corner-stones of old philosophy: the relation subject-object and subject-predicate have to be thoroughly overhauled and are being relativized to a degree of which our forefathers, who never experimented on atomic scale, could not have dreamed. ? 7. Scientific language gives rise to border-problems of its own. This is the case with mathematics and logic as linguistic phaenomena. As long as philosophy identifying thinking and Being in any shape or form, held the field, there was no other border-question than the accordance between language as a vehicle of thought and Being to which thought was related. The modern point of view starts from the idea that language is a separate subject-matter for scientific investigation and furthermore that logic and mathematics are concerned with linguistic rules. Even if mathematics are conceived as private acts of mathematical con struction, communication of those acts has to made by means of language; perhaps not quite adequately but still in the form of mathe matical symbolism, the linguistic rules of which are to be laid down to make the symbolism comprehensible to others. Matters are complicated by the fact that mathematics do not treat of relations between measurable qualities like physical science, but of things peculiar to mathematics, namely numbers and their properties, or operations we can perform on numbers. A border-question of a philosophical nature is therefore, how it can be explained that mathe Beth. The latter said that the system consisting of the observed phaenomenon and the measuring apparatus, which could be self-registering, form a self contained whole, in which certain facts occur, the outcome of which can be read afterwards by any observer from the instruments. He therefore maintained that the terms "objectivity" and "subjectivity" are not very suitably chosen in connection with atomic physical science. Ir. Vermeulen gave the clue to answering this objection by pointing out that before the general theory of relativity was developed, the state of movement of the observer could, in certain cases, not be excluded when formulating physical laws. The main purpose of that theory was to enable scientists to formulate their laws in the cases referred to in such a way that the state of movement of the observer did no longer enter into the formulae; this is the significance of the laws of relativity being invariant with regard to uniform and accelerated motion. The present phase of atomic science does not permit to formulate laws which are ? invariant with regard to the choice of the observer as to location or quantity of movement of the particle to be observed. Professor van Meisen led the discussion about objectivity in another di rection by remarking that the fact, that the experiments had shown that in certain cases Leibniz's definition is unsuitable, in itself constitutes an objective statement about nature. To this I answered that Professor van Meisen used the term "objective" in an entirely different sense, which has nothing to do with the way in which it occurs in the study of Professor and Mme. Destouchea P?vrier. Professor van Melsen's usage of objectivity belongs to the range of epistemological concepts, which are of keen philosophical interest but could not very well be discussed within the scope of the present paper. 349</page><page sequence="13">matics as a language treating of mathematical objects, can also be utilized for expressing physical relations. Another complication arises if we pause to think that the inferences we make in mathematics are founded upon rules governing the use of the symbolism and not upon the nature of mathematical objects. The rules we actually apply when making inferences can be expressed by means of a special language we calL logic. The connection between the language of mathematics and the language of logic is a philosophical issue of the first magnitude. Not mathematics, not logic as branches of science, but the border questions which arise when we try to link up these two sciences, are of philosophical interest. In order to tackle these problems we must know the linguistic rules and try to understand the nature of the objects which the languages express. That is the reason why symbolic logic and the foundations of mathematics occupy the centre of the stage in modern philosophy. The more so, because the solution of these problems furnishes at the same time the foundation for a theory of knowledge. In other words: our answer to the question how mathe matics and logic are connected is decisive for our attitude towards the connection between knowledge and reality, if we take knowledge to mean a system of communicable and controllable statements. (Con trollable by means of measuring, weighing or counting). ? 8. The following example will be useful to show the exact nature of the problems and the advantage of the method described in elaborating philosophical issues. Deriving conclusions from certain premises is very important in physical science and mathematics. Obviously logic, which describes the linguistic rules of these sciences should treat of derivation. This part of logic is commonly called the theory of formal or deductive inference. Logic consists of signs the use of which are governed by certain rules. By agreeing on a sign for the expression "deriving conclusions from dertain premises" and developing the rules of its use, it should be possible to produce a valuable part of the theory of deductive inference. Logically speaking, the sign for "deriving conclusions from certain premises" could only be meaningfully used in accordance with these rules. In fact K. R. Popper lately succeeded in building up not only a theory of deductive inference in this way, but also other parts of logic. The logical constants "and", "not", "or", "if_ then" are defined in such a way that in the definiens only the fundamental sign for "deriving conclusions from certain premises" occur, apart from signs for statement variables. Moreover the theory of statement-functions and the theory of substitution is developed in the same manner, the latter with the help of one new postulate.10) i?) Professor Beth remarked that others have worked on the same 350</page><page sequence="14">From a philosophical point of view this method has the big ad vantage that a theory of knowledge has only to analyse the significance of the one undefined sign, namely that for "deriving conclusions from certain premises". This is a semantical issue, i.e. it discusses the meaning of a logical sign not defined implicitely by the rules for using the sign within the framework of logical deduction. It is therefore clear why "scientific semantics", a young science developed in the last two decades by A. Tarski, R. Carnap and others, is of keen philosophical interest. Popper's method has further advantages. First we need not bother any more about the obscure meaning of "truth" and "falseness" of state ments, for these words do not appear at all in logic built up in this way. We no longer introduce "statements" as expressions about which we may ask reasonably whether they are true or false. Statements can now be defined as the field of the relation covered by the one undefined sign for "deriving conclusions from certain premises".X1) A second advantage concerns the theory of demonstration. Popper's method shows in a simple way the difference between logical proof and derivation. Logical proof being valid for any set of statement-variables, whether they stand for "true" or "false" statements. Philosophically more interesting is the fact that this development of logic makes plain the importance of having a criterion for deciding whether a sign is to be called "logical sign". If not it is a name for statement-variables. Logical signs govern the logical form and are there fore very appropriately named formative signs and logic really consists of nothing else besides the proper handling of formative signs. Non logical signs are called descriptive and according to Popper it is some times open to doubt whether a sign is formative or descriptive, e.g. the sign for "identity". In my opinion the distinction between formative and descriptive signs can always be conclusively made, albeit by other means than employed by Popper, namely with the help of the concept of "negation of exclusion", of which we shall presently say a few words. Here we wish to stress the fact that modern philosophy gets its problems by scrutinizing scientific language and looking for concepts which are not defined within the framework of that language. problem, e.g. O. K. Nikodym, who read a paper about it at the Brussels congress of the "Institut International des Sciences th?oriques" in September last. I have not seen the writings of this Polish logician nor do I know of anybode else who published a fully developed theory of deductive inference, starting from the one undefined sign for derivation, besides Mr. Popper, whose paper referred to appeared on May 5th 1947, see list of literature. 11) This was pointed out to me in a letter from Mr. Popper in reply to my objection that he still needed the concepts of truth and falseness besides his one undefined sign. In fact the tables introduced by Schr?der, using "truth values" for characterizing logical constants, are dispensed with, the advantage of of which will be clear in connection with the problem raised in my paper listed at the end. 351</page><page sequence="15">19. We shall not discuss here the foundations of mathematics, which are not defined within the framework of that language. bij L. E. J. Brouwer and his school. The philosophical problems con nected with the foundations of mathematics are not linguistic, but touch the concept of mathematical object. The philosophy of logic and mathe matics deriving from linguistic problems can be isolated properly if we let the facts speak for themselves. The facts are in this case linguistic formations. But logical empiricism goes too far when asserting that all that is worth knowing can be derived from the study of language. Our example in section 6 ?hows that there is plenty of work for the philo sopher to do outside the domain of linguistics. And the foregoing section points to border-problems of philosophical interest inside linguistics, namely those connected with terms which can not be defined within the language studied. The reason for this, perhaps somewhat surprising fact can be understood if we conceive "language" as our "universe of inter course". Intercourse is a fourfold relation: we speak of intercourse by means of signs (language) between two persons about something. The difference between old and new philosophy, so far as it is con cerned with our universe of intercourse, can now be formulated as fol lows: Formerly the starting point was that about which two persons were supposed to be talking and from there the philosopher proceeded to linguistic rules. Now we first study the linguistic rules in order to make sure what two persons can talk about and still talk sense ! Along tiie old road of approach it "was rather obvious to use collo quial language as the subject matter of linguistic investigation. For that language is made for natural intercourse between human beings. The incidental construction of the indo-german group of languages, namely the subject-praedieate relation, was erroneously looked upon as the essence of every language, every means of human intercourse. And by identifying Being and Thinking philosophers arrived at the analogon of the subject-praedicate construction as existing independently of human intercourse. That is the origin of the theory of substances and substantial forms. It is fair to admit that this course of events could hardly be avoided, although there are traces of a different development, even in Greek Antiquity (Antisthenes). Investigating language as a separate and peculiar phaenomenon, without regard to whatever we wish to express by it, seems a roundabout approach to linguistic questions, and we need not wonder that the old track was not abandoned before many and serious derailments had occurred. ? 10. Science related to man covers at least as wide a field as physical science and if we should survey the philosophical questions arising from anthropology our paper would swell to the size of a book. The outcome of the foregoing section allows us to condense our inves 352</page><page sequence="16">tigation about the source of philosophical issues of anthropology Jnto examining the language peculiar to that science. In so far as anthro pology coincides with biology, using physico-chemical methods, every thing we said before about philosophy of natural science is valid. Anthro pology, however, also raises questions, which cannot be approached by the methods of natural science, namely those which concern teleology, i.e. means and ends. To solve such issues we do not derive conclusions from certain premises, but we appreciate various means which can serve to reach a certain goal. Truth or falseness have nothing to do with ap preciation of means to an end. When weighing one against the other we are after the "golden mean", either for reconciling clashing interests, or for finding the most just course of action, or for hitting upon the most suitable devise or institution. In other words: physical science asks for extrema in the mathematical sense, teleology looks for optima. Physical science has to solve equations under certain specific conditions. In matters of teleology we want to know, which target we may properly set, considering the means we have at our disposal. Knowledge of causes aud effects are of course indispensible for finding the means to the end and for that reason we have to arrange our factual experience both as means and ends and in series of causes and effects. The technical sciences, devising the best ways to produce machines, tools and consumers' goods, offer a good example. A description of the hot-air engine recently developed by the Philips factories (Eindhoven, Holland), shows that the aim set is to get the highest capacity per unit of piston-displacement and per unit of weight. This is the over-all op timum, to which the thermal and mechanical means are subordinate. But each of these means is in itself an optimum. E.g. the devise to ab sorb the remaining heat-energy of the air in the expansion-chamber with the greatest speed, and to deliver that energy with the smallest possible loss and very quickly to the air that flows back from the compression-chamber to the expansion-chamber. To this optimum the best form of the most suitable metal at the most advantageous place is subordinate as means. The language of the technician abounds with degrees of comparison. But in order to determine which means are at the technician's disposal, knowledge of the theory of physical science is indispensable. In economics the situation is the same. A frequently used optimum is the attainment of a business life which is running as smoothly and with the fewest possible disruptions as is compatible with the needs of a growing society and the use of the latest technical discoveries. This is merely another way of saying that most economists aim at sup pressing widely fluctuating trade cycles because of the accompanying evil that great masses of labourers are thrown out of work. To find the 353</page><page sequence="17">means to that end, knowledge of theoretical economy is necessary and the branch of that science studying the relations between changes of economic quantities or values claims to be able to arrange economic facts in series of causes and effects. Individual psychology aims at peace of mind for the much harried individual. To fulfil the task life sets for each of us with the least possible disturbance of the mind is the optimum which individual psychology will help us to reach. In mass-psychology the aim may be either of the following pair: to mitigate the influences of hollow slogans on the masses, and so to pour oil on turbulent waters; or to stir up the masses by well timed and skilfully chosen arguments in order to lord it over them, the classical example of which can be found in Marc Anthony's Forum speech. This example shows that we cannot intelligently choose the means as long as the end is not known, because optima bearing on the same set of facts may be flatly contradictory. Optima are always founded on a choice: not this, but that. It is the merit of our compatriot G. Mannoury, of having put the twofold aspect of negation in its true light. Negation may be the outcome of a choice, or it may be founded on an exclusion. In the first case we always choose from a restricted number of more or less attractive alternatives, reiecting all but one. Negation by exclusion puts aside an indeterminate open set of praedicates, thereby mentally isolating one definite praedicate. Negation by exclusion is the epistomogical foundation of two-valued logic, negation by choice that of the logic of appreciation. Unfortunately the logic of appreciation is as yet hardly dev3lopeJ Weighing means against each other in order to reach a certain goal is the opposite number of deriving conclusions from certain premises. If we could build up a logic of appreciation starting from a single undefined sign for "weighing means against each other in order to reach a certain goal" in the same way as we explained above in connection with deriva tion, much useless and fruitless debating would be avoided. This logic of appreciation would at the same time be a powerful weapon against transgression into fields for which it is not intended. It would soon become clear that no intercourse about means to an end can be pursued unless we first agree about the end in view. Or, what amounts to the same thing, that we cannot wildly impute plans or aims to the animate or inanimate world, unless we can tell how they are chosen and by what means they could be realized. This insight would be a great gain, for it pricks the bubble of much teleological reasoning about life. From experience we can learn that much in the living world could be "explained" by assuming that a plan is realized or an aim pur sued. But then we cannot say there is a choice in nature, nor is there any weighing of means against each other. And also the counter example is easily at hand, because much in living nature occurs either 354</page><page sequence="18">without any plan or aim, however wildly surmised, or else is flatly contradictory to the popular conception (or misconception) of nature's planning: to provide the individual with the means of surviving or even of improving the individual and the sort. Simply by studying the scientific language we can expose many long drawn out philosophical battles in the field of teleology applied to life, as being directed against windmills. Unless of course we outline yet another logic leaving no loophole for transgression into different fields of scientific investigation, and fulfilling the requirements of corroborating evidence and eventual refutation.
