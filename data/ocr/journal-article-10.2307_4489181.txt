<plain_text><page sequence="1">ERIC HAYOT Immigrating Fictions: Unfailing Mediation in Dict6e and Becoming Madame Mao * 1 * She originality of the Brechtian sign, Roland Barthes once said, comes from its always being read twice. "What Brecht gives us to read," Barthes wrote in 1975, "is, via a kind of disconnect, the look of a reader, not the object of that look; that object only reaches us through the intellectual (alien- ated) act of a first reader who is already on stage" ("Brecht" 265; my translation). Barthes meant that objects on the Brechtian stage never appear on stage as themselves. They are instead objects-facts, things, people, situations-as someone has perceived them, ele- ments of a story told by an actor who performs a relation to the objects of his regard that subjects them, in advance, to reading. From the edge of the proscenium, the audience sees the reading, not the objects, and sees simultaneously the possibility of reading the objects otherwise. The Brechtian theater thus shows that an object is always someone's object, that any given thing, person, or situation has already emerged, prior to any single perception of it, as the "reading" of someone else whose first reading was simply to make this object the object of a look, thereby differentiating it from the seamless fabric of the real. Like the Brechtian sign, a translated text appears before its audi- ence only after passing through the alienated act of a first reader. There it testifies to the awkward and complex relationship between author and translator, between the translation that appears and the I am grateful to Christopher Bush, Haun Saussy, and Steve Yao, who commented on ear- lier versions of this essay, and to Rebecca Walkowitz, whose suggestions substantially improved its final form.

The lat- ter's existence and status as origin can be adequately testified to only by the translator who brings the text into its new linguistic home. For it is the translator who assures readers of the translation that, yes, there exists abroad some text very much like this one, some original to which they could return in order to verify this translation. And yet the translator, like an actor, has a strange rela- tionship to the signs whose passage he or she transmits. There must have been a moment at which she thought, not simply, I like this book, but also, I want this book to be translated so that other people will like it. To translate is in this sense always to do something for someone else, or for something else, namely the text. But the sad paradox of translation is that the act of birthing the text into a new space will, by rewriting its language, murder the very thing that made it what it was in the first place. Or at least murder it enough, so that it emerges on the other side of the translation through the "act of a first reader." Just as the Brechtian sign figures translation, translation can fig- ure the Brechtian theater, where the violence done to the sign can be read more broadly as a violence done to traditional notions of char- acter and identification: Brecht's stage, by making its intermediaries visible, hoped to keep its audiences from forgetting the fact of the translation, from imagining that what they saw up on stage were people and not actors. That in turn was supposed to keep them from seeing "people"-bourgeois constructs all-outside the theater, to keep them from seeing action as personality, so that they could rec- ognize it, quite simply, as acting. The politics that resulted would consist of the audience's seeing the world not as a neutral fact but as a translation, as a made thing produced by historical actors (human and nonhuman), some with interests in making us forget their role in the production. Because the translator as figure mediates a passing through or a crossing over, it resembles not so much an immigrant as the mediator-coyote or cargo ship, spouse or corporate sponsor, 1-129 visa or Alien Exclusion Act-that frames and establishes the circum- stances under which immigration occurs. "Immigrant fictions," if by the phrase one means translations or "world" literature in English, cross the path of a series of literary, capitalized intermediaries</page><page sequence="3">HAYOT e 603 (agents or publishers) who judge the texts, rework them, frame them for a new public, review them in the better newspapers, and thereby authorize and ground their presence in the metropole. In these cases, the mediator, like the translator, is supposed to disappear: what one gets in the moment of a translated immigrant fiction should be the authentic and immediate voice of an other, almost always an other allegorizing a national or ethnic location. But any peek behind the curtain of this frictionless fiction shows that the mediations leave their mark: the originality of the origin has been compromised; the immigrant fiction has been modified in the act of immigration. It's slightly more complicated if "immigrant" in "immigrant fictions" becomes possessive, meaning something like fictions of immigrants, belonging to or about immigrants. Here the category overlaps with that of ethnic American literature, especially those sub- sets devoted to the problems of racism, integration, and assimilation. Though such texts appear originally in English, their subject matter is the process of mediation itself, and their focus on literature by ethnic authors (as though white people were not also immigrants) is a mea- sure of the cultural roles played not only by ethnicity but also by fic- tion in the contemporary imagination. The classic ethnic American bildungsroman tends to be read as an autobiography, with the pro- tagonist standing in for the author. Here the fiction (rather than the act of translation) is the agent of transformation, and the movement it authorizes between person and protagonist, experience and lan- guage is an allegory of the movement of the ethnic subject him- or herself.' The ethnic American narrative manages an internal migra- tion, a movement from outside the space of a community or national recognition to its inside, mediated by the act of writing or, more for- mally, by fictionality and generic form. Caught up in its inevitable reception as an allegory for self- and national transformation, the fic- tion of ethnic American Bildung enacts the very transformation it rep- resents, mediating through fiction the fiction of self-transformation it 1. This insistent linkage between authors and autobiography may be culturally partic- ular to the United States. Laura Hyun Yi Kang proposes troubling the "alignment of 'America' and 'Autobiography,"' arguing that the "distinct autos of American autobiog- raphy may itself have to be socially and historically degraded" (63).</page><page sequence="4">604 * CONTEMPORARY LITE RATU.R E narrates.2 The dual and mutual translation that ensues-the ethnic subject bending toward 'America," the latter adjusting itself ever so slightly to the presence of the new actor on the scene-means that "America" and the self in question produce in their cohabitation the fiction of a resolution on both sides. Call that resolution, with one eye on Brecht, and the other on the INS, a naturalization. But some fictions know that story is just a fiction, is already a transformation, and so refuse (or can be seen to refuse) the consola- tions of that final crossing over, the definitive translation. What such fictions tell, like the translator's expert annotations, are never quite the origins they announce themselves to be; and the conclu- sions they reach, the meaning they finally give, never free them- selves enough from the mediation that makes it possible to imagine the ending they dream of. In such texts-call them immigrating fictions-the fiction, like the Brechtian actor, never renounces its claim on the process of the novel; like the customs officer, the liter- ary agent, and the coyote, it demands its cut in the transaction. Two of the major recent texts of Asian American prose suggest that the necessity of that cut in fiction can be understood both as an artifact of ethnic American fictional form and a feature of the literary land- scape of cosmopolitan, postcolonial modernity. .2* Theresa Hak Kyung Cha's Dictee "presents itself.., as a work of pas- sage from one language to another. Thus it deals thematically with the problem of translation, not in its putative symmetrical equivalence of the signification between two languages, but as the work of labor that is required to move from one language to another" (Sakai 26). That labor is visible from the text's first page, on which the physical 2. The classic theorization of the relationship between national literature and allegory is Fredric Jameson's in "Third World Literature in the Era of Multinational Capitalism." Jameson's use of "third world" later became the subject of a fairly intense critique by Aijaz Ahmad. But the general argument is recuperable, I think, without the term "third world" at all: American literary criticism's obsessive reading of all American literature as national allegory, for instance, can be thought of as an expression of postcolonial resis- tance to Empire, an anxiety about the growth of geopolitical dominance and the establish- ment of in-groups, and as a deep expression of geographic provincialism.</page><page sequence="5">HA YOT * 605 evidence of a French dictation exercise ("C'etait le premier jour point Elle venait de loin point ce soir au diner virgule...") appears directly above its own too-literal translation into English.3 Elsewhere the text incorpo- rates Korean Hangul, romanizations of Greek and Korean names, and Chinese characters, as well as photographs, maps, diagrams, and typed and handwritten documents. This collocation of sources gives the text the feel of an edited archive; the gathering of representations, organized in Dictee's case by a complex but unified narrative voice, aims to trace the voice's own immediate life experience (a childhood spent in French Catholic schools in Korea, a return to South Korea as an American citizen) as well as the international, postcolonial history of a nation-state whose place in the networks of historical and cultural imperialism makes it an unstable or impossible origin for that voice's identity. Caught between personal and historical selfhood, Dictde attempts, writes Shelley Sunn Wong, "a new figuration of the dialectic between individuation and ideological interpellation, one which would allow for human agency at the same time that it acknowledged the determinative force of external constraints and impositions" (118).4 Readers of Dictde have recognized that the book presents a shift- ing substrate of references whose status as potential origin (of subjectivity, of meaning) is always called into question by the possi- bility that the entire text is just another dictation. Naoki Sakai, for instance, argues that Dictee emerges from the combination of a desire to exist inside the intersubjective work of translation on one hand and the deep wish for a return to a mother tongue on the other. The text embraces its own fragmentation even as it expresses the desire for a definitive origin, but it ultimately "prefers" to remain 3. As Shelley Sunn Wong has noted, the first numbered page of the text (on which the dictation exercise appears) follows the book's proper "beginning," which includes a fron- tispiece containing a photograph of a Hangul inscription found in a tunnel in Nagano Prefecture, Matsushiro City, Japan (108). For more on the history of the inscription, which reads "Mother, I miss you, I'm hungry, I want to go home," see Kang 99n7. Lisa Lowe's reading of this section of the text is masterful (132-35). 4. Because so much of Dictde is poetry, because much of it seems to have been written under the literary influence of the French poststructuralism and feminism of the late 1970s (Cha studied briefly in Paris with Monique Wittig, and parts of Dictde resemble the latter's 1969 Les guerilleres), it lends itself especially well to sweeping statements about the instability of identity and political history. As I suggest in what follows, any such reading must account for the text's desire for and suspicion of those categories.</page><page sequence="6">606 * CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE outside either of these solutions.5 The text's feminism, Wong writes, likewise rejects the solace of origins despite its desire for them: "In telling the mother's story, the daughter/narrator does not seek to reproduce herself upon the authentic ground of the Korean femi- nine. Rather, the text proceeds with the recognition that the identity of origin, in its ahistoricity, is at best an impossibility and at worst, a delusory consolation" (126). In the refusal of origins, the text also refuses to commit to a form of representation that would generate a stable version of "woman," of "Korean American," or even of "I." These refusals appear alongside the text's deep investment in pre- cisely the categories of which it seems most suspicious. As Sakai and Wong point out, the text's shifting, unstable language takes place alongside its intense expression of a desire for representa- tional clarity, for a political or gendered or ethnic position from which speech might be possible. Any reading of Dictde must account for the presence of that desire in the text, for the degree to which Korea and a feminist genealogy are not simply the arbitrary materi- als on which the text works out its refusal of consolatory identity but are instead the very things that produce the desire and need for consolation in the first place. It is not, then, that the text's poststruc- turalist relation to language and representation must be considered apart from its "real" or historically material concerns, but rather that its attempts to work through these concerns confront and are mediated by the text's relation to the reality and historical material- ity of the language that has been given to it by the world's history.6 5. The "mother tongue" in which the text invests so much energy is already multiple, as Sakai suggests: "Mother, you are a child still.... Still, you speak the tongue the manda- tory language like the others. It is not your own. Even if it is not you know you must. You are Bi-lingual. You are Tri-lingual... Mother tongue is your refuge" (Cha 45). 6. Elaine H. Kim has argued that the rush to poststructuralist readings erases the novel's historical references: "When post-structuralist critics ignore Cha's Korean heritage, thus denying Korean American identity and gender, it is a case of meaningful omission: they are practicing a kind of reverse Orientalism, according to which we are all the same (white) peo- ple" (22). But couple this problem with the degree to which writing by subjects labeled "eth- nic" (in relation to some metropole or other) is made inexorably to speak to the condition of its own ethnicity--what Rey Chow has called "coercive mimeticism" (107)-and texts like Dictde are caught between a poststructuralist rock and an ethnic hard place, their aesthetic radicalism reduced to a reflection of the instability of their "ethnic" position, so that any act of textual deviation from the realist norm will now simply produce a sense that the writer has adequately "reflected" the fragmentation and radical dislocation of his or her ethnic identity.</page><page sequence="7">HAYOT * 607 In fact Dictde, considered as a text and as a physical artifact, must be understood as an attempt to work out precisely this set of prob- lems, as though the text and the book together-that is, the images and words on the pages, and also the physical materiality of the pages themselves-were able to function as an allegory of Dictie's own powerful, incomplete making.7 One way to read the text is to understand it as a series of attempts to think through the problem of its own literary voice. The development of those attempts depends, from the book's title page onward, on the idea of dictation. As Sakai points out, the writer of a dictation exercise is meant "to say what she is expected to say without meaning it" (27); the writer's body in this sense is designed to be a neutral pass-through for a teacher's voice, with high marks given for faithful reproduction-for reproduction faithful, that is, to the disappearance of the writer as medium. The literal appearance of dictation in the text's opening pages gives way to a series of histori- cal and educational metaphors in which dictation is directly or indi- rectly implicated: the imposition of the Japanese language on Koreans during Japan's occupation, the prayers and vows of the French Catholic tradition, and the experience of American immigra- tion, education, and incomplete assimilation. The work of these lay- ered metaphors is to suggest, echoing the text's title, that all of Dictde might be the result of an extravagant exercise in dictation, an attempt to dictate, to repeat without meaning another dictation, but also to dictate to a reader the network of historical and personal effects that make it possible, finally, for the narrator to write. Where is the origin or ground of dictated speech? How might a speaker whose language is, in some complex sense, simply the result of a transformation from dictation to dictability find a place from which to begin? Here Dictie's textual machinery comes with 7. The temptation is to read the whole of Dictde as the anthropomorphic substitute for the subject whose becoming it appears to enact (and whose transformation would there- fore be final), allegorizing the physical enclosure of the book as object into the final clo- sure of a coherent and delimited self, making the unity of the text-as-book testify to the completion of another story of ethnic Americanization. But it would be a mistake to read the fact of the book's publication as a sign that its speaking subject has completed and organized itself into a final, definite configuration; the fact of publication is a datum, but not a final one, in Dictte's self-production as book.</page><page sequence="8">608 * CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE the manual printed on the inside. At one point, for instance, the text seems to be working out precisely the problem of beginnings: Further, Further inside. Further than. To middle. Deeper. Without mea- sure. Deeper than. Without means of measure. To core. In another tongue. Same word. Slight mutation of the same. Undefinable. Shift. Shift slightly. Into a different sound. The difference. How it discloses the air. Slight. Another word. Same. Parts of the same atmosphere. Deeper. Center. Without distance. No particular distance from center to periphery. Points of measure effaced. To begin there. There. In Media Res. (157) "In medias res"-literally, "in the middle of the thing"-describes the literary strategy of beginning a narrative "already in progress," in which the immediate and intense narrative or dialogic action of the story gestures analeptically backward to another, slower begin- ning ("In the county of Derbyshire, in the village of Perth, there lived a miller..."). Such a beginning is always, therefore, a "mid- dle," a place from which the text will later constellate the beginning and ending it requires. But here Dictee's narrator seems to suggest that any such middle must also be a beginning defined by depth and interiority, by its presence in a general atmosphere which con- tains slight differences that it does not organize into a system: "Points of measure effaced." The phrase in Latin is correctly written "in medias res," as "medias" is the accusative plural feminine of "medius," middle; in lit- erary historical terms, "in medias res" describes also one of the classic openings of the epic form. The text's replacement of "medias" by "Media" (the accusative singular feminine) is, among other things, a failure to respond properly to cultural and linguistic dictation. The "mistake" highlights the degree to which repetition in language depends on and organizes itself around concepts like grammatical number and gender; by reproducing the word "Media" in the middle of things, the text showcases its own investment in the physical form of linguistic or representational transmission.8s There is no easy way to translate the grammatical error of Dictde's Latin into English ("in the 8. Dictde includes a number of apparently typographical errors, some of which, like this one, permit extensive reading. For example, in a poem that appears in French and English on facing pages, the word "paragraphs" appears on both sides, though the</page><page sequence="9">HA YOT * 609 middles of things" would literally relate the Latin plural), but it would be equally difficult to translate the pun of "In Media Res" back into Latin. The text's language exists, in some sense, in between the two linguistic media that make it possible, the distance from its center to their peripheries difficult if not impossible to "measure." Media are always, Dictee seems to suggest here, in the "middle of things." This is so at least partly because they inter-mediate the process of the transmission of meaning by acting as the physical surface on which or in which the "message" gets delivered: "Shift. Shift slightly. Into a different sound. The difference. How it discloses the air" (157). The medium's disclosure of message entails, the text seems to say, the production of a slight shift or difference, leaving its mark on the texts that pass "through" it. Even the physical voice-site of air's shaping and disclosure- can be considered in this sense a "medium," an intermediary between something like intention and meaning. It is in this context that the text's reproduction of a diagram of the human vocal system, complete with subdiagram showing the "Abduction of vocal folds for phonation," mediates or, better, re-mediates the poetic text that appears on its facing page-"Cracked tongue. Broken tongue./ Pidgeon. Semblance of speech"-by making visible the physical medium within which any tongue, any pidgin, will inevitably oper- ate (74-75). Dictee's search for its own literary "voice" turns out to be mediated by the anthropomorphic metaphor of the physical voice. The question that results is not Michel Foucault's "What dif- ference does it make who is speaking?" (614) but, rather, What difference does it make to make the physical system of vocalization a metaphor for the right to produce social meaning? What differ- ence does it make what "speaking" is? That is, to what degree is the text's preoccupation with "voice" already mediated by the anthro- pomorphism of the metaphor on which a search for voice depends? French word is "paragraphes." Mistake, or material for interpretation? Likewise, Cha's spelling "correspondance" in a section otherwise in English may be an invocation to involve the body in communication (dance) or a reference to the Baudelaire poem "Correspondances," with its "forests of symbols," rather than a typo, even though the word is spelled "correspondence" elsewhere (33). In a text that plays frequently with translation, typography, and error, reading any given sign as not meaning by calling it a mistake feels like a risky strategy.</page><page sequence="10">610 * CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE Characteristically, such a question is not the end of things for Dictde but another beginning, as the text presses the subject of voice relentlessly through another mediation. Four pages after the dia- gram, the text reproduces a map of North and South Korea. A map is, of course, another translation, another dictation authored by the intersection of land's topographical surface and the political, human arrangement of that surface into countries, cities, borders, and demilitarized zones. The fact of two Koreas testifies, also, to the trauma of the Korean conflict, the forced separation of millions of Korean families, and the degree to which the geographical area known in English as "Korea" was, in the early 1980s, the site of a series of conflicts produced by powers that interacted with Korea from both "outside" and "inside" (the latter connected explicitly, in Dictee, to the search for political "voice" that produced student demonstrations in 1980 which led to the South Korean army's killing of at least two hundred people and the declaration of martial law). The map's appearance is perhaps most striking because the verti- cal arrangement of the Korean peninsula visually echoes the dia- gram of the vocal system four pages earlier, the bottom edge of South Korea coordinating roughly with the picture of lung and diaphragm, the North Korean border with China figuring-again, roughly-the "Nasal passage" at the top left of the medical illustration. In this fan- ciful visual translation, the problems of speaking/writing as any given individual subject (and therefore the problems of identity and of the aesthetic that the book so rigorously engages), Dictde suggests, reimagine or rehearse the problems of national identity, imperialism, and international mobility that ground the book. Korea's historical role as a "passage" between Japan and the Asian mainland becomes the subject of the metaphor of voice. The nation cannot be spoken as such without speaking geopolitical history. And geopolitical history cannot proceed except by the organization and sequencing of voices, the adjudication of whose relative "authenticity" is one of the funda- mental functions of the nation-state.9 9. Any such adjudication depends, since it will always involve the matching of a man- ner of speech (an accent, a tone, not to mention content) with a state-sponsored version of reality, on its very own theory of the aesthetic. The notion that deviations from a "realist" aesthetic will necessarily disrupt the realisms of mainstream political power ought to be</page><page sequence="11">HAYOT *611 But the text does not simply stop there. Instead, the strange paral- lel of map and diagram highlights the degree to which the compar- isons being made here proceed through a medium of their own, namely that of the visual system. The conjunction between human voice and geopolitical history is sustained and mediated by a visual pun that can be described but not directly reproduced in words.10 Whatever theory of subjectivity one generates from the conjunction of literary, physical, and political voices emerges, therefore, through a visual medium that ignores the question of voice entirely. The problem of political speech appears to us in a vision. Here we have something like a figure for the text as a whole, in which an initial mediation (of intention, of desire) is turned inside- out by the fact of its being mediated by yet another substance, namely the surface of the physical page that allows it to appear before us. In fact the exercise of dictation can now be understood not simply as an act of repetition, but also of translation across media: the first problem of dictation, almost always the putting down in writing of a spoken text whose meaning is intended neither by its speaker nor its writer, has to do with the translation of sound into writing. Dictation is not a repetition but a remediation, and the written sign it generates is already, in the moment of its inscription, imperfectly doubled by the voice of a speaker who performs it. As the translation of a teacher's vocal cue into "C'etait le premier jour point" ("It was the first day period") suggests, any attempt to render precisely into writing the sounds uttered by the teacher constitutes a "failure" of the act of writing; the correct response to this dictation is seriously shaken by the Bush administration's recourse to surrealism, myth, and story- telling. The notion that power doesn't have an aesthetic as such (that is, that its aesthetic is "neutral" or "realistic") is just as damaging as the notion that aesthetics have nothing to do with power. What literature and literary scholars have to offer as political critique may well stem from their expertise in understanding how stories are made and told, an argu- ment deducible also from Dictee. 10. It is also the case that diagrams and maps are effectively subject to different repre- sentational rules and could well be called different "media." The diagram of the vocal system, for instance, must be read as an "illustrative figure which, without representing the exact appearance of an object, gives an outline or general scheme of it, so as to exhibit the shape and relations of its various parts" ("diagram, n."; emphasis added). The diagram functions, therefore, as an illustration of a network of relations; what it represents is a sys- tem and not, like a map, a set of spatial relations.</page><page sequence="12">612 * CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE "C'etait le premier jour."-with the sound "point" makes turned into a grammatical period. Thus on its very first page Dictde has already begun from "the middle of things," foregrounding the medium of dictation that is its major organizing metaphor, and even in this first usage the text shows that it will not blithely follow the instructions of its primary mediating form. Or rather that it will follow them too well, to the letter. How to construe this obedience to the letter-as stupidity or resistance-is the question Dictde addresses to the teacher in us. Lest this play between voice and image, speech and writing, be understood too literally as a language game, Dictde, in a section devoted to Yu Guan Soon, a woman whose torture and murder by Japanese forces for her part in the movement of March 1, 1919, has made her a nationalist hero in Korea, connects those themes explic- itly to the act of making national, gendered history. Located in the section of the text called "Clio: History," this passage-which appears a few pages after the text reproduces a grainy, captionless photograph of a young woman, facing the inscription "YU GUAN SOON / BIRTH: By Lunar Calendar, 15, March 1903 / DEATH: 12, October, 1920. 8:20 A.M." (25)-considers the difference between national or political history and personal memory: Some will not know age. Some not age. Time stops. Time will stop for some. For them especially. Eternal time. No age. Time fixes for some. Their image, the memory of them is not given to deterioration, unlike the captured image that extracts from the soul precisely by reproducing, multiplying itself. Their countenance evokes not the hallowed beauty, beauty from seasonal decay, evokes not the inevitable, not death, but the dy-ing. (37) The text's consideration of memory organizes itself around the dif- ference between an image frozen in memory and a photograph, an image frozen on film. In favorably comparing the "memory of them... not given to deterioration" to the "captured image" (figur- ing the Japanese capture of Yu Guan Soon) that reproduces and multiplies itself, the narrator connects the visual exactness of a photograph's mechanical reproduction with "deterioration" and soul-stealing, and perhaps with the degree to which the social</page><page sequence="13">HAYOT 613 reproduction of an image as a photograph is an affront to the image as it is archived in living memory.1" And yet if time stops for some, if some do not know age, is that because of a death that comes too early-a question one must ask in the case of Yu Guan Soon--or because the nationalist image subtends the subject's immobility in the narrative imaginary? Who is to blame for the freezing of the image? The text gives no indication that its pho- tograph is of Yu Guan Soon. Instead, this image of an ordinary, expres- sionless face must be read in the context of its own reproduction and multiplication inside the pages of Dictee, as well as in relation to the national myth of female self-sacrifice through which Yu Guan Soon's life is arranged. The text does not reconstruct an image archive that would ground a recovery of the truth of Yu Guan Soon's identity prior to her emergence as a nationalist hero, but it asks what such a life, such an image, might have looked like from a perspective other than the one given by official history. "She is," the narrator writes, "born of one mother and one father" (25). That is, she is, somewhere-but not here, not today, not in this history or in these images-ordinary.12 The text does not so much recover that ordinariness as simply denote its loss. Here again, then, the text calls up the apparatus of reality and his- tory, as with the diagram and the map, only to undermine its ability to cohere, leaving certain readers with the sense "that modern Korea exists only as a history of found images-even, of dead images" (Cheng 122). But at least one can say, about dead images, that they are there and that they are dead; though Dictee may refuse to construct out of such an image or out of Yu Guan Soon's life an ontologically secure theory of what it means to be a Korean woman circa 1919, it nonetheless believes in the value of recording the fact of its presence. And the text goes on to suggest that the fixed image of the photograph-"Time fixes for some" could also refer to the 11. For further commentary on Cha's use of Yu Guan Soon, see Kim 16-17. 12. I mean "ordinary" here in the sense that everyone is "ordinarily" subject to a gen- erational discourse of origin and lineage. But it is also the case that Yu Guan Soon is "ordi- nary" in her heroism, as Laura Hyun Yi Kang has argued: "Being 'marked exceptional' for one's 'self-sacrifice' points to the impossible generic fixation of women within many nationalist narratives. The passage notes the paradoxical historiographic operation that simultaneously privileges the individual as unique in her historical context and yet ren- ders her a generic figure of self-denial in a broader discourse" (227).</page><page sequence="14">614 * CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE fixing solution used to develop photographic prints-fixes not Yu Guan Soon's death but her "dy-ing," the hyphen marking the text's insistence on process rather than end result. The photographic image itself may be dead, but what it captures is the gerund, which, as William Lily wrote in his 1549 introduction to grammar, "has both the active and the passive signification," a difference irre- ducible to a certain literalness ("Gerund"). Even a corpse in a photo- graph is alive, Roland Barthes once noted, if only as a corpse: "the living image of a dead thing" (Camera 79). Through the photograph-itself something like a repetition with- out meaning, a dictation exercise for "what the world might look like in our own absence" (Jameson, Postmodernism 248)-Dicthe reminds readers that what time "fixes" in the photograph can be understood only in relation to the technological demands of its production."3 The photographic image-like a map, diagram, or metaphor-is a site of mediation, a datum to be translated, interpreted, and organized. It is not the final testimony of the real. In this context, the photograph's lack of a caption places the burden of mediation and interpretation firmly on the reader, who must read it not as origin but as medium, as an object whose interpretation begins from somewhere inside the imperfectly constellated atmosphere of a story "already in progress." Lisa Lowe writes that Dictee "thematizes the failure of translation as a topos of faithful reproduction" (134). I would say that the text's treatment of "translation" in all its possible meanings thematizes, in some sense, the failure of "failure" as a useful concept for describ- ing what translation is or does. The translation that "fails," in Dictee, is first of all connected perpetually to the notion of dictation, and therefore to both repetition-without-meaning (as Sakai notes) and repetition-that-is-not-repetition: the dictation exercise, by translating orality into literacy, can succeed only by failing to reproduce precisely and faithfully. Likewise, a map is a map only if it does not pre- cisely reproduce the object it represents; and a voice is a voice only 13. In this sense, what Kang says about another of the book's photographs, this one of a Hangul inscription, applies equally well to the photograph of Yu Guan Soon: "its stark framing and odd placement in the text remind us that this is a printed reproduction of a photographic trace of the material inscription, which the readers of Dictde must confront in such a multiply mediated form" (233), the "material inscription" in this case being the biological surface of Yu Guan Soon's body.</page><page sequence="15">HAYOT * 615 insofar as it emerges, Dictde suggests, from somewhere that is neither the geopolitical map nor the biological system of its possibilities. No one says what they (would like to) mean. Each of these representa- tions is a "failure," but Dictee shows failure to be the fundamental intermediary of all representation, all communication. In this sense, what looks like "failure" probably ought to be called something else. In the process of transformation, of production, of expression, and even of living, what comes "In Media Res," as the text has it, never quite ceases to interrupt the process it makes possible, never ceases to be oh-so-slightly unfaithful to the origin and the destination, the source and the target, that imagine themselves on either side (tempo- rally, physically) of its mediation. What begins, "begin[s] there," as the text says (or doesn't "say"), in the middle of things. .3 * As a concept in narrative form, "in medias res" usefully undermines the notion of linear progress by rubbing the discourse against the story. Whether or not the "real" beginning of a narrative (that is, the first ele- ment in the temporal progress of a story) is ever retrieved, the "medias res" beginning at least opens the possibility of a story-beginning aban- doned by the needs of a future-oriented discourse. That any such beginning will, of necessity, operate simultaneously as a "middle" (of the story) and as a beginning (of the discourse) simply means that beginning in the middle of things always announces itself as double, as something that is a beginning only in the eye of a particular fiction. Articulated by a text that also thematizes a concern with geopolitical and personal history, this concern with beginning from the middle/ medium must be understood also as a form of interference with liter- ary genre. The genre I have in mind here is the ethnic bildungsroman, specifically the American version sustained and popularized by a public eager to have stories of successful immigrant assimilation con- firm the prejudice of national superiority, and typified in the context of Asian American literary criticism (rightly or wrongly) by the "model minority" novels of Amy Tan. Dictie's preference for the middle of things makes it profoundly resistant to being read as a bildungsroman of this type; the story arc such a narrative would require depends too heavily on an ending</page><page sequence="16">616 * CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE firmly differentiated from a beginning, whereas Dictde in some sense never gets far enough past the critique of those concepts to provide the comfort of a plot summary (first, Korea was occupied by the Japanese, then I went to Catholic school, then I came to America, and so on). Though one may therefore read the novel as a critique of the more popular, more obtuse form, reading it as just a critique would fail to recognize that Dictee confesses or elaborates its deep attraction to and need for precisely the bildungsroman even as it rejects it. It is from the perspective of the book's naming of its own desire, and from the generosity produced by understanding that desire as legitimate, if impossible, that one must begin to read Dictee's relationship to other immigrating fiction. Lisa Lowe has argued that in the case of Asian American writing, reading bildungsromanlike stories as simple-minded narratives of conversion misses the degree to which the histories such novels include disrupt or mitigate the generic structure they choose. "Even those novels that can be said to conform more closely to the formal criteria of the bildungsroman," Lowe argues, "express a contradiction between the demand for a univocal developmental narrative and the historical specificities of racialization, ghettoization, violence, and labor exploitation" (100).14 As Lowe goes on to show, with reference to John Okada's No-no Boy and Carlos Bulosan's America Is in the Heart, the bildungsroman form also serves to showcase a series of obstacles, most often forms of racial or ethnic prejudice, that stand in the way of an America that might successfully reshape itself to accommodate the protagonist's difference; in this sense, the ethnic bildungsroman offers a political and cultural accounting of American society and its limitations. To the degree to which it presents the possibility of overcoming the obstacles it identifies, the ethnic bil- dungsroman thus functions as a utopian critique, even though, in the hands of certain readers, it appears to confirm the fundamental assimilability of all immigrant or ethnic Americans and the capacious generosity of the U.S. government (full citizenship for everyone!). 14. Like Kim, Lowe stresses the dangers of a purely aesthetic reading of textual radi- calism. The contradictions derived from the conflict between narrative desire and ethnic history generate "formal deviations whose significances are misread if simply assimi- lated as modernist or postmodernist aesthetic codes" (Immigrant Acts 100).</page><page sequence="17">HA YOT * 617 It is in the doubled context of reception that I would like to discuss Anchee Min's Becoming Madame Mao. Min, who was born in Shanghai in 1957, is best known for writing Red Azalea, a mildly fictionalized autobiographical account of her life during the Cultural Revolution, which ends with her immigration to the United States in 1985.15 A quick glance through reviews of Min's work suggests that much of the critical praise she receives depends precisely on the degree to which her novels' portrayals of China, and the implied liberation provided by her move to the United States, reproduce the most Eurocentric, patriotic visions of what ethnic American fiction can do, namely, serving "as a model of panethnic entrepreneurship, selling American society on the value of Asian Americans," as Viet Thanh Nguyen puts it (149). In an interview in Publishers Weekly, for instance, Roxanne Farmanfarmaian declares, "Anchee Min herself has emerged from the morass of Maoism cleansed, able to feel and express enor- mous innocence" (67). And the back cover of Min's Wild Ginger features quotations from reviews that give some sense of how Houghton Mifflin intends to market Min's work: "The image she creates of a world marching lockstep is chilling"; "With sly, concen- trated power... [Min paints] a vivid picture of young people in the grip of ideology... [and] reminds us that the passion of youth can be channeled into tragic courses"; "Once again, Min reminds us of the freedoms we take for granted." This last citation, with its sense of the novel as a message from them to us, there to here, suggests that Min's fiction works best in its popular mode as a reminder of how good "we" Americans have it. But such a reading depends too much on its origins in a single national location and context and therefore misses the transnational complexity of Min's work. Though Min's novels are far less aestheti- cally challenging than Cha's Dictde-indeed, it is precisely Min's for- mal populism that opens her novels to being read as conventional ethnic bildungsromans-it seems worth trying to read them against the grain of the interviews and reviews (and perhaps even against Min's authorial desire) in order to find expressed there something of the complexity of the transnational politics of form and meaning from which they stem. 15. For full readings of Red Azalea, see Somerson, Ben Xu, and Wenying Xu.</page><page sequence="18">618 * CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE As in Dictie, one of the structural tensions in Min's writing has to do with the movement between a "source" culture that grounds certain important forms of national identity and a "target" culture from which the sexism (and, in Min's case, sexual repression) of the source culture can be criticized. Indeed, one can read her entire oeu- vre as an attempt to rework popular nationalist versions of Chinese history by locating in that history the positive presence of sexuality, especially women's sexuality. In a Western context, the notion that women's sexual expression, arousal, and desire constitute a liberat- ing gesture of self-making may not be especially radical, indeed, may simply reinforce the "repressive hypothesis" Foucault has described (History 10). In a Chinese context, however, a critique of the Cultural Revolution that makes it a site for repressed or illicit sexual expression, paired with a sense that true liberation and self- development can occur only through immigration to the United States (the endpoint of both Red Azalea and Katherine, Min's second novel), quite seriously challenges public, state-sponsored notions of Chinese history and Chinese difference.16 Nowhere is Min's project to remake Chinese history through a sustained attention to women and women's sexuality clearer than in Becoming Madame Mao, which retells the story of Jiang Qing, the wife of Mao Zedong and one of the architects of the Cultural Revolution. Already in Red Azalea the Supervisor-an androgynous, anonymous figure the novel suggests may be Jiang Qing, or may be interchangeable with her-remarks on the sexism of Chinese history's judgment of Jiang Qing: "That's Chinese history. The fall of a kingdom is always the fault of a concubine. Why should Comrade Jiang Qing be an exception?" (274). In her interview with Farmanfarmaian, Min repeats that point, noting: "It is the Chinese tradition that every dynasty's downfall is the concubine's fault. 16. Wendy Larson has specifically connected the liberatory impulse in Min's work to her American audience, for whom her rewriting of the Cultural Revolution as a crisis in sexual identity reads as a critique of China from the United States: "The interpretation of the Cultural Revolution as nothing more than a time of excessive repression is changed under [Min's] pen, becoming a utopian impetus toward a liberatory future located out and away from China" (443). Larson goes on to argue that Min's work is in this sense typ- ical of a broader movement in post-Cultural Revolution Chinese literature, which aims "to modernize the period through rewriting it as an erotic experience" (448n24).</page><page sequence="19">HA Y 0 T 619 Madame Mao is considered a white-boned demon. But how could she be all evil?" (66). Here the author repeats a thought originally published as the speech of one of her characters-originally published, in fact, in a mode of self-defense through the fictional voice of a never-quite-recognized Jiang Qing. As in Dictee, where a photograph of Hangul writing precedes the text's official opening, this sort of paratextual material lays the groundwork for a consideration of Becoming Madame Mao that recognizes the limits of a book as in some sense arbitrary: sympa- thy for a fictionalized Jiang Qing as against history's judgment pre- cedes and exceeds the ends of the novel itself. So too in the pages of the novel proper, where an "author's note" on an unnumbered page fac- ing the text's prologue reads, "I have tried my best to mirror the facts of history. Every character in this book existed in real life. The letters, poems, and extended quotations have been translated from original documents," while the last page of the text (also unnumbered) is a works-cited list titled "References." Becoming Madame Mao's narrative is therefore bracketed by a set of historical claims that attempt to ground the novel's aesthetic and narrative structures with the legit- imating promise of facticity, documentary reference, and linguistic competence. That these claims bracket the novel does not, however, exert much influence on its novelistic form. Becoming Madame Mao opens with a prologue, printed in italics, which further frames its major narrative: What does history recognize? A dish made of a hundred sparrows-a plate of mouths. Fourteen years since her arrest. 1991. Madame Mao Jiang Ching is seventy- seven years old. She is on the death seat. The only reason the authorities keep post- poning the execution is their hope of her repentance. Well, I won't surrender. When I was a child my mother used to tell me that I should think of myself as grass-born to be stepped on. The prologue introduces the novel's most prominent narrative strat- egy, namely the way the text shifts between third- and first-person narration, which appears here in the difference between the second and third paragraphs. Though the external narration of the first two</page><page sequence="20">620 * CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE paragraphs establishes the space from which Jiang Qing's first- person narration emerges in the third paragraph-we assume she is speaking from the jail cell invoked by the external narrator- nothing in the narrative itself, no shift of attention or perspective inside its diegetic space, seems to drive the movement between nar- rators. Unlike the drifts in free indirect discourse that mark the texts of, say, Virginia Woolf, Becoming Madame Mao's narrative shifts are profoundly unmotivated. In the reading, their effect is to announce, repeatedly, the text's status as fiction, its willful disregard of the realism of the world it represents. The novel's willingness to make seemingly arbitrary shifts in point of view foregrounds the privi- lege of the fictional author and, particularly given the presence of the first-person narrator, the act of imagination required to generate the novel as a fictional text.17 The novel does not accompany these shifts with any shift in tone, syntax, or lexicon-the voice and language of the external narrator resemble in every respect save their grammatical person the voice and language of the character Jiang Qing. Until a reader gets used to this, the combination of shift in narrative person with the familiarity of the textual voice is fairly bewildering, since the similarity in tone and the lack of any paratextual sign of a shift in voice make the change hard to catch; one can get a few sentences into a new para- graph before realizing that the narrator has switched again. The effect is to suggest either that the first-person narration emerges from the imaginative power of the external narrator or that the external narrator might be the projection of Jiang Qing as novelistic character. The impossibility of deciding which particular chiasmatic 17. Readers who post reviews at Amazon.com are not the perfect test audience, but a brief perusal there suggests that the technique is as jarring to some readers as one might expect it to be: "first off, min shifts from first-person to third-person with every para- graph. She'll be recounting a point in lan ping's (mao's) life and then in the next para- graph, she IS lan ping, it is often confusing, not to mention pretentious and arrogant"; "The book irked me in one sense though. The writing style-switching between first per- son and third person every few paragraphs (without any pattern!) made it hard to read. Kinda like listening to a good CD that has a scratch"; "In addition, the constant switching between first and third person perspectives was annoying and puzzling. The third per- son served no discernible purpose whatsoever." Another reviewer (who liked the book) provides the following critique of the complaints: "If changing perspective is problematic I suggest to a couple of reviewers to try James Joyce."</page><page sequence="21">HAYOT o 621 structure the novel favors speaks, as does the strategy of changing narrators itself, to a wish to confuse imaginative fiction with history, a subjective or fantasized perspective with an objective and factual one. The movement between two narrative voices that speak in the same accent and tone thus offers another answer to the text's open- ing line: "What does history recognize? A dish made of a hundred sparrows-a plate of mouths." Though the text speaks only in two "mouths," two turns out to be enough to call into question the modes of historical recognition that would be responsible for an "author's note" or a list of academic references.18 To say all this about narrative is not yet to have addressed the question of the text's style, which, as in all of Min's work, is straight- forward, repetitive English that tends to function as a marker of the text's "immigrant" origins.19 Wendy Larson has specifically associ- ated Min's style with her approach to historical and psychological realism: "Min's style is direct and simple, with short repetitive sen- tences forming the bulk of the narrative.... Min... manages to sug- gest that the story comes directly from the situation and has avoided the obfuscating veneer of civilization and history that makes every- thing so complex. The story, in other words, presents itself as a real, authentic rendition of something impossibly difficult to represent: the truth of individual subjectivity under Maoism" (434). Though in many ways this assessment strikes me as right-that is, though I agree with Larson that the text's syntactical simplicity has to do with 18. A more extended reading of Becoming Madame Mao would have to account for the one moment in the text that adopts-against the tonality and syntax of the rest of the novel-a deliberately academic tone and citational strategy. Discussing Jiang Qing's friend Fairlynn, the external narrator writes, "Although Fairlynn survives the Cultural Revolution... an important compartment in her own conscience bursts as well, as her memoir suggests (written in 1985 and published by South Coast China Publishing in 1997)" (294). This sentence is followed by two lengthy citations from the book. 19. Much is made, in interviews with and articles on Min, of the fact that she began to write Red Azalea while learning English in Chicago in the late 1980s. The degree to which Min then comes to model the ideal of Asian assimilation recalls once again the difficulty of reading immigrant fictions outside the ethnic frameworks within which they insis- tently appear in the public eye. Min's emergence (as a person and author) out of the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) gives her a historical background that dovetails neatly with the cold war origins of the "model minority" stereotype, through which, as Robert G. Lee argues, "America's anxieties about communism... might be contained and even- tually tamed" (146).</page><page sequence="22">622 * CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE the mode of realism it assumes-I am not sure that this simplicity functions as simply as Larson suggests, that one can get directly from something like "simple sentences" to the "real, authentic rendition of something impossibly difficult to represent." Before saying why, I want to suggest that the writing's syntactical simplicity is matched by a more general characterological and sym- bolic simplicity, and to propose that the combination of these simplic- ities allows one to describe Becoming Madame Mao's representational style within a more general historical frame, one that will ultimately return this essay to the question of mediation in immigrating fiction. By "characterological and symbolic simplicity" I mean, first, that the novel consistently includes sentences designed to explain and other- wise make visible the psychological interiority of its characters, so that no thought, emotion, or motivation goes unremarked, and, sec- ond, that the novel's own large-scale symbolic interests (even its sense of itself as a potential allegory) are likewise insistently arrayed on the surface of the text. Becoming Madame Mao thus leaves its read- ers with little doubt as to its intended meaning (its "symbolism," sim- ply put), hammering home its major thematic metaphors via a repetition that leaves little room for mis- or noninterpretation. Instead one gets the sense that this novel wants to make sure its readers know exactly what it means. Consider, for instance, the novel's major metaphor: acting. As a thematic concept, it is diegetically motivated by the facts of Jiang Qing's life: she was an actress in traditional Chinese operas and modern plays (including, famously, Ibsen's A Doll's House) before meeting Mao, and in her years at his side took over the entire cul- tural apparatus of the Cultural Revolution, writing and producing a series of eight model plays that were for a time the only politically acceptable form of public entertainment. From its opening pages, Becoming Madame Mao recounts the biographical facts of Jiang Qing's education in the theater, even as the third-person narrator remarks on other events that will eventually work themselves into the model operas ("Madame Mao later uses the incident in both a ballet and opera of the same title, The Women of the Red Detachment" [12]). Jiang Qing's entire life, the book suggests, is formed in the crucible of the theater, and her every act must be understood as the playing out of a set of roles within a theatrical framework</page><page sequence="23">HA YO T *623 established by the historical situation in which she found herself (a situation that includes, to be sure, a politics of performed gender). The novel makes this point repeatedly: in an argument with Mao, Jiang Qing cites a line from a play (131); when she changes her name to fit her new position, she leaves behind her "old role" (158); later she is "playing a strange role" (165); another character "continues like a bad actor reciting his lines" (198); she speaks "in a theatrical voice," finding her "line" "stylish and self-moving" (235); the exter- nal narrator says, "To history, this is her role. The leading lady of a great tragedy," and "in truth, for Madame Mao, there is no line between living and acting" (275, 284). Becoming Madame Mao ends with two paragraphs ventriloquizing Jiang Qing: "It is time to empty the stage.... And don't forget that I was an actress, a great actress.... For those who are fascinated by me you owe me applause, and for those who are disgusted you may spit. I thank you all for coming" (337). No one could get through the novel without grasp- ing this much of the novel's argument. The movement from histori- cal event (Jiang Qing works as an actress) to psychological form (Jiang Qing thinks of herself as an actress even when she isn't act- ing) is repeated often enough and in important enough places to emerge as the text's single major symbolic idea. The combined effects of the novel's patent symbolism, simple sentences, collapsed tone and style of the third- and first-person narrators, and open presentation of characterological interiority produce a remarkable flattening of the text's significative topogra- phy, as though the novel's third, psychological dimension were only barely managing to keep itself from collapsing into the geomet- ric plane sustaining it. As though, in the words of Peter Brooks, "Nothing is spared because nothing is left unsaid; the characters stand on stage and utter the unspeakable, give voice to their deepest feelings, dramatize through their heightened and polarized words and gestures the whole lesson of their relationship" (4)-in other words, as though the novel were adopting all the generic conven- tions of a melodrama. Brooks has suggested that the melodrama is driven by a desire to "express all," to lay out on the surface of the text every emotion, every subtext, so that the process of making moral choices can clarify itself (10). Only when one sees that Becoming Madame Mao expresses nothing so insistently as its own</page><page sequence="24">624 * CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE desire to be understood, to make its own meaning absolutely and patently clear-a desire thinkable solely in a world where the text imagines that it will be just as insistently misunderstood-can one grasp not simply its deepest generic identifications, but also its mediated self-doubling. Understanding Becoming Madame Mao as a melodrama allows, for instance, an interesting return to the question that moved Anchee Min to write the novel: how could Jiang Qing be all evil? Insofar as this question resists a Manichean conception of good and evil, insofar as it proposes to produce a more complex version of the historical Jiang Qing, as a person rather than a caricature, it can be understood as fundamentally antimelodramatic. Indeed, the text's historical self-presentation suggests that the critique of Jiang-Qing-as-melodramatic-figure must begin with clear-eyed his- torical realism. If the novel has traditionally been a site for the development of the modern sense of what a person is, and if that development has largely proceeded through the invention and rep- resentation of "round" characters, then the fundamental premise of Becoming Madame Mao could be said to be that the public judgment of Jiang Qing, itself a melodramatic twist on the real, should be cor- rected via a dual recourse to history and to the novel's power to imagine "character." And yet Becoming Madame Mao's own formal adoption of the strate- gies of melodrama-namely the sensational, exaggerated representa- tion of its symbolic structure and its characters' interior language (at one point the narrator says of two characters, "The truth is deeper. They are star-crossed. There is betrayal" [81])-means that its declared attempt to undo the melodramatic judgment of Jiang Qing occurs in the guise of melodrama itself. In other words, Becoming Madame Mao reproduces at the level of its own form precisely the generic mechanism that it announces it is its intention to resist. Before laying out the implications of such a contradiction for the meaning of the novel as a whole, we need to consider the relation- ship between melodrama and the major metaphorical structure the novel privileges, namely that of theater, or more precisely, Chinese revolutionary opera. Developed in order to stimulate the revolution- ary fervor of the masses, revolutionary operas usually featured plots in which a male proletarian hero, often inspired or aided by a female</page><page sequence="25">HA YOT * 625 helper, defeats an enemy of the people (bandits, anticommunists, and the like). These dramas were staged with modem costumes and representational sets supplementing Chinese operatic tradition's long-established vocabulary of kinesthetic, visual, and aural signs. From a Western perspective, Chinese revolutionary opera's "lack" of psychological realism, its emphasis on gestural convention to portray emotional states, actions, and situations (walking in a circle, for instance, to indicate a long journey), has tended to signify as the grossest and most caricatured melodrama, and not just because it, like European melodramas, combines spoken drama with song. Marcelin Pleynet's reaction to the revolutionary opera he saw in 1974 is fairly typical: "The characters are ultra-stereotyped and papier-mach&amp;.... Frankly, it's almost unbearable to watch a people, friendly, clearly artful and subtle, being represented by such mannequins" (81).20 Whether or not Chinese opera is actually "melodramatic"-the question is impossible to answer, since aes- thetic categories have cultural origins-Pleynet's reaction suggests something of its appearance in the West. The melodramatic style of Becoming Madame Mao must therefore be understood within two cultural vocabularies at once-that of a Chinese theatrical practice responsive since the 1920s to the imposition of, or attraction to, the theories of subjectivity grounding Western realism, and that of the historical form of Western melodrama, to which the text's senti- mentalism and stereotyping seem to correspond. The complexity of the novel's style must therefore be understood not simply in relation to its protagonist's particular life history, but also in some sense as an allegory of the cultural translation of form, as an attempt simultaneously to render and to perform, for an American audience, the aesthetic style that dominated all Chinese artistic practice during the Cultural Revolution. That allegory 20. An introduction to Chinese opera published in Paris in 1955 remarks on the nonre- alism of Chinese theater in terms that resemble Pleynet's, but they are positively tuned and recognize the nonrealism of Chinese theater as likely to survive the aesthetic demands of communism: "Also in communist China the problem of realism, touchstone of the arts, has never been confused with the temptations of veridism or the facile notion of naturalism.... The leading figures of Chinese theater today understand completely that an art that uses symbols can be realist, and that an art that is a servile imitation of real reality can be absolutely un-realistic" (Roy 34; my translation).</page><page sequence="26">626 * CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE interacts uncomfortably with the novel's apparent mission to rescue Jiang Qing from the clutches of history's melodramatic judgment. Because the novel tells us over and over again that Jiang Qing's life was a performance, a play, and that her own contribution to Chinese culture was likewise a series of performances and plays which, the text suggests, were in some sense projections of her personal ten- dency to imagine power as a staging, the style of Becoming Madame Mao allows us to imagine the novel itself as a ninth model opera reconstructed from the combination of history and the novelistic imagination. But given that the novel also recognizes the aesthetic of the model operas as a distorting one--given that one of the things the model operas distort into near-unrecognizability is, according to the novel, Jiang Qing's desire-its portrayal of Jiang Qing's life must be understood in turn as a second-order, distorting reflection in the funhouse mirror that was the Cultural Revolution's preferred style. It may now be clearer why the novel adopts the admittedly awk- ward strategy of shifting between third- and first-person narration without simultaneously shifting its narrative voice or tone. The movement between Jiang Qing and the external narrator allows the novel to imagine that Jiang Qing is telling her own story in the third person, is in some sense acting out her own life in the pages of the novel; and because the text never forces a decision on the issue, it also offers the converse possibility, namely that the novel's first- person subject might be a narrative effect of a third-person con- sciousness. Is the narrative "I" simply a projection of an objective historical voice, or is the historical voice instead the subjective arti- fact of a personal imagination? The novel allows for both answers, and in this sense the narrator quite literally "becomes" Madame Mao even as Madame Mao acquires, by the end of the novel, the ability to narrate the curtain call of her own performance. Recalling Barthes, one can say that the novel's reimagined history "only reaches us through the intellectual (alienated) act of a first reader who is already on stage" ("Brecht" 265). All of this might, in one final turn, be understood within the con- text of Min's ongoing critique of the Cultural Revolution's sexual pol- itics. Julia Kristeva, returning from a visit to China with Barthes and Pleynet in 1974, remarked that the model operas left "no room for whatever in the psyche, the libido, the imagination, has not been</page><page sequence="27">HA YOT * 627 channeled into political sublimation. As if the family, that harbour of the imagination, had consumed itself; and the desires of the community-represented by the desire of the girl-had vested them- selves directly in politics, deeply and fully, but not without failure or drama" (155). Indeed, the plot of revolutionary operas frequently hinged on the political intervention of a young woman who, by demanding the right to participate in political action, confirmed the Communist policy of gender equality and, sometimes, shamed less courageous men into joining the revolution. As Kristeva points out- and it is important to note that she does so from the perspective of a post-Freudian West for which sexuality was the most important sin- gle component of psychological depth-the effect of the revolution- ary operas was to evacuate any sense of sexuality, now understood largely as a system of bourgeois preferences that could only hinder the revolution. The melodramatic flattening of symbol and character proceeded largely through the overwhelming politicization of subjec- tivity, so that the characters appearing on stage in fact came to repro- duce, at least in terms of the relation between inside and outside, the aesthetic strategies of the actors who portrayed them.21 In some sense, Min's entire body of work can be understood as an attempt to under- mine the sexual politics of such a theater from within by insisting that female sexuality was inside the Cultural Revolution all along. The irony, of course, is that the choice of melodrama as an aesthetic mode in Becoming Madame Mao (and its presence more generally throughout Min's work) means that the novel consistently repro- duces the aesthetic structures whose strictures it makes responsible for the repression of female sexuality and for the party line on Jiang Qing's place in Chinese history. Melodrama is both the wound and the medicine; the answer to its stylistic demands must be given in the melodramatic terms in which the questions have been asked, as though an intelligible response could not arise from outside the medium but rather had to materialize from somewhere within it. 21. As Xiaomei Chen remarks, the "highly stylized movements on [the Cultural Revolutionary] stage initiated offstage imitation leading to conformity. Knowledge was being absorbed through a unique theatrical experience that not only itself resulted from imitating 'real' revolutionary life, but, most important, provided millions of people with a model for more revolutionary behavior in their own 'real' lives. Here was a case, then, not uncommon in those times, of life imitating art rather than the other way around" (137).</page><page sequence="28">628 ' CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE The paradox recalls, at last, the question of mediation, since one can now ask how to understand the novel's argument at the level of content in relation to its choice of melodrama as form. The tempta- tion to read the formal choice of melodrama as the insistent return of the novel's repressed is powerful, as doing so would allow us a sense of the novel as a character doomed to endlessly and uncon- sciously repeat precisely that which it most persistently seeks to criticize. But Becoming Madame Mao seems aware enough of itself as a melodramatic fiction for me to want to say, instead, that the return of melodrama is not some unconscious expression of the novel's own unconscious origins, but rather that this apparent "return" or, more generally, the contradiction between the mediating form and what it mediates, is simply the ontological surface of the novel's being. The model opera performed in and by the text, with Jiang Qing playing the parts of both the helper heroine and the enemy of the state, indicates precisely the oscillation between grammatical subject and object, activity and passivity, that characterizes the grammatical gerund. What the text is at the level of form cannot be separated from what it says at the level of content. As in Dictde, then, the political energy of Becoming Madame Mao emerges from that moment at which it seems most contradictory, and that contradictoriness itself means that whatever project it sustains- including the project of rescuing Jiang Qing's reputation-will ulti- mately be doomed to failure. In this sense the novel's presentation of female sexuality and power inside the Cultural Revolution must also be understood as a "failure," if the fact of its form is to be taken seri- ously.22 The novel's evocation of melodrama, already understood as a representational form that aims not to represent reality but to exag- gerate it, fails at least partly because its faithful reproduction of, on one hand, the formal conditions of the history it tells (and here it is worth remembering that Jiang Qing's guilt was established by the state in 1981 at a show trial) and, on the other, the fictional content of 22. To say all this is to say nothing of the gendered history of melodrama as form in the West. Joan Copjec has associated the emergence of melodrama with both a "female logic of failure" and the development of free indirect discourse: "Not only does melodrama center on dramatic situations that elicit tears from its audience, it does so by registering the female logic of failure which makes the cry the inevitable remainder that results from the subtraction of the Other's reply from all that is implied by our address to it" (257).</page><page sequence="29">HAYOT o 629 its narrative (that is, Jiang Qing's history in and with the theater) requires it not to reproduce those things faithfully: it is another failed dictation. Though Becoming Madame Mao, and Min's work more generally, seems far more able than Cha's Dictee to generate responses that stage it as the most fully assimilated of immigrant fictions, its melo- dramatic form can also be read as suggesting that whatever repre- sentational victories emerge from the text ("It is interesting to see [Jiang Qing] sketched as a human being and introduced in a vaguely positive light," writes Sheryl WuDunn) can be taken only as seriously as the model operas were, that the "character" of Jiang Qing the novel proposes is at its most accurate only when it repre- sents its own inaccuracy, at its least staged precisely when it most openly presents its stagedness. We do not know whether it tells the truth or a lie. And yet the novel's very existence testifies to its own ability to take the model operas seriously, to make them speak in the present not simply as a form of cultural nostalgia but as an archive of memories and aesthetic forms that can generate new stories.23 Here, perhaps even more vividly than in Dictde, the text gives us an allegory of its own refusal to complete the mediation of its story, its reanimation of Jiang Qing not a completed death but an ongoing "dy-ing" whose absurdly melodramatic goodbye ("I thank you all for coming"), read as a sign presented by the imaginative act of the novel itself, gives the entire historical exercise of the novel (includ- ing its claim to reproduce the "facts of history") a comic dimension. Indeed, this is the secret of "dy-ing": caught between the desire for closure and its impossibility, dy-ing generates an ongoing play whose comedy resides in postponing for as long as possible the death of the mediator on whose presence it depends. *4. In 1935, Bertolt Brecht saw the Chinese actor Mei Lan-fang perform in Moscow. In "Alienation-Effects in Chinese Theater," written later 23. Much contemporary Chinese art strives for just such a goal. Feng Mengbo, for instance, combines scenes from the model opera Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy with images from the video game Doom in Taking Mt Doom by Strategy (Haggerty Art Museum, Milwaukee, 1997); think here also of Chen Kaige's Farewell My Concubine.</page><page sequence="30">630 _ CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE that year, Brecht described Mei's performance and introduced his famous concept of the Verfremdungseffekt, the technique of alienation that would undergird so much of his epic theater. Brecht used the Chinese model-or, better, his interpretation of that model-as a place from which to critique the sensibilities of the bourgeois the- ater. Writing that the Chinese actor presents emotional states as signs rather than as psychological truths, Brecht argued that the dis- tance thereby maintained between "character" and "actor" destroys the forms of empathic identification that grounded contemporary European theater. The Chinese actor's body, Brecht wrote, remains visible on stage as his own; any gesture of the actor's is therefore the act of a subject who is, in that moment, reenacting a scene rather than acting as a character. Chinese theater, understood by Brecht as committed to a radical emotional distancing that used conventional symbols to destroy the notion of the actor's psychological interiority, became in the history of European theater one origin of the Brechtian sign, which, as Roland Barthes discovered upon seeing Brecht's Berliner Ensemble perform in Paris in 1954, promised "a phenomenon unknown in the West (perhaps precisely because Brecht had learned it from the East): a theater without hysteria" (Rustle 157). Though Brecht's under- standing of Chinese acting did a good deal of violence to how Chinese theater was perceived by Chinese people in China (and was in any case idiosyncratic even among Western observers of Mei Lan-fang's performance),24 it can nonetheless be read as one poten- tial origin of the mode of reading this essay both pursues and dis- covers in the work of Theresa Hak Kyung Cha and Anchee Min, the doubled and doubling sign thereby redoubled and redoubling an origin that is not one in any historical or literary sense. What I have been suggesting all along in my readings is well- captured by this historical irony, in which a European remediation of an Asian representational practice becomes, mediated, one site for the playing out of the poststructuralist concerns with language and form that emerge, half a century later, from ethnic American texts that 24. Haun Saussy has been engaged in a lengthy project to recuperate the variety of reactions to Mei's performance, which interacted with the Russian theater world, the aes- thetic doctrines of the Comintern, and changes in Chinese theater.</page><page sequence="31">HAYOT o 631 present us with a phenomenon-in this instance the reappearance of a Brechtian sign mediated by the historical and personal fact of immi- gration and all that it implies-that seems simultaneously "unknown in the West" and "learned... from the East." The vertiginous quality of this return ought rightly to produce a suspicion not simply about the categories of West and East, which we have all learned to recog- nize as profoundly mediated by a dialectics of culture and history, but also about the notion of translation or immigration that would authorize the sense that some idea could arrive in a new place as an "unknown" thing "learned from" elsewhere. What that framing of mediation supposes, first of all, is a theory of mediation or translation in which the new, immigrated unknown can emerge from the process of translation without bearing within itself any difference due to its mediation. As Dictee and Becoming Madame Mao indicate, each in its own way, the act of acquiring any new thing from elsewhere-be it cultural knowledge, a sense of identity (of the self or of a historical figure), or a sense of the representationality of a literary form-cannot be understood unless one first accounts for the presence of the medium through which that thing crosses over. And that accounting, both texts suggest, can never quite complete itself, since the difference the medium makes means that any putative origin (include the text's own origin-ality) already begins, as Cha writes, in the middle of things; since the medium can never be grasped except through the mediation of another medium (the metaphor of voice translated into a map or diagram, or just into another metaphor of voice), no struc- ture of origin can ever finish what it started, or where it started. Instead, what we can do in reading is, perhaps, attend to the presence of the medium itself, recognize the degree to which the medium will, as though in an inaudible hum or a burst of ultraviolet light, continue to mediate in realms outside the immediately sensible. What my readings of Dictee and Becoming Madame Mao sug- gest, then, is that whatever specificity one ascribes to their Asian Americanness (and here it will matter that Cha and Min were born in Asia and immigrated to the United States) must be construed in terms of the texts' investment in the figure of mediation, in how each text folds over into itself the problem of its own language and form so as to make the separation of arbitrariness and ontology impossible. Neither novel offers as a "solution" to the dilemma of its</page><page sequence="32">632 * CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE narration the possibility of endless ludic play. Each suggests, rather, that the only place from which to say the very serious things each text attempts to say will be a place whose origin must draw, in some important way, on the intensity of the arguments the text expresses. Though this self-referential generativity cannot, because it never manages to separate its origins from its self, be philosophically "serious" (and therefore ontologically sound), neither is it purely arbitrary. That aporia makes whatever Asian Americanness emerges from the two novels the subject of the same doubled figura- tion that produces it in the first place, uncovering, perhaps, as Paul Gilroy has argued for the black Atlantic, an "ethics of freedom" out- side the racial complicities of "occidental rationality" (56). Because such a middled and muddled originality seems so often to appear in immigrant fiction-because the real historical conditions that arrange themselves around the fact of immigration, and which arrange in advance its reception, will call to mind the combination of a desire for origin and a recognition of its difficulty or even impossi- bility, because to say "Asian American" or "African American" is already to denote the presence of two possible origins for a single being-it is tempting to read this doubleness as the final truth of immigrant or ethnic identity itself. But to think this way is to mistake once again the arbitrary for the ontological, to insist too strongly on the fact of ethnic identity as a form of subjectivity that automatically and necessarily resists, if only by its embodiment of contradiction, one hegemony or another. If, as Viet Nguyen suggests in the conclu- sion of Race and Resistance, it "is doubtful that Asian America as a cat- egory, a space, or an identity will be adequate in addressing the needs and desires of... 'bad subjects' in a future after multiculturalism," it is because in imagining a future that follows the present, Nguyen is able to see that the current constellation, though it may seem ontologically necessary today, will one day be obsolete (171).25 Managing a relation to that future while respecting the demands of the past whose future 25. Wendy Brown has argued that "political identities generated out of liberal, disci- plinary societies, insofar as they are premised on exclusion from a universal ideal, require that ideal, as well as their exclusion from it, for their own continuing existence as identi- ties" (65). What Nguyen imagines here is a future in which ethnic identity disappears as a category because the liberal, disciplinary society that sustains it will have been changed-hopefully for the better, but "better" is, of course, a political category.</page><page sequence="33">HAYOT * 633 we are living means doing the work of thinking through the present, which is also a medium and which, as Dict&amp;e suggests, will also take a cut from the transactions it permits. There is a powerful temptation to read that cut in terms of an ethics of loss, to say that what fictionality teaches, what immigration teaches, what modernization teaches is precisely the experience of the world's inscrutability, an inscrutability compensated for and domes- ticated when someone attributes it to the Asiatic or the immigrant or even to the fictionality of fiction. The lack of understanding that looks back from the face of the world does sometimes feel like a loss, but only if one expects the world to understand, only if one has imagined an originary plenitude or comprehension that so often is the alleged property of earlier, more innocent eras or places that were truly "home." But why not imagine that such a feeling, too, is historical? Imagine not only that the conjunction of ethnic or immigrant identity with that experience is the product of a particular history of imperial- ism and globalization, nor simply that the fact of modernization is somehow unusually responsible for a sense of dislocation and lack, but rather that the entire sense of loss that makes the origin of being human something like a foundational trauma, and that regrets with- out cease the damage done by mediation, might in some other future be understood neither as a loss nor as a gain (which would just reverse things) but as nothing.26 Imagine that such a feeling of loss might one day disappear and, like Foucault's face drawn in the sand at the edge of the sea, fade into-the unremembered and unthinkable. The interest of the sort of fiction discussed here would not, then, lie only in the fact that it reimagines the historical presence of loss as a generative and necessary force-exposing what I called in the case of Dictde the failure of "failure" as an explanatory concept-but that in showing how to conceptualize mediation without thinking of it as loss, these works imagine the possibility of a future (for fiction, for notions of immigration and mediation) that is, however mod- estly, not our present.

Here I think not only of the entire discipline of psychoanalysis but also of the most theological pretensions of the deconstructive enterprise (which emerge partially histori- cized in the discipline of trauma studies), for which I have great sympathy.</page><page sequence="34">634 * CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE WORKS CITED Ahmad, Aijaz.
