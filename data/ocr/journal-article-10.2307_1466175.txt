Hardwick Feuerbach and the Interpretation of Religion. By Van A. Harvey. Cam- bridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995. 319 pages. $59.95. When investigators listen to what believers themselves say, they will dis- cover that these believers' hopes and beliefs are not bounded by the limits of nature. Nor do these believers find it to be good news that creation is a science-fiction nightmare. What they hope for and desire can be seen in their hymns and prayers; and what these hymns and prayers reveal, Feuerbach argued, is the faith that each one of them is the object of a personal, divine subject who transcends nature and who will, in the end, enable them to transcend it also. That is the religious illusion; and al- though Feuerbach could understand why it has such a hold on human existence, he finally rejected it for all of the reasons given in this book. (Harvey 1995:309) Van Harvey's Feuerbach and the Interpretation of Religion is an impres- sive contribution to religious studies and the philosophy of religion.' Not only does it exhibit the continuing importance of Ludwig Feuerbach for the study of religion, it also recovers Feuerbach's almost unknown work after the more famous The Essence of Christianity and shows that this later work is in some respects more pertinent than the earlier for themes Charley D.

More than just a his- torical recovery of Feuerbach, however, Harvey's book also makes an outstanding contribution to the field of religious studies by applying to Feuerbach what Richard Rorty terms a "rational reconstruction" (15, 16-20, 231f.). Employing Feuerbach as a base, Harvey addresses such issues as the theory of projection, the question of reduction in theories of religion, the implicit theories of human nature embedded in various in- terpretive strategies, and many more. With respect to these themes, Feuer- bach is a model of the contemporary interface between the philosophy of religion and religious studies. For those like myself who have long profited from Harvey's work, however, Feuerbach will have other resonances and another significance. Such readers will be struck with how thoroughly Harvey has transformed himself from a theologian into an academic student of religion and, indeed, has done so with a masterful command of this field's philosophi- cally interesting themes. In Feuerbach the theological motifs from The Historian and the Believer and A Handbook of Theological Terms are al- most entirely muted. This is not to say that Feuerbach makes no construc- tive contribution. Constructively, however, it almost entirely addresses issues generated by the impartial study of religion.2 Furthermore, Harvey clearly identifies his constructive interests in the academic study of reli- gion with the "hermeneutics of suspicion" that, since Ricoeur coined this felicitous phrase, we have identified with "masters of suspicion" such as Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud (and now Feuerbach and Harvey as well). Harvey, in other words, seems to have transformed himself not merely into an academic student of religion but constructively within the latter discipline entirely into a critic of religion. That is the significance of the quotation from the very end of Feuerbach with which this essay opens. A striking example of Harvey's transformation into "suspicious stu- dent of religion" is his treatment of Ernest Becker in the last chapter of Feuerbach. Those familiar with Harvey in recent years will know of his interest in Becker's work, including the latter's odd notion of "reli- gious illusion." As one approaches the discussion of Becker toward the end of Feuerbach, one might have expected Harvey to struggle toward some sort of informed, critical, but still quasi-theological constructive appropriation of Becker's themes on the far side of Feuerbachian "suspi- cion." Instead, the book closes simply with critique. Harvey finds Becker incoherent for attempting to combine an admiration for the possibilities of religious illusion in Judaism and Christianity with a Darwinian con- 2 Harvey distinguishes his work from a "traditional historical study" and uses the word "construc- tive" in exactly this sense (15).</page><page sequence="3">Hardwick: Harvey's Feuerbach and the Possibility of a Liberal Theology 865 ception of the world viewed as a "science-fiction nightmare" (306-309). Feuerbach ends, in other words, with Harvey simply as master of sus- picion. For those who continue to admire Harvey's earlier theological efforts, Harvey's work on Feuerbach raises the same question Feuerbach has raised for theologians since the nineteenth century, namely, whether the- ology has any future after a suspicious critique of it, or now whether there are any constructive theological possibilities that arise from a "rational reconstruction" of Feuerbach. Not the least source of this question is Har- vey's own "left-liberal" theological sympathies from his earlier work, especially from the last three chapters of The Historian and the Believer. Two additional points directly from Feuerbach (and from Harvey's Feuerbach) support this question. First, let us recognize that at least for the last fifty years or so it has not been possible to be a theologian without also being an academic student of religion. This is especially true for theo- logians who continue to stand within the tradition of liberal theology and who consequently recognize that any theology appropriate to our con- temporary intellectual situation must be profoundly revisionary. What this means is that a contemporary liberal theology must as fully internal- ize Feuerbach and the masters of suspicion as those students of religion who see suspicion only as critique. It is simply not true that theology is only possible today by ignoring Feuerbach and the masters of suspicion. Today we are all masters of suspicion, or at least we all should be, since today there is no way to ignore this philosophical and social scientific context. But then, second, there is a surprising feature of Feuerbach that cannot but strike any theologian who admires Harvey's early work. I refer here to Harvey's emphasis on Feuerbach's pride in how he, unlike theolo- gians, accepted the religious believer's language and practices directly on the naive, literalistically supernatural terms that the believer uses to express his/her needs, fears, and hopes (73, 309). This is a pervasive theme throughout Feuerbach, and it is one on which Harvey's own suspicious interpretations depend. For instance, concerning Becker, Harvey says, speaking in the voice of Feuerbach, that it is precisely the indifference of the universe to human welfare that "makes it impossible for Becker to salvage anything significant from traditional religions or to distinguish his own position from agnosticism, because it is the essence of religion to believe that the universe is not utterly indifferent and that human beings can be miraculously redeemed" (306, my italics). Because this is the essence of religion (that without which religion would not be religion, the claim implies), Feuerbach (and Harvey's interpretation of Feuerbach) insist again and again that miracle in the most direct, literal sense belongs to the</page><page sequence="4">866 Journal of the American Academy of Religion very essence of religion, that by its very nature religion is committed in the most naive and literal sense to "the triumph of possibility over neces- sity" (306). "The point underlying Feuerbach's analysis of both Christianity and Judaism" Harvey says in another context, "is that there exists a deep and disturbing conceptual relationship among the doctrines of creation ex nihilo, providence, miracles, prayer, and faith. The link that binds them all is that the aim of creation itself is the well-being of the human species in general and the blessed survival of the individual in particular" (86, my italics). This is why, Feuerbach argued, Christianity has a problematic relationship to "nature" and must, basically, simply ignore "the realm of intermediary or secondary causes" (87). Harvey can then comment, again speaking ostensibly in the voice of Feuerbach: "Since faith is the convic- tion that the omnipotent creator's deepest intention is the happiness of the believer, it also holds that God can set aside the necessities of nature in order to secure that for which the believer prays. Thus the ordinary believer comes to regard the belief in the possibility of miracles as a test of true faith in the power of the creator; indeed, in the existence of a crea- tor at all" (88). This permits Harvey to conclude, as in the epigram at the beginning of this essay, that "when investigators listen to what believers themselves say, they will discover that these believers' hopes and beliefs are not bounded by the limits of nature." What this investigator thereby discovers by listening to the hymns and prayers of these believers is "the religious illusion": "the faith that each one of them is the object of a per- sonal, divine subject who transcends nature and who will, in the end, enable them to transcend it also" (309, my italics). Harvey is careful to attribute these conclusions solely to Feuerbach. For Harvey thus to submerge his own views in this fashion is appropriate for a work written about Feuerbach, even as a "rational reconstruction," for, as noted above, the "constructive" context for this reconstruction is not theology but the academic study of religion. Such conclusions are entirely appropriate under the auspices of the academic study of religion, for the issues throughout concern an impartial identification of what reli- gion is, not theological construction (or revision) on this basis. Neverthe- less, it is significant that Harvey does submerge his own views in this fashion-even as one cannot avoid the impression that he is himself sym- pathetic to such "suspicious" conclusions. Feuerbach systematically avoids any discussion of the kind of "constructively theological" implications that one might take to be a natural extension of such a splendid analysis. It is as though, dare one say, a concluding chapter, one appropriate for a theologian, is missing from the book-unless, of course, the views in the concluding chapter are not just Feuerbach speaking but the views of</page><page sequence="5">Hardwick: Harvey's Feuerbach and the Possibility of a Liberal Theology 867 Harvey himself wearing his philosopher of religion (but not his theolo- gian's) hat. Feuerbach/Harvey's insistence on a naive, literal, supernatural iden- tity for the essence of religion blocks at the outset any liberal revision on the far side of Feuerbach and raises fundamental questions about the future of theology itself. In this sense, Harvey seems to share Feuerbach's contempt for theological efforts that dilute or circumvent or rethink the naive believer's naive needs and hopes (see 73). Harvey shows no in- terest in pursuing Ricoeur's alternative to "the hermeneutics of suspi- cion," namely, a "hermeneutics of recollection" that, in Harvey's words, "assumes that the religious consciousness is in touch with something real and contains, therefore, a message that can be retrieved or 'recollected'" in a "'second naivete' which has passed through the fires of criticism" (if., my italics; Ricoeur: 28-36). The problem is that any such effort to achieve a "recollected second nalvete" must, contra Feuerbach/Harvey, necessarily revise, rethink, or reinterpret not only the terms in which the naive re- ligious believer expresses herself but very likely the religious needs and hopes themselves that stand behind such expressions. For instance, no contemporary "hermeneutics of recollection" can accept Feuerbach/Har- vey's claim that "providence and miracle are of the essence of religious faith and not merely accidental to it" (73), for Feuerbach would then be correct that the deepest inner logic of Christianity requires an indifference to "the realm of intermediary or secondary causes" (87), a naive, childish, and ultimately foolish commitment to "the triumph of possibility [i.e., wishes] over necessity" (306).3 Such indifference should be impossible for theologians today given the taken-for-granted character of the scientific view of the world that we all wear, theologians included, like a second skin. In this sense, today the "masters of suspicion" have indeed prevailed, not over but within theology itself. In one of his few direct discussions of theology in Feuerbach, Harvey states the problem elegantly. He notes that most contemporary theolo- gians reject Feuerbach's view that religion stands or falls with its naive 3 This judgment is certainly true of the work of Nancey Murphy who represents one of the more thoroughgoing, and best, recent attempts to defend the compatibility of personalistic theism and natural science (Murphy; Murphy and Ellis). Murphy simply finds the miracle(s) representing per- sonal divine intent, the divine intervention or "making happen," earlier or further back in the natu- ral processes, namely, at the quantum level in the collapse of the wave function. Revealing here is that Murphy cannot, indeed does not even try, to account for why some collapses of the wave function apparently represent ordinary natural processes (no intent at all) whereas others represent divine interventions. She also makes no effort beyond an appeal to mystery to explain the mechanism by which an apparently immaterial divine being can "act" to make something happen at the quantum level. She simply identifies where in nature the miracles occur, but qua miraculous intervention they are identical to what "miracle" meant in the twelfth century or prior to Hume's devastating critique.</page><page sequence="6">868 Journal of the American Academy of Religion expressions. The reason is that Feuerbach's view presents "a false and intolerable dilemma: either fundamentalism or atheism. If the theolo- gians attempt in any way to eliminate the anthropomorphism and super- naturalism of the religion, then they are accused of not dealing with 'real religion.' If, on the other hand, they accept anthropomorphism [or any of the other 'literalisms'], they are ridiculed as obscurantists." Harvey then briefly notes some of the strategies theologians have employed "to avoid this 'no-win' situation": appeals to analogy or symbol, the distinction between "kernel" and "husk," or demythologizing/existentialist interpre- tation (73f.). He notes that this dilemma has pretty much dominated the- ology since the Enlightenment and that it "is not easily resolved, in favor of either Feuerbach or the theologians." Significantly, Harvey himself takes no position on this dispute, acknowledging simply that however "intellectually untenable" supernaturalism is, "... to the degree that lib- erals and demythologizers have sought to make the faith compatible with our modern conception of the world, they seem to have eliminated just those elements that constitute its appeal to the ordinary, unsophisticated person" (74). He then concludes this discussion with a powerful quota- tion illustrating Feuerbach's contempt for liberal theology's emasculation of traditional, supernaturalist Christianity (74). The liberal theologian thus risks the contempt of both the naive supernaturalist (that is, the quintessential religionist if Feuerbach/Harvey are correct) and the "masters of suspicion." Yet, no more than a moment's reflection shows that there are significant problems with this position. For one thing, it is not difficult to make the case that this view of "the essence of religion" is itself naive because it identifies religion wholesale with a kind of wish-fulfilling childishness; it "infantilizes" religion essentially, and one may question whether this is descriptively accurate. It also fails to recognize that oftentimes the immediate expressions of a religion may themselves transcend or undermine such infantilism. The original forms of Buddhism are only the most obvious examples of such "sophistication" (in opposition to "naYvete"). From Christianity, one could mention: St. Paul's conception of "boasting" which undermines a naive conception of both the "law" and "wisdom"; Luther's notion of "the canon within the canon," perhaps the decisive hermeneutical principle of all Protestantism and one that undermines literalism; or Bultmann's demonstration that the "scandal" of the gospel refers not to an offense to reason but, existentially, to a deep-seated "pretension" on the part of the "natural man."4 4 See Bultmann: 121. This existentialist interpretation of the "scandal of the gospel" is what war- rants Bultmann's claim that "radical demythologizing" is "the consistent application" of "the Pauline- Lutheran doctrine of justification through faith alone without the works of the law" to "the field of knowledge" (122).</page><page sequence="7">Hardwick: Harvey's Feuerbach and the Possibility of a Liberal Theology 869 Though Harvey's heavy-handed conception of the essence of religion now seems to block liberal re-thinking of the theological task, it is still worth asking what, if any, possibilities for constructive theology emerge from his Feuerbach. This question is interesting, if for no other reason, because it returns us to an earlier, more theological (indeed, "left-liberal") Harvey. But the question is important in itself because, as it stands, the theological significance of Harvey's Feuerbach is to claim that theology has no future at all. A clue to such theological possibilities is to be found in what is perhaps the most trenchant and helpful element in Feuerbach. This concerns Harvey's identification of two strands in Feuerbach's thought (even, indeed, in the Feuerbach of Essence). One strand, of course, is Hegelian. The other Harvey identifies as a "naturalist-existentialist paradigm" (see, e.g., 21f.). This "naturalist-existentialist paradigm" is intriguing because it was precisely in terms of a method of "existentialist interpretation" that the earlier Harvey saw possibilities for liberal theo- logical construction that he now apparently rejects. Let us, therefore, examine more closely what Harvey means by a "naturalist-existentialist paradigm." Never systematically defining it, Harvey determines the meaning of this term by an overall context. By "naturalism" he simply means a position that assumes the indifference of the cosmos to human hopes and fears. Naturalism denies any metaphysical or cosmic personal being who responds to human needs as well as any final or ultimate "conservation of value" or survival of death. The "existentialist" qualification of naturalism is more troublesome. Though Harvey occasionally mentions existentialist thinkers such as Kierkegaard (and even Heidegger), he never systematically articulates why "existentialist" is a proper name for the second, non-Hegelian strand he identifies in Feuerbach. Why, we might ask, would it not be better to call it "naturalist-psychological" or "naturalist-personal"? What, spe- cifically, does the notion of "existence" add to the "naturalist" paradigm? At one point, contrasting Feuerbach to Freud, Harvey says that Feuer- bach makes more an ontological than a psychological claim (12). This, however, does not help much unless we know more about the weight Har- vey gives "ontological," and he does not really expand on this. At another point, he contrasts the Hegelian idea of essential human nature as con- sciousness of the species with "embodied subjectivity" (49) that arises in the concrete, temporal, and spatial situations that have been empha- sized by the existentialists in their characterization of human existence (see 141f.). Harvey's most systematic statement of the "existentialist" paradigm occurs in the same context where he contrasts the Hegelian paradigm with "embodied subjectivity":</page><page sequence="8">870 Journal of the American Academy of Religion The Hegelian [paradigm] contains the familiar pattern said to be intrinsic to the self-realization of Spirit: objectification-alienation-reappropri- ation. The naturalist-existentialist strand, by contrast, emphasizes (a) the embodiedness of the I-Thou relation; (b) the notion that the species is distinguished not only by consciousness but by sexuality; (c) that the encounter with nature is mediated through the I-Thou relation rather than being the first self-expression of spirit; (d) that nature is seen to be indifferent to the raging desire of the self for life; and (e) the omnipotence of feeling and wish, especially the wish for a personal god who will inter- vene in nature in the interests of the self. In this naturalist-existentialist strand, the human self is basically in the grip of feeling and desire but is confronted by the necessities of nature and, hence, death. The self longs to transcend this nature, to be saved from it. (50) Harvey is here discussing whether Feuerbach's naturalist-existentialist paradigm can be found in The Essence of Christianity and whether it can be separated from the Hegelian essentialism. Employing Kojbve's analysis of Hegel, Harvey argues that even in the early Feuerbach there are elements where the I-Thou relation and self-differentiation are set forth in "a naturalist-existentialist mode" (59). He summarizes this as involving two moments: "first, the differentiation of the self from other selves, and second, the differentiation of the self from nature. This two-fold move- ment constitutes the structure of a self-conscious biological organism whose natural instinctual drive towards self-preservation is transformed into conscious desire. This desire, in turn, takes two forms that correspond to those two moments of self-differentiation" (59, my italics). The differ- entiation from other selves is formed as a desire for recognition and love. The differentiation from nature produces the desire to view nature as amenable to our needs (and thus as ultimately personal like ourselves) or to transcend the necessities of nature entirely (see 59ff.). The point is that these two formations of "embodied, desiring subjectivity" offer an al- ternative ground for the projection of a personal, anthropomorphically conceived divine being than the Hegelian strand that predominates in Essence. Rather than defining the existentialist element systematically, Harvey thus develops its meaning by a set of motifs or family resemblances. A crucial feature involves the contrast to the Hegelian "essentialist" strand that emphasizes the differentiation of self-consciousness in the con- sciousness of the species. Indeed, the existentialist element plays down the role of consciousness entirely in defining "human being." The contrasting emphasis is on a biological organism that becomes self-conscious as its needs, fears, and desires are articulated in the concrete encounter with other selves and nature. When Harvey exploits these non-Hegelian motifs in the later Feuerbach, he never specifies the "naturalist-existentialist par-</page><page sequence="9">Hardwick: Harvey's Feuerbach and the Possibility of a Liberal Theology 871 adigm" more systematically but simply reiterates the family resemblances we have just examined. For instance: So far as the theory of religion is concerned, this insight meant that Feuerbach could increasingly minimize the Hegelian paradigm of the objectification of the idea of the species and concentrate more heavily on that naturalist-existentialist theme which had been subordinated to the Hegelian in Christianity. He could now explore the implications for reli- gion and philosophy of a philosophical anthropology in which the indi- vidual is seen as a creature haunted by death and in the grip of the desire for happiness, a creature who longs for contact with sensuous objects, on the one hand, and desire for recognition, on the other. (151) There is another significant aspect of Harvey's use of an "existen- tialist" paradigm. Comparing the later Feuerbach's development with Kierkegaard, Harvey emphasizes the concrete spatial and temporal ele- ments mentioned above. Contrasting Feuerbach's "real sensuous encoun- ters with objects and beings" that occur "in space and time" with Hegelian space as merely a "negative determination," he speaks of the following statement from Feuerbach as "remarkable in retrospect": "'To-be here (Dasein) is the primary being, the primary determination. Here I am- this is the first sign of a real livingbeing. ... Where there is no space, there is also no room for any system. The first determination of reason on which every subsequent determination can rest is to situate things"'(141, from Feuerbach:51, Feuerbach's italics). What is presumably "remarkable in retrospect" is Feuerbach's use of Dasein in a fashion made familiar by Heidegger. Following this quotation, Harvey himself persistently uses the word Dasein to refer to human being. In one sense, Harvey is simply fol- lowing Feuerbach's own usage, but it is difficult not to believe that he is self-consciously exploiting the existentialist resonances. This conclusion gains support from another feature of Harvey's usage. Harvey is quite consistent and presumably self-conscious in always using the term "existentialist" when speaking of his "naturalist-existentialist" paradigm or otherwise in referring to "existentialist" motifs (see, e.g., 171). This is significant because in most of these contexts it would be less awkward in English to use the adjective "existential." Given the allusion to Heidegger's Dasein, Harvey's use of "existentialist" seems self-consciously technical and reflects his appreciation for the Heideggarian distinction between the existentiell level of enactment and the existential level of analysis in a fundamental ontology. This central Heideggarian distinction was appropriated by Bultmann and played a significant role in his con- ception of "existentialist interpretation."5 This conclusion is supported 5 See Heidegger:32f. For technical discussions of this distinction, especially in its theological appli- cation, see Hardwick 1972:XXVII-XXXIV; and Hardwick 1996:76, n. 1, 93-97.</page><page sequence="10">872 Journal of the American Academy of Religion further by Harvey's articles on "existence," "existential," "existentialism," and, especially, " existenziell" in A Handbook of Theological Terms where he shows himself fully aware of these technical issues (Harvey 1964:91-94). Given Harvey's awareness of this linguistic subtlety, it seems appropriate to infer that he intends his notion of a "naturalist-existentialist" strand in Feuerbach to stand in direct continuity with this technical yet significant element in both existentialist philosophy and theology. Though Harvey certainly does not depart from a suspicious interpre- tation of religion in Feuerbach, it is significant that his most important innovation in the interpretation of Feuerbach, his notion of a "naturalist- existentialist" paradigm, has this kind of continuity with a crucial con- ception in contemporary Bultmannian existentialist, liberal theology. Furthermore, it is precisely this strand of contemporary liberal theology with which Harvey himself was most closely aligned in his earlier "left- liberal" theological phase, as is so powerfully apparent from the conclud- ing chapters of The Historian and the Believer. Actually, from time to time Harvey himself briefly hints at alternative theological strategies in formulas of great power-even if now, in Feuer- bach, he rejects them and their theological underpinnings. Thus, for instance, discussing the dilemma of modern liberal theology, he describes "demythologizing" as arguing "that mythological language itself expresses a way of understanding oneself in the world that is not itself supernatural- istic and which can be appropriated" (73f., my italics). Similarly, in Hand- book, speaking of existentialist theologians, he says: "The self, they argue, is a unity of radical freedom and limitedness, and faith is the acceptance of this paradoxical unity. But faith is not the possession of a creed or a doctrine, nor is it belief; it is, rather, the decision to be oneself as this per- son in this situation, a decision that must be made again and again. This decision is made possible by the gracious and unconditional acceptance of man by God which enables man to have the courage to be himself" (Har- vey 1964:93f., Harvey's italics). From another context in Feuerbach he remarks on how compatible "Feuerbach's existentialist paradigm of faith" would be for many contem- porary theologians: Many theologians . . . could accept Feuerbach's analysis of the I con- fronted by the not-I and the religious feeling this confrontation awakens. They could also accept the analysis of the role of anxiety, the will to life, and the desire for recognition and meaning. They, too, believe that the decision of faith is whether to believe that the circumambient powers of nature that impinge on the self from within and without are the actions of a benign and unified whole or the outworkings of chance. (195) He then shows how close Schleiermacher and H. Richard Niebuhr are to such a near-naturalist conception and says: "For Niebuhr faith is the de-</page><page sequence="11">Hardwick: Harvey's Feuerbach and the Possibility of a Liberal Theology 873 cision to put one's confidence in this 'X, this abyss into which all things plunge" (196). Finally, at the very end of Feuerbach Harvey describes Becker's ambivalence toward religious thinkers such as Kierkegaard and Tillich: "The meaninglessness of existence, Becker argued, is what hu- mans must face. Consequently, any truly life-enhancing illusion must forsake the ideal of 'a creature who is transformed and who transforms the world in turn in some miraculous ways' in favor of a creature who 'takes more of the world into himself and develops new forms of courage and endurance'." Noting how compatible this is with Feuerbach, he then continues: "The human problem is to develop new forms of courage and endurance in the face of meaninglessness, if by meaninglessness it is meant that the universe is utterly indifferent to individual human welfare and that no creature can be miraculously redeemed or redeem the world" (306, my italics, from Becker: 279). In all of these instances, however, the Harvey of Feuerbach draws back. He continues to make the theological assumption that the sole con- dition for the adequacy of such formulas is a world that conforms to the essence of religion naively conceived, a world, that is, that supports a "faith that each one of [us] is the object of a personal, divine subject who transcends nature and who will, in the end, enable [us] to transcend it also" (309). Thus, in reference to the Becker formulations above, Harvey notes that after all Feuerbach would have rejected such a conception of a religious confrontation with "meaninglessness" because "it is the essence of religion to believe that the universe is not utterly indifferent and that human beings can be miraculously redeemed" (306). The same is true with other recent theologians such as Schleiermacher, Niebuhr, Bult- mann, Buri, and Tillich. Harvey takes for granted that such alternative conceptions of faith are possible only because these thinkers assume that "the circumambient powers of nature" "are the actions of a benign and unified whole" (195), so that "the great Void into which all things tumble" can ultimately be viewed "as the great companion" (196). Harvey is probably correct about these theologians. They do seem to assume that the existential possibility of a faith "that can affirm the con- tingency of life without despair" is possible only if there is a "great com- panion" that grounds faith by an "acceptance of acceptance" (see 195). In other words, both they and Harvey assume that such alternative concep- tions of faith are possible only on non-naturalist philosophical grounds. But these metaphysical and ontological assumptions are not given with an existentialist analysis of faith itself. That conception, which Van Harvey has so powerfully helped mediate to the English-speaking world, requires simply that we understand faith as a self-understanding of ourselves in the world. The option that both Harvey and contemporary theology fail to explore is whether that conception of faith may not be intelligible in a</page><page sequence="12">874 Journal of the American Academy of Religion world that is precisely as naturalists assume it is.6 Therein lies the promise of Harvey's own earlier adoption of an existentialist method. Theologians need not reject Harvey's and Feuerbach's view of the "essence of religion" as a first take. But theologians must reject their claim that the religious impulse can take no other shape than those infantile forms required by their conception of religion's essence. If indeed there is a religious impulse as deeply embedded in human nature as Feuerbach and Harvey (and Freud and many others) assume, then we cannot simply make it go away by suspicious interpretation. We also need not assume that the only alternative for a mature humanity on the far side of sus- picious interpretation is to resist its infantile religious impulses by a clenched fist, gritted teeth bitterness, and defiance at the indifference of the universe. There is no reason why our inherent, infantile religious impulses may not be sublimated into less infantile forms of experience, valuation, and hope, as we advance into a future that surely, Harvey and I would agree, offers nothing but a naturalistic view of reality. The signifi- cance of Harvey's Feuerbach for the theological community is to have posed this issue once again, as in Feuerbach's time, with unmatched ana- lytic power. Its weakness is its failure to explore these theological possibili- ties on the far side of suspicious interpretation that were promised by his own earlier work.
