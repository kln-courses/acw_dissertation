<plain_text><page sequence="1">(Fl)orality, Gender, and the Environmental Ethos of Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale Deborah Hooker Before the revelation in the "Historical Notes" that what we've been reading is a transcript of tapes discovered in a footlocker in Bangor, Maine (301), most of us attend to the words of Atwood's protagonist innocently enough: our familiarity with the ways of the first-person narrator largely annuls any sense of the paradox involved in reading the signs of Offred's putative orality; that is, until the epilogue pointedly reminds us that we have been reading. Those "Historical Notes" also resolve an issue that might never have been raised in their absence: how the words of a char acter denied books and writing end up on the page. Thus, like Gilead's oral/literate divide and Offred's suggestive name, the epilogue also asks us to consider the spell of the printed word under which we have been and are proceeding. That spell has been discussed at length by scholars like Walter Ong and Eric Havelock. In his reading ofAtwood's novel, Mario Klarer draws on their work to demonstrate how the oral/literate divide serves Gilead as a "gender-supporting" device (129). If, as Ong and Havelock contend, the capacity for abstract thought and a potentially revolutionary historical perspective depend on the "perspectival distance" provided by the writ ten word, then an imposed orality atrophies both in Gilead's women. By creating the sense of existing in a "permanent present" or within the bounds of cyclical time, orality also diminishes any impetus for altering the regime's oppressive gendered arrangement (Klarer 133).1 In the con text of Gilead's political hierarchy, then, literacy confers a specifically male Twentieth-Century Literature 52.3 Fall 2006 275</page><page sequence="2">Deborah Hooker agency, and orality contributes to a feminine subjugation to that agency. While Klarer is undeniably correct about the liabilities of nonliteracy, his reading nevertheless tends to reduce Offred's richly nuanced narrative to little more than a declaration of gendered sociopolitical inferiority. Given that Offred is on the side of the good and the poetic, I would argue that her orality serves as an equally emphatic topos for exploring some of the liabilities that have accrued as we have interiorized writing and print, and for speculating on what the future interiorizing of electronic inscrip tion might mean.2 Moreover, when Oifred identifies flowers as the "good things" in an otherwise "sad ... and sordid" story and asks "Where would we be without them?" (267) she points to the crucial narrative element organizing this exploration of a changing linguistic imaginary. The centrality of flowers to a thematics of literacy and orality is sig naled in what Marta Carminero-Santangelo identifies as Offred's "first true verbal transgression" (30), an act that gathers the handmaid into the resistance movement's fragile coalition. In front of the Soul Scrolls, the twined emblem of Gilead's commercial and theological rigor, Of fred risks a heretical "No" to Ofglen's question: does she believe that "God listens . . . to these machines?" (168). In response, Ofglen reveals the subversive connotations of a word she had offered up in conversation before-May Day. This bilingual signifier collates the French imperative m'aidez (help me) with the English for a pre-Christian celebration of spring's floral profusion and the cyclical fertility those blossoms represent. Invoking this pagan gestalt and the flowers so essential to its polytheistic rituals signals May Day's challenge to Gilead's autocratic Old Testament monotheism. But if monotheism is, as Ong and Havelock imply, at least in part an effect of protoalphabetic literacy,4 then by subversively invoking a largely preliterate world, May Day also points to the novel's flowers as a significant topos for exploring the oral/literate divide. The abundant floral imagery in The Handmaid's Tale, in fact, consti tutes an allusive metanarrative that comments not only on the novel's construction but also on what Marshall McLuhan calls the "unconscious effects" of the technologized word (6). With the flower as a constant in these allusions, Atwood's narrative traverses the history of such effects. Offred's central garden meditation, for example, evokes two largely contemporaneous transcriptions of pre-Christian oral works-Hesiod's Theogony and the Homeric Hymn to Demeter-both of which position the flower as a central figure in orality's synesthetic linguistic gestalt.5 The 276</page><page sequence="3">(Fl)orality, Gender, and the Environmental Ethos of The Handmaid's Tale floral iconography Gilead employs in its resurrection of Old Testament Christianity illustrates the effects of chirography and textualization on this prior gestalt. Other floral moments in the text mark later thresholds in this technological chronology-the advent of print in the fifteenth century and Western culture's later interiorization of that technology in the late eighteenth century-concluding in our current and increas ingly electronic dispensation. Through the altered status of its flowers, this allusive chronology foregrounds the literate effects that contribute to environmental ruin and the sexual, social, and theological "containment" of women. I do not mean, nor do I think Atwood means, to equate that (fl)oral, mythological gestalt with some idyllic golden age: Western myth, which, like Offred's putatively oral narrative, comes to us by means of transcrip tion, abounds in violence and passionate excess. However, some feminist scholarship suggests that power and agency in the polytheistic world were not so starkly aligned with masculinity (Ochshorn 14-16) as they were to become under monotheism, and, I would argue, under its secular analogue in the Western rational tradition.While it would also be ludicrous to deny literacy's substantial benefits, what can be examined, and what I think this novel examines, is its role in the construction of secular and theological dispensations that depend on a "devalued and sharply demarcated sphere of otherness" in which "a gendered reason/nature contrast appears as the overarching, most general, basic and connecting form" (Plumwood 44). Ong correctly asserts that "to live and to understand fully, we need not only proximity but also distance" from a "natural milieu," which "writing provides" for us "as nothing else does" (Orality 82). However, if language in its oral state inaugurates that distance from Ong's "natural milieu" or, as psychoanalysis has taught us, from the "matter" of the maternal body, then by constructing Gilead as a profoundly eye-dominated society, Atwood asks us to consider the effects of the "analytic, dissecting tendencies" of "the inscribed, visualized word" as it amplifies that inaugural interposition over and against the "aggregative (harmonizing) tendencies" of what Ong calls a "sound-dominated verbal economy" (Orality 73-74)-or the oral, mythological gestalt in which, as Offred reminds us in the novel's central garden passage, "goddesses are possible" (153). Any argument critiquing the ways in which writing's "analytic, dissecting tendencies" inflect the discourses it enables has, however, to acknowledge that language itself is an inherently differential system. As 277</page><page sequence="4">Deborah Hooker Will Wright observes, it not only functions by "impos[ing] a structure of symbolic differences" (200) but also models an abstracting, transcendent impulse by encouraging classification or categorization. Using language involves not only the recognition of a "particular experience of differ ence" (203), such as distinctions between male and female or human and animal, but also the appeal to the next higher category of experience that includes and coordinates these differences-the classification of the human being as a language user, for example.6 However, institutionalized values conferred by "tradition, religion, ... law, and the like" furnish the specific characteristics of any particular "transcendent order" or category (203). The shift from primary orality to chirography and then to print suggests that the transcendent categories connecting and coordinating these differences underwent a series of profound transformations of the sort traced by Atwood's floral motif. Investigations of the technologized word suggest that these transfor mations result, at least in part, from the abstract form that phonetic, alpha betic signifiers subsequently acquired and the privileging of vision over all the other senses that writing confers. For example, in his examination of both the Hebraic aleph-beth and the later Greek alphabet, David Abram documents the increasing detachment of written signifiers from a prior state of environmental referentiality. When the aleph-beth "reduc[ed] the necessary number of characters for a written script to just twenty-two," (100), it eased the constraint-the confusing welter of pictographs and hieroglyphs-that had restricted literacy to highly specialized commer cial or religious castes.7 While these prior forms of inscription "already involved a displacement of our sensory participation from the depths of the animate environment" to inscribed surfaces, they "still referred, im plicitly, to the animate phenomenon" each glyph pictured. For the first time, however, the aleph-beth establishes a "direct association ... between the pictorial sign and the vocal gesture ... completely bypassing the thing pictured" (101). Ong also credits this newly accessible phonetic script with unleashing the mental energy formerly bound up in the monumen tal task of oral remembering, "opening the psyche as never before not only to the external objective world quite distinct from itself but also the interior self against whom the objective world is set"; in its wake arise "the great introspective religious traditions of Buddhism,Judaism, Chris tianity, and Islam" (Orality 105).This new reflexitity, however, promoted a single, unembodied, all-seeing god, whose masculine profile persists to this 278</page><page sequence="5">(Fl)orality, Gender, and the Environmental Ethos of The Handmaid's Tale day-the theological imaginary that Gilead imposes with a vengeance. The unembodied, abstract singularity of that omniscient standard would also find its later, secular analogue in the fixed forms of Greek idealism, itself an effect of further abstraction, when the Greeks excised the residual pictographic elements of the Hebraic aleph-beth in the fifth to fourth century BCE. "Nowhere," notes Martin Jay, "has the visual seemed so dominant as in that remarkable Greek invention called philosophy" (24), whose new binarisms oppose a positive, masculine transcendence to the unfocused, irrational ontology of the mythological, nature, and women. Along with the abstraction of written signifiers from an environmen tal referent, visual dominance itself reconfigures the place of the body and the environment, concepts with which women have traditionally been aligned in epistemological discourse. In primary orality, as Ong argues, spoken words are "always modifications of a total, existential situation, which always engages the body" (Orality 67-68). Meaning, adds Jean Joseph Goux, derives from a contextual field that includes vocal tonality, "facial expressions, gestures, the whole of the body" (10) as well as the place of the utterance; it is a synesthetic experience in which, according to Marshall McLuhan, our individual senses are "endlessly translated into one another" (5).When the phonetic alphabet reduces the "use of all the senses at once, which is oral speech, to a merely visual code" (45) and when writing increasingly circulates in place of embodied voice, textual meaning is increasingly divorced from these bodily and environmental contexts. It is encoded in visual signs that, in the case of the phonetic alphabet, represent human-only sounds. And because language "not only stores but translates experience from one mode into another" (5), visual primacy alters the metaphorical field that is language, installing a "new habit of perception" (23) that permeates all linguistic translations of experience. In Ongs's account, alphabetic literacy's emphatically visual "habit of perception" displaced an oral epistemology "consonant with aggregative (harmonizing) tendencies rather than with analytic, dissecting tendencies (which would come with the inscribed, visualized word: vision is a dissecting sense)" (Orality 73-74). Orality's "situational ... rather than abstract thinking" and its "humanistic organization of knowledge around the actions of humans and anthropomorphic beings ... rather than around impersonal things" (74) also come to be epistemologically downplayed. In the newly bifurcated epistemology that philosophical discourse enunciates, "Knowledge (eidenai)," says Bruno Snell, is increasingly figured 279</page><page sequence="6">Deborah Hooker as "the state of having seen" (198). "Femaleness" is then aligned, Gen evieve Lloyd suggests, "with what Reason supposedly left behind-the dark powers of the earth goddesses, immersion in unknown forces asso ciated with mysterious female powers" (2). The prior oral, mythological experience of the environment as "mysteriously animate and alive, filled with immanent powers" (Abram 108) is also subsequently revalued as primitivism, as a childish nostalgia for that which has really never been, or for falsehood itself. It is precisely this animate, mythological, preliterate landscape that Atwood places at the center of her novel, in the scene most resplendent with flowers. Offred's paean to the lush effusions of Serena Joy's garden and to the memories of gardens past that it resurrects is arguably the novel's most vivid and certainly most lyrical passage, a sensuous, synes thetic experience of language in marked contrast to the "toneless metallic" iterations of the computerized Soul Scrolls, for example. Despite Serena Joy's persistent presence in the garden, where she displaces her rage at her merely ceremonial part in Gilead's procreational design by "snipping off the seedpods" of various flowers, Offred insists on the garden's splendor: she rhapsodizes about the irises, rising beautiful and cool on their tall stalks ... the darker ones, velvet and purple, black cat's ears in the sun ... and the bleeding hearts, so female in shape it was a surprise they'd not long since been rooted out. (153) I will explore the negative valences evoked by some of these images later. Here, however, I want to begin tracing the parallel transformations of the flower, as a central signifier in the preliterate linguistic imaginary, and women, when the bifurcated logic of visualized speech begins to dominate. For the garden not only evokes the mythological domain but dramatizes its shifting and metamorphic, oral gestalt, where the senses are "endlessly translated into one another."8 The "languid" scents of the garden, for example, evoke the word swoon. The visual transformation of "tree into bird," the "movements, in the branches" around Offred, the "feathers, flittings," are perceived aurally as "grace notes." This musical benediction, this transformative, implicitly poetic potential also impacts the body, for in the garden, "the air suffuses with desire" (153).9 In con trast to Gilead's rigidly circumscribed roles for women-as handmaids, wives, Marthas, or Jezebels-Offred's oral, synesthetic experience of the 280</page><page sequence="7">(Fl)orality, Gender, and the Environmental Ethos of The Handmaid's Tale mythologically resonant garden suggests a world of more fluid subjec tivities, where the boundaries between the human and natural world are not so rigidly drawn, a realm in which, she declares, "metamorphoses run wild." And Oifred associates this metamorphic freedom to move and change with an ethos that accommodates female divinity, for in the garden,at this moment, she tells us,"Goddesses are possible" (153). Finally and most significantly, however, the garden speaks to Offred, again with somatic effect: the willow in "full plumage ... whispers: Ren dezvous, it says, terraces; the sibilants run up [her] spine, a shiver as if in fever" (153). Offred's experience of this speaking garden constitutes the novel's first floral, mythological allusion, inasmuch as it suggests a scenario similar to what Jeffrey Walker identifies as "the earliest account on record, at least in the West, of the relationship between the eloquence of prince and bard" (3)-Hesiod's eighth-century BCE Theogony. Predating the dominance of alphabetic literacy by about 300 years, and thus "presum ably, first recited and then written down, not to be read but to be listened to" (Hine 1), Hesiod's poem of nearly 1,000 lines offers an account of the world's creation in terms of various sexual and asexual "begettings" of elemental divinities like Chaos, Gaia, and Eros, and concludes with the divine genealogy culminating in the supremacy of Zeus. It begins, how ever, with an invocation of the Muses, where its depiction of eloquence is, significantly, identical to an ethical speech that depends on the labor of women and flowers; like the willows' word rendezvous, the poem depicts the force of that (fl)oral eloquence as socially centripetal, mirroring its creatively aggregative oral phenomenology. In Hesiod, the Muses bestow the gift of eloquence by "pour[ing] sweet distillation" on the tongue of prince and bard, ensuring that the "words from his mouth flow honeyed" (Walker 3).10 This honeyed speech is, in Ong's terminology, aggregative. It is also erotic, a centripetal force that sustains imperiled human bonds. Such a floral figuration also suggests a culture intimately if not scientifi cally aware of the natural mechanisms to which it owes its survival, to the causal chain linking what Jack Goody calls "the emergence of wild flowers" to the "emergence of man [sic] himself" (4): the "concentrated food, the nectar and pollen" that flowers produce summoned insects to pollinate the fruits and seeds that fed larger animals and thus sustained human populations dependent on both plant and animal sources of food (3-4). In Hesiod's figuration of the mythological linguistic imaginary, good 281</page><page sequence="8">Deborah Hooker words, socially effective words, work by analogy to these floral processes sustaining human and more-than-human life. Thus, the landscape can be perceived to speak, to communicate a paradigm of wisdom that can be transferred to a human cohort: the environment functions as more than a backdrop for the drama of a singularly human intentionality. Hesiod's figuration of linguistic effect, like Offred's garden experience, also encodes the synesthetic drama of orality, invoking the senses of touch and implic itly taste and smell in the processes whereby "sweet distillations" are laid on the tongues of men. In both, the word is experienced as part of an interactive linguistic and environmental drama, not merely, as in alphabetic literacy, "a countersign of thought" (Ong, Orality 32). Since Hesiod's oral ethic is enabled by the labor of women, who transmit the "sweet distilla tion" from flowers to men, and since the Muses are typically represented as either dancing or picking flowers, that floral activity functions as an implicit and necessary link in the floral, casual chain of ethical speech. If Hesiod's Theogony dramatizes an imaginary of language acknowl edging the labor of women and the centrality of the flower in a linguistic paradigm of environment reciprocity, then the most pervasive floral sub text of The Handmaid's Tale, the Persephone myth, dramatizes the rupture of this ethical relationship."1 Atwood's flowers are central to this evocation of linguistic change, which is also the story of anguished mothers and abducted daughters. For example, Offred first catches sight of the Com mander, an analogue of the mythical Pluto or Hades, in an interior, floral landscape. Stepping into the upstairs hallway outside her room, where the "sun comes through the fanlight, falling in colors across the floor: red, blue and purple ... [Her] hands ... fill with flowers of light" (49), foreshadowing a fate similar to Persephone's. During one of her ritual baths, Offred is also resituated as Demeter. There, the forget-me-nots on the bathroom's wallpaper frame the nearly unbearable evocations of her daughter's presence: "I close my eyes, and she's there with me, suddenly, without warning" (63). In other moments too, memory clothes her daughter in a "small green nightgown with the sunflower on the front" (109). For female readers the Persephone myth has always conveyed a dis turbing and seemingly implacable message about the apparent giveness of female sexual vulnerability. When Offred compares herself to that most familiar fairy-tale figure who is, like Persephone, jeopardized by flowers, she underscores the obvious applicability of that message to her 282</page><page sequence="9">(Fl)orality, Gender, and the Environmental Ethos of The Handmaid's Tale life in Gilead: like Little Red Riding Hood "in a red cloak," Offred is constantly "descending towards a moment of carelessness that is the same as danger" (9). But it is this transformation of the flower into a dangerous object that is significant here: unlike Hesiod's representation of the (fl)oral linguistic imaginary, here flowers categorically lead "off the path." This new connotation, in fact, suggests the overturning of a certain gestalt in which, as some feminist research suggests, female powerlessness was not de rigueur.While she is careful to note that "sexually egalitarian concepts in religious belief and even in religious practices do not necessarily signify sexual equality in social structure" (14),Judith Ochshorn's examination of cuneiform texts and other artifacts from the prealphabetic world suggests that sexual distinctions were "less important than other social or indi vidual concerns"; characteristics that were "emphasized, valued, feared or despised" were "common to both men and women" (14). "Fear of female biology and sexuality," she also notes, was "conspicuously absent" (15), thus suggesting fewer institutionalized mechanisms bent on constraining those forces.12 Atwood's allusions to the Persephone myth, which is largely con temporaneous with Hesiod's Theogony and much more recent than the texts examined by Ochshorn, show the homologous transformation of women and nature as Hesiod's floral, linguistic drama is altered. From Hesiod's figuration of women as agents in a floral ethic of eloquence we move to a scenario in which a woman is entrapped by the very signifier of that prior ethical environmental relationship and implicitly captured within a new erotic paradigm characterized by female vulnerability. As Zeus's daughter, Persephone is structurally parallel to Hesiod's Muses, but unlike them, she is seized in that moment of"muse-ical" agency, picking flowers. In the Hymn to Demeter the natural object by which the Muses formerly endowed the good ruler with an erotic eloquence is used to entrap the daughter, who is herself identified with "the narcissus / which Earth grew as a snare for the flower-faced maiden / a flower wondrous and bright, awesome for all to see" (lines 7-10).13 Perhaps this reversal accounts for why, in Atwood's novel, the flower quite often signifies a wound, on the bodies of men as well as women. Wounded bodies coalesce most vividly around the red of an oft-invoked tulip: "the one red smile" on the hood of the anonymous body hanging on the wall, executed for his crimes against the state, "is the same as the red of the tulips in Serena Joy's garden" (33). Ofired similarly imagines the 283</page><page sequence="10">Deborah Hooker face of her missing husband Luke with a "wound ... the color of tulips, near the stem end, down the left side of his face where the flesh split recently" (105). As others have noted, however, Offred works assiduously to avoid conflating the actual tulips and these figurations: the tulips in the garden, she asserts, "are not tulips of blood, the red smiles are not flowers, neither thing makes a comment on the other" (33).14 While the red of the tulip and the blood of those persecuted by Gilead are related, if only by the intensity of that redness, Offred's efforts to separate their significations represent her refusal to let the flower be reduced to a signifier for brutality. While the flower marks the site of a particular wound for both men and women in their imaginary structura tions of their real relationship with the natural world, it also retains the trace of that prior, displaced relationship where the flower, as in Hesiod, signified a communal ethos. But the Persephone myth seems to record the dissection of that prior oral, synesthetic epistemology. In the Hymn, vi sion achieves epistemological prominence and power: only Hellos, gazing "through the bright air / on the whole of the earth and the sea" (69-70), is privy to all that has happened. Offred again invokes Persephone's fate and the dechne of that prior floral linguistic imaginary when she describes "the flowers of high summer ... starting us on the long downward slope to fall" (270). The coercive ethos of the myth is also echoed in the move ment between the two flowers she names in this "downward slope," both with prominent but distinctly different "eyes": from the yellow, heliotro pic eye of the daisies we move to black-eyed Susans (270) with all the brutality resonant in that colloquial floral name. Offred's story obviously recapitulates Persephone's in terms of sexual seizure; both are brutally thrust into new dispensations signified by an altered relationship to the flower as emblem of the oral linguistic imaginary. When Offred likens the "circle of flowers" on the ceiling of her bedroom to an apocalyptic "hole in space where a star exploded" (200), that floral metaphor, like the tulips, reinscribes the effects of this mythological cataclysm within the handmaid's life. McLuhan reminds us that myths are "succinct statement[s] of a com plex social process that had occurred over a period of centuries" (25), and as originally oral narratives, Hesiod's Theogony and the Hymn to Demeter are only available to us through written transcription. Choosing a par ticular version to cite, moreover, is to arbitrarily freeze the elements of a formerly ever-changing oral story. Therefore, while I cannot definitively 284</page><page sequence="11">(Fl)orality, Gender, and the Environmental Ethos of The Handmaid's Tale claim that Homer's version follows Hesiod's, I can point out a posteriori how together they suggest a trajectory consolidated in a later and increas ingly literate culture.While there are, no doubt, many social mechanisms that produce this floral distinction within two largely contemporaneous myths, one explanation for this distinction is that the alienation from a natural milieu was already at work in their written transmission. What ever the actual case,Atwood's floral figurations cumulatively suggest that as vision begins to dominate, at least in part by virtue of the inscribed, visualized word, the concept of woman undergoes a reciprocal condensa tion or circumscription. This circumscription is conveyed by the elision in Homer's phrase, which gathers the narcissus and Persephone into one floral body: each is the "flower wondrous and bright." In the new, written dispensation, woman becomes the site preserving all that was signified by this once-dominant perceptual and linguistic paradigm; we all still speak, of course; but epistemological privilege inheres on the side of literacy, with its distance from mythology's cyclical and "natural milieu." Another way of saying this is that Western binarisms situate woman as the recu perative site of a residual awareness of bodily dependence on flowers and the female deities associated with them in the cycles sustaining environ mental and human life. When, for example, Offred describes the sexual activity of the Com manders as "this bee to flower thing" (162), she draws on a range of sexually polarized concepts that have become staples of Western literary tradition. Despite the empirical evidence of floral hermaphrodism, the female body is routinely troped as the vulnerable, desirable flower; sex with a virgin is figured as defloration; in recent popular discourse, gay men are derogated as "pansies." These constructions suggest, as Ong has argued, that "the elements out of which a term is originally built usually, and probably always, linger somehow in subsequent meanings, perhaps obscurely but often powerfully and even irreducibly" (Orality 12). Con nections between feminine sexuality and the flower have been estabhshed not only through aesthetic similarities-delicacy and the transience of beauty, for example-but also, I would argue, through alterations in lin guistic paradigms as well, which inflect the content of language's differ ential and transcendent categories.And in the literate dispensation, access to the floral site as well as the site itself must be stringently controlled. The appropriation of the handmaid's sexuality serves as a most extreme example of the by-now familiar societal prescriptions for con 285</page><page sequence="12">Deborah Hooker trolling the female body. In the novel, familiar floral terms figure this ap propriation, suggesting that, along with a more reciprocal relationship to the environment, another casualty of the epochal shift from primary oral ity to literacy was the loss, for women, of some sexual and social agency. For example, when Jeannine gives birth and her daughter is taken from her and presented to a Wife, this official mother receives the child as if it were "a bouquet.... Something she's won, a tribute" (126). Offred simi larly describes the siren of the birthmobile announcing Jeannine's labor in a manner not only evoking the essential physical process of that labor but one that synesthetically associates that appropriated birth with sound, not sight: the siren is an "opening out, like a flower of sound opening" (11 1).Another floral emblem affirming the "reduced" (105) status of the handmaids adorns the wall of Offred's room: a typographically reproduced "print of flowers, blue irises, watercolor," originally painted by hand. And she wonders, "Does each of us have the same print ... Government is sue?" (7). Like replicas of an original painting, when Offred and the other handmaids circulate in Gilead, all of their individual idiosyncrasies and desires are obliterated. In a society that seeks to control the "flowering of secret lusts" (136), the handmaid's prescriptive language-their strict call and response to one another-and the children born of state-sanctioned rape are similarly controlled and, like the typographically iterated flower prints, strictly "government issue." If literacy and its rational effects alienate "man [sic] from ... his origi nal lifeworld," as Ong proposes (Interfaces 18), then that alienation also creates the desire for what has now been displaced: the more materially embedded oral gestalt, where "goddesses are possible." Fantasies of the female suture the gap, but only if "she" remains subordinate in the new rational hierarchy. Atwood demonstrates the alignment of women with an intellectually discredited but strategically useful mythology in her depic tion of the women ofJezebel's, Gilead's brothel for its elite.When she is taken to Jezebel's as an "evening rental" (233), Offred discovers her old friend Moira among the prostitutes. Echoing the metamorphoses alluded to in the garden episode, she immediately remarks on Moira's "bedraggled costume": "attached to [Moira's] head are two ears, of a rabbit or deer."A "wad of cotton"-"it's supposed to be a tail" (239)-completes this mock Ovidian metamorphosis from human to animal. Moira's costume also subsequently comments on the other, modern, less recognizably Ovidian costumes-the "bathing suits," the "lingerie," the "cheerleader's outfits" 286</page><page sequence="13">(Fl)orality, Gender, and the Environmental Ethos of The Handmaid's Tale (235). Jezebel's variously costumed prostitutes not only emphasize the overwhelming role of vision's "analytical, dissecting tendencies" in incit ing masculine desire but literalize Irigaray's contention about the place of the female in that paradigm: her role is that of a "masquerade," which allows her "to experience desire not in her own right but as the man's desire situates her" (220). Or, as Offred says about her entire subjective reconstruction in Gilead, "the flesh arranges itself differently" (73). As the handmaids and the whores of Gilead demonstrate, the agency of women in both categories, explicitly lined up on the side of nature-one as a "mythological" creature and the other as "natural resource" (65)-is irrel evant. "She" has no plan of her own, nothing to contribute but her body for sexual enjoyment, for replenishing the tribe or "stimulat[ing] trade" (237) among men. Like nature, each woman has become a "terra nullius, a resource empty of its own purposes or meanings, and hence available to be annexed for the purposes of those supposedly identified with reason or intellect" (Plumwood 4). In this assignment of the mythological or the natural to women, there is, however, something both true and untrue: everyone is embedded in nature. It is the assignment of that embedded ness to women only and the subordination of her body and all that it represents within a masculinized, rational hierarchy that is the distortion of a binary logic effected, in part, by literacy's visual dominance. Like the subversive code word May Day, Offred's frequent surprise that "flowers are still allowed" (7), that they had not been "rooted out" (153), also points to flowers as inherently antithetical to all that Gilead represents. Flowers, in fact, pervade the novel, signifying resistance to Gil ead's agenda but also providing a backdrop for many of the novel's most explicit scenes of sexual exploitation-at Jezebel's and in the Command er's bedroom and sitting room, for example. I would argue that "flowers are still allowed" because Gilead can depend on the way monotheism has fundamentally "renatured" flowers to serve its own particular ends. And literacy again plays an essential role in this conversion. Offred's surprise reminds us that at its inception, the Old Testa ment monotheism that Gilead's theocracy emulates largely defined itself against the flower as emblematic of the pagan other-another clue that the choice of the May Day code word is not an innocent one. Goody asserts that the denigration of most flowers as threateningly sensual and potentially idolatrous objects has its roots in the earliest attempts by Ju daic and later Christian sects to distinguish themselves from their pagan 287</page><page sequence="14">Deborah Hooker neighbors in whose ceremonies and sacrifices to multiple male and fe male gods flowers played a ubiquitous role (75). As the Historians of the epilogue remind us, however, "no new system can impose itself upon a previous one without incorporating many of the elements to be found in the latter" (305). Despite their threateningly pagan connotations, then, flowers could not be altogether eschewed by Gilead's Old Testament pre decessors: at the botanical level, they signal an essential stage in the cycle of agricultural reproduction, a recognition reflected in the floral rituals invoking fertility goddesses such as Demeter or Cybele.WhileJudaic and later Christian culture "avoided celebrating the mere pleasurable beauty of flowers" common in pagan culture, alphabetic literacy helped to re construct these flowers "along with all natural things, as signs of God's overarching plan in creation" (Knight 7). They were fixed as signs to be interpreted, "lessons" in a nature now textualized as a"book" reflecting a divine intentionality. The effects of this new textualization are revealed in Offred's reaction to the Old Testament floral icons Gilead deploys in lieu of written signs. When Offred identifies one of the Old Testament floral icons, the "huge wooden sign ... in the shape of a golden lily," indicating the store where the handmaids can "order dresses" (24), it is precisely the emphasis on this flower as a fixed sign that points to the transformation of the former fluid imaginary of orality and its associated gestalt. In primary orality, Ong notes, "the spoken word is always an event, a movement in time, completely lacking in the thing-like repose of the written or printed word" (Orality 75); language is envisioned as motion, writes Havelock, "as a stream flowing (as in Hesiod)" for example (113). Our closest analogue to such an experience would, I think, be music.With writing, this muse ical imaginary is "replaced by a vision of a fixed row of letters," where "the single word" is detached "from the flow of the utterance" and rec ognized "as a separate 'thing"' (Havelock 113).This arresting of language into fixed sign is precisely the effect depicted in the Persephone myth when her "musical" agency, the oral "flow of language," the entire drama associated with that prior oral gestalt signified in the picking of flowers, is interrupted by her abduction. This new technological fixity conferred by the textualized word in stantiates hierarchical distinctions between mind and body and mind and nature, of which the transcendent, monotheistic God is one manifestation. As Abram explains it, the "process of learning to read and to write with 288</page><page sequence="15">(Fl)orality, Gender, and the Environmental Ethos of The Handmaid's Tale the alphabet" creates "a new, profoundly reflexive, sense of self" charac terized by the "relative independence of one's verbal, speaking self from the breathing body with its shifting needs" (112). Such a newly "literate self cannot help but feel its own transcendence and timelessness relative to the fleeting world of corporeal experience." The separate observing self, the self that is aware of self, can now be posited as separate from the world that it observes. In the theological register, this independence cor relates with a view of nature as a reflection of the mind of god, which, unlike nature, is presumed to be unchanging. All natural objects and their functions are now presumed to mirror the will of that "absolute source assumed to exist entirely beyond, or outside of, the bodily world" (94), an interpretation of nature reinforced by centuries of religious exegesis. The profound ideological hold of this alphabetic effect in the context of gender is illustrated by Offred's reaction to the Old Testament floral icons.When she identifies the lilies of the field as the sign of the stores where handmaids can order dresses, she reminds us that "habits" is a "good word for them" (24). The word habits not only alludes to her blood-red dress, which confers her quasi-religious status as a kind of sexual nun, married to God's proxy in the form of Gilead's Commanders, but it also alludes to the ideological hold of the traditional associations and behaviors reflected in those Old Testament icons, the mental habits that Gilead obvi ously finds useful and which Offred struggles daily to resist.To accept the selfless anonymity of labor implied in that emblematic, politically correct lily would be to acquiesce to her lot in Gilead: to suffer and be still. Serena Joy's perfume, too, exemplifies these gendered effects: lily of the valley is, no doubt, an officially tolerated scent because, like the lily pictured on the sign, it's one of the few flowers mentioned in the Old Testament."5 The fact that this floral perfume unerringly gags Offred suggests that the fixed and official denotations of purity, anonymous work, and submission to the greater good implied by these biblical icons are among the forces arrayed to silence female dissent. The possibilities of Offred's life in Gilead are as circumscribed as the floral meanings in those Old Testament icons, fixed by the literate effects of monotheist ideology. Both are animated only as reflections of a transcendent plan "under His Eye" (45). Offred's earlier, rhapsodic intercourse with the flowers in Serena Joy's garden certainly provides a distinct counterpoint to the gag reflex of the allegorically appropriated flowers above. That lyrical garden experience could, however, simply be construed as an irrational moment, one to 289</page><page sequence="16">Deborah Hooker which Offred has been driven by the accretion of Gilead's various re pressions. However, Abram's analysis of alphabetic reading suggests that such "irrationality," provoked by a speaking environment, is an artifact of increasingly abstract written signifiers whose adoption helped to displace a prior, pagan, animate relationship to the environment. In that context, Offred's experience in the garden again subversively opposes Gilead's autocratic monotheism by offering a counterpoint to the primal scene of writing in the Old Testament. Offred's intercourse with the speaking garden can, in fact, be read as a telling revision of Moses' intercourse with the burning bush at the inception of written Judaic law. Both Offred's garden episode and the one in Exodus invoke a mythological linguistic paradigm: in both, a natural object "speaks." But in Exodus the speaking object-the burning bush-like Persephone's flowers and unlike the speaking trees in Offred's garden, depicts nature as dangerous and untouchable even as a voice emerges from it. In the case of the Old Testament discourse upon which Gilead trades, this foun dational moment of speaking nature elides into another voice which is no less but differently "irrational," the imposition of what Derrida calls metaphysics' "own mythological form" (qtd. in Vesseleu 5): an invisible supplement, a voice outside of and transcending nature, is added and at tains the force of law even as it depends on a natural place for that voice. This particular moment of transcendence dramatizes one effect of the now more-abstract signifiers-the displacement of that prior "animating interplay of the senses" from the world to the page or, in this case, to the stone tablet-the moment when, as Abram tells us, "the trees become mute, the other animals dumb" (131). From this point on, as the fate of those who worshipped the golden calf in Moses' absence reveals, speak ing nature and those who converse with it will be construed as irrational or idolatrous-outside the "law of Moses." A new signifying structure prevails in which such an experience of nature has no place in officially sanctioned models of the divine and the society it mandates. Andrew Furman's examination of a Judaic ethos "wary, if not down right hostile, to the natural world" reminds us, however, that this antipa gan, antifloral construction is also the result of a history marked by slavery and exile, of a people "constantly reminded that the physical world did not belong to them" (52).The ethical imperative at this moment ofJudaic history-to preserve a tribal identity via the book, which subsequently became their sacralized "homeland" (53)-cannot be denied here; but 290</page><page sequence="17">(Fl)orality, Gender, and the Environmental Ethos of The Handmaid's Tale what can be regretted is the displacement of a justifiable hostility from human agents to the environment. Erected in the interstices of environmental ruin, Gilead, as yet another New Jerusalem, demonstrates the environmental dead end that such an Old Testament hostility guarantees. As numerous scholars argue, the air "full . . . of chemicals, rays, radiation" and water teeming with "toxic molecules" (112) are, at least in part, products of a presumed androcentric privilege rooted in Genesis.16 Atwood explicitly connects this environ mental dead end to "the Word," the closely guarded Bible, in another interior setting replete with flowers. Awaiting the Commander's reading of the pre-Ceremony scripture, his "household" arranges itself among the "dusk-rose velvet of the drawn drapes ... the peach-pink peonies of the Chinese rug, the dried flower arrangement on either end of the mantel piece, and a vase of real daffodils on the polished marquetry end table" (80). After reading the Rachel and Leah story as precedent for Gilead's serial rape, the Commander "lets the [Bible] fall closed."The book makes "an exhausted sound" (90), suggesting that its environmentally hostile ethos has, in fact, achieved its logical dead end, one that it is as impotent as the largely sterile Commanders to reverse. If, as McLuhan argues, visual dominance effects a certain ideological closure that permeates all hnguistic translations of experience, then Gilead's adoption of an environmentally hostile Old Testament ideology with its all-seeing God literally ensures its demise. In an environmental context, that hostile ideology is, like the fish-eye mirror in the hallway of the Commander's house, now increas ingly an omniscient "eye under pressure" (49). Escaping the eye, with all of its ideological and theological impli cations, is the prerequisite for Offred's most profound action, speaking her story. To signify this escape, Offred invokes another floral object: she frequently represents herself narrating the particulars of her confinement beneath a "relief ornament in the shape of the wreath" on her ceihng, its center "a blank space, plastered over, like the place in a face where the eye has been taken out" (7). As we later discover, Offred composes her story from an actual place of relief, beyond the boundaries of Gilead, where the paralyzing effects of its secret police, the Eyes, do not so readily ob tain. Because she figures herself as composing orally beneath the wreath, however, that depiction invokes another moment in the chronology of literacy-the transitional moment of the classical orator, situated be tween the fading world of primary orality and the initial onset of literate 291</page><page sequence="18">Deborah Hooker dominance. As such a transitional emblem, however, the wreath's orally enabling and positive connotations are also offset by negative portents. The metaphors it elicits suggest that, like the onset of alphabetic literacy, the future interiorizing of electronic literacy has meant and will mean something apocalyptic for female subjectivity. When Offred imagines this eyeless wreath above her as a "frozen halo, a zero" (200), those empty places not only mark the site of the prior Offred's suicide but invoke a welter of other associations figuring the pro found restructuring of Offred's life under Gilead's human and electronic Eyes.The "frozen halo" evokes Gilead's cold and inhumane rehgiosity and the handmaid's coerced status as part religious object within that dispen sation; her place is also reflected in the "zero" or "blank space," both old and negative synonyms for female sexuality. The frozen halo and the zero also, however, point to that most apt objective correlative for Gileadean society, the Soul Scrolls. With their mechanical religiosity underwritten by the binary operations of computing inscription, they localize Atwood's darkest speculations about the effects of this latest and most abstract form of inscription. Chanting prescripted prayers, the "Holy Rollers," as the handmaids mockingly refer to them, reduce a heretofore profoundly intimate, idio syncratic, and typically oral form of expression to electronic iterations. Debiting bank accounts according to the number of iterations ordered, these machines also index the callers'"piety and faithfulness to the re gime" (167).17 In other instances, such computerized surveillance has also proven very useful to Gilead's design: its initial segregation of society, for example, is achieved by manipulating centralized banking computers (175-79). And Offred's tragic complicity in the regime's rise to power is suggested by the fact that her prior library job consisted of transferring books to electronic formats, after which these books, like Gilead's "un babies," are consigned to the "shredder" (173). Perhaps the darkest technological implications arise from the way in which the numerical base of computing inscription mirrors the struc ture and signifiers for Gilead's most perverse and essential form of social exchange: the names denoting the serialized sexual exchange of Gilead's handmaids-Of-warren, Of-glen, Of-fred-literally mimic the ones and zeros of that binary base. While the one, the masculine, receives the name and the power to direct these sexual exchanges, the abject status of the handmaids is signaled by the homology of her sex to the zero, the empty 292</page><page sequence="19">(Fl)orality, Gender, and the Environmental Ethos of The Handmaid's Tale place, or as Irigaray would put it, when transposed to a sexual register dominated by sight, "the horror of nothing to see" (26). If the phonetic alphabet represents one stage in a process of efficient linguistic reduction, "decompos[ing] words into their minimal pertinent units" (Goux 129), then the ones and zeros of computing inscription represent a further stage in this logic of efficiency, reduction, and abstraction. Not only do they starkly reveal the dualistic epistemology bolstered by alphabetic literacy, but their oppressive usage in Gilead also suggests that this newest and in creasingly potent form of inscription will ultimately conflate and amplify the power of the institutions already dominant in that binary dispensa tion. In their overt commercialization of prayer, for example, the Soul Scrolls represent the collapse of the theological into the commercial, collating both the "background in market research" (306) and the fun damentalist theology of Gilead's chief architects, Waterford and Judd. However, the history of the technologized word suggests that this is not a new development, that there has always been a close association between the evolving forms of commerce and religion.18 While Gilead's design ers rightly emphasize their biblical lineage, calling themselves and the think tank that orchestrates all of Gilead's oppressive practices the "Sons ofJacob" (306), they are also spiritual heirs of the Phoenician and Greek merchants whose commercial interests hastened the spread of alphabetic literacy. By stripping away the environmental and contextual resonances from their inherited Semitic pictographs, these merchants created a more efficient means of tracking trade transactions and inventories. As I have previously argued, the arresting of Persephone's floral "work" metaphorizes one effect of this shift from oral to literate domi nance: the oral flow of words is arrested in a fixed, linear topography and all environmental elements are excised from written, phonetic signifiers. This moment is also, McLuhan tells us, the shift from myth to history, as history is a paradigm "closely related" to the linear format of chirography and typography (6).When McLuhan describes the advent of print tech nology, he also employs a floral metaphor that is as elegiac as the flowers in the Persephone myth: he compares the effects of printing, which am plified chirography's visual dominance and sense of lineal progression, to the death of the garden, inasmuch as a garden, like Hesiod's figuration of eloquence, "indicates the interplay of all the senses in haptic harmony" (17). 293</page><page sequence="20">Deborah Hooker McLuhan's metaphor derives from the fifteenth century, as do the negative floral images invoked in Offred's meditation in the garden. There the flowers-likened to "black cats," "bleeding hearts," and female shapes "rooted out" (153)-recall the history of early modern witch hunts, contemporaneous with the rise of print technology. During this period women were persecuted for rattling the hierarchical chain of be ing through allegedly transforming the bodies of others as well as their own. This transformative property is, however, homologous to the poetic function evoked in the more positive moments of Offred's experience in the garden, where the fluid metamorphosis of"tree into bird" contests the analytical, dissecting tendency that prevails with print technology. With its "instressed concern with one sense only [vision]," McLuhan tells us, the dominance of this new technology brings "the mechanical principle of abstraction and repetition . . . into explicit form," which "means the spelling out of one thing at a time, one sense at a time, one mental or physical operation at a time" (17-18).19 Print technology was not, however, fully interiorized by large sectors of the population until the late eighteenth century, a development that Ong correlates with the rise of romanticism and its characteristic focus on the "remote, the mysterious, the inaccessible, the ineffable, the unknown" (Rhetoric 276). Such a focus, he contends, emerges both as a product of and reaction to the "psychic security" conferred by print, specifically by its capacity to store knowledge for retrieval "in visually processed space" (278), an index of "man's noetic control over nature" (20).Atwood's per spective on this stage of interiorization again emphasizes the connection between print's further displacement of orality's animistic relationship to the more-than-human world and the containment of women within a certain model of eros. And the allusion to this development is, again, mediated by flowers. It begins with Offred's first shattering Ceremony with the Com mander, after which she desperately seeks a way to recuperate a sense of her personal and sexual agency: she fantasizes the theft of "something that will not be missed. In the wood at midnight a magic flower," which she will "press ... under [her] mattress ... for the next woman ... to find" (98).20 This passing of flowers between women, in fact, recapitulates a practice originating in a historical environment of sexual slavery similar to Gilead's, an environment that became, for Europeans, a cultural obses sion at the end of the eighteenth century, a symptom, moreover, of the 294</page><page sequence="21">(Fl)orality, Gender, and the Environmental Ethos of The Handmaid's Tale romantic interest in "the remote, the mysterious, the inaccessible." Offred reveals this environment in her meditation on a harem painting, one that depicts "fat women lolling on divans.... Studies," she says, "of sedentary flesh" (69). The obsession with harems that prompted such paintings, however, also spawned a prominent print analogue.21 In the early decades of the nineteenth century, as Goody tells us, Europe and America were flooded with a broad range of books purporting to explicate a mysteri ous "language of flowers" (232); these texts assigned definitive (and yet differing) meanings to flowers and other objects employed in a wordless mode of communication. Invoked to support the claims of these publica tions, letters from travelers to the Orient or Mideast identify the harem as the birthplace of this language, touted as the means whereby women confined in these real and ideological spaces communicated with illicit lovers in the outside world (232-34).While scholars like the orientalist Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall subsequently debunked the notion that such a language existed as a standardized code known by everyone on the commonsensical basis that a fixed code "would be of little use for two lovers when the least suspicion cost them their lives," they did concede that the women of the harems "invented it in the leisure of their lonely life . . . as amusement, or as a code for lesbian attachments" (Hammer Purgstall, qtd. in Goody 234).22 Goody tells us that this floral harem language was not, however, for mulated according to any abstract associational method, nor was it based on the imaginative linkage between "ideas or sentiments" and botanical habits; rather, the correspondence was based on a pointedly oral mne monic-rhyme (234).As Beverly Seaton demonstrates in an example from the astoundingly popular French flower books, the pear (armoude) is not studied for what ideas it might suggest, but rather for other words that rhyme with its name, such as omoude (hope). Then a phrase ending with the rhyming word is sought for among the common sayings of the language, such as vir bana bir omoude (give me some hope). (63) Moreover, as signifiers themselves, the flowers convey orality's more ex tensive perceptual engagement with the world: touch and residual smell as well as the oral rhyme enabled by the floral signifier. Offred's allusions both to pressed flowers and to harems strongly as sociate the textual with the sexual, an association also promoted by the 295</page><page sequence="22">Deborah Hooker Historian's belittling pun on the words tail and tale in the epilogue (301). For example, Offred tells us that the harem paintings were "supposed to be erotic," but she discerns that "they were really about . . . suspended animation; about waiting, about objects not in use" (69). Commenting on the practice of "pressing living flowers to death between the pages of printed books," Ong identifies "the dead flower, once alive," as the "psychic equivalent of the verbal text" (Orality 81).23 In Ong, therefore, we have the flower-the oral, mythological consciousness "feminized" by literacy's binary logic-pressed "to death" between the pages of a book; and in Atwood, we see women "pressed" into service in the harems of the east or the bedrooms and brothels of Gilead's elite, those who represent the power of the written word and its ideology of masculine privilege.24 In the attenuated lives of harem women and Gilead's handmaids we can also read the "suspended animation" by which Abram characterizes the literate world's relationship to the environment. It is an old story that these flowers passed between women are telling, about the structural homologies between concepts of gender, eros, and modes of signification and what has been ideologically and socially privileged and constrained by them. If, as Ong reminds us, the oral world experienced the word as an event, "a mode of action and not simply a countersign of thought" (Orality 32), then these passed flowers are, in fact, an event like the oral word. They perform as well as signify a larger and elegiac ontological plot whose outline emerges as we move from Hesiod to Persephone to the harems: we move from a linguistic imaginary that includes women's active participation and encodes some sense of a reciprocally signifying natural environment to an interruption of that ethic to arrive, finally, at a scene where flowers circulate among women enclosed in sexually repressive environments like Jezebel's or the harems. However, in a final floral image that both affirms and qualifies the Historian's "tail/tale" pun, Atwood seems to promote the imaginative realm of literature as the one written discourse that mitigates some of the effects of writing's visualist epistemology-precisely because something mythological is preserved there. In the first paragraph of the novel Atwood represents her own text, Offred's narration, as a weave of mythological flowers, an image and a concept retroactively affirmed in the epilogue. When the novel opens in the high school gym, where the handmaids are indoctrinated, the "linger[ing] music" of the "dances [that] would have been held there . . . a palimpsest of unheard sound" (3) prompts 296</page><page sequence="23">(Fl)orality, Gender, and the Environmental Ethos of The Handmaid's Tale Offred's recollection of another element of her life in "the time before" (237)- "garlands made of tissue-paper flowers" (3). The epilogue's His torians metanarratively refer us back to this "unheard sound" when they reveal that Offred's narration is a transcript of her voice produced by a palimpsestic "speaking over" a wildly heterogeneous group of voices and music that also go unheard-tapes of Elvis Presley, Lithuanian folks songs, Boy George, Montovani, and the Twisted Sisters (302). Moreover, when the Historians admit to "arrang[ing] the blocks of speech" to produce the text we read, they also invoke one of the earliest classical metaphors for the production of a literary text-the floral garland. Through this scene of textual construction, Atwood again takes us back to the moment of the "Greek miracle" where floral metaphors for literature represent a conservative gesture against some of the ideological effects of phonetic inscription. When, for example, writing relieved the pressure to narrativize experience, orality's primary means of preserving knowledge, it also enabled a more abstract form of discourse. No longer restricted to people or anthropomorphized beings, subjects of discourse now encompassed the "names of impersonals, of ideas or abstractions or 'entities' (as we sometimes call them)" (Havelock 101). This abstract de narrativizing of knowledge is also directly connected to the rise and privi leging of early science. In the specific context of flowers, Philip Knight argues, the works of Theophrastus demonstrate how the new science disconnected "investigations of the plant world" from "religious symbol ism," specifically from that of the "cults and myths celebrating a fertility goddess (Demeter, Ge, or Cybele) that survived into the Classical period and beyond" (3).These cultic connotations of flowers "demythologize[d] ... so rigorously" by the new hterate reflectivity were, however, preserved by what subsequently became literary tradition, where "the flower ... provided metaphors for aspects of literature itself" (5). For Classical writers, Knight suggests, the floral garland signified a text composed of "beautiful materials carefully selected and woven to gether with artistry" (5).25 Thus, although they remain largely oblivious to Offred's artistry, when the Historians splice together the synesthetic poetry of her narrative, they metanarratively identify Atwood's text as a preservation of this mythological gestalt. Because literature is the one written discourse still emphasizing the oral, synesthetic properties of language and preserving orality's narrative mode as knowledge, Atwood's floral narrative explicitly identifies the imaginative realm of literature as 297</page><page sequence="24">Deborah Hooker the residue of that mythological consciousness. As Offred is a modern analogue for both Demeter and Persephone, this textual "garland made of tissue paper flowers" further echoes the protagonist's and the text's mythological lineage. What Offred says of the evocative garden at the center of the novel is true of all inevitably pahmpsestic literary texts: they are the places where "whatever is silenced" by the ideological effects of visual primacy "will clamor to be heard" (153) or silently read. Or, we might say, Off-read. When she invokes the sense of hearing in that passage, however, I take Atwood to be calling for the reinvigoration of orality's synesthetic engagement of all the senses, not just aurality. For these woven, floral garlands also call our attention to the sense of touch and to the material ity of the text we hold in our hands. The "tissue-paper flowers" in the first paragraph of Offred's narration not only point to the "imitation" floral garlands decorating the gym, but they also evoke the "tissue-paper" pages of a text, a floral materiality that Offred notices in the "exhausted" sound of the Bible falling shut at the end of pre-Ceremony ritual. That sound evokes for Offred precisely what our attention to the visual word obscures-the sense of touch, of being in contact with the natural ele ments that carry the visuahzed word: specifically, the "softness of the thin oniony pages, how they would feel under the fingers. Soft and dry ... Like petals" (90). Elaine Scarry reminds us, too, that the surfaces on which the earliest written characters were inscribed as well as the inscribing tools themselves were derived from earthy or vegetable matter: soft clay tablets, wax, papyrus reeds woven into paper, and inks composed of the "ashes of almonds ... or the solution of tannins from oak galls or other vegetation" (162). Implicitly echoing Hesiod's oral paradigm of floral eloquence, Scarry ultimately proposes the flower as "the representative object of imagining" (44): "because the [early] practice of writing is then, [iterally] a laying down of flowers upon flowers," she asserts, "it may be regarded as an exteriorization of what the imagining mind does, and of what it was doing long before it invented [the] external form" (162) of writing.26 Atwood's emphasis on the floral materiality of the page, like Scarry's implicit linking of imagination to an oral consciousness, challenges any cultural ethos that forgets its debt to the materiality on which any technology or transcendental regime of truth so obviously depends. Her exploration of this particular technological restructuring of consciousness suggests the liability of what Jane Gallop calls the "heavily policed border 298</page><page sequence="25">(Fl)orality, Gender, and the Environmental Ethos of The Handmaid's Tale with nature" (38) whose starkly gendered concepts not only ensure the silence or devaluation of specifically human entities but imperil life in all its myriad forms. The novel also importantly suggests a fundamental correlation between environmental degradation and our imaginative ca pabilities. As flowers and other species of plant and animal life are "rooted out," the conditions inspiring our ability to imagine a world otherwise, in which such devastation is not simply the accepted norm, are also at tenuated.Atwood's 1995 poem "Marsh Languages" reiterates such a con nection, lamenting "the dark soft languages [that] are being silenced" by the "language of metal, / the language of either/or, / the one language that has eaten all the others" (lines 1, 31-33). As an additional caution about some of the ideological liabilities of literacy's visual primacy, we need only remember Gilead's Eyes. The prominence of vision that Ong and others assert as a reflex of alphabetic writing and print is amplified in Gilead through that network of anonymous informants and secret police. And one effect of these omnipresent Eyes is that free speech-in both a political and a creative sense-withers. If history is, as McLuhan has pro posed, an artifact of technology, "closely related to typography" (6), then as a written text, Atwood's novel is implicated, for good and for ill, in all of the ideologies inflected by writing and print. However, by asserting literature's mythological, oral lineage, The Handmaid's Tale also offers us one of those "countervailing cultural forces" without which, according to McLuhan, "the unconscious effects" of our literate history "flourish" (6). Notes l.The stasis or ideological conservatism of Gilead is linked to the mnemonic demands of orality, which, Ong argues, make stylistic redundancy necessary, generally "inhibiting] intellectual experimentation" (Orality 41), though he concedes that the intimate, interpersonal oral dynamic inevitably involves improvisation and thus the inevitability of change. See also Walker 12-13 and Foley 97-103. 2. This exploration of literacy dovetails with Frank Davey's observation that At wood works "in a medium on which her own writing recurrently casts doubt" (165), a corollary to what he sees as her ambivalence toward "the 'received language' of conventional speech" (162) in general. He further argues that the prevalent subtexts in her writing, "together with recurrent images, symbols, and narrative patterns ... constitute a 'female' sublanguage which rivals and often replaces discursive language." 299</page><page sequence="26">Deborah Hooker 3. By linguistic imaginary I mean the way in which Western culture has, at vari ous sociocultural moments, spoken or written about the way language func tions. 4. See for example Ong, Orality 105 and 179; Havelock 120-21; and Abram 98-123 and 131-36. 5.1 discuss only two myths, but the novel alludes to at least one more: that of Daphne pursued by Apollo and turned into a laurel tree. The frequent depic tions of Offred narrating her story beneath the wreath on the ceiling of her bedroom evoke this myth and its related issues of gender and language. See also Sartiliot's discussion of flowers in the context of myth and orality. 6. Wright's comments represent his interpretation of the central claims laid out by Kenneth Burke in A Rhetoric of Motives. 7. This is certainly the case with cuneiform, a form of abstract inscription that predates the aleph-beth by perhaps as much as 2000 years. The relevant point here is that its complexity restricted its use and thus restricted the effects of literacy to a relatively small, albeit powerful, class of users. 8. Echoing McLuhan's description of orality s endless translation of one sense into another, Hilda Staels describes Offred s poetic technique of "metonymi cal speech and synaesthesia" in the garden and elsewhere as the ability to link "spatio-temporally and semantically discontinuous objects" (461). 9. This association of the garden with eroticism continues when Nick, Offred's problematic romantic interest, interrupts her theft of a flower in the sitting room after her first Ceremony with the Commander and Serena Joy. The plot literally substitutes Nick for the flower, which begins their intimate relation ship. For an examination of this relationship and its implications for the novel's ideology of romance, see Miner. 10. Walker's translation of Hesiod is derived from Evelyn-White, Fraser, and Lattimore. 11. Helene P. Foley reminds us of the oral myth's instability, reshaped in each retelling "to suit various occasions and audiences." Because "poets could as sume their audience's knowledge of mythical variants," they "played on this awareness in shaping their own interpretations" (97-98). Hesiod, for example, mentions Persephone in the catalog of competing deities in his Theogony, but he does not elaborate on the scene of her abduction, implicitly assuming the audience's familiarity with some version of the story. 12. Foley notes, too, the resemblance of the Hymn to Demeter to Hesiod's Theogony. Because it maintains both the element of sexual conflict and the 300</page><page sequence="27">(Fl)orality, Gender, and the Environmental Ethos of The Handmaid's Tale necessity of female cooperation in the organization of the cosmos, the hymn "emphasiz[es] the problematic aspects of Persephone's marriage to Hades and ... develop[s] its narrative as a conflict between the sexes that ultimately threatens the organization of the cosmos through Demeter s famine" (112). While Hesiod's Theogony ultimately "demonstrates the superior diplomacy and physical power of male deities ... they require the powers and cooperation of female deities at every phase to succeed" (112). Similarly, Apost?los N.Atha nassakis argues that "it is the mother who matters" throughout most of the Theogony (5)."The male partner is much less prominent or altogether obscure." Because of the "fiercely patriarchal character of Hesiod's own society," Atha nassakis characterizes this emphasis on the mother as a "remarkable departure from [Hesiod's] familiar world and an equally remarkable testimony to the tenacity of the substructure of the mythological pattern." 13. All translations of the Hymn to Demeter are Foley's. 14. Verena Buhler Roth ascribes Offred's careful delineations of these floral connotations to her awareness of the dangers inherent in living in a repressive system: "outlines sometimes blur and ... objects do not remain what they are, or are not what they seem. One wrong word could give her away and mean her death" (162). See also Miner 151-52 and Rubenstein 106 for further com mentary on the novel's floral motif. 15. As an index ofthat theology's general apprehension over flowers as threat eningly sensual objects, Jack Goody reminds us that there are no flowers in the Semitic representation of the Garden of Eden (46). Otherwise in the Old Testament, the only floral imagery "c?l?br?t[ing] spring, beauty, and erotic love, apparently without reference to ethical monotheism, is the Canticum Canteco rum" (Knight 7). 16. See Lynn White. 17. As David Lyon observes, spying on the private and public activities of oth ers "is hardly a new practice" (354); today electronic surveillance is routinely used to monitor and assess the productive activities of the labor force, to en hance security and law enforcement, and to increase market share. However, Lyon argues, the magnitude of the first two uses pales in comparison to "the massive armory of commercial surveillance used by marketers" (356-57). Ly on's essay appeared before 9/11, so by now we might expect that the security functions of electronic surveillance are catching up to the marketing function. 18. See for example Ong's discussion of the origins of Sumerian cuneiform in economic transactions (Orality 85-86). See also Goux 88-111 for a more extensive examination of the related evolutions of economic systems, money forms, and forms of inscription. 301</page><page sequence="28">Deborah Hooker 19. Abram, too, correlates witch hunts with the "domination of alphabetic reason" furthered by print technology. This, he says, resulted in the "nearly suc cessful extermination of the last orally preserved traditions in Europe," those "rooted in the direct, participatory experience of plants, animals, and elements" (199). 20. Offred first articulates this desire to steal during the pre-Ceremony ritual, identifying a "dried flower" as one of the objects she would like to "secrete ... in [her] room, under the bed, or in a shoe, or in a slit in the hard petit point FAITH cushion" (80-81). 21. Dorothy Jones's study is the first I am aware of to cite the "flower lan guage" of the Turkish harems in a discussion of the novel (36), but while she discusses the floral emblemology standard in these nineteenth-century texts, she does not link them to the novel's harem image. 22. The Historians' dismissal of Offred s narrative on the grounds that it fails to provide the much-desired information about Gilead that they seek and their general denigration of her status as a fit narrator for this historical period is, interestingly, paralleled by the treatment of Charlotte de Latour, a pseudonym for Mme. Louise Cortambert, the woman generally acknowledged to have compiled the first flower book in nineteenth-century France.While Latours brothers, also authors, are listed in the Dictionnaire de Biographie Fran?aise and La Grande Encyclop?die, her name is omitted. Goody speculates that she was excluded from these prestigious lists because her work, like Offred's, "was not considered sufficiently academic" (237nl7), despite the fact that her book influenced the host of other flower books that succeeded it. 23. Ong's analogy seems to have been inspired by Browning's Pippa Passes, which "calls attention to the still widespread practice of pressing living flowers to death between the pages of printed books" (Orality 81). 24. Wendy Wall points out that with the advent of printing, the "axis of gen der" helped "to encode anxieties about unauthorized social and textual circula tion in early modern England" (3) and to interrogate the "issues of authorship, privacy, and class energized by the spread of print technology" (l).The term pressing, for example, served as a "double entendre suggesting'loss of authorial virginity'" (7). 25. By 90 BCE Meleager's anthology, representing six centuries of Greek po etry, had institutionalized the garland as an image for poetry, "characterizing many of the poets as particular flowers" and the anthology itself as '"a selection of the best flowers.'.. .The very concept of anthology henceforth contains the metaphor: the finest writing is flower-like" (Knight 6). 302</page><page sequence="29">(Fl)orality, Gender, and the Environmental Ethos of The Handmaid's Tale 26. With the backing of evidence from many cognitive studies, Scarry sub stantiates a correlation between the physical properties of flowers and the physiology of human imagining: their size, shape, and texture correspond to the cognitive and embodied requisites of human imagining. Thus she associates the presence of narrativized flowers with the vehicle whereby writers guide readers through the most vivid textual scenarios. Although her study does not promote an environmental agenda, her argument is implicitly environmental inasmuch as she reminds us that in many instances of writing we depend on vegetative materials to convey human-centered constructs. It is also worth noting that the one text Offred has been officially left to read provides a related metanarrative associating writing, print, and the flower. The visual design of the "hard little cushion" with the word "FAITH in square print, surrounded by a wreath of lilies" (57) suggests that a certain (fl)orality encircles or frames the entire religious imaginary conveyed in the word faith. Like that object, this novel?this imaginative construct, this locus of suspended disbelief we hold in our hands?can be perceived as analogously and florally "framed." Works cited Abram, David.
