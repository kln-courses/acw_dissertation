<plain_text><page sequence="1">Number 70 April, 1938 After much deliberation we have decided upon a plan which seems to offer the most reasonable solution of our problem, namely, A CAMPAIGN FOR 200 people who will pledge $100 each and 600 people who will pledge $ 50 each (pledges to be paid before December, 1939). These givers will be enrolled as Associates and Friends of the American Schools, respectively. As a record and expression of our appreciation the names of all these givers will be inscribed on a chart to be framed and hung in the School at Jerusalem. In order that the record may show graphically the progress of the campaign, it will take the form of a picture of a wall which will contain when finished, 200 large foundation stones and 600 smaller stones. For every gift a stone bearing the donor's name will be added to the wall. Givers of larger amounts than $100 will have their names inscribed on a corresponding number of stones; a gift of $1000 just received, for example, provides ten foundation stones. Of course, there will be many individuals who cannot include themselves in either the $100 or the $50 group. But organizations with which they are connected may share in this plan. For any congregation, Sunday School, or club which adds a stone to the wall, we will gladly provide an illustrated lecture by a member of the Schools on some phase of archaeological work. It is hoped that every person who is interested in the future of the Schools will take some personal interest and responsibility in this final drive to get our organization on a sound financial basis while the Rockefeller Founda- tion is offering the challenge of tripling each sum we raise. No two or three persons can carry this plan to success by themselves alone. May we be able by the end of 1939 to point to a completed chart and say with Nehemiah, " So we built the wall, for the people had a mind to work ! " PROGRESS OF THE JOINT EXPEDITION TO MESOPOTAMIA E. A. SPEISER The American School of Oriental Research in Baghdad and the University Museum of the University of Pennsylvania sent out in September, 1937, another joint expedition to Mesopotamia, thus continuing a scientific part- nership which dates back to 1930. The plans for the current season called for six weeks at Tepe Gawra, to be followed by two months at Khafajeh, and a concluding stay at Gawra, the length of which would depend on the amount of money available at the time. The entire arrangement was dictated by experience as well as economy. At Khafajeh the best months for archaeological work are January and February; November, December, and March are bad on account of sandstorms, while the remaining months are much too hot for outside work. At Tepe Gawra the climate is moderate 3</page><page sequence="2">Number 70 April, 1938 from September through April, but the rains are at their worst during January and February. In other words, the period which is most suitable for field work in the south happens to be particularly uncertain in the north. Since short seasons are uneconomical for a number of reasons, the best plan is to have the same staff divide its season judiciously between .a north- ern and a southern site. From this standpoint, Gawra and Khafajeh constitute an ideal combination. During the current season the interchangeable staff has consisted of Mr. Arthur J. Tobler, as General Assistant, Recorder, and Photographer; Mr. E. Bartow Miiller, as Architect; and Mr. Alberto Davico, as Artist. The Field Director at Tepe Gawra has been Mr. Charles Bache, accom- x N-7 . ..'00~ ..... " : ' ":::.;?T i  :ii,?; i" ' Oki:i : .... . .. .. .. II~.... ?s  , Fig. 2.

Our Annual Professor, Elihu Grant, arrived at Khafajeh in February to lend his assistance as epigrapher. The following news and comments are based on a letter from Mr. Tobler, who reports from Gawra, and on Mr. Delougaz's account from Khafajeh. TEPE GAWRA The first stage of the season's work at Tepe Gawra was begun on Novem- ber 1, 1937. Readers of the BULLETIN may recall that the excavations of the preceding season had carried the work down to Level XVI, in addition to clearing a section of the eastern slope of the mound all the way to virgin soil (No. 66, p. 19). The first task of the current season has been to continue the clearing of Level XVI in the northeast third of the site. The buildings of the period are comparatively flimsy, but they may be of con- siderable interest, nevertheless, as was shown by the remains of the closed kiln which were laid bare in the course of the preceding campaign (BULLETIN, No. 66, p. 15). The remains of the present season are no less interesting, although for a different reason. On a wall of a room in 4</page><page sequence="3">Number 70 April, 1938 the southwest area were discovered traces of a fresco. " The design," writes Mr. Tobler, "consists of rows of connected lozenges, painted alternatively in red and black" (cf. Fig. 1). Fig. 3. Beakers from well, Gawra XIV. The pottery of this stratum includes more specimens of Sdmarrd and HIalaf wares than had been found in the immediately following levels, but early 'Obeid wares are still encountered. Typical of the period seem to be Fig. 4. Baked clay cylinder of Samsuiluna, Mound B, Khafajeh. the bowls illustrated in Fig. 2. The clay is well levigated and fired, the color of the ware being buff or greenish-buff. " The decoration is done often in purplish-black paint, although red and brown are not exceptional." The 5</page><page sequence="4">Number 70 April, 1938 level has produced also numerous gaming pieces which are, with a single exception, anthropomorphic in shape. Their bases show signs of con- siderable wear. Directly under the Northern Temple of Level XIII was discovered a well, which must have been sunk from Level XIV. Here were found frag- ments of many beakers which had proved characteristic of the Acropolis Age (cf. Fig. 3), and numerous seal impressions. The impressions include geometric designs and representations of animals and men, and their number is large enough to furnish ample material for stylistic study and compari- son with the glyptic finds from the later 'Obeid levels at Gawra. Fig. 5. A pot of the period of transition between Jemdet Nasr and Early Dynastic, Mound A, Khaffjeh. On December 15 the staff left for Khafajeh, expecting to return late in March for a spring campaign at Gawra. It will be seen from the above remarks that fresh information concern- ing SamarrS-Halaf times may be forthcoming after the excavators reach Level XVII. We cannot tell as yet whether that level will prove to cor- respond to the remains at the top of the cut which was cleared in the season of 1936/37. It will be recalled that in the extreme east corner of this cut there was found a burial pit of which the lowest deposits date from pre-Halafian times (BULLETIN, No. 66, p. 18). It is now possible to correlate these earliest finds from Tepe Gawra, scanty as they are as yet, with material from North Syria. Among the characteristic ceramic products of Judeideh XIV, as reported by McEwan and Braidwood,1 1 Cf. AJA XLI, 11 (and Or. Inst. Publ. XLVIII, 7). 6</page><page sequence="5">Number 70 April, 1938 there are brittle orange-buff wares with wavy line decoration in red. Now these are precisely the wares which are attested at the very bottom of the pre-Halafian pit at Gawra. This correspondence is of outstanding interest for two reasons. In the first place, it establishes a definite cultural relation- ship between the Nineveh area and North Syria in unquestionably neolithic times.2 Moreover, the incised wares of Judeideh XIV have been shown to correspond with similar fabrics from Nineveh I. In other words, we have now a synchronism between the earliest deposits at Nineveh and at Gawra, although the incised ware characteristic of the former site is yet to be dis- covered at Gawra. This will probably happen when the earliest settlement at Gawra is reached in the process of regular excavation from the top. Fig. 6. Pot of the Jemdet Nasr Period, Mound A, Khaftjeh. KHAFiJEH The archaeological area of Khafajeh comprises several separate mounds. The largest of the group is Mound A, which is also the oldest, presenting a continuous record of occupation from the end of the Uruk age, through the numerous successive settlements of the Jemdet Nasr and Early Dynastic periods, down to Sargonid times. Mounds B-D lie about half a mile west of A;' they are all considerably later than the main site and culturally independent of it. We know, e. g., that Mound B represents a settlement founded in the Hammurabi age, some five hundred years at least after the 2 For correspondences between Judeideh XIV and Jericho IX, cf. the Table in Wright's Pottery of Palestine, 107. 3 See the map in Or. Inst. Comm. 13, Fig. 19. 7</page><page sequence="6">Number 70 April, 1938 abandonment of Mound A. Although both sites are covered by the modern name Khafajeh, we know definitely that their respective ancient names must have been different. For whether Mound A is actually the site of ancient Akshak, or of some other early city of comparable importance, it is certain that Mound B could not have acquired its Akkadian name before the beginning of the second millennium B. C. In this latest campaign at Khafajeh (December 17, 1937-March 15, 1938), the second under the joint auspices of the Baghdad School and the University Museum, and the ninth since the beginning of excavations on Fig. 7. Carving of a bearded bull of semi-translucent alabaster, Mound A, Khafajeh. the site, Mr. Delougaz divided his attention between Mound A and Mound B. The most important find from the latter settlement is an inscribed cylinder of baked clay in a perfect state of preservation. Since a fragment of a similar inscription, discovered a few years ago, had been identified by Dr. Thorkild Jacobsen as the record of Samsuiluna, son of Hammurabi,4 Mr. Delougaz suspected the present inscription to be a complete version of the same account. I am happy to report that my examination of the photo- graphs rushed to us from the field (Fig. 4) confirmed the excavator's guess. The inscription, composed in Sumerian, proves to be an account of the con- struction of the fortress Diir-Samsuiluna, so named after the king. It is virtually an exact duplicate of a cylinder now in Berlin, which was pub- 'Cf. BULLETIN, No. 68, p. 12. 8</page><page sequence="7">Number 70 April, 1938 Fig. 8.

A vaulted tomb, Early Dynastic III, Mound A, KhafAjeh. 9</page><page sequence="8">Number 70 April, 1938 lished by Prof. Arno Poebel.5 The present find not only establishes the provenience of the Berlin cylinder but settles also beyond doubt the identifi- cation of Mound B as " The Fort of Samsuiluna." " On Mound A the principal objectives were to complete the excavation of the Small Shrine, which had given us last season so much valuable material, and to continue work in the area of the Sin Temple. In most of this area the expedition of the Oriental Institute had got down to the first phase of the Early Dynastic period, which is characterized by the Diyala, or Scarlet Ware, a fabric intermediate in many respects between Jemdet Nasr and Early Dynastic types.7 Mr. Delougaz was fortunate enough to recover thousands of sherds representative of this rare kind of pottery. Patient work on the part of the staff led to the restoration of several nearly complete specimens. Fig. 5 shows one of these pots, a magnificent example of the ware in question. Below this layer were found true Jemdet Nasr deposits with typical pottery of the period (cf. Fig. 6), excellent animal sculptures (cf. Fig. 7), ornaments, and the like. A full description of these rich finds will be furnished later by Mr. Delougaz. In another section of the mound there was discovered a small shrine of the Early Dynastic period, which resembles the sanctuary of the previous season. A small female head and part of a stone plaque (Fig. 8) introduce once again the work of the contemporary sculptors. Finally, the latest phase of the Early Dynastic period has yielded a number of burials, some of them elaborate vaulted tombs constructed of plano-convex bricks (cf. Fig. 9). Ancient robbers paid these tombs the compliment of thorough rifling, and left the excavators this indirect and unwelcome indication of the original importance of the burials. The complete excavation of this ceme- tery has been left for a future campaign. [A cable just received from Iraq reports that the excavators at Tepe Gawra have discovered in stratum XVII the most representative collection yet known of transitional pottery bridging the gap between the Halafian and Obeidian periods. From the same period comes a tholos (round house) of a type known only from the Halafian of Arpachiyah.] " ccEine sumerische Inschrift Samsuilunas fiber die Erbauung der Festung Dur- Samsuiluna," Archiv filr Orientforschung, IX, 241 ff. The only differences are in the spacing of the lines. Thus our column I ends at line 2 of Poebel's col. II, while our col. III begins with line 33 of Poebel's col. II. Some of the longer lines of Poebel's cylinder form two lines in our text, e. g., Poebel, col. II 29. The only incomplete line in Poebel's text (I 20) is preserved in our cylinder, but the last two signs are unfortunately not clear in the photograph. Poebel reads utu labL k [alam . .. ], but our text begins with utu zalag-ga kalam . . . SThe cylinder comes from the same place in which were found the "Hurrian" objects discussed in the BULLETIN, No. 68, pp. 12f. Professors Albright and Christian have taken exception (in independent personal communications) to the dating of those objects in the Hammurabi period. I can readily appreciate their scruples, especially since I had been puzzled myself by the stratigraphic evidence. The discovery of the cylinder of Samsuiluna in the same archaeological context merely accentuates the difficulty of having to date certain objects on stylistic grounds, in opposition to the evidence of stratigraphy. But Albright's and Christian's objections are pertinent nevertheless. I Cf. Frankfort, Or. Inst.
