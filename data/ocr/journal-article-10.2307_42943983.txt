<plain_text><page sequence="1">62 SHOFAR Summer 1998 Vol. 16, No. 4 Integrating Jewish and Feminist Educational Goals Sylvia Barack Fishman Brandeis University Recent research has emphasized the central role of Jewish education in forming and maintaining a strong Jewish identity. This essay examines several approaches which integrate intensive Jewish education and feminist goals. While focusing upon specific curricular objectives - women in Jewish history and female biblical figures - , the essay also stresses the use of feminist analysis and contemporary women's scholarship as means to a more gender-equal Jewish educational environment. The challlenges of merging Jewish and feminist educational aims are thus addressed. Educators whose goals include incorporating feminist analysis into Jewish educational settings face a sobering challenge. Most Jewish educators wish students to gain not only a broad and deep knowledge of, but also to acquire a positive emotional attachment to Jewish history, culture, and texts. Most Jewish educators also value intellectual integrity - and yet many worry that feminist concerns may undermine the respect and affection which students form for Judaic materials. This essay suggests an approach which accentuates positive and complementary integration of Jewish and feminist goals. The aim of this approach is twofold: first, to focus directly on Jewish women's history and experiences; and second, to apply some principles of feminist analysis to the understanding of classic Judaic materials. The first goal - the reclamation of largely neglected materials within the opus of Judaic texts - is far less problematic than the second, which involves critical thinking. Nevertheless, especially when dealing with adolescent and adult students, both are necessary. Students who do not have the opportunity to analyze Jewish culture using feminist vantage points within a controlled Jewish educational setting will do so in the far less positive - and often openly hostile - settings of college courses or discussion groups. Giving students the opportunity to explore feminist issues in a Judaic-friendly setting is critical in the contemporary world. Bringing Women's History into the Jewish Classroom Recent research has revealed that formal Jewish education is the key differential in creating new generations of committed American Jews. Students who attend Jewish supplementary schools or day schools for six or more years become the American Jewish adults most involved in every measurable aspect of Jewish life and activity,</page><page sequence="2">Integrating Jewish and Feminist Educational Goals 63 including ritual observance in the home, membership in Jewish organizations, giving to Jewish philanthropies, seeking out a Jewish milieu, and marrying another Jew. And yet, in addition to all the positive results, Jewish education may also give girls a negative feeling about some aspects of Jewish tradition. When girls and boys sit together in a Jewish studies classroom, the texts they read and the issues they discuss may not be equally relevant to both genders. Within the framework of Jewish schooling, girls may be absorbing something besides a strong Jewish identity. In the worst case scenario, some girls say they "learn" that women do not really count in Jewish history, culture, or life. In most traditional historical Diaspora Jewish communities, sons were far more likely than daughters to receive formal Jewish education. Although American girls today are about as likely as boys to go to Jewish schools, Jewish school curricula often still reflect the historical male educational orientation. Boys in the Jewish classroom may be more likely to read and hear about characters, ideas, and values which are relevant to their lives, expectations, and experiences. As a result, girls may not see themselves and find role models in classical Jewish texts. They may feel that their religious heritage does not validate them as human beings and provide spiritual frameworks which relate to their lives. Biblical texts contain such a diverse multiplicity of narratives, legal codes, allegorical and poetic materials, wisdom literature, and horatory homiletics that covering all possible biblical subject matter even in the extensive day school curriculum is virtually impossible. Choices between emphasizing - or even reading - given sections of the Bible in the classroom have always had to be made. What is chosen for study in the contemporary supplementary school or day school curriculum often recapitulates those texts which were chosen by schoolteachers and rabbis in earlier periods of Jewish history. These choices between biblical texts, traditionally made by male teachers of male students, typically focus on narratives about male characters in the Bible, and on lists of behavioral codes which provided the basis and rationale for the complex structure of rabbinic law. Narratives about biblical men were not only intellectually mastered by students but also absorbed into the informing myths, the emotional intelligence of the Jewish boys who became Jewish men. For example, the biblical Jacob's difficult wanderings through a sometimes overtly and some times subtly hostile world resonated for Diaspora Jewish readers. Jacob was not only renamed Israel but became the symbol of the Jewish people in their own minds. As a people more often than not in positions of subordination or vulnerability, Diaspora Jews could identify closely with Jacob's predicaments and his particular methods for dealing with a destiny which threatened him, his family, and his way of life. God's consoling words to Jacob - "Do not fear, my servant Jacob," al tirah avdi Ya ' akov , echoed and consoled his descendants.</page><page sequence="3">64 SHOFAR Summer 1998 Vol. 16, No. 4 Historically, the Jews as individuals and as a nation have often felt that their physical and spiritual survival, like that of Jacob, depended on their battling an unfair destiny with any means at hand. Forbidden to study the Torah, they studied in secret. Barred from agricultural and artisan's guilds, they lent money, collected taxes, and worked as peddlers and middlemen. When Jewish men read and thought and sang about Jacob and Moses and David, their biblical ancestors, they saw their own lives foreshadowed. They identified with the biblical figures, and this identification made their own lives more meaningful and more bearable. They became members of a trans- historical and trans-national Jewish global village. The Bible also includes substantial materials about women, including biblical narratives about women, poetic materials which deal with allegorical figures of women, and behavioral codes which deal with women. These texts have not been adequately studied or emphasized in traditional Jewish schools - despite the fact that the materials, and even the precedents are there, if one cares to look. Biblical texts provide fascinating female models of cleverness, courage, resilience, and leadership in the characters of Rebecca, Jochebed, Miriam, Hannah, Deborah, Yael, Ruth, Naomi, and Esther. Some of these women have been highlighted in the yearly cycle of Jewish worship services. On the awesome first day of Rosh Hashanah, Jews traditionally address their creator with such male images as "our Father, our King," but both the Torah and the Haftorah readings tell the vivid, viscerally gripping stories of women who passionately desire to be mothers in Israel and eventually succeed in their goals, against all odds producing a nation and the leaders of a nation. On Purim Jews read the Book of Esther, a fable-like story in which a beautiful woman courageously outmaneuvers a demagogue and saves a nation by her wits. On Passover the service includes the Song of Songs, more than half of whose lyrics express the experiences and emotions of a voluptuous bride; rabbinic interpretation, calling the song of Songs the "holiest of the holies," and forbidding exegetes from stripping it of its immediate human power, explains that the extravagantly female bride represents the Jewish people on their spiritual and historical journey. On Shavuot, the Book of Ruth tells the story of two women upon whom rests the temporal and messianic future of the Jewish people. And on Tisha B'Av, the reading of Lamentations focuses on the destruction of, and the exile from, Jerusalem in the personified figure of a woman - the vivid desolation of Bat Tzion, the princess of Zion. Similarly, in the Bible, the Deity is often described with anthropomorphic imagery. Most often, the imagery is strikingly male, including images of God as a man of war. However, more often than is commonly realized - and certainly more than is commonly studied in Jewish schools- the biblical God is pictured in clearly feminine imagery. Even day school students are often unaware that the book of Isaiah compares God to a gestating, birthing, and nursing mother, who nurtures the Jewish people. The lessons of female-centered anthropomorphism - and its male counterpart - are that people want to picture a God who meets their needs. When they are fighting fierce enemies, it is</page><page sequence="4">Integrating Jewish and Feminist Educational Goals 65 comforting to picture God as a man of war; when they are desolate, it is comforting to picture God as a mother who will always nurture them and will never forget them. Other feminine types of imagery abound in biblical texts. Often when God is pictured as the man the entire Jewish people are pictured as a woman, especially in prophetic literature, and their relationship is that of lover and beloved, husband and wife. Familial relationships are common images and reference points in biblical texts, and yet few classrooms concentrate on the meaning, impact, and ramifications of references to beloved children and faithful young wives. Unfortunately, Jewish schools have seldom focused upon the biblical women in narratives or allegorical, poetical texts; in our classrooms, biblical women are seldom studied as literary characters, religious models, or mythic symbols of the Jewish experience. Jewish educators today face the challenge of reversing these educational lacunas. This approach does not imply diminishing the significance of texts with ancient authority and deep historical and spiritual significance. Our students must continue to learn about and remember the struggles and wanderings of the Patriarchs who were the fathers of the Jewish people; the dramatic story of Joseph and his brothers; the saga of Moses; the wars and chaos and emerging leadership of the Jewish kingdom(s); Samuel's wisdom and strength and painful double king-making; the heroism, poetry - and poor judgment - of David; the glory and corruptions and brotherly warfare and eventual decline of the Jewish states; the passionate denunciations and consolations of the great prophets, with their lonely but haunting voices. However, this approach insists that narratives about Jewish women should be accorded deep significance as well. In addition, the approach to women should be one committed to considering them as serious spiritual creatures. For example, when talking about Rebecca, rather than focusing on the episode of the little girl at the well, in which Rebecca plays the ingenue swept away to meet Prince Charming in a kind of Cinderella story, Jewish educators should help the class examine the role of Rebecca as an author of Jewish destiny and the prophetic link between Abraham and Jacob. It is Rebecca, after all, who communicates directly with God, and is informed directly by her Creator of the differences between the children in her womb. It is she - and not her husband the Patriarch - who understands Jacob's innate appropriateness as a spiritual leader of the Jewish people. It is important that Jewish educators not be misled as modern readers by Rebecca's deceptiveness. In biblical literature deceptiveness is an acceptable strategy, as long as one is promoting God's agendas. Indeed, Jacob learns much from his mother about how to manipulate appearances to deal with unfairness. Similarly, classes can spend more time reading and discussing that unlikely trio of women in Egypt who worked together to deceive and outwit a major patriarchal world power, the infanticidal Pharaoh. Jocebed, Miriam, and Pharaoh's daughter, desperately and together, insured that there would be a new generation of Jewish men and a leader</page><page sequence="5">66 SHOFAR Summer 1998 Vol. 16, No. 4 to take both men and women out of Egypt. The character of Miriam, in particular, lends itself to extended analysis. The class can look at Miriam in various biblical texts and at her treatment in midrashic literature. They can discuss the development of her positive and negative characteristics [promoter of the Jewish family - but gossiping woman], how they are connected, and what they might have meant to commentators at various points in Jewish history. Older students can talk about differing kinds of female heroism: Rebecca, Tamar, Ruth, Deborah, Esther. They can look at the extraordinary attitudes of the biblical text toward the sexual assertiveness of Tamar, as she confronts the patriarchal power of Judah and is rewarded because she, too, is furthering a divine agenda. Educators can help students explore the parallels between two ancestresses of the Davidic line, Tamar and Ruth, who both take enormous chances. Young adolescents struggling with issues of friendship can explore the transcendent friendship models presented by Ruth and Naomi and David and Jonathan, discussing the parallels in these two sets of relation- ships. The biblical texts themselves show us the way, providing us with striking parallels between the experiences of Rebecca and her son Jacob, Jocebed and her son Moses, Naomi and Ruth and their descendent David. Jewish classrooms can introduce the concept that the actions of the mothers foreshadow the experiences of their children, ma ' asei imahot siman libanim , as well as ma 'asei avot siman lebanim , deeds of the fathers signaling the lives of their sons. Teaching post-biblical Jewish history and rabbinic texts, the contemporary teacher is virtually forced into dealing with gender issues, to some extent. Fortunately, many useful analyses of gender issues in Jewish history, culture, and societies have been published over the past two decades. The educator can make use of these analyses either in preparation or as a direct text for the class. S/he will also, however, need to be prepared to talk about painful subjects, such as the limits of women's lives in the ancient world. If educators do not talk about these limitations and the heroism of women despite the limitations which surrounded them, students will not acquire the tools which they need to make their rich and richly gendered tradition meaningful. The role and status of women in rabbinic literature is, of course, a most compli- cated subject. Negative statements should probably not be totally avoided, because discussing some of them allows the educator to contextualize these materials for the student. Students will almost certainly at some point in their college careers or later reading encounter the Talmudic statement, "He who teachers his daughter [advanced] Torah, it is as if he taught her licentiousness" - but the statement will almost certainly be quoted out of context. By putting Rabbi Meir's admittedly troubling statement back into the original discussion of Sotah, however, students will have the opportunity to talk about gender role construction, the value and implications of marital loyalty, Jewish conceptions of appropriate sexual relationship, historical mistrust of the intellectual</page><page sequence="6">Integrating Jewish and Feminist Educational Goals 67 woman in many cultures [think of the American reaction to Hillary Clinton!], and other significant issues. While the Talmud contains notably misogynist texts, it also includes some texts which are movingly pro-woman, and these should be emphasized, both because female and male students each need to know that such passages - and the men who created them - are part of the Talmudic heritage, and because of their value as precedents. Educators can, for example, introduce material about Rabbi Ishmael, the towering second-century rabbinic figure who insisted that when women brought a sacrifice in the Temple, the sacrificial animal should be brought around to the ezrat nas him, the women's section, so that the woman could participate in the ritual of semicha , laying her hands upon and leaning upon the animal involved. Rabbi Ishmael insisted that the concept of a woman's nahat ruach , her joyous peace of mind or spiritual satisfaction, necessitated her access to the same sacrificial rituals in which men participated. It is appropriate as well to discuss the description of Rabbi Ishmael's martyrdom in the High Holiday liturgy; he is portrayed as a man so appealing to women that the non- Jewish tyrant's daughter pleaded unsuccessfully with her father to spare Rabbi Ishmael's life. In addition, according to Jewish tradition, when Rabbi Ishmael died, the women of Israel wept, because of his well-known friendship for them. Equal Opportunity Jewish Education In certain ways, women have made great strides in terms of Jewish education today. The ubiquitousness of the Bat Mitzvah has had a critical and not always acknowledged side-effect: the celebration of Bat Mitzvah among American Jewish females over the past two decades has virtually erased the gender gap in Jewish education. Before the Bat Mitzvah became popular, one-third of American Jewish women used to receive no formal Jewish education whatsoever; today, the fact that girls, like boys, must prepare for Bat Mitzvah has brought them into supplementary schools and day schools at nearly the same rates as their brothers. Thus, Bat Mitzvah is the link to the formal Jewish education which has emerged as the true "Jewish connection" for American Jewish women today. Although many opinions in rabbinic law state that intensive formal Jewish education is inappropriate for females, high-level Jewish education for women was actually initiated on a wide scale a century ago, in a daring response to the challenges of secular modernity. Observing that in enlightened societies Jewish women who lacked deep knowledge of Judaic texts might more easily drift away from Jewish lifestyles, Sara Schnirer, a pious Eastern European woman who had been well educated in Germany, established the Bais Yaakov movement, which revolutionized Jewish education for girls. Today, the basic assumptions underlying the formation of the Bais Ya'akov schools have now been accepted by even the most ultra-Orthodox groups in</page><page sequence="7">68 SHOFAR Summer 1998 Vol. 16, No. 4 the United States: the education of girls is widely viewed as a necessity for the preservation of a traditional Jewish way of life. In day schools ranging from the Satmar school, Bais Rochel, which eliminates the twelfth grade to make sure its graduates cannot attend college, to coeducational Orthodox schools such as Ramaz in New York and Maimonides in Boston, which provide outstanding secular education and teach then- boys and girls Talmud together, the crucial necessity for providing girls with a Jewish education has become an undisputed communal priority. During the past decade, it has also become increasingly popular for Orthodox young women to spend a year of religious study in Israeli yeshivot between high school and college. In addition, Stern College for Women, an undergraduate school of Yeshiva University, now offers courses in Talmud, as do a growing number of Orthodox synagogues. Schools which teach adult women biblical and rabbinic texts are proliferating in many locales, under differing denominational and trans-denominational auspices. The fact that Lubavitch schools still assiduously avoid teaching Talmudic texts to girls masks the little publicized fact that the late Lubavitcher Rebbe stated that women should be taught the Gemara in order to preserve the quality of Jewish life, and in order that the tradition should be passed down from generation to generation. In a Hebrew article, he urges that women be taught the oral Torah so that they, who provide the most consistent presence in the home, can supervise and guide their children's religious studies. They should study with their husbands subjects even including the "fine, dialectical" points of law which most previous rabbis posited as being inappropriate for women. These study sessions are necessary, says Rabbi Schneerson, because without them women can easily be seduced by the charms of secular studies. He says: "It is human nature for male and female to delight in this kind of study. Through this there will develop in them [the women] the proper sensitivities and talents in the spirit of our Holy Torah." Indeed, today in every wing of Judaism from the traditional right to the creative left, advanced schools of Jewish education which either cater to women or are coeducational are flourishing. Jewish Women's Scholarship Scholars interested in analyzing the connections between gender, religion, social and historical change, and cultural milieu have explored the history of women in Jewish societies from the Bible onward, and have produced scores of pioneering works on Jewish women in the fields of Bible studies, rabbinics, history, literature, sociology, psychology, and popular culture. These scholarly works have had a significant impact on individual departments, on particular fields, and on Judaic Studies as a whole. Academic women are organized into a Women's Caucus at the Association for Jewish Studies conference, which enables them to more closely attend to each other's works and to supportively share their experiences in the field. Thousands of students each year</page><page sequence="8">Integrating Jewish and Feminist Educational Goals 69 take college courses taught by feminist scholars which focus on women in Judaism. Moreover, not only college and university students have been affected by the ground-breaking writing of Jewish feminist scholars such as Tikvah Frymer-Kensky, Ross Kraemer, Nehama Aschkenasy, Carol Meyers, Susan Niditch, Judith Hauptman, Judith Baskin, Paula Hyman, Marion Kaplan, Deborah Dash Moore, Chava Weissler, and Riv-Ellen Prell, to name just a few representative scholars among many dozens of actively publishing academics. The insights of female academics are slowly being incorporated into Jewish studies curricula for children, teenagers, and adults as well. Each of the major religious groups has devoted time at recent conferences to discussing incorporating gender issues and women's studies into their religious school curriculums, and Brandeis University Women's Studies Program held a conference on "Gender in the Day Schools" (February 1996) which has been expanded into an ongoing national initiative. Gender Roles in Jewish Laws and Customs Practical Judaism provides yet another area of educational challenge. Most Jewish classrooms devote some time to Jewish laws and rituals. In making these discussions less gender-driven, educators will not only be sensitive to feminist goals, but will also be dealing with the changing American Jewish household. Given the demographic realities of the contemporary Jewish community, educators should consider freeing the discussion of ritual from non-essential gendering most appropriate in primarily family-structured societies. American Jews today tend to stay single for a long time. If children are taught that Imah lights the Shabbat candles and Abbah makes the kiddush blessing over wine, single Jews often avoid Sabbath rituals until their households fit that particular family constellation. Few non-Orthodox singles make the connection that candles, kiddush, and havdallah belong to every Shabbat regardless of how many or few men and women live in a particular household. Sadly, for many singles years of avoidance mean that a Jewishly active home is in fact never established. Similar concerns sometimes apply to divorced households as well. Divorced women with little girls should be educated to know that they don't need a man to recite kiddush; divorced men should not feel they are compromising their manhood to light Sabbath candles. Ironically, if the creation of "Jewish family values" is an educational goal, teaching rituals in a non-family setting may be the most effective strategy to bringing Jewish families about eventually. Working Toward Change The lives and expectations of Jewish women and men today are quite different from those of Jews in earlier periods of Jewish history and in other societies. However, despite change, Judaic study remains a significant Jewish activity. Intellectual activities</page><page sequence="9">70 SHOFAR Summer 1998 Vol. 16, No. 4 are critical to Jewish life, and learning is a form of Jewish activism. By working toward classroom situations in which Jewish females are accorded central spiritual significance, Jewish educators can help girls and women access Judaism in the most positive way. In addition, by making the Jewish classroom a female-friendly environment, Jewish educators will move toward training both men and women to see the full human potential in their Judaic tradition and in each other.</page></plain_text>
