<plain_text><page sequence="1">MICHAEL LEVIN REALISMS ABSTRACT. It is argued that the general thesis of realism is ill-defined, as are various versions of its denial. Only specific theses of the form 'There are #'s' make clear sense. It is also argued that various efforts to deny realism always turn out to deny specific existential theses. Thus, it is argued, van Fraassen and Schwartz deny the existence of electrons. 1. Discussions of realism characteristically defend or attack some thesis, formulated with a high degree of generality, taken to capture realist intuitions. My aim here is to challenge the presupposition of these discussions - that there is some clear, general thesis of realism. I maintain, to the contrary, that only particular theses of the form There are things of sort K' ('K' a schematic letter for class abstracts) have a clear sense. I understand realism about electrons, the thesis that there are electrons, and antirealism about electrons, the thesis that there are no electrons; I recognize electron agnosticism for people who can't make up their minds. Mutatis mutandis for realism about mice, physical objects, sets and all other subjects of ontological dispute. Some theses commonly offered as explications of 'realism' are perfectly meaningful, but, as I argue below, they either fail to capture what realists seem to be trying to say, or collapse into specific realisms. Realism is always specific, or, more accurately, there are only realisms. Obviously, some realisms are more general than others. Realism about K is more general than realism about L if it is assumed that all Ls are K but not all Ks are Ls. Since all electrons are subatomic particles but not conversely (if there are subatomic particles), realism about subatomic particles is more general than realism about electrons. Equally clearly, arguments germane to different realisms fall in different places along the empirical/a priori continuum. Gryphon antirealism rests on failure to spot gryphons where they might be expected to be observed, while Goodman's set antirealism rests on the a priori premise Synthese 85: 115-138, 1990. ? 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers. Printed in the Netherlands.</page><page sequence="2">116 MICHAEL LEVIN that distinct objects differ in their atoms. Belief in electrons is based on physical effects like those measured by Millikan, belief in the con tinuum of real numbers on the provability of (3x)(x =P(co)) in standard set theory. This variation in the generality of realisms and the ab stractness of arguments about them does nothing to impeach the plural ism I advocate, since it reflects only the variety of kinds of things that may exist. Nor does this variation show 'existence' to be ambiguous or the modes of existence multiple, since, again, this variation can be explained by the qualitative variety of the sorts of things whose exis tence is disputed. Considerations relevant to gryphons differ from those relevant to sets because the supposed mass and opacity of gryphons would affect human sense organs, whereas sets are supposed neither massive nor opaque. Were 'exist' ambiguous, there would be pairs of entities which seem to exist in different ways and whose seeming ontological difference could not equally plausibly be explained by differ ences in their putative properties. As no such pair of objects has ever been convincingly displayed, there is no point to classifying realisms by their generality, abstractness or a priority. The realisms affirmed or denied on the basis of arguments of any sort come marching singly.1 The construal of K in 'realism about K ' as a schematic letter rather than a set variable has several advantages. It permits Goodmanians, who do not believe in sets, to accept my characterization of realisms. It also avoids opacity problems. If Ki = K2, it must be possible to block the inference from A's being a A^-realist to his being a 7?2-realist. The inference can be blocked even if Kx and K2 are objects, but the problem does not so much as arise if, K being schematic, iK1 = K2 is shorthand for \x)(KiX = K2x)\ So long as the predicates 'i^x' and 'K2x' are distinct, there is no presumption that 'Ki and 'K2 are interchangeable anywhere, let alone at the K position in 'A is a realist about K\ Schemata also facilitate ascription of belief in indescribable, inconceiv able things. The problem raised by indescribabilia is not merely that they may be too numerous to form a set, but that sets of indescribabilia threaten informal paradox. From the perspective of set theory, forming a set amounts to describing its members. However, by defining 'describ able' as 'describable in terms of [some antecedently specified set of predicates]', and eliminating the class abstract '[x: x is not describable]' in favor of the predicate 'jc is not describable', we may talk of indescriba bilia without describing them. Note, incidentally, that there is no bias</page><page sequence="3">REALISMS 117 toward nominalism in the use of schematic letters over set variables. If K is [x: x is an abstract entity], Platonism is realism about this K. Suppose F(t) contains a term t purporting to refer to things of sort K, and A(F) is a proposed analysis of F(t). When is A(F) so heterodox as to amount to antirealism about Ksl Philosophical 'analyses' often look suspiciously like repudiation, and the question arises in passing in my subsequent discussions of idealism and 'worldmaking'. Clearly, A repudiates K if A(F) contains no term which serves as the counterpart of t. ZF set theory fails to preserve the set of ordinals ??, for instance, because ZF construes statements containing 'ii' as equivalent to state ments containing the predicate 'x is an ordinal' and terms for individual ordinals, but no counterpart for 'ii'. Ryle is taken as an antirealist about minds because his analyses of statements using 'the mind' have no counterparts for 'the mind'. It may appear, in addition, that A preserves Ks if A(F) contains a term A(t) because many analyses which meet this condition are also preservative. For instance, the analysis of lim? _?oc an = a as (r)(3n)(n')(n' &gt; n D \an&gt; ? a\ &lt; r) gives 'a' in the analysandum a counterpart - 'a' itself - in the analysans, and this analysis intuitively preserves limits (although not infinity). On reflec tion, however, the condition is not sufficient. ZF analyses '1 &lt; 2' as '[0] E [0, [0]]', with '[0]' the counterpart of T, yet many commentators regard ZF as having eliminated numbers in favor of sets. Evidently, the pressure for saying this is generated by the preanalytic assumption that numbers, whatever they are, should exist in addition to sets, So a further condition for A preserving Ks is that Ks not be supposed to exist in addition to A(t)s. Beyond this, it is difficult to say when analyses analyze and when they repudiate. Certainty A(t) must not be too different from what Ks are supposed to be, but what is 'too different'? Intuitions about the analysis of mereological sums in particular resist rational reconstruction. We don't deny the existence of salt molecules even though they are known to be composed of sodium and chlorine atoms, yet most people would at least hesitate before agreeing that the world contains flocks of birds as well as birds. Surely, though, the only difference between salt molecules and bird flocks is the rigidity of connection between their respective parts. So it may be impossible to formalize the idea of an analysis repudiating a class of objects, and therefore to prove that a given analysis does indeed repudiate a given class of objects. At the</page><page sequence="4">118 MICHAEL LEVIN same time we are not without intuitions on the matter, and can usually tell when this is the case. My overall thesis does, however, clearly imply one negative corollary important enough to announce in advance. If realism about Ks is just belief in Ks and antirealism about Ks is just disbelief in Ks, then antirealism in philosophy of science must deny the existence of many of the posits of scientific theories. Antirealism in philosophy of science is inconsistent with science itself. Antirealism cannot confine itself to the metalanguage, pleading neutrality on questions internal to science and purporting only to interpret the language of science's answers. As I show in Sections 5 and 6 below, antirealists don't believe in electrons. 2. I will explain my doubts about the coherence of 'realism' ?berhaupt by examining some representative definitions of 'realism'. I do not claim exhaustiveness, but the reader will glean from my remarks on mind independence, scientific realism, and conceptual relativism how I would handle attempts to characterize realism that I do not deal with. It is disingenuous to pretend that no well-formed thesis comes any where near capturing realist intuitions. Easily the best such candidate is: (1) The world is mind-independent. This is a good stab at 'realism' because Berkeley's denial of unperceived things, and his construal of ostensible categoricals about unperceived things as disguised hypotheticals about experience, is often described as Berkeley's disbelief in the 'real world'. Nevertheless, reality and mind-independence are distinct. Not only can there be mental things, the insistence that there are is nowadays realism of sorts. Eliminative materialists deny mental phenomena, and their critics, who affirm the existence of minds or the occurrence of mental events, are surely to be reckoned realists about minds or conscious beings. Similarly, those stirred by Kripke's flirtation with solipsism2 to reaffirm their belief in other minds deserve to be called realists about other minds. Anti-idealism can be rephrased, in one form for the eliminativist and another for his critics: (1A) There are (only) nonmental things; and</page><page sequence="5">REALISMS 119 (IB) There are mental things and nonmental things. Either can serve as realism, but each is also a realism in my sense. (1A) is realism about nonmental things, while (IB) is realism about nonmental and mental things. What they have in common is realism about matter or physical objects, a capacious yet definite kind of thing. If (1A) and (IB) are viewed as denying Berkeleyanism, as I think they should be, Berkeleyanism must be viewed as antirealism about physical objects - a doctrine about what there happens (not) to be rather than a doctrine about what being is. This interpretation preserves outrage ousness, an advantage where Berkeley is concerned, since the secret of Berkeley's fascination is precisely his apparent denial of things like tables. Should I be told that Berkeley wasn't denying the existence of tables, merely alleging the translatability of table-talk into experience talk, it suffices to record the definition of 'table' in the Random House College Dictionary, "an article of furniture consisting of a flat slablike top supported by one or more legs". This definition is mum about experience, as are the follow-up definitions of 'furniture,' Teg' and 'slab'. So if Berkeleyanism is to be more than an obvious mistake about the word 'table', it had better imply that there are no tables in the dictionary sense - in which case it stands revealed as, what everyone senses it to be, antirealism about material objects. Kant distinguishes 'transcendental' idealism from Berkeley's 'empiri cal' idealism (and Descartes' 'problematic' idealism); perhaps denial of 'transcendental' idealism offers additional scope to realism as mind independence. Perhaps, that is, 'realism' should be understood as what Kant calls 'transcendental realism'; Putnam so defines it, pejoratively.3 Yet, without wishing to augment the vast explicative literature on Kant's distinction, I would note its seeming irrelevance to realism. Abstracting from the other metaphysical and epistemological issues Kant sought to raise, his distinction would appear to amount to the following. Empirical realism is the thesis that 'outer objects', physical things in space and time, are directly perceived. Kant evidently accepts empirical realism. What he denies is that these 'outer objects' are noumena, and he uses 'transcendental realism' to denote the alleged error of supposing that outer objects are noumenal. Physical things, rather, are appearances of the noumena, and real in that sense, but physical things are not real in the way noumena are. However, on reflection, Kant has conflated two senses in which things (of any sort)</page><page sequence="6">120 MICHAEL LEVIN may be appearances, a conflation disguised by a dependence on the ambiguity of 'appear'. When Kant calls physical objects appearances of noumena, he might mean that noumena appear to us as physical objects in the sense in which Halloween trick-or-treaters appear to us as ghosts. This usage is syncategorematic: there are objects which give the appearance of being so-and-so, but there are no appearances; 'appearance' is not a referring term. In this sense, there are no physical objects that noumena appear to be (assuming the rest of Kant's theory) any more than there are ghosts that trick-or-treaters appear to be. If this is how Kant is using 'appearance', his ontology consists exclusively of noumena which appear to us to be physical objects. Empirical real ism becomes false, there being only noumena and no physical objects at all. Transcendental idealism becomes anti-realism about physical objects, a view too close to Berkeley's to be a circumspect intermediary between Berkeley's and commonsense. Avoiding such a conclusion - and Kant bridled at the comparison with Berkeley - demands a use of 'appearance' under which X has a Y-ish appearance' entails the existence of an appearance (not necessar ily Y-ish) which X has. Appearances in this categorematic sense are something like the masks of trick-or-treaters or the facades of buildings. If this is how Kant is using 'appearance', his world is populated by noumena and their appearances, namely physical objects in space time. That this usage and its attendant ontology is Kant's considered final view is suggested by his painstaking distinction of appearances [Erschei nungen] from illusion [Scheinen] in the B edition of the first Critique: the handles on Saturn are Scheinen but not Erscheinungen because they do not exist. But if physical objects are appearances in this sense of 'appearance', they enjoy an existence as little in need of qualification as the noumena. They exist as fully as the noumena, just as masks exist as fully as tricksters and facades exist just as fully as interior structures. Once again the distinction between empirical and transcendental real ism has collapsed, empirical realism becoming simple realism about physical objects. Evidently what was going on in Kant's mind was that he conceived the world without noumenal selves as composed exclusively of nonspatio-temporal noumena, but that the perception (or 'perception') of these 'ordinary' noumena by noumenal selves brought space time objects into existence. For Kant this meant that the existence bestowed on space time objects was second-class. What he failed to</page><page sequence="7">REALISMS 121 understand clearly enough is that once something is brought into exis tence, by whatever means, it exists just as much as things whose exis tence is eternal. In sum, there is no clear distinction between empirical and transcen dental realism, so it is pointless to specify realism tout court as transcen dental as opposed to empirical realism. 3. A conception of realism different in spirit from anti-idealism is scientific realism, which comes in a variety of forms. (2A) Current scientific theories are true. This thesis does not express realism in any general sense because most of the things characteristically postulated by various realists, if such things exist at all, would have existed had our current science never developed. Since scientific theories would not have been true had they never existed, the truth of science is not necessary for the existence of anything apart perhaps from textbooks, laboratories, and endowed chairs. (2A) is not entailed by realist intuitions, and therefore cannot explicate them. (2A) suffices for each realism it entails, but only trivially; current science is true because, in part, of the existence of its posits. Its posits don't exist because the theory positing them is true. (We look in Section 6 at the idea that positing objects makes them.) The same argument disposes of a second version of scientific realism: (2B) Ideal science - what will or would emerge from the faithful pursuit of scientific method - is true. Once again, (2B) fails to express a necessary condition of realist intuitions. Man and his inductive canons need not have existed for anything else to exist (apart from the trivial exceptions noted in connec tion with (2A)). Since the existence of ideal science is unnecessary for most realisms, so a fortiori is its truth. We wouldn't know about what exists if we didn't have science, but that is a separate issue. I am apt to be told, a little impatiently, that a theory need not be in a world to be true of it. If scientific realism is the thesis that actual or ideal science is true of the actual world, whether or not ideal science</page><page sequence="8">122 MICHAEL LEVIN existed in it, then it expresses a necessary condition for realism after all. So perhaps the right version of scientific realism is: (2C) Ideal science is true of any possible world just like ours except perhaps for not containing ideal science. Now we have something to work with. To see why (2C) still does not express realism in any sufficiently general sense, let Ku . , Kn, . . . be the predicates of ideal science - call it S - and let e(S), or the existential of 5, be the set [(3x)K?x: S\- (3x)K?x]. (The countability assumption is unnecessary.) Next, observe that S is true at a world w only if each member of e(S) is, and that (3x)K?x is true at w only if there is at least one K? in w. Since that is how truth for existential generalizations is defined, the existence of K?s can't be de fined in terms of the truth of S. S is true of our world because of what is in it, not vice-versa. Scientific realism construed as the truth of S asserts no more than the conjunction of S" s existential. (2C) thus fuses with a specific family of realisms, or, if S cannot now be stated explicitly enough for its existential to be clear, (2C) collapses into the tautology that what is truly said to exist does exist. With abandonment of possible-world explications of modality, the counterfactual truth of S - introduced to finesse the possibility of S's nonexistence - comes to this: S would still have been true if nobody had thought of S but everything else that exists had existed. This asserts no more than the existence of the specific sorts of things said to exist by S. Two other explications of realism fall victim to similar arguments. (2D) Science aims at truth. Human aspirations are not necessary for the existence of anything other than certain social institutions and material artifacts. (3) Scientific terms refer. Yet again, the reference of terms is not necessary for the existence of anything, since what exists would for the most part have existed if language never evolved. The referent of a term t must exist if t refers, but only because 't refers' means (3x)(t refers to x). "'Muon' refers" implies the existence of muons, but as an explication of muon existence it is pointlessly roundabout. One can imagine a noncircular definition of 't refers' relative to which existence is primitive - a definition of the</page><page sequence="9">REALISMS 123 form F(t, . . .), where F(i, . . .) is a long story about utterances, utter ance classes, speakers, speakers' intentions, and so on - but one cannot imagine a noncircular definition of 'exists' relative to which reference is primitive. (4) "Charity constrains interpretation." (4) is related to (2A) and (2B). A speaker, it is argued, cannot be understood unless his beliefs largely agree with those of his interpreter. Therefore I could not understand anyone who systematically disagreed with me, and what I cannot understand I cannot suppose true. So systematic error is impossible. Whatever one thinks of the impossibility of error in this sense - which seems to involve inferring that no one could correctly disagree with me from the impossibility of my recognizing correct systematic disagreement - it is an unsuitable expression of realism. My conceptual scheme need not have existed at all, so its correctness cannot be neces sary for the existence of (almost) anything. What there is would have been had there been no conceptual scheme systematic deviation from which was unrecognizable by me. (5) Ideal science might be false; / might be a brain in a vat. This conception of realism, a specification of (1) and a sort of modal contrary of (2B), is of course Putnam's. But once again, since the existence of ideal science is unnecessary for the existence of most things, so is its possible falsity. Explanation (5) is a picturesque way of saying that (2B) is true but not contingently so, and as such falls victim to the same argument that felled (2B) as a statement of realism. Just as 'scientific realism' does not name any one general doctrine, specific realisms cannot usefully be classified as scientific or nonscien tific. The evidence for a realism can be more or less scientific - that is, collected in more or less self-conscious accord with Mill's methods - but, as noted many times, the evidential remoteness of things of kind K reflects the kinds of creatures we are as much as it does the kind of thing K is. For long-lived observers, evolution (for instance) would more resemble a process they see than a process they infer. As always, what remain are only individual claims about what exists, each to be assessed in its own right by the appropriate evidence. The adjective 'scientific' adds nothing.</page><page sequence="10">124 MICHAEL LEVIN 4. There is a final formulation of. realism not anthropomorphic in the way (2A)-(5) are, and not subject to the same criticisms. (6) Every statement is true or false. The intuition here is that truth value gaps open up or indicate indeter minacies, so bivalence is necessary for the world to be 'fixed' or 'defi nite'. But failure of bivalence does not unfix anything when bivalence fails for reasons internal to language. The chief linguistic disrupters of bivalence are generally considered to be meaninglessness, vacuous reference, and vagueness. It is easy to see that the first two create no ontological slack. Bivalence fails for meaningless sentences because meaningless sentences lack truth conditions. There is, I suppose, no 'fact of the matter' as to whether blub blub blub, but not in a way that implies any indeterminacy in the nature of blub. Since 'blub blub' is meaningless, we are not talking about anything when (attempting to) talk about the nature of blub. Vacuous reference for its part may be handled by any one of several techniques for assigning truth values to sentences with empty terms. There may be little to be said for any of these techniques, relatively or absolutely, beyond their restoration of bivalence, but adopting one of them is surely the simplest course if bivalence is considered crucial. The third language-based challenge, vagueness, initially seems no more likely to unfix anything beyond language. I am a borderline 'bald man', yet there is nothing indeterminate about my head. I have exactly as many hairs as I have, but the rule for 'bald' implicit in ordinary usage does not determine whether that many hairs counts as 'bald' or not. Roy Sorensen argues that the situation is much graver, however. We face 'the heart-break of Sorites' and with it the eruption of countless inconsistencies in our normal view of the world unless there is some n such that n-haired men are bald and n + 1-haired men thatched, and similarly for all other vague predicates.5 A fully developed theory of vagueness would be digressive, but an outline of a naturalistic view of language can preserve vagueness and explain our Sorites intuitions without questioning the application of a single ordinary predicate. If the meaning of 'bald' is its use in various circumstances, simply graph each speaker's readiness to assent to</page><page sequence="11">REALISMS 125 'bald?' as the number of hairs on heads presented to him increase from 0. At some number n he will begin to hesitate, at a later point he will say nothing if a choice is not forced, and at a still later point he will begin, hesitatingly, to assent to 'not bald\ The typical speaker is not wrong to begin to hesitate at the point at which he does, since, if meaning is use, there is a difference between n and (n - 1) - haired men; neurological factors of which the speaker is unaware cause n to be the point at which he begins to hesitate. Sorensen will want to know why, if the difference between n and n - 1 hairs is enough to make the speaker hesitate, it shouldn't make him dissent from 'bald'? Essentially the same answer: if meaning is use, the difference between n and n - 1 hairs isn't enough, and the speaker's judgments are entirely consistent. Words mean what they do mean, not what they ought to mean. This same nonjudgmental naturalistic approach can be applied to the worry raised by Quine and others about objects with changing molecular borders, like tables. Beginning with some clearly subtabular chunk from a table T, the ambitious experiment can graph the readiness of long lived informants to assent to "7"? as he adds molecules. The upshot will be parameters, like those obtained for 'bald', determining the vagueness of the predicate 'jc = T\ Moral: one can be as realistic as one pleases about bald heads and tables though vagueness disrupts bivalence. Bivalence is not necessary for any particular realism; even assuming realism in general were al ready understood, bivalence would therefore not be necessary for real ism in general. All right, then, bivalence is not necessary for realism, in that bival ence can fail for reasons internal to language. Is bivalence perhaps sufficient for realism, so that bivalence fails if the world is not 'fixed'? A more limited sufficiency thesis might be true, but also eminently in the spirit of my pluralism. It might be said that bivalence obviously holds of some sentences, and fails of just those sentences the reality corresponding to which is somehow indeterminate. Thus, the failure of bivalence for the continuum hypothesis, for instance, follows from the objective indeterminancy of the cardinality of the continuum. Very well, but notice then that bivalence and its failure cease to be criteria for realism in any general sense, but a long sequence of criteria for realisms: one for each sentence whose bivalence is up for grabs. Failure of bivalence for the continuum hypothesis may be evidence for (because a consequence of) the nonexistence of the continuum, but then it is</page><page sequence="12">126 MICHAEL LEVIN not failure-of-bivalence supporting anti-realism, but failure-of-biva lence-for-the-continuum-hypothesis support continuum-antirealism. I should note, incidentally, that philosophers who regard bivalence as the definition of realism characteristically do not regard failure of bivalence as a consequence of ontological anti-realism, or a symptom of nonexistences that could be antecedently established. Thus Dummett in 'The Philosophical Basis of Intuitionistic Logic': the celebrated thesis that mathematical statements do not relate to an objective mathema tical reality existing independently of us [as a justification for intuitionistic logic] . . . makes the question whether mathematical statements possess objective truth-values depend upon a prior decision as to the being of mathematical objects. And the difficulty about it lies in knowing on what we are to base the premiss that mathematical objects are the creations of human thought in advance of deciding what is the correct model for the meanings of mathematical statements or what is the correct conception of truth as relating to them. (Readings in Philosophy of Mathematics, eds. Paul Benacerraff and Hilary Putnam, 2nd ed. [Cambridge, 1983], pp, 109-110) On this conception, determination of bivalence must be autonomous and prior to ontological decision. So for anti-realists such as Dummett, at any rate, the idea of truth-value gaps being the result of some independent feature of the world itself is regarded as obscure. 5. Repeated failure to capture Realism confirms the hypothesis that all realist theses are indeed specific. In particular, 'scientific realism' came to no more than realism about the particular posits of particular theo ries. A further corollary, important in its own right, is that 'scientific antirealism' must deny the specific existence claims of specific scientific theories, although versions which dismiss truth as otiose may escape with agnosticism about scientific posits. Only relentless specificity will extract the antirealist's commitments. It is a capital error to conduct the discussion at the level of generality sought by antirealism: when an antirealist claims to deny only realistic interpretations of theory while accepting a theory itself, he must be asked if he believes there are electrons. Consider the claim of Bas van Fraassen that theories need only be 'empirically adequate' to be acceptable, and that scientists themselves expect no more.7 According to van Fraassen, the sense in which scientists 'accept' empirically ad equate theories does not imply literal belief. In his terminology, a</page><page sequence="13">REALISMS 127 theory is empirically adequate iff it has some model with a substructure isomorphic to experience; should a theory positing Ks have such a model, experience is as if there are Ks, but no stronger statement is warranted. Van Fraassen thus maintains that experience is as if there are electrons, but that this is the strongest statement that can be made. He rejects the argument that experience is inexplicable unless some theories about unobservables are true; explanation must end some where, van Fraassen observes, so explanation may be allowed to end at the character of experience. So, does van Fraassen believe in electrons? It is difficult to find a passage in which he denies their existence explicitly, but he comes close to doing so when discussing Millikan's experimental determination of the charge of the electron. As the reader will recall, oil droplets sus pended in an electrostatic field move about as they accrete ions from the surrounding air; Millikan calculated the charges responsible for the observed motion of such droplets to be multiples of 4.77 x 10"10 e.s.u. What was Millikan doing if not measuring the minimum natural charge? He was, according to van Fraassen, "filling in the blanks of a developing theory". Millikan's experiment showed how the blank is to be filled in if the theory is to be empirically adequate. . . . [W]hile it may be natural to use the terminology of discovery to report Millikan's results, the accurate way to describe it is that he was writing theory by means of his experimental apparatus.8 The phrase "writing theory by means of experimental apparatus" is far from clear. It could mean, simply, "writing down the implications of experiments", in which case van Fraassen's description is consistent with the conventional idea that Millikan's experiment is most plausibly explained by (and therefore supports) the existence of subvisible units of charge. However, the suggestio falso in "it may be natural to use the terminology of discovery" indicates that van Fraassen has something else in mind. I take it to be that, given the readings of Millikan's apparatus, "The unit natural charge is 4.77 x 10"10 e.s.u." is what you have to or ought to say, even though these readings do not show the presence of things previously unknown. As is evident from context, van Fraassen's reason for diffidence is not the epistemological point that the empirical adequacy of electron theory falls short of entailing the existence of electrons. One is forced to conclude that van Fraassen is an antirealist about electrons.</page><page sequence="14">128 MICHAEL LEVIN Understood as I have suggested, van Fraassen's view takes experience to be intrinsically inexplicable. In particular, it forbids the postulation of electrons to explain why phenomena are as if there were electrons. To avoid this consequence, van Fraassen claims the right to accord explanatory force to posits like electrons, on the grounds that "the assertion that theory T explains fact E does not presuppose or imply that Tis true".9 There are many examples, taken from actual usage, which show that truth is not pre supposed by the assertion that a theory explains something. Lavoisier said of the phlogis ton hypothesis that it is too vague and consequently 's'adapte a toutes les explications dans lesquelles on veut le faire entrer'. Darwin explicitly allows explanations by false theories when he says "It can hardly be supposed that a false theory would explain, in so satisfactory a manner as does the theory of natural selection, the several large classes of facts above specified." Gilbert Harman, we recall, has argued similarly: that a theory explains certain phenomena is part of the evidence that leads us to accept it. But that means that the explanation-relation is visible before we believe that the theory is true. Finally, we criticize theories selectively: a discussion of celestial mechanics around the turn of the century would surely contain the assertion that Newton's theory does explain many planetary phenomena. Yet it was also agreed that the advance of the perihelion of Mercury was inconsistent with the theory, suggesting therefore that the theory is not empirically adequate - and hence, is false - without this argument undermining the previous assertion. . . . Hence, to say that a theory explains some fact or other, is to assert a relation between this theory and that fact, which is independent of the question whether the real world, as a whole, fits the theory.10 In fact, van Fraassen is in error. If N is "The world consists of bodies in a Euclidean three-dimensional space attracting each other with an inverse-square force", it strikes me as flatly contradictory to say that N is why planetary orbits are elliptical even though space is not Euclidean. If the procession of Mercury's perihelion shows N to be false, N can no more be why anything happens than - to use Nancy Cartwright's example - water in the barrel of the lemon tree can be why its leaves are yellowing if there is no water in the barrel.11 To be sure, the intrinsic relation of entailment is visible between T and E independent of a determination of T's truth. When T entails E (and is sufficiently comprehensive and testable), T is regarded as a 'possible explanation' of E, to be promoted to the status of explanation should it prove true. Sometimes usage stretches to call a falsified possible explanation an 'explanation' in an inverted-commas sense; the passages van Fraassen cites are most simply construed along such lines. He cites</page><page sequence="15">REALISMS 129 no actual fin-de-si?cle physicist who spoke in the way he claims is proper, but surely any who did speak this way meant that the Mercury data can probably be made consistent with N, or, more likely, that N would have explained planetary motion had it not been falsified by pestiferous Mercury. Darwin and Harman, for their parts, are making the point that the conditions of comprehensiveness, testability, and entailment are so stringent that any potential explanation that meets them is probably true and therefore a genuine explanation. (In fact, Darwin seems to be using "explanation" of false alternatives to evo lution in roughly the sense of "unsatisfactory explanation", a usage which hardly supports van Fraassen's principal contention.) Lavoisier is making the different but related point that a hypothesis which entails any data whatever is ipso facto no explanation at all. In the end, van Fraassen's antirealism is denied even the figleaf of explanatory falsehoods. In seeking to expose van Fraassen's antirealism for what it is, I am not appealing to the idea that it is the truth of scientific theories which explains phenomena, or the conception of (scientific) realism associated with the argument that "the success of science would be miraculous unless science were true". Consistently with my own pluralism, I regard the inference-pattern: Theory T is predictively successful; The best explanation of 7"s success is 7"s truth; so T is probably true as entirely empty. The relevant explananda are always particular suc cesses of particular theories, and these successes are explained by the theories themselves, not their truth. The motion of oil droplets in an electrostatic field, a predictive success of electron theory, is not ex plained by the truth of "There are minimum charges", but by "There are minimum charges". Instead of saying that the success of science would be miraculous unless science were true, say that electric lights would be miraculous if there were no electrons.12 Resolutely ignoring the illusion of a grand fact called 'the success of science' dispels belief in a grand theory called 'the existence of the world of science'. There are only the particular sorts of things science says there are.</page><page sequence="16">130 MICHAEL LEVIN 6. It is considerably more difficult to coax antirealisms out of 'internal realism' or its kissing cousin conceptual relativism. Hilary Putnam's denial of a 'ready-made world' and an 'unconceptualized reality', along with Nelson Goodman's talk of 'worldmaking' certainly suggest that these authors view electrons as dependent on the 'conceptual scheme' in which they are recognized. Thus Putnam: the empirical world, as opposed to the noumenal world, depends upon our criteria of rational acceptability. ... I am saying that the 'real world' depends on our [scientific] values.13 This certainly sounds as if electrons wouldn't have existed without us. To be sure, artifacts like eyeglasses would not have existed if it weren't for us without it following that eyeglasses do not exist, but electrons are supposed to be natural objects. Electrons are normally assumed to be such that, if they exist at all, they would have existed whether or not we had. So Putnam does seem to be repudiating all things of the sort electrons are thought to be. Yet, just when the purport of conceptual relativism starts to become clear, its proponents inform us that their theory is a metaphorical gesture toward a deeper truth difficult to express literally. Thus Robert Schwartz's gloss on his claim that people 'make' stars: For if we do not actually take raw materials and work on it until it has starlike properties, surely we cannot be said to literally make stars. So at best the thesis of world-making would seem to come to no more than a play on the word 'make'. Perhaps so, but plays on words can be revealing. In this case, it may help us appreciate that the alternative picture of a world readymade ... is no less a play on words. ... A better picture emerges of the ways our cognitive efforts help fashion our world.14 Unfortunately, soon after allowing that we do not make the world in a 'physical crafting sense', Schwartz explains that "as the sculptor shapes what the figure is like, we shape what New Jersey is like".15 (Unfortunate, too, is Schwartz's insistence on using the obviously mind-made game of Scrabble as his standard example of the mind's constructive powers, when what is required is detailed exploration of an unobvious example.) Nor is the world's contribution to the world made clear. Schwartz talks of our 'helping' fashion the world, which suggests that the world</page><page sequence="17">REALISMS 131 has something to do with it, and he denies commitment to the consti tution of the world being entirely up to us: "we could not set the boundaries [of New Jersey] where they are and make it so that New Jersey has plentiful coal".16 Yet Schwartz also says that it is the human mind which imposes boundaries, distinctions and all other definite characteristics displayed by the world: By assigning importance to some features and downplaying others, our descriptive schemes shape what constitutes astronomical sameness - that which members of the star kind must share. The property itself of being a star is not preformed, merely awaiting a verbal label.... In seeking interesting ways to classify heavenly bodies and to make alliances between these kinds, we thus provide a basis for its being the case that this and not that, the sun and not the Evening star, are stars .... [A] world untouched either by human hand or mind. . . is, however, a stark world, stripped of facts and properties, bereft of any definite character or nature.17 If it is we who decide whether or not to (pardon the expression) lump the minerals in New Jersey with common anthracite and call both by one general name, the density of coal within New Jersey most certainly is within our power to change. (The commonsense response that this would be to change the meaning of 'coal' is unavailable to Schwartz, since [cf. fn. 19] he professes not to understand the change of mean ing/change of belief distinction.) Just prior to the stripping metaphor, Schwartz writes: "/i, the sun, was in the readymade world all along. Yet, independent of our fashioning the relevant properties and kinds, questions about what it is really like have neither any force nor any answers. We did not make it, we only helped determine what the facts about it are, which properties it can reasonably be said to possess, and, in particular, whether one of the classes it belongs to is the class of stars." Why just 'helped'? Since we fashioned the properties of 'being main sequence', 'being a fusion reaction' and 'being an ellipse', the sun would not have been a main sequence star, or powered by fusion, or located at one focus of an orbital ellipse without our help. There isn't anything about the Sun that we did not determine, if Schwartz is taken at his word. When one tries to unpack these metaphors by asking directly whether there would have been coal or electrons or stars in a schemeless world, the relativist generally answers that of course there would have been, according to the scheme we presently use to represent such a world. Of the existence of temporal intervals prior to the invention of calendars,</page><page sequence="18">132 MICHAEL LEVIN Schwartz says: "There would seem to be nothing particularly puzzling, for instance, in the fact that our temporal constructions establish the basis for precalendar Augusts as well as more recent ones".18 As this bypasses the question of whether there would have been Augusts - i.e., periods of time as long as our Augusts are - had mankind never evolved at all, we are still left wondering whether the relativist is having his cake or eating it. Evidently, what the relativist is attempting to say is that there would not have have been any electrons or stars or Augusts had we not chosen to use the predicates 'jc is an electron', 'jc is a star' or 'jc is a period of time one August long'. The idea is that the world no more inherently contains electrons than it inherently contains equestrian statues (as opposed to man-statues atop horse statues) or miles rather than meters. That is the way in which we 'make' electrons and Augusts and stars. We cannot be satisfied with this interpretation, however, for the principle of charity forbids foisting on the relativist a thesis either trivial or preposterous. If the conceptual relativist is saying that one cannot assert the existence of electrons or equestrian statues without using a predicate coextensive with 'jc is an electron' or 'jc is an equestrian statue', he is making too much of a banal tautology. If, however, he is suggesting that there would have been no such predicates had we decided to classify the world differently, his suggestion is in error. If we had decided to classify the world into man-statues and horse-statues, a predicate co-extensive with 'jc is an equestrian statue' would have been definable from this primitive basis, namely 'jc is the mereological sum of some horse-statue and some man-statue'. The coextensiveness of this predicate with 'jc is an equestrian statue' is itself dependent on neither conceptual scheme, and undercuts even the uselessly weak claim that "you can't say there are equestrian statues without the predicate 'jc is an equestrian statue'." No doubt the conceptual relativist will reply that the equestrian scheme and the man-statue/horse-statue scheme do differ, in their on tologies. The first counts a statue of General Sherman as one thing, while the second counts it as two things. To the obvious reply to this, that the metric system counts the Moon as 438,000 basic units of length away while the English system counts the Moon as 238,000 units away without there being any substantive disagreement between the two, the conceptual relativist must respond by rejecting the distinction between convention and fact.19 This denial is unlikely to impress anyone outside</page><page sequence="19">REALISMS 133 certain philosophical schools, but the upshot for the conceptual rela tivist is an extremely strong form of antirealism about electrons. For it now appears that he must say that electrons would not have existed (and that the Moon would not have been any definite distance from the Earth) unless the predicate 'jc is an electron' and been coined (and some mensural system adopted). At any rate, this is what Schwartz seems to be saying in a footnote. Clarity is again hindered by his penchant for repeating that Scrabble would not have existed had it not been for human agency, whereas the real issue is whether there could have been things, in a mind-free world, that would have been Scrabble tiles had Scrabble been invented. A Scrabble joker is a blank chip of wood of dimensions D used a certain way. It may be granted that there could not have been naturally occurring Scrabble jokers. But, if man had never existed, could there have been chips of wood the size of 'our' Scrabble joker? Schwartz says no: In devising the game of Scrabble, we create the very possibility of there being such things as Scrabble jokers. This may seem trivially true to anyone who maintains, as I do not, that in order to be a Scrabble joker, an object must have been used or intended for use in the actual play of a game. I believe, however, that my remarks could be recast citing properties that clearly lack this requirement, properties such as "has all it takes to be a Scrabble joker, save for intended game use" or "physically resembles Scrabble jokers in shape and markings".21 Since an object physically resembles a Scrabble joker iff it is a blank wood chip 3/4" by 3/4" by 1/8", Schwartz is saying that there could not have been blank wood chips 3/4" by 3/4" by 1/8" if human beings never existed. I mentioned earlier the (somewhat desperate) expedient open to the conceptual relativist of comparing electrons and wood chips to eyeglasses: created by us but real for all that. One trouble, as also previously noted, is that we think of wood chips and electrons as differing from eyeglasses in just this way: they are naturally occurring, so that there are no electrons or word chips if nothing is capable of natural occurrence. But the situation is yet more obscure. Scrabble is not such that, now that we have invented it, it existed before we invented it and would have existed even had we not invented it. Yet we are told that, having invented the predicate 'jc is an electron', our ability to use it to describe counterfactual situations means that even though electrons would not have existed without our help, they would have existed even had we not evolved to help them exist. Electrons, if</page><page sequence="20">134 MICHAEL LEVIN they exist at all, are not like electrons are ordinarily thought to be and are not like Scrabble is ordinarily thought to be. If the resulting theory cannot be said to repudiate electrons explicitly, this is because the theory is so obscure that its implications cannot easily be determined. Conceptual relativism appears to be sustained by the idea that "ideas cannot be compared to unconceptualized reality, only to other ideas". This thesis is not (the denial of) realism, but the denial that anything can be known, or, more properly, scepticism. As such it is not my concern to criticize. I cannot resist remarking, however, that we seem to compare ideas to reality all the time. Yesterday when sitting in my office it occurred to me that my sons' bicycles were blocking the hall at home. My mental picture of the bicycle-encumbered hallway was presumably an idea, and when later that day I looked to see if the bicycles were there I was presumably comparing this idea to something other than an idea. One might argue that I was comparing my idea to a visual image, but so to argue is to commit oneself to phenomenalism. In any case, a visual impression is also quite different from a mnemonic picture, so if I can compare a mnemonic picture to a visual impression I ought to be able to compare a mnemonic picture to a hallway. I am honestly puzzled by what conceptual relativists are trying to get at by their idea about comparison, and I hope one of them responds to this paper with an explanation of what I was doing in my hallway yesterday. 7. One loose end needs tying. If antirealism in the philosophy of science denies the theoretical claims of science proper, do the many forms of antirealism in moral philosophy all deny moral claims? I believe they do. Explanations of moral realism in terms of moral facts or moral properties or the assertoric use of language are unworkable, in my view, from which it follows that moral antirealism cannot be the denial of moral facts or moral properties or the insistence that moral language is not used assertorically. All that remains for the moral antirealist to deny is that anything is good or bad or indifferent. Bertrand Russell expressed what I take to be the current orthodoxy: According to me, the person who judges that A is good is wishing others to feel certain desires .... But what are 'good' desires? Are they anything more than desires you share? Certainly there seems to be something more. ... In opposing [bullfighting] I should feel, not only that I was expressing my desires, but that my desires in the matter are right,</page><page sequence="21">REALISMS 135 whatever that may mean. As a matter of argument, I can, I think, show that I am not guilty of any logical inconsistency in holding to the above interpretation of ethics and at the same time expressing strong ethical preferences.22 But Russell had the intellectual honesty to add a celebrated caveat in the next two sentences: "But in feeling I am not satisfied, I can only say that, while my own opinions as to ethics do not satisfy me, other people's opinions satisfy me less". My own view is that Russell was right to feel unsatisfied, although the inconsistency he sensed may not be 'logical' in the strictest sense. Obviously, showing this would require much argument that cannot be undertaken here.23 I hope, however, that my arguments to the effect that antirealism 'cannot be confined to the metalanguage' in philosophy of science has prepared the reader for this conclusion. 8. It is useful to know that there are only realisms to discuss. This infor mation may prevent empty disputes. One hopes, however, for a more positive, systematic lesson in the collapse of realism. There is one, when it is recalled that realism, completely well-formed when relativized to particular kinds of things, stopped making sense precisely when formulated in full generality. Its fate thus confirms the idea of Kant and Wittgenstein that philosophical illusion is the product of over generalization. Precisely this pattern is repeated in a number of philosophical contro versies, many of them related to realism. The issue of universals, for instance, is not raised by particular questions about the application of particular predicates. Someone who wants to know what makes Fred a 'nephew' is not helped by being told that this consists in Fred's possessing nephewhood or Fred's resemblance to paradigm nephews; our questioner needs to be told that Fred is a nephew because he is the male offspring of a sibling. It is only with respect to the completely general question "What makes a predicate - any predicate - applicable to a subject?" that an answer as general as 'The presence of a universal' is felt to be needed. Some hear the general question as a call to ascend the Platonic heavens; I take it as a warning to keep to the linguistic lowlands. Or, take truth. The classical theories of correspondence, coherence, and utility get no purchase with questions about the truth of particular</page><page sequence="22">136 MICHAEL LEVIN sentences. 'Mary is a grandmother' is true, if it is, not because of a fact to which it corresponds, or its coherence with some larger set of sen tences, or the utility of believing it, but because of the offspring of one of Mary's offspring. Tarski's theory handles questions of intermediate generality, explaining for instance the truth of all conjunctions as the truth of both conjuncts. Common sense plus Tarski seem inadequate only to the demand for a completely general, nonrecursive account of what absolutely all truths have in common. I would also mention, more as an aside than as a further confirming instance, the relation of simplicity to credibility. There appear to be those who think that simplicity is definable in terms of confirmation - a 'complex' hypothesis is simply one that posits too many coincidences and is therefore implausible - and those who find simplicity a sui generis desideratum of theories. That violations of the canon of simplicity are so easy to detect in specific cases (the Ptolemaic epicycles, conspiracy theories of assassinations, learning-theoretical explanations of mating behavior) while general discussions are so inconclusive suggests that here too the 'philosophical' question is being posed at a meaninglessly general level. So now we have somewhat deeper reasons for thinking that the general question of realism is ill-posed, and that only particular realisms are worth discussing. NOTES 1 The univocality of 'exists' plus the provability of (3x)(x = P((o)) in standard systems of set theory does not immediately precipitate mathematical Platonism. Mathematical Platonism remains in suspense if a system like ZF is taken as a theory-form which makes definite existence assertions only when the domain of quantification and the extension of "E" are independently specified. (An embarrassment for the formalist is that talk of domains of quantification reintroduces sets.) So my overall position is neutral on this particular argument for mathematical Platonism, and mathematical Platonism generally. 2 See Saul Kripke: 1982, Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Mass, p. 140. Kripke appears to regard the pain of another as incon ceivable to me; at any rate, he maintains that my believing you are in pain when you hurt yourself consists in my coming to your aid because I imagine my own pain under like circumstances. The contrary view (developed in my 1975 'Kripke's Argument Against the Identity Thesis', Journal of Philosophy 72, 149-67, and elsewhere) holds the refer ence of 'pain' to be fixed by public accidental designators like 'what happens when you chip a tooth.' Consequently, nothing in the concept of pain confines its primary appli cation to the subject using the concept. People learn to predicate 'pain', not 'my pain'.</page><page sequence="23">REALISMS 137 What I remember when I remember chipping a tooth is what it is like to chip a tooth, not what it is like for me to chip a tooth, so nothing prevents my imagining what it is like for you to chip a tooth. It's just like what happens to me. Perhaps solipsism is intractable because interpersonal experiences are so. similar; since what you have when your tooth aches is more or less what I have, I am puzzled upon discovering that my attempts to imagine your toothache keep producing what appears to be my own. 3 Hilary Putnam: 1982, Reason, Truth and History, Cambridge University Press, Cam bridge, p. 54. 4 At B69. 5 Roy Sorensen: 1988, Blindspots, Oxford University Press, Oxford, England, pp. 216 52; also see my review of Blindspots, NOUS, forthcoming.

Essay 5. Van Fraassen has informed me in correspondence that while he can tell me whether he believes in electrons, this information would be of only 'biographical value' and hence not worth communicating. Other antirealist attempts to replace belief in theoretical entities with a surrogate also in fact assume them. Thus Laudan thinks that science is best conceived not in terms of 'truth' but of 'success' in solving problems. However, the theory of evolution can hardly have succeeded in solving the problem of speciation if natural selection never occurred, nor can positing rapidly rotating neutron stars clear up the mystery of pulsars if there are no rotating neutron stars. 12 See my 1984 'What Kind of Explanation is Truth'? in J. Leplin, ed., Scientific Realism, University of California Press, Berkeley. 13 Reason, Truth and History, 134-35; also see 60-74. 14 Robert Schwartz: 1986, 'I'm Going to Make You a Star', Midwest Studies in Philosophy XI, 427-38. 15 Schwartz, 432. 16 Schwartz, 433. 17 Schwartz, 436-38. 18 Schwartz, 436. 19 "The appropriate place to draw the line between truths of convention and truths of fact is anyone's guess and might itself best be seen as a matter of convention. . . . The hope of finding a fixed solid demarcation between the conventional and the non conventional would seem no more likely to be fulfilled than the hope of finding a significant boundary between the analytic and synthetic, artificial and natural kinds, and kindred notions" (Schwartz, 434). This incomprehension may be appropriate to natural language, but sceptics have yet to move beyond a few staple examples (such as the shift from classical to relativistic concepts of mass and momentum) to more challenging cases. Could we discover, for instance, that there aren't 12 inches in one foot, or that the (x, y) position in the Cartesian plane is not (r sin 6 cos $, r sin 6 sin &lt;/&gt;) in spherical co-ordinates? Even Quine's animadversions in 'Two Dogmas' appear to leave some grudging room for</page><page sequence="24">138 MICHAEL LEVIN explicit stipulations. In some cases, the line between fact and convention can be defined quite precisely in terms of invariance. An equation between tensors holds in all general curvilinear co-ordinates for example; any one system of curvilinear co-ordinates is a convention, therefore, while what the tensor equation says is not. 20 The choice of unit within a mensural system is an explicit stipulation of the sort mentioned in note 19. 21 Op. cit,, p. 438, note 4. Schwartz lends his view what plausibility it has by using the most colloquial language to describe conceptual distinctions. Of course it sounds silly to ask what the dinosaurs were doing 150 million Labor Day weekends ago, or to express the size of Jupiter in terms of the diameter of the average pizza. However, it does not sound silly to talk of what dinosaurs were doing precisely n vibrations of a given cesium atom ago, nor does it then sound particularly plausible to deny that this period existed until we invented it. 22 Bertrand Russell: 1963, 'Reply to Justus Buchler', in P.
