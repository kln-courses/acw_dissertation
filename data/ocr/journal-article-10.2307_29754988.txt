<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Bronze Handles of Charsada The three bronze handles here published (*) were discovered by chance in 1958 in the neighbourhood of Charsada (former N.W.F.P., W. Pakistan; by a peasant and are now kept in the National Museum of Pakistan (2). The data about this find are very vague; yet it does seem clear that the handles in question were discovered together with fragments of a copper sarcophagus to which they must have been attached. It also seems probable that there were originally four of them, one being lost as will become more apparent later on. All three handles (that will, for clarity, be distinguished by the letters A, B, and C) (figs. 1-10) are composed of a draped female bust from the sides of which two dolphins stand out and form the real grip of the handle. The female bust is perfectly smooth and flat behind and grows increasingly thicker from bottom to top, the head, hollow behind, being almost completely in the round. As a consequence when the bust and the handle overly? ing it were attached to the sarcophagus they must have protruded a little which meant that they could be grasped more easily. Bust and dolphins were cast in one single form and not soldered together subsequently (3) The female bust is cut below the breasts along a line that is markedly curved. The (*) I should like to thank Dr F. A. Khan, the Director of the Department of Archaeology in Pa? kistan, who has allowed the Italian Archaeological Mission to publish the handles, and Prof. G. Tucci for giving me the opportunity to study this im? portant find. My thanks are also due to Dr Mau rizio Taddei and Dr Domenico Faccenna whose advice and information proved of valuable help. A photograph of one of the handles (N. M. 1961-1704/3; here, fig. 5) appeared in the En? cyclopedia delVArte Antica, vol. VI, p. 1020, fig. 1125 (where it is erroneously said to be lodged in the Peshawar Museum). (~) Inv. Nos. N. M. 1961-1704/1, 21,5 cms; N. M. 1961-1704/2, 22,3 cms; N. M. 1961-1704/3, 22,2 cms. (3) The data resulting from the examination of the handles obligingly carried out by the Istituto Sperimentale dei Metalli Leggeri are quoted from the Institute's Report (no. 11.394/6206.039) signed by Dr Leoni: ? The handles of group b all reveal an anologous spectrographic composition, and it may therefore be assumed that they were obtained in a single casting of the metal. From the quantitative examination of sample 3 b we find that they were cast in bronze containing a percentage of tin that is not high where foundry bronze is concerned. A limited percentage of lead, too, is also present. The presence of a high percentage of iron (1.45%) leads us to suppose that the alloy was adulterated through remaining a long time, while in a fused state, in contact with tools made of this metal, or perhaps because of the chance presence of iron containing minerals during the reduction of the cupriferous minerals ?. And further on (conclu? sions): ?The objects examined were subdivided into three groups: ... b) handles of a sarcophagus from Charsada... The handles of group b were also found to be of bronze with tin largely impure because of iron and with a small percentage of lead. (While) the compositions of the alloys in groups a and b present analogies to the chemical compositions of bronze objects of antiquity, Ro? man and Etruscan, for example... ?. ? Qualitative spectrographic examination of the 94</page><page sequence="2">drapery consists of large flat folds from one of which a hand emerges: it is represented in an extremely simplified manner, is of a very reduced size, and is holding an ear of corn in a horizontal position. Neck and head are also of a large and simplified form; the chin is broad, massive and round; the mouth half-open. The shape of the eyes is particularly striking: they are very elongated and almond-shaped; the lids stand out sharply as also the eyeball from the cavity framing it, and the pupil is marked by a hole. The eyebrows, meet? ing above the nose, are bordered by two parallel furrows above and below and, in one instance, further marked by a series of small vertical incisions (fig. 9). The way the hair is indicated is also characteristic: two bands extend back from the centre of the forehead towards the occiput; in one instance (C), on either side of these three more are placed and effected by means of a series of parallel incisions that are alternatively vertical and hori? zontal. The hair-style is not quite identical in the three specimens: in this sense the most characteristic and best preserved is that of C (fig. 7). The dolphins are affixed to the bust by their tails on a level with the shoulders: the tails open fan wise, are split in two and divided again by carved parallel lines into several oblong segments crossed in their turn by a dense series of small carved lines. After a tight spiral forming a knot at the sides of either shoulder, the dolphins describe a sinuous curve and then meet again head to head at the sides of a spheroidal feature they hold in their mouths. Their bodies are smooth, but all the features in relief, the fins above all, are rendered like the tails with lines thickly incised arranged fish-bone fashion or in a parallel series. The eyes in their execution are almost identical to those of the female heads. So much for the practically identical features in the three specimens. A number of differences are also evident. The most obvious one is that two of the heads are turned to the proper right (B and C) and the third to the proper left (as the lost one must also have been): the symmetrical arrangement of the handles ? two on either side ? accounts for this. The most likely position (as we shall see later) is that with heads turned towards the centre. Handles B and C must, then, have been placed to the right of the on? looker, and A to the left. Apart from variations in individual facial details, hair-style, and decoration (many of which were executed when the metal was cold after fusion) there are some differences even in the dimensions of the specimens themselves. k k k It thus becomes clear that a mould was made for each of the handles and not just two ? one for each identical pair ? as would seem more obvious (this is confirmed by the spectrographic composition of the handles, which allows us to assume that they were obtained in a single casting). samples -3 b: Elements present in major quanti? ties: Cu Sn Fe Pb; Elements present in traces: Ni Ag Zn; Elements present in minor quantities: As ?. ?

Specimens have been discovered at Pompeii, in Rome and Gaul, etc. Unfortunately, the marked de? ficiency in the publication of Roman instrumentum ? one of the least studied and least known aspects of classical archaeology ? makes research in this field extremely difficult. The most numerous group of specimens known to the present writer is the one coming from Gaul and the camps and castella of the Rhine-Danube limes. In most cases the handles, like the Ch?rsada ones, are composed of dolphin-heads set at the sides of a spheroidal feature, and more rarely of interwoven tails of the same animal. The first type is more relevant to our present survey and the following specimens may be quoted (they are nearly all movable handles that were inserted in two rings): a fair-sized group (7 specimens) in the Saint-Ger main-en-Laye Museum exhibited in case 24, Room V (4), a specimen in the Bavai Mu? seum (5), another in the Speyer Museum (6), a fair-sized group in the Trier Museum (7); and others discovered in Hungary (8) and in the castella of the Rhine and Danube limes (9). As to the second type, which seems older, there are two unpublished specimens in the National Museum of Naples (Room XCIII). This form, with the dolphins' tails inter? twined, was also used as a lamp-handle (10). Further specimens, as yet unpublished and be? longing to the Rome Communal collections, deserve to be specially mentioned (1X) (figs. 16-19). They exemplify a striking variant of the first type. The most complete specimen (fig. 24) is made up, as usual, of two dolphins facing each other on either side of a vaguely spherical feature: but their tails are this time replaced by a duck's head inserted into a ring which is furnished low down with a flat, leaf-like feature (this was clearly fixed to the object to be lifted). What we have here is obviously a blending of the dolphin-type handle and the more common one in the shape of a duck's head which was in widespread use from the Hellenistic age onwards. The complete indifference towards the organic coherence of the naturalistic elements ? these are split up and reconnected at will ? is a phenomenon that to some extent parallels that evident in the Ch?rsada handles. It is noteworthy how in the handle of fig. 19 the heads of the ducks and chiefly the bodies of the dolphins become (4) S.

A 3rd-4th century dating seems a likely one for these specimens. The association of the dolphins with a male or female bust is a rarer phenomenon. The best known specimens are those discovered at Carnuntum, at Wels, in the Roman castellum of Zugmantel north of Mainz (fig. 11), an identical one in the Speyer Museum, another in the Trier Museum, and the one found at Intercisa. To these must be added the buckle unearthed at Hontheim on the Moselle and now in the Rheinisches Lan? desmuseum, Bonn (fig. 13) (12). In all these instances a striking affinity, typological and stylistic alike, may be noted with the Ch?rsada handles: the association of a bust (usually of a divinity ? representations of Athena predominate) with two dolphins is in itself too rare and particular a phenomenon for us to postulate a pure coincidence. Moreover the composite and ? provincial ? appearance of these specimens and the way the dolphins are rigidly adapted to their function, violating an organic connexion of parts (especially no? table in the Zugmantel specimen) closely approaches what we have noted in the Ch?rsada handles where the dolphins describe a spiral that is absurd from a naturalistic point of view and due perhaps to confusion with the manner of representing the tails of tritons as they appear in many monuments with a marine subject (in mosaics above all). The most striking differences are due to the different purpose to which the objects were put: the Ch?rsada handles were fixed and must have been welded to the body of the sarcophagus, while the others we have cited as comparisons were movable: hence, the tails of the dol? phins hooked into the two rings and could freely rotate. Consequently, the human bust was necessarily placed between the heads of the two animals: on the contrary, in the simpler type of handle there was a spherical feature. Of particular interest is the Zugmantel spe? cimen affording a fairly accurate chronological datum; for it was discovered in a castellum that can be assigned a date between the age of Domitian (more precisely about 83-85 A.D.) and the middle of the 3rd century. Indeed, as A. B?ttner affirms (13) we have here an object associated with the final phase of the castellum. Menzel and Radn?ti, too, assign this type of handle to the 3rd century (14). Furthermore, the frequent use of dolphin hand? les in this period is attested by many other specimens of this type in the same castellum and in other archaeological contexts that can be assigned to the same phase (15). Hybrid forms of this sort are to be found, moreover, in other types of handles that are likely to have been produced in Belgian Gaul: they are composed of a bust of Cybele flanked by two lions and two busts of Attis (fig. 12) (16).

In fact, even if these pieces are Gallic in make, the very subject and style suggest the influence of Oriental features. Cumont, in an article de? voted to them (17), rightly holds that the type must derive from a Syrian prototype, and in the light of accumulating evidence of the very close ties between the eastern and western parts of the Empire, especially from the 2nd cent. A.D., there is nothing surprising in this (18). Indeed, as we shall see shortly, some of the most striking analogies of the Ch?rsada handles are those provided by some Gallic bronzes of the late imperial age. The emergence of the handle with a human bust and dolphins may, perhaps, have arisen through the progressive blending and integration of elements of composition that were ori? ginally separate though coexisting within one context. We are thinking particularly of some capitals (one of which, in the Museo Nazionale Romano in Rome, is reproduced here, at fig. 24), and of some bronze arulae and figured terracottas, that can be referred to the 1st century of the Empire and where a bust, either male or female, is represented flanked above by two dol? phins (19). The type is, moreover, quite certainly connected with funerary symbolism: the head of Medusa flanked by dolphins often appears on Roman stelae and on lead sarcophagi of Syrian-Palestinian make dating back to between the 2nd and 4th century A.D. (2i). As a hypothesis one might postulate a derivation from the Oceanus type, the dolphins appearing in the locks of the god being progressively accentuated. This is in fact suggested by a handle from Egypt consisting of a ring fastened to a bust of Oceanus (21). But as we shall see further on, the solution of our own particular problem is closely bound up with the identification of the female figure forming part of the handles. The two attributes, dol? phins and ear of corn, even if in their own separate ways, seem to be directly linked with the cult of Atargatis (cf. note 35 infra). Let us now study one by one the features of which these handles are composed. In our view, three of them above all are able to afford some interesting data: the type of p. 219 ft; S. Reinach, ?

XVIIL 98</page><page sequence="6">hair-style, the dolphins, and the object ? most likely an ear of corn ? that the female figure is holding in her right hand. As regards the first, we can confidently assert that it consists of a markedly schematic representation of a type of hair-style broadly defined as Hellenistic and that, therefore, it does not seem, of itself, able to supply any useful data. What interests us is the degree to which it is schematic rather than the type of hair-style. In this sense, what seem to us to approach our specimens closely are the hair-styles of female heads painted on the ceiling of the Synagogue of Dura Europos which the dedicatory inscription proves can be dated to the years immediately after 244-245 A.D. (22). Likewise, there is the head of Egyptian origin that Wessel has assigned to the 3rd cent. A.D. (23). In this last instance, the arran? gement of the locks of hair in counterpoised symmetrical bands both vertical and horizontal, is practically identical. A number of female heads in bronze of Gallic make have a hair-style of the same kind. The nearest one to the Ch?rsada specimens is perhaps that preserved in the Museum of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (fig. 14). This can be assigned in all likelihood to the 3rd century A.D. (24) and it has other features analogous to those of the handle-busts ? the elongated form of the eyes, the eyebrows marked by tiny vertical notches, the form of the face itself, and the very typical taste for a small incised segment decoration that appears at the base of the bust and led Reinach to suggest a Syrian influence (25). A very similar appearance can be perceived, too, in a bust portrayed in a mosaic coming from Fossombrone (now in the Ancona National Museum); it dates from the 3rd or 4th century A.D. and the parallel strips indicating the hairs are executed in white on black (fig. 26) (26). Before going on to study the type of dolphin forming the handle, let us note first of all that in all likelihood they assume a symbolic value linked to the funerary use of the handles (for, as we pointed out, they were affixed to a sarcophagus). As it has been re? peatedly remarked, the dolphin symbolized the waters of the under-world (27). Their con? nexion with funerary cults is clear enough, and pairs of dolphins very often appear on se? pulchral stelae and lead sarcophagi; and small dolphins also form part of grave furnit (22) Comte du Mesnil du Buisson, Les pein tures de la Synagogue de Doura Europos, Rome, 1938, pl.

Abundant particulars are forthcoming from ancient sources about the connexion of the dolphin with the cult of dead persons (29). Apart from symbolising the celestial Ocean, they were the animals responsible for transporting the deceased to the Isles of the Blest. In this case, too, then, there seems to be no doubt about their funerary significance. Something more can be said about their figural character. It has already been re? marked that the body of the animal forms a spiral just above the tail and that this is an incongruous detail from a naturalistic point of view. Such indifference towards reality and organic form is conceivable only in a ? provincial ? environment (a marginal one with res? pect to the Graeco-Roman world where the motif originated) and in a relatively late period. In those monuments where the dolphin motif recurs most, that is the mosaics, this par? ticular phenomenon is evident only in late examples: at Ostia not before the second half of the 3rd century; in Africa in the 3rd-4th cent.; at Antioch, an environment close to the one where our handles were executed, only in a specimen dating from the second half of the 4th cent. (30). The motif seems to be widespread in Coptic sculpture and Byzan? tine toreutics (31). To interpret the female busts it is imperative to identify the object held in the right hand. It would seem to be an ear of corn rather than a branch (that we perceive, for exam? ple, in a Coptic sculpture very similar in many respects to our handles (32), or a garland (of the type appearing in many Egyptian anthropomorphic sarcophagi of the Hellenistic and Roman periods (33). The object is most evident in handle C (fig. 7). If our interpreta? tion is right, a representation of Demeter (or rather an Oriental deity connected with the agrarian and fertility cults) becomes plausible and the matronly type of female figure por? trayed corresponds to this idea (34). We were directed towards one solution by some sculptures found in the temple of Atargatis discovered at Khirbet et-Tannur in Transjordania (35). Two practically identical (28) Cf. for example, C.

Our handles show a mingling of two features that are kept separate in the Khirbet et-Tannur reliefs. This blending, in fact, was recognised by Cumont (38) who pointed out that in the transformation of Atargatis into a great nature goddess (39) both basic features ? the humid principle symbolising the life of the universe (40) and that of agricultural fer? tility (41) ? merge at a certain point. The Khirbet et-Tannur reliefs are assigned various dates between the beginning of the 2nd and the beginning of the 3rd century A.D. (42). We have no doubt, then, that the busts of the Ch?rsada handles represent the Dea Syria; and other comparisons can be invoked. One of these is a relief from Palatine showing ears of corn being held in the hand (the ears of corn are a typical attribute of the Heliopolitan triad; inscription CIL VII 759, in fact, calls Atargatis Spiciferal), and another a head of Atargatis found at Petra that, stylistically, resembles our handles closely in the treatment of the lower half of the face which is massive and rotund, and of the eyes, that are elon? gated and deeply carved (43). An examination of these handles, even an exhaustive one, leaves one perplexed. The first impression is that we are dealing with an artisan product of the provincial Roman world probably towards its eastern boundaries. Theoretically speaking, however, we cannot dismiss the hypothesis that such products were not imported but locally made under the influence of classical artistic culture. If such a hypothesis be true the chronology would clearly have to be shifted; for the evident ? anti-classical ? appearance of such products would not then be related to a rather late chronology but simply to the outlying nature of the place of production vis-?-vis the classical world. In this case dating would be markedly earlier than has seemed possible hitherto. We shall, first of all, examine such a hypothesis. Whether there was artistic output of classical derivation in the Gandharan area in Hel? lenistic times and whether a relation existed between this ? Indo-Greek ? art and ? Graeco Buddhist ? art of later date, has been a vexata quaestio for several decades. And its solu (36) Lucian., De Syria Dea, 14; cf. C.

I have no intention of tackling problems I am not com? petent to deal with, yet it is indispensable to try to clarify a specific and limited aspect of the matter which is closely bound up with what we have been saying. Among the many theories put forward to account for the plaster emblemata found at Begram (45) there is one that seems of particular interest to us. In his Introduction to the catalogue of the Turin exhibition of masterpieces belonging to the Kabul Museum (46), G. Gul lini rightly rejects Picard's theory that some of these at least were oscilla (47) and argues the view that these plaster objects had a functional and not decorative raison d'etre (p. 33). Thus far, Gullini's reasoning seems to us impeccable. We cannot follow him, however, when he pushes the argument further and affirms: ? artisans needed them to realize a new metallic product that cannot surely be pictured devoid of the necessary finishing in all its details... Having thus explained their use, we can adduce them as striking proof of the existence of workshops where, in the heart of Bactria in the capital of the Kushan Em? pire, models of Hellenistic origin were worked upon ?. It is not possible to exclude, a priori, the existence of such workshops; nor can it be accepted so confidently till surer proof is at hand, and this, at least for the present, is completely lacking. All things considered if as seems very likely the plaster emblemata are models used as sketch-books, their use must rather be sought, we think, in the activity of Gandharan stucco workers: the deriva? tion of stucco style and technique itself from the western world, and Egypt especially, has more than once been stressed where Gandh?ra is concerned (48). For example, the re? semblance even in the form between some Hadd? stuccoes and the Begram plaster casts is such as gives food for thought, as Wheeler perceived (49). This, moreover, would explain the persistence in the Gandharan stuccoes of such sharply Hellenistic features right in the middle of the Roman or late Roman epoch. It is highly probable that this is in part due to artisans being directly inspired by casts of silver objects and other artisan products even of very ancient date. The Begram emblemata are an example of this: their appearance is far from appearing homogeneous; they seem to be modelled on specimens that can be as? signed to a period running from the 3rd to the 1st century B.C.

To say that the plaster was worn by time does not explain this phenomenon because the surface always shows up very fresh; evidently this was the condition of the original of which a cast was taken; it might have been a vase already used and thus with a worn metal surface (the most likely hypothesis) or a mould that had not yet received the finishing touches ?). These considerations, which we fully accept, mean that any stylistic observations about these plaster casts are deprived of all chronological value. Our view, that has been expounded elsewhere (50), is that the objects from the Begram store-room are in great part much later than the 1st cent. A.D. (they are, at anyrate, likely to belong to the second half of the 2nd and the beginning of the 3rd cent.). Gullini's interpretation is on these lines when in his own study (p. 27) he refers to the Ch?rsada handles that had been discovered only a short while before. He is consistent in declaring: ? To this Greek-Bactrian production may be related, I think, the bronze hand? les of a sarcophagus recently discovered at Ch?rsada that are decorated with a female bust and afTord striking analogies with the silver relief from Tobolsk, in the Hermitage, which shows a frontal bust of Artemis that Mrs Trever has dated to the 2nd cent. B.C. ?. He goes on: ? even to the south of the Hindukush we would thus have a proof of the acti? vity of these Greek-Bactrian workshops that Afghanistan excavations have not yet recorded for us but which we have no reason for excluding ?. And no reason for affirming, either. At this point we think it as well to list those arguments that in our view are opposed to the hypothesis of an ? early ? dating and the local production of the handles. (These two questions, indeed, are at least in part independent and are to be treated separately: it is always possible that these are objects of local make but of a later age than the one put forward by Gullini). At first glance one appears to perceive a certain resemblance between the busts of the handles and the busts of divinities appearing on the Tobolsk emblema (fig. 21) (51) and on the one of unknown provenance (fig. 20) both of which are housed in the Hermitage. But in the first instance a more accurate examination makes it clear that this affinity is quite general in character. In particular, the stylisation of the hair takes on the appearance of a superficial arabesque with a tendency to a curved and sinuous line very different from the manner manifest in the handles where deeply incised and angular lines prevail. Where the second emblema is concerned there is overall, perhaps, a more marked affinity both in the composition and in numerous details such as the way the bust is modelled, the arrangement and folds of the drapery, the type of hair with locks falling on the chest and its linear, sehe (50) F. Coarelli, ? Su alciini vetri dipinti... ?, cit.; Idem, ? I vetri dipinti di Begram e Flliade Ambrosiana?, in Studi Miscellanei... dell'Univer sit? di Koma, I, Roma, 1961, p. 29 ff.

Another very striking detail, too, is the presence of the small, stunted hand holding a pomegranate which is not unlike those of the handles bearing the ear of corn; then again, there is the schematized appearance of the feathers of the wings with lines ar? ranged fishbone fashion like those we noticed on the fins of the dolphins. Nevertheless, the differences, especially of style, are also considerable. In the emblema of fig. 20 we are aware of a formal coherence, an organic subordination of particulars to the whole which is still fully consistent with the Hellenistic tradition (and Mrs. Trever, in fact, assigns it to the 2nd century B.C. even though this dating, taken as a whole, gives rise to a good many queries). In the handles, on the other hand, the conception is very different: details of the eyes and hair are much more accentuated and sunken, and the ge? neral appearance is vaguely ? expressionist ?. Nor can this be attributed to the evident artisan quality of these products; it involves a different stylistic conception and in our view entails a chronology which is a good deal later. But what brings us principally to favour this hypothesis is the fusion between the human bust and the dolphins. As we have stressed before, this feature runs counter to an organic concept by yoking together hetero? geneous elements and would be unthinkable in a Hellenistic age. It might be objected that this principle is not valid in an area so peripheral if compared to the classical world; but the fact that it is substantially observed in Greek-Bactrian silver work allied to the conside? ration that a wholly similar type of handle appeared in a provincial environment in the West probably around the end of the 2nd or the beginning of the 3rd century A.D. seems to us a factor strongly corroborating what we have said earlier. The typology as well as the stylistic aspect of these products does not, moreover, differ substantially from that of our handles. And in some instances, the affinity is really pronounced, as we have seen. Com? pare again the handle found at Wels and preserved in the Weiser Museum and those of Carnantum and Zugmantel (fig. 11) with the Ch?rsada specimens: an undeniable resem? blance is apparent due to the concomitant solution of stylistic difficulties which is too precise to be fortuitous. This correspondence will seem all the more evident when comparisons are extended to include classes of kindred products: for example, the bronze handles or appliques representing Cybele already referred to (fig. 12), and some bronze ends of chariot-poles (52). A notable term of comparison is also afforded by a plentiful supply of small bronzes of Gallic make. We have already mentioned the votive female bust kept in the Museum of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (fig. 14); and we might add that of Avenches (53). And so we could go on. How can all this be explained?

An interesting correspondence between these objects and a bronze found in China has been noted by P. Jacob sthal (?

This is not the moment for dealing with so complex a question even in its salient features. It is enough to remark that the presence of Syrian and Alexandrian ateliers in the Rhineland is attested by ancient sources. Moreover, there was a flourishing traffic especially in lesser artisan products (bronzes, glass objects, etc.) that must have been sustained by the activity of real trading companies (54). It is in this way that we can account for the presence in Britain and in general in the far North-West of Europe, of silver ware very similar to that of Oriental production (55). It was perhaps made in Gaul; but some pieces must have been imported directly from the Roman East (this is certain, for instance, in the case of the cups signed by Cheirisophos and found at Hoby in Denmark) (56). As regards objects of this sort, we are once again struck by the amazing iconographic correspondence between the subject of one of these cups (the so-called Helfergruppe) and number of Gandh?ra reliefs. The transmission of these icono? graphies must assuredly have been by way of plastic models that might have been casts in the real sense of the word (the Begram emblem at a come to mind again) or simply relief pottery like the Arretine ware found at Arikamedu in South India (57). In this respect there is no difficulty in understanding the widespread diffusion of Oriental cults in the western provinces (58). We may at this point recall that in one of the series of objects stylistically and typologically closest to the Ch?rsada handles, of sure western make (all the known specimens came to light in Belgian Gaul), Cybele and Attis are regularly depicted (fig. 12). We have already noted that after study of them, Cumont traced their prototype back to models existing in the Roman Near East. When there is a strong affinity both typological and stylistic between products of such diverse provenance, the problem is an embarrassing one: the only logical solution is to pos? tulate an origin in one of the eastern provinces of the Roman Empire for the type of handle formed of a human bust and dolphins. We do not think that the oldest specimens can be assigned a date earlier than the middle of the 2nd century A.D. It is a chronological limit already suggested by the stylistic trick of mingling naturalistic elements in such an inorganic fashion and confirmed by the dating of the specimens found in the West that can by and large be assigned to the end of the 2nd or to the 3rd century A.D. Hence we hold that it is very difficult to accept what Gullini affirmed in the brief note we have already quoted. (54) Cf. note 18. (55) Cf. lastly, L. Pirzio Biroli Stefanelli, ?

And all things considered, the most likely date would seem to be between the middle of the 2nd and the middle of the 3rd century A.D. The most convincing stylistic parallels are to be found in the Syrian area. A fairly near example is that of certain panels in the ceiling of the synagogue of Dura Europos: they can be precisely dated to the years immediately after 244-45 A.D. (59). Let us take a detail for purposes of comparison ? that representing Hera from the Kanatha architrave which contains the scene of the Judgment of Paris and is now in the Louvre. Apart from the ex? ternal coincidence of the ear of corn that the goddess is holding, the type of hair-style, the drapery, and the treatment of the eyes all approach those of the handles very closely (60). The most interesting feature of the latter is the execution of the eyes that are elongated and almond-like with a central protruding eye-ball pierced by a small hole to indicate the pupil. We may note the same appearance in a good many funerary sculptures from Pal? myra (61) albeit of a much higher quality. In this connexion, however, a head of Nike in basalt from Sueida, preserved in the Damascus Museum (62), affords the most significant comparison. But the most conspicuous features, stylistically speaking, are to be found in a group of sculptures that mainly represent Tyche, and sometimes Tyche Atargatis (as in another relief from Khirbet et-Tannur found together with the ones already mentioned - cfr. note 35) (fig. 25) (63). Examples that may be quoted are the head of Tyche from Palmyra (64), and above all, the relief discovered at Dura (temple of the Gadde) (fig. 27) (65). The head of the Palmyra Tyche, appearing in this last-named relief, affords in our view the most di? rect and convincing comparison with the female busts of the Ch?rsada handles ? the hair in both cases is effected by deeply incised lines and the treatment of eyes and mouth is the same. And it is very important for us that this relief is dated unequivocally by its inscrip? tion: the year 470 of the Seleucid era/159 A.D. Among the Dura sculptures there is another head of Tyche whose hair-style bears a (59) Cf. note 22. (60) M. Dunand, he Musee de Soue'ida, Paris, 1934, p. 11 ff., pi.

However, owing to the particular attribute of the ears of corn, it cannot be excluded that it is a case, here too, of an Atargatis identified with Hera (cf. Plutarch, Crassus, 17, cit. in note 39). R. Dussaud, ? Tem? ples et cultes de la triade Heliopolitaine ? Ba ealbeck?, Syria, XXIII, 1942-43, p. 65, believes that the subject represented is rather the marriage of Dusares and that Hera should be probably iden? tified as Ge. (61) K.

The same manner of working the locks of hair in depth is to be seen in a small bronze that was found at Hatra and represents He? racles (67). Can the Orient furnish us with other evidence showing the import of handicrafts of Syrian-Palestinian origin? We must, I think, exclude the balm-container busts found at Begram that have some features in common with the Ch?rsada handles (their probable contemporaneity may well account for this) but are sharply distinguished from them by other features (fig. 15), and in all likelihood belong to an Alexandrian environment (68). One single object, indeed, seems to us to afford a distant parallel with our handles ? the silver emblema of Taxila (69), above all, because of the shortening of the arm and right hand that holds the kantharos. The identity of this motif with the one often appearing on Palmyra stelae may not be wholly fortuitous (70). Artistic objects were, moreover, very probably im? ported into north-west India from a Syrian environment in Roman times: the reciprocal cul? tural ties linking the art of Gandh?ra with that of Syria and Palmyra especially has, too, more than once been stressed (71). It may be noted, for instance, that some schist sculp? tures like that coming from the excavations at Butkara I, Swat (72) which is reproduced here (fig. 28) have a certain typological and stylistic affinity with the busts of the Ch?rsada handles. As has been made clear, the task of defining the chronology of the Ch?rsada handles and the environment in which they were made is beset with thorny problems of very diffi? cult solution. It must be borne in mind that the handles constitute a unicum as far as I have been able to establish. In such a situation any categorical assertion runs the risk of being belied by fresh finds or by a more exhaustive study of a subject of which this is but an initial survey. However, in our present state of knowledge the most likely hypothesis seems to be this: that we are faced with objects imported from the Syrian area, though we cannot altogether dismiss the idea that they may have been made locally. (This is a matter that will only be convincingly settled when the discovery and publication of new material has furnished adequate terms of comparison that are at present wholly lacking).

CDXLV a. 107</page><page sequence="26">As was seen, establishing the chronology also raises a lot of difficulties. A certain evidence is provided by what we have observed about the birth and spreading in the Roman Em? pire of a type of handle with dolphins and bust that, as was pointed out, goes back at the earliest to the second half of the 2nd century A.D. and is more peculiar to the 3rd. If we put forward a date in this period, this tallies perfectly with the Ch?rsada handles and their style. Moreover, if we accept the hypothesis of importation from the Roman world (albeit an outlying part of it), it also coincides with the most flourishing phase of trade in these goods, at least as far as north-west India is concerned. This phase, as sources and finds attest, is to be dated in the last decades of the 2nd and the first decades of the 3rd cen? tury A.D. (73). Ch?rsada, indeed, was a station on that vital highway that stretched from the ports of north-west India (Barygaza in particular) and extended as far as the Oxus and Bactra where it joined the great caravan-route from Chinese Turkestan (T4). The nearest comparisons also tend to confirm this chronology. In particular, the Dura relief of 159 A.D., showing the Palmyra Tyche, and also the paintings of the Dura Europos Synagogue that may be referred to the years directly after 244-245 A.D., provide the maxi? mum limits within which the handles can be placed. A more precise collocation would be inappropriate, but as a mere hypothesis it is, perhaps, preferable to suggest the second half of the 2nd century A.D. FlLIPPO COARELLI (73) F.
