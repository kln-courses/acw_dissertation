THE EARLY HORIZON SITE OF HUACA DE LOS REYES: SOCIETAL IMPLICATIONS Thomas Pozorski From 1973 to 1974, investigations were carried out at a series of Initial Period and Early Horizon sites known as the Caballo Muerto complex, located in the Moche Valley on the North Coast of Peru. One site, Huaca de los Reyes, contains numerous adobe friezes that are noted both for their wide variety and early date. The amount of labor investment and the degree of architectural planning of the site strongly imply ranked societal divisions of the people responsible for its construction. Differential frieze distribution also supports this contention. The complex of sites known as Caballo Muerto is located about 17 km inland in the Moche Valley on the North Coast of Peru. It is a manifestation of a chiefdom-type society (Service 1975) that flourished during Initial Period and Early Horizon times. The inland location of the complex suggests an economy based on irrigation agriculture. Interest in the complex dates to the first years of this century, but virtually nothing was published until Moseley and Watanabe (1974) reported on clay friezes found at Huaca de los Reyes. My own work at the Caballo Muerto com- plex dates from July 1973 to December 1974 and includes about six months of excavation (Pozor- ski 1976).

Seven of the eight sites are clustered within the southern half of the total area of the complex, while a small eighth mound is located at the extreme north end; this last mound, however, is connected to the rest of the complex by an 11 m wide road. Individual mound size ranges from 120 x 100 x 18 m high to 25 x 24 x 2 m high, though in total site area, Huaca de los Reyes is the largest. Each of the mounds has or probably once had two smaller parallel wing mounds extendiong out from its principal or front face so as to form a large "U". The majority of the mounds face east and upvalley, specifically between E50N and E10?N. Two mounds, however, face southward toward the Moche River; one is oriented S10?E, or at a 90? angle from the usual mound orienta- tion, while the small isolated platform is oriented E35?S. HUACA DE LOS REYES Huaca de los Reyes, the most elaborate site, actually consists of two contiguous mounds facing eastward, each with a pair of parallel wings (Figure 1). Both principal mounds are roughly the same height, but the western one is built on much higher ground with its back against the edge of the latest quebrada cut. This placement was by no means accidental, for it served two purposes: (1) the gradual rise in architecture from east to west is augmented by the natural ground rise, so that the west main mound appears to be the largest construction, but in reality is smaller than the east main mound; (2) the back of the mound is closed to easy access by a steep 6 m drop; entrance was permitted only through the controlled passages on the east. The two main mounds with their respective wing pairs form the two large "Us". The east mound, whose top is level with the natural base upon which the west mound rests, serves as the foundation for the wings of the higher west mound. Each of the "Us" encloses a plaza on three sides (Figure 1), the eastern one (Plaza II) being the larger. In addition, a third and larger plaza (Plaza I), not bordered by wings, is located further eastward. Additional architectural elaboration is in the form of (1) two sets of side mounds, one set flanking the front of each main mound; (2) various walls and small structures just outside the west main mound; and (3) a small architec- turally independent mound with two plazas situated north of the main site. With the possible exception of the second group of features listed above and certain details on the summit of the west main mound, all of the architecture seen in Figure 1 is contemporary, based on existing, definite architectural connections and associations. The main site plan (Figure 1) represents the second major construction phase. Evidences of the earlier first construction phase were encountered in several areas, especially on the summit of the west main mound, but could not be pursued without great destruction of the later architecture. The overall plan of the site immediately suggests both symmetry and great regularity. A closer inspection of general layout and field measurements reveals further patterned relationships. For example, each wing of the east main mound has 12 pillars and 2 niches at each end; each wing of the west main mound has 2 pillars (or 1/6 the number of pillars of the lower wings) and only 1 niche at each end. The east face of the east main mound contains eight pillars while the cor- responding face of the west main mound has four pillars. The same 2:1 relationship exists when comparing the total lengths of each of the faces. In addition, each face is divided roughly into thirds, one third for the colonnade, and a third each for the two niched ends (each of which, by the way, contains three niches). A pattern is set for various architectural features within the site based on the number 12. Fractional relationships of 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/6, and 1/12 are maintained not only in linear but also in areal dimensions. For example, Plaza III is 1/6 the size of Plaza II, which in turn is 1/3 the size of Plaza I. Finer field measurements also indicate that the standard minimum unit of measure was from 25 to 30 cm or about the length of a man's foot. These are ideal relation- ships, however, and should not be confused with today's ideas of standardization. 101</page><page sequence="3">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Figure 1. Site plan of Huaca de los Reyes. The site is noted for its great architectural symmetry and is entered from the east. Passage westward into the site is restricted to narrow passageways and staircases. LABOR INVESTMENT One of the most clearly manifest aspects of the administrative capacity of theocratic chiefdoms is the use of corporate labor for the construction of public works (Service 1975:96). Extant public constructions within the Caballo Muerto complex are the large platform mounds. Though out- wardly big and impressive, such public works, especially monumental architecture, should be dealt with carefully to accurately assess the population and organizational requirements necessary for construction (Erasmus 1965:298-299; Kaplan 1963:404-407; Osborn and Athens 1974:11-14). Estimates of labor input, however, are useful in determining minimal and maximal parameters within which one can theorize about the organizational level most likely to have been attained. [Vol. 45, No. 1,1980] 102</page><page sequence="4">REPORTS Erasmus (1965) furnishes useful data correlating field experiments of labor input with known archaeological sites. With certain modification, his data and estimates seem appropriate for use in calculating the labor investment for the Caballo Muerto mound constructions, in particular Huaca de los Reyes. Excavations at Huaca de los Reyes revealed two major construction phases, the architecture of the second completely covering that of the first. The total site volume is estimated at 41,250 m3, of which 2/3, or 27,225 m3, make up the second construction phase. Fifty percent of this volume is silty clay and 50% is stone, mainly andesite. Multiplying these volumes by their respective specific gravities, 1.35 gm/cm3 for clay (Robinson 1936:173-175) and 2.65 gm/cm3 for andesite (Holmes 1921:24), one attains figures of 18,375,000 kg of clay and 36,075,000 kg of stone. Figure 2 summarizes the several variables involved in labor investment for construction during the second construction phase of Huaca de los Reyes. Considerable effort was expended in gathering and transporting the building materials. The quantity of silty clay needed is such that it could only come from the Moche River 3 km to the south. Water to mix with the clay, at a field- tested ratio of 3 parts water to 16 parts clay, could have come from a main canal inferred to have existed just south of the complex as a whole and about 1.4 km south of Huaca de los Reyes. To sup- ply the rocks, mostly of large cobble and small boulder size, surface stones were gathered, prob- ably within 1 km of the site, or an average of 1000 m to and from the rock source.

In terms of corporate labor, 50 full-time workers could complete the second construction phase in 23.33 years, 100 in 11.66 years, and 1,000 in only 1.166 years. As the above calculations indicate, the length of the building period is a crucial variable. Because of the extraordinary symmetry of the main site, it seems likely that Huaca de los Reyes was built under the direction of a single person. Construction supervision by several individuals, especially through succeeding generations, would have resulted in a less regular layout. This be- ing the case, the maximum time allowance would be 25 years, or one generation, about the length of an active adult lifespan at the time. Given a 25 year time limit, slightly less than 50 full-time workers would have been needed to complete the structure. An estimate of perhaps 1,200 people as the population for the complex at the time (1200 B.C.) was derived by as ere b suming two people/hectare for 600 total irrigated hectares of land (a bit lower that Schaedel's [1971:20, 29] figure of one person/acre). Further, assuming a 1:5 ratio of men to women and children results in an estimated adult male population of 240. It is therefore conceivable that 50 men could have been supported by the local population while en- gaged full time in nonsubsistence pursuits. More likely, however, the main labor force was com- posed of part-time workers under a corvee or mit'a-like system comparable to that evidenced in later prehispanic and hispanic cultures of the central Andes (Metraux 1970:93-94; Moseley 1975:195) and Mexico (Erasmus 1965:279-283; Kubler 1948:144-145). Complementary to the labor force would be a smaller group of full-time specialists acting as masons, plasterers, and decorative experts. Under a mit'a-like system, if each adult male worked an average of 62.5 days a year on the con- struction project, the combined labor would equal that of 50 men working full time. A "donation" of 62.5 days a year is reasonable (Erasmus 1965:281-283) and could easily be scheduled during slack periods in an agricultural timetable. Certainly such figures may vary, but the calculations serve to point out that great masses of laborers were not needed to complete construction in even the relatively short period of 10 or 20 years. Hence, organizational efforts need not have been as substantial or as rigid as might be supposed. ADOBE FRIEZES Huaca de los Reyes is set apart from other mounds within the Caballo Muerto complex by its adobe or clay friezes. A total of 39 friezes (out of a39 frinimum probableezes total(out of t58) hae been un- covered by my excavations (Pozorski 1975) and those of Luis Watanabe (Moseley and Watanabe 1974:154-161). Each is made of fine yellow clay shaped over an inner matrix of cobbles, boulders, and coarser brownish-tan silty clay. Unless stated otherwise, all friezes are contemporaneous. Virtually all friezes are located in niches and on pillar fronts that face plaza centers. Three types of friezes appear as main figures; isolated heads, pedal figures, and standing bipedal figures, and standing profile felines. Each type is characterized by a specific distribution within the site. The largest sculptures are anthropomorphic heads set in niches along the east face of the east main mound. Four of six were uncovered, each measuring some 170 cm across, 130 cm high, and up to 60 cm deep. Each (Figure 3) looks onto Plaza II and had a projected height of over 2 m. The most common type of frieze is the bipedal, probably human, figure usually flanked by two profile fanged heads. In Plaza II, these occur on pillars and in niches originally over 2 m high along the whole front side of each wing structure and along the front of the central colonnade of the east main mound (Moseley and Watanabe 1974:158-159). All of the bipedal friezes lining Plaza II are essentially similar, giving the definite impression of repetitive massiveness. In Plaza III, the theme of a central human figure flanked by or dominating over smaller profile heads is repeated, but with much more variation. On each of the two wing structures, there are two friezed panels that flank the two central pillars. Each is preserved up to 1 m in height and depicts a human figure with serpent heads pendant from its belt standing over two profile heads. In three cases (Figure 4), the heads are inverted and agnathic (lacking a lower jaw), but one on the [Vol. 45, No. 1, 1980] 104</page><page sequence="6">REPORTS Figure 3. Large anthropomorphic head located on the face of the east main mound overlooking Plaza I. south wing (Figure 5) is upright and similar to the ones of the lower plaza. Little remained of the faces of two pillars that were excavated. Of two surviving niches, one on each wing, the flanking elements are agnathic profile heads; one looks inward and the other downward. The central element of each frieze is a semirec- tangular projection from the back wall of the niche, decorated with agnathic heads which prob- ably served as the base for a central human figure. The friezes along the front of the west main mound, all originally at least 2 m high, are the most chronologically and artistically significant. The colonnade area contains four incised friezes (Moseley and Watanabe 1974:159). On each side of the colonnade are two symmetrically placed niches, each containing two friezes, a later superimposed one and a lower, earlier one. All four earlier friezes are contemporaneous with each other since the niches on each side of the colon- nade are interconnected by continuous wall surfaces. 1:0 cm Figure 4.

Two pendant serpent heads are located to the left of the figure's belt. This is located on the wing structure just south of Plaza m. Each early frieze contains a central human figure flanked by two fanged profile heads. In three of the niches (Figure 6), the human figure stands on two cylindrical pedestals and the flanking heads are very similar to ones located in Plaza II. However, in the fourth niche, located to the south of the colonnade, the human figure rests on two small frontal heads, and the profile heads have been executed in a much more curvilinear fashion (Figure 7). Yet, despite the apparent stylistic difference in artistic rendering, this unique frieze is contemporary with the other three. The same niches also contain upper, later friezes; each differs in subject matter from the others (Figures 6 and 7). Two aspects are worth noting: (1) the central figure of each is possibly a human figure, but either the feet themselves are highly modified or they rest upon different types of pedestals; and (2) the flanking elements are all different types of heads, and each has a different orientation-some look downward, others upward, and still others inward. 0 IOcm r- r- Figure 6.

Niche containing superimposed friezes along the front of the west main mound facing Plaza In. The upper frieze represents the decorated feet of a human figure flanked by two upward-looking agnathic heads attached to snakelike bodies. The lower frieze shows a human figure standing on two fron- tal heads flanked by two curvilinear profile fanged heads. The upper friezes, though definitely of the second major construction phase, probably do not date much later than the lower friezes. This is based on the architectural continuities of these niches, the ceramic continuities of both phases, and the stylistic connections between the common profile fanged heads of the lower friezes and the similar heads in Plaza II. The exact time span between the earlier friezes (first construction phase) and the later friezes (second construction phase) is not known, but it probably was not longer than a few generations. The only friezes of a definite nonhuman character are situated at the niched ends of the wings of the two side platform mounds flanking the front of the west main mound. Each of these friezes, one for each wing, faces out onto a plaza directly to the east of the respective platform mounds. Each frieze depicts a profile feline figure of which only the feet and a serpent-head tail remain. The head end of each feline points toward the central east-west axis of the mound. Hence, while all of the aforementioned friezes associated with the main mounds are bilaterally symmetrical within themselves, the side platform friezes are symmetrical with respect to the east-west axis of each mound. Last is an adobe head, dating to the first construction phase, on the summit of the west main mound. Facing north and found in situ at the corner of a rectangular pillar, the head overlooked a sunken room or gallery within the core of the mound. The presence of as many as four of these heads is suggested by the architectural context. Two round corners of the sunken room were un- covered during lateral excavation of the first construction phase on the summit, but tons of debris prevented further exploration of this room. Architectural continuities throughout the site suggest that a similar room probably existed for the second construction phase as well. FRIEZE CONTENT Most of the friezes depict Chavin subjects or at least have certain Chavin stylistic elements. Two distinctive elements present are the pendant eye and the crossed fangs or canines. Definite felines and serpents are also depicted on certain friezes, but other common Chavin subjects not represented are eagles, hawks (or condors), caymans, and the Staff God or the Smiling God (Rowe 1962:18). By far the most common subject is the human form, depicted as standing figures and as large heads, which suggests closer connections with Punkuri, Moxeke, and, in some ways, Cerro Sechin in the Nepeiia and Casma Valleys (Samaniego Roman 1973; Tello 1943, 1956) than with 107</page><page sequence="9">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Chavin de Huantar. These widespread connections would minimally argue for a strong coastal tradition of mound embellishment emphasizing the human form. The meaning of the friezes is much more difficult to determine. In Plaza II, three different be- ings are represented: central human figures; smaller, subordinate profile fanged heads; and large anthropomorphic heads. In Plaza III, the central human figures and the profile fanged heads are present, but so are agnathic heads as well as at least four other minor figures. Different from either Plaza II or Plaza III are the feline depictions on both of the west-side platform mounds. The distribution of different beings correlates well with site layout. Plaza II is lined on three sides by only three types of beings, all represented in friezes each at least 2 m tall. Most were ex- ecuted in a generally repetitious pattern and were probably intended to overwhelm and thereby impress the ordinary visitor who came into this large public plaza. Passage to Plaza III was restricted to two narrow stairways of the back end of the east main mound colonnade (Figure 1). This suggests that only selected people were allowed to pass into Plaza III to view the more varied friezes there. The same is true for thee two west-side platform mound plazas, which can only be entered by way of a narrow passage and stairway at each end of the front of the east main mound. Finally, access to the summit of the west main mound is restricted to a single central stair- case eventually leading to a small sunken room. This room, possibly partially roofed, presumably contained representations of a few of the most sacred beings of the entire culture. The corre- sponding decrease in plaza/room size and ease of access to these areas as one goes westward, along with the increasing variety and differential differential distribution of the friezes, strongly suggests societal divisions. But what was represented by the friezes? The dominance of the human form suggests ancestor worship, a common religious theme among chiefdom levels of social organization (Service 1975:78). The central bipedal figure, so prominently depicted in the friezes of Huaca de los Reyes, could represent the culture hero of the society. Smaller subordinate profile heads may be super- natural aides connected with the culture hero in the mythology of the society. The large an- thropomorphic heads, while not subordinate to the culture hero, may actually represent a passive creator deity who is little interested in mundane affairs. The west-side mound areas probably housed a separate feline cult that catered to the needs of a select few. FRIEZE STYLE Another important aspect of the friezes, style, will not be dealt with in great detail here. Con- sidering criteria such as depth of execution, association of elements, and rectilinearity versus curvilinearity, the frieze sample contains at least three different styles or three extreme varia- tions of an overall style, all of which are essentially contemporary. If these styles were found as isolated examples, undoubtedly they would be classified as stylistically and chronologically dif- ferent. In this respect, the presence of the large Huaca de los Reyes sample has significant bear- ing on the whole question of Chavin style phases in general (Pozorski 1976). SOCIETAL IMPLICATIONS Who built Huaca de los Reyes? The time period is known-radiocarbon dates done on burned cane (cania brava, Gynerium sagittatum) from the first construction period (on the summit of the west main mound) suggest an uncorrected date of around 1300 B.C. (2800 ? 60 radiocarbon years: 850 B.C. [Tx-2180]; 3140 ? 60 radiocarbon years: 1190 B.C. [Tx-1973]; 3310 + 80 radiocarbon years: 1360 B.C. [Tx-1972]; 3680 -+ 80 radiocarbon years: 1730 B.C. [Tx-1974]). The second major construction phase probably dates no more than 100 years later. In the relative mound construction chronology, Huaca de los Reyes belongs in the second of three major building periods (Pozorski 1976:198). No domestic structures were found, but it is likely that substantial numbers of people lived on nearby hillslopes and in flat areas between the various mounds-areas now covered by several meters of alluvium. The frieze iconography suggests con- nections with the Chavin culture farther south, but the dominance of human motifs plus the early 108 [Vol. 45, No. 1,1980]</page><page sequence="10">REPORTS date of the mound argues for a strong local tradition or at least a coastal tradition, the origins of which possibly date before Chavin influence. Studies of labor investment in Huaca de los Reyes indicate that the local population could easily have built the site within 25 years using a part-time mit'a-like labor force. While the bulk of the labor was provided by local agriculturalists, the fine masonry and frieze decoration was executed by a smaller group of specialized artisans. Directing the construction of the site as a whole was the leader or chief of the society, who, though probably advised by a few close associates, was the one who made the final decisions. Hence, labor investment studies indicate the presence of at least three status groups: the common working force, a specialized artisan group, and the leader along with a few elite persons. Considering the small size of the society involved (probably less than 1,500 people) and the early time period, it is likely that the Caballo Muerto people were organized into a chiefdom headed by a charismatic leader (Service 1975:72-74). Status groups ex- isted, not rigid classes, and the leader had no absolute power over the people, only his own per- sonal powers of persuasion and wisdom. Status group divisions are also indicated by intrasite stratification reflected in the layout of Huaca de los Reyes. Plazas I and II could hold a great number of people and were probably used mainly by the common people and occasional visitors to the site. The awe-inspiring nature of dozens of giant friezes, possibly polychrome painted, and all facing onto the plaza, would certain- ly be in accord with this interpretation. Plaza III, which is smaller and has restricted access, con- tains a greater variety of frieze figures. These characteristics imply that the plaza was used by a smaller group of people who had a greater knowledge of the existing religious pantheon and mythology. The group using Plaza III could have been the artisans who constructed the finer elements of the site and the pottery found within it. The adjacent west-side platforms, decorated with feline friezes, seem to represent separate cult areas, possibly used by a subgroup of these ar- tisans or other persons similarly distinguished by other criteria such as wealth, age, sex, or ac- complishment. Finally, access to the inner sanctum of the west main mound summit was likely restricted to the most elite members of the society. Certainly the small size of the room dictates limited group visitation, and the air of secretiveness, possibly akin to galleries in highland Chavin sites, sup- ports this supposition. Thus, various lines of evidence such as labor investment and intrasite stratification from the Caballo Muerto complex in the Moche Valley, and more specifically from the site of Huaca de los Reyes, point to a chiefdom level of societal development. Huaca de los Reyes is one of the best- preserved examples of such a chiefdom-built site along the entire North and Central coasts of Peru. As such, it also exemplifies the transition of the ancient Peruvian society from simpler egalitarian societies to the later stratified states of the Moche and Chimu peoples. Acknowledgments.

SEPARATION OF BONE, CHARCOAL, AND SEEDS BY CHEMICAL FLOTATION Connie Cox Bodner and Ralph M. Rowlett Gravel, bone, carbonized seeds, and charcoal recovered from a 2,000 year old cereal pit were successfully separated by chemical flotation. Specific gravities of each material were determined experimentally, and then for each pair of materials to be separated (e.g., bone from gravel, seeds from charcoal), a solution with a specific gravity intermediate between those of the two materials was used for flotation. Optimal sample sizes and possible sources of error are discussed, as are criteria for selection of solutions. A procedure for evaluating the effect of solutions and flotation practices on test seeds is also presented. Flotation as a means for recovering botanical remains, charcoal, shell, bone, flint chips, and other materials from archaeological contexts has become standard procedure for many projects in recent years. Efforts have been directed towards developing customized versions of hand flota- Connie Cox Bodner and Ralph M.
