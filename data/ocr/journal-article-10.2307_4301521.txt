Clearly, its strength lies initially in the representation of the Paduan and Venetian schools of bronze manufacture, active from the latter years of the Quattrocento and throughout the Cinquecento. Together they constitute a field that has been studied and re- studied by succeeding generations of collectors, connoisseurs, and scholars, each correcting and refining the ideas and groupings of its prede- cessor. A private collector such as Mr. Gregory has the privilege of enjoying and comparing items closely and directly with one another on a daily basis, free from the necessary constraints imposed on objects in public museums; there they are distanced from the beholder, and be- yond the reach of exploring fingers, which pre- vents one of the main means by which they were meant to be apprehended-the sense of touch. In Mr. Gregory's apartment in New York, statu- ettes and miniature busts are interspersed with just the sort of artifacts that once enlivened a humanist's desk and study-rather suitably for a publisher of fine illustrated books. On a cir- cular center-table, neatly arranged on a pattern of specimen marbles, strange creatures from pagan mythology rub shoulders with charming souvenirs of the real world of nature, a minute satyr tending a wounded leg is neighbor to a life- size toad with its mouth wide open to receive a quill pen, parked there by its owner. The quill could be dipped into ink held in a seashell cast from the life but held aloft by a tiny figure of a boy, and the page of parchment was illuminated by an oil lamp in the form of an unusual hu- man head. Candlesticks and finials from fire dogs (andirons) are arranged in pairs on tables and bureaus, and on the wall hangs a heavy bronze door knocker in the form of a lyre, typi- cal of those that used to decorate the portals of Venetian palaces. Doorknobs formed as tur- keys-a species new to Europe at the time- jostle with those shaped as smiling putti, which once adorned the drawers of a wooden cabinet for trinkets and treasures. While North Italy was the collector's first love in the days when he could buy from reliable an- tique dealers of the old school in New York or Europe, recently Mr. Gregory has been rapidly expanding laterally, as it were, into two other great Italian cities with a tradition of bronze- casting, Florence and Rome, always respecting the parameters of aesthetic beauty, intellectual interest, domestic scale, and quality of manu- facture. Thus Morgante, the Medici Court Dwarf, repre- sents the important school of bronze produc- tion initiated in Florence by Giambologna, while northern contemporaries under his influence have contributed a Flying Mercury and a Run- ning Boy, their very titles evoking the new inter- est in movement that pushed the medium of bronze sculpture to its very extremities, by ex- ploiting the tensile strength of the metal alloy so that limbs can fly freely into the surrounding space. In Rome, meanwhile, a gifted sculptor, Fra Guglielmo della Porta, was adapting the late style of draftsmanship of the great Michelangelo, who died in 1564, to the exigencies of small sculp- ture, sometimes in precious metals, conveying religious truths through Christian narrative, statuettes, and crucifixes. These were delicately modelled in the wax models before being cast, and then often enhanced by gilding. The collection also reveals new facets of the now rapidly expanding oeuvre of Francesco Fanelli, a Genoese who was court sculptor to King Charles I in England. The Rearing Horse is an 11</page><page sequence="5">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - FALL 1995 excellent example of a popular model that Fanelli varied slightly to suit his equestrian- minded patrons, the king himself, his courtiers, and the British aristocracy, while a pair of Evan- gelists evoke the other, only recently discovered aspect of Fanelli's work, the religious statues and bronzes that he produced in his native city of Genoa. Rome came into its own as a center of interna- tional consequence for the art of sculpture only in the seventeenth century, with the advent of the precocious genius Bernini, and his calmer rival, Algardi, both of whom thrived under the patronage of the Roman Catholic church dur- ing the epoch of the Counter-Reformation. Im- ages were wrought displaying a touching depth of religious fervor, one of the most successful being Algardi's small but monumental group of the Virgin and Child, and another, his Immacu- late Conception, of which regrettably, owing to previous theft-only the roaring dragon below now remains. To share knowledge, appreciation, and pleasure with others is the generous aim of Alexis Gregory in allowing himself to be deprived of these treasures with which he lives. 12</page><page sequence="6">The Bronze Statuette in the Renaissance Charles Avery Technique Bronze is produced by alloying copper and tin in the proportion of roughly nine parts to one. Silver, zinc, and lead may also be present in small amounts, while trace elements also appear in historical statuettes, owing to imperfect refin- ing techniques and the general reuse of older scrap metal. A higher copper content makes the alloy softer and more workable once it has so- lidified, allowing the sculptor to incise more details or to alter the texture of the surface. Cast- ing in two-part sand molds was appropriate for straightforward objects such as reliefs, medals, or simple figures (indeed, it was used as late as the twentieth century to produce the old-fash- ioned type of toy soldier in lead, with the char- acteristic scrim standing out around the contour, indicating where the pieces of the mold had joined imperfectly). But for any more ambitiously posed human fig- ure, quadruped, or action group with limbs pro- jecting freely or with complex undercutting (e.g., between the legs) it was necessary to use the pro- cess called "lost-wax" (cire perdue in French). This involves making the basic form in clay and coating it with a wax skin as thick as the bronze is required to be (this is determined by a com- promise between the need for durability and for avoiding flaws, and the desire to economize with the expensive metal alloy and to keep the statu- ette relatively light to handle). The beauty of this process lies in the fact that it permits the sculp- tor to model on the surface of the wax the most minute details and varied textures, which-all being well-will be exactly reproduced in bronze once the item is cast. Specialist foundrymen were normally employed to carry out the preparation for casting of the sculptor's clay and wax model by adding wax rods at appropriate points on the surface, all leading to an inverted cone of solid wax. The whole complex was then encased in an outer coat of plaster (the investment). This would be placed upside down in an oven and warmed so that the wax would melt and drip out and the remain- ing mold would be thoroughly dried. What had been solid rods of wax now provided hollow tubes through which metal might enter (run- ners) and hot gases escape (risers) from the mold, and a funnel through which the molten alloy could be poured. After cooling, the outer mold was broken off, and the metal runners and ris- ers were cut off where they touched the surface of the sculpture, leaving little rough areas that needed tooling to match their surroundings, while any flaws or holes would be repaired with metal plugs or patches. At this stage the sculptor himself might inter- vene again, to do the chasing (tooling) and to freshen up with a burin any details that had be- come blurred in the casting process. He could also enhance the texture as desired-Riccio, for in- stance, liked to facet bare areas with a hammer- or add a final polish where he wished, like Antico. A statuette that is finished by the master in this way is defined as autograph, whereas one that does not appear to have enjoyed his personal atten- tion is normally called a workshop cast. Once the cast has been cleaned and polished it has the bright, coppery gold color of a new penny, and it will in the course of time oxidize naturally to a dull brown color, just as the coin does (e.g., cat. no. 1). A lacquer may be applied to preserve the original golden color, or the sur- face may be mercury gilded with gold leaf (see cat. nos. 30, 31, 34, 35, 43, 44, 47, 48, 50, 55, 56). Other colors may be induced by treating the cast with acid (e.g., green with sulfuric acid, which imitates the aftereffects of long burial in the ground, and thus of an antiquity). Finally, other hues could be obtained by apply- ing a colored varnish to the surface-for ex- 13</page><page sequence="7">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - FALL 1995 ample, the bituminous black that was evidently favored in Mantua and Padua during the Renais- sance (see cat. nos. 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 13, 16, etc.), or the translucent reddish lacquer that was preferred in Florence at the end of the sixteenth century (see cat. nos. 38-41). Even clear lacquers darken with age, and so the majority of old bronzes (rather like old master paintings) have a darker appearance than was perhaps originally in- tended. Statuettes are normally shown in con- temporaneous paintings (for instance, in those showing gallery interiors, beloved of the Flem- ish and Dutch schools of the early seventeenth century) as golden in color, but this does not necessarily mean that they were conceived of as made in real gold, or even gilded. A commercially important refinement of the lost-wax technique was developed towards the end of the fifteenth century in northern Italy, whereby piece-molds would be taken in plaster from the original clay and wax model. When reassembled, these could be used to reproduce a number of identical replicas in wax, each of which could then be cast in bronze (see cat. nos. 4, 9-12, 14, 15, etc.). Variations in the positions of limbs or hands could be introduced in these intermediary wax casts, and particular attributes could be added or subtracted before casting them into metal (see cat. nos. 25, 30-35, 38, 40, 42, 49, 55, 56). Thus slight variants could be readily produced from only one master model. Pieces could also be "personalized" by the ap- plication in wax of particular coats of arms, names, or other devices. This was much used on domestic artifacts such as bells and mortars to label ownership indelibly. Broadly speaking, ear- lier bronzes were heavily cast (for safety's sake, and owing to lack of technical expertise) in a coppery alloy, and were unique (one-oft). Later bronzes have thinner walls of metal and so are lighter, and they are often multiples. Casting technology gradually became more advanced, and could be relied upon to convey a surface accurately so that a minimum of afterworking was required. An alloy with more zinc, and thus akin to brass, was used, for example, in south- ern Germany by the middle of the sixteenth cen- tury, in eighteenth century Rome, and later all over Europe. Definition and Status While ideally the statuette is defined as an im- age standing free from any context, in practice many were associated with quasi-architectural settings or with functioning domestic artifacts such as inkstands, lamps, candlesticks, or door knockers. These have usually been separated from "pure" statuettes, falling into the notion- ally inferior category of decorative (or applied) art. Such a distinction is anachronistic, for it did not exist in the Renaissance. The greatest ex- ponent of bronze, Andrea Riccio, produced statuettes and functional articles with equal enthusiasm, care, and intellectual effort. The present collection is symptomatic of how ill-sus- tainable is the artificial separation of Renaissance works in bronze into distinct and watertight compartments. Indeed, the statuette itself has often been relegated to the status of decorative art on account of its small size and the embar- rassing facility offered by the lost-wax technique of casting for serial reproduction. Existence in multiples has historically made the aesthete un- happy, especially-and justifiably-if the in- volvement of other hands in production and decreasing intervention on the part of the artist results in a diminution of quality. When, how- ever, the sculptor himself does closely supervise and personally work on the casts, there is no logi- cal reason to regard them as less "original" or worthwhile from an aesthetic point of view than a work that exists in only a single example. 14</page><page sequence="8">RENAISSANCE AND BAROQUE BRONZES FROM THE COLLECTION OF ALEXIS GREGORY Origins, Cultural Background, and Subject Matter Bronze statuettes and functional artifacts origi- nated with the Bronze Age itself and featured in all the great cultures of the ancient world: Egypt, Greece, Etruria, and Rome. Statuettes were pro- duced mostly for cult purposes, and with the advent of monotheism and Christianity, became anathema to believers-idols of pagan gods fit only for destruction. A number of Christian subjects were manufactured in the Byzantine world, but relatively few were produced during the Middle Ages in Western Europe. Panels of narrative relief for doors, candlesticks, incense burners, and water pitchers (aquamaniles) were cast in bronze or brass, but figures were rare-a monumental Lion in Hildesheim and an eques- trian statuette of the emperor Charlemagne cast in Metz in the ninth century (Musee du Louvre, Paris) are the most famous survivors. Early in the fifteenth century, the revival of in- terest in all things Greek and Roman which was the essence of the Italian Renaissance led to a revaluation of ancient bronze statuettes and ar- tifacts. Their durability had allowed them to survive in relatively good condition, and they began to be collected by the early humanists, along with coins, gems, and cameos. This en- couraged imitation by contemporary sculptors, either legitimately to supply gaps in certain col- lections, or as fakes suitably patinated and pro- duced to deceive the more gullible collectors, who had few means of checking the authentic- ity of things that looked "old." From this dubious inception, therefore, the Re- naissance bronze statuette was a "collectible." It did not have a distinct function, except to in- form, inspire, or delight the beholder, unlike its ancient and medieval prototypes, which had a religious purpose (though Christian subjects such as the Virgin and Child, the Crucifix, saints, and angels were also produced in bronze). A new range of subjects emerged, with a distinctly clas- sical-and hence pagan-flavor: copies on a re- duced scale of monuments (e.g., Filarete's Marcus Aurelius, Grunes Gewolbe, Dresden) or on the same scale as ancient cult statuettes (see cat. nos. 3, 21, 56). The importance of astrology to Renaissance life found expression in miniature renderings in bronze of signs of the zodiac-for example, Aquarius, the water carrier (Staatliche Museen, Berlin), Taurus, the bull, and Cancer, the crab. These could be used as meaningful paper- weights. Perhaps inspired by the interests of the medical school and early attempts at biology, small representations of other creatures at natu- ral size began to appear in bronze too. Crusta- ceans, snakes, and lizards, on account of their firm exteriors, lent themselves to casting directly from nature, by dint of encasing them with an investment, burning out the corpse within, and then pouring in molten bronze. This obviated the need for freehand modelling. Other, softer creatures could perhaps have been stuffed to fa- cilitate casting, though to make a wax model of one was not an insuperable task (see cat. no. 12). A traditional classification with the work of Riccio is no longer valid, and they are more likely to have emanated from one or more of the well- organized foundries capable of economical se- rial production for the middle market, such as that of Severo Calzetta. The practice seems also to have fascinated south German sculptors and silversmiths (e.g., Wentzel Jamnitzer) well into the Baroque period (e.g., Caspar Gras in Innsbruck), while even the sophisticated Bernini introduced some nature casts to enliven the twisted columns of his Baldacchino in Saint Peter's, Rome. Bronze was also employed to recreate functional artifacts broadly in the manner of the ancient world. Its durability and tensile strengtht made 15</page><page sequence="9">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - FALL 1995 it especially useful for pieces that were out of doors and thus exposed to the weather (door knockers, handles, etc., see cat. nos. 25-27), or ones which had to withstand heat (oil lamps, candlesticks, firedogs (andirons), etc., see cat. nos. 10, 14,15-20). The sheer weight of bronze also made it useful for inkstands and penhold- ers so that they would not move about too eas- ily on a desktop or be overbalanced accidentally by the long quill pens that were then in use (cat. no. 1i). Examples of classical nudity were also treasured for their aesthetic and intellectual appeal, not to mention their sensuous attractions. Venus (cat. no. 21), Juno, and Diana were favorite god- desses, while Neptune (god of the sea) and Mer- cury (god of commerce, cat. no. 39) often appeared alongside the archetypally masculine subjects of Jupiter, Mars (possibly cat. no. 29), Hercules, or Vulcan (cat. no. 22). Nude athletes were also much admired, though usually they were given some specific, "learned" subject from mythology. Classical literature, especially Ovid's Metamorphoses, also provided fascinating ac- counts of mythological monsters such as the sphinx (cat. no. 16), the satyr, the faun (see cat. nos. 5-7, 54), and the centaur (cat. no. 56). Por- trait busts of ancient philosophers or Roman emperors featured in the repertoire, and the form was reused for serious-minded contemporaries, even for Christian subjects such as Christ and his apostles, as well as for popes and cardinals. After the human being, the subject most beloved in classical sculpture was the horse, on which man relied for transport, warfare, and hunting. Three monumental sculptures involving the horse survived the iconoclasm or neglect of the Dark and Middle Ages in Rome. Two of these are the pair of fragmentary marble groups show- ing Horse-Tamers, one of which was restored at the end of the fifteenth century by Antico, the Mantuan sculptor who was more famous for his bronze statuettes (Piazza del Quirinale). The other monument to have survived from antiq- uity, only because it was supposed to represent the first Christian emperor, Constantine, is the equestrian statue that we now know to show Marcus Aurelius instead. Antico, presumably while in Rome working on the Horse-Tamer, made a model of this for reproduction as a small statuette for his Mantuan patrons. This was one way in which a knowledge of the antique was disseminated all over Italy, and eventually, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Europe and America too. In Venice, and hence especially influential both there and in nearby Padua, were the four spec- tacular gilt-bronze and over life-size Horses of Saint Mark's. They never had riders, for they originally drew a quadriga (four-horse chariot) that decorated the Hippodrome (racetrack) in Constantinople (see The Horses of San Marco, Venice, exh. cat., Royal Academy, London, 1979, and Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 1980). Renaissance sculptors echoed this enthusiasm for the noble steed-for example, Donatello with his equestrian statue in Padua of a Venetian mercenary commander (condottiere), called on the field of battle "II Gattamelata," and Verrocchio with his still more impressive statue, balanced on only three legs, of another such commander, Colleoni, in Venice. Their most famous successor in major equine statuary was of course Leonardo da Vinci, work- ing in Milan for successive rulers, who planned two successive (though abortive) projects for similar, though yet more grandiose monuments: one with a twice life-size walking horse (which is currently being remodelled at full scale from Leonardo's drawings for casting into steel in Allentown, Pennsylvania), and the other with an even more ambitious rearing horse. It is ironic that all three sculptors were from Florence, which lacked, perhaps for political, democratic reasons, the will to produce such monuments. 16</page><page sequence="10">RENAISSANCE AND BAROQUE BRONZES FROM THE COLLECTION OF ALEXIS GREGORY A reflection of the latter, daring pose, which proved too hard to execute on a large-scale ow- ing to the problems of sheer weight, balance, and support (at least until the seventeenth century), can be seen in two small but truly vivacious statuettes in the Gregory Collection: one from Leonardo's own period and probably executed in Padua (cat. no. 13), and the other from the early Baroque period, probably cast in distant England by the Genoese specialist Francesco Fanelli, a court sculptor to King Charles I (cat. no. 42). The collection of Alexis Gregory thus provides a good and representative cross section of the range of subjects treated from the Renaissance until the end of the seventeenth century. History The great sculptors in bronze of the early Re- naissance in Florence, Ghiberti and Donatello, are not credited nowadays with having created any actual freestanding statuettes, though both were clearly capable of having done so. One need look no further than the figures in cartouches that flank Ghiberti's Gates of Paradise (c. 1425- 50), the infant shield bearers who inhabit the knop of the crozier held by the statue of Saint Louis of Toulouse by Donatello, or his child mu- sicians crowning the font in Siena (c. 1427). Ex- cept for being ensconced in an architectural setting, these are in essence statuettes, albeit with vaguely religious themes. Not surprisingly, there- fore, it is apparently from the circle of Donatello that the earliest freestanding and pagan statu- ette emerged in Florence-Putto Standing on a Tortoise (formerly Pierpont Morgan collection, now with John Abbott and Peter Guggenheim in New York). Modelled perhaps by his partner Michelozzo and cast by their associate Maso di Bartolommeo, this miniature masterpiece served as a visual rendering of the classical motto Festina lente (hasten slowly). The subject of an analogous statuette of a Little Boy Puffing at a Toy Windmill (cat. no. 1) appears to be in much the same philosophical vein, for the playful ac- tion is essentially pointless, and thus is an ex- ample of vanitas (as were later images of children blowing bubbles)-the ultimate futility of all human endeavor. Its ambitious pose is also a perfect-and perhaps deliberate-demonstra- tion of the potential offered to a sculptor by the use of bronze and the lost-wax technique to cre- ate a figure penetrating the surrounding space dramatically in all directions, thus creating a tour de force that would elicit admiration from ev- ery beholder. Several of the earliest significant statuettes of the Renaissance reproduce on a reduced scale monumental statues that survive in Rome. Filarete made a model of the equestrian Marcus Aurelius (Gruines Gewolbe, Dresden) while he was there in the 1440s, producing in bronze the great doors of Saint Peter's (still in situ). Donatello's associate Bertoldo (1420-1491) used bronze to create in miniature a proposed resto- ration of Bellerophon Taming Pegasus (see M. Leithe-Jasper, Renaissance Master Bronzes from the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, exh. cat., Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C., 1986, no. 2). Bertoldo also created for an overmantel in the Medici Palace in Florence a Battle Scene (Museo Nazionale del Bargello, Florence), a re- construction of a heavily mutilated sarcopha- gus in Pisa which has a multitude of figures in such deep relief and so undercut that they are virtually statuettes. These works provide a rep- ertory of types by which other, independent statuettes may be reliably attributed to this ap- parently quite prolific sculptor of bronze on a small scale. Also indebted to Donatello was an- other Florentine, Antonio Pollaiuolo (1431- 1498), who specialized in statuettes of male figures in conflict, such as Hercules, in order to demonstrate his knowledge of anatomy. 17</page><page sequence="11">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - FALL 1995 In Siena, Donatello's work of the 1420S and visit of the 1450S inspired native sculptors of great importance, Vecchietta (1412-1480) and Francesco di Giorgio, who exploited the freedom of modelling and surface texture inherent in lost-wax casting. Most influential of all was Donatello's decade of residence in Padua (1443- 1453) where he built up a team of skilled assis- tants to help with his great commissions of the equestrian statue of "II Gattamelata" and the sculpture for the High Altar in the Basilica of Saint Anthony. He thus founded a tradition of fine-art casting that was to survive in the Veneto for some two centuries. Bartolommeo Bellano was to become famous for his dramatic bronze reliefs (Sant'Antonio, Padua) and his statuettes, though most were still of Christian subjects (e.g., David, Philadelphia Museum). Bellano in turn inspired Severo Calzetta from Ravenna (active 1496-1525) and Andrea Briosco, called "II Riccio" (c. 1460-1532). Their thematically interrelated oeuvres have only recently been disentangled: a plethora of bronze saints, satyrs, classical gods, candlesticks, oil lamps (cat. no. io), inkstands (cat. nos. 9, 11), and door knockers all emanated from Severo's workshop, which evidently re- sorted to serial production on a commercial basis, and survived him by a generation or more, well into the sixteenth century. Alongside some mandatory Christian themes, such as his very emotive, Donatellesque render- ing of the Entombment of Christ (cat. no. 4), Riccio preferred a slightly more elevated range of subjects than those of Severo, and his inter- pretation of classical themes was more poetic because he was inspired by the humanist intel- lectuals of Padua University. Among them were complex allegories, handsome nudes, nymphs, shepherds, Roman warriors, and satyrs (be- nignly interpreted as symbols of the animal side of human nature, see cat. nos. 5-7), as well as grotesque oil lamps and masks. All were imbued with a nervous vivacity conveyed by his subtle modelling in the original wax models, consci- entious chasing of detail, and painstaking ham- mering of exposed surfaces, which gives a vibrant effect. The dark bituminous lacquer that he then applied softened their appearance into an almost Leonardesque sfumato effect. A completely different interpretation of antiq- uity was meanwhile being given at the court of the Gonzaga in Mantua (who were also famous for employing Mantegna) by a bronze sculptor who was nicknamed "L'Antico" on account of his penchant for making copies or, more often, subtle reconstructions on a miniature scale of often damaged classical statuary (by contrast with the free "modern" variations wrought by Riccio). Antico (1460-1528) used to polish the smooth, nude surfaces of his figures, darken them artificially, and pick out details with gild- ing or silver inlay (e.g., in the eyes). These luxury products appealed to his princely patrons, such as Isabella d'Este. In the present collection a small Cupid (cat. no. 3) is nearest to Antico in subject and style. In Venice, which had become by the mid-fif- teenth century a great center of bronze-found- ing in order to equip its fleet with cannon and nautical paraphernalia cast in bronze or brass, the first great sculpture produced in bronze was the equestrian monument to Colleoni, modelled by the Florentine immigrant Verrocchio, but cast only after his death in 1488 by Leopardi, a local foundryman-sculptor. The latter went on to pro- duce three splendid pedestals for the flagpoles in front of Saint Mark's. Camelio, Desiderio da Firenze, and Antonio Lombardi also made ex- cellent statuettes in bronze there during the High Renaissance. Thereafter, Venice replaced Padua as the greatest center of bronze sculpture in northern Italy. Tuscan influence was introduced by Jacopo Sansovino, when he arrived from Rome in 1527. i8</page><page sequence="12">RENAISSANCE AND BAROQUE BRONZES FROM THE COLLECTION OF ALEXIS GREGORY Employed by the city as chief architect, bronze offered him the only means of continuing his career as a sculptor, for he needed only to pro- duce the wax models, which was not time-con- suming or overly demanding, and then he could delegate the rest of the work to skilled crafts- men-sculptors such as Tiziano Minio (see Jacopo's signed group of the Virgin and Child in the Cleveland Museum of Art). His greatest fol- lower, who also produced some superb statu- ettes (e.g., Saint Sebastian, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), was Alessandro Vittoria from Trent (1525-1608), with whom Tiziano Aspetti, a Paduan (c. 1559-1606), and Girolamo Campagna (1552-1623) from Verona, shared the laurels during the latter part of the sixteenth century. Campagna's work is repre- sented here by a wax casting model of the Vir- gin and Child (cat. no. 57)-a very rare thing to survive, for if casting had proceeded as intended this wax image would inevitably have been lost in the process. Vittoria, an established sculptor by the date of the second edition of Vasari's Lives of the Artists (1568), was prolific with his ideas and was not above delegating the labor of production to a variety of skilled craftsmen. One of the compo- sitions credited to him (without specific evi- dence, though with general consent) is that of Jupiter with His Thunderbolt and Eagle which, accompanied by a statuette of Juno, was serially reproduced by an anonymous Venetian foundry to serve as a finial on one of a pair of firedogs, some of the most popular and char- acteristic products during the last third of the sixteenth century and later. A similar, though later, pair of firedogs was once capped with fig- ures appropriate to the maritime power of Venice, a pair of Tritons Blowing Shell Trumpets (see cat. nos. 17, 8). On the basis of generic stylistic comparisons with some signed and dated works, a number of widely disseminated bronzes have been attrib- uted to Tiziano Aspetti, some of which are rep- resented here: a pair of Judith with the Head of Holofernes and Mercury with the Head of Argus (cat. nos. 19, 20); a Vulcan (cat. no. 22), one of a pair of hefty nude figures, again from firedogs; and a typically Venetian, lyre-shaped door knocker with a human figure flanked by growl- ing lions (cat. no. 25). These may loosely be as- sociated on stylistic and iconographic grounds with other statuettes: a Saint Mark (cat. no. 23), a Lion (cat. no. 24), and a pair of doorknobs in the unusual shape of Turkeys (cat. nos. 26, 27). On the basis of the many putti amidst clouds that feature on Niccolo Roccatagliata's altar fron- tal depicting the Deposition of Christ in San Moise, Venice (1599), it is customary to ascribe to him a whole range of well-loved statuettes of putti, often bearing attributes, that decorated altar complexes in churches or cabinets in pal- aces all over Venice (see cat. nos. 30-35). How- ever, the motif is descended from the father of the school, Jacopo Sansovino, and so could have been exploited by any number of his followers. More important, a recent purchase for the present collection, a statuette in Roman armor, is so carefully modelled and expertly chased that it is probably from Roccatagliata's own hand (cat. no. 29). There were in Venice a common repertory of motifs and ornaments and a common foundry technology, applied to a wide but standard range of cast artifacts, that leave little scope ex post facto for differentiating accurately between the various authors on purely artistic grounds. It has to be borne in mind, therefore, that these attri- butions by association are often generic rather than specific, and accordingly have a symbolic rather than a factual value. There was no con- cept of artistic copyright and any foundry could reproduce or vary at any time the work of an- other by taking piece-molds in plaster off an 19</page><page sequence="13">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - FALL 1995 existing bronze, and then making from them new casting models in wax for translation back into bronze. Slight shrinkage (around 5 percent) and a loss of precision in details are the only signs of this subterfuge. In Tuscany and Rome meanwhile, Michel- angelo's distaste for bronze as a medium for sculpture discouraged younger artists until well after he had left Florence in 1534. Then, in the 1540s, Bandinelli, Cellini, and Pierino da Vinci revived the tradition of Donatello, Bertoldo, and Pollaiuolo with a number of statuettes of mythological characters (Museo Nazionale del Bargello, Florence). The next generation all mas- tered the art of the small bronze in order to pur- vey statuettes to the Medici grand dukes and their courtiers, as well as to their international contacts. The locus classicus was the celebrated Studiolo of Francesco I de' Medici, created around 1570 in the government palace in Flo- rence. Eight large statuettes to fill niches on the walls and symbolizing the four elements were commissioned from different sculptors, provid- ing an ideal opportunity to compare their styles and talents. Among them were Ammannati and Bandini, and, representing the younger genera- tion, Giambologna, Vincenzo Danti, and Elia Candido (see cat. no. 40). Giambologna (1529-1608), a Flemish immi- grant, became court sculptor and dominated Florentine, and indeed European sculpture for half a century between approximately 156o and his death in 16o8. His suave, eye-catching com- positions assured him international success, which was achieved by the wide dissemination all over Europe of statuettes, either as diplomatic gifts or by way of commerce. As his popularity grew, Giambologna was forced to delegate pro- duction to a specialist, Antonio Susini (cat. nos. 38, 39). He also employed-or strongly influ- enced-many younger aspiring sculptors from the North, like himself, and among them was Adriaen de Vries. To his circle is tentatively at- tributed a cast of a Satyr (cat. no. 54) in this col- lection. Another of Giambologna's principal colleagues as he grew older, and his successor as sculptor to the grand dukes, was Pietro Tacca, who passed on in due course the stylistic tradition of the workshop to his own son, Ferdinando. In Rome, during the third quarter of the six- teenth century, bronze-casting was enjoying a revival in the hands of the great sculptor Guglielmo della Porta (c. 1500-1577). It was, af- ter all, analogous with gold- and silversmiths' work, which was in great demand at the papal court for liturgical vessels and accoutrements. Guglielmo was granted the office of the seal holder (del Piombo), a papal sinecure that had been held before him by the painter Sebastiano. He therefore specialized in Christian subjects, planning, among other things, a cycle of large bronze reliefs narrating the Passion of Christ for the western doors of Saint Peter's. Two sketch- books full of sensitive pen drawings for them survive in Dusseldorf, as well as a few miniature derivatives, finely cast in bronze from delicate wax models and carefully chased with attention to expressiveness. To them are related a Crucifix and a Flagellator (cat. nos. 46, 47), while part of a tableau showing the Pieta (cat. no. 48), which may be attributed reliably to Guglielmo's son Teodoro, shows the same spirit and care in ex- ecution. Rome never became as great a center for the pro- duction of bronze statuettes, apart from reduc- tions of the most popular antique statues, as Florence and Venice. Some were, however, pro- duced virtually as by products of the major sculptures of the great triumvirate of early Baroque sculptors, Bernini, Algardi, and Duquesnoy. This is particularly true of Bernini, some of whose terracotta bozzetti seem to have been cast into bronze for the sake of preserva- 20</page><page sequence="14">RENAISSANCE AND BAROQUE BRONZES FROM THE COLLECTION OF ALEXIS GREGORY tion. With Algardi, there are several models that he produced expressly for reproduction in cast metal, perhaps initially in gold or silver, but which were then replicated from the same molds in the less expensive bronze. One such, and a star piece of the Gregory collection, is a nobly evocative group of the Virgin and Child (cat. no. 49). The balanced though centrifugal composi- tion, the excited flow and counterflow of drap- ery, the warmth and charm of the faces, and the delicate outstretched hands are characteristic of Roman Baroque sculpture at its most accessible to believer and nonbeliever alike. A remnant of another similar statuette of the Virgin of the Immaculate Conception is a roaring Dragon (cat. no. 50), which in character and appearance is curiously reminiscent of bronze beasts by Severo of a century and a half earlier. During the early Baroque period, but from a less predictable center, the important maritime city of Genoa, came Francesco Fanelli (1605-1661), later called in England "the one-eyed Italian." His career has been studied from the English end (he was invited to London in the 1630s to serve King Charles I, who was becoming dissatisfied with his French court sculptor, Hubert Le Sueur), but recently his earlier activity as a mature sculp- tor in his native city has been published. There his patrons placed greater emphasis on religious commissions (see cat. nos. 43-44), whereas in England he specialized in serially producing small but vivacious statuettes and groups of horses (cat. no. 42). According to Joachim von Sandrart, who owned one of his works, Fanelli had perfected his technique to the point where he could cast them with a wall "no thicker than a thaler (a coin=dollar)." He also made a prac- tice of altering some of the details at the stage of the wax casting model, so that although they look superficially alike, no two are actually iden- tical. This made more work, but was perhaps a matter of professional pride. Fanelli's style is similar to that of the Florentine court sculptors Pietro Tacca and, more particularly, his succes- sor Ferdinando Tacca, and they may have been in touch, for the Taccas hailed from the quarry town of Carrara, which was Genoese territory. While the Italians tended to dominate the Eu- ropean scene in the production of bronze statu- ettes, as is evident in this typical collection, other countries also made contributions, notably France, in the style of the School of Fontaine- bleau that was derived from Primaticcio and Cellini, with sculptors such as Pilon, Ponce Jacquiot, and Prieur. It is uncertain in the present state of research whether our catalogue number 53 comes from this school. In Germany the strong traditions of the Meuse Valley and elsewhere in producing decorative and ecclesiastical metalwork in brass, which tended to retain Gothic traits of style until well into the sixteenth century, was combined in the southern cities of Nuremberg and Augsburg with influences from the neighboring northern parts of Italy. The prolific draftsman Albrecht Durer was in great part responsible for import- ing knowledge of the classical revival which was occurring in Venice, after he visited there. Peter Visscher the Elder (c.1460-1529), and more par- ticularly his son, Peter the Younger (1487-1528), adapted the tradition of bronze craftsmanship in Nuremberg to the exigencies of High Renais- sance design, and they had a strong following. Later, in the eighteenth century, the bronze foundrymen of Rome resorted once again, as a commercial expedient, to reproducing famous antiquities on a domestic scale for visiting Grand Tourists, many of them from Great Britain. Whole garnitures for one's mantelpiece could be purchased inexpensively from the retail shops of the Zoffoli brothers and Francesco Righetti, but these fall outside the scope of the present collection. Righetti also cast sculpture for Canova, the preeminent neoclassicist. During 21</page><page sequence="15">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - FALL 1995 the second quarter of the nineteenth century, the nature of society changed, and bronze statuettes tended to be directed towards the less elevated tastes of the emerging bourgeoisie rather than those of intellectuals or aristocrats, as had been traditional. Correspondingly, there were great changes in subject matter, following the taste of the Romantic Movement. These statuettes were brilliantly cast and reproduced in great quanti- ties by Parisian foundries using the technique of sand-casting, which had been modernized to meet the needs of the industrial revolution. Biographies of Sculptors Represented Alessandro Algardi (1598, Bologna-1654, Rome)-cat. nos. 49,50 Algardi was one of a triumvirate of sculptors, along with Bernini and Duquesnoy, who con- stituted the Baroque school in Rome during the first half of the seventeenth century. Most of his creations were on the whole predicated by gran- diose environments in churches and palaces of popes, cardinals, and their relatives, but a num- ber of statuettes were cast to his designs in pre- cious metals, or bronze, with or without gilding, and mostly on Christian themes (Virgin and Child; Charity; Flagellation of Christ). Tiziano Aspetti (1559, Padua-i6o6, Pisa)-cat. nos. 19-28 Aspetti belonged to a Paduan family with a tradition of bronze-casting over three genera- tions. He was associated with two of the great- est names in Venetian sculpture from the second half of the sixteenth century, Girolama Campagna and Alessandro Vittoria, whose style he adopted. At the end of the century he cast a pair of bronze reliefs of Episodes from the Life of SaintDaniel for the crypt of Saint Anthony's, Padua (signed duplicates now in the Metropoli- tan Museum of Art, New York). These are peopled with vigorous muscular figures in dra- matic poses and with stylized drapery. He is credited with a large number of statuettes and artifacts, attributed on the basis of style and not documents. From 1599 to 1602 he worked in Tuscany, and there seem to have been recip- rocal influences with the style of Giambologna and his followers there. Giambologna [jean Boulogne] (1529, Douai- 16o8, Florence)-cat. no. 38 Trained in his native Flanders until 1550, Giambologna, as he became known in Italy, went to Rome and then Florence, where he became court sculptor to successive Medici grand dukes. A great admirer of ancient Greco-Roman sculp- ture and of Michelangelo, Giambologna turned his hand to all sorts of sculpture: monumental statues in bronze or marble; a multitude of sub- jects on the smaller scale of statuettes in bronze; and reliefs, often on Christian themes. His most famous tour de force was the marble group of the Rape of a Sabine Woman, with three figures carved out of a single block (1583, Loggia dei Lanzi, Florence). His statuettes were brilliantly calculated evocations of an ideal world of pa- gan gods and goddesses, among which his Fly- ing Mercury (messenger of the gods) was such a strong image that it is still used today to sym- bolize speedy courier services worldwide. Giambologna was the premier sculptor of Eu- rope during the second half of the sixteenth cen- tury, and his busy workshop was a fertile training ground for aspiring sculptors. Riccio [Andrea Briosco, called "II Riccio"] (1470, Trent-1532, Padua)-cat. nos. 4-8 Generally known by his nickname, Riccio was the greatest sculptor of bronze statuettes ever known. Their subjects were influenced by the revival of interest in ancient mythology among the humanist professors of Padua University. Riccio also worked in terracotta and bronze on a larger scale, though there his themes tended to be Christian, rather than pagan. Although 22</page><page sequence="16">RENAISSANCE AND BAROQUE BRONZES FROM THE COLLECTION OF ALEXIS GREGORY trained as a goldsmith, Riccio soon turned to sculpture, which he learned from Bellano, Donatello's associate, and so he became indi- rectly a follower of Donatello, through the ex- ample of his statuary in the Basilica of Saint Anthony. Riccio completed Bellano's series of narrative panels of Old Testament themes in the Basilica, but he introduced a suaver, dis- tinctly more classical style, influenced by Mantegna. His masterpiece was the twelve foot high Paschal Candlestick in the Basilica. Com- missioned in 1507, its completion was inter- rupted by hostilities until 1516. It is an extra- ordinarily rich compendium of Christian and pagan themes used allegorically, expressed in reliefs and attached statuettes, which provide a touchstone for attributing to him undocu- mented statuettes and domestic artifacts. Niccolo Roccatagliata (b. Genoa, active Venice 1593-1636)-cat. nos. 29-35 Trained as a goldsmith in Genoa, Roccatagliata moved to Venice, supposedly to learn to carve stone. However, all his documented or signed works are cast in bronze. In 1593 he received a commission for a pair of large statuettes of Saints George and Stephen and some candlesticks and brackets for San Giorgio Maggiore, Venice. Between 1598 and 1630, Roccatagliata returned to Genoa, but in 1633 he signed (together with his son and the foundrymen) a magnificent bronze altar- frontal (antependium) showing God the Father for the Venetian church of San Moise. Roccatagliata's figure style and technique of rapid modelling, with most of the detail de- fined in the original wax-casting models, was derived from the painterly technique of Jacopo Sansovino, and the work of his major contem- porary, Vittoria. A vast range of domestic arti- facts from the Venetian school with figurative decoration, often including chubby cherubs (putti), is grouped under his name without much substantiating evidence. Severo da Ravenna [Severo Calzetta] (active 1496, Ravenna-active 1525, Ravenna)-cat. nos. 9-11 Severo's bronze sculpture has been disentangled from that of Bellano and of his closer contem- porary, Riccio, only recently. His first docu- mented work was a marble statue of Saint John the Baptist for the chapel of Saint Anthony in the Basilica at Padua (signed and dated 1500). He worked in that city probably until its occu- pation by hostile troops in 1509, when he re- turned to his native Ravenna for the remainder of his career. Several bronze statuettes of reli- gious figures may be associated with the marble Saint John of 1500, but the majority of Severo's oeuvre was of pagan subject matter, notably of dragons (see cat. no. ii) and satyrs in various combinations. In this he preceded Riccio. They were usually associated with functional at- tributes and served as inkstands, lamps, and candlesticks. Shells and pots to contain ink, or sand for blotting, were fitted by means of pro- jecting screw threads into holes on geometrically shaped stands, alongside the statuettes. This meant that the components were interchange- able, and so could be assembled in various combinations to suit a client's taste. Workshops in Padua or Ravenna continued to reproduce Severo's designs in increasingly debased casts for a generation or more. Severo himself was highly praised by a learned young friend, Pomponius Gauricus, in his treatise De sculp- tura (Padua, 1504). Adriaen de Vries (c. 1545, The Hague-i626, Prague)-cat. no. 54 This Dutch sculptor first appeared in Giambologna's workshop in Florence in 1581, de- scribed as a goldsmith, and chasing the surface of a crucifix. Eventually he transmitted Giam- bologna's style to the whole of central Europe. In 1588 he was appointed court sculptor to the duke of Savoy in Turin, but by 1593 he was in the employ of the emperor Rudolf II in Prague. Af- 23</page><page sequence="17">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - FALL 1995 ter briefly visiting Rome (1595) he worked for some years in Augsburg creating two magnifi- cent public fountains that were crowned respec- tively with bronze statues of Mercury and of Hercules (1596-1602). He next moved to Prague, upon his appointment as court sculptor to Rudolf (1602), and worked there for most of the remainder of his career. De Vries evolved an ex- citing and idiosyncratic style by adapting the free technique that Giambologna used in his mod- els to finished work, even when on a monumen- tal scale. He exploited his expertise in casting to avoid the necessity for much afterworking of the cold metal, and so was able to produce a larger than average number of monumental statues. They comprise impressively muscular and sinuous figures in complex poses. Many of them were plundered in the Thirty Years War and still decorate the gardens of the Swedish royal palace of Drottningholm. 24</page><page sequence="18">Catalogue of the Exhibition Italian, Florence, second half of the 15th century Follower of DONATELLO DI BETTO BARDI (1387-1466); possibly PASQUALINO DA MONTEPULCIANO (c. 1460) Little Boy Puffing at a Toy Windmill Bronze, 111/2 in (29 cm) high Provenance With Alfred Spero; with Cyril Humphris (sale Sotheby, New York, 1i January 1995, no. lol) Comparative Literature C.

He directs his gaze up and slightly to his right, towards the end of the item (if it was a windmill, towards its sails). The crown of the head is open and there are numerous plugs in the surface of the cast, which has a dark brown patina. Interpretation This unpublished statuette of a child innocently at play belongs to a class popular in the Italian Renaissance that are known in Italian as putti. They are generically based on Classical bronze statuettes of genii or erotes (cupids), that were particularly popular in Imperial times, many for example having come to light in the excavations at Pompeii and Herculaneum. To Donatello goes the credit for reviving this amusing type of in- fant figure, to relieve the seriousness of content in many of his religious works, such as the font in the baptistery of Siena Cathedral, or the Cavalcanti Annunciation in Santa Croce, from the 1420S and 1430S respectively. His bronze statuettes of baby musicians on the former com- plex were modelled completely in the round in suave, spiraling compositions, and seem to have created a vogue for similar figures to ornament the dining table or the study of merchant princes or humanists. 25</page><page sequence="19">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - FALL 1995 Of similar size is a very Donatellesque and pos- sibly autograph bronze Cupid with a Dolphin that stands on a turtle and functions as a wall fountain (Victoria and Albert Museum, 475- 1864; Bode ed. Draper 1980, pl. VIII; London 1961, no. 4). Possibly the earliest (insofar as dating purely by style permits) independent bronze statuette is a Putto Standing on a Tortoise-just five inches high-from the workshop of Donatello's part- ner Michelozzo, or their joint associate, Maso di Bartlommeo (Abbott Guggenheim collection, New York; formerly Pierpont Morgan Library, NewYork: see Camins, 1988; Avery, 1988b). Simi- lar, active putti inhabit the openwork acanthus scrolls of the bronze screens round the Chapel of the Holy Girdle in Prato Cathedral (Marchini 1952). These were executed over a great number of years (1438-67) by several successive sculp- tors, including Maso di Bartolommeo, and, lat- terly, Pasqualino da Montepulciano, who did the majority of the putti. Perhaps closest to the present figure in the treatment of the infant anatomy and the type of face, with big eyes, rose- bud lips and chubby cheeks, is a smaller figure of a cupid with a raised right arm and a low- ered left one, which once held something in its clenched fist, that was traditionally classed as "workshop of Donatello" (Bode ed. Draper, pl. VIII, but now as "North Italian, late fifteenth century"; London 1961, no. 6, as "Style of Donatello, possibly Maso do Bartolommeo"). The open, active pose with the legs spread wide apart and the penetration of the surrounding space by the arms relates the two figures. The actions of the arms of the present figure are closely similar to those in a larger statuette of a Winged Infantin the Metropolitan Museum, New York (1983.356; see Draper in Notable Ac- quisitions 1983-84, pp. 26-27; Avery in Christie's sale catalogue, 20 June 1983, lot 109): its mouth is pierced to emit a stream of water (piped up inside the hollow casting) which would have played against and thus rotated the sails of a child's toy windmill (presently missing), as though in real life he were puffing air from his distended cheeks. This is not the case with the present figure, probably on account of its smaller scale, but perhaps even so it was at the center of a table fountain, with a jet from elsewhere serv- ing to turn the sails of the missing windmill, unless they were revolved simply by natural cur- rents of air, which would have been ever-present in drafty Renaissance buildings. Corroboration for the supposition that the present composition is indeed Florentine is to be found in the existence of a larger figure of a grown man that once bore the attributes of Mercury and functioned similarly as a wall fountain in the Medici Palace; it was cast by Gianfrancesco Rustici in 1515 for Cardinal Giulio de'Medici (M.G. Ciardi-Dupre, "Giovan Francesco Rustici," Paragone (Arte) 157 (1963): 38, pl. 45). A date around 1460, in between those proposed for the two larger fountain figures of "mid-fif- teenth century" and 1515, seems logical for the present statuette, as the stylistic idiosyncrasies of Donatello and his immediate associates seem to be less prevalent, and yet its modelling does not seem to have quite the plump richness asso- ciated with Verrocchio, or, ultimately, his pupil, Rustici. It is worth noting that bronze figures of putti balancing on globes as the spouting finials for fountains must have been popular in the Renaissance, for they feature more than once in miniatures or paintings of idealized "cityscapes' of the type previously associated with Francesco di Giorgio, but now more cau- tiously described as "late fifteenth century" (e.g. Architectural Perspective, Walters Art Gallery, Baltimore [37.677]). 26</page><page sequence="20">RENAISSANCE AND BAROQUE BRONZES FROM THE COLLECTION OF ALEXIS GREGORY 2.

Other Examples National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. Condition/Facture The small bust is cast hollow but with a thick wall (1/4 in.) The bare shoulders and perhaps (though less obviously) the face have been carefully ham- mered to break the shine and give a more subtle surface texture. This technique is one used by Riccio, though it was not exclusive to him, and also appears on certain Florentine bronzes. Interpretation The noble, mature type of male face, with aqui- line nose, prominent cheekbones and strong chin, and with its the brow knitted in suffering, as well as the luxuriant curly hair, is often found in Renaissance paintings of Saint Sebastian. They are also to be encountered in a bronze statuette of him, formerly ascribed to Riccio, but now held to be by Severo Calzetta da Ravenna (Migeon 1904; Pope-Hennessy 1970, no. 470; Avery and Radcliffe 1983, figs 16a/b). Ricci's suggestions that the bust might represent a youthful Bacchus or Alexander the Great do not seem particularly helpful, while Migeon's contention that it might instead represent Saint John the Baptist is belied by the bare shoulders, which would be inconsistent with contemporary iconography of that saint, who is normally shown clad in a camelskin. The small size indi- cates a domestic use, and perhaps the bust was of the patron's name saint. *. ... . . .. ; o_1 Attribution For the example in Washington, Pope-Hennessy suggests a Florentine origin around 1500, follow ing Kenneth Clark, who connects it with the circle of Leonardo da Vinci. Previous connoisseurs have attributed it to Riccio (Migeon, Ricci, and Cott), but Pope-Hennessy writes "Technically and sty- listically the bust is incompatible with the work of Riccio." The name of Leonardo's close associ- ate in Florence, Gianfrancesco Rustici (1474-1554), has been mentioned as a possible author for he was involved between 1506 and 1511 in producing in collaboration with Leonardo the monumental group of The Preaching of Saint John the Baptist to go over the portal of the Baptistery in Florence. 27</page><page sequence="21">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - FALL 1995 He also independently produced at least one bronze statuette, a Mercury for the Palazzo Medici in 1515. This attribution remains hypothetical in the present state of knowledge. 3. North Italian, Mantua, early 16th century From the circle of ANTICO (PIER JACOPO ALARI-BONACOLSI: 1460-1528) Cupid Bronze, 73/8 in. (18.7 cm) high Provenance Sotheby's, London, 20 December 1973, lot 103; Cyril Humphris, London Comparative Literature Hermann 1910, pp. 414-18; Bode 1922, pI. 92; Planiscig 1924, pp. 57-58, no. 102; Radcliffe 1981, pp. 46-49; Stone 1982, pp. 87-116; Allison 1992, pp. 171-81; Leithe-Jasper 1994, pp. 350-51, no. 110. Condition/Facture The figure is hollow cast in an apparently cop- pery bronze alloy, and has been given a black patina. The core material has carefully been re- moved through a rectangular slot in the back, between the wings: rebates at either end and undercutting at the sides of this slot indicate that it was once patched. The flawed outer edge of the left wing may also carefully have been patched with a separate piece of metal, as is in- dicated by an adjacent rectangular indentation. A small pit above the left buttock may be the trace of a core pin. There are small flaw holes in the curls at the left and on the crown of the head, left of center. The surface of the flesh has been smoothed by the use of a scraper, which has left a faintly faceted pattern, e.g. behind the right thigh and on that buttock. The right toes have been sawn off the foot, perhaps to permit the statuette to be detached from a base. The left thumb and index finger have been broken off completely, and adjacent fingers truncated. Interpretation Cupid looks up questioningly or beseechingly, presumably at an adult figure standing next to him and looking down: the in- fant holds up for inspection, or is receiving, some separately cast and now missing items. These may have been his tra- ditional attributes of bow and arrows, and/or quiver for same, but could also be a scroll, if he is learning to read (see below.) Attribution The style and facture point ge- nerically towards Antico: (see Stone 1982.) This Cupid may well be close in type to the one at whom Antico's statuette of Mercury in Vienna (41 cm high) originally looked down and lectured, with a monitory forefinger. A group of Mercury teach- ing Cupid to read ("Mercurio che insegna a leggere a Cupido") featured in the inventory of Isabella d'Este around 1530, and, if this is the example now in Vienna, the Cupid was missing by the time that it was acquired by Archduke Leopold Wilhelm, or at least by the date of his inventory in 1659. The oval base on which the Vienna Mercury stands has two slots for attach- ing another smaller figure: they may correspond approximately with the feet of the present statu- 28</page><page sequence="22">RENAISSANCE AND BAROQUE BRONZES FROM THE COLLECTION OF ALEXIS GREGORY ette, which has no base of its own, while it also seems to be about the right height to work psycholo- gically with Mercury's downward glance and physically with his right index finger. However, this hypothesis has not been borne out by the results of a technical examination of the statuette that was kindly carried out in Feb- ruary 1994 by Richard Stone of the Conservation Department of the Metro- politan Museum of Art, New York. He feels that neither technical nor sty- Antico (Pier Jacopo Alari- Bonacolsi), 1460-1528. Mercury. Bronze, 41 cm. high. Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna. listic considerations relate the statuette with the work of Antico. The Vienna Mercury is, however, the same size as the two other casts, a finer one in the Museo Nazionale, Florence (413) and another in the Galleria Estense, Modena (2557), and so it was not created by after-casting from either of them. Allison writes of it, Although of slightly inferior quality, this Mercury is the same size as the other speci- mens of the motif, therefore the prima facie evidence suggests that the wax model of this figure was varied and slightly reduced by Antico and cast by an unknown hand. Its oil- gilding, which was sometimes used in Antico's late work, and its presumable docu- mentation in Isabella's grotta preciate that it is a slight variant produced between 1520 and 1522 of the model created c. 1505-1511. This being so, might not the Cupid that is miss- ing from the base also manifest signs that are diverse from Antico's finest work? Probably the only way to resolve the enigma would be physi- cally to juxtapose the two statuettes, and to see if they fitted both physically and aesthetically together. 4.

The edges are roughly filed off and not rectilinear, especially at the bottom of the scene. There is a tiny casting flaw about 1/4 inch down from the top right hand corner. The surface detail appears to be as cast from the wax, with no traces of afterworking, apart possibly from some smoothing of the na- ked legs and arms. The inscription on the front of the sarcophagus has not been chased. Its sheer irregularity and the undisturbed surface of the plaquette attest to its authenticity. Interpretation The inscription reads: "QVEM TOTVS NO: I CAP.ORB. / IN HAC / TVMBA. CLAVDIT" for "Quem totus non capit orbis, in hac tumba clauditur" (He whom the whole world could not hold is confined to this tomb). Attribution This is an excellent, contemporary cast of one of Riccio's best known and most widely diffused plaquettes, though one of which no signed ex- ample exists. The composition exists in two main types, one with and the other without the in- scription on the sarcophagus. The iconography of the Entombment, a theme that recurs in a number of variants in Riccio's oeuvre, is strongly influenced by Donatello, for example the marble relief of the Entombment on the tabernacle of the Sagrestia dei Beneficiati in Saint Peter's, Rome, and the large stone relief behind the high altar of the Basilica of Saint Anthony's in Padua, as well as various derivative plaques. Ultimately, however, its compositional prototypes are an- tique. They can be found on Hadrianic sar- cophagus reliefs representing the death of Meleager, which were accessible in Riccio's day. ... . .: .... R .&amp; ;- M .4c~~~~~~~~~~~ K / csp 1 ! a = 9A Contrary to the view expressed by Middeldorf, the present plaquette is not just a free variant of Riccio's purely narrative treatment of the En- tombment on his early masterpiece, the Paschal Candlestick in the Basilica of Saint Anthony's in Padua (1507-16). The symbolic content of the present image points to a mature work of the sculptor which, as argued by Bange and Pope- Hennessy, reflects instead the style and compo- sition of Riccio's reliefs on the Della Torre monument in Verona (after 1527; original bronze reliefs now in the Musee du Louvre). The present plaquette should therefore be dated within the last decade of Riccio's life. Above: cat. no. 4. Below: Andrea Riccio, 1470- 1532, The Entombment of Christ.

There is a small hole beneath its beard, probably left by an extracted core pin. The color is yellowish, from the naturally patinated metal, with few, if any, traces of dark lacquer, and is more probably darkened by an accretion of old wax and depos- ited dust. Interpretation The complex pose is brilliantly conceived and executed, with the figure leaning back on its left buttock to counterbalance itself, as it reaches forward with its right arm to tend its wounded right leg. Its left arm, clutching a horn and thrust backwards, serves as a counterbalance, while the expression on the face is purposefully intent on the action. * :ze, t-ft0 ~~~~~~~~~~~~.. ........ 0 . ....... . ... . ; . . .... .... t. _ X ......... ; . ........... . .......... . .........A no nym o us, ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. ... _...... ::..: ..:. .. . . ........... . ...

National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., Widener Collection. . ** * . 31</page><page sequence="25">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - FALL 1995 Several other casts are known in approximately this form, in Munich, Rome, and Vienna, with the first two holding in their left hands an ob- ject that is definitely characterized as a horn. However, in the cast in Stockholm, the object is clearly depicted as a snake. This explains the original subject, a satyr which has been bitten on the leg by a snake that he has plucked away with his left hand, and while falling to the ground, presses poison from the snakebite with his right hand. While satisfactorily complete in themselves, these delightful figurines probably formed part of larger groups of satyrs set on naturalistic bases, or on utensils. In two instances similar satyrs are attached to larger groups. One in Florence is incongruously mounted on a tripod inkstand beside a much larger satyress and her child which would nowa- days be classified as from the workshop of Severo from Ravenna (Planiscig 1927, fig. 445). The other, in Vienna, which is not quite identical, is seated on the back of a much larger goat, of a type that is generically from the workshop of Riccio (Planiscig 1924, fig. 68). The remains of horns held in the left hands of some of the "in- dependent" examples may have helped to attach these satyr figurines similarly to a nearby goat, or to some other larger complex. Attribution In size, facture, and style this satyr is related to a group of figurines showing Marsyas tethered and awaiting punishment by Apollo that are often found as decorative finials on triangular Paduan bronze inkwells (e.g. National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., Widener Collection, A-134, see Wilson 1983, pp. 73-74). These inkwells have figurines of seated satyrs mounted on their cor- ners. The small figurines are derived from the larger and more detailed figures of satyrs with their hands bound behind their backs that are seated at the four corners of the third tier of Riccio's Paschal Candlestick in Padua (1506-17). The inkwells used to be attributed to Riccio, but are now regarded by some scholars as more probably derivatives by Desiderio da Firenze, who was active in Padua between 1532 and 1545 (Jestaz 1983, p. 51; Leithe-Jasper 1986). Radcliffe (1994, p. 39) regards this as "problematic," sum- marizing "If Desiderio was indeed the author of the perfume burners, it must be supposed that he began to exploit Riccio's style only after the latter's death" (1532). Nevertheless, the thorough study and understanding of anatomy and na- ture-both human and animal-evidenj.in the expressive animation and the modelling of mus- culature tend to sustain the traditional attribu- tion of this particular model to Riccio. 6.

Interpretation The subtle rendering of the chubby facial fea- tures gives a charming expression of joyous laughter. The pointed ears, whose rims seem to be stylized into acanthus leaves, indicate that the figure is subhuman, a faun or satyr. The simple ........ . ..... .............. .~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ .; ....... ... form of the leaves and berries are those of the ivy, and not the grapevine. Attribution This unpublished head is compatible with the work of Riccio. The most convincing stylistic analogies are to be observed by comparison with the similarly sized head of Bacchus as a young boy on the central tier of Riccio's Paschal Candle- stick in Padua (1507-16). Its lively facial features, although set in a pensive rather than a joyful expression, are similar, with the same chubby face, wide nose, eyes set quite widely apart, and a broad forehead framed by the berries of a wreath. Further comparisons with the statuette of Arion (or Orpheus) in the Musee du Louvre (c. 1510), and with the seated Pan in the Ashmolean Mu- seum, Oxford, both of which have their mouths open to sing, reveal clear stylistic and technical affinities with Riccio's work. The subject, fac- ture and patination of the present bust point to an origin in the workshop of Riccio, and the original model may even have been from his hand. It would thus date probably from the sec- ond decade of the sixteenth century. 7.

Most of the detail seems to have been modelled in the wax and has been accurately conveyed into the cast bronze, for not much chasing is readily visible. It has a dark brown patina with traces of black lacquer. 33</page><page sequence="27">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - FALL 1995 Interpretation The subject is a young faun, as is indicated by the nascent horns on his forehead, the pointed ears, and glands at the sides of the neck. The goatskin with which he is draped, and the ram's mask that decorates the front of the base have bacchic connotations, for the maenads would tear wild goats' limbs off and hurl them around in their orgiastic frenzy. The pensive look on the face combined with the angle of the head is perhaps to be interpreted as a look of pa- thos, as though this creature of the woods is wistfully and half-comprehendingly aspiring to be human. Attribution The choice of subject matter and its idyllic in- terpretation are characteristic of Riccio, recalling his bronze statuettes of Arion Play- ing the Lyre (Paris, Musee du Louvre) or Pan Playing His Pipes (Oxford, Ashmolean Museum). The bust is apparently unique. This fact, combined with the quality of its facture and sheer expressiveness, all argue for its proximity to the hand of the mas- ter, or a very close and inspired follower who remains unidentified, rather than simply to the workshop. 8. North Italian, Padua or Venice, c. 1500 Unknown sculptor Miniature Bust of Bacchus Bronze, 3/4 in. (8.2 cm) high Provenance Sotheby's, London, lo December 1987, lot 97 Comparative Literature: Planiscig 1927, p. 222, figs. 252-53, p. 486, nos. 138-39 Condition/Facture Heavily cast in a brassy bronze alloy and retain- ing a natural brown patina, with traces of dark lacquer in the interstices. A hole has been drilled in the center of the front edge, presumably in order to secure the bust to a mount. Interpretation Bacchus is shown wearing a vine tendril tied round his head with a string ending in a ribbon at the nape of his neck. Most of the detail in the luxuriant hair and wreath is worked with a sty- lus in the original wax model, though the face and flesh parts have been carefully smoothed. There is part of a cloak draped over his left shoulder, while a leather strap runs over his bare right shoulder. The unbroken front edge and smoothly concave curved back edge indicate that the head was conceived as a bust and is not a fragment from a statuette. Attribution Though no other cast or variant version of this miniature bust is known, its general appearance and characterization are typical of the bronze foundries of Padua and the Veneto, rather than that of Verrocchio (as was suggested in the 34</page><page sequence="28">RENAISSANCE AND BAROQUE BRONZES FROM THE COLLECTION OF ALEXIS GREGORY .. .. . . .. .. catalogue entry of the sale at which it was purchased). The bust does not appear to reproduce any spe- cific antique prototype, despite its obviously classical subject and conception, but clearly originated from the humanist circle in which Riccio moved in Padua. Similarly small busts of men with long, serious, classical faces (formerly in the Dreyfus collection, Paris, and of Luigi Grassi, Florence) are illustrated by Planiscig. Parallels for the refinement of the handsome, youthful features and the competent and natu- ralistic treatment of the curly hair may be found in the work of Riccio, although the rendering of the eyes, with heavy, sharply defined lids and punched pupils also recalls Severo Calzetta's style. 9.

The color of the alloy is not visible through a brownish black patina, worn to chestnut brown on the high spots, and with dark lacquer in the interstices. Interpretation This is a figure which functioned as an oil lamp; witness the tongue cast within the point of the shell, to accommodate a wick. It may have had a separately cast lid. Attribution This is one of the best-loved functional bronze figures by Severo, judging from the number of surviving examples. Its iconography was meant to remind a humanist patron of an ancient Ro- man relief of putti carrying the attributes of Nep- tune which was located in San Vitale, Ravenna. One of the putti balances an over life-size snail shell on its shoulder in a very similar way (B. Degenhart and A. Schmitt, "Gentile da Fabriano und die Anfange des Antikenstudiums," Munch- ner Jahrbuch der Bildende Kunst, F. III, XI (1960): 59f., no. lo, pI. 76; De Winter 1986, fig. 69). Like 35</page><page sequence="29">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - FALL 1995 most of the other ex- amples, this figure would originally have been se- cured by means of a nut threaded on to a screw projecting downwards from the heel of its weight-bearing leg to a standard triangular tri- pod stand. A complete example from a private collection in Switzerland was exhibited at several locations in 1978 (see Comparative Literature above). A variety of other stan- dard components manu- factured in Severo's prolific workshop could then also have been bolted on near it, for example a sandbox (for blotting wet ink), a candle nozzle (to provide a source of light), or a penholder. An example so encumbered was once in the Miller von Aicholz/ Marquis de Ganay-Ridgway collection (C. Dreyfus in Les Arts 96 (1909): 26,30). .U : .... ::.. :: *; :;....:. . ::: ....i..:: .. ..

The mouth is open in order to receive the wick. The top of the head is modelled as a curly cap of hair with horns on a hinged lid, which cov- ers the hole for replenishing the oil supply. Under the throat a collar spreads into a circu- lar foot. This is pierced below with a screw- threaded hole, by which it would have been attached to a separately cast claw foot, as was often Severo's practice. Interpretation The lamp is formed by distorting an African head into an ovoid shape, through elongating a . .. .. .:.. the chin and making the lower lip protrude. The face looks up at about thirty degrees from the horizontal with wide open, almond-shaped eyes, broad nose, and yawning, triangular mouth. The geometrical stylization of the fea- ..........~~~~~~~~~~~~~........ . tures recalls African sculpture in wood and bronze, which may have been occasionally available via trade routes to the maritime city of Venice. However the curious concept of the lamp is principally owed to ancient Roman lamps in bronze and terracotta (see Planiscig 1927, figs. 175-76). Up the sides of the head run two trails of ber- ried tendrils, perhaps intended for grapevine, the stems of which are crossed and tied at the nape of the neck, beneath the carrying handle. The two little curling horns, together with the real flame that would have been emit- ted from the mouth when the wick was lit, convey a humorously intended, dia- bolical impression. Attribution The facture of this particular lamp and, as far as one can judge from photo- graphs, the small group of similar 37</page><page sequence="31">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - FALL 1995 lamps to which it belongs, as well as Morellian details such as the schematic rendering of the vine leaves, relates it to the oeuvre of Severo, rather than to that of Riccio, which tends to be more refined in the modelling of detail in the wax casting model. As with several other re- lated types of lamps formed from heads with yawning jaws, notably of satyrs and "Green Man" masks, as well as other slightly bizarre subjects, Planiscig's tentative groupings of the 1920S are often still valid, though not under the name of Riccio, but rather of Severo and his workshop. Furthermore, recent discoveries about Severo's oeuvre and the course of his career make it likely that he was the pioneer in inventing these pseudo-antiquities, by copying grotesque but amusing ancient Roman prototypes. Thanks to his newly won technical advances, he could then produce them in sufficient quantities to satisfy the demands of his humanist patrons for domestic artifacts that they could actually have on their desks and use, without feelings of guilt about endangering rare and valuable, ancient originals. There is no evidence that they were made to deceive. ii. North Italian, Padua, early 16th century Workshop of SEVERO CALZETTA DA RAVENNA (active 1495-1525) Sea Monster ("Dragon") Bronze, 3 x 7 in.

The leaves sprouting behind the "forelegs" are free variants of the fins found on other versions of this model. Mantegna's en- gravings of the Battles of the Sea Gods (1485- 88) served as the inspiration for this type of sea monster or dragon. The wildness of the beast, expressed in the thrown back head with gaping mouth and the tightly curled, thrash- ing tail, can only be fully comprehended if it is seen in context with a figure of Neptune attached to its back and attempting to tame it, as is the case in many other examples. The group then has a narrative significance, sym- bolizing the dominance of divine power over untamed nature. Attribution This is a good example of the middle quality of production from Severo's prolific workshop. The model is a smaller variant of one of the few au- tograph works by Severo, a sea monster of ex- ceptional quality, but on which the figure of Neptune has been replaced by a shell-shaped inkwell. This is signed on the mounting "O. SEVERI. RA." (Collection of Mr. Anthony Blumka, New York). The existence of a great number and variety of this model indicates that it was one of the most popular and long-lived types offered for sale by Severo and his work- shop. Avery and Radcliffe suggest a date within the first years of the sixteenth century for the signed master-model. 39</page><page sequence="33">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - FALL 1995 12.

The core was removed through the open mouth, so that the interior could serve as a receptacle, perhaps with a liner, for ink. Traces of joints between the pieces of a mold may be remarked running along the sides of the body and under the belly. Several of the toes are broken off. A brown patina, with darker lacquer in the inter- stices covers the creature, approximating re- markably well the muddy color of a live toad. Underneath there are traces of considerable wear, which attests to the age, and therefore au- thenticity, of the piece. There are two iron core pins at either side of the underbelly, (one of which can be felt inside), and possibly under the front feet. There is a blob of lead under the chest, perhaps to fill a hole left by a core pin that has been extracted or rusted away, which thus made the receptacle leak. Interpretation This is an example of so-called casting from nature, though it is not clear how this was ef- fected with animals other than crustaceans, snails, lizards, etc., which have hard shells, cara- paces, or skins. Possibly a toad could be stuffed, so that its skin would then be resistant enough for molds to be taken from it in plaster. Such a process might have been derived from that used to record anatomical dissections in three dimen- sions using wax or plaster. Leithe-Jasper writes on the history of this technical byway: "The Ital- ian tradition of casting from nature went back to Cennino Cennini in the fourteenth century and was a conscious imitation of antique prac- tice. It flourished especially in Padua, the center 40</page><page sequence="34">RENAISSANCE AND BAROQUE BRONZES FROM THE COLLECTION OF ALEXIS GREGORY of scientific studies around 1500, whence it spread to Germany and France: there its chief exponents in the second half of the sixteenth century were the goldsmith Wentzel Jamnitzer in Nuremberg and the potter Bernard Palissy in Paris." To this it may be added that it was prob- ably also used by the Vischer family foundry in Nuremberg in the earlier part of the sixteenth century, as well as by Casper Gras in Innsbruck a century or so later. Attribution This toad is virtually identical with one in Vienna, whose age-and thus authenticity-is attested by the fact that it has descended directly from the collection of the Habsburg Archduke Leopold Wilhelm. It first featured in an inven- tory of 1659 as no. 537: "Ein Krott von Metall mit offenen Rachen" (a toad of metal with open jaws), and was qualified in another inventory taken in 1750 as "so wohl gegossen" (so well cast). A second example, formerly in Vienna, was sold as being a duplicate in 1923. There is no reason for the attribution of this model, or of other, similar, supposed casts from nature, to Riccio or his workshop, as has been traditional since Bode's day. A cast from nature, by definition, does not convey any stylistic data that would permit it to be connected with a par- ticular artist, or indeed with a particular coun- try of origin. The majority of authentic-looking examples do, nevertheless, exhibit Paduan char- acteristics in their casting and patination. They are likely to have been reproduced in a work- shop that was geared towards virtual mass pro- duction, such as those of Severo or Desiderio da Firenze. 13. North Italian, Padua, first quarter of the 16th century Unknown sculptor from the circle of Riccio Rearing Horse Bronze, 73/4 in. (19.7 cm) high Provenance Adrian Ward-Jackson; Cyril Humphris (1994) Comparative Literature Camins 1981, pp. 24-26, 98-99, ref. 42 Condition/Facture The horse is a thick-walled cast in coppery bronze alloy. It was carefully modelled in the preliminary casting wax and did not need much afterworking. The metallic surface has patinated to a chocolate brown color, except where it is still covered with traces of a dark lacquer. It has a homogeneous treatment of surface, without too much differentiation of detail, and this con- veys a feeling of sculptural monumentality that bespeaks a gifted artist. *: ;: . .. - - o~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~..... *: :: :.. .: .? - - ~~~~~. .... ... .... .. . .. : Interpretation The concept of a freestanding rearing horse (in- stead of a walking one, which would be techni- cally much easier) for a monument emerged 41</page><page sequence="35">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - FALL 1995 during the last quarter of the fifteenth century, with a commission from Galeazzo Maria Sforza, the duke of Milan, for a monument to his fa- ther, around 1473. It appears that Antonio Pollaiuolo was approached, and produced a couple of drawings (Munich, and New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Robert Lehman Collection: see Camins 1981, ref. 42), but the project lapsed. It was revived in 1482 by Lodovico il Moro Sforza, when he obtained the services of the young Leonardo da Vinci, fresh from working in Verrocchio's Florentine workshop on the model for the bronze statue of Colleoni on a walking steed that was destined for Venice. Fol- lowing Pollaiuolo's bold though impractical projects, Leonardo made several studies, most now in the Royal Library at Windsor Castle, for a monument with a rearing horse. In them he was influenced by the only existing statues of rearing horses from antiquity that he knew, those being restrained by the Horse Tam- ers, that are now on the Piazza del Quirinale, Rome. They had already inspired Bertaldo, the Florentine sculptor of small bronzes, to emu- late them on a small scale with his group of Bellerophon and Pegasus dating from around 1480 (Vienna, Kunsthistorisches Museum: Leithe-Jasper, 1986, no. 2). This group was re- corded in Padua by the early years of the six- teenth century, and may have been there since Bertoldo had been in Padua in 1483. Thus it could have influenced sculptors of the local school. The joint influence of two great Florentine artists seems therefore to have inspired the creator of the present small model to attempt the techni- cal challenge presented by the rearing posture, where the weight of the horse rests on only its hind legs and its center of balance has to be care- fully contrived so that it stands up well. Attribution In the absence of any directly comparable model and therefore of any received scholarly opinion, the authorship is hard to determine. The relatively straightforward rearing pose and the only slight turn of the head are consonant with a model expecting a rider, which could have been fashioned separately and affixed mechanically to the back. It does not appear to be consistent with what we know of Severo da Ravenna's or Riccio's personal renderings of the horse, and further research will be necessary to establish more closely its origin. It remains an extremely interesting model on account of its apparently early, and very convincing, ren- dition of the tricky, rearing pose, which still challenged sculptors of a century later, like Giambologna, Pietro Tacca, and Fanelli (com- pare cat. no. 42). 14, 15.

F622) Condition/Facture Each candlestick is modelled with a spreading circular base from which rises a baluster shaped stem with a nozzle above. The whole surface is heavily ornamented in crisply modelled relief, recording the richness of the original clay and wax model. The rim of the nozzle, the upper surface of the knop and the extruded flange round the base bear the frieze of little pointed and veined leaves that are a hallmark of the foundry. Around the underside of the knop are "Green Man" masks connected by swags of foli- age, while in the concavity round the upper flange of the base are acanthus leaves. Under this are grotesque horned satyr masks, then a spiral- ing rinceau of leaves, and finally round the lower rim there runs an ovolo molding. Inside the hollow casting of the base are traces of turning on a lathe, in the wax casting model rather than in the cast bronze itself. The nozzle and base are connected by a threaded iron bolt secured below by a wing nut. Interpretation This type of candlestick has gradually been established by twentieth century scholars as the work of a Brescian foundry run by Gaspare di Gerolamo Macri in the middle of the six- teenth century. The first step in the process of identification was taken by Planiscig in 1932, when he published a cognate, though more elaborate, candle- stick with tiny satyrs acting as caryatids round the stem, that is now in the Museo Poldi Pezzoli, Milan (Radcliffe, 1984, pls. 28-29). This has cast inside in relief the name GASPAR and the date MCLI (evidently in error for MDLI = 1551). Planiscig associated it with candlesticks of the present sort and with a particular type of small oil lamp bearing the same leaf moldings, and assigned the whole group on grounds of gen- eral appearance, facture and style to Venice or Padua. Radcliffe has since proved that these artifacts are more likely to have been produced in Brescia, a city with a traditional industry of casting bronze, and that the foundryman "Gaspar" may in all probability be identified with one documented there in 1548 and 1549, whose full name is given as Gaspare di Gerolamo Macri. Radcliffe (1984, pl. 30) also added an incisively cast little bell in the Victoria and Albert Museum (M.28-1923) to the group, as well as a bell produced for the Brescian College of Jurists. This last bell, dated 1589 (Museo del Castello Sforzesco, Milan), might either be by Gaspare at the end of a long- ish career, or by a successor, whether related to him or not. 43</page><page sequence="37">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - FALL 1995 A mortar (13 cm. high) from the Robert Strauss collection bearing the arms of Graziani of Udine (sold Christie's, London, 3 May 1977, lot 57) also has just under its lip the characteristic frieze of pointed, serrated and veined overlap- ping leaves, and so may legitimately be added to the steadily expanding oeuvre of this foundry. 16. North Italian, Venice, late 16th century Attributed to ANDREA BRESCIANO (called IL BRESCIANINO, 1530-1569) Recumbent Sphinx Bronze, ii in. (28 cm) long Provenance Peter Bader Works of Art, Zurich Comparative Literature Planiscig 1921, p. 515, pl. 558; Ciechanowiecki 1972, no. 37; Davis 1976, pp. 163-67; Davis 1989, pp. 271-79, 286-87, n. 46, 73, 74 Condition/Facture The bronze is heavily cast and open underneath and behind the head, while there is a slot run- ning centrally along the back. The latter features, as well as the pronounced upward turn of the face, suggest that this was an ornamental foot, probably for a firedog, with functional parts in cast or wrought iron being attached behind, to carry the logs for the fire. These have since been removed for aesthetic reasons. It probably had an identical pair. The dark, blackish patina is normal on such items associated with the ash and soot of a fireplace. Interpretation The sphinx, an ancient Egyptian mythical fig- ure, was also familiar to the Greeks and Romans as "a monster which had the head and breasts of a woman, the body of a dog, the tail of a ser- pent, the wings of a bird, the paws of a lion, and a human voice" (Lempriere's Classical Dictionary, pp. 577-78). These curious attributes expressed cruelty, lasciviousness, etc. The most prominent introduction of the beast into the Renaissance sculptural iconography is its use for the four feet of Riccio's Paschal Candelstick in the Basilica of Saint Anthony, Padua, modelled in the first and second decades of the sixteenth century (Planiscig 1921, p. ii6, pl. 121). It also featured in a well-known type of Paduan oil lamp, the best examples of which are held to be by Riccio, as well as on a number of other items from his workshop. Attribution Following the prominent example of the Pas- chal Candelstick, other sculptors employed sphinxes to the same end, and they feature on a similar candelabrum in Santa Maria della Sa- lute (originally made for the abandoned church of Santo Spirito), Venice. It is signed "AND. DI 44</page><page sequence="38">RENAISSANCE AND BAROQUE BRONZES FROM THE COLLECTION OF ALEXIS GREGORY ALESS. BRES. F. and turns out to have been executed by an expert foundryman who cast various models by Jacopo Sansovino and Alessandro Vittoria (e.g. Saint Sebastian, Met- ropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 1566), among others, before his premature death in Rome in 1569. Indeed, taken in conjunction with other factors, the inclusion of this sort of sphinx in a bronze work of this general period is often taken as a sign of the involvement of this par- ticular foundryman. It has been used, very con- vincingly, to connect the Andrea Baruzzi foundry with two different imposing bronze crucifixes, one inscribed and dated 1567 from the Scuola di San Teodoro (now in the Gallery of the Accademia, Venice) and the other exhibited by the Heim Gallery, London, in 1972. The present sphinx corresponds well with those round the base of the candelabrum in Santa Maria della Salute, in its provocatively project- ing breasts, in the upward turn of the head to meet a spectator's gaze, and the care with which the feathering of the wings and the shaggy hair behind the leonine legs are rendered. The Moorish features are probably derived from those depicted on one type of oil lamp from the workshop of Severo Calzetta (cat. no. io). Brescianino is recorded as having produced such firedogs, and this may be part of one. 17, 18.

Underneath they bear the painted inventory numbers of the Beit Collec- tion, 269, 270 [recognized by Cyril Humphris]. Interpretation Tritons are sea monsters of ancient mythology who accompany the god Neptune who reigns over the sea. Unlike the mermen and mermaids of northern European myth, they have two bi- furcating fishy tails, rather than a single one. Attribution Bode described the tritons simply as the work of an unknown Venetian artist of the sixteenth century, and Planiscig's subsequent ascription to the workshop of Roccatagliata does not have any strong grounds. Following him, Camins places them in the first quarter of the seven- teenth century. In fact, there has been no sig- nificant evidence adduced since Bode's day to situate the models more precisely within that ambient of bronze casting, in which many such attractive artifacts were serially produced for use about the house. Camins usefully observes (giving references) that "They perhaps derive from an antique re- lief (now in the Museo Archeologico, Venice) in the Statuaro Pubblico of the Libreria Marciana, bequeathed to the Venetian Repub- lic in 1593." If so, this of course predicates a date of origin very late in the century, or early in the following one. 19, 20.

There are irregular flaws, notably in the baby satyrs crouching be- low. A number of tiny, open pinholes record where core pins have been removed. They have a black patina, with chestnut brown on rubbed high spots. The modelling is nearly all cast from the wax models, with a minimum of after- working. The integrally cast stands add consid- erably to the substance of the statuettes and would have permitted the mounting of the rela- tively small figures on large firedogs. There is an honest, "chunky" character to the rectilinear folds of drapery and the ornamental swags and masks, as well as to the baby satyrs 46</page><page sequence="40">RENAISSANCE AND BAROQUE BRONZES FROM THE COLLECTION OF ALEXIS GREGORY crouching on the volutes below. They do not ex- hibit the exaggeratedly refined and finicky finish of some examples of the Judith, which are now regarded as eighteenth century elaborations, from the generation of Morlaiter (Camins 1988). Interpretation The concept of a contrapuntal pair of male/ female and mythological/biblical subjects of beheadings is derived from the pairing in the Loggia dei Lanzi in Florence of Donatello's monumental Judith and Holofernes (1450s) with Cellini's group of Perseus and Medusa (1554). Attribution The attribution of the basic model of Judith to Aspetti, based on a comparison with his larger signed bronze statuettes of Temperance and Char- ity of 1593-1603 on the balustrade of the high al- tar of the Basilica of Saint Anthony at Padua (Planiscig 1921; Schottmuller 1922), has survived the test of time without serious challenge. A further sensible suggestion by Planiscig that the figure of Mercury was conceived as a pair to that of Judith is corroborated by the present pairing (among others). The heavily lidded eyes and open mouths, their corners indented with a stylus, also serve to associate these figures with work on a smaller scale that is generally sup- posed to be by Tiziano Aspetti. Presumably the compositions date from around the turn of the century, probably from before Aspetti's departure for Pisa and Florence in 1599. 21.

These are the traces of core pins, which instead of being removed and the holes patched, have been left in place. Over time their tops have, with depos- ited moisture, rusted down to a level below that of the surrounding surface. The detail is all modelled in the original wax and carefully cast, not chased in. Interpretation This is a standard interpre- tation of Marine Venus with her symbolic dolphin beside her, supporting her relaxed right leg, while her robe billows out behind. a; The robe serves to fill the gap between her ankles and the dolphin and thus reinforces the casting at what would otherwise have been a weak point. Attribution The statuette replicates the dimensions and pose of Aspetti's figure of Judith with the Head of Holofernes, while its sinuous, windswept swathe of drapery is in reverse to that of the Mercury with the Head of Argus (cat. nos. 19, 20). Apart from this, the main reason for attributing this figure to Aspetti is the cleverly stylized treatment of facial features, especially the heavy upper eyelids, and the pupils and the mouth cavity the corners of which are poked into the wax model with a sty- lus. The statuette is of better than average quality and was perhaps intended for mounting on the roof line of a cabinet, with a pair, or as part of a series of similar mythological figures, as was stan- dard practice in Venetian furniture of the period. Two similar, though larger (38 cm high) statu- ettes that are close in composition, apart from the absence of the swathe of drapery, are to be found in the collection descended from the Farnese dukes of Parma that is now in Naples. They are currently described as "after Aspetti." Actually, the model is derived from a slightly larger bronze Marine Venus, probably byAspetti's mentor, Campagna, judging from the existence of a cast initialed "I.C.," that is usually presumed to stand for leronimus (i.e. Girolamo) Campagna (Adda collection, sold Paris, Palais Galliera, 30 November-i December 1965, lot 412). There is a similarly posed statuette of Venus, but with cu- pid and not a dolphin at her side, in Ferrara, there attributed to Campagna (Varese 1975). 22.

It stands on an integrally cast tri- angular stand with concave sides, which would have served to fit it to a standard type of fire- dog, of which several examples are to be found. Interpretation God of fire in ancient mythology, Vulcan was begotten by Juno alone, and was patron of all artists who worked iron and other metals. His forges were supposed to be blazing beneath Mount Aetna in Sicily, as well as beneath all other volcanoes (phenomena that are named after him). His most famous works were making the thunderbolts for Jupiter and, at the behest of Venus, the armor of Mars, god of war. In Re- naissance sculpture, therefore, he is found paired with Venus or Mars, while his presence near a real fire was appropriate. Attribution Planiscig pointed out the close relationship between the curving pose with tense muscu- lature of this and some related bronze statu- ettes, and the left one of a pair of caryatid fig- ures in marble that flank a fireplace in the Sala dell'Anticollegio in the Doge's Palace in Venice (Planisicig, 1921, fig. 613). A relief of 1589 over the fireplace depicts the forge of Vulcan, and bears Aspetti's initials, T(iziano.) A(spetti.) P(atavinus.) F(ecit.), thus foreshadowing the choice of subject for a firedog finial (Timofiewitsch, fig. 60). The bronze shares the same type of face as the caryatid, with its pro- nounced eyebrows and eyelids, pointed nose, mustache and goatee beard. The figures are arranged in contrapposto, with their right knees and left shoulders foremost, but are then so ponderated that they lean backwards and sideways slightly, the caryatid to bear the weight of the mantelpiece and the statuette, as though Vulcan is withdrawing his right arm with its hammer, in readiness to bring his hammer swinging forward and down on to the imagined anvil. In- deed, in the prime version published by Planiscig the base is not plain, as in the present example, but has lying on it a small anvil to the right and a helmet to the left, so that one is left in no doubt that Vulcan is shown forging the armor of Mars. This is corroborated by the-apparently unique-pairing with a figure of Mars, who is nude, but with a (missing) sword in his right hand, and to judge from the illus- tration in Planiscig (fig. 617), with some 49</page><page sequence="43">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - FALL 1995 items of armor, possibly a cuirass, on the ground below. The figures are not a matched pair in mirror image one of the other, for both sway in the same direction, which is unusual, though far from unique, in these typical Vene- tian pairs of figures for firedog finials. The back view of the statuette is particularly strong, animated as it is by smoothly rippling, athletic musculature, which catches the light on its protrusions. Figures close to this appear in Aspetti's two reliefs with miracles of Saint Anthony of Padua, now in the Metropolitan Museum (see Raggio 1981; Camins 1988, p. 57). This Vulcan usually is paired with a Venus Ma- rina that appears to be based on a model by Girolamo Campagna, reduced from his statue of her on the balustrade of the Libreria in Venice of 1588. 23.

Though modelled in the round, its back and oval base are flattened, with the folds of the robe only sum- marily indicated. Down the saint's left thigh and leg are three evenly spaced pits, which may be traces of core pins, and there is a pair of larger symmetrical round patches to either side of the vertical flange of the base. There is also an open flaw hole to the interior below the left hand cover of the gospel book. The details are mostly cast in, though they may have been fresh- ened with chisels and rasps. Interpretation Saint Mark is the pa- tron saint of the city and former republic of Venice. This statu- ette of the Evangelist was probably con- ceived as one of a pair of figures, or of a standard set of four. He stands in rapture, as indicated by the gesture of his right hand, lightly pressing his breast. He does not hold a quill pen or other writing equipment. 50</page><page sequence="44">RENAISSANCE AND BAROQUE BRONZES FROM THE COLLECTION OF ALEXIS GREGORY The winged lion looks upward, its ferocity quelled by its master's benign and calm demeanor. Attribution In the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna (inv. no. 7202), there is a statuette of Saint Luke the Evangelist which was attributed by Planiscig with some justification to Aspetti, owing to its stylistic links with his model of Judith with the Head of Holofernes, but it has a more sinuous, swinging movement and a more open silhou- ette than the present figure. Indeed the block- like frontality of this Saint Mark is more suggestive of the format of a marble statue, per- haps because the figure was destined to stand against a wall, or in a niche, so that side and back views would have been of little importance. Similar features are to be noted in a statuette of Saint Mark and his lion in the Correr Museum, Venice, though it is differently ponderated and stands on an ornate pedestal. Once in the church of Sant'Apollinare, Venice, it has been loosely connected with Girolamo Campagna, mostly on the grounds of generic stylistic similarities with his oeuvre. The present figure is also similar to another statuette depicting Saint Andrew that is actually dated 16o8, and this provides a valu- able clue as the possible dating of the present statuette. The head and mane of the lion were incisively modelled in the original wax model with a sty- lus. It is of a distinctive type that is known from various door knockers which are normally at- tributed, with some justification, to Aspetti (Planiscig 1921, figs. 632-33, 635; and this cata- logue, no. 25). The continuous, but gently zig- zagging line of its brows and a wrinkle across its nose connect it with the independent model of a Lion "Passant Gardant" in this collection (cat. no. 24). If not brothers, these lions are cousins, and the models for them may therefore have originated from the same imagination and hand, even though the casts are treated slightly differ- ently by the various practitioners in the bronze foundry. Much more research and painstaking connoisseurship are required before these large groups of vaguely similar artifacts can be as- signed with any degree of confidence to particu- lar masters or workshops. 24.

It has a brown patina, lighter in color where it has been handled or polished. The details are mostly cast in from the wax model, where they were freshened up with a sty- lus, and there is little trace of afterworking. Interpretation This type of ferocious, snarling lion, with dis- tinctively large paws and heavy, rather than lithe, musculature is inspired by representa- tions of the thirteenth and fourteenth cent- uries,which are in turn ultimately derived from antique prototypes: the sarcophagus with a Lion Hunt in the Palazzo Rospigliosi in Rome, and innumerable variants cut on cameos. The lion generally stands as a symbol of ferocity and strength (fortitudo), attributes that it shares with Mars, god of war. The present model is sometimes found paired with a lioness in har- ness (e.g. London, formerly Strauss collection, see above), but they do not make a totally sat- isfactory, conventional facing pair, for both their heads are turned in the same, instead of in the opposite, direction. When the female is found on her own, she has usually been as- sumed to have an association with Bacchus, perhaps on account of the harness she wears, and has therefore been described as a leopard- ess or female panther, such as traditionally were supposed to have drawn his chariot. Attribution This Lion and the accompanying Lioness exist in a fair number of examples, with insignificant variations in detail or facture. Hitherto no con- sensus of opinion has been reached as to where and when the models originated, though they have normally been dated before the middle of the sixteenth century. This is probably because of their seemingly archaic appearance, particu- larly of the female feline which may indeed have originated then, and the rather rough facture of some examples. Bode initially (1907) regarded the cast of the composition in Berlin as dating from the Quattrocento, but later (1930) followed Gold- schmidt's suggestion (1914) that it is from North- ern Italy, c. 1550. Draper has more recently (1980) suggested that the model is "possibly Northern Italian, 17th century." Indeed, in the context of the present collection, it emerges that the fac- ture and modeling with a stylus on the Lion dis- tinctly recall the work of Tiziano Aspetti on bronzes such as the Saint Mark and the Door Knocker (cat. nos. 23, 25). If this analogy is valid, the Lion (and possibly the Lioness) must indeed be half a century later than used normally to be assumed (as suggested by Goldschmidt and 52</page><page sequence="46">RENAISSANCE AND BAROQUE BRONZES FROM THE COLLECTION OF ALEXIS GREGORY Anonymous, Italian (Venetian), second half of the 16th century. Ewer. Copper and bronze. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Purchase, Rogers Fund, 1953. Bode), though perhaps not quite as late as pro- posed by Draper. Linked to this group of leonine subjects perhaps associable with Aspetti is the bronze lion ram- pant that serves as the handle for a large ewer in the Metropolitan Museum of Art (Rogers Fund 1953; inv. no. 53.209). It has a similar face with the zigzag stylization of the brows and wrinkle of the nose, while its tail is curled against and therefore cast with its left hind leg as in the present case. The dragon spout projecting from a larger satyr's mask (with horns and goat ears) set against the convex body of the ewer might also follow the lion handle into the oeuvre of Aspetti, and it finds some parallels in the orna- mentation of his door knockers. 25.

This is rubbed off on the high spots to reveal a natu- ral chestnut brown patina. An iron hammer is cast into the base of its reverse side, to strike on a buffer set into the door, and there is a hinge for attachment above. The scrolling cartouche of strapwork around the blank oval shield in- tended for a coat of arms or an inscription is partly broken off above, making the knocker about an inch less high than it would originally have been, and less than other related examples (e.g. Palazzo Venezia, Rome: 39.5 cm; Christie's, London: 40.5 cm). 53</page><page sequence="47">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - FALL 1995 Interpretation According to Jeannine O'Grody (written com- munication), the elderly, bearded, and lightly clad man in the center is probably to be identi- fied as the first hermit, Paul. According to the Golden Legend, when Paul died in the desert at the age of ninety, two lions dug his grave, as his companion, Anthony, lacked the strength for the task. Attribution The knocker belongs to a quite common Vene- tian type that is shaped like a lyre, formed out of two addorsed scrolling volutes, lashed to- gether at the top, near the hinge. A pair of li- ons are arranged head down to either side, flanking a central figure, sometimes half-length and sometimes full. The lions' paws rest on a grip below that is often cast in the form of a cockle shell, or, as here, in the form of a pro- jecting volute veined inside like a leaf. The identity of the central figure varies. On a particularly fine example formerly in the Pierpont Morgan collection (Planiscig 1921, fig. 632), a draped female figure representing Venice herself is closely derived from the Judith by Aspetti (see cat. no. 19). This forms the basis for the standard attribution of this class of knockers to his workshop. Interestingly enough, this inference has been corroborated by the recent publication of another knocker in Prague, where the central figure retains the essential attribute of Judith, the severed head of Holofernes lying on the ground below, as in Aspetti's statuette (Chlibec 1992, no. 23). More frequently the central figure is a more or less nude man: Mars or Saint George wearing ar- mor in the all'antica style on an example in the Museo Civico, Turin (Pettorelli 1926); Neptune with his trident-a design adapted shamelessly from a superior and also much reproduced fig- ure by Alessandro Vittoria (e.g. Fogg Art Mu- seum, 1953.41)-on the knocker in Palazzo Venezia and in Korcula; Hercules with his knot- ted club on the example sold at Christie's; and a different Hercules/Mars on an example for- merly in Berlin (Bode 1930, no. 259: inv. no 5025). Interestingly enough, the last design is recorded in a watercolor from an album show- Alessandro Vittoria (1525- 1608). Neptune with Sea Horses (Door Knocker).

It is captioned as hav- ing been on the portal of the Palazzo Longhi ai Servi on the Rio della Sensa. Other central motifs also appear: a putto holding aloft a bunch of grapes on those in Krefeld and Rotterdam, and Cupid astride an eagle, that stands on a grotesque mask (Christie's, Lon- don, 6 December 1988, lot 179). The prowling lions that flank the figures, while differing in detail and in the minutiae of chas- ing, all reflect the same concept of the king of the beasts, as do those to be found elsewhere among images in bronze that are associated with Tiziano Aspetti (cat. nos. 19, 20). 26, 27. North Italian, Venice, late 16th century In the style of TIZIANO ASPETTI (C. 1559-1606) Two Doorknobs in the Form of Turkeys Bronze, 53/4 x 3/4 in. (14.5 x 8.2 cm) Provenance Germain Seligman Collection; Christie's, Lon- don, 6 December 1988, lot 180; Cyril Humphris, London Comparative Literature Planiscig 1924, nos. 194-95; Richardson, n.d., no. 114 (attributed to Giambologna); (on the tur- key: Moller 1981, pp. 313-40) Condition/Facture The doorknobs are hollow-cast in a brassy bronze alloy and both have flaws in the turkey's head or neck. They are direct castings from the same molds. They have a reddish patina on the worn high spots, but elsewhere are covered with a blackish lacquer. Interpretation The two turkeys are flat behind and so could have been applied directly against the outsides of doors to serve as knobs, the space between their fanned-out tails and their necks serving to admit the fingers of anyone who wished to pull the doors open. They are not a facing pair, but identical in the turn of their head, to the viewer's right, and in which claw is raised. The facture, function, and patination are typical of Venetian bronze foundries in the latter part of the six- teenth century. The turkey ( Gallus Indicus) was introduced into Europe through Spain only in the year 1520, and was highly regarded as a novelty because of its brilliant plumage, exotic appearance, and edibil- ity. By 1531 it was known in Nuremburg under the German epithet" indischen han" (Indianische 55</page><page sequence="49">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - FALL 1995 Hahn). In the 1540S it appeared in France under the name coq d'Inde and in England as a turkey. Such was its popularity as a deluxe dish that by 1557 the Great Council in Venice saw fit to pass a sumptuary law, strictly regulating when and where the culinary luxury called gallinaccio indiano was permitted to be served (Rodiczky, Monographie des Truthahns (Vienna, 1882). The curious fowl soon began to feature, owing to its bizarre novelty, in bestiaries (Conrad Gesner, Historia animalium, 1551-57) and in several engravings from the School of Fontainebleau; even in the border of one of Boyvin's engravings of the Story ofJason (Moller 1981, pl. 3). By 1558 the turkey had become asso- ciated with the iconography of Envy (invidia), featuring, for example, in Pieter Bruegel the Elder's design for an engraving of an allegory of this one of The Seven Deadly Sins, published in Antwerp (Moller 1981, pl. 5). Stupidity, Igno- rance, and Anger were soon added to the unfor- tunate bird's symbolic associations. Some two decades later the glamorous, exotic bird featured in a fresco cycle painted by Jacopo Zucchi (1576-77) in the Pavilion (Padiglione) of Cardinal Ferdinando de' Medici, later grand duke of Tuscany (L'Accademia di Francia a Roma, Villa Medici, Rome, 1991, pp. 16-17). Seen through a wooden trellis, it is shown in its char- acteristic profile view with its colorful tail feathers displayed and perched-rather improb- ably-in the branches of a tree with other birds. Attribution The closest analogy for the rough, "impression- istic" rendering of the feathers is to be found on birds associated with mythological figures such as Jupiter and Juno, respectively the eagle and the peacock, produced by several members of the Venetian school of bronze sculpture, nota- bly the workshop of Alessandro Vittoria. There may also be a trace of influence from Tuscany, from the life-size and vivacious rendering of a turkey, referred to at the time as a portrait, that was cast in bronze by Giambologna in 1567, to adorn the grotto of the Medicean villa of II Castello (Avery 1987, pp. 154-55, pl. 158, p. 267, cat. no. 123). The involvement of several different Venetian foundries in the manufacture of such decora- tive fittings and artifacts, primarily for the navy, and then for domestic consumption, remains to be documented. Yet the freedom of modelling and spontaneity that it conveys, combined with a degree of caricature, is not inconsistent with what is at present regarded as the approach of Tiziano Aspetti. 28.

The 56</page><page sequence="50">RENAISSANCE AND BAROQUE BRONZES FROM THE COLLECTION OF ALEXIS GREGORY relief seems to have been cast from a mold using a thin layer of wax pressed in, the back then being filled with the white plas- ter investment that would have covered the front too, but has there been cleaned off. There is virtually no chasing of detail, but the figure has a lively, vi- brant effect derived from the nervous folds and windswept drapery pressed against the body. It manifests a curious device of Christ's head physi- cally rising from the veil of Saint Veronica, on which, ac- cording to the gospel story, it only left a flat imprint. Interpretation The lack of finish and hollow back indicate that this figure was part of an altar or tabernacle com- plex, probably well above eye level and so not readily visible. It would have stood with a series of angels holding other Instruments of the Pas- sion (compare cat. nos. 30, 31). Attribution The speedy, "jagged" modelling of the fluttering drapery recalls the late style of Aspetti, as it manifests itself in the two large and impressive reliefs of scenes from the life of Saint Daniel, that he cast in 1592-93 for the Basilica of Saint Anthony in Padua (now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York). However, the dis- parity in scale precludes a close association, and the attribution remains conjectural at present. 29.

The author draws a comparison with the bronze figure of Saint George in San Giorgio Maggiore, Venice (Planiscig 1921, p. 599) citing "the fine facial features, the working of the armor, in particular the tas- sels and the fringe on the skirt and cloak, and the treatment of the sandals" of the pre- sentwork. The author continues, "Rocca- tagliata agreed to make the bronze of Saint George and a bronze figure of Saint Stephen on 31 January 1593 for the recently completed choir of the Benedictine church 57</page><page sequence="51">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - FALL 1995 of San Giorgio Maggiore (Exh, cat. 1983, no. S27). The close similarity of these bronzes with the bronze of a Roman emperor suggests that it dates from this period of his work." The subject is perhaps more likely, on account of its full armor, not to be a Roman emperor, but rather Mars (conceivably paired on a cabi- net with a matching statuette of Venus) or Saint George, a popular saint in Venice. Perhaps it was removed from a shrine. Its remarkably high quality sets it apart from the general run of Venetian bronze statuettes, and it may have been chased by a trained goldsmith. 30, 31.

In fact, the models for these two statu- ettes originally belonged to a series of putti hold- ing the 'Instruments of the Passion, several of which are known. They were altered at the stage of the wax casting models into secular images, by the removal of their wings and various other at- tributes that were too distinctly and painfully re- ligious, for example a whip in the raised hand of the putto with the column. The bundle of fasces is a reinterpretation of the vertical of a full cross, which is normal to find among the Instruments of the Passion, just as the standard crown of thorns has been visually softened by the addition of flowers. These alterations were made to ren- der the statuettes less obviously religious, and hence more salable to secular-minded collectors. In their present form they may be interpreted as representations of fortitude or constancy (the column), justice or conjugal unity (fasces), and victory or triumph in love (wreath). As such they might have decorated a cabinet that would have served as an appropriate marriage gift. Attribution Several series of-in most cases larger-putti holding the Instruments of the Passion are documented in Venetian churches (or in col- lections derived from them). They are generi- cally associated with the innumerable putti that constitute a vital element of some decorative and utilitarian bronzes in the church of San Giorgio Maggiore in Venice, which were com- missioned from Roccatagliata between 1594 and 1596. The same type of putti reappear on Niccolo Roccatagliata's masterpiece (Planiscig, 1921, fig. 703), the great altar frontal now in the Sacristy of San Moise in Venice, signed and dated 1633. It provides a stylistic and typological touchstone for the attribution of a whole range of other, undocumented, bronze statuettes to him. 32, 33.

Interpretation The heads protrude from delightfully modelled cartouches formed of typically Venetian strap- work, its curly ends alternating with vaguely floral motifs. Such knobs were mounted as handles on doors or drawers on small pieces of furniture, such as cabinets, that had no locks and therefore no keys by which they could be conveniently pulled open. Attribution These doorknobs are very handsome examples of a well-known and widely used class of furni- ture mount; they are reduced in scale from stan- dard doorknobs for household doors. Many of these are attributed generically to the workshops of Roccatagliata, although the "chicken-lidded" eyes of the present ones also feature in the oeuvre of ornamental bronzes associated with the work- shop of Tiziano Aspetti. Such bronzes do not lend themselves to precise attribution by stylistic criteria, like statuettes, for they are part of a repertory that was widely dif- fused, where elements originating in different studios were freely combined and varied upon. 36. North Italian, Verona, late 16th century Attributed to GIUSEPPE DE LEVIS (1552-1611/14) Putto with a Cornucopia Bronze, 7 in.

There are open flaws on the upper back, outer side of left knee, and below the left knee, into the base. A hand-cut, conical screw, integrally cast, projects down- wards to affix the finial to its context, perhaps an upright of a piece of wooden furniture, such as a throne. It has a chestnut brown patina. Interpretation The little boy bends pronouncedly to his right as he heaves up the laden cornucopia to his left. The statuette would almost certainly have had a matching pair leaning strongly in the oppo- 61</page><page sequence="55">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - FALL 1995 site direction, or else a series of corresponding figures. The bowl-like base would have made the figure stand proud of whatever it was mounted on, for the sake of display. It is an unusual feature and characteristic of the de Levis foundry. Attribution The style and typology are those traditionally and generically associ- ated with the name of Roccatagliata, though an anonymous piece such ......... as this might logically _*k be connected with the oeuvre of Giuseppe de Levis of Verona. The fact of the matter is that, in the absence of copyright X laws, any foundry was able to reproduce such figures ad lib, and any attempt at an exact attri- bution is not likely to succeed in convincing all critics. Recent inten- sive studies of the signed work produced by the bronze founder Giuseppe de Levis and his relatives in Verona around the turn of the sixteenth cen- tury serve to demonstrate that he freely adapted from various sources among the Venetian workshops, possibly by a simple process of tak- ing molds off existing bronzes (after-casting or surmoulage) and then adapting the wax casts that resulted to suit his purpose. Only occasion- ally did he work directly with what would today be regarded as a "legitimate" sculptor- partner, Angelo de' Rossi. The present bronze has close affinities with the modelling and casting of a bronze Putto Astride a Dolphin in Woburn Abbey, Bedfordshire, U.K. (See Avery 1988, pp. 270-71, figs. 12-13). This bronze was, according to a later inscription, dis- covered under the arena in Verona, which points to the principal local foundry as its prob- able place of origin. Its attribution is corrobo- rated by stylistic similarities with putti on other bronzes that may convincingly be associated with signed work by de Levis, such as a Putto Riding on a Monster in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London (inv. no. 2454-1856). Accord- ingly, the present charming putto may also be tentatively added to the oeuvre of Giuseppe de Levis. Giuseppe de Levis (1552- 1611/14). Putto Astride a Dolphin. Bronze.

North Italian, perhaps Milan, c. 1500 Unknown sculptor Head of Saint John the Baptist Bronze, 3 in. (7.1 cm) high Provenance Luigi Grassi, Florence Other Example Paris, Musee du Louvre [?] Condition/Facture The head is cast hollow with a thin wall, in a coppery bronze alloy. The truncation of the neck is not open, and has two holes (other than that currently used) for attachment. The details are freely and masterly fashioned on the wax cast- ing model, and there is little trace of after- working. A flat protuberance on the crown, near to a hole for attaching a halo, may be the trace of a sawn-off casting sprue, or a point where the head touched part of an associated statuette of an executioner or Salome. Interpretation The truncated head, with its noble features fro- zen in death and its long curly hair, is tilted to one side, and recalls the head of Goliath in the group with David by Verrocchio (Florence, Museo del Bargello), but without the fatal stone embedded in its forehead. It therefore is prob- ably to be thought of as that of Saint John the Baptist, cut off at the behest of King Herod, af- ter being entranced by Salome's dance. The head is sometimes shown held up by an executioner, or by Salome, or lying on the salver on which it was proffered to Herod. The present head has a closed and convex underside to the neck and signs of attachment, while its hair behind is pushed upwards, and so may have been shown lying on a salver. Such a gory image, independent of any other dramatis personae, was quite popular for reli- gious contemplation, normally on a larger, if not life-size, scale, in northern Europe-for instance Nottingham alabaster carvings of the fifteenth century, and polychrome wood renderings from Swabia and the Rhineland. 63</page><page sequence="57">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - FALL 1995 38.

The surface is evenly polished, with some minute striations from the tools still visible, and details, for example of the hair, are delicately incised. These are characteristics of the workshop of the goldsmith Antonio Susini, to whom was delegated the task of serially produc- ing many of Giambologna's most popular com- positions. Attributes are missing from either hand, and there are some small accidental dents to the lower thighs and knees. Interpretation The unusual subject of this bizarre figurine- somewhere between a portrait and a genre fig- ure in feeling-was probably inspired by a celebrated double-sided painted portrait of Morgante in the nude, showing him respec- tively from back and front, that was in the Medici collection by 1553 (now Uffizi Gallery, Florence). This was painted by Bronzino, prob- ably in connection with the Paragone-the theoretical rivalry between the fine arts of painting and sculpture. On behalf of sculpture, superiority was commonly claimed on the grounds that it could show multiple views, with . .. .. . . e_~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ .......... ..; _ W~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~................ . i_g ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~......... ... .................. . Cellini arguing, for instance, that it was seven times better than painting, as it could show eight principal views of a subject while paint- ing could show only one. In Bronzino's picture the front and back of the canvas were employed to show the two opposite views of the subject with slightly diverse attributes, on the front as Bacchus, and on the back as a hunter. 64</page><page sequence="58">RENAISSANCE AND BAROQUE BRONZES FROM THE COLLECTION OF ALEXIS GREGORY In what is generally held to be the prototype by Giambologna, Morgante is shown blowing a cornetto (a long, straight trumpet), which he holds in his lowered right hand, while support- ing himself with a walking stick in the other. The figure stands on a small oval base plate (Victoria and Albert Museum, London, inv. no. 65-1865). Several other casts have these particular at- tributes slightly damaged, missing, or adapted variously (e.g. Abbott Guggenheim Collection, New York: Camins 1988, cat. no. 29). There exists a second main class of variant, where, as on the painting, Morgante is shown with the attributes of Bacchus, god of wine (or perhaps the corpulent Silenus), holding a cup in his right hand, and in his left a wine jar, or a bunch of grapes against his left thigh (exam- ples of both are in the National Museum, Copenhagen, 5599 and Dep. 31: Olsen 1980). The present example appears to have been cast without anything in the lowered left hand (although the fingers could have accommodated the handle of a walking stick). It may have held a cup (separately cast and now missing) in the right hand, which is raised to keep it level, and is the subject of Morgante's slightly downward gaze. 39.

The elongation of the limbs and the thinness recall the proportions of Giambologna's preliminary wax "pensieri." The figure stands on tiptoe on its right leg, and not on the left one, as does the better known composition of Mercury by Giambologna. Attribution This figurine is a miniature version of a larger statuette now in the Museo Nazionale del Bargello, Florence, by the Dutch immigrant sculptor, Willem van Tetrode. Known in Italy as Guglielmo Fiammingo, he worked in Florence for Cellini in 1549, and his Mercury was clearly inspired by Cellini's larger statuette that was set in a niche on the base of his group of Perseus and Medusa of 1554 (Loggia dei Lanzi; the statu- ette now removed to the Museo Nazionale). Tetrode's Mercury was one of several statuettes that came off a studiolo that he presented to the grand duke Cosimo I in 1562, after he had returned from Rome. It thus antedates Giam- bologna's composition of Mercury, which is an unashamed version of it, in mirror image. Pos- sibly the present figurine, and other casts of rather varying quality, are derived from a pre- liminary working model that Tetrode made in wax in preparation for the statuette on the studiolo. However, the facture is so reminiscent of the series of figurines cast by Susini after Giam- bologna's wax models that it is tempting to see it as a product of his workshop, possibly based on a reworking by Giambologna himself of Tetrode's less subtle, earlier rendering, and thus dating from rather late in the sixteenth century. Furthermore, it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that Giambologna made such a wax model as a critique of Tetrode's statuette, but then chose to reverse the composition in 1562 when he was commissioned by Cardinal Cesi of Bologna to make a full-size statue. The delicacy of modelling the nude figure, the careful facture, and the sheer joie de vivre exhib- ited by the present piece incline one to believe that it may basically be the work of the greater sculptor, Giambologna, and that Tetrode merely provided the comparatively crude prototype. 40.

He stands with his left foot on a bronze hemisphere. Interpretation This type of running putto is normally thought to have been created as a pair to a cognate one that seems to be dancing, balanced on its right foot on a hemisphere (e.g. Victoria and Albert Museum, London, A.1o9-191o). The present composition is evidently derived from that of Giambologna's celebrated statue of Mercury, of which many examples on various scales are known, as well as his Fishing Boys in the Museo Nazionale del Bargello (Keutner 1984, pls. 19-20, 23-26). The attribution of these models, and a further pair of interrelated ones of similar size and gen- eral disposition with gracefully contorted limbs (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford), to Elias de Witte is based on stylistic similarities between the Dancing Putto and his larger, signed bronze statuette of Aeolus, dating from 1573, in the Studiolo of Prince Francesco de Medici (Palazzo Vecchio, Florence; Weihrauch 1967, pp. 192,200, pI. 238). Especially close is the idiosyncratic treat- ment of the hair as a series of pointed locks that break the silhouette of the head. Avery and Radcliffe 1978, no. 40 (followed with- out acknowledgment by Krahn and by Penny 1992) added to Candido's exiguous oeuvre a unique, finely modelled and chased figurine of Meleager with the Head of the Boar in the Staatliche Museen, Berlin (2594). A pair of simi- lar gilt bronze putti (12-13 cm. high) balancing on one leg and brandishing floating draperies in their raised hands, attributed to him with some reason, have recently surfaced in the art market (illustrated in the brochure of Pieter Hoogendijk, Baarn, Netherlands, and New York, at the XVth Biennale Internationale des Antiquaires de Paris, 21 September-7 October 1ggo). Other, larger bronze statuettes have from time to time been attributed to Candido, includ- ing one called Perseus in the Oskar Hainauer Collection (Bode 1897, no. 87) that is now gen- erally regarded as a Mercury and attributed convincingly to Willem van Tetrode, called Guglielmo Fiammingo . .. i in Italy (Radcliffe 1985, . pp. 105-6, pI. 11-12; and . .. this cat. no. 39), and an- other of Meleager in the Clemens Collection. .. . ... . . . :....... ...

There are traces of joints be- tween pieces of a mold down both sides, espe- cially noticeable on the left sleeve. The legs of his trousers are textured with a matte punch. Interpretation The statuette appears to represent a court jester-or perhaps a character from the Com- media dell'Arte-clad in heavy, ragged clothes. He is pulling back his hood with his right hand and looking over towards his left with a leer. The subject would perhaps have been more explicit had it had a pair, as is suggested by the posture. Several other examples are known, one of which is holding a jester's slapstick. The thick, dark patina on most of the statuettes is not typical of Florence, but might have been added later, over a reddish brown metallic surface, possibly in order to make them look "antique," under which appellation they might have been more readily salable in the eighteenth century. On the other hand, the patination might be in- terpreted as French and of the seventeenth cen- tury, which would lead to a different conclu- sion as to authorship of the model. Attribution Some measure of ac- cord has been reached with an attribution to Orazio Mocchi, a Florentine follower of Caccini and Giambo- logna, who was active about the beginning of the seventeenth cen- tury. The idea was first proposed by Planiscig (1923) and is based on generic rather than stylistic analogies with a group of sculptures in the Boboli Gardens, Florence. They are in 68</page><page sequence="62">RENAISSANCE AND BAROQUE BRONZES FROM THE COLLECTION OF ALEXIS GREGORY turn indirectly related to a relatively common bronze group of Saccomazzone Players, which Baldinucci confirms as the invention of Mocchi. The garden statues show a variety of figures in similar attire and in the same genre and spirit as the Jester. They were carved in humble sandstone by the Ferrucci del Tadda family between 1617 and 1621. Whether Mocchi provided the models for them, apart from the life-size rendering of the Saccomazzone Players is not known, though possible. Mocchi's further documented oeuvre in bronze, consisting of some small decorative elements on the portals of Pisa Cathedral, cast around 1600, does not lend itself to comparison with the statuette under discussion. Therefore, the attribution at present remains hypothetical. 42.

There are no traces of chasing in the curly mane or tail, though occasional details in the face and on the front hooves have been sharpened up a little. The fell has been lightly abraded to give it character and break too high a shine, for the sake of naturalism. Interpretation This is a very vivacious rendering of a high-spir- ited rearing horse, with an effect of arrested movement imparted by the "windswept" effect of mane and tail. Every detail is observed and rendered with loving care, right down to the horseshoes. Muscles bulge appropriately to the movement, nostrils flare, the mouth opens as though gasping for breath, and veins pulsate. The sculptor was evidently knowledgeable in eq- uitation, an important part of a gentleman's education during the Renaissance, and very 69</page><page sequence="63">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - FALL 1995 skilled at rendering equine anatomy, and reduc- ing it convincingly for close observation on a an intimate, domestic scale. There are no signs of a rider ever having been attached, and so the animal is visualized as though in the wild. Attribution After Giambologna, Pietro Tacca, and Ferdinando Tacca, successive Florentine court sculptors, the greatest exponent of the horse in sculpture was Francesco Fanelli. He claimed to be Florentine, though no documentation to support this has so far come to light, but began his career in the first decade of the sev- enteenth century in Genoa, working there until he was eventually summoned to the court of King Charles I of Great Britain. In London he cast some portrait sculpture, but seems to have specialized in the serial production of quite small bronze statuettes of horses (or the equine monster, the centaur) in many differ- ent attitudes. The deliberate self-identification of King Charles with Saint George, patron of "Merry England," probably helped to encourage the production of various renderings of Saint George on horseback spearing the dragon, while in other groups Cupid is shown shoot- ing with a bow on horseback, or a Turk is de- picted hunting a ferocious lion. Several such subjects feature in the inventories of the royal collection, as well as in a later list of bronzes that had descended from the duke of Newcastle, governor of the prince of Wales, and an enthu- siast for equitation. Fanelli exploited the technical feature of lost- wax casting, whereby each wax casting model, after it had been taken out of the plaster piece- molds and assembled, could be slightly altered by using warmth and by manipulating it up- wards or downwards with the fingers, to vary the details of mane and tail. Thus every bronze cast that resulted is actually unique, although there are close resemblances between examples of each general pose or group composition. The present horse is rather larger than the ma- jority of Fanelli's rearing horses, and is, corre- spondingly, more minutely detailed. Even so its features have much in common with those of its smaller, more common cousins, which are much commoner: a well rounded rump, quite thick body, slim legs, comparatively small head, and slim muzzle. The only feature that differs noticeably, and this may be a factor of size, is the more animated treatment of individual strands of mane and tail projecting into points that break the silhouette. In the present state of knowledge there is no artist whose treatment of the horse is closer to this than Francesco Fanelli. 43,44. Anglo-Italian, early 17th century Workshop of FRANCESCO FANELLI (active 1605-1661) Pair of Evangelists, Saint Luke and Saint Mark Gilt bronze, 6 in. (15.2 cm) high Provenance J.J. Klejman, New York Comparative Literature Keutner 1957, pp. 139-44, figs. 3, 6, 13; Camins 1988, pp. 98-101, no. 34 Condition/Facture The statuettes are quite thick-walled castings, in a coppery bronze alloy. The gilding was spared behind, and while that of Saint Luke is appro- priately rubbed off on the high spots, that on Saint Mark is not nearly so much. It appears 70</page><page sequence="64">RENAISSANCE AND BAROQUE BRONZES FROM THE COLLECTION OF ALEXIS GREGORY slightly yellower in hue, and may have been regilded. A straightforward comparison of these features is afforded by the covers of their respec- tive gospel books: the gilding of Saint Luke's is very patchy and evanescent, whereas that on Saint Mark's is complete, bright and highly bur- nished. Quill pens, (separately fashioned) are missing from the right hands of both Evange- lists, as is proven by tiny holes to receive them (in Saint Mark's fist, and Saint Luke's gospel page). The folds of drapery were softly modelled in pliable wax sheets on the original models, and are therefore deeply excavated . Interpretation The Evangelists are heirs in stylistic terms to those by Antonio Susini, which he modelled for the ciborium of the Certosa di Galluzzo (south of Florence), a documented commission of 1596. These were re-echoed with minor variations in niches on the West Doors of Pisa Cathedral, which were modelled in the immediately follow- ing years. Attribution Analogies are to be remarked with some figures in a series of small reliefs showing the Rest on the Flight into Egypt (or Holy Family in the House of the Robber) whose attribution ( in the absence of documentary data) vacillates between Ferdinando Tacca and Francesco Fanelli. While there are many features in common with Tacca's relief of The Stoning of Saint Stephen (Santo Stefano al Ponte, Florence) in style, handling of costume, and facial types, there is at present no reason to associate with him work on so small a scale as the relief (or the present statuettes). However, the small scale is normal for Fanelli, and so his candidature is now generally preferred (Camins 1988). The statuette of Saint Luke in its pose and ar- rangement of drapery and that of Saint Luke in its facial type are closely related to the figure of Saint Joseph leaning on his staff in the relief mentioned above, and they are on much the same scale, being only slightly higher than the plaque, which is 53/4 inches high. p. ~~~~A ^,,. :' .... ... .......... ~ ~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~..... . e . . .:. : ....

Several holes for core pins or wires, significantly a symmetrical pair to either side of the rock immediately below where Meleager sits, and one dead center behind and in front of his torso, as well as beneath his left thigh. Daylight may be seen straight through the casting via these holes. Virtually all the detailing is cast in from the wax model and not chased. This dis- tinction is especially noticeable on the bristles of the boar, which are defined by the rounded tip of the stylus, and not sharply cut with a burin. Interpretation The group represents the hunter Meleager rest- ing after killing the Calydonian boar and before presenting its head to his beloved, Atalanta, in an episode narrated by Ovid (Metamorphoses, VIII, 420-30). Attribution This composition, which is far from uncommon, is sometimes paired with a matching group de- picting Venus and Cupid Seated on a Dolphin. It 72</page><page sequence="66">RENAISSANCE AND BAROQUE BRONZES FROM THE COLLECTION OF ALEXIS GREGORY used to be attributed to an anonymous, early sixteenth-century Paduan workshop (Planiscig) until 1920, when Maclagan noticed an illusory correspondence with two half life-size groups carved in marble by Giovanni Bandini (1540- 1599), that are known only from descriptions in II Riposo by Raffaello Borghini (1584). This led Maclagan to conclude that the present bronze and its pair were reductions by Bandini, in which he was followed by Pope-Hennessy (1970). How- ever, additional information provided by Borghini that the male figure in Bandini's group represented Adonis and held a spear in his hand does not tally properly with the present composition. Furthermore, there has recently emerged on the London art market (although it was published and illustrated long ago as the work of Bandini by the late Professor Ulrich Middeldorf) a large marble statue that does answer to Borghini's description (a fact that curiously enough Middeldorf apparently did not note), apart from the fact that it is almost six feet high, rather than being half life-size. It is signed by Bandini and dated 1598, and is therefore probably a later en- largement of the earlier composition. It bears no resemblance to the present, seated, figure and the attribute of a spear is not only prominently displayed, but is indeed a dominant element in the design. The question of author- ship of this composition is thus again open for discussion. The painterly, waxy treatment of surface detail, treated with a black lacquer, and the very thin, occasionally flawed, casting technique, are ac- tually characteristic of Francesco Fanelli, court sculptor to King Henri IV of France and King Charles I of Great Britain. The model is now attributed to him, both on this account and on the basis of stylistic comparison with other fig- ures documented as by him (e.g. by the author of the entry in the catalogue of the sale of 1991, where the present bronze was acquired). 46.

Other plugs repair flaws in the thin casting, while other minor flaws remain, as on the back of the perizonium, and around the joints of the shoul- ders with the arms. The Corpus Christi is delicately modelled in the original wax, while the fingers and the curls of the hair around the nape of the neck and falling over the left shoulder are carefully relieved and undercut. The fringe of Christ's perizonium is chased and its cloth is also carefully striated to represent the direction of the weave. Christ's mouth and eyelids are hollowed out, while his flesh is chased and burnished. The gilding is lost on top of the arms and at the rear of the perizonium. Interpretation Great attention has been given to a minute de- scription of anatomical details such as the fin- ger- and toenails, the articulation of the toes, the bone structure of Jesus' face, and his curly mustache, beard, and luxuriant hair. In com- bination with the superbly apprehended anatomy, notably in the noble, athletic torso, the sculptor conveys thereby an effect of an ideal human body, with no traces of stress or anguish, apart from the gouts of blood spurt- ing from the Savior's right side. The impres- sion is of the "calm after the storm," when Christ had finally completed his earthly mis- sion with a tortured death at the hands of man- kind, and surrendering his soul to the Almighty, uttered the last words from the cross: "con- summatum est" (It is accomplished). Attribution This Corpus is an exceptionally fine example of a coherent group of bronze representations of the dead Christ (Cristo morto) that Guglielmo della Porta modelled and cast in silver and in bronze (with both frequently gilded) during the second half of the sixteenth century. The canon of style established in this group, with the comparatively small head and delicate facial features, the carefully rendered anatomy, the mannerist torsion of the body, and the elongation of the limbs, is typical of all della Porta's bronzes. While much of the detail is modelled in the casting waxes, the bronze casts are finished with a precision typi- cal of a goldsmith. In a letter of 1569 to Bartolomeo Ammannati (Gramberg 1960, no. 228), the sculptor men- tioned that he had made various "Christi in croce" in silver and gilt bronze in sizes ranging up to "trepalmi" (67 cm) following a type that he had developed "co'l parere et giuditio de buoni Teologi" (on the advice and sound judg- ment of good theologians). Furthermore, in a posthumous inventory of his estate drawn up in 1578 there is mentioned "una cassa con 18 crocifissi di metallo con 1i gessi (getti) attaccati non finiti" (Middeldorf 1977, n. 39). 74</page><page sequence="68">RENAISSANCE AND BAROQUE BRONZES FROM THE COLLECTION OF ALEXIS GREGORY The Crucifix cast in gold in 1582 by Antonio Gentili da Faenza for the altar cross of Saint Peter's in Rome belongs to this type (now in the Treasury, see: Metropolitan Museum, 1982, no. 22). The attribution of this type of Corpus Christi to della Porta is corroborated by two drawings in his sketchbooks that are now in Dusseldorf, that in an exaggerated way betray his idiosyncrasies of style (Gramberg 1960, II, pp. 143,150). 47.

Interpretation The slim and handsome youth stands in an open pose, and is shown performing a swinging action with his left hand, pivoting on his weight- bearing left leg; his other knee and arm are slightly bent and relaxed. The contemporary workingman's costume, with bare knees and boots, is often found on the pair (or sometimes trio) of villains who flagellate Jesus tied to a col- umn. These are often gilt and on a small scale for a house altar. Attribution The figure is clothed like, and on a similar, small scale to, those in a Flagellation group that ap- pears to be by Antonio Susini, probably after models by Giambologna (Milan, Museo Poldi Pezzoli, M. and F. Crespi Collection, nos. 67-68: 41/2 in. high). A stylistically and typologically related figurine of identical size cast in silver appeared at Christie's, London, 7 December 1993, lot ill. A comparison may be drawn with a pair of taller flagellators (35 cm high) in the Civiche Collezioni, Ferrara, that are similar in the elon- gated proportions and costume, though they have their arms raised more aggressively (Varese 1975). Their attribution to "The master of the Genre Figures" proposed byWeihrauch (196, p. 336), an 75</page><page sequence="69">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - FALL 1995 anonymous master whom he believed to have been active in Germany, today seems implau- sible; many of his group of genre figures have now been reassigned to Barthelemy Prieur. The type of figure and mannered, rather than overtly active, pose combined with the gold- smithlike finish, matte-punching, gilding, and facial features, were thought by the author of the Sotheby's catalogue entry (1988) to point in the direction of Christoph, grandson of the most celebrated German mannerist goldsmith, Wentzel Jamnitzer. This idea has been super- seded by the cataloguer of the example with Trinity Fine Arts (1995), who perceptively sug- gested that the model might have originated in the Roman ambit of Guglielmo della Porta. This may be so, though the pose is unlike those of the flagellators in his design for a plaque of the Flagellation, that is known from several ex- amples cast in silver or bronze, one of them gilt (Middeldorf 1977, pp. 8o-81, pl. 8). Nevertheless, this change may result from the physical balance and decorum required in a group of freestanding figures, as distinct from a relief, where they have the support of a background. The proportions and facial type of the present figu- rine are not far removed from those of the flagellator to the spectator's right of Christ in the plaques, though that figure is clad in a Roman style cuirass, and not in contemporary costume. The statuette of Christ in the complete group from the Auriti Collection is certainly compat- ible with, though weaker than, the protagonist in the Flagellation plaque. His anatomy is similarly svelte and his loin cloth is as waxy-looking. The existence of three separate casts of the present model also points to the world of della Porta, for most of his small bronzes were in- tended to be serially replicated. Minor variations in the position of their arms, for instance, could easily be effected by adjustments in the wax cast- ing models, or may have resulted from acciden- tal warping during the processes of investment, casting, or cooling off. Other, still smaller, variations are the result of diverse degrees of chasing on each individual cast, and of different minds and hands at work. The example from the Auriti Collection is hardly chased, and preserves the waxy-looking surface from the casting model; the present one is very well chased; while that with Trinity Fine Arts is superbly chased in every detail, even down to the lines of worry in the forehead, which serve admirably to convey the angst of the event. 48.

Exquisitely detailed in the original wax model, the group needed little tooling after the casting, beyond a loving burnishing of the exposed areas of flesh, and some reinforcing of finer details with a burin, in order to achieve a contrast between adjacent textures, for example the delicate stip- pling of Joseph's sleeves where they touch the smooth skin of the dead Christ. Interpretation The Pietd (Italian for pity), or lamentation over the body of Christ after the Deposition from the Cross, is a devotional theme that occurs regularly in European art, especially in the North, from the thirteenth century onwards. The dead Christ is usually shown on the lap of his grieving mother, Mary. Michelangelo popu- larized the theme in Italian sculpture with his rendering of it in Saint Peter's, and it became one of the strongest images to be used by the Counter-Reformation after the Council of Trent (1545-63). Michelangelo also carved in Rome (c. 1550-55) an alternative, expanded treatment including Nicodemus or Joseph of Arimathaea-with the sculptor's own facial features-helping to support and to mourn the body of Christ. It was destined for his own tomb, but was never finished (Florence, for- merly Cathedral, now Museo dell'Opera del Duomo). This group was composed in an isos- celes triangle and provides a useful analogy for the small bronze version, suggesting that the focal group of just two figures may have been flanked by others, for instance the Virgin Mary, Mary Magdalene and Saint John, all possibly set within a landscape background and mount- ed in a shrine for private devotions. Attribution This small-scale sculpture is in very deep relief (basso rilievo), so that it is virtually modelled in the round. It belongs to a group of pro- foundly religious sculptures on a similar scale which are normally attributed to Guglielmo della Porta, a sculptor active in Rome who was himself in holy orders and enjoyed the high office at the Vatican of "Holder of the Papal Seal" (Frate del Piombo), as the painter Sebastiano Luciani had before him. The tech- nical and stylistic affinities and the Christian subject matter of all these small bronzes with crucifixes, and with the albums of drawings that survive in Dusseldorf build up a coherent oeuvre. The latter contain no fewer than sixteen sketches of the Deposition produced between 1555 and 1558 that relate thematically to the present rendering, and, together with a further drawing in the Fogg Art Museum (from the Charles Loeser collection), serve as stylistic and compositional sources for it. The drawings were for an ambitious altarpiece of the Deposition, destined for the Carafa chapel in Saint Peter's, 77</page><page sequence="71">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - FALL 1995 which if it was ever executed is now lost (Vasari, Vita, p. 549). The studies were to have been re- used for one of a series of fourteen panels de- picting the Passion of Our Lord that della Porta envisaged as appropriate decoration for a set of bronze doors for the Basilica of Saint Peter's, but unfortunately they were also never ex- ecuted. A marble relief of the Lamentation by della Porta in the Museum of the Castello Sforzesco, Milan, is too small (53 x 44 cm) to be identified with the altar project, but it em- bodies some compositional ideas and human dramatis personae that are relevant to the present group (Gibellino 1944, pl. XXXVII; Gramberg 1937, pl. 191). It was popular and fre- quently reproduced in a variety of materials, including a bronze cast by Giuseppe de Levis of Verona. However, a still closer analogy may be remarked between the head of Joseph of Arimathaea in the present group and that of a corresponding figure in a gilt terracotta relief of the Deposi- tion in the Spada Gallery, Rome, that was monogrammed by Guglielmo's own son Teodoro and dated 1602 (Middeldorf 1977, pl. 5). This was part of the goods left in his will of 23 November 166i by Cardinal Bernardino Spada to his heir, Virgilio Spada. It was at that time placed in the bedroom of Conte Nicola Spada (1624-87), the cardinal's nephew. The facial type, with balding cranium, compact fea- tures, and its forehead furrowed with anxiety, is identical, though in the bronze rendering the hair and beard are longer and less well- kept. It has the character of a portrait, and may therefore depict the very same patron of both renderings of the theme. It was perfectly ac- ceptable, indeed normal, during the Renais- sance to include oneself among the participants in such biblical scenes, and the worldly char- acters of Joseph or Nicodemus were frequently adapted to this purpose in groups of the Depo- sition (both Michelangelo and Bandinelli carved self-portraits of this kind to go on their own tombs). The heads of Christ in the respective groups, with their deeply sunken eyes, pointed beards, and sharp straight noses, also correspond well, though these are normal in representations of the savior, most of which were based on the so-called Vera Effigies (True Likeness) that was believed to have been preserved on Saint Veronica's veil. The slightly awkward treat- ment of the bend beneath the thorax of the dead Christ is also shared between the two. All the hands and feet are well articulated with distinct knuckles and incised nails. Parti- cularly close to the hands of Joseph of Ari- mathaea in the present bronze are the visible hands of the similar figure (hidden in the pho- tograph) supporting Christ's knee with some drapery, and those of the woman-probably meant as Saint Mary Magdalene-supporting Christ's head. Middeldorf draws attention to the distinctive differences between the father's and the son's treatment of figures in their respective render- ings of the theme, writing of the more norma- tive proportions of the figures and the "sedate silhouettes and smooth modelling" that char- acterize the style of the latter. The same features emerge from an examina- tion of the present group, where the figures could certainly not be described as elongated, and the handling of drapery is also very close to that in the terracotta rendering. Teodoro della Porta therefore has very serious claims to its authorship, though they cannot at present be substantiated for lack of further evidence, either visual or documentary. 78</page><page sequence="72">RENAISSANCE AND BAROQUE BRONZES FROM THE COLLECTION OF ALEXIS GREGORY 49.

Interpretation Montagu writes of this particular cast: "This cast is of good quality. The cloths of the Virgin's cloak and dress are differentiated by the very fine ver- tical striations on the latter, in the manner of the Urbino cast (43.C.1o), the scarf being again left plain, but forming smaller folds than the heavier material of the cloak. The soles of the sandals are clearly visible, and the straps are slightly engraved on her feet." Attribution Montagu (1985, p. 348) sums up the present scholarly position: "Although there is no docu- mentation which can be firmly associated with this model, the attribution first put forward by Wittkower in 1928 is absolutely convincing, and has been generally accepted. Probably the item in Ercole Ferrata's inventory, 'Una madonna col putto di cera rotta, del Langardi' was a cast of this group, and perhaps also 'Una madonna di cera con putto ... del Langardi,' though here the attribution is uncertain, since it may apply only to the other object (a reclining woman) in the same sentence. There seems little doubt that the bronze in Maratti's inventory was of this model, and the imitations by Jean del Cour prove its popularity in the mid-century. "Wittkower dated the model about 1650, and this too is acceptable, placing it about the same time 79</page><page sequence="73">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - FALL 1995 that Algardi was working on the very similar Virgin and Child on the altar of Santo Nicola da Tolentino, and in a period when his sense of three-dimensional form and his ability to orga- nize detail within the mass were at their height. "The actions of the figures are not clear, and the hand of the Christ Child is open in a gesture of benevolence, but not of benediction; the Virgin, sometimes called a 'Virgin of the Rosary,' may well have held out a rosary in her left hand, though she could equally well have held a scapu- lar, and maybe this potential appeal to two de- votions has increased the model's popularity. In any case, we can safely say that she was seen as bestowing some object, rather than holding a scepter, even though in every known example her hand is empty." 50.

The tongue is separately fashioned and loosely in- serted into the cavity of the throat. On the beast's left wing are a pair of holes (1/4 in. diameter) for the attachment of a figure above, triumphing over it. The whole surface has been textured by matte-punching. Interpretation The sculptor has invented the dragon enthusias- tically with great leonine legs and paws spread out on the ground, but contrasting with a lithe ccwaist" and modest rib cage. Its wings are of the bat variety on the undersides, but scaled, like its back, on the outer sides. The canine mouth with protruding incisors yawns improbably wide, more in agony than in rage, in reaction to its van- quisher, who is now missing (owing to a theft). There is a distinct similarity to a type of dragon by Severo Calzetta da Ravenna (who was indeed 8o</page><page sequence="74">RENAISSANCE AND BAROQUE BRONZES FROM THE COLLECTION OF ALEXIS GREGORY formerly known as "The Master of the Drag- ons"), which appears to be more than coinci- dental. An example in the Museo Civico, Ravenna, also has a fixing on its back for the at- tachment of some sort of victor, and when this was still in place, such a group might well have inspired Algardi. Attribution Of the group when complete Montagu writes as follows: "The iconography of this bronze is un- usual: the Virgin stands upon a crescent moon embedded in a cloud, which rests upon the back of a crouching dragon, its head thrown back to look up at her and its mouth wide open, the tongue being cast separately, and mobile. Tradi- tionally the Virgin of the Immaculate Concep- tion is frequently represented as triumphing over the serpent, she may be shown as co-redemptress with one foot upon its head, or, more rarely, she may carry the infant Christ who pierces with a lance the tongue of the serpent, which tempted Eve to sin. It is not uncommon for the serpent to develop into a dragon, though, considering the curse put upon the serpent in Genesis 3:14, it is rare to find him shown as still possessed of his four feet. There is, however, a remarkably similar dragon in the Immaculate Conception designed by Pietro da Cortona and engraved by Fran,ois Spierre and others. "In this bronze a piece of metal has been added to the base of the cloud to make it fit securely on the dragon's back; however, there seems little doubt that this was its original destination. "There are no references to such an image by Algardi. The way in which the front panel of drapery is blown diagonally out to one side is superficially reminiscent of the motif which Puget took to Genoa and which was popular- ized there by Parodi; however, the construction Cast from - a model by . _ ..... Alessandro Algardi (I1595- 1652). The Virgin of the Immacu- late Conception Gilded bronze Matthiesen Fine Art Ltd., London. of the figure is quite different and points to the first half of the century, while the fall of cloth behind the Virgin's left leg, the curving folds of the loose cloak, and the very summary treatment of the back are all typical of Algardi's manner. "The workmanship of the bronze is excellent, the outer fabric of the cloak is finely punched and the surface of the dragon filed; several cast- ing faults have been repaired. The base is un- likely to be original and the gilt-bronze foliage applied to it cannot be by Algardi. "While considerably more advanced in style than the Charity, the Immaculata is rather less solidly constructed than the Virgin and Child; a date in the mid-i640s might be the most probable." 81</page><page sequence="75">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - FALL 1995 51. Central Italian, late 16th or early 17th century Unknown sculptor A Billy Goat Kicking Bronze, 2/2 x 33/4 in.

This is covered with a blackish brown patina, that has darkened in the interstices, and is rubbed to an oxidized metal color on the high spots. Interpretation The billy goat kicks with his left foreleg, and turns his head backwards as though to butt with a horn. His shaggy coat is carefully indicated by modelling in the original casting wax, and was probably freshened with a tool in the cold metal. There are some traces of matte-punching on the muzzle. A slight crack on top of the tail was prob- ably caused by an accidental blow or fall. Attribution This model is similar in subject, dimensions, and facture to a group of goats in a variety of natu- ral poses and actions-rearing, butting, or suck- ling their young-that were once believed to have originated in northern Italy in the early or mid-sixteenth century. This classification, how- ever, was based on an erroneous association of individual bronzes from the group with certain statuettes that are in fact from the Paduan work- shops of Riccio and one that we now recognize as that of Severo Calzetta da Ravenna, but these are of markedly different character (e.g. Bode 1930, p. i6, nos. 76-78). It is difficult in the case of these favorite and amusing domestic animals to find criteria by which to assign them to a particular place or date, as the sculptor's individual traits of style tend to be overridden by his desire for convinc- ing naturalism in his interpretation. However, the infinitesimal detailing of the coat and face of the present statuette points towards the gen- eration of Gianfrancesco Susini or Ferdinando Tacca, active in Florence in the earlier part of the seventeenth century, rather than to the school of animal sculpture that flourished in Padua (c. 1500-1550). 82</page><page sequence="76">RENAISSANCE AND BAROQUE BRONZES FROM THE COLLECTION OF ALEXIS GREGORY 52.

The in- side of the casting is shaped to fit neatly against a projecting molding around a three-sided sa- lient, such that the axis of the ram's head would have then pointed out diagonally from the cor- ner and would have been more or less vertical, with its muzzle pointing down and inwards be- neath the projecting molding, for example a table top. The fell of the animal is rendered with minute parallel striations. Interpretation The careful attention to detail and expression prove that the artist who created the original wax model for this casting liked animals and was an ardent observer of nature. The tradition of us- ing a ram's head as ornament came from an- cient art where the skulls of bulls (bucrania) and of rams were frequently so used, in allusion to the practice of animal sacrifices. Not surpris- ingly, it was in the deeply humanist ambiance of Padua, towards the end of the fifteenth and beginning of the sixteenth century, that rams' heads first reappear after Antiquity, in the orna- mentation of Riccio's Paschal Candlestick in the Basilica of Saint Anthony, where they project diagonally from the four corners of the pen- ultimate upper zone, above some rearing cen- taurs. They are richly and plastically modelled, and intimately connected by ribbons and their curly horns with the abstract ornament from which they spring. A fragmentary head of a ram in Vienna appears to originate from the same workshop, though it lacks the sophisticated, deco- rative quality of those on the Candlestick. Another ram's head in Munich has been tenta- tively connected, although the treatment of the surface is quite different, the fur on the face be- ing marked by striations made by parallel lines of deep matte-punching in the directions in which it would naturally grow around the muzzle and over the brow and cheeks. The chasing of the fur on the present example differs yet again, inasmuch as it does not follow the direction of growth so meticulously, but rather gives a generalized effect of a hairy, as opposed to a smooth, surface. The beast is nev- ertheless extremely handsome and decoratively 83</page><page sequence="77">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - FALL 1995 conceived, with an anthropomorphic character conveyed by the arched and bushy eyebrows, raised as though in disdain. It is hard to locate and date, beyond the fact that it appears to post-date quite considerably the prototypes by Riccio. Perhaps it belongs to the early neoclassical era, when such classical orna- ments became fashionable again in Rome, for their ancient overtones, and were used by gold- smith-entrepreneurs of ornamental artifacts like Giuseppe Valadier (1762-1839). 53.

The raised left fist is pierced to accommodate the cylindrical shaft of an attribute towards which Uranus raises his eyes. This was fixed with a screw into the palm of the hand.

The composition of a standing nude figure of a classical deity with one hand raised recalls Cellini's famous project for twelve such figures, over life-size and cast in silver, to illuminate the long gallery of King Francois I of France in his Palace of Fontainebleau. These are recorded, apart from Cellini's descriptions in his autobi- ography, by a drawing and a statuette of Juno, and various other data. It is probable that the compositions were known in France, as well as in Florence, where he returned afterwards, and that some may be preserved among the anony- mous bronze statuettes of the period. A distinguished source in common, such as this, may be the explanation of the close simi- larity of the two images in bronze, apart from details and facture. Indeed, the possibility of a French origin for the present piece cannot be excluded, especially in view of its reddish lacquer. 54. South Germany or Prague, early 17th century Circle of ADRIAEN DE VRIES (C. 1545-1626) Kneeling Satyr Bronze, 5 in. (12.7 cm) high Provenance Not recorded Comparative Literature Larsson 1967, passim; Avery, Radcliffe, and Leithe-Jasper 1978, nos. 69, 71, 72 Condition/Facture The statuette is very competently and flawlessly cast in a coppery bronze alloy, and has traces, for example in the small of the back, of a translucent golden patination. This has been covered with a thin, dark brown lacquer. Apart from the curly hair on the head and thighs, the flesh parts are sensuously smooth as the skin ripples over the muscles. The satyr seems to have been emascu- lated and there are indentations on the outer sides of his elbows which may be where his burden (now missing) was attached. On his stomach is a crowned R stamp, die-struck in horizontally. There are traces of piece-mold marks on both cheeks, which suggests that more than one satyr was cast, as one would expect with a caryatid 85</page><page sequence="79">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - FALL 1995 figure of this kind. However, the quality of imagination and modelling is superior to the general run of mounts, so that the piece can now bear examination individually as a self-sufficient work of art. Interpretation The satyr is lithe and athletic, though his face is mature, even beginning to show signs of age, such as sunken cheeks. His expression as he kneels beneath the weight of his burden is long- suffering and full of pathos. It is not clear what he held in his hands, and they are fully mod- elled without any traces of fixtures, so he can only have held its edges lightly. Attribution The presence of what resembles a goldsmith's hallmark of a crowned R struck on the stom- ach, combined with the remaining traces of piece-molds, suggest that this bronze was cast off an original in precious metal that bore the hallmark. That might have held a nautilus shell, or other rarity, such as were beloved by collec- tors of the day, especially in Germany and Prague. In terms of typology and style, the satyr seems to be a rare example of the Prague school of sculpture, which was led by Adrian de Vries and Hans Mont from Ghent. This type of muscular figure with a narrow waist but wide thorax and hips, and set in a contorted pose is typical of the style that de Vries evolved out of what he had learned from Giambologna in the late sixteenth century. Indeed, a possible prototype is to be found in the satyr modelled by Giambologna to leer at his figure of a Sleeping Nymph (e.g. Grunes Gewolbe, Dresden, no. IX, 34). 55.

The 17/8 inch square bronze base plate (and possibly also the lamb) were cast integrally. The whole surface has been carefully worked: the flesh parts with scrapers to .;| _ . l 1 smooth them, and the camelskin with matte- _t illpunches to convey the texture of hide. A hole in - 1 the crown of the head ( t -t 1 l | | was for attaching a halo. The gilding, although | probably original, is j barely rubbed on the A' high points.

There is probably missing a thin, long- stemmed reed cross from the saint's left hand. Interpretation The New Testament provides the iconography of the Baptist, who wore a "raiment of camel's hair, and a leather girdle about his loins" (Mat- thew 3:4). The lamb at his feet refers to the words that he spoke when Christ came to be baptized in the River Jordan, "Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world" (John 1:29). The closed book in his right hand is a sym- bol of the Old, as opposed to the New, Testa- ment. Saint John the Baptist could appear in any context connected with the rite of baptism, and frequently features in bronze statuettes made for the centers of holy water stoops in Italian churches (e.g. that by Francesco da Sangallo, from a church in Prato and now in the Frick Col- lection, NewYork; Pope-Hennessy and Radcliffe 1970, pp. 60-66). The present model is too small and delicate for such a setting, however, and it is found quite frequently (some ten casts are known), and so may have been given as a bap- tismal present, or as a reminder of one's name saint (Italian: onomastico). Attribution This is the only example of the rather well- known model to have the tiny Agnus Dei at the foot of the Baptist. The model has been very variously attributed, never with particularly co- gent arguments, and sometimes apparently on the simplistic assumption that it must be Florentine owing to its subject. Bode for in- stance, falling uncharacteristically into error, called it "Florentine, beginning of the 17th cen- tury, School of Giambologna," without adduc- ing a shred of supporting evidence, but writing apologetically in his introduction, "A statuette of the Baptist, attributed to the school of Gian Bologna, proves how little this art was adapted to the representation of Biblical figures(!)" Milliken, followed by Wixom, placed the Cleve- land Museum cast in Siena, in the vicinity of Francesco di Giorgio (1439-1501), noting its "ex- quisite, almost feminine" character and "languid elegance," while disparaging all the other casts of which they were aware (apart from that in the Gunther Schiedlausky collection, Nurem- berg) as "heavier in their modelling and details and perhaps represent(ing) the work of a Vene- tian workshop of the mid-sixteenth century" (Wixom 1975). No cast including the Agnus Dei 87</page><page sequence="81">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - FALL 1995 is listed by Wixom, and so he presumably did not know the present example. It may be true that the various casts did not all originate at the same place and date, and that the one in Cleve- land, which is cast with a convincingly thick base, may be one of the best examples (although the pelt of the camel is not rendered with matte- punching). An example in Paris has been classified as from the circle of Andrea Sansovino; and one owned by Pope-Hennessy has been related by him to the early work of Jacopo Sansovino. Radcliffe accepts this connection, linking it loosely with the statue of Saint James in Florence Cathedral of 1511, but noting that the specific iconography of the closed book in association with the Baptist is "a north-eastern Italian phe- nomenon, not exploited in Tuscany." A better test, however, is a comparison with Jacopo's two versions of the same saint in Venice: the left hand figure on the tomb of Gelasio Nichesola in Verona (only an attribu- tion, but one that is generally accepted), and the seated one, that is signed and datable circa 1530, mounted above the font in the Cornaro Chapel of the Church of Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari (Boucher 1991, figs. 85, 93-95). They share a depiction of the Baptist as gaunt but strong, and with his muscular thorax deliber- ately revealed by the camelskin garment, which is open at the front, unlike the carefully ar- ranged coat in the statuette. Furthermore, the former is deeply indebted to the virile proto- types by Donatello and Francesco di Giorgio Martini. The same is true of a bronze statuette showing the Baptist preaching of which there are two casts in the Ca' d'Oro, Venice, which may be cast from a model or design by Jacopo (Boucher, cat. no. 63, fig. 350). None of these representations seems to have any hint of the gentle treatment and introspective character- ization of the present image, nor its weak sense of contrapposto. Indeed, Boucher does not in- clude the model at all in his recent monograph on Jacopo Sansovino, even among his rejected attributions. In the absence of any new factual evidence to assist in solving the problem, it seems prefer- able to revert to a neutral position as regards attribution and date, while drawing attention to the distinctly goldsmithlike treatment of surface, which may mean that one should be looking for an artist qualified in that direction, and one used to serial manufacture for the mass market, rather than for a sculptor accustomed to working on a monumental scale. Furthermore a Venetian origin is not manda- tory, and it should not be forgotten that gilt bronze was a popular material for small devo- tional sculpture also in Spain (compare a rect- angular plaquette of Saint John the Baptist half-length and holding the closed book, the lamb, and a reed cross, as in the statuette, in a commonly reproduced series of popular saints that date apparently from the period of King Philip II and the building of El Escorial: Weber 1975, no. 1042). 88</page><page sequence="82">RENAISSANCE AND BAROQUE BRONZES FROM THE COLLECTION OF ALEXIS GREGORY 56. South German, Augsburg (?) late 16th or early 17th century Unknown sculptor Fallen Centaur, Probably Nessus Gilt bronze, 41/2 x 53/4 in. (11.5 x 14.6 cm) Provenance Not recorded Comparative Literature Schlosser 1913-14, pp. 102f.; Kris 1932, cat. no. 77, pl. LIX; Egg 1960, pp. 53f.; Weihrauch 1965, pp. 263f.; Avery, Radcliffe, and Leithe-Jasper 1978, no. 82a Other Examples None found Condition/Facture Competently cast in an apparently coppery bronze alloy; hairline flaws to the centaur's neck, stomach, and human part of the back. The pelt of the equine component is obsessively incised with parallel diagonal strokes of the burin, as is the hair of the head, waist, and tail. In the center of the back is a large round copper plug with- out gilding. Unless this was a hole used to empty the core material, it may have been a point where another object was attached, for example the corner of a cabinet, or another figure. Interpretation The centaur holds a club in his lowered left hand, and tugs at his hair, while grimacing with pain and rage. If there was a missing figure, it may have been one of Deianeira, wife of Hercules, whom the centaur Nessus carried off ill-advis- edly, only to pay with his life for this transgres- sion when Hercules shot him to death. There is no sign of a hole in which the fatal arrow could have been imbedded, but if it ever existed, it would have been so small as to be easy to fill and subsequently disguise, perhaps when the fig- ure of Deianeira was also removed for sale as a separate statuette in her own right. Alternatively, a figure of Hercules himself may have stood astride the centaur, as in a less well-known ver- sion of Giambologna's composition on the same theme where the centaur's haunches are on the ground and not raised in resistance, which is known from an original wax model and from a later cast probably by Gianfrancesco Susini (Liechtenstein). The wood base with bulbous sides has the ap- pearance of some age and, if the centaur is not a mount from a piece of furniture, it may be origi- nal, for there are no visible traces on its top of fitments for another composition, but only a series of circular indentations made over the years when the present bronze was free at the front to swivel sideways. -4 s_ 89</page><page sequence="83">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - FALL 1995 Attribution Although influenced by Italian sculpture, the statuette is clearly northern European and probably German in its facture, though its style is not sufficiently distinctive to associate it at present with a particular sculptor. The atten- tion to surface texture and detail, combined with the gilding, indicates that it is probably the result of a collaboration between a sculp- tor and a goldsmith (see also cat. no. 29). Weihrauch explored the use of Italian bronzes as models by German goldsmiths, but the role of indigenous sculptors in providing models for goldsmiths and mounts for cabinetmakers re- mains obscure (Kris 1932). Figures of this type have traditionally been located in Augsburg, as that important south German mercantile city had not only a wealth of goldsmiths' shops, but also traditional bronze foundries, which could cope with the most sophisticated tasks. Simi- larly, Innsbruck, residence of the Tyrolean branch of the Habsburg dynasty and another important town situated half way between Italy and the North, developed advanced bronze foundries under the supervision of Hubert Gerhard and of Caspar Gras. This industry was cut short by the outbreak of the Thirty Years War, and research has only just begun to dis- tinguish its products from those of Augsburg and Munich (Egg 1960). 57.

The head of Saint John the Baptist has been acci- dentally broken off at some stage and during repair has been repositioned at a wrong angle. Straight fine seam lines remain on the surface, recording the joints between the different piece-molds within which the wax "skin" was cast. No signs remain of any tools having been used to sharpen details or contours after the removal of the molds. 9o</page><page sequence="84">RENAISSANCE AND BAROQUE BRONZES FROM THE COLLECTION OF ALEXIS GREGORY Interpretation This is the wax stage in the laborious produc- tion process of a statuette in bronze, prior to its actual casting in metal. From the sculptor's origi- nal model in wax or baked clay (which in this case survives in the Getty Museum) piece-molds would be taken, which could be removed and reassembled to form a hollow, negative image of the group. Into this, molten wax could be poured evenly to create a skin as thick as the wall of bronze was eventually to be, and any surplus poured away, to allow the skin to cool. The skin would be reinforced from the inside by a thick layer of wet clay, which would dry off solidly. The present form emerged when the piece- molds were removed from outside. At the next stage a network of fine wax rods de- signed to create passages to admit molten metal (runners) and ducts for the gases to escape (ris- ers) would have been attached at strategic points on the surface. The whole would then be cov- ered once more with a slip of plaster in repeated layers, thereby building up an outer casing for the group of sufficient strength to withstand the considerable forces of expansion created when the metal was poured in. Thin pins would have been pushed through this casing before it dried, through the wax and into the core, to fix their relationship during the next stage when the whole was placed in an oven in order to melt out the wax skin and leave a corresponding void. Molten bronze would then have been poured in from a crucible until the mold and the ducts were full to the brim, and then allowed to cool off. The outer casing would then be knocked off, the runners and risers sawn off, and the core pins withdrawn with pliers, to leave a raw cast in bronze resembling precisely the wax model that had been melted away and lost-hence the name of the process, "lost-wax" (cire perdue in French). Thereafter, it was up to the sculptor and his team to chisel, rasp, hammer, or otherwise treat the surfaces to achieve the effect that he desired. If he did it himself, the result is designated as"au- tograph," and if not, as "workshop." Attribution It is very rare for a work at this stage to be aban- doned and then to survive. No finished bronze examples are known, which is not surprising, in view of the fact that this very model would in- evitably have been lost had it actually been em- 91</page><page sequence="85">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - FALL 1995 ployed in the casting process. However, what appears to be the original working model (bozzetto) in terracotta from which the piece- molds for it were taken has also survived (Getty Museum). The very fact that it is about one quar- ter of an inch (1 cm) higher serves to prove that it is a preliminary model and not an after-cast taken from the wax group or from the same piece-molds, because shrinkage occurs at vari- ous points in the processes of piece-molding and casting. The unusually smooth and dark surface of the terracotta is probably not just an unusual patina, but the residue of varnish that would have been applied as a separating agent, in or- der that the piece-molds could be removed eas- ily, without damaging the surface of the model. This fine composition, of which Planiscig in 1921 over-optimistically attributed the terra- cotta model to Jacopo Sansovino himself (when it was in the collection of Erich Lederer in Vienna), and of which the wax cast was subse- quently associated with Roccatagliata (when in the Heim Gallery in London), has finally come to rest in the established oeuvre of Girolamo Campagna. Both models are closely related to a monumental marble group of the same sub- ject, apart from the fact that the infant Saint John and the wings of the cherubim are absent from the finished work. Carved by Campagna probably between 1585 and 1588, this is set in a niche over the altar under the patronage of the Venetian family Dolphin in the church of San Salvatore (Rossi; Timofiewitsch). The various omissions possibly reflect the shape of the block of marble that was available, or the rather con- fined space of the tall but narrow niche on the altar. 92</page><page sequence="86">Bibliography Allison, Ann Hersey. 1992.
