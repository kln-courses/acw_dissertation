<plain_text><page sequence="1">Tool-Using Performances as Indicators of Behavioral Adaptability by K. R. L. Hall INTRODUCTION THE USE BY AN ANIMAL of an object or of another living organism as a means of achieving an advantage has been commonly regarded by comparative psycho- logists as an indication of intelligent adaptability. The mediating object is required by definition to be some- thing extraneous to the bodily equipment of the animal, and its use allows the animal to extend the range of its movements or to increase their efficiency. Phrases like "functional extension" have been applied to such performances, whose crucial characteristic is manipula- tion of something in the environment, in appetitive or aversive behavior or, much more rarely, as part of an instinctive display or nesting operation. Many problems arise as to the origin, in ontogeny and phylogeny, of such performances. It is rarely clear whether a performance is characteristic of a species, or whether individual variations due to local ecological conditions modify it. Nor is it clear whether a performance, once it has occurred in an individual given or in a group of animals, can be transmitted to form a "tradition," in the sense of a habit learned and retained, or whether the more likely evolutionary process is selection, on the basis of the advantage of the performance; in the latter cas,e, the learning is a matter of t,rial-and-error application of the tendency, comparable to the way in which any number of inherited tendencies may be ecologically employed. Thorpe (1951, 1956) has examined much of the evidence along these lines, with particular reference to birds. In the present paper it is intended to carry the analysis into the realm o,f nonhuman primate behavio,r; some of the well-authenticated studies of other animals will be cited to give the necessary comparative per- spective. On evaluating performances as falling inside or outside the category of tool-using, it will be evident that they vary greatly in their flexibility and apparent behavioral complexity. All performances are conven- tionally excluded if they involve simply applying a "primary" object, for example, food, to a "secondary" object, such as a rock. Thus, the snail-breaking by thrushes or the dropping of shells by gulls or crows onto a hard surface can be excluded. Included can be performances as manifestly unlike as the carrying of actinians in the claws of crabs and the enlisting of aid among chimpanzees in the cooperative solving of problems beyond the ability of a single chimpanzee, or the inducement of one chimpanzee by another, through food-begging or threat, to bring it food. TOOL-USING OTHER THAN FOR DEFENSE OR FOOD-SEEKING The classic example of tool-using in insects, that of the solitary wasp, Ammophila urnaria, was reported by Peckham and Peckham (1898); to be sure, Williston (1892) had already made similar observations on an- other species. In each instance, the act consisted of K. R. L. HALL has been Professor of Psychology at the University of Bristol, England since 1959, having formerly been head of the Psychology Department at Cape Town University (1955-59) and, in Bristol, of a Department concerned primarily with experimental research on human psychopathology (1949- 55). Born in 1917, he took his bachelor's and doctoral degrees at the University of Oxford. Hall's earlier publications were chiefly on problems of human experimental psychology and psychopathology, notably studies of pain response and intellectual deterioration. At Cape Town, he was able to develop his interest in comparative animal behavior, first, by undertaking field studies of the behavior of a closely related group of birds, second, by beginning, in 1958, a long-term' programme of research on baboons. Since leaving South Africa, he has continued his studies of baboons, and is now engaged in a combined field and laboratory study of another terrestrial species, the Patas monkey, and is super- vising a study of the Vervet monkey. The present article, submitted to CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY February 18, 1963, was sent for CA* treatment to 37 scholars of whom the following responded with written comments: Richard J. Andrew, C. R. Carpenter, Mudr Radomlr Cihak, R. Dale Givens, Harry F. Harlow, Gordon Hewes, Harry J. Jerison, Arthur J. Riopelle, John Paul Scott, and S. L. Wash- burn. The comments written for publication are printed in full after the author's text and are followed by a reply from the author. 1 This paper was prepared while the author was a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, Stanford, California, in 1962-63, and was supported by a PHS research grant (M-5502, Evaluatiotn of Literature on Primate Behavior, National Institutes of Health, U.S. Public Health Service). The author acknowledges particularly the help of his colleague at the Center, Dr. George Schaller, in calling attention to several references and in commenting upon certain points in the manu- script, and he thanks Mr. Robert H. Krear, Department of Biology, University of Colorado, for allowing him to quote from his unpublished observations on tool-using in the sea otter.

The Peckhams commented: "We are claiming a great deal for Ammophila when we say that she improvised a tool and made intelligent use of it, for such actions are rare even among higher mammals...." (p. 223). Whether this is to be counted as an "individual" achievement rather than characteristic of a species is not certain, and the problem is not, at this level, of importance except in the way it parallels the situation in "higher" animals. So unexpected and interesting were these observations to the early comparative psy- chologists that they tended to jump to the conclusion that "intelligent purpose" and "perception of the rela- tion of means to an end" (Morgan, 1900) were in- volved, while McDougall (1923) was somewhat more lyrical, saying: Are we then to regard each of these two wasps as a lively bahnbrechende genius, leading their species on- ward to the use of tools; individual sports comparable to the man, or ape, who first took a stone in his hand to crack a nut and so foreshadowed the genius of Nasmyth? I see no other plausible interpretation of the facts. [p. 91] The best known and most reliably reported instance of tool-using among birds occurs in the Satin bower- bird, Ptilonorhynchus violaceus. This species was said by Chisholm (1954) to use a "toGI," such as small wads of bark, to aid in the painting of the inside walls of its bower. He commented: ... it had been supposed that these served the office of a brush, but it is now thought more probable that each one acts as a cork, or stopper, to prevent the paint oozing from the tip of the mandibles while the bird is plastering the walls of the bower with the sides of the bill. [p. 381] Marshall's study (1960) provides the behavioral context of these performances in the Satin bower- bird species, as well as a very full description of them: ... many, but not all, adult males begin to plaster their bower with a thick, black; tacky material made from a mixture of charcoal compounded with saliva. With a bark wad held between the tips of the beak, the plaster is forced between the mandibles and so transferred to the inside sticks of the bower. [p. 207] A similar kind of behavior is reported of some male members of the genus Chlamydera: painting their bowers with dry grass mixed with saliva. These performances occur during displays which serve partly to attract females to the display grounds, partly to repel other males, so that pair-formation can occur: "Remarkable as they are, the bowers and display paraphernalia of bower-birds are no more than an extension of the territorial and display impulses to be found in other birds" (p. 208), and the whole perform- ance of bower-construction and painting is inter- preted by him as the outcome of a "displaced nesting- drive," the male taking no part in nest-building or incubation. Marshall commented that bower-birds are no more intelligent than other highly developed passerine species, and there is, indeed, no valid reason for supposing they might be simply on the grounds that an elementary act, definable as tool-use, is incor- porated into tlhe display. The rarity of any sulch performance among birds or other animals in such a context suggests that it is a special case of behavioral adaptation which has no particular significance in the evolution of "intelligent" tool-using. Seemingly the only instance in this miscellaneous category known in mammals is that of the Burmese elephant, which, according to Williams (1950), picks up a long stick with its trunk to scratch its body. Although in captivity monkeys and apes are known to cover themselves with sacking or other materials, apparently as protection from cold or wet, no such instances are known from field studies. TOOL-USING AS A PART OF AQONISTIc BEHAVIOR Not a single authenticated instance of tool-using as an element in agonistic behavior is known in animals other than that of the monkeys and apes which use a tool in repelling predators or intruders. According to Duerden (1905), the carrying of actinians by the crab Melia tessellata may have protective function. The crab travels with the actinians expanded and directed forward, sometimes waving them from side to side; when irritated, it moves its chelipeds toward the source of irritation, thereby placing the actinians in what may be considered the most favorable agres- sive or defensive attitudes. It is possible, however, that this function is secondary =d incidental, for the crab reacts in the same way whether it is carrying the actinians (as food-getting "instruments") or not. In considering such evidence as there is of the "agonistic" use of objects by monkeys and apes, trying to analyze the observations in terms of function and context of the act, we should first examine reports on wild animals, in which no training by or imitation of human beings is presumably involved. Some of the sources of information (Table 1) are personal observa- tions of trained field-workers, others, those of natu ralists and hunters (Wallace; Merfield and Miller; Hingston), and the rest, of unknown source. The two major field studies of baboons (DeVore 1962, etc.; Hall 1962a and b, etc.) include no observations of agonistic object-use. In both of these studies, the investigator's objective was to study the baboons with- out disturbing them by his presence, and hence, the very situations most likely to elicit agonistic behavior in a group usually were lacking. The unexpected pres- ence of parties of travelers or soldiers in baboon country may produce great agitation in the animals, eliciting a more intensive reaction. In analyzing the function and context of these "primitive instrumental acts" (Carpenter 1934), we shall need to refer chiefly to the few studies in which sufficient detail of observation is available. In general, it is implicit in most early reports that the animals roll stones or drop or throw branches and other objects with intent to hit or drive away intruders. Aim or purpose in the act is assumed, and hence the whole act is usually thought of as intelligent or learned rather than instinctive or emotional. Lacking detailed and careful observation, one alternative was that these happenings are the "accidental" result of some agonis- tic behavior pattern characteristic of the species. Thus, excited macaques may dislodge stones in scrambling up a slope away from an intruder, or members of an arboreal species may chance to break off branches while making threatening gestures. Zuckerman (1932) inclined to the view that the many instances of this 480 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="3">Hall: TOOL-USING PERFORMANCES sort of behavior could be explained as the more or less accidental outcome of emotional displays, and thus did not need to assume the animal's perception of a relationship between such acts and the possible conse- quence of driving away an intruder. This explanation seems correctly to emphasize the emotional origin of such acts but probably incorrect- ly assumes that animals noted for their learning ability would not readily carry out the emotional gesture with a very elementary directedness rather than in a sup- posedly random fashion. Analysis of two sets of observations may help to clear the way for a critical evaluation. of the status of the behavior involved. Carpenter (1935) describes the reactions to man of red spider monkeys in Panama as including the following: (1) barking; (2) frequently, approach; (3) in trees within 40 to 50 feet of the observer, shaking of the branches associated, almost invariably, vigorous scratching; and (4) "breaking off and dropping of branches . .. close . . . to the observer." "This behavior cannot be described as throwing, al- though the animal may cause the object to fall away from the perpendicular by a sharp twist of its body or a swinging circular movement of its powerful tail". Sometimes the dropping is-delayed for a few seconds, as an observer approaches; feces and urine are also dropped. All are "instrumental acts" carried out with reference to objectives. This account indicates that: (1) the approach of the monkeys is an aggressive action; (2) the vigorous scratching represents a displacement activity, which is known experimentally to occur in agitated monkeys that, because of caging, are unable to act out their es- cape or aggressive tendencies more directly (Hall 1962c); (3) shaking of the branches probably represents a redirection of the aggressive tendency; (4) breaking off and dropping the branches would seem to be a natural carryover of the aggressive movements, no new type of movement being involved; (5) the delay in dropping and the imparting of direction to the branches is "purposive" or "instrumental" in the elementary sense that the consequence of this variation is anticipated as being more rewarding than the consequence of no aiming; in other words, a simple process of operant conditioning is at work, whereby the "aimed" variation is reinforced over the "un- aimed." The objections to such a formulation stem mainly from the lack of information as to the frequency and variability of "directed" performances in these ani- mals. Nevertheles, the learning postulated is of so. elementary a kind that all it requires is a very slight modification in the agonistic behavior repertoire apparently characteristic of the species in such cir- TABLE 1 SOME SOURCES OF EVIDENCE ON THE AGONISTIC USE OF OBJECTS BY MONKEYS AND APES IN THE WILD Species/genus Author Behavior and situation recorded Gorilla Merfield and Miller When hunted, tearing off branches and flinging in direction of hunters (1956) below, "after peering about to locate them accurately" Schaller Various forms of throwing of branches in agonistic display; not (1963) reported to be directed at source of disturbance Orang-utan Wallace Throwing down of branches and heavy fruits in direction of intruder (1902) Schaller Breaking off and hurling branches in direction of the observer (1961) Gibbon Carpenter Breaking off and dropping dead branches in direction of observer (1940) Howler Carpenter Breaking off and dropping dead limbs toward observer also defeca- (1934) tion and urination from directly above observer Red spider Carpenter Breaking off and dropping branches close to observer (1935) Cebus Kaufmann Dropping nuts and debris onto coatis (1962) Baboons Brehm (1916), Geladas meeting Hamadryas and rolling stones down upon them; Hornaday (1922), rolling of rocks toward human intruders and other sources of unknown reliability Macaques Kinnaman (1902), quoting another source Deliberate tilting-up and rolling of stones down slope; throwing down Hingston (1920) of pine cones by Japanese monkeys at passers-by Joleaud (1933) and other sources of unknown reliability Patas Boulenger (1937) Directing "fusillade" of sticks, stones, etc., on river travellers in W.

It is not easy to imagine simpler learning performances, given the usual threat-gesture system of monkeys, for no new act is involved. For all other species of new and old world monkeys, only a single, very brief statement about the behavior of a Cebus capucinus group on Barro Cororado Island has added to our knowledge. During his two-year study of coatis, Kaufmann (1962) on one occasion saw the monkeys chase some coatis from a tree, then go on to drop nuts and debris from a Scheelea palm onto them. The coatis ignored the shower except to pounce on and eat the ripe nuts that were included. This ob- servation is of particular interest in view of the reputation of Cebus in laboratory experiments and because it is the first by a naturalist of behavior of this type involving non human intruders. Among the apes, Wallace's observations (1902) on the orang-utan and Schaller's confirmation and elabo- ration of them (1962) suggest a similar pattern. One of Schaller's observations was as follows: A female with a large infant spent 15 minutes throwing a total of about 30 branches varying in size from twigs to limbs 10 feet long and 3 inches in diameter. Consider- able effort was expended at times in tearing off the larger *branches. Limbs were thrown in three ways: (a) she merely held the branch at her side and dropped it. limply; (b) she looked down at me and swung the branch like a large pendulum, and at the peak of the arc closest to me she released it; (c) she lifted branches either as high as her chest or above her head with one hand and hurled them down forcefully. Whatever interpretation is given this behavior, there is no doubt that it induced me to jump nimbly at times and that it kept me effectively away from beneath the tree. [p. 82] Wallace's account concerned the throwing down of branches and of the fruits of the Durian tree, by an adult female with young ones near her; and he supposed that the ape's parental instinct may have been specially aroused. However, the essential features of the situations in which this and the resulting behavior occur are similar to those in the Red spider monkey account, namely disturbance by a human intruder eliciting agitation and redirection of aggres- sion onto the most readily available objects, and an effective directing of the objects toward the observer. The explanation already proposed seems to need no revision to include the orang-utan data or any other data of similar performances in free-ranging monkeys or apes. This does not imply that such displays always or even usually have a "direction." Schaller's (1963) full account of the mountain gorillas' repertoire of gestures in such circumstances does not suggest that branches or leaves are, in the physical sense, aimed at the observer. The amount and kind of learning in- volved in "aiming" are such that many other mammals below the primates might achieve this behavior very readily if they had happened to evolve the sort of manipulatory and agonistic repertoire which seems to be a general simian characteristic. To underline this point, we may briefly consider the agonistic and the feeding repertoire of baboons in the wild (Hall 1962a and b). First, baboons frequently turn over stones when searching for food. Second, they may pull violently back and forward on tree branches or rocks while staring at and otherwise threatening an observer. Third, they may hit away, with a swift underarm movement, a noxious or unfamiliar small object or living organism as a sequel to, or component of, a startle behavior sequence. These three aspects of their behavior readily dispose these animals to the simple instrumental act involved in tipping a rock toward an intruder. There would be no mystery if it were shown that baboons or chimpanzees, for example, throw sand, stones or sticks, toward a predator on the same horizontal plane. All that' is necessary is that the hitting-away movement be combined with the most elementary of feeding acts, that of grasping some ob- ject in the hand and "aiming" it in the same way that a threat-gesture or' movement is usually directed toward an adversary. Because the use of objects as missiles has tended to be confused with the use, and even fashioning, of objects as offensive weapons, the complexity of the behavior involved seems to have been greatly exaggerated. Linking behavior of this kind with that observed to occur spontaneously in captivity adds very little to the o-ver all picture. Many reports are available of agonistic scooping/throwing in captivity (Kortlandt and Kooij, in press), but all that need be added as commentary is that horizontal aiming is an extension of the threat-display, involving nothing more than the coordination of two-acts basic to the repertoire. Brandishing of a stick and using it to beat another animal, as described by Cooper and Harlow (1961) in an individual Cebus fatuellus and in several chim- panzees, is an interesting elaboration of threat-display against other animals, but the significance of such performances must again be regarded first in their functional context, and only later against the supposed evolutionary background. The kind of brandishing action reported is very similar to that which baboons (Hall 1963a) and other monkeys and apes may engage in throwing a sack or a stick over a food-object. We are not primarily concerned here with sifting through the varied kinds of evidence and deciding as to their reliability and accuracy. It is not yet possible to make valid comparisons of the various species or for example, of terrestrial monkeys and anthropoid apes, of old world or of new world types, and the like, with respect to their "ability" to engage in this kind of instrumental behavior. Chimpanzee, capuchin, and baboon may turn out to demonstrate this propensity more readily and more flexibly than other nonhuman primates, but it is all too easy to fit the inadequate observational evidence into whatever evolutionary model one chooses-as Kortlandt and Kooij (in years) have done. It is simply the interaction of the processes of learning with the components and sequences of the naturally practiced behavior repertoire that requires a clear and straightforward analysis. The key to the instrumental learning successes of many types shown in the wild and in captivity by these animals is the exploratory-manipulatory tendency, of a quite general kind, which makes it easy for transfer or generaliza- tion to take place from one kind of situation to an- other, and over a wide range of objects or stimuli. Although we can thus simplify the behavioral analysis in such a way as to show that performances of the kind reported are readily to be expected in these ani- mals, it still remains necessary to consider very care- fully the kinds of environmental conditions which elicit or inhibit or just fail to elicit these performances. 482 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="5">Hall: TOOL-USING PERFORMANCES TOOL-USING IN EXTENSION OF THE FEEDING R EPERTOIRE The use of an object as a means of obtaining food which the animal cannot reach or which if within its reach, the animal cannot obtain directly is, contrary to the preceding class of performance, reported in birds in several instances, occasionally and rather un- certainly in marine invertebrates, and once only, with two other insufficiently substantiated instances, in subprimate mammals. For monkeys and apes, there is an extensive experimental literature, many observations on animals in captivity, and extremely few field data that provide evidence for analysis. The data will merely be sampled, as in the previous section, to illustrate points that seem significant for the whole comparative picture. Inevitably, this means paying most attention to the areas where most reliable knowl- edge is available. The case of the crab, Mellia tessellata, and actinian "commensalism," described by Duerden and others, is a curious example of the use of a living organism as a tool to aid the feeding of another. Although Duerden says the crabs do not restrict themselves to one species of anemone and may also, as already noted, hold them forward as a kind of defensive aid, the performance need not be classed as more "intelligent" than other sorts of behavioral adaptation to ecological need in which no tool or accessory is involved. In bir,ds, there are two sorts of performance which have been much discussed, namely, the string-pulling achievements of Parus and other passerines, and the use of a cactus-spine or twig as an extention of the bill to probe out insects or larvae in the so-called Gala- pagos woodpecker-finch, Cactospiza pallida. The for- mer type of behavior clearly has some parallel in the probable factors involved here and in similar perform- ances of primates. There may be an "inherited tendency" to pull upon and manipulate with beak and foot grasses, hair, bents, and other long flexible mate- rials, in the course of nestbuilding or perhaps in obtain- ing certain sorts of food. This factor and practice can be supposed to account for the ease with which some of these birds seem immediately to tackle the task of pulling in a string on the end of which a bait is attach- ed. We may note that the direct pulling-in of a string or stick to the end of which the food-object is attached seems to be a task requiring very little modification of existing repertoire other than trial-and-error appli- cation. The tool-using performances of the woodpecker- finch are usually considered a remarkable example of behavioral adaptation to fit it into the special ecologi- cal circumstances of the Galapagos Islands bird population. According to Lack (1947, 1953), this primarily insectivorous fin-ch resembles a woodpecker in that it climbs up and down vertical trunks and branches in search of its food. But whereas the wood- pecker, having excavated in a branch with its beak, inserts its long tongue into the crack to get the insect out, the finch has evolved the alternative method of picking up a cactus spine or twig, holding it length- wise in its beak and poking it up the crack, dropping the twig tO seize the insect in its beak as it emerges. It has been seen to reject a twig if it proved too short or too pliable, and sometimes the bird carries a spine or twig about with it, poking it into cracks or crannies as it searches one tree after another. Bowman (1961) added further observations on this behavior. He saw it most frequently in the dry season in the arid zone, where almost every bird of the species was seen carry- ing a cactus spine in its bill. He also reported two cases of what appeared to be attempts of the bird to adjust the size and shape of its probe to fit the cranny or crack in which it was searching: (1) One such bird was holding a spine about six inches long. Only about two inches of the spine protruded from the tip of the bill, the remainder passed along one side of the face and neck. Apparently the bird realized that the stick was excessively long, for it made an unsuccessful attempt to twist off approximately three inches of the spine by holding it with the feet. [p. 33] (2) He quotes an observation made by Mr. Kastdalen in 1956: I was looking at a finch the other day, and he con- vinced me that the stick habit is intelligent and not instinctive. One of them was working in a hole... which seemed to be full of bugs, so he had to drop its stick several times to catch the bugs. Each time it went for a new stick, but after a few times it came with a forked stick, and tried to get it into the hole a couple of times, but in vain. Then he saw what was wrong and turned the stick around and broke it off at the fork, and started working. [p. 33] Ignoring the terminological points about the bird's "realizing" what it was doing and the distinction between "intelligent" and "instinctive," it is evident that something definable as "tool-making," that is, an attempting to work upon the tool-object, is here involved. However, it is likely that nothing more worthy of note is involved in such an attempt than what is routine in of nest-constructing activities. While it is indeed remarkable that this finch should have evolved a behavioral adaptation supposedly more appropriate at the primate level of evolution, the chief significance of such a performance, in the com- parative behavior framework, is perhaps to emphasize the fact that tool-using as such, and even tool-making, taken outside of the total behavioral context in which it occurs, is not a criterion of adaptability that should be assigned any special weight. If in rare cases a species of crab or bird evolves a behavioral, rather than a physical, adaptation to deal with some ecological condition, this may be interesting evidence of the versatility of evolutionary processes but involves no more complex type of learning than, one may suppose, the sort of trial-and-error adjustments which these "remarkable" species have in common with other crabs and other birds. Among subprimate mammals, we have already cited Williams' (1950) report of elephants using sticks to scratch their bodies, and he also describes how "Many young elephants develop the naughty habit of plugging up the wooden bell they wear hung around their necks with good stodgy mud or clay so that the clap- pers cannot ring, in order to steal silently into a grove of cultivated bananas at night" (p. 78). While the performances of elephants in captivity indicate that their potential in tool-using is probably greater than that of any other nonprimate animal, there iS no Vol. 4 * No. 5 * December 1963 483</page><page sequence="6">systematic evidence of the variety of their perform- ances in the wild. It can merely be noted in passing, however, that the way in which they pull down or push over trees to get at foliage otherwise beyond their reach is an instrumental act" at least on a par for behavioral complexity with patterned string or string- pulling performances. It is also, for the elephant, a much more economical way of feeding than would be, say, its attempt to knock off fruit or leaves by bran- dishing a stick in its trunk. Apart from elephants, another class of mammal that may be found to use tools as a feeding aid in the wild are bears. The readiness with which they stand on hindlegs and use their paws in manipulations would predispose them to develop such skills where need arises, and Harington (1962) interestingly reviews the evidence that polar bears dislodge or pick up and cast down blocks of ice onto the heads of sleeping walruses. The only subprimate mammal for which there are reliable reports is the sea otter, Enhydra lutris. Studies made of its feeding habits show that in the Aleutians as well as in California, mollusks form a substantial part of the diet. In California, abalones are also commonly brought up and eaten, but it is not known whether rocks are used to aid in the process of removing these large shellfish from their sites. Fisher (1939) was the first to give a detailed account of this animal's use of a stone as a tool: It is a not uncommon thing to hear a sharp clicking sound and then to locate its point of origin... This sound is always made by an otter that is trying to crack open something with a very hard stonelike shell. The object that the otter has in its paws is too small to see-possibly it is some mollusk. The object is held with both paws and with full arm action from well over the head it is brought down hard on a piece of rock that rests on the otter's chest. These pieces of stone are brought to the surface at the same time as the food. It may take several severe blows before the object is cracked enough for the otter to get the food out. These rocks are not small but appear to be almost as large as the large abalones. When the otters roll over they hold both the rock and the food on their chests. This clicking sound is so distinct that it can be heard for some distance above the noise of the waters. [p. 28] Murie (1940) confirmed this observation on the California animals, and Hall and Schaller (in press) have obtained quantitative data on this performance; they reported that it is usually mussels that are banged against the rock anvil, although occasionally other animals, such as spiny lobsters, may be pounded in this way. Krear (personal communication), who spent from late July until mid-December 1957 on Amchitka in the western Aleutians, watching sea otters most of the time, observed only one young animal traveling with its mother that used a rock as a tool: "The immature was observed on three occasions to bring rocks tQ the surface, and on these he would pound and crack his food items, most of which were little blue mussels." It is probable that 'he mussels in the Aleutians did not require tool-use of the sort so fre- quently seen off the California coast, but that the propensity for such performances is readily available, as is strongly indicated by Kenyon's account (1959) of how an adult otter, captured in the Aleutians, used rocks as anvils on which to pound clams. The sea otter data suggest very little at present as to the origin, variability, and other characteristics of this behavior. So far as is known, no developmental obser- vations are available, other than the one instance quoted. It is also likely that the pup acquires the habit by observing the behavior of its mother, for it swims for many weeks very close to her, takes food from her chest, and is occasionally offered food by her (Hall and Schaller, in press). It is thus highly probable that the pup must learn its discriminations of food objects and of behavior appropriate to deal with them by observing the corresponding behavior in the mother. The fundamental dependency relationship is such that "following," both perceptually and in the locomotor and manipulatory senses, is necessary for the pup's survival. This is generally true of mammals and is mentioned here only because it may help to explain the origin of the habit. Considering now the nonhuman primates, detailed evidence from field studies indicates that only one, the chimpanzee, uses tools; this it does in reference to a probably minor feeding behavior, probing termites out of holes with twigs (Morris-Goodall 1962). Beatty (1951) reported that chimpanzees in Liberia break open palm nuts by hammering them with rocks, and Merfield and Miller (1956) described how chimpanzees poke long twigs into the entrance holes of the ground nests of bees and withdraw the twigs coated with honey. The distance at which this observation was made was 50 yards, using binoculars. Pitman (1931) mentioned seeing a free-living gorilla using a stick to obtain fruit otherwise out of its reach, but Schaller (1963) had no record of such behavior in 12 months of field study. This lack of evidence of tool-using comes as a surprise to the many investigators familiar with the ease with which other species of great ape and several species of monkey learn spontaneously in captivity, as well as with progressive training procedures, to use sticks, sacks, boxes, or even live rats (Kliiver, 1937) to haul in food objects otherwise out of reach. Cebus capucinus and perhaps other Cebus species appear to be particularly adept in this respect (Kliiver 1933; Bierens de Haan 1931), while individuals of the Papio ursinus species (Bolwig 1961; Hall 1962a) show a similar kind of aptitude. The surprise of the laborato- ry investigators is due to the apparent discrepancy between the potential that these animals have for such performances when given situations designed to elicit them in captivity and their failure to make use of the potential as an aid in increasing their dietary reper- toire in the wild. Two of the main factors accounting for this discrepancy are: (1) Systematic field evidence is still far too scanty for us to know how great the discrepancy is; for example, very little is known of the details of the feeding habits of free-ranging Cebus. (2) The discrepancy is not a behaviorally significant one but is rather due to a misconception as to the degree of transfer or generalization involved when the wild-born animal is given the usual run of instru- mentation tasks in captivity. This point requires a brief elaboration. If we take as an example the natural feeding behav- ior of the baboon and the more or less continuous processes of exploration and manipulation of objects that go with it, some of which have already been mentioned, we find that the animal is practicing, 484 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="7">Hall: TOOL-USING PERFORMANCES either in play or in actual feeding, a variety of skills which are readily generalized in the experimental situation. The young ones carry sticks or branches in their mouths or in one hand and do not use them in feeding. All of them at some time or other break dead branches from bushes in searching for food, as when, for example, they are searching for larvae or ants' nests (Hall 1962a). They push over slabs of rock, and they tend to investigate almost any strange manipu- lable object that lies in their path. They pull upon telegraph wires, open the doors and windows of un- occupied huts and cars, and so on. In short, they show a generalized tendency to fiddle with and try out objects that may or may not be instrumental in obtaining food. These animals appear to have a surplus of exploratory-manipulatory energy for which there may seem to be no immediate ecological need. How- ever, it is perfectly feasible to suppose that it is just this kind of generalized activity which has enabled baboons to be sufficiently adaptable to survive over large areas of Africa in a very wide variety of habi- tats, for example, allowing them to be omnivorous in some regions (although they are classed as predomi- nantly vegetarian in all areas where the diet has been adequately scheduled, according to Washburn and DeVore [1961 ] and Hall [1962a]). Thus, given the be- havior reportoire the baboon is known to possess, the learning involved in obtaining food that is out of reach would appear to be of a rudimentary kind. Similar evidence as to the maturation of the necessa- ry manipulatory coordinations (Schiller 1957) and as to the effective role of natural and instrumental practice (Nissen 1931; Birch 1945) has been put for- ward for the chimpanzee, and there is no need to review it. One comment of Schiller's is particularly appropriate, however, because it indicates how, in chimpanzees and other species, the "emotional" re- pertoire of gesture may be readily utilized in differing contexts: That a chimpanzee breaks off a branch if excited has nothing to do with his desire to get the food [in an experimental situation]. Once he has the stick in his hand, he will use it sooner or later. Such a sequence can easily be reinforced in a couple of trials, then it appears to be a coherent, continuous pattern. [p. 275] GENERAL EVALUATION Tool-using performances have tended to be treated as though they represented some kind of behavioral homology at the different levels of organism in which they have been recorded. This view seems to be in- correct, however, because it seems evident that the application of a common term to so varied an assort- ment of performances has led to the glossing over of fundamental differences in adaptive significance. While the criterion of tool-using is no longer used by anthropologists to signalize a supposedly critical stage in the transition of ape to human, it is still not un- reasonably inferred that tool-using was an important behavioral adaptation somewhere in primate evolution, and that the making of tools derived from a preva- lence in tool-using far in excess of that now discernible in any living nonhuman primate (Washburn 1950). For anthropologists, behavioral evidence of living non- human primates in the wild is thus of interest to the extent that it indicates "transitional" ingredients of essentially hominid characteristics such as the carniv- orous tendency and tool-using (Oakley 1951). In the general framework of animal evolution, we have seen that instances definable as tool-using occur in highly specialized ecological settings, as in the wood- pecker-finch, crab-actinian commensalism, and prob- ably the Ammophila. These are basically behavioral adaptations that are probably produced by trial-and- error learning, like that commonly found in almost all living organisms. These adaptations do not appear to give their possessors any selective advantage over other species which have evolved alternative forms of adaptation. Rather, they simply enable their possessors to survive at a certain population level in their ecolo- gical niches. In other words, such performances are only worthy of special note because of their entirely superficial, indeed one might almost say fortuitous, resemblance to human tool-using. The case of the string-pulling performances of some passerines is of the same order. While one allows that birds of the Parus genus, as an example, show a certain aptitude in this kind of problem, as in others, such as pecking open milk bottle tops, no one, but for the human analogy, would probably be disposed on this ground to give this species a specially high rating for adapt- ability. As others have clearly indicated (Thorpe 1956; Tinbergen 1960), birds may evolve certain rather restricted propensities enabling them to learn through what one might call a special aptitude. The natural practice of food-seeking and nest-construction may fit into the scheme. A performance classifiable as tool- using may in fact be less significant as an adaptability indicator than one which cannot strictly be so consid- ered, such as the performances of thrushes, gulls, or crows in breaking open hard food-objects. The observations of the sea otter were reviewed at length to refute the view that its performance indicated that a new process had appeared at the Mammalian level of evolution. The apparent uniqueness of this performance and its occurrence in the context of a particular marine ecological situation for which the animal shows other peculiar behavioral and physical adaptations, such as lying on the back when feeding, indicate that there is no reason to judge this animal's performances as of any greater evolutionary signif- icance than those for which other marine mammals, such as seals and dolphins, are noted. In the evaluation of what is known about the non- human primates' performances and potentialities, we have to consider two main types of tool-using: that in the service of agonistic behavior and that in ob- taining food. It is in the former category that by far the most evidence is available, suggesting that "instru- mental acts" with some degree of direction or purpose are quite a widespread and general characteristic in monkeys and apes, as a straightforward function of fear-threat motivation and manipulatory endowment. And indeed it seems, as the quotation from Schiller indicated, that we have here a behavioral adaptation of a fairly general and simple kind which evolved primarily in the context of agonistic tendencies toward opponents that inhibit direct attack. Associating this with the fact that no such instances have been reliably Vol. 4 N No. 5 - December 1963 485</page><page sequence="8">reported in any other class of animal, one can infer that this is the fundamental behavioral situation from which all other instances of primate tool-using have been derived. There is, in most monkeys at any rate, an arousal of fairly strong agonistic tendencies in any food-to-be-gained situation in which they are frus- trated. They tend easily, in such circumstances, to show displacement activities or redirections of aggression (Masserman and Pechtel 1953), and their tool-using attempts often consist of throwing actions which are hardly distinguishable from threat-gestures. It will be only through systematic developmental studies of young primates that we shall be able to trace the course of these performances and to study the rela- tionship between frustration responses and the emer- ge-nce of tool-use in general. SUMMARY Tool-using performances in animals have often been considered important indicators of relative intelli- gence, but no comparative analysis of their probable origin and place within the total ecological and behav- ioral setting has been available. The usual definition has tended to emphasize features that performances at different phyletic levels have in common, while glossing over the underlying and even overt differences. The many examples in the literature are sampled with reference to the use of tools: (1) in agonistic behavior; (2) in extending the feeding habits of a species; and (3) in courtship display (Satin bower- birds), nest-hole construction (Ammophila spp.), and, possibly, body care (elephants). Examples of the second category include what appear to be special behavioral adaptations that are functionally equivalent to physical extensions or modifications, as in the case of the crab-actinian rela- tionship in Melia tessellata, the Galapagos wood- pecker-finch, Cactospiza pallida, and possibly also in the sea otter, Enhydra lutris. To varying degrees, the tool-using adaptation has importance in the life of the species. In the crab and the finch, it seems to involve a basic feeding adjustment, while in the sea otter it is reportedly used only with respect to one major item of food, mollusks, and it may be much more prevalent in the southern limits of distribution than in the north. Among nonhuman primates in the wild, tool-using of this sort is rare, not being known in baboons and macaques, and only reliably reported, among the anthropoid apes, in the chimpanzee which appears to use a food-getting tool to obtain a supplementary rather than a staple item of diet. Examples of the first category occur only in non- human primates. In systematic field studies in the wild, "primitive instrumental acts" of breaking off and casting down branches, twigs, or leaves in the direction of the observer have been reported of howlers and red spider monkeys, gibbons, and orang- utans. Gorillas include throwing gestures in their complex and apparently stereotyped displays when disturbed, but no "directing" toward the source of disturbance has been noted. Terrestrial monkeys of the Macaca and Papio genera have been reported to push or roll stones towards intruders. There are, how- ever, no detailed field observations of this behavior, and, if it occurs, it is probably elicited in groups of monkeys that are highly disturbed and unused to human intrusion and would not be seen under the noninterference conditions in which the field observer usually tries to work. Controversy over the reliability of the evidence on tool-using, particularly in nonhuman primates, and over the explanation of such instances as are irrefuta- ble, seems to stem from the following: (1) a tendency to overestimate the significance of such performances as indicators of behavioral adaptability, largely because o-f the urge to discover equivalences to stages in human evolution; (2) a failure to analyze in detail the context and function of such performances. It is suggested that the "primitive instrumental acts" involve only an elementary form of operant conditioning imposed upon the agonistic repertoire of the species, and that "direction" of aim with objects is no more surprising than the fact that threat gestures without objects are normally aimed at an intruder. The discrepancy, commented upon by laboratory investigators, between the apparent ease with which many monkeys and apes use tools to gain food in captivity situations and their apparent failure to use this propensity to advantage in the wild, has no real significance. Possibly the "primitive instrumental acts" provide the primary emotional bases from which any kind of tool-using arises, the transfer to other situa- tions, such as food-getting, being conditioned by the way in which the animals manipulate objects not directly related to food. The present evaluation of the comparative data has, as its purpose, the clarification of the confusion caused by inadequacy of behavioral evidence and by the biasing of such evidence to fit some evolutionary scheme. The hypothesis that the "emotional" use of tool objects by monkeys and apes may provide the lead to an understanding of the origins, in phylogeny and ontogeny, of such performances in human beings is suggested by the fact that no comparable agonistic performances are known in any other class of animal. On the other hand, tool-using as a feeding adaptation occurs in several different types of animal but has so far proved very rare in monkeys and apes. Abstract Use of an object by animals as a functional extension of their limbs in order to obtain food or to facilitate some other goal seeking activity has quite commonly been reported as an especially significant indicator of intelligence or complex learning ability. The present review has selected well authenticated examples of tool-using behavior from different types of animal, such as wasps, crabs, birds, subprimate mammals, and nonhuman primates, and examined the context of their occurrence and the apparent com- plexity of performance involved. These performances have been concerned with: a) attainment of food; b) offensive or defensive use against predators or in- truders; c) miscellaneous functions such as self-groom- 486 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="9">Hall: TOOL-USING PERFORMANCES ing, courtship, nest-building. Categories (a) and (b) contain by far the most instances, and (c) has very few indeed. The problem, in attempting a comparative analysis of such instances, is to evaluate the performance within the whole context of the animal's capacities and the way these are expressed in various ecological settings. The evidence cited is primarily from' naturalistic studies, that from restrictive settings, such as Zoo or laboratory, being adduced only in emphasizing dis- crepancies. As an example, baboons have, so far, not been seen to demonstrate tool-using in the wild in their food-seeking behavior, but they do so readily when given the opportunity in captivity. They thus have a potential which their natural surroundings perhaps only rarely bring into action, whereas chim- panzees demonstrate their capacity for this kind of performance in diverse ways both in the wild and in capativity. Certain performances by nonprimate animals, such as the Galapagos woodpecker finch or the California sea otter, indicate that tool-using of a very effective, though presumably restricted, kind can evolve in animals having a narrow habitat range, and in whom, therefore, other significant aspects of adaptability may be missing. Further, from assessing the many instances of category (b) and the very few instances of category (a) in wild monkeys and apes, it was tentatively suggested that the emotional offensive- defensive type of tool-using "might have had primacy in evolution over that of food-getting and the other miscellaneous instances. A review of this sort, with a suggestion of this kind, is-put forward anyway chiefly as an attempt at clarification which may lead to much further detailed studies, experimental and naturalistic, of the animals in question. As always in describing complex behavior and in deriving models or inferences from the description, the profusion and confusion of terminology are dif- ficult to sort out neatly or clearly. But the objective of this review will have been achieved if, in delib- erately avoiding the use of controversial terms, it has been possible to show the need for a fresh research approach to the comparative study of behavioral adaptability in animals with a view to working out much more satisfactorily than at present the bearing that such evidence may have upon fundamental ques- tions of human evolution. Comments By R. J. ANDREW* New Haven, Conn., U.S.A. 20.5.63 My comments will be brief, since I agree with all the principal points made -by Prof. Hall. It seems clear that our main attention should be concentrated on the use of tools by primates in the field. There is very little information to be obtained concerning the evolution of tool use by studies in which primates are trained by investigators to use tools. However, even in the absence of such field data, it is possible to investigate in captive animals the normal range of motor patterns used by a species in grasping or manipulating the objects with the hands. As Schiller (1957) empha- sised, the number of such patterns is far fewer even in the chimpanzee than might be expected. A recent study by Bishop (1962) in my labo- ratory has shown that only one grasping gesture is used by the Lemuroidea and only one (a differ- ent one) by the Lorisoiffea, the second being adapted to catching insects. Unlike the Ceboidea or Cer- copithecoidea (Napier 1960; Bishop 1962) their power and precision grips are the same. Current work in our programme of comparative stud- ies of primate behaviour suggests that a single manipulative pattern may function in several different contexts and so be exposed to widely differing selection pressures. One interesting example is the pattern of grasping an object with both hands, and then rotating the hands outwards so that they separate distally. This, when used in groom- ing, serves to part the hair and make the skin accessible to the lips and teeth. When used in grasping an object, it has two functions. In the case of a solid unyielding object it results in the object being turned, since one of the hands ceases to oppose the other and relaxes for long enough to allow some rotation. A series of such movements permits the animal to investigate the object from all sides. In the case of a soft object the opposing rotation of the two hands may break the object. It is as yet impossible to decide in what context this pattern probably first appeared. It is present in both Cer- copithecoidea and Ceboidea from Saimiri up. In the more advanced members of both groups, further grasping and manipulatory patterns appear. In the present article, the hitting away of objects by baboons was men- tioned. In Papio hamadryas a two handed backward and forward scrubbing of objects on the ground passes with increasing rejection of the object into more lateral move- ments in which the object is held in one hand and may finally be flung away. Besides finding a variety of uses in foraging the first type of movement is used in punishing young animals (Kummer 1957). In Cebus spp. one handed banging of an object against the substrate may occur as well. A more comprehensive knowledge of the distribution and relative ease of elicitation of such manipulative patterns may make it possible to say something definite concerning the ecological determinants of their evolution. This in turn would be relevant to the problem of the origin of tools, in that the first use of tools by human ancestors must have been greatly affected by the range of manipulative paterns which they pos- sessed. However, the data collected by Hall on the use of tools by animals other than primates suggests that the use of tools in the human line, and their almost complete absence in oth- er primates was not due primarily to very advanced manipulative abilities, or even intelligence in our ancestors. It appears that the use of tools can appear without either if the selective pressures for this are strong enough. (A similar argument can be made concerning the origin of vocal mimicking, Andrew 1962.) It may therefore be most profitable to look for a major ecological difference between the human line and other primates. Cooperative hunting of moderate to large sized prey is per- haps the difference most commonly suggested. The dropping or throwing of objects in defense by primates has been very fully discussed in the present article, and it is no novel suggestion that such behaviour might have been critical in the first development of tools. Vol. 4 * No. 5 December 1963 487</page><page sequence="10">By C. R. CARPENTER* Oak Park, Penna., U.S.A. 24.5.63 The interesting paper by Hall describes special performances of animals in natural environments which may indicate special behav- ioral adaptability. The evidence ar- rayed and the inferences stated oppose attributing tool-using to animals, including non-human pri- mates living in the wild. The con- clusions, also, oppose explanations which include "intelligence" and "purpose." Learning of "simple" kinds including trial-and-error and "operant conditioning" are judged adequate to explain "primitive in- strumental acts." Is these statements are correct, then a more descriptive title than the one selected might have been used. The general definition given of a category of behavior, modified as follows, could be useful: The use by an animal of an object, or of an- other living organism, as a means of achieving an advantage indicates adaptability. Such a definition and inference could include defined acts, defined objects, conditions and other organisms, and the consequences or results of a complex sequence of be- havorial events. I should have liked to have had Hall's definition of tools and tool- using and to know whether or not he accepts the concept that tool making could be defined as the shaping or moulding of material or object to serve repetitively a set of functions. Also, I would have appreciated knowing what is implied by "primitive instrumental acts." The aggressive-defensive acts of howlers, spider and cebus monkeys, gibbons and orangs breaking limbs or branches and timing their fall relative to a moving object, person or another animal are rather com- plex even though "primitive." The non-human primates for which there are reliable observations of breaking, holding, somewhat directing and releasing objects in aggressive-defensive situations are all arboreal types. For them height, availability of obtainable and drop- pable objects, gravity, and perhaps, other factors provide conditions for the occurrence of the described be- havioral patterns. Tree shaking occurs in rhesus monkeys but not the breaking off and dropping of objects with reference to sources of disturbances. How does Hall classify and inter- prete the bridging behavior observed in howler and spider monkeys? When an adult, usually a female but sometimes a male, spans a space, remains suspended and permits a young animal to cross over it, is this too a "primitive instrumental act?" Hall seems to have accomplished his objective of raising serious doubt that the evidence supports the hy- pothesis that behavior which cor- responds closely to tool-using, oc- curs in animals including the non- human primates. However, it does seem that many animals and non- human primates exhibit naturalistic behavior patterns which are instru- mental in achieving goal states. The explanations and functions of these classes of behavior surely are not as simple as Hall seems at times to imply. By RADOMIR CIHAK* Prague, Czechoslovakia. 25.5.63 This interesting paper approaches the problems of so-called tool-using in animals from the standpoint of behavior studies. From the view- point of an anatomist studying the development of the human hand in ontogenesis and phylogenesis, I might comment on several points of common biological interest, and then add a comparison with our results of developmental studies of the pri- mate hand. 1. I have to agree with the author's conclusions that problems exist in comparing similar actions in dif- ferent animals of the same phylum or in animals of different phyletic position. 2. All these problems depend upon the exactness of definition of the terms, tool, tool-using, and tool- making. If the definition of the tool-using performance is to be extended to include all actions of animals-in whatever sence-where we find the use of an object foreign to the body of the animal in ques- tion; this multiplies the examples of tool-using animals. 3. The author states: Tool-using performances have tended to be treated as though they represented some kind of behavioral homology at the differ- ent levels of organism in which they have been recorded. This would not seem to be the case at all, because it seems evident that the application of a common term of classification for so varied an assortment has led to the glossing over of funda- mental differences in adaptive significance. The term "behavioral homology" presents difficulties. In morphology the term "homology" indicates body structure in different animals that are of the same relation, principal pattern in the body, and of the same origin. For other structures of similar form, but of different origin- the term analogous is the only correct one. Hence the observations quoted sometimes concern similar actions of animals at different phvyletic levels, i.e., of animals whose struc- tures of the central nervous system, e.g., in insect and mammal, are not homologous at all. The actions de- scribed may be similar to the action of tool-using man; this does not mean that it is tool-using. Hence, if we extend this terminology to the classification of behaviour-the results are behavioral analogies at different phyletic levels. 4. The author states that not tool- using but tool-making signalizes the critical stage in the transition from ape to human; but it ought to be pointed out that tool-making, as ccshaping an object in an imaginary future eventuality" (Oakley 1961), is the real boundary between ape and man. The real tool is the ob- viously shaped and obviously used object. Based upon this view we would probably be right in saying that there is no tool-using in animals at all; but that there are many ex- amples of using stones, branches, or other objects during reproduction, nesting, feeding, excitation, etc. From the physiological viewpoint, these processes -are chains of uncon- ditioned or, sometimes, conditioned reflexes connected with food, re- production, etc., developed during the phylogenesis of the species con- cerned as adaptations to the environ- ment. These processes are the same in their physiological base in all species, including nonhuman pri- mates. 5. For some observations greater accuracy, probably followed by a new and reconsidered explanation is necessary; for other observations (elephants plugging their bells so that the clappers cannot ring, or polar bears casting blocks of ice onto the heads of walruses), fundamental re- vision of the facts registered in the literature is desirable. Many zoolog- ical observations tend to express the behaviour of animals in anthro- pomorphistic fashion. 6. There are several problems con- cerning apes: Kohler's experiments indicate the ability to use bam- boo poles in order to obtain fruit which is out of the animals' reach. This use of a pole may occur in a complicated manner, but it is always initiated by seeing the food desired. In Hall's paper, contrary to experimental conditions, apes are reported as using objects during excitation with the implication that this is the probable mode of origin of tool-using in man's phylogenetic past. This may be right, but with the reservation, concerning the above- expressed differences in the defini- tion of the tool, tool-using, and tool- making. The physiological condition of the brain of tool-using and tool-making 488 CURRENT A-NTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="11">Hall: TOOL-USING PERFORMANCES man is different from any living nonhuman primate. It is necessary to point out that both recent apes and recent men are ends of divergent developmental branches of primates. This divergence is determined by the whole complex of erect posture, the development of the central nervous system, together with tool-using and tool-making hands, and the begin- ning of social life of early human ancestors. The differences between recent apes and recent men even occur in the anatomical pattern of the human hand. According to our latest studies, differences in situation of muscular layers develop during hu- man ontogenesis. The fusion of two superimposed muscular layers form- ing the dorsal interossei (i.e., muscles executing fine movements of the fingers) occurs. Complete loss of the so-called layer of contra- hentes muscles in its ulnar sector is characteristic only of man (Cihak 1963). On the other hand, recent anthropomorphic apes possess two muscular layers (functioning as flexors) in place of man's dorsal interossei, and at least the rudiments of the whole contrahentes muscles layer. (Forster 1916). 7. In concluding my comment I should like to express my opinion that it is impossible to explain the development of tool-using in man solely from the comparative be- haviour evidence; i.e., from the standpoint of a single research field. I see the necessity of joining several standpoints; namely, developmental morphology, the comparative studies of physiology of the central nervous system based upon exact experi- ments, and consideration of mutual influences of social factors and tool- using in early evolution. From an integration of these multiple com- plex standpoints, it might be useful to try, retrospectively, to explain various observations of primate be- haviour and thereby gain more positive results. By R. DALE GIVENS* Richmond, Kentucky, U.S.A. 3.6.63 Since I am in essential agreement with K. R. L. Hall, there are only a few comments I wish to make: 1) It may be hoped that additional research will clarify even more the nature of tool using in nonhuman animals since the picture presented here is still far from clear, complete or well documented. This, however, is due more to the lack of data than to any fault of the author. Still, it seems somewhat premature to at- tempt to explain incipient tool using behavior as "only an elementary form of operant conditioning im- posed upon the agonistic repertoire of the species." Nor would such an explanation, if verified, make tool using phenomena any less important as a behavioral form of adaptation, as Hall seems to imply. 2) Hall considers the "use" of one chimpanzee by another to obtain a goal, such as, perhaps, food, as a case of tool using. Classifying social interaction of this type as tool using seems to me to assign too much to the latter concept and to confuse two totally different phenomena. If we follow Hall in this, we would have to call most social relation- ships, including those found among man, tool using. 3) In view of a recent news report of rudimentary tool making behav- ior among chimpanzees in the wild, it would appear that Hall's position requires modification. If the Jane Morris-Goodall findings reported in Newsweek (May 1963) are accurate, the behavior displayed, that of moistening the end of a stick with saliva to attract termites, can hard- ly be explained in terms of an extension of agonistic behavior; it is directly oriented toward food procurement. What Morris-Goodall's report and the present paper both indicate, however, is that the gap between early man and the higher primates is not much greater in re- gard to mental capabilities than it was already known to be for bio- logical characteristics. Leslie White notwithstanding, the distinction be- tween the mentality of human and nonhuman primates is a matter of degree and not a difference in kind. By HARRY F. HARLOW* Madison, Wisconsin, U.S.A. 10.6.63 I totally and highly approve of the article. By GORDON W. HEWES* Boulder, Colorado, U.S.A. 10.6.63 Chance (1960) calls attention to the role of the repertory of innate motor patterns in much of the seemingly insightful problemsolving observed in apes and monkeys, though insight cannot be wholly excluded. Primate tool-using prob- ably began in manipulatory behav- ior not directed toward any external goal. Rewarded manipulation, if re- peatedly successful in a given en- vironment-enhancing food supply or increasing security from enemies -could be expected to spread by social imitation to the rest of the local population. Hall does not refer to the Japanese macaque studies where behaviors analogous to inven- tion and diffusion of tool-using have been observed (Imanishi, 1960). Higher primates can learn vicarious- ly by observation of the actions of other individuals (Hall 1963) as any- one who has worked with them can testify. Endowed with this capacity to a very high degree, primates are "pre-adapted" to persistent, func- tional tool-using where environ- mental conditions make it biologi- cally rewarding. Monkeys approach some of the conditions of tool-preparation and tool-handling in their inspection, peeling, stripping, and other pre- liminary steps in the eating of wild plant foods. Such behavior is far more deliberate, and far more flexible than the nut-gnawing of squirrels, and is best seen when the monkey is confronted with an un- familiar plant which may have edible parts. Wild monkeys distin- guish carefully between food and containers, as in Kawamura's report of macaques extracting wheat grains from paper envelopes (1959:48 and Fig. 17). A stumptail macaque at the University of Colorado drinks from cups, opens paper boxes, and re- moves wrappings from any stray packages suspected of having edible contents. Cord-pulling is also part of the common motor repertory of mon- keys. It is evidently easier to pull a cord or stick toward the body to secure a desired object than to get at it by pushing something outward, away from the body. Such prefer- ences in basic motor patterns have undoubtedly affected the evolution of primtate tool-using. The primate hand is used regularly with precision not only for food preparation, and feeding, but also grooming. Hall does not mention grooming, nor has this been stressed by other writers on the subject of the emergence of tool-using in primates (Napier 1962, 1963). Macaques in grooming usually steady the body-part being worked on with one hand, while dextrously probing with the fingers of the other to the base of each hair or clump of hairs, opposing the ball of the thumb to the terminal phalange of the index finger. Transfer of the motor habits and psychological drive toward grooming, to the surface treatment of tool-objects-from decortication of twigs to the systematic removal of surface irregularities on chipped stone implements, and eventually even to tasks such as weeding, does not seem too far-fetched. Carrying of food, infants, and ob- jects usable as tools has also proba- Vol. 4 * No. 5 * December 1963 489</page><page sequence="12">bly been important. My own ideas as to the relation between Hominid bipedalism and tool-using (Hewes 1961) differ from those who see a direct relationship between incipient tool-using and bipedal locomotion. Washing of food, and other "ma- nlipulations" of water, have certain analogies to tool-using. The inven- tion of sweet-potato washing by a Japanese macaque, and its subsequent acceptance as a cultural trait in the entire troop is well known (Kawa- mura 1959 :Fig. 16). Our captive macaques regularly soak or dunk their hard biscuits before eating them. This would seem to be a step beyond merely peeling or husking, in the direction of more elaborate forms of food-preparation. On the topic of the "tool" use of water, I have observed gorillas at the Chey- enne Montain Zoo, U.S.A., using their fingers to direct a stream of water from their water-fountains toward spectators, and with great accuracy. The spectators are safely behind plate glass. Chimpanzees in the same zoo fill their mouths with water and send spurts toward on- lookers, in this case unprotected by glass. Under suitable environmental conditions, apes will use brushes and paints (Morris 1962) to achieve far more than random splashes of color. Although these behaviors do not occur in nature, they illustrate the kind of tool-using potential which is present in infrahuman primates. Hall notes that captive apes some- times drape themselves with sacking, etc., but that comparable behavior has not been observed in the wild; however, Schaller shows in a sketch a wild infant gorilla who had decked himself in a "green hat" of lobelia frond (1962:250 and Fig. 63F). Hall's major contribution to the study of tool-using among non- human primates is that it can arise spontaneously in agonistic behavior, as when apes *throw sticks or branches toward intruding humans. But it is hard to believe that this action would do more than tempo- rarily annoy a hungry carnivore. Its effectiveness might lie in another kind of situation: Hall observes that monkeys exhibit very strong aggres- sive responses when competitors prevent them from getting at food immediately present. If their com- petitors were members of their own troop, the usual dominance signals would be employed rather than stick-hurling. If however the com- peting eaters were-say, vultures working on a carcass, stick-throwing and stone-throwing by outraged and hungry primates might be the most effective way of driving the birds away. To be sure, modern apes and monkeys do not steal carrion away from vultures, but there are enough references to occasional meat-eating, hunting or killing of small, slow game, and even to winter hare- hunting (by members of one troop of Japanese macaques) to suggest that under some ecological condi- tions, even existing ape or monkey species might be capable of a more carnivorous regime than they are accustomed to. Scavenging of car- casses left by predators, as I sug- gested (Hewes 1961) would have provided for more agonistic missile- hurling as well as for increased transportation of food-burdens to places of greater safety. Napier (1963:16, Fig. 4, photo- graph by Jane Goodall) shows a chimpanzee preparing a thin stick or reed as a probe to extract termites from their nest. This is Napier's second stage of tool-using, in which the tool is modified. His first step is the ad hoc use of a convenient stick or stone, and his third stage is the making of tools to a pattern. Hall does not sufficiently distinguish be- tween the state of mind of aggres- sive stick-throwing and the delibe- rate selection and modification of a natural object as exemplified by this chimpanzee termite-extractor. It is the former, deliberate selection of a tool-as in the stones on the living floors in Olduvai Gorge, or the bones, etc. in the breccias of Maka- pansgat, rather than in the breaking off of a branch to annoy an intruder that sustained tool-using probably got its start. In connection with bones, captive macaques are capable of a considerable amount of bone- modification by slow gnawing. With no more goal than to obtain the maximum amount of marrow and chewable cartilage, our captive ma- caque can work a bone down to unusual and unnatural shape. This suggests that once a carnivorous habit had been stabilized, primate bone-handlers would be forever reshaping them through gnawing. The continuing human nervous habit of chewing the ends of implements is perhaps not altogether irrelevant. An object serving both as a tool and as something to chew on has a greater chance of being reused. Recent field studies of apes and monkeys have made it clear that their present living conditions do not impel them to much if any high-quality tool-using. However, it is not altogether impossible that before the rise to dominance of the genus Homo, some groups of apes ancestral to modern apes may have occupied environments in which more tool-using could have occurred, in ways contributing to their survi- val. This would parallel the situ- ation of certain recent human groups which have been forced into marginal, stone-less alluvial regions, where the entire lithic tradition has been abandoned (to be sure, other kinds of tools have persisted). I disagree with Hall's suggestion that the ease with which captive apes and monkeys acquire the use of tools together with their failure to exhibit this propensity in the wild "has no real significance." To me this is the most significant point of the whole discussion. Conditions of captivity provide tool-using oppor- tunities for these primates while their natural habitats do not. We regularly use tools not because of our impressively larger brains and adept hands, but because we have been trained in cultural environ- ments, in this respect analogous to the conditions of captivity for apes and monkeys. Feral human beings drawn from modern Homo sapiens populations, and living in the restricted, tool-less environments of gorillas and chimpanzees, or of ba- boons, would probably do hardly any better than these animals in developing tools and weapons. Our superior brains might accelerate the process of tool-development by a factor of two or three, so that an Acheulean technology could be achieved in two or three hundred thousand years instead of a million years or more. What we must explain then is the initial environmental "push", suf- ficient to stimulate tool-using among suitably endowed primates, and to sustain it through social learning from generation to generation. Stick hurling in anger appears less promis- ing than the reported palmnut cracking with rocks reported from Liberia. I see the conditions for take- off, in a changed food-habit, plus the adoption of relatively permanent bases of operation-rockshelters or living-floors. Dart has stressed the importance of osteodontokeratic litter in stimulating tool-using (1960); such accumulations of bones, horns, and teeth could arise from scavenging as well as from hunting, at least to begin with. Present forest environments used by anthropoid apes do not provide for semi-per- manent sanctuaries where trash suitable for tools could accumulate, though the Kwangsi Gigantopithe- cines evidently lived in caves. Aim- less tool-handling could be stimu- lated by residence in a trash-filled cave or shelter, but practical use of tools requires something more- most likely food in a form which must be crushed, pounded, cut, or broken before it can be consumed; the carcasses of medium to large sized animals represent such a food. The reconstruction of the ecological 490 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="13">Hall: TOOL-USING PERFORMANCES status of the primordial Hominids is most urgent (Napier 1963). To conclude, Hall's paper has stimulated me to suggest some large- scale and undoubtedly expensive experiments, utilizing apes and mon- keys in naturalistic environments, but not necessarily in environments identical to their ptesent habitats. In such environments, the animals would be provisioned with foods requiring special preparation-palm- nuts to be cracked with stones, car- casses to be dissected, or even small, slow game animals to be hunted and killed with regularity. We might even try out Washburn's suggestion of supplying baboons with digging sticks, in a range in which such tools would significantly increase their food supply. If the initiation of such behaviors in non-human primates required some deliberate training of selected individuals, this would violate no basic canon of scientific experimentation. If we are interested in the ramifications- technological as well as sociological -of regular tool-using in non- human Primates, we need not wait for fifty thousand years for some ape to discover a simple tool-tech- nique by himself. I have not commented on Hall's examples of non-primate tool-using, illuminating as they are, since I think our understanding of the emergence of human tool-using and tool-making is most likely to come from studies of primate behavior. By HARRY J. JERISON* Yellow Springs, Ohio, U.S.A. 12.6.63 When animal behavior is treated in purely evolutionary terms and limited to naturalistic field observa- tions, there is an inherent obstacle in the way of scaling the behavior to provide a measure of adaptability. This is due to the assumption im- plicit in evolutionary analysis that the present state of nature represents a peak of excellence for the measure, or, stated another way, that a given pattern of behavior that is observed in the field is the best that has been achieved for the adaptive niche within which the behavior occurs. It seems to me that Hall's analysis of tool-using as a measure of adapta- bility illustrates the problem very well. If I read him correctly, he finds that tool-using, when it occurs in the field, is a rare behavioral adaptation to selection pressures associated with particular niches in the environment, and that the very category, "tool-using," is no more than an anthropomorphically de- rived identity for behaviors that may differ radically in their bases. In presenting his interesting 4nd in many ways original review of tool-using, Hall has eliminated this superficial category of behavior from serious consideration as a measure of adaptability. Yet it seems fair to ask him to state his views on the nature of appropriate measures, and, if possible, to suggest some examples of behavior categories that would provide such measures. Is it true, as I have just suggested, that the species-specific nature of much of the behavior that can be observed in the field limits the potential of such behavior for comparative pur- poses? I think a persuasive argument can be made for this position. Hall's review suggests that, at least in some primates, novel tool-using be- havior patterns appear in the un- usual environments of laboratories and zoos, and is not the frequency of novel and adequate responses to new situations one of the definitions of adaptability? One might therefore study adaptability profitably in laboratory settings where novel responses, including tool-using, might provide an appropriate com- parative measure. This is a treacherous position, too. I recall my own dismay when work- ing with a very well trained Java monkey (Macaca irus) that had to reach through a window and press a lever to avoid or escape a shock after an easily detected signal was presented. Pressing a lever is a classic "instrumental" act in the psychologi- cal laboratory, and it is clearly a bit of tool-using-or is it? In this case I found that when the clearly visible lever was moved back about 2 cm, this was enough to disrupt the animal completely. The monkey went through all of its usual response movements, but it missed the lever every time, because it failed to correct for the new lever dis- tance. One must conclude that at least some "tool-using" in the labo- ratory as well as in the field is the result of the interaction of stereo- typed (even if learned) movements with movable objects. These comments are less on tool- using, which is apparently a weak descriptive category for animal be- havior, than on the problem of de- fining and measuring adaptability. I would appreciate additional discus- sion of this problem. By ARTHUR J. RIOPELLE* Covington, La, U.S.A. 11.6.63 Tool-using by animals has fasci- nated behavioral scientists for many years. Particularly perplexing has been an apparent comparability of behavior in even widely divergent orders of animals. This is -nicely illustrated in this paper by Hall who juxtaposes examples from wasps, crabs, birds, elephants, monkeys and apes. Historically, explanations of this apparent common trait have emphasized either instinct or intelli- gence. In one case the task is to explain how high up the phyletic chain one sees evidence for instinc- tive behavior and in the other case how much intelligence and insight is possessed by primitive animals. The popularity of these alternate views has fluctuated from decade to decade, depending on the dramatic strenght of the latest data in favor of one viewpoint or the other and with the temper of observations in related sciences. Similarities and parallels can often be found in different behaviors and in the approaches to the study of them, and the conceptualization of the proper approach in one may be helpful in the other. Imitation and observational learning are cases in point. (Interesting enough, obser- vational learning, too, has engaged Hall's attention). The kinds of behavior that may be classified as imitative are as diverse as the kinds called tool- using. Many factors likely are in- volved, including the identification of the native elemental responses, the diversity of responses available, the situation surrounding the response, and the motivation and learning components. Thorndike in 1898 stated the task for studying imitation: "Now if a bird really gets a sound in his mind from hearing it and sets out forthwith to imitate as mocking birds are said at times to do, it is a mystery and deserves the closest study. If a bird, out of a lot of random noises that it makes, chooses those for repetition which are like sounds he has heard, it is a mystery why, though not in the previous case a mystery how, he does it." (Thorn- dike 1898) Hall's paper identifies similar components of the problem of tool- using. All species, because of innate response capabilities, are predisposed to execute certain kinds of responses rather than others. (Here Hall is more restrictive than Thorndike). Out of the responses that are made, some lead to reinforcement, satis- faction, and gratification, whereas other do not. Those reinforced will tend to be repeated. Thus Hall has taken Thorndike's less mysterious route to search for an explanation of the behavior he and other have observed. Hall's report, like Thorndike's before him. is nerhains less~ o-fa Vol. 4 * No. 5 * December 1963 491</page><page sequence="14">explanation of tool-using behavior than an identification of the signif- icant components of it. It, naturally, goes beyond Thorndike in its use of concepts, such as displacement ac- tivity, which were not available in 1898. It is to be hoped, therefore, that Hall's report will stimulate experimental work on tool-using be- havior just as Thorndike's did for imitation. There is another emphasis in the paper which deserves mention, and that is the breadth of the sources of literature cited. Tool-using is evidently that kind of animal ac- tivity which brings together scien- tists of differing orientation and thus serves as a vehicle for the transport of ideas among them. One cannot help but observe that such communication broadens our sciences and sharpens our concepts. Hall's study will further this process. By J. P. SCOTT* Bar Harbor, Maine, U.S.A. 5.6.63 This is an excellent review of the subject and points out the fact that it is difficult to draw a line any- where in the animal kingdom which will strictly separate human from non-human behavior. The following remarks are intended as addenda rather than criticism. A distinction should be made between instances where tool-using is a part of the regular behavioral repertory of a species, and cases where such behavior can be learned and passed along from individual to individual by some form of cul- tural inheritance, the latter being the more human attribute. How- ever, simple observation does not reveal which of these two alternate explanations of behavior applies to any particular case. The use of stones in cracking mussel shells by the sea otter might belong in either category until it is possible to experiment with animals which have not had an opportunity to learn from their own kind. A great many animals are capable of instrumental learning; i.e., of performing certain acts, obtaining a result which is rewarding to them and consequently learning to repeat the activity. No high degree of intelligence or capacity for symbolic logic is necessary. The likelihood of learning to use tools under these circumstances is largely dependent upon the species' ability to manip- ulate objects. Instrumental learning may have a variety of motivations besides the two basic ones suggested by Hall in connection with agonistic and ingestive behavior. Captive chim- panzees at Yerkes Laboratories used to squirt water and throw feces at passing spectators with considerable accuracy. While the motivation may have been agonistic, it may also have resulted from the simple pleasure of watching the spectators jump and yell. In general, Hall has shown that tool-using is not a unique human capacity. Rather, human societies excel, but are not unique, in their capacity to communicate tool-using by cultural means. In our search for the beginnings of cultural heredity in other forms, we should not neglect the opposite side of the coin, that human behavior may include a basic repertory of patterns whose development is largely under biolog- ical control. By S. L. WASHBURN* Berkeley, California, U.S.A. 22.5.63 This paper clarifies a confused subject and offers what may well prove to be a major contribution to the understanding of human evolu- tion. The clear separation of objects used in emotional display behavior from those used in feeding is new and important. I would like to com- ment briefly on how this supple- ments available notions on the origins of human tool-using. In both chimpanzee and gorilla (as described by Morris-Goodall [in press] and Schaller 1936) the emo- tional-display throwing occurs when the animals are bipedal and on the ground. In particular the chimpanzee may break off a branch and swing it vigorously as part of the display (Morris-Goodall). The animal does not try to strike the creature against whom the display is directed, but this might easily happen. Here then is a situation in which apes might repeatedly discover the effectiveness of striking with an object. As a part of the aggressive display the branch is effective whether it strikes an- other animal or not. Here is a rela- tively common situation in which the utility of a tool, both offensively and defensively, might be learned. I have always wondered about the first steps in the evolution of a weapon. Unless a stick is well- selected and skillfully used an ape's teeth are far more effective. The agonistic-display origin of weapons solves this dilemma because, if the display fails, the ape still may fight or flee. The selection pressure main- taining the large teeth would not be relaxed until after the swinging- branch display had evolved into ef- fective behavior. If young apes in- corporated this bipedal, object-using display into their play repertoire, a background for skillful adult use would be laid. I see no conflict between the "emotional" use of objects theory and continuing to stress the importance of even minor tool use in extending feeding habits. Surely the more dif- ferent reasons objects are manipu- lated, the more likely it is that new uses will befound and skills developed. Future field observations and experi- ments, guided by Hall's clarification, may give us a much deeper under- standing of the possible origins of human tool making. By J. S. WEINER* London. 16.5.63 Hall draws attention to and dis- cusses the apparent paucity of evi- dence. of "tool-using" activities by non-human primates in the wild in contrast to the many instances re- corded for captive animals. One of the two factors he puts forward to account for this discrepancy is simply that the systematic field evidence is missing and he mentions specifically here the ignorance of details on the feeding habits of Ce- bus. I claim no first-hand or special knowledge of this topic, but it seems to me that in the case of Cebus fatuellus the evidence for similar tool-using activities in the wild and in captivity is not so undocumented as Hall suggests. I had occasion to describe some of the "hammering" activities of Cebus fatuellus at the Primate Symposium in London when making some comments on a film supplied by G. M. Vevers to show the use of a tool by a Capuchin monkey (Vevers and Weiner, 1963). I was interested to find fairly de- tailed references to rather similar activity in descriptions given by Ro- manes (1882) and by Osman Hill (1960) for both captive and wild monkeys. I would add that instances of this sort of tool-using in the wild, and of others mentioned by Hall, do not in any way refute the gener- alization for which I think he has made a very strong case, namely that the basis of the handling of various objects is to be found in the transfer of the "emotional" reper- toire of gesture to a different con- text. The importance of the Cebus example would be that it marks a particular case of such a transfer. 492 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="15">Hall: TOOL-USING PERFORMANCES Reply by K. R. L. HALL* Several very interesting points are made in these comments, and I shall select a few for more detailed dis- cussion. First, the question of terminology used in describing these, and other, performances is a recurrently difficult and important one. Cih'ak queries the use of "homology" in the present context, but I think it is here appropriate because the point I was trying to emphasize was, to para- phrase Jerison's very clear expression of it, that tool-using has been a classificatory term for similar-un- appearing performances the under- lying bases of which may be radically different, but that the term has often been used with the implication of common origin. Analogies, therefore, they indeed are, but homologies they have been implied to be. Carpenter deals with the terms used in describing the nature and status of the performances, and in drawing inferences from their descrip- tion. Possibly "elementary" or "simple" would be less equivocal qualifiers of some of the instrumental acts under discussion, but I used the term "primitive" in this context because, so far as I recall, it was the one Carpenter himself has used in describing branch-breaking or some other such emotional gesture. As to the status of these acts, it is still surely correct to apply the simplest kind of model that fits the evidence, and there is no denial of the possibility of purpose or insight or some other "higher" conception being involved in some cases. The status of perform- ances such as those of chimpanzees in using tools for food-getting is cer- tainly more intelligent, and less emotional, than the display acts which these and other nonhuman primates show in the offensive- defensive kind of situation. But, as the theme of the paper tries to indicate, these more complex per- formances may be shown to derive, both ontogenetically and phylo- genetically, from the simple emotional ones, in the kind of way Washburn has interestingly envisaged weapon- use might have developed. A second major that seems to me to arise out of several comments is the need for thorough comparative studies of behavior ontogeny. Scott indicates that such studies would be essential to substantiate, or otherwise, the suggestion that emotional gestures precede and form the basis for trans- fer to the more complex skills some- times shown in food-getting. Scott also points out that only experimental studies could really distinguish be- tween the status of tool-using per- formances by different types of animal, and these, I think, would have to be mainly developmental, and carried out under varying condi- tions that would test the limits of the animals capacities. Thirdly, and leading directly on from this, is the important point which Riopelle and Hewes discuss -how the skill involved in tool- using may be transmitted within a group, or from group to group in a population area. Hewes mentions the Japanese work on habit transmission in their Macaque groups, and, in my review elsewhere of this and other field and experimental data on imita- tion in monkeys and apes I thought that it was difficult clearly to show that anything more was occurring than a focussing of one animal's attention upon some object in the environment which, at least tempo- rarily, it was ignoring. It seemed to me very doubtful whether anything new in the repertoire of skills of the observing animal ever has been convincingly shown to occur, and yet, at the same time, I feel that this whole fascinating problem of imita- tion needs perhaps a rather different research approach, particularly by exploring very throughly what it is that really goes on in the constant interactions of infant and mother and age-mates in the natural group situ- ation of the animal. In watching sea otter pups with their mothers, one cannot fail to be impressed by the closeness of the relation and by the continual opportunity for the pup to observe what the mother is doing in her search for and manipulation of food objects. But with Scott I see no way of getting at the core of the problem except by experimental study. A fourth point, concerning the nature of adaptability, is very well brought out in the comments of Andrew and Jerison. Jerison seems to me to go right to the heart of perhaps the major issue in modern comparative behavior studies in posing the question of how to define and measure adaptability. In terms of tool-using, chimpanzees seem easily to excel baboons. In terms of ability to make use of widely differing habitats and climatic zones, baboons, and perhaps vervets, are more succesful than chimpanzees. Likewise, the sea otters might be considered the marine counterpart of the chimpanzee, and no doubt there is a Mustelid equivalent to baboons. In terms of laboratory measures, it seems clear that far too much em- phasis has been placed upon perform- ance scores which are not related to the sort of adaptability shown by the animal in the wild. Although there is obvious interest in seeing how an animal deals with a novel situation, it seems to me most likely that the animal studies that will give significant leads towards under- standing some of the factors in human evolution will be planned to work out how the stresses of differing social and ecological settings affect the development of behavior. All this goes around the topic of tool- using, but I think it may put tool- using in the right perspective as possibly only a minor clue too close a look at which has stopped us seeing some of the major ones.
