<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS The Philosophical Bases of Education, by R. R. RuSK. London, The University of London Press, and Boston, Houghton Mifflin Company, 1928, 205 pages. The author of this little readable book is "principal lecturer in edu- cation to the Glasgow Provincial Committee for the Training of Teach- ers"; also "examiner in education to the University of Glasgow." He received his doctor's degree from Jena. Among the books he has written also appear Doctrines of the Great Educators, Experimental Education, The Religious Education of the Child, and The Training of Teachers in Scotland. The volume before us has the welcome aim of directing the present revival of interest in the "philosophy of education" along "more strictly philosophical lines." The subject matter is presented in six chapters dealing with the need for a philosophy of education, the schools of philos- ophy, naturalism, pragmatism, and idealism, in education, concluding with a historical review of idealism. There are also short bibliographies and indices. This is a useful text for purposes of reference. It is surprising that a Scotch metaphysical thinker, even in the field of education, should not be more systematic and comprehensive. There is no treatment of real- ism as one of the current philosophies with educational implications. And the historical sketch of idealism omits the medieval period and the modern British thinkers, such as T. H. Green, the Cairds, Bosanquet, and Lord Haldane. There is too great looseness of definition when such diverse thinkers as Comenius and Rousseau can be called idealists. Comenius is an anthropomorphic theist and Rousseau is a deist. The char- acteristic emphasis of idealism in the priorty of consciousness and modern forms of idealism is monistic. The author adopts the "idealistic" stand- point, but for the reasons indicated idealism is not made winsome. The author expects much of a philosophy of education, perhaps not too much: "A coordinating, if not a determining principle, is requisite, if we are not to be lost in the maze of modern developments, and such a principle can only be furnished by a philosophy of the subject" (p. 13). The author's criticism of the reviewer's position (pp. 202, 204, 205) is gratefully acknowledged. HERMAN H. HORNE</page></plain_text>
