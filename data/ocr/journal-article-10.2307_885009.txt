<plain_text><page sequence="1">Exhibition Reviews London, British Museum Anglo-Saxon Art Writing about 'The New Learning' in the catalogue' of the exhibition The Mak- ing of England, currently on show at the British Museum (to 8th March), Michael Lapidge points out just 'how fragile even the most remarkable achievements in the field of education may be'. This is true of the remains of early medieval English cul- ture generally; in the face of war, spoliation, religious bigotry, the passage of time, and sheer bad luck, the evidence for English civilisation between AD 600 and 900 often hangs on a mere thread. For example, in the exhibition we can see the single surviving copy of the epic poem Beowulf (cat.no.4), and one of the only two surviving copies of the biography of the great bishop and art patron St Wilfrid (no.95). The fire in the Cotton Library in 1731 either completely destroyed, or scorched and blackened, the pictures in an already fragmented Gospel Book of around 700 (nos.83a-b). Happily the cultural heritage has had its friends as well as its enemies. A vividly decorative eighteenth-century coloured copy of a largely destroyed page from this same Gospel Book is on view here (no.83c); its discovery is greatly to the credit of Janet Backhouse. In the final room in the exhi- bition a pair of sixteenth-century transcripts of Asser's Life of King Alfred and of Alfred's great administrative and defence system, the Burghal Hidage (nos.234 and 241), alone preserve the contents of destroyed exemplars. Honour might have been paid in the exhibition to the diligence of two other antiquaries, Thomas of Elmham, whose History of St Augustine's, Canter- bury (Cambridge, Trinity Hall MS 1) con- tains an impressive plan of the choir of St Augustine's Abbey in the fifteenth century, with the collection of books reputed to have been sent to Englan d by Pope St Gregory I still safe and sound above the high altar. The second missing antiquary is John Leland, who reports seeing the treasures of St Augustine's still intact in the 1530s, and who on a visit to pre- 'Reformation' Jarrow was shown St Bede's portable altar, made of'serpentine'.

But omissions will certainly not be upper- most in the visitor's mind. This reviewer went holding a check-list for an exhibition From Raedwald to Alfred planned by himself and Peter Clemoes to coincide with the 1985 ISAS Conference at Cambridge, which never got off the ground for lack of sponsor- ship. Everything that we wanted to bring together, and much else besides, is now on view in London, and all this marvellous material has been laid out with great in- telligence and sensibility. After crossing the pagan-Christian Rubicon, the visitor approaches the 'big' items of Northumbrian art through a room decked with exquisite small items of glass and metal, fascinating shards from three comparatively unknown sites, Brandon, Barking and Flixborough, where social life, religion, and art, once flourished abundantly. As well as jewellery and writing instruments, Flixborough has yielded up a lead plaque recording the names of members of the religious com- munity, torn from some notice board or .... ............. ............. ........... ...................... ........ ..... ..........

A useful comparative piece here would have been the nun Rotsuintda's bone plaque in the Trier Landesmuseum which vouches for the Anglo-Saxon presence in Echternach and district. It is inscribed in the angular Lindisfarne display script which evidently lies beneath the present inscription on the Flixborough plaque. Also Rotsuintda's bad Latin might have helped shore up the new reading of the inscription on the Pictish scabbard chape (no.178a) proposed in the catalogue. The exhibition's display scores over the catalogue record in respect of the Brandon items (nos.66a-y) by putting up beside them an aerial photograph which reveals the site of the early monastery as originally an island. Cross fertilisation from one artistic medium to another is strikingly shown by the Brandon finds. The pins compare well, for example, with the stem of the initial 'q' in the nearby Corpus Glossary (no.63). The catalogue rightly notes that exactly the same goggle-eyed creatures decorating a disc-headed pin are found drawn on the pages of the Rome Gospels (no.160). From Brandon also comes a little gold plaque, inlaid with a bust-length St John the Evangelist (no.66a). He has neat man's shoulders, hands and clothes, but an eagle's head. This same conflation of man and animal runs on into quirky satirical licence in the bull-man and the lion-man of the 77. 1 77. Herebericht cross-slab. Monkwearmouth, Tyne and Wear.

Probably the designer of the Book of Cerne (no.165), when he carefully differentiated between the Evangelist and his animal symbol, was less concerned to provide data for some 'religious ceremonial' than to avoid the pitfalls of zoo-anthropomorphism. Small as the Brandon plaque is, the prize for miniaturisation must surely go to the Bamburgh beast (no.45), in one of the show-cases dedicated to 'The Developing State'. On such a minute scale his trim vigour is astonishing. It is a pity that his big brothers in the St John page of the Book of Durrow could not have come tem- porarily home again to keep him company. Another Northumbrian masterpiece, but on quite a different scale, is the memorial stone of the priest Herebericht, on display in the section on 'The New Learning' (no.72; Fig.77). Its excellently chiselled letters are of noble shape and proportion. The beauty and usefulness of script is one of the memorable features of this exhi- bition. In the Vespasian Psalter's miniature of David composing the Psalms, one of his clerks is represented at work with a stylus on his writing tablets (no.153). Rare examples of actual writing tablets are also on show here, a leaf from a site in Suffolk (no.65), and the tablets from Springmount Bog, County Antrim, which miraculously still preserve some psalm texts, scratched on the wax (no.64). The catalogue entry suggests that these were a trainee-priest's tools in the process of rote learning the psalms. Verses 8-10 of Psalm 31 (32 AV) incised on the Springmount Bog tablet, are surely the perfect words for a school- master to dictate to his pupils. In the section on 'The Northumbrian Church' the relics of St Cuthbert, the leather- bound copy of StJohn's Gospel, intimately connected with his cult (no.86), and his own portable altar and pectoral cross (nos.98-99), are felicitously placed opposite the Lindisfarne Gospels (no.80) and the other most famous Northumbrian manu- scripts. In this strong visual context it is interesting to observe how the eagle symbol in Corpus MS.197B (no.83b) keeps its Pictish idiom pretty well intact and so stands apart from all other images displayed in the exhibition, except perhaps the wolves and the horse on the Franks Casket (no.70). The big pages from Ceolfrid's other pandect (no.87a-b) help to body out the Codex Amiatinus, the central achievement of the monks of Jarrow, itself represented only by two photographs and a rather humdrum catalogue entry (no.88). The photograph of Amiatinus's dedication page with its text contained under an arch should at least warn us against supposing that the designer of the Quoniam Quidem page of Royal MS I.E.6 (no.171)really needed a Carolingian Court School MS to suggest lay-out to him. Instead of the often illustrated Ezra, a photograph of Amiatinus's uniquely large plan of the Jewish tabernacle would have helped to emphasise the antiquarian, edit- orial, and epigraphic talents of the Jarrow monks. Its large scale could have evoked the panel paintings we hear about from Bede but have totally lost. Given such a presence of Amiatinus's tabernacle in the exhibition, the catalogue entry on Bede's treatise De tabernaculo might have been made more sharply focused and informa- tive (no.62). The precious finds from Whitby are the Northumbrian equivalent of the new Brandon material. The bust-length figure on the glass imitation jewel (no.107k) is tentatively identified as a beardless Christ but to this reviewer's eye he has more the look of those well-nourished personifications of the seasons in the Calendar of354. Despite the acknowledgement of late-antique ele- ments present in Amiatinus, the Lindisfarne Gospels, and the Franks Casket, the bias of this exhibition is towards the now familiar north-south divide, at the Humber. Pure Insular art is Northumbrian (or Irish) whereas Southumbria goes 'predictably' along the Roman path. The great centre- pieces of the exhibition, truly thrilling to see back in England, are the Rome Gospels (no. 160), and the Stockholm Codex Aureus (no.154; Fig.78). The former, it is argued in the catalogue, should not be credited, as is sometimes done, to York, in spite of its acknowledged parallels in the Westmorland Ormside Bowl (no.134) and the unmen- tioned, even more striking, resemblance of its plant forms to foliage and interlace at Bewcastle and Hexham. The classicising taste that it exhibits is 'more prevalent... within Southumbria'. In the catalogue Simon Keynes's warning is timely, that 'Northumbrian churches retained their libraries and cherished their traditions'. Yet the assumption in many of the cata- logue entries is that by the mid-eighth century the north was played out; also be- cause no books of seventh-century manu- facture have survived from the south, nothing was done there until later. So the Vespasian Psalter, dated here c.725, is said 'to forge a new Southumbrian style', which 'absorbed elements of Hiberno-Saxon art' (no.153). The catalogue entry on the Genoels- Elderen ivory plaques (no.141; their presence in London is another outstanding coup of the exhibition's organisers) is not daunted by, indeed emphasises, the low survival rate of works in this period. Given the widespread loss it seems rash to state that 'The extensive use of gold and silver would appear to represent a distinctively Southumbrian response to Byzantine manu- scripts.' Again the voice of Amiatinus needed to be heard. Copies of St Wilfrid's biography survived in vain if weight is not given to its crucial record of the four gospels in letters of pure gold on purpled vellum made at Wilfrid's orders for Ripon. Who can tell if the In principio page of the Codex Aureus, its scintillating gold letters laid on parchment coloured a deep apricot, is not directly descended from its equivalent in Wilfrid's lost Gospels? The Stockholm Codex Aureus might well represent the single finest achievement of the Insular tradition, 'north' and 'south' on the same track, balanced and mature. The handling of trumpet spirals in the Vespasian Psalter and the Codex Aureus is full of life but sophisticated and tidy - simply a stage the motif has reached. It is at the same stage in one of the domed mounts from St Ninian's Isle, Orkney. If that, like the St Ninian's Isle sword-pommel exhibited here (no.177), could be 'an actual import' of English manufacture, did it come from Northumbria or Southumbria? The exhibition gives its visitors a unique opportunity to compare and reassess at close quarters the finest works that have survived from early medieval England. Criss-crossing these rooms, one can piece together the contacts and continuity of the period, linking for example a recently- found interlaced tag from Flixborough (no.69b) with the long-famous Witham pins (no.184), or a glass oval decorated with step patterns from St Wilfrid's York (no.108e) with the corner panels on the opening page of the Cologne Canons (no. 126). The value of the exhibition as a probing and creative exercise is well sum- med up in the revelatory juxtapostion of a group of torn metal strips and bosses from Dumfriesshire (no. 135) with a replica of the great Rupertus Cross at Bischofshofen (no.133; Fig.79). Through the perspicacity of Leslie Webster these fragments of sheet metal are reintegrated and stand up again in one's imagination as a grand portable or altar cross, once the focus of devotion of a living community.
