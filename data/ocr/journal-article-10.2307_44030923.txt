<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Book Inside The Book Mireille Calle-Gruber What is the book, of which the main character is the book? More precisely, not a book but this book that readers hold in their hands? Hélène Cixous calls it 'the Coming [le Venant ]. Of a progressive form, a present participle, it starts with the letter of speed [la Vitesse] and of vision [la Vision] . Is this an allegory? A proper name? Is this the name that is taken by the form of movement, when the language of a common place becomes a singular dream? A dream of singular stories - since in the shady zone where they appear, these stories contain the stuff of a dream: its tenacity, its freedom, its clairvoyance. They run and talk. She calls it. Or does she? Is it not, rather, the book that calls? Calls her to write it? Puts her to the work of the word [le Verbe] ? At issue, no doubt, is less the book in the book of measurable dimensions, than in the flight of a writing that throws itself, that addresses and misaddresses, that enters into mystery, that expands at the verge of abysses, and that runs ahead of itself. At point zero, the book - thing, cause, origin - inscribes two postulates: that the book is an occurrence of dust; that the book becomes earth. The Book as an Occurrence of Dust I borrow the expression from Jean-François Lyotard, who formulates as follows his suggestion about the use of pastel in the work of Pierre Skira: 'The colour is an occurrence of dust' when he paints with sticks of pastel dust'.1 Likewise, it seems that for Hélène Cixous, to write with the dust of diluted ink that deposits on the page - where an entire process is underway: ink stick, ink stone, powder, aqueous dilution - is to bring forth forms, objects, ideas from... nothing, or nearly: a pulverulence, a friability, which one often forgets are consti-</page><page sequence="2">72 Oxford Literary Review tutive of the text. It is the before-the-book, the before-the-text. It is the possibility - to be realized, to be enacted - of elementary deposits. Radical dust, black powder, surfaces to write on, drop by drop and drying, leaves scattered: the book, in this way, takes root. In the book, the finished product - that is to say, the object assembled and bound, a volume the size of the hand, sized for the hand - Hélène Cixous leaves traces of deposits, of deposition. It is the word, where this truth of the book is already inscribed: it deposes, it witnesses, it is in court, it is forum and court. To leave traces of deposit is, for the writer, not to overshadow a certain physics of writing, where the immaterial materiality of the book is constituted in its fictions. An emergence of touches of tact, the moment of hesitation, a trembling. That which accedes to the breathing of the language that one hears, for example, in the following passage of Le Jour buje nétais pas là {The Day I Wasn't There). This is a text in which the seen and the read are in disjunction, where the seen does not take hearing into account, nor hearing the seen, where one must read with the eyes, the ears, the mouth, and write loudly: Que faire J'ai abandonné J'ai été abandonné Et c'est cela qui nous a toujours abandonnés. - La Réponse - (...) Déjà quand j'avais trois ans, à Oran, Qu'est-ce que j'aurais dû su pu tu vu alors que déjà j'étais athée sur la terre criant pendant un quart d'heure sans interruption le cri pourquoi m'as-tu abandonné. Je ressemblais d'avance à rien qu'un fox à trois pattes (...) n'avoir que trois pattes sur quatre est-ce un crime à force de chasser la pensée - dois-je aller chercher le chien - mon coeur a basculé en arrière - en avant - en arrière - en arrière - pendant une minute entière -2</page><page sequence="3">Mireille Calle-Gruber 73 (What to do I have abandoned I have been abandoned And that is what has always abandoned us. - The Response - (...) Already when I was three years old, at Oran, What should, would, could I, have known, killed, seen when already I was an atheist on the earth crying without interruption for quarter of an hour the cry, why have you abandoned me. I resembled nothing even then but a dog with three legs (...) to have only three of four legs, is it a crime by dint of hunting thought - must I go look for the dog - my heart tipped over backwards - forwards - backwards backwards - for a whole minute -') The whole full of divisions, the interior margin, the syncope of the sentence, the white line that disrupts the syntax, accelerates it, cuts it, the laceration of the line of writing by dashes that make a scarification - these are so many mechanisms of the writing that hold it on the side of suspense, of un-measure [la dé-mesure ] (for there are several metres: lined prose, verse, syntagm, syllabization, echolalia), on the side of the un-sewn, as we say, or rather, of the not yet sewn together. It is the book nevertheless : the woven text, altered, but not without the tacking, the stitches, the overcast seams. It constrains the reader to 'unsew' it with fully fabricated expressions, with the ready-to-think [le prêt-à- penser' . This book dust, not only guarded - safeguarded - but also consti- tutive of the accomplished book, is of the same artistic order as the non finito' of the stone, the marble statues, of Michelangelo: his Slaves , notably, where the polished (and policed) forms of the body are side by side with segments of material that is still rough, or showing the only chisel marks - Slaves seeming to free themselves from the</page><page sequence="4">74 Mireille Calle-Gruber tradition in which everything that treats of the human, that is a trait of the human, immediately includes a meditation on life and death, on 'last things'. The book is a memento mori , the eternity of the work steeped in the ephemeral. The Vanity-book is the complete opposite of the vain book, the monumental book, edified, edifying. It is the book of days: the book of the dying of the living. It stands upright, but rests on (a) nothing. It is the renewed miracle of literature. The Book Becomes Earth The Cixousian book plants the narrative in full compost, that of the garden which has for a long time been a recurrent motif and metaphor of writing at work. La , written in 1976, offers an exemplary narrative of the generative powers of this 'real garden that is literature:4 Où j'ai été assemblée, mot à mot, composée, choisie, chaque doigt, chaque fil, chaque pierre exacte, chauffée, rayée, façonnée, par des puissances passionnées patientes. Appris ďabord à lire, à être lue, à être entièrement en jouissance dans chaque lettre séparée, dans chaque éclat, pour chaque infime partie de terre, de corps, de peau, entrer et sortir d'elle par d'innombrables pores. Et pulluler. (...) Eté aimée: écrite. Mes premiers textes animaux, sans points, sans mort, sans repos, imprimés sur mon univers sans je dans ce jardin. (...) J'ai été terre avec les terres.

Taught at first to read, to be read, to be entirely at play [en jouissance ] in each separate letter, in each flash, for each minute part of earth, of</page><page sequence="5">Oxford Literary Review 75 material itself. Similarly, Hélène Cixous' un- or 'de-written passages are not unfinished (unworked pieces) but a form of the art of the unfinished, the unfinished as art, art in the forge and in the mould. This technique, which shows the work to the work, at the same time makes it possible to see the fragility. It provides the keys to its deconstruction, its intrinsic pulverization. Characteristic, in this regard, is the composition in multiple entries of Les reveries de la femme sauvage {Reveries of the Wild Woman) and Le jour où je netais pas là ( The Day / Wasn't There), with the inscription of passwords to each section, the capital letters that entitle, opening the text anew - like the doors of the book, as though the reading opened upon the book. There is also the work of white cuts within the narrative continuum, giving rise to effects of scansion, of respiration, but also effecting a recall of the initial whiteness, of the paperiness, and the emergence of script at each return. The multiplication of the incipit and the excipit designate so many sites of raising up [ exhausse- ment ], where the narrative elevates the voice: sites of larger vision where the story speaks in a higher tone. The book that is an occurrence of dust is at the same time parabola and archaeology. The parabolic book is the book that is larger than itself, incorporating within itself other books, and those that are yet to come. But the Cixousian book also includes its own archive, the imprints of its coming, of its trial before becoming a' book to be published. The reader, of course, does not consider all this from the outset, but takes in the effects without knowing: effects of a non-authoritarian writing operative in place of uncertainty, of disturbance, and of changeability. A writing that shakes up a prioris and prejudices, endeavours to separate, where narrative logic aims to repair. Since to speak repairs: logical reason, linking, and grammatical articulation tend to solidify narratives. They can give a coherence, a 'reason, to what is most dreadful. The writer mistrusts these complacencies that are the idleness of thought; her writing disrupts codes and conven- tions, shatters the book of its (re)assurances. Separate-repair, repair- separate, such is the meantime in which the book works when it does not forget that it is a body of dust doomed, like the human, to dust. The book is a parabola of being.3 In truth, this book is a Vanity . It revives an artistic and philosophical</page><page sequence="6">76 Oxford Literary Review body, of skin, to enter and to leave through innumerable pores. And to pullulate. (...)

I am a body that has come 'jout' with creation. It would be best to consider, word for word, the narrative thrust of this fragment, inscribed under the title of ' Portée de l'inconnue ('Reach of the unknown [one]').6 The place of life, the garden of the text is oxymoronic. It produces not knowledge but fore-knowledge [pre- science ] and un/born-knowledge [ né-science ]. It is the earthly Paradise before Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit of the tree of knowledge. This 'real garden makes it known that there is the unknowable 0 ce qui reste inconnu) and loss éperdu) - that there is dispossession, separation (' coupé), withdrawal. But also ahead, beforehand, a here- and-now: in the language, in the present of the narration that makes (a) present each time again. It does not forget the forgetting, retains traces of loss, marks of effacement. The 'real' garden is a matrix, a memory of the absenting. It is a fostering tie, and sets in motion the assemblage of the subject. Où j'ai été assemblée, mot à mot, composée, choisie, chaque doigt, chaque fil, chaque pierre exacte, chauffée, rayée, façonnée, par des puissances passionnées patientes. Where I have been assembled, word for word, composed, chosen, each finger, each thread, each exact stone, heated, lined, shaped, by passionate, patient powers. Enumeration confers a singular syntactic liberty, as though the sentence could, at any moment, grow (move, expand, push the meaning) in an entirely different direction. The writing, all the while</page><page sequence="7">Mireille Calle-Gruber 77 attending to the articulation, works to unlink the line from a univocal teleology. The paradigmatic dimension overflows the syntagmatic; the sentence runs laterally, grows offshoots i^mot à moi , ' composée ', ' chauffée ), proceeds through alliteration (' puissances passionnées patientes ). Connections and disconnections inscribe it in a principle of ramification. The sentence is a type of rhizome. Hyperbaton, addition, adjacence, anaphora all become widespread to the point of imprinting on the text a principle of supplementation, and the momentum of a passion. There comes into being a circulation that propels the passage, the exchange of kingdoms: human, vegetable, mineral Çdoigt/fil/pierré). The garden gives expression to a vital exuberance - plural but also particular, in rapidity and duration. It is heterogeneous but not disordered, effusion but not confusion. It is movement that not only plants and grows, but supplants: all categor- ical borders, all classificatory limits. The garden gives expression. That is to say, life. Appris d'abord à lire, à être lue, à être entièrement en jouissance dans chaque lettre séparée, dans chaque éclat, pour chaque infime partie de terre, de corps, de peau, entrer et sortir d'elle par d'innombrables pores. Et pulluler. Taught at first to read, to be read, to be entirely at play [en jouissance ] in each separate letter, in each flash, for each minute part of earth, of body, of skin, to enter and to leave through innumerable pores. And to pullulate. The effusion becomes panic, passing from element to entirety and vice versa. The sentence is cut off, elliptical, by apocope of the subject of enunciation. For 'I' is no longer the centre, nor the reference, nor the position of mastery: it is part and parcel of the whole, is part of, parts, departs from [est pary part, se départ de ]. The text endlessly declines being part of and sharing [le partage de] its etymological roots. What harnesses the course of the narrative is strong, and it is the ground [la terre] of the text, where the story is anchored. Notably, in the proximity of 4 l'être (the being) and lettré* (the letter), or in the double entry oVéclai (flash) which designates the fragment but also intensity, vivacity, prolonging; or again, in the indissociable doublet ť apprendre '</page><page sequence="8">78 Oxford Literary Review (to learn) and 'prendre (to take [root]) - ' Appris (taught) resonating with 'a pris (took) - by which the taking and the apprenticeship are taken [prise] from the living and, as a result, necessarily undervalued [déprise] . The garden is a world in expansion, in the manner of the sentence that is read according to its unfolding, addition after addition, and so putting into play, with each new fragment, the constellation of meaning: taught to be / entirely / at play / in each separate / letter . Each gesture, moreover, turns to its opposite - cto read / to be read'; ťto enter / to leave' - all of which propels a phenomenon of interpén- étration, like osmosis. So much so that the grammar that regulates this text, in all its agility, its reversible scansion, and rhythmic progression, is a grammar of breath, of respiration: earth', ťbody, 'skin' become materials to traverse, places of vital exchange. And to pullulate': infini- tive, absolute, underscored by the outgrowth of the sentence, thus an end without end, this verb, of which the meaning is ordinarily reserved for the animal or the vegetable, designates the fecundity of everything living. Its vocation of being prolific. Thus states the innumerable becoming - Abrahamite - of I. Eté aimée: écrite. Mes premiers textes animaux, sans points, sans mort, sans repos, imprimés sur mon univers sans je dans ce jardin. Been loved: written. My first animal texts, without full stops, without death, without rest, imprinted on my universe without I in this garden. Osmosis and porosity find themselves materialized by the punctua- tion: colon. And the coming-and-going leaves undecidable the nature of the connection: loved therefore written? Loved because written? Loved and written, from the same momentum? This multiplicity inscribes the principle of the gift, direct, differed [différé] , reciprocal; which is also to receive, to pass, address. Permissiveness. Putting the three verbs, to be, to love , to write , into a series, makes them passwords: passwords of the subject of writing, a subject that only emerges in agreement with its feminine genre. It is in this way that the verb [le Verbe], in the beginning, is constitutive of the double genitive of</page><page sequence="9">Mireille Calle-Gruber 79 this subject of writing. There is a state of writing. The first writing is a written being - where writing is reception, arrival. The first writing is a body-maker: animal [' animaux (s'entend ! animots)]7, a way of attaching oneself to the letter of the spirit. It is a place of impressions and superimpressions that relinquish nothing. A place of belonging rather than possession. J'ai été terre avec les terres. Moussue, humide, j'ai roupillé à plat un ventre jamais membre. J'ai. Eu. Vécu. Fait. Eté. I have been earth with earth. Mossy, damp, I have slept flat out a belly never membered. I have. Had. Lived. Done. Been. Indétermination designates earth' as, at the same time, the first element, the soil, the planet, passing from vegetate to vegetable (mossy); the pronoun T rids itself of its anthropomorphic contours. The double traction of the sentence carries out the disintegration: for lack of syntax, it reads not as 'flat out' ['à plat ventre] (a human attitude), but as 'flat out a belly' [' à plat un ventre ], which, flanking the substantive of the indefinite article, intends for it a cosmic dimension (bowels of the earth, bowels of the world). It produces an effect of intense incorporation: 'I miniscule' in a vast, limitless body. But also, the merging of the anthropomorphic body with the body of sentences: the movement here is particularly sensory, from the fact that it is rooted in onomatopoeia (' roupillé") , in the displaced inscrip- tion of the article of which the indefinition universalizes; in the double sense of 'membered'8 which makes the belly a feminine belly [ventre = uterus] and affirms the sexuality of the woman-body in its difference from the masculine ('never membered' [[ jamais membre ']), but which no less connotes the written body in the articulation of its organs (one says: a sentence 'member').9 And immediately, the sentence effectively dismembers and re- members itself in the passage, in every respect [en tous points ], of the line: 'I have. Had. Lived. Done. Been'. It vibrates, makes knots and bulges [ventres]. The interruptions mark two reading speeds: the one broken up, following word for word; the other flexible, sentence forming. For the one, Gramma is in control; for the other, Logos . And the writing is always explosive: to the point of.</page><page sequence="10">80 Oxford Literary Review Every full stop [point] produces caesura and enjambment; each element is both a whole and a member; plenitude and sequence. Everything, one by one, designates the absolute (construction without object) and upper-case affirmation (a fact of the graphic rule after a full stop). Each separately produces a surplus of meaning: 'I have' designates a present, even though it is, in part, the perfect tense (I have had); 'Had', a past; 'Lived. Done. Been are as much past participle as substantive, action as state; a temporality, an outcome, a season of being [l'être] (the 'summer [l' été']). Tous les mots qui poussent avant la fin de la langue, avant que je l'achève. Je suis un corps qui a joui de la création. All the words that grow before the end of language, before I finish it. I am a body that has come [joui] with creation. Henceforth the fable of the garden goes hand in hand with the story of the fabulous writing. The two registers are in unison on the word creation which, at the acme of the narration, prolongs it. The paragraphs that follow, closing the section, arise from reflection, from an ethical commentary regarding issues of surmounting and emanci- pation. But first of all, these final sentences of the story of the garden achieve a perfect equivocity: they speak of the garden of creation, that is to say, of a paradigmatic existence. They offer inextricably to knowledge the birth place of being-in-the-feminine;10 the place of transport, movement, vision, unclassifiable imaginings; the place of the languages of writing where all the potentiality of the living is explored. Superlatively, literature. Throwing bridges over the breaks, the successive hyperbatons draw the sequence in the background: I have... had... lived... done... been... all the words. Not only to speak, to write, but to be the words. To live them. To suffer them. Where at issue is the passion of the language, straight from the body, the course of existence. The refusal of teleology ('before the end') and thus of the pre-judged, the de-framing (' pousser , to grow or push), the infinitude and incompletion ([ l'inachèvement ]; ť achever takes on all its meaning here: to terminate but also to kill) - these are the rules of life for the body as for thought. The dynamic of a language full of languages, that demolishes linguistic grids,</page><page sequence="11">Mireille Calle-Gruber 81 protocols, codifications, and opposes to them the living trace of a beforehand: desire, aura, a thrust by which signs of the flesh, of writing, of thought, have to make together. Such is the language of creation. The expression 'I am a body that has come 'joui' with creation speaks admirably for the exercise of a practice that makes innumerable folds. Certainly, 'to come' [jouir] connotes pleasure, but also to have the enjoyment of, free use of, the goods of the earth. And more: this enjoyment of nature must be understood as constitutive of the person who benefits from it. The creature has creation infused , in a way. An intuition more than a knowledge, a knowledge before knowing and knowing how, a gift. It has an infused language: poetics. As such, the writer who participates of and in creation is party to [partie prenante] , and biased [de parti pris ' . He is a point of writing [prise d'écriture ' , as he is water supply, air outlet, electrical grounding. Otherwise stated: an energy vector. It is as such, no doubt, that one must interpret the occurrence in capital letters of the Unknown (one) [llnconnue] which comes after: 'You have to show the immense reach of the Unknown. This is not a return to an allegory; rather, it is the mark of an energetic force, a magnetic field, a polarization that organizes, according to the laws of a secret attraction but in the concreteness of the slightest detail, an aesthetics and a thought in which one follows, step by page [pas à page ' the innovations at work. The I-outlet [je-prise] of writing makes the passage: ¿passage. I-she 'je-elle' is the reach [(la) portée ]. It is from there that the book-thing takes not its form, but its momentum. Makes promises. The Book Makes its Entry The threshold of the book is not crossed - as one thinks.11 The threshold of the book is not crossed as we think. The threshold of the book is not crossed where we think. Beginnings are infinite, as are the beginnings of beginnings, the premises, the approaches. The book does not stop coming to writing, nor the reader to start reading the book that comes to language, to the line, to the page. Having entered, we think, having opened the cover, turned the</page><page sequence="12">82 Oxford Literary Review pages, inside the book now, reading, it is still necessary to proceed - to... the entrance. Do not forget to enter. One must see to the entry. The threshold of the book is crossed: it is an event, a series of events, phenomena (of apparitions in ink), states of the body and of the soul. In Reveries of the Wild Woman , at issue is 'the mouth of the soul and of the hanď, since the book arrives from all parts: from the intimate and from the foreign, by the secret conduit, homophonic and rhythmic, of the core (cfrom the soul') toward the exterior ('from the hand'), a mouth of fire liberating a singular energy. Coming 'to the mouth of the hand', as we might say to come to the lips, the writing of Hélène Cixous has the dynamic of enunciation: speech, parable [parole, parabole]. It is through parable that The Day I Wasn't There begins, with the introduction of the poť of error [la ' marmite de la faute] to bury. It is by the enunciation that the chapter begins: you keep yourself from the inane, I say to myself. It is a writing that goes without saying: arrivings, departings, crossings from part to part. But also that comes from lack: at the entry to the book, lack [défaut] of the book. Between failing [faillir] and needing [falloir ], the book makes its entry. It requires: the time, the distance, the outline, the passage, the steps. There is the do not [ne pas] recover the disappeared, written pages {Reveries)-, there is the step by step [pas à pas] of the words, the beating of the feet of syntax, return, reprise, reduplication; there is the grand pas-de-deux of the ballet that describes, strangely, I and the Coming [le Venant]. There are the mainsprings marking the pace of the sentence, the endless gallop of the initial period:12 I had written that in the middle of a July night and as it happens to me sometimes when a book makes its appearance always in the middle of the night, awaited certainly, hoped for with extreme patience, capable of all confidences and all humilities conceivable and inconceivable, I had written these lines, under the stroke of a sudden appearance hoped for but unimaginable of the book that was thus willing to yield to my infinitely timid supplications and thus as I do in these cases of nocturnal manifestation, I had written without turning on the light so as not to risk chasing away the Coming, I picked up quickly and without noise the pad that never leaves my</page><page sequence="13">Mireille Calle-Gruber 83 bedside and the large-nibbed pen with which one can write quickly in large letters across paper, and I had noted the first lines that the Coming dictated to me, filling the big page in the dark with a precipitation of these inestimable sentences, leaven of the book, gift of the gods of whom I do not even know the name.13 In a single period, the sentence flows, enlarges, sweeps along its heterogeneous elements, sediments, jumps, gallops. The threshold is crossed and is not crossed because, in between words and letters, it is multiplied. As for Montaigne, the writing of the book is done on horseback : ...my soul [...] usually gives birth quite unexpectedly, when I am least on the look out for them, to her profoundest, her maddest ravings which please me most. Then they quickly vanish away because, then and there, I have nothing to jot them down on; it happens when I am on my horse or at table or in bed - especially on my horse, the seat of my wildest ravings.14 On horseback, then, and holding the reins of writing - sometimes tightly reined in, sometimes unbridled, so the book comes and goes. One must note that the word unbridled' [debridĄ is used for a cut or wound, in the act of surgical incision. It is the book of error, of remorse (she says: Wemordue which in modern French suggests injury, cut, spilling of blood, the flesh of remorse), the book of dressing [ pansement ], and of thought [pensée]. Briefly, from the entry, an entire phenomenology of the text is opened out, that brings the reader to take his or her bearings [ prendre ses marques ] - the marks of reading and of writing that are so many cuts. The book makes its entry: constructs it, deconstructs it. It sets the scene for its entry on stage. The book performs. The book is the main character of the story: with it, everything arrives, or not. Everything can arrive, the said [dits], the forbidden [ interdits ], and the between- the-said [entredits] . The book is the theatricality of the book. Make no mistake: there is the opening of the book that is not the beginning of the text; there is the opening inscription, epigraphs, the</page><page sequence="14">84 Oxford Literary Review introductory, the incipit, the first sentence, the second sentence, and still not the book. There is the scene of writing: scene of coming- giving 'venant-donnant ] - generosity of the apparition, of the dictation, of the manna - then of giving-giving [donnant-donnant] because to the call of the book responds the Recall of energies' of the act of writing, in order to pursue it. The book gives to give. Portrait of the book as a donor. The book is an actor, an actant, an agent, an angel. It practices its entries and exits. At any moment, it may make an exit, it may make an entry. The entry of the book, thus, is never overcome once and for all. The threshold is always crossed twice; it is also the exit (paragram). Such is the opening passage, the incipit, of Reveries of the Wild Woman: All the time I lived in Algeria I dreamed of one day arriving in Algeria, I would have done anything to arrive there , I had written, I never found myself in Algeria, it is necessary now, precisely, that I explain myself, how I wished that the door would open, now and not later, I had very quickly noted, in the fever of the July night, since it is now, and probably for dozens and hundreds of reasons, that a door has just been half opened in the Forgotten gallery of memory, and for the first time, here it is that I have the possibility of returning to Algeria, thus the obligation...15 The incipit repeats itself at the entry to Reveries according to a movement of give and take, where to increase consists in subtraction.16 The incipit returns to the excipit: All the time I lived in Algeria I dreamed of one day arriving in Algeria and it turns the story inside out like a glove. The written book (the book once written), is the book to be (re)written. Remains to be written. There is (of) the rest to write. Remainders, re-beginnings. My end is-and-is-not my beginning. My beginning is not my end. From one to the other, the book takes shape between the hands of the reader. It involves magic, like all crafts where the hand approximates. 'Magic: art supposed to produce, by certain practices, effects contrary to the laws of nature' (Larousse). The book, precisely, in its employment of practices, beliefs, written rites, to inconceivable effects, is a magical place. Example: the end, that splits,</page><page sequence="15">Mireille Calle-Gruber 85 of The Day I Wasn't There , since it is an end with two ends, in two languages and in more than one voice. This bifurcation holds the book in the inter- views, and the reading in the blinking (of an eye). It is a book that does not stop making the reading blink. The book arrives, but it has never arrived (is never completed, fixed). If it has the unstable form of return, retreat, reversal, it is because it gives forms to living in a world that has multiple names: Algeria, Prague, Osnabrück, Oran... This is also a habitation of languages. The book issues [délivre] visas in order to cross categorical boundaries. In Latin, visa means things seen. The book of visas pushes a way through to unknown passages to the things that we think we know. The art of the book is in the network, the junctions, the joints. It brings a new day. The book is always the day I wasn't there'. The book makes the story of the book. To reveal the coming of the book is to submit the 'things seen to the test of writing, to interrogate 'that which is seen: theorein. In this sense, the book that makes its entry onto the stage engages a theory of the real . The Negated Book The negated but nevertheless bound book is found there, between our hands. It is a hybrid that arises from fiction and reality, that denies and affirms its presence. It doubles the proof of its existence: by the negative and by the affirmative. These books are chimera - composite, compound beings. Chimeras in truth. For the writer, to negate the book is to implement a singular composition. It is to defer [différé] the narrative, but in order to better bond [ liaisonner ] the elements of the construction. ' Liaisonner is a term used by a builder, who puts together the stones of a work by filling the joints. It is a case then, as far as literature is concerned, of making the book a bonding of disjointed pieces. What is denied is the block-book, the monolithic book, without seams, without faults. There is even more though, and the composition of The Day I Wasnt There is exemplary in this regard. The book scatters, the book opens wide, the book delivers [livre] , the book proceeds the way one engages in combat [livre un combat] . Because the negated book is the</page><page sequence="16">86 Oxford Literary Review book of error or fault - and of confession. In truth, this is not so simple: it is the fault of the blameless. Fault without culpability. This is what displaces the meanings of words and signifies want of 'faute de' , lack of [manque de', to default [faire défaut ]. It is the fault of the innocent. Violence and pain then erupts - where language defaults. It is in the want of languages that the book, negated, looks. Searches. Beats. Let us follow page by page the beginning of The Day I Wasn't There . After the introductory passage setting tone and theme ('How to flee from the memory of a fault that returns from a distant past?'), the first section is organized as a narrative fugue. It unfolds in the following manner: a quick narrative of the eclipse (coming/departing, birth/death) of the newborn, my little simpleton , ťthe little winning one', in sum his lack of existence, for want of weight, for want of breath, for want of common features. Eclipse thereby of a star, and the disaster [dés-astre] in his place: I scrutinized from the earth the distant face that I didn't succeed in seeing, the expression on the face of the moon, which doesn't mean that there wasn't one.17 Then comes the story, equally short, of the photo of the little Romanian girl: she lacks an arm, devoured by her fellow creature, the little famished girl. Now Irina and Irina are fully alive, if reduced augmented. There is no evil, only a tragedy. Everything is the other fault [de l'autre faute ].18 It is in the instability of this last sentence, turning on ťthe other', that the stakes of the writing are marked out: not the fault of the other (drama) but the other fault . In other words, the fault of god, or of god who defaults - it's all the same. Therein lies the essence of the tragedy. Following this, opening a new section, there is the episode entitled 'My three-legged dog'. The section divides in two: two twin-dates (two centres of focus, one telescope), two firsts of May. The one inscribes the memory of the day of the walk in the woods, and of the encounter with the dog abandoned for want of a leg:</page><page sequence="17">Mireille Calle-Gruber 87 even though he is not guilty there is fault: lack of 'faute de] a leg, lack of time, lack of patience, lack of tolerance, all these faults which are not his fault but which revert to him [lui reviennent nevertheless because of his lack of a leg...19 The second first of May records the memory of a film: the narrator writes of having seen Un Spécialiste , a film of the trial of Eichmann, organizer of the transports to the extermination camps. The first of May: celebration of work of mourning and of memory. It becomes a day of ghosts [ revenants ] (the faults return - [' lui reviennent '] - in both meanings of 'revenir : to return, and to be attributed to). It is the commemoration of faults, of the default of thought in their place. It is only after this refined architecture of narratives that, in the third section, a new capital incipit - 'I never think of my son the deaď - the deferred book returns. It returns from afar, on an angle, with caution: 4 - 1 never think of my son the dead, thought I to my cat who was smiling at me with her mini-minimal, moving smile'. The deferred book returns also from nearby because the text has not stopped spinning out the same threads of metaphor, each story telling the other story that is a type, putting one word for another. In fact, for Hélène Cixous, to negate the book is to construct it in order to make an immense enallage of it. This figure, one remembers, consists of substituting or exchanging a time, a number, a person, for another time, another number, another person. The book does all that and more: it does not stop exchanging one story for another. Cixous' book is an immense interchanger. Everything exchanges itself, supplements itself, increases itself. These narrative relays and branches are so many augmentation systems of understanding: they are to make the reading more receptive, more mobile, more alive (living). They are to make ties, joints, and disjunctions. This is the strength of the text: to tell the story of the trisomie son or the extermination of the Jews is just as much to tell the story of the dog and the cat, the story of the cat and the bird, of hunger in the world, of the lack of Algeria and of Algeria missed. The strategy of the negated book is to give us back stories a hundredfold. Above all, I am grateful to the writer for recounting, in this way, the oblique, the profile, the back, in flight. Refusing a so-called 'realist'</page><page sequence="18">88 Oxford Literary Review psychological treatment, she preserves the necessary distance of the story. Choosing the retreat (distance and revival), does not confuse the narrative scene with the spectacular, or with the sensational, or with narcissistic complacency. It restores writing to the dignity of the reserved, but no less to the excess of crossings. In Cixousian poetics, the genesis of the book becomes the narrative of the genetics of the text that no longer corresponds to representations of social and familial conventions. Here more than ever, the negated book reflects, in its procedures, that there is a lack of person [défaut de personne ] (the trisomie) - just as there is a lack of Algeria {Reveries of the Wild Woman), lack of the father {Dedans, OR les lettres de mon pere), lack of she {La), etc. This is a Cixousian paradigm. The negated book is the livret de famille20: 'the little shredded book', she writes.21 To Live the Book, or to Write the Unforgettable The body-language of mimosa, or mimosa when it is in the province of language, has shaped Hélène Cixous books for a long time. Let us recall the following extract from Dernier tableau : I'm calling: mimosa! I'm calling you. I tell you on the telephone: I want so much for you to see the mimosas. I send you the word mimosa ; I hope that once it has arrived in your breast it will retransform itself into a vision of mimosa. I am a being who paints mimosas by telephone.22 To give a body of letters to the word mimosa is to make it unforget- table because call-able, spellable, recallable. The call brings out of forgetting, sounds the alarm for forgetting, signalling that it is forget- table and unforgettable. What calls the text, thereby, is the faculty of the work to (re) create an artistic reality (Pierre Reverdy), to give an independent life to the mimosa-word. To create by not copying, by not imitating: to make visible (vision) that which cannot be seen. To arouse a more effective phantasia than mimesis . Life, vision, like an absent one responding to the call, comes to acquire a body from an incantatory formula: cto paint mimosas by telephone'.</page><page sequence="19">Mireille Calle-Gruber 89 To search out the form of the work, and not some real model, such is the means of raising the alarm that art provokes in the sensible. This is the reborn view of the night; the unforgettable but not the monument. Drawing a line (marked out) from the forgettable to the unforgettable, the book makes itself present, here , at the instant of enunciation, now-since-after; but also a gifi of being for all times. This is a book that requires reading on a tightrope. To draw the unforgettable from oblivion, and vice versa, Cixous' text uses precipitation . The word appears at the beginning of Reveries of the Wild Woman: I had noted the first lines that the Coming dictated to me, filling the big page in the dark with a precipitation of these inestimable sentences.23 The term here, in the web of meaning, designates all at once the speed of a lightning flash, the fall of fertile rain, the chemical and alchemical precipitate of the verb. 'Precipitation is, in this way, the name of a major operation of Cixousian writing: a good many words are used in several senses and at several points of entry. The lexicon is epiphanic thanks to this precipitate of meaning. Note: chemical precipitation is a feature of an insoluble body. Linguistic precipitates make bodies: they reveal the insolubility of language in discourses {logos), the non-resolution of significations, the inescapable and lettered presence of being. Here, for example, the precipitate of the word 'inane' [niais]: ť"you keep yourself from the inane," I say to myself, and I opened my eyes. This is the sentence that bangs on the windows (Breton), but with this difference: Cixous makes resonate the felling axe of the signifiers. After the initial shock of the common meaning - 'niais= naive, a simpleton - come, by successive strokes, etymological and homophonic cuts, and their recrossings, always more prolific in the fabric of the narration. 4 Le niais ' comes from nid (Latin nidus), 24 which generates the image and the writing of generation: 'in the mined hollows of my night, a nest cossets forever my little niais . 25 Alliteration and syllabic rhyme make it possible to hear né/niais [born/inane], mi-nuit [mid-night], mi-né (d démi-né) [half-born], and ni-er [to negate] ( nid/niais ) in ni-ais (two syllables, one syllable) - inane and negated. Securing the</page><page sequence="20">90 Oxford Literary Review one with the other: birth-negation; life-death. Moreover, and more precisely: in terms of falconry, ' niais is said of a bird caught in the nest. The story makes a feature of this: 4 Fossile de faucon niais, voilà ce qu'il est'.26 Cryptic at first approach, the formula reveals itself to be less metaphoric than literal (which increases the work of the signifiers fossile faucon ). Because it is surely there that the story will be cut into the book: story OF THAT which is caught in the nest as in a trap, hunted, taken from birth, taken from the cradle and from maternal care (by the mother of the mother). From the outset, the book is a crypt: all the elements of the story already are there - in secret. Tied tight: in a knot [noeud] of language. The book is enjoined to explore the secret of languages; it is summoned to deliver [livrer] language. From then on, a veritable poetic art is to be heard in these lines that put forth the keys of reading and of writing: In front of him, I thought, all the words of being, of having, of being able, of going, all wavered and folded. That is why it was always difficult for me to speak of it, for lack of language.27 One must, then, write (and read) with wavering and folded words. It is for lack [défaut] of languages - as one says of armour, the armour of logos that clads us with certainties - it is for lack of languages that literature comes. But the highest point of pain is inscribed always in the most exiguous of writing, in the letter, a phonematic beating. Because there is much more than a game of homophony between niais ( le niais) and je niais , conjugation of the verb to negate or deny [nier], first person of the imperfect of the indicative: ť...did I know that I negated [niais] who I negated, did I know that I kept it in me outside of me, from this instant in the outside of me [hors de moi]...'28 From the pronoun to the article, from the person to ... this bird, je niais - le niais, the text receives as a deposit the mark of the being that dis-joins. A slide, a click, a wink, a nothing of immeasurable magnitude. Being is said doubly, together, in rejection : T who refuses, 'the' rejected kid [rejeton]. In the' (it), an T; in the thing, an act. And always the failing fault, for the one as for the other, of 'I-am-nevertheless'.29 The precipitate of language serves a writing of notation, of deposit,</page><page sequence="21">Mireille Calle-Gruber 91 of the fragment, of urgency. A writing that chooses to paint the passage (Montaigne). One cannot be mistaken: it is a rapidity (a precipitation) that does not work without the calculation of its effects: the weighing of words, the impact of the stylet strokes (Flaubert); the step of time. It is to say that To Live-The Book [ Vivre-Livre ] are not on the same level. Reverdy: 'What object other than a work of art do we ask to resemble something other than itself?'30 Hélène Cixous claims the life of the work : the book with its heritage of books, the etymological weight of words, the genealogies of the library, the play of signifiers. With this paradox: the more the letter is insoluble, resistant to the effacing force of decoding, the more the lettered body of paper beings is the conveyor of living visions, the more the writing gives life. The unforgettable book in progress is the story of its poetic enjamb- ments. The Book to You and to Yours [à tu et à toi ] Insofar as they arise from confession - a writing in which, as Rousseau writes, 'I have kept back 'tu ] nothing bad' - but also from reverie - where the writing goes without saying, and I is to you and yours with its same-other - Cixous' books give rise to mechanisms of meditation, to role playing, to the crossings of enunciation. The narrator is split: she does not stop putting herself at issue, putting herself back into play, getting back into the saddle, back onto the hot seat ('I am a woman who always has courts inside her head, all because I had not been deported [...] I always have judges inside my head who are abandoning me to a bitter absence of punishment'31). She does not stop deporting herself in the story, making it go further and further apart - and in many ways. She apostrophizes herself, interrogates herself, scrutinizes herself with the passion of an astrologer or speleologist. But split in this way, the narrator is multiplied, in a spate of stories to be written: 'I said' 'dis-je', 'I said to myself [me dis-je ], 'I thought' 'pensé'je' , 'I had noted' [avais-je noté' , 'I had written' [avais-je écrit]. This use of asides is altogether singular. Elliptical additions, little discrete sentences that, ordinarily, quickly signal the identity of the</page><page sequence="22">92 Oxford Literary Review speaker and reinforce the illusion of direct dialogue, they have here, on the contrary, the capacity to sow surprise and confusion. They consti- tute the revealing of narrative disjunctions: suddenly, we find ourselves not in the scene we thought we were. The book supplements the narrator with scenes of multiple writing, it announces it to her. Requested to respond to the call of anamnesis as though to prophetic voices, the narrator is not her own contemporary: the book of annunciation magnifies her; it magnifies being, like a magnifying glass. It gives her day with night; life and survival; writing and unwriting; reading and raving. The book gives all rights, the right to say all: the most painful, the most buried, the most archaic. Including the day I wasn't there': that which one did not know to know. Various scenarios conjugate their effects, as in the example of this passage: The sea is not the sea; the sky has nothing to do with sky; the pines, when I look at the pines from here I see only foreign pines, nothing other than reproduced pines, in the defining of pines from here you must speak the truth, these are idiotic pines, look at this pine it goes straight up look, twenty metres straight up look I tell you at this idiot and at the end of twenty metres a feather duster, looklook cries my brother while the pine of Algeria is an umbrella pine, and not idiotic, a gracious, crooked and velvety umbrella, you must speak the whole truth, looklook cries my brother, while all the pines in the garden stiffen under his looklook and take a step forward, look how ridiculous this pine is on the right, it is grotesque here the idiot pine is grotesque and you don't say it, and I feel all this alone, thinks my brother crushing under the weight of his large body- with-regrets the tiny seat, a fly compared to the giant seats of war, and I can't even tell you that I feel it alone because from all the evidence, thinks my brother, you feel nothing of what I feel, the proof is that you can live here 'i-ct' . The more I come back this way with the sole purpose of seeing you, the more my conviction increases that you have not known Algeria, the more I feel myself objectively in danger of mutilation, since you can renounce totally what fundamentally united us, he thinks.32 At first, in this story that relies largely on realist effects, one is</page><page sequence="23">Mireille Calle-Gruber 93 unable to decide who speaks, character or narrator. But soon the return of the asides 'said my brother', exclaimed my brother contra- venes the unobtrusive unison and underscores the mediation of the narrator, which undermines the effect of catching it live. From then on, the scene of the book shows through. There, where the conven- tions of realism minimize the presence of writing, the Cixousian book is employed - on the contrary - with thinking the process of thought in the work. With inscribing the expenditure of thought thinking [la dépense de la pensée pensant ]. In fact, by a new divergence, the implausibility increases and the reported speech finds itself contra- i/e d by the mark of interior thought: 'thought my brother, 'he thought'. This tension tears the logical coherence of the discursive fabric; it heightens the presence of the book, the stitches of its assembly. And so, textual construction is privileged over real facts, the phrasal event over the psychological symptom, the narrative machinery where anything can happen over the codes of representa- tion for novelistic character. It is thus, in the final analysis, the infinite capacity of the invention of the book when it is to you and yours [à tu et à toi ] with its narrative spectres, that finds itself raised up. In this sequence of the speaking, thinking and performing brother, and all so much thought, spoken and performed by the narrator, it is the book that is in question, and of which they speak. The book-main-character that reflects them and upon which they reflect. And at the end, the book speaks. It doesn't speak like-a-book, it addresses: 4 - Ask him - says the book - no I say - ask him if she has forgotten [...]'33 It is ahead of the narrator, of the author: the book knows. It is an interlocutor, it is a superego. The book that has withheld nothing from confession is an injunction to question: to the nearest. There where it was not 'done on purpose', the book comes: deliberately. Le jour où je nétais pa là is a book with two endings: one finished, one under erasure. Two stops for a story that remains unresolved 'indenoue}. Two arrests for an acquittal. A non-place. At the end of the ends, which is neither one nor the other, the</page><page sequence="24">94 Oxford Literary Review author chooses to suspend. She chooses the book of knotting [du nouement]. Deliberately. Thus, from book to book she pursues the book, non-resolved non-finished, attached to the undecidable. Thus, she unfinishes it [ainsi l'infinit-elle}.
