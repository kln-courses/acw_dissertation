MOYE Columbia University, New York, NY 10027 The recognition that the relation between history and fiction is an intimate one is as old as historical writing itself. Thucydides, for example, felt it necessary to draw a clear distinction between his own work and the "romantic" tales of his predecessors, the poets and prose chroniclers, "who are less interested in telling the truth than in catching the attention of their public, whose authorities cannot be checked, and whose subject-matter, owing to the passage of time, is mostly lost in the unreliable streams of mythology." Thucydides himself, in contrast, was to be a conscientious researcher and reliable narrator of the true facts. However, as Thucydides acknowledged, establishing the truth of the facts is no easy task. Indeed, as centuries of philosophical analysis of history have shown, the problems of subjectivity and relativism in establishing both the truth of historic fact and the truth of historical explanation are essentially unresolvable, and the grow- ing emphasis, in this century, on the narrative aspect of history has led to the recognition that the relation between fiction and history may be more intimate than the practicing historian might care to admit. "History,"' of course, is a remarkably slippery term, and "fiction" also possesses a doubleness of meaning. The use, in English at any rate, of "history" to refer both to the past and to the written record of the past presents an obvious difficulty. But that difficulty is an illuminating one, for the overlapping tells us two things: first, it reveals the assumption that the written record of the past actually recovers the past itself, that it is (or can be) a true record; second, and more important for my argument, it implies, in a sense, that the story we tell of the past is the only past we know. In fact, this implication does a good deal to question the assumption I have noted, for it is here that the doubleness of"fiction" comes into play. As the derivation of "fiction" from the Latin fingo, fingere indicates, the meaning of "fiction" is not just, or even primarily, "false"; rather, it carries the sense of "to shape or form, to arrange.' A fiction then, at least in the sense of it with which I am concerned here, is a construction, an ordering or arranging of elements into an understandable whole; and the stories that we tell of the past, regardless Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War (rev. ed.; New York: Penguin, 1972) 47. 577</page><page sequence="2">578 Journal of Biblical Literature of a question of truth or falseness, to the extent that they arrange what we take to be the facts or the events of the past into an understandable or mean- ingful configuration, partake of that element of fiction that we know as the narrative element. In fact, as the justification of history has shifted from truth-of-fact to truth-of-explanation, and as the crucial role that narrative plays in historical explanation has come to be more fully acknowledged, the centrality of nar- rative to cognition itself has likewise come to be more fully recognized. Our sense of the past, and of history as a genre, then, depends on our sense of narrative. The obvious question is this: Where do we find our sense of nar- rative and, consequently, our sense of history? If, following Louis O. Mink's revision of Barbara Hardy's claim that narrative is a "primary act of mind transferred to art from life;' we acknowledge that "it seems truer to say that narrative qualities are transferred from art to life,"2 we ought to be able to see where and how our histories - in the sense both of our understanding of the past and of our accounts of that past-are shaped by particular fictions. There is, I think, no better way to examine the ways in which our fictions shape our histories than by beginning at the beginning: that is, by looking at the relation between myth and history in the Hebrew Bible, particularly Genesis and Exodus. For myth, perhaps more clearly than any other type of fiction, as a mode of understanding distinct from logical or discursive under- standing, illustrates how a narrative construction embodies a way of con- ceptualizing and representing reality, including the reality of the past? In its own right, myth is a subject that has been treated in both its struc- tural and its cognitive dimensions with interesting and valuable results by thinkers from Vico and Herder to Carl Jung and Northrop Frye to Claude Levi-Strauss and Roland Barthes and beyond. Like fiction and history, myth is a complex and polysemous term; but for my purposes here, myth can be defined on two levels. First, to distinguish it from the more inclusive term fiction, as well as from other varieties of fiction and from history, myth can signify a particular form or genre. As we find it in the Hebrew Bible in, for example, the creation stories, myth can be described as an independent, closed, symbolically rich narrative about some archetypal character whose story, which takes place in the primeval time of the beginning, represents some universal aspect of the origins or nature of humanity in its relation to the sacred or the divine. Second, and more important for my purposes, is the cognitive or conceptual dimension of myth that such analysts as Mircea Eliade point to-that is, the sense in which myth, by narrating a "sacred 2 L.

Vann; Ithaca and London: Cornell University Press, 1987) 59-60. 3 In presenting myth as a mode of conception distinct from logical or discursive understand- ing, I am following Ernst Cassirer's philosophy of Symbolic Forms and particularly his work in Language and Myth (1946; reprinted, New York: Dover, 1953).</page><page sequence="3">Moye: Myth and History in Genesis and Exodus 579 history,' stabilizes and orders, or regenerates and gives meaning to, what is seen as the chaos of human, or secular and profane, existence.4 I am con- cerned in this essay primarily with the ways in which this cognitive dimen- sion of myth is incorporated within and in turn informs the idea of history expressed in the Hebrew Bible and in Genesis and Exodus in particular. In fact, it is the conflation and transformation of different genres through their interrelations that mark the distinctive character of the Bible. As form and source criticism have made abundantly clear, the Bible is a remarkable congeries of disparate, often contradictory, myths, etiological tales, fictional and historical prose narratives, dramas, genealogies, catalogues, legal codes and covenants, prophecies, doxologies and informal prayers, blessings and curses, poems, songs, and miscellaneous pieces-in short, of all kinds of different genres written over an enormous span of time and gathered into a single text. Within that single text are two discrete, even contradictory, "testaments" both made up of such "pieces:' But at the same time, as redac- tion and literary criticism have shown, a significant part of the fascination with the biblical text is that it is a single text; what is most significant about the biblical text from a literary point of view is what Robert Alter, for example, calls the "composite artistry" of the biblical redactors in making of these disparate pieces a single unified text. This is precisely my focus in reading Genesis: because it is possible to see clearly the independent elements of the Hebrew Bible, it is also possible to see exactly how those pieces are woven "artistically" into a unified narrative that was seen for centuries not only as a theological text, but also as an accurate account of the past. Moreover, it is also possible to see how that unified narrative subsumes what we might take to be the "real" historic facts that are commonly acknowledged or assumed to exist within or underneath the largely mythical and legendary tales of the Bible. What I am concerned to show here, however, has nothing to do with the question of the factual truth or accuracy of those facts; rather, I am interested in the way in which both stories about the past, true or not, and discrete mythical narratives are molded by the larger interpretive narrative patterns of the Bible, the way that the narrative structures of the Bible refer, as Alter puts it, "the discrete data of historical and individual experience to large interpretive patterns."' The way that the Hebrew Bible accomplishes this feat is to incorporate myth into history first by linking independent mythical narratives into a forward-moving 4 See M.

Indeed, as David Damrosch has shown, in a valuable effort to merge the results of the atomistic principles of form and source criticism with the developments engendered by the unifying principles of literary analysis, the growth of Hebrew historiography was the product of "two decisive steps": "first, the full translation of older epic into historicized prose; second, the application of poetic epic perspectives to historiography proper"'7 As Dam- rosch argues, "the Bible's historical writing can best be understood as the result of a far-reaching transformation of earlier genres, resulting in a com- bination of many of the values, themes, and formal properties of historical chronicle with those of poetic epic"; it is the interaction and mutual transfor- mation of different genres that mark the narrative history of the Hebrew Bible, particularly the merging of epic and history in the interactions between Yahwistic and Deuteronomistic history and the interweaving of historical narrative and law by the Priestly writers who produced the full form of the Pentateuch.s Moreover, we can see such a process of mutual transformation not only in the merging of epic and history and the interweav- ing of history and law, but also, as I hope to show here, in the merging of myth and history and the interweaving of myth and genealogy in Genesis; for in the interrelation and mutual transformation of myth and genealogy, we can see the narrative of Genesis as beginning in historicized myth and moving progressively toward mythicized history. Genesis itself splits neatly into two parts: the first, chapters 1 through 11, is commonly called the Primeval History; the second, chapters 12 through 50, is referred to as the Patriarchal History. It is also commonly acknowl- edged that the first part is predominantly mythical, whereas the second is more nearly historical-or at the very least something between legend and history. Biblical narrative as a whole, as the list of the variety of genres above indicates, ranges along a spectrum from the unmistakably mythical-the opening creation story (1:1-2:4a), for example - to what is surely a type of history-the genealogical lists or t6ld16t. Of course, that is not to say that the facts incorporated into the genealogical lists are accurate; nor is it, on the other hand, to deny the fact that, as Hesiod's Theogony or the Enuma Elish and numerous other Near Eastern parallels indicate, genealogy plays a sig- nificant role in myth itself. In fact, as is suggested by the verse that links the opening creation story of Genesis to the more anthropomorphic creation story that follows - "These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created" (2:4a)-the opening story stands, in effect, as a 7 D.

At the same time, though, because this verse stands as a link between two mythical stories-looking, as it were, back to the generation of the heavens and the earth in the first (though chrono- logically later) creation story and forward to the generations of humanity beginning in the figures of Adam and Eve in the second-we can see the function of genealogy that stands at the center of Genesis: the historicizing function. The genealogy here serves to join the myth of the origins of the universe to the story of the origins of humanity and thus to connect that primeval order of creation to the order of human history, and it does so by linking these two mythic stories into a forward-moving narrative.10 In fact, the first part of Genesis is composed almost entirely of myth and genealogy: the opening creation story, the second creation story and the story of Adam and Eve, the story of Cain and Abel, the story of the sons of God and the daughters of men, the story of Noah and the flood, and the story of the Tower of Babel are interspersed with genealogical lists. Each of these stories is essentially mythical in form and intent; they are independent, closed, sym- bolically rich narratives about archetypal characters set in some primeval time out of the realm of history and dealing with some universal truth about the origins or the nature of humanity in its relation to the cosmic and the divine. For their part, the genealogical lists, although superficially at least not quite narrative, are similar in representing chronological sequence to the annals form of history. Of course, biblical genealogies do not, as Robert R. Wilson argues, necessarily provide accurate data about the past and, in fact, were not often written as history in our modern sense of scientific history as an accurate record of the data of the past.'" But that does not mean that they were not written as history in another sense altogether-as an integral part of a story, even a record, of the experience of humanity in the world and within the continuum of time. Moreover, as Wilson notes, ancient geneal- ogies may, and obviously have, come to be seen as conveying true information about the past (whether or not they do) by later generations. Thus, though they do not necessarily provide accurate data about the past, the genealogies 9 All quotations from the Bible are from the Revised Standard Version (RSV) unless otherwise noted.

Although Wilson's study, in contrast to my effort here, attempts to deter- mine the historiographic value of the data contained in these genealogies, his analysis of the form and function of biblical genealogy, as well as other Near Eastern parallels, is extremely valuable.</page><page sequence="6">582 Journal of Biblical Literature of Genesis are historicizing in form and intent in that they link the inde- pendent mythical narratives into a forward-moving continuum that provides, to use Hans Frei's terms, a realistic or "history-like" (as distinct from factually accurate) element that is central to much of biblical narrative.'2 At the same time, the genealogies are informed by the mythical nar- ratives they surround. It is not simply that their placement between the independent mythical narratives gives the impression of a linear, chrono- logical progression; the genealogies are incorporated into the narrative in a way that mirrors, in a subtly ironic contrast, one of the primary themes of the initial myths: separation, division, and exclusion. This pattern is continued in the second part of Genesis, the Patriarchal History, thereby linking the two parts into a single progression even as the narratives themselves become more historical. Finally, the patriarchal narratives, as they become pro- gressively historical, are constructed precisely to reveal the historic correlate of the theme of the opening myths: exile and return. Thus, the entire book of Genesis, as well as the remainder of the Bible, is informed by the theme of exile and return, or of separation from and union with the divine; the inter- relation of narrative and genealogy in Genesis particularly reveals this pattern and theme. I. The Mythical Paradigm: Separation/Reintegration That two creation stories, with obvious differences, even contradictions, sit side by side in the first chapters of Genesis is a fact that has been noted, commented on, and variously explained probably for almost as long as Genesis has had readers or listeners. The abstract, formal, theocentric char- acter of the opening narrative (1:1-2:4a) is a clear contrast to the anthro- pomorphic, earthy, and concrete style of the second (2:4b-25). The fact that they are both included in Genesis has long troubled commentators, and the explanation is surely not that the redactors were forced to include the standard creation stories; for as the archaeological studies of the ancient Near East in this century have revealed, there are a number of parallel and contrasting myths that could also have been included. Rather, it is entirely likely that the biblical redactors chose these two narratives precisely for what their juxtaposition reveals: a movement from the divine order of creation into the disorder of the human realm and the consequent severing of the human from the divine. It is not necessary to examine in detail the structure of Genesis 1:1-2:4a in order to point out the symmetry and harmony of the whole. The orderly pace of the narrative; the self-effacing, almost non-existent narrator; the 12 See Hans W Frei, The Eclipse of Biblical Narrative: A Study in Eighteenth and Nineteenth Century Hermeneutics (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1974) esp. 1-16.</page><page sequence="7">Moye: Myth and History in Genesis and Exodus 583 repetition of phrasing; the dividing and ordering of the universe; the ascend- ing order of specificity and complexity in creation, from the lights in the heavens, to vegetation, to beasts, to humanity (male and female), singled out as made in the likeness of God and possessing dominion over the creatures of the earth and sea (1:26); and the culmination in cessation from the work of creation and in rest, legitimizing the seventh day as the sabbath-all of these elements contribute to a clear, orderly, harmonious picture of crea- tion.3 In addition, the narrative itself is neatly rounded off, returning us to the beginning by the repetition in 2:4a of the initial terms of 1:1: In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. (1:1) These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created. (2:4a) The conjunction of these elements presents an overwhelming picture of a perfectly balanced division and hierarchical order, the barely noticeable reversal of the fourth and fifth days in the expanding description of creation day by day and the missing "good" from the second day merely adding, by the subtlest of contrasts, to the picture of a perfectly ordered and perfectly good creation culminating in the "very good" (1:31) sixth day and in God's rest in the seventh from his creation. The total is perhaps the ultimate depiction of what Eliade refers to as "the strong, fresh, pure world that existed in illo tempore" and which humanity always seeks to recover through ritual and myth.4 But the phrase "these are the generations of the heavens and the earth,' with its inclusion of the key word of Genesis as a whole-"genera- tions"'5 -looks not only back to the beginning but forward into the text and into history. Here, as everywhere else it occurs, it serves to link one narrative to the next, and the following verse picks up the phrasing, reversing it to place the emphasis specifically on "earth": "In the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens .. ." (2:4b). The juxtaposition of these two creation narratives, linked by a reversal of heaven and earth, suggests a move- ment from the divine perspective of perfect order and harmony presented in the opening creation story to the human and earthly realm of history.

And, of course, Wilson's Genealogy and History in the Biblical World is also central.</page><page sequence="8">584 Journal of Biblical Literature The initial description of earthly creation, focusing not on the abstract creation by the word of God in 1:1-2:4a but on the creative activity of the Lord God- "The Lord God formed man of dust from the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and ... planted a garden in Eden" (2:7-8)-picks up the picture of harmonious division from the opening creation story: And out of the ground the Lord God made to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food, the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. A river flowed out of Eden to water the garden, and there it divided and became four rivers. (2:9-10) Clearly, the imagery of this primal paradise serves to provide a sense of the harmony and order of the original world in which humanity was once at home. The pairing of the two trees in the midst of the garden, along with the river that divides in four, watering the four corners of the earth but originat- ing from the mythical navel of the earth, functions both to describe an initial earthly paradise and to carry the notion of harmonious division from the opening creation story into the human world.16 In contrast to the balanced division of the opening creation story, the first words of the Lord God in this story introduce unbalanced division and distinction: And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, "You may freely eat of every tree of the garden; but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall die." (2:16-17) The pair of trees in the midst of the garden has been sundered; the tree of life has disappeared (only to reappear at the other end of this narrative sequence likewise isolated and the object of another form of prohibition - exile), while the tree of the knowledge of good and evil has been singled out and stands alone. Moreover, just as the tree of knowledge is singled out, so too the man is distinguished and isolated from the rest of God's creation as the Lord finds it "not good that the man should be alone" (2:18) and seeks a fit mate for him. In contrast to the distinction granted to humanity in the opening creation story- that of dominion over the earth - this distinction of isolation is "not good. In fact, another contrast is made to the opening creation story in the search for a fit mate for the man. As the man names each of the creatures that the Lord makes "out of the ground" and brings before him, we are reminded not only that "man" was given "dominion" over the earth in the opening creation story, but also that humanity, both male and female, was 6 On the mythical navel of the earth as the center and source of creation and as the meeting place of the human and the divine, see Eliade, Myth of the Eternal Return, 13, 16-17; idem, Sacred and Profane, 44-45 and passim; see also Fishbane, Text and Texture, 17, 112, for an analysis of Eden as sacred space.</page><page sequence="9">Moye: Myth and History in Genesis and Exodus 585 made in the "likeness," in "the image of God" (1:26). Just as God named his creation as he made it, so the man, in the likeness of God, names God's creatures. But the reminder reveals difference from God as much as it reveals "likeness'" Where God's naming is in itself the creation of balanced oppo- sites - light and darkness, day and night, heaven and earth, male and female - the man's naming here is not only subordinate, as the hierarchical order of creation no doubt implies, but also different in kind; for the man's naming is performed not in the creation of a balanced opposite but in the noncreative and unsuccessful search for an opposite. The man, then, in the second crea- tion story is not so much the "likeness" of God as an unsuccessful mimic, and humanity is not "both male and female"; rather, the man is alone, differing not only from God but also from the rest of God's creation, and no creature is found fit to be a mate for him. So out of the flesh and bone of the man (2:23), God creates the woman. This creation, however, is not so much pairing as severing: woman is "taken out of man" (2:23), and the etiological tag that is appended -"therefore a man leaves his father and his mother and cleaves to his wife, and they become one flesh" (2:24) - serves to highlight both separation ("a man leaves his father and his mother") and the desire for union in one flesh. Man, beginning in singularity and isolation, is paired with Woman; but that pairing is itself an act of division and disjoining, for the union in one flesh is illusory. It is, after all, in isolation, apart from the man, that the woman becomes prey to the serpent in the verses that immediately follow. Thus the harmonious division of order so clearly detailed in the struc- ture of the opening creation story and echoed in the geography of Eden in the second is replaced by division that moves toward disjunction and disorder. While the opening creation story presents the harmonious balance of opposites, the second is essentially the story of the man's discovery of his difference from all other things, including God, his discovery of his other- ness; it is as if humanity were in the primal paradise of Eden but not of it. As the story of the fall shows, it is the human desire to overcome that otherness, the desire to be "like God," that precipitates the reverse: dissocia- tion from God and expulsion from Eden. It is, after all, the possibility-and a true one at that - of becoming "like God, knowing good and evil" (3:5) with which the serpent tempts the woman, and it is the desire for that "likeness" that leads the woman and the man to violate the prohibition that distin- guishes the human from the divine and brings down the curses that inform the remainder of Genesis: the curse on childbearing, the curse on the land, and, above all, death. It is God's recognition that the man and the woman have "become like one of us [the gods], knowing good and evil" (3:22) that prompts the exile of Adam and Eve from Eden lest they eat "of the tree of life.., and live for ever" (3:22), thereby overcoming the last obstacle to becoming wholly like God; for it is death, ultimately, that differentiates the human from the divine. Thus, we move, in the second creation story and in</page><page sequence="10">586 Journal of Biblical Literature the story of the fall, from the initial harmony- if only a geographic one - of Eden to the man's recognition of his difference and otherness to the full separation of the human from the divine and the exile eastward from Eden. The stories of Cain and Abel and of the sons of God and the daughters of men (likewise stories of transgression, division, and exile), along with their surrounding genealogies, carry us down to the story of Noah and the flood - the ultimate story of exile from God, in which all of humanity, excluding Noah and his family, is to be completely severed from God by death, according to the terms of the original curse. Of course, the contrast between the biblical version of the story of the flood and the various alternative versions of this story-the Greek story of Deucalion and the Mesopotamian version in the Epic of Gilgamesh are just two of many-presents us with an illuminating example of the way that biblical narrative transforms a nearly universal myth into a story that fulfills the purposes of the Hebrew tradition by narrating that story in terms that are central to Genesis as a whole. More important, it is the exclusion of Noah, who, genealogically, stands precisely ten generations after Adam and ten generations before Abraham, that introduces the varia- tion on the theme of separation which stands at the center of the Patriarchal History. That is, the exclusion of Noah from the rest of humanity transforms the theme of separation from God operating in the Primeval cycle to the dominant theme in God's selection of the Patriarchs, separation for God. The flood itself is narrated in terms that reverse the original creation: "all the fountains of the great deep burst forth, and the windows of the heavens were opened.... And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, birds, cattle, beasts, all swarming creatures that swarm upon the earth, and every man; everything on the dry land in whose nostrils was the breath of life died" (7:11, 21-22). The order that was imposed on the original chaos by the word of God is destroyed, and the death of all flesh echoes the order of its hierarchical creation, culminating in humanity, and destroying all things that were given the breath of life in 1:30 and 2:7. Noah and his family, however, are set apart from the rest of humanity to be preserved as God's chosen, because Noah, like Enoch (5:22), "walked with God" (6:9), and the ark, like the Spirit of God in 1:2, rises above the flood of uncreation and moves "on the face of the waters" (7:18). When God remembers Noah, he re-creates the world, and the blessings that were first given to Adam are reconferred on Noah. Significantly, on the first day of the first month of the six hundred and first year of Noah's life, or the first year of the new creation (8:13), Noah is sent forth from the ark with all the creatures that he preserved to repopulate the earth: Bring forth every living thing that is with you of all flesh - birds and animals and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth- that they may breed abundantly on the earth, and be fruitful and multiply upon the earth. (8:17) The phrasing is a clear echo of the language of the original creation story</page><page sequence="11">Moye: Myth and History in Genesis and Exodus 587 (1:25), and the command to "be fruitful and multiply" is a direct repetition of the original command given to Man and Woman at 1:28. Furthermore, when Noah builds an altar to the Lord and the Lord smells the pleasant odor of Noah's sacrifice, he vows "never again to curse the ground because of man" (8:20-21), thereby revoking, in a sense, the curse pronounced on Adam (3:17) and prefiguring the covenantal promise made to each of the patriarchs of a land that the Lord will give him. In vowing that "while the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night, shall not cease" (8:22), God re-creates, on a new level, the original balanced opposites of creation. Finally, though it is cast in terms of "fear" and "dread,' dominion over the creatures of the earth is restored to Noah (9:2), as it was given to humanity at creation (1:28), and the Lord establishes an uncondi- tional covenant with Noah and his descendants never again to destroy the earth. Clearly, this new creation, with Noah singled out from the rest of humanity and preserved as a new Adam, is presented in narrative terms that recover the original creation and restore the relation between the human and the divine. II. Myth and Genealogy: Transforming the Paradigm It is as if we are beginning again, but this time on a new level. For in allowing that "the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth" even as he vows never again to "curse the ground" (8:21), God allows for the failings of human beings even as he establishes his covenant with them. There is, then, no Eden here, no primal paradise, and yet there is a relation between the human and the divine; the relation exists within the human realm, within history, not in illo tempore. Significantly, this new creation, like the first, is propelled onward into history by a genealogy: the phrase "the sons of Noah" follows the establishment of the covenant (9:18). But as it is propelled onward into history, it is launched toward imperfection and human failure. Noah, like Adam (3:17) and Cain (4:2), becomes a "tiller of the soil" (9:20), drinks too much wine, and is violated by his son Ham, whom he curses, making him a slave to his brothers (9:21-25). After this first new failure, with its attendant curse, there is an extended genealogical list introduced by the phrase "these are the generations of," which is in turn followed by the story of the Tower of Babel. The pattern is precisely the same as the sequence following the story of Cain: an extended genealogical list introduced by the phrase "this is the book of the generations of" is followed by a story of the transgression of human limits in seeking inte- gration with the divine and immortality, the marriages of the sons of God to the daughters of men. The story of the Tower of Babel is paradigmatic not only in terms of its structure and theme but also in the particular way its</page><page sequence="12">588 Journal of Biblical Literature framing genealogical lists serve to express the theme of exclusion and selection. The story of the Tower of Babel can be seen as an etiological tale in- cluded in the narrative to explain a fact introduced in the preceding genea- logical list: the variety of languages and the spread of humanity "abroad on the earth" (10:31-32). But its incorporation into the narrative is really much more subtle and much more revealing: Now the whole earth had one language and few words. And as men migrated from the east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there. And they said to one another, "Come, let us make bricks, and burn them thoroughly." And they had brick for stone, and bitumen for mortar. Then they said, "Come, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth' (11:1-4) The narrative weaves in a number of repetitions from earlier stories, thereby tying this mythical story into the narrative continuum as a whole. More im- portant, though, the repetitions are concerned specifically with the theme of alienation from and the desire for reunion with the divine. Humanity is united in language and seeks only unity with the divine, as the narrative repetition of "east" tells us: "men migrated from the east,' thereby reversing the geographical direction of the exile of Adam and Eve and of Cain "to the east" (3:24 and 4:16) away from Eden. Clearly, the desire of humanity is to return to the original garden of harmony and to become, in effect, "like God" for their desire is to build a "tower with its top in the heavens" and to "make a name" for themselves. The tower, a negative prefiguration of the pillar Jacob sets up at Bethel (which, in itself, is an excellent example of the way that the succeeding historical narratives incorporate and transform details, both narrative and thematic, from the earlier mythical narratives), where he dreamed that he saw the angels of God ascending and descending on a ladder whose top "reached to heaven" (28:12-22), is a common mythical symbol for the mountain of God on which the primeval garden sits; and, in constructing a tower, humanity manifests the desire to recover their original home with God, to return to Eden.'7 Finally, the correlation between the desire for a name and an aspiration for immortality is clarified, not only by the narrative echo of the semidivine offspring of the sons of God and the daughters of men, who were "men of renown" or, more literally, "men of name"'8 and who prompted God to limit the span of human life to 120 years (6:3-4), but also by God's statement that "this is only the beginning of what they will do; and ~7 See also Fishbane, Text and Texture, 37 and chap. 9; Schneidau, Sacred Discontent, 110; Eliade, Myth of the Eternal Return, 12-21; idem, Sacred and Profane, 36-65, esp. 40-41; and Nahum Sarna, Understanding Genesis (The Heritage of Biblical Israel 1; New York: Melton Research Center, 1966; Schocken Books, 1970) 74-75. 18 See Fox, "In the Beginning," 22.</page><page sequence="13">Moye: Myth and History in Genesis and Exodus 589 nothing that they propose will now be impossible for them" (11:6), which recalls his reason for driving Adam and Eve out of Eden in the first place: "lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever" (3:22). But the very terms of the narrative stress humanity's difference and distance from the divine. The tower itself is allied to the city, the degraded human echo of the home God made for humanity introduced by Cain and his descendants.9 The puny tools of humans for building and the insignifi- cance of their own unified speech are (like Adam's "naming") brought into stark contrast with the creative word of God by the humans' repetition of the original phrase of creation: "Let us make" (1:26). Finally, God's reaction to human beings' desire to reach beyond themselves and to become "like God" is to repeat and reinforce the original curse pronounced on Adam and Eve in Eden. The Lord, in an ironic echo of humanity's "Come, let us make" (an ironic echo that amplifies the irony of humanity's echo of divine creative speech), says, "Come, let us go down, and there confuse their language, that they may not understand one another's speech,:' and the Lord fulfills the humans' fear of dispersal, scattering "them abroad over the face of all the earth" (11:7-9). The Lord demolishes the single unity of humanity, the "one language," and, in scattering humans abroad over the whole earth, not only creates division within humanity but also reinforces humanity's separation from himself, making exile from the divine universal. But, as I indicated above, the story of the Tower of Babel is paradigmatic not only in the way it is woven into the narrative of Genesis as a whole thematically and in its repetition of significant motifs and phrases, but also in the way it is connected through the genealogies surrounding it. The Babel narrative is surrounded on both sides by the generations of Shem (10:21-31 and 11:10-32), linking the mythical story to the historical one. But the con- nection between narrative and genealogy is more intricate than a simple sur- rounding would imply. "Shem" means "name,"20 and the verbal play between genealogy and narrative links the two pieces with an ironic echo that is instructive not only because it sets the futile desire for the immortality of "name" at Babel against the purely human "immortality" of the descendants of Shem/Name but also because it points to the way in which the principle of exclusion at work in the myth is ironically contrasted to the way this principle works in the genealogies themselves. The line of Shem/Name leads directly to Abraham, who, like Noah, is set apart from universal humanity to be God's chosen, to be the father of the people chosen by God for "return'" Moreover, to reinforce this transformation of the mythic principle, the genealogies surrounding Babel are not simply a continuation, leading from Shem on the one side of the Babel story to the descendants of Shem on the 19 See also Schneidau, Sacred Discontent, 5; and Fishbane, Text and Texture, 37-38. 20 See Fishbane, Text and Texture, 38, 145 n. 17.</page><page sequence="14">590 Journal of Biblical Literature other. Instead, they are repetitive, picking up and repeating Shem and his descendants from the earlier list. But like all the devices of repetition in the Bible, it is repetition expressly for the purpose of revealing contrast: the repetition shows exactly how the genealogical principle of exclusion and separationfor God works in contrast to and to reverse the thematic principle of alienation from God that I have pointed to in the mythical narratives. The line of Shem described in chapter 10, listing all the sons born to Shem and a number of the sons born to each of Shem's sons, leads from Shem to Eber, the eponymous father of the "Hebrews," to Eber's two sons, Joktan and Peleg. "Peleg,' as the text significantly and deliberately tells us, means "divided" (or, more literally, "splitting"21): "the name of the one was Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided" (10:25). The text illustrates this division not only by prefiguring the division of humanity at Babel but also by carrying down the line of Joktan but not that of Peleg. On the other side of the Babel narrative, however, the genealogy of Shem is repeated, but with a difference. The sons are listed not inclusively but exclusively, listing only a single son for each man and thereby tracing a direct line from Shem to Eber to Peleg (not Joktan), for Peleg is the ancestor of Abraham. Clearly, the repetition of the genealogy of Shem, particularly with the focus and emphasis on Peleg/Division, reveals the principle of division - exclusion and selection - on which those geneal- ogies are constructed. In fact, every genealogical list, both before and after Abraham, works in very much the same way. The generations of Adam, for example, surround the Cain story with the repeated phrase, "and Adam knew his wife" (4:1, 25); following the birth of Seth on the far side of the Cain story, there is the extended genealogical list of "the generations of Adam" (5:1), a phrase that links the human creation to the divine "generations of the heaven and the earth" (2:4a), just as Adam's "naming" is paralleled to the creative "naming" of God in the opening creation story. But the principle of exclusion works in this genealogy just as it does in the others. The sons of Adam from Seth on are listed on the far side of the Cain story almost as if Cain and Abel had never been. There are, however, distinct echoes of the names of the sons of Cain in the names of the sons of Seth, most obviously in the direct repetition of Enoch and Lamech, the first and last of Cain's sons and the two of Seth's sons who are singled out both for their thematic importance - Enoch walked with God (5:22) and Lamech is the father of Noah (5:28)- and in the subtle variation in phrasing at these two points in the genealogical list. It is as if the linguistic echoes of the sons of Cain in the sons of Seth were present specifically to point to the cutting off of the line of Cain and the continuation of humanity in the line of Seth. All of these genealogies serve the purpose of narrowing down universal humanity to the single line that will be God's chosen people.2 21 See Fox, "In the Beginning,' 31. 22 See Fishbane, Text and Texture, 28; and Andriolo, "Genealogy and Worldview,' 1665-66.</page><page sequence="15">Moye: Myth and History in Genesis and Exodus 591 Indeed, the consistent formal pattern of the genealogies reinforces this theme. While the genealogies of the excluded sons are explicitly or implicitly inclusive in their listings, the genealogical lists of the chosen sons, both from Seth to Shem and from Shem to Abram, follow a distinct and different pattern. As the genealogical list that precedes the Babel narrative is explicitly inclusive, so the genealogy of Cain is implicitly inclusive, though, under- standably, it builds to inclusivity, ending with the sons (and the daughter) of Lamech: Jabal, "the father of those who dwell in tents and have cattle"; Jubal, "the father of all those who play the lyre and pipe"; and Tubal-cain, "the forger [and implicitly the father of those who forge] all instruments of bronze and iron" (4:20-22). In contrast, the genealogies of the chosen sons, Seth and Shem, follow a precise, and exclusive, pattern: "When X had lived A years, he became the father of Y. X lived after the birth of Y B years, and had other sons and daughters. When Y had lived C years, he became the father of Z. Y lived after the birth of Z D years, and had other sons and daughters" (5:3-31; 11:10-25). In the first genealogy, of course, there is the additional summing of the years of the father's life and the noting of his death, but in both lists the other sons and daughters are unnamed and dropped out, while the direct line leading to the crucial son is carried down. Moreover, both lists end in exactly the same manner: the first with the three sons of Noah, in- cluding Shem, who is listed first, and the second with the three sons of Terah, including Abram, who also is listed first. There are, of course, perfectly reasonable-and certainly valid-politi- cal and ideological explanations for these various forms of genealogies, but, I would argue, the narratological, the structural, principle at work here is equally striking and equally important. Thus, the genealogies, particularly that of Shem, as it surrounds the narrative of the Tower of Babel (significantly the last mythical narrative of universal humanity), show not only the linking of independent mythical narratives into a historical progression but also the way in which that historical progression itself is informed by, reacts to, and is narrated in terms of those myths. Further, the continuation of this pattern of genealogies serves to link even more tightly the Primeval History and the Patriarchal History, for it is precisely the genealogical principle of exclusion and selection that informs the patriarchal narratives. The intricate interrela- tion of genealogy and mythical narrative, then, serves not only to unify the text as a whole but also to unite the mythical paradigm of dissociation from and reunion with the divine to the historical paradigm of exile and return, which is the informing pattern of the Hebrew Bible as a whole.3 23 That the Hebrew Bible should be informed by this pattern is not surprising, given the historical situation of ancient Israel, particularly for the Priestly writers who drew together the earlier traditions after the Babylonian Exile. See also Fishbane, Text and Texture, chaps. 9 and 10, for an analysis of the recurrence of the motifs of Eden and exodus in the Hebrew Bible as a whole. On the story of exile and return throughout the history of Judaism as a whole, see Jacob</page><page sequence="16">592 Journal of Biblical Literature III. Genealogy and Narrative: Moving Toward History Having, I hope, sufficiently demonstrated the thematic principle of separation from God in the mythical narratives and the genealogical prin- ciple of separationfor God, as well as their interrelation in the transformation of the mythical paradigm of alienation and reunion into the historical, genea- logical pattern of exile and return, perhaps a single example of the continua- tion of the genealogical pattern and a more general discussion of the paradigm of exile and return will suffice to demonstrate their continued interrelation in the Patriarchal History and beyond. Of course, to claim that the separation of God's chosen people from the rest of humanity is the informing principle of the patriarchal narratives really needs no elaborate demonstration. Abraham is separated from his country and from his kindred and then from Lot; Hagar is separated from Sarai, just as Ishmael is separated from Isaac; Jacob and Esau are separated, and Jacob separates Rachel and Leah from their father, Laban; finally, Joseph is separated from his brothers and sent down to Egypt, where he is preserved by God and made successful in order to prepare a place for his father and the brothers who sold him into slavery. The important point, of course, is that even an incident of less-than- crucial significance, the narrative of Abram's separation from Lot (13:8-17), a story that seems originally to have been connected to the account of the origins of the Moabites and the Ammonites (see 19:36-38), is narrated in terms that shape it according to the crucial themes of the initial myths. Abram says to Lot, "Separate yourself from me" and offers him the first choice of where to dwell (13:9). Lot, of course, like Adam and Cain, chooses to go "east": "and Lot journeyed east; thus they were separated from each other" (13:11), with Abram dwelling in Canaan and Lot in Sodom, where the men are "great sinners against the Lord" (13:13). But, at the same time, the genealogical principle of exclusion, though less apparent, is no less impor- tant. Rather than providing an ironic contrast to and a transformation of the thematic principle of separation as it does in the Primeval History, the genealogical principle reinforces the thematic thrust of the Patriarchal History. It is, in fact, in its consistency from part to part, the dominant thread of continuity in Genesis as a whole. The two crucial genealogical lists of the Patriarchal History surround what is commonly called the Jacob Cycle, the stories centering on Jacob from his birth in chapter 25 until the end of chapter 35. (Chapter 36 is entirely genealogical; following the list, the narrative shifts its center to Joseph in chapter 37.) The two genealogical lists that surround the Jacob stories are, significantly, structurally identical. Both are introduced by the death and Neusner's Self-Fulfilling Prophecy: Exile and Return in the History of Judaism (Boston: Beacon Press, 1987).</page><page sequence="17">Moye: Myth and History in Genesis and Exodus 593 burial of a patriarch -Abraham in 25:7-11 and Isaac in 35:28-29 - and both are followed by the introductions to the genealogies of the sons of that patriarch: These are the days of the years of Abraham's life, a hundred and seventy-five years. Abraham breathed his last and died in a good old age, an old man and full of years, and was gathered to his people. Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of Machpelah. ... There Abraham was buried, with Sarah his wife. After the death of Abraham God blessed Isaac his son. And Isaac dwelt at Beerlahairoi. These are the descendants of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's maid, bore to Abraham... [an extended list of descendants follows]. These are the descendants of Isaac, Abraham's son:... [the story of Isaac's prayer to the Lord because of Rebekah's barrenness and the sub- sequent birth of Esau and Jacob follows]. (25:7-19) This passage, clearly a standard, formulaic conclusion to the life of a patriarch and introduction to genealogical lists of that patriarch's sons, is set against the following parallel: Now the days of Isaac were a hundred and eighty years. And Isaac breathed his last; and he died and was gathered to his people, old and full of days; and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him. These are the descendants of Esau ... [a full chapter of descendants follows]. This is the history of the family of Jacob [literally, "these are the begettings of Ya'ddkab," exactly parallel to the phrasing for Esau]24 ... [the story of Joseph's dreams and his brothers' selling him into slavery in Egypt follows]. (35:28-37:2) Clearly, the formulaic announcement of the death and burial of Isaac follows the basic pattern of that of Abraham, though in slightly abbreviated form. But all the crucial elements are there, and the pattern is exactly parallel: a patriarch dies in a good old age and is gathered to his people in a burial per- formed by his two sons; then a genealogy, or what promises to be one, follows for each of the sons. What is most important, however, is the unfulfilled promise of a genealogical list for the favored son. Genealogical lists are provided only for the excluded sons of both patriarchs; and, like the first of the pair of genealogies surrounding the Babel narrative, the lists of descend- ants are inclusive. But where we might expect to find an exclusive genealogi- cal list for the chosen son, corresponding to the second genealogy of Shem at Babel, we find instead "genealogy" as narrative. Once again, as the thematic content of the patriarchal narratives demonstrates, the question at issue is the division between brothers and the separation and selection by God of the favored second son as the father of the chosen people. The thematic pattern is now reinforced by the corresponding pattern of the 24 See Fox, "In the Beginning'," 97, 101.</page><page sequence="18">594 Journal of Biblical Literature genealogies, but the genealogies also add a second consideration. The unfulfilled promise of the genealogical list of the favored sons implies that, whereas the history of the excluded sons can be told as a simple genealogical list, the genealogy of the favored sons must be told as a narrative history. We are, of course, given a straightforward genealogical list of the sons of Jacob, but my point is that the pattern imposed here on the genealogical lists echoes the pattern of the narrative as a whole and the growing emphasis on historical narrative in the second part of Genesis. In fact, the inaccuracy of the trans- lation in the RSV- "this is the history of the family of Jacob" instead of "these are the begettings of Ya'dkbb" -perfectly illustrates the movement toward historical narrative. That narrative history is clearly informed by the paradigm of exile and return. IV. Mythicized History: Exile and Return Of course, the fundamental story of Genesis, from the beginning of the Patriarchal History on, and of Exodus and the Pentateuch as a whole, is the story of Israel's journey down to Egypt- their "exile" from the land given to them by God- and their eventual return to the promised land under the guidance of Moses (along with Joshua) and God. In fact, that story is set before us early in the Patriarchal History in the prophecy God gives to Abram: Then the Lord said to Abram, "Know of a surety that your descendants will be sojourners in a land that is not theirs, and will be slaves there, and they will be oppressed for four hundred years; but I will bring judgment on the nation which they serve, and afterward they shall come out with great possessions" (15:13-14) In the context in which it occurs, this "prophecy" is quite clearly one of the more glaring narrative interpolations. But that it was allowed to stand as it was instead of being smoothed over is, I think, significant; for it indicates its importance in the central theme of Genesis and the Pentateuch as a whole. More important for my argument, however, is the way in which this version of the mythical paradigm established in the Primeval History informs the central sequence of independent stories throughout the rest of Genesis. The first story we have of Abram is the story of his separation from his family and country and his journey to the land of Canaan, which the Lord gives to him and his descendants (12:1-9). But, in fact, Abram's journey con- tinues in the first of a series of narrative episodes all constructed according to the same pattern and focusing on Abraham and on his descendants, Isaac and Jacob and his family. Abram is forced by famine to journey "down to Egypt to sojourn there" (12:10). When he arrives in Egypt, Abram, fearing for his life, passes his wife, Sarai, off as his sister; Pharaoh takes Sarai, and "for</page><page sequence="19">Moye: Myth and History in Genesis and Exodus 595 her sake he dealt well with Abram,' making him wealthy (12:11-16). "But the Lord afflicted Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram's wife"; Sarai is consequently returned to Abram, and they are sent "up from Egypt" with all their possessions (12:17-13:4). After the Lord makes his formal covenant with Abram, promising him a multitude of descendants and the land of Canaan and changing his name to Abraham (17:1-8), Abraham again journeys south to the Negeb to sojourn with Abimelech in Gerar, again passing his wife off as his sister, having her taken and restored, and being sent away enriched (20:1-17). Isaac too is forced by famine to journey south to dwell with Abimelech in Gerar, where he follows the pattern that Abraham had established (26:1-34). Finally, in the most elaborate and most important variation on this narrative pattern, Jacob/Israel and his family are forced by famine to journey "down to Egypt,' where they are protected not by the ruse of passing a wife off as a sister but by the divinely inspired foresight and power of Joseph (41:54-50:14); and all of Israel will ultimately return en- riched, as the opening of Exodus shows, not only with cattle and possessions but with the multitudes promised to Abraham by God. In each of these nar- rative sequences, there is a distinct pattern based on the motif of exile and return. Moreover, the central story of Jacob is the story of his theft of Esau's birthright; his flight from Esau to Laban, his mother's brother, in Haran; his sojourning there; his acquisition not only of Rachel and Leah but of great possessions; and his return to Canaan and reconciliation with Esau (27:1- 37:1).2 Thus, while the obvious differences between these similarly pat- terned scenes provide a sense both of continuity and of progression and change-a sense, in effect, of history-the mythic paradigm of separation from and the desire to return to God established in the creation stories pro- vides the fundamental context within which to understand the "events" that make up the historical analogue of that paradigm, exile and return. But perhaps the best illustration of the way the historic event of Israel's exodus is narrated in terms of that initial mythic paradigm is the story of Israel's reunion with God. Throughout Exodus the journey of Israel is not simply a journey out of Egypt and toward the promised land; it is also a journey toward knowing God. As God says: I will redeem you with an outstretched hand and with great acts of judg- ment, and I will take you for my people, and I will be your God; and you shall know that I am the Lord your God, who has brought you out from 25 Of course, the differences between these sequences are also instructive; for through the progression of scenes there is also a progressive change in the representation of God's action in history from direct action, to dream, to no action at all. This is not, however, so much the disappearance of God from history as the disappearance of God's periodic direct intervention in history, as we learn from Joseph's "explanation" of the divine purpose behind his brothers' sell- ing him into slavery in Egypt: "As for you, you meant evil against me; but God meant it for good, to bring it about that many people should be kept alive, as they are today" (50:20).</page><page sequence="20">596 Journal of Biblical Literature under the burdens of the Egyptians. And I will bring you into the land which I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. (Exod 6:6-8) The people must come to know God, however, in order for that promise to be fulfilled. In fact, their failure to know the God who has brought them up out of Egypt, manifested in their continual murmurings against Moses (e.g., 15:24; 16:2; 17:3) and in their worship of the golden calf while Moses is on the mountain of God receiving the tables of the law (32:1-33:16), is the central problem of Exodus. Moreover, the narrative parallels of the people's murmurings and rebelliousness, of the Lord's angry decision to strike down the people of Israel and to make of Moses a great people instead, and of Moses' intercession on behalf of the people (and on behalf of the Lord's reputation among the Egyptians and other nations) that occur both in the episode of the golden calf and in the subsequent story of the spies in Canaan, where the Lord determines that the generation that came up out of Egypt, except for Joshua and Caleb, shall die in the wilderness (Num 13:1-14:45), suggest that the failure to know God ultimately prevents that generation from reaching the promised land. But Israel does eventually accomplish the journey of coming to know God, and they are reunited with him, not in the promised land but in the wilderness. What is most important, however, is that the story of that reunion is narrated in terms that directly recall the opening story of creation. When Moses returns a second time from the mountain of God with the tables of the law (chap. 34), he also brings God's command that the people of Israel build him a sanctuary so that he "may dwell in their midst" (25:8). The description of the sanctuary that the Lord gives to Moses to command the people to build is narrated in remarkable and extensive detail and ends with the command, "According to all that I have commanded you they shall do" and with the command to keep the sabbath (25:10-31:17). Like Noah, who "did all that God commanded him" (Gen 6:22), and unlike Adam and Eve, who failed to do as the Lord commanded, the people of Israel do "all that the Lord had commanded Moses" (39:32); in fact, the narrative of their building of the sanctuary, beginning immediately after their greatest failure - worshiping not the God who brought them up out of Egypt but the golden calf- not only opens with Moses giving them the command to keep the sabbath, but exactly repeats every detail of God's command to Moses (35:1- 39:43). Thus, the command given to Moses and the fulfillment of that com- mand, resulting in the dwelling of God in the midst of the people of Israel, form a perfect frame around the people's greatest failure, in effect overcoming that failure with the perfect obedience that God had demanded of Adam and Eve. Most important, though, the completion and consecration of the taber- nacle in which the Lord is to dwell are narrated in terms that repeat, or</page><page sequence="21">Moye: Myth and History in Genesis and Exodus 597 recover, the original creation.26 When "Moses saw all the work" that had been done "as the Lord had commanded,"' Moses "blessed" the people (Exod 39:43), just as the Lord had "blessed the seventh day" when he had "finished his work" of creation (Gen 2:2-3). And on the first day of the first month of the second year - that is, on the first day of this second new creation - Moses "erected the tabernacle" (Exod 40:17), exactly "as the Lord had commanded Moses"; the phrase is repeated seven times, once for each day of God's crea- tion, ending with the ritual washing and the approach to the altar, as Moses fulfills each stage of the Lord's commands for erecting the tabernacle (40:1- 15), recalling both the sense and the repetitiveness of the phrasing of the opening creation story- "And God said.... And it was so"-as well as the Lord's celebration of the sabbath on the seventh day. Further, the last verses of this chapter (40:34-38) indicate that, just as the Lord celebrated the sabbath after finishing his creation, so too the sabbath is celebrated when Moses finishes the work. The cloud that descends on the tabernacle is a sign to Israel that they must refrain from the "work" of their journey; only when the cloud is taken up may they go onward. Finally, when "Moses finished the work" (Exod 40:33), as God had "finished his work,"' "the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle" (Exod 40:34), and he dwelt "in their midst" -that is, the people of Israel are reunited with God. The reunion of Israel and God completes, at one level, the narrative of exile and return, and the terms in which that reunion is told make Genesis and Exodus a narrative unit that closes with a repetition of the creation and blessing with which it opened. But, just as we saw in the story of Noah and the flood, this repetition of creation and blessing takes place on a new level. The reunion takes place not in the garden but in the wilderness. Israel does not return to God in the primordial realm in illo tempore that the opening myths present; rather God returns to them in a thoroughly human and historical realm. Israel is no more "like God" than Adam and Eve; only Moses can go up into the mountain of God (Exod 19:12-25), and not even Moses can see God's face (Exod 33:20).27 Moreover, the glory of the Lord that fills the tabernacle is the physical manifestation of God on earth, but it is not God himself, as we can see from Isaiah's vision of God: I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple. Above him stood the seraphim.... And one called to another 26 See also Moshe Weinfeld's discussion of the parallels between Gen 1:1-2:3 and Exod 39:1-40:33 in "Sabbath, Temple, and the Enthronement of the Lord: The Problem of the Sitz im Leben of Genesis 1:1-2:3," in Mvlanges bibliques et orientaux en l'honneur de M. Henri Cazelles (AOAT 212; Kevelaer: Butzon &amp; Bercker, 1981) 501-12. 27 Moses' inability to see God's face is, perhaps, a "correction" -in light of the greater emphasis in Exodus on the physical awesomeness of God and the incommensurability of God and humanity- of the episodes in which Hagar (Gen 16:13) and Jacob (Gen 32:30) claim to have seen God and lived, Jacob stating directly that he has "seen God face to face:</page><page sequence="22">598 Journal of Biblical Literature and said: "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts; and the whole earth is full of his glory." And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke. (6:1-4)28 The parallel between the tabernacle and the temple is a given, but the imagery is also parallel: the throne to the mercy seat, the awesome power to even Moses' inability to enter the tent of meeting (Exod 40:35), the smoke to the cloud; and, above all, the glory is the same. But, as the seraph's call makes clear, the glory of God is not God himself; just as his train fills the temple, his glory fills the earth, but he himself is "holy, holy, holy" Most important: the Hebrew word for "glory," kdb6d, means "weight" or "heaviness" and signifies the physical manifestation of God on earth; the Hebrew root of "holy," qdi, however, has the basic meaning of "separate.'29 That is, God, in his holiness, is wholly separate, wholly other; and his glory, the physical manifestation that fills the earth or the tabernacle, is all that can be seen by humanity. The people of Israel, then, like Adam and Eve, cannot become "like God" by their own efforts; they can only make themselves ready for God to return to them, as he does by dwelling among them in the tabernacle that they obediently build for him. Humanity, as at Babel, cannot go up to God (see Exod 34:3); God must come down to humanity. The glory of the Lord filling the tabernacle is the manifestation of God on earth and in history, just as the eventual return to Canaan is a return not to Eden but, as the move- ment from historicized myth to mythicized history suggests, to its historical and earthly analogue. Thus, the story of the Pentateuch as a whole is preeminently the story of the fall, or the exile, of humanity from the harmony of paradise and the perfect balance and order of God's creation into the disordered realm of human history and the subsequent desire for a reunion with the divine, a reunion that is accomplished not by a return to a mythical Eden but by the manifestation of the divine on earth and within history and by the return to a human and historical version of Eden, the promised land given to the chosen people by God. That story is revealed by the movement within Genesis particularly and the Pentateuch as a whole from historicized myth to mythicized history. That is, the incorporation of independent mythical nar- ratives into a forward-moving, linear narrative through a complex thematic and structural interrelation of mythical form and the historicizing form of genealogy makes "history" of "myth,' while the subsequent narration of the Patriarchal "History" and of the exodus through the interpretive patterns of the original myths makes "myth" of "history." 28 It should be pointed out that, although the basic story of Exodus here definitely precedes Isaiah (eighth century BCE), the formulation of the passage to which Isaiah's vision relates is characteristic of the P document (sixth century). 29 See also Damrosch on the relations established by the Priestly writers between holiness, separation, and exile (Narrative Covenant, 290).</page></plain_text>
