Development of an Improved Dose Reconstruction System for the Techa River Population Affected by the Operation of the Mayak Produc- tion Association. Radiat. Res. 166, 255-270 (2006). The Techa River Dosimetry System (TRDS) has been de- veloped to provide estimates of dose received by approxi- mately 30,000 members of the Extended Techa River Cohort (ETRC). Members of the ETRC were exposed beginning in 1949 to significant levels of external and internal (mainly from 90Sr) dose but at low to moderate dose rates. Members of this cohort are being studied in an effort to test the hypothesis that exposure at low to moderate dose rates has the same ability to produce stochastic health effects as exposure at high dose rates. The current version of the TRDS is known as TRDS-2000 and is the subject of this paper. The estimated doses from 90Sr are supported strongly by -30,000 measure- ments made with a tooth 03-particle counter, measurements of bones collected at autopsy, and -38,000 measurements made with a special whole-body counter that detects the brems- strahlung from 90Y. The median doses to the red bone marrow and the bone surface are 0.21 and 0.37 Gy, respectively. The maximum doses to the red bone marrow and bone surface are 2.0 and 5.2 Gy, respectively. Distributions of dose to other organs are provided and are lower than the values given above. Directions for future work are discussed. C 2006 by Ra- diation Research Society INTRODUCTION Russian and United States scientists have been involved in collaborative research programs under the sponsorship of the U.S.-Russian Joint Coordinating Committee on Ra- diation Effects Research (JCCRER) since 1995. JCCRER Project 1.1 is a comprehensive program to develop im- provements in the dosimetry system for the population ex- posed as a result of releases from the Mayak Production Association (MPA) by providing more in-depth analysis of existing data, further search of existing records for useful data, model development and testing, evaluation of uncer- tainties, verification of procedures, and validation studies of existing and planned results. The specific aim of this project is to enhance reconstruc- tion of external and internal radiation doses for about 30,000 individuals who resided in the valley of the Techa River, which was contaminated in 1949-1956 by discharg- es of liquid radioactive wastes from the MPA. The purpose of the enhanced dose reconstruction is to support compan- ion epidemiological studies of radiogenic leukemia and sol- id cancers (1-4) and of radiogenic disease in an offspring cohort (5). The purposes of this paper are 1. To provide a description of an improved dosimetry sys- tem referred to as the Techa River Dosimetry System- 2000 (TRDS-2000). 2. To summarize updated assessments of external and in- ternal doses calculated for members of the Extended Te- cha River Cohort (ETRC) using the TRDS-2000. 3. To describe quality-assurance work accomplished for the main databases and to describe work on the verification and validation of the models used in the TRDS-2000. 4. To describe preliminary approaches to uncertainty as- sessments for external and internal doses. 5. To outline additional work being undertaken to provide further improvements in the dosimetry system. Population exposure in the Urals region occurred as a re- sult of failures in the technological processes in the Mayak plutonium facility in the late 1940s and early 1950s. A major source of environmental contamination was the discharge of about 1017 Bq of liquid wastes into the Techa River in 1949- 1956. Residents of many villages downstream from the site of release (Fig. 1 and Table 1) were exposed through a va- riety of pathways; the more significant included drinking of water from the river and external y-ray exposure due to proximity to bottom sediments and the shoreline. There are known to be additional sources of exposure for the members I Address for correspondence: University of Utah, P.O.

The location of the MPA is indicated by "Sites of release". of the cohort. One of the more important may be medical exposure that was biased toward those who were known to be more exposed to the liquid effluents from the MPA. These persons were followed closely by a special medical clinic, and they received frequent medical examinations that in- cluded medical diagnostic radiation. Another possibly important source of confounding ex- posure was an explosion in the radioactive waste storage facility in 1957 (the so-called Kyshtym accident) that formed the East Urals Radioactive Trace (EURT) due to dispersion of 7.4 X 1016 Bq of radioactive materials into the atmosphere. Some of this material contaminated villag- es to which persons exposed on the Techa River had been relocated. Other possible sources of confounding exposure include the gaseous aerosol releases from the Mayak facil- ity in 1949-1957 and the windblown contamination from Lake Karachay when it dried out in 1967. The series of radioactive releases that occurred in the same region in different years and the intensive migration (many persons were evacuated or relocated) of the popu- lation within the contaminated area are specific features of the situation in the Urals. This determined the approach to follow-up: selecting a fixed cohort and tracing all places of residence for each subject in the cohort since the beginning of radioactive contamination. The Cohorts of Interest In 1968, the Techa River Registry was created at the Urals Research Center for Radiation Medicine (URCRM) with the goal of including residents of villages along the Techa River who lived there during the period of high ex- posure from 1949 through 1952. The registry now includes data on 24,988 such persons, and these persons have been identified as members of the original Techa River Cohort (TRC). The TRC has been studied for several decades by scientists from the URCRM, and an increase in both leu- kemia and solid cancers with radiation dose has been noted (1, 4). These findings suggest that, with continuing im- provements in the quality of the follow-up and dosimetry, study of the TRC has the potential to provide quantitative estimates of the risks of stochastic health effects produced by chronic low-dose-rate radiation exposure in the general population. In more recent times, the Extended Techa River Cohort (ETRC)2 has been created; it includes the original TRC and 2 The exact number of the members of the cohort has changed over time, as analysis and verification have proceeded. For example, a sub- stantial number of duplicate entries has been eliminated, most of which were due to inclusion of maiden and married names of women. More details concerning the composition and number of the members of the cohort are given in refs.

This ETRC is the master cohort from which subcohorts can and are being drawn for analysis and for whom it is desirable and possible to calculate individ- ualized3 internal and external doses. The development of this cohort has been described in refs. (3, 4); the number of cohort members in September 2004 was 29,873. The ETRC has many desirable features in terms of its continuing epidemiological study: 1. The cohort consists of unselected members of the gen- eral population. 2. Members of the cohort are relatively old at this time; the youngest member is more than 50 years old. 3. The years at risk are relatively large, about 50 years. 4. The doses received by this population are relatively large; 3.2% of the members have total red bone marrow doses of &gt;1 Gy; in addition, some members of the co- hort have external doses of up to 0.4 Gy. Further, the URCRM Registry includes data on about 29,700 persons exposed in utero and/or the progeny of ex- posed parents. Twelve thousand such persons who are the children of TRC members have been identified as the Techa 3 We use the term "individualized" dose in this paper to describe doses that are calculated by taking into account the residence history and age of a person. However, the doses are not yet truly individual in the sense that a particular person's body burden measurements and intra-village locations are not used directly. Rather, village averages of intake functions and distances from the contaminated river are used; improvements are under way that will allow for the calculation of "individual" doses.</page><page sequence="4">258 DEGTEVA ET AL. River Offspring Cohort (TROC). Study of the TROC has the potential to provide direct data on radiogenic health effects in progeny due to the exposure of their parents to chronic low-dose-rate radiation. MATERIALS AND METHODS The method of dose reconstruction used is the traditional one of con- sidering the source term, following the releases through the environment, and evaluating the exposure pathways to humans. However, in this case, the source-term data are limited, because the releases were not recognized immediately; dependence upon the limited source-term data and the ap- plication of environmental transfer models alone would result in esti- mated doses with large uncertainties. Therefore, the traditional approach has been supplemented to the extent possible by reliance upon measure- ments of external y-ray exposure rates and of radionuclide concentrations in the environment. Of most value were the measurements of long-lived 9?Sr in the teeth and skeleton of the members of the cohort. Instrumental and Radiochemical Measurements Over the years a variety of measurements have been made, including the external y-ray exposure rate along the banks of the Techa River and in the affected villages, the P-particle activity in sediments, and the 9"Sr activity in samples of bones and teeth collected at autopsy (or teeth ex- tracted for reasons of dental health). Other than the two specific mea- surement systems described below, these measurements and their results have been tabulated in ref. (6) and will not be described further here. Two measurement systems, the tooth P-particle counter (TBC) and the bremsstrahlung whole-body counter, have been particularly useful in de- fining the patterns and amounts of intake of the main dose-forming ra- dionuclide, 9?Sr; these two systems are described in more detail below. 1. Tooth f-particle counter Because the radionuclide of primary interest is 91Sr, which is incor- porated into tooth tissue as well as into bones, a variety of methods have been sought to quantify the occurrence of 9"Sr in tooth tissue. One of the more useful techniques has been the use of specially developed gas-flow Geiger-Mtiller detectors (7, 8) for in vivo measurement of surface P3- particle activity of the four front teeth. The diameter of the tooth P3- particle counter was 1 cm. Such measurements were performed from 1959 through 1997, and about 30,000 measurements have been performed on more than 15,000 individual persons. These data, while relative in nature, have been extremely useful in defining the periods of intake, i.e., the periods when the releases to the river were occurring. 2. Whole-body counter The data set of whole-body counter measurements is critical to the success of efforts to provide individual doses. The URCRM whole-body counter, the SICH-9.1, was used from 1974 to 1998 to measure 90Sr, '37Cs and 40K in people (9). Quantification of 9?Sr was achieved by measuring with a phoswich detector the bremsstrahlung of 9oY (decay product of 9oSr) p3 particles of high energy; for this purpose, scanning-bed geometry enclosed in a special shielding room was used (9). Analyses of 137Cs and IoK were accomplished at the same time with the same detector by the measurement of their photopeaks (photons with energy ranges 620-740 keV and 1400-1580 keV, respectively). After the original calibration of the whole-body counter in 1973, about 38,000 measurements were carried out during the next 25 years on about 20,000 people; the number of persons measured with both the tooth P3-particle counter and the whole- body counter was 14,306. The lower limit of reliable detection for 90Sr with the whole-body counter has been evaluated as 2.0 kBq (10); the maximal activity of 90Sr measured for an individual was 190 kBq. De- tailed analyses of the whole-body counter data have been given in refs. (9, 10). An autopsy program had been under way at the URCRM during the period 1951-1989 (11). This autopsy program included radiochemical measurements of 90Sr in bone samples from autopsies of Urals residents and was ended only after 21 members of the ETRC were measured in vivo with the whole-body counter and their 90Sr body burdens, derived from whole-body count measurements, were validated by the results of the analysis of post mortem samples (11). The consistency of these two methods was confirmed, and this serves as a major quality assurance check for the critically important whole-body counter data. In addition, to validate the whole-body counter data set, the measure- ment system was once again calibrated in 1998 using a specially con- structed anthropomorphic phantom (12) that contains 90Sr distributed through simulated bones and another set of phantoms containing uni- formly distributed 40K and 137Cs. The strontium phantom (FST-06T) is shaped as an anatomical model of ICRP Reference Man (13) and contains an activity of 44 ? 2 kBq of 91Sr (plus an equal amount of its decay product 9oY) distributed uniformly in the skeleton mass. The design of this phantom has been described in detail (12). The calibration factors obtained in 1973 and in 1998 agreed quite well-the more important ones are within a few percent, and all factors agree within 16%. The results of the repeated calibration with the FST- 06T phantom confirmed the reliability and credibility of the data set of multiple whole-body counter measurements. The condition in 1998 of the original SICH-9.1 detectors and electronic equipment was poor. To provide for the continuation of the individual body-burden monitoring program, a new set of detectors and a new elec- tronic system for spectrum analysis were specified and purchased. It was decided to use the same shielding room and the same geometry of mea- surements (scanning bed) as well as the same type of detectors (phos- wich). Figure 2 demonstrates several views of the new set of equipment with the FST-06T phantom placed as a "subject" undergoing measure- ment. The URCRM Databases There are several databases located at the URCRM that are used jointly by dosimetrists and epidemiologists working together on population risk assessment projects. Database MAN. One of the more important URCRM databases is da- tabase MAN; the details are indicated in Fig. 3. The purpose of database MAN is to be the central repository of all "input" data pertaining to a member of the Techa River Cohort. This information includes all iden- tification data; pedigree or family information; data on migration from location to location; all known addresses; information on the deceased at time of death, etc.; the cause(s) of death; the diagnoses in addition to and including the cause(s) of death; and available information on measure- ments of body burdens of radionuclides and P-particle counts of teeth. All information pertaining to a particular member of the registry is ac- cessed through an identification code or IC. Database ENVIRONMENT. This database contains available data on source terms, measurements of radionuclides in river water and sediment, and external y-ray exposure rates in the environment. In addition, hydro- logical data pertaining to the Techa River are included. Much of the material that has served as the basis of the derivation of this database has been described in ref. (6). This database is the responsibility of the URCRM Environmental Department and the Biophysics Laboratory and is available to the other groups. The link between databases MAN and ENVIRONMENT is through a "settlement code," which is the same identifier both for the residence place of exposed persons and for all environmental measurements in this site. Other databases. There are several other databases that contain primary data and that can be used for risk analysis. The more important are the Tumor and Autopsy Registries. The Tumor Registry contains about 25,500 copies of Regional Cancer Dispensary notifications for the resi- dents of the catchment area, and the Autopsy Registry contains post mor-</page><page sequence="5">DOSE RECONSTRUCTION FOR RESIDENTS ON THE TECHA RIVER 259 FIG. 2. Several views of the updated whole-body counter with the new phantom placed as a "subject" to be measured. tem diagnoses and 90Sr measurements in bone samples for 6,024 subjects who lived in the Urals. Both registries have been matched to the Techa River Registry. These two registries were found to include data for mem- bers of the ETRC concerning about 4,000 tumors and 1,097 measured samples of bones. Freezing of the Cohorts and Databases for Analysis Personal data and residence-history data for subjects under observation are occasionally updated and corrected in accordance with newly received archival documents, interviews and other data. On the basis of such new information, subjects are sometimes moved from one cohort to another within database MAN. Also, status changes through a variety of processes such as death, marriage or migration; newly born persons are added to the Offspring Cohort. Updated information of these and other types is occasionally entered into the appropriate databases. At various times in the past, the ETRC and its associated databases have been "frozen" for analysis. Thus, while work continues on follow- ing up members of the cohort and in improving the dosimetry, these changes are not implemented on a piecemeal approach. Rather, at selected dates of "freezing" the cohort and its databases for analysis, the changes that have progressed incrementally over several years are implemented at once for future analysis. The dates of the "freezings" are mutually agreed upon by the epidemiologists and dosimetrists involved in joint study on radiation risk analysis. The most recent freeze occurred on Sep- tember 2004 with updates on the epidemiological follow-up as of that date and with the previously planned 2001 update of the dosimetry sys- tem; data given in this paper refer to the September 2004 freeze. Future plans include a freeze for about 2006. The current dosimetry system is referred to as TRDS-2000, although the actual date of the implementation was delayed until 2001. Major activities leading to improvements in the TRDS-2000, in comparison to the previous dosimetry systems (1, 14), include: 1. A comprehensive, analytical review (6) of historical data on radio- nuclide releases to the Techa River, measured concentrations of radio- nuclides in water and in sediments of the Techa River, hydrological data, and measured external y-ray exposure rates at and near the river. 2. The development (15) of a river model to describe the time- and dis- tance-dependent radionuclide concentrations and exposure rates along the Techa River. 3. Use of the river model and other data to compute individual body- burden histories and resulting internal doses (16) from all radionu- clides, including short-lived radionuclides that had not been included in previous dose estimates.</page><page sequence="6">260 DEGTEVA ET AL.

A major revision (17) in the computation of external dose based on the upgraded TRDS approach, the river model, a re-evaluation of all measurements of external y-ray exposure rates near the shoreline and in the living areas, and a re-examination of data pertaining to the amounts of time spent near the river and in other locations. 5. Evaluation for the first time of the uncertainty in the calculated doses for members of the ETRC (18). A preliminary description of the general approaches and initial data sets used for the creation of the TRDS was provided by Degteva et al. (19). The TRDS is designed as a modular database processor. That is, depending on the input data for an individual, various elements of several TRDS databases are combined to provide the dosimetric variables re- quested by the user. The input data include the following information for each member of the ETRC: identification code, year of birth, year of entry to the catchment area, year of migration from the catchment area, year of vital status determination, and residence history within the con- taminated areas. These data are prepared and updated by members of the Registry Department who are working on companion epidemiological studies.

TRDS Databases The TRDS relies on a number of system databases to compute doses for each cohort member. A summary of the system databases is presented in Table 2. These databases were prepared during the course of research performed in the framework of the current project. A full description of the models and data sets used for production of the TRDS databases is provided in refs. (16, 17, 20). To reconstruct annual dose rates near the river and within residence areas [PLi,,, kLut/Riv, ki,,n, (database TECHJEXT)], all available results of exposure-rate measurements near the Techa River were retrieved from the URCRM archives and databases (17). To fill the gaps in measured data the Techa River Model (15) that describes radionuclide transport from the site of release along the river and accumulation of radionuclides by bottom sediments was used. Dose rates in air on the riverbanks were calculated on the basis of modeled radionuclide concentrations in bottom sediments; for this purpose, coefficients (21) obtained by Monte Carlo TABLE 4 Typical Life Patterns for Different Age Groups of the Techa Riverside Residents (17, 22) Time spent at specified site, hours per year Shoreline Residence Far from the river Age group, (summer area (out- Residence (uncontaminated years time) doors) area (indoors) territory) &lt;7 45 2235 6480 0 7-15 150 2130 5760 720 16-59 150 1410 3960 3240 &gt;60 150 2490 6120 0</page><page sequence="8">262 DEGTEVA ET AL.

The data (22) in Table 3 are examples of measured data on dose rates near the river for two selected settlements: Metlino, from which residents were relocated in 1956, and Muslyumovo, from which residents were not relocated. The number, quality and vari- ability of such data have been described in refs. (6, 17, 18). Model behavior factors T1, T2 and T3 (database REGIME) were derived from observational data and questionnaires (17) from the 1950s of typical lifestyle patterns for different age groups of Techa Riverside residents. Table 4 presents data on behavior factors for different age groups. No systematic differences in time spent near the riverbank were observed for men and women; men spent more time fishing, but women spent more time washing clothes in the river. Age-dependent conversion factors from absorbed dose in air to ab- sorbed dose in organs, A,, (database DOS.F), were taken from the liter- ature (21, 23). Table 5 provides examples of data on conversion factors for different age groups. As indicated in the basic dose equation, a key parameter in determining internal dose is the annual average-intake function, I,,,, of radionuclide r in year y at location L. This function is estimated from measurements of radionuclides in residents of Techa River villages. The function has four factors: intakes of 9oSr as a function of calendar year in adult resi- dents of the village of Muslyumovo (database REPER); the ratio of 9"Sr intakes as a function of age and calendar year for children to that for adults in Muslyumovo (database CHILD); the ratio of 9"Sr intakes in other villages to that in Muslyumovo (database NUCL.STC); and the annual ratios of the intakes of other radionuclides to the intake of 9"Sr (database NUCLSTC). The most important radionuclide from a dosimetric standpoint for the affected population is 9"Sr; this radionuclide has received special attention for the determination of the intake function. The details of the derivation of the 90Sr intake function have been discussed (24). Basically, inference of the intake function is based on P-particle measurements of tooth sur- faces of residents of villages on the Techa River. Data for the residents of Muslyumovo are used as a reference, because this village has a sig- nificant population of about 3000 persons and has been investigated in the most detail since it is the most contaminated of the still-occupied villages. Table 6 shows the levels of 90Sr intake for the adult (those born prior to 1940) and children's cohorts of residents of the reference settle- ment Muslyumovo. To reconstruct 90Sr intake for other settlements, it was assumed that the ratio of mean intake to the mean intake at Muslyumovo is equal to the ratio of the mean age-standardized 90Sr contents in the skeleton (by statistical analysis of whole-body counter data, which are described be- low) for the investigated settlement relative to Muslyumovo. As can be seen, the relative levels of intake depend on the distance from the site of release and the main sources of drinking water supply (Table 7). Age-dependent mean annual intake levels for '137Cs and short-lived ra- dionuclides were calculated on the basis of the following assumptions. Because most of the ingestion of radionuclides occurred with the con- sumption of river water in 1950-1952, intakes of 137Cs and short-lived radionuclides were derived from estimates of age-dependent intakes of 90Sr scaled in terms of the radionuclide composition of the river water. The ratios of radionuclide concentrations to 90Sr as functions of calendar year and distance downstream from the site of release were calculated using the Techa River Model described in ref. (15). The TRDS database contains age-dependent mean annual intake levels of 9"Sr, 9oSr, 95Zr, 95Nb, "03 ?6R 106Ru, 37Cs and 141.144Ce (Table 8). This list of radionuclides is complete for the source term reported by Mayak experts [see ref. (6)]. Most dose conversion factors for internal exposure (DFro,,-) were based on ICRP Publication 67 (25). An exception to this was made for 9?Sr, which is the major dose-forming radionuclide for the Techa River residents and has been under special investigation. "9Sr body burdens and tooth P-particle counts have been measured for about half of the original members of the TRC (including all age groups, all villages, and long periods after the onset of contamination). This database provides an ob- jective basis for the development and validation of biokinetic models. As demonstrated in refs. (26, 27), the ICRP 67 biokinetic model for stron- tium is not in complete agreement with the detailed and long-term results of study of the Techa River residents. Therefore, for the calculation of dose conversion factors (examples are shown in Table 9) for 89,90Sr, the biokinetic model developed on the basis of Techa River data is used (16). No differences due to gender were used in the TRDS-2000. Approach to Estimating Uncertainties The TRDS-2000 calculation of uncertainty is based on stochastic ap- plication of Eq. (1). The mean, median, percentiles and other descriptive parameters of the individuals' radiation doses are calculated using Monte TABLE 6 Example Values of Annual 90Sr Intake for Different Age Cohorts of Residents of the Reference Settlement Muslyumovo on the Techa River Calendar Intake of 9oSr for members of the following birth (by calendar year) cohorts, Bq year-' year &lt;1940 1945 1946 1947 1948 1949 1950 2.08 x 106 1.37 X 106 1.19 X 106 9.78 x 105 7.50 x 105 4.99 x 105 1951 4.70 x 105 3.76 x 105 3.41 x 105 3.07 x 105 2.68 x 105 2.21 x 105 1952 4.62 x 105 4.15 x 105 3.93 x 105 3.66 x 105 3.39 x 105 3.10 x 105 1953 8.61 X 104 8.30 X 104 8.02 X 104 7.75 X 104 7.39 X 104 7.11 X 104 1954 1.92 X 104 1.91 x 104 1.89 x 104 1.85 x 104 1.82 x 104 1.77 x 104 1955 1.38 X 104 1.38 X 104 1.38 x 104 1.38 X 104 1.38 X 104 1.38 X 104 1956 6.90 x 103 6.90 x 103 6.90 x 103 6.90 x 103 6.90 x 103 6.90 x 103 1957 5.88 x 103 5.88 x 103 5.88 x 103 5.88 x 103 5.88 X 103 5.88 x 103 1958 4.93 x 103 4.93 x 103 4.93 x 103 4.93 x 103 4.93 x 103 4.93 x 103 1959 3.39 x 103 3.39 x 103 3.39 x 103 3.39 x 103 3.39 x 103 3.39 X 103</page><page sequence="9">DOSE RECONSTRUCTION FOR RESIDENTS ON THE TECHA RIVER 263 TABLE 7 Relative Annual 90Sr Intake (Relative to Muslyumovo) for Several Settlements Distance from the Main sources of drinking water Location factor, Settlement site of release, km listed in order of importance fLS Metlino 7 Techa River and wells 0.72 Asanovo 33 Techa River and wells 0.76 Nadyrov Most 48 Wells and Techa River 0.51 Ibragimovo 54 Techa River 1.5 Isaevo 60 Techa River and wells 0.66 Muslyumovo 78 Techa River 1.0 Kurmanovo 88 Techa River 0.72 Brodokalmak 109 Wells and Techa River 0.29 Russkaya Techa 138 Wells and Techa River 0.32 N.

The required inputs for these analyses have been de- veloped during the course of Project 1.1. The actual results vary depend- ing on the analysis being undertaken, i.e., the specific individual, the calculational end point year Y, organ of interest o, and route of exposure (internal or external). The preliminary results for the evaluation of uncertainty in individual doses are not currently being used for risk derivation purposes, and the results will not be described here. A more complete discussion of the evaluation of uncertainty in doses calculated with TRDS-2000 has been given in ref. (18). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The organs for which doses are calculated are red bone marrow, bone surface, stomach wall, small intestinal wall, upper large intestinal wall, lower large intestinal wall, tes- tes, ovaries and uterus. It is possible to include other organs for which dose coefficients have been tabulated by the ICRP. In general, the criterion for the calculation of dose to a specific organ is whether the dose to that organ is significantly different from the average dose to the other organs. Cumulative doses are provided for each person on a year- by-year basis starting from the first year of exposure (1950 for those who lived on the Techa River at the onset of contamination or the year of migration to Techa Riverside communities). The calculational end point, Y, can vary ac- cording to the analyst's wishes; for a particular individual, it might be the year of death, the year of exit from the cohort due to migration, the year of vital status determi- nation, or the date of "fixing" the cohort for analysis. Y could also be any or all of the above minus some presumed latent period for cancer induction. Also, it is possible to perform specific calculations, if desired by the analyst, for TABLE 8 Relative Intake of Radionuclides at Various Distances from the Site of Releasea Settlement Radionuclide intake relative to local 90Sr (distance) Calendar years 89Sr 95Zr 95Nb 103Ru 106Ru 137CS 141,144Ce Metlino (7 km) 1950-1951 7.1 X 10-1 2.0 x 10-1 4.0 X 10-1 1.7 X 10-1 8.0 X 10-1 1.4 6.2 X 10-2 1952 4.9 x 10-3 4.0 x 10-3 5.0 X 10-3 2.9 X 10-4 4.1 X 10-1 1.4 2.7 X 10-2 1953 3.4 x 10-5 8.0 x 10-5 9.6 x 10-5 4.8 x 10-7 2.1 x 10-1 1.4 1.1 X 10-2 Muslyumovo (78 km) 1950-1951 6.8 X 10-1 7.8 X 10-2 2.1 X 10-1 1.3 X 10-1 6.4 X 10-1 2.8 X 10-1 3.2 X 10-2 1952 4.7 X 10-3 1.6 X 10-3 2.0 X 10-3 2.2 x 10-4 3.3 x 10-' 2.8 X 10-1 1.3 X 10-2 1953 3.2 X 10-5 3.1 X 10-5 3.7 X 10-5 3.7 x 10-7 1.7 X 10-1 2.8 X 10-1 5.7 X 10-3 Brodokalmak (109 km) 1950-1951 6.7 X 10-1 5.2 x 10-2 1.6 x 10-1 1.2 x 10-1 5.8 x 10-1 1.4 x 10-1 2.4 X 10-2 1952 4.6 x 10-3 1.0 X 10-3 1.3 X 10-3 2.0 X 10-4 3.0 X 10-1 1.4 X 10-1 1.0 X 10-2 1953 3.2 X 10-5 2.0 x 10-5 2.5 X 10-5 3.3 x 10-7 1.5 x 10-1 1.4 X 10-1 4.3 X 10-3 Zatechenskoye (237 km) 1950-1951 6.3 x 10-1 9.4 x 10-3 4.7 X 10-2 7.3 X 10-2 3.9 X 10-1 7.6 X 10-3 6.9 X 10-3 1952 4.3 x 10-3 1.9 X 10-4 2.5 X 10-4 1.2 X 10-4 2.0 X 10-1 7.6 x 10-3 2.9 X 10-3 1953 3.0 X 10-5 3.7 X 10-6 4.5 X 10-6 2.0 X 10-7 1.0 X 10-1 7.6 x 10-3 1.2 x 10-3 Note.

Figure 4 (lower) presents the distributions of internal dose in red bone mar- row, bone surface, upper large intestine, and lower large intestine among the members of the ETRC. More than half of the people have internal red bone marrow doses between 0.1 and 0.5 Gy. Absorbed doses in cells on the bone surface have distributions similar to those for the red bone marrow, but the values are about two times higher. Most of these doses are due to 9?Sr, but the new (TRDS-2000) values include contributions from additional radionuclides. For the four organs shown, doses for the upper large intestine are the lowest, with 50% of the doses between 0.009 and 0.06 Gy; doses to the lower large intestine are two to three times higher than the doses for the upper large intestine. The primary radionuclide contributing to doses to tissues other than bone is 137Cs. Calculations of external dose show that the new assess- ments are significantly lower than those published in 1994 (14). Figure 4 (upper) shows the new distribution of exter- nal dose; about half of the doses are between 0.0017 and 0.0062 Gy. The distributions of total dose accumulated through 1990 for 29,873 members of the ETRC are shown in Table 10. The majority of persons received soft-tissue doses within the range of 1-10 mGy, 10-100 mGy for the colon and 100-1000 mGy for the red bone marrow and bone surface. The maximum dose was 5.2 Gy to the bone surface. Estimates of dose to the red bone marrow are as large as 2 Gy, with mean and median values of 0.30 and 0.21 Gy, respectively. On average, 92% of the red bone marrow dose is due to internal P-particle emitters, and 90Sr alone contributes 89% of the total red bone marrow dose. In con- trast, about 70% of the dose to the stomach and most other soft tissues is on average due to external exposure, with the remainder due mainly to the ingestion of 137Cs. However, the dose to the lower large intestine is higher and ranges up to 1.1 Gy; most of the lower large intestine dose is due to the ingestion of radiostrontium and other radionuclides with poor intestinal absorption.

The upper part of the table gives the distributions of dose by percentiles. The lower part of the table gives the percentage of the population within several dose ranges. Values in boldface indicate the dose range received by the majority of the population. lower large intestine dose is due to internal exposure, and 90Sr alone contributes 33% of the total dose. The key factor that determines the level of external dose for a person is the distance of the residence location from the site of the release. This factor is also important for internal dose, but for dose to the red bone marrow, the more important factor is the age of the person during the period of releases. Due to the age dependences of mineral metab- olism, persons in their teens during the period of releases received maximal levels of red bone marrow and bone sur- face exposure. Quality Assurance Much of the work accomplished as the main part of this project is of the nature of quality control/quality assurance. The models and databases used in TRDS-2000 have been validated by comparison with experimental data (as dis- cussed below). One of the primary aspects of the overall project has been the recalibration of the URCRM whole- body bremsstrahlung counter, which is a critical component of the study in terms of providing primary data for the reconstruction of internal dose. The situation for this dose reconstruction effort is highly unusual in that about half of the individuals making up the original TRC have been counted at least once in the unique URCRM whole-body counter; thus the body burdens of the most significant (in terms of dose) radionuclide, 90Sr, have been measured di- rectly. The 90Sr body burdens measured for the TRC mem- bers have been used for the development of an age-depen- dent strontium metabolic model (this model has been used to produce TRDS-2000 databases SR90 and SR89) and for the reconstruction of the relative 90Sr intakes for the Techa Riverside settlements (TRDS-2000 database NUCLSTC). 1. Validation of the strontium biokinetic model An age-dependent strontium biokinetic model was elab- orated for dose estimation for residents of the villages along the Techa River (16, 28). This model takes into account changes in metabolic parameters throughout the entire life of the subject, beginning with bone formation and growth in childhood and including loss of skeletal calcium in old age. Age dependences for the model parameters were ob- tained by fits to available data sets of 90Sr measurements in humans. Data with different schedules of intake were used for parameter evaluation: (1) the age dependence of long- term 90Sr body burdens as measured by the whole-body counter of the residents of Muslyumovo on the Techa River in 1976 (28); (2) United Kingdom (national survey) and United States (New York and San Francisco) data on 90Sr from global fallout as reported in refs. (29, 30); and (3) experimental data for a single intake of 85Sr in volunteers (31). To validate the age-dependent biokinetic model for stron- tium, model predictions were compared with experimental data other than those used for the evaluation of model pa- rameters (28, 32). It has been found that model predictions are in reasonable agreement with the measurements of global 90Sr in children's bones from the Glasgow survey</page><page sequence="12">266 DEGTEVA ET AL. 80 \ A autopsy data 60920 WBC data 60 - C- 40 - 20 - ~- , g 0 9 190 1 C I 50 40 \ autopsy data &amp;2 1920 O WBC data C 30 \ 20 J I \b 10 I o 1 1900 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 Calendar year FIG. 5.

In addition, model calculations were compared with measured levels for adults (autopsy data plus whole-body counter data obtained after 1976) obtained from 40 years of obser- vation on the Techa River. Figure 5a shows the mean levels for the upper- and mid-Techa region, where the measure- ments were started in 1951, and Fig. 5b shows the mea- surements for the lower reaches, which were started after 1956. Two model curves outline the corridor of values for age cohorts included in the measurements. The consistency of model calculations and measured values is obvious. In addition, predictions of 90Sr body burden were per- formed using URCRM and ICRP67 (25) biokinetic models for the area contaminated as a result of the Chernobyl ac- cident (7-12 years after the accident) and for Muslyumovo on the Techa River (30-45 years after the onset of contam- ination). The comparison of these calculations with the re- sults of actual measurements (autopsy data obtained in 1993-1998 for the Zhitomir Oblast contaminated as a result of the Chernobyl accident and whole-body counter mea- surements obtained in 1978-1994 for the residents of Mus- lyumovo) has been described (26). This comparison has demonstrated that both biokinetic models (URCRM and ICRP 67) satisfactorily describe the measurements for adults in the case of the Chernobyl accident. Applied to other ages, the URCRM model curves are in good agree- ment with 90Sr body burdens measured with the SICH-9.1 whole-body counter between 1978 and 1994 for all age cohorts of the Muslyumovo residents. (Recall that whole- body counter data obtained in 1974-1978 only have been used for model parameter evaluation.) The ICRP 67 model predictions were found to be higher than the whole-body counter data for people aged 10-20 years at the onset of intake and lower by a factor about 1.5-1.8 for children aged 1-5 years at the onset of intake (26). The consistency between the URCRM strontium bioki- netic model calculations and the results of actual measure- ments in humans of different ages for different schedules of intake and for periods as long as 45 years after intake assures the reliability of this model used in TRDS-2000 for the calculation of internal doses due to 90Sr. 2. Validation of the Techa River Model The Techa River Model was developed to reconstruct radionuclide concentrations in water and sediments for the early period of contamination between 1949 and 1951. This model is used in TRDS-2000 for the calculation of relative intakes of 137Cs and short-lived radionuclides (database NUCL.STC) and for the reconstruction of exposure rates on the riverbank (database TECH.EXT) for the period 1949-1951, when there were no appropriate measurements. As demonstrated in ref. (15), this model successfully cor- relates the rates of releases as reconstructed by the Mayak experts, hydrological data, and available environmental monitoring data. Two data sets have been used to evaluate model parameters: 1. Results of experiments on physical modeling of radio- nuclide behavior in different kinds of artificial reservoirs carried out in 1953-1954 in the Urals. 2. Measurements of specific 3-particle activity in the water of the Techa River along the distance from the site of release for 1951. Parameter estimates obtained for the Techa River are compatible with values published in the literature for a sim- ilar watercourse (35). Also, the calculated rates of change of 90Sr and 137Cs concentrations in water for the period of massive releases are in reasonable agreement with the re- sults of measurements of these long-lived radionuclides performed in the 1960s and 1970s for flood-plain soils ex- tensively contaminated in 1951 (15). The Techa River Mod- el predictions are also validated by experimental data on radionuclide concentration in bottom sediments (these data have not been used for the evaluation of model parameters). An important result of the modeling was the ability to reconstruct external y-ray dose rates in air near the river- bank. These dose rates were calculated for 1950-1951 on</page><page sequence="13">DOSE RECONSTRUCTION FOR RESIDENTS ON THE TECHA RIVER 267 the basis of modeled and measured radionuclide concentra- tions in bottom sediments using two different methods, and the results showed reasonable agreement with each other (15). The results of analogous calculations performed for 1952 were validated by actual measurements. The close agreement of the values calculated using both approaches and measurement results provides assurance that the levels of river-system contamination in 1949-1950 and the exter- nal y-ray dose rates reconstructed using this model are re- liable. 3. Possibilities for the validation of external doses Because substantial uncertainty is attached to the esti- mates of external dose, validation of the new assessments of external dose is an issue of major importance. There is an unsubstantiated allegation (36) that the current calcula- tions of external dose are low by a factor of three to five. The more useful, accepted methods of validation are mea- surements of luminescence of quartz extracted from bricks and, more importantly, the measurement of dose in teeth of members of the ETRC through the technique of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). Fluorescence in situ hy- bridization (FISH) is also a possible technique for valida- tion of external dose. The applicability of the use of "natural" solid-state do- simeters such as quartz (a component of bricks) and hy- droxyapatite (a component of tooth and bone tissue) has been investigated within the framework of this JCCRER Project and a separate project supported by the European Commission (the Coordinator is Dr. Peter Jacob, GSF, Ger- many). Samples of bricks from abandoned (but still stand- ing) buildings located near the Techa shoreline were col- lected, the quartz was extracted from the bricks, and doses were assessed using luminescence methods (37, 38). Monte Carlo simulations of doses accrued in bricks were per- formed for the geometries of exposure specific to the sam- ple sites on the basis of the dose rates in air near the shore- line as reconstructed with the Techa River Model. It was found that the calculated and measured doses in bricks are in reasonable agreement (37, 38). This early study dem- onstrated the potential of the luminescence method in com- bination with Monte Carlo simulations of radiation trans- port at sampling sites for the validation of environmental doses in the upper and middle Techa region. More advanced studies have been reported recently by Jacob and colleagues (39, 40) for samples taken in Metlino; the results again show that the calculational approach used in the TRDS- 2000 is confirmed by the analysis of quartz taken from fixed locations. An initial pilot study (41, 42) was performed to measure dose received by teeth as determined by EPR analysis. The applicability of EPR for retrospective individual dose eval- uation was confirmed. This method, based on measure- ments of samples collected for dental health reasons, also provides the capability for validation of estimates of un- certainty in assessment of external dose. An analysis of the territorial distribution of living subjects included in the ETRC has been performed to show that it is feasible to arrange a special system for obtaining sufficient numbers of tooth samples for EPR analyses. Some studies were also carried out for the purpose of improving the experimental technique (43-45). A comparison (46) of EPR-based indi- vidual results for 13 residents of Metlino with mature teeth at the time of the releases showed excellent agreement with the calculated estimates derived from use of the TRDS- 2000 approach. Also, it has been shown (27) that, for the middle Techa region, EPR doses are comparable with the sum of the background dose plus the dose from incorpo- rated 90Sr (the latter has been calculated using Monte Carlo simulation of electron transport in tooth tissues). This find- ing confirms that the external component of total dose for the middle and lower Techa region was relatively low. In general, these studies have demonstrated the potential of EPR methods for the validation of individual external doses for members of the ETRC. A careful analysis (46) of FISH results (presumed to rep- resent primarily external dose) for 28 permanent residents of Metlino, some of which were reported previously by Bauchinger et al. (47), indicated a FISH-based sample-av- erage value of 0.38 ? 0.10 (mean + standard error of mean) Gy, whereas the estimated sample average from use of the TRDS-2000 was 0.31 + 0.03 Gy. The comparative analysis of the applications of the above three retrospective dosimetry methods (luminescence, EPR and FISH) for the first validation of external doses for the Metlino site indicates that it is feasible to validate TRDS- 2000 external dose estimates in the future. Possibilities of Additional Improvements in Dosimetry (TRDS-2006) The substantial improvements in the TRDS-2000 have led to significant changes in the estimates of dose for mem- bers of the ETRC. Further major improvements in the do- simetry system to support epidemiological studies can be made by: 1. Further study of uncertainty with the goal of reducing uncertainty in the final dose estimates. 2. Study of other sources of dose that could confound the analysis of the epidemiological data for the members of the ETRC. 3. Validation of the dose estimates, particularly of the re- vised estimates of external dose. Work will continue to focus on analysis of uncertainty, and how these results can be used to direct work on the major sources of uncertainty that can be reduced. The anal- ysis of uncertainty has not yet been formalized into the TRDS-2000 through the creation of a Monte Carlo version of the entire TRDS code. This is a major task that is of high priority. It is evident that there are two relatively large sources of uncertainty that can be reduced. One is the as-</page><page sequence="14">268 DEGTEVA ET AL. sociation of a particular individual with the location of the house within which he/she lived. This is an important var- iable affecting external dose. At present a household- weighted distance of homes from the river in each village is being assumed with attendant large uncertainty in the estimated dose. Another major source of uncertainty relates to the source of drinking water (water taken from the river or from wells). Based on data on direct measurements of body burdens, it seems clear that this source of uncertainty might be reduced in a variety of ways. The preferred way would be to use the measured body burdens directly as individual input data. This is not being done at present be- cause about half of the members of the original cohort do not have such measurements. However, it is possible to associate family members into households wherein one or more other persons did have such measurements. The as- sumption could then be made that all members of the household had the same source of drinking water. Another helpful aspect will the continuation of counting of addi- tional members of the cohort with the SICH-9.1 whole- body counter. In terms of confounding sources of dose to the members of the ETRC, there are three known sources. One is the East Urals Radioactive Trace (EURT), or the Kyshtym ex- plosion in 1957. This source of radioactive material is known to have affected a few thousand members of the ETRC who had been relocated away from the Techa River and into the path of the future EURT. The ability to cal- culate doses from the EURT for this subset of the ETRC already exists in the TRDS-2000 code. However, there has not been an evaluation of the existing data to support the necessary input parameters on time- and location-depen- dent intake rates of radionuclides and on external -y-ray exposure rates. Another potentially major source of confounding expo- sure is the gaseous releases through the radiochemical plant stacks at the MPA. Large releases of 1J3I and other radio- nuclides are known to have occurred (48). And finally and as discussed above, there is reason to believe that the mem- bers of the ETRC who were more heavily exposed were examined medically rather frequently. Such examinations included a full battery of radiological diagnostic examina- tions. Validation of the internal doses calculated with use of the TRDS-2000 continues. One recent success has been the rederivation of the 90Sr intake function by a method that is more rigorous and that produces continuous, rather than point, estimates (49). Work also continues to formalize completely an age- and gender-dependent biokinetic model for strontium developed specifically for the Techa River population-the Techa Biokinetic Model (50). Finally, the validation of the new estimates of external dose is considered to be a critical factor in the continuing credibility of the TRDS-2000 results and the companion epidemiological studies they support. Recent successes in the measurement of doses by luminescence of natural ma- terials, by EPR of tooth enamel, and by FISH of circulating lymphocytes have demonstrated that these measurements can be applied to the Techa River situation. However, the measurements can be difficult and must be supported by extensive modeling to help in the interpretation of the mea- sured results. For example, the time-dependent, complicat- ed source geometries must be modeled to interpret the re- sults of luminescence measurements. The EPR measure- ments are also complicated by the fact that the measure- ments of external dose are affected by the presence of 90Sr in dental tissues. Thus an EPR measurement by itself is not sufficient as a validating measurement without some ac- companying knowledge of the contribution of 90Sr and per- haps other radionuclides. Fortunately, there have been re- cent advances in the understanding of the tooth as a com- plex dosimeter (51-53). The FISH-based measurements can be complicated to an unknown extent by the presence of 90Sr in bone tissue, and the interpretation of FISH mea- surements must rely on adequate calibration curves that are convincingly suitable for complex exposure situations. CONCLUSIONS Substantial improvements have been made in the Techa River Dosimetry System (TRDS-2000). These improve- ments have brought substantial changes in the estimates of dose for the members of the ETRC. Limited data on validation generally support the new es- timates, but validation work is considered as an important, continuing task. The first preliminary results of the analysis of uncertainty in the TRDS doses have provided valuable insight into how work can be directed to reduce uncertainty in dose esti- mates. The further study of uncertainty, effective imple- mentation of a Monte Carlo version of the TRDS-2000 code, and work on reducing uncertainty are important as- pects of future plans. There are confounding sources of dose for some mem- bers of the ETRC, such as the EURT, the gaseous emissions from the MPA, and a potential bias in medical exposure toward those more highly exposed on the Techa River. Bet- ter means of estimating these confounding sources of dose will be part of future investigations of this cohort.
