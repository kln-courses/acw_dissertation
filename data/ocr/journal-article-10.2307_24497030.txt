Perhaps that is why we, like the Victorians, often overlook the later stages of animal lives until animals enter our homes as pets. As I have discussed in an earlier article, "Dog Years, Human Fears," the rise of pet culture in the nineteenth century inspired a host of poems lamenting the impending deaths of pets, along with cemeteries to honour their passing. Both signalled new attention to the odd in-between status of creatures that had breached the traditional human/non-human divide. Converging interests in time scales, life spans, and forms of life may also have sparked Victorian interest in the age of animals in ways that still go largely unnoticed. As the work of historians such as Harriet Ritvo demonstrates, Victorian fascination with animals took strikingly diverse and often contradictory forms at both the macro and micro levels as scientists challenged the Biblical account of creation and the nature of human historical time. Evolutionary theories argued for the animality of humans, which shocked readers by pointing out resemblances across species, while also precisely describing the minute differences of sub-species from one another. Evolution also focused attention on the ways the environment operated on living beings through time. The careful observations of natural historians like Darwin alongside the discoveries of extinct animal fossils suggested that evolution ary change could result from slow adaptations over millennia, but also that catastrophic natural forces might have an immediate, dramatic impact on the life spans of individuals, species, or populations. Theodore Goldsmith argues that before Darwin's work, scientists viewed longevity as a salient characteristic in the description of animals (29-36). Later in the century, biologists such as August Weismann (whose work was popularized in Britain by George Romanes) hypothesized that long life was a negative condition that threatened the vitality of species (see 22-29). In an '881 lecture that was quickly translated into English, Weismann went so far as to argue for 24</page><page sequence="2">forum: Victorian Humanity what biologists now call "programmed death" (22-29) as insurance against the ill effects of reproduction in late life, though he later rejected that theory. Presumably, few people would have encountered truly elderly animals beyond the domestic sphere. While a few zoo animals became long-lived fix tures in London and other European capitals, they were well known because they were unique. Those exotic animals that miraculously survived grueling sea voyages from the tropics or the Arctic rarely withstood the climate, new diseases, or strange diets in their new homes long enough to indicate what a full lifespan might be. Even the growth of pet culture, which prompted a longing for long-lived animal companions, was matched by a rise in vivisec tion, a practice that cut animals' lives short. Painful, gruesome, and often lethal operations on dogs and other domestic animals implied that their lives, short or long, were of no importance. Animals were objects, not sentient beings whose lifespans merited concern. Meanwhile, in a parallel development documented by historians of aging (such as Pat Thane and, in her recent study of Victorian attitudes toward age, Karen Chase), age itself emerged as an absorbing field of study. By the second half of the nineteenth century, biologists, medical researchers, demographers, economists, social engineers, and politicians were deeply preoccupied with the nature and impact of long-lived humans. While the focus of age studies has for the most part been on humans, age as a part of biological and cultural identity hardly belongs to one species. In the arts as well as the sciences, anxieties about time and subjectivity frequently meet in representations of the aging animal. These moments of intersection often conflate differences of age, gender, ethnicity, and animality. H. Rider Haggard's She (1887) offers one of the most striking examples. In one particularly horrific scene, the title character, She, a queen whose youth and beauty have been preserved for centuries, re-enters the pillar of fire that had rejuvenated her in centuries past. This time, inexplicably, time exacts a toll. To the horror of fellow travellers, she undergoes a shocking transformation that has long fascinated readers and scholars alike. The narrator tracks the rapid-fire changes as he watches the beautiful woman morph into what looks like a mummy, then a monkey, then an infant in a perverse devolution from the aged animal to the human infant. Here, animality and age register as a bizarre (and highly fictionalized) Darwinian collapse into time (2$j). In less gruesome contexts, both actual and imagined older animals were fashioned into distinctive, individual characters by the conventions of senti mentality. Dogs that outlived their masters and mistresses were particularly revered. Biographers of Sir Walter Scott often mention that one of his last orders was that his dogs be cared for after his death (Massie 481). Nearly every account of Emily Bronte's death recalls that her dog Keeper followed her coffin at the funeral and waited each day outside her bedroom door for the rest of his life. On 8 December 1851, Charlotte Bronte wrote her friend 2?</page><page sequence="3">Victorian review Volume 40 Number 1 Ellen Nussey, "There was something very sad in losing the old dog; yet I am glad he met a natural fate—people kept hinting that he ought to be put away which neither Papa nor I like to think of" (qtd. in Barker 339). Having watched her siblings' lives cut short, Charlotte seems to have been unusually aware of her canine companion's long life. In fiction, old animals do occasionally speak for themselves.The voices of animal narrators are shaped by their imagined lifelong experience, usually of suffering. The most skillfully conceived stand in for both "actual" old animals and long-suffering humans. Anna Sewell's Black Beauty (1877) is merely the most famous of animal narrators in late nineteenth-century fiction whose naive critiques of human behaviour are authorized by inter-connected age and animal identities. Freed of the distinctly human fetters of language, visual artists sometimes capture animality more viscerally than writers do. George Cruikshank fol lowed William Hogarth in protesting cruelty to animals through his art—for example, in The Knacker's Yard, or the Horses last home! published in a Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals journal, The Voice of Humanity, in 1831. In the etching, a man whips the only resisting horse as other men stand by, idly watching. Radiating from the centre are falling and fallen old horses, reduced to skin and bone. A sign above describes both the place and the fate of the old: "Licensed for Slaughtering Horses." Here, age and animality together produce uniquely strong emotions— whether of horror or pity—but such figurations tell us little about either the animals or their embodied or affective experience of aging. However, in some cases, art succeeds in expressing animal age, whether or not that is the artist's intent. Edwin Landseer was one of the most celebrated Victorian painters. Among his many careful studies of the features that mark physical aging in an animal, the 1829 painting variously referred to as The Poor Dog and The Shepherds Grave is especially intriguing.' Here, animal consciousness speaks through a grizzled muzzle, a drooping body, and a stiff, hesitant, and pained stance. Commentators tended to interpret such scenes as unabashed anthropomorphism or to argue that the old dog stands in for bereft human mourners. But how might we resist these humanist interpretations? Even the dual titles of the painting suggest indecision about its subject matter. Is it possible to train our eyes to read such an image as a study of animal age? Photographer Isa Leshko's "Elderly Animals" project is designed to quicken the sympathies of twenty-first-century viewers, but her black-and-white photographs also invite scholars of the nineteenth century to consider when and where we encounter representations of animal age in that era. In her artist's statement, Leshko explains that she is travelling to sanctuaries across the country where animals are allowed to remain until they die: "In order to achieve a sense of intimacy in these portraits, I spend several hours with the animals I photograph and I try to visit them multiple times." In several, dogs stand quietly and stiffly, their ears and muzzles grey, their eyes dimmed with 26</page><page sequence="4">forum: Victorian Humanity cataracts. Many of the photographs focus on farm animals: a sheep blurs into the shadow and the sawdust in which it is lying; ducks and geese squint in a strangely human attempt to focus, their feathers thinned and heads drooping. All the animals have a queer, uncanny eloquence. Leshko's unflinching images are a stark reminder of our complicated responses both to old age and to the fate of nonhuman animals. The series thwarts the viewer's impulse to anthropomorphize. Instead, the photographs evoke the almost alienating beauty, particularity, and mystery of late animal life. Is it possible for scholars to defamiliarize animals and human-animal relations in the past by studying their lingering representations with atten tion to both insights from age studies and animal studies? Perhaps Leshko's lens can help us to see the significance of animal experience rather than to displace the literal protagonist before us with the human we must invent in order not to see Landseer's dog.
