THE INTRODUCTORY REMARKS1 In the preceding chapters on prophecy, Maimonides has explained that it is a natural perfection which comes to a person when he meets certain physical and psychical requirements. These requirements, however, were not satisfied by the prophets in equal measure, and some, consequently, attained to higher modes of prophecy than others. These modes are described by Maimonides in chap. 45, in which he lays down a classification that divides prophecy into eleven grades or degrees. Prior to his discussion of the degrees proper, Maimonides makes three introductory remarks. In the first remark, he states that the purpose of the chapter is to present an enumeration of the various grades of prophecy, "after having explained previously the true meaning of prophecy in accordance with that which speculation requires and with that which is explained in our Law, I must now enumerate for you the grades2 of prophecy on the basis of these two principles." The question immediately suggests itself why Maimonides opens chap. 45 as though presenting a classification of prophecy for the first time, since he has already provided a similar classification in chap. 44. Abrabanel's explanation is that the new classification is the first truly precise one, in which Maimonides makes two significant changes regarding that which appears in chap. 44. He draws a distinction between the degrees of dream and vision prophecy; and the grades of prophecy are presented in an ascending rather than descending order; *Continued from Vol. 37. 1 The manuscript, Bodleian 2385, referred to as A in the notes, which has been used in preparing the previous chapters of this translation, does not contain chap. 45. 2 The manuscript of the Moreh employed by Abrabanel translated the under lying Arabic term, מראתב, by מעלות, instead of by מדרגות, the term that appears in our edition and generally in the Ibn Tibbon translations. (Cf., Munk, Le Guide des Egarés,Egarés, Vol. II, p. 333, n. 1.) Inasmuch as Abrabanel bases a comment on the use of the term מעלות, I have translated the passage in accordance with his version, using the term grades as a translation of מעלות. The term degrees is used to translate סדרנות. (See n. 8, infra.) 159</page><page sequence="2">160 ALVIN J. REINES After Maimonides has clearly stated the quiddity of prophecy in its definition,3 this chapter comes to enumerate and explain its degrees. And owing to the fact that in chap. 44, supra, Mai monides enumerates degrees of prophecy: the one who sees parables and images; the one who hears explicit statements; the one who sees God speaking to him; and the one who hears words but does not see the speaker;4 and he does not make a distinction among those degrees he enumerates in that chapter as to whether5 the prophecy occurs in a dream or a vision, he, therefore, saw fit in this chapter to enumerate and classify the degrees by separating those that take place in a dream from those that take place in a vision, ft is with reference to this that he states here at the beginning of this chapter, "I must now enu merate for you the grades of prophecy on the basis of these two principles"; for he calls those degrees grades because they are arranged in ascending order,6 from the least to the highest of it,7 and he has made a distinction among them between the degrees of the prophetic dream and those of the prophetic vision, which was not the case in chap. 44.* He did not order the degrees נ M or eh Nebhukhim II, 36. * * * However, Abrabanel's account of the list of degrees Maimonides gives in chap. 44 is not accurate. Maimonides' classification there includes five degrees: 1) that of seeing parables; 2) seeing God speak; 3) hearing and seeing an angel speak; 4) seeing a man speak; 5) hearing a voice but seeing no images. In Abrabanel's list, only four degrees appear in all. Of these, three (the first, third, and fourth) correspond to degrees enumerated in chap. 44 (to I, 3, and 5). Also Abrabanel's second degree appears to be the same as his fourth. It may be that the text of the commentary is corrupt here. s Rd. (1. 3) מהיות for מהות. 6 The root of the term מעלות, translated as grades, is עלה, meaning "to go up" or "to ascend." Abrabanel finds support for his explanation, that one of the important reasons behind the new classification of prophecy Maimonides gives in chap. 45 is the arrangement of the degrees in ascending order, in the fact that the term מעלות is used in place of מדרגות in the first sentence of chap. 45. Through the meaning of its root, מעלות hints at an "ascending" order. However, as Munk points out {ibid.), מעלות is simply a variant reading for מדרגות, and the underlying Arabic term, מראתב, does not support Abrabanel's exegesis. This does not, of course, affect the substance of Abrabanel's explanation. The fact is that the degrees appear in descending order in chap. 44 and in ascending order in chap. 45. 7 Apparently the antecedent of 7 .1) ממנה) is 6 .1) הנבואה), prophecy. 8 E. g., in chap. 44, Maimonides' first degree of prophecy is that of seeing God speak in a prophetic vision. But Maimonides explicitly states in chap. 45 (in dis cussing the eleventh degree) that he does not think a prophet can see God speaking in a vision, although such a phantasy is possible in dream prophecy. This indicates Maimonides did not distinguish the degrees carefully in chap. 44. However, see Munk's attempted resolution of the difficulty, ibid., p. 330, n. 1.</page><page sequence="3">[3] ABRABANEL ON PROPHECY IN THE MOREH NEBHUKHIM 161 of prophecy9 from the least to the greatest and highest of it, — by reason of which they are called degrees there and not grades, — and he did not make a differentiation there between the degrees of the dream and the vision as he has done in this chapter. (89V. 1) In his second introductory remark, Maimonides states that the first and second degrees of his classification of prophecy, the degrees of the "spirit of the Lord" and "the holy spirit,"10 are not really prophecy, and that the persons who attain to them are not prophets. Abrabanel explains that Maimonides bases this evaluation on the fact that the men of the Great Synagogue placed the works of those who belong to these two degrees in the Hagiographa and not in the Prophets, indicating that they were of lesser importance. However, since the Sages do refer to these men as prophets at times, Maimonides ex plains that they are occasionally called prophets in loose speech: Maimonides says the first two degrees he enumerates here —■ that of the divine spirit [which inspires a person to perform some great and praiseworthy action,] and that of the new force which arises [within a person that prompts him] to utter wise maxims, praises, or rebukes — are not absolute prophecy, and the persons who belong to them are not accounted among the prophets of Israel. He says this not only to exclude persons belonging to the first degree, but also those belonging to the second degree, such as David, Solomon, and Daniel. Maimonides arrived at this inasmuch as he found that the men of the Great Synagogue placed their books in the Hagiographa and not in the Prophets. Maimonides continues to say furthermore, "If he11 is occasionally called" prophet, it is a kind of generalization, because he is very close to the prophets," in order to answer the objection which can be raised against him that the Sages13 in the tractate Megillah14 enumerated the prophets and counted among them David, Solomon, and Daniel. Thus he (Maimonides) says this (enumeration) was made figuratively, not literally, for had it י Rd. (1. 9) כי לא היה מסדר סדרנות הנבואה for כי לא היה. 10 Abrabanel refers to these two degrees, respectively, as those of the "divine spirit" (הרוח האלהי) and "the new force that arises [within a person]" (כח המתחדש). 11 The one belonging to the first or second degree. 12 Rd. (1. 9) יקרא for יקרה; cf. text of the Moreh Nebhukhim. ני Rd. (1. 20) שחז־ל for שאזיל. 14 The reference apparently is to Megillah 14a. The Sages make the statement that forty-eight prophets and seven prophetesses prophesied to Israel. Although the prophets are not mentioned by name in the text, Rashi (s. v. נבואה שהוצרכה לדורות), quoting the Seder 01am (xx f.), gives a list among which are included David, Solomon, and Daniel.</page><page sequence="4">162 ALVIN J. REINES [4] been made literally they (the Sages) would have placed their books among15 the books of the prophets, (çor. a. 12) In his third introductory remark, Maimonides states that a prophet may prophesy at different degrees on different occasions. Together with this observa tion, he repeats his statement that ordinary prophets must cease to prophesy for some period before their death. In the following comment, the relevance these two remarks have to one another is explained.16 The prophets Maimonides refers to are Samuel and Jeremiah. Samuel wrote the Book of Ruth, which appears in the Hagiographa, and the Book of Samuel, which is included in the Prophets; similarly, Jeremiah wrote the Book of Lamentations, which appears in the Hagiographa, and the Book of Jeremiah, which is included in the Prophets. Maimonides mentions this point because the fact that these men prophesied at different degrees at different times poses a serious problem for him; if prophetic perfection is a natural habit, as he maintains, then the person who possesses it should always prophesy at the same level, and if he does not, then prophecy does not follow the invariable cause and effect of natural law, and consequently, must be explained as a miracle. The answer to this difficulty is suggested by Maimonides' statement that a person ceases to prophesy for some period before his death. This happens, as has been explained, because prophecy is produced in part by the imagination, which as a corporeal faculty is affected by the weakened state that precedes death. Hence, in like manner the imagination of a prophet may be affected by various life circumstances so that he will naturally produce one degree of prophecy at one time, and lower degrees of prophecy or works of the first two degrees at another time: It is necessary to know "who is he, and where is he,"17 the prophet whom Maimonides found prophesied at one degree one time, and at a second time prophesied at another one of the degrees. I say that Maimonides intended by this (remark) to answer a certain objection that might be raised against him. This is that we find with reference to Samuel, the prophet, that he wrote the Book of Samuel, which is included in the Prophets, and that he also wrote the Megillah of Ruth, which was placed among the Hagiographa, because it was not uttered in absolute prophecy; and similarly, that Jeremiah wrote the Books of Kings and of his prophecies18 which were absolute prophecy and placed among the prophetic books, and that he also wrote the Megillah of Lamentations, which was placed among the Hagiographa and not the Prophets. To this, Maimonides answers that it con stitutes no refutation that each one of these prophets prophesied 15 Rd. (1. 22) בתוך for בתיק. 16 Abrabanel's comment is stated in somewhat cryptic fashion. This is my interpretation. 17 A quotation from Esther 7:5. 18 I. e., the Book of Jeremiah.</page><page sequence="5">[5] ABRABANEL ON PROPHECY IN THE MOREH NEBHUKHIM 163 one time at a superior degree, when they wrote those books (of prophecy), and, at another time did not prophesy at the same superior degree as when they wrote those (books of) prophecy, but at a lower degree, that of the holy spirit, — which is the second degree he enumerates here, — and composed those megilloth. Thus they (the megilloth) were placed not with the Prophets but the Hagiographa, since they were uttered through the holy spirit and not through prophecy. This is what" is re quired by this language and these statements in this place, inasmuch as Maimonides has already written above in chap. 36, Part II, that prophecy necessarily ceased from the prophets for some time before their death.20 For he presents it there to explain that prophecy occurs by means of the imaginative faculty, whereas he presents it here to resolve this objection I have mentioned that arises concerning the degrees of prophecy. (90r. b. 2) B. THE FIRST DEGREE The first degree of Maimonides' classification of prophecy consists in divine assistance that motivates and encourages a person to perform a great and noble deed. In his introductory remarks, Maimonides has stated that neither this first degree, nor the second, in which a person feels some new force that inspires him to speak or write on philosophic and religious subjects, are actually prophecy. Commenting on the first degree, Abrabanel again takes up the question why these degrees, if they are not in fact prophecy, are included in Maimonides' classification of prophecy. This problem was raised earlier by Abrabanel in his comments to the second introductory remark. His answer there was that Maimonides included the first and second degrees because the Sages had loosely referred to the persons belonging to these two degrees as prophets. However, this answer provides only an external reason for including the two degrees. The question Abrabanel now raises is whether there is an intrinsic reason as well, one that flows from the nature of prophecy as Mai monides conceives it. This reason cannot be that the first two degrees describe actions performed through divine help, since there are other such actions, and they are not listed among the degrees of prophecy. Neither can we say they are listed because they are propaedeutics for prophecy, inasmuch as Maimonides has not listed other accomplishments he lays down as necessary for prophecy. Abrabanel's answer is the following.21 Maimonides writes in chap. 38, supra. " I. e., the interpretation that is required. 20 I. e., Maimonides would not repeat his remark here unless he intended making some new point. 21 Abrabanel's answer is not completely certain owing to difficulties in the text. This is my interpretation.</page><page sequence="6">164 ALVIN J. REINES [6] that the prophets commonly22 possessed unusually powerful courage and in tuitive faculties, implying that these two faculties participate in producing prophecy. However, neither of these faculties is mentioned in the definition of prophecy he lays down in chap. 36, supra. The only faculties included there are the imagination and the intellect. Consequently, the problem arises that Maimonides contradicts himself in chapters 36 and 38, the former, by omission, suggesting that the courage and intuitive faculties play no role in prophecy, and the latter implying that they do. The contradiction, however, is only apparent. The reason is that the actions of the courage and intuitive faculties to a degree overlap and intrinsically resemble one another. The courage faculty, whose primary characteristic is bravery, produces actions similar to certain actions of the imagination, while the intuition, whose primary characteristics are quickness of thought and elegance of style, produces some works similar to those of the intellect.23 Thus there is no contradiction between chapters 36 and 38 ; it is simply that owing to the intrinsic similarity between these faculties, Maimonides did not find it necessary in his definition to include specifically the courage and intuitive faculties after having mentioned the imagination and the intellect. The prophetic action of the former is included in the latter. The great partial similarity between these faculties also explains why Mai monides includes the first two degrees in his classification of prophecy although they are not prophecy at all. The first degree represents the actions of the courage faculty, whose primary characteristic is bravery, and embraces there fore those who perform mighty and valorous deeds; the second degree represents the actions of the intuition, whose primary characteristics are quickness of thought and elegance of style, and embraces those who speak and write in refined and beautiful speech. Since the faculties and acts that produce and constitute these two degrees resemble intrinsically those of prophecy, Mai monides accounts them a kind of gwasf-prophecy, and includes them quite properly in his classification: I ask why Maimonides puts these first two degrees among the degrees of prophecy if they are not absolute prophecy, and if, by his own words, the one who belongs24 to them is not worthy of being called a prophet? Even though they are virtues acquired through divine assistance, it is not proper that they be called 22 Actually, Maimonides might be understood to say that all the prophets pos sessed highly developed courage and intuitive faculties. However, Abrabanel main tains a powerful intuition is not necessary for prophecy. (See infra, pp. 12 ff.) There fore, in line with Abrabanel's interpretation I have added the qualifying word "commonly," i. e., not all the prophets. 23 The action of the intuition according to Abrabanel is primarily formal and mechanical; the content of knowledge is produced by the intellect. For this reason, prophets, who must have highly realized intellects, need not also have perfect intuitions. Without perfect intuitions their language may be less elegant and their thought processes slower, but the content of their knowledge is not affected. 2י• Rd. (1. 1) שימצא for שימצאו.</page><page sequence="7">[7] ABRABANEL ON PROPHECY IN THE MOREH NEBHUKHIM 165 prophecy, inasmuch as the habit of scientific knowledge, which is obtained through the effluence of the incorporeal being, and all other praiseworthy qualities, come through divine assistance, "For the Lord giveth wisdom, Out of His mouth cometh knowl edge and discernment" (Prov. 2:6), and despite this they are not accounted among the degrees of prophecy. For that which is not prophecy cannot possibly be made into one of its degrees. And if we say these two degrees are preparations for prophecy and lead to it, it is still not proper on this account that they should be degrees of prophecy, for Maimonides did not make into prophetic degrees even the preparations he mentions as necessary for the prophet and prophecy. I say in answer to this that Maimonides wrote in chapter 38, supra,supra, that every person possesses a courage and intuitive faculty, that people differ quantitatively with regard to these two facul ties, and that these two faculties were inevitably very25 powerful in the prophets. But prophecy, as described in its definition, "is an effluence that flows forth from God through the medium of the Active Intellect, first upon the rational faculty, and then upon the imaginative faculty." [Since no mention is made in the definition of the courage and intuitive faculties, we may con elude,] therefore, that there is something of the perfection of the rational faculty in the perfection of the intuitive faculty, and something of the perfection of the imaginative faculty in the perfection of the courage faculty, for it is consequent upon the strength and equability of the imagination. Consequently, the per fection of the intuitive faculty is imperfect prophecy, for through it the prophet knows future events, and a powerful courage faculty is also imperfect prophecy, for through it he is moved by the mind to repel anything injurious.26 For this reason Maimonides places these two degrees among the degrees of prophecy, but writes that they do not constitute absolute prophecy, and the one who is adept in them is not a prophet. The first degree cor responds to the courage faculty and for this reason Maimonides *s Rd. (1. 11) מאד for לבד. This last clause reflects Maimonides' statement in chap. 38 ואי אפשר מבלתי היות שתי הכהות האלו בנביאים חזקות מאד. I have translated the clause accordingly, emending לבד to מאד. 16 The text appears to be corrupt from 13 .1) לכן) to 2 .1) ויושרי) in several places. My translation is of the text as emended to the following reading: לכן היה מהשלמות הכה הדברי בהשלמות הכה המשער ומהשלמות הכה המרמה בהשלמות הכה הנבורה כי הוא נמשך מחוזק המדמה ויושרו, הנה א־כ שלמות הכה המשער היא נבואה בלתי שלמה שבו יודע העתידות, וחוזק כה הגבורה הוא נ־כ נבואה בלתי שלמה שבו יתנועע במחשבתו לרחות מה שיזיקהו. (The phrase שבו יתנועע במחשבתו is reconstructed from II, 38 of the Moreh Nebhukhim.)</page><page sequence="8">166 ALVIN J. REINES [8] ascribes27 to it courage. The second corresponds to the intuitive faculty, therefore, he ascribes to it words of praise and rebuke, and political statements. He also mentions scientific discourses and theological speculations among them,28 not from the aspect of knowing them, but expressing them. Such utterance and rhetoric are proof of [the excellence] of the intuition, for its perfection consists also29 in beauty of language and rhetoric. (90r. b. 21) The first degree is further like prophecy in that the divine assistance which characterizes this degree, the spirit of the Lord, may come to help either one person or an entire community, which is also the case with the help given by prophecy. Moreover, just as there are inferior psychic states that resemble prophecy, as, e. g., the true dream, so there are accomplishments that resemble those achieved through the spirit of the Lord, such as the acquisition of personal wealth, but these actually result from an effluence30 that is inferior to it: Moreover, since absolute prophecy comes at times to direct (many) people and perfect them,31 and at other times to direct an important, distinguished individual, which is considered as if it were for the salvation of an assembly of many people, Maimonides says of this degree of the divine spirit that it occurs for the deliverance of an important community, or a superior and important individual, in order to liken this state to prophecy, even if it is not absolute prophecy. And how well Maimonides speaks at the end of this first degree when he says, "For just as not everyone who beholds a true dream is a prophet, so it cannot be said of everyone to whom help attaches itself for some thing, whatever it happens to be, [as, for example, the acquisition of money . . . that the spirit of the Lord has come upon him, or that the Lord was with him]." For just as the simple dream is not prophecy, despite the fact that it is similar to it in (some) characteristics, so with regard to the acquisition of virtues and virtuous actions,32 some of them are to be attributed to divine assistance, for they result from the effluence33 in a general way, and some are not to be 27 Rd.

This efflu ence is a form bestowed by the Active Intellect which produces a highly developed courage faculty. As explained previously, (see especially "Commentary to Chapter Thirty-Six," HUCA, XXXV [1964], pp. 216 ff.,) prophecy is an entirely natural</page><page sequence="9">[9] ABRABANEL ON PROPHECY IN THE MOREH NEBHUKHIM 167 attributed to it, for they result from something inferior like the effluence of the simple dream, (çov. b. 8) C. THE SECOND DEGREE T. FOUR CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SECOND DEGREE Describing the second degree, Maimonides writes, "the second degree is that a person feels as if something has descended upon him and that a certain34 force newly has come into him3* which prompts him to speak, so that he delivers event for Maimonides, and the prophetic effluence consists in the forms and forces bestowed naturally by the Active Intellect upon the prophet that produce in him a perfect intellect and imagination. Thus prophecy is not a supernatural communica tion that interrupts nature, but knowledge produced naturally by the prophet's own faculties. True dream is also produced by the intellect and the imagination, but unlike the case of prophecy, the intellect and imagination that produce true dream are inferior, and consequently, bring forth truth only very occasionally. As is true of prophecy, the acts of the first degree are also natural occurrences. They do not come from special divine intervention into the natural process, but from nature itself. The "spirit of the Lord" is nothing other than the effluence from the Active Intellect that is the form which informs matter to produce a highly developed courage faculty that functions most perfectly at a moment when conditions for the faculty are optimum. This form is bestowed naturally and regularly by the Active Intellect, the celestial Intelligence that is primarily responsible for the regularities of nature. Even though the actions produced by a perfect courage faculty are only natural, they are nevertheless remarkable, and are not to be confused with the actions pro duced by a lesser and inferior courage faculty, as true dream is not to be confused with prophecy. Only great, altruistic acts deserve to be included in the first degree, and these alone are properly described as coming from "the spirit of the Lord," the highly developed courage faculty functioning perfectly. Examples of this degree given by Maimonides include Moses' slaying of the Egyptian (Exod. 2:11-17), and David's conquest of the lion, the bear, and the Philistine (I Sam. 16:13; 17:34 ff.). 3* The printed edition of Ibn Tibbon has וכח אחד התחדש, "a certain force newly has come"; whereas the Arabic reads וקוה אחרי טרח עליה, "another force has come over him." There is no significant difference in meaning necessarily between the two. However, S. Pines, in his translation, (The Guide of the Perplexed, [Chicago, 1963], p. 398, n. 240) which is based on the Arabic text, takes the phrase "another force" to mean "a force different from the one discussed by Maimonides when speaking of the first degree of prophecy." This interpretation is questionable. Inasmuch as the context, phrasing, and description of the second degree clearly make the point that the force of the second degree is a different one from that of the first degree, there is no need for Maimonides to repeat the point in so obscure a fashion. Rather, it would seem, the interpretation of "another force" is that the force is other than or in addi tion to the forces the person normally possesses. This is Abrabanel's interpretation, and apparently the interpretation of Munk (op. cit., II, 337,) "qu'il il lui est survenu une force nouvelle"; so, also, Friedlânder, (op. cit., II, 208,) "as if he had received a new power that encourages him to speak." 3s The Hebrew text reads התחדש whereas the Arabic has טרת עליה. Abrabanel's</page><page sequence="10">168 AL VIN J. REINES [10] words of wisdom, or doxologies, or beneficial admonitions, or political or theo logical discourses, all this while conscious and the senses function in their usual manner. Such is the one of whom it is said that he speaks through the holy spirit. It was through this kind of holy spirit that David composed the Psalms, and Solomon composed Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs. Similarly, Daniel, Job, Chronicles and the other Hagiographa were composed through this kind of holy spirit and, therefore, they are called Kethuvim, i. e., they were ■written■written through the holy spirit. The Sages say expressly, 'The scroll of Esther was dictated through the holy spirit.'36 It is with reference to this kind of holy spirit that David said, 'The spirit of the Lord spoke by me, And His word was upon my tongue' (II Sam. 23:2), i. e., it prompted him to utter these words. Also belonging to this class were the seventy elders, of whom it is said, 'and it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, but they did so no more' (Num. 11:25); and&gt; similarly, Eldad and Medad. Similarly, every high priest who was queried through the Urim and Thummim belonged to this class, i. e., as the Sages remarked, 'The Shekhinah rests upon him and he speaks through the holy spirit.' "" In the following series of comments, Abrabanel elucidates four characteristics of the second degree as they appear in this passage. The first is that the second degree is unnecessary for prophecy, and there were prophets who did not attain its perfection. In this regard, the second differs from the first degree, which is a a necessary condition of prophecy, and whose perfection, therefore, was possessed by all the prophets. The first characteristic is developed in a comment based on the difference between the ways in which Maimonides opens his discussion of the first and second degrees. The passage describing the first degree begins with the words המדרגה א תחלת מדרגות. This phrase is translated by Abrabanel as "The first degree is the beginning of the degrees (of prophecy)."38 By the term beginning,beginning, Abrabanel understands Maimonides to mean that the first degree is the first part or initial stage of prophecy. As the beginning part of prophecy, the first degree is thus a necessary condition of prophecy, and every prophet, therefore, was qualified to belong to it. Inasmuch as qualification for the first degree is nothing other than possession of a superior courage faculty, every prophet, according to Maimonides, was necessarily possessed of a heroic capacity for courage. Maimonides does not say of the second degree, the other pre prophetic degree, which represents the actions of a superior intuition, that it, too, is "the beginning of the degrees of prophecy." Accordingly, the question arises why Maimonides ascribes the beginning of prophecy only to the acts of rendition of the Hebrew text has "91) "התחדש בוr. a. 23) in accordance with the Arabic. I have, therefore, followed Abrabanel's reading and translated התחדש בו. 36 Bab. Talmud, Megillah 7a. 37 Bab. Talmud, Yoma 73b. 38 The usual translation of המדרגה א תחלת מדרגות הנבואה takes המדרגה א as the title, and תחלת מדרגות הנבואות as the beginning words of the first sentence. So Munk, op.op. cit., "I. PREMIER DEGRÉ: Le premier pas vers la prophétie. . . ." However, the phrase can be translated as Abrabanel has done, and his translation is also consistent with the underlying Arabic which reads אלמרתבה אלאולי אול סראתב אלנבוה.</page><page sequence="11">[11] ABRABANEL ON PROPHECY IN THE MOREH NEBHUKHIM 169 the first degree. Certainly, there is no justification from Scripture for making the first degree a necessary and universal condition of prophecy since there are several prophets in connection with whom no acts of courage are mentioned. The answer, says Abrabanel, is that Maimonides believed that the courage of the first degree was a necessary condition of prophecy whereas the intuition of the second degree was not. Every prophet possesses the capacity to be a hero, only a few enjoy the intuitive qualities of elocution and rhetoric. The fact that Scripture does not mention the courage of every prophet is not to be under stood as implying that there are prophets who were not courageous. Scripture refers specifically only to the courage of those prophets in whose lives courage played an integral role, which was the case with those whose missions required them to chastise the Israelites; the courage of the other prophets, even though equal in capacity to the former, is not mentioned. It was necessary for Mai monides to point out expressly that the courage faculty alone is "the beginning of the degrees" to forestall two possible erroneous opinions. One is that prophecy comes supernaturally or miraculously from God rather than naturally through man's own faculties. The reasoning behind this error would be: Since Maimonides does not say that the superior courage faculty of the first degree is alone a necessary condition for the natural occurrence of prophecy, we must assume that the other pre-prophetic degree, the superior intuition of the second degree, is also a necessary condition of its natural occurrence; hence seeing that Maimonides offers no proof from Scripture that the prophets were perfect as regards the intuition, we can conclude that prophecy appears to those who do not possess perfect intuitions, and who do not, therefore, meet the conditions necessary for the natural occurrence of prophecy, and that consequently, prophecy must have come miraculously through the direct agency of God. The other of the erroneous opinions would agree that prophecy comes naturally, but maintain that the perfection of both the courage and intuitive faculties is necessary for prophecy. The reasoning here is that inasmuch as courage and intuitive excellence are both pre-prophetic perfections and inferior to the degrees of actual prophecy, it could be inferred that the two were equally neces sary conditions of prophecy, and that the prophets who possessed qualities superior to those of the first two degrees certainly had to possess first of all the qualities of the inferior degrees.39 To avoid these erroneous conclusions, Mai monides says of the first degree alone that it is "the beginning of the degrees of prophecy" ; the second degree provides stylistic elegance, but nothing necessary to the mission or message of the prophet: It is necessary to investigate why Maimonides says of the first degree that it is "the beginning of the degrees of prophecy," but does not say so regarding the second degree. For it is not necessary to say that the first degree is perforce prior to all the prophetic degrees, inasmuch as we find several of the prophets ג» Abrabanel is rather brief in this comment, and I have supplemented this explanation of the text by my interpretations.</page><page sequence="12">170 ALVIN J. REINES [12] whom the spirit of God40 never invested with the power to perform some chosen deed. But the reason is that when Mai monides brings up the subject of the courage and intuitive faculties in the same chap. 38 that I have mentioned, he brings many proofs of the courage of the prophets when they delivered chastisements, from Moses, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, — for inas much as they were chastising Israel, God would command them exceedingly not to be afraid to speak to them,41 — but he brings no proof at all from Scriptures of the perfection of the intuitive faculty being present in them. Thus it might perhaps be main tained that God gives knowledge42 to the prophet and that it does not come from the intuitive faculty. On the other hand, it can also be maintained that the two are equally necessary. Therefore, since the courage faculty is a necessary condition of prophecy and the intuitive faculty is not,43 — especially beautiful language and the quality of clear speech, which are not found in all the prophets; like Jeremiah, some of them were defective in their speech, as Jeremiah says, "I cannot speak" (Jer. 1:6), — Maimonides says of the first degree that it is "the beginning of the degrees of prophecy," since it is impossible that there should be prophets found without it,44 and we may say that every prophet is a hero. But not so the second degree, for few of the prophets were worthy of it, and it was not necessary for them. (9Ir• a. 5) The second characteristic is that the "holy spirit" or intuitive force of the second degree appears at some point in a person's life history. It is not a disposi tion he possesses from the beginning of his life. Phenomenologically, it seems as if "something new" arises within that inspires him to rhetorical and literary 40 I. e., the spirit of the Lord, the form of a superior courage faculty bestowed by the Active Intellect. 41 I. e., the Israelites. The literal meaning of the text gives the opposite sense of what is intended. The fact that God found it necessary to command these prophets not to be afraid would seem to indicate they were afraid. However, the proper inter pretation of "God would command them exceedingly not to be afraid" is: In a uni verse whose natural procedures have God as their ultimate cause, the Active Intel lect, following natural law, caused a perfectly functioning courage faculty to appear in these prophets. The command of God is not a communication of words, but a natural act of His universe. Cf. Moreh Nebhukhim, II, 13. 42 I. e., prophetic knowledge in a direct and miraculous way. As the first cause of the universe, God may be said to give all knowledge to man, natural or otherwise. Cf. Moreh Nebhukhim, II, 13. « Rd. (11. 15 f.) לכן כי כה הגבורה היה תנאי הכרחי ולא הכה המשער for כי הגבורה היה תנאי הכרחי ולא מכה המשער. 44 I. e., without a superior courage faculty.</page><page sequence="13">[13] ABRABANEL ON PROPHECY IN THE MOREH NEBHUKHIM 171 efforts beyond the range of his usual ability. Moreover, the force appears sud denly and only on rare occasions. This same sporadic and discontinuous quality is true also of the first degree. The "spirit of the Lord" or power of heroic courage appears only for a particular act and then departs. Even Moses did not always possess the power of the first degree. It came to him when he arrived at maturity, but it then remained for the duration of his life: Note the words of Maimonides concerning this second degree, he does not say the second degree is that a person utters words of wisdom or doxologies, but that "the person feels as if something has descended upon him, and that a certain force has arisen within him which prompts him to speak" words of wisdom. He says this because a person who is already naturally clear of speech with "a mouth that speaks great things"45 in the speculative or practical sciences, who has this (ability) constantly both through the force of his training as well as by having naturally a tongue that speaks great things, does not possess the holy spirit and is not included in this degree. But when a person feels within himself that it is something new, as if from outside, which arises in him, for he has not attempted to go into these (matters),46 then, because of his feeling this new thing itself which prompts him to speak concerning that which was neither customary for him nor part of his training, it is said that the holy spirit rests upon him.47 In this same way, Maimonides writes of the first degree that the "divine assistance" attaches itself to an individual for some 45 An allusion to Dan. 7:20. 46 I. e., into the composition or delivery of works on science, theology, etc. 47 It should be noted that Abrabanel does not mean by this remark that the one who belongs to the second degree produces his works supernaturally, i. e., suddenly, without having studied and prepared himself. Rather, Abrabanel interprets Mai monides here as describing the burst of creative originality that earmarks the genius. The genius is someone who has not been trained for his accomplishment, in the sense that he reaches heights never before attained by man. Neither is such accomplishment part of his normal ability, for he attains these heights only at intervals in his life, or perhaps even just once. The natural explanation of such genius resides in the per fection of the intuitive faculty. However, even if this faculty exists in a perfect state, it does not function at optimum perfection always, for that is dependent upon the vicissitudes of the person's physical and mental condition. But when the moment comes at which the person's entire being is in such a state that the faculty can realize its utmost possibilities, then new literary and rhetorical heights are achieved. This sudden perfection is the "something new" the person experiences. Similarly, those who belong to the first degree perform their acts of heroism when the courage faculty functions at an optimum level, and if the time and place require such courage.</page><page sequence="14">172 ALVIN J. REINES [14] particular act.48 The state (described in) that degree is not that of the heroic individual who prevails over armies by reason of his (normal) strength, but (who prevails) when that state newly comes upon him. Therefore, it was necessary to say that that spirit "did not separate from Moses from the time he came to man's estate." Also, he says, "Likewise a similar force attached itself to David after he was anointed with the oil of anointing," i. e., he did not always, by virtue of his nature, possess this (force), (çir. a. 21) The third characteristic is that the activity of the second degree takes place during consciousness. This further distinguishes the works of the second degree from prophecy, which is produced and spoken in a non-conscious state: In order to differentiate this second one from the degrees of prophecy, Maimonides says, "all this while conscious" and the senses functioning, whereas prophecy takes place when the prophet is in a deep sleep with his face toward the ground.49 Maimonides does not speak of this also in the first degree because its essence is to perform deeds in actuality and reality, and it is evident that this cannot possibly be done except during con sciousness. But since we would not think that speech, too, takes place in prophecy when the senses are at rest, it is necessary for him to say this degree takes place when the senses are functioning.50 48 Literally ■.for that act in particularity. 49 A phrase meaning a trance, adapted from Dan. 8:18, "I fell into a deep sleep with my face toward the ground." 50 Abrabanel's point appears to be the following: Maimonides does not say that the activity of the first degree occurs during consciousness since it is self-evident that these heroic acts actually occurred. However, it was necessary to point out that the activity of the second degree, which is the composition and communication of scientific and literary works, takes place during consciousness to make it clear that the composition and communication of prophecy takes place in a trance. It is evident that, according to Maimonides' theory of prophecy, the content of prophecy is produced in a trance, but it would not be thought that the composition and com munication of prophecy also takes place in a non-conscious state. That the latter is the case is shown by the fact that Maimonides explicitly states that the activity of the second degree takes place during consciousness. For if prophecy were composed and communicated during consciousness, it would not be necessary to say this specifically of the second degree inasmuch as the creative activity that takes place in an inspired state of non-consciousness is superior to the activity of consciousness, and if prophecy, which is superior to the second degree, is composed and delivered during consciousness, then certainly such is the case as regards the second degree. Therefore, by stating explicitly that the action of the second degree occurs during consciousness, Maimonides informs us that prophecy is entirely a non-conscious activity, both as regards substance and delivery.</page><page sequence="15">[15] ABRABANEL ON PROPHECY IN THE MOREH NEBHUKHIM 173 Maimonides says "words of wisdom" with reference to Solomon, "or doxologies" with reference to David; "or beneficial admonitions" with reference to Lamentations, which consists of rebukes, and also the (the Book of) Ezra. And he says "or political (discourses)" with reference to Chronicles, and "or theological discourses" with reference to Daniel and Job. (9!r. b. 5) The fourth characteristic, one alluded to earlier, is that the perfection of the second degree relates to rhetoric and form, the style and delivery of a work, rather than to the scientific or knowledge content it contains. This is the mean ing of Maimonides' statements that the person who belongs to the second degree "speaks through the holy spirit," and that the works in Scripture produced by the members of the second degree "are called Kethuvim ('written')." The content of these works is not exceptional, but they are "spoken" or "written" with great skill: Maimonides writes, "Such is the one of whom it is said that he speaks through the holy spirit" to make clear that the degree does not concern knowledge of those matters, but the manner of imparting and communicating them rhetorically in beautiful and clear words. Therefore, he says, "It was through this kind of holy spirit [that David composed the Psalms . . .]" and for this reason that they are called "Kethuvim" (written), despite the fact that the Prophets were also written down as a book and can be (called) "written" words. But they51 were written through the holy spirit and their writing was divine only from that point of view. And because the statement David makes, "the spirit of the Lord spoke by me, And His word was upon my tongue" (II Sam. 23:2), appears to contradict this, since it would appear from this that God spoke to him, which is absolute prophecy,52 it was necessary consequently for Maimonides to explain re garding it53 that what was meant by it is not that he prophesied, but that God motivated him and brought him to speak in those words. Maimonides also mentions that "belonging to this class" of the holy spirit "were the seventy elders, of whom it is said, 5' I. e., the Kethuvim or Hagiographa. 52 By "God spoke to him" being absolute prophecy, Abrabanel does not mean that God literally spoke since God never speaks or otherwise directly relates to man in Maimonides' view, not even in absolute prophecy. The sense of "God spoke to him" is that from this verse the content of David's writing might be taken as coming from an exceptional effluence, which would be prophecy. Cf. the M or eh II, 48. 53 I. e., David's statement.</page><page sequence="16">174 AL VIN J. REINES [16] '(when the spirit rested upon them,) they prophesied, but they did so no more' " (Num. 11:25), &gt;• e-&gt; they were chastising (the people of) Israel for their complaints. Similarly, the meaning of "Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp," {ibid. 27) is that they were delivering chastisements. For the term prophecy is applied to chastisement and admonition when such occurs by means of the holy spirit. "Similarly, every high priest who was queried through the Urim and Thummim belonged to this class": for he would answer the inquiries by reason of the holy spirit within him. As the Sages said, "the Shekhinah rests upon him and he speaks through the holy spirit." Similarly, the rest he (Maimonides) mentions belonged to this class inasmuch as the holy spirit is ascribed to them with regard to speech they em ployed. (91r. b. 14) II.II. THE STATUS OF BALAAM, DAVID, SOLOMON, AND DANIEL In his final comments on the second degree, Abrabanel discusses the following passage in the Moreh, "You must understand that Balaam, when he was pious, also belonged to this class. This is the meaning indicated by the statement, 'And the Lord put a word in Balaam's mouth' (Num. 23:5); it is as though saying, 'he speaks through the spirit of God'; and it is in this sense that he says of himself, 'him who heareth the words of God' {ibid. 24:4). A point54 to which we must call attention is that David, Solomon, and Daniel belong to this class, and not to the class of Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Nathan the prophet, Ahijah the Shilonite, and their equals. For these, i. e., David, Solomon, and Daniel, only spoke and uttered what they did through the holy spirit. As for David's statement, 'The God of Israel said, The Rock of Israel spoke to me' (II Sam. 23:3), its meaning is that He gave him a promise of good55 through a prophet, either through Nathan or someone else. . . . Similarly, the verse regarding Solomon, 'In Gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night, and God said" (I Kings 3:5), is not absolute prophecy. It is not like, 'the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying' (Gen. 15:1), nor like, "And God spoke unto Israel in the visions of the night' {ibid. 46:2), nor like the prophecies of Isaiah and Jeremiah, for although prophecy came to each of them56 in a dream, that same prophecy would inform him that it was prophecy, and that prophecy had to come to him. But in this story of Solomon it says at the conclusion, 'And Solomon awoke, and behold, it was a dream' 54 Literally: and of that to which we must call attention, וממה שצריך שנעורר עליו. 55 Ibn Tibbon has יעדו טוב translating the Arabic ועדה .ועדה may be translated either as "promised him good" or simply "promised him." Munk and Pines take it as "promised him," Friedlander translates with Ibn Tibbon "promised him happi ness." 56 I. e., Abraham and Israel.</page><page sequence="17">[17] ABRABANEL ON PROPHECY IN THE MOREH NEBHUKHIM 175 (I Kings 3:15). . . . Similarly, you find Daniel states absolutely that they are dreams; even though he saw an angel in them and heard his speech he calls them dreams, and even after he has received his knowledge through them. Thus it says, 'Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a vision of the night' (Dan. 2:19).57 Further it says, 'then he wrote the dream ... I saw in my vision by night,' etc. (ibid. 7:1 f.) ; 'and the visions of my head affrighted me' (ibid.(ibid. 15).58 Then it says, 'and I was appalled at the vision, but understood it not' (ibid. 8:27).59 There is no doubt that this degree is below the degree of those concerning whom it is said, 'I do speak with him in a dream' (Num. 12:6)." Abrabanel explains first Maimonides' position on Balaam, who has been placed in the second degree. Balaam, as reported in Scripture, ended his life as a sorcerer. However, Maimonides does not place him in the second degree on the basis of his sorcerous powers. When Balaam was associated with Balak and blessed the Israelites he was no sorcerer, on the contrary, he was pious, and it was then that he possessed the power of the holy spirit. Only later did he apostatize to sorcery. Also, Maimonides disagrees with the Sages over the status of Balaam. The Sages maintain Balaam was a great prophet whereas Maimonides assigns him to the second degree. Those who belong to the second degree and experience the holy spirit are not prophets; they possess only a superior intuition, which consists mainly in the capacity for rhetoric and delivery. The effluence that flowed upon Balaam, as Scripture says, came upon his "mouth and tongue," organs of communication, whereas in prophecy the effluence flows upon the faculties that produce the content of knowledge, reason and the imagination:60 Maimonides says this similarly was Balaam's status "when he was pious." Maimonides' opinion is that although Balaam was a sorcerer, as it is written, "Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did (the children of Israel) slay with the sword" (Josh. 13:22), it was not from this standpoint that he belonged to this class, for sorcery is not included in this degree.61 Rather Maimonides believes that when Balaam went to Balak he was 57 Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, had a dream he wished interpreted. The interpretation is "the secret revealed unto Daniel," and the kind of knowledge Daniel received in "visions of the night." 58 According to Maimonides, prophetic visions come by day so that a "vision of the night" is not prophetic, see the eighth degree, infra, and II, 41. As for the prophecy in Gen. 46:2 ff., mentioned above, "And God spoke unto Israel in the visions of the night, etc.," the prophecy should be understood as actually having come by day but appearing in the phantasy of the vision to have come by night. 5959 Prophecy, substantially produced as it is by the intellect, would not be un intelligible in this manner. 60 Cf. M or eh 11, 36; also, chap, iv, supra. 61 Friedlander (op. cit., II, 209, n. 1) is apparently unaware of Balaam having died a sorcerer, and consequently finds it difficult to understand which period of Balaam's life Maimonides excludes.</page><page sequence="18">176 ALVIN J. REINES [18] pious, and (later) changed into a different individual; at that (earlier) time he belonged to this class, for he blessed Israel. He then belonged to this class and degree, he did not reach the degree of prophecy, therefore, it is said, "And the Lord put a word in Balaam's mouth" (Num. 23:5), because the effluence did not come upon his rational faculty or his imagination, but upon his mouth and tongue. According to this, Maimonides does not agree with the Sages' statement concerning Balaam,62 "There has never again arisen a prophet in Israel like Moses, — in Israel he has not arisen, but he has among the nations of the world. And who is it? It is Balaam."63 For Maimonides is of the opinion that he was not a prophet, but spoke only through the holy spirit, which is not prophecy. (91 v. 1) In his second comment, Abrabanel takes up a difficulty that appears in Maimonides' treatment of David, Solomon, and Daniel. Early in his discussion of the second degree, Maimonides points out that the works of these three writers, such as Psalms, Ecclesiastes, and Daniel, were not prophecy and belonged to those of the second degree. After leaving the subject, Maimonides returns again to David, Solomon and Daniel later in the discussion to state specifically that they were not prophets. The question arises whether the second reference is a needless repetition or if Maimonides is making some new point. Abrabanel's answer is the latter. It is possible in Maimonides' theory of prophecy for the same person to produce both prophetic works and works of the second degree. Hence it might be that the written works of David, Solomon, and Daniel belong to those of the second degree but that on other occasions they produced prophecy. This would seem to be the case from certain passages in Scripture. Accordingly, Maimonides found it necessary to bring up David, Solomon, and Daniel twice; once to deny their books were prophecy, and a second time to deny that exclusive of these works, at any other time, they achieved prophecy. So far as his own opinion is concerned, Abrabanel here disagrees with Maimonides; he believes that Solomon and Daniel both attained prophetic status: I ask; if Maimonides has already stated [above] it was through the holy spirit that David composed the Psalms, Solomon com posed his books, and likewise Daniel, what is this point that is now called attention to, to say that they belong to this class and not to the class of the prophets. The answer to this is that Maimonides above states that their books were composed through the holy spirit and not through prophecy, and he proves this from the fact that they were included in the Hagiographa and not the Prophets. But it still can be maintained that, despite the ' Rd. (1. 8) על בלעם for נ6 .על Sifre, Deut. 34•</page><page sequence="19">[19] ABRABANEL ON PROPHECY IN THE MOREH NEBHUKHIM 177 fact those books were composed through the holy spirit, they, i. e., David, Solomon, and Daniel, attained the rank of prophecy not through the composition of those books, but through the visions they saw and the utterances they heard. One could argue this in the case of David from his statement, "The God of Israel said, The Rock of Israel spoke to me" (II Sam. 23:3); and in the case of Solomon, from the statement Scripture makes that "The Lord appeared to" him in Gibeon and He said to him such and such (I Kings 3:5); and one could argue the matter in the case of Daniel from his visions. The situation would then be like that which appears in the cases of Samuel and Jeremiah, for despite the fact that [Samuel] composed the scroll of Ruth, and Jeremiah, the scroll of Lamentations, through the holy spirit, and those scrolls were placed in the Hagiographa, it is not said because of this that they did not attain to the rank of prophecy by reason of the visions and apprehensions that Scripture testifies they apprehended from God. Hence, because of this, Maimonides was not satisfied with that which he had proved, that the books of Psalms, Proverbs, Song of Songs, Ecclesiastes, and Daniel were composed through the holy spirit. Thus he calls attention (to the matter) again to prove (conclusively) that David, Solomon, and Daniel did not attain prophecy, and he removes the objection that appears against this64 from the verses, as he proceeds to explain. (65Isaac says: Maimonides' words further concerning this degree are clear. I have already explained in my commentary to the Book of Kings, the second chapter,66 that Solomon attained the degree of prophecy, and I answered in truth and sincerity67 the arguments Maimonides frames in contradiction to this. Similarly, I have written in my book 68מעיני הישועה that Daniel attained the rank of prophecy. I have provided extensive dis cussion in those places on this, "A discussion fitly spoken."69 Let it be investigated there, for it is a very noble, correct, and true speculation, and there is no need to repeat the remarks here.) (91v. 11) 64 I. e., against this position that David, Solomon, and Daniel were not prophets. 68 The parentheses appear in L, the printed Hebrew text. 6666 I Kings 2. 6767 Quoted loosely from Josh. 24:14. .מעיין נ', תמר א' 68 e'Literally, "A word fitly spoken" (Prov. 25:11). Abrabanel makes a play on the words דבור and דבר.</page><page sequence="20">178 ALVIN J. REINES [20] D. THE THIRD DEGREE The third degree is described by Maimonides as follows, "The third degree is the beginning of the degrees of those who say, 'And the word of the Lord came to me,' or (use) expressions with a similar sense. It occurs when the prophet sees a parable in a dream under all those conditions which have been previously laid down for true prophecy, and in that same prophetic dream the meaning of that parable, what is intended by it, is explained to him, as, e. g., most of the parables of Zechariah." Three questions are raised concerning the third degree. The first is why Maimonides describes the third degree as the "beginning of the degrees" of absolute prophecy, inasmuch as this is obvious from the fact that the first and second degrees which precede it are not absolute prophecy. And too, why was the third degree selected to be the first of the degrees of absolute prophecy rather than one of the other degrees he enumerates? Abrabanel answers that the reason Maimonides calls the third degree "the beginning of the degrees" is that it is in fact the beginning of every degree of prophecy. No matter at which degree a prophet may prophesy, the beginning of his prophecy will always consist in the parables and imagery Maimonides describes as characteristic of this degree. When the prophet perceives explicit statements they are only interpretations of the images that he has seen. Images are part of every degree because prophecy, according to Maimonides' definition, is produced in part by the imagination, and the product of this faculty is phantasy and imagery. Therefore, inasmuch as the third degree describes the pervasive and necessary initial element of every degree of prophecy, Maimonides describes it as "the beginning of the degrees of prophecy," and selects it for the first degree of absolute prophecy: First, why does he (Maimonides) say this degree is the "begin ning of the degrees," for if the first and second were not absolute prophecy, as Maimonides has said of them, it is certain that this is the beginning of the remaining degrees? Moreover, why should this be the first of the remaining degrees and not one of the others that he mentions? I say that the meaning of "the beginning of the degrees" is not that it is the first of the degrees70 he enumerates, as Narboni explains, although it is possible to say its explanation is that it is the beginning of the degrees he enumerates in chap. 44,71 for it is the first of the degrees he mentions there. However, that which is correct, in my opinion, is that he does not make this remark to convey the information that this degree72 precedes the others, for the order of their arrangement indicates this. I. e., of absolute prophecy. 71 Moreh Nebhukhim, II, 44. 72 Rd. (1. 21) שהמדרגה for שהמראה.</page><page sequence="21">[21] ABRABANEL ON PROPHECY IN THE MOREH NEBHUKHIM 179 Rather he means to say by this that all the prophets saw parables and enigmas at the beginning of their prophecies — although it is said in these prophecies that they heard clear and explicit statements what they all would see at the beginning of their prophecies were parables and enigmas, and the explicit state ments they would hear constituted an interpretation of those parables — not that some prophecy occurs without parables. For inasmuch as prophecy is an effluence that flows upon the rational and imaginative faculties together, the prophet would see73 parables and images by reason of the imaginative faculty, and the interpretation, which explains and imparts the true meaning, by reason of the rational faculty. You see this from Maimonides' remarks in the ,ספר המדע הלכות יסודי התורה chap. 7 (halakhah 3)&gt; "The things that are made known to a prophet in a prophetic vision are made known to him by means of a parable, then immediately, in the vision, the interpretation of the parable is impressed upon his mind, and he knows what it is, as, e. g., the ladder Jacob saw upon which angels were ascending and descending,74 it was a parable about kingdoms and their subjugation;75 likewise, the 'living creatures' Ezekiel saw;76 the 'seething pot' and 'rod of an almond tree' that Jeremiah saw;77 the 'roll' that Ezekiel saw;78 and the 'measure' Zechariah saw.79 It is the same in the case of other prophets, some of them, like these, report80 the parable with its interpretation and there are others of them who report81 the interpretation alone. At times they report87 the parable alone without interpretation, as in the case of some statements by Ezekiel and Zechariah, but they all prophesy in parables and through enigmas." That which he writes in the book of the Moreh,Moreh, chap. 43, supra,83 agrees with this,84 "We have already explained in our works85 that the prophets would at times « Rd. (1. 24) with L רואה for מאה. 74 Gen. 28:12. 75 Gen. Rabbah 68:20. 76Ezek. 1:5. " Jer. 1:13, 12. ,8 Ezek. 2:9. 79 Zech. 5:6. 80 Rd.

REINES [22] prophesy86 in parables." Do not be deceived that Maimonides' opinion is that at times they prophesied87 in parables and at other times they did not prophesy in parables, for he has already clearly revealed his opinion that the prophets would always prophesy in parables, but at times Scripture mentions the in terpretation adjoining the parable, while other times it does not do so, as is explained there. Hence by reason of this, Maimonides says here of this third degree that it is the "beginning of the degrees," i. e., the ap pearance of images is the beginning of all the degrees of prophecy ; and the other degrees of hearing words that he enumerates constitute interpretation of the images that he (the prophet) sees at the beginning of the prophecy, even if no images are mentioned in that vision or dream. (92 r. 9; 19-33) The second question is one raised earlier,88 why Maimonides gives a classification of prophecy here in chap. 45 after a similar classification has already been given in chap. 44. In chap. 45, Abrabanel answers, the classifica tion of the degrees is the primary purpose; Maimonides is therefore able to give a complete analysis of the classes of prophecy, and to separate them into degrees of dream and vision prophecy. The primary purpose of chap. 44, on the other hand, is to explain the prophecy of Samuel, and the classification of prophecy given there comes to help in this explanation. This classification is presented in general terms, not all the degrees are enumerated, and the sub divison into dream and vision prophecy is omitted: Second, what reason does Maimonides have to enumerate these degrees in this chapter, inasmuch as in chap. 44, supra, you see that Maimonides enumerates these same degrees of seeing parables and images, of hearing a voice without seeing the one speaking to him, seeing a man speaking, seeing an angel speaking, and seeing God speaking? What use is it to enumerate them here again? I say in answer to this that in chap. 44 the degrees of prophecy are mentioned generally, without distinguishing between dream and vision. This was in order to explain the nature of Samuel's prophecy, as is related there. For this reason Maimonides was not satisfied with this,89 and it was necessary to divide the degrees into sections, the degrees of dream by themselves, and the degrees of vision by themselves. I have already stated this above at the beginning of this chapter. (92r. 11-13; 17-19) 86 Rd. (1. 29) יתנבאו for נתננאו; cf. the text of the Moreh. 8ז Rd. (1. 29) יתנבאו for 88 .נתנבאו See pp. 1 f. 8י I. e., with the classification given in chap. 44.</page><page sequence="23">[23] ABRABANEL ON PROPHECY IN THE MOREH NEBHUKHIM 181 The third question is why Maimonides says that in prophecy of the third degree the interpretation must appear in the same dream as the parable or imagery to which it belongs. Even in the case of ordinary dreams, the meaning of a dream often suggests itself only after the person has awakened. Moreover, this same condition is not laid down as regards prophecy of the eighth degree, which is the degree in vision prophecy that corresponds to the third degree in dream prophecy. The answer is that dream prophecy contains considerably more imaginative and irrational material than vision prophecy. Therefore, if the interpretation, which is the rational element that shows the dream to be prophecy, did not appear with it, the dream would be discarded by the prophet as false, and its message lost. Consequently, Maimonides says that in prophecy of the third degree, which is dream prophecy, the interpretation must appear in the same prophecy as the imagery. No such precaution is required of vision prophecy, however, since its imagery is more rational than dream, and imme diately recognizable as prophecy even without interpretation. Accordingly, Maimonides stipulates that only in prophecy of the third degree, because it is dream prophecy, must imagery be accompanied by an interpretation: Thirdly, what is the reason he (Maimonides) says "in that same prophetic dream the meaning of that parable, what is intended by it, is explained to him"? For what brought Mai monides to make a necessary condition of this degree that the interpretation of that parable be explained to the prophet within that (same) dream, since the prophet will oftentimes see90 images and parables and know their interpretation only after he is awakened from his sleep, as he himself writes in chap. 43 of this Part. Therefore, Maimonides' words in this place are not correct. Moreover, he makes no mention of this in the eighth degree, which in vision [prophecy] is equivalent to this one in dream [prophecy]. Maimonides does not lay down with regard to it the condition that he91 see the images and their interpretation in that (same) vision. In truth, Maimonides lays down the condition that the interpretation appear in the same dream but does not say the same of the vision in the eighth degree because Maimonides found upon investigating prophecies that we will at times find parables without interpretation in a vision, but that in a prophetic dream we do not find the appearance of images without an in terpretation adjoining it. Therefore, Maimonides does not make a stipulation92 like this93 one here regarding dream (prophecy) in the case of vision (prophecy). The reason for this is that 90 Rd.

REINES [24] Scripture feared in the case of dream (prophecy) that if no ex planation appeared with it in that dream he94 would think the dream came with a great quantity of (irrelevant) material and that they were absurd things as are vain dreams. Therefore, its interpretation, which proves the fact that it is prophecy, is mentioned with it. But in the case of vision (prophecy) nothing of this would be thought because of its superiority, and therefore, (Scripture) does not take heed to mention within it an interpréta tion of the images as it does in the case of dream (prophecy). (92r. 13-17; 33-37) E. THE FOURTH, FIFTH, SIXTH, AND SEVENTH DEGREES The fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh degrees enumerated by Maimonides describe the different circumstances under which explicit statements are heard by the prophet in dream prophecy. In the fourth degree, the prophet hears speech but does not see the speaker; in the fifth degree, he sees a person who speaks to him; in the sixth degree, an angel who speaks to him; and in the seventh degree, God appears to speak to him. Four questions are raised con cerning these degrees. The first is why the order of the degrees here differs from the one presented in chap. 44. The first two degrees, seeing images, and hearing statements without seeing the one who makes them, are the same in both chapters,95 but in chap. 44 the fifth, sixth, and seventh degrees, a person speak ing, an angel, and God speaking, are listed in reverse order. The same question may also be raised regarding the degrees of vision prophecy. In chap. 44 they are included with dream prophecy in the same degrees, and accordingly, are also listed in reverse order from that which is given in chap. 45. Abrabanel's answer is that Maimonides retains the same order for the first two degrees in both chapters because they appear that way in Scripture. Then, since he further divides his classification here into dream and vision degrees, and he presents the degrees of dream prophecy, which are inferior, before those of vision prophecy, he likewise presents the degrees within dream and vision prophecy which are inferior before those that are superior. Accordingly, he lists the degree of seeing a person speaking, first; seeing an angel, second; and seeing God speaking, last: First, wherefore is the enumeration of the degrees here changed from the way he enumerates them in the aforemen tioned chap. 44? For there he enumerates the appearance of parables first as he enumerates it here, and following it, he enu merates the hearing of words without seeing the one who utters them, which he similarly does here.96 However, as regards the 94 I. e., the prophet. 95 See n. 96, infra. 96 Abrabanel is in error here. The degree of images does come first in chap. 44, but the degree of hearing speech, in which no speaker is seen, is presented fifth or</page><page sequence="25">[25] ABRABANEL ON PROPHECY IN THE MOREH NEBHUKHIM 183 three remaining appearances, — the appearance of a person speaking, an angel, and God, — he enumerates them there in reverse of the way he enumerates them here. For there he enumerates the appearance of God speaking first, then the appearance of the angel, and afterwards, the appearance of a person. Why, then was there this change? I say in answer to all97 this that in chap. 44, as I have ex plained, Maimonides ordered the degrees of prophecy inclusive of dream and vision.98 He enumerates first the two initial cate gories which the Torah enumerates in the verse, "if there be a prophet among you, I the Lord do make Myself known unto him in a vision, I do speak with him in a dream" (Num. 12:6), for the appearance of images is the "making oneself known," as Mai monides explains later in this chapter.99 Thus it100 is the first degree, and hearing a voice is the second degree. Moreover, because these two degrees are enumerated in the Torah, he enumerates them first in chap. 44101 as well as in this chapter without any change at all. However, as regards the other degrees in that chap. 44, he enumerates them from superior to inferior: he starts from God, after it the angel, and then the person. He begins with the great and concludes with the lowly. But in this chap. 45 Maimonides saw fit to recount the degrees from inferior to superior, since their order is from the lower degree to that which is above it. Maimonides begins therefore with the person, after it the angel, and after it God; —because he had similarly enu merated first the degrees of dream, which are the lesser ones, and then the degrees of vision, which are more praiseworthy and noble than they. This is the resolution of the first question. (92r. 38-41; 92v. 9-15) last. Though Abrabanel is incorrect regarding these two degrees his explanation regarding the order of the other degrees may be correct. 9797 In the text Abrabanel raises the three questions together and gives the answers together. Hence in introducing the answer to the first question he says "in answer to all this." 98 I. e., each degree in chap. 44 includes both dream and vision prophecy. No distinction is drawn there between dreams and visions. The distinction between the degrees is based on the different kinds of imagery and speech they contain. In chap. 45, dream and vision prophecy are placed in separate degrees even though they contain the same imagery and speech. 99 Abrabanel's reference is to Maimonides' alternative explanation offered further on in the chapter that speech occurs only in dream prophecy and that parables or intellectual apprehensions alone appear in vision prophecy. 100 I. e., the appearance of images. 101 Rd. (1. 12) מיד for &gt;'0.</page><page sequence="26">184 ALVIN J. REINES [26] The second question concerns Maimonides' classification of the degrees of prophecy in which images are described. In the third and eighth degrees, Mai monides lays down degrees in dream and vision prophecy that include generally all prophecy in which images appear. Yet, in addition, Maimonides lays down further degrees of imagery in the fifth, sixth, seventh, tenth and eleventh degrees, specifying the particular images of a man speaking to the prophet, an angel speaking, and God speaking. The question arises why Maimonides chose to formulate special degrees for these forms of imagery rather than include them generally in the third and eighth degrees. Abrabanel explains that the answer is to be found in the purpose that the degrees were meant to serve. Maimonides did not intend in the degrees to list the different kinds of phantasy that are to be found in the various scriptural prophecies, but to clarify the nature of prophecy and provide further support for his own prophetic theory. Hence the degrees should be considered as answers to inquiries into the nature of prophecy. The first inquiry is whether the prophetic effluence manifests itself entirely as images or whether it also appears as explicit statements. In response to this, Maimonides presents the third and fourth degrees, the former explaining that prophecy occurs as imagery, and, the latter, that it occurs also as explicit statements. The second inquiry is whether the imagery of any prophecy serves to confirm Maimonides' definition that prophecy "is an effluence that flows forth from God through the medium of the Active Intellect, first upon the rational faculty, and then upon the imaginative faculty."102 In response to this, he presents the fifth, sixth, seventh, tenth, and eleventh degrees: the image, in the fifth and tenth degrees, of the human person, who by definition is a rational being, is a symbol of the rational faculty; the image of an angel, in the sixth and eleventh degrees, is a symbol of the Active Intellect; the image of God, in the seventh degree, is a symbol of God. The imagination is ipso facto pointed to by the appearance of images, since images are produced only by the imaginative faculty.103 Consequently, there was a need for these five degrees of specific imagery that could not be met by enumerating the general degrees of imagery alone: Second, why did Maimonides frame all these different degrees? For it is apparent that the appearance of a person, an angel, or of God speaking all constitute images and parables since there is no person, angel, or likeness of God actually in existence there. Consequently, all these degrees could be included in the third degree, the appearances of images. This question applies also to to the degrees of vision (prophecy) that he enumerates. After this, I say that in these degrees Maimonides carried out various investigations. Thus he investigated prophecy first from the standpoint of the effluence itself, whether it is entirely imaginary, — this is the third degree, which is concerned with M or eh M or eh Nebhukhim II, 36. This point is implied by Abrabanel ; he does not state it explicitly. 102</page><page sequence="27">[27] ABRABANEL ON PROPHECY IN THE MOREH NEBHUKHIM 185 the appearance of images, — or whether prophecy consists of clear and explicit statements,104 — this is the fourth degree, as I mentioned. Hence these two degrees constitute an examination of prophecy itself. Following this, Maimonides carried out another investigation, namely, whether prophecy, beside making its apprehension known by voices or images, further attributes that apprehension to that which bestows it on the imaginative faculty, which is the essential recipient of images.105 And inasmuch as the imagination must attribute its apprehension either to the rational faculty, from whence it106 is emanated upon the imagina tion, as is stated in the definition of prophecy, or to the Active Intellect, the proximate agent of107 its 108 prophecy, or to God, its remote agent, Maimonides formulates three degrees with respect to this (inquiry): either a person speaking to him10' is seen, which occurs when it110 attributes its prophecy to the rational faculty; or an angel speaking is seen, when it attributes its prophecy to the Active Intellect, the proximate bestower of its prophecy; or God speaking is seen, which attributes its prophecy to God, the remote agent. Therefore, in accordance with the nature of the subject in question, Maimonides does not formulate more degrees than these. Thus it is clear from this that the appearances of a person, an angel, or God, do not belong among the images and parables, and are not included in the degrees of images, for they are concerned with the one who bestows that effluence upon the imagination, whereas the third degree,111 (the degree) of images, does not pertain to the bestower. With this the second question is resolved. (92r. 41-44; 92v. 16-24) The third question Abrabanel raises serves to sharpen further the point made previously in the second question. In the fourth and ninth degrees,112 Maimonides lays down the degrees that include generally the appearance of speech in dream and vision prophecy. Maimonides then adds the fifth, sixth, seventh, tenth, and eleventh degrees in which he specifies particular kinds of 104 Omit (1. 17) 105 .מפורסמים Rd. (1. 19) צורות for אורות. 106 I. e., the apprehension. 107 I have emended השכל הפועל קרוב to השכל הפועל הפועל הקרוב, which makes the reading analogous to the parallel הש"י שהוא הפועל הרחוק. However, it is possible to retain the original reading and translate it thusly: "to the Intelligence, the agent proximate proximate to its prophecy." 108 I. e., the imagination's. 1091, e., to the prophet. 110 I. e., the imagination. 111 The eighth degree is meant to be included as well. 1" Although Abrabanel does not mention the corresponding degree of vision prophecy, the discussion holds true for the ninth degree as well.</page><page sequence="28">186 ALVIN J. REINES [28] speech. Abrabanel asks why Maimonides found it necessary to formulate these degrees since they do not seem to possess differences of such importance as to merit separate notice. The answer is that the fourth degree does include all prophecy that contains speech, and it was not necessary to list further the kinds of speech that occur in prophecy. However, the additional degrees Maimonides lays down are not meant to constitute such a listing. The prophetic effluence, i. e., the prophetic state of consciousness, wishes to know the sources of the explicit statements that appear in prophecy; these sources are provided by the additional degrees. Taken, then, as indications of the sources of prophecy rather than as descriptions of the forms of prophetic speech, the importance of these degrees, and their individual treatment, can be understood : Third, if Maimonides comes to enumerate here the degrees of prophecy, he should have enumerated only the third, images and parables, and the fourth, explicit statements, — no more than this. What difference is it to us whether the speaker is a person, an angel, God, or whoever it may be? For just as the seeing of images is per se the (third) degree, and no distinction is made whether the one who shows the images is a person, an angel, or God, but (the third degree is simply) the seeing of images, so it would have been proper to do with regard to the hearing of words,"3 without an examination of who it was speaking. The third question is similarly resolved."4 In the third and fourth degrees we examine the apprehension"5 produced by the effluence from the standpoint of what it is in itself, whether it consists in images or the hearing of a voice. However, in the other degrees the effluence yearns for the one who bestows it upon the imaginative faculty, and the rational faculty therefore inscribes who it"6 is; it"7 would not have been satisfied with the enumeration of (the hearing of) a voice alone."8 (92r. 44 — 92V. 4; 92V. 24 f.) 113 I. e., it would have been proper to make one general degree of explicit state ments rather than add different degrees analyzing who made these statements. 114 I. e., resolved in a manner similar to that of the second question. "s The prophetic apprehension, i. e., prophecy. 116 I. e., who it is that bestows the effluence. The rational faculty "inscribes" the donor on the imagination, namely, the knowledge of the rational faculty transmitted to the imagination is fashioned into the phantasy of a man, an angel, or God. I have taken the subject of ולא נסתפק to be the effluence that "yearns" to know its origins. 118 I. e., the "effluence" or state of prophetic consciousness would not be satisfied only with the fourth and ninth degrees, the general degrees of prophetic speech. Abrabanel's point here seems to be that an intellect realized to the degree of prophetic perfection would, according to Maimonides, necessarily require ("yearn for") knowledge of the nature and causes of prophecy.</page><page sequence="29">[29] ABRABANEL ON PROPHECY IN THE MOREH NEBHUKHIM 187 The fourth question elucidates further the thought underlying Maimonides' formulation of the degrees. Why, asks Abrabanel, if the criterion for formulating a separate degree of prophecy is that it portrays the image of a speaker who communicates a divine message, did Maimonides not formulate separate de grees for all the different images Scripture describes as declaring the truth of God, such as celestial bodies like the sun and terrestial bodies like the elements? The answer is that Maimonides did not intend to enumerate all the different images to whom divine communication is ascribed in Scripture, only those to whom the explicit speech of prophecy can be attributed. Such speech is rational, and can only be attributed, therefore, to one of the three intellects described by Maimonides in his definition as the rational sources of prophecy; these are the rational faculty, the Active Intellect, and God. For this reason, Maimonides formulates just three degrees of images to whom prophetic speech is attributed: the human person, representing the rational faculty; the angel, representing the Active Intellect; and the deity, representing God: Fourth, if it is the case that he formulated the degrees ac cording to speakers, whether a person, an angel, or God, why did he not formulate another degree if the speaker119 is a body,120 the sun, moon, or stars, for they, like the angels, also "declare the glory of God, And the firmament showeth His handiwork" (Ps. 19:2); or if the speaker is one of the elements, fire, wind, or earth, e. g., "Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee" (Job 12:8); or one of the animals, e. g., "But ask now the beasts, and they shall tell thee; And the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee; And the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee" {ibid.{ibid. 7, 8). These questions also include the vision degrees just as they apply to and include the dream degrees. The fourth question is similarly resolved.121 The voice is attributed to a speaker who is a person, an angel, or God, and to no other existent either of the superlunaries or the sublunaries because the imagination can only attribute its apprehensions to those three agents that emanate effluence upon it, i. e., the rational faculty, the Active Intellect, and God, according as the three of them are described in the definition of prophecy. Moreover, from this you understand why it122 does not attribute the images and parables to a person, an angel, or to God as it does the statements that were heard. This is because clear and "י Rd. (I. 6) הסדבר for במדבר. 120 Perhaps 6 .1) נשם) should be emended to גשם חמישי, and the words "a body" changed to "quintessence." "Quintessence" serves better as a parallel to "elements," infra, infra, 1. 8. 121 In a manner similar to the previous two questions. 122 I. e., the imagination.</page><page sequence="30">188 ALVIN J. REINES [30] explicit statements are intellectual apprehensions, and therefore, are attributed either to the rational faculty, the Active Intellect, or God, because their apprehensions and the effluence emanated from them are all intellectual. As for images and parables, they come from the imaginative faculty itself, for it joins the com binationsbinations and corporealizes the intellectual effluence. Thus be cause neither the intellectual faculty, the Active Intellect, still less God, emanates corporeal images and phantastic illusion, the phantasy images and parables are therefore not attributed to those intellects that pour forth the effluence. Reflect upon the explanation I have given of this, for it is extraordinary, and indicates the wisdom of Maimonides and the depth of his specula tion. It includes the degrees of dream (prophecy) Maimonides enumerates here, and the degrees of vision (prophecy) he enu merates later. (92v. 4-9; 25-32) F. THE EIGHTH, NINTH, AND TENTH DEGREES Maimonides' description of the eighth, ninth, and tenth degrees reads as follows: "The eighth degree is that a חזון (revelation)123 comes to him124 in a מראה הנבואה (prophetic vision) and he sees parables, as, e. g., Abraham in the vision between the pieces ;125 for those126 parables took place in a vision by day, as is clearly stated. The ninth degree is that he hears words in a vision, as is said with reference to Abraham, 'And behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying: "This man shall not be thine heir" ' (ibid. 4). The tenth degree is that he sees a person speaking to him in a vision, as, e. g., Abraham again, by the terebinths of Mamre (ibid. 18:1), and Joshua at Jericho (Josh. 5:13)." Four questions are raised by Abrabanel concerning these degrees. The first relates to Maimonides' statement that the "eighth degree is that a חזון comes" to a prophet "in a מראה הנבואה." Inasmuch as Maimonides has explained earlier in chap. 41 that חזון and מראה הנבואה are synonyms for prophetic vision,12''vision,12'' this statement is equivalent to "a prophetic vision comes in a prophetic vision," which is tautological and nonsensical: With regard to the degrees of vision Maimonides enumerates, I have raised four questions. The first concerns the statement 123 The meaning of חזון as "revelation," a term for prophecy in general, is deter mined by Abrabanel in his answer to the first question. 12וי I. e., to the prophet. 12s Gen. 15; in particular, vs. 17. 126 The underlying Arabic text reads (תלך (אלאמתאל which can be translated as this this this or that, or here, since it modifies a plural, as these or those (parables). The translations generally have these. However, Ibn Tibbon translates □המשלים) הה), those those (parables). Since Abrabanel employed Ibn Tibbon's translation, the latter has been followed here. 127 See n. 128, infra.</page><page sequence="31">[31] ABRABANEL ON PROPHECY IN THE MOREH NEBHUKHIM 189 that "a חזון comes to him in a מראה הנבואה." Inasmuch as Mai monides writes in chap. 41 of this Part that ,מחזה ,מראה הנבואה חזון, and יד אדני are all synonyms applied to the same thing, namely, the prophetic vision, how can Maimonides say therefore that a חזון comes in a מראה הנבואה as if a חזון were something other than a 128?מראה הנבואה It is like saying that a מראה הנבואה came to him [in a מראה הנבואה] since חזון and מראה are both the same thing. I will now answer them.129 With respect to the first (question), despite the fact that Maimonides says מראה הנבואה and 130חזון are both the same thing, he does not think that חזון, like מחזה, is to be applied to vision prophecy. Rather, חזון, in his opinion, is a term for prophecy in general not for one of its varieties. You see this from his remarks in the aforementioned chap. 41, for he says, in describing the fourth degree,131 "the fundamental principle132 is that no נבואה or חזון comes except in a dream or vision, and through the medium of an angel." Thus you see that for him חזון is a synonym for נבואה. According to this, then, Maimonides here says, "The eighth degree is that a חזון comes to him in a מראה הנבואה and he sees parables," i. e., a חזון, which is prophecy, comes to him, and he does not hear explicit state ments, but sees parables and images. (92v. 33-36; 93r. 8-12) 128 Abrabanel is in error here. Maimonides does not say in chap. 41 that חזון and מראה הנבואה are synonymous, although he does say that מחזה ,מראה הנבואה, and יד אדני are. (But see n. 129, infra.) Abrabanel's conclusion that חזון is a term for prophecy in general is correct. 129 I. e., Abrabanel turns from the questions he has raised to the answers he will give. In the text the questions are all raised together and then answered. For con venience I have placed each answer next to its question. 1"נ Rd. (1. 9) וחזון for ומחזה. However, it is possible that Abrabanel caught the error of his question (n. 127, supra), and in his answer attempts to correct himself. If מחזה is retained in the text, then Abrabanel is saying in his answer that חזון should not be confused with מחזה, as if the original question were, "מחזה and חזון are clearly synonyms, and Maimonides says that מחזה and מראה הנבואה are synonyms, which makes his statement in the eighth degree tautological." ■3" Maimonides, in chap. 41, describes four modes of expression employed in Scripture to report that speech has come in a prophecy to a prophet. The fourth mode, which Abrabanel terms somewhat loosely the fourth degree, is that the prophet relates he has received a communication from God without explaining that it was received in a dream or vision and through an angel. Maimonides says this occurs because the prophet takes it as an established principle that no prophecy comes except in a dream or vision, and through an angel, the phrase quoted by Abrabanel. "2 The text of Abrabanel reads והשורש, the fundamental principle. Correctly, it should read והושרש. This error was most likely in Abrabanel's copy of the Moreh since it occurs in the manuscripts. See Munk, op. cit., II, 315; n. 2.</page><page sequence="32">190 ALVIN J. REINES [32] The second question concerns an apparently useless repetition that appears in Maimonides' presentation of the eighth degree. As an illustration of this degree, Maimonides cites Abraham's prophecy described in Gen. 15. This chapter begins with the words, "After these things the •word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision (במחזה), saying: 'Fear not, Abram, I am thy shield, thy reward shall be exceeding great.' " Maimonides, after citing this prophecy, adds that it came by day "as is explicitly stated." By "explicitly stated" Maimonides means that a phrase in the story of the prophecy itself makes it clear that the prophecy came during the day. This phrase appears in verse 12, which begins, "And it came to pass, that, when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram," clearly implying that the prophecy that came to Abraham described in verses I—11 was received by day since the sun had not yet set.133 The question Abrabanel raises is why it was necessary for Mai monides to point out that it is from verse 12 that we know the prophecy came by day inasmuch as, according to his view, we know this from the first verse which describes the prophecy as a vision (מחזה), and visions, since they come when the prophet is not asleep133 may be assumed to come by day. Abrabanel's answer is that the imagery of this prophecy could lead the reader to question Maimonides' definition of מחזה as vision prophecy. In verse 5, which appears in the midst of the story of the prophecy, we read, "And He brought him forth abroad, and said: 'Look now toward heaven, and count the stars, if thou be able to count them.' " The conclusion could be drawn from this that if there were stars out, the prophecy came by night in a dream, and that the word מחזה, therefore, refers to dream prophecy. Thus to forestall this possible objec tion, Maimonides does not rely upon the description of the prophecy as a מחזה but adduces verse 12 as his proof that the prophecy was a vision that came by day when the prophet was not asleep: Secondly, why was Maimonides compelled to explain that the vision of "between the pieces" took place by day. If it was to teach that it did not take place in a dream but in a prophetic vision, and the evidence that necessitates the conclusion that it took place135 by day comes from the verse, "and it came to pass, that, when the sun was going down, (a deep sleep fell upon Abram)" (Gen. 15:12), Scripture at the beginning of the vision had already testified that it was a vision and not a dream in the statement, "the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a מחזה" (ibid.(ibid. 1), and if it took place in a מחזה, which is a prophetic vision, it is evident that it did not take place in a dream of the night. Why, then, was Maimonides compelled to say, "for those parables came in a vision by day as is explicitly stated?" 'ננ Cf. Munk, op. cit., II, 343, n. 3; also, see Abrabanel's comment to Gen. 15 in his commentary on Scripture. 134 The prophet in vision prophecy is neither asleep nor fully awake, he is in a trance. Dream prophecy comes when the prophet is asleep. 135 Literally: that which makes it necessary that it took place.</page><page sequence="33">[33] ABRABANEL ON PROPHECY IN THE MOREH NEBHUKHIM 191 According to the opinion of Maimonides, the interpretation of the verse proceeds in this manner. "After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision": It was the •word of of the Lord. This is the degree of the appearance of parables for it is the one that is truly called the word of the Lord; as is said of the third degree, [the degree of] the appearance of parables in dream (prophecy), it is [the degree] "of those who say,136 'And the word of the Lord,' " or (use) expressions similar to this. Consider why Maimonides calls the appearance of images the word word of the Lord, for it truly shows his wisdom. This is because where it states, "And the Lord said," or "And the Lord spoke," it indicates that this is an intellectual effluence, clear and explicit, without parables. Therefore it is attributed to the incorporeal being that bestows it. But when the prophet sees parables and images, he says "the word of the Lord" has come to him, i. e., he has seen a thing or image that points allegorically to the incorporeal effluence.137 Hence inasmuch as in the vision between the the pieces, the seeing of images and the hearing of explicit state ments (both) occur, Scripture, at the beginning of it, states, "the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision," i. e., he saw the word of the Lord, which consists of the images it mentions in that vision, the purpose of whose appearance was to inform him that his reward would be very great. — It alludes in this138 to the gifts of the lands of the gentiles that God bestows upon Abraham at the end of this vision. — Accordingly, therefore, "The word of the Lord came unto Abram," is a general descrip tion of the vision.139 Scripture next explains how this (vision) came about. It says that Abraham had spoken in his prayer before God, "O Lord God, what wilt Thou give me" {ibid. 2); and because no answer came to this utterance, he voiced a second utterance in his prayer, "Behold, to me Thou has given no seed" {ibid. 3). Then, in answer to140 his petition and supplication, "Behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying: 'This man shall not be thine heir . . .י " {ibid. 4). These were explicit words Abraham "6 Rd. (1. 14) שהיא טי שיאמר for שהוא מ' שיאמר; cf. text of the Moreh. '3'*3' I. e., the phrase "the word of the Lord came" leaves the immediate source of the "word" anonymous. This source is the imagination which allegorizes the prophetic effluence into images. However, in such a phrase as, "The Lord said," the prophecy is directly attributed to an intellectual being. 158 I. e., in this promise of reward. '3» Maimonides elaborates on the structure of the prophecy in the third question, infra.infra. 140 Literally: with respect to.</page><page sequence="34">192 AL VIN J. REINES [34] heard, and he did not know who it was who spoke them, but inasmuch as he saw the heavens and the stars in the same vision, it is said therein that "the word of the Lord came to him."141 Furthermore because it would be possible to think that this (vision) occurred in a dream of the night, from the statement, "And He brought him forth abroad, and said: 'Look now toward heaven, and count the stars . . .י " {ibid. 5), Maimonides was compelled to prove that the vision took place by day from the statement below it, "And it came to pass, that, when the sun was going down" {ibid. 12). Maimonides is saying, therefore, that in a vision Abraham appeared to see [God] take him out side and command him to count the stars, but (the phrase) "the sun was going down" points out that the vision took place in the late afternoon. In this way, then, are the first two questions resolved. When Maimonides says, "a חזון comes to him" he means to say that a prophecy comes to him; and he was compelled to say that the prophecy came by day to remove the objection of "and count the stars." (92v. 36-39; 93r. 12-26) The third question is based upon Abrabanel's interpretation that the ninth degree occupies a position in vision prophecy parallel to that of the fourth degree in dream prophecy. Consequently, all the characteristics of the fourth degree must be true of the ninth, whether or not these are explicitly stated with regard to the latter. Accordingly, the characteristic of the fourth degree, that the speaker of the words heard in the prophecy is unknown to the prophet, must also belong to prophecy of the ninth degree. In that case, how can Maimonides cite Abraham's vision received in Gen. 15:4 as an example of such a prophecy, inasmuch as Abraham in verse 2 addresses God directly, and must have known, therefore, that God was the speaker? Abrabanel's answer involves an exposition of Gen. 15 employing in part the exegesis given earlier in his discussion of the second question. In this discussion two points were made: that verse I is not itself part of the prophecy, but a general state ment describing the prophecy that is to come later in the chapter; that verses 2 and 3 are not prophecy, but the description of an ordinary prayer of petition and supplication addressed by Abraham to God. The prophecy proper begins with with verse 4, "And, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying: 'This man shall not be thine heir. . .Moreover, the first clause, "And, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him saying," is again not part of the prophecy, but an introduction to the prophecy.142 The words, "this man shall not be 141 141 I. e., the vision belongs not only to the eighth degree by virtue of its imagery, but also to the ninth degree by virtue of its speech. Abrabanel takes this point up in the discussion of his third question, infra. 14־ Although the word of the Lord normally introduces visions of the eighth</page><page sequence="35">[35] ABRABANEL ON PROPHECY IN THE MO RE H NEBHUKHIM 193 thine heir," begin the actual prophecy. With verses I through 3 removed, it is clear that the speech in verse 4 comes from nowhere, and that Abraham, therefore, has no knowledge of who the speaker is until verse 7, when the words are identified as belonging to God.143 Thus in the prophecy that is de scribed in verses 4 through 6 Abraham did not know who the speaker was, and it is properly classified, therefore, as prophecy of the ninth degree: The third (question) concerns his statement in the ninth degree that "he (the prophet) hears words in a vision, as is said with reference to Abraham, 'And behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying: "This man shall not be thine heir" ' (Gen. 15:4)." For inasmuch as this degree,144 of the vision (section of the classification), lacks, in my opinion, as I explained regarding the fourth degree, of the dream (section), (the phrase) "that he hears words but does not see the one who utters them," then how can Maimonides say such as this145 with respect to Abraham regarding this vision seeing that he did know that the one speaking to him was God, as is written, ". . . the word of the Lord came unto Abraham in a vision (saying): 'Fear not, Abram, I am thy shield,' " and he answered Him, "O Lord God, what wilt Thou give me." Thus Abraham did know who the speaker was! As for whence Maimonides derived that when146 the word of the the Lord came to him Abraham did not see who it was speaking to him, it is that he found in Scripture following it, "I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees" {ibid. 7), degree, the phrase can be used here to introduce the ninth degree because images, i. e., the stars (vs. 5), accompany the words. See the fourth question, infra. 143 A difficulty arises here in connection with Abrabanel's interpretation ; namely, what is the nature of the prophecy that is described in vss. 7-11 ? It cannot be proph ecy of the ninth degree since the speaker is known. Moreover, it cannot be prophecy of the tenth and eleventh degrees since the speakers in those degrees are the human person and the angel. The answer would seem to be that the words in the prophecy vss. 7-11 should not be understood to have appeared in the prophecy as explicit speech, but as a communication conveyed through parables and images. Hence there are two vision prophecies described in Gen. 15, one that is a composite of the eighth and ninth degrees, vss. 4-6, and a vision of the eighth degree alone, vss. 7-11. Cf., the fourth question, infra. 144 The term degree here refers to the general degree of speech in prophecy, which, in Maimonides' classification of the degrees in chap. 45, is broken down into two degrees, the fourth and ninth. The former is the general degree of speech in dream prophecy, the latter, in vision prophecy. 145 Rd. (1. 3) כזה for בזה. The point is how Maimonides can say that Abraham did not see the speaker in this vision, which is implied by classifying this prophecy of Abraham's in the ninth degree. 146 Rd. (1. 26) שבהיות for ויהי.</page><page sequence="36">194 ALVIN J. REINES [36] and if he had known who it was speaking to him what need was there in His informing him that it was God. Moreover, this expression147 is used only at the beginning of a prophecy, as, e. g., "And God spoke unto Moses, and said unto him: 'I am the Lord . . .י " (Exod. 6:2).148 Hence, for this reason, Mai monides says Abraham heard words but did not know who149 was speaking them and therefore He informed him that it was God.150 (92V. 39~93r. 7; 93r. 26-29) The fourth question concerns the foregoing analysis of Gen. 15, which finds that according to Maimonides' interpretation there are two visions of different degrees in the same chapter of Scripture. However, from the account of Abraham's experience, it is apparent that throughout the chapter one in tegrated subject is pursued in a continuous and consecutive narrative. Thus even though one vision faded and another completely different appeared, the second vision took up the theme exactly where the first left off. Abrabanel asks the basis on which such an implausible interpretation can be defended. The answer is that no matter how Maimonides' interpretation appears to complicate matters, it is required by the scriptural account. In verse 7, the phantasied voice of God reveals its identity, which requires it to be prophecy of a different degree from the vision that appears in verses 4-6. Furthermore, there is clear proof from this very chapter that a continuous and consecutive narrative may be revealed in Scripture through different prophetic experiences. In verses 12-17, the prophecy that has been revealed through two successive visions of different degrees is now communicated through still another kind of prophetic experience, dream prophecy; as Scripture says, "a deep sleep fell upon Abram": The fourth (question) is: if this vision of "between the pieces" is connected and continuous from its beginning to its end, how is it possible for part of it to belong to the ninth degree151 as is (taught by) Maimonides' words here? For the entire vision should perforce consist of statements and images belonging to the same degree, not of two different degrees. It is for this same reason1" that Maimonides made two 147 I. e., the word of the Lord came. 148 The prophecy in Exod. 6:2 ff. begins with the statement "God spoke unto Moses," but then God proceeds to identify Himself. This shows that the first state ment is merely introductory, describing what is to happen in the prophecy, and does not mean that the prophet is immediately aware of who is speaking to him. 14י Rd.

If the two of them153 belonged to the same degree, it would not have been necessary to say in the midst of them, "I am the Lord..." (Gen. 15:7); but the two of them154 belong to dif ferent degrees. One should not be surprised at this, for it also says'55 following this, "a deep sleep fell upon Abram" (ibid. 12), i. e., a dream; the prophecy disappeared and became a dream. Now, if (Scripture) makes part of the same chapter a vision and part of it a dream, it can certainly make of it different visions. The latter two questions are hereby resolved. (93r. 7 f. ; 93r. 29-32) G. THE ELEVENTH DEGREE I.I. THE SACRIFICE OF ISAAC Abrabanel divides Maimonides' discussion of the eleventh degree into various passages to which he offers individual comments. The first of these passages is Maimonides' opening remark on the eleventh degree; "The eleventh degree is that the prophet sees an angel who speaks to him in a vision, as, e. g., Abraham at the moment of the 'Aqedah."156 Two questions are raised concerning this passage. First, if the sacrifice of Isaac took place in a vision and not in reality, and Abraham never was called upon to sacrifice Isaac, how can we learn from this story the two lessons in morality that Maimonides draws in a later chapter of the Moreh: that the fear of God is the object of the Law; and that the prophets had complete faith in the truth of their prophecies. Second, if Abraham never actually underwent this trial, how can the belief be true that Abraham's descendants merit special grace because of his willingness to sacrifice Isaac. Abrabanel's answer is that part of the story of Isaac's sac rifice actually occurred : I have also raised questions concerning these words. First, how can Maimonides say the angel spoke to Abraham in a vision at the moment of the 'Aqedah of Isaac inasmuch as it would necessarily follow that that entire event of the 'Aqedah of Isaac was imaginary, appearing to him in a prophetic vision and not during consciousness? Can we then learn from that event the lessons Maimonides enumerates in chap. 24, Part III? And what, consequently, is the merit that remains from this for his seed if nothing of it took place in actuality? However, the answer to this is clear. Maimonides believes Maimonides concluded that Abraham did not know who was speaking to him, namely, Gen. 15:7. ISS I. e., the two parts of the vision assigned to two different degrees. 154 Rd.

REINES [38] that the entire event took place in actuality, but hearing the voice of the angel who spoke to Abraham took place in a prophetic vision. That is to say, first the command came to Abraham in a dream of the night, "Take now thy son," and Abraham "rose early in the morning" and actually saddled the ass, "and took two of his young men with him . . . and rose up, and went" (Gen. 22:2, 3). The entire incident then followed in actuality as it appears in the story until Abraham takes "the knife to slay his son." {Ibid. 10.) Then prophecy came to him, "And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven" {ibid. 11), and commanded him not to lay his hand upon the lad. Abraham then awakened and actually "looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in the thicket by his horns. And Abraham . . . offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son." {Ibid. 13.) Abraham then prayed [and "called the name of the place] Adonai jireh: as it is said to this day," etc., {ibid. 14). At this moment a prophecy came to him another time saying, "because thou hast done this thing ... I will bless thee," etc., {ibid. 16). Here you have it that the entire event occurred in actuality and during consciousness, but the speech of the angel took place in a prophetic vision. For this reason, Maimonides says in this degree, "as, for example, Abraham at the moment of (בשעת) the 'Aqedah of Isaac," to exclude the other events which did not take place in prophecy, for the hearing of the words of the angel at at that moment took place in a prophetic vision. Maimonides says this is the highest of the degrees of prophecy according to the evidence of Scriptures. (93r. 33) II.II. TWO QUALIFICATIONS Maimonides then says of the eleventh degree, "This, in my opinion, is the highest of the degrees of the prophets whose states are attested by the (prophetic) books, after having established that which has been established regarding the perfection of the rational qualities of the individual in accordance with what speculation requires, and after the exclusion of Moses." Thus Maimonides lays down two qualifications of his opinion that the eleventh degree is the highest degree of prophecy that occurs in Scripture : that it is the highest degree for those who understand that rational perfection is required for prophecy; and that it is the highest degree except for Moses' prophecy which was higher. Abrabanel explains the reasons for these two qualifications as follows. Two objections can be brought against Maimonides' statement that the eleventh degree is the highest degree of prophecy. One, that there are people who imagine more grandiose phantasies than those that appear in prophecy of the eleventh degree; and two, that the prophecy of Moses came without the media</page><page sequence="39">[39] ABRABANEL ON PROPHECY IN THE MOREH NEBHUKHIM 197 tion of the imagination, "without the appearance of an angel," and consisted therefore of rational statements alone, which is a higher degree of prophecy than that described in the eleventh degree. Consequently, Maimonides qualifies his evaluation of the eleventh degree by excluding the phantasies of those who do not possess the rational qualities necessary for prophecy, and Moses, whose prophecy is not included in the discussion of prophecy in these chapters: Maimonides says this is the "highest of the degrees of prophecy" according to the evidence of Scripture. However, he says in addition, "after having established that which has been established regarding the perfection of prophecy in ac cordance with what speculation requires,157 and after the exclusion of Moses," in order to remove from himself two objections that possibly could be raised against what he had said. The first is that there already have existed epileptic or feverish persons who say that they see angels with six wings apiece, and things similar to this. Maimonides says this does not contradict his statement158 for they are lacking the rational qualities, as he states in chap. 37 of this Part. His statements here concern the true prophets who are perfect as regards rational qualities. The second objection is that we have previously found159 the hearing of a voice160 with out the appearance of an angel. It is said, "when Moses entered into the Tent, (the pillar of cloud descended, and stood at the door of the Tent;) and [the Lord] spoke with Moses" (Exod. 33:9), which is a higher degree than this eleventh degree. How, therefore, can Maimonides say that it is the highest of all the degrees? Thus for this reason he says, "and after the exclusion of Moses," i. e., he stipulates that he (Moses) is not included in what he says in these chapters about prophecy. (93r 43) III. THE REASON THE IMAGE OF GOD DOES NOT APPEAR SPEAKING TO THE PROPHET IN VISION PROPHECY After stating that the highest degree of prophecy is the vision of an angel speaking, Maimonides goes on to explain why this is so; "As for whether it is possible that a prophet should also161 appear to see God speaking to him in a 5'' Rd. (1. 43) אחר אשר התישב מה שהתישב משלמות הבריות האיש כפי מה שיחייבהו העיון הברות האיש כפי מה שחייבהו העיון for אחרי מה שהתורע (לא שהתיישב) משלמות; cf. text of the Moreh.Moreh. "8 The statement that the eleventh degree is the highest degree apprehended by the prophets. 185 I. e., in Scripture. 160 I. e., in prophecy. 161 Abrabanel (1. 48) has נ"כ in the lemma for עור in the printed text of the Moreh. לב better translates the sense here of the underlying Arabic איצא.</page><page sequence="40">198 ALVIN J. REINES [40] prophetic vision, this to me is improbable, for the action of the imaginative faculty162 does not attain to this. Moreover, we do not find this state among the other prophets. For this reason the Torah states expressly, 'I the Lord do make Myself known unto him in a vision, I do speak with him in a dream' (Num. 12:6); it places speech in the dream alone, whereas it places the union and pouring forth of the intellect in the vision. This is the significance of the ex pression 163,(במראה) אליו אתודע (I the Lord do make Myself known unto him in a vision), which is a reflexive of ידע (to know). Thus it does not state explicitly that speech coming from God is heard." Four questions are raised regarding this passage. The first and second relate to the same problem: why Maimonides says it is "improbable," in his opinion, that a prophet should envision God speaking to him because the "action of the imagination does not attain to this," when in the seventh degree God is pictured by the imagination speaking to the prophet. The answer given is that Maimonides' remarks concerning the inability of the imagination to reproduce God refer to vision prophecy, whereas the seventh degree is dream prophecy. A significant distinction exists between these two modes of revelation : dream prophecy is produced during sleep, when the intellect is weak and barely able to control the action of the imagination, therefore, the latter is free to attempt the absurd task of picturing God ; whereas vision prophecy is produced during consciousness,164 when the intellect possesses the power to control the action of the imagination, and can therefore limit the imagination to phantasies symbolizing notions that the intellect can conceive. Since the intellect cannot conceive God, the imagination in vision prophecy is not permitted to represent the divine image : There are questions to be raised concerning this (passage). First, why is it "improbable" to Maimonides that a prophet should see God speaking to him (in a vision) inasmuch as this occurs previously in the prophetic dream, as he states in the seventh degree of this chapter? Second, regarding his statement, "the action of the imagina tive faculty does not attain to this," how can Maimonides say this when it is contrary to what he writes in the seventh degree, as I have stated? Seeing that in a dream of prophecy the action of the imaginative faculty already attains to this, why then can it not likewise attain to it in a vision? 161 As pointed out by Munk (op. cit., II, 344; n. 3,) Ibn Tibbon incorrectly renders the Arabic קוה פעל אלמתכילה by פעל כה המדמה. It should read כח פעל המדמה, the the power of the action of the imagination. I have translated the Ibn Tibbon version since this is the one employed by Abrabanel. 163 The parentheses are my own. Ibn Tibbon's version unnecessarily adds במראה to the אליו אתודע given in the Arabic text. 164 Actually, semi-consciousness, but not during sleep. The prophet enters a trance of sorts to receive vision prophecy.</page><page sequence="41">[41] ABRABANEL ON PROPHECY IN THE MOREH NEBHUKHIM 199 My answer to these questions is: First,165 it is improbable to Maimonides that a prophet should appear to see God speaking to him in a vision because that which the intellect is unable to apprehend the imagination is unable to represent. Thus inasmuch as God is unable to be conceived by the human intellect, there is no doubt that the imaginative faculty cannot represent Him. This is the same interpretation Narboni offers to this;166 "The action action of the imaginative faculty does not attain to this: i. e., to representing the First Cause. For when it desires to represent this (Cause), it finds a 'cloud and thick darkness'167 about Him which prevents it from seeing Him. For inasmuch as the imagina tion is emanated upon from the intellect168 and follows it, that which the intellect is unable to conceive the imagination cannot represent."16' With regard to the second question, I answer that the prophecy that comes to a prophet in a vision is clearer and more lucid, without the imaginative confusions of prophecy that appear in a dream. For when a person is sleeping his imagination is not regulated by the intellect, therefore, inasmuch as the intellect is too feeble during sleep to give it the lie, the imagination multi plies its confusions and delusions in its combinations. But when prophecy comes while a person is awake and conscious, the imaginative faculty is found to be regulated and subdued by the intellectual faculty, and all its combinations are orderly and regulated. This is the superiority of vision over dream (prophecy). In view of this, Maimonides accepts that in a prophetic dream it is possible for it to appear that a prophet sees God speaking to him, for inasmuch as the imaginative faculty in a dream is un regulated170 at that time, its combinations reach such exaggerated states as to imagine something like this, i. e., to reproduce an image or likeness of the First Cause. But in a prophetic vision, where the imagination is not so unregulated and delusive, it is 165 Rd.

However, the text of Narboni varies slightly on other points as well. 144 Literally: that with respect to whose formation the intellect is powerless, the imagination imagination is powerless with respect to its representation. 1,01, e., relatively unregulated. The intellect is powerful enough to exert control over the imagination in all prophecy; but the intellect is less powerful in dream than in vision prophecy.</page><page sequence="42">200 ALVIN J. REINES [42] improbable, in Maimonides' opinion, for it to imagine this. This is the reason that this171 is improbable in a prophetic vision, although it is not improbable in a dream. (93r.49-93v.4j 93v. 8-18) The third question concerns Maimonides' statement that the proof of his contention that the image of God speaking does not occur in vision prophecy is that "this state," i. e., a phantasy of God speaking, is not found "among the other prophets." Yet how is this a proof, if by Maimonides' own phrase, "the other prophets," he implies that there were prophets who did see God speaking. Thus we find in the seventh degree of prophecy that Isaiah and Micaiah, the son of Imlah, saw God speaking to them. And if we can establish that these two prophets experienced such a phantasy, what does it matter that the other prophets did not, since this is sufficient proof that the image of God speaking does appear in prophecy? The answer given is that by "other prophets" Maimonides means all prophets other than Moses. Isaiah and Micaiah saw God speaking in dream prophecy, and Maimonides would not have had to exclude them specifically from this discussion since it concerns only vision prophecy. Moses, however, did see "the similitude of the Lord" speaking to him in a vision, and Maimonides therefore points out that no prophet other than Moses saw the image of God speaking in a vision: Third, regarding the statement, "Moreover, we do not find this state among the other prophets," for who are those prophets among whom we do find this state so that Maimonides says it is not similarly found "among the other prophets?" Are they Isaiah and Micaiah, the son of Imlah, whom he mentions in the seventh degree? Inasmuch as it is found172 among these two prophets, "what shall be given unto him and what shall be done more unto him"173 whether or not it is likewise found among the other prophets? I maintain174 that Maimonides does not say, "Moreover, we do not find this state among the other prophets," in relation to Isaiah and Micaiah, the son of Imlah, but to Moses, for this (state) was peculiar to him, and is not found in connection with another prophet. Similarly, Narboni writes; "Moreover we do not find this state among the other prophets: He (Maimonides) means this rank is peculiar to Moses. He is the accepted one 'and the similitude of the Lord doth he behold' " (Num. 12:8).175 1,1 I. e., the image of God speaking. 172 Rd. (1. 5) שנמצא for שנמצאה. 173 A quotation slightly modified from Ps. 102:3. 174 Literally: Thirdly, I say. י" The preceding clause clearly makes the point that Moses beheld the image of God speaking; "with him do I speak mouth to mouth, even manifestly, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the Lord doth he behold."</page><page sequence="43">[43] ABRABANEL ON PROPHECY IN THE MOREH NEBHUKHIM 201 It is for this same reason also, I believe, that Maimonides says above, "and after the exclusion of Moses." (93v. 4-6; 93V. 18-20) The fourth question concerns Maimonides' statement that the verse, "I the Lord do make Myself known unto him in a vision, I do speak with him in a dream," is further proof that God does not appear in visions. For although it is true this verse limits the appearance of God speaking to dreams, "I do speak with him in a dream," it nevertheless also states that God appears in visions, "I"I"I do make Myself known unto him in a vision," which means that the image of God does appear in visions. The answer is that Maimonides' point is not that the image of God will not appear in vision prophecy but that the image of God speaking will not appear. The image of God alone, or the image of God together with speech from some other source does appear:17«■ Fourth, regarding his statement, "For this reason the Torah states expressly, '1 the Lord do make Myself known unto him in a vision, I do speak with him in a dream'; it places speech in the dream alone, whereas it places the union and pouring forth of the intellect in the vision," what is the explicit statement regarding this matter that Maimonides finds in this verse? For if it places speech in dream so does it also place "making Himself known" in the vision, and this is the appearance of God. Con sequently, Scripture says, "if there be a prophet among you, I the Lord do make Myself known unto him in a vision," which in his opinion, is improbable. With regard to the fourth question, I answer that Maimonides does not think it improbable for a prophet to hear words in a prophetic vision and to see177 a similitude belonging to God,178 for example, "And one that was ancient of days did sit," as Daniel saw in his vision (Dan. 7:9),179 for this180 belongs only to the eighth degree, which is the appearance of parables and images. But what Maimonides thinks improbable is that in a prophetic vision a prophet should see God speaking, which is seeing the divine image together with hearing the sound of the words it speaks to him. Maimonides says the Torah states this explicitly in the verse, "I the Lord do make Myself known unto 1,6 The image of God alone in a vision is prophecy of the eighth degree; the image of God together with anonymous speech or speech from another source is prophecy of the ninth degree. "" Rd. (1. 21) ויראה תמונה for תמונה. "8 Omit (1. 21) .ונעררת י" Since Daniel was not a prophet, as Abrabanel has noted in his comments to the second degree, we may take Abrabanel to mean that visions with the same content as Daniel's non-prophetic phantasies are seen. 180 I. e., this image of God.</page><page sequence="44">202 ALVIN J. REINES [44] him in a vision, I do speak with him in a dream," for it places speech in the dream and [assigns] to vision the pouring forth of the intellect and its union. From this (verse) it is apparent that in a prophetic vision it is impossible for the appearance of God speaking to occur, since it singles out "making Himself known" for the vision, and places speech into the dream alone. Therefore, Maimonides says, "Thus it does not state explicitly that anything from God is heard181 in it," for this, in his opinion, is improbable. (93v. 6-8; 21-25) IV. THE QUESTION OF SPEECH IN VISION PROPHECY Having argued on the basis of the verse, "I the Lord do make Myself known unto him in a vision, I do speak with him in a dream," that it is un likely God should appear speaking in a vision, Maimonides continues this discussion with the following observation; "when I found texts attesting to speech that the prophets had heard, and it is clear that this took place in a vision, I said, as an opinion,182 that it is possible that this speech which is heard in a dream and the like of which is not possible in a vision is that which is imagined by him (the prophet) God addresses to him. All this183 is derived from following the literal sense. However, one could say that every vision which is found with the hearing of speech is first of all a vision, and afterward reaches a a (state of) deep immersion and becomes a dream,18'• as we have explained with reference to the phrase, 'a deep sleep fell upon Abram' (Gen. 15:12);185 they (the Sages) say, 'this is the deep sleep of prophecy.'186 All speech, then, that is heard, however it is heard, takes place in a dream, as the text says, 'I do speak with him in a dream,' whereas in the prophetic vision, only parables or in tellectual conceptions187 are apprehended that lead to the acquisition of a knowledge of scientific matters similar to that which is acquired by means of speculation, as we have explained. This is the significance of the phrase, 'I the Lord do make Myself known unto him in a vision.' According to this latter 181 Rd. (1. 25) ישמע for שמע. 182 Literally: by way of an opinion. This translates Ibn Tibbon's על צד המחשבה which, however, according to Munk, is not a fully satisfactory translation of the underlying Arabic עלי גהה אלחדס; cf. Munk, op. cit., II, 345; n. 6. 183 I. e., the opinion that God does not appear addressing the prophet in vision prophecy. 184 The process whereby a person becomes so deeply immersed in thought that he falls asleep is touched on in the commentary to chap. 36. Someone who engages in thought and imagination while in a non-sleeping state, which is what vision prophecy is, may so divert psychic power from his senses that he falls asleep. 185 Moreh Nebhukhim, II, 41. 186 Gen. Rabbah, 17 and 41. 187 The term conceptions translates Ibn Tibbon's השנות .השגות, however, renders the underlying Arabic אתצאלאת, unions, somewhat inaccurately (cf. Munk, op. cit., II, 347; n. 2). The meanings of the two terms in this context are substantially similar.</page><page sequence="45">[45] ABRABANEL ON PROPHECY IN THE MOREH NEBHUKHIM 203 interpretation, there are eight degrees of prophecy, of which the highest and most perfect is that he (the prophet) prophesies generally in a vision, even if, as has been mentioned, a man speaks to him."188 Four comments are presented to this passage. In the first comment, Abrabanel raises a question based upon an interpretation of several sentences in the above passage that differs from the interpretation conventionally given. Conventionally, Maimonides is here understood to say that there are two possible interpretations of Num. 12:6, the verse that serves as a proof-text regarding the appearance of speech in prophecy.189 The first interpretation is that the image of God addressing the prophet does not appear in vision prophecy, although the image of God not speaking or other images speaking may appear in visions. This interpretation is based upon a literal construction of the phrase, "I the Lord do make Myself known unto him in a vision, I do speak with him in a dream"; God is said to disclose Himself in a vision, but to speak only in a dream. Maimonides says, however, that a second, alternative interpretation is possible. Since speech, in this phrase, is mentioned only in connection with dreams, it can be understood to say that no speech at all is heard in vision prophecy, neither from the image of God nor in any other form. This alternative interpretation is offered in the following sentences of the above passage; "When I found texts attesting to speech that the prophets had heard, and it is clear that this took place in a vision, I said, as an opinion, that it is possible that this speech which is heard in a dream and the like of which is not possible in a vision is that which is imagined by him (the prophet) God addresses to him. . . . However, one could say that every vision which is found with the hearing of speech is first of all a vision, and afterward reaches a (state of) deep immersion and becomes a dream"; — it is in the dream that speech is heard. Abrabanel did not see that Maimonides here was offering an alterna tive interpretation, and that in the sentence beginning, "When I found . . .," Maimonides was recapitulating the first interpretation prior to offering his second interpretation. Abrabanel apparently translates the sentences quoted above thusly; "When I found texts attesting to speech that the prophets had heard, I said, as an opinion, that it is possible that this speech which is heard occurred in a dream. The like of it is not possible in a vision, that it should be imagined by him (the prophet) that He speaks to him . . . However, one could say, etc." Once translated in this manner, the passage appears to repeat itself. Hence Abrabanel raises the question if the apparent repetition is actually redundant or whether some new point is presented there. His answer is that Maimonides first made the point that the imagination in vision prophecy will not picture God addressing the prophet. This is due to the strength of the intellect in visions which holds the imagination in rational restraint. The proof for this point is derived from Num. 12:6, where God is described as addressing the 1S8 According to the first or eleven degree classification of prophecy, prophecy in which the image of a man appears speaking to the prophet is of a lower degree than prophecy in which an angel appears speaking. !89 For another discussion of Num. 12:6, see HUCA, Vol. XXXV, pp. 240 ff.</page><page sequence="46">204 ALVIN J. REINES [46] prophet only in dream prophecy. Maimonides then takes up the problem that in spite of this verse the image of God does seem to have addressed speech to prophets in several visions. E. g., in Exodus, God tells Moses that he appeared in visions (19°(1ארא to the Patriarchs, and He evidently spoke to them since He tells Moses what He did not say. Maimonides, therefore, felt that he should take up the question again to explain that the speech referred to in connection with these visions must be understood to have occurred in dreams that followed these visions. As for a vision that seems to depict the image of God addressing a prophet, it should be understood to attribute the prophecy symbolically to God, the remote cause of all events. The figure does not mean God actually appeared in the vision addressing the prophet: What is the new point, beyond that which he has stated above,191 that Maimonides makes here, "(I said, as an opinion), that it is possible that this speech which is heard in a dream and the like of which is imagined by him (the prophet) God addresses to him." For this is the same thing he has stated above is im probable in his opinion, as he says, "As for whether it is possible that a prophet should also appear to see God speaking to him in a prophetic vision, this to me192 is improbable." Moreover he says that "we do not find this state among the other prophets," and if Maimonides gathered this evidence himself,193 how can he now say that he has found verses that attest to it and return to support it again? I say in the first answer: Maimonides first said that despite the fact that in dream (prophecy), owing to the lack therein of regulation of the imagination, its194 madness reaches the point of representing195 the First Cause,196 in vision prophecy, where the imagination is regulated and subdued by the rational faculty, it is improbable there that the imagination should do something foolish like this. In vision prophecy, consequently, the prophets do not imagine [Him], and they do not attribute their prophecies to Him when they represent Him. However, because there are verses that attest the appearance of God to the prophets in vision prophecy, as, e. g., "I appeared unto Abraham, unto 199 Exod. 6:3 וארא according to Maimonides, is the technical term in Scripture that introduces a vision. 191 Probably transpose (1. 27) יתר על מה to after 26 .1) הרב כאן). 192 Rd.

Abrabanel does not always state the qualification that it is the image of God speaking to or addressing addressing the prophet that does not appear in vision prophecy; the image of God otherwise can appear.</page><page sequence="47">[47] ABRABANEL ON PROPHECY IN THE MOREH NEBHUKHIM 205 Isaac, and unto Jacob, as God almighty" (Exod. 6:3); and simi larly, Jacob, for Scripture attests that God appeared to that prophet, and it was in a vision not in a dream,1'7 which con tradicts what he has written, Maimonides resolves it198 by his statement that this took place in a dream, where, as he has said, it is possible. However, it is not possible for a prophet in a vision to imagine God as if speaking to him, for such imagination and representation of the First Cause is what is possible in a dream, not in a vision. Rather, the evidence of the verses is that they attest that that effluence in a vision comes from the First Cause through the proper intermediary, but Scripture does not attest that the prophet frames a representation of the image of God in his imagination. Consequently, what Maimonides declares above to be improbable is that the prophet should represent the First Cause in his imagination, whereas what he says here is that Scriptures attest to his199 attributing prophecy to the First Cause. It does not necessarily follow from this that the prophet represents an image of God. (93V. 26-94r.2:94X. 7-21) The second comment concerns Maimonides' suggestion that it is possible all speech reported in connection with prophetic visions actually took place in prophetic dreams. Hence, e. g., in a prophecy where speech is reported, which clearly begins as a vision, the vision must be understood to fade before speech appears, and a dream prophecy then arises in which the speech appears. In this comment, the question is raised how, if this is so, Maimonides can still offer a systematic classification into dream and vision degrees of the prophecy that appears in Scripture, since vision prophecy will blend into dream prophecy, dream prophecy into vision prophecy, and there will be no way to distinguish between them. Abrabanel's answer is that the situation is not so confused as it first appears. It is the nature of the imagination to increase rather than decrease its activity. Accordingly, since the imagination is weaker in vision prophecy than it is in dream prophecy, and speech is the product of a very intense imagination, we can know that the first part of a prophecy designated by Scripture is always a vision, and that when speech occurs the prophecy has become a dream : Also,200 [a question arises concerning] his statement, "How ever, one could say that every vision which is found with the hearing of speech is first of all a vision, and afterward reaches a (state of) deep immersion and becomes a dream," for what does Maimonides gain by this? Since, if prophecy moves from degree to degree by itself, so that dreams are produced from the "י Gen. 35:9 f1 198 '■ e-&gt; the contradiction. I. e., the prophet's. 200 Rd. (1. 2) וניב for ואיב.</page><page sequence="48">206 ALVIN J. REINES [48] visions, and it201 moves also from the dream to the vision, we cannot know, consequently, the true degrees of prophecy in respect of dream and vision as he sets them down. To the second (question), I say that it is possible for a vision to deepen its immersion and become a dream without conscious ness intervening between them202 inasmuch as in sleep203 the imaginative faculty becomes continually strengthened and moves from a subdued to an intense state in its immersion in the imaginations of its combinations. But it is impossible for a dream to become a vision ; for it204 moves to more intensity, not to less, in its immersion and imagination, neither does it become entirely unimmersed.205 Wherefore should the imagination weaken itself, if consciousness, which would stop that intense dream, does not befall it? Accordingly, therefore, owing to the [tendency to] intensification of the imagination, it is possible for a dream to come from the immersion of the vision, but it206 does not reverse itself, so that a vision can come from the immersion of the dream. For this is contrary to its nature, and does not occur without consciousness intervening between them.207 Therefore, Mai monides says it is possible that "All speech . . . that is heard, however it is heard," i. e., whether by hearing a voice without seeing the speaker, or by seeing a person speaking, or an angel speaking or God speaking, every voice that is heard, always occurs in a dream. For that strong emotion which gives rise to a voice possibly does not occur except in a dream, as Scripture says, "I do speak with him in a dream." But in vision prophecy, no voice would be apprehended, only parables or intellectual appre hensions,208 i. e., parables that the imaginative faculty20' produces, or intellectual apprehensions coming from the rational faculty. (94r. 2-7; 22-29) 201 I. e., the prophecy. 202 I. e., between the vision and the dream. 203 Since even vision prophecy takes place in a not completely conscious state, Abrabanel finds the action of the imagination in sleep analogous to the action of the imagination in prophecy. 204 The antecedent of "it" is properly dream in the preceding clause. However, it might possibly refer back to the imaginative faculty in the preceding sentence. 205 Rd.

Abrabanel explains that this remark should not be taken to mean that the intellectual conceptions of prophecy lead to scientific knowl edge, for they themselves constitute such knowledge; rather Maimonides refers here to the parables of vision prophecy. Although the latter do not in themselves constitute knowledge, they lead to knowledge. The reason Maimonides points this out is that he interprets the phrase, "I the Lord do make Myself known (אתורע) unto him in a vision," as referring to the parables that appear in visions as well as to the intellectual conceptions. However, since the term used to dis cuss the revelation in visions is "make (Myself) known," (אתח־ע from the root ידע, to know,) the question arises in what sense parables, metaphorical and imaginative phantasies, can be understood to be a revelation of knowledge, the literal and explicit propositions of science.210 Maimonides, therefore, explains that the parables which come in vision prophecy lead to a knowledge of science : He (Maimonides) says further, "(in the prophetic vision, only parables or intellectual conceptions) are apprehended that lead to the acquisition of a knowledge of scientific matters similar211 to that which is acquired through speculation." He does not refer back to his statement "or intellectual conceptions"212 in asmuch as the intellectual conceptions are scientific and specula tive matters, but to the parables that he mentions. For inasmuch as Maimonides interprets as referring to this213 the verse that states, "I the Lord do make Myself known (אתודע) unto him in a vision," the objection can be put to Maimonides how it is that parables and not explicit words are called "making oneself known" (התוודעות). Therefore, he says that parables are "making oneself known" (התוודעות) because "they lead to a knowledge of scientific matters." (94r. 29) The fourth comment concerns Maimonides' statement that according to his second interpretation of Num. 12:6, in which speech occurs in dream prophecy alone, there are eight rather than eleven degrees of prophecy. The reason for this, Abrabanel explains, is that the four vision degrees in the eleven degree classification of prophecy were distinguished from one another on the basis of the different kinds of speech that appear in vision prophecy. Con 210 For Maimonides knowledge of God is attained through a knowledge of science. (Cf. the Moreh I, 50; el al.)

REINES [50] sequently, if the appearance of speech is limited only to dream prophecy, then images alone appear in visions, and since all visions possess the same status, there remains only one degree of vision prophecy, which is a general degree of images. As for the superiority of Mosaic prophecy with regard to the eight degree classification of non-Mosaic prophecy, Narboni, explains that Moses can be understood to have heard explicit speech in visions, whereas the ordinary prophets in visions perceived images alone:214 Maimonides then says that, according to this latter inter pretation, the degrees of prophecy in their entirety will be eight, i. e., seven of dream, — these are the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh, as were enumerated, — and the eighth. This (last) is the general degree of vision^ (prophecy) to which more [kinds of prophetic phantasy] will belong because a [vision prophecy] is a "vision" whatever form it may take, even if a person speaks to him,215 which is a lower degree than the others, of the angel (speaking), and of God.216 It may be noted here why Maimonides did not also cite217 the degree of hearing a voice in a vision without seeing the speaker, which is lower than the appearance of a person (speak ing). The answer is that according to this latter interpretation the mere hearing of a voice is itself a dream, as it is said, "I do speak with him in a dream." Therefore, he does not say that it is higher than a dream since it itself is a dream.218 Narboni writes that according to this219 the rank peculiar to Moses, which was above that of all the prophets,220 is that he always prophesied in a vision where he would hear words without dark speeches,221 as is written, "with him do I speak mouth to mouth, in a vision, and not in dark speeches" (Num. 12:8), also it is said, "and He called unto Moses," (Exod. 24:16), and, "then he heard the Voice speaking unto him" (Num. 7:89). (94v. 3) 214 Cf. Narboni, Comm. on the Moreh Nebhukhim, II, 45. 215 I. e., speaks to the prophet. 2161, e., lower in the previous eleven degree classification; here in the eight degree classification they are equal. 217 As an example of a low degree of vision prophecy, since it is the next lowest in the previous classification. 218 I. e., Maimonides did not cite it as a degree of vision prophecy, which is higher than dream prophecy, because it is itself a dream. 2,9 I. e., the other interpretation. Abrabanel's remarks are a paraphrase of Narboni's. 220 Rd. (1. 9) with the text of Narboni: והיא אשר למעלה מכל הנביאים for על כל הנביאים; cf. Narboni, loc. cit. 221 I. e., without obscurity.</page><page sequence="51">[51] ABRABANEL ON PROPHECY IN THE MOREH NEBHUKHIM 209 V. THE SUPERIORITY OF MOSES ACCORDING TO THE SECOND CLASSIFICATION Maimonides concludes his discussion of the eleventh degree with the following passage; "You will perhaps raise an objection against me, saying: You have counted among the degrees of prophecy one where the prophet hears speech from God addressing him, as, e. g., Isaiah and Micaiah. Yet how can this be when our fundamental principle is that every prophet heard speech only through the medium of an angel, except Moses, of whom it is said, 'with him do I speak mouth to mouth' (Num. 12:8)? Know222 that it is in fact so, and the intermediary here is the imaginative faculty; for he223 only hears God speaking to him in a prophetic dream, whereas Moses (heard Him) 'from above the ark-cover, from between the two cherubim' (Exod. 25:22), without making use of the imaginative faculty. We have already explained in the Mishneh TorahTorah the differentia of that kind of prophecy, and we have explained the meaning of 'with him do I speak mouth to mouth' (Num. 12:8) and 'as a man speaketh unto his friend' (Exod. 33:11) and other expressions.224 You can under stand this from there, and there is no need to repeat what has already been said." In the above passage, Maimonides anticipates an objection that can be raised against his notion that every prophet except Moses prophesied by means of an angel, which served as an intermediary between the prophet and God. The possible objection is that if this is so, how can there be such prophecy as the seventh degree, where God appears speaking directly to the prophet. Maimonides answers the anticipated objection somewhat cryptically, "Know that it is in fact so, and the intermediary here is the imaginative faculty." This answer, says Abrabanel, does not appear to resolve the difficulty. The question is how any prophet save Moses can be said to have received prophecy directly from God if Maimonides' opinion is correct that all non-Mosaic prophecy came through an angel. If Maimonides' answer is that the angel is the imagina tion, and consequently, that all prophecy except Moses' came through the imagination, he should have said, "the angel is the imaginative faculty"; in stead he says, "the intermediary here is the imaginative faculty." But this last statement can simply mean that the imagination is the means whereby God appears directly to the prophet, i. e., the faculty that apprehends God directly is the imagination. This does not answer the question that was raised, for the objection is that no prophet should be reported to have received prophecy directly from God if Maimonides' opinion is correct, and it does not matter whether the means whereby this prophecy is received directly is the imagination or the intellect. Moreover, how can Maimonides say at all "the intermediary here is the imaginative faculty," since he has previously stated that the in termediary in prophecy is the Active Intellect. Furthermore, if Maimonides 222 The Arabic underlying the דע of Ibn Tibbon is פלתעלם, "Know then." 223 I. e., the prophet who is not Moses. 224 Cf. Mishneh Torah, Yesode ha-Torah, VII, 6. Also see Abrabanel's comments upon chap. 35, supra■, translated in HUCA, Vol. XXXIV, pp. 195 ff.</page><page sequence="52">210 ALVIN J. REINES [52] by his answer means to indicate the distinction between Moses and the other prophets, how would the fact that the "intermediary here is the imaginative faculty" accomplish this, since Moses, according to Efodi, also prophesied to some degree through his imagination. Abrabanel's answer is that the real objection Maimonides anticipates is: If all vision prophecy belongs to the same general degree, as is the case in the eight degree classification, what will distinguish the prophecy of Moses from other vision prophecy. (In the eleven degree classification, Moses' prophecy can be said to belong to a "twelfth degree," where God speaks to him in a vision.) Maimonides meets this objection by stating that "the intermediary is the imaginative faculty," i. e., the means whereby Moses is superior to the other prophets is the imaginative faculty. The less use made of the imagination, the higher the quality and degree of the prophecy. Thus the distinction between the prophecy of Moses and the other prophets according to the eight degree classification is this: all speech heard in non-Mosaic prophecy is phantasy produced by the imagination, whereas the speech Moses heard in prophecy was real and came to him during conscious ness "from above the ark-cover, from between the two cherubim": The objection Maimonides mentions is how there can be counted among the degrees of prophecy one where, in a dream of the seventh degree, he (the prophet) should appear to see God addressing him, inasmuch as all the prophets except Moses prophesied by means of an angel. If this is so all the prophecies belonged to the sixth degree, that of the angel, not to the seventh, which is of God, seeing that God was not the proximate agent in their prophecy. Maimonides answers that this is in fact so, and that the intermediary is the imaginative faculty, which imagines God as though addressing him, whereas Moses (heard Him) "from above the ark-cover, from between the two cherubim." It must be asked concerning this what Maimonides meant to say here. Is it his opinion that the angel is the imaginative faculty, and Moses prophesied without it, without parable? If so, then why did he not say, "Know that it is in fact so, but the angel is the imaginative faculty." However, he says that the inter mediary is the imaginative faculty, and this the one objecting does not deny. Moreover, what does Maimonides gain by this inasmuch as even Moses prophesied by means of the imaginative faculty "whether little or much,"225 as Efodi226 explains in connection 225 An allusion to Eccles. 5:11. 226 Rd. (1. 16) כסו שפירש אפודי for (כמו שפירשתי (על. Abrabanel does not interpret Maimonides as believing that Moses employed his imagination in prophesying. On the contrary, Abrabanel strenuously attacks Efodi for this interpretation. I have emended the text accordingly. Cf. HUCA, Vol. XXXVI, pp. 145 ff.</page><page sequence="53">[53] ABRABANEL ON PROPHECY IN THE MOREH NEBHUKHIM 211 with the definition of prophecy. Furthermore, as I explained above with respect to the degrees, God is the remote cause of prophecy, and the angel, i. e., the Active Intellect, not the imaginative faculty, is the intermediary therein.227 I say in answer to this that the one objecting asked here: If the appearance and sound of the angel are included generally in the vision inasmuch as it is in its entirety only one degree, as was mentioned, in what way, then, will the prophecy of Moses228 be superior to the prophecy of the rest of the prophets? Since they all prophesied at the degree of the vision, which is one uniform degree and includes them all, what is the pre eminence possessed by Moses over the rest of the prophets? Maimonides' answer to it is "that it is so," i. e., the prophecy of Moses is distinguished above all others in the "excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power" ;22» and "the intermediary"230 whereby the preeminence of prophets over one another occurs is the imaginative faculty; there is the prophet who makes great use of it, and the one who makes little use of it. That faculty is the one that frames the representations and the images. But Moses prophesied "from above the ark-cover, from between the two cherubim." The commentators explained regarding this that "from above the ark-cover"231 is the rational faculty and "the two cherubim"232 are the judgment faculty and the imagination. However, it does not seem to me that Maimonides intended to say any of this except that Moses prophesied while employing his senses, when he was awake and conscious. He would hear the voice coming forth from that holy place, which was not the case as regards the rest of the prophets, for they "were in a deep sleep with their faces toward the ground"233 at the time of prophecy. This shows that his234 prophecy did not take place by means of the imaginative faculty. Maimonides, consequently, continues his remarks with the statement that he has already written explicitly there235 of the differences that exist between them.236 (94v. 11) ד" Cf.
