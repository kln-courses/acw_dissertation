<plain_text><page sequence="1">C. D. Rolfe, Saint-Amant and the Theory of 'Ut Pictura Poesis' (London: The Modern Humanities Research Association, 1972. 113 pp.) AFTER hav- ing been "rediscovered" by Th?ophile Gautier, such poets as Th?ophile de Viau and Saint-Amant, after 1873, seem to have fallen back into relative obscurity. In the way of books on Saint-Amant, we have a German thesis in 1888, a French biography in 1898 and, finally in 1917 another, essentially biographical, study whose title Le Bon Gros Saint-Amant, alas, tells us more than we want to know about its critical perspective. Nothing follows for about thirty years. Then two studies appear after the war, one in 1946, the other in 1947, and again the titles are pretty evocative of the content: Saint-Amant Capitaine du Parnasse and La Vie Amoureuse de M. de Saint-Amant ? ? ? Starting, however, with the 1950's, not only do we find a veritable ef- florescence of works on the "baroque," and particularly on French poetry of the first half of the XVIIth century (Blanchard, Bray, Buffum, Gilman, Leb?gue, Lough, de Mourgues, Raymond, Rousset, Sayce, Winegarten, to mention but a few) but we find many books consecrated to individual poets. On Saint-Amant, for example, there appear from 1955 to the present no fewer than six full-length studies. It is with the latest that we are concerned:</page><page sequence="2">M L N 737 Saint-Amant and the Theory of 'Ut Pictura Poesis' by C. D. Rolfe, published by the Modern Humanities Research Association. This is a small book on a specific aspect of Saint-Amant and it was, as its author tells us, originally undertaken as an M.A. dissertation. It has a rather good bibliography, a few illustrations and a vast amount of quotations. The latter are particularly well chosen and, paradoxically, even though the book itself would seem by its title and subject matter to be restricted to a single aspect of Saint-Amant, the examples turn out to be sufficiently numerous and varied to give a good indication of Saint-Amant's work as a whole. After a general introduction containing a brief history of "Ut Pictura Poesis," Mr. Rolfe turns to specific aspects of Saint-Amant's works, the general relationship of his poetry to painting, then, in succeeding chapters a further breakdown into "landscapes," "the portrayal of movement," "the communication of emotion," and "genre painting." The last chapter deals with Saint-Amant the musician. Now the formula "Ut Pictura Poesis" is one, we know, that has from time immemorial been a basis for literary discussions, and the proliferation of works on this subject has been particularly spectacular in the last decade. In one of its recent issues, for example, New Literary History devoted all ten of its articles to various aspects of this question.1 If nothing less, this suggests that the subject is vast and complex (and has provoked much controversy). Mr. Rolfe's book, despite its title, is not theoretical or ideological, but rather uses the formula "ut pictura poesis" as a way of talking about Saint-Amant's poetry, more specifically its descriptive qualities. There are many ways of applying the formula, but the first that comes to mind is that of a specific relationship between a painter and a poet, that is, of defining the influence of a painting or paintings on the imagination of a writer. This can be all the more fascinating when we realize that a work of art has often replaced a lived experience for the poet or the novelist, that it has, as it were, interposed itself between the viewer and reality, or has at least set into motion a whole set of imagined perceptions, more haunting, more lasting, more suggestive, than personal "actual" memories. Examples from Stendhal to Flaubert, from Baudelaire to Proust immediately come to mind. In the case of Saint-Amant, no clues seem to be given. To be sure, the poet mentions Poussin, but, as Mr. Rolfe points out, the connection seems slim. No other artist readily comes to mind, though the game of analogies or affinities can be played with pleasure, as Mr. Rolfe later does in his chapter on "genre-painting," (for my taste the best chapter in the book). In the course of talking about painting, Mr. Rolfe quotes Saint-Amant in the preface of the Moyse Sauve as having put into his poem "des personnes habiles a la peinture et a la tapisserie . ." and this should remind us, it seems to me, that using only paintings or etchings as a mode of comparison may reduce its scope. Tapestries, and "decorative" (mural and ceiling) paintings should be examined as well in this context. We find, for instance, that Simon Vouet who was a major painter of Saint-Amant's age, had tapestries made of his sketches for an Old Testament series and, in particular, that around 1 New Literary History, Volume III, Number 3, Spring of 1972.</page><page sequence="3">738 M L N 1627 a Finding of Moses was manufactured, whose style would seem much closer to Saint-Amant than, say, Poussin's. The esthetics of tapestry moreover often seem to be better suited to understanding some aspects of "baroque" poetry, not only because of their decorative nature, but because their structural principles differ from those of paintings in several interest- ing ways. Looking at a single tapestry, for example, we find tension between the scene being represented, and the decorative border which may con- tradict or prolong the central theme. Further, a tapestry often has to be viewed as a part of a series in which there exists a rather complex opposition between change (different episodes of the hero's life, different characters, moods, etc., and particularly a sense of evolving time) yet also stability (repeated motifs, similar decorative elements, coordinated colors, etc., which unify both visually and dramatically and seem to negate time). Thus the lack of organizing principle which Mr. Rolfe occasionally finds in Saint-Amant's longer works, or even in single descriptive passages, seem to us rather to be part of a different esthetics, in which design and order may be more complex and more hidden, but are present nevertheless. G. Genette's recent work on Saint-Amant: Structures narratives du Moyse Sauve,2 is precisely an example of literary analysis which could have its counterpart in the world of the plastic arts. Indeed, "pictura ut poesis" suggests a second element of comparison, one which might be called the "painterly qualities" of a poet. These do not merely refer to his descriptive talent, or even to the "pittoresque" elements in his writings, but necessitate a comparison of organizing principles and structural elements. One such element is the representation of time and movement, of the cinematographic as opposed to the photographic. One of the important visual elements here is juxtaposition and sequence. We have already men- tioned tapestries seen as a series or decorative paintings which, while in a single room and therefore unified from the visual and plastic point of view, nevertheless by depicting a variety of "scenes," reflect moods, different times, change even. The same can be said of certain poems of Saint-Amant's. Though he analyzes certain aspects of movement (the sea, ships, battles and monsters) with a good eye, Mr. Rolfe complains (p. 35) that Saint-Amant occasionally "spoils the overall effect of his poem through his inability to move in a convincing manner from one scene to the next: the repetition... of 'l' and 'tantost' becomes tedious." Yet one could argue that this characteristic "baroque" device (and a favorite of Saint-Amant's) has the effect of multiplying both the visual ("l," "la") and the temporal ("tantost," "tantost"). In the former case we cannot help but think of the "scenes multiples" of Bosch and even more of Breughel. In their paintings too we are simultaneously drawn along the stronger lines of the composition, yet aware of the multiple (and therefore visually distracting) elements. Further, time and space are deliberately confused by the painter as they are by the poet. La Pluye is a good example of this painterly trait. Here, the poet is looking out of his friend's house, and the frame of the window is very much like the frame of a painting: 2 Cahiers du Centre International de Synthese du Baroque, 3, (1969), 35-47.</page><page sequence="4">M L N 739 Regarde a l'abry des ces saules Un pelerin qui se tapit: Le degoust perce ses espaules, Mais il n'en a point de depit. Contemple un peu dans cette allee Thibaut, a la mine haslee, Marcher froidement par compas: Le bonhomme sent telle joye, Qu'encore que cette eau le noye, Si ne s'en ostera-t-il pas. Voy de la dans cette campagne Ces vignerons, tous transportez, Sauter comme genets d'Espagne, Se demenans de tous costez; Entens d'icy tes domestiques Entrecouper leurs chants rustiques D'un frequent battement de mains; Tous les coeurs s'en espanouissent, Et les bestes s'en resjouyssent Aussi bien comme les humains. If we now take as another point of comparison the four sonnets dedicated to the seasons, we again find elements that are painterly: organization, strong vertical or horizontal lines, deliberate arrangement of elements, pyramidal effects, etc., which give these landscapes very special qualities. In L'Automne, for example, the line between landscape and still life is an ambiguous one, and the Canaries are depicted almost as if they were a giant Cornucopia; L'Hiver, on the other hand, has a teasing anthropomorphic quality which may remind us of Giuseppe Alcimboldo's3 playful, yet occa- sionally disquieting, landscapes or portraits made of fruits and flowers or minerals. Here we come upon a new element: not only transformation and ambiguity so often mentioned by writers on the baroque, but a curious opposition between close observation and the visionary, between the realis- tic and the surrealistic and, in the long run, between the merely representa- tive and the symbolic. It is here perhaps that Mr. Rolfe's book seems either too deliberately modest or too limited. When, talking about such poems as Le Melon, Le Fromage, etc., Mr. Rolfe says: "the excellent still-lifes in which he has immortalized melons, hams, cheeses, and wines tell us not only what they looked like but also how they tasted and smelt," we can only wish more had been said than that other senses have been brought into play. For this kind of poem (with its very real appeal to the senses, to be sure) also has particular artistic qualities of organization and gradation and order, just as still-life paintings are not merely bunches of fruits or vegetables. Moreover, a still-life painting and this kind of poem dedicated apparently only to the world of the senses have also 3 And his Italian, French, and Dutch imitators.</page><page sequence="5">740 M L N intellectual and ethical intentions attached to their physical elements. The traditions in poetry which give us, for example, La Salade of Ronsard, or in painting, XVIth and XVIIth century still lifes with proverbial or philosophical connotations (the vanitas paintings, for example) are, to a degree, parallel ones.4 In a somewhat different direction, we can note some common charac- teristic of a dramatic or symbolic sort which prolong and complicate both the poem and the painting, when descriptive scenes themselves contain other (and apparently unrelated) descriptive elements. A device often found in paintings of Dutch interiors, for example is the presence in the background of a tapestry or a painting. The effect may be an ironic com- mentary on the principal scene being depicted, or it may have psychological or dramatic overtones (a young woman reads a letter while on a wall behind her hangs the portrait of a man), or heighten the mood and atmosphere of the scene by evoking distant contrasts (a serene interior, quietly glowing in sunlight, while on the wall hangs a scene of shipwreck). In the literary work too, such intrusion of artifice into the "real world" can be far more than a decorative device or a chance for virtuoso performance. Thus Mr. Rolfe's comment that the tapestry depicting the Flood which appears in the Moyse Sauve is merely "an opportunity [for Saint-Amant] to make use of his gift for evoking visual images" seems somewhat limiting, given the role that the Flood plays in Saint-Amant's work as a whole, and particularly in his biblical poems, and given the contrasting mood of the poem at the very moment in which he situates that description. We are reminded, rather, of the brilliant use which d'Urf6 makes of the description of paintings in the first tome of L'Astree, when Celadon awakes at the Chateau of Isoure and sees on the walls extraordinary paintings depicting with great realism, indeed naturalism, scenes of violence and horror. The intrusion (but in a carefully delimited and controlled manner) of extrane- ous and totally different elements into the world of the Lignon has the same effect as the evocation of the cataclysmic Flood (on canvas) on the tranquil banks of the Nile, and it serves the same artistic functions. Not the least elements common to these two examples is that of juxtaposition and con- trast between the apparent serenity of the viewer and the violence and chaos portrayed in the object viewed. Saint-Amant is a visionary poet in that sense too. Thus, when Mr. Rolfe says: "Generally speaking, poet and painter preferred serene landscapes with rivers, small woods and vales. The wilder aspects of nature - storms, hostile climates, awe inspiring mountains and so forth - were usually shunned, as was agriculture," we cannot agree if the statement is meant to apply to Saint-Amant. For what is striking, precisely, 4 See, for example, Marcel Brion's L'Age d'or de la peinture hollandaise, Bruxelles, 1964, particularly chapter III: "Les choses comme etres et comme symboles." We might also note that many painters (Breughel for one) are actually illustrating proverbs while depicting apparently realistic scenes.</page><page sequence="6">M L N 741 about a poem like La Solitude is the tension which exists between landscape in which the poet finds himself (the edge of a wood, a sunny spot overlooking the sea) and the landscape he views (the restless and disquieting sea). Further, not only is his pleasure multiplied by his ideal situation which allows him simultaneously to belong to two worlds, to feel safe yet, vicariously, live through excitement and adventure (Baudelaire will have the same feeling sitting at the terrace of a cafe on the edge of a bustling boulevard) but his present view of the sea is overladen by a vision of monsters and shipwrecks, thus bringing both the past and the future to invade the present scene.5 On the whole, then, our principal reproach of Mr. Rolfe's careful study is that, while he rightly points out many of Saint-Amant's descriptive talents, he nevertheless overly limits the scope of his work. Moreover hejudges him, at times, from an esthetic point of view which is not Saint-Amant's own. Thus, chastising Saint-Amant for "allow[ing] his imagination to run riot," (p. 21) or complaining about aspects of the work which are "starkly grue- some . . . grotesquely preposterous and faintly reminiscent of those more ludicrous battle scenes in La Chanson de Roland" (p. 35) or again (p. 59) commenting that "Saint-Amant could have allied a few details more suited to the subject to a more general approach and, in so doing, rendered the whole far more satisfactory both artistically and logically," all seem to be ways of looking at Saint-Amant from the point of view of classical esthetics (Poussin would be tolerated, but not Breughel, still less Alcimboldo!). Not surprisingly, when judging the passage in the Moyse. Sauve which depicts the crossing of the Red Sea, Mr. Rolfe aligns himself with Boileau's derogatory judgment. Where we can agree with Mr. Rolfe more readily is when he suggests that Saint-Amant lacks a certain epic "souffle" His talent lies in a rather different direction: the exquisite tautness and density of the well wrought. Gautier's predilection in L'Art for the mineral world, "Vers, marbre, onyx, email," does indeed come to mind. What we cannot forget, however, is the visionary poet, for whom the dream, the hazy, the surreal are as important as the exact, the observed, the real. In Le Paresseux, for example, the poet's strategy is deceptive. Seemingly nonchalant, casual, inactive even, he is in fact exercising great care and watchfulness. Like the Ronsard of the Premiere Ode d la Fontaine Bellerie, the poet surrounded by all the emblems of activity and labeur, yet who says about himself L'6et je dors ou repose Sur ton herbe, ou je compose, Cache sous tes saules verts, Je ne sais quoi . . . 5 Here again G. Genette's work is particularly useful: see his "L'Univers reversible de Saint-Amant" in Lettres Nouvelles, December 30, 1959, pp. 51-55.</page><page sequence="7">742 M L N Saint-Amant too feigns sleep. Thus the word oisivete like its Latin predeces- sor suggests not inactivity but a time beyond routine, a time not of rest but of creativity: Accable de paresse et de melancholie, Je resve dans un lict ou je suis fagote Comme un lievre sans os qui dort dans un paste, Ou comme un Dom-Quichot en sa morne folie. La, sans me soucier des guerres d'Italie, Du comte Palatin, ny de sa royaute, Je consacre un bel hymne a cette oisivete Ou mon ame en langueur est comme ensevelie. Je trouve ce plaisir si doux et si charmant, Queje croy que les biens me viendront en dormant, Puis que je voy des-ja s'en enfler ma bedaine, Et hay tant le travail, que, les yeux entr'ouvers, Une main hors des draps, cher BADOIN, a peine Ay-je p6 me resoudre a t'escrire ces vers. The negative recall of far away unpleasant realities ("sans me soucier de") emphasizes the poet's refusal to be pulled away from his work, except in his imagination. His repos is intensified and made "doux et charmant" because of the recall of frenetic activities. At the center of his world, apparently deeply ensconced in his bed (or his folie, or his langueur), the poet seems motionless, not to say vaguely foolish and ineffectual. Yet, at the same time, we are aware that the canvas before us is slowly filling out, that a picture is emerg- ing. Shall we entitle it "Le bon gros Saint-Amant," or "Le poete qui dort," or, more emblematically, and using Saint-Amant's own title, "Le Paresseux"? Indeed the painting may be nothing more than a nature morte in which the subject of the poem has been transformed into a mere object ("comme un lievre sans os qui dort dans un paste"). But, in the long run, this is not quite true, the lievre is merely asleep, the poet has "les yeux entr'ouvers" and all the while, the gestation of the poem has taken place ('je voy desjd s'en enflerma bedaine"). The object of the painting was also the painter-poet who was all along working on his own portrait. As we look at the finished work, we catch sight of the painter's hand coming out of the canvas itself and, upon it, affixing his signature. Cornell University ALAIN SEZNEC</page></plain_text>
