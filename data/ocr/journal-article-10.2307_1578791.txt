<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE RISE OF ISLAMIC PHILOSOPHY by Richard Walzer (A paper read to a group of medieval historians at Oxford in the summer of I949) 1. To the memory of Michelangelo Guidi Greek philosophy is not found in Arabic dress before the first half of the ninth century, during the Califate of the Abbasids. The Abbasids had transferred the capital of the Muslim empire from Damascus to the newly founded city of Baghdad, and it was there that the two islamic philosophers with whom I propose here to deal spent the greater part of their lives, Yacqiib son of Ishaq a- K i n d i and Abu Nasr a l-Fa r b . The former of these, who died shortly after A.D. 870, witnessed the reign of the great caliphs al-Ma'miun (813-833) and al-MuCtasim (833-842), a period marked both by the power of the Abbasid Caliphate in the realm of politics, which was then at its height, and by a vigorous artistic and intellectual life. He was thus an older contemporary of the Greek patriarch Photius, who once came as an ambassador to the border of the Muslim Empire 2, and of the Irish philosopher Eriugena (John the Scot), who was the first to introduce Neoplatonic thought into the far west 3. The schoolmen were acquainted with 1 Cf. P. J. de Menasce O.P., Arabische Philosophie, Bibliographische Einfiihrungen in das Studium der Philosophie, herausgegeben von I. M.

Al-Farabi, who was born about the time of al-Kindi's death, and died about A.D. 950, was of Turkish origin like the oody guard of the Caliphs from al-MuCtasim onwards 4a; he, too, was known to the Latin Middle Ages, under the name of AlFarabius, and was used, for example, by Gundisalvi 5. We see thus that both he and al- Kindi were considerably earlier than Avicenna (980-1037) and Averroes (II26-II98), who were the two Arabic philosophers most widely known irt the West, and who are, for instance, found mentioned, along with the philosophers of ancient Greece, in the Divina Commedia ; they stand as representatives of two contrasted types of Islamic philosophy, and so far as we know they were the first to establish them both. To speak of "Islamic philosophy" may seem at first a contradiction in terms; philosophy was at home in ancient Greece, bound by close ties with the Greek way of life and with Greek religion, but Islam is a faith set in the Judaeo-Christian mould, based on a sacred book, the Qur'an, which is invested with a divine authority no product of the Greek tradition ever enjoyed and determines in virtue of this the belief and conduct of every Muslim. It takes its stand entirely on divine revelation, and a Muslim's con- victions are convictions of faith, whereas the philosophers of Greece, with a few rare exceptions t( be mentioned later, consistently maintained the primacy of reason 7. Nevertheless it was not in al-Kindi and al-Farabi that the Greek tradition and the Hebraic, natural theology and sacred scriptures, met for the first 4 A.

The clash between Greek thought and Christian, on the other hand, led to a permanent connexion between the two, rendered all the easier by the predominance of metaphysical and transcendental elements in the philosophy of Plotinus and his successors. In this case, unlike that of the Jews and of the Arabs, no linguistic difficulty was involved, the Old Testament being studied in the Septuagint version which Judaism had in the end rejected; while on the other hand Christianity had this in common with Mohammedanism, that they were both universal religions recognising no national boundaries. This naturalization of Greek thought within the Christian Church took two forms which it is important for us to note if we are to understand the background of Islamic theology (the so-called kalam) and philosophy. The first of these is the patristic theology which took its definite shape in the fourth century in the works of such men as St. Basil and Gregory Nazianzen in the East or St. Augustine in the West, borrowing mainly from the Platonic and Stoic schools and seeking to make the faith rationally intelligible without undermining its supernatural character; its motto was, in the words used later by St. Anselm, credo ut intelligam. The second, not less important, was the reception of the philosophical syllabus as found in the schools of Athens, Constantinople, Antioch and Alexandria, a tradition which lasted without a break from the time of Aristotle to the Muslim conquests, and on further through the first two centuries of Muslim rule. This reception, which took place about the middle of the fifth century, was at the time of the Muslim invasions an accomplished fact in the two Syriac churches, the Nestorian' and the Jacobite, as well as in the Greek; at this period the philosophical syllabus comprised the lecture-courses or treatises of Aristotle, expounded by commentators from the second century onwards, selected works of Plato (the selection differing in different schools), and the metaphysics of Neopla- tonism, this again studied in different writers according to the preference of individual teachers. It is one of the distinctive features of Islamic philos- ophy, as represented in al-Kindi and al-Farabi, Avicenna and Averroes, 8 For the term Chellenistic&amp; cf. A.

I shall now draw these introductory remarks to a close by seeking to justify the attempt to delineate Islamic philosophy in the period of its rise. That it became part of the tradition of the West was due mainly to the extensive translation of works of Avicenna and Averroes, men who were not, as were al-Fiarbi and al-Kindi, the originators of the new movement in philosophy and religion, and so medievalists have been mainly interested in these later thinkers as providing the immediate Arabic background of medieval philosophy. They have been less interested in the process which made Avicenna and Averroes possible, in their Islamic affiliations and the manner in which they drew upon that phase of ancient philosophy which immediately preceded the rise of Islamic. But Islamic philosophy, apart from its claim to be understood on its own account, deserves consideration as part of the legacy of Greece, as an important link in that chain of civili- zation which comes to us from Hellenic antiquity. It was the uninterrupted study of Greek philosophy which guaranteed the continuity of that chain; Homer and Aeschylus were of minor importance, at least outside the ever- narrowing boundaries of the Byzantine Empire, whereas Greek philosophy never died out; at the time when interest in it was low in the Latin West, it was intensively studied in the Islamic world and adapted there to a new setting. I. YaCqiub son of Ishaq a l-K i n d i, who first introduced this Aristotelian- Neoplatonic philosophy into the Islamic world, was an Arab of noble descent. He was born in the Mesopotamian city of Basra, whose life had been deeply influenced by Jundi Shapur, a celebrated centre of Persian learning nearby which was a meeting-place of Hellenic, Persian and Indian influences. Al- Kindi's father held a high position as governor of Kiufa, the other early Arabian city of Mesopotamia, and the son was evidently appreciated as a philosopher at the court of Baghdad, for important works of his are addressed to the great Caliph al-Ma'min and his successor al-MuCtasim, the 9 Cf.

The distinguished position he enjoyed is unique in the annals of Islamic philosophy, and can only be explained on the assumption that he shared the form of Mohamme- dan theology fostered and supported by the rulers he served. The Caliph, as the prophet's successor, was the leader of a theocratic way of life as well as the political ruler of a vast empire, and al-Kindi's princely protectors entertained very decided religious views which they enforced upon their subjects with all the means at the disposal of absolute rulers, identifying themselves with the so-called MuCtazila, then a living force and not (what it later became) merely one sect among others. These Muctazilites were champions of a reasonable creed against anthropomorphism and literalism on the one hand, and of an essentially religious standpoint against scepticism and unbelief on the other, standing out therefore as rational theologians by contrast with the non-rational, fideist attitude of theological orthodoxy, which was in disgrace in al-Kindi's day 10. The facts of his life and the titles of his numerous works (now mostly lost) 11 have always led scholars to assume that al-Kindi shared the Muctazi- lite standpoint and set himself to work out a place for philosophy within its theological framework. Incidentally the MuCtazila itself was deeply in- fluenced by Greek ideas and Greek methods of argument. On this point the recent discovery in Istanbul of an important manuscript of al-Kindi has converted likelihood into a matter of certainty. And so in al-Kindi we find a balance unique in early Islam between an 'advanced' theology, based on reasoned interpretation of revelation, and a philosophy which aimed at utilizing the totality of our obviously limited human faculties in the under- standing of God, the universe and man himself. That in this task he drew on the Greek philosophical tradition, and showed a considerable measure of success in its assimilation although he was the first to make the attempt, is a fact that needs to be stressed, and in this connexion it would be in- 10 Cf. recently H.

But if our ultimate aim is a complete understanding of the status Greek philosophy held in these foreign surroundings, the immediate question on which we have to concentrate our attention is this: "What was it that al-Kindi had in view when he introduced philosophy into the theolog- ical framework of the Muctazila, and where did he draw the dividing-line between philosophy and theology?" In attempting to answer this question I shall draw upon three of his works, the first a short introduction to Aristotle surveying the contents of his treatises or, more probably, of summaries from them 12. The second, addressed to the Caliph al-MuCtasim, is entitled First Philosophy or Meta- physics, and demonstrates the existence of God in a Neoplatonic fashion, opening with a remarkable preface which explains the principles on which the treatise is based 13. Only the first half of this work has come -down to us, Part II, in which he arrived at the same conclusions from a Muctazilite interpretation of the Qur'an, having apparently disappeared14; but the loss of this is compensated by the existence of another work, an Epistle addressed to the son of al-Muctasim whose tutor he was. Here he pointed out that a verse of the Quran asserting that the stars worship God was in full accord with the Neoplatonic form of Greek astral theology, Greek metaphysics since the time of Plato and Aristotle having based itself on the regular and unchanging revolution of the heavenly bodies and the divine nature which this indicated in them 15. The first of these three treatises, that on Aristotle, shows us at once what is new in al-Kindi if only we compare it with the philosophy of ancient Greece. He gives a survey of the normal Aristotelian syllabus of a Neopla- tonic school of the Athenian type, such as may well have been in use in the first half of the fifth century and so taken over by Nestorian Christian philosophers or theologians, from Antioch for example, driven by the Greek 12 M.

But, rather surprisingly at first sight, he includes in this survey a long excursus on the difference be- tween human knowledge and divine, between the toilsome enquiries of the philosopher and the intuitive insight of the prophet. "Ordinary mankind" he says, "are by nature incapable of such knowledge, all matters of this type being beyond their capacities and efforts; all they can do is submit with docile obedience, professing faith in the revelations of the prophets" 16. In many cases, according to al-Kindi, philosophy and revelation arrive at the same result, though in different ways, but there are certain fundamental tenets of faith which are not rationally demonstrable and are guaranteed by scripture, prophecy and revealed religion alone; in the section just quoted he discusses two, common to Christianity and Islam, which presented all but insuperable difficulties to the Greek mind-the resurrection of the body on the Day of Judgment and the creation of the world from nothing in a single moment of time by the omnipotent will of God. That the world should come from nothing was irreconcilable with a constantly repeated axiom of Greek thought, and could be demonstrated by Scripture alone, by the word of God himself as found in the Qur'an. Greek philosophy had attempted rational demonstration of the immortality of man's soul, a doctrine main- tained by Plato and the Neoplatonists and, in his earlier years, by Aristotle, but the resurrection of the dead in bodily form was never considered by the philosophers of Greece as even a remote possibility; it was a conception utterly inconceivable to the Greek philosophical mind. It could thus be accepted as a miracle alone, as exponded in the 36th Sura of the Qur'an, to which al-Kindi refers as a particularly striking example of prophetic in- spiration. This Qur'anic saying al-Kindi could interpret in the same manner as the Muctazilites, amplifying it with philosophical arguments which lent it an added probability, but he made no attempt to give a stringent demon- stration of the creation of the world from nothing and the resurrection of the flesh 17. Here, however, we have an extreme case, and it is only when fundamental issues of this character are involved that al-Kindi appears as a theologian of the type of St. Basil-or, as he would perhaps put it, whenever revelation unlocked the door to a domain of reality to which Greek philosophy had not provided the key. Elsewhere, as for example in his Metaphysics and in 16 Studi su al-Kindi I cap. VI ? 2. 17 Studi su al-Kindi I cap.

He had, however, to change it in a small but not unimportant detail. The highest sphere of the heavens, that which comes next after God, who is the first cause of the universe as its unmoved mover and the inexhaustible source of emanation, is the proximate cause of life in the sublunar world, i.e. on the earth. But the universe was, on the view of Aristotle and the Neoplato- nists, eternal and uncreated, and, if al-Kindi's aim was to harmonize philos- ophy with Islamic theology as the Muctazilites understood it, he needed to transform this latter in a small though important detail. He may have had a Christian predecessor here, but if so the fact in no way affects the result. The highest sphere of the heavens, according to al-Kindi, having once been created from nothing by God, will last as long as God so wills; it is obedient to God's decree, and on it the other regions of the world depend, as the philosophers have explained. Once it perishes, the remainder of the universe will perish too, since the divine energy will no longer be transmitted to the lower strata. Within these limits, therefore, philosophy helps towards a more adequate understanding of reality, but it never in al-Kindi contradicts the established theology of his day; for him, therefore, philosophy is the handmaid of theol- ogy and of divine revelation, nowhere claiming a predominance over the latter. Al-Farabi on the contrary, as we shall see, represents an attitude diametrically opposed; first and foremost a philosopher, he stresses the primacy of reason over the symbolic expressions of revealed religion. But al- Kindi's description of the supreme being in purely negative terms is in full agreement with the mode in which the MuCtazilites speak of Him, and so he makes no claim to achieve by means of Greek philosophy anything beyond what the traditionalists and Muctazilites had previously attempted, viz. a profounder understanding of the fundamental principles of the Muslim faith. He does, however, claim, not without justification, that his new approach is superior to anything tried before, and having once been in- troduced will henceforward be indispensable. In the preface to his Metaphysics al-Kindi explains why he needs to have recourse to Greek philosophy, though it is of foreign origin and no part of 8</page><page sequence="9">The Rise of Islamic Philosophy Muhammad's revelation. In view of the brevity of human life one cannot afford to neglect the achievements of previous thinkers simply because they were of a different race and creed. "We should not, then, be ashamed to recognise truth and assimilate it, from whatever quarter it may reach us, even though it may come from earlier generations and foreign peoples. For the seeker after truth there is nothing of more value than truth itself; it never cheapens or debases the seeker, but ennobles and elevates him" 18. Philosophy seems thus to amount simply to a gradual accumulation of truths already accepted, to which later generations can hope to do no more than provide minor corrections and additions. But, as we have already seen, al-Kindi is at the same time aware that every fresh thinker who sifts the accumulated store of truth may see it in a new light and approach it with new questions in his mind arising out of his own experience of life. He expresses himself thus: "We must, then, remain faithful to the principle we have followed in all our works, which is first to quote in full what the ancients have said on any subject and then to fill in what they have not fully expressed, and this according to the usage of the Arabic language, the customs of our age, and our individual ability" 19. It was this attitude of mind which made him not an epigonus of later Greek philosophy but the first philosopher of Islam, the philosopher of the Muctazilite theology, con- vinced that faith and reason, theology and philosophy, were to be synthesized, the latter confirming the tenets of faith and deepening the world-view trans- mitted to us by the intuitive insight of the prophets. Against orthodox literalism he urges that, while the prophet has an apostolic mission and the truth of his message is indisputable, once the prospect of philosophy has been opened before them men are bound to philosophize and cannot shirk the issue. This argument comes from the lost Protrepticus of Aristotle, a work imitated in the Hortensius of Cicero, which deeply influenced the religious development of St. Augustine; it was an argument employed in similar circumstances by Clement of Alexandria in the second century A.D. 21. "They must declare the attainment of philosoph- ical knowledge either necessary or unnecessary; if they say it is necessary, they must agree to go in search of it; if not necessary, they must offer 18 Bulletin of the John Rylands Library (cf. above p. 2 no. 6) p. 172 ff. p. 8I Ahwani. 19 p. 81,5 ff.

But to give reasons and arguments involves one in the attainment of philosophical knowledge in its essential truth, and hence the attainment of philosophical knowledge is necessary and obligatory for them also" 22. It is scarcely surprising that we are indebted to al-Kindi, as to many other Arabic philosophers, for new material for the history of Greek philos- ophy. The arguments he uses are not always to be traced in such Neopla- tonic works as we possess in the original Greek, and so add to our knowledge of Neoplatonism, and treatises on the soul on Neoplatonic lines have yielded two new fragments of a lost dialogue of Aristotle, the Eudemus, written at the period when he still adhered to Plato's theory of the immortality of the soul 23. He arranged for a translation, for the benefit of his royal pupil, of the so-called Theology of Aristotle, which, going back ultimately to some highly competent paraphrase of the philosophical essays of Plotinus, repre- sents the only remnant we possess of an ancient commentary on him and deserves to be much better appreciated by his readers 24. To ask for al-Kindi's sources is certainly legitimate, for he always insists that the substance of his arguments is Greek and that he has only changed them when specifically Islamic issues are involved. His philosophy was based on Aristotelianism as developed by the Neoplatonists, who stressed the Platonic element in the Platonic-Aristotelian tradition and were particu- larly concerned to prove how God governed the world as its First Cause and guaranteed its existence. But we should like to know further whether al-Kindi can be connected with any particular Neoplatonic school, for, though they may appear more or less alike from a distance, they had, it is recognized, individual features of their own. Conclusions must be provisional until all the available evidence has been closely examined, but the examination of small details appears to point ;to one particular quarter as that which in- fluenced al-Kindi, one to which more general considerations would them- selves incline the enquirer to turn. The school in question is the Neoplatonic of the first half of the fifth century, which had taken on a specific colouring under the influence of lamblichus, the contemporary of Constantine the Great; here alone in the 22 p. 82,13 ff.

In the present state of research it appears probable that Nestorian philosophers from Antioch, deriving from a Neoplatonic tradition close to the Athenian pattern, carried it with them when they were expelled from the Byzantine empire and found refuge in Persia. This later system-a bizarre one to the eyes of the classical scholar-they may have adapted to their own needs by substituting the Old and New Testaments for the outlandish authorities of the Neoplatonists, while maintaining the same relations between faith and reason as their predecessors. Al-Kindi in his turn may then be thought of as having sub- stituted Muhammad and the Qur'an for St. Paul and the Bible, adhering in other respects to the Neoplatonic scheme, which may have undergone some decline or, at any rate, simplification during the three centuries which elapsed between the end of the Athenian school and the foundation of the Abbasid empire 25. II. The pattern of al-Kindi's philosophy, welcome as it might appear to a Muslim mind such as that of al-Ghazali, is very unusual in Greek thought. But what is it that happens when a Muslim philosopher tries to naturalize, within an Islamic civilization, a philosophy of the Greek pattern, which is more familiar to us? This is the first new feature which we notice in al-Far abi, the feature which distinguishes him sharply from his pre- decessor, producing a very different set of relationships between religion and philosophy and one more closely akin to that suggested by the title of a lost work of Strato, On the royal position of philosophy, IIpl p .aAXeoiaC pLXoo0(p0ocq 26. To understand al-Farabi's background let us consider for a moment this type of philosophy, which is that represented by Plato, Aristotle and the Stoics. Here there is no revelation to be held in awe; philosophy moulds the tradition, refining and reshaping it constantly, itself the highest and most spiritual form of Greek religion once we mark off the religion of the mind from the customary observance of public worship.

In a philosophical system of this kind traditional religion is valued either for utilitarian reasons or as providing a symbolical approach to a truth which can be properly grasped by the mind of the philosopher alone, and so Plato and others after him set their hand to schemes of education and legislation on a large scale, trying to mould the lives of the non-philosophers in accordance with the philosophical insight they had attained. Plato in his old age dealt in the Phaedrus with rhetoric as the art of conveying philosophical truth to unphilosophical minds, and made in the Laws his most elaborate attempt to lay down a code of behaviour and formulate the institutions of an ethical society based on the new religion of the mind which he had constructed; he was by no means satisfied with having simply established the inner freedom and independence of the individual philosopher and his claim to rule the state. This aspect of Platonism survived the breakdown of the Greek city-state, and we meet it again in, for instance, the De Republica of Cicero 27 or in Eusebius' Outline of the Duties of a Christian Emperor 28. We have every reason for thinking that it was also transmitted through the Greek schools down to the establishment of Islamic civilization, though rejected by Plotinus and the Neoplatonic school of Athens, who emphasized and refined upon the transcendental and mystical side of Plato 29. Recent discoveries of hitherto unknown texts of al-Farabi 30 have proved that it was from this interpretation of Plato that he started openly; the kind of philosophy he aimed at establishing was not based simply on the primacy of reason, but 27 54-5I B.C. 28 N.

That in this he was inspired by Plato is evident; this Greek tradition had reached the Muslim world before al-Farabi's day, and by the time of his birth there existed complete Arabic translations or summaries not only of the Timaeus, which was held in esteem in the Western world too, but also of the Republic and Laws, which remained there completely unknown. His immediate teachers were not Nestorian Christians, as were al-Kindi's, but Jacobites, tracing back their descent to the Neoplatonic school of Alexandria, not to that of Athens 31). But this different attitude which we find in al-Farabi to the relations between philosophy and religion, and similarly his interest in the ideal ruler, had their roots in genuine Islamic problems as well, and it may have been they which opened his eyes to the type of philosophy just mentioned. The question who was the legitimate heir of the prophet, as at the same time the political leader and the religious, had been a burning one in the Islamic world from the very beginning without ever being finally settled. Al-Kindi had lived at the zenith of the Abbasid caliphate, in an atmosphere markedly favourable to his philosophical activities and under rulers who not merely tolerated but actively supported the influx of Greek philosophy and science. But since then there had been a change; the Muctazilite theo- logians were now considered a dangerous element, already in al-Kindi's old age the philosophers had fallen into disgrace under the caliphate of al-Mu- tawakkil (847-861), and now and in al-Farabi's day the caliphs, identifying themselves with a strictly orthodox interpretation of Islam, viewed philos- ophy with mistrust. Al-Farabi was a younger contemporary of al-AshCari, the founder of orthodox Muslim theology 32, and lived at the time of the steady decline of the Abbasids. It is this state of affairs which lies behind a statement, made apparently in a completely detached and objective manner, to be found in his last work, that on the ideal state: "If at a given time it should happen that wisdom (i.e. philosophy) has no share in the government, 31 Cf. M. Meyerhof, Von Alexandrien nach Bagdad, Sitzungsberichte der Preuss. Akad., phil.-hist. Klasse, I930, p. 405 (19) ff. 3 Cf, e.g., H. A. R. Gibb, Mohammedanism (Oxford I949) p. II6ff. I3</page><page sequence="14">Richard Walzer though every other qualification for rule may be present, the ideal state will remain rulerless, the actual head of the state will be no true king, and the state will head for destruction; and if no wise man is to be found and associated with the acting head of the state, then after a certain interval the state will undoubtedly perish" 33. It is worthy of notice that Plato had made the same challenge to Athens during the decline of the Greek city-state, and that Cicero had renewed the demand for a philosopher-ruler during the supreme crisis of the Roman republic; it is in periods when the established political forms are in decay that Plato's view has again and again been put forward. Al-Farabi did not belong to the ruling class. A poor man, he had few material needs and lived the life of an ascetic. He makes it clear that he had to hide his views so far as they concerned the religious questions of his day, but nevertheless he did not choose to express himself in allegorical or otherwise enigmatic language. His intention is that we shall understand his philosophical treatises as they stand, guessing their application for our- selves 34, but he is very sparing in his hints and thus it is often difficult to understand the way in which he wished his writing and teaching to influence the Islamic world; it was not for him to express his allegiance to definite political or religious groups as openly as had al-Kindi. Eventually he left Baghdad, whether of his own accord or under compulsion, and passed the last years of his life at the court of a famous ruler of Aleppo, Saif-ad-Daula, who was in his politics and on the question of the true caliph an opponent of the prophet's recognised successor 35. We must try first to understand how al-Farabi, in a manner very different from that of al-Kindi, tried to assign to philosophy a dominating position in the Islamic world, doing so without hostility to Islam and without ceasing to be a devout Muslim himself. Like al-Kindi he believed that philosophy alone would enable Islam to reach its perfection and fulfil its highest destiny, but his formula turns out to be quite new, and as original in its way as that advocated by his predecessor. At the end of his De beatitudine assequenda al-Farabi makes the following pronouncement: "Philosophy has come down to us from the Greeks, from Plato and Aristotle, both of whom have given us not merely the results of 33 Der Musterstaat (cf. above p. 12 n. 30) p. 6i, I ff. 34 Cf. the preface of his Summary of Plato's Laws (below p. 19 n. 47).

He does not, like his predecessor, claim simply to be following the Greeks; he goes on to assert that Greek philosophy is in complete decay in its native home and that he himself is about to revive it in the Islamic world. It had indeed, he claims elsewhere 37, had its ultimate origin among the Chaldaeans, at the centre of the Abbasid empire of his day, whence it passed to Egypt, to be handed down from the Egyptians to the Greeks, who were the first to produce a written philosophy; from the Greeks it passed to the Syrians and thence to the Arabs, and thus, after a long exile, it has returned to its native land, to be restored there to its former glory by al-Farabi and others like him. Plato and Aristotle were the authorities he followed, and, like the ancients from Cicero and Porphyry onwards, he believed in the ultimate identity of their views. But the way in which he reconciled them was a peculiar one, not to be traced in our extant Greek sources. He followed Aristotle in logic, natural science, psychology, metaphysics and ethics, metaphysics being taken and developed on Neoplatonic lines, just as we have observed in the case of al-Kindi, and approximating to the account of God given by the MuCtazilites. His comprehension of Aristotle was deeper and subtler than al-Kindi's-he could rely on better texts, due primarily to Hunain ibn Ishaq and his pupils, who had produced, since al-Kindi's day, the best translations of Greek phil- osophy into Arabic. His own teachers, too, may have given him a greater familiarity with the Greek commentators on Aristotle, whether Neoplatonic or earlier. Al-Farabi was, indeed, known to later Muslim philosophers as the second teacher-second, that is, to Aristotle, whose follower he was in both theoretical philosophy and moral. In political theory, however, he was not a disciple of Aristotle, whose Politics was very little studied in the late Greek schools (we have no Greek commentary on it, nor any early Byzantine manuscript, as we have of the o'ther lecture-courses of Aristotle) 37a. For he substitutes Plato's Republic and Laws, convinced that Plato's theoretical speculations have been superseded by Aristotle and the Neoplatonists but clinging to Plato's solution of the problems of politics. 36 p. 47, 3 ff.

XVII ff. 5</page><page sequence="16">Richard Walzer In virtue of this he occupies a unique position; Plato's ideal state enjoyed no great measure of popularity in the neoplatonic school of Athens, nor consequently in the Platonic schools of the Italian Renaissance, dependent as these were on that interpretation of Plato as it reached them through Byzantium. The Republic was not, so far as I know, studied much in the early Christian Church or among the Fathers; nor was it translated into Latin when, through the version made by William of Moerbeke from the Greek, the schoolmen became acquainted with Aristotle's Politics. Aver- roes, who in this and other respects followed al-Farabi, wrote a paraphrase of the Republic which is preserved in a Hebrew translation and in a Latin (the latter, however, not made in the thirteenth century from the Arabic, as were many other translations of Averroes' commentaries, but as late as the sixteenth century and from the Hebrew) 38. It is doubtful whether this particular harmonization of Plato and Aristotle is al-Farabi's own work, or due to some Greek systematization, now lost, which appealed to him; myself I incline to the latter alternative. This attitude of al-Farabi's led him to assert the primary of philosophy over religion, and therewith to attempt to reshape, or at any rate reorganize, the whole Islamic tradition from the point of view of his philosophy. If the caliph-the imam, as he calls him-is to be philosopher-ruler or philos- opher-legislator, then every aspect of Islamic life must be affected by this introduction of the new Greek ideas and so put on a new basis. The philos- opher can now no longer be satisfied with merely providing, as al-Kindi appears to have done, a purely intellectual substructure for the subject- matter of theology; he will attempt the application to Islam of that threefold division of theology, originating with the Stoics and found mentioned in such writers as St. Augustine, according to which there are three theologies, the mythical, the legal and the natural, propounded respectively by poets, legislators and philosophers 39. In Greece the poets would be represented by Homer, allegorically interpreted as by the Stoics or subjected to philo- sophical modifications as in Plato's Republic and Laws (it has indeed, not without reason, been suggested that Dante would be the ideal poet for mee- ting Plato's requirements). This place al-Farabi assigns to the Qur'an; in a Christian milieu, such as he and his disciples seem also to have had in mind, 38 The first edition of the Hebrew text, with an English translation is prepared by E.

Political theology included the official state religion, with its forms of worship, institutions and religious and civil laws, such a scheme as was outlined for instance in the Laws of Plato, and for it al-Farabi substituted the Sharica, the divinely ordained Mohammedan law, the 'highway of divine commandments and in- struction'. This was an obvious substitution for -the Greek system of religious and civil law for a philosopher living in an Arabic-speaking Muslim society, and not in a Greek city-state or the Eastern Roman Empire. But he seems to have considered advising his philosopher-legislator or imam to imbue the Islamic Sharica with Greek tradition, not the details but the legal prin- ciples as they are found in Plato's Laws. The Qur'an and the Sharica, or in other words the mythical and the political theology, which make up the religion of Islam, convey truth in symbolical form only, according to the view al-Faraibi derived from his Greek predecessors. This may be con- veniently illustrated by his attitude to the resurrection of the flesh, an essential tenet of the faith unconditionally accepted by al-Kindi. For al- Farabi, as for a Stoic for instance, the assertion of the resurrection of the dead is valid only in the sphere of religion, where forms of expression are employed differing from those of philosophical demonstration; stories of rewards and punishments in a future life have value only symbolically and as serving to improve the conduct of the ordinary man. This, according to al- Farabi, must have been what Muhammad intended when he introduced this doctrine into ithe Qur'an. Speaking as a philosopher he rejects the resur- rection of the flesh; like Cicero in the Somnium Scipionis, he allows the resurrection of good souls alone, and he does not, like Plato and the youthful Aristotle, believe in transmigration40. From this it follows that al-Farabi could not accord the MuCtazilite or any other rational theology the same esteem as did al-Kindi, who placed it above philosophy (theology being, on al-Kindi's view, grounded in the indubitable certainty of divine revelation). For al-Farabi the highest position belongs to metaphysics, and theology (kalam) can occupy no more than the second place, that corresponding to Aristotle's dialectic as found in the Topics-starting from views generally accepted but not capable of serving as the premisses of strictly scientific demonstration according to the rules enunciated in the Posterior Analytics 41. 40 Cf.

ORIENS III 2</page><page sequence="18">Richard Walzer The truths of philosophy can be understood and grasped by philosophers of all religions and races; they are the same for all, but the individual philo- sopher shares a particular religion and a particular Sharica; he is a human being, and as such he cannot live exclusively in the realm of abstract thought: to do so would make him equal to God, who is pure mind. An Islamic philo- sopher is educated in Islamic customs and taught the Qur'an before he can begin to philosophize, and remains a Muslim the whole of his life, and the same would apply to a Christian philosopher in his attitude to his native reli- gion. Hence it was that al-Farabi could have Christian teachers in philosophy -not merely Christian assistance in the way of translations from Greek or Syriac philosophical texts-and could have Christians as well as Musl'ims among his disciples. The ideal Muslim philosopher will thus be trained in a way similar to Plato's philosopher-king, to whose education al-Farabi speci- fically refers, with the gymnastic side tacitly omitted, and it is he who should rule the Muslim community as imam and successor of the prophet. How this is to be brought about we are nowhere told-presumably by divine appointment (e(.a Xrt), as Plato puts it 42. This philosopher-king may rule the whole inhabited world, giving to all established religions their due position and equal rights; but if this is impossible he will rule the Islamic world alone, and the development will in any case start in Islamic lands, since philosophy, according to al-Farabi, is now dead in Greece but may be revived on Muslim soil in its old home of CIraq. As in Plato, metaphysics and politics are intimately connected in al- Farabi's scheme for an ideal state. The same order prevails in the universe, in man and in the ideal state, and just as the divine mind rules the universe and guarantees its existence, so the mind ought to govern the soul of man and organize society in the most perfect manner. This is what we find in Plato's Gorgias, Republic and Timaeus 43, as well as in Neophytha- gorean imitations of Plato44 and in al-Farabi; the universe, the individual man and the state cannot be considered in isolation, and once the philosopher becomes the supreme ruler all the more detailed problems of society can be solved. It is essential, however, that he shall first 'have moulded his own soul after the right pattern. Al-Farabi's perfect man or perfect philosopher will not be without the intuitive gifts of prophecy, but as in Plato they will be subordinated to his 42 Cf. e.g., Epist, VII 326a-b. 43 Gorg. 508a, Tim 47c, 90d. 44 Cf. the passages mentioned by Baynes op. cit. (above p. I2 n. 28).</page><page sequence="19">The Rise of Islamic Philosophy 19 philosophical powers, instead of predominating as they do in the Athenian Neoplatonism in and after the time of Proclus45. It is undeniable that his view is quite incompatible with Islam in its established form. It is not surprising that al-Farabi, too, provides us with new materials for the history of Greek philosophy; in his case they serve less for the transcendental aspects of that philosophy than for what we may call the political interpretation of Plato, neglected in the school of Iamblichus and his successors. We may, indeed, recover from him a whole Platonic system, together with an account of the dialogues on these lines46 and summaries of the Laws47 and the Republic48. We have here a welcome confirmation for those recent students of Plato who have insisted that equal consideration requires to be bestowed on the metaphysical side of his work, on the ethical and on the political49. 45 Cf.
