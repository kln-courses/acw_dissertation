A T a time when strong feeling is still excited with respect to the whole question raised by Mr. Bradlaugh in his dealings with the House of Commons, it is possible that the dispassionate view of an onlooker may be not without its interest and its use. Accordingly, it has been deemed well to publish the following tolerably complete account of the contest, which (by the permission of the writer) has been taken from the letters of a Hindoo gentleman, now resident in London, to his brother in Indigu</page><page sequence="4"></page><page sequence="5">D LETTER I. London, September, 1880. URING the three or four years of my sojourn in London many things have occurred in the social and political world which have surprised and even puzzled me. All preceding surprises have, however, been put into the shade by the events of the present year. I know you well enough to feel sure that you will be no less deeply interested in the events to which I refer than I myself have been; and I am persuaded that your superior training in historical and philo¬ sophical studies will enable you to understand much that is in part obscure to me. ' As I told you. before leaving India, one of the things I was most curious to investigate in this country was the state of feeling with respect to religious questions. A Hindoo is apt to be a little puzzled on this point. In the ordinary attitude of the British official in India he sees an embodiment of philosophic tolerance worthy of the Roman conquerors of olden times. On the other hand, he observes not infrequently in the mission¬ aries, who come ostensibly to preach the gospel of humanity and universal love, clear indications of narrow prejudice and bigotry. We educated Hindoos, who have studied the history of our religion, and come under the sweet influence of Gautama's teaching, are apt to look on differences of religion with a calm indifference. And I naturally expected that in a country which has for the founder of its religion one who has so much in common with Gautama, and which is so greatly in advance of ours in point of education, there would be found still more of that philosophic temper of allowance and that far-reaching human charity which exist in the land of " the mild Hindoo." My first impression was that English society was pervaded with a spirit of toleration. I noticed, for example, that dignitaries of the Established Church were willing to officiate in the " chapels" of dissenting sects; and this led me to infer that there was greater toleration here than in India. I found,</page><page sequence="6">too, that men of different churches,—Catholic, Anglican, Unitarian, &amp;c,—were accustomed to meet in society those who openly avowed their disbelief in a personal Deity, p.g., Positivists, who follow the teaching of Auguste Comte, and make a deity out of collective humanity. So high did this spirit of forbearance and goodwill among adherents of different creeds run, that an ingenious gentleman, Mr. James Knowles, who, as you know, edits the Nineteenth Century, conceived the happy idea of bringing together Catholic and Protestant divines and Freethinkers in a modern symposium. After a good dinner—everything here begins with a good dinner,— distinguished theologians would discuss mildly with aggressive young "agnostics" (i.e., men who see no ground for believing in a God, &amp;c), of whom the late Professor Clifford was a good type, the question whether the human soul and brotherly love were more than molecular vibrations of the brain, and so, in the last resort, a product of digestion. My observations of the society into which I was specially thrown confirmed these impressions. Among educated youDg men it was considered " bad form " to have a too pronounced religious belief. Only stupid persons were perfectly satisfied about the truths of Christianity. Indeed, I gathered from all that I saw and heard, that in cultivated middle-class society religious beliefof the earnest sort was either dying out or at least was taking to hiding itself from public view. The prevailing tone of remark showed the influence of philosophic teachers, like J. R. Mill and Herbert Spencer, and the yet greater influence ,of men of science, like Professor Huxley. So striking was this predominant tone of scepticism, that it looked as if religious belief itself, rather than the absence of it, was the thing which was asking for toleration in London society. During this year, however, my first impression has been modified. The obstinate narrowness and fierce bigotry that we have often remarked among the inferior class of mission¬ aries have shown themselves here. Beneath the placid, good- natured forbearance that appears on the surface of English society, there lay smouldering the old lurid fires of theological passion. Instead of the new and pretty spectacle of Catholic cardinal, Protestant dean, and Atheist professor meeting on the neutral ground of philosophical discussion, we have wit¬ nessed a revival of the old and more exciting spectacle of a crowd infected by the contagion of theological fury hounding and bespattering a solitary heretic. You know, I think, that since the last extension of the Parliamentary Franchise, the working classes in the towns</page><page sequence="7">have gained a good deal of power, and have succeeded in sending a few of their chosen representatives to the House of Com¬ mons. Among those elected in April last to serve in the new Parliament was Mr. Charles Bradlaugh. He had been trying to obtain a seat for some twelve years, but without success. He was a pronounced Radical, strong on the duty of curtailing the salaries of royal personages and so on, and as such had a certain following. His big, powerful figure and his gift of ready and telling speech were qualifications for a popular leader. But he had managed to make himself obnoxious to "respectable" persons. He has published cheap prints, which circulate widely among the humbler sections of the reading public, in which he not only frankly avows his disbelief in religious dogmas, but aggressively attacks the common Christian doctrines. In other words, he has taken the results of "modern thought" and " scientific research," and tried to bring them home to the mind of the plain man, the hard-worked artisan, who has no time to read books. This society did not like. It was all very well, they thought, for educated gentle¬ men to throw off allegiance to the old creeds ; but the common people had no business to indulge in speculation. This feeling was, I think, shared in by some of the respectable freethinkers themselves, who looked at Mr. Bradlaugh's teaching much as an ordained and properly-constituted clergy¬ man looks on the harangue of an unofficial street preacher. But worse than this, Mr. Bradlaugh had tried to give practical effect to the teachings of political economists. He holds that the terrible evils of poverty, which cannot escape the eye of the most superficial observer of this wealthy metropolis, are to be remedied, not by any socialistic scheme for regenerating society, but by a rigid application of checks to over-population. This view, which, as you know, was enforced by Mill, Mr. Bradlaugh proceeded to embody jn too decidedly practical a shape by publishing a pamphlet in which poor married people could obtain the information which the well-to-do are, it is said, in the habit of procuring from their doctors. You will see at once that a publication of this sort could easily have an injurious effect on sexual morality ; and some of Mr. Bradlaugh's opponents in respectable society, seeing this, instituted a prosecution in a court of law for publishing an obscene print. This ended in a conviction; but the defendant, who is a man of a good deal of legal knowledge and skill, managed to evade the penalty by urging some technical flaw in the case. I should tell you that both the judge (the late Lord Chief Justice Cockburn) and the jury distinctly exonerated Mr. Bradlaugh from any corrupt motive.</page><page sequence="8">This decision injured Mr. Bradlaugh seriously. In this country the people's deep respect for law is apt to show itself in an over-estimation of the moral importance of legal decisions. The fact that Mr. Bradlaugh had been convicted of an offence, and one of a particularly unpleasant character, has been remembered; the fact that his motive was declared, by those who knew all the facts, to be the praiseworthy desire to alleviate human misery has been forgotten. From this time forth he became a man without caste,—a Pariah on whom everybody priding himself on his reputation and his " respectability " thought it well to heap terms of opprobrium. Polite society shrank from him as from a leper. Such being the widespread antipathy to Mr. Bradlaugh, it is not surprising that, instead of receiving support from the Liberal party in his attempts to obtain a seat in Parliament, he was positively hindered by members of the party, and, among others, it is said, by Mr. Gladstone. J. S. Mill, for aiding his candidature by a subscription some years ago, raised a storm of abuse about his head and prepared the way for his own rejection by the London constituency which had once before elected him. And after the prosecution alluded to, Mr. Bradlaugh was left still more to himself. Neverthe¬ less, there is some reason to think that, by a curious freak of destiny, he is to some extent indebted for his recent success at Northampton (the borough which has distinguished itself by choosing him) to the assistance rendered him by certain members of his party. During the progress of the election, the Liberals felt by no means certain of a majority; and in the feverish desire for power, even the social disgust at Mr. Bradlaugh was forgotten. By what writers here are wont to describe as an irony of fate, the friendly push which probably helped to land him within the portals of the House was given by one of the most orthodox of Liberals. This was a Mr. Samuel Morley, a wealthy manufacturer and a Congre- gationalist, who is commonly spoken of as an exceedingly " good " person, seeing that he builds many chapels and heads subscription lists with big donations. This gentleman, it seems, sent a telegram to the good, but timorous, people of Northampton, who shrank from voting for an atheist, and this advice coming from such a quarter sufficed to allay many a scruple. The Liberals won the day, being returned by a large majority, and in the rear of the victorious host came the vulgar and odious Mr. Bradlaugh. As you know, in this country people can easily acquire caste. A man makes money, say as a brewer, buys an estate, and so becomes a gentleman. Mem-</page><page sequence="9">bership of the House of Commons has been supposed to invest persons of very doubtful or " shady " reputation with a social dignity, and it was supposed that henceforth Mr. Bradlaugh would have a certain recognition as a whitewashed outcast. This might have been so if he had been an ordinary man, caring more for a snug niche in respectable society than any¬ thing else. But he continued to be erratic after his election. You know, I fancy, that every newly-elected member is required to take the oath of allegiance to the reigning sovereign. This oath begins with the words " I swear," and ends with the formula "so help me God." This to ordinary sense means an appeal to the Divine Being, who is conceived as having the power of punishing any violation of the promise of which He has been asked to be the witness. And legal authority bears out this view of the nature of the oath. I may tell you that the oath used to be so framed as to exclude Catholics, and later still (up to the 50's, I think) involved adherence to the common doctrines of Christianity, and so excluded Jews. But now it simply implies an admis¬ sion of belief in a personal God and in a future life, unless the act of kissing the New Testament, which accompanies the taking of the oath in the case of all but Jews (who kiss the Old Testament instead) must be still taken to imply accept¬ ance of the Christian doctrine. Certain sects, however, more particularly the Friends or Quakers, who have a religious scruple against using the name of the Deity in this way, are allowed to make a solemn declaration or affirmation instead. You will, perhaps, wonder how, if this oath is a pre-requisite of a seat in the legislature, men like J. S. Mill could have got into the House. The answer is, I think, that the oath has, in the eyes of a good many persons at least, dwindled into a form having no religious significance. The awful sanction, clearly enough recognised in the formula, has been allowed to drop out of sight. This result has been aided by the knowledge that in other European legislatures, as well as in that of the United States, no such religious ceremony is imposed. Now, an oath of a similar form has to be taken by witnesses in Courts of Justice. And here, by a recent Act, a man who himself avows that he has no belief in a Supreme Being, or is proved by evidence to have no such belief, makes an affirmation instead of an oath. Mr. Bradlaugh, owing to his daring experiments in literature, the hatred he has inspired, and his decided taste for litigation, has had considerable experience of the law courts, and, being notorious for his</page><page sequence="10">10 atheistic views, has again and again made an affirmation as a" witness. On entering the Houseof CommonsonMay3rd,Mr.Bradlaugh, instead of going up quietly and taking the oath like other members, asked the officer who administers the oath to be allowed to affirm instead. Being asked on what grounds he claimed the right to affirm, he referred to the following Acts, the " Evidence Amendment Acts, 1869 and 1870," which sub¬ stitute an affirmation for an oath in the case of unbelieving witnesses, and the " Parliamentary Oaths Act, 1866," which allows Quakers and others to affirm when taking their seat in the legislature. The matter was a new one, and had to be referred to the House. A proposal was made that a committee be appointed to inquire into the case. This was violently resisted by certain members of the Opposition, or Tory party. One Irish gentleman, Mr. O'Donnell, gave the key-note to many a sub¬ sequent discussion, by describing Mr. Bradlaugh's creed, with more rhetorical force than scientific accuracy, as the doctrine that religion is a " disease of the brain " and conscience " a nervous contraction of the diaphragm." The Government was twitted with having lent its support to Mr. Bradlaugh at Northampton, and it became evident that the odium attaching to the name of Bradlaugh was about to be turned into a party weapon for the purpose of injuring the reputation of the Government. At length, on May 11th, the committee was appointed, consisting of members of both sides of the House, and containing a good sprinkling of lawyers. On May 20th, the committee reported that, according to their view, those entitled to make a solemn declaration instead of an oath in a Court of Justice could not be admitted to affirm in the House of Commons. It transpired, however, that the opinion of the committee was so nearly divided that it was only by the casting vote of the chairman that the question was decided in this way. The next morning there appeared a letter from Mr. Bradlaugh in the Times, in which he stated his reasons for claiming to affirm :— The oath (he wrote), although to me including words of idle and meaning¬ less character, was, and is, regarded by a large number of my fellow-country¬ men as an appeal to the Deity to take cognisance of their swearing. It would have been an act of hypocrisy to voluntarily take this form if any other had been open to me, or to take it without protest, as though it meant in my mouth any such appeal. He then went on to say that he intended to take the oath, regarding himself " as bound not by the letter of its words,</page><page sequence="11">11 but by the spirit which the affirmation would have conveyed had I been permitted to use it." Mr. Bradlaugh's opponents being thus warned in time (he is always particularly considerate in telling people what he is going to do), they were ready for-him when he appeared at the table offering to take the oath. The proceeding was interrupted by a gentleman called Wolff (which is the German name for wolf) who, as I understand, is a Jew. It is to be noted that the Jews, as well as the Catholics, have been particularly active in resisting Mr. Bradlaugh's entrance. Perhaps, as they have only recently been admitted to Parliament, they think it well that others should have a taste of the bitterness of the outcast's lot. People tell me that Sir H. D. Wolff's inter¬ ruption of the proceedings was irregular, and as such ought to have been disallowed by the Chairman or Speaker. He, how¬ ever, allowed the interloper to proceed, and this proved to be the beginning of a long and fierce discussion. The gist of the opposition, as put by the more temperate of the speakers, e.g., Mr. Gibson, was that Mr. Bradlaugh had, in claiming to affirm, " taken the House into his confidence." It was evi¬ dently this that had annoyed honourable gentlemen. One of them, Mr. Hubbard, candidly confessed that if Mr. Bradlaugh had not, " out of simple vanity, and for the purpose of advertising himself and his detestable doctrines," raised the question, but come forward like other members and taken the oath, no objection would have been raised. I was a good deal surprised at this line of argument. We Orientals are frequently accused by Europeans of making light of duplicity. But in the House of Commons this vice seems to be thought even less of than in India. The House knew quite as well before Mr. Bradlaugh asked to affirm what his theological views were as they did after. If, however, he had taken the oath without a protest, they would not have been horrified, or at least their horror would not have reached the pitch of active opposition. It looks to me as if what offends these gentlemen is not insincerity or hypocrisy but singularity. It was per¬ fectly well known that others before Mr, Bradlaugh who had no belief in the God of the Christian creed had quietly taken the oath, and possibly the House was irritated at a low-bred brawler and an outcast pretending to a more scrupulous honesty than cultivated gentlemen who had read their Aristotle and Paley. As I have already hinted, Mr. Bradlaugh's personality and moral character came in for a good deal of unfavourable com¬ ment. One gentleman, Sir Henry Tyler, after entertaining the House by reading quotations from Mr. Bradlaugh's writings, in</page><page sequence="12">12 which apparently agreeable operation he was at length stopped by the Speaker, proceeded to quote the lines of Dr. Young (the author of " Night Thoughts ") :— A daring infidel Of all earth's madmen most deserves a chain, and seemed to argue in favour of committing Mr. Bradlaugh at once to prison. It was characteristic of more than one speaker that they appeared to regard themselves as judges called on to pronounce sentence on the obnoxious intruder ; at the same time, it can hardly be said that the tone of their remarks was very judicial. When you bear in mind that the subject of all this vitupe¬ ration was one of the audience, and yet prevented by his assailants from defending himself against their attacks, you will be able to judge how far the whole scene exhibited that fairness and courtesy which are commonly supposed to be the distinguishing characteristics of the English gentleman. On the Government side, the Attorney-General, its chief legal authority, contended that the oath had not been imposed as a religious test, and that atheism was not recognised by the law as a disqualification for membership in that House. And Mr. Gladstone spoke to the same effect. But it struck me in reading the debate that there was little cordiality in the support given to Mr. Bradlaugh. Perhaps he was of less consequence to the party now that it was assured of a good majority. As for poor Mr. S. Morley, the author of the tele¬ gram, he seems to have soon repented of his unhallowed haste to get a majority at any cost. And he carefully abstained in the House from doing anything to expedite the entrance of the man whom he had advised the good Northampton people to elect. The one exception to the general indifference of the Liberals was Mr. John Bright, who, as you may remember, is a Quaker, and as such may be supposed to have no great liking for the oath. After two or three adjournments, the House accepted a motion of the Attorney-General, appointing a second committee to inquire whether it was competent for the House to prevent Mr. Bradlaugh from taking the oath. The committee was appointed on May 28th. Before this committee Mr. Bradlaugh himself gave evidence, and, in response to a request of his examiners, produced the let¬ ter which he had written to the Times. People with whom I have talked think he made a serious mistake in allowing him¬ self to be thus examined as to his religious belief. He should, they say, have kept to the ground, that the House</page><page sequence="13">13 had no inquisitorial function, and that, provided a member was ready to take the oath, they were not competent to go behind this and examine into his state of mind. Well, the upshot of this second inquiry was this, that on June 16th the committee reported that Mr, Bradlaugh's proposed formal taking of the oath would not be taking it in the sense required by the statute ; and that they recommended to the House that he be allowed to affirm, subject to the decision of the Courts of Law, which could be taken afterwards. In this way, by a majority of four, the second committee upset the decision of the first. On June 21st, Mr. Labouchere, Mr. Bradlaugh's colleague in the representation of Northampton, proposed that the latter should be allowed to affirm. This was an occasion for a new outbreak of that bilious antipathy from which so many gentlemen were evidently suffering. Another long and fierce discussion ensued. As it proceeded there was heard less and less of the suaviter in modo, and more and more of that harsh¬ ness of tone which is supposed to be confined to the haunts of the vulgar. Sir Henry Tyler, after trying to drag into the discussion the name of a lady who is Mr. Bradlaugh's co¬ adjutor in instructing the people in what he regards as the teachings of science, somewhat naively defined the relative strength of his religious sentiment and his feeling for Mr. Bradlaugh by observing that he " valued the oath now more than ever, because it might be the means of keeping such a man out of the House." Another speaker, an Irish Catholic, Mr. Sullivan, illustrated the Parliamentary idea of justice by remarking that, though they had been willing to do away with tests in obedience to the claim of a large section of the com¬ munity, they were not prepared to relax them to meet the needs of an individual. When, he said, the Atheists became as numerous as the Jews, the Nonconformists, or the Catholics, then the House would have to consider their demands. But then (he went on) they would be face to face with an atheism which had the courage of its convictions, and not with the furtive thing which confronted them there that night, which sought to steal into that House ; which first would not swear and then would swear, which sought to pick the lock, not to force the gate. This way of describing Mr. Bradlaugh's approach to the House, following so soon after the reiterated complaints that the obnoxious gentleman had noisily obtruded his opinions on the House, surprised me not a little. The alleged furtiveness consisted, I suppose, in the readiness to take the oath after being prevented by the House from making the affirmation.</page><page sequence="14">n And this way of viewing the matter, though here presented with a touch of Irish exaggeration, was, I found, shared in by many, both within and without the House, including not only those who were annoyed with him for making so much " fuss " at the outset, but even some who approved of this first step. His proposal to take the oath, it was said, was an inconsistency—a " change of front." This, too, I failed to understand. First of all, it seemed to me that Mr. Bradlaugh had not " declined" to take the oath at all, but merely expressed a wish to make an affirmation instead. And, again, I could not perceive any insincerity or any inconsistency in his offer to take the oath, when he found that by the ruling of the House he could not affirm. If he had been a Quaker, holding it an impiety to invoke his Deity, he would no doubt have deserved censure as a renegade. But the essence of his position was, that to him the words were meaningless; and this being so, there was no room for any conscientious scruple in repeating them when once he had made his interpretation plain to his audience. And it must not be forgotten that he had been sent by his constituents to serve in Parliament, and he may well have thought it obli¬ gatory on him to formally take the oath, now that this was shown to be a necessary condition of serving them. But I ' want rather to invite your opinion than communicate my own, so I will return to my story. On the other side of the House, Mr. Bright again dis¬ tinguished himself as the one member who was ready to deal with Mr. Bradlaugh as a gentleman. With something of a chivalry of tone that sounded quite old-fashioned amid the prevailing harshness, he observed: " I pretend to have no conscience or no honour superior to the conscience and the honour of Mr. Bradlaugh." He poured contempt on the so- ' called " religious" horror of gentlemen at the idea of an atheist taking the oath, by reminding the House of the way in which members usually took it. " I know nothing," he said, " more irreverent than the manner in which great numbers of members take the oath on this floor.*' Mr. Gladstone made a characteristically-cautious speech, in which he disclaimed, for the Government, all responsibility for the appearance of Mr. Bradlaugh at the table of the House, and said that he considered their whole duty in the matter to be at an end when they had frankly offered the House the best advice in their power. This, I know, disappointed a good many Radicals who held that it was the first duty of a Liberal Government to maintain the fundamental principle of Liberalism, that constituencies shall be free to choose what</page><page sequence="15">15 representatives they will, and that civil and political functions ought to be entirely independent of religious creed. The result of this heated and prolonged debate was, that Mr. Labouchere's motion was rejected by 275 as against 230. In place of this there was carried a resolution, proposed by Sir H. Giffard (the chief legal authority on the Opposition side of the House), to the effect that Mr. Bradlaugh be allowed neither to affirm nor to take the oath. A certain appearance of calm deliberateness was given to this decision by the circumstance that the two committees, when taken together, ' had decided against each mode of ingress. Most men in Mr. Bradlaugh's place would have now considered that they had fought their fight, and, resigning themselves to the inevitable, have extracted what comfort they were able to do from the privilege of appending the letters " M.P." to their name. Not so the junior member for Northampton. His physique and countenance bespeak a man of stubborn purpose. It is evident, too, that he enjoys his single-handed conflict. On the 23rd of June he again came forward, claiming his right to take the oath, and asked to be heard at the bar of the House in support of his claim. The House appeared to like this, as it implied a recognition by the petitioner of the fact that he was still an outsider. So they were good-natured, and allowed him to have his say. He spoke with a certain quiet dignity, and urged that this was the first instance in which the House had " ransacked what a man had written and said in his past life." He con¬ tended, further, that he had not in any way forced his con¬ victions on theological matters upon the notice of the House, though he was not ashamed of these opinions, and would rather relinquish the right to sit in that House, much as he valued this, than that it should be thought that, by any shadow of hypocrisy, he had tried to gain a feigned entrance there by pretending to be what he was not. Mr. Labouchere followed up this speech by an attempt to get the resolution of the preceding day rescinded, but in vain. Then the Speaker called on Mr. Bradlaugh to withdraw from the House. To this Mr. Bradlaugh replied: " With great respect, sir, I refuse to obey the orders of the House, which are against the law." This defiance of the House excited a storm of indignation At length, Sir S. Northcote, coming to the aid of the Chair, proposed " that the Speaker take the necessary steps to enforce Mr. Bradlaugh's withdrawal." The officer known as the Serjeant-at-Arms was then called, and this gentleman, placing one hand on the hilt of his sword, and the other on the shoulder of the recalcitrant member, marched</page><page sequence="16">16 him to the door. Mr. Bradlaugh, in yielding to this " manual pressure," informed the House, with his usual candour, that he intended returning immediately. He was as good as his word, and, on this renewed act of insubordination, Sir Stafford Northcote proposed that the culprit be taken into the custody of the Serjeant-at-Arms, and confined in the Clock Tower, that is, the prison to which the House can relegate unruly members. The following day a new turn was given to the proceedings by the spontaneous proposal of Sir Stafford Northcote, " that, the House having duly asserted its authority, the confined member be discharged." And, although Mr. Labouchere frankly informed the House that it was Mr. Bradlaugh's in¬ tention, if liberated, to present himself again, and assert his right to take the oath, the proposa to release him was agreed to. The growing sense of business impeded, and of the dignity of the House lowered, aided by frequent taunting appeals from the Opposition, seems at length to have impelled Mr. Gladstone and the Government to take steps to settle the matter. On June 28th the Prime Minister gave notice of a resolution to the effect that any member claiming to be a person permitted to make affirmation instead of an oath shall be permitted to do so, subject to any liability by statute. The moving of this resolution (on July 1st) was the occasion for another eruption of theological fury. One speaker, Mr. Smyth, gave what, I suppose, is a specimen of modern Parliamentary oratory, in the ironical demand that "a new Affirmation Book shall be prepared, in lieu of the Bible, on which shall be emblazoned the legend: ' God expunged by special desire.' " Another zealous champion of the orthodoxy of the House, General Burnaby, showed his serious view of the situation by producing a big bundle of letters from the most various theological authorities,—Anglicans, Catholics, Moravians, &amp;c,—denouncing the arch-atheist. But his well- meant attempt to impress the House was thwarted by ironical shouts, such as " The Sultan " and " The Shah " While some thus aimed a blow directly at the odious heretic, and only indirectly at the Government, for appearing to coun¬ tenance him, others struck out directly at the Government, twitting them, with some show of reason, for a want of straightforwardness in dealing with the question in this way rather than legislating once for all on the matter. The representatives of the Government did not figure to any great advantage in the debate. Perhaps the most note¬ worthy speech on their side was that of Mr. Richard, a quite</page><page sequence="17">17 orthodox gentleman, I believe, who painted a somewhat ghastly picture of the ceremony of taking the oath as frequently performed at the opening of Parliament, when members crowd and squeeze round the table, " scrambling for the New Testaments scattered on it, amid jokes and good- humoured merriment." At length the volubility of the speakers or the patience of their hearers was exhausted, and the House proceeded to vote. The result was, that the resolution of the Government was carried by a majority of 54 (303 against 249). This success seemed to indicate pretty plainly that if the Govern¬ ment had taken action earlier they might easily have avoided the scandalous scenes of which Mr. Gladstone had com¬ plained. Thus, on July 2nd, Mr. Bradlaugh was allowed to take his seat, in a tentative manner, at his own risk. He seems to have conducted himself well enough when once inside the House, and he spoke temperately on more than one question. He had not long to wait for a judicial judgment on his action. On the very day on which he took his seat, and voted for the first time, some member had been obliging enough to serve him with a writ to recover a penalty of £500. The nominal plaintiff was one Clarke, but it soon came out that the real mover in the suit was Mr. Newdegate, one of Mr. Bradlaugh's most active opponents in the House. The division of legal opinion in the House leaves it very doubtful how the case will go. My friends say that, if it is given against Mr. Bradlaugh, there will be worse troubles in store. For this we must wait till the New Year. If so, you may count on it that I shall continue to keep you posted up on the subject. LETTER II. London, August, 1881. I KNEW the development of the conflict between Mr. Bradlaugh and the House of Commons would greatly interest you, and I gladly accede to your request by sending you a brief narrative of its later stages. During the past Parliamentary year the struggle has been renewed, and without any abatement of violence; and it is commanding a good deal of attention outside political circles. Englishmen rejoice in a contest, and they are ready to admire, with a cold admiration, even an atheist who fights his cause B</page><page sequence="18">18 with spirit and skill. The more thoughtful and liberal- minded people see, too, in this conflict, a rude collision between the spirit of the age—the tendency to deal with religious beliefs of all sorts in the temper of dispassionate criticism—and the intolerant and persecuting spirit of a bygone time. To return to my chronicle of these strange events. On March 11th of this year, the lower Court decided against Mr. Bradlaugh, thus giving legal effect to the decision of the first committee of the House. According to this decision, the right to affirm allowed in certain cases (that of Quakers, &amp;c.) by the Parliamentary Oaths Act, did not include those who were permitted to affirm in a court of justice, when the judge was satisfied that an oath would have no binding effect on their consciences. Upon this being known, one or two of Mr. Bradlaugh's more agile adversaries in the House tried to hinder him from taking any further part in its proceedings; but he easily counterchecked this hasty movement of the enemy by announcing his intention to appeal to a higher Court. Here, however, he was again unsuccessful, the superior Court confirming the judgment of the lower. By this decision he incurred a penalty of £500, and at the same time forfeited his seat. But, though unseated, he was not disqualified for re-election, and he instantly presented himself to his old constituents, asking again for their suffrages. The Northampton people showed that they intended to support him in his conflict by r3-electing him over the head of a Conservative candidate (by 3,437 against 3,305 votes). This event brought things round to the old position again. On April 26th Mr. Bradlaugh presented himself, in due course, to take the oath. People were curious to know whether the House would regard the newly-elected member as a distinct person, about whose religious opinions they knew nothing, or whether they would view him as essentially the identical Mr. Charles Bradlaugh who had caused them so much discomfort by his untimely confidences in 1880. ' The latter surmise turned out to be the correct one. On the appearance of the now well-known burly figure, there followed the same somewhat grotesque succession of informal formalities. When the clerk was about to administer the oath to Mr. Bradlaugh, the leader of the Opposition rose to make a motion. The Speaker repeated his carefully-worded formula : " A proceeding so regular ought, under ordinary circumstances, to be continued without interruption." Then came Sir S. Northcote's resolution, and then, of course,</page><page sequence="19">19 another lively discussion. In this there was little worth remarking, except perhaps a new act of courage on the part of Mr. Bright, in facing the sneers of the Opposition by suggesting that it may have been a tenderness of conscience which prompted Mr. Bradlaugh to affirm. Then came another request from the excluded gentleman to be heard at the bar, and another act of indulgence on the part of the House. This second speech was marked by the same absence of bitterness and the same simple dignity of tone. The speaker dealt more than one skilful blow at some of his opponents, and in the course of his speech said :•— The hon. member for Plymouth says the dignity of this House is in question. Do you mean that I can injure the dignity of this House This House which has stood unrivalled for centuries 1 This House supreme among the assemblies of the world? This House which represents the traditions of liberty I should not have so libelled you. The passage which showed most warmth was that which referred to his recent prosecution :— I have been plunged in litigation fostered by men who had not the courage to put themselves forward. I, a penniless man, should have been ruined if it had not been that the men in workshop, pit, and factory had enabled me to fight this battle. A proud self-reliance betrayed itself in the words: "The Liberal party has never aided me in any way to this House. Never. I have fought by myself." And, perhaps, the fact of his re-election after Mr. S. Morley's open penitence on account of his telegram, justified Mr. Bradlaugh in claiming this position of a man who had unaided fought his way to the House. This speech seems to have roused Mr. Gladstone from his customar}7 attitude of pained neutrality, and, for once taking his cue from the generous tone of Mr. Bright, he said: " I think every man must, in common fairness, admit that Mr. Bradlaugh is to be credited with the best and highest motives." He paid a graceful tribute to that gentleman's behaviour when allowed provisionally to sit in the House. " His conduct while he sat on those benches was the conduct of a man of great ability, integrity, honour, and public spirit." And he tested the genuineness of the so-called "religious" abhorrence of honourable members by asking whether the publication of a treatise that morning by an honourable member, expressing the same opinions as those of Mr, Bradlaugh, would be a ground for interposing. This challenge was met by a cry of " Yes " Still, Mr. Gladstone was no doubt right in his view of what would have happened in the case supposed, and b 2</page><page sequence="20">20 this served to bring out still more clearly the curious technical distinction, that an avowal of atheism, even if contemporaneous with the proposal to take the oath, would be no bar, provided it was made outside the precincts of the House. And this point was made still more explicit by the subsequent speech of the Attorney-General, in which he said the avowal " must be a part of the same transaction (as the taking of the oath), or you could not take cognisance of it." An amusing episode in a discussion otherwise somewhat dull was the emphatic objec¬ tion raised by Mr. Newdegate to the statement that the House was not a Court of Justice. This gentleman, I am told, is an example of the good old-fashioned Anglican, who hates Popery and all its works. Since the advent of Mr. Bradlaugh to the House of Commons, he seems to have transferred his virulent antagonism to that gentleman and his well-known creed. As I have mentioned, it was he who really brought the action against Mr. Bradlaugh for voting without taking the oath. And his successes in the courts of justice may possibly have given him a special respect for these tribunals just now, and inspired him with a wish to assimilate the House as closely as possible to their pattern. And since, as I am told, the Prayer-book speaks of the "High Court of Parlia¬ ment," he may think that he has some authority for claiming for the House a judicial function. The result of this last discussion was another victory for Mr. Bradlaugh's opponents. Sir Stafford Northcote's resolu¬ tion was carried by a majority of 33. Once more the irrepressible Mr. Bradlaugh persists in remaining at the table; once more he is ordered by the Speaker to withdraw; once more he refuses to do so; once more the leader of the Opposition, after appealing to the "leader of the House" and finding him inert, comes to the aid of the Speaker; and once more the offender is led away by the armed Serjeant. Again, as last year, he announces his intention to return, but for to-day is prevented by the now vigilant Serjeant, assisted by a number of subordinates. On the morrow, April 27th, the political comedy was con¬ tinued by a repetition of the several incidents just enumerated. One would suppose that the principal actors must, after so many rehearsals, have acquired a perfect mastery of their parts. Mr. Labouchere, thinking perhaps that by this time Mr. Gladstone must have had about as much of the disagreeable scandal as he could well bear, appealed to him to give him facilities for bringing in a Bill to amend the " Parliamentary Oaths Act." But the right honourable gentleman, full of the " Irish Land Bill," a measure for pacifying the' discontented</page><page sequence="21">21 Irish, would not respond to the appeal. Later on in the discussion, however, he roused himself to action, and proposed to test the feeling of the House by taking a morning sitting in order to discuss the introduction of a Bill. Agreeably to this undertaking, the Government, on May 2nd, took a more decided step to help the House out of this imbroglio than it had yet taken. The Attorney-General formally moved for permission to bring in a Bill to allow all members to affirm if they so preferred. The debate was adjourned again and again, the larger, or at least the more energetic, portion of the House, showing plainly enough that they did not want the Bill. Mr. Gladstone then (on May 10th) proposed a morning sitting for considering the Bill; but at the same time declined to declare the matter urgent. The result was what might have been expected. The Premier's tardy and not very spirited movement failed to rally his supporters in any force, and had no effect in dis¬ lodging the enemy from their position. Pending these proceedings, Mr. Bradlaugh had remained in what may be described as an attitude of armed vigilance. But on the afternoon of May 10th, finding that the Govern¬ ment proposals were abortive, he re-commenced the conflict in his usual manner by presenting himself at the table. He was again told to retire, and, refusing as before, was conducted by the Serjeant below the bar. And now it seems to have occurred to Sir Stafford that it might be well to vary a Parliamentary drama which was becoming a little monotonous, for he brought forward a new and more stringent proposal, namely, that the Serjeant remove the offender from the House till he should engage not further to disturb its proceedings. This was the signal for a new wordy battle, at the end of which Sir Stafford's resolution was passed. By this, as I understand, Mr. Bradlaugh's participation in the privileges of the House, which had not previously been very large, was still further attenuated. He cotild not henceforth have even the dreary satisfaction of elbowing his way through groups of his opponents in the passages and doorways, or of confronting them at his leisure in the smoking-room or other lounging places. But though delivered from the apparition of Mr. Bradlaugh's figure, the House continued to be reminded of his existence. In July rumours reached members of a huge " mass-meeting " of his supporters to be held in Trafalgar Square (which is not very far from St. Stephen's); and one honourable gentleman desired to have the gathering pronounced illegal, as con¬ stituting an intimidation to the House; but this laudable</page><page sequence="22">22 desire was not gratified. The meeting was held on August 2nd, and appears to have been a great success. Encouraged, perhaps unduly elated, by the wild and tumultous cheering of his admirers, Mr. Bradlaugh on the following day, August 3rd, came to the House, and, ignoring the last resolution, attempted to force his way into its precincts. Special police precautions had been taken in view of this contingency. Mr. Bradlaugh on reaching the door of the House found that he had a band of some twelve or fourteen constables to grapple with. Behind the officials, pressing eagerly down the stairs, was a crowd of honourable members, who probably enjoyed the spectacle of their vulgar tormentor having his person mauled, and his clothes torn by a batch of police-constables. It is said (though the statement has been denied) that one honourable member was so carried away by his schoolboy excitement at the scene, as to encourage the police to a more vigorous execution of their duty by crying : " Kick him out! " This struck me as curious behaviour m a body of gentlemen specially intent just now, according to their own account of themselves, on maintaining their judicial dignity, and on proving their zealous adhesion to the mild and humane doctrines of the Christian religion, and this view of the matter was emphasised by more than one leading news¬ paper. Even the cautious and never extreme 'Times spoke out pretty strongly on the disgrace which this scene had brought to the House of Commons. On the same day Mr. Labouchere tried to induce the House to disclaim respon¬ sibility for the excessive violence resorted to by its officials, but instead of passing this motion, it adopted a resolution approving the course taken by the Speaker in preventing Mr. Bradlaugh's access to the House. On the 8th of the present month Mr. Labouchere again endeavoured to move the Government to action, and managed to extract a promise from the Prime Minister, that if at the beginning of the next Session Mr. Bradlaugh should again present himself the Government would take up the matter. It looks from this as if Mr. Bradlaugh had taken the measure of the Government pretty accurately, feeling confident that nothing but a certain amount of worry would induce them to stir in order to remove the anomaly of the exclusion by the House of one of the Government party on the ground of his religious belief. The curtain falls on this second act of the drama at an interesting moment. All the spectators are growing somewhat weary of the monotony of the action ; and Mr. Gladstone's promise gives them a foretaste of new and more interesting developments of the plot.</page><page sequence="23">LETTER III. November, 1882. I FIND that I have much to report to you this year anent the struggle between Mr. Bradlaugh and the House. It has outlasted the third year of this Parliament's history, and some predict that it will outlast its life. During this year the fight has grown more fierce. Mr. Bradlaugh, frustrated in his previous attempts to take the enemy's citadel, has ventured on a bolder mode of attack, and the House has, in response, advanced to new and severer measures of self-defence. Yet, in spite of these new movements, the issue can hardly be said to have been brought any nearer a solution. They have simply had the effect of intensifiying the feeling of bitter hostility. You will readily understand that, if the House disliked Mr. Bradlaugh and all his ways when they first made his personal acquaintance, they hate him the much more cordially for the experience of three years of conflict. He has been so wary, so active, so ingenious in devising new expedients, that the nerves of poor Sir Stafford Northcote and his supporters have been kept in a state of unremitted tension. He has proved a veritable hornet to the House. I suspect that a still deeper cause of the increase of the antipathy against Mr. Bradlaugh is to be found in the consciousness of honourable members that he has made them look ridiculous in the eyes of all discerning persons at home and abroad. If the truth were told, they are probably weary enough of the struggle, and would be thankful for any accident which would put an end to it that was not altogether humiliating. But then, like all angry men, they stickle for consistency ; and Mr. Bradlaugh so contrives matters as to compel them, in the maintenance of this consistency, to plunge deeper and deeper in the mire. How is it, can you tell me,—I have often meant to ask you,—that men are uniformly so jealous about " consistency " in their dealings with their foes, and yet often so indifferent to it in their relations with their friends I can, in a few words, epitomise the history of the contest during the present year. The resolution passed last year, forbidding Mr. Bradlaugh to take the oath, was what is called a " Sessional order," that is to say, it was valid for the Session only. Accordingly, it was known that, on the re-assembling of Parliament this year, the question would again come up. The widespread interest in the conflict was proved by the</page><page sequence="24">24 fact that on this occasion, the evening of February 7th, the Prince of Wales and a large number of peers were in the gallery appropriated to august personages when they desire to be spectators of the doings of the Lower House. In strict fulfilment of his word, the unsworn member for Northampton presented himself to take the oath. With a similarly severe regard for precedent, Sir Stafford Northcote rose to interrupt him, proposing once more the old resolution. In the absence of Mr. Gladstone, Sir W. Harcourt, on behalf of the Govern¬ ment, again took up the permissive attitude by moving " the previous question." Then came another long speech from Mr. Newdegate, whose vehement denunciations were becoming a little wearisome even to those who recognised their comical aspect. As usual, he took his hearers, in imagination, into the Courts of Law, this time recounting his experience in a police-court, to which his opponent, contemn¬ ing his judicial rank as a member of " the High Court of Parliament," had dragged him. The object of this last imaginative journey was to prove to the House that he had been a witness to the fact that the magistrate had not allowed the impious Mr. Bradlaugh to take the oath. But the eviden¬ tial value of this testimony was a good deal diminished by the admission that he had not been able to hear what passed in the police-court, but had received his account of it from his counsel. But, after all, it was felt that there was a sincerity in Mr. Newdegate's earnest protest against allowing the name of the Deity to be taken in vain which lifted it far above the glib, flippant protestations of piety of so many of Mr. Bradlaugh's opponents. And his entreaty, not to let England drift where France had drifted (of whose recent history he gave a curious account), by casting off religion, though feeble enough as an argument, had its pathetic force. After patiently submitting to this unexciting incident, the craving of the House for a stronger stimulant was satisfied by a third speech from Mr. Bradlaugh himself at the Bar. Cer¬ tain words (he said) of honourable members which he has read lately make him wonder whether this is the House of Commons to which he aspires so much. The most exciting passage in the speech was the following :— I say here, Sir, with all the solemnity man can command that if I do take the oath it will be binding on my honour and my conscience. (Conservative cries of Oh! Oh!) Members of the House who are ignorant of what is honour and conscience—(loud cries of Order Oh Oh and Withdraw !)—if members will allow me to finish my sentence—(cries of Withdraw !)—members of this House who are ignorant of what is—(re¬ newed interruptions). These (pointing to the Opposition benches) are my</page><page sequence="25">25 judges. Members of this House who are ignorant of what is the honour and conscience of the man who stands before them (Oh and laughter)— have a right to shout Withdraw but they must beware lest a greater voice outside (Oh Oh and laughter)—at the ballot-box, where they have a right to express it—may not only say Withdraw, but make withdraw all those who infringe the constitutional rights of the nation, as they seek to infringe them now. If all this had been thought out beforehand with the object of first exciting his adversaries to a paroxysm of rage, and then discomfiting them by deftly unfolding an altogether different meaning in his words, it deserved to take its place among the cleverest displays of rhetorical skill on record; and in any case it was remarkable. There was genuine art, too, in the modest diffidence with which the speaker touched on the disgraceful scene of last year at the entrance to the House :— I thought I had stood aside until Parliament had dealt with the pressing • business of the nation I thought I only came saying at the very door of this House that I was ready to obey its lawful orders, and I thought I was then seized by force while saying it. My memory may not serve me well on that, but I think it does. There were plenty of witnesses to the scene. Altogether, I think, this third speech of Mr. Bradlaugh in its dignified self-restraint, as contrasted with the blustering self-importance of his opponents, is entitled to the highest praise, and its climax was not unworthy of it. In the con¬ cluding passage, introduced by the words "Bradlaughis more proud than you are," he challenged the House to pass a Bill allowing the alternative of Affirmation, which should not apply to previous elections; he himself promising to stand aside meanwhile and to resign his seat when the Bill should be passed. This harangue was followed by a discussion in which members on both sides disputed the point whether the collapse of the Government proposal to bring in a Bill had been due to the vexatious opposition of the Tories or to the lukewarm advocacy of the Liberals. Mr. Gladstone brought this wrangle to a close by exonerating the Opposition from the charge of obstruction, and pleading in extenuation of the failure of the proposal the total consumption of time by purposes " connected with matters of the highest and most paramount public importance." At length this discussion, too, came to an end with a like result to that of preceding ones—a victory to Sir Stafford and his followers by fifty-eight votes. Then followed the first step in the now familiar sequence of events: the .order of the</page><page sequence="26">28 Speaker to withdraw, Mr. Bradlaugh's refusal, cries of mem¬ bers for " Gladstone " and " Northcote," the maintenance of an inert attitude by the former, and the rescue of the House from its difficulty by the latter. After this, however, the principal actor in this amusing little comedy, which has now had a long " run," as the theatrical managers call it, thought it best to shorten the spectacle, by rendering unnecessary the last step, the appearance of the symbol of force in the shape of the Serjeant-at-Arms. On February 21st, Mr. Labouchere, having gathered from the Government that they declined to declare Mr. Bradlaugh's seat vacant, proposed that a new writ be issued. On this, Lord Randolph Churchill moved as an amendment that Mr. Bradlaugh be declared disqualified by law from taking his seat in this House. This young nobleman appears to have more than the ordinary impulsiveness of his years, and at times his rashness takes the amusing direction of pronouncing on points of law. The idea that the House could by a resolu¬ tion impose a permanent disqualification on Mr. Bradlaugh, though probably welcome enough to Mr. Newdegate, must have amused a good many of its legal members. Mr. Labouchere's motion led to another long discussion. There was something cynical in this resolution, emanating from the most active supporter of Mr. Bradlaugh, yet appear¬ ing to be directed against him, and, indeed, to be the last step in the consecutive series of actions carried out by the Opposition; and a good many gentlemen were evidently non¬ plussed by the manoeuvre. But, after rubbing its eyes a while, the Opposition seems to have seen the Mephistophelean grin on Mr. Labouchere's features; and as, of course, Liberals were not for unseating Mr. Bradlaugh, the House decided to reject his motion by a large majority. On this there occurred the most scenic of all the scenes of this drama. As soon as the result of the division was known, and while the members were relieving their minds by laughter and chat, Mr. Bradlaugh stepped nimbly up to the table, took a paper, a New Testament, and a pencil or pocket-pen from his pocket, read hastily out the words of the oath, kissed the Testament, signed the piece of paper, and, holding it up to the Speaker, said : " I tender that as the oath which I have taken according to law." He then deposited the paper and New Testament on the table, and retired below the bar, imme¬ diately afterwards re-entering the House and taking a seat within the bar. During this curious performance, the House appears to have been struck dumb by surprise. But as soon as they had</page><page sequence="27">27 recovered from the first shock, they broke out into cries, in which there were some indications of rage and disgust, though the predominant effect seems to have been one of hilarity. Certainly, so far as I could gather from the papers, the behaviour of the House at this moment was not that of persons intensely shocked at the profanation of a sacred ceremony. The Speaker, seeing Mr. Bradlaugh seated within the bar, ordered him to withdraw. To this he replied : " I obey; but I have now taken the oath, and shall now take my seat." He then withdrew below the bar, but instantly after returned and took a seat elsewhere. Hereupon the Speaker again commanded him to withdraw, and again he did so, after asserting his right to take his seat. By this time, it may be presumed, the more virulent opponents of Mr. Bradlaugh had been worked up to a fever of wrath. Lord Randolph Churchill seemed to be affected by all this as a snappish dog by the too near approach of his pet aversion. Sure for once of his prey, he sprang forth and clutched his victim, by sub¬ mitting to the House that the seat was now vacant. But again the noble lord's zeal miscarried through juvenile haste. Unfortunately for his reading of law, it was not for the House, as the Attorney-General had to point out to him, but for a Court of Justice, to decide whether Mr. Bradlaugh had violated the statute; and it might turn out to be a nice legal point whether he had put himself within the reach of the statute by sitting " during any debate." Other members of the Opposi¬ tion followed, accusing Mr. Bradlaugh of having broken his parole. This struck me as a little odd. It seemed somewhat inconsistent in those who had again and again ridiculed the notion that Mr. Bradlaugh was a person having a conscience and honour to suddenly turn round and judge him by the code of honour of scrupulous gentlemen. And I could not see that they had, even by appealing to this new standard, made out a case against their opponent. For, so far as I could dis¬ cover, he had never promised to abide by the resolution of the House, and not attempt to take the oath. So far from this, he had in the frankest way again and again said in his public speeches that he intended to take it as soon as a favourable opportunity presented itself. The debate was adjourned, and renewed on the following day with little abatement of heat. Mr. Gladstone proving, as usual, to be unwilling to exert himself in order to deliver the House out of its quandary, Sir Stafford proposed that that now useful official, the Serjeant-at-Arms, should take steps to prevent Mr. Bradlaugh from disturbing the proceedings of the House.</page><page sequence="28">28 Meanwhile the culprit, whose misdemeanour was now under consideration, had quietly entered the House and taken a seat. This last act of defiance brought things to a climax. The Speaker, whose orders had thus been repeatedly disobeyed, appealed to the House. This called forth cries for Gladstone, who, however, in a more than usually provoking manner, re¬ fused to come to the relief of the House. Thereupon Sir Stafford, rightly estimating the sense of the majority, resorted to " the last argument" of the House of Commons, by asking leave to withdraw his previous resolution, and proposing instead a motion for the expulsion of Mr. Bradlaugh. An attempt by Mr. Labouchere to explain that what that gentle¬ man had done was intended, not to insult the House, but to raise the question of his legal right, was greeted with unmis¬ takable signs of impatience. The House seemed to be eager to slake its thirst for vengeance, and carried Sir Stafford's resolution by 291 against 83. Mr. Bradlaugh, apparently bent on bringing things fully to a legal crisis by voting as well as taking a seat, supplied a fitting close to this act of the comedy by voting against his own expulsion. When the heat of honourable gentlemen's indignation had been a little cooled by this extreme measure, one member, Mr. Storey, following up a previous attempt of Mr. Labouchere, pleaded that the condemned culprit should be heard at the bar; and meeting with no response from the still irate assembly, asked whether in the whole history of Parliament a member had been expelled "without first having been heard in his own defence." But the House was not in a mood to consider precedents or the dictates of justice very nicely. It forgot at this moment its proud claim to be a Court of Justice, and perhaps it was too much to expect an assembly still smart¬ ing under a rude insult to allow the offender who had already stung them so deeply by his speeches to wound them still further. So the honourable member was sent down a second time, not however by a decision of a Court of Law, but by one of the House itself, to try his political fortunes anew at North¬ ampton. They seem to be a singular people these Northampton Radicals, not by any means squeamish, and of an unusual " grit." The expulsion of their member for doing what he had told them he purposed doing was not exactly to their liking. So they set to work and re-elected him, in spite of a more than usually strenuous effort of the Conservatives to secure the seat (by 3,796 against 3,688 votes). The result of this was, that after an absence of less than fourteen days, the stalwart figure of Mr. Bradlaugh was once</page><page sequence="29">29 more able to throw its dark shadow on the House. But on this occasion Sir Stafford Northcote, anticipating the opening incidents of the now familiar comedy, proposed, before Mr. Bradlaugh came to the table, that the resolution of February 7th be re-affirmed. An amendment was proposed by Mr. Marjoribanks to the effect that the matter should be dealt with by legislation. This was supported by Mr. Gladstone, who objected to Sir Stafford's motion as a step "less against Mr. Bradlaugh and more against his constituents, than any previous one." This " new departure " of the Premier gave an opportunity to the Irish members to taunt him with want of straightforwardness. The force of this taunt was instantly illustrated by the refusal of Mr. Gladstone to pledge himself to bring in a Bill in case the amendment were carried; though afterwards he went so far as to say that, supposing this result to happen, the Government would consider it their duty in good faith to address itself to the question. The result was, that Sir Stafford's motion was carried by a small majority (257 to 242). Here, too, it seemed to me that the prolongation of the scandal was distinctly due to the Government's want of spirit and determination. For the rest of this Session the House was but little troubled by Mr. Bradlaugh's claims. He put in an appear¬ ance, I believe, now and again, just to remind his opponents of his existence, and on one occasion (June 22nd) was seen approaching the table with a roll of paper in his hand. But possibly this step was due to the force of habit, and a rebuke from the Speaker sufficed to induce him to withdraw. During this period of Mr. Bradlaugh's Parliamentary in¬ activity, his constituents took up the quarrel, first of all by asking the House to allow them to be heard at the bar in support of their claim to representation; and afterwards by trying the expedient of instituting what is known as a " friendly suit" in a Court of Law against their member for not doing his duty by sitting and voting. But neither of these expedients was successful. At the same time Mr. Bradlaugh indulged his taste for litigation by suing the deputy Serjeant-at-Arms for assault. So for the present, at least, the House was able to flatter itself with the hope that it had rid itself of a standing nuisance. There is only one more incident in the proceedings of Parliament during the Session which calls for notice here. It appears that a Radical member, Sir Wilfrid Lawson, had tried to test the right of members to interrupt the taking of the oath, by interposing with protests at the ceremony when a newly-elected Conservative member, Mr. T. Collins,</page><page sequence="30">30 presented himself. This gentleman is not, so far as I can learn, distinguished as a public teacher, and I do not know on what grounds he has been accused of holding anti-theistic views. Possibly, the whole thing was a joke. However this maybe, the interruption, which was put down by the Speaker, seems to have greatly distressed Mr. Collins. And sometime after he used the right of members to make explanations touching matter of importance to their personal dignity, by pouring a complaint into the ears of the House. As a result of Sir W. Lawson's challenge, he said he had been asked to present a petition in favour of Mr. Bradlaugh. And so, to get rid of this vile aspersion, he then and there professed his willingness to make a declaration of his belief in the words either of the Nicene or Athanasian creed. The latter, as you may remember, is the extreme test of rigid orthodoxy, being, I hear, regarded as of doubtful authority by many of the more intelligent members of the Church itself. But, since the House of Commons has not among its other religious functions the sacerdotal one of receiving a confession of faith, this bold proposal naturally led to nothing. Probably, at any other time, such an incident would have evoked the boisterous hilarity of the House. But its horror, whether real or assumed, of being contaminated by the presence of the arch-atheist, seems to have dulled its sense of humour. In the autumn Session, specially held this year, Mr. Bradlaugh appealed to the House, by way of letter, reminding them of his forbearance, and asking to be heard at the bar. But this appeal met with no response. The House is evidently weary of its troubler, and hopes that he will continue to vent his superfluous energy in the Law Courts. But possibly he will worry them anew in another Session. It is, evident, indeed, that, since his last election, he cannot, even if he were inclined, well remain idle. His constituents have said, in the plainest language, that they wish and expect him to continue his struggle with the House. And it is hardly likely that one with so decided a relish for combat will need much urging on by his supporters.</page><page sequence="31">31 LETTER IV. August, 1883. ri^HIS year has been full of import to those who, like our- JL selves, are interested in the great intellectual and social movements of the age, whether in Europe or the East. During the year, the " Bradlaugh question" has at length been generalised. The untiring energy of Mr. Bradlaugh, aided by the steadfastness of his Northampton supporters, has compelled a vacillating Government, shrinking from a disagreeable task which it felt itself bound by all its most warmly-professed principles to undertake, to overcome its reluctance. This year is memorable, too, for the widening of the area of the conflict. It has passed outside the limits of St. Stephen's, and outside the political arena altogether. The wave of fanaticism, the roar of which has now disquieted for four years the place where laws are made, has at length reached the more solemn courts where these laws are admin¬ istered. The spirit of intolerance which superficial observers of English society had thought dead, has leaped up, strong and active, like a giant refreshed after a long sleep. It seems to me not unlikely that, when the history of modern England comes to be written,—as we are told history will be written by-and-by,—the year 1883 may figure as "the year of the great moral scare." But let me get at once to the facts. Mr. Bradlaugh opened this year's campaign by a second review of the popular force at his back. On the very day of the opening of Parliament, February 15th, another gigantic gathering was convened in Trafalgar Square, reaching, it was said in the papers, to 50,000 persons. The same day, within the House, the Marquis of Hartington, in the absence of Mr. Gladstone in the south of France, announced, in reply to a question of Mr. Lubouchere, the intention of the Government to introduce a Bill dealing with the Parliamentary Oath. Hereupon, Mr. Labouchere promised, for his colleague, that he would take no further steps to secure his seat till the fate of the Bill was known. On the following day, February 16th, the Government formally asked for leave to bring in a Bill to amend the Oaths Act of 1866. This called forth some strong observations from a number of Mr. Bradlaugh's opponents. But the Government proposal was carried by a good majority.</page><page sequence="32">32 The irony of fate showed itself once more in this strange history, in the appearance, at this moment, of a new figure on the Parliamentary scene. Just as the House had insisted that the taking of the oath was a religious act which an atheist could not perform, and just as the Government was giving- effect to this decision by introducing a Bill allowing all members to affirm, a gentleman was elected who was perfectly well known to be as destitute of belief in a personal Deity and a future life as Mr. Bradlaugh himself. This was none other than Mr. John Morley, whose papers in the Fortnightly Review and works on " Voltaire " and " Rousseau," we have read together. Mr. Morley was elected for the borough of Newcastle, on February 24th, in place of Mr. Ashton Dilke (brother of Sir Charles Dilke), who had just died. Mr. Morley, I am told, is one of a band of Oxford men who very early threw off their allegiance to Oxford's Church. He stood in close relations with Mr. F. Harrison and other Posi- tivists, or followers of Auguste Comte, though, so far as I can learn, he never identified himself with their curious religious programme. He had been profoundly influenced, like many other Oxford men of his time, by Mill's writings, and would, perhaps, be best described as a follower of the modified Eng¬ lish Positivism of the great logician. With respect to theo¬ logical questions, he was more outspoken than Mill. You will remember that in his critical studies on the three French writers he casts more than one jeer in passing at the complacent beliefs of the orthodox. And you will further recall the fact that at one period this writer habitually showed his contempt for the theistic conception by writing the name of the Deity with a small " g." But in his later works he has much more distinctly formulated his creed. It so happened that I had just been reading his volume on " Compromise " when the author was elected, so that its teaching was fresh in my mind. As I am not sure whether you have seen these later writings, I will give you one or two quotations, in order to show you how very clear an utterance he has given. In his essay on " Compromise," he writes:— Those who agree with the present writer are not sceptics. They positively, absolutely, and without reserve, reject as false the whole system of objective propositions which make up the popular belief of the day in one and all of its theological expressions. Perhaps, however, the most unambiguous statement of his real views on religious questions appeared after Mill's death, and apropos of that thinker's posthumous essays on religion, which so greatly interested us both. Mr. Morley's remarks are those</page><page sequence="33">33 of a warm disciple, who is compelled by the force of his deepest convictions to undertake the painful task of accusing his master of falling away from the truth. With reference to Mill's discussion of the grounds of Theism, he writes:— If you attach personality to this intelligent Mind, it can only be a finer version of the rude anthropomorphism of the fetishist. If you do not, then the notion of a bare Mind, or a bare Will, busying itself over the Kosmos, is to me as utterly without meaning as the old theory of the universe being generated by contradictories. Just as plainly as we are here told that every conception of* a personal Deity is irrational are we informed, further on, that all hope of future life is illusory. Mr. Morley thinks it a pitiful weakness in his master that he pleaded for the right of imagination to indulge itself in such an anticipation. He accuses Mill of greatly under-estimating the capabilities of science to deal with the question, and argues that modern physical teaching adduces positive evidence against the suppo¬ sition. Here, then, if anywhere, seemed to be a person who had committed himself in the clearest manner to a denial of the two beliefs which give the oath its meaning. And now let me briefly explain how it was that one who had thus been so exceptionally outspoken came to present himself at this awkward juncture at the door of an assembly so deeply tinged with the theological spirit as the House of Commons. As you know, though a literary critic of considerable cul¬ ture and breadth, Mr. Morley had long shown a strong leaning to " affairs "—to the practical questions of social science and politics. As editor of the Fortnightly Review, he had done much to make his journal the organ of a new " philosophical Radicalism." Questions of the day, as we see in the essay on Education, occupied more and more of his thoughts. It was not, therefore, a matter of much surprise when, at the last general election, he allowed himself to be nominated candidate for the metropolitan borough of Westminster, which Mill had represented. There seemed to his admirers a certain appropriateness in the succession of the man who had taken up Mill's work in literature to his predecessor's seat in Parliament. The result of the election was that Mr. Morley was beaten. A new opening for a political career opened up presently in the vacant editorship of the Pall Mall Gazette, the leading Liberal evening paper. People who knew Mr. Morley's writings expected now to see a new and higher style of journalism, for Mr. Morley, who, as you must have remarked, is rather fond of administering sharp rebukes, had more than once m his " Compromise" come down on the c</page><page sequence="34">34 newspaper press,—" that huge engine for keeping discussion at alow level," which is given to " delivering brawling judg¬ ments unabashed on all things all day long." But after a time the impression became common that, while keeping up a certain appearance of independence of judgment, the Pall Mall Gazette was coming more and more under ministerial influence, and learning the common journalistic art of con¬ juring with questions of political party so as to make them look like questions of political principle. All this naturally prepared the way for the success at Newcastle. So much for Mr. Morley's antecedents, the history of which may, I fear, seem to you somewhat of a digression. Yon will understand that the election of such a man at this crisis set a good many people conjecturing. In his volume on " Com¬ promise," Mr. Morley bad put the duty of intellectual honesty considerably higher than Mill himself had put it. Not only were we not to simulate by word or act beliefs which we did not really hold—even in cases where " by refusing to offer a pinch of incense to the elder gods " we missed a " marked opportunity of exerting an undoubtedly useful influence over public opinion,"—we were .under the strongest obligation to openly declare our opinion regardless of consequences. Even the hardest result of such brutal frankness, the infliction of pain on others, was not to weigh with us, except in one instance, that of the relation of parent and child. While Mr. Morley had put the duty of candour in specula¬ tive opinions at this lofty level, he had also professed to feel a good deal of high-minded courage in face of such a duty, and a corresponding degree of contempt for the timorous vacillating creatures who shrink from the personal conse¬ quences of laying bare their convictions to the searching light of day. In one passage in particular the writer takes up a sublime and almost superhuman attitude of indifference to others' treatment. And what (he says) is this smile of the world to win which we are bidden to sacrifice our moral manhood ; this frown of the world whose terrors are more awful than the withering up of truth, and the slow going out of light within the souls of us Consider the triviality of life and conversation and purpose in the bulk of those whose approval is held out for our prize and the mark of our high calling Then how pitiful a thing seems the approval or disapproval of these creatures of the conventions of the hour, as one figures the merciless vastness of the universe of matter sweeping us headlong through viewless space ; as one hears the wail of misery that is for ever ascending to the deaf gods ; as one counts the little tale of the years that separate us from eternal silence. On Mr. Morley's going down to Newcastle at this crisis in</page><page sequence="35">35 the Parliamentary struggle, people asked curiously whether the writer of these noble lines would now " stand to his guns " and practice the blunt openness which he had so elo¬ quently preached. His admirers were, of course, confident of the issue : but there were some among my acquaintances, cynical prophets, who predicted a less glorious sequel. Even before the election was over Mr. Morley had satisfied this curiosity. You must know that during the stage of canvass¬ ing for votes it is not unusual for questions to be put to candi¬ dates respecting their religious opinions. And it was only natural at this juncture, when the fear of atheism had spread outside the House, and grown into something like a panic, that the religious Liberals of Newcastle, who had, of course, been posted up to some extent by the Opposition in their candi¬ date's published views, should be more than usually prying. Now other candidates had had this same difficulty to face, and had faced it. Maeaulay, I believe, gave a smart slap in the face to some people who tried to inquire into his religious opinions on a like occasion. And J. S. Mill had, during his candida¬ ture at Westminster, quietly refused to answer similar inquiries. Mr. Morley thought it well, for reasons it would be impertinent to inquire into, to adopt the opposite course. At a great gathering of his supporters in the Newcastle circus, held on the eve of the election, Mr. Morley acceded to the wish of those " good people " who were only too ready to vote for him if he could remove their religious scruples, by making a profession of faith. Here is this remarkable avowal in the authorised version of the Pall Mall Gazette itself. After a gentle protest against the inquisition, the speaker said :— But I can only say—and this is all I will say on the subject, and I beg you to bear with me, for it is not the kind of language heard on the political platform—that, after looking over what I have written and thought for twenty years past, since I was a lad at Oxford, I cannot feel that I have ever been guilty of an irreverent phrase ; I cannot feel that I have ever failed to try and profit by all that was good in other men's faith. No one ever found in me a cold defender (sic), and whenever an appeal has been made, in whatever language, to the solemnities and mysteries of the universe, and to all that is holiest in the aspirations of mankind, I have never been a callous listener. Religion has many dialects and many tongues, but it has one voice—the voice of reverence and human pity ; of mercy, of justice, of righteousness, and I say that, with all my defects and infirmities of character, to that voice I have always honestly striven to listen. I need not tell you that this declaration, made at such a moment, gave rise to a good deal of comment. Most of those whom I heard speak of the matter, saw in this event c 2</page><page sequence="36">36 one of the most remarkable indications of the force of the storm which Mr. Bradlaugh had managed to raise. "It goes without saying" that on his election Mr. Morley came up to take the oath, and you will not, I think, be greatly surprised to learn that no honourable member rose to interfere *vith the proceeding. Yet this apparently quite orderly and every-day event, occurring between the first and second readings of the Affirmation Bill was, in sooth, fraught with a curious significance for both parties. On the one hand the readiness of the Conservatives to allow a cultured freethinker whose writings were familiar volumes on their club tables, and whose disqualification to take the oath had been distinctly hinted at in the newspapers, to go through the ceremony unchallenged, served to expose the insincerity and " humbug" of a good deal of the affected horror at the profanation of this ceremony. But there is, I fancy, another bearing of the event. Mr. Morley's alacrity in entering the House and taking the oath at this moment distinctly damaged the Government. It was the association of the Affirmation Bill with the odious name of Mr. Bradlaugh which threatened to shipwreck it. Numbers of the Government party had again and again urged—though more by way of innuendo than direct statement—that others besides Mr. Bradlaugh needed the relief which such a Bill would afford. Yet here was a pronounced freethinker, and an unimpeachable and high-minded gentleman, as ready apparently to take the oath as any of his predecessors, before a scheme of relief was dreamt of. So obvious was this to everybody with whom I talked, that some were disposed to view Mr. Morley's entrance into the House just now as another proof of the half-heartedness of the Government. A word, they argued, from his friend Mr. Chamberlain, who as you know, I expect, is the most energetic among the young Radical ministers, would pretty certainly have prevailed on him to take up the position of a second and highly-respectable sufferer from the stringent imposition of the oath. But this view, I confess, struck me after what had happened at Newcastle as exceedingly problematical. The fact of Mr. Morley's oath-taking was thus an argument which cut both ways, and as such could not well be used by either side. The Government party could not make use of it in order to taunt the Opposition with insincerity, because in so doing they would have laid themselves open to the retort, that, by the same showing, the Bill was a " Bradlaugh Relief Bill," required to help that obnoxious individual over the threshold, and nobody besides. This circumstance would of</page><page sequence="37">37 itself probably suffice to explain how it was that there was so little reference to the occurrence in the course of the debate, even if the rules of Parliamentary etiquette had not made it impossible to allude to an action of an honourable member which was susceptible of an unflattering interpretation. Between the first and the second reading of the Affirmation Bill Mr. Bradlaugh scored another success in the Law Courts. You will remember that the action brought against him in 1881 was instituted by one Clarke, who was found afterwards to have been supported or maintained by Mr. Newdegate. In March the defendant appealed to the highest tribunal, the House of Lords, against the penalty then imposed, on the ground that " the common informer "—i.e., a private indi¬ vidual—was incompetent to sue; and his appeal was suc¬ cessful. A still greater triumph of legal research and ingenuity was a successful action brought against his virtual prosecutor, Mr. Newdegate, and tried before the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Coleridge, for the old offence of " main¬ tenance." Thus Mr. Bradlaugh, by his superior legal know¬ ledge, had managed not only to escape the penalty which Mr. Newdegate claimed, but actually to turn round on his prosecutor and mulct him. As you know, the real Parliamentary tussle over a measure comes off at the second reading, and this stage of progress of the Affirmation Bill was fiercely contested. The debate began on April 23rd, and was concluded on May 5th, extending over five long sittings carried far into the night. Rarely, if ever, has the storm of windy words beaten more violently on the House. Passion gained in fury each night. It was enough to have turned a steadier head than Mr. Bradlaugh's, to find himself, like another Boreas, able to lash the sea of this great assembly into a raging, foaming mass. The Tories took the Bill—as well they might, in spite of protestations and a late-inserted clause, that it was not to be retrospective in its operation— for a " Bradlaugh Relief Bill," and tore and worried the docu¬ ment as they would not improbably have been willing to tear and worry that offensive person himself. The burden of the Opposition was the same throughout. The House of Commons—that last of religious legislative bodies to stand, beacon-like, above the swelling tide of infi¬ delity—was about to put out its spiritual light. There would have been something sublime in this protest, if it had only been sincere. But, though an individual member or two, like Mr. Newdegate, might be inspired by a genuine zeal for the honour of their God, it was but too plain, from the very temper of the speeches (apart from the refutation which Mr. Morley</page><page sequence="38">38 had supplied) that the majority of the infuriated band were inspired by the more vulgar motive of antipathy to a man. On the first night, April 23rd, there were few incidents to note. The Attorney-General, in introducing the Bill, observed that though there were 116 statutes on the book imposing disqualifications for membership in that House, none of these recognised any disqualification on the ground of religious belief. Sir R. Cross, on the other side, re-stated the position that, though it was right to grant relief to religious scruples, this was a case of no conscientious scruple at all. Mr. Baxter, on the Government side, for once broke through the reticence imposed by good Parliamentary manners, when he exclaimed : " Why did not honourable gentlemen know—it was time the country knew, at all events—that many men had come up to that table and taken that oath who did not believe in God " But loud cries of " Name " at once reminded him of the fact that this mode of attack was prohibited by the rules of Par¬ liamentary warfare. On the second night, April 26th, Mr. Gladstone made one of his great speeches. Compelled by cruel circumstances to take up the disagreeable subject, he wisely resolved to turn the necessity into a great moral opportunity. He took up the attitude of a sufferer for principle's sake. " Do you suppose," he cried to gentlemen opposite, "that we do not feel pain ?" And added, in his grandest manner : " But the difficulty is the measure of the duty, and the honour." Probably a good many people felt what I did on reading this, that it would have come with better grace from one who had displayed more alacrity in taking up his political cross. The Premier then went on to refute the theory of the Oppo¬ sition respecting the significance and importance of the oath. Your contention, he said, is that a man may go any length he likes provided he does not reject the name of the Deity. " You draw the line at the point where the abstract denial of God is severed from abstract admission of God. My proposition is that your line is worthless." That is to say, the opponents of the Bill were quite willing to throw overboard the really valuable part of the Christian's belief, the recognition of a personal Providence, and of man's responsibility to his Maker, and yet clutched tenaciously at a comparatively worthless possesion, the bare admission of the abstract conception of the Deity. The moral worthless- ness of such a conception Mr. Gladstone proceeded to illus¬ trate by quoting the magnificent lines of Lucretius (II. 646) : Omnis enim per se divom natura necesse est, &amp;c.</page><page sequence="39">39 From the shadowy belief of the Epicurean, he passed to the sta,te of mind of the modern Agnostic, who says : " Whatever is beyond the visible scene, whatever may be beyond this short span of life, you know and can know nothing of it." This " specific mischief of the age," he added, " you do not attempt to touch." The speaker then went on to give his own inter¬ pretation of the oath as being much more than this, and having in its accompaniment (the kissing of the New Testa¬ ment) " a very large flavour of Christianity." It struck me that Mr. Gladstone's argument hardly met the force of the objections to the Bill. The large majority of the opponents distinctly maintained the theory (supported again and again by legal authority), that the meaning and value of the oath lay in an appeal to a personal God, who did hold very substantial relations with man, since He was a witness to their actions and capable of punishing their infidelity. The binding force of the oath, according to this view, resided in a fear of Divine retribution. As one speaker (Mr. Gibson) put it shortly after : " Can any man doubt that if, at the bidding of Mr. Bradlaugh, you get the fear out of the oath, the honour will not be in long " Hence it seemed to me to be inaccurate to say, as was said virtually outside as well as in¬ side the House, that a mati may pare down his idea of Deity to the world-soul of the Pantheists, or the phantom Unknow¬ able of Mr. Herbert Spencer, and yet take the oath in good faith. Some, possibly through ignorance of other religions than their own, went so far as to say that a cultivated Budd¬ hist could conscientiously take the oath. But what seemed to me the most remarkable example of this line of reasoning was the approving commentary of the Editor of the Pall Mall Gazette on the authoritative utterance of Mr. Gladstone. " There is (said this gentleman) nothing in the form of the oath to strain the conscience of the Agnostic, who may say that he appeals to Divine sanctions if there should prove to be any." It occurred to me that if anybody wished to throw dis¬ credit on the oath, by showing whom it would consistently admit, a better line of argument would have been to point out that an adherent of one of the lower forms of religion, provided he held that his Deity would regard the violation of a promise made in His presence as an insult and visit it with retribution, would be fully qualified to take the oath. The theory of the House respecting the oath is one thing, its practice another; and those two points were not, I thought, kept sufficiently apart in the arguments of the sup¬ porters of the Bill. If the practice and not the theory were</page><page sequence="40">40 considered, recent events would clearly show that not only the abstract theist, but the atheist, that is, he who rejects all evidence for the Divine existence, is, provided he does so at his own risk, at perfect liberty to take the oath. Mr. Gladstone's magnificent speech naturally stimulated the brains of the Opposition to a preternatural degree of activity. And, in a speech of Mr. Stanley Leighton, the House was regaled with what I am told is one of the finest displays of modern Parliamentary wit. Mr. Gladstone (said this facetious gentleman) was like Mr. Facing-both- ways in "Pilgrim's Progress." Mr. Facing-both-ways walked down the street arm-in-arm with Mr. Bradlaugh and a Baptist minister. To the one he said, " The backbone of Liberalism is Nonconformity" ; to the other. " But Atheism is one of its vertebrae." The cleverest dialectical stroke, I think, on the Opposition side, was the argument of Mr. Gibson, that the Bill had been introduced because Mr. Bradlaugh had organised a mob in Trafalgar Square. This taunt served to get rid of the appear¬ ance of a rather shabby struggle between a great legislative body and a single individual, and suggested that the real foe was the turbulent mob outside. And there is no doubt that chronology lends a certain plausibility to Mr. Gibson's conten¬ tion ; yet it seems to me probable that Mr. Gladstone had been driven on to legislate much more by the uproar within St. Stephen's than by that in Trafalgar Square. Mr. Chaplin quoted certain passages from a speech of Mr. Gladstone, delivered in 1854, in favour of retaining the Par¬ liamentary Oath; and the eagerness of members of the Opposition to " bait" the Premier was strikingly illustrated by the fact that this passage was quoted twice in the course of the debate. On the third night, April 30th, the most interesting feature of the debate was a long speech from Lord Randolph Churchill. Indeed, this seemed to me to be the choicest dish in the long banquet of oratory. Lord Randolph had evidently determined to rise to the occasion, and to rival the learning and rhetorical subtlety of the Premier's oration. So he plunged manfully, not only into the obscure region of law, but into the yet darker and more dangerous territory of theology and ecclesiastical history. The spectacle of this very mundane-looking young nobleman discoursing learnedly about the Fathers was, I was told (I regret to say, I failed to get into the gallery that evening), exceedingly amusing. With a fine contempt for small distinctions of chronology, he rolled togetj^r in one promiscuous heap, Augustine, Origen</page><page sequence="41">41 (whom he pronounced " Origen "), the Venerable Bede, and Jerome. And, in order to surpass Mr. Gladstone himself in subtlety, he justified the modern toleration of Jews by Christians by means of the following propositions : (1) The heresy known as Arianism was an improved Judaism. (2) It was a historical accident that Arianism was not now the religion of Europe. I will leave to you the exercise of getting a syllogism out of these premises. So far as I can understand it, the argument seems to imply that the dominant creed should only tolerate those creeds which have shown at any time a tendency to become them¬ selves dominant,—a curious theory, regarded from an ethical point of view, and one, I should say, rather difficult to apply. But I do not feel at all sure that I followed the noble lord's somewhat intricate line of argument. Next to this supreme effort of Lord Randolph, the speech of the evening was that of Mr. McCoan, one of those Irish gentlemen who had done so much to enliven this long and tiresome discussion. Mr. McCoan's speech was the finest illustration of the state of white heat to which the temper of the House had now been raised. So carried away was the speaker by the prevailing excitement, that, when he arrived at the last half of a by no means long speech, he had quite forgotten what he had said in the first. He began by saying that if the Bill were passed, 500 Bradlaughs would straight¬ way be sent up to that House. He ended by contending that the Bill was so unpopular that those who ventured to support it would lose their seats. Mr. Marriott took what looks, to an outsider, unnecessary pains to resent the taunt that the Government had thrown its cegis over the hounded person of Mr. Bradlaugh, by reminding the House that this gentleman had been much more an object of antipathy than of sympathy to the Govern¬ ment, as well as to the whole House. " His appearance," he said, " has had much the same effect as of a ghost appearing among women and children." On the fourth evening, May 1st, the speeches grew decidedly dull. In the general intellectual drought the House must have been grateful for the one or two meagre springs of wit which presented themselves. Of these, the first was a rhetorical passage by Mr. O'Donnell, who undertook to give a definition of an Atheist, which had all the appearance of a rigorous scientific definition, and was ponderous enough to find a place in the next edition of Johnson's Dictionary. " An Atheist," pronounced Mr. O'Donnell, " was a man who professed himself to be distinguished, in certain particular details of development</page><page sequence="42">42 and structure, from the beast and the brute." The other amusing incident was the perusal by another opponent of the Bill, Mr. J. G. Talbot, of extracts from letters just written to a Newcastle paper by a professed Atheist. This person, to judge from the quotations, must have been endowed with a sense of humour, for among his teachers he made special reference to one of the past and one of the present members for Newcastle, namely Mr. A. Dilke and Mr. J. Morley, and spoke of the " noble precepts" of the latter gentleman, which only needed to be carefully applied in order to usher in that happy day "when the little child will repeat to its approving parent Shelley's dictum, ' There is no God.'" But so far as I could make out, the estimable Mr. Talbot did not see that these letters, quoting as masters in Atheism two gentlemen who had taken the oath, went to show that the preservation of this ceremony was a poor phylactery against the malady of freethought. On the fifth and last day, May 5th, Mr. Newdegate once more varied the somewhat monotonous course of the debate by a reference to his personal experiences. As I have already told you, poor Mr. Newdegate's experiences in the Courts of Law have been less happy of late, and very possibly his old admiration for these institutions has been a good deal qualified. He used the present occasion to pour a more bitter complaint into the ears of honourable members. Let not the House imagine (he said) that Mr. Bradlaugh is any longer a victim in a pecuniary sense ; the whole burden has been shifted to the shoulders of the humble member who is now addressing you. He then recounted the story of his varying fortunes in the field of litigation, commenting on "the complicated intricacies of Mr. Bradlaugh's proceedings," and pleading in justification of his initial action, that he—or rather he and Mr. Clarke together—had only sought one penalty of £500. He went on to make a somewhat unlucky appeal to that impious elf, Heinrich Heine, as an authority on the social dangers of Atheism. And he wound up a speech rich in personal reminiscence by expressing his joy that resistance to the Atheist had formed a bond of union between himself and his former opponents, the Roman Catholics. The Solicitor-General made one more faint attempt to break through the etiquette of the House by remarking that he had reason to believe " that in the case of a member actually elected to this present Parliament it was a matter of very serious and grave doubt and hesitation to him whether he could properly take the oath at the table." But since in the</page><page sequence="43">43 instance cited, which of course everybody recognised, the grave doubt and hesitation must have been rapidly overcome, there seemed to be little point in the learned gentleman's informa¬ tion. Sir Stafford Northcote, who at length brought the long and wearisome discussion to a close on his side of the House, quoted " a Professor of a Mahomedan College in India" (whose name you will easily divine) on the danger of "Atheism and Bradlaughism " spreading to our country. And, finally, the Marquis of Hartington replied for the Government, plying the opponents of the Bill with the dilemma, "either Mr. Bradlaugh has been elected member for Northampton, or he is nothing but a brawler disturbing our proceedings, and ought to be in that case committed for contempt " ; and as a volley of Opposition cheers met this last suggestion, he skilfully turned the tables on the other side by reminding them that the very day after Mr. Bradlaugh had been committed, Sir Stafford Northcote came and proposed that he be released. But the Marquis was less happy in his attempt to show that the Government had been prompt in dealing with the question. At last, in the small hours of' the morning, honourable members, heated and flushed, poured into the lobbies in order to give their voice for and against the abolition of the theistic test. A friend of mine, who was present, told me that the scene when the result was announced surpassed every¬ thing he had witnessed in the way of frantic excitement. It had been known that the Government majority would not be a large one, still a bare triumph had been counted on. You can imagine then the wild excitement when it was known that the Government had been beaten by a majority of four votes (293 against 289). There was wild shouting and leaping on to the benches, waving of hats, and even the throwing of these much-prized symbols of respectability into the air. The scene had something of the mad frenzy which we are familiar with in Oriental fanatics, but more of the frolicsome turbulence of English schoolboys when intoxi¬ cated by winning a closely-contested match. I need hardly tell you that the Government took their defeat with philosophical resignation. To judge by their spokesmen in the press, they found a convenient scape-goat in the Irish party, who had gone over to the other side for no other reason, so it was said, than to annoy Mr. Gladstone in retaliation for his unpopular measures. The Tory papers said the Government ought to resign, but everybody knew that they had no such intention. Had they not suffered for</page><page sequence="44">44 conscience' sake, meeting the jeers of honourable members and of a scoffing press, at their espousal of " Bradlaugh and atheism," and were they to be deprived of office as well No Mr. Gladstone had done his painful duty, and was now entitled to proceed with those great measures which were to throw a sunset glory over his last years. The real attitude of the Liberals in the whole contest was, I suspect, faithfully described by a Liberal evening paper, the Echo. The writer says :— Almost every Liberal in the House would have let the bitter eup pass from him if he could. Hence there has been but little heart on the Liberal benches in favour of the Bill. Members have in voting for it performed a disagreeable duty. They have walked through the division lobby solemn and sombre, as if they were going to a funeral. The writer went on to draw the inference that the Govern¬ ment should not have knocked itself against a stone wall by taking up the measure. Others, however, held that if the Government had moved at first, and energetically, it might easily have led its large majority to victory. The clouds of battle being dispersed, there appeared as before the ineffaceable figure of Mr. Bradlaugh. The very next day, May 4th, that gentleman gently reminded the House of his still vigorous existence by means of a letter to the Speaker, asking that functionary to call him to the table, or, if that were objected to, to allow him to be heard at the bar of the House. On this Sir Stafford took up his well- practised part once more, proposing the old resolution. Be¬ fore passing this, however, the House, feeling, after its victory, a new impulse of generosity, allowed Mr. Bradlaugh to be heard for the fourth time in support of his claim. This speech, which was a less remarkable oratorical feat than some of its predecessors, was devoted mainly to further exonerating the Government from responsibility in reference to his election, and to meeting attacks of honourable gentlemen on his cha¬ racter. After this, Mr. Labouchere, in moving the previous ques¬ tion, made a more distinct reference to Mr. Morley's entrance into the House than had yet been made, speaking of him as a gentleman who " had avowed himself to be an unbeliever in a superintending Providence as clearly as Professor Huxley himself." Of course the House did not mind this thrust, and voted Sir Stafford's resolution once more. After this Mr. Bradlaugh gave the House two months' respite. But on July 9th Sir Stafford elicited from Mr. Gladstone the fact that he had received a letter from Mr.</page><page sequence="45">45 Bradlaugh, which had already appeared in the newspapers, announcing his intention to take his seat in defiance of the orders of the House. The result of this last confidence on the part of Mr. Bradlaugh was that a motion was passed ordering the Serjeant-at-Arms to exclude that gentleman from the House until he should engage not further to disturb its proceedings. Upon this Mr. Bradlaugh tried his fortune once more in the courts, by claiming an injunction to restrain the Serjeant-at- Arms from using physical force. Thus it seems that the net result of all this year's noisy battle is that the " Bradlaugh difficulty " is just where it was four years ago. The House has no doubt wrought its pleasure in excluding the obnoxious gentleman; but he is not dead, either in a physical or in a legal sense, but remains an inconvenient obstruction at the door of the House, and a standing menace to its peace. As I told you in beginning this letter, the tornado of fanaticism which has now so long agitated the Par¬ liamentary waters has this year swept over a much wider area. Among its most noteworthy results was the revival and stringent enforcement of the long-slumbering law of blasphemy, by which the publication of any attack on the dominant creed was made a penal offence. I had hoped to append a slight record of this remarkable case, partly because it directly grew out of the political opposition to Mr. Bradlaugh, partly because it illustrated the same odd distinction which English society at present draws between the " licensed" dealers in atheistic wares in the higher classes and the " un¬ licensed " hawkers in the lower ranks; and, finally, because it served in a curious way to confirm the impression that one of the strongest of Liberal Governments has been infected by the epidemic of quasi-religious terror. But I cannot enter on the history of so intricate a matter at the end of a long letter, and must reserve my account of it for another occasion.</page><page sequence="46">46 LETTER V. July, 1884. DURING this year the case of Mr. Bradlaugh and the House of Commons has distinctly advanced a stage. Just before the opening of Parliament in February, the thrice- elected member for Northampton published a manifesto in the Pall Mall Gazette (which is no longer edited by Mr. John Morley) twitting the Conservatives with not having tested by legal proceedings the validity of the form of oath he administered to himself in February, 1882, and indicating- pretty clearly that he should on the 11th of February make another attempt to take his seat. In the afternoon of that day the Peer's gallery was as usual overflowing with otiose senators eager to witness the annual Parliamentary " entertain¬ ment." After prayers, the object of all this curiosity, who had been waiting outside, took the seat under the gallery allowed him as a "half-caste" member. The dulness of "question- time" had, however, to be first endured, and during this interval, which was longer than usual, the crowded House was as impatient as boys at the pantomime while the orchestra is performing previous to the rising of the curtain. But before the questions were exhausted the spectators' impatience was relieved by seeing Mr. Bradlaugh, who had been smiling complacently in his seat, walk down and take up his position just behind the bar. His two supporters or " introducers," Mr. Burt and Mr. Labouchere, followed, taking up positions on either side. The central figure in this drama did not look by any means the callous person he is often described, but betrayed in the pallor of his countenance and the nervous movements of his hands con¬ siderable agitation. As soon as questions were over, he hurried up to the mace (the symbol of the Speaker's authority, which, while he is in the chair, lies on the table in front of him), his introducers following. His advance was the signal for another storm of angry shouts, varied by hisses, from the Opposition side of the House. The Speaker stood up and cried "Order! order!" Mr. Bradlaugh, left now alone (his introducers having done their part and retired), proceeded, regardless alike of his opponents and of the mandate of the chair, to administer a form of oath to himself similar to that gone through in 1882. The various steps in this proceeding—</page><page sequence="47">47 taking a small New Testament, the certificate of his return, and a sheet of white paper out of his pocket, reciting the words of the oath, kissing the volume, &amp;c,—were executed rapidly, yet without any marks of flurry. This action being completed, the Speaker, after a solemn rebuke to Mr. Bradlaugh for having come to the table without being sum¬ moned by him, ordered him to withdraw ; and the latter hurried back to his original place under the gallery, and assumed once more his expression of calm complacency. Hereupon the old order of events occurred again. Sir Stafford Nortbcote, after his usual sarcastic reference to " the Leader of the House," proceeded to submit the old proposition, that Mr. Bradlaugh be not allowed to go through the form of repeating the words of the oath, without betraying any recognition of the exquisite irony of the proposal at this moment. The Premier followed deprecating any opposition to the motion, and hinting that the Government were ready, now that it was decided that the legal question could not be raised at the instance of a private individual, themselves to raise the question in a Court of Law. In spite of Mr. Gladstone's gentle protest, Mr. Labouchere pressed for a division on Sir Stafford's motion, and defended this course by the most outspoken speech which had yet been heard on the subject. With galling effrontery he confessed that the words " So help me God " were to his mind "just the same superstitious incantation as the trash of any mumbo- jumbo among African savages." The House tried to look dreadfully shocked at this outrage, but smiles of amusement and groans of indignation ran each other rather close. The part of first comedian in this political drama was again taken by that lively young gentleman Lord Randolph Churchill, who, with his mind still running on legal matters, asked that the documents deposited by Mr. Bradlaugh on the table at the 'dose of his "oath-taking" might be submitted to honourable gentlemen for inspection. In these praiseworthy efforts to entertain the House, Lord Randolph was assisted by Mr. Healy and other Irish gentlemen, who, having discovered that Mr. Bradlaugh was still secure in his " enjoyable nook" under the gallery, asked the Speaker to name him,—that is, formally to call the attention of the House to his unruliness, as he had been wont to name Mr. Healy and other Irish gentlemen when they grew too obstreperous. But the Speaker informed them that the honour of being " named" was a prerogative of fully-constituted members having a seat within the bar. It being known, that Mr.' BiSdlaugh intended voting, in I ' .«. /tRSITr ', I OF BRISTOL. S LIBRARY</page><page sequence="48">48 order to force the question to a legal issue, his opponents used all their ingenuity to prevent this step. But Mr. Bradlaugh proved once more too much for them. On the division being taken on Sir Stafford's motion, it was found that Mr. Bradlaugh had gone into the " no " lobby, voting against the motion. It was then proposed that his vote be disallowed. And though the House was told that this would not affect the legal question, it insisted on having the semblance of the satisfaction of annulling the vote. But this motion for disallowing the vote having been also pressed to a division, it gave the wily Mr. Bradlaugh another opportunity of going into the lobby. When the heads of honourable gentlemen had sufficiently cooled to enable them to see that this kind of thing might go on ad infinitum, without any hope on their part of overtaking Mr. Bradlaugh, they wisely abandoned the chase. All this time the tellers (that is " counters ") of the votes had been waiting to report the result of the first division. They now had an opportunity of performing their duty, and informed the house that Sir Stafford's resolution was once more carried by a large majority (280 as against 167). After this Sir Stafford proposed the "consequential motion," that Mr. Bradlaugh be excluded the precincts of the House. On this Mr. Bright made one more appeal to the generosity of members by asking them to accept Mr. Labouchere's assurance on behalf of his colleague, that having raised the legal question he would not further interrupt their proceedings. But honourable gentlemen were, it was said, by this time jaded and eager for dinner, and so, little disposed to cool reflection. Accordingly, they jeered at Mr. Bright's notion that Mr. Bradlaugh's word might be relied on, and rushed once more into the division lobby to score another triumph. This final manoeuvre enabled Mr. Bradlaugh to still further secure the point he was aiming at by voting a third time. The same night, Mr. Bradlaugh applied for the " Chiltern Hundreds," that is to say, asked to resign his seat, and his application was granted. The effect of this movement was that, though, of course, still liable to the penalties for what he had done, he could not be unseated. So, once more, the long-suffering Northampton electors had the tedious and expensive business of an election forced on them. But they appeared to accept their fate contentedly, and, so far from being weary of " the Bradlaugh difficulty," they re-elected their old member by a larger majority than before (4,032 votes as against 3,664 for his opponent). This happened on the 19th of February, and on the 21st</page><page sequence="49">49 the Speaker read a letter from Mr. Bradlaugh, in which he informed the House that, understanding that the Government had taken proceedings to test the legality of the course taken by him on the 11th instant, he would not present himself at the table till after the hearing of the suit. On this Sir Stafford Northcote once more proposed his now familiar resolutions. He had no doubt, he said, that Mr. Bradlaugh's engagement would entirely protect the House from any incon¬ venience until the legal issue had been settled; but argued that it was necessary for them to protect themselves in anticipation of what might happen. Mr. Gladstone protested against this as an uncalled for piece of harshness. The discussion thus opened up enabled Mr. Newdegate to make another pathetic reference to the Courts of Law, by remarking, amid much cruel laughter, that the House had had full information from these tribunals. He did not, however (unfeeling man on this occasion indulge the House with an account of those delightful personal reminiscences of his. Again Sir Stafford led on his followers to victory, the majority for the motion being fifty-three (226 as against 173). On this Mr. Bradlaugh, who had during the debate been sitting below the bar, moved up to the bar, but on being told to withdraw did so with his usual protest. On March 6th, Mr. Bradlaugh was sued by the Crown for penalties amounting to £2,500, for having sat and vot^d without taking the oath as required by the statute. That the House was not, in spite of Mr. Newdegate's declaration, in¬ different to the legal issue which its action had in a manner raised, was proved by the fact that on the eve of the trial Sir H. D. Wolff entered his objection to the case being tried by the Lord Chief Justice, who, in his opinion, had shown in previous instances a lamentable partiality for Mr. Bradlaugh. The case did not come on till the next term. It commenced on June 13th, and, owing to the indisposition of Lord Coleridge, was not brought to a close till the 30th. Besides this judge, who presided, there were two others to assist him. On the side of the Crown was arrayed no less a force than the Attorney-General, the Solicitor-General, Sir Hardinge Giffard, and two other counsel. Mr. Bradlaugh, as usual, conducted his own case. The Attorney-General, who opened the case, argued that Mr. Bradlaugh's performance in February was not a taking of the oath according to the statute (which directs that it shall be taken according to the regulations of the House); that that gentleman was disqualified for taking the oath by</page><page sequence="50">50 his want of belief in a Supreme Being ; and that, owing to what he had communicated to the House in 1880, it was in full possession in February last of a knowledge of his unbelief. To a layman it seemed an anomaly in a chapter of anoma¬ lies that the very gentleman who, in supporting his chief in the House of Commons, had argued so strenuously that the oath had not been instituted as a test of religious belief, and that an atheist as such was not legally disqualified for taking the oath, should, now that he had donned his wig and gown and stepped over into the High Court of Justice, be ready to contend that want of belief in a Supreme Being vitiated the form of going through the oath. Nor was I less puzzled at observing that the same learned gentleman who had argued in the House, in April, 1881 (when Mr. Bradlaugh came up after his re-election to take the oath), that the investigations of the committee in 1880, by which the House was said to have arrived at a knowledge of Mr. Bradlaugh's unbelief, were extraneous to the transaction of that moment, should now urge that these investigations were continuous with the later event, namely, Mr. Bradlaugh's action in February, 1884. But I was told that this anomaly was only apparent, the Attorney and Solicitor General who represent the Crown in Courts of Justice being, by a curious convention, regarded by others, and permitted to regard themselves, as distinct persons from the Attorney and Solicitor General who support the Ministry in the House of Commons. On the whole, it struck me that the Attorney-General was as fair as the situation allowed him to be. Yet he seemed to me to exceed the limits of fairness when he contended that if Mr. Bradlaugh's present state of mind was not the same as it was in June, 1880, he could easily go into the witness- box and say so. Mr. Bradlaugh's main contention, as I understood it, was this :—" Even if in 1880 the House had any right to go behind my declaration made before its Committee, that the oath would be binding on my con¬ science as an oath, prying into my state of mind, and the particular meaning which I attached to the word oath (which right he denied); there cau be no such right now that four years have elapsed." In support of this proposition, he touched on the abstract possibility of a change of conviction in such an interval; and, as I understood the observations of one of the judges (Mr. Justice Grove), he was legally entitled to make use of this argument. But that, as a matter of fact, he meant seriously to suggest that he had changed his views would, I think, never have occurred to the most stupid of jurymen.</page><page sequence="51">51 I will not go into all the particulars of Mr. Bradlaugh's long and elaborate defence. He seemed, by the frequent questions and consultations of the judges during his speech, to have given their lordships a sufficiently hard legal nut to crack. Perhaps, one of his most ingenious points was, that his action of February was not invalidated by the circum¬ stance that the form of the oath was self-administered, since the statute had not enjoined or empowered the House through any of its officers to administer, whereas in the case of certain other oaths the duty of administering was distinctly imposed on specific persons. At length came the summing-up of Lord Coleridge and the decision of the jury. Their verdict, in answer to certain questions which were submitted to them by their lordships, was briefly this :—The defendant did not on 11th February, 1884, take the oath according to the full practice of Parliament. At the time of taking it he had no belief in a Supreme Being, and was a person on whose con¬ science the oath as an oath had no binding' force. Finally, the House of Commons had full cognisance of these matters. And, generally, he did not take and subscribe the oath as an oath. These findings of the jury have, so far as questions of fact are concerned, settled the matter. But there are, I under¬ stand, still points of law to be argued; and these will have to be dealt with after the Long Vacation. If Mr. Bradlaugh fails to make out a case for the arrest of judgment, he will, he says (provided it turns out not to be a criminal case), appeal once more to the House of Lords. So that the legal issue raised cannot be said to be as yet finally settled. The combat of the Northampton athlete in the Courts of Justice has, as you would expect, excited less interest than the more dramatic contest in the House. I have, indeed, been surprised at the meagre reports of the trial in most of the newspapers. Nobody would have suspected from these that no less a question was being settled than whether the law imposes a grievous civil disqualification on those who, having no belief in a personal Deity, are honest enough to say so. Yet such is surely the matter at stake. If this case goes against Mr. Bradlaugh on the ground of his having made known the fact of his unbelief, then the statute-book is convicted of offering a bribe to hypocrisy. Mr. Bradlaugh's exclusion from his seat will no longer wear the appearance of an arbitrary act of the House endeavouring to keep itself select by blackballing objectionable persons. It will appear as the quite orderly result of a law, which, even if (as Mr. Gladstone and the Attorney-General have told us) it was not</page><page sequence="52">in the first instance intended to be a test of religious belief, has somehow eventually become so. And what, you will ask me, is to be the end of the matter I know too little of England to venture on a prediction, and can only give you hearsays. Even if, it is said, Mr. Bradlaugh should ultimately win his case in the Courts of Law, the present House of Commons is too deeply committed to its determination to exclude him to be much affected by a declaration of the illegality of its action. He will, therefore, not take his seat during the present Parliament. In a new Parliament, however, he will have another chance, the value of which will depend very much on the feeling about the question in the constituencies. With respect to this last factor in the case, I am informed by some of the most intelligent persons with whom I have talked on the subject that the newspapers which say that all interest in the Bradlaugh question is over are simply measuring public opinion by the tape of club and drawing- room gossip. What is here called " society " is quickly excited about topics, but is never excited long. Last year, for example, well-dressed London was agonised at suddenly discovering that many of its poor neighbours were housed rather worse than pigs; but after a few weeks the artist who amuses them in the weekly drawings of Punch was regaling them with somewhat ghastly jokes about fine ladies making an afternoon pleasure party in piquant costumes to some fragrant East-end "slum." Similarly, say my friends, with the " Bradlaugh scare." The sensation has subsided, and with it the interest. On the other hand, the mass of the English people, though not easily excited, feel keenly and stubbornly when they begin to feel; and though slow to perceive, they have a dogged habit of ultimately groping their way to the truth. This beiug so, they will become more and more convinced that Mr. Bradlaugh is an ill-used man. Not having the gentle¬ manly disgust at his personality from which so many members of the House of Commons appear to suffer, they will judge of the case more dispassionately. And even those, and there are many, who strongly dislike Mr. Bradlaugh's opinions and at first shared in the feeling against him, have had their senti¬ ments towards him greatly modified by the manly way in which he has carried on his long and hard contest. Hence they will be disposed to give him " the benefit of the doubt," and to say that, after all, he may have a conscience, even though there is no fear of hell behind it to keep it going; and that his wish to affirm may have been due not wholly to vanity</page><page sequence="53">53 and a wish to advertise himself, but in part, at least, to an honest scruple in which some others of his own way of thinking appear not to share. The same persons assure me, further, that, however this be, the spirit of toleration in religious matters is far more highly developed in the lower middle and working classes than in the upper classes. The former are largely Dissenters, and their history and traditions lead them strongly to resent any State interference with a man's belief about religious matters. Among the working classes, moreover, there is, by common consent, a perceptible increase of freethought, which must greatly accelerate the general demand for toleration. But other and more powerful influences, my friends add, will hasten this result. The working men are becoming more and more closely consolidated. They already sympathise with their Northampton brethren under the insult which they feel the House of Commons has put upon them. This feeling will deepen, as it is more clearly seen that the oppo¬ sition to Mr. Bradlaugh is the outcome of a social prejudice, and not of a mere difference of theological opinion. And it will be still further deepened when it is perceived that other constituencies of working men may be similarly treated if they happen to send an obnoxious person—say a follower of Mr. George, who advocates confiscation of the land—and if he should turn out to be an unbeliever and candid enough to state the fact. The growing conviction that a community of interest compels them to resist all encroachments by a body composed largely of landlords and great capitalists will tend more and more to make the Bradlaugh question a working men's question. But whatever the precise form which the settlement of this question will assume, some of its results are, I think, already clear enough. Mr. Bradlaugh and the particular cause which he espouses have acquired the glory which persecution commonly manages to throw about the head of its victims. On the other hand, the reputation of the ancient House of Commons has been tarnished. That famous assembly, which has in other centuries fought valiantly with imperious and obstinate monarchs, has in these latter days pitted itself in ignoble fray against a simple citizen. And of many of the Parliamentary combatants in this unequal contest, it must, I fear, be said, that they have stooped to the unworthiness of fighting under false colours ; and that, while professing to wage war for the honour of the Eternal, they have in reality been contending for their own poor dignity. The Bradlaugh con¬ flict has, in the eyes of thoughtful persons, lowered the repu-</page><page sequence="54">54 tation of the House more than ship-loads of those Irish "Obstructionists" could have done who have of late so grievously impeded useful legislation. The Government must, I think, in a measure share in this reproach. If it had interposed resolutely, so as to secure the support of its strong majority, before foolish passion had grown rampant and the House was' hopelessly stumbling among the pit-falls dug by its own false pride, the " Bradlaugh scandal" would, I fancy, have been confined to very small dimensions. No doubt it would have been hard for an intensely Christian man like Mr. Gladstone to take the bull by the horns in this way. But then it is to be remembered that his well-known devoutness was to all discerning minds a perfect defence against the clumsy shafts of ridicule which the couplers of the names of Gladstone and blasphemy would, no doubt, have been eager to discharge at him. And many think that if the Premier had at once resolved to face the disagree¬ able task, there would have been added to his wreath another unfading laurel. THE END.
