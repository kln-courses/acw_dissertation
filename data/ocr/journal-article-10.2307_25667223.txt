<plain_text><page sequence="1">Plains Anthropologist Journal of the Plains Conference Volume 19 November 1974 Number 66, Part 1 THE ARIKARA BUFFALO SOCIETY MEDICINE BUNDLE by James H. Howard ABSTRACT The Buffalo society or "clan" of the Arikara combined buf falo calling and thanksgiving rites with curing functions. The sacred medicine bundle of this society, no longer functional in the tribe, was collected from the son of the last keeper in 1973. Its contents were subsequently catalogued and analyzed employing the cognitive approach: i.e., every attempt was made to place the component parts of the bundle in their proper setting in terms of their symbolism and function in traditional Arikara religion. This entailed an exhaustive study of Arikara mythology and ceremonialism. Four origin legends aid in understanding the contents of the bundle and its attendant ceremonialism. Rituals of the Buffalo society, in which the bundle figured, were of two kinds: rites for the purpose of calling the bison, and tribal rites in which the Buffalo men joined with other shamanistic groups to pray and give thanks to natural powers. The principal tribal rite was the annual ceremony of the Medicine fraternity. This involved religious prayers and dances and also lengthy magical per formances. The Buffalo society, like the other shamanistic groups of the Arikara, had its own peculiar feats of legerde main, most of which had some mystic reference to the animal spirit of the society and its powers to cure illness or treat wounds. Descriptions of the annual Medicine lodge ceremon ies of 1908, 1922, and 1924 indicate that by this time the magi cal performances had disappeared and only the religious aspects remained. By the 1940's even these abbreviated cer emonies ceased. An analysis of the contents of the Buffalo society bundle indicates that this tribal palladium was assem bled some time prior to 1850, probably about 1835, judging from the trade beads used on one of the headdresses. Some of the regalia in the bundle appear in Curtis' photographs of the 1908 Medicine lodge ceremony. All or most of the items in the Buffalo society bundle can be explained within the framework of Arikara mythology and ceremonialism, though many would be meaningless if one lacked this perspective. Considering the enormous economic importance of the bison to American Indians it is not surprising to find that it figured in religious ceremonies over a great part of North America. Buffalo dances were widespread in eastern North America and the Mid west, reminding us that the range of the bison was not limited to the Prairie and High Plains. Dances honoring the buffalo were performed by the Mo hawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, Seneca, Dela ware, Shawnee, Cherokee, Choctaw, Creek, Yuchi, Seminole, Calusa, Ojibwa, Fox, Sauk, Potawatomi, Winnebago, and Eastern Dakota, and probably other "Woodland" groups as well. Continuing west, we find that dances and ceremonies honoring the buffalo were universal in the Prairie and High Plains regions. All of the eastern Pueblo tribes have buffalo dances, and even the Hopi have a Buffalo kachina. Certain Plateau groups, such as the Flat head and Nez Perce, and Great Basin groups such as the Bannock and Shoshone, also have buffalo dances or include buffalo symbolism in major tribal rites. As one might expect, however, it is in the Prairie and High Plains where buffalo ceremonialism is most pervasive, and where it takes the greatest variety of forms. Buffalo symbolism is prominent in the Sun Dance in all of the tribes which performed that ceremony. It is also present in many versions of the Calumet ceremony (the Pawnee Hako, the 241</page><page sequence="2">Omaha and Ponca WS Wan, the Dakota HunkS). There were also many ceremonies specifically dedi cated to or invoking the power of the bison among these tribes. Usually these involved the impersona tion of bison by one or more individuals wearing headdresses made of the scalp and horns of the animal. Three distinct ritual configurations, all involving buffalo costuming and mime, emerge from the ethnographic data on Prairie and High Plains groups: (1) A dance, often accompanied by sha manistic performances, performed to honor the "Buffalo people," to give thanks to the species for providing food, and to "call" the buffalo to the area of the tribe performing the dance, and petitioning the "Buffalo people" for continued bounty. In some tribes this dance was open to all members of the tribe (i.e., the ubiquitous Buffalo dance still per formed as a pow-wow feature in both the northern and southern Plains, by such tribes as the Plains Ojibwa, Dakota, Cheyenne, Arapaho, Ponca, Kiowa-Apache, and Comanche). In other tribes it was limited to a select Buffalo society or priesthood. (2) A Buffalo curing ceremony, often accompanied by a dance and magical performances. This was usually performed by a select group of curers or "Buffalo doctors" who had received the bison as their animal familiar while on the vision quest. These men were generally specialists in setting broken bones, treating arrow and bullet wounds, and the like. They were, in a word, the tribal surgeons as opposed to the "Bear doctors," who dealt mostly in herbal medicines and were the tribal physicians. (3) A warrior-dancing society involving buffalo head dress costuming and a dance imitating the actions of bison bulls. The members of this "Bull" society, though they dressed and danced in imitation of bison, were in other respects typical warrior fraterni ties. The idea behind their bison headdress and stomping dance was mainly to indicate that they possessed the strength and fortitude of bison bulls, and like old bulls had the wisdom to guide the herd (i.e., their tribe). It was not their function to "call" the buffalo nor to cure. In tribes with age-graded warrior societies the Bulls society was generally at or near the top (Lowie 1916:906), and was composed of older, semi-retired warriors. Among the Arikara all three of these configura tions were present. The first two seem to be of con siderable antiquity with them but the third, the Bulls warrior society, was probably a late borrowing from the Mandan and Hidatsa (Lowie 1916:893). Further more, the Buffalo dance of the Arikara, referring to the first configuration noted above, was performed only by a select group known as the Buffalo society or priesthood, known in Arikara as the Chiwiku or Shedding (Buffalo) group, which was also the "Buffalo doctor" grouping of the tribe. The Buffalo society was one of eight component groups of the Arikara Medicine fraternity.1 For many years the Arikara, when speaking English, have referred to their Medicine societies as "clans," for example the "Buffalo clan" and the "Bear clan." These groups are not clans in the usual anthropological sense. That is, they are not unilineal kinship groups, the members of which trace their descent to a common ancestor, nor are they exogamous. Instead, each of these societies was composed of a limited number of persons, each of whom had elected to join the group and had undergone a long period of appren ticeship to earn his position in the group. A vision of the spirit animal emblematic of the group may have been instrumental in the selection of which society an individual elected to join, but it does not seem to have been a prerequisite for membership among the Arikara. In this respect they differ from their Siouan speaking neighbors to the south. The regalia worn by the members of each of the eight groups when performing their dance, together with certain holy objects, formed the contents of each society's sacred bundle. In the days when the traditional tribal religion of the Arikara was still vital, all of the society bundles were housed in the Arikara medicine lodge or tribal temple. It is the purpose of this paper to describe the contents of one of these society bundles, that of the Arikara Buffalo society. In the spirit of the "new ethnography" we present not merely a catalogue of the contents, but attempt to place the bundle and its component parts in their proper setting ? the cognitive world of the Arikara. Thus we will consider the symbolism of the ele ments in the bundle, the ceremonies in which they figured, and the legendary explanations of these rites. Fortunately, though most of the lore concern ing the Buffalo society and its bundle has been lost by the present generation of Arikara, previous workers have provided a wealth of data which we may employ in reconstructing the cognitive system in which this tribal palladium functioned. RECENT HISTORY OF THE BUFFALO SOCIETY BUNDLE In February, 1973, I was contacted by Dr. Ken neth Leonard, M.D., of Garrison, North Dakota. Dr. Leonard numbers most of the Arikara among his patients and has a deep interest in their traditional culture. Leonard had recently secured the Arikara Buffalo society medicine bundle from Ben Heart, an 242</page><page sequence="3">Arikara of the Ft. Berthold reservation. Ben is the son of Frank Heart, recently deceased, who was the last keeper of the bundle. According to Ben Heart, his father had told him, shortly before his death, to sell, destroy, or give to the State Historical Society of North Dakota the Buffalo bundle once he (Frank) had passed on, since no one else knew its medicine or how to use it properly. With the Arikara it is customary for someone to purchase a sacred bundle and the information connected with it when its keeper becomes advanced in years. With the passing of the old ways, no younger Arikara had come for ward to do this, so Frank Heart felt that the know ledge regarding the bundle would die with him. He did not want the bundle passed on to another Ari kara untrained in its use, lest this person use it incor rectly and thus harm his people. Therefore, shortly after his father's death, Ben Heart called Leonard and advised him to come and get the bundle. From remarks made at the time it was apparent that Ben Heart was afraid that the medicine in the bundle was still too strong to have around the house. He remarked that the two buffalo (headdresses) in the bundle would "fight" at night, clicking their horns together, keeping the family awake. This, he said, caused his son to miss school due to lack of sleep. Leonard, accordingly, went to the Heart home and removed the bundle, giving Ben Heart a sum of money in return. It was understood by both parties that Leonard was purchasing an essentially non functional bundle, and not the knowledge for using it. Leonard felt that the proper thing to do with this religious item, formerly so important to the tribe, was to place it in the Museum of the State Historical Society of North Dakota, since Frank Heart had felt that this was where the bundle should be deposited. Before leaving it with the museum, however, Leonard asked the present writer to catalog and describe the use of the bundle. Although the Arikara have not staged their Buf falo dance for many years, many of them still have a strong belief in "Buffalo power." Thus, when a group of boys from another tribe performed an exhi bition Buffalo dance at the White Shield pow-wow a few years ago, Levi Waters and other older Arikara were very upset. Levi commented that the Buffalo dance was only supposed to take place at a certain time of the year, or the Arikara gardens would be destroyed by an early frost, which, in fact, happen ed to the gardens that year. The writer deposited the bundle in the Museum of the Historical Society in Bismarck in August 1973. / / o o %%\ i ? ; \ o o / \ O O / \ ? / O O Rgure 1. Ground plan of Arikara medicine lodge, from Curtis (1909: opp. p. 64). Other writers on the Arikara do not recognize the "Principal Medicine" as a separate medicine society. TRADITIONAL ORIGIN OFTHE ARIKARA BUFFALO SOCIETY BUNDLE There are no less than four legends among the Arikara which purport to explain how the tribe first acquired the Buffalo society bundle and its attend ant ceremonies: (1) "Why the Buffalo No Longer Eat People" (Dorsey 1904:39-40, 40-44); (2) "The Buffalo Wife and the Javelin Game" (Dorsey 1904: 94-101), also known as "Lucky Man and the Buf falo" (Curtis 1909:93-100); "The Five Turtles and the Buffalo Dance" (Dorsey 1904: 115-116); and some variants of the Arikara Genesis myth (Dorsey 1904:12-17, 26-31; Curtis 1909: 80-86). The Buffalo society is also mentioned in the tale "Contest Between the Bear and the Bull Societies" (Dorsey 1904:172-173). In the legend "Why the Buffalo No Longer Eat People," the protagonist, a young Arikara warrior, finds that the "Buffalo people," who resemble humans but have horns and tails like bison, are sys tematically running and killing humans. The humans (ancestral Arikara) are trying to emerge to the surface of the earth from a subterranean realm. As they emerge, via a hollow cottonwood tree, the Buffalo people, aided by their ritual, begin hunting and killing the humans. Following the advice of a supernatural Buffalo cow who has the ability to 243</page><page sequence="4">change herself into a beautiful woman (Dorsey 1904:43), or Bow-and-arrow Man in another version (Dorsey 1904:39), the protagonist makes a number of bows and arrows and arms the humans, who then turn the tables on the Buffalo people and begin hunting them. The anthropomorphic Buffalo people flee, though some of them tuck pieces of human flesh beneath their arms. In their flight they are transformed into buffalo, and the human meat that they placed under their arms becomes a part of their flesh. For this reason the Arikara used to discard the meat from beneath the bison's shoulder.2 The young hero and the supernatural Buffalo woman now claim the bundle formerly used by the Buffalo people when hunting humans. The young man marries the Buffalo woman and she teaches the people the songs and the ceremony that go with the bundle. Their descendants become a part of the Arikara tribe. In "The Buffalo Wife and the Javelin Game" a handsome young bachelor known as "Man-Who Kills-Game-Easily" has a vision of the hoop and pole game (a game with sexual symbolism played to call big game, especially the bison and elk, in many Prairie and High Plains tribes. He has intercourse with a supernatural buffalo cow and from her acquires the hoop used in the game (her vagina). He fashions sticks and introduces the game among the Arikara. Later the young man encounters an old hag who begs him to carry her across a river on his back (The "Lucky Man and the Buffalo" variant begins at this point). He consents, but finds that the old woman (the supernatural buffalo cow of his earlier encoun ter in another guise) has magically fastened herself to his back and cannot be removed. To his great humiliation she refers to him as her husband. Various means are tried to remove her from the young man's back, but not until a poor boy with great supernatural powers appears can she be dis lodged. Using magical lightning arrows tipped with flint, and symbolic of the four directions, the boy removes the old woman and she is burned in a great fire (in the "Lucky Man" version Red-headed wood pecker and Yellowhammer remove the old woman). The following day, however, the voices of a child crying and a woman are heard at the place where the old woman was burned. The woman's voice accuses the young man of having burned her and her child. The young man is tormented by the voices, but they finally go away and he is able to sleep. In his dreams, however, he again sees the hoop-and-pole game, the hoop representing the Buffalo cow woman. The following day a woman and a child in a tipi are seen where the ashes of the fire had been. The young man goes to investigate. The tipi is gone but he sees and follows a young woman wearing a new buffalo robe who is leading a child (the supernatural buffalo cow woman and her calf in yet another guise). He feels compelled to fol low the woman and her child but can never seem to catch up with them, though the calf trots back to give encouragement and assistance from time to time. Finally the woman relents and allows the young man to join her and the calf, their child. The buffalo woman and the calf lead the young man to the domain of the Buffalo people. Forewarn ed, he gives each bison he meets a gift of eagle feathers to keep them from killing him, but runs out of feathers before all of them have been bribed. The Buffalo people therefore decide to kill him. The young man is forced into various contests with the Buffalo people but, with the aid of his calf-son, he manages to outwit them. Finally they attempt to charge him and stamp or hook him to death. Again forewarned, the young man erects a supernatural barrier of flint and the Buffalo people break their horns when they attempt to hook him (in the "Lucky Man" variant he is raised high above the charging bulls by means of his magical head feather). The Buffalo people finally admit the superiority of "two-legged" medicine and decide to send the young man, the supernatural buffalo cow, and their child, the calf, to the Indian village for presents of eagle feathers and native tobacco. In return they will offer themselves as food to the Indians in the future. They now change the young man into a bison and he and his wife and child lead the herd to the Arikara village. In human guise the young man, wife, and child enter the village and collect the gifts, after which the buffalo offer themselves to the Arikara in a hunt. The Buffalo game (hoop and pole) is then given to the Arikara by the chief of the Buffalo peo ple and the buffalo calf teaches them the Buffalo ceremony. Like the preceding tale, the legend of "The Five Turtles and the Buffalo Dance" is replete with fertil ity symbolism. Five soft-shell turtles come out of the Missouri River and enter an Arikara village. Four of them are given gifts of eagle feathers but the fifth is given black feathers to wear on his head. When this turtle sees that its head feathers are black it be comes angry and goes back into the river. The other four turtles remain with the tribe and when they die their bodies are made into drums (rawhide drums are later made in imitation of the turtle drums). A Buffalo dance is organized using these turtles as drums. The people dance four days and four nights. 244</page><page sequence="5">During the dance a mysterious personage appears. He has magpie feathers sprouting from his head, a costume of animal hides, and buffalo beards around his ankles and waist. His face is painted in many colors (evidently this is the fifth turtle, the one given the black feathers, in human guise). The mysterious personage does an obscene dance using a large dildo, pretending that he wishes to mount the women in the crowd. One of the young girls in the village was never per mitted to venture out of the lodge while the Buffalo dance is in progress. Overcome by curiosity, she persuades her parents to let her peep out from behind a rawhide screen at the lodge entrance. Finally she becomes bold and comes out from behind the hide. The mysterious personage sees her and pretends to mount her. The girl becomes pregnant and gives birth to a monster child. The child disappears shortly after being born and is found standing under a sacred bundle in the medi cine lodge, grinning at his discoverers. The child already appears to be two years old and has teeth. It resembles its father and walks about constantly. The people in the village are terrified, so they kill the monster child and throw it into the Missouri River. When the mysterious personage hears of the death of his child, he secures the assistance of a powerful shaman who parts the river and recovers the child's corpse. The shaman then splits a great stone overlooking the Missouri River and he and the mysterious personage bury the monster child in the cleft. The mysterious personage then returns to the village and marries the mother of the monster child. The Arikara genesis myth attributes the Buffalo society to Mother corn, the culture heroine of the Arikara. In this account Neshanu, the Creator, after Mother corn has led the tribe out from the under world and through a number of perilous adventures on this earth, commands her to build the Medicine lodge. The lodge is built with its entrance to the east and Wonderful grandfather (the sacred stone) and Wonderful grandmother (the sacred cedar) are placed before it. At this juncture a tall column of black dust is seen rising from the top of the sacred cedar, and Mother corn is advised to place eagle feathers on the tree in place of it. Mother corn now enters the Medicine lodge alone. Inside she finds groups of men (the original medicine societies) sitting around the outer circle of lodge posts with their heads bowed and their knees drawn up. They neither speak to her nor glance up. After a while those at her left (the Ghosts) look up and greet her and she goes to them. They teach her their secrets. She then goes, in order, to the Moon, Bear, Buffalo, Night, Beaver (Principal medicine), Black-tail deer, Duck and Kohnit groups and re ceives their teachings. Now all the people in the lodge assume their true (animal) form and go up, in a whirling cloud of dust, through the smoke hole of the lodge. "Thus did the people receive the rites of the medicine lodge" (Curtis 1909:84). The legend then continues, but its content is not germane here. RITUALS OFTHE ARIKARA BUFFALO SOCIETY In the Arikara conception of the universe each of the semi-cardinal quarters of the horizon is conse crated to one of four elements, four guardians under God. Thus the southeast quarter is consecrated to the Sunrise, and the southwest quarter to the Thunder, which implies water, necessary element of all life. The northwest quarter is consecrated to the Wind and all movement of air, and the northwest is consecrated to Night. In addition, each of the four quarters has a second significance, and in this second grouping of powers or elements the south west quarter is dedicated to the guardian spirit or genius of the bison (Gilmore 1926:76; Will 1934:14). This explains the customary position of the Buffalo society and its bundle in the Arikara Medicine lodge, which is at the southwest (Fig. 1). This directional dedication was said to be in recognition of the divine promise through Mother corn, the mediator, that the buffalo should be the principal gift from the animal people to humanity for their sustenance and support (Gilmore 1926:76). Will describes the costume of the members of the Buffalo society when they took part in the ceremon ies of the Medicine Lodge (Will 1934:17): They were painted red and black and wore head dresses of buffalo horns; two had complete buffalo-head masks and blew bone whistles. The calves of the legs, chest and back are black, the upper legs and abdomen red, the chin black and the upper part of the face red. They carry a small black rattle. Before them are placed two buffalo skulls. The Buf falo band has very strong medicine and specializes in broken bones and serious wounds. This description is valuable but we cannot accept at face value Will's statement that two members of the society wore "complete buffalo-head masks," nor that they blew on bone whistles. Will saw the Buf falo society perform in 1922 and again in 1924, and ostensibly his description of their costuming and painting is based upon what he saw then. Curtis' photographs of the Buffalo men in 1908, however, show neither buffalo masks nor bone whistles, but rather the horn and scalp bison headdresses and cane whistles which remain part of the Buffalo 245</page><page sequence="6">society medicine bundle to this day. We conclude that Will was either a poor observer (as seems to be the case with respect to the "bone" whistles) or that he was describing an idealized pattern of costuming described by his informants which had disappeared years earlier. Each of the eight groups in the Arikara Medicine fraternity had its own separate ceremonies. They also joined with the others in the performances of the fraternity as a whole, which were held in the Medicine lodge. The ceremonies formerly employed by the Arikara Buffalo society to call the bison were apparently never observed by any one who has left us an eye-witness account of it. Fortunately, a brief description of one such ceremony is included in the preamble to one version of the legend "Why the Buffalo No Longer Eat People," the version re counted by Snowbird (Dorsey 1904:40-44). Be cause of its ethnographic importance this preamble is quoted in full here: A long time ago, while the Arikara lived together in the vil lage, it was customary to hunt in the spring. The story I am about to tell was told to me by my father; for I was very small when this story was told by the priests: On one of these hunts, the people failed to find any buf falo. Women and children began to cry from hunger. The men took long journeys hunting buffalo, but they could not find any buffalo. At last the chief was approached by the women and asked to call on the priests for aid. The chief then took the sacred pipe from his bundle, filled it and took it to the lodge of the priests of the Knot-in-the Tree (Critatao) bundle. The chief priest took the pipe, smoked it, and offered the smoke to the gods. After smok ing, he said: 'It is well. We will open the bundle and call on the gods to help us get buffalo. We will make an offering of gifts to the gods, so they will send buffalo.' The chief was glad, and went to this own tipi. The chief then called on the crier to tell all the people to be silent. The priest had his tipi cleaned and the bundle was taken down and the other priests were sent for. After the priests were seated and all the chiefs had entered, the priests took up the gourds and began to recite a ritual that had been given to the people by the Buffalo. After the giving of presents ? native tobacco, black handkerchiefs, robes, and blankets ? the priests stopped singing. The chief priest then went out and cut a long pole, brought it to the lodge and tied gifts upon the pole. The pole was then set in front of the lodge. Gifts were placed upon the pole for the southeast God, the southwest God, the northwest God, and the northeast God. Again a ritual was recited for the buffalo to come. As they recited the ritual the errand man stood by the pole and would strike at the pole with an ash stick that he had in his hand. 'Come, buffalo,' he would say, at the same time striking the pole. 'You spoke to our people 2nd promised to come when the people were in need of food.' After reciting the ritual the priests recited other rituals. The buffalo came about three days after the ceremony. The chief ordered the crier to go through the village and let the men know that a whole buffalo was needed for the cere mony. The men went out, and a whole buffalo was brought into the ceremonial lodge. All the people were then invited, and the old priest told the people the following story: (Dorsey 1904:40-41) The account then continues with the main body of the legend "Why the Buffalo No Longer Eat People," which was abstracted above. Note that in the above account the Buffalo bundle and its priesthood are termed Knot-in-Tree (Critatao), rather than Chiwiku (Shedding). Knot-in-the-Tree appears to be a variant name for the Buffalo society, or another group which conducted a Buffalo calling rite. The offering pole struck with an ash stick in their buffalo calling ceremony clearly represents the hollow cottonwood out of which the ancestral Ari kara emerged from the underworld (cf. Dorsey 1904:41). Note that the ceremony was held, not in the village Medicine lodge, but in the tipi of the bundle keeper. In its form the ceremony shows many similarities to the Arikara Bear society cere mony which Alan Woolworth and I witnessed near Nishu, North Dakota, in 1952 (Howard and Wool worth 1954). Another buffalo calling ceremony was briefly described by Lowie's Arikara informant, Bear's teeth (Lowie 1915:675). Whether or not this cere mony was also performed by the same Buffalo priesthood we cannot say: In some of the medicine societies for the calling of buffalo, a human fore-arm bone was notched and used as a musical instrument. When Bear's-teeth attended one of these cere Figure 2. Arikara Buffalo society shamans performing at 1908 Medicine lodge ceremony. Frank Heart, last keeper of the Buffalo bundle, is the man at the left (Curtis photograph). 246</page><page sequence="7">'*V.&lt;^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Figure 3. Arikara Buffalo society shamans performing at 1908 Medicine lodge ceremony. Frank Heart is the man in the center'Ourtis photograph). monies, all the members sat in a big lodge, wearing their robes with the fur side out. No drums or gourds were there, but four of the notched bones were used. Each of these was made to rest on the ground at one end, and a stick served as a rasp. When the musicians began to sing, the members danced so as to meet in the middle of the ground. They went round in imitation of buffalo. No man living is able to con duct this ceremony. Two young men with a reputation for good runners were ordered to travel all night, with the fur side of their robes out, in order to locate a buffalo herd. When they had seen the herd, they went close enough to be seen, then they waved their robes and ran as fast as pos sible, trying to conceal themselves. If very tired and about to be overtaken, they covered their heads with their robes and allowed the buffalo to pass them. Their object was to entice the buffalo into a corral with extended diverging enclo sures, in the back of which a hole was left to permit the driv ers to slip out. There was a master of ceremonies, whose place was in the center of the pen. When the buffalo were inside, the people came and shot them. This ceremony was observed only once in a long while. The use of human arm bones as musical rasps in this ceremony can be explained by reference to the same Arikara legend we noted in connection with the preceding buffalo calling rite ("Why the Buffalo No Longer Eat People"). In this tale it is explained that the "Buffalo people" formerly killed and ate humans before the tables were turned and the Ari kara acquired the ritual formerly employed by the Buffalo people. Musical rasps of human arm bones were undoubtedly part of the ritual equipment supposedly used by the Buffalo people in this mythical period. The annual ceremony in which the entire Medi cine fraternity, including the Buffalo society, took part was a very lengthy affair. It began, according to Curtis (1909:65) at the time of the ripening of squashes and continued until autumn. Since it consisted largely of legerdemain it was appropriate ly named Shunawanuti, "Magical Performance." Each afternoon the members, painted and dressed as prescribed by their medicine, danced and marched about the cedar and stone in front of the Medicine lodge, singing and calling upon the Won derful grandmother (the cedar) and Wonderful grandfather (the stone). Nights were devoted to magical performances by the medicine societies, the eight societies taking turns. The Arikara were famous for their magical per formances among the tribes of the northern Plains, and White fur traders and military men made it a point to attend them. George Will was told by Edward Hall that the Medicine lodge was known to people at the various trading stores as "the Opera," and they frequently attended the performances in the evening much as they might go to the theater (Will 1934:22). The various illusions performed by a 247</page><page sequence="8">Figure 4. Arikara Buffalo society shaman performing at 1908 Medicine lodge ceremony. Note buffalo tail whisk in the dancer's right hand (Curtis photograph). particular medicine society usually had some mystic reference to the tutelary genius or animal spirit of that group and their supposed powers to cure illness or treat wounds. Because of this the identity of the various medicine societies can often be deduced from a description of their magic. The earliest eye-witness account of Arikara leger demain is that offered by the trader Pierre A. Tabeau, who witnessed performances in the period 1803-1805. He writes (Tabeau, Abel ed. 1939: 187-189): Each medicine man possesses also for his own benefit some knowledge of the subtle tricks by which he performs his magic works and, as these physical wonders appeal to the senses, they draw forth more admiration and reverence than all the other knowledge. Every year in the month of September a great performance begins among the Ricaras and lasts from fifteen to twenty days. Comedians, jugglers, sorcerers of every kind assemble in the evening in a large main building, called the medicine lodge, where they have gourmandized all day at the expense of the spectators. In order to learn something on this subject, I thought I ought to assist at it for once and I confess that one must be a little Ricararisexo endure the foolishness of most of the perform ers. One put a handful of ashes into a [p. 188] hat, which he turned to vermillion after having put the latter into the lining of the frame. Another drove a pointed horn into a flint and one has to be blind not to see that he made a hole before hand. This man put on the fire an old, dry bone and, after having broken it easily, if one judges correctly, draws fresh marrow from it, which he swallows. That man breaks a whistle into pieces, much to the regret of a youth, who hur ries out crying and finds it again at the bottom of the river. True he could have had under his belt a dozen of them simi lar to the broken one. I was indignant at having come almost two leagues to witness such nonsense. The most trying thing is that this beginning of great acts occupies half of the night because of their being repeated and the suffering one endures is doubled on witnessing the applause; but I thought I was compensated at the sight of the tricks which I certainly did not expect from the most dull-witted of all the Savages. I saw a man, named Scarinau, absolutely naked, his hands empty, the lodge well lighted, show to me, near by, a leather garter and, after having rolled it in his hands, throw it on the ground, changed into a living adder. He took it up and showed it to me again, a garter. He repeated the same trick ten times without giving the least hint as to the means that he employed. A man all in black comes stealthily behind one of the actors and, with all his force, deals him a blow with a hat chet upon his head. The sound of the blow leaves no doubt that he really received it. All the spectators and the medicine men yell horribly; but, after many contortions, one of them undertakes to cure him and the dead is brought to life. Another shoots a gun through the body of his compan ion who falls down upon his back, dead. The blood gushes forth from two openings, showing that the bullet has gone through the body; but, after a great many grimaces and lam entations, he is also mysteriously healed. (p. 189] Some thrust a knife blade through the hand, pierce the arms, the thighs, the tongue, and all these wounds, so apparent, merely result in making the power of the doctors shine. Finally, to crown the work, an elderly man, showing all the symptoms of despair and transported by rage, plunges a barbed arrow into his heart. He falls weltering in his blood. The actors, not being able to withdraw the arrow without leaving the barb in the body, seize the point to make it pass through. The spectator really believes that he sees the feath ers gradually enter and the arrow, all bloody, come out on the other side under the shoulder blade. I cite only these five cases as they are the most striking and could scarcely be better done. . . . Undoubtedly the "horn through flint" trick noted by Tabeau belonged to the Buffalo society. It pro bably had reference to the barrier of flint erected by "Man-Who-Kills-Game-Easily" in the "Buffalo Wife and the Javelin Game" legend abstracted earlier in this paper. The "fresh marrow" trick, since Tabeau says it was performed by the same man, was un doubtedly Buffalo society magic as well. Henry M. Brackenridge, who visited the Grand River villages of the Arikara in 1811, describes no specific magical acts, but does note the prevalence of such performances in the tribe (Brackenridge 1904:125): They have some notion of a supreme being, whom they call the "Master of Life," but they offer him no rational wor ship, and have but indistinct ideas of a future state. Their devotion manifests itself in a thousand curious tricks of slight of hand, which they call magic, and which the vulgar amongst them believe to be something supernatural. They are very superstitious. Beside their magic, or medicine lodge, in which they have a great collection of magic, or sacred things, every one has his private magic in his lodge, or about his person. Our next account of Arikara magic comes from Prince Maximilian, writing in the early 1830's (Wied Neuwied 1906 vol. 2:393-394): The Arikaras practice a number of strange tricks and jug gleries. They are remarkably dexterous in sleight of hand performances, which they are said to have learned from a celebrated juggler. They institute medicine feats at which entire comedies are performed. One, for instance, disguised in a bear's skin, with the head and claws, imitates the mo tions and voice of the animal so accurately that he can not be 248</page><page sequence="9">Figure 5. Arikara Buffalo society shaman, 1908 Medicine lodge ceremony (Curtis photograph). distinguished from a real bear. He is shot; the wound is plainly seen, and blood flows; he drops down [p. 394] and dies ? the skin is stripped off and at last the man appears safe and sound. On another occasion a man's head is cut off with a saber and carried out. The body remains bleeding, without the head, and this headless trunk dances merrily about. The head is then replaced but with the face to the back. The man continues to dance but the head is seen in the right position and the man who was beheaded dances as if nothing had happened to him. The bleeding wound is rub bed with the hand, it disappears, and all is in order again. Men are shot, the blood flows; the wounds are rubbed and they come to life again. The Arikaras perform all these tricks with such consummate address, that the illusion is com plete, so that most of the French Canadians believe in the reality of all these wonders. Another chronicle of Arikara magicians which provides detailed description is that of Father De Smet, penned in the 1840's (De Smet 1969: 250-251): The jugglers or conjurors of the Arikaras enjoy a good rep utation, and exercise considerable influence over their cred ulous countrymen; they pretend to have communication with the spirit of darkness. They will fearlessly plunge their arm in boiling water, having previously rubbed it with a cer tain root; they also swallow without ill effect, substance of fire, as well as shoot arrows against themselves. The follow ing is one of the most singular of their tricks, and one which the Indian sorcerer was unwilling to perform in my pre sence, because my medicine (meaning my religion) was superior to his. He had his hands, arms, legs, and feet tied with well knotted cords; he was then inclosed in a net, and again in a buffalo skin. The person who tied him had prom ised him a horse if he extricated himself from his bonds. In a minute after, the savage, to the amazement of the spec tators, stood before them perfectly free. The commandant of the neighboring fort offered him another horse, if he would reveal to him his secret. The sorcerer consented, say ing, "Have thyself tied; I have at my command ten invisible spirits; I will detach three of them and put them at thy ser vice; fear them not, they will accompany thee every where, and be thy tutelary genii." The commandant was disconcerted, or unwilling to make the trial, and thus the matter terminated. The "arm in boiling water" trick, like the ability to swallow live coals mentioned in the above account, are both associated with the "Sioux" medicine society of the Arikara, also known as Mother Night, Young Dog, Rabbit, Dakota, Blackbird, and Grass. These tricks were associated with the Dakota HeySka or contrary cult, as well as the Hot dance and other early forms of the Grass dance in many Plains tribes. The "Houdini" escape trick is, of course, associated with the Shaking tent ceremony and its cognates (such as the Dakota Yuwipi ceremony) over a great part of northern North 249</page><page sequence="10">Figure6. Arikara Buffato society shaman, 1908 Medicine lodge ceremony. Note pile of offerings in the background (Curtis photograph). America. Its precise Arikara associations are not known, but it could very well have been a Buffalo society act. Another fine eye-witness account of Arikara jugglery is that of General Phillippe de Trobriand, military commander at Ft. Stevenson from 1867 1869, who observed the performances at Like-a Fishhook village in 1867. General de Trobriand describes the sacred cedar, standing in the plaza before the medicine lodge, but he completely mis understood its religious character (1951:93): ... in the middle of this plaza there stands a young tree so carelessly planted that it died before it took root. It is directly opposite the entrance of the "medicine lodge" . . . He then describes the various societies dancing and singing around this "tree," a performance he con sidered an utter bore (de Trobriand 1951:94). That evening he attended the magical performances in the medicine lodge, where seats had been reserved for him and his interpreter, Gareau (de Trobriand 1951:95-98): These places consisted of a low bench with four legs, six or eight inches high; the only furniture of the kind which it had been possible to procure in the village. They had placed it at the right in the front row of the places reserved for the spectators, which section is comprised in the space between the door and a line marked by the two first of the four posts which hold up the roof. The section in the middle and toward the back was reserved exclusively for the per formers. In the center of the building under the opening in the roof which permits the starry vault to be seen through the blackened dome of the smoke hole the round fireplace held a bright fire of pieces of dried branches. The flame which rises there is the only light to illuminate the spectacle. I noticed that on the side where the artists perform their tricks, there is raised a little screen in a way to cast a pro tecting shadow at the point on the ground where they oper ate. One Indian is especially charged with the task of keep ing up the fire with little armfuls of dry wood. When we took our places the first part of the program had commenced. It consisted of selections in instrumental and vocal music executed simultaneously by the four bands of actors. The members of each of these were grouped separ ately, seated on some mats about a great drum that the chief of the orchestra beat in time with the rattles with which each musician was armed. This rythmic sound was accompanied by a barbarious chant in which one could distinguish from time to time a solo, taken up invariably by the choir. In vain I tried to distinguish some melody. The four diabolic orches tras howling and drumming at the same time each upon a different measure, as if each wished to drown out the others under its burst of noise, formed the most abominable hodge-podge that one could imagine, in the midst of which the only thing appreciable was a discord fit to set the teeth on edge. Gareau explained to me that the subject of these ferocious cries was an invocation to the Great Spirit to ob tain from him always the same things; health, absence of diseases and success in the hunt and in war. Very few spec tators assisted at this "overture" which lasts regularly for a half hour. The uproar decreased at last and expired with lugubrious groans and muffled grumblings. Then all was silent, the per formance commenced. It consisted simply of bits of oratory varied with dances and songs. As in each case, a single band delivered itself in turn to these musical exercises, I was able to recognize the general character, of which I am going to try to give an idea; each song is a single phrase which starts with the very highest notes delivered in falsetto at the top of the voice and dies away in deep bass notes in a sort of gut 250</page><page sequence="11">tural and muffled growling. The most complicated of these songs have refrains of a few piercing notes howled by the leaders of the orchestra upon which the chorus immediately take up the principal motif. The minor key prevails generally in these outbursts and the six-eight measure occurs very fre quently. For the rest, not a bit of harmony; nor attempt at a second part; everywhere and always a unison of all the crud ity of the loudest and most forced noise. The first band advanced between the farthest posts in the costume which generally prevailed, that is to say, with noth ing on but breech clouts and ornaments. Ranged in a line the band sang without a drum but always with rattles. During this time the first Indian at the right began to run around the fireplace with a sort of half arrested step to the right and to the left accompanied by a clapping of the hands in the air and a stamp of the foot. At the second turn a sec ond Indian joined the first, at the third turn a third Indian, and so on until all seven or eight had made the full round to gether, always singing. Then a buffalo hide was stretched out on the floor behind the further posts and at a good dis stance from the spectators. A gourd was placed upon it and covered by turning over the hide onto it so that it showed up as a hump in the robe. Then a performer advanced from among the spectators and pretended to crush the gourd under his heels tramping about in the place whence it had been withdrawn by a thread. This done the band gathered about the robe, turned it back to show the broken pieces of the gourd, then covered them again. The trick consisted in making the gourd whole again. The songs and the turns about the fireplace recommenced, then the band grouped itself anew about the robe to fold it back, in such a way that what passed was partly hidden from the spectators. Then one of them rushed forward triumphantly, holding in his hand the gourd which had been previously withdrawn. One could hardly be a magician in a fashion more naive. The second band then presented itself, sang and ran about just like the first one; then one of them advanced holding an ear of maize in his hand; he held it by the butt against the pit of his stomach and pretended with a great show of strength to bury it in his flesh. When at length he ceased his efforts the ear remained sticking horizontally, fastened to his skin. The trick was done. The third band poured a bowl of maize on a buffalo robe, and made the robe eat it; that is to say, that the grain disap peared through it. This was nothing very marvelous. Most of the other tricks were of a similar type, a little doll fastened to the floor seized with both hands the stem of a pipe which was presented to it to smoke; a heavy necklace placed flat on the breast of a squaw wrapped in a buffalo robe remained there without anything apparent to keep it from falling to the floor; a bunch of plants which she car ried suspended from her neck gave forth a little cry when one pressed it, just like the little whistling dogs with which one amuses the children. The only thing which was a little less banal was the per fect imitation of the growling of bears in a semi-obscurity arranged by design. The actors bore upon their heads, heads of bears or wolves with the hides wrapped about their shoulders and wore necklaces of bear claws and the paws of bears fastened by bands to the arms and shoulders. We did not stay till the performance was over although they spoke of Indians swallowing arrows just as our jugglers swallow wooden swords, and of their leaping about in the fire like the "incombustible Spaniard." The heat had be come suffocating and the dust was intolerable. Figure 7. Night or "Sioux" society shamans dancing around the sacred cedar and the sacred stone, 1908 Medicine lodge ceremony (Curtis photograph). De Trobriand makes the interesting observation that the Mandan and Hidatsa, who shared Like-a Fishhook village with the Arikara, apparently took no interest in the performances on this occasion (de Trobriand 1951:98): I don't believe that there were any Gros Ventres or Man dans among them. These two tribes furnish no actors for such performances, and it is seldom that they are spec tators. Of the acts described by de Trobriand, the "magic gourd" performance is probably associated with the Ghost society, since it came first, and they were the prime society, temporally speaking. The "robe eating corn" trick is probably a Buffalo society trick and the "magical doll" act can with some certainty be assigned to the Deer or Elk shamans, since such a doll was one of their principal medicine properties (Will 1934:17). The "growling bear" performance, of course, was performed by the Bear group. The societal associations of the other tricks we do not know. One of the best accounts of the annual ceremony of the Arikara medicine fraternity is that of W. J. Hoffman (1884). Hoffman's account of the Buffalo society's "magic bullet" trick, especially, vividly captures the high drama of this performance, wide spread in North America and usually associated with 251</page><page sequence="12">Figure 8. Members of the Arikara medicine fraternity massed to pray before the medicine lodge, 1908 Medicine lodge ceremony. The head priest, identified by his otterskin turban, is at viewer's left (Curtis photograph). either Bear or Buffalo shamans. Hoffman, after describing the construction of the Arikara medicine lodge and its interior arrange ments, goes on to describe the proceedings as fol lows (Hoffman 1884:528-532): On the left side of the hall, seated on robes, were eight warriors completely nude, but having armbands and rings of metal, bead necklaces, feathers, and holding in the hand a small gourd rattle containing grains of corn and gravel. Im mediately opposite the entrance was a group of four Indians similarly attired. At the left also was a troupe of six or eight musicians whose duty it was to beat on two drums. These were made of two washtubs with the bottoms removed and replaced by a fresh hide, which in drying, was nicely stretched. These drums were suspended by means of four stakes, so as to keep them off the ground, which would have deadened the sound. To this group belonged two women who, in singing, took a high part, and the whole provided a fair approximation of a Scottish bagpipe. Some old men walked gravely about, issuing orders and taking care of the fire and the torches which were hung on the interior posts. The announcement that the ceremony was about to be gin was signalled by a roll of the two drums, the one a little faster than the ticking of a grandfather's clock, the other slower but of the same intensity. Then the singers began, following the rhythm of the drums, but on a very high note, gradually descending to the lower notes. This song lasted about fifteen minutes. Shortly after this council had begun, the warriors who were to figure in the ceremony rose and began to dance together, hopping twice on one foot and then twice on the other. In this manner they gradually mov ed to center stage and formed a half circle facing the spec tators.This dance was merely an introduction to what fol lowed. After a short rest, the music began again, and an Indian carrying a pole about eight feet in length, at the upper end of which was attached a mounted gull, came to the cen ter of the free area. At the moment when this man raised the bird, the other dancers formed a circle around him, singing first on a high note, then gradually lowering their voices until they arrived at a bass note which gradually diminished until nothing was perceived except for the movement of the body. Then one heard the spirit of the bird, as if the voice came from the body of the animal attached to the end of the pole. This song was repeated and, as the weak sounds seemed to issue from the body of the bird, the audience lis tened and shivered. A subsequent examination revealed that the pole was hollow, and near the bird was a small whis tle which the performer activated by means of a small reed at the lower end of the pole, into which he blew without the audience seeing him. Following this performance wood was thrown on the fire so as to produce a bright flame. The dancers formed a circle and began to hop with a limping step, twice on one foot, twice on the other, while the drums continued to beat and the women again took up their songs on the sharpest tone. Little by little the movements of the dance slowed and be came more even, and the music less strident. The dancers opened the circle and formed a horseshoe shape, the open ing toward the audience. One now observed on the ground a small doll dressed as a warrior, about five or six inches high, made of wood and rags, but well painted and orna mented with feathers. When the music had ended, one of the principal dancers continued to dance alone, quietly be fore this small image, begging it in various ways to join in the 252</page><page sequence="13">Figure 9. Members of the Arikara medicine fraternity entering the medicine lodge. The Buffalo society shamans bring up the rear (Curtis photograph). festivities, imploring the spirit of the warrior, which it was supposed to represent, to affirm its presence and show that it approved of the ceremony by dancing. And, little by little, one observed the doll keeping time, finally following the choreography of the dancers which surrounded it. One could not see the finest thread attached to the doll, and this act was admittedly well done. On another visit to these performances, the introductory act was to produce the spontaneous growth of a prairie tur nip {pomme blanche) from the floor of the interior of the lodge. The dancers passed slowly over the entire surface of the lodge floor. Then, suddenly stopping, they pointed out to the public leaves sprouting from the root. One of the mus icians pulled it up and passed it through the rows of the aud ience so that all might see it. It is useless to point out that the plant had been placed there during the day before the show. We will not describe the other similar acts, and will pass on to the scenes that ended the ceremony and which always took place on a Monday. Directly outside the medicine lodge, to the right and left of it, is a large plaza fronted by earthlodges for the well-to-do Indians, and in the middle are erected tents, some of canvas, some of buffalo hides, some of boughs and rags. Those who were to take part in the acts foregathered early in a large lodge to dress and paint before their public appearance. The spectators were massed on the roofs of the adjoining lodges, painted white and with feather ornaments, or other wise decorated to honor the occasion. Long before the per formances began the drum was sounded, but finally the noise ceased and the warriors came out the lodge entrance and took their places in their respective tents, arranged around the area as we have earlier described. At this moment one of the warriors, disguised as a bison, came out of one of the tents imitating the bellowing of the animal and rushed toward the medicine lodge, followed by six warriors who acted as if they were truly hunting the buffalo. They went from tent to tent seeking the beast and ended by going into the lodge where he had taken refuge. A short song was heard and the "buffalo" ran out and rushed out along one side of the area and took refuge in the lodge of a chief. The warriors imitated the gestures and movements of hunters who had just lost their quarry. This continued in front of each of the lodges until the buffalo went toward the medi cine lodge as if it were going to graze. Then the hunters ap proached it and one took a few steps forward, took his mus ket, and loaded it showing the musket ball to his fellows, then aimed carefully and shot the "buffalo." Three women then approached the fallen "bison" and removed his robe, exposing the wound. They applied various herbs and then carried the warrior to his tent, from which he shortly issued completely healed. The blood was merely colored water which one of the women adroitly placed on the victim as she lifted the buffalo robe. The next animal hunted was a rabbit. The warrior who played this part was naked except for a breechclout, and the rest of his body was painted with clays of various hues so as to imitate, more or less, the coloration of this animal (Lepus callotis). Instead of running, this Indian hopped on all fours, and the way in which he did it was a credit to his skill as a performer. He followed the same route as the "buffalo" and was followed by six other hunters who imitated the hunting of this quarry. Later a duck appeared, and the Indian imitated the quack-quack of this fowl. He too was pursued and killed, in the usual manner, by the hunters. An owl followed, then a deer, and other animals, each per fectly imitated in terms of its appearance, cry, and move ments. The principal performance took place at the end of the ceremony. A shaman presented himself to the crowd and announced to the assembly that he would be shot in the head by another Indian but would catch the musket ball in 253</page><page sequence="14">Figure 10. Members of the Bear, Buffalo, and Night societies dance around the sacred cedar and the sacred stone, 1906 'Medicine lodge ceremony (Curtis photograph). his mouth. The musket was loaded publicly, but I was not able to satisfy myself as to whether the ball was really placed in the barrel or if it was composed of some soft material, nor was I able to ascertain whether the shot was truly aimed at the shaman's head, but the Indian certainly appeared to aim at the open mouth of that worthy and, immediately afterwards, the shaman showed a musket ball which he held between his teeth. About five or six years ago, during one of these performances, an accident occurred to one of these shamans, who let himself be killed rather than admitting fear. In order to show his power to deflect musket shots, he challenged a member of the assembled crowd to shoot him in the mouth with a musket. For some reason, whether from the shaman's assistant not taking the usual precautions, or for some other reason, hardly had the challenge been made when a stranger appeared, and refusing to accept the mus ket ordinarily used in the act, used his own which was pro perly loaded. The shaman paled, but, realizing that if he ob jected he would lose all credibility, he remained outwardly calm and awaited his fate. The hammer fell, the ball pierced his head, and he died instantly. After this disaster the chal lenge element of the act was omitted and an assistant, spe cially designated, was the only one permitted to shoot, after having taken the necessary precautions. Of the above acts the "whistling gull" trick probably belonged to the Kohnit or Cormorant society, because of its bird associations, and the "dancing doll" to the Deer or Elk group. The "spontaneously sprouting turnip" trick was undoubtedly performed by Bear shamans, as the tipsina (Psoralea esculenta) is a plant with strong "Bear" associations in most northern Plains tribes. The various "hunting" acts, culminating in the killing and magical revival of the quarry can easily be identified, in terms of the quarry impersonated, with the following societies: Buffalo, Rabbit (also known by other names), Duck, Owl and Deer or Elk. The final "magic musket" performance was almost certainly performed by a powerful Bear or Buffalo society shaman. Curtis' (1909:66-69) account of the magical per formances is particularly valuable since he identifies each act with the medicine society which performed it. He did not witness these performances, which had been lost by that date (Curtis 1909:70) but secured descriptions of them from surviving mem bers of the medicine fraternity. He writes (1909: 66-69): Following is a brief description of a trick from the reper toire of each order: The leader of the Ghosts, rising, held a human skull above his head and apparently swallowed it. Then while he lay flat on the floor, face downward, another Ghost covered him with a robe, and when the leader arose the skull was seen lying on the ground. The Black-tail Deer stood forth in a row and sang; then one of them ran quickly outside, mounted to the roof, and whistled. In the distance was heard the answer of an elk, which was called closer and closer by the continued whis 254</page><page sequence="15">tling of the medicine-man. A skull of their animal was placed by the Buffalo men be side the southwestern centre-post, then all of them danced on the opposite side of the fire. Soon the skull appeared to bellow. The men of the Kohnit order stood in a row and sang a long time, then ran outside and passed several times around the cedar. They reentered, ran out again, leaped into the river, and returned into the lodge, each with two large fish in his hands. The owners of the Principal Medicine brought in a tree top, the butt about four inches thick, and set it upright in the ground in front of the platform. Then dancing around the fire with his beaverskin in his hand the Beaver medicine man at length held its nose to the tree. After a while the tree fell, ostensibly gnawed asunder by the Beaver. In perform ing another of their tricks the men of the Principal Medicine called a boy from the crowd, removed his moccasins and leggings, and stretched him on the ground. One of them, pressing the tip of a sword-shaped piece of ash against the sole of the boy's foot, caused it to disappear, apparently into his leg. Then the Beaver medicine-man "cured" the lad by bringing the sword to light, for his medicine was sup posed to mend broken limbs. Again, the leader of the Princi pal Medicine stepped forward stretching out his robe, and as the people moved back he shook it, and the gourds tied to the bundles hanging above the platform seemed to rattle. The Big Feet, wearing necklaces of duck-bills strung on otter-skin, ran to the waterside and brought back rushes, which a woman was engaged to set in the earth near the f ire place, typifying the marsh where ducks nest. Another woman was called upon, and to her they gave their neck laces, which she raised aloft to the north and then cast among the rushes. Straightway was heard a sound sup posed to be the quacking of the spirit duck that was believed to dwell in the body of the leader. As the fire died down he passed to the opposite side of the fireplace and imitated the actions of a duck, and there was heard the sound of a large flock quacking, and flapping their wings in the water. The Moon medicine-men spread a robe beside the fire, which was then permitted to die down. The leader raised the robe and swung it several times through the air, and then a light was seen streaming down through the smoke-hole, yellow like the rays of the moon. A more spectacular trick was that performed by the same order, when they began by spreading a mat of dry rushes on the ground. The leader painted a black circle around his face, others about wrists and ankles, and a black spot on his chest. Sticks were set up and the rush mat was thrown over them, forming a minia ture lodge. With a whistle and a small drum the medicine man crawled under, and when he had disappeared the fire keeper ignited the mat, which blazed fiercely. Everybody shouted in excitement. When the little lodge was burned to the ground, no trace of the man was to be seen; but some of the people, going to the river, would see him emerging from the water, beating his drum, and staggering as if ex hausted. Supported by brother medicine-men he entered the lodge and sat beside the fire, saying, "I have travelled far. I have learned that we are going to have good crops and many buffalo." A round stone painted red lay back of the Mother Night medicine-men, who wore red paint on their legs, black on their bodies, and red spots over the black on their faces. The wife of a younger member came forward; her hair was then loosened and brushed, and her face painted. She touched the stone, then all the members of the order rolled it into the fireplace, while the keeper was told to build a great fire. When the stone was supposedly red-hot, the young assis tant, who had been rubbed with medicine by the leader and encouraged to fear nothing, leaped upon it and "danced," ? in reality he touched his feet to the stone a very few times ? supporting himself by a stout staff in each hand, while the flames singed his eyebrows and skin. Quickly he leaped through the flames to the opposite side, where the leader rubbed him with an infusion of herbs. Another act of the Night medicine-men was similar to this. A large earthen ves sel was painted red, decorated with four feathers, and set beside the fire, which the keeper then replenished. The men sang while the performer danced around the fire, and all the medicine-men in the lodge gathered about in a circle, cry ing, "Hurry! Hurry!" Now a woman placed in her mouth a pinch of a mixture of pulverized willow root and an unidenti fied root, then took a sup of water and sprayed the feet and legs of the dancer. He then stepped into the jar, supporting himself with two staffs, and quickly leaped out sideways. He danced a few moments, and the leader rubbed his body with medicine. A third trick of this group was one in which the chief loaded a gun with powder, bullet and wadding. His helper danced around the fire, holding the gun aloft, and discharged it. He danced again, then held the muzzle down, when bullet and powder rolled upon the ground. After the Bear men had sung, one of them, clothed in a bear-skin, ran across the lodge, then dashed madly back and forth. Coming in front of the platform he placed his hands to his mouth and kicked the ground, and when he dropped his hands long bear-teeth protruded from his mouth. The others beat the drum and sang, and another Bear ran out. Some of the strongest men in the lodge were deputed to throw him to the ground and hold him. With a knife they made a pretence of cutting off his foreleg, and either a stuffed foreleg or an object resembling one was then thrown in front of the Bear group. They hurled it across the lodge in front of the Ghosts, while everybody cried, "Hurry! Hurry! Put it back!" One of the Bear medicine-men picked it up, ran with it to the struggling prostrate Bear, and sup posedly reunited it with his body. The skull mentioned in connection with the act of the Buffalo society was very likely the same one col lected by M. R. Gilmore in 1929, now in the collec tions of the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation (Gilmore 1926). This skull belonged to an Arikara sub-chief named Soldier. The round stone mentioned in connection with the "fire-walk ing" act of the Mother Night group was still carefully preserved in the dooryard of Mr. and Mrs. Byron Wilde in the 1950's, having been removed from the medicine lodge site some years earlier. Visitors to the Wilde home often left offerings of tobacco on this stone. Apparently the last investigator to secure infor mation regarding the Arikara medicine ceremonies and magic before the passing of the old ways was George F. Will. Most of Will's data are summarized in his 1934 paper "Notes on the Arikara Indians and their Ceremonies." Original information in Will's paper is contained in the following passages (Will 1934:40): 255</page><page sequence="16">. . . Each band had its special type of sleight of hand which had a connection with the type of cures in which it special ized. Sometimes a test of powers was announced and the peo ple were warned to keep at a distance from the lodge lest they be injured. On such occasion there would be a tre mendous uproar in the lodge for sometime, sounds of var ious animals fighting could be heard and the people would gaze at the lodge from a distance with awe and fear. James Young Eagle, chief of police at Elbowoods, whose father was Paint, a very noted medicine man, tells how One Bull of the Buffalo band would dress in the hide of a shed ding spring buffalo and go about among the people. At such times he would have great power and by merely giving an order could compel anyone to do whatever he directed them. Later in the same account (Will 1934:45-49) he describes the various performances: I shall consider first some of the exploits of the Dakota or Rabbit band who performed the hot dance. Performances of this kind are common throughout the world, and have been told as occurring among other tribes. In preparation for the display James Young Eagle says that a large flat stone would be placed in the fireplace and a brisk fire kept burn ing upon it for several days. The stone would become so hot as to almost glow by the end of that time. The fire was then raked off, leaving many hot coals on the hot stone, and the members of the band would dance barefoot on the stone and the hot coals for several minutes at a time with no appar ent injury to their feet. Members of this band would also thrust their arms to the shoulder in boiling water, and even jump bodily into large kettles in which the water was briskly boiling. My informants state that there was never any ap pearance of injury nor sign of pain after such performances. As might be expected, the specialty of this band was the treatment of burns. Mention has bee made of the struggles of the mighty powers, before which the people would be warned to keep at a distance lest they be injured by some of the powers in play. Oftentimes after these struggles several men would be brought out apparently frightfully mutilated, when they would be surrounded by the members of their respective bands, and after some singing and incantation would emerge from the center of the band whole and uninjured. One of my informants states that a brother of the late chief Sitting Bear was thus carried out of the lodge on one occa sion. His skin and flesh appeared to be cut to ribbons, his ribs showed through the flesh in places and his liver and other organs seemed to be protruding from rents in the ab dominal walls. The Bears took him in hand and he was soon entirely recovered. James Young Eagle's father, Paint, performed the follow ing feat on a number of occasions, by daylight. He would wrap himself completely in a large buffalo robe, placing a piece of eagle down at the armpit. He would then stand in the corner of the covered entrance or vestibule of the medi cine lodge. Another member of the band would stand out before the entrance at a few paces distance with his rifle, powder horn and bullets. He would hold out the powder and the bullet for the audience to examine as he slowly loaded the gun and rammed down the charge. He would then shoot directly at Paint who would apparently drop, severely wounded while the blood flowed. As usual he was carried out, surrounded by the band which would perform certain mysteries over him, after which he would walk out from the midst of the band quite uninjured. Running Wolf of the Buffalo band, still alive and active, used to stand in the center of the medicine lodge and allow another medicine man to cut off his arm. He would then pick up the arm from the place where it had been dropped and hold it up for all to see, when it would appear as the foreleg of a buffalo. After displaying it in every direction, it would be replaced against his shoulder, when it would assume its nor mal appearance and no sign of the cut would remain. There were variations of this trick. One man used to with draw behind the lodge and cut off his own arm. He would then throw it out before the entrance where it would appear as the leg of a buffalo. He would then replace it, when it would resume its normal shape. Still another man would go through the same performance, but his severed arm would appear as the forepaw of a bear. Another member of the Bear band would dress himself in the skin of a bear and amble around the fireplace imitating a bear in his actions. A second member would take up a rifle and shoot him, often several times. The first man would drop, roll about on the floor, and would bleed profusely. The medicine men would then surround him. Soon he would stand up, cough, and spit the bullets out into his hand, when he would be as well as ever. Another man would stick his tongue out, thrust a wooden skewer through it, seize his knife and cut the tongue off. The blood would pour from his mouth and in his hand he would appear to be holding the tongue of a buffalo. He would then replace it, when it would assume its normal appearance, and grow in place again. Another medicine man would thrust a long knife far down his throat; he would then turn a back somersault and break off the hilt against the ground. The blood would gush from his mouth and he would writhe about the floor apparently in great agony. A fellow medicine man would rush up, pick up the broken hilt, and insert it into the injured man's mouth. The knife would then become whole again and would be withdrawn. After certain mysteries were performed, he would be perfectly well again. Another performance of a different character represents a whole group which were the special province of certain par ticularly endowed individuals. In this case the performer would stand up at his full height and beat his sides a few times with his hands. Soon a miniature jack rabbit would leap from his mouth into his hand. It was explained that some people had small animals of different species within them. They were a sort of personal guardian. So long as the little animals were well and healthy the person could suffer no harm, but should they once sicken and die, the man was doomed. Bear's Belly, a medicine man of the Bear band who is still alive and active, formerly gave one of the most spectacular performances. He would mount to the top of the lodge, face the people, beat his breast and throw out his abdomen, sit ting with his arms spread out and abdomen protruding. A fellow member would ascend, bearing with him a war axe or tomahawk. With this he would strike Bear's Belly a heavy blow on the protruding abdomen and then retire, leaving the axe sticking in the wound. Bear's Belly would groan and cry for a time, then descend from the roof still carrying the axe in the wound. A group of the medicine men would surround him, withdraw the axe, and he would appear uninjured, and unscarred. Doubtless this performance accounts for the name given to the performer. 256</page><page sequence="17">Blue Bird of the Ghost band, who died only a year or so ago, used to fasten a thong to a long slender splint or skewer. With the splint he would pierce his head, thrust ing it in at one ear and pulling it out of the other, then pull ing the cord through after it. He would then seize the string at either end and pull it back and forth through his head, meantime groaning and crying. The string would then be withdrawn and he would be in his normal condition again. This man's specialty was the treatment of earache and pains in the head. Edward Hall, already mentioned, told of a still different type of magic, and a most spectacular one. The performer announced in the evening that he had the "fish medicine" and would display its power on the following morning. The next morning very early the people were lined up on either side of the path to the river, and at sunrise the medicine man trotted out of the lodge, naked, and advanced unhesitating ly to the river bank. There without a pause he dived into the water and immediately emerged holding in either hand a good sized living catfish. With the fish he trotted back to the medicine lodge. The above accounts embrace most of the pub lished information on Arikara magic, which was an important part of the annual ceremony of the Arikara medicine fraternity, including the Buffalo society. Most of these illusions could be duplicated by professional stage magicians today. The "magic musket" trick, in fact, was a standard act with 19th century stage magicians. Just how American Indian shamans, lacking the elaborate equipment, drapes, mirrors, false-bottomed boxes, etc. of today's illu sionists managed to achieve their startling effects is a subject well worth examination by some ethnolo gist who is also familiar with stage magic. The adroitness of the Arikara in legerdemain, and their fondness for magical exhibitions is matched only by their close linguistic and cultural relatives, the Pawnee. Like the Arikara, the Pawnee spent two or three months each fall with their annual medicine ceremony, and there are numerous and close simi larities between the performances of the two tribes. It seems certain that this ceremony developed before the two tribes separated from one another (cf. Linton 1923). Curtis describes the procedure followed by a young man who wished to join one of the Arikara societies, and also the procedure followed in select ing a new bundle keeper (1909:69-70): Connected with the medicine fraternity were several supernumeraries chosen by the members to perform the necessary manual labor. After a term as attendant a man had the privilege of buying the medicine of any order and becoming a member. Wishing to join the organization, a man first offered a pipe of tobacco to the cedar, crying the while, then he entered the lodge and extended the pipe first to the firekeeper, then to each group in order, beginning with the Ghosts. Finally making his way to the group he wished to join, he held out the pipe to their leader, but the medicine-man clenched his hands as if unwilling to accept it. The aspirant, however, forced them open and thrust the pipe into them, an act taken as a sign that he was to be initi ated. The pipe wasthen smoked in turn by all the medicine-men in the lodge. The novitiate stripped and was painted, not carefully on this first day, but rather hurriedly, and the painter received his clothing in payment. Medicine was rub bed over his body, and he drank a decoction of roots. From the hour of joining he assisted in the singing, learning thus the numerous songs of his medicine, and he was given some small part in the performance of tricks. He was, in fact, now servant to the selected group instead of to the entire frater nity. From time to time he was given further instruction in the mysteries of his medicine, and for each new lesson a fee was levied. Instruction was apparently not given willingly: there was no desire to help the novitiate become an adept at once. The initiation rather was in the nature of a contest be tween the older members and the younger, the latter striv ing to be taught immediately, the former bargaining for the amount of the payment, reserving their secrets and parting with them only after much persuasion and many promises. When the leader of a group of the medicine fraternity died, the one who had learned the most from him became his successor. The number of members for each group was not fixed. It seems to have been usually four to six, though it must have been considerably larger in the days when the Arikara prospered. Curtis states (1909:70) that the ceremonies of the Medicine fraternity as a whole were suppressed by agency officials about 1885. He persuaded the surviving members to stage a performance in 1908 so that he could photograph and record it. The photographs of the ceremonies accompanying the present paper were taken by him at that time. The scene of this re-enactment was on Beaver Creek, in an earthlodge built as a Medicine lodge a few years earlier. He notes that this earthlodge was about twenty feet in diameter. The 1908 re-enactment was preceded by a cere mony, formerly held in the spring before the plant ing season, involving the opening of one of the medicine bundles left with the Arikara by Mother corn. This bundle opening was accompanied by a repetition of the Arikara genesis myth and a drama tic enactment in the nature of a prayer for a boun teous crop. One feature of this was a rite in which a willow-basket dish of water was passed to four selected women. Each woman dipped her hands in the water and stroked her body from feet to head, ending with her hand outstretched overhead and then letting the arm fall. This was a symbolic prayer for rain. A dance by the four women, carrying hoes, and four selected men, carrying wooden sword clubs, followed. In the dance the women went through the motions of hoeing the ground while the men pantomimed their duty of protecting the grow ing crops from the enemy. The original eight danc ers were replaced by others as the dance continued. 257</page><page sequence="18">This attractive dance was followed by a prayer chant delivered by a priest, accompanied by the singing and rattling of gourds by assistants. The priest prayed for the growing crops. Next a large bowl of cornmeal mush was brought in and set before the altar. This corn symbolized the enemy, and was ritually charged by the four men with the wooden sword clubs. Seizing handf uls of mush they ran with it to the medicine societies, giving a portion to a man in each, who divided it among the others in his society. Those receiving the mush burst into weeping, and each bit was handled as something precious. This act was followed by a general burst of emotion, crying and praying aloud, and offering of smoke by men to the spirits (Curtis 1909:72-73). In the meanwhile men had gone into the hills to select a cedar tree to place in front of the medicine lodge. Returning with it they left it some distance from the village. Early the following day, which was the first day of the annual ceremony of the Medicine fraternity, the women and girls went to the river and gathered dry willow boughs, and carried them to within a half a mile of the ceremonial site. From this point they were brought in ceremonially that evening. About the same time, the leader of the Bear society placed the two bearskins from that society's bundle on the roof of the lodge, and offerings were laid before them by anyone who wished. Following this the priests of the Principal medicine group went out to bring in the sacred cedar, as if they them selves had gone to the hills and selected it. After a full half hour of singing and praying around it, the priests reverently placed the cedar on the shoulders of four men, who slowly brought it towards the Medicine lodge, circling about and approaching it from the east (Curtis 1909:73). As they entered the village, women and children ran out and placed offerings of cloth on the cedar. When the principal medicine men reached a spot within a hundred yards of the lodge the cedar was deposited on the ground, where it was literally buried under offerings. Here infants and older children were brought to the medicine-men to be blessed. While praying for their good health and long life, the priests brushed each child from head to foot with a bunch of sage, thus symbolically driving away all evil from it.3 The tree was then taken into the lodge, carried around the central fire, and placed on the ground with its base toward the altar. The Beaver bundle keeper, the leader of the ceremony, further consecrated the tree by rubbing red paint on its trunk and on each branch, and by tying eagle feathers at its topmost twig following the directions of Mother corn (Curtis 1909:73-74). Meanwhile the various medicine societies had painted and dressed for the dance, each according to its prescribed form. First, the Moon society went out and danced around the sacred stone in front of the lodge. They retired, then reappeared and re peated the dance, continuing in this manner four times; then each of the other groups followed until each had danced the customary four times, at which time all came forth together. As the entire Medicine fraternity danced, there was an air of excitement in the group, and constant watching of the entryway. Finally a warning shout was heard among the dancers, and from the entrance dashed two or three men, hotly pursued by two of the Bear society men dressed in the bearskin costumes of their order. The dancers fled in every direction, pursued by the Bears, who skillfully mimicked the actions of real animals. While the Bears chased the dancers, brave individuals tried to slip up behind and hit them with sticks. To succeed in "counting coup" on a Bear was regarded as a great deed, since by doing so the individual gained some of the medicine power of the Bear. After a time the Bears returned to the Medicine lodge as though it were their den, and the other dancers crept stealthily up to the entrance, peeping in, but carefully listening for any movement. Sud denly, with a cry, the Bears rushed out again, scattering the dancers, some of them falling over one another in their eagerness to escape. This inci dent was repeated three times. Next, two Bears and two men of the Buffalo society, all four in costume, issued from the lodge. The Buffalos, like the Bears, mimicked the actions of real animals. Four times the Bears and Buffalos appeared together and then a dancer slipped up and presented the pipe to one of the Bears. With apparent reluctance the Bear ac cepted the pipe and took a puff. As he did so he emitted a groan of anguish, for now his power was broken. With his three companions he crept weakly back into the lodge, followed by all the dancers. Inside, pandemonium reigned, with men going from post to post of the Lodge, weeping and crying. Some knelt before the buffalo skull loudly moaning, and others knelt or stood about the bear skins or wailed before the Buffalo society regalia. Still others passed from one medicine society to the other, uttering the same wails and howls of anguish. Later in the day the sacred cedar was carried out and planted in the ground close to the sacred stone in front of the Medicine lodge, and again the members of the various medicine societies, including the Bears and the Buffalos, danced about them (Curtis 1909:74-75). 258</page><page sequence="19">At sundown the women went to the pile of dry willow boughs they had gathered the previous day. Forming a long line they slowly marched to the village, while people threw offerings upon their bun dles of boughs. This fuel was set down in the Medicine lodge close by the entrance. After dark began the colorful Sage dance rite. All members of the Medicine fraternity participated. They were naked except for the breechcloth and their bodies were painted with white clay. Each held in his hand a bunch of sage. They seated themselves in a large circle near the altar, around an outstretched, un worked rawhide, and began to beat upon it with long rods. To the rhythm of this simple drum they sang songs of supplication for power to drive away illness. Now willow brush was thrown on the fire, and the dancers formed a circle close about it, holding the sage before their faces to avoid inhaling the flames. As they danced, more boughs were heaped on the fire until the flames leaped almost to the roof. The singing and dancing grew wilder as the dance continued, the men constantly trying to dance as close to the fire as possible. They twisted and wriggled as they danced, turning first one side of their body and then the other to the heat as it became almost too intense for endurance. At inter vals they burst forth into wild concerted yells. Curtis comments that as one watched them from the outer space of the lodge their bodies, glowing in the bril liant firelight, seemed almost transparent. At the moment when it seemed that a human being could no longer stand such scorching heat, the music ceased and the dancers sat down around the raw hide for a period of rest. The Sage dance was re peated three more times, with brief intervals of rest. Curtis was told that formerly this portion of the rites of the Medicine lodge was observed once each on three successive nights. "Fire is sacred," a priest told him, "so our medicine-men dance around it to drive away disease. It purifies our bodies and gives us strength, and our shouting frightens illness" (Curtis 1909:75-76). On the afternoon of the next day the routine dancing of the different medicine societies was repeated. In former times this would have been repeated day after day through the season, with the nights devoted to the performance of magic by the various medicine societies (Curtis 1909:76). Another account of the non-magical portion of the ceremony is provided by Will (1934). Will describes two of the re-enactments he witnessed, those of 1922 and 1924. A few features omitted in the 1908 performance, or at any rate differing from Curtis'account of it, are noted by Will (1934:19-33). BUFFALO Start* alone; nobody eats it, and he wa? wounded. ^^Z^_P_H2p p p. j j j ||(. p f] p i j^^lli-IK r J J lUJ.Jlr, J- e r-l ^M cj"G"cirr ? r ^ ^ ^ tf^~f \jr r r?lcr J N^^P^^ Figure 11. Transcription of a song used by the Arikara Buffalo society, from Curtis (1909: 156- 157). The text was not recorded, but apparently the English phrases at the top give the gist of its meaning. In these two performances the Sage dance was per formed four times the day previous to the bringing in of the cedar tree and the Mother corn ceremony. Will notes that all of the participants, the members of the various medicine societies, went through the sweat bath to purify themselves prior to dancing the Sage dance. The evening of this first day the women brought in faggots for the fire in the medicine lodge. Early in the morning of the second day the cedar was brought in, trimmed, and temporarily erected outside the medicine lodge. A "smoke" to the cedar followed, and in the 1922 performance an offering of food was brought out and eaten by the men who had carried in the tree at this point. The head priest then painted the members of the party. A dance around the sacred stone by members of the medi cine societies followed, after which the tree bearers picked up the cedar again and carried it toward the lodge. At a point 150 feet from the doorway people began to throw offerings over the tree as it was carried along. It was put down just outside the lodge entrance and here people were blessed by the head priest. Next, all of the societies except for the Bears marched out to welcome the arrival of the sacred 259</page><page sequence="20">cedar. They re-entered and then marched out again, this time each band saluting the tree individually. The special performance of the Bear society (much as described by Curtis) followed, but on these occasions this Bear mime was followed by a similar performance of the Buffalo society. The Buffalos or Bulls, with headdresses of buffalo heads and with bone [sic] flutes, then charged out and performed in a similar way, imitating the buffalo in walk and manner. This play was repeated several times. Meanwhile in the lodge the Bears and Bulls imitated their namesakes with bel lows and roars. Some special offerings were made to the bands during this time. The bands then lined up south of the tree, and the guardians sat in a row before it (Will 1934:24). The offerings were now removed from the tree and it was carried inside the medicine lodge. Here it was placed between the altar and the fireplace. A smoke offering to the butt of the tree followed. At this time all the medicine bands, dressed and painted, were in their places. The Buffalo headdresses were on the skulls, the four bear skins were suspended over the Bears' rack (Will 1934:25). Next the cedar was blessed by members of the vari ous societies, each in the characteristic fashion of that group. The Buffalo society's blessing is described thus: Red Bear of the Buffalo band then took the rattle and the sage, and sang the Bull song a number of times, then brush ed the tree with sage (Will 1934:25). After the sacred cedar tree had been blessed and decorated it was carried outside and ceremonially erected beside the sacred stone. When it was in place four men from different bands advanced and grasped the tree. The head priest sang and the four shook the tree in time with the music. After the song, all squatted, Crow Ghost advanced with the pipe and smoked to the tree, after which the pipe went to the others who were seated. Yellow Bird of the Ghosts blew smoke over the tree and presented the pipe to it. He was fol lowed by a Buffalo, then Red Star of the Owls, then by Bear's Belly, then by other representatives of the same four bands. Perhaps these bands are associated with the four posts and the four directions. It is said that these were orig inally the only ones, the other four being added later (Will 1934:26). Dances around the cedar by the various bands fol lowed for the remainder of the afternoon, conclud ing with a joint performance by all the bands: An interval elapsed after the continuous songs and dances. Then all the bands emerged helter-skelter carrying pipes and paraphernalia, with two Bulls having the flutes, repeating the pursuit and horse-play of earlier in the day. All formed in a compact group, singing as they marched around the tree. Offerings of robes were brought to the different bands which were not regarded and were walked over, but which were later taken up. All came out again as before, but this time the Bears chased the others. Then all faced east and cried. They faced the lodge and sang at the door, after which all entered, two delaying at the tree to mourn a moment (Will 1934:27). Finally Crow Ghost, the head priest, emerged from the lodge alone, slowly and quietly approached the cedar, smoked to it, and returned inside again. This concluded the ceremony. The performers inside the lodge then distributed amongst themselves the various offerings, includ ing gifts of food, upon which they feasted. Follow ing their meal the medicine societies continued sing ing and drumming within the lodge far into the night. This was apparently a substitution for the magical performances of earlier years. It was a beautiful night with a full moon, and at about mid night the bands all sallied forth from the lodge in a body, and the different bands made a circuit of the camp singing their individual band songs before the tents of those whom they wished particularly to honor. These songs, especially those of the Buffalo and Bear bands, were particularly effective (Will 1934:29). Abbreviated versions of the medicine ceremony were held by the Arikara until sometime in the 1930's. These latter day performances, like those described by Curtis and Will, lacked the magical per formances of an earlier day.4 By the time of the pre sent writer's first visits to the Ft. Berthold reserva tion (1951) the annual ceremonies had ceased, though a few of the society bundles were still active and had a cadre of priests and young male attend ants. A group of older men known as the "Arikara Medicine Singers" would still gather occasionally in private homes to practice the songs of the various societies. Apparently, however, the Garrison dam and reservoir, with its attendant dislocation of Indian communities, together with continuing White acculturation, sounded the death knell for these, the most traditional, aspects of Arikara culture. CONTENTS OF THE ARIKARA BUFFALO SOCIETY BUNDLE Because of its unique nature, it is fitting that the contents of the Arikara Buffalo society bundle be described with the same care usually devoted to archaeological materials. In fact, the bundle consti tutes an assemblage of items older than most of the Arikara items recovered by my crews during our ex cavations at Like-a-Fishhook village in 1951 and 1952. Except for a few substitutes for items which were worn out and had to be replaced (and which can be reaily recognized as such) most of the pieces in the bundle which can be dated seem to stem from the first half of the 19th century. We suspect that 260</page><page sequence="21">the bundle, as a whole, was assembled during a rel atively brief time well before 1850. We have numbered the various items composing it from 1 through 33. Because they may prove to be important we have also noted three subgroupings of items within the bundle. The two bison head dresses, the principal items in the bundle, are Subgroup A. Two separately wrapped component bundles are designated Subgroup B ("Red" com ponent bundle) and Subgroup C ("Plaid" compon ent bundle). When it was received for study the original covering of the complete bundle, if any for merly existed, was missing and the contents were stored in a footlocker. Figure 12 shows the Buffalo society bundle as a whole, the headdresses (Sub group A) in the center, the "Red" component bun dle (Subgroup B) partially unwrapped at viewer's left, the "Plaid" component bundle (Subgroup C), at viewer's right. Subgroup A (Fig. 12, center) Item 1. Buffalo headdress with horns and downy golden eagle "breath" feathers attached. This headdress is 76 cm. long, with a maximum width of 30 cm. It consists of a headdress worn by one of the dancers in the Buffalo dance, and is made from the tanned hide of a bison head with the long wooly hair remaining. Lightly polished bison horns, with a length of 29.5 cm., are attached at either side of the front of the headdress, which is fashioned into a sort of cap to fit the wearer's head. This fitted part of the headdress measures about 20 cm. in diameter, the remainder of the hide hanging down the wearer's back. There is no additional foundation or cap in this headdress. The horns are attached on either side of the front of the headdress 26 cm. apart, measuring around the circumference of the cap in front. Four equally spaced holes were drilled around the circumference at the base of each horn, each of them 8 cm. in diameter. A buckskin thong was threaded through each of the holes and two holes, 1 cm. apart, were punched in the bison hide below. Each thong is tied tightly by means of an "Indian knot" (a half bow) on the inner side of the cap. These four thongs serve to anchor each horn securely in place and cause the horns to stand erect on either side of the wearer's head when the headdress is worn. A long (22 cm.) thong is attached on either side of the headdress just below each horn through a hole punched in the hide. These two thongs serve as a chin strap to tie the headdress in place when worn. As stored, the "chin strap" thongs of the headdress are firmly tied, by means of an "Indian knot," to the thongs of item Figure 12. Arikara Buffalo society bundle. Headdresses (Subgroup A) in center, Subgroup B ("Red" component bundle), partially unwrapped, is at left, Subgroup C ("Plaid" component bundle), also partially unwrapped, is at viewer's right. 2, the other buffalo headdress, at a point 11 cm. from the headdress. In addition to the pair of polished buffalo horns the outer (hair) side of the headdress is adorned with a number of downy "breath" feathers from below the tail of the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos). Six of these remain but originally there were probably seven (the ritual number). They were attached by lifting a bit of buffalo wool from the top of the headdress and wrapping the base of the downy eagle plume to this with a bit of moistened sinew. The plumes are spaced as follows: measuring from the front of the headdress, and following the rounded contour of its upper surface, the first is in the center of the headdress 30 cm. from the front or "brow." It is 18 cm. long. Four cm. to its right (as viewed from the front) a buckskin thong is knotted around a twist of bison hair. This was probably the site of another plume, now missing. Fourteen cm. further back, and spaced 13 cm. apart are two more plumes, attached directly by their bases to the bison hair. One is broken off; the other is 16 cm. long. Fifteen cm. back from these, and 9 cm. apart are two more plumes, also attached to the hair. Both are 16 cm. long. Twelve cm. back from these and 7 cm. apart, so as to hang beyond the hair of the head dress in back, there were originally two more. The one on the left is missing but the sinew wrapping attests its former presence. The remaining plume is 17 cm. long. The condition of the hide attests its great age. At the lower ends two holes, with stretch marks surrounding them, indicate that the hide was tanned by pegging it out on the ground in the traditional Plains Indian manner. The hide is brittle and has been repaired at two points in the front or "cap" area and at one place on the tail. The hide has also been gathered and seamed at a point below the horn 261</page><page sequence="22">on the viewer's left. This headdress, as worn, ap pears in Figure 2 (the man at viewer's right), Figure 3 (man in center), Figure 8, and Figure 9 (man at rear). It also appears in Curtis' plate labeled "Arikara Medicine Ceremony ? The Buffalo Dancing" (1909: opp. p. 92) and his plate labeled "The Buffalo Medicine ? Arikara" (1909: opp. p. 96). Item 2. Buffalo headdress with horns and feather and grass ornaments attached. The second buffalo headdress is similar in construction to the first. It is 70 cm. in overall length and has a maximum width of 30 cm. The horns have a maximum length of 29 cm. and are attached in the same manner as those in item 1. Apparently because the bison hide at the front or "cap" part of this headdress has become brittle and cracked, a reinforcement of scraps of tanned horsehide, with machine-sewed seams, sewed with cotton thread, has been added on the underside. This is knotted and laced to the original bison hide at various points. It too has dried and cracked. The horns on this headdress are 31 cm. apart (measuring around the circumference of the cap in front), beginning at a point 6 cm. above the base of the headdress. The horns, drilled as in item 1 and similarly attached, have a diameter of 7 cm. at the base. This headdress also has chin strap thongs at the bottom. In this case a double thong, 46 cm. long, is knotted through the cap part of the head dress below the horns to serve this purpose. The ornaments on the upper surface of this headdress, beginning at the front, consist of the fol lowing: following the curve of the front or "cap" part of the headdress, and 16 cm. from the front edge (so as to lie between the horns) is a single downy "breath" feather. It is 21 cm. long and is at tached by wrapping moistened sinew around a bit of the wool in the headdress. Fourteen cm. back from the base of this plume and some 5 cm. to the viewer's left is a second one 16 cm. long, and sim ilarly attached. Thirteen cm. further back, and spaced 12 cm. apart, are two small whorls of what appears to be dried sweetgrass [Savastana odo~ rata), each 4 cm. in diameter. They are tied to a tuft of bison wool with a small strip of the grass. Only 4 cm. behind these is another pair of downy eagle plumes, one 18 cm. and the other 19 cm. long. They are attached as were the first two noted. Between them, in the center of the "tail" of the headdress, a bunch of bison wool is tied with sinew, probably the site of another ornament now missing. Slightly to the right of this, and 3 cm. further toward the back, is a single black and white golden eagle tail feather. This feather is 35 cm. long, and is bound at its base for a length of 7 cm. with red stroud cloth, and is tied Figure 13. Above: "Red" component bundle (Subgroup B) as wrapped and tied for storage; "Plaid" component bundle (Subgroup C) as wrapped and tied for storage. to the headdress at its base with a buckskin thong. Ten cm. further back from the point of attachment of this feather are two more ornaments 11 cm. apart. On the viewer's left, from the front of the headdress, is another whorl of grass 4 cm. in diame ter. On the right is another downy eagle plume 16 cm. long. Two more downy eagle plumes or "breath" feathers, 7 cm. apart, are located 5 cm. further back. They are each 15 cm. long, and their ends project slightly beyond the end of the head dress in back. This completes the ornamentation of the headdress. This headdress appears, as worn, in Figure 2 (worn by Frank Heart, the man on viewer's left), Figure 3 (again worn by Frank Heart, the man in the center), Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, and Figure 7 (man second from the rear). It also appears in Curtis' plate labeled "Arikara Medicine Ceremony ? the Buffalo Dancing" (1909: opp. p. 92) and his plate labeled "The Buffalo Medicine ? Arikara" (1909: opp. p. 96). The two headdresses undoubtedly constitute the major elements in the Buffalo society bundle. Their purpose, when worn by two Buffalo priests, who were painted and mimed the actions of the great beasts, was to call the bison by means of sympathe tic magic. Even in 1973, lying on my work table for analysis, their great curving black horns and shaggy wool, surmounted by the holy "breath" feathers and other ornaments, presented an awesome ap pearance. We can imagine their effect in their true cultural setting, as the garb of priests intent upon bringing food to the people. Subgroup B, Red C omponent Bundle (Fig. 12, left; Fig. 13, top) In addition to the two headdresses the bundle contains two additional component bundles. The first of these which we shall term Subgroup B, or the 262</page><page sequence="23">il'U1 Figure 14. Above: Corn fetish included in "Red" component bundle (item 7); Below: Ear of corn included in "Red" component bundle (item 8). "Red" component bundle, consists of a piece of red cotton cloth in which objects were wrapped. The appearance of this bundle before being unwrapped is illustrated (Fig. 13, top). As wrapped, the bundle was 66 cm. long and 24 cm. thick. It was tied, 17 cm. from either end, with two red silk ribbons, each tied with the "Indian knot." When unwrapped, this outer wrapping of red cloth (Item 3) measured 90 x 88 cm. Before being used to wrap the contents, however, it was first folded over for a distance of 24 26 cm. of the longer dimension, then doubled, so as to form a piece 68x44 cm. The two ribbons (Items 4 and 5) were 6.5 cm. wide, of red silk. They were twisted to form what Indians term "rag string." One is 50 cm. long; the other is some 70 cm. long but has an overhand knot in its middle part, forming a loop. This reduces the effective length for tying to 49 cm. Inside this outer cotton wrapping is another cloth, a piece of black woolen material (Item 6) measuring 140 x 39 cm. Before being used as a wrapping it was folded once on its long axis, reducing its length to 70 cm. Supernumerary wrappings of this sort are com mon in American Indian sacred bundles, and indi cate the holy nature of the objects so wrapped. The following items were contained in the "Red" component bundle: Item 7. Corn fetish tied to stick (Fig. 14, top). The stick is painted green and is 52 cm. long, tapering to a point at one end; it is 8 mm. in diameter at the other end. The green paint is clearly native paint, and resembles watercolor. It was probably made by scraping verdigris from copper and brass trade items. I have frequently observed this same paint used to ornament Plains Indian Grass dance whistles, mirrors, and drum stakes. The grain of the wood, fragments of inner bark, etc. are still appar ent in spite of the paint. Tied on the stick near the end opposite the point is a fetish consisting of an ear of native corn with yellow kernels. This ear is 14 cm. long. A length of black silk ribbon 3.7 cm. wide is used to tie a number of objects to this ear of corn and to hold the ear in position on the stick. The objects include two downy eagle plumes, the ends of which protrude from the wrappings at the top. Their estimated lengths are 19 and 12 cm. Also attached to the corn, and protruding below the wrappings at the bottom end, is a bit of sweetgrass (Savastana odorata) and the ends of some dark brown woolen strings, probably spun buffalo wool. These strings, though hidden by the black ribbon wrapping, go around the ear of corn several times and to anchor it to the stick. Item 8. Corn fetish (Fig. 14, bottom). A second ear of the same kind of corn, 17 cm. long and 3.2 cm. in diameter, is also included in the "Red" com ponent bundle. Two downy eagle feathers are at tached to it by means of a buckskin thong. One plume is 20 cm. long; the other is 19 cm. The buck skin thong is tied in an "Indian knot." Photographs of the corn fetishes and a few loose grains from them were submitted to Hugh Cutler, Missouri Botanical Garden, St. Louis, for analysis. His comments (in a letter dated 6 June 1973) are as follows: The feather decorated ear, and the one from which at least one of the grains enclosed in your letter is derived is an 8-rowed Northern Flint, the grains very hard, color of endo sperm deep yellow and of the entire ear a deep brownish yel low. The ear has been exposed to dirt and grease and appar ently smoked or lightly roasted because the pericarp (outer skin of the grain) is discolored and distorted. The ear is typi cal Northern Flint, similar to some of the ears illustrated in Will and Hyde's Corn Among the Indians of the Upper Mis souri (1917). The corn is the major type of the Plains and most of eastern U.S. and has been known since about 400 A.D. in the southern areas, but is much later, perhaps not until around 1000 A.D. and slightly later on the northern and western fringes. The ear conforms to descriptions of the kinds of ears chosen for seed but is not exceptionally good. It has the covered tip and somewhat straight and regular rows of grains which are considered desirable. The grains are large and well-developed but there frequently are slight 263</page><page sequence="24">ly larger and longer ears in collections I have seen. The ear which is wrapped and tied to the stick probably is similar but appears to be slightly shorter. This type of corn was grown until recently and probably is still grown. There may have been a slight reddish color on the ears but I could not be certain. Gilmore (1932:36-37) notes that all of the village sacred bundles of the Arikara contained ears of per fect corn. Until we examined the Buffalo society bundle, however, we were not aware that this rule extended to the society bundles as well. The inclusion of the ears of corn (and in the village bundles a symbolic hoe as well) is evidence of the all important place which horticulture had in the life and thought of the Arikara. Rituals of all phases of Arikara life, public and tribal, private and personal, are replete with references to the divine gift of corn from Neshanu Natshikak, "Chief Above," the Cre ator. W. D. Strong found the corn plant motif used as a shoulder design on an Arikara vessel he recov ered at the Cottonwood Creek site in South Dakota (Will 1934:7) and I have even observed the design of ears of corn in the beadwork worn by male Arikara Grass dancers. Item9. Sweetgrassbraid(Fig. 16, top). A braid of sweetgrass21 cm. long is braided in the simple three element braid which is usual for these objects; it is secured at the base end by a few turns of grass and an overhand knot. The smaller end shows no sign of burning, indicating that this braid was not used as a ritual fumigant. Its inclusion in the bundle was to honor the deities to which the bundle was dedi cated, particularly the thunderbirds, and also to serve as a perfume and vermifuge. Such sweetgrass braids are common in Plains Indian medicine bundles. Item 10. This is a tissue paper cylinder measuring 30 x 30 cm. In it are rolled ten downy eagle plumes (Item 11, Fig. 15, right) ranging from 26 cm. to 15 cm.; 7 screech owl (?) tail feathers, all from the same bird (Item 12, Fig. 15, left) ranging in length from 18 cm. to 21 cm.; and (Item 13, Fig. 15, bottom) two prepared "hair plumes," both made in the same way from an extra fine downy eagle breath feather 24.5 cm. long. Each has a wisp of red-dyed horsehair 30 cm. long attached to its base so as to extend along the length of the feather, and each is wrapped at the base with a bit of the green head skin of a mallard duck for a length of 6 cm. Each has a long buckskin thong, presumably for attaching the plume to the wearer's hair, fastened at its base. One of these extends 23 cm. from the base of the feather, the other 24 cm. Sinew thread is used to attach the horsehair, mallard duck head skin, and buckskin thong to the plumes. Figure 15. Owl feathers (item 12), left, eagle breath feathers (item 11), right, and hair plumes (item 13) below, included in "Red" component bundle. Item 74 (Fig. 16, top) is of a small packet made from a commercial linen handkerchief measuring 29 x 30 cm., with a violet edge and an embroidered floral design in one corner. The contents of the packet are secured in the center of the handkerchief by means of a twisted "rag string" tie 25 cm. long. The packet contains: Item 15. Light grey chert projectile point with an expanding stem. The point is of a type common in the late prehistoric and early historic periods in the Plains. In Texas and Oklahoma, points of this size and configuration are termed "Scallorn points." (Fig. 16, bottom, d). The point is 40 mm. long (a small part of the tip is missing), 17 mm. wide at the shoul der, 12 mm. wide at the base, and is 5 mm. thick. Item 16. is another point of the same general type, but with a more rounded base. It is of slightly darker chert, and is 40 mm. long, 15 mm. wide at the shoulder, 10 mm. wide at the base, and has a maxi mum thickness of 3 mm. (Fig. 16, bottom e). Very possibly these points symbolize the points of the magical lightning arrows used by the "poor boy with supernatural powers" who removed the old woman from the back of "Man-Who-Kills-Game-Easily" in the legend "The Buffalo Wife and the Javelin Game." This would explain why the points are in the bundle and why they are not made of the ubiquitous Knife River flint commonly employed by the Arikara for projectile points and knives. Also included in the linen handkerchief packet are (Item 17. Fig. 16, bottom, a-c) three small pieces of the root of the sweet flag (Acorus calamus), mea suring 5 cm., 5 cm., and 3.5 cm. in length, respec tively. They may have been intended for use as "throat medicine" by the singers for the Buffalo ceremony. Present day Grass dance singers often 264</page><page sequence="25">Figure 16. Above: Sweetgrass braid (item 9) and linen handkerchief component packet (item 14) in "Red" component bundle; Below: Contents of linen handkerchief component packet in "Red" component bundle. From left to right, a, b, and c, pieces of calamus root (item 17), d, projectile point (item 15), and e, projectile point (item 16). chew small pieces of this root to clear their throats, much as cough drops are used in the major culture. The root is also thought to be of value to diabetics, and, because of its astringent juice, is sometimes used to relieve toothache. This completes the contents of Subgroup B, the "Red" component bundle. Subgroup C, Plaid Component Bundle (Fig. 12, right; Fig. 13, bottom) This bundle is wrapped in a piece of plaid cotton print (Item 18). As wrapped, the bundle has a length of 70 cm. and a circumference of 30 cm. at its center. Unfolded, the wrapping cloth measures 157 cm. long and 45 cm. wide. Before being employed, the cloth was folded once on its long axis, giving a total length of 78 cm. The cloth is tied around the contents of the bundle with a buckskin thong 10 mm. wide and 147 cm. long. At one end (the viewer's left in Fig. 13) the buckskin is fastened with an overhand knot. The longer end of the thong is then carried 18 cm. to the right, carried around the circumference of the bundle, and secured with a half hitch. The thong is then carried 15 cm. further to the right where the procedure is repeated. Nine cm. further to the right the thong is looped around the cloth at the end of the bundle and tied in a loop 6 cm. long with a hard "granny" knot. It seems unlikely that this last knot has been untied since it was made. In fact it is possible to open the bundle and to remove the contents without untying the knot(cf. Fig. 12). The buckskin thong is spliced with another "granny" knot 42 cm. from this loop end. Inside this component bundle are wrapped the following objects: Item20. Headdress (Fig. 17, top). This headdress is made of the tail of a buffalo bull. It is of a kind that was still occasionally seen at Grass dances among the Arikara, Hidatsa, Mandan, Dakota, Ponca, and other Plains tribes until about 1955. It is worn tied to the hair at the back of a man's head so as to hang down his back. Such headdresses were painted by the artist Bodmer in the 1830's and are undoubtedly an old style for the Plains. Apparently these head dresses were occasionally worn at the level of the belt in back by Arikara Buffalo priests. What ap pears to be such a headdress, worn as a "tail" appears in Figure 10, on the man nearest the camera in the center group, which is the Buffalo society. The example included in Subgroup C is 60 cm. long. At its top, where it is broadest, it is 5.5 cm. wide. The hide portion of the headdress makes up half its length, the trailing hair the remainder. To make this headdress the bison tail was partially tanned and the hair removed for a distance of 11.5 cm. from the top. From this point down a small amount of the hair in the center of the ornament was allowed to remain, though that at the sides is remov ed, and as one proceeds to the lower end of the hide the proportion of the amount of hair remaining increases. The hair of the tail itself has pieces of clay adhering to it here and there. Returning to the top of the headdress we note that for 27 mm. the hide was folded back toward the upper side of the headdress. This folded back portion is completely beaded, using medium size (size 13.0), blue seed beads. This beadwork is sinew sewn in what is called the "lazy stitch," but only one "vane" is used for the entire length of the beaded area ? that is, each stitch carries 25 beads between the points at the top and bottom, where the sinew anchors each stitch to the tanned hide base. The 265</page><page sequence="26">piece is also edge beaded using large (3 mm. diameter) "pony beads" of the same bright blue hue as the smaller seed beads. This edge beading extends across the base of the folded over beaded section at the top and extends down from the top on either side. On the left hand side it extends for 17.5 cm., on the right for 18.5 cm. Two holes are punched through the top of the headdress 15 mm. from the top, and 12 mm. apart, near the center. Through these holes a buckskin thong 32 cm. in length is threaded, so as to pass over five rows of beadwork on the upper wide of the piece, and this thong is secured with an overhand knot on the underside. This thong was undoubtedly intended to tie the headdress to the wearer's hair in back. Two cm. further down is another pair of small holes, with a much smaller, shorter buckskin thong threaded through them. This second thong is tied in a knot on the upper surface of the headdress. Its function is unknown. The size and color of the beads employed on this headdress serve to date its manufacture to about 1835. Plains Indians selected their bead colors and sizes with great care. In the 1830's they had a def inite preference for two colors of beads, blue and white. The original Catlin paintings in the U.S. National Museum and the Bodmer watercolors reveal the preference for blue and white beads among the Upper Missouri tribes. This preference is also indicated by the large orders for trade beads received by the American Fur Company in New York from Pratte, Chouteau, and Company of St. Louis in the 1830's. The earliest beads supplied to the Upper Missouri tribes were the large "pony" beads used in the edge beading of our headdress. By 1835, however, the St. Louis firm complained: With regard to the Glass Beads, blue and white pound Beads, all those received last year and this year. . . were en tirely too large and unsaleable. You ought to have good samples with which we have furnished you for several years besides Mr. Jacob Halsey has promised to assist you in the purchase of these articles. Have the goodness to see him on the subject and endeavor that so important an article should be furnished us of the color and size exactly suitable. (Amer ican Fur Company Papers (NYHS). Orders Inward. Book I: 164, quoted in Ewers 1957:32). The failure of their Philadelphia importer to furnish the smaller seed beads for the 1836 trade on time caused the American Fur Company to place orders directly with Allesandre Bartolla of Venice, Italy, the great center for the manufacture of glass beads used in the Indian trade at that time (Ewers 1957: 32-33). Item 21. Eagle feather (Fig. 19, top). A single golden eagle tail feather, of the dark, banded colora Figure 17. Above: Headdress made of bison tail with beaded top (item 20); Below: Buffalo tail whisk (item 22). tion characteristic of older birds, may have been worn in connection with item 20, so as to stand erect in the hair in back. It measures 36.5 cm. in length. Item 22. Buffalo tail whisk (Fig. 17, bottom). This piece is a tanned section of bison tail 39.5 cm. long which has been sewed, at its upper end, over a wooden (?) stick 20 cm. long so as to provide a handle. The hair was removed from the tail for a distance of 10 cm. from the end of the handle. A downy eagle feather 15 cm. long was fastened, by means of a sinew wrapping, to one of the wisps of bison hair so as to project 5 cm. beyond the hair at the end. Figures 2, 3, and 4 show how the whisks were employed, to mimic the switching of a bison's tail. They also indicate that originally two of these whisks were a part of the Buffalo society bundle, the second one having been lost sometime between 1908 and 1973. There are three cane whistles in this component bundle and one "blank" for an unfinished whistle. Item23 (Fig. 18) is a highly decorated whistle, and seems to be older than the others. It is made of a cylinder of river cane (?) 31 cm. long and 14 mm. in diameter, with a bore diameter of 8 mm. Six and a half cm. from the upper or mouth end is a rectangu lar opening 5 x15 mm. and below it, in the bore of the whistle, is a lump of blackish spruce gum. The whistle still has a loud, piercing note. The surface of 266</page><page sequence="27">Figure 18. Cane whistle with otter hide neck strap and feather ornaments (item 23). the whistle shows evidence of scraping, as if with a piece of broken glass or flint. Beginning 1.5 cm. from the mouth end and continuing for 17 mm. down the whistle is a sinew wrapping by which an otter fur neck strap is attached. The strap is 67 cm. long not including the portion at either end under the sinew wrapping (3 and 4 cms., respectively). The neck strap varies in width from 1 to 1.8 cm. The main portion of the strap is sewn with sinew thread to a smaller piece 7.2 cm. from the mouth end of the whistle on one side. Attached to the otter fur neck strap of the whistle, so as to fall over the wearer's chest in front when the whistle is suspended around the neck by the neckstrap, are two bunches of bird feathers. These feathers are 29 cm. to 15.6 cm. long. The group on the wearer's left hand includes 26 feathers, with three empty "sockets" of dried sinew wrapping indicating feathers once present but now lost. The other group has 22 with two empty "sockets." Each feather is attached separately, by means of a sinew wrapping, to an individual buck skin thong. These thongs are then tied into a bundle, for each of the two groups, and the thongs doubled back on themselves, tied tightly with another buckskin thong, and then clipped off. The ends of the thong tying each group of feathers are then threaded through holes in the otter fur neck strap on either side and tied with an "Indian knot." The feathers in the left hand group include 4 immature Bald eagle tail feathers (Halioetus leuco cephalus), 4 female Marsh hask or Harrier tail feathers (Circus cyaneus hudsonius), 11 Swain son's hawk tail feathers (Buteo swainsoni), 3 mature Broad winged hawk tail feathers (Buteo platypterus platypterus), the remainder being unidentifiable due to the loss of the web. The feathers in the right hand group include 3 female Marsh hawk or Harrier tail feathers, 15 Swainson's hawk tail feathers, and 2 immature Broad winged hawk tail feathers, the remainder being unidentifiable. Four of the feathers in the left hand group and 3 in the right hand group have an ornamental wrapping of blue-dyed porcu pine quills at the base in addition to their functional sinew wrapping. It is evident from Figures 2 and 3 that there were formerly two feather decorated whistles in the Buffalo society medicine bundle. One of these, or at any rate its feather ornaments and neck cord, was lost between 1908 and 1973. Item 23, as worn, appears in Figures 2 and 3, and it or its missing mate also appear in Figures 4, 5, 6, and 9. Items 24, 25, and 26. Cane whistles (Fig. 19, bottom). Items 24 and 25 are cane whistles of the same type as item 23, but without ornamentation, while item 26 is a "blank" or unfinished example of the same. The two finished pieces are 31 and 30.2 cm. in length, respectively, and the unfinished spec imen is 31 cm. in length. Diameters, in the same order, are 16,14, and 14 mm. Bore diameters are 10, 8, and 8 mm. Although item 23 seems to be made of a section of native American "river" cane, a species common in the southern United States, items 24, 25, and 26 appear to be made of sections of commercial bamboo fishpole. They have the very heavy joints and lack the completely round section of native cane. Item 24 has the "spotted" surface coloring seen in some bamboo fishpoles. Item27. Bison teeth necklace (Fig. 20, top). This item is a necklace of bison teeth spaced with white trade beads. A miniature gaming hoop for the hoop and pole game, with an eagle "breath" feather orna ment, are attached. The necklace is made up of a buckskin thong 100 cm. long, upon which 43 drilled bison incisors were threaded, with 41 large (1 cm. diameter) glass trade beads as spacers. These trade beads are of a type traded to the Arikara and other Upper Missouri tribes in the early 19th century. In the center of the necklace an additional orna ment is attached. This is a small replica of one of the hoops or gaming wheels used in the hoop-and-pole game. It is made of a loop of brass wire 45 mm. in diameter with a netted filling of twisted sinew. It is attached to the main part of the necklace by a buck skin thong 6 cm. long (excluding knots). A second buckskin thong is attached to this gaming wheel at a 267</page><page sequence="28">point opposite its attachment to the necklace. This thong, 8 cm. long, excluding knots, has a downy eagle feather 17 cm. long attached to its lower end by means of a sinew wrapping, and just above this wrapping two small (10 mm. diameter) brass "hawk" bells of a type common in the Indian trade. The attachment of the miniature hoop-and-pole game hoop to the necklace of buffalo teeth in a Buffalo society bundle is most interesting, as it points up the symbolism of this game. It refers to the strong association of the hoop-and-pole game with buffalo, elk, and other big game in the minds of the Arikara. This association is explicit in the Arikara legend "The Buffalo Wife and the Javelin Game," abstracted earlier in this paper. This legend credits both the Buffalo or Javelin game (hoop-and-pole) and the Buffalo ceremony to the Buffalo people. To play the hoop-and-pole game was a minor equiva lent of performing the Buffalo calling ceremony, since the Arikara believed that the buffalo them selves were fond of the game and played it amongst themselves when humans were not watching. John Bradbury (1817:141-142) describes one Ari kara version of this widespread North American game: We amused ourselves sometime by watching a party who were engaged in play. A place was neatly formed, resemb ling a skittle alley, about nine feet in breadth and ninety feet long; a ring of wood, about five inches in diameter, was trundled along from one end, and when it had run some dis tance, two Indians, who stood ready, threw after it, in a slid ing manner, each a piece of wood, about three feet long and four inches in breadth, made smooth on one edge, and kept from turning by a cross piece passing through it, and bent backwards so as to resemble a cross bow. The standers by kept an account of the game, and he whose piece, in a given number of throws (p. 142) more frequently came nearest the ring after it had fallen, won the game. H. M. Brackenridge describes two versions of the game (1904:255): Their daily sports, in which, when the weather is favor able, they are engaged from morning till night, are princi pally of two kinds. A level piece of ground appropriated for the purpose, and beaten by frequent use, is the place where they are carried on. The first is played by two persons, each armed with a long pole; one of them rolls a hoop, which, after having reached about two-thirds of the distance, is fol lowed at half speed, and as they perceive it about to fall, they cast their poles under it; the pole on which the hoop falls, so as to be nearest to certain corresponding marks on the hoop and pole, gains for that time. This game excites great interest, and produces a gentle, but animated exer cise. The other differs from it in this, that instead of poles, they have short pieces of wood, with barbs at one end, and a cross piece at the other, held in the middle with one hand; but instead of the hoop before mentioned, they throw a small ring, and endeavor to put the point of the barb through it. This is a much more violent exercise than the other. As might be expected, the closest similarities to ' "a, JO Figure 19. Above: Golden eagletail feather (item 21) and "spare sinew and buckskin thong (item 32); Below: Cane whistles and blank for whistle (items 24-26). the Arikara games are found among the Skidi Paw nee. Culin (1907:463-469) discusses the Pawnee variants of the game and illustrates the equipment used by them. Among the Pawnee the netted filling of the hoop used in one variant is described as made to resemble a spider's web. This refers to the belief that the Spider-Woman controlled the buffalo and produced them from her web. With the Skidi Pawnee, as with the Arikara, the game was original ly played for the direct purpose of calling the buffalo (Dorsey 1904a:343). Item 28. Bison teeth necklace with bison wool at tached {Fig. 20, bottom). This second necklace is of the same general type as the first. It consists of 30 drilled bison incisors, with 67 white glass "neck beads" as spacers, the whole strung on a thong of tanned buffalo hide 110 cm. long. Except at the ends, where there are four and five glass beads, re spectively, the pattern is two glass bead spacers between each tooth and its neighbor. Two of the bison teeth (one at one end of the necklace and one near the center) have been repaired by wrapping them with sinew, apparently because they began to split when being drilled. A doubled wisp of bison wool 9 cm. long is attached to the center of the necklace by a buckskin thong. This may be shed bison wool, which had great religious significance to the Arikara and other Prairie and High Plains tribes, thus referring to the name of the Buffalo society, Chiwiku or Shedding (Buffalo). One or another of the two bison teeth necklaces, items 27 or 28, 268</page><page sequence="29">^^^^^^ Figure20. Above: Necklace of bison teeth and trade beads with miniature gaming hoop and feather ornament (item 27); Below: Necklace of bison teeth and trade beads with wisp of buffalo wool attached (item 28). appear as worn in Figures 2-4, 6, and 9-10. Item 29. Group of eight downy eagle feather hair plumes in paper wrapping (Fig. 21, top). These plumes vary from 25.5 cm. to 21 cm. long. The longest is plain and unadorned. The next in size is bound with sinew wrapping to a sharpened wooden stick 6 cm. long, so that it may be stuck in the hair. The remaining six are bound at the base to individual buckskin thongs so as to permit their being tied in the hair. Three have an additional ornamental wrap ping of blue-dyed porcupine quill. Item 30. Horn spoon (Fig. 22). This spoon is apparently made of cowhorn, rather than bison horn, since it is yellow rather than black in color. It is of a type common in the Southeast, Northeast, Prairie, and High Plains areas. It is made from the underside of the horn base, the uppermost portion having been trimmed to form a handle. The spoon is 13.3 cm. long with a maximum width of 5.5 cm. Shell spoons figure prominently in the Buffalo dances of the Shawnee and Delaware, where they were used by the dancers to scoop up corn mush, supposedly the favorite food of bison, from a large kettle in the center of the dance ground. Whether the Arikara had a similar belief is not known. Another possibility is that the spoon was used by Buffalo doctors to administer medicine in curing rites. Item 31. Two braids of sweetgrass (Fig. 21, bottom). Two braids of sweetgrass (Savastana odorata) are included in the "Plaid" component bundle. One is 51 cm. long, the other 53 cm. Both are braided in the traditional Plains Indian three strand braid. The shorter of the two has an overhand knot of one strand of sweetgrass at either end to prevent it from coming apart; the other lacks this feature. Item 32. Repair materials (Fig. 19, top). An extra piece of sinew with a buckskin thong tied about it was probably added to the "Plaid" component bundle for repairs. The sinew is approximately 62 cm. long, the buckskin thong 74 cm. This completes the listing of items in Subgroup C, the "Plaid" component bundle. Miscellaneous Item Item33 (Fig. 12, center back). A piece of red and white striped cotton print, originally measuring 90 x 130 cm., with a piece 4 cm. x 24 cm. torn from one corner was in the Buffalo society bundle. Its pur pose is unknown. It may be an offering to the bundle by some petitioner for supernatural aid, or it may have served as a general wrapping for the two headdresses plus the "Red" and "Plaid" compon ent bundles. There were also two pieces of silk rib bon: one is yellow and is 5.5 cm. wide x 23 cm. long. The other is green, 4 cm. wide x 21 cm. long. They may be the remains of longer pieces used in tying up the bundle in times past. CONCLUSIONS From the above, it can be seen that nearly all of the items in the Arikara Buffalo society medicine bundle can be explained within the framework of Arikara mythology and ceremonialism. It is equally apparent that many would be meaningless if one lacked the cognitive perspective. Fortunately, in this case, we have an excellent folkloristic and ethno graphic record to which we may turn for clues in explaining the items in the bundle and their 269</page><page sequence="30">Figure 21.

Who, for example, lacking such a record, could possibly understand the mystic connection between hoops and bison, or sweetgrass and weather control, or feathers from an eagle's rump and sanctity? For the assemblages of this sort which appear from time to time in archaeological contexts (usually minus the animal and vegetal materials of a perishable nature), the mythological and ceremonial bases for understanding the function and symbol ism of the items are usually missing. Only the juxtaposition of the items, their frequency and their associations, together with knowledge of ceremon ial practices and beliefs in that culure and time period, can provide clues to the meaning of the indi vidual items in the bundle, and the bundle as a whole, for the person or persons who assembled and used it. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We wish to thank Dr. Kenneth Leonard, Garrison, N. Dak., for letting us examine the Buffalo society bundle at our leisure and for many other kindnesses. Thanks also to Paul Ewald, New Town, N. Dak., for loaning us the negatives of the Curtis photographs of the 1908 medicine lodge ceremony performances; to Hugh Cutler, Missouri Botanical Garden, St. Louis, Mo., for examining the corn from the bundle; and to Mrs. Levi Waters, White Shield, North Dakota, for information on Arikara attitudes regarding the Buffalo society bundle and the Buffalo dance. The cost of the numerous illustrations was underwritten by Oklahoma State University. NOTES 1. Curtis recognizes the "Principal Medicine" as a medicine Figure 22.

Gilmore states that the original four societies were the Ghost, Buffalo, Owl, and Bear, to which were later added the Deer, Cormorant (Curtis's 'Ifohnlt), Duck, and "Sioux". This last is the same as Curtis's Mother Night or Young Dog, and Will's Rabbit and Dakota band. It has also been called the Blackbird or Grass society. It would appear to be the old Prairie-Plains "Hot Dance" or Grass dance society which, with the Arikara, was grafted onto the medicine fraternity system in spite of its warrior-dancing society origin. 2. This may prove to be a widespread folk motif in North America. The Shawnee have a similar legend in which Squirrel, then, a man-eater, is discovered hiding a human hand under his forearm by the Creator. 3. This entire procedure, from the search for the pole to its erection and the blessing of the children, is virtually identical with the procedure involved in the selection and bringing in of the Sun dance pole in many Plains tribes. 4. We still await a published account of these latter day Arikara medicine ceremonies from anthropologist Preston Holder who, as a observer-participant, took part in one while doing ethnographic field work with the tribe.
