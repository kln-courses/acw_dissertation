Munich: Beck, 1970. Paper, DM. 28. THIS closely argued work is partly a reconsideration of the De Philosophia, partly a general study of Aristotle's cosmology and theology. It proposes sub- stantial alterations to the 'fragments' of the lost dialogue, and argues that its doctrines were entirely those of the mature Aristotle. It is interesting for both its methods and its conclusions. There are about thirty fragments currently attributed to the De Philosophia, most of which consist of several passages from different authors. Although few appear to be verbatim extracts, a number refer to the dialogue by name. Others, however, are attributed by our sources to Aristotle, but not to any particular work, and yet others have been selected only on grounds of style and subject-matter. Effe subjects some-but only some-of them to searching criticism, and rejects all or parts of six. In return, he claims to have found a number of new fragments. Rejections He is surely right in rejecting frag. 25 (Ross), the technical passage on music from Plutarch, which is not about 'heavenly harmony', but only says that harmony is heavenly-something quite different. He is also doubtful about the passages from Pliny and Plutarch in frag. 6, and the long excerpt from the Physics added by Untersteiner, the Philoponus passage of frag. 8, the whole of frags. 12b, 13b and c (Untersteiner), 14, and 21, and about frag. 27, which he thinks could equally well be from the Eudemus. Many of these suggestions are not new, but they are none the worse for that. Additions He wants to transfer to the De Philosophia frag. 8 of the Protrepticus, with its reference to cataclysms, and the Censorinus passage from frag. 19 of that work, and to add to our frag. 18 a passage from Meteor. i. Extra material is also found elsewhere in Meteor. i and in De Caelo i, and in a number of other esoteric works.</page><page sequence="2">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW 203 But the most interesting part of his enterprise is his study of the original sources in which fragments have already been detected. By considering the whole context he finds other possible fragments in similar works. Thus from a study of Philo's De Aeternitate Mundi he brings in an Epicurean passage quoted by Aftius, and starting from a single passage in Ocellus Lucanus he has found, not surprisingly, further traces of the dialogue in the remains of pseudo- Pythagorean literature. Among other suggestions is new material in Sextus Empiricus and in Macrobius' Commentary on the Somnium Scipionis. In spite of all this Effe is rightly cautious about reconstructing the dialogue, but thinks that we may be sure of large sections of Book iii. It contained argu- ments that the Universe was eternal because it was indestructible and uncreated, and criticisms of the opposing views of Plato and the Atomists. The Universe was divided into superlunary and sublunary realms, related as active to passive; superlunary objects were themselves eternal, but in the sublunary realm the only eternity was that of the species. There was also a detailed account of the motions of the stars and of their matter. Two kinds of argument for the exis- tence of God were examined, those from prophecy (which Effe thinks Aristotle himself did not accept) and those arrived at by reason, particularly from obser- vation of the heavens. These led to a view of God similar to that of the Meta- physics, in which work Effe agrees with Merlan, against Jaeger, that A 8 is not a late insertion, reinterpreting passages from Physics 9 6 which Jaeger adduced in support of his theory. The De Philosophia he dates soon after the Laws. This summary has had to pass over many important details which add to the value of the work. It will have to be absorbed by anyone contemplating a new edition of the De Philosophia. It is, however, a measure of the difficulty of the problems involved that there are still many uncertainties and loose ends left of which the following are a sample: i. As in his other works, Aristotle seems in the De Philosophia to have treated popular beliefs, and the relics of ancient wisdom, as evidence worthy of respect. Among such beliefs was the belief in God, which he here derived from at least two sources. One was the fact that, on occasions, people have prophetic powers, taken to be evidence of the divine in us. But, according to Effe, Aristotle him- self did not accept this, which sounds as if he must have here tried to explain away, and not assimilate, a popular belief. This is perfectly possible, and would fit in with Metaphysics A 8, where Aristotle rejects popular anthropomorphic views of the gods, but Effe's arguments are unconvincing as they stand and ignore some of the evidence available. 2. Walzer's Fragment 29, the opening chapter of De Caelo ii, was originally selected as part of a dialogue by Blass in 1875, because of its strict avoidance of hiatus. Jaeger, on this and other stylistic grounds, accepted it as a verbatim extract from the De Philosophia, and was followed by Walzer and Untersteiner, though not by Ross. Effe now treats it only as a passage using material from the De Philosophia, and plays down the original stylistic arguments. In this he is probably right, as Aristotle frequently used a high-flown style for the opening passages of new works or new sections of works, and in addition, hiatus- avoidance continues well into the next chapter, in a passage which refers back to the De Incessu Animalium. But if the stylistic arguments are dropped, the whole status of the passage needs rearguing. University of Liverpool PAMELA M. HUBY</page></plain_text>
