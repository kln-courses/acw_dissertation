<plain_text><page sequence="1">Guide to the Year's Work General Materials ANDREW M. STAUFFER Christopher M. Keirstead begins his Victorian Poetry, Europe, and the Challenge of Cosmopolitanism by imagining "an Atlas of Victorian Poetry" (p. 1) that could represent the complex internationality of the British verse we study. It turns out that the adjective "Victorian" has displaced our understanding of the many ways this poetry looked beyond the borders of the nation, and indeed was called forth by a desire to imagine a broader Anglo-European com munity. Recognizing that poetry tends toward national identity by virtue of its linguistic investments, Keirstead argues that, nevertheless, nineteenth-century British poets were deeply engaged with Europe and cosmopolitanism: their art was shaped by their concern for Britain's cultural relationship to "the ever-impending Europe of the future" (p. 3), with a distinct focus on France and Italy. Moreover, they worked to sustain poetry itself as a powerful and dis tinct agent of cosmopolitanism amid the other unifying forces of the century, particularly communication technologies, scientific advancements, and the marketplace. Yet Keirstead shows that poets such as Arnold, the Brownings, Clough, and Morris were also always challenged by the idea of cosmopolitan ism; and they struggled profoundly with poetry's role in promoting the dream of a unified Europe. Matthew Arnold is a key presence in the critical narrative, a figure devoted to broad international ideas of culture who abandoned poetry but not before laying down paths for encounters with Europe that others would follow. Barrett Browning will step boldly here, offering in her work a politically and religiously inflected vision of an international community dependent on poets and artists; one might say she emerges as the heroine of this study. A chapter on Clough shows how Amours de Voyage offers only a cosmopolitanism of negation, depicting as it does the post-national flaneur disillusioned and lost in an unredeemed Europe. Robert Browning is presented as a border-crossing figure whose poetry "sought to enter into the varieties of European national consciousness" (p. 27); Keirstead gives particular emphasis to the little-studied Red Cotton Night-Cap Country and the complex figuring of Anglo-French relations he finds there. A chapter on Swinburne argues that "Europe" and "France" serve the poet primarily as "discursive entities" that 347</page><page sequence="2">348 / VICTORIAN POETRY allow for radical cross-cultural imaginings of sex and gender—and provoked charges of dangerous "continental" decadence. Kierstad reads Morris' Icelan dic and Nordic poetry as offering "a sort of post-racial aestheticism" (p. 30) that looks to the past for an ideal of a unified European culture. The book concludes with a reading of Thomas Hardy's Dynasts as a late imagining of Europe as a "drama of nations" shaped by the Immanent Will. Taken together, these chapters offer a compelling and wide-ranging account of the aesthetic, spiritual, and political aspects of cosmopolitanism in Victorian poetry, as the idea of a unified Europe was tested, critiqued, refined, and rewritten as a set of risks that poetry, and really all of us, might take. In Lives of the Sonnet, 1787-1895: Genre, Gender and Criticism, Marianne Van Remoortel continues the robust tradition of recent work on the sonnet (by Jennifer Wagner, James Phelan, and Amy Bilione, among others) with a study of the gendering—indeed, the ascribed femininity—of the genre itself in the long nineteenth century. Verse by male and female poets receives equal attention here, as the book focuses on the development of a discursive culture that put gender at the center of the conversation about the sonnet. Rather than presenting a comprehensive survey of the genre in this period, Van Remoor tel instead proceeds by way of several case studies, with particular emphasis on the history of the critical conversation up to and including twenty-first century criticism. The second half of Lives of the Sonnet—focused on Elizabeth Barrett Browning, George Meredith, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and Augusta Webster—will be of most interest to the readers of Victorian Poetry, after early chapters on 1) the commodification of the sonnet in the eighteenth-century periodical The World (1787-94), 2) the Delia Cruscan sonnet as a battleground for the feminization of the genre, and 3) the pre-1800 sonnet parodies of S.T. Coleridge and Charles Lamb. The legacy of the sonnet to Victorian practi tioners like Barrett Browning was a vexed and lively one, fraught with issues of gender, sincerity, and aesthetic worth. Van Reemortel traverses the long reception history of the Sonnets from the Portuguese, demonstrating the widely variant readings that work has received, finding a "serial one-sidedness" (p. 96) as conservative and progressive readers quote the same passages at one another. By putting the work back into the contemporary culture of the sonnet, particularly the "poetess" tradition, we can reevaluate both Barrett Browning's poems and that tradition itself. Van Remoortel's perspective is ul timately synthetic: the sonnets are complex enough to accommodate feminine valences and masculine traditions, gestures of submission and bids for power, marriage, and authorship. Next comes a chapter on Meredith's Modern Love, a work which "ravaged the perfect little world of the sonnet as no sequence had done before" (p. 116). Van Remoortel focuses again on reception history, attentive to the ways that ideas about the sonnet shaped the developing critical conversation about Meredith's dark experiment. She is essentially interested</page><page sequence="3">ANDREW M. STAÖFFER / 349 in what work "the sonnet mark" does for critics: in the implications of that label for the interpretation of a generically and ideologically experimental work like Modern Love. A final chapter examines the comparative evocations of maternity in Webster's Mother and Daughter and Rossetti's The House of Life, the latter work thoroughly invested in "the metaphorical scope of maternity" (p. 151) for the creative process and the former invested in lived female expe rience. Lives of the Sonnet thus offers a series of intriguing windows onto the evolving discourse about poetry, gender, and culture that Victorian poetry continues to evoke. Two recent edited collections of essays by various hands make important contributions to the history of nineteenth-century reading practices as continu ous with book history: The Feeling of Reading: Affective Experience &amp; Victorian Literature, edited by Rachel Ablow, and Bookish Histories: Books, Literature, and Commercial Modernity, 1700-1900, edited by Ina Ferris and Paul Keen. Although neither is centered on Victorian poetry, both volumes contain much that is relevant to our field. The Feeling of Reading (ed. Ablow) presents a series of essays that demonstrate "how often an attention to the historical specificity of Victorian reading practices returns us to issues of physical and emotional feeling" (p. 4). Attending primarily to the affective experiences associated with reading in the Victorian era, these essays seek to broaden our conception of reading and its historiography via nuanced studies of cultural practice. Most immediately relevant to poetry are excellent essays by Catherine Robson (on poetic recitation in the Alice books and the relationship of juvenile pedagogy to scenes of poetic reading) and by Herbert Tucker (on the importance of fatigue in the aesthetic, cultural, and formal economies of Victorian poetry). Other essays by Nicholas Dames (on critical excerpting as a protocol of read ing), Kate Flint (on reading books out of place, away from home), Leah Price (on the unread, insulating, material book in Trollope), and John Plötz (on Mill's ideas of sociability and the important mediations of reading) provide a range of fascinating redefinitions of Victorian reading practice as involving bodily and emotional responses. Three final essays deal with fiction exclusively: Stephen Arata writes on the impersonal sympathies of Marius the Epicurian, Rachel Ablow unpacks Wilde's implicit reading of Newman in "The Portrait of Mr. W.H.," and Garrett Stewart shows the entanglement of reading and feeling in The Mill on the Floss. Taken together, the essays in The Feeling of Reading represent a significant contribution to our understanding of Victorian reading, revealing its complex investments, postures, and vehicles. Bookish Histories (ed. Ferris and Keen) is similarly valuable, though it ranges back into the eighteenth century and the Romantic era for many of its examples. Focusing more squarely on book history and the bibliographic imagination, these essays engage with questions of literary history though the lens of print culture. Several of them will be of particular interest to Victorianists. William</page><page sequence="4">350/VICTORIAN POETRY R. McKelvy's essay on "Making Literary History in the Age of Steam" presents Robert Chambers as the innovative impresario and founding father of literary history, in this case bound up with the advent of cheap print and commercial popularity. Deidre Lynch, in an essay on "Novels for Everyday Use," asserts the importance of the everyday, routine, and companionable nature of books for nineteenth-century readers, as against assumptions of their necessary novelty and exceptionality. Andrew Piper examines the miscellany form, demonstrat ing its value as a platform for negotiating sharing and owning in the new age of print. And Leah Price's essay on "Paper Recycling in Mayhew's London" brings us back to the material substrate of Victorian reading, reminding us of multiple functions of printed paper in the lives of the working classes and the unexpected acts of reading they enabled. These essays, along with important contributions by Jon Klancher, Michael Macovski, and others, make Bookish Histories a signal publication, one that opens new debates regarding the rela tionship of literary history to book history and gives us a sharper sense of the bibliographic meaningfulness of the Romantic and Victorian eras. I want to conclude this review—my final one for the Year's Work series —with a brief notice of several new online projects that have already begun to influence the field. Most immediately relevant is the Victorian Poetry Network (http://web.uvic.ca/ vicpoet/), directed by Alison Chapman at the University of Victoria. Only recently launched, VPN is at this point primarily a blog and discussion space, a home on the web for a growing community of scholars. In addition to featuring posts by a number of Victorianists, it also aims to foster conversation, provide links to resources, relay news, and engage a wide range of opinion. Future plans include an interactive timeline and a periodi cal poetry database. Becoming a member of the site (free and easy to do) will ensure you receive updates and allow you to join the conversation. Another important digital site is Review 19 (formerly NBOL-19; http://www.nbol-19. org/), under the general leadership of James Heffernan at Dartmouth. Since its founding only two years ago, Review 19 has published over one hundred reviews of scholarly books in the field of nineteenth-century studies (British and American), most of them within a few months of the book's publication. By speeding up the pace of reviewing without sacrificing quality, and mak ing all material freely available on the web, Review 19 has made a significant intervention in our practice. Finally, I would like to add a notice of NINES (http://nines.org), a scholarly organization, online aggregator of resources, and developer of digital tools. To date, NINES has peer-reviewed twenty scholar-built digital projects in nineteenth-century studies, all of which are simultaneously searchable from the website alongside many other resources, including commercial databases of primary and secondary material. In ad dition, NINES has hosted a number of workshops, institutes, and special seminars for scholars in the field, most recently an NEH-funded Institute on</page><page sequence="5">CLINTON MACHANN/ 351 the professional evaluation of digital scholarship in literary studies (http:// institutes.nines.org/). The Victorians Institute Journal has begun to publish a "digital annex" to its normal print issue via NINES (http://www.nines.org/ groups/vij), and other journals such as this one are invited to follow suit. The digital environment for the study of Victorian poetry is still underdeveloped: we have scholar-built archives of the works of Dante Gabriel Rossetti (ed. Jerome McGann), A. C. Swinburne (ed. John Walsh), and William Morris (ed. Florence Boos)—but none for the myriad other poets, major and minor, whose works constitute our field of study. It may be that we are waiting to be served in this regard, perhaps by the newly-launched Oxford Scholarly Editions Online (http://oxfordscholarlyeditions.com/) which will eventually digitize its backlist of printed editions. But it seems that we scholars should be pushing into this technology ourselves, creating editions of Tennyson and the Brownings and Christina Rossetti and so many other Victorian poets for scholarly use and re-use. NINES was founded to help make this happen, by changing the culture of peer-review, by providing consulting and workshops, and by building interfaces and tools for discovery. But there are other needs and other pressure points, and we welcome input as to how best pursue our common goals for the future of scholarship. Matthew Arnold CLINTON MACHANN There are no new monographs on Arnold to discuss this year, but a variety of substantial new articles and book chapters deal with his life, career, and individual works in interesting ways. 1 will begin with Christopher M. Keirstead's treatment of Arnold in his book Victorian Poetry, Europe, and the Challenge of Cosmopolitanism (Ohio State Univ. Press, 2011) because it is in fundamental ways representative of Arnold's place in the study of Victorian poetry today. Keirstead's focus on Victorian poets' "cosmopolitanism" in the context of their "unique and vital" encounter with Europe is a legitimate and interesting approach that literary scholars should find helpful. The choice of texts by Arthur Hugh Clough, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Robert Browning, Algernon Charles Swinburne, William Morris, and Thomas Hardy is appropri ate, and the references to Arnold's influence in the Introduction—"Arnold, Europe, and the (Future) Destinations of Victorian Poetry"—and throughout the text makes sense, because indeed his career "forms a microcosm of the broader movement" (p. 10). Keirstead refers to some of Arnold's best-known poems such as "Dover Beach" and "Stanzas from the Grande Chartreuse" but the emphasis is on the ideas he developed in his critical essays after he</page><page sequence="6">352 / VICTORIAN POETRY turned away from the writing of poetry. Throughout the book, major poems by the other poets are in a sense "read against" Arnold, so he is a central figure whose key ideas tie together the book as a whole: "from the critical sidelines, Arnold would continue to press poets as he had pressed himself to fashion a more open intellectual engagement with the Continent and to sustain the genre's relevance to other kinds of border-crossing, whether social, economic, or political" (p. 20). As Keirstead acknowledges, his new study of cosmopolitanism in Victorian poetry in some ways follows up on the work of Amanda Anderson in The Powers of Distance: Cosmopolitanism and the Cultivation of Detachment (2001). Significantly, that book contains a chapter on Arnold that discusses his key concept of "disinterestedness" and places him in the context of works by Charlotte Brontë, Charles Dickens, George Eliot, and Oscar Wilde. Nevertheless, Arnold's critical approach has been controversial through the years. In the 1980s British critics influenced by Marxist ideology intensi fied what had already been a mid-century questioning of Arnold's position as a defender of liberal culture—and politics. Terry Eagleton in Literary Theory (1983) argued that Arnold had played a key role in the displacement of religion by "English literature" as a dominant instrument of "social control." Arnold's supposed patronizing or outright hostile attitude toward the working class was seen to be related to his paternalistic, authoritarian stance. Chris Baldick, in The Social Mission of English Criticism, 1848-1932 (1983), also argued that Arnold's culture, so closely associated with the "humanities" discipline of liter ary studies, functioned as a means of ideological control. At the same time, other well-known developments in academia worked against the significance of Arnold as a "traditional" Victorian writer and thinker. One was the rise of postmodernist theory, including Michel Foucault's ideas about "power" and its shifting patterns and his depiction of history as underlying layers of sup pressed and unconscious knowledge, and Jacques Derrida's deconstruction of literary texts and philosophical skepticism. From these theoretical perspectives, Arnold's assumptions about literature and culture and human nature were hopelessly naive and for some he was a paradigmatic antitheorist. At the same time, for many feminist critics, Arnold was one of the "dead white males." More recently, Francis Mulhern in his book Culture/Metaculture (2000) and in a subsequent series of exchanges with Stephan Collini in New Left Review attacked Arnold's critical ideal of culture, which supposedly is intended to dissolve the political as a "locus of arbitration" in social relations. Of course Arnold has had his defenders all along, and, although Arnold is still routinely identified by some critics with "bourgeois hegemony," as discussions of criti cal theory have become somewhat less polemical in the past decade or so, Arnold's basic concepts of "disinterestedness" and "culture" and his "cosmo politan" stance as discussed by Keirstead are not quite as controversial today</page><page sequence="7">CLINTON MAC HANN / 353 as they were in the recent past. Last year I discussed James Walter Caufield's positive assessment of Arnold's "touchstone method," whereby intuition and concrete examples of poetry are more important than theoretical abstractions. In a more recent essay, '"Poetry is the Reality': Matthew Arnold Tackles the Athletes of Logic (and Theory)" (Cambridge Quarterly 39, no. 3 [2010]: 237 257), Caufield traces the "most prominent polemical tropes" in hostile criti cal assessments of Arnold's "anti-systematic empiricism" from contemporary nineteenth-century criticism to the "high theory" and "cultural studies" of the late twentieth century. It is amusing to follow Caufield's survey of anti Arnoldian positions, grounded in shifting ideological positions through the years. He generalizes that although Arnold later comes to be portrayed—in the retrospective caricatures of some of his late twentieth-century critics—as a kind of titan of elite cultural authority and Liberal hegemony, he was certainly not throwing around much bourgeois-hegemonic weight in the eyes of his contemporaries. On the contrary, they figured him rather as the soft underbelly of Victorian Liberalism, (pp. 242-243) No doubt Arnold's original claims that "criticism" and the "culture" asso ciated with poetry are—to some degree—resistant to politics, ideology, and class consciousness will continue to be problematic for literary and cultural authorities from various schools of thought. Other recent studies have focused on in-depth assessments of Arnold or adaptations of his ideas by prominent individual authors of succeeding genera tions: Anthony Kearney's "Laying Claim: George Saintsbury's Assessment of Matthew Arnold (VP 48, no. 3 [2010]: 327-340) and Marius Hentea's "The Silence of the Last Poet: Matthew Arnold, T. S. Eliot, and the Value of the Classic" (Modern Language Quarterly 71, no. 3 [2010]: 297-328). Kearney shows that in his prolific commentaries on Arnold, Saintsbury on the one hand consistently praises the "Paterian" qualities he found in Arnold's work: his appreciation of poetic beauty for its own sake. On the other hand, he objects to Arnold's persistent search for moral and philosophical truth in poetry. Thus, Saintsbury's "conclusions about Arnold are ambivalent: a shifting back and forth between criticism, admiration, and condescension" (p. 334). Saintsbury sought to establish his own version of Arnold in contrast to contemporaries like John Churton Collins, for example, who advocated the promotion of Arnoldian values associated with spirituality and morality in literary studies. Saintsbury wanted to establish himself as the preeminent Arnold critic, but, as Kearney points out, Eliot, the next major critic interested in Arnold, does not mention him. Eliot's "dismissal" of him is ironic "because no one had done more than Saintsbury to exert his own authority over Arnold at the expense of other views and now Eliot was doing much the same" (p. 338).</page><page sequence="8">354 / VICTORIAN POETRY Hentea analyzes Eliot's own ambivalent treatment of Arnold as he explores the idea of the "classic" developed in critical essays by both authors, with emphasis on Eliot's "What is a Classic?" (which originated as an address to the Virgil Society in London in 1944) and Arnold's "The Study of Poetry." Eliot's talk is "a disguised commentary on Arnold" (p. 301). Ironically, Eliot sought to undermine Arnold's ideas although his critical methodology was similar to the Victorian's and they shared an anxiety about democracy and culture. Of course both men were "poet-critics" and in fact "the defining critics of their times" (p. 304). Hentea points out that they chose opposing models of the classic: Homer for Arnold, Virgil for Eliot. Nevertheless, each man in his own way was reaching toward a transcendental or religious concept of the classic. Along the way, Mentea quotes Laurence Mazzeno's pungent comment that "perhaps no one has done more to damage Arnold's reputation than T. S. Eliot" (p. 303), but some of his own observations about Arnold are interesting in themselves. For example, in describing Arnold's move from poetry to critical prose, he refers to his genuine "poetic gift" but judges that "serviceable and unimaginative, Arnold's prose does not contain any trace of the poetry he had abandoned" (p. 305). And in the context of Keirstead's study, discussed above, the following comment is striking: "While he spent a lifetime insisting on closer links between England and the Continent, Arnold was hardly a cosmopolitan thinker" (p. 316). As illustrated by the recent work already discussed, Arnold s reputation through the years has been complex, as he has been evaluated by generations of critics, and his identity as a "poet turned critic" has been central to inter pretations of his literary career. I am pleased to note, however, that new read ings of individual Arnold poems appear from time to time, and I will discuss two recent ones: Peter Cook's "Scholarship and Integrity: Matthew Arnold's 'The Scholar Gipsy' and Anita Desai's 'Scholar and Gypsy'" (Alif: Journal of Comparative Poetics 29 [2009]: 195-214) and Nils Clausson's "Pastoral Elegy into Romantic Lyric: Generic Transformation in Matthew Arnold's 'Thyrsis' (VP 48, no. 2 [2010]: 173-194.) Both "The Scholar-Gipsy" and "Thyrsis" are associated with Arnold's friend Arthur Hugh Clough. Arnold and Clough were familiar with the source of the scholar-gypsy legend, Joseph Glanvill's seventeenth-century book The Vanity of Dogmatizing, and the two young poets had walked together in the Cumnor countryside near Oxford where the poem is set. Although he was not finally satisfied with the poem—anticipating some critics who would see his scholar-gypsy as irresponsible—Arnold clearly was attempting to create a more adequate version of the solitary questers who wander through his early poetry. For Arnold the myth of the scholar-gypsy stood for unity, stability, and creativity in a world of change and frustration, and this 1853 poem anticipates his notion of the "best" self, as distinct from the "ordinary" self, which he developed in his critical prose. At the same time,</page><page sequence="9">CLINTON MACHA NN/ 355 in spite of Arnold's earlier critical remarks about Keatsian lyricism, which he had contrasted with the classical "grand style," "The Scholar-Gipsy" shows evidence of Keats's influence. "Thyrsis" is Arnold's elegy on Clough. Arnold held deeply conflicted feelings about his old friend who had died young, but he finally finished the poem some four and a half years after Clough's death in 1861. There is no doubt that Arnold was nostalgic about the time spent with his friend at Oxford and that he continued to feel genuine affection for Clough, but his feelings were complicated by the fact that, while working on the elegy in 1865, he read a collection of Clough's letters and was troubled by evidence he found of apparent emotional instability and, during his time at Rugby, overdependence on Arnold's father, Headmaster Thomas Arnold. At any rate he adapted the pastoral imagery and the associations with the Cumnor countryside from "The Scholar Gypsy" to explore his theme of the truth-quest in relation to Clough. Arnold's contemporaries singled out the poem for praise, and Swinburne declared that poem was, along with Milton's "Lycidas" and Shelley's "Adonais," one of the three great English elegies, but various twentieth-century Arnold critics found flaws in his portrait of Clough and his handling of the elegiac form. According to Cook's new reading, "The Scholar-Gipsy' "evokes, in some of the greatest poetry of the nineteenth century, two quite separate journeys of discovery—that of the Scholar-Gipsy and that of the narrator—in order to establish their respective relationships with the third protagonist, the university" (p. 196). He argues that most critical readings of the poem have failed to adequately examine the experience of the narrator, who, unlike the idealized Scholar-Gipsy on his continuous journey of exploration, remains tied to the scholarly community of the university. After roaming with the gypsies, he will return to society in order to share his radical new knowledge, associated with a Romantic agenda to regenerate mankind. Like the narra tor, readers of the poem cannot attain the full freedom and autonomy of the Scholar-Gipsy, but they are invited to "re-think" themselves as scholars. Cook then compares Arnold's poem with the 1978 short story "Scholar and Gypsy" by Indian novelist Anita Desai. In her story about an American couple who come to India in the 1970s, David, the protagonist, is an intellectual who lacks integrity and learns nothing from his journey to the East, but in this negative example Cook finds an implicit plea for the kind of scholarly integrity that Arnold is searching for in his poem. Cook's remarkable comparative study is unique but his treatment of the "Gypsy" theme in Arnold's work reminds me of other recent discussions of that theme by Antony H. Harrison and Lance Wilder that I cited in last year's essay. Clausson's new reading of "Thyrsis" is provocative in claiming that critics' "exclusive" classification of the poem as a pastoral elegy has obscured its meaning. He argues that it is "in fact, a generically mixed lyric that combines</page><page sequence="10">356 / VICTORIAN POETRY the conventions of the classical pastoral elegy with the new kind of poem we now identify as distinctively Romantic, the lyric genre that M. H. Abrams calls the greater Romantic lyric" (p. 174). In his view Arnold's poem "experimentally fuses what appear to be two incompatible genres" (p. 17 5), and in this he was influenced by Thomas Gray's early move in this direction: "Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard" (1751). In discussing "Thyrsis" as a Romantic lyric Clausson compares it in particular to Wordsworth's "Tintern Abbey" and Coleridge's "Frost at Midnight." The comparison to Coleridge's "conversation poem" is particularly interesting. In his reading of "Thyrsis," Clausson stresses the much-criticized conclusion of the poem. Readers who fault Arnold for "digressing" in his concern for his own loss of poetic powers at that point do not appreciate the fact that throughout the poem Arnold has been mourning both the loss of his friend and his own vocation as a poet. Significantly, the "light" that Arnold will be pursuing after this loss "will not be the light of poetry but of socially engaged criticism" (p. 190). In this context Clausson quotes John Rosenberg's generalization that "Arnold's most original poetry is about the near impossibility of writing poetry in mid-Victorian England" (p. 192). It turns out that even the new readings of individual Arnold poems emphasize the "poet-critic" image of Arnold characteristic of discussions of his criticism. Finally, a recent book about "Victorian fatherhood" includes a chapter that explores both Arnold's role as a father and his relationship with Thomas Arnold, his own father: "Matthew and Son (and Father): The Arnolds," in Valerie Sanders's The Tragedy of Victorian Fatherhood (Cambridge Univ. Press, 2009). In this study of Victorian culture, Sanders examines a characteristic uncertainty about masculinity in general and "fatherhood" in particular. Not surprisingly, she finds that there was something "overwhelming" about the masculinity of Thomas Arnold, headmaster of Rugby, and "evidence from memoirs and periodicals indeed confirms that for many mid-Victorians Ar nold was the supreme father figure." His death in 1842 "plunged a nation of ex-schoolboys into symbolic orphanhood" (p. 195). In contrast, "Matthew favoured a foppish dilettantism; fittingly, perhaps, fathered sickly sons; and was forced to define himself and his family in terms of a very different kind of masculinity" (p. 110). Nevertheless, Thomas Arnold "was Matthew's spiritual guide as well as his biological parent, his teacher as well as his playmate, and the embodiment of a particular model of masculinity that was physically as well as mentally omnipotent" (pp. 120-121). Readers already familiar with Arnold's life from biographies by Park Honan, Nicholas Murray, and Ian Hamilton, or other sources will find that Sanders adds her own insights to fundamental family issues that have been widely discussed in the past. As she suggests, "Perhaps because his imaginary dialogue with his father so often incorporated the triple activities of writing, education and fatherhood—the</page><page sequence="11">MARJORIE STONE/ 357 three most significant of his own adult life—Arnold found it impossible to stop evaluating the intertwining of their parallel experiences" (p. 114). Of course there is emphasis on the profound impact of tragic loss in Arnold's family: he was a dedicated and affectionate father, and the premature death of three of his four sons was the greatest sorrow of his life. However, she reminds us that it was "as a father of daughters that Matthew was happiest and most suc cessful" (p. 132). Overall, Sanders judges him to be the "most domestic" of all the Victorian fathers discussed in her book (p. 134). As one might expect, Sanders touches on the father-son theme in some of Arnold's poems. Most obvious is his elegiac tribute to his father in "Rugby Chapel." However, any kind of "biographical reading" is problematic in the case of other poems, notably "Sohrab and Rustum" (1853), in which a father "unknowingly kills his own son in an inversion of the Oedipus myth" (p. 125). I will close with Sanders' observation that many commentators have noted the problem Arnold had in finding a "meaningful career" to match that of his father. Elizabeth Barrett Browning MARJORIE STONE Work covered this year is notable for its interdisciplinary range, interna tionalization, and volume. Topics include not only the politics of gender and nations, prosody, religion, the classical tradition, and relationships with other writers (this year, George Sand, Margaret Fuller, Emily Dickinson, and Robert Browning), but also medievalism, Darwinism, dance, sculpture, domestic servants, animal/human boundaries, literary tourism, and psychology. New publications in the US, Britain, France, Canada, Germany, Australia, and Uraguay include Volume 18 of The Brownings' Correspondence, a monograph by Simon Avery, more than twenty book chapters and articles, and a popular izing biography; there are also new digital resources. Along with criticism on Aurora Leigh, Sonnets from the Portuguese, Casa Guidi Windows, and well-known shorter works like "The Cry of the Children" and the sonnets to Sand, crit ics discuss EBB's three poems on Queen Victoria, her ballads, her poems to Flush, her 1831-32 diary, religious works such as "The Virgin Mary to the Child Jesus," and unpublished works such as the "The Princess Marie." With the exception of Avery, this scholarship does not yet draw upon new information and materials in the Pickering and Chatto Works of Elizabeth Banett Browning (hereafter WEBB·, see the 2010 "Year's Work"). Reviews of the edition have begun to appear, however, by Anthony Harrison and Stephen Prickett in the on-line journal Review 19 &lt; http://www.nbol-19.org/view&gt; and by Joe Phelan</page><page sequence="12">358 / VICTORIAN POETRY in the TLS (July 14, 2010). There is also a review essay by Alison Chapman, "Revolutionizing Elizabeth Barrett Browning," in Victorian Literature and Culture (39, no. 2 (2011) addressing the "new EBB"—"embedded within her complex intellectual, literary, and cultural networks: provocative, politicized, experimental, and modern"—revealed by recent scholarship Recovery of this "new EBB" would have been impossible without the The Brownings' Correspondence (Wedgestone Press, 1984- ), and other editions of letters steadily being incorporated into its comprehensively annotated pages. Edited by Philip Kelley, Scott Lewis, and Edward Hagan, Volume 18 covers the period from February 1852 to March 1853. Reflecting EBB's self-identification as a "citizenness of the world" and her love of "wild wandering gypsey habits" (pp. 126, 254), the volume conveys the Brownings' continental mobility. The first section finds them living an animated life in Paris on the Champs Elysées in the political ferment following the coup d'état of Louis Napoleon, mingling with writers and intellectuals. Accounts of EBB's long desired meeting with George Sand feature frequently. The middle section covers the Brownings' stay in London from July to early October, 1852, where they saw or met many other English and American writers, among them Tennyson, Coventry Pat more, John Ruskin—whose collection of "Turners" EBB considered "divine" (p. 220), James Russell Lowell and his poet-wife Maria, Richmond Monckton Milnes, and the Christian socialist Charles Kingsley. Kingsley is one of the probable models for Romney in Aurora Leigh: EBB expresses admiration for his "originality &amp; intenseness" despite his "wild &amp; theoretical" ideas (pp. 208, 205). He had a less charitable opinion of the Brownings, however, as a letter cited in the volume's "Supporting Documents" indicates: "he [RB] is very clever, but low-bred, effeminate ... a man who fancies that a man can be a poet by profession—&amp;. do nothing else—a wild mistake. She is wonderful: but very obstinate in her bad taste, &amp; considers Socialism as stuff" (p. 370). The final part of Volume 18 covers the Brownings' journey back to Italy with a stop in Paris to savor "the palpitating life" of the boulevards (p. 274). Most of the letters are by EBB. While many are previously published in whole or in part, numerous letters are here published for the first time, including two to the women's rights activist Bessie Rayner Parkes. Some of the most revealing new letters are to Sarah Jane Streatfeild, of whom EBB remarked that she "is wild as a bird &amp; won't sit upon everybody's finger" (p. 152). Streatfeild's short but intimate relationship with the Brownings is detailed in Appendix I (pp. 353-356). Although EBB did not begin concerted work on Aurora Leigh until she had returned to Florence in 1853, many details in these letters suggest the impact of her experiences in Paris and in London in 1852 on her most ambitious work. In Elizabeth Barrett Browning (2010, Northcote), Simon Avery uses the "search for a 'home'" as a focus for a concise, engaging analysis of poems</page><page sequence="13">MAR/ORIE STONE/359 throughout EBB's career (p. xviii), complementing his earlier analyses in Elizabeth Barrett Browning (2003, Longman), coauthored with Rebecca Stott, and his essays in the 2006 VP and Victorian Review bicentenary issues on EBB. Avery is especially adept at contextualizing EBB's poetry within intellectual and political as well as literary history. Chapter 1, "The Shaping of a Poetics," explores EBB's "changing sense of her role as she shaped and refashioned her poetics," focusing on "the extensive number of poems which she composed about poets" (p. 2) or poetic fame, such as "The Progress of Genius," "The Vision of Fame," and "The Poet's Vow," as well as poems addressed to or memorializing Byron, Wordsworth, William Cowper, Felicia Hemans, Letitia Landon, and George Sand. Avery concludes that "few poets seem to have constantly interrogated their own vocation so overtly, so publicly and so obses sively" (p. 26). Chapter 2, "The Search for a Spiritual Home," analyzes "The Seraphim" and "A Drama of Exile," reading them in the context of religious controversies of the 1830s and 1840s precipitated by scientific developments and biblical higher criticism. Like Anthony H. Harrison, Avery finds '"ad venturous poetic strategies'" (p. 33) in "The Seraphim"; in treating "A Drama of Exile," he addresses the "generically complex" tactics used to rewrite the "andocentric tradition" (p. 36). Chapter 3, "The Search for an Emotional Home," discusses the ballads of the 1830s and 1840s, arguing that "whilst EBB repeatedly explores love as a potential solution to her speakers' quests for a secure home in the world, these explorations often reveal love and relation ships to be unsatisfactory and anxiety-ridden at best and, indeed, sometimes brutally destructive" (p. 42). Avery's analysis of "The Romaunt of Margret," EBB's 1836 gothic ballad about a demonic double, is particularly insightful. He also develops suggestive contrasts between the "single-sex," "ecological" erotic fantasy of "An Island" and the blighted heterosexual romantic love in "A Romance of the Ganges," "The Romance of the Swan's Nest," and "The Romaunt of the Page." In Chapters 4 and 5, Avery discusses "The Search for a Political Home" in EBB's poetry and "Restructuring Home" in Aurora Leigh. As he notes, "EBB's career spans five decades which witnessed a series of major nationalist uprisings across Europe ... galvanized by ideals of the French Revolution" (p. 56). This is a point underscored by the poet's remark in a newly published letter in Volume 18 of The Brownings' Correspondence: "Wherever we go we stand face to face with a revolution" (p. 55). Along with "The Cry of the Children" and "The Runaway Slave at Pilgrim's Point," Avery analyzes early poems prompted by the Greek nationalist patriot Rhigas Feraios and by Teresa del Riego, widow of a Spanish patriot, as well as the juxtaposition in Poems (1844) of "Crowned and Buried" on Napoleon and "Crowned and Wedded" on Queen Victoria. Despite EBB's "Whig" support for "the legal, civil and</page><page sequence="14">360/VICTORIAN POETRY religious rights of the individual" (p. 55), Avery concludes that "the notion of a supportive state was fundamental to the ideal of home she constantly inter rogated in her works even if it often seemed impossible to bring into being" (p. 70). In Aurora Leigh "the eponymous heroine" finds "a resolution to the quest for home which draws together the spiritual, emotional and the politi cal"—but only through "negotiation of the dominant nineteenth-century family unit" (pp. 71, 74). Avery discusses the successive journeys that are "structurally central to the text" (p. 75), presenting an especially original argument for the pivotal role of France, the '"poet of the nations,'" in providing "the greatest opportunities for social and political transformation" (p. 87)—a departure from the prevailing focus on Italy's role in EBB's life and writing, continuing this year (see below). While Aurora Leigh succeeds in envisaging "a suitable home for the intellectual woman in the modern world" (p. 98), Avery finds a more pessimistic view in EBB's later poems. In a coda, "The Exile and the Empty Home," he observes that in Poems before Congress (1860) and the posthumous Last Poems (1862), the "establishment of a political homeland seems further away than ever": "time and again EBB's speakers and protagonists are left in a state of exile—from God and religious certainty, from love and a meaning ful relationship, or from supportive political structures," as in the "empty heart and home" depicted in "Parting Lovers" (1. 56), a companion poem to "Mother and Poet" (pp. 99-101). EBB's critique in Book V of Aurora Leigh of the poet who "trundles back his soul five hundred years" (1. 191) indicates that, unlike many of her contemporaries, she did not turn back to the Middle Ages for a spiritual or cultural home. In this respect, as Clare Broome Saunders demonstrates in Women Writers and Nineteenth-Century Medievalism (Palgrave Macmillan, 2009), she resembled numerous other women writers. Bringing welcome attention to writers excluded from earlier studies of nineteenth-century medievalism, Saun ders argues that poets such as Amelia Opie, Hemans, Landon, and EBB used medievalism to critique the "revival of past errors in the present," especially gendered chivalric codes, and to "provide a mask for political commentary considered inappropriate for their sex" (pp. 6-7). Chapter 1, "Recasting the Courtly: Translations of Medieval Language and Form," includes an analysis of Sonnets from the Portuguese as a sequence subverting "a poetic form dominated from its medieval origins by men" (p. 14)—a well-established critical approach, though one contested this year by Marianne van Remoortel (below). Chapter 1 also juxtaposes EBB's "translation" of courtly love conventions with the less familiar medieval translations of Louisa Stuart Costello. This opens up new terrain, more especially because Costello's translations of early French poetry were praised in the New Monthly Magazine in 1835, raising the question of their possible influence on EBB's participation in medieval translation projects such as The Poems of Geoffrey Chaucer, Modernized (1841) and the</page><page sequence="15">MAR/ORÍ E STONE/ 361 teeming medieval allusions in poems of the early 1840s such as "The Lost Bower" (documented in the WEBB headnotes and annotations). In Chapter 3, "Romance, Gender and the Crimean," Saunders first expands upon her 2006 article in the VP bicentenary issue by discussing ballads such as "The Romaunt of the Page" and "Rhyme of the Duchess May," then presents an innovative analysis of EBB's comments on Florence Nightingale and the Crimean War in the context of "images of medieval chivalry and legendary heroic deeds" in government propaganda and the popular press, designed to obscure "firsthand accounts of suffering" on the battlefront (p. 63). Chapter 4, surveying treatments of Joan of Arc by Robert Southey, Thomas de Quincey, and others, again provides an illuminating context for a remark in EBB's cor respondence: in this case, her indication to Mary Russell Mitford in 1841-42 that she was considering an extended work on the French warrior maid, as opposed to Napoleon (Saunders, pp. 90-91). This chapter also treats the Joan of Arc allusions in EBB's sonnets to George Sand, as well as the unpublished ballad "The Princess Marie" on the sculptor-daughter of King Louis Philippe of France, now available in WEBB (5:616-625). Chapter 5, "Queenship, Chiv alry, and 'Queenly' Women in the Age of Victoria" includes a discussion of EBB's work of juvenilia defending Queen Caroline and her three poems on Queen Victoria: "The Young Queen" and "Victoria's Tears," both published in 1837 in The Athenaeum, and "Crowned and Wedded"—dated as 1844 by Saunders, but first published in 1840 in the same periodical (see WEBB, 2:1). Here again, Saunders' discussion is especially useful in situating EBB's poems within their historical contexts. Like Saunders, Elizabeth P. Gray provides a valuable set of contexts for appreciating EBB's poetic practice in Christian and Lyric Tradition in Victorian Women's Poetry (Routledge, 2009), although Gray treats fewer poems by her and at less length, given her express aim to offer "a fresh evaluation" of "more obscure Victorian women religious poets" (p. 1). Most notably, in discussing EBB's "long, rich dramatic monologue," "The Virgin Mary to the Child Je sus," Gray challenges Cynthia Scheinberg's argument that "literary depictions of Mary as a Jewish woman grant her prophetic voice," while "construction of her as Christian woman render her silenced" (pp. 96-97). Gray argues to the contrary that a number of Victorian women poets present Mary "as the foremost Christian singer," although Protestant women "struggle with the conundrum of honouring Mary but also avoiding honouring her overmuch" (p. 94)—certainly true of EBB's poem. Since Gray restricts her study to lyric poetry, she does not consider The Seraphim or A Drama of Exile, although she calls for more attention to Victorian women writers' "epic retellings of scriptural originals" in her conclusion (p. 228). Gray's segregation of an exclu sively female tradition may present "the very particular creative and spiritual community" she explores (p. 227) as more self-contained than it in fact was.</page><page sequence="16">362 / VICTORIAN POETRY EBB's representations of Mary, for instance, engage with James Montgom ery's phenomenally popular religious epic The Messiah, which she criticized as something her dog Flush might have written (see the 2005 "Year's Work"). Nevertheless, Gray's study of commonalities within women's religious poetry across denominations has many applications to EBB's writing: especially her analyses of themes such as the question of the appropriate poetic style for '"speaking God,' that is speaking o/God and speaking to God" (p. 8), or strategies for rewriting religious "master narratives" (p. 9). Like Gray, Marianne van Remoortel focuses on a female tradition in her interpretation of Sonnets from the Portuguese in Lives of the Sonnet, 1787-1895: Genre, Gender and Criticism (Ashgate, 2011). Whereas Saunders interprets EBB as groundbreaking in rewriting medieval sonnet conventions from a woman's perspective, Remoortel locates the sequence in the context of sonnet-writing by a host of other Romantic and early Victorian women, from Joanna Baillie to Felicia Hemans and Caroline Norton, documenting what the New Monthly Magazine in 1821 referred to as the '"prevalent disorder'" of '"Sonnettoma nia'" (p. 98). In analyzing these sonnet-writing "grandmothers" in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, van Remootel makes an important contribution to histories of the genre. She emphasizes the parallels between the themes addressed by these "poetesses" and those in Sonnets from the Portuguese: "love, death, faith, grief, hope, doubt, youth, nature," as well as illness (pp. 99-100). One textual parallel she notes between EBB's Sonnet 29 ("I think of thee") and a passage in a cycle of some 170 sonnets by Emmeline Stuart Wortely published in 1839 is particularly striking (p. 101). (Van Remoortel also addresses this connection in a posting on Alison Chapman's new web resource, the Victorian Poetry Network &lt;www. web.uvic.ca/~vicpoet). More controversially, Van Remoortel argues that "every single strategy allegedly . . . used by the woman speaker" in Sonnets from the Portuguese to "posit her sub jectivity vis-á-vis her future poet husband and the amatory sonnet tradition loses its rebelliousness when read as a paradigm of Victorian courtship ritual and female authorship" (p. 89). She also asserts that the Victorian critics who "cherished" the sequence for its "conservatism" and modern feminist critics who celebrate its "progressiveness" quote "exactly the same passages to support their arguments" (p. 96). The summary of criticism articulating the latter view (by Angela Leighton, Sarah Paul, Isobel Armstrong, and Margaret Morlier—see pp. 91-92) does not do justice to the subtlety and variation of scholarship on the "progressive" side—published by male as well as female critics, it should be noted. That said, Van Remoortel makes a compelling case that "by the nineteenth century," the sonnet had become a genre with "mixed gender affiliations" (p. 89), even if her own argument primarily ad dresses EBB's affinities with other "poetesses." The "mixed gender affiliations," of both poets themselves and poetic</page><page sequence="17">MAR/OR JE STONE/ 363 genres such as the sonnet, are also very much at play in Amy Billone's '"Thy woman's hair, my sister, all unshorn': EBB's Sonnets to George Sand'" (VP 48, no. 4 [2010]: 577-593), one of this year's most original articles. Bilione provides a dialectical reading of these "stylistically dense" sonnets (p. 578) in an essay that is itself stylistically innovative, modeled on the structure of "the Victorian sonnet pair" as a form. To do so, she offers "competing readings" of the sonnets designed not to "cancel one another," but to "illuminate the mechanisms that EBB employs both to assess and to reevaluate the perplexing relations among the gendered body, silence, and the sonnet form" (p. 579). First, Bilione subtly reads "To George Sand: A Desire" as expressing EBB's desire to "assume Sand's position of'pure genius,"' and "To George Sand: A Recognition" as embodying her resignation to the "inescapable affiliation with the female body." She then re-examines the sonnets in the context of Sand's fiction to come to a more "affirmative answer" to the question: "Does the son net as a synechdoche of lyric poetry succeed or fail to transcend the gendered constraints of the human body?" (p. 579). In developing her complex double argument, Bilione demonstrates how a paradoxical combination of tribute and critique is manifested at the level of form in "To George Sand: A Desire" in the modulation from the initial metrical "cacophony" and irregularity of the opening lines centered on Sand ("Thou ...") to a "highly alliterative," "euphonic" second quatrain, where EBB enters the poem as the assertive speaking and subject ("I would...") (pp. 579-581). She thus finds "an appropria tive impulse" in this sonnet (p. 582), also evident in EBB's "On a Portrait of Wordsworth by B. R. Haydon," but one here modulated by EBB's profound identification with Sand and the "recognition" of shared womanhood in the second sonnet. Bilione points out that the "'revolted cry'" of recognition here leads to a conclusion mirroring "the conclusion of many of Sand's novels" in its representation of an escape from the gendered body only realizable in death (p. 583). In the final counterpointed section of her article, however, she finds a source of greater optimism in analyzing EBB's response to Sand's artistic achievement. In effect, "Sand the author may have arrived at the very afterlife in her writings that her characters inconsolably craved," achieving through her art the "androgyny that EBB associates with the afterlife" (pp. 587,590). Hence the intense "love of Sand's writing" expressed by the English poet and her address to her as "my sister" (p. 589): a love persisting into the 1850s, as the letters in Volume 18 of The Brownings' Correspondence attest (see above). Bilione adeptly shuttles between analyzing the sonnets' contexts and their meter and metaphors, exemplifying the partnering of neoformalism with cultural studies and new historicism called for by critics such as Caroline Levine, Herbert Tucker, and E. Warwick Slinn. Levine and Tucker this year again consider the intricate intersections of politics with prosody in EBB's poetry, the subject of their spirited 2006</page><page sequence="18">364 / VICTORIAN POETRY exchange in Victorian Studies over various kinds of "form" at work in "The Cry of the Children" (see the 2008 "Year's Work"). In her cogent, original, and forceful "Rhythms, Poetic and Political: The Case of Elizabeth Barrett Browning" (VP 49, no. 2 [235-254]), Levine identifies three models of reading the "politics of prosody"—"the ideological, the reflective, and the expressive" —then points out that all three "cast poetic form as a secondary effect." She argues to the contrary that "meter may itself exert or transmit power" (pp. 235-237): a possibility reinforced by research on unconscious "style matching" between the Brownings in one of the two articles relating to EBB written by psychologists this year (Ireland and Pennebaker, below). Levine thus turns her attention from the larger social and political "forms" that she fruitfully interrogates in her 2006 Victorian Studies essay to the prosody that is the principal focus of Tucker's "reply" to it. At the same time, she dialogically considers the imbrication of metrical forms with social and political forms through a complex analysis of EBB's three poems on Queen Victoria, poems often dismissed as "mawkish and inelegant" (p. 238). In "The Young Queen," Levine closely analyzes the interaction between EBB's "shaping of temporal experience through metre" and her use of a fourteener within "altered poulter's measure" to convey the rhythms and disruptions in the poem's "surprising layering of temporal registers": "the moment of death, the ceremonial time of the funeral, the transition from childhood to adulthood, and the abrupt transfer of state power" (pp. 238-239, 241). While one could read EBB's resistance to metrical regularity as "expressive" of her "liberalism" in politics, as Levine notes, her own more dialectical reading instead engages with the "multiple tempos" in the situation and institutions the poem concerns (p. 242). In "Victoria's Tears," Levine analyzes the "chiasmus" of its literary and political form and the similar way it "both evokes and refuses poulter's mea sure" (pp. 243, 245). "Crowned and Wedded," she suggests, has more metrical affinities with EBB's two earlier poems on the subject than with the poem on Napoleon ("Crowned and Buried") it is paired with because '"The Young Queen' acts as a metrical sourcebook for the two poems that follow" (p. 246). Whether or not EBB deploys fourteeners in the three poems in a manner "independent of the politics they describe," as Levine observes at one point (p. 247), this article provocatively opens up the subject of negotiations with the "law" of meter and "the organizing forms of the world" (p. 249). Taking an approach Levine might term "reflective," Tucker more briefly treats the "specifically industrial experiment in the poetics of fatigue" in "The Cry of the Children" (pp. 124-127 of "Over Worked, Worked Over: A Poetics of Fa tigue" in The Feeling of Reading: Affective Experience and Victorian Literature, ed. Rachael Ablow [Michigan Univ.Press, 2010], pp. 114-130). Tucker's analysis of the poem's "piston-pushing, time-clock-punching" meter, in which the poem's "rhythm, its actual cry," rebels "against the metre" (p. 125), extends the argu</page><page sequence="19">MARJORIE STONE/ 365 ment he initiated in his 2006 Victorian Studies response to Levine, reframing it within an illuminating consideration of the diverse forces and sensations contributing to poetic fatigue in Victorian poets and poems. Tucker's and Levine's analyses of EBB's experimental rhythms invite comparison with Robert Stark's findings concerning the versification of Aurora Leigh (see the 2010 "Year's Work"). The most substantial of four treatments of Aurora Leigh this year, aside from Avery's (above), is Clinton Machann's investigation of "Barrett Brown ing's Construction of Masculinity" in the novel-epic, Chapter 3 in his book Masculinity in Four Victorian Epics: A Darwinist Reading (Ashgate, 2010). Mach ann's reading of EBB's "complex and distinctive" (p. 58) representations of masculinity in the figures of Aurora's father and Romney Leigh is especially innovative because he departs from the usual focus on confining patriarchal traditions and reads masculinity through the lens of literary Darwinism instead (Darwinism also figures in Jennifer McDonnell's analysis of EBB's relationship with Flush, below). Machann's analysis of Aurora Leigh is best appreciated by first reading his very useful overviews of research on Victo rian masculinity studies and literary Darwinism in Chapter 1, signaling his skepticism of approaches to gender as purely "constructionist" (p. 16), given scientific evidence of sex differences in "adaptationist theory" and related "biocultural" approaches (p. 22). In discussing Aurora Leigh, he emphasizes the "many positive masculine traits consistent with the normative values of Victorian bourgeois respectability" that Romney exhibits, even in his early "systematic, egotistic" phase, along with the "integrity" and "loyalty" that make him an "exceptional male mating partner" (pp. 67,69). Observing that Romney is "placed in social contexts where the reader is invited to compare him with other male characters, most notably at the evening party at Lord Howe's" in Book V, Machann remarks upon his combination of "unquestioned sexual morality" with "sexual attractiveness," underscored by "the passion of Lady Waldemar" (p. 70): a sexual attractiveness maintained after his blinding, when Romney is "active, not passive" in seeking out Marian and Aurora in Italy (p. 78). Machann also discusses Aurora's meditations on "the difference between men and women in sexual matters" in light of evidence for "biologi cal differences" in scientific research, and he charts the poem's displacement of traditional epic's "male violence" and "vividly described scenes" of male combat by "intense female-female competition" between Aurora and Lady Waldemar (pp. 75-77). Although he notes the curious absence of rivalry between Aurora and Marian, he does not see this "same-sex relationship" as "Aurora's ultimate personal goal in life" (p. 75). While Machann attributes some of these elements in Aurora Leigh to its emphasis on "psychological drama"—a feature he relates to spasmodic epics such as Alexander Smith's A Life Drama (pp. 77-9)-they also demonstrate how "Aurora's life history is</page><page sequence="20">366/ VICTORIAN POETRY quite successful in terms of our most basic model of human nature" and adaptation, he concludes (p. 80). Machann's original analysis of Romney's "extraordinary masculinity" (pp. 69, 72) brings out both the man's essential nobility as a social reformer and his sex appeal. One can imagine this analysis sparking lively debates in a classroom populated by students at the most active mating phase in their life cycles. Such debates about sexuality and mating might be enriched by Cheryl A. Wilson's Literature and Dance in Nineteenth-Century Britain (Cambridge University Press, 2009), which includes a perceptive analysis of "the images and rhetoric of dance" in Aurora Leigh in Chapter 5: especially that '"inde cent foreign dance called the Waltz,'" as it was termed early in the century (pp. 140, 136). Wilson does not mention Aurora's reference to dancing the more recently imported "polka and Cellarius" in Book I, 1. 424, alluding to the waltz-mazurka named after Henri Cellarius that was a sensation in the 1840s (see WEBB, 3:271, n.45), although it further bears out the validity of her thesis. "Literary texts that incorporate the waltz are particularly invested in female physicality, specifically the ways in which women's bodies displace their voices," Wilson argues (p. 138). She concentrates as much on the ways in which Aurora's language assumes physical form" because she "equates bod ies with self-expression" (p. 141) as on her dance metaphors per se. Although such dance images do not seem to be as pervasive in the poem as the walking images Anne Wallace incisively treats in her 1997 ELH article (an analysis Wilson might have usefully referenced), Wilson does discover and analyze an intriguing array of waltz metaphors: as in Aurora's description of the dizzying effect of reading Proclus (V.1231-33), or in her much cited reference to the '"use ofwoman's figures'" (VIII.1127-32), which Wilson reads as incorporating metaphoric figures of dance as well as sewing (pp. 142-143). In further support of her thesis, Book IV includes idle chat amongst the wealthier classes attend ing Romney's stage marriage to Marian abut waltzing "three hours back. Up at six, / Up still at ten; scarce time to change one's shoes" (11. 621-622). "The presence of dance in Aurora Leigh is central to Aurora's development as an artist and individual," Wilson observes; it is related to issues of "mobility" as well as "questions of nationalism and sexuality" (pp. 144-145). Wilson briefly addresses the questions of nationality in EBB's "The Dance" in Poems before Congress (1860), which depicts "a solemn dance between Italian women and French men," culminating in an extraordinary homoerotic image of Florentine men kissing these French "martial strangers mouth to mouth" (pp. 145-146). Her analysis concludes with an insightful close reading of the metaphors of dance and "viols" in Book VIII of Aurora Leigh (11.1016-19, 1039-42). Both Machann's analysis of Aurora Leigh through the lens of literary Darwinism and Wilson's consideration of its dance metaphors may suggest reasons why Aurora Leigh has always held a particular attraction to female</page><page sequence="21">MARJORIE STONE/367 readers. This is a point emphasized by Paula Marantz Cohen in her TLS "Com mentary," '"You Misconceive the Question': Reconsidering Elizabeth Barrett Browning's 'Aurora Leigh'" (February 11, 2011, pp. 14-15), which returns to Virginia Woolf s assessment of Aurora Leigh. While Cohen's essay seems a little dated in referring primarily to feminist criticism of the 1980s —not more recent and diverse readings of Aurora Leigh from perspectives other than its gender politics—she does suggestively contrast the reception of EBB's epic with that of Wordsworth's The Prelude. Unlike Machann, Cohen rather reductively characterizes Romney as a two-dimensional character transformed from "a boorish denigrator to an enthralled acolyte" of Aurora's writing. Marianne Camus' "Entre air et terre: les 'éléments dans Aurora Leigh d'Elizabeth Barrett Browning," Cahiers victoriens et édouardiens 71 (April 2010): 37-48, demonstrates that different image-systems are used to depict Aurora and Romney in her nuanced reading of imagery of the four elements in Aurora Leigh. Aurora is repeatedly associated with images of air and wind, as in Book VI.217, "My soul's in haste to leap into the sun'" and "best have air, air, although it comes with fire" (VII.697). In contrast, Romney, like the working classes whose suf fering he laments, is associated initially with images of earth until purified by fire: his systematic rationality is "built up as walls are, brick by brick" (IV.353), while his idealistic attempts at reform are reduced to "eating clay" (VIII.630 635). Water, Camus notes, is relatively absent from the poem, except in its destructive aspects: as in the image of the "hard sea bites," Marian's metaphor for her suffering (VI.805). Camus is also the author of Elizabeth Barrett Browning in Italy, one of two essays on EBB in The Victorians and Italy: Literature, Travel, Politics and Art (ed. Alessandro Vescovi, Luisa Villa, and Paul Vita [Polimetrica, 2009], pp. 225-235). Here she explores EBB's "personal response" and "fluctuating relationship" to Italy as expressed in her correspondence (p. 225), noting how the poet associates her renewed health and vigor in Italy with her arrival at what she terms "woman's estate" (p. 226), and analyzing the liberating "life of the body" she experienced (pp. 227-228), a theme also discussed this year by Isobel Hurst and Páraic Finnerty (below). Camus persuasively critiques the romanticizing "Englishness" that characterizes some of EBB's descriptions of Italy (p. 229), arguing that "she looked at the Italians as she looked at land scapes" and sometimes characterized them as children (pp. 231-232). While this is true, Camus' essay (largely limited to EBB's earlier years in Italy), would have benefited from more consideration of criticism on the poet's complex relationship with Italy, from Sandra Gilbert to Alison Chapman and Jane Stabler, and also from Scott Lewis' wonderfully annotated edition of The Let ters of Elizabeth Barrett Browning to Her Sister Arabella (2002): letters pervaded by discussions of Italian matters (see the 2003 "Year's Work"). For instance, the letters to Arabella document EBB's relationships with some leading Ital</page><page sequence="22">368/ VICTORIAN POETRY ian political figures and writers, pointing to the inaccuracy of Camus's claim that EBB "certainly never made friends with Italians" (p. 230). The other essay on EBB in The Victorian and Italy is Lindsey Cordery's "Elizabeth Barrett Browning's Casa Guidi Windows" (pp. 83-98). Cordery, a scholar from Uruguay, brings a "South American, early twenty-first-century, post-colonial, woman's perspective" (p. 87) to her reading of Casa Guidi Win dows. She finds EBB "well-informed" on matters of Italian politics (p. 85), but emphasizes more her critique of "England's betrayal of the Italian cause" (p. 89). Corderey adds to scholarship on Casa Guidi Windows by presenting an innovative postcolonial reading of the poem's metaphors of "interstices" (11.776) through the theoretical framework of Homi Bhabha's "in-between spaces" (p. 91). She also provides the most detailed and informed analysis to date of the poem's representation of the death of Anita Garibaldi. As Cord erey points out, EBB, "like so many others, knew nothing of Anita Riberior's life," but her "poetic tribute" to the "mother and fighter . . . brief as it is, is, nevertheless suggestive" (p. 95). Corderey's observation that, at the time of its publication, the poem was "labelled difficult and generally not worthy of critical attention" (p. 91) reflects a common misconception about the poem's reception. In fact, the reviews were mixed, dividing along political and national lines (see the headnote in WEBB, vol. 2 and review excerpts in Elizabeth Barrett Browning: Selected Poems [Broadview Press, 2009]). EBB's response to and representations of Italy are also issues addressed in several other articles this year, two of them—by Graham Smith and Páraic Finnerty—concerned with the theme of literary tourism explored in a new book by Alexis Easley (see below). Smith's "Michelangelo's Duke of Urbino in Literature, Travel-Writing and Photography of the Nineteenth Century" (in Strange Sisters: Literature and Aesthetics, edited Francesca Orestano and Francesca Frigerio [Lang, 2009], pp. 155-175) analyzes verbal and visual representations of Michelangelo's haunting statues of the Times of Day and Florentine Dukes in the New Sacristy of the Chapel of the Medici. Smith points out that EBB's evocation of these statues evokes Samuel Roger's earlier description of them in his immensely popular Italy, A Poem (1822), and that in 1851, "the year in which Casa Guidi Windows was published, life-sized plaster casts of Mi chelangelo's Dukes and Times of Day were exhibited in the Crystal Palace" (pp. 159-160). Finnerty's "Rival Italies: Emily Dickinson, John Ruskin and Henry James" (Prose Studies 32, no. 2 [2009]: 113-125) includes an analysis of the impact of EBB's poetry—together with periodical articles on Italy as a '"Woman Country'" (p. 118)—on Dickinson's imaginary constructions of the country she characterized (in Poem 541) as a feminized and eroticized '"Blue Peninsula'": echoing Aurora's description of the "blue hills" of "my Italy" (1.232), as Finnerty suggests (p. 120). Like EBB, Dickinson associated Italy with "passionate same-sex relationships" between women like the actress</page><page sequence="23">MARJORIE STONE/369 Charlotte Cushman and the sculptor Harriet Hosmer (p. 119). Finnerty further notes the Italian volcanic metaphors for passion and creativity in Dickinson's poetry, though not the thread of similar imagery in Aurora Leigh. British and American women's responses to Italy also figure in one of two articles this year on EBB's engagement with the classical tradition. Isobel Hurst's "Classical Daughters: Elizabeth Barrett Browning and Margaret Fuller" (Women's Studies 40, no. 4 [2011]: 448-468) comprehensively analyzes parallels and differences between EBB and Fuller, as well as their social interactions in Italy. Hurst considers their classical education by male mentors (comparable to Aurora's, wrapped in her father's "doublet"); their contrasting tastes in clas sical authors—EBB's passion for Greek and dislike of Latin versus Fuller's far greater appreciation of the Romans (pp. 452, 457); the parallel freedom from "restrictive" gendered codes both women experienced in Italy (p. 462); and their similar fascination with George Sand (Fuller's achievement of a meeting with the French author in Paris was one of the catalysts for EBB's seeking to meet her [p. 459], the event repeatedly described in Volume 18 of The Brown ings' Correspondence [see above]). Hurst also considers their opinions of each other's writings; and their similarly intense engagement with the liberation of Italy, despite differences in the degree of their republicanism and level of involvement in differing cities (EBB writing on events in Tuscany, Fuller writ ing journalist's despatches from the Roman front and nursing the wounded). Both interpreted events in contemporary Italy through Roman history, as in their differing invocations of Brutus and the assassination of Julius Caesar in representing the assassination of Count Pellegrino Rossi, the Pope's minister, on the steps of the Roman Senate in 1848. Hurst's article forms a suggestive foundation for future assessments of the relatively unexplored Fuller-EBB relationship, "central to a transatlantic conversation on the intellectual abili ties of women and their relationship to literature and history" (p. 448). For instance, the "'avant-garde' enthusiasm for the writings of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe" that Hurst notes in Fuller (p. 458) is also seen in a series of newly published translations from Goethe by EBB dating from the 1830s (see WEBB, vol. 5)—formerly miscatalogued as original poems. EBB also shared the interest in Minerva that Hurst discusses in relation to Fuller (p. 461), as Linda Lewis' discussion of Minerva as a female "Wisdom figure" in Aurora Leigh suggests (in Lewis, Elizabeth Barrett Browning's Spiritual Progress [1998]). Like Hurst, Yopie Prins in "The Sexual Politics of Translating Pro metheus Bound" (Cultural Critique 75 [Winter, 2010]): 164-180), casts new light on EBB's engagement with classical literature by comparing it to other women's: in this case, the later classical scholars Janet Case and Edith Ham ilton. All three translated Aeschylus's Prometheus Bound: a play "with a long history of political readings" that women were especially drawn to translating as "a rite of passage" because its difficulty made it a "textual performance" in the</page><page sequence="24">370 / VICTORIAN POETRY "claim to classical literacy" (pp. 164-165). Prins argues, however, that women were also "bound to translate the play as a performance of subjection as well as mastery, making it a complex re-enactment of nineteenth-century gender politics" (pp. 165-166). EBB was "among the first English poets to attempt a complete verse translation of Prometheus Bound," although her initial 1833 translation was one she would later famously repudiate as "a Prometheus twice bound" (pp. 166, 168-169), publishing a more mature translation in Poems (1850). Prins's analysis of EBB's identification with the female figure of Io in Aeschylus' play is especially illuminating: Io's "cries of woe"—"Ah me! ah me! ah me!" in response to the torment of Zeus differ from those of Prometheus in the Greek, but "E.B.B, makes them the same in English," while in Aurora Leigh, Aurora "identifies with the Τ in Io" (pp. 168-169). Prins' discussion of Case and Hamilton indicate additional reasons why Aeschylus may have held a special appeal for EBB: for instance, Case remarked that "Aeschylus gives his women brains as well as heart"' (p. 172). One wonders if Augusta Webster—even more than EBB, largely self-taught in Greek as Patricia Rigg has shown in Julia Augustus Webster (2009)—was drawn to Aeschylus' most famous play for similar reasons in publishing her 1866 translation? Webster may have been influenced by EBB's 1850 translation—much admired in the reviews (see WEBB, vol. 1). Apart from Rigg's study (see the 2010 "Year's Work"), however, EBB's influence on Augusta Webster remains relatively unexplored, as does Webster's translation of Prometheus Bound. In contrast, Emily Dickinson's response to EBB has been intensively investigated, and this year is no exception, given Finnerty's article on the poets' similar response to Italy (above) and Mary Loeffelholz's provocative and engaging "Master Shakespeare, Mrs. Browning, Miss Dickinson, and the Servants" (The Emily Dickinson Journal 20, no. 1 [2011]: 34-55). Whereas earlier studies such as Ann Swyderski's emphasize that Dickinson's most creative period followed her reading of the "Titanic Opera" of Aurora Leigh, Loeffelholz begins with Aife Murray's Maid as Muse, which connects Dickin son's fluctuating productivity to the "arrival and departure of key servants" (p. 35). Loeffelholz then turns her attention to the "conjunction of love and service" in Aurora Leigh and EBB's earlier A Drama of Exile, arguing that EBB's response to both servants and "the unequally gendered service . . . intrinsic to heterosexual marriage" differs substantially from Dickinson's (p. 44). Loeffelholz's insightful analysis of the "service" metaphor in Aurora Leigh (including art, motherhood, and muse figures) is too multi-facted and nuanced to be summarized here. She uses it to support the argument that that EBB's artistic productivity was dependent, like Dickinson's on the "presence of a reliable maid," Lily Wilson, who, despite the tribute paid to Marian's service as a mother in Aurora Leigh, had to set aside her own child to return to the Brownings' service in 1856, just as her employer's poem was completed (pp.</page><page sequence="25">MAR/ORÍ E STONE/ 371 48-49). Ultimately, Loeffelholz finds Dickinson more democratic in her "ex panding sympathies" for servants, male as well as female (p. 50): she contrasts the "proudly American idealizations of free labor" in Dickinson and Harriet Beecher Stowe's work with the representation of the "bottom of the social scale" in both A Drama of Exile and Aurora Leigh as "chaos" (pp. 51-52). This reading, however, depends upon interpreting the allegorical "Earth-Spirits" of "inorganic and organic nature" in A Drama of Exile as "Barrett Browning's representation of laboring origins" (p. 51), in a conflation of inorganic nature with humanity. In the case of Aurora Leigh, Loeffelholz tends to overlook the modulations in Aurora's perception of the working classes as she matures (a point addressed by Avery in his analysis—see above). Loeffelholz's insightful article raises fascinating questions even though underlying narratives of na tion may be at work in the use of EBB's English class politics as a foil to set off Dickinson's American democratic values. EBB's most intimate and profound poetic relationship, with her poet husband—the subject of many studies and debates—is thoughtfully and judi ciously treated this year in Chapter 3, "Elizabeth Barrett Browning: Model and Countermodel" of Britta Martens's Browning, Victorian Poetics and the Romantic Legacy: Challenging the Personal Voice (Ashgate, 2011). Martens argues that the "earliest and most important heir of Romanticism" with whom Browning "en gaged in an extended dialogue was his wife," more especially because "EBB had herself a complex relationship with the Romantic tradition" (p. 91). Martens tends to side with critics such as Dorothy Mermin, Mary Saunders Pollock, and Corinne Davies who "stress the two Brownings' productive interchanges" (p. 92). At the same time, she argues that Browning persistently "conceptualized" EBB as "a self-expressive poet in the Romantic vein" like Shelley (p. 93), even though he praised dramatic monologues by her such as "Bertha in the Lane," as well as her critique of Shelley as "in his white ideal, / All statue-blind" in "A Vision of Poets." As a result, Browning struggled intensely in his own search for a poetic voice between the self-expressive mode he valorized in EBB and "his own impersonal" and dramatic style (p. 93). Martens perceptively explores this conflict, finding like earlier critics "resemblances to EBB's voice" in poems such as his "The Guardian Angel," which she attributes in part to the impact of the Sonnets from the Portuguese (p. 99). She then traces Browning's oscillating attraction to his wife's voice and attempts to distance himself from it in a series of later works. He achieved some "resolution" to this conflict in "One Word More" in Men and Women, but the oscillation returned after EBB's death. The discovery of Edward Fitzgerald's misogynist attack on EBB in his published personal letters ("Mrs. Browning's Death is rather a relief to me, I must say: no more Aurora Leighs, thank God! . . . She and her sex had better mind the Kitchen and their Children") resulted in Browning's heated reply, "To Edward Fitzgerald," in which "the speaker is all the more outraged</page><page sequence="26">372 / VICTORIAN POETRY . . . because he sees his own and EBB's identity as fused" (p. 130). One of two articles relating to EBB published in journals of psychology this year speaks in intriguing ways to the question of how the Brownings's poetic voices may have been influenced by their marital and poetic intimacy: a point Victorian reviewers remarked upon. In "Language Style Matching in Writing: Synchrony in Essays, Correspondence, and Poetry" (Journal of Personal ity and Social Psychology 99, no. 3 [2010]: 549-571), Molly E. Ireland and James W. Pennebaker present findings from studies on unconscious language style matching (LSM) in conversation and dyadic relationships (p. 550). A widely observed pattern in human interaction, LSM results in the synchronization of functional versus content words and patterns in speaking styles, and is influenced by an array of factors from "sex and sexual orientation" to "social status" (p. 551). One of the studies conducted by Ireland and Pennebaker analyzed LSM in "three pairs of famous writers": the Brownings, Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, and Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes. The biographical data on EBB that Ireland and Pennebaker fed into their analysis of LSM in the Brownings's relationship is dated and skewed—she is identified as an "invalid opiate addict for most of her life," and described as mainly writing "personal poems about her own emotions" (p. 562). Their selection and dating of the correspondence and poetry they investigate might also be seen as problem atic. However, they do apply their sophisticated, computerized methods for investigating LSM to a large body of materials across four phases they identify in the Brownings' relationship (prior to meeting, the courtship, the first nine years of their marriage, and the remaining five), with some interesting results. Ireland and Pennebaker conclude that the two poets' LSM was "highest," as expected, "when the couple were happiest," rising to a peak between the courtship and 1855 (pp. 563-564). LSM in Plath's and Hughes' poetry, in contrast, "was much lower than the Brownings' average degree of matching" (p. 564). In addition, "Elizabeth appeared to gradually entrain to Robert's writing," and "Robert matched more with himself' than Elizabeth did with "herself," following the general pattern of women matching more to others than men (p. 563). One might infer from this article, however, that Elizabeth's "entrainment" is not necessarily a weakness or manifestation of dependency, since in other studies Ireland and Pennebaker cite, a higher degree of LSM is associated with "greater social sensitivity," "empathie tendencies," higher education, and better academic performance (p. 566). The other article relating to EBB in a psychology journal this year is '"My Story for My Better Self': Love, Loss, and Working Through in the Diary of Elizabeth Barrett Browning" (Journal of the American Psychoanalytical Associa tion, 58, no. 3 [2010): 459-487) by Columbia University clinical psychologist, Wendy Wiener Katz. As Katz notes, EBB's 1831-32 diary has been mined for information by biographers and critics, who treat it as "a repository of secret</page><page sequence="27">MARJORIE STONE/373 —and therefore, it is implied, more true—thoughts and feelings," taking it at "face value" and overlooking the "layered, defensive, and conflictual nature" of the mental life it reflects (pp. 462-463). Katz argues instead that "the diary was analogous to a brief, self-prescribed, and self-administered psychotherapeutic treatment," enabling EBB "to mediate ... a series of intertwining losses—of parents and parent figures, of love, of childhood home and perhaps even of childhood itself—into a work of memorial and mourning" (pp. 461-462). Katz gives particularly thoughtful attention to the reasons why the diary was "born" in June 1831 and died in April 1832 (p. 467), to its role as EBB's "imagined companion" (p. 467), to its physical and material features (p. 468), and to its function in helping EBB to work through a variety of feelings and conflicts. Even though EBB began the diary three years after her mother's abrupt death, Katz finds the grief associated with this "mother-want" to be central to it, along with EBB's conflicts over her attraction to the blind classical scholar Hugh Stuart Boyd—"her first major love object outside her family" (p. 475), her fears over the possible loss of her idyllic childhood home at Hope End, and management of her anger at Boyd and others (p. 480). Citing Prins (see above), Katz explores the contexts, impulses, and identifications shaping EBB's first translation of Prometheus Bound, suggesting that work on it coincided with a "significant depressive episode" (pp. 484-485). She concludes that the diary, both as "an object and a process," served "adaptive and defensive functions" for EBB, "playing an important role in the history of her development as a writer and as a lover" (p. 486). EBB s relationship with her famous spaniel Flush is the subject of several articles this year, two exploring the history of animal-human relations. Jennifer McDonell's "Ladies' Pets and the Politics of Affect: Elizabeth Barrett Browning and Flush" (Australian Literary Studies 25, no. 2 [2010]: 17-34), is the most sophisticated, extended, and original treatment of this subject to date, bringing new scholarly paradigms on pets and interspecies connections to bear upon a topic too often considered as merely diverting or peripheral. Comprehensively analyzing the multitude of letters by EBB detailing "Flush's entire life," McDonnell reads them, notwithstanding their "light-heartedness and wit," as "constituting a meta-narrative on . . . interspecies sameness and difference, canine consciousness, the ethics of pet making and pet keeping and the ways in which systems of values along gender, class, species, and racial lines are interlinked" (p. 18). Her analysis draws throughout on the work of historians such as Harriet Ritvo, as well as theory by Derrida, Donna Har away, Baudrillard, and Deleuze and Guattari. Noting that dogs are "boundary crossers," that destabilize the "binary structures" of the human/animal divide (p. 19), McDonell presents illuminating close readings of EBB's accounts of "dog-love" and her "figurative uses of dogs" (reflecting her alertness to the ideological linking of women and dogs—"Why what is Flush but a lapdog</page><page sequence="28">374 / VICTORIAN POETRY and what am I but a woman?," she asked). McDonell and her reflections on "canine consciousness and the canine gaze"—anticipating Darwin's The Expression of Emotions in Man and Animals (pp. 21, 23-25), McDonnell suggests, thus chiming with the "literary Darwinism" Machann relates to Aurora Leigh (see above). McDonnell chooses to deploy the complex concept of "affect," including "within its definition feeling or emotion as manifested by facial expression or bodily language," because "sentimentality has always bedev illed the discussion of human/animal relations and pet-keeping" (p. 24). She analyzes EBB's poems "To Flush, My Dog" and "Flush or Faunus," as well as the "counter-discourse of contingency, affect and care" in EBB's response to Flush's three abductions by dog-stealers, leading the poet to resist arguments based on "abstract principle" vigorously advanced by Browning, her father, and her brothers against paying the ransom (p. 26). McDonnell concludes by cogently investigating the language connecting "animalised animals," like EBB's brothers' big dogs, Cataline and Resolute, to "the slaves on the Barrett plantations and the men who hunt them" (p. 32). As the headnote by Beverly Taylor to "My Doves" in WEBB suggests (2:33-34), the methodologies and concepts McDonnell employs might also be fruitfully applied to EBB's close observations of her pet Barbary doves before Flush entered her life. In an article that intersects with several of the themes McDonnell explores, EBB's sonnet "Flush or Faunus" provides the structuring template for Laura Brown's "The Lady, the Lapdog, and Literary Alterity" (The Eigh teenth Century 52, no. 1 [2011]: 31-45), an analysis of "the female encounter with the canine pet" (p. 32) in a range of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century texts. This encounter includes "several common components: the dynamic or formal chiasmus of distance and intimacy; the bed-side scene; the hairy, alien being; the substitution for parent, husband, or sexual partner; the point of contact—the embrace, the tear, the gaze; and the ardour, immoderate love, or heights of love that often mark these scenes" (p. 41). Like McDonnell, Brown also develops the ways in which representations of this encounter could sometimes relate to a racist discourse of "interspecies miscegenation" (p. 43). Hilary Newman's "Flush as an Example of Virginia Woolf s Art of Biography" (Virginia Woolf Bulletin 27 [January 2008]: 30-37) considers some of the strategic revisions Woolf made in EBB's biography, such as collapsing Flush's three abductions by dog-knappers into one dramatic incident. Maggie Humm's "The 1930s, Photography, and Virginia Woolf s Flush (Photography and Culture 3, no. 1 [2010]: 7-18) is also noteworthy here because, in exploring the photographic and cinematic perspectives in both Flush and Woolf s essay on Aurora Leigh, Humm addresses the modernist writer's interest in EBB's attention to "the visual" in her novel-in-verse (p. 11). Thanks in part to Woolf s canine romance, Flush exerts a perennial</page><page sequence="29">MARJOR/E STONE/ 375 appeal as an appendage to the image of EBB that haunts the cultural imaginary. Yet, as Alexis Easley points out in her multi-faceted study, Literary Celebrity, Gender, and Victorian Authorship, 1850-1914 (Univ. of Deleware Press, 2011), despite the Victorian poet's celebrity, she is curiously absent from the peri odicals and guidebooks that began to map the literary "homes and haunts" of famous writers in London in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries (p. 49). This is a gendered absence, Easley argues, since a similar "ghostly invisibility" arising from the "domestic ideology" that "mandated women's absence in the public sphere" effaces the London sites in which George Eliot and Christina Rossetti worked. "Even today, although there are many blue plaques mark ing literary women's homes in London, there is no literary shrine devoted to a woman writer equivalent to Keats's House, Carlyle's House, or Dickens's House" (pp. 49-50). Easley observes that when guidebooks "mentioned EBB's London homes, they interpreted them as isolated locations having little to do with the surrounding urban environment," and the poet herself was reduced to a disembodied, spectral presence (p. 61). Nor did her rural childhood homes feature in the guidebooks: in fact, there was disagreement agree even on the site of her birth. "The encylopaedias waver between London and Hereford shire," and although Anne Thackerary Ritchie in her DNB entry on the poet correctly listed her birthplace as Coxhoe Hall, Durham, John H. Ingram in his 1888 biography "argued that she was born in London" (p. 61). As Easley acknowledges (p. 60), in the literary tourism industry of the late Victorian period, as today, EBB was primarily associated with "the literary landscapes of Italy, particularly Casa Guidi" or the Protestant Cemetery in Florence where she is buried. This connection is borne out by the story of the EBB devotee Florence Barclay, narrated in Benjamin Kohlmann's " 'Stand Still, True Poet That You Are!: Remembering the Brownings, Imagining Memo rabilia," (Zeitschrift Für Anglistik und Amerikanistik 57, no. 2 [2009]: 125-137). A successful author of "romance-cum-religious novels," Barclay managed to acquire several EBB "relics" at the 1913 auction of the Brownings' effects, including the poet's favorite chair. During a long stay in Florence, Casa Guidi and EBB's monument in the cemetery were spots "pre-eminently dear to her" (p. 132-134). Kohlmann's analysis of memorabilia, literary celebrity, and literary sites takes up some of the same issues as Easley's book, includ ing '"the power of setting to communicate a person's essence,'" in Deborah Cohen's words (cited, Kohlmann, p. 128). EBB's continuing presence in the Italian settings that evoke her "essence" is suggested by a last publication I note this year, in German: Elsemarie Maletzke's Eine Liebe in Florenz: [A Life in Florence] Elizabeth Barrett und Robert Browning (Frankfurt: Insel Verlag Gmbh, 2011), a romanticized account of the Brownings' love story against the backdrop of Florence. In the twenty-first century, of course, "settings" are increasingly virtual.</page><page sequence="30">376 / VICTORIAN POETRY Responding to the shift to digital scholarship, two new scholarly websites on EBB have been established, in part to function as a digital surround to the Pickering and Chatto WEBB. One, created by Sandra Donaldson, General Editor of the WEBB, and associates at the University of North Dakota, fea tures some of EBB's most heavily revised poems in differing versions accessed through a versioning machine &lt;www.und.edu/instruct/sdonaldson&gt;. An initial version of another, complementary site at Dalhousie University &lt; www. ebbarchive.org&gt; features various resources , including annotated teaching texts, reviews, and critical materials designed to supplement the Broadview edition of EBB's selected poems I co-edited with Beverly Taylor, as well as materials constituting a digital annex for the WEBB. I would like to thank Cynthia Burgess of the Armstrong Browning Library for assistance in identifying materials for this review and Federica Belluccini for assistance with the German publication noted. Robert Browning SUZANNE BAILEY This year's entry rounds out the year 2010 which, as Britta Martens noted last fall, began as a productive period in Browning scholarship, includ ing the publication of the Selected Poems (Longman, 2010) and volume 17 of The Brownings' Correspondence, edited by Philip Kelley, Scott Lewis, and Edward Hagan (Wedgestone Press, 2010). Like the two other major ongoing editorial projects on Browning, the Oxford edition of The Poetical Works of Robert Brown ing and The Complete Works of Robert Browning from Ohio Univ. Press, Kelley's work combines meticulous textual scholarship with extensive annotations and research materials. It is also a labor of love and a gift to scholars interested in the complex texture of Browning's life, in the genesis of the poems, in Brown ing as a writer of prose (a lifetime of letter writing constitutes a substantial body of work)—and in the intricate literary and cultural relations he was part of in British and international contexts. Researchers who have had to travel to archives on numerous continents to read unpublished correspondence will appreciate Kelley and his colleagues' careful assembling of this important Browning archive. As humanities research takes a digital turn, one wonders what additional possibilities new media may offer in terms of editorial proj ects on Browning and in supporting and promoting collaborations among Browning scholars involved in this foundational but often unrecognized work. The world of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) guidelines and computer mark-up languages may in fact make the field of textual editing one of the most exciting "new" areas of study. One wonders, too, what guises a future "digital Browning" may assume.</page><page sequence="31">SUZANNE BAILEY/377 Browning figures in a number of book chapters and entries in new reference texts in 2010. In The Cambridge History of English Poetry (Cambridge Univ. Press, 2010), Richard Cronin weaves Browning into his survey of the world of Victorian poetry, taking Browning's Sordello, character and poem, as as emblematic of the need on the part of Victorian poets "to find a style of their own" (p. 576). He reviews "Fra Lippo Lippi" as emblematic not just of the dramatic monologue, but also of the marketplace for publishing poetry in the Victorian era, as well as the question of relationships between artistic freedom and economics. Herbert Tucker contributes a chapter "Elizabeth Barrett and Robert Browning" to this volume (pp. 617-635), in which he considers the creative and intellectual synergy between the two poets in the context of what he terms the cultural formation of evangelical dissent. Mus ing that class-based interests inform what Victorians found uncouth about Browning's language—including the poems' evocation of "bodily sensation [with] strenuous thought"—Tucker traces Browning's poetic career as one half of this duo of "poised, self-critically self-confident children of poetic Romanti cism and evangelical dissent" (p. 623). In his overview of Browning's work, Tucker suggests that Browning's volumes of poems, like his career, have their own distinctive rhythms. In Men and Women, for instance, Browning "tempers metres to temperaments" with "the prosodie equivalent of biorhythmic voice prints" (p. 627). Browning's memory of Elizabeth Barrett after her death also forms part of that creative rhythm, as Barrett appears as "ghostly collaborator" in the imagery of the later works (p. 633). Rhythm and pattern are at issue in several other book chapters on Browning. Conflict and Difference in Nineteenth-Century Literature (ed. Dinah Birch and Mark Llewellyn [Palgrave, 2010] ) is an essay collection focusing on "patterns of engagement with concepts of 'difference' and 'conflict'" (p. 1) and includes the essay "'Ever a Fighter': Browning's Struggle with Conflict" (pp. 33-51), also by Herbert Tucker. Tucker takes Hegel's dialectic as a start ing point for his consideration of conflict and its resolution in Browning. Browning's pugnaciousness, together with the "skitter, careen, and lurch of his muscle-bound metric," Tucker contends, demands an equally energized response from his readers, a "state of artificially induced vigilance" (p. 37). Once Browning had his readers "forward deployed at the edge of the chair," Tucker asks to what end, speculating that it in is the service of a mode of arousal appropriate to resisting "the circumstances of modernity," which include a complacent acceptance of the teleological, or what Tucker terms "a progressivist literary-political history" (p. 38). Tucker surveys Dramatic Lyrics (1842), as well as major monologues from Dramatic Romances and Lyrics (1845). He suggests that Browning's "refinement of the dramatic monologue" (teleological metaphors are hard to avoid) gives increasing emphasis to internal conflict as being valuable in itself. Phases in Browning's work with the dramatic</page><page sequence="32">378/ VICTORIAN POETRY monologue expose "the indwelling demerit of the tradition's very success, namely the cultural automation of its premises" (p. 45). To extrapolate from Tucker's intriguing argument, one might see in this essay a glimmer of a shift in critical conceptualizations of Browning's work, including the poet's often cited "causistry," toward a poetics of resistance and arousal. Tucker concludes with a reference to our own contemporary politics and present-day responses to conflict, noting that the "truth about reconciliation is that it has to keep happening" and that "the forensicism of contentious debate was Browning's way of sustaining the spirit of Reform" (p. 47). In Narrative Means, Lyric Ends: Temporality in the Nineteenth-Century British Long Poem (Ohio State Univ. Press, 2009), Monique Morgan turns to formal patterns in the nineteenth-century long poem and considers the temporali ties of lyric and narrative in four canonical works. Arguing that Don Juan is primarily narrative and The Prelude primarily lyrical, she sees Browning's The Ring and the Book as "fusing" both modes. In her chapter "Temporal Hybrid ity in the Dramatic Monologue and The Ring and the Book," Morgan situates her work within critical discussions of the dramatic monologue, focusing on the narratives of Arcangeli, Caponsacchi, and Pompilia. The shock of new information creates distance between speaker and reader, thereby drawing attention to the nature of discourse as something which unfolds in time (p. 172). It would be interesting to see Morgan extend her fine readings of tem poral longing and orientations toward time in the monologues by considering additional work on The Ring and the Book: for instance, Mary Ellis Gibson's History and the Prism of Art: Browning's Poetic Experiments (1987), which works with the category of "simultaneity" in Browning's longer poems, and reviews "the lyric impulse" in The Ring and the Book in the chapter "The Ambiguous Present and the Language of Poetry." It is good to see new attention directed to The Ring and the Book as a canonical Victorian text in Morgan and in Clinton Machann's Masculinity in Four Victorian Epics: A Darwinist Reading (Ashgate, 2010). Machann treats the Victorian long poem, examining representations of masculinity in Idylls of the King, Aurora Leigh, Amours de Voyage and The Ring and the Book. He argues for "a serious consideration of literary Darwinism" in work on masculinity in Victorian culture and presents a lucid overview of some of this theory in his introduction. Machann contends that "the ancient problem of male vio lence" is "related to real-world phenomena far beyond the industrialization of nineteenth-century Britain and the growth of capitalism" (p. 18) and draws on work in evolutionary psychology to support this claim. It is an interesting argument, raising the possibility of Browning's analysis of violence as saying something about power in our own time. In practice, it can be a challenging kind of critical operation to perform without slipping into essentialist claims about the human. In his chapter on Browning, "Browning's Chivalrous</page><page sequence="33">SUZANNE BAILEY/379 Christianity," Machann reviews Browning's biography and critical work on gender in The Ring and the Book, and surveys the behaviors and motivations of male figures in the poem. Machann argues, for instance, that "Browning's poetic voice ... affirms an idealized feminine as a key to fundamental human values" and "judges other masculine voices ... in terms of male-male competi tion" (p. 136). Highlighting these specific claims about the poem earlier in the chapter would help crystallize some of the points Machann wishes to make. Machann's approach does suggest new ways of thinking about patterns of conflict and power in Browning, in this well-written study. Among new articles for 2010, Tyler Efird's "'Anamorphosizing': Male Sexual Fantasy in Browning's Monologue" (Mosaic 43 [2010]: 151-166) presents a sophisticated reading of "My Last Duchess" in Lacanian terms, engaging with specific critical positions (Sussman's "ethics of control" and Knoepflmacher on irony), offering readers an overview of Lacan on "anamorphic" images, and arriving at some original critical formulations through these proceedings. Efird defines anamorphosis as "a view from which an object appears to be something entirely different than when seen from another visual perspective" and contends that Browning works subtly with "an anamorphic view of male fantasy" in "Porphyria's Lover" and "My Last Duchess." According to Efird, "Browning makes the case for the 'pathology' of both male art and romantic desire as . . . essentially 'normal' in that these tendencies belong to nearly all men under Victorian patriarchal social formations" (p. 154). The second half of the essay is densely theoretical, but the concept of "the anamorphic view" offers the potential for a distinctive conceptualizing of perception and perspective in Browning. Britta Martens makes a significant contribution to the understanding of Browning's negotiations of his Romantic literary heritage in "Look Back with Confidence: Browning's Hidden Review of his Early Romanticism" (Victorians Institute Journal 38 [2010]: 149-170). Martens begins with "two critical commonplaces" regarding Browning's relationship to Romanticism: the turn from Romantic self-expression to an impersonal poetics, and the no tion that the mature Browning "fashioned his engagement with Romanticism primarily through a preoccupation with Shelley" (p. 149). Martens argues that "Time's Revenges" (1845) functions as a vehicle for "a review of Browning's early Romantic egotism" and that "James Lee's Wife" (1864) also attests "to a private concern with . . . poetic identity" (p. 150). In the former, she traces Browning's incorporation of various Romantic tropes (the "unrecognized genius," the "bohemian poet in his garret"), focusing on the shift at the end of the first stanza which marks a "transition from a credible speaker to a parody" (p. 157). The movement away "from hidden autobiography in the Romantic vein" (p. 158), she contends, parallels Browning's own "reshaping of artistic identity" in the 1830s.</page><page sequence="34">38O / VICTORIAN POETRY Martens also outlines the fascinating textual history of "James Lee's Wife," which incorporates material from Browning's earlier writing. She notes that section VIII "Beside the Drawing-Board" includes the poem "Study of a Hand, by Lionardo," submitted to The Keepsake in 1857 but never published; Section VI contains thirty lines published anonymously in May 1836 in the Monthly Repository as a work by "Z." Martens notes the implications of this formal refashioning which allows Browning to "assert the superiority of his mature over his early poetics" (p. 167). She concludes by identifying two alter nate views of Browning's poetic career which she sees as existing in tension. One is a "conversion narrative," "its starting point the familiar, simplified Romantic concept of poetry as confessional and [pivoting] on a conversion to . . . impersonal poetry" (p. 167). The second involves a self which "revises its poetics," and as this narrative "carries the potential for public embarrassment," self-reference in the poems must be disguised. It is a fascinating argument, which leads Martens to original readings of the poems. Jonathan Loesberg's "Browning Believing: "A Death in the Desert" and the Status of Belief' (Victorian Literature and Culture 38 [2010]: 209-238) is a substantial and welcome addition to investigations of the relationship of Browning's work to biblical hermeneutics or the Higher Criticism. Loesberg suggests that in the wake of the German Higher Criticism, Browning tries both "to propose how his contemporaries might believe," and, as a consequence, "how to look at the beliefs of others as expressions of one's condition and situation rather than as assertions whose accuracy it is in our interests to mea sure" (p. 209). Loesberg begins by distinguishing the epistemology of belief from the justification of religious belief, touching on the work of Victorian intellectuals from Herbert Spencer, John Henry Newman, and J. S. Mill to H. L. Mansell and G. H. Lewes. Loesberg asks how belief operates arid how it may be justified in the absence of of "evidence of the one's existence and the other's accuracy" and "in the presence of good reasons to doubt both" (p. 211). He also provides a useful analysis of distinctions between the positions of Strauss and Renan, Strauss being concerned to account for the existence of various versions of the life of Christ; Renan, with "recover[ing] an actual life of Jesus (p. 215). Loesberg argues that "Bishop Blougram's Apology" and "Mr. Sludge, 'The Medium'" demonstrate Browning's understanding of how the epistemol ogy of belief and the rationale for religious belief are linked; "A Death in the Desert," he contends, represents the "fullest" articulation of this understand ing. John "confronts directly" the conclusions of the Higher Critics, rather than making the case for why "one should accept Christianity" (p. 210). In doing so, Browning ultimately offers readers a kind of pragmatic exploration of how beliefs "allow us to live lives" (p. 210). In making his case, Loesberg takes readers through some of the labyrinthine arguments of Browning's Blougram and Sludge, before turning to the main focus of the essay, "A Death in the</page><page sequence="35">SUZANNE BAILEY/381 Desert." He does superb work in tracing some of the complexities in Brown ing's fictional John's responses to his critics, noting that the poem "continually asks us to see John, not precisely as offering us a recovered eyewitness account, but as an allegory of eyewitness" and that John "sees the mythic significance and not the material reality as primary in the original event" (p. 230). John in effect "show[s] us one way consciously held and chosen beliefs need be neither hypocritical nor epistemologically incoherent" (p. 233). In reflecting on the issue of "how to believe" in Browning, Loesberg contends that critics have become increasingly aware of the legacy of the higher criticism and yet "have refused to accept how completely this meant that his justification for belief wound up reproducing the Higher Critical position about the historical reality of Christianity, with the addition of an epistemologically daring and dangerous justification of willed belief in an object accepted as possibly fictional" (p. 209). The question of Browning and belief is rich terrain, and Loesberg's larger project will benefit by establishing further intersections with debates in Browning criticism on epistemology and theories of knowledge and representation. W. David Shaw, for instance, traverses some of this intellectual in Victorians and Mystery (1990) and The Lucid Veil (1987), with his enviable command of Victorian intellectual history. Warwick Slinn has much to say about linguistic indeterminacy in Browning (see also Bailey "Somatic Wisdom," 1998). Loesberg's work will most certainly bring new attention to this area in Browning studies. In other Browning notes, Linda M. Shires' Perspectives: Modes of Viewing and Knowing in Nineteenth-Century England (Ohio State Univ. Press, 2009), newly received, contains a brief section on "Pippa Passes" in the chapter "Points of View in 'Pippa Passes,' The Woman in White, and Silas Marner." Shires examines connections between the visual and verbal arts, examining the persistence of Renaissance linear perspective in nineteenth-century culture as a paradigm for a "stable, reassuring, single-point perspective" (p. 4). She argues that it is also "too often . . . taken as a method of mimetic resemblance and copy, rather than as a self-reflexive representation addressed to a spectator" (p. 8). Shires is interested in countering "rupture" narratives in histories of modernity and draws on Browning's experiments with perspective in "Pippa Passes" as an early example of formal experimentation in reworking perspective and point of view. Shires touches on The Ring and the Book but focuses on the former poem, arguing that "Pippa Passes" "redefines Alberti's window frame motif for perspective, based in Cartesian subjectivity, by providing a mobile Pippa, not an immobile gazer" (p. 95). Browning "ironized" Pippa as "elect, but unseeing and unknowing," also reshaping the "the notion of a journey" through this poem (p. 95). Shires contends that "despite the motif of the linear journey through space, the Cartesian coordinate system of space is altered here to a series of parallel universes (houses) that the reader experiences as juxtaposed</page><page sequence="36">382 / VICTORIAN POETRY in a montage construct" (p. 96). Linda K. Hughes' The Cambridge Introduction to Victorian Poetry (Cam bridge Univ. Press, 2010) includes material on Browning in the chapter "Vic torian Experimentalism" under the categories "Dramatic Monologue" and "Experiments in Language, Image, Symbol." Hughes notes that "Browning's bold expansion of the lexicon was a key contribution to modern poetic tradi tion"; his "experiments with compressed syntax, eliminating conventional bridges between thoughts, even parts of speech" were taken further by Hopkins and Emily Dickinson (pp. 32-33). Browning's lesser-known "Pan and Luna" ( 1880) is included in the chapter "Victorian Dialogues with Poetic Tradition" under "Classical Forms," as is The Ring and the Book as "complex psychological epic" (p. 63). The latter also figures briefly in the chapter "The Impress of Print: Poems, Periodicals, Novels" in terms of debates about the genre of this work in the Victorian periodicals press (p. 107). The most extensive discus sions of Browning's work in the collection comprise "Caliban upon Setebos" in the chapter "Poetry, Technology, Science" (pp. 131-133); Christmas-Eve and Easter-Day under "Poetry and Religion" (as poems which Hughes argues "are unified by . . . consistently approaching religion as a question, not a source of certain answers" [p. 161]); and finally, "Love Among the Ruins" and "The Statue and the Bust" in the chapter "Poetry and the Heart's Affection" (pp. 185-186). Two brief articles also touch on Browning. Shosuke Kinugawa's '"The Ring and the Gaze: Robert Browning's "Love among the Ruins'" (The Explicator 68 [2010]: 235-238) is a crisp close reading of the dance of gender and power in this poem, tracing the "dissolution of patriarchal civilization into feminine nature" (p. 235). Nature has the last word, as Kinugawa notes, "watch[ing] patiently" the masculine "rings" of ruin before folding the male actors "back into her arms, incorporating the temporal rings of men within her omnipotent ring" (p. 238). Kevin Gardner's "Was the Duke of Ferrara Impotent?" (ANQ: A Quarterly Journal of Short Articles, Notes, and Reviews 23 [2010]: 166-171) has some fun tracing the etymological and cultural resonances of cherries and other imagery in "My Last Duchess." H. Wendell Howard's "Browning, Blougram, and Belief' (Logos: Ajournai of Catholic Thought and Culture 13 [2010): 79-93) speaks to an ongoing interest in Browning in a religious context, as does the chapter "To Be Pompilia, Not the Fisc: Browning and the Irony of Humility" in Anthony Esolen's Ironies of Faith: The Laughter at the Heart of Christian Literature (ISI Books, [2007], pp. 1-9). Howard tackles G. K. Chesterton on Bishop Blougram and argues "one may reasonably conclude that then-current prejudices about Cardinal Wise man were transferred to the poetical prelate," including "the centuries-old fear of Catholic oppression" (p. 84). Howard surveys reaction in the periodicals press to Wiseman's appointment as cardinal and archbishop of Westminster</page><page sequence="37">ROSEMARIE MORGAN / 383 in 1850. He argues that Blougram's "Ί who you doubt to prove that faith ex ists'" is "intellectually . . . one with Browning's habit [of] seeing imperfection as an implication of perception (p. 89). Browning continues to attract interest in non-English speaking con texts. Anglistica Pisana 6 (2009), a journal published out of the University of Pisa, includes three articles on Browning: Elsa Linguanti, "Count Guido Franceschini, Etruscan, Aretine" (pp. 175-183); Joseph Phelan, '"The Forest Sanctuary': Robert Browning's 'By the Fire-Side' and Bagni di Lucca" (pp. 167-173); and in Italian, Mario Curelli's "I Browning a Pisa (per non parlar del cane)" (185-196), (roughly "The Brownings in Pisa [not to mention the dog] )." I have not yet been able to obtain a copy of this journal. A new Italian edition of the Barrett/Browning courtship correspondence has also recently crossed the Browning desk: D'amore e di poesia: Lettere scelte 1845-1846, trans lated by Ilaria Rizzato (Archinto, 2007). Donguk Kim of the University of Korea writes on "The Mechanics of the Victorian Dramatic Monologue and its Theoretical Implications for the Novel" (English Language and Literature 56 [2010]: 519-541), including interesting reflections on how, in contrast to the Romantic lyric, "'subjectivity' and 'objectivity' pass into each other" in the dramatic monologue, "by imperceptible degrees" (p. 523). My thanks to Cynthia Burgess of the Armstrong Browning Library at Baylor University for sharing her work in keeping track of new Browning publications. Thomas Hardy ROSEMARIE MORGAN At various intervals throughout the millennium years Thomas Hardy has made several appearances in The Times and not simply as the subject of the subject, as in reviews in the TLS of critical work exploring his poetry, philosophy, biography and novels. From the TLS's June 2006 publication in honor of his birthday, featuring his poem, "A Private Man on Public Men"— first collected posthumously in the year of his death (1928), in Winter Words in Various Moods and Metres—to the TLS annual Christmas Quiz where riddling allusions to Hardy's verse appear to challenge the most erudite of his readers (if the Quiz blog is indicative), The Times publication devotes almost as much attention to Hardy's work as it did nigh on 100 years ago. Indeed, "Song of the Soldiers" may invoke a certain proprietary interest: first printed in The Times (November 10, 1914), with the express statement that "Neither Mr. Hardy nor 'The Times' reserves copyright," the poem was widely reprinted in those early war days as Hardy had evidently hoped and intended (given the waived copyright). Two months later, under its new title "Men Who March Away"</page><page sequence="38">384 / VICTORIAN POETRY ("Song of the Soldiers" subordinated to subtitle), the poem was collected in Satires of Circumstance in what Purdy calls a "last-minute Post-Script to that volume"; later still, it was transferred to Moments of Vision and Miscellaneous Verses (1917) where, as in all subsequent editions, it is placed at the head of the group of "Poems of War and Patriotism" where, according to Purdy, it more properly belongs" (Pettit, p. 157). More recently "Song of the Soldiers" enjoyed an encore in The Times (interestingly the TLS still retains Hardy's original, unrevised title), as a pre Remembrance poem (November 5, 2007), accompanied by a short profile of the poets Robert Bridges, John Drinkwater, and Walter de la Mare. According to the "profile" most of these poets strike a note of national resolve—"in our heart of hearts believing"— a "note" which was all too soon to become bitterly discordant, after 1918, among the War Poets. According Hardy's "Song of the Soldiers" primacy among the pre-Remembrance war poems, The Times reminds readers that the poem's repeated phrase, "Men Who March Away" gave Ian Parsons the title for his anthology of poems of the First World War (1987). What of the faith and fire within us Men who march away Ere the barn-cocks say Night is growing gray, Leaving all that here can win us; [Originally, "To hazards whence no tears can win us;"] What of the faith and fire within us Men who march away? In "The Poet Thomas Hardy" (TLS, January 28, 2010) the contribu tor/editor self-named "unknowing" offers a generous array of well-informed views on Hardy's poems (I strongly suspect "unknowing" to be Tom Paulin) observing, among other things, that whereas "Hopkins had faith to give him a spiritual realm and the supernatural" Hardy was fascinated by the "material exchange of decomposition." Citing "Transformations" as exemplary in this context "unknowing" wants us to notice how he creates the sense of rising with the yew, and falling with the thought of the man buried under it. The emphasis of the rhyme, com ing as it does after the rushing anapest, is to settle the word "knew" much deeper in the voice than the word "yew." And the initial anapestic foot of the second line seems to slide down after the discovery in the first line that not trochees but iambs are afoot. Just try saying it and pitching "knew" higher than "yew." You can't do it with any dignity; the construction of the lines require we descend. On "Proud Songsters," "The Walk," "The Two Houses," and "The Shadow</page><page sequence="39">ROSEMARIE MORGAN / 385 on the Stone" "unknowing" offers yet more of these insightful gems: "trans formation is material, and you are left with a sense that while Hardy could not escape the positivism of the learned of his age, he was still not able to escape the sense of spirit in the world." Perhaps it is from the stance of the sage, inter preting Hardy's poetry at this level of creativity and intimacy within an acreage of pure innocence and deep field of understanding, that the reviewer must retreat, leaving behind, figuratively speaking the company of the omnipotent god of the Tree of Knowledge to adopt, instead, the prelapsarian Hardyan attitude of "unknowing." Deep knowledge is born of "unknowing" after all. Tim Armstrong, editor of Thomas Hardy: Selected Poems (2009), also touches on Hardy's fascination with the "material exchange of decomposi tion"—albeit in more conventional terms of the poet's disembodiment as the observing eye and "that self-protective invisibility which sustains Hardy's career after the public controversy of the last novels" (p. 4). In Armstrong's case, the choices from the "Poems of War and Patriotism" are, first, "The Pity of It" which celebrates the kinship of the Anglo-Saxon races, especially their shared language (an unconventional WWI poem, to say the least) and their shared oppressors: "Whosoever they be/At root and bottom of this, who flung this flame / Between kin folk tongued even as are we." Writing to Florence Henniker at this time Hardy defends his poem by stating that the German peoples had been inflamed "by oligarchs &amp; munition-makers whose interest is war" (Letters, 5:86). "The Pity of It" is followed, in Armstrong's selection of Hardy's war poems with "In Time of 'The Breaking of Nations'" (again, copyright not reserved by Hardy in the original printing of the poem in the Saturday Review, 1916). This poem is related to the Franco-Prussian war of the 1870s (one of the last wars fought, in Hardy's view, between men engaging in open hand-to hand combat). The titular note from Jeremiah 51.20 ("I will break in pieces the nations") serves as a reminder that the weapons of war, the battle-axes, are (or were then, prior to WWI) as the microcosmic "harrowing" ploughman in his field is to the macrocosmic "harrowing" of the modern military world with its weapons of mass destruction. Once there was a primitive god, a primitive vengeful god of biblical stories, who might break in pieces the nations, but now, says Hardy, in another of his poems: Christmas: 1924 'Peace upon earth!' was said. We sing it, And pay a million priests to bring it After two thousand years of mass We've got as far as poison-gas. WWI rendered Hardy bitterly distraught. But there is also the unspoken sense of a more personal depression in "In Time of 'The Breaking of Nations'";</page><page sequence="40">386/ VICTORIAN POETRY ennuie informs the nameless, faceless lovers in the poem who are not only spatially distanced, possessing no immediate presence, but also aurally dis tanced; they pass by in whispers only—not only in anonymity but in alienated silence. In biographical terms (Hardy had recently met his future wife, Emma), this poem signifies as a forlorn foreboding of the years to follow shortly after Hardy had first conceived it (in-time-of-the-breaking-of-marriage?), the sadly estranged years for husband and wife in the Hardy household. The slightly sinister motif, based on an actual incident, of a ghostly night rider in "A New Year's Eve in War Time," written in 1915-16 and first printed in The Sphere in January 1917, is followed, in Armstrong's selection, by the last and probably the most poignant of Hardy's "Poems of War and Patriotism," "I Looked Up from My Writing." A father drowns himself after hearing news of his son's death on the battlefield: "one with a sunken soul / Who has put his life-light out." One unique aspect of Armstrong's Thomas Hardy: Selected Poems, which offers readers over 180 annotated poems (a boon to students), is that this edition follows the trajectory of the poet's career, presenting the poems in the order in which they appeared in the Collected Poems of 1930. Aside per haps from the slim segments on free-will, determinism, illusion, necessity, and condensed theories of a John Morley-esque nature, Armstrong provides generous notes with each poem on metrics, sources, composition, significant variants, and other literary paraphernalia. Copious textual annotations also enhance Samuel Hynes' (ed.) The Complete Poetical Works of Thomas Hardy, vol. 5, The Dynasts: Part Third; The Famous Tragedy of the Queen of Cornwall; The Play of 'Saint George'; and Ό Jan, O Jan, O Jan' (1995). A full account of the rough draft of Part Third of The Dynasts, together with comprehensive explanatory notes to individual works, epistolary material, and relevant passages from Hardy's notebooks, plus information on the production and performance of these works, combine to erect a robust apparatus to this scholarly masterpiece begun in 1982 and completed well over a decade later. Samuel Hynes' unique edition of The Complete Poetical Works of Thomas Hardy contains all Hardy's dramatic writing in verse while reconciling the several differing editions—a matchless piece of Hardy scholarship. If Hardy resists creating epic tragedies out of war in "Poems of War and Patriotism"—his tragedies, in that sequence, are life-size—'The Dynasts, his life-long work on the Napoleonic Wars moves in the opposite direction into what he calls "a panoramic poem" of vast dimensions. In November 2009 the TLS reprinted Hardy's rejoinder, first published in February 1904, follow ing an article on The Dynasts by the Times theatre critic, A. B. Walkley. Here, Hardy writes in defense of his "unactable" play-like poem, arguing that "the methods of a book and the methods of a play . . . are fundamentally similar.</page><page sequence="41">ROSEMARIE MORGAN/387 It must be remembered that the printed story is not a representation, but, like the printed play, a means of producing a representation, which is done in the one case by sheer imaginativeness": Your critic is as absolute as the gravedigger in Hamlet. I understand his contention to be that to give a panoramic poem (which "The Dynasts" may perhaps be called) the form of a stage-drama—even a conventionalized form—or to give such a form to anything whatever that is intended for the study only, is false in principle. Whether the aim of "The Dynasts" was to dumbfound the worthy burgher (as your critic surmises in the French tongue) or not, his theory certainly does dumbfound, or, as he would say, épate, the present writer. According to it one must conclude that such productions as Shelley's "Prometheus Bound," Byron's "Cain," and many other unactable play-like poems are a waste of means, and, in his own words, "may be read just as faute de mieux, shoe-leather may be used as an article of diet." Jack Farrell, in his forthcoming review for Victorian Studies of The Ashgate Research Companion to Thomas Hardy, edited by Rosemarie Morgan (2010), points to Harold Orel's essay on "Hardy's Contribution to the Epic Tradi tion" (ARCTH, pp. 355-370), as making a valuable addition to studies on The Dynasts despite the simultaneous arrival on the scene of Herbert Tucker's "sumptuous" work on Hardy's epic drama: Orel's study "stands on its own as both a very helpful introduction to The Dynasts and an illuminating account of what Hardy is celebrating and what he is fiercely opposing in his epic poem." Among the 27 chapters in the Research Companion which treat with topics as various as Hardy's cosmology (Pamela Gossin), psychology (Suzanne Keen), Hardy and the law (William Davis), Wessex (Rosemarie Morgan with Scott Rode), philosophy (Mark Asquith), Hardy's beliefs ( Timothy Hands), scientific humanism (Andrew Radford), gender (Judith Mitchell), Hardy and the cinema (Paul Niemeyer), Hardy's short stories (Sophie Gilmartin), tragedy (Dale Kramer), masculinity (Phillip Mallett), Hardy's lyrics (DeSales Harrison), Hardy's illustrators (Ian Rogerson), Hardy's biographers (Phillip Mallett), Farrell notices Suzanne J. Flynn's study, "Hardy in (a Time of) Transition" (ARCTH, pp. 87-100), which surveys "the personal and cultural transitions that affected Hardy during the final years of his prose-writing career and his early years as a published poet." Identifying in this period a cluster of personal developments Flynn highlights those issues that not only bore on Hardy's sense of alienation but freed him to explore new literary territory. In "'Tune' and 'Thought': The Uses of Music in Hardy's Poetry" (ARCTH, pp. 269-284), John Hughes makes what Farrell describes as a "bold effort" to "explore the expressive conspiracy between 'tune' and 'thought' in Hardy's poetry," while Dennis Taylor, on the other hand, "makes an outstanding contribution to the</page><page sequence="42">388 / VICTORIAN POETRY volume in his inventory of Hardy's Shakespeare allusions and borrowings." Taylor's chapter, entitled, "From Stratford to Casterbridge: The Influence of Shakespeare" (ARCTH, pp. 123-156), records the extensive series of passages that Hardy annotated in the ten-volume edition of Shakespeare he purchased in 1863. Taylor provides a double columned display of the passages in Shakespeare's text and Hardy's annotations. These include Hardy's own thoughtful revisions of the editor's readings. Three "Sage Writers in Tribute to Their Muse," J Hillis Miller, Gillian Beer, and Tom Paulin, provide elegant homage to Hardy in this volume which opens, yet more auspiciously, with Charles P. C. Pettit's chapters on "Hardy's Bibliographies" (ARCTH, pp. 23-38) and "Hardy Archives" (ARCTH, pp. 57-70). These studies assemble a matchless compendium of bibliographical resources which, together with W. Eugene Davis, "The First 100 Years of Hardy Criticism: 1871-1971" (ARCTH, pp. 39-56) coupled with the most extensive end-bibliography available in Hardy scholarship ensures a resource unrivaled in the world of Hardy studies. Among other recent publications Jan Lloyd Jones' Thomas Hardy and the Comic Muse (2009) discusses the nature of comedy and touches on the ele ments of farce, humor, satire, and other forms of the comedic art in Hardy's oeuvre. The beautifully illustrated Hardy's Landscape Revisited: Thomas Hardy's Wessex in the Twenty-First Century (2010) offers Tony Fincham the opportunity to walk through Hardy's world by means of his narratives and poems—most notably, "A Man Was Drawing Near to Me" where, for example, Fincham takes the opportunity to investigate the narrow-gauge steam railway Hardy traveled by, the steep track he navigated on his way to St. Juliot, the White Hart Inn he stopped at for refreshment—this is the self-same inn "smiling nigh" of "St Launce's Revisited"—and the dogcart he hired at the White Hart for his onward journey. Although, as Fincham points out, much has changed since Hardy's day (wind- turbines on the open moorland), a fertile imagination and a forgiving nature allow for a rich appreciation not only of the beauties of the natural environment but also of Hardy's rare talent for transforming it into prose and verse . Other recent publications on Hardy's poetry include Dannie and Joan Abse's compilation The Music Lover's Literary Companion (2009) which con tains poetry and prose by Hardy; John Felstiner, Can Poetry Save the Earth? A Field Guide to Nature Poems (2009) which includes a chapter entitled "Sick Leaves...Storm-Birds...Rotten Rose...Rain-Drop: Nature Shadowing Thomas Hardy"; John Holmes, Darwin's Bards: British and American Poetry in the Age of Evolution ( 2009) which explores the ways in which some of the most notable poets of the past two centuries have dealt with these questions (Tennyson,</page><page sequence="43">ROSEMARIE MORGAN/389 Browning, Hardy, Frost, St Vincent Millay, Hughes, Gunn, Clampitt, and Edwin Morgan); Margot K. Louis, Persephone Rises 1860-1927: Mythography, Gender and the Creation of a New Spirituality ( 2009) which includes a chapter entitled "The Virgin with the Sheaf: Fertility, Ritual, and Imagination in Τess of the d'Urbervilles and M;y Antonia" and Jacek Wisniewski, Edward Thomas: A Mirror of England ( 2009), which includes a chapter entitled "Edward Thomas and Thomas Hardy: The English Line." Of particular note is the rapid increase in global studies in Hardy scholar ship. A few titles will have to suffice here. From France, Annie Ramel, "Actes de la journée Thomas Hardy.

Finally, while the Thomas Hardy Association's Poem of the Month series remains a "first"—the most vigorous, innovative and productive discussion of Hardy's poetry, under Phillip Mallett's directorship, in the current milieu, debating "Night in the Old Home" in this month of September (at http:// arts.st-andrews.ac.uk/ttha/)—honorable mention has to be given to Thierry Goater, Thomas Hardy: Figures de l'alinéation (2010), also a "first." This is the first critical book-length study of Hardy in French. Goater's groundbreaking study treats with the novels primarily ("Nous avons décidé de nous concen trer sur les '"Roman de caractère et d'environnement'"), under such alluring index-titles as "emprisonnement," "engloutissement," "refoulement," and the more familiar "invraisemblance"—to name but some. I understand from</page><page sequence="44">390 / VICTORIAN POETRY members of FATHOM, the Hardy Society of France, that there is yet more scholarship to come. Hopkins FRANK FENNELL The year 2010 seemed to be a transition year in Hopkins criticism: something of the old, something of the new, something poised between the two. The three published books focusing entirely or largely on Hopkins prove illustrative. John Parham's Green Man Hopkins: Poetry and the Victorian Ecological Imagination (New York: Rodopi) proposes an entirely new approach. He ar gues that the field he calls "green studies" is becoming more theory-driven, and that Hopkins' ideas, both in the poetry and in the prose, anticipate the latest developments in this new field. He distinguishes ecology, which he sees as a radical, even revolutionary philosophy, from more traditional and thus "shallow[er]" positions represented by terms like conservation, preservation, and environmentalism. Hopkins, so the argument runs, developed an "ecological imagination" which—and here Parham quotes political theorist Andrew Dobson approvingly—"seeks radically to call into question a whole series of political, economic, and social practices" (p. 16). The idea that so deeply a conservative man as Hopkins, conservative in his politics as much as in his religion, can be rescued from the dustbin of literary history by making him into a prototype of contemporary left-wing academics seems, well, a challenge to the imagination. Of the six substantive chapters in the book, the first positions this study as an example of "humanist ecocriticism" by locating it amid various competing trends in modern literary theory and practice. The second then goes back to Victorian attitudes toward what we call ecology, with excursions into familiar and often-explored territory: the inheritance of Romanticism and the influence of Ruskin and Morris. Both chapters serve as prolegomena to the analysis of Hopkins, which occupies chapters 3-6. Parham delineates the ways in which his journal entries reveal a young Hopkins melding art, architecture, and science into a distinctive philosophy which proposes "an organic unity, not of balance but of complexity" (p. 141). The early poetry also represents a fusion, this time of Ruskin, Wordsworth, and philology, into an "ecological philosophy of nature" (p. 148). Hopkins' best work can be found in his incipient "ecological social philosophy," a position from which Parham admits the poet retreated in his later years, a retreat which Parham contrasts unfavorably with William Morris' unswerving</page><page sequence="45">FRANK FENNELL / 391 dedication to a future socialist commonwealth. For this reviewer the greatest strength of Parham's monograph lies in its careful explanations of the ways in which Hopkins, while using a different vocabulary, did indeed anticipate many of the ideas in modern environmental ism. For example, Parham shows how a poem like "Pied Beauty" foreshadows what we now call biodiversity, or how "The Blessed Virgin Compared to the Air We Breathe" depends on a concept which Gary Snyder was later to call "wildness," or how the poems collectively provide an ontological dimension to what Jonathan Bates now calls an "ecopoetic." What we see is what Hop kins saw; we just have a new terminology for it. Parham deserves our thanks for his careful analysis of the many interesting adumbrations to be found in Hopkins' work. On the other hand for this reviewer the most important limitation of Parham's book is the way it often seems to take what Pope called "the high priori road." The assumption that Hopkins formulated an "ecological social philosophy" often over-determines a conclusion. Sprung rhythm, for example: it becomes not a feature of the poet's prosody but rather "a device by which Hopkins would hold society to account for any alterations to nature" (p. 161). Or the little poem "On a Piece of Music"—Parham argues that it "could be said to anticipate anxieties about the perceived hole in the ozone layer" (p. 184). An assumption once made also leads to a dismissive attitude toward undeniable features of Hopkins' work that do not fit conveniently. Parham acknowledges, for example, "the habitual tendency in some of Hopkins' verse to give pre-eminence to orthodox theology over ecology" (p. 185), an acknowl edgement the force of which would be felt more strongly if the word "some" were replaced by the more accurate phrase "almost all." In a similar vein the author points out that Hopkins' natural imagery often points beyond itself in ways that show how the poet "conforms to the contemporary understand ing of ecotheology"—except that this claim if true would buttress only what is said to be a "frankly marginal tradition of Christianity" (p. 249), a conclusion which seems to be giving away the store. As an example of an older approach we can consider a fragment of a monograph published not as a book per se but as the special issue of a journal. The late Humphry House, editor of some of the landmark works of Hopkins scholarship, undertook a monograph on the poet's early life up to the time of his becoming a Jesuit. The project was unfinished at the time of House's death in 1955. Although the two extant typescripts have been consulted by biographers, the work itself, carrying the provisional title "The Youth of Gerard Manley Hopkins 1844-1868," now is made available to everyone for the first time. Thanks to the perspicacity of the editors of Hopkins Quarterly a special issue, encompassing all four numbers of vol. XXXVII, provides 220 published pages, lightly edited by Lesley Higgins. The result amply justifies</page><page sequence="46">392 / VICTORIAN POETRY Higgins' claim that House's work "compels one's attention for the balanced synthesis of cultural contexts, personal circumstances, and attributes that House has achieved; the example of his dedicated and far-reaching research; the intellectual candour with which he approaches sensitive subject matter; and the sheer pleasure of reading his graceful and compelling prose" (p. xii). The far-reaching research and the graceful prose make the best case for this work as an exemplification of an older but still very relevant form of scholarship. House proposes in his introduction to examine Hopkins' early life as a way of getting to how he became "a man of such peculiar individuality" (p. 19). That theme of a singular individuality pervades the work. House argues that Hopkins was original without being peculiar—he rejects the charge that Hopkins was an oddball, a misfit. The three main parts of the work, on "Background and Boyhood," "Oxford," and "Religion" respectively, even with certain key parts missing in the typescripts, cohere because they elaborate on the central theme. House's approach is respectful, even affectionate. He neither distantiates nor practices the hermeneutics of suspicion. The topics which House pursued in his research and which he discusses with enlightening detail include the following: the poet's poetaster-father, Manley Hopkins, who showed a typically Victorian ability to separate his business life as a marine insurance adjuster from his private, family life; the nature of the household in which the poet grew up—for example, the one manservant, the four women members of the household staff, the horse but not the carriage—and how it fixes his social class; the young Hopkins' read ing; the genesis of Manley's connection to Hawaii and its effect on Gerard's imagination; Highwood School and the formidable Dr. Dyne; the nature of the family's High Anglicanism; the inter-relationships and ideologies of the Oxford professors who taught or influenced Hopkins; the nature of Oxford student life in the 1860s; and the intellectual currents then in play, for example, Darwinism, "Newmanism," and George Eliot-style humanism. On these and dozens of other topics House can be read with interest and profit, even when the current of his thought drifts away from Hopkins, as it sometimes does. "The Youth of Gerard Manley Hopkins 1844-1868" is a valuable addition to the canon of Hopkins criticism. Technically speaking Reading the Underthought: Jewish Hermeneutics and the Christian Poetry of Hopkins and Eliot (Washington: Catholic Univ. of America Press) is not a monograph on Hopkins either: it has two authors (Kinereth Meyer and Rachel Salmon Deshen) and a third of the book is given over to an analysis of T. S. Eliot. But the remaining two-thirds, over 180 pages, is longer than most monographs these days and is written or co-written by a distinguished contemporary Hopkins scholar, Rachel Salmon Deshen, so it deserves inclusion. Moreover it provides an excellent example of a type of criticism well-poised between the old and the new.</page><page sequence="47">FRANK FENNELL/ 393 What Meyer and Salmon Deshen propose is a method of reading Chris tian texts—in this case Hopkins' poems—according to rabbinic interpretive practices in order to generate a fruitful interplay among different cultural assumptions. Using Talmudic strategies to read Hopkins, for example, shows how poems grounded in Christian religious and cultural assumptions can still have meaning for readers who have quite different assumptions. Meyer and Salmon Deshen do not offer adversarial readings but rather attempt to account for why they feel emotionally and intellectually involved with works that have a different, even alien worldview. While they draw upon and have affinities with Gadamer, Ricoeur, and others, they see their endeavor as essentially recuperative, both of the Jewish hermeneutic tradition and of strategies of intertextuality. Their work, they believe, "will therefore be of interest... to a general theory of reading" because it "increases the consciousness of one's own interpretive tools" by focusing upon "the interpretive moves that readers . . . perform, rather than on interpreted content matter" (p. 23). After a chapter on the differences between classical Jewish hermeneu tics and the dominant modes of Western interpretive practice ("Jews and Christians may hold a Bible in common, but the two religions do not share a praxis of reading" [p. 65]), the authors launch into a three-part examination of Hopkins' poetry, and the results make for stimulating reading. Their analysis of "The Windhover" and "Spelt from Sibyl's Leaves" shows the originality and usefulness of their approach. Because their approach valorizes multiplicity and nonresolvability ("when there are many meanings, they are all retained even if they contradict each other" [p. 85]), it avoids the dichotomization which bedevils Western approaches. Take the oft-debated word "Buckle!" which opens the tenth line of "The Windhover," for example: it does not have to mean either strapping on or collapsing, the meanings do not have to be reconciled, instead the word's many meanings can all be retained despite their contrariety because a complete, consistent interpretation is neither possible nor desir able. Similarly, the many incongruencies and dissonances of the notoriously difficult "Spelt from Sibyl's Leaves" do not have to be smoothed out, the octet does not have to be made to reflect the sestet, the tone does not have to be adjusted to the other poems from this period. "From the viewpoint of rabbinic hermeneutics, no interpretation of 'Spelt from Sibyl's Leaves' need be true, in the sense of being fully adequate either to the language of the text or to the nature of reality" (p. 115). Later chapters of the book proceed in a similarly revelatory way, moving through "The Wreck of the Deutschland," the exuberant nature poems, and the late and painful so-called "terrible sonnets." One's only reservation is that almost all of this material has already appeared in the pages of scholarly journals, including this one, so that the arguments are not as forcefully new as they might otherwise be; but for all that the argu ments are cogently made and certainly most welcome.</page><page sequence="48">394 / VÍCTOR JAN POETRY Chapters on Hopkins from scholarly monographs published during 2010 include "Hopkins and Compression" (pp. 79-110) in Finn Fordham's 1 Do I Undo I Redo: The Textual Genesis of Modernist Selves in Hopkins, Yeats, Conrad, Forster, Joyce, and Woolf (Oxford Univ. Press). Fordham resurrects the theme of Hopkins as a proto-Modernist, but does so in a contemporary context: "I intend to examine the relations between processes of composition and reformulations of the self during the modernist period" (p. 7). The ap plication to Hopkins begins with the notion that the poet, in conversation with John Yeats and in his letters, always defended finish as a goal for a work of art. Yet he himself could rarely bring works to completion, so that his self judged failure to do so meant that he also experienced a truncation of his very identity, a sort of "self-compression." Beginning especially with the refusal by others to publish the "Wreck," Hopkins, in Fordham's view, both experienced and created a compression of self, of compositional processes, and of poetic themes. Textual compression is illustrated, for example, by the poet's quasi absurd economizing of paper; a reproduced page from his journal shows the cancellations, the re-workings of texts, and the self-castigation for "idleness" and other failures of compression in his personal life (although the fact that the journal dates from 1866 undercuts the argument about the importance of the "Wreck"). What Hopkins always longed for was the decompression that would come with publication and acclaim, but self-induced compression marks everything he does. Fordham even aligns compression with sprung rhythm, although his prosodie analyses are not fully convincing. The second chapter of Mark Payne's The Animal Part: Human and Other Animals in the Poetic Imagination (Univ. of Chicago Press), entitled "Destruction and Creation: The Work of Men and Animals in Gustave Flaubert, Gerard Manley Hopkins, and Ezra Pound" (pp. 59-80), identifies the Scotian concept of haecceitas as the key to understanding Hopkins' relationship to the natural world. By treasuring the "this-ness" of every creature Hopkins is able, in poem after poem, to emphasize the destructive consequences of human aggression and also the profound lessons that could be derived from a closer observation of animals as they go about doing their own work. A similar emphasis on Hopkins and nature characterizes "Toothpowder and Breadcrumbs: Gerard Manley Hopkins in the Alps," chapter 5 (pp. 173-199) in Ann C. Colley's Victorians in the Mountains: Sinking the Sublime (Ashgate). Colley recapitulates Hopkins' journey in the summer of 1868 but uses his journal entries to show how he resisted the impulse to succumb to familiar notions of the sublime: "Hopkins chose, instead, to honor his own idiosyncratic voice and vision so that he could spiritualize the ordinary and articulate his sense of the energy of creation in the small [toothpowder and breadcrumbs] as well as the large [the Alps]" (p. 174).</page><page sequence="49">FRANK FENNELL/ 395 The opening chapter of Timothy J. Sutton's Catholic Modernists, English Nationalists (Univ. of Delaware Press) focuses on "Gerard Manley Hopkins: A Royal Catholicism" (pp. 32-60). Sutton argues that literary modernists, faced with the decay of the British empire, converted to Catholicism because doing so provided "an answer to their desire for a return to Western hege mony, authority and security under a justifying transcendental myth" (p. 13). Hopkins' nationalism is of course well known, and Sutton therefore does not lack proof-texts for his thesis, especially among the later poems. But the thesis itself, depending as it does on an analysis of motives, does not have as much supporting biographical argumentation in Hopkins' case as it may have among some of the others Sutton discusses (Ford, Eliot, Waugh, Greene); moreover the Empire was still strong in Hopkins' time, the decay was to come later. Two briefer contributions to books edited by others deserve mention. Echoing Colley's fascination with the sublime, Harold Bloom and Blake Hobby have compiled a volume entitled simply The Sublime (Bloom's Liter ary Criticism), one chapter of which is Robert C. Evans' "Elements of the Longinian Sublime in the Poetry of Gerard Manley Hopkins" (pp. 89-98). Evans argues that one of the reasons Hopkins has proven so popular with modern and nonreligious readers "is the powerful sublimity of much of his writing—its frequent ability both to describe and to provoke an excited sense of elevation and loftiness" (p. 89) After identifying the salient characteristics of the Longinian idea of the sublime (Longinus was an author well known to the poet), Evans applies them to Hopkins' poetry and finds in the rhetoric, the phrasing, the imagery, and the morals a genuine correspondence. Katarzyna Winiarska's "Spatial Metaphors on Man-God Relationship in the Chosen Poems of Gerard Manley Hopkins," pp. 280-288 in Exploring Space: Spatial Notions in Cultural, Literary and Language Studies, ed. Andrej Ciuk and Katar zyna Molek-Kozakowska (Cambridge Scholars Press), notes that the man-God relationship often—inevitably?—depends upon spatial metaphors. Hopkins' poems, while they often emphasize man's division from God through meta phors of vertical and horizontal separation, also and paradoxically assert that the experience of separation can itself be a means of transcending the gulf. Journal articles on Hopkins include two major contributions. Jiong Liu's "Catholic Predilections in the Poetics of Gerard Manley Hopkins and Seamus Heaney" (Religion and the Arts 14: 267-296) traces the influences of the former on the latter and the ways their poetics grew out of their formation as Catholics. Both poets value the sound of words, especially dialect words, both treasure the physicality of language, both grapple with the influence of a [FJather. But there are major differences too. Whereas for Hopkins light—for example, lantern light in "The Lantern Out of Doors," to which Liu gives a very careful reading—constitutes a "life-giving dialogue between self and an ultimate addressee" (p. 283), for Heaney in poems like those included in The</page><page sequence="50">396 / VICTORIAN POETRY Haw Lantern there is no transcending light, rather it is more often the [self-) scrutinizing light of Diogenes the cynic. Whereas Hopkins sees in nature a dynamic narrative, Heaney finds only a realm of "verb-less" purity, a kind of Zen-like trance on the far side of doubt. Simon Humphries in "Hopkins's Silent Men" (ELH 77 no. 2: 447-476) situates his argument at the intersection of the old (formalist criticism), the soon-to-be-old (politicizing criticism), and the not-yet-born (neo-Formalism?), hoping to find space for a revisionary analysis of Hopkins and the male body. "For the contention of this essay is that men and boys in the poems of Gerard Manley Hopkins . . . enter the poems under a rule of silence: they must not speak; or if they do speak, they must be silenced" (p. 447). This "imaginative tendency" in Hopkins' poetry Humphries attributes to theological, sexual, and political sources. In a carefully nuanced argument Humphries points out the many contradictions to which Hopkins had to adjust—for example the idea that male beauty is God-given and therefore "lovely," yet also "dangerous" because it is a temptation to sin (see "To what serves Mortal Beauty?"). Yet again Hopkins prizes beauty of character, revealed in one's words, over beauty of mind and, lower yet, beauty of body; yet what is praised in the poetry is not what men say—they say almost nothing—but rather their bodies. Occasionally Humphries presses his argument too far, as when he stresses that it is a man carrying the lantern in "The Lantern out of Doors" (who else would be carry ing a lantern alone at night?), and sometimes he misreads the poet's theology (the "sweet reprieve" the priest carries in "Felix Randal" is confession). But his thesis is carefully formulated and fully persuasive, especially when he demonstrates that "an explicitly gay criticism must be problematic" (p. 468) because it misses the ways in which the poet's fascination with male bodies is constrained by conservative political, social, and theological constructs. Two shorter contributions deserve mention. Julia Hejduk in '"To R.B.': Hopkins' Ovidian Letter from the Black Sea" (International Journal of the Classical Tradition 17, no. 1: 53-59) notes how many readers have seen the poem as a "disappointing footnote" to Hopkins' career. But she believes that in the poem Hopkins adopts a voice not his own, but rather "a pagan voice aligned most closely with the exile poetry of Ovid" (p. 54). She goes on to demonstrate that Hopkins knew Ovid's poems of Black Sea exile very well and that the numerous parallels—the gestures, the role of the [absent] muse, the ambiguous sexuality, the loss of creativity, the epistolary format—may not be accidental. Martin Dubois in "The Month as Hopkins Knew It" (Victorian Periodicals Review 43 no. 3: 296-308) argues that readers have been victimized by an inadequate impression of the editorial policies of that Jesuit periodical, which refused to publish "The Wreck of the Deutschland." Rather than be ing uniformly Ultramontane, The Month began as an organ for Fr. Newman's more reserved approach to papal infallibility. As the 1870s wore on what did</page><page sequence="51">F RANK FENNELL/397 excite the editors—and here is where the attraction for Hopkins may have arisen—was their sympathy for stories of Catholic martyrdom, whether his torical or modern. Politically the editors were much exercised by Bismarck's Kulturkampf, a consequence of which was the tragic event memorialized in Hopkins' poem. An additional motive for his sending it to them may have been the editors' fervently expressed hope for the reconversion of England, a hope which the poet also shared. As noted earlier, Humphry House's draft of a biography of the young Hopkins appeared in the pages of Hopkins Quarterly, in Vol. XXXVII. But that journal also published six other articles during 2010, all in Vol. XXXVI. The first two articles are biographical. Nicolas Hawkes' "The Other Hopkinses" (pp. 3-24) traces the lineage of the poet and of his distant cousin, the Nobel Laureate biochemist Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins. The great-grandfather to both was Martin Hopkins (1748-1829), who appears from the verbal sketch of him to have been a rather formidable ancestor indeed. James Pribek S.J. in "Fr. Darlington's Memories of Hopkins: A More Favorable Appraisal" (pp. 25-55) uses much the same evidence as previous critics such as the Hopkins biographer Robert Bernard Martin and Fredric Schlatter S. J. but arrives at different conclusions. Joseph Darlington was, like Hopkins, an Oxford gradu ate, a convert thanks to Newman, and a Jesuit, and he shared quarters and taught at University College Dublin for two years during Hopkins' tenure, later returning to teach the young James Joyce. As a consequence he later became a source of information and appraisal when the poet's reputation was ascendant (Darlington lived until 1939), and Martin, Schlatter, and others have faulted him for providing an influential but biased and uncharitable assessment. In Pribek's view, however, "while Martin and Schlatter have helped Darlington by rescuing him from obscurity, it is still wiser to . . . [regard] Darlington as a lively but ultimately minor source of information. Moreover, in lieu of any contemporary testimony of Darlington displaying animosity toward Hopkins, scholars should privilege the favorable accounts of Darlington's character supplied by his Jesuit colleagues and his students" (p. 50). Michael Kuczynski in "Gerard Manley Hopkins and the Apocryphal Epistola Lentuli" (pp. 73-97) examines the sources of Hopkins' Bedford Leigh sermon of November 23, 1879. This supposed epistle of Lentulus, which provides a glowing appraisal of Christ's physical appearance, was actually composed during the medieval period as a devotional text. It later inspired popular devotions and also attacks by Renaissance humanists such as Erasmus, and appeared in various other versions as time went by. In Hopkins' time it was readily available from a number of sources, and Kuczynski shows that Hopkins' use of the material in his sermon suggests conflation of the epistle and a German text by Theodore Keim translated into English by Hopkins' old Oxford friend Martin Geldart. Blaise Cirelli in "Gerard Manley Hopkins</page><page sequence="52">398 / VICTORIAN POETRY and Teilhard de Chardin: The Poetic and Scientific Reconciliation of Spirit and Matter" (pp. 98-114) compares and contrasts the ways in which these two distinguished Jesuits dealt with the challenges of Darwinism and Modernism. Hopkins' reservations about Darwinian evolution had to do with his belief that it was too reductionist; Teilhard's reservations were directed at the scientific theory itself. Both were Scotist, both had a sacramental and Christocentric view of the world, both were deeply teleological. Hopkins' quarrels were private, however, while Teilhard accepted the challenge of public debate and sought to alter Church thinking. Two brief but interesting articles conclude Vol. XXXVI: Mary Hewitt's "Felix Randal's 'Battering Sandal': What Did It Look Like?" (pp. 115-118) establishes that the item in question was not an ordinary horseshoe but rather a patten, used on the hind feet of drayhorses to provide traction, while Joseph Feeney S.J. in "Hopkins on Stage, Sumptuously, in Sante Fe" (pp. 119-122) describes a multimedia event held on December 19-20, 2009 in that city. The event, entitled "As Kingfishers Catch Fire: A Celebration of the Poetry of Gerard Manly Hopkins," was organized by the ater director David Olson and poet David Markwardt, and was attended by hundreds. The celebration included lectures and panel discussions but also, and especially, music, dance, art, and—of course—poetry, not only Hopkins' own but also response poems by contemporary poets. And it is fitting that we conclude this year's assessment with so celebratory an occasion. It is not every poet who inspires such public devotion. The Pre-Raphaelites FLORENCE S. BOOS The year's publications have included a number of article-length stud ies of Christina Rossetti, Dante Rossetti, and William Morris, as well as the final volume of Dante Rossetti's letters, an essay-collection devoted to Morris' writings, and a critical study of his prose romances. Dante Gabriel Rossetti The Correspondence of Dante Gabriel Rossetti, originally edited by William E. Fredeman, has now been completed eleven years after Fredeman's death with vol. 9, The Last Decade, 1873-1882, IV. 1880-1882, co-edited by Roger C. Lewis, Jane Cowan, and Anthony H. Harrison. This final volume's appendi ces include a description of Rossetti's death and burial, a chronology of his work on the 1881 Ballads and Sonnets and Poems and list of their reviews, and an account of his final contacts with his former model and mistress Fanny Cornforth, who visited him often in his last months.</page><page sequence="53">FLORENCE S. BOOS / 399 During his final twenty-seven months of life, Rossetti finished "The Day-Dream," "La Pia de' Tolomei," and "Dante's Dream," and made progress on prior drafts of "Found" and "The Salutation of Beatrice." His greatest financial success was a long-delayed and intricately negotiated sale of "Dante's Dream" to the municipal council of Liverpool, whose members installed it with honors and praiseful remarks by Hall Caine. (For comparison, during the week in which he told his mother and sister about this £1650 sale, he engaged the services of a servant girl for £12 a year.) Writing in the evenings when he could not paint, Rossetti also completed five sonnets on Romantic poets, made revisions to "Sister Helen" and "Rose Mary," completed "The King's Tragedy," and added a significant number of sonnets to "The House of Life," among them the work's well-known introit, "A Sonnet is a Moment's Monument." As he suffered from the final stages of kidney failure, he also revised and extended the comic ballad Jan Van Hunks, and in the last week of his life—when he could no longer write clearly—he dictated two sonnets on "The Sphinx" to be sent to Theodore Watts-Dunton (who later declined to permit William Michael Rossetti to print them in his 1903 edition of the Poetical Works, thus consigning two of Rossetti's finest poems to relative obscurity). While he was still in better health, Rossetti circulated drafts and revi sions of poems for his Poems and Ballads and Songs (both 1881), and recorded personal satisfaction with "The White Ship" ("a good 'un, I hope" [April 22, 1880]) and "The King's Tragedy" ("a ripper" [March 3, 1881]). He also wrote his fellow artist William Davies that he had "written two historical ballads which will certainly find a much wider field of appreciation than anything I have yet done" (March 16, 1881). Interestingly, Rossetti reread and re-studied the Romantic poets in the last two years of his life, drew up lists of his preferences among the poems of his honored predecessors, and offered suggestions to H. Buxton Forman as the latter edited the works of Keats; to Theodore Watts-Dunton as he edited the poetry of Thomas Chatterton; and to Anne Gilchrist as she prepared the manuscript of her late husband William's two-volume Life of William Blake. Rossetti was also faithfully attended throughout this period by the youthful Hall Caine, whose Sonnets of Three Centuries ( 1882) benefited from Rossetti's insights, blunt criticisms, and suggestions for sonnets to include. Rossetti admired Christopher Smart, dismissed Blake's "prophetic" poems and was particularly impressed by the poetry of Donne, whose "Flea" he described with amusement to Jane Morris (February 26, 1880). To his credit, he also befriended the working-class poet Joseph Skipsey, and the writer and friend of Ruskin, Thomas Dixon. Even so, on occasion Rossetti's critical insights failed him. When Caine wrote that G. M. Hopkins' "Starlight" was "distinguished by marked</page><page sequence="54">400/ VICTORIAN POETRY originality both of thought and structure," Rossetti answered "I cannot in any degree tolerate Mr. Hopkins' sonnets" (March 31, 1881). As a result none of Hopkins' verse darkened the volume's pages, depriving Caine of the honor of introducing him more widely to the Victorian public decades before the appearance of Hopkins' Poems in 1918. Rossetti also wrote Jane Morris that Oscar Wilde's 1881 Poems was "wretched . . . trash," and that Edward Burne Jones's admiration of them was evidence that Jones (whom he perhaps now viewed as a rival) had "gone driveling" (October 4, 1881). Rossetti had a remarkable ability to hold lines and entire poems in memory, a gift which sometimes gave rise to groundless charges of "plagia rism"—for example, that Wordsworth had borrowed passages in his sonnets from Spenser, an offense which prompted Rossetti to "consider whether a bard was likely to do this once &amp;. yet not to do it often" (September 10, 1880). He also charged Caine as well as Theodore Watts-Dunton with quasi-plagiarism of his own work, and complained to Lucy Rossetti that "a thing shown in MS. is actually liable to charges of plagiarism when it appears, owing to what it has already furnished to others" (December 30, 1880). Some of Rossetti's remarks about composition and prosody were more quotable. When Caine sought to formulate strict rules "for the perfect son net," for example, he noted impatiently that "conception, my boy, Fundamental Brainwork, ... is what makes the difference in all art. Work your metal as much as you like, but first take care that it is gold &amp; worth working" (March 8, 1881). And when Caine included "euphemeristic" and "anthropomorphism" in an essay on Shakespeare, Rossetti insisted that he did not "find life long enough to know in the least what they mean," and added that "simple English in prose writing and in all narrative poetry (however monumental language may become in abstract verse) seems to me a treasure not to be foregone" (March 12, 1880). On the other hand, Rossetti disliked political allusions in literary work, characterizing them to Caine as "the momentary momentousness &amp; eternal futility of many noisiest questions" (February 16, 1880). He responded to views Caine expressed in his essay "Politics and Art" with a table-thumping "veto against the absolute participation of artists in politics" (February 25, 1880), and welcomed Caine into his house on condition that he avoid "outside mat ters of any kind which I do not entertain at all" (April 12, 1881). He belittled Holman Hunt's, Bume-Jones's and Morris' attendance at a meeting in support of repeal of the Deceased Wife's Sister Act (which rendered illegal Hunt's current marriage), and praised Caine to Jane Morris as a good companion who "never talks Politics" (August 18, 1881). More intrusively, when his brother William began to write a sonnet sequence in defense of the political uprisings of the day—his most original and sustained literary endeavor—Dante wrote him to decline the offer of</page><page sequence="55">FLORENCE S. BOOS / 401 a dedication, and enjoined his wife Lucy to block this "clear possibility of absolute ruin" (i. e., loss of employment [April 12, 1881]). William defended himself, but his Democratic Sonnets remained unpublished until 1907, when their immediate relevance had passed. An interesting minor thread through the letters was the Rossetti family's community of book lenders and borrowers. Both Rossetti brothers had well stocked libraries, and Dante was eager to loan his books and borrow others, among them Giorgio Vasari's Lives of the Artists, Thomas Hope's 1821 Costume of the Ancients, two volumes of a French dictionary, and two volumes of the Rime di Fra Guittone d'Arezzo. Rossetti could scarcely be described as religious in the usual senses, but skepticism annoyed him, and when Ford Madox Brown questioned the hope, expressed in one of his sonnets, that Brown, his first wife, and their son would meet in an afterlife, Rossetti remonstrated against this "inconceivable craze of dogmatic Atheism" (August 10, 1880). In another, sadder register, he wrote Jane Morris of his fears of her death: "I had got to look on everything as an omen—seeing the drawing's frame ... stand empty over my mantelpiece. Then there was the accident to the other drawing of you,—a tree fell in the garden—&amp; altogether things looked ominous" (January 7, 1880). He also pressed dubious potions on ailing friends, consulted a mesmerist for possible help for a weak hand (January 13, 1880), and regaled Jane Morris with quasi-supernatural anecdotes (about a supposed encounter between Wil liam Holman Hunt and the Devil, for example [January 7, 1880]), and petty gossip (Agnes Jervis' desertion of her husband George Lewes, for example, was justified since "her husband was such a horrid fellow . . . [but s]he took up with the only man to be found who was uglier than Lewes" [September 3, 1880]). He also could be demanding; at one point Jane Morris set aside a sitting for Rossetti to return with her family to Kelmscott Manor, and Rossetti petulantly responded: The picture must thus be turned to the wall. . . . [Wjould a reclining posture while I draw your hands have affected it more than the same posture at home?—surely not more than a sudden journey and stop page to see the water party [i. e., to greet her family after their summer boat trip to Kelmscott]. . . . [I]f you withdraw [your consideration], it is the only one of many withdrawals which will go to my heart. (August 16, 1881) In another letter, he ordered Jane not to "look up any one else on the same day [before a visit]. I don't like to be 'come on' to" (April 12, 1880). On occasion Jane Morris seems to have echoed Rossetti's voluble self pity. At one point Rossetti wrote her that "I am desolate enough, as you know" (March 3, 1880), for except for her "all else is withered and gone" (November</page><page sequence="56">402 / VICTORIAN POETRY 26, 1880); she replied that "life wd be unendurable now if it were not for those who are merely friends" (September 3, 1880), and Rossetti discerned a "sweet shadow of reproach which you permit yourself... for all the sorrow which I know that my isolation brings to you" (September 3, 1880). William Morris figured principally as the butt of less elegant jibes ("O for that final Cabinet Ministry which is to succeed the [cjabinet d'aisance of his early years" [July 18, 1881]). When Morris studied the tapestry techniques later employed at Merton Abbey, for example, Rossetti wrote William Bell Scott that "Top goes on with his enormous "Sampler" which promises no visible use or outlet for sale. He has already spent 2 years on it and has now established a complete school of embroidery in his coach-house" (July 14, 1880). When Caine was canvassing for sonnets to include in his volume, Rossetti—he of the exhaustive textual memory—claimed that he didn't "think Morris ever did a sonnet" (ignoring several published during the years of their acquaintance [September 23, 1880]), and he found the Morris family's trips upriver to Kelmscott ludicrous ("Morris &amp;. family have taken the funny freak of spending a week going up the river in a big boat.... [I]t sounds rheumatic though romantic" [August 10, 1880]). At one point Rossetti's patron L. R. Valpy wrote him to ask if Morris could offer suggestions for a scheme of school decoration, and he "wrote a line to Top as to a bear notorious for the sorest of heads" (February 14, 1881). At another, a relative of the late Arthur O'Shaughnessy sent Morris a volume of Victor Hugo's poetry as a memorial, and Rossetti anticipated Morris' "volley of curses at [the dead poet's] ghost &amp; hurling forth the book on the head of the passing stranger" (February 16, 1881). As it turned out, Morris offered to design the school decorations pro bono and courteously acknowledged the well-intended gift. During this period Rossetti was pathologically reluctant to leave home or receive unfamiliar visitors, and he admitted to Thomas Dixon that "I.. . am subject to nervous depression to a degree which often renders me unable to see others" (June 18, 1880). These "others" increasingly included his mother Frances, his sister Christina, his brother William and his sister-in-law Lucy, as well as their sons and daughters and the artistic friends of his youth (his relatives loyally came to him instead). Not surprisingly, he wrote plaintively to William Graham of his "very lonely existence" (December 24, 1880) and to Davies that "my . .. life is a very uncheered one" (March 16, 1881). To Watts Dunton he remarked that "the amount of solitude I endure must really have an avoirdupois weight if it could be computated" (c. August 5, 1881), and he reproachfully asked Fanny Cornforth (now Fanny Shotts) "Why did you not come yesterday evening? This is the third day that I am absolutely alone" 0uly 31, 1881).</page><page sequence="57">FLORENCE S. BOOS/403 Well aware of all this, William Michael Rossetti (whom Dante aptly described as the "truest of true brothers" [December 27, 1880]) visited weekly, and the artist Frederick Shields provided assorted painting services in return for tutelage. Hall Caine essentially became Rossetti's secretary and factotum, and attended to errands, inquiries, and the more important work of negotiat ing on Rossetti's behalf with the aforementioned Liverpool councilors. For his part, Watts-Dunton served as Rossetti's lawyer, accountant, and bill-payer, as well as confidant, companion, fellow-poet, ever-tactful critic, and in-house reviewer of Rossetti's poetry. Rossetti sought his advice about everything from the revision of a line to negotiations with his publisher and the sequence in which he should pay his bills. Watts was the quiet, stabilizing force of Rossetti's final years, and the latter's dedication of Ballads and Sonnets to "the friend whom my verse won for me" was amply well earned. The nine-volume Correspondence of Dante Gabriel Rossetti has thus now accompanied its subject to the threshold of his death. More generally, the letters of William Morris, Christina Rossetti, and Dante Rossetti have swelled the ranks of these annual reviews for the better part of twenty-five years. They have offered troves of carefully annotated information about their subjects, as well as the social, artistic, and epistolary practices of a generation long past, and I will sincerely miss them. In "D. G. Rossetti and Christina Rossetti as Sonnet Writers" (VP 48, no. 4: 461-473), Isobel Armstrong considers the Victorian sonnet against a background of the new technologies associated with photography, and observes that its "highly restricted focus parallels the greeting of experience that occurs in a photograph, mediated through the narrow aperture of the lens" (p. 462). Her readings of Dante Rossetti's "Willowwood 1" sonnet and Christina Rossetti's "We lack, but cannot fix upon the lack" from her Later Life sequence prompt Armstrong to conclude that Dante Rossetti "exploited the new technologies of seeing to . . . meditate on the gap between the reflected body and the body itself," whereas Christina "evolved a language of depletion from the latent terminology of the lens" (p. 472). In "Work, Lack, and Longing: Rossetti's 'The Blessed Damozel' and the Working Men's College" (Victorian Studies 52, no. 2: 219-248), Kristin Mahoney finds a correlation between Rossetti's experiences at the Working Men's College and patterns of labor and longing in his revisions of "The Blessed Damozel." Arguing that Rossetti's teaching work strengthened his own aesthetic practice, she suggests that he refined his aesthetic to emphasize the "perfection, rather than the satisfaction, of desire" (p. 243) as he came to understand that "only toil, true and extended labor .. . open the artist's eyes to the overwhelming amount of detail in the natural world" (p. 227).</page><page sequence="58">404 / VICTORIAN POETRY Christina Rossetti: In "The House of Christina Rossetti: Domestic and Poetic Spaces" (JPRS 19: 31-54), Diane D'Amico examines Rossetti's London dwellings at 56 Huston Square and 30 Torrington Square. Aided by illustrations of Rossetti's Torrington Square home and a photograph of her drawing-room window, D'Amico finds a number of conjectural correlations between passages of Rossetti's poetry and her peaceful views of birds, rooftops, and urban gardens as she worked. In "Limited Knowledge and the Tractarian Doctrine of Reserve in Christina Rossetti's The Face of the Deep" (VP 48, no. 2: 219-241), Andrew D. Armond argues that Rossetti's exegesis of the Book of Revelations was guided by the Tractarian doctrine of "reserve," an admission of human inability fully to understand God's ways, and conjectures that, as she struggled "with the harrowing, violent text of Revelation ... in light of the principle of Divine Love" (p. 240), she was following John Keble's and Isaac Williams's precepts that poetry should convey "the spontaneous outflow of intense emotion in the face of the Incommensurate" (p. 237). In "Christina Rossetti and the Poetics of Tractarian Suffering" (Through a Glass Darkly: Suffering, the Sacred, and the Sublime in Literature and Theory [Waterloo, Ontario: Wilfrid Laurier Univ. Press], pp. 155-167), Esther T. Hu rejects Sandra Gilbert's and Susan Gubar's view that an "extraordinary, mas ochistic vision" infused Rossetti's poetry, and argues that Rossetti interpreted her struggles with the agonies of Graves' disease and terminal breast cancer "as a sacrifice of thanksgiving and hope," and expression of her conviction that such "suffering might restore and reorient the soul" (p. 166). In "Christina Rossetti's 'Wounded Speech'" (Literature and Theology 24, no. 4: 345-359), Joel Westerholm rejects the claim that Rossetti practiced Tractarian "reserve," and instead suggests that Rossetti "sought to be as clear and explicit as she could" (p. 346), that she "wrote as a poet, not a [Tractar ian] theologian" (p. 347), and that her poetic prayers revealed a pattern of "wounded speech" (a term borrowed from the twentieth-century theologian Jean-Louis Chrétien), which upheld supplicants' "state of faithfulness," offered solace for their yearnings, and forgave them their many failures (pp. 345-346). In "Christina Rossetti: An Unpublished Letter and An Unrecorded Copy of Verses" (Notes &amp; Queries 57, no. 2: 221-223), William Baker describes a newly discovered letter from Christina Rossetti to Charles Howell found in a copy of her privately printed 1847 Verses, in which she thanked Howell for a gift of stamps and took exception to apparent anti-religious sentiments in a letter he enclosed. In "Christina Rossetti's 'The Prince's Progress' and Edward Bulwer Lytton's The Last Days of Pompeii" (ANQ 23, no. 4: 227-230), Simon Humphries argues that the volcanic landscape, portrayal of an aged alchemist,</page><page sequence="59">FLORENCE S. BOOS / 405 and general apocalyptic tone of "The Prince's Progress" owed something to the denouement of Bulwer Lytton's novel. William Morris: I will begin with Anna Vaninskaya's William Monis and the Idea of Com munity: Romance, History, and Propaganda, 1880-1914 (Edinburgh Univ. Press), which offers a thorough and probing account of the intellectual context of Morris' socialist literary writings and their aftermath in the ρ re-World War I period. A first section on "Romance" outlines the many meanings of this term, traces the critical debates over the respective merits of "romance" and "real ism," and places Morris and many of his fellow socialists firmly in the camp of literary romanticism—though she notes that it was European naturalism, not romanticism, which carried a message of support for oppressed peoples, and gained Morris' approval during debates over the morality of Zola's Germinal. In her second section, "History," Vaninskaya offers a detailed analysis of nineteenth-century historical and political debates about the nature of historical cycles and socialist historiography, and their influence on Morris' A Dream of John Ball, The House of the Wülfings, The Roots of the Mountains and Socialism: Its Growth and Outcome (coauthored with Ernest Belfort Bax). With respect to medieval gilds, artisanal organizations, agricultural cooperatives, and other communal undertakings, for example, she argues that Morris and Bax radicalized contemporary liberal views of "Teutonic" communities to conjecture that such communities had "yielded place to medieval fellowship, which was to await its own resurrection in the socialist Commonwealth" (p. 137). She notes, however, that in A Dream of John Ball Morris departed from contemporary historians' accounts of the Peasants' War, for example, in reject ing their claim that the egalitarian John Ball was probably a Lollard (member of a somewhat less pacificist fourteenth-century 'quaker'-like movement). In "Propaganda," the book's third and final section, Vaninskaya ex amines some of the divergent early twentieth-century cultural strands which emerged from fin-de-siècle British socialism, among them Robert Blatchford's Clarion movement and the fictional accounts set forth in H. G. Wells's Anna Veronica and Robert Tressell's Ragged Trousered Philanthropists. This is a worthy undertaking, for later-twentieth century Marxists often derided Morris' views by association with such early twentieth century authors, and it is good to have a critical analysis of the divergences just mentioned. In his new edition of The Wood Beyond the World (Broadview Press), Robert Boenig provides a text based on the work's first three editions (among them the edition in the Collected Works, which appeared after Morris' death), but does not list their corresponding variants, presumably because the vol ume is a reading edition for students. Boenig's introduction offers relevant information about Morris' life and use of archaisms, and addresses some of</page><page sequence="60">406 / VICTORIAN POETRY the political undercurrents in his romances. In a useful series of appendices, he also offers two of Morris' essays, excerpts from the Morte D'Arthur and Morris' own translations of Beowulf and the Volsunga Saga, and brief but ap posite remarks by Marx, Ruskin, and May Morris, among others. Boenig's edition of this relatively short and accessible romance offers students a good first introduction to Morris' writings, and to Pre-Raphaelitism as a whole. Several years ago, I compared a list of Morris' published socialist essays with two large volumes of his manuscripts in the British Library, and found that seven of the Library's manuscripts had never appeared in more than fragmentary (or at least heavily truncated) form. I have since shepherded six of these essays into print, of which three appeared this past year: "'Socialism' and 'What We Have to Look For': Two Unpublished Lectures by William Morris (Journal of William M orris Studies 19, no. 1: 9-51); and "William Mor ris's 'Commercial War': A Critical Edition" (Journal of Pre-Raphaelite Studies 19 [Fall 2010]: 45-65). In "Socialism," a critique of capitalism he drafted in 1885, Morris outlined a number of ways in which capitalists exploit corporate-feudal underclasses of workers who could not "be said to have more than a subsistence wage" and are protected from penury only until "their time, of industrial death so to say, comes on them" (p. 22). Even at this early stage Morris warned that a non-violent transformation of society would not be easy, but would require "the combination and organization of all that is most energetic, most orderly, most kindly, most aspiring among the working-classes" (p. 29). In "What We Have to Look For," an essay Morris drafted a year before his death in 1896, he argued (as he had already done in News from Nowhere) that the underlying aim of sincere socialists should be to bring about an "end of all politics"; that even socialist political parties are makeshifts, as well as dubious means to untrustworthy parliamentary ends; and that no legislation in a capitalist society would bring about anything more than tenuous pallia tive changes in ordinary people's lives. He also observed that "it has become a common-place that there is little difference between the two parties except that of ins &amp; outs" (p. 43). Or as Old Hammond had put it in Chapter XIV of News from Nowhere: [The two 'major' parties] only PRETENDED to this serious difference of opinion; for if it had existed they could not have dealt together in the ordinary business of life; couldn't have eaten together, bought and sold together, gambled together, cheated other people together. ... [T]he PRETENCE of serious difference of opinion [is] belied by every action of their lives. In '"Commercial War'" (1885)—a single paragraph of which had been previously excerpted in print—Morris developed another structural attack on corporate capitalism: its enormous waste, the widespread destitution which</page><page sequence="61">FLORENCES. BOOS/407 followed in its wake, and its role as a willing abettor of rapacious imperial wars. He also expressed disgust with the corrupt media which undergirded such "commerce" ("our newspaper and periodical press are little more than puffing sheets" [p. 54]), and went so far as to argue that the Madhists who resisted English rule in the Sudan died in "much the same spirit as that which held the long-haired Greeks of Thermopolae" (p. 60). Three independent studies of Morris' political writings appeared last year in a special issue of The Journal of William Morris Studies devoted to "Mor ris, Conflict and Historical Change." In "Riot, Romance and Revolution: William Morris and the Art of War" (JWM.S 18, no. 4: 22-35), for example, Phillippa Bennett compares Morris' use of metaphors of struggle and violence with the writings of socialist contemporaries such as Friedrich Engels and Peter Kropotkin; notes a tension between Morris' stated "religious hatred towards all war and violence" and his "emphasis on the value of the heroic spirit" in political conflicts (p. 29); and argues that this tension was partially resolved toward the end of his life in egalitarian prose romances such as The Sundering Flood (p. 30). In "William Morris: The Myth of the Fall" (JWMS 18, no. 4: 48-57), Anna Vaninskaya contests G. B. Shaw's claim that after 1887 Morris retreated from socialist activity and "practically" accepted Fabian incrementalist views of the ways in which social change must occur. Documenting Morris' continuing activity as a non-parliamentary stump speaker before physical illness overtook him in the mid-1890s, she offers a carefully reasoned account of Morris' cri tique of "(social) democratic machinery," and concludes that Morris never wavered from his view that political power "was not franchise in a representa tive system but 'direct control by the people of the whole administration of the community'" (p. 54). In "Time and Utopia: The Gap Between Morris and Bax" (JWMS 18, no. 4: 36-47), Ruth Kinna examines divergent views held by Morris and Er nest Belfort Bax, his sometime collaborator in the composition of Socialism: Its Growth and Outcome (1893). Both men thought that history reenacted and transformed older practices in new forms; both advocated a "religion of socialism" based on an underlying belief in the equality of peoples; and both held that human agency as well as material circumstances conditioned social change. But Bax also believed that imperfections of transmission and reception made it impossible to formulate projections of future contingen cies, whereas Morris "gave history content, and believed that. .. history was a source of knowledge: the knowledge of what tomorrow should be" (p. 45). In "The Defence ofGuenevere: A Morrisean Critique of Medieval Violence" C/WMS 18, no. 4: 8-21), I offer another interpretation of the stylized and eroti cized violence of The Defence of Guenevere. Drawing on Henri Lefèbvre's view that good historical art vivifies "the vast emptiness which is everyday life," I</page><page sequence="62">408 / VICTORIAN POETRY claim that Morris' evocations of ruptured or fragmented forms of memory in The Defence—forgotten artworks, fragmentary refrains, untransmitted stories, and anonymous songs—were animated by his conviction that "the lesser arts" preserve a redemptive palimpsest of cultural memory. In '"The Measured Music of Our Meeting Swords': William Morris's Early Romances and the Transformative Touch of Violence" ( Review of English Studies, N. S. 61, no. 250: 435-454), Ingrid Hanson interprets violent episodes in Morris' prose romances as expression of his rejection of "middle-class eco nomic values of capitalism [and] the spiritual values of a dualistic Christianity" (p. 437), in favor of "simpler, blunter and more direct interactions of medi eval times and tales" (p. 437). She argues, for example, that "the truth of the universe" for the knights in "Gertha's Lovers" is "discovered through manly physical passion, which shows itself in thwarted caresses, accomplished killing and gruesome death" (p. 445), and that "the form of ["The Hollow Land"] as well as its content, suggests the necessity of furious disorder—both mental and physical—in the creation of a new identity" (p. 443). The nature of this "new identity" seems to me open to question, as does the essay's conflation of "violence" with "bodily contact." Less problematic may be her assertion that Morris' "stories create[d] a world whose centre is neither symbolic religious acts nor strategic economic ones, but rather tactile interactions which locate meaning and truth in the body and its relation to the world" (p. 449). In "Aesthetic Effects and Their Implications in 'Rapunzel,' 'The Wind,' and other poems from William Morris's The Defence of Guenevere" (JWMS 19, no. 1: 52-65), Alexander Wong assesses the "strange" qualities of these poems and their "ambiguous treatment of social themes" (p. 54). For him the ending of "Rapunzel" fails to give "satisfaction to either the hero's anxieties or the heroine's [fears] regarding the 'dreams' which cloud their experiences" (p. 60), and he interprets "The Wind" as an expression of the protagonist's "dysfunc tional relationship with nature" (p. 63). The poems' use of vivid colors serves as a protest against etiolated social conventions, as well as a manifestation of "social and sexual tensions and disturbed emotions" (p. 55). In "The Kelmscott Chaucer and The Golden Cockerel Canterbury Tales" (JWMS 19, no. 1: 66-80), Peter Faulkner contrasts Morris' ideals for the Kelmscott Chaucer with its crowded realizations on the physical page. Argu ing that Burne-Jones's intricately detailed illustrations and the small typeface needed to compress all Chaucer's works into a single volume made the text and illustrations theoretically beautiful but difficult to read, he suggests that the more open Golden Cockerell text of The Canterbury Tales is less iconic but more pleasing to the eye, and therefore a better realization of Morris' ideal of "a stimulus to the free spirit of man" (p. 69). Six relevant essays appear in M orris in the Twenty-First Century (Lang), edited by Phillippa Bennett and Rosie Miles. In the first, "Versions of Ecoto</page><page sequence="63">FLORENCE S. BOOS / 409 pia in News from Nowhere" (pp. 93-106), Tony Pinkney argues that "Pure Air, [Pure] Water, and Earth," are present in News' opening pages, but not "Fire," which he interprets as "energetic modernity" (p. 94). He suggests that Ellen and Old Hammond will have to bestir themselves if Nowhere is to be more than an "epoch of rest," for "new . . . dynamism, challenge, and discovery, both political and technological" is needed (p. 103). Within the "largely pre industrial ecotopia of Morris' News from Nowhere there is a more adequate, more modernist, more fiery ecotopia struggling to get out" (p. 106), as exemplified in late twentieth-century utopias such as Kim Staley Robinson's Pacific Edge, Ernest Callenbach's Ecotopia, and Ursula Le Guin's The Dispossessed. In "William Morris, Human Nature and the Biology of Utopia" (pp. 107-128), Piers J. Hale recalls nineteenth-century Darwinian and Lamarck ian views of evolution, argues that inheritance of temperamental traits à la Lamarck had buttressed the hopes of Morris and other reformists for revo lutionary social change within a few generations, and concludes that "our own skepticism about the possibility of a radically different future is no less culturally contingent than was Morris's optimism" (p. 127). In "William Morris's Germania: The Roots of Revolution" (pp. 169-192), Anna Vaninskaya reconstructs the political landscape of nineteenth century Germanic historiography as an antecedent of Morris' representation of village communities in the medieval past as a basis of socialist hopes for the future. She observes that the "Barbarian society of the Wolfings and socialist society of Nowhere were the beginning and end terms of a single historical sequence" (p. 188), and concludes that theorists of utopia should "heed the philologi cal lesson and keep in mind the written word's susceptibility to ideological interpretation" (p. 191). In "Between Hell and England: Finding Ourselves in the Present Text" (pp. 193-207), David Latham offers an assessment of the importance of metaphor and of liminal states in Morris' thought. Comparing John Ball's assertion that "that earth and heaven are not two but one" with Ellen's gently contingent exhortation at the end of News from Nowhere, he concludes that Morris' ideal of "art is [or should be] not merely the revelatory dream of 'a glimpsed alternative'; it is the full embrace of a revolutionary commitment to the potential of each individual life" (p. 206). In "Rejuvenating Our Sense of Wonder: The Last Romances of Wil liam Morris" (pp. 209-228), Phillippa Bennett adduces scenes in The Well at the World's End, The Wood Beyond the World, and other romances to argue that "rejuvenation of our sense of wonder is the most significant achievement of [these] last romances" (p. 211), and indeed that all of Morris' literary works are animated to some degree by "pursuit of and receptivity to wonder" (p. 212). Such epiphanies, for Morris, might be found "in the natural world, [and] on a social as well as personal level" (p. 217), and "in his final narratives [a] cottage</page><page sequence="64">410/VICTORIAN POETRY [could], in its own way, be as wondrous as the cathedral" (p. 223). She notes that most of us, sadly, are "more interested in novelty than in wonder [, and] more attracted to the sensational than to the wondrous" (p. 228). In "Virtual Paradise: Editing Morris for the Twenty-First Century" (pp. 231-253), Rosie Miles, who first conceived the notion of a virtual edition of Morris' literary works, reviews some of the motivations for such an undertak ing. One of them was Morris' own interest in "the technologies of the book" (p. 232), and another the "ability of the digital medium to reinstate the visual alongside the verbal in ways that go beyond the limitations of either the facsimile or critical edition in book form" (p. 242). Adducing Poems by the Way as an ideal case for electronic reproduction, Miles construes the Morris Online Edition (http://morrisedition.lib.uiowa.edu) "as an attempt to restore awareness of the visual and material facets of Morris's works for the twenty first century, so that they might be read . . . with fresh eyes" (pp. 248-249). Next year's works for review will include a collected edition of Jane Morris' Letters; a Census of copies of the Kelmscott Chaucer; Morris' brief but pointed appeal for "Equality"; and an academically "transgressive" work which bears the title Pleasure Bound: Victorian Sex Rebels and the New Eroticism. Swinburne YISRAEL LEVIN Although the quantity of this year's Swinburne scholarship cannot match the bonanza of the 2009 Swinburne centennial, the quality of the offerings is in no way less, and each of the articles I am about to discuss below helpfully expands the contexts in which we might read Swinburne's works. "Context" is perhaps the keyword here as it has been in the last few years. Swinburne tends to be perceived now as part of greater nineteenth- and twentieth-century movements both as a participant and a source of influence. This interesting shift in critical attitudes helps to establish Swinburne's significance in recent literary history. Swinburne was not only an innovative poet, but also a prolific and insightful art critic. The main reason his reputation as a critic is generally overshadowed by his reputation (or infamy) as a poet is his rather unortho dox approach to art criticism. As Stefano Evangelista writes in "Swinburne's Galleries" (Yearbook of English Studies 40, no. 1-2 [2010]: 160-179), "Swinburne played an important, if often neglected, role in establishing an experimental style of critical prose linked to Aestheticism and made famous by his near contemporary Pater" (p. 160). Focusing on "Notes on some Pictures of 1868" and "Notes on Design of the Old Masters at Florence," also published in</page><page sequence="65">YISRAEL LEVIN/411 1869, Evangelista manages to define the main principles of Swinburne's art criticism. As a commentator on art, Evangelista writes, Swinburne was never interested in adopting the objective, historically aware point of view that was becoming popular during the nineteenth century. Instead, for Swinburne the art gallery was "a space of interchange and fluidity where the poet-critic participates in cosmopolitan intertextual and inter-artistic networks, and where the act of gazing at the art object operates a fusion of poetry and criti cism" (p. 161). As such, Evangelista adds, Swinburne "pushes the languages of art criticism towards impressionism and abstraction, and argues that the critic should stand aside from common sense, religion, duty, fact, and mo rality, thereby absolving him or her from the need to feel appreciated by the general public" (p. 166). The lack of concern for public opinion expresses Swinburne's view of galleries as "ideal spaces where culture can be imagined free from bourgeois ideology" (p. 179). But more importantly, Swinburne's continuous use of impressionistic and abstract language also results in the breaking down of boundaries between different artistic mediums and the synesthetic collapse of the different senses to which they appeal. Thus his employment of synesthetic imagery throughout his critical work becomes "a signal of critical approval" since, in the Swinburnean context, "synesthesia . .. is always used to link literature to the sensuous experiences of form, color, and sound" (p. 170). Swinburne's synesthetic imagery, Evangelista also shows, appears throughout his poetic work (more specifically, in the 1866 edition of Poems and Ballads), which further solidifies his view of Swinburne as poet critic. The early Swinburne subscribes, therefore, to the Aesthetic notion, championed most vehemently by Pater and Arthur Symons, that considered art criticism to be just as aesthetically pleasing as art. But Evangelista's ar ticle also anticipates, in many respects, Swinburne's later development as a poet and critic, and his tendency to use his poetry as a medium for aesthetic debates. That is, while Swinburne continued to publish his critical prose till the very end of his career, his most interesting critical insights appear in his poetic work. Swinburne's later writings clearly show that he truly managed to actualize the Aesthetic ideal that wished to undo the distinction between the artist and art critic. Elizabeth Helsinger's "Song's Fiction" (Yearbook of English Studies 40, nos. 1-2 [2010]: 141-159) discusses Swinburne and Tennyson's use of generic hybridity in their literary works. According to Heisinger, hybridity can be defined as the employment of two or more literary genres in one work in a way that allows authors to comment on the "most basic but hidden assump tions about language, medium, temporality, or voice" (p. 142). Helsinger's main interest lies in the manner song works to destabilize and problematize verse and prose texts. What makes song such a disruptive element is its physicality as manifested in meter and rhyme, which enables the formation</page><page sequence="66">412 / VICTORIAN POETRY of extra-textual meaning. As Heisinger writes, "the embedded song, with its fictions of embodied performance, reminds us of the otherness of musical space, musical time, and musical thinking—for Tennyson an otherness both desired and feared, for Swnburne a kind of thinking through the body that is potentially tranformative" (pp. 152-153). Swinburne's tendency to think through his body and his ability to make his readers think through their bodies is certainly one of the unique features of his poetry. Thus, while past critics tended to claim that the overwhelming musicality of his verse allowed Swinburne to disguse the fact that his poetic work carried no meaning, more recent critics such as Heisinger have argued that in Swinburne's case meaning is found in sound. Swinburne, in other words, is a performer and his "song poems ask to be imagined as scripts for performance" (p. 158). The effective ness of Swinburne's poetic message depends, therefore, not only on what he says, but also on how he says it. As such, Helsinger's article does Swinburne scholarship an important service by suggesting that viewing his work through a Performance Studies prism may contribute greatly to our understanding of his corpus. It will be interesting to see which direction other scholars are going to take Helsinger's sugestión in the future. In celebration of Swinburne's 2009 centenary, David Latham asks his readers to reconsider their image of the poet ("Shadows Hot from Hell: Swinburne's Poethics," JPRS 18 [Spring 2009]: 5-15). More specifically, Latham tries to reconcile the common view that regards Swinburne as the wild child of Victorian poetry, on the one hand, with the more recent view that ac knowledges his contribution to late-Victorian aesthetic thought, on the other. Swinburne, writes Latham, "lived the first half of his life as the Keith Richards of the Victorian era." But at the same time, he also maintained his commit ment to aesthetic ideals and to "the communal spirit of art envisioned by the Pre-Raphaelites" (p. 5). Latham does not perceive Swinburne's personality and artistic ideology as two conflicting elements: "faced with the l'allegro and il penseroso options that Milton once wrestled with," he writes, "Swinburne managed to conflate the Apollonian scholar with the Dionysian reveller, [and was] able to embody the excessive extremes of both lives at once" (p. 6). According to Latham, Swinburne the scholar and Swinburne the "late-night clubber" (p. 5) simply complemented and informed each other. Latham then turns to discuss some of Swinburne's greatest poetic and aesthetic achieve ments, focusing on his radical view on art (pp. 7-8), innovative prosody (pp. 9-10), and the metaphysical significance he found in the sea as a poetic image (pp. 11-12). In doing so, Latham shows that despite Swinburne's reputation in both Victorian and contemporary popular culture, his abilities as poet and student of poetry define him as an important nineteenth-century figure. Like a real rock star, Swinburne's eccentricities were an integral part of his poetic genius. Indeed, regarding Swinburne as a Jim Morrison or Kurt Cobain may</page><page sequence="67">YISRAEL LEVIN/413 allow us to perceive his behavior (or rather, misbehavior) as an aspect of his creative self. Angela Sorby's article on the nineteenth-century American poet Ella Wheeler Wilcox does not focus on Swinburne, but continuously refers to him as an important influence on Wilcox's poetry ("The Milwaukee School of Fleshly Poetry: Ella Wheeler Wilcox's Poems of Passion and Popular Aestheti cism," Legacy 26, no. 1 [2009]: 69-91). Wilcox's best-selling book of poetry, Poems of Passion, was published in 1883, and, as Sorby informs us, drew "heavily on the popularity of Wilde, and even more heavily on the extravagant style of Algernon Swinburne" (p. 73). Wilcox's style and success, Sorby notes, was the result of a general American fascination with British Aestheticism. "Aestheti cism was attractive to many middle-class Americans," Sorby writes, "because it offered them mobility and a sense that they could act as they wished." As she adds, "whereas British aestheticism was controlled by a coterie of educated upper-class men, Americans embraced aesthetic principles less systematically but more widely" (p. 73). In other words, subscribing to Aestheticism allowed middle-class, Midwestern individuals such as Wilcox to adopt an upper-class image. Wilcox's conscious adoption of Swinburne's poetic style marked her, therefore, as an American aesthete. Sorby draws her readers' attention to the resemblance between Wilcox and Swinburne's poetic language by comparing specific passages and by quoting contemporary critics who commented on Wilcox's work. Poking fun at Wilcox's Midwestern background, Charles A. Dana, editor of the New York Sun, writes about what he terms the "Milwaukee School of fleshly poetry": "as there are centers of atmospheric disturbance so also are there centers of intellectual disorder; just at present the vortex of the aphrodisiac movement in poetry seems to hang over Milwaukee, Wisconsin. We have been astonished by the amount of Swinburnian verse sent to us by different young women living in a town heretofore chiefly celebrated for its bricks and beer" (p. 71). And indeed, Wilcox's Aestheticism was not much more than a facade; "if Wilcox's poems display little learning, they also require little learning: they offer the texture of Swinburne without his challenges" (p. 80). Wilcox's superficial Aestheticism, Sorby writes, was the result of her middle-class background: "the aristocratic Swinburne can afford to devalue everything that the upstart Wilcox desperately overvalues, so that he tends toward irony and she tends toward camp. Their aesthetic styles converge, but Wilcox plays with the very gender and class hierarchies that Swinburne reinscribes, marking the distance between the British literary tradition of aestheticism and its redeployment as an American fad" (p. 76). In other words, the idea of class mobility through the adoption of British Aestheticism was in essence an illusion. Wilcox, Sorby argues, was aware of that; her poetry was not really concerned with adopting Aesthetic ideals as much as it was with the possibility of turning poetry into a commodity. "Poems of Passion,"</page><page sequence="68">414 / VICTORIAN POETRY Sorby writes, "is less about sex than about the specific freedoms and anxiet ies generated by [American] laissez-faire economy that was revaluing not just gold and real estate, but poetry as well" (p. 72). Wilcox's commercial success clearly indicates that poetry can indeed become part of the free market. Sorby's discussion of Wilcox's poetry beautifully shows how certain aesthetic tropes can acquire different significances in different cultural contexts. The only aspect that seems to be missing from her article, however, is the biographical resemblance between Wilcox and Swinburne. As Sorby writes, "beginning with the publication of Poems of Passion in 1883 and continuing through the first decades of the twentieth century, Ella Wheeler Wilcox was quite possibly the most commercially successful and most ridiculed poet in the English speaking world" (p. 69). Wilcox's experience seems to echo Swinburne's own experience following the publication of Poems and Ballads; the young star-poet who published Atalanta in Calydon the previous year soon became the target of public criticism and ridicule. One cannot but wonder, therefore, whether initial success followed by a vehement public rejection is the fate of all aesthetes. Jonathan Bate's "Shakespeare in the Twilight of Romanticism: Wagner, Swinburne, Pater" (Shakespeare Jahrbuch 146 [2010]: 11-25) reviews differ ent European artists' reading of Shakespeare, and discusses the manner in which his works inspired and influenced the development of their politics and aesthetics. Starting with Goethe, Bate defines Shakespeare as a source of inspiration for many German Romantic thinkers who found him to of fer an alternative to French neo-classicism. Shakespeare, he writes, became "a weapon in the hand of those fighting against French cultural hegemony in the name of an emergent German linguistic and cultural consciousness" (p. 11). Goethe's ideas, Bate informs us, were later adopted by Herder and Wagner, who saw in Shakespeare's historical plays and celebration of the English language a manifestation of British nationalism. Next, Bate discusses Giuseppe Mazzini, the Italian Republican, whose politics were partly inspired by Wagnerian Romanticism, and who was a great political influence on the young Swinburne. Not surprisingly, Swinburne's 1866 edition of Poems and Ballads invokes German Romantic nationalism. As Bate writes, "Swinburne's revolutionary volume of 1866 ... in which the lead poem was 'Laus Veneris,' his version of the Tannhäuser myth, was a kind of manifesto for a 'Young England' movement. . . . Notoriously, the collection was replete with poems in praise of republicanism, anti-clericalism, and free love" (p. 20). Swinburne can be perceived, therefore, as part of a poetic-political legacy that starts with German Romantics reading of Shakespeare, then continues with Mazzini's Republicanism, and eventually finds its manifestation in Swinburne's radical poetry. At the same time, however, Swinburne's actual reading of Shake speare has always been deliberately a-political. "One little-remarked aspect of Swinburne's radicalism," Bate writes, "was his desire to imagine Shakespeare</page><page sequence="69">LINDÁK. HUGHES/ 415 without nationalism." In fact, the main emphasis of Swinburne's colossal A Study of Shakespeare (1880) "was upon Shakespeare's metrical development as an aid to questions of attribution and chronology" (p. 20). As such, Bate adds later, "Swinburne complicates the Victorian image of patriotic Shakespeare" (p. 21). Bate, however, does not really try to resolve the conflict between his two perceptions of Swinburne: on the one hand, he considers Swinburne the product of a European, political reading of Shakespeare; yet on the other hand, he views Swinburne as a consciously a-political scholar of Shakespeare. Perhaps what may explain this discrepancy is a closer look into Swinburne's own relation with French culture. Unlike Goethe and the German Romantics, Swinburne never regarded French culture to be limiting in its classicism; on the contrary, French art was one of Swinburne's main sources of inspiration as a poet. Thus Bate's attempt to associate Swinburne's Republicanism with German Romantic politics seems a bit odd. Indeed, Swinburne's political views (at least during the first half of his poetic career) were nothing but Romantic, but Goethe and his contemporaries' reading of Shakespeare did not have much to do with them. Finally, I would like to mention two online resources that are supposed to become available later this year or early next year. John Walsh's The Swinburne Project has been going through a process of expansion and will include an electronic version of the complete Chatto &amp;. Windus 1904 edition of The Poems of Algernon Charles Swinburne in six volumes, as well as a significant addition to Terry L. Meyers' Uncollected Letters. In addition, Georgetown University's library will be making the John S. Mayfield notes and paper on Swinburne available online. An easy access to one of the most important collections of Swinburne materials will certainly be an invaluable contribution to future Swinburne scholarship. Tennyson LINDA Κ. HUGHES The work on Tennyson published in 2010, including two books and numerous essays, addresses issues of genre, biography, literary history, cultural memory, and visuality. In "Form Things: Looking at Genre through Victorian Diamonds" (Victorian Studies 52, no. 4: 591-619), Stephanie Markovits inte grates thing theory and neoformalism, noting that genre can function both as thing and abstract form. Diamonds, which bespeak narratives (of imperial capture, slow natural processes, commercial exchange) yet also signify the im materialities of beauty or love, usefully focus generic impasses in Idylls of the</page><page sequence="70">416 / VICTORIAN POETRY King. The Idylls' aspiration toward epic form runs athwart episodes linked not by causal relationships but by lyric similitude. Yet the poem does not sustain lyric intensity, apart from such moments when Guinevere casts diamonds into the stream just as the dead Elaine, an authentic figure of diamond-like truth and fidelity, passes by—all of which suggests the impossibility of Tennyson's own inventive but unstable generic project. Whether Markovits' model ap plies equally to works that feature no diamonds but likewise incorporate lyric and narrative, as with "Tears, Idle Tears," is left unclear (see Heisinger below for an alternative approach). But Markovits' essay, like her subject, intrigues with its many facets. Though Tennyson played a slight role in the special issue of VP on the sonnet (ed. Marianne van Remoortel and Marysa Demoor), Valentine Cunningham contributes a fine essay on the sonnets of Tennyson's brother: "Charles (Tennyson) Turner and the Power of the Small Poetic Thing" (VP 48, no. 4: 509-521). Turner's sonnets self-consciously announce their invest ment in small things not only in form but also subject—small animals, little girls, little England. But Cunningham reverses customary critical connections between modest scale and Turner's self-effacement relative to his laureate brother to probe the sonnets' ambition, which often depict the power of a small thing to envelop and even overwhelm vast reaches of time and space, whether a pocket watch capturing, then redirecting rays of the setting sun onto the landscape or little England subduing large tracts of the globe. Two essays probing the status of Shakespeare's sonnets in the nineteenth century are useful for the light these cast on In Memóriám. Rhian Williams ("'Pyramids of Egypt': Shakespeare's Sonnets and A Victorian Turn to Obscurity" [VP 48, no. 4: 489-508]) notes the impasse posed by Shakespeare for predominant expressive models of poetry, since his sonnets implied either deviant sexuality or a flawed icon of national identity. Robert Matz's fascinating "The Scandals of Shakespeare's Sonnets" (ELH 77, no. 2: 477-508) assembles compelling evidence that Shakespeare's "scandal" for nineteenth-century readers was less same-sex than adulterous desire (in contrast to post-Freudian, twentieth century audiences that saw in robust heterosexual randiness expressions of health). Matz backs up his assertion that male romantic friendship remained an honorific operative ideal for Victorians with evidence from Wordsworth and Arnold, whose schoolboy commentary at Rugby lauded Shakespeare's sonnets on these very grounds. Henry Hallam's oft-quoted wish that Shakespeare had never written the sonnets, Matz suggests, may derive less from the speaker's expression of affection for a young man than the prospect of a middle-class poet abasing himself before a noble patron. Other scholars explored the relation of Tennyson to song and sound in 2010. Elizabeth Heisinger provides a superb analysis of song's function when it is embedded in lyric or narrative poetry in "Song's Fictions" (Yearbook of English</page><page sequence="71">LINDA Κ. HUGHES/417 Studies: The Arts in Victorian Literature, ed. Stefano Evangelista and Catherine Maxwell [Maney Publishing], pp. 141-159). Simultaneously theorizing and closely reading the effects of embedded song in Tennyson and Swinburne, Heisinger suggests that song functions both as meta-commentary and as em bodied immediacy of performance. Thus song instates an alternative order of space and time in "Tears, Idle Tears," bringing the past into the present and forestalling the future, which is precisely why the forward-looking Ida rejects the song's performance. If song's entrancing immediacy can seduce, as when Merlin loses himself in Vivien's song and becomes her victim, song also has the performative power to forge community. Indeed, Heisinger reads song in the Idylls as a counterpart to and trope for Arthur's laws, which can through repetitions, aural harmonies, ability to merge the real and ideal, and commu nal integration bring a new order into being but is—like all song—inherently unsustainable in time. Jane Wright, in "Sincerity's Repetition: Carlyle, Tennyson and Other Repetitive Victorians" (Romanticism, Sincerity and Authenticity, ed. Tim Milnes and Kerry Sinanan [Palgrave Macmillan], pp. 162-181), suggests that Ten nyson's insistent repetitions in his verbal music become so obvious that the style becomes sincere, openly avowing its workings to the reader and thereby inviting trust. Angela Leighton's memorable lecture on "Tennyson's Hum" at the 2009 bicentenary conference in Lincoln can now be revisited in the Tennyson Research Bulletin (TRB 9, no. 4: 315-329). She elucidates the distinc tive undersong or "hum" that is both residue of and aural diapason within Tennyson's poetry. This distinctive effect, Leighton suggests, is the sound of Tennyson listening to what he hears in the act of creating poems, which is registered in his repetitions (often chiastic) that perform an articulation and then a listening to that articulation, or in speakers who are often distracted from immediate surroundings to listen to what is far away (as in The Lover's Tale, of which Leighton provides an elegant exegesis). Clara Dawson also takes up the undersong or hum of deep lyric subjectivity that only the poet can hear ("Ά Tale of Little Meaning': The Mind's Ear in Tennyson's Early Poetry" [Tennyson Rresearch Bulletin 9, no. 4: 356-363]) but focuses on how that subjectivity turns toward finding an audience by translating what he (or his imagined character) hears into communicable meaning. In "The Mermaid" the speaker compares her song to a golden fountain with an inner sound, trans lating sound into a visual image that secures an audience (the sea creatures) and thereby confers meaning on her song. The rift between the lotos-eating mariners' inward song and their claim to hear the island's sounds poses the question whether poetry originates in the poet or in the world and juxtaposes competing acts and ethics of listening. Francis O'Gorman re-enlivens poetry's connection to the novel in "What is Haunting Tennyson's Maud (1855)?" (VP 48, no. 3: 293-311). O'Gorman</page><page sequence="72">418 / VICTORIAN POETRY suggests that In Memóriám shares features of the gothic novel insofar as it never dissociates living spirit from decomposing material remains of the beloved dead and repeatedly considers how, and in what form, the dead might revisit the living. If In Memóriám dramatizes in Section 95 the realized possibility of the dead returning to the living, O'Gorman considers Maud a project that enabled Tennyson to distance himself from the famous elegy that threatened to overshadow his career and, in the face of spiritualism's increasing popu larity, subvert any suggestion that we can summon the dead. O'Gorman's compelling reading of the madhouse scene, in which the buried man strives vainly to speak to the living and is assailed by the dead's ceaseless chatter, as a nightmarish, demythologizing version of the dead's return in In Memóriám reinforces his revisionary account of the two poems' relation. John Morton's Tennyson Among the Novelists (Continuum) explores in fiction from Tennyson's time to our own two forms of Tennyson's literary afterlife: allusion as defined by Christopher Ricks and Robert Douglas Fairhurst (i.e., intrinsic to another artist's invention of new meaning) and reception that registers Tennyson's critical standing. Prime examples of al lusion include Elizabeth Gaskell's echo of In Memóriám to register Margaret Hale's parallel sorrow in leaving her Helstone garden in North and South or Leopold Bloom's inward thought during a concert about the "rift within the lute" from Tennyson's Idylls just when his wife is having an affair with Blazes Boylan in James Joyce's Ulysses. Predominantly, however, Morton charts the reception of Tennyson in fiction, making us realize, for example, how surpris ingly often D. H. Lawrence quotes Tennyson, and proving along the way how deeply embedded Tennyson remains in cultural memory. The last three (of nine) chapters have the additional merit of functioning as a resource book for Neovictorian courses or reading lists. I wish that an editorial hand had intervened, however, to prevent the recurrent reference to A. S. Byatt's novella as The Conjugal rather than Conjugial Angel or the assertion that Hardy pub lished no poetry before Queen Victoria's death (despite Wessex Poems, 1898). Morton lacks space to follow up on the implications of many of his details, but his study is a compendium of fascinating literary traces of Tennyson, who turns up in some very unexpected places indeed. Morton justly terms the novel of Adam Foulds, The Quickening Maze (U.K., 2009; U.S. 2010 [Penguin]) "the most believable" and "least caricatured fictional representation of the poet" to date (Morton, p. 149). If the novel principally explores the fine line between madness and sanity in the paired obsessions of poet John Clare and his keeper Dr. Matthew Allen, proprietor of the High Beach asylum, Foulds also deftly pairs Allen and Tennyson in relation to the monomaniacal drives that propel creativity and an almost physical need to be recognized for it. The "dirty monk" side of Tennyson is humorously, even malodorously, brought before readers, but Foulds, himself</page><page sequence="73">LINDA Κ. HUGHES/ 419 a poet, also dares fictional representations of Tennyson's moments of creative invention, here in terms that suggest "Break, break, break": "The forest dies into itself, growing, shapes fading, eaten, lengthening anew. Yes, yes. And thought, the unbreaking wave, constantly changing—colours, shapes, sinuously pouring towards the world, pushing with language" (pp. 25-26). Foulds knows Tennyson biography well and musters details that many Tennyson scholars will find pleasure in recognizing; best of all are moments in which Foulds imagines the poet's inward responses that scholarship can never recover, as when, listening to a Sunday sermon by Allen, Tennyson mentally compares it to his father's Somersby sermons, prompting us to think anew what that weekly experience must have been like for the adolescent son. The Palgrave Literary Dictionary of Tennyson (Palgrave Macmillan) by Valerie Purton and Norman Page include full entries on Tennyson's father, his library, and even his doctor, Dr. Bousfield. It is an immensely useful reference work that functions as a dictionary proper for place names and people (with ample cross references) and as headnotes for individual poems and volumes, often spiced with the editors' judgments of Tennyson's success (they have reserva tions about "The Ancient Sage" but mount sprightly defenses of Tennyson's narrative poetry and his late lyrics such as "Roses on the Terrace"). It is learned and useful, worth dipping into as well as directing students to it, though the entry on periodicals is incomplete and Gawain's ghostly appearance to Ar thur on the eve before the final battle is oddly traced to Shakespeare rather than Malory. No entry appears on William and Mary Howitt, who enjoyed a warm friendship with Tennyson in the later 1840s, and Emily Ritchie is twice named but never identified. But these are exceptions to the compilers' thorough coverage. Emily Ritchie, cousin and sister-in-law to Annie Thackeray Ritchie, is the focus of John Aplin's Tennyson Society Monograph 'The Greatest Honour of My Life': Emily Ritchie's Recollections of Tennyson. Aplin located a typescript of Ritchie's record of Tennyson's conversation as part of his work on the Thackeray family papers and reproduces it here, prefaced by a deft memoir of Ritchie herself. Haliam Tennyson (for whom Ritchie may have harbored romantic longings) evidently mined the record of Tennyson's remarks for the Memoir, which makes any new materials of special interest. The most interesting to me were Tennyson's more vehement repudiation of eternal punishment—"St Augustin's descriptions of unbaptised infants crawling in everlasting torture revolts any mind of the present day. Rather than believe in a Deity who could call things into existence and then inflict upon them, no matter how innocent or guilty, such horrible torments eternally, I would say Damn God!!" (p. 16)—or his remark that Dr. Tennyson "held Unitarian views" about the trinity (p. 19). Tennyson's place in a wider literary history also received recurring</page><page sequence="74">420 / VICTORIAN POETRY attention in 2010. Robert Douglas-Fairhurst perforce covers some familiar ground in his chapter "Tennyson: Still Life" (The Cambridge History of English Poetry, ed. Michael O'Neill [Cambridge University Press]), but does so with customary elegance and penetrating discernment. He focuses on telling details that imbue Tennyson's poetry with resurgent vitality in the midst of representa tions of entropy or stasis, as in the restless after-mutterings of feminine rhymes ("chilly," "tiger-lily") in the terminal stanza-lines of "A Spirit Haunts the Year's Last Hours." Douglas-Fairhurst also notes the effect of Tennyson's stating that "some one" had blundered in "Charge of the Light Brigade," which singles out without naming rather than resorting to the impersonal, guilt-evading "someone." Richard Cronin sensibly avers that there is no unifying style in "Victorian Poetry: An Overview" in the same volume, though noting the recurring themes of self-consciousness, inward divisions, belatedness, and antipathy to commodification. Cronin reprises some of his lively remarks from last year on Tennyson and nonsense verse in a section on children's verse. But Cronin ends on a note of Arnoldian melancholy, suggesting that the one thing all Victorian poets knew, no matter their style or ideology, was that poetry no longer occupied a central place in the world. This is a view I question in The Cambridge Introduction to Victorian Poetry (Cambridge Univ. Press), which emphasizes the broad audience poetry found through widely circulating periodicals, reprints, and other forms of mass-circulation print cul ture. Part I focuses on form, Part II on poets' dialogues about a range of issues; and Tennyson figures prominently in chapters on Victorian experimentalism (The Princess, Maud), science (In Memóriám, Maud, "Lucretius"), and empire (Idylls) as well as making brief appearances throughout. In "London: Capital of the Nineteenth Century" (New Literary History 41, no. 1: 111-128), Evan Horowitz contributes a fascinating intervention in transnational, not merely British, literary history. Horowitz convincingly argues that for Baudelaire London, not Paris (pace Walter Benjamin) represented modernity, as indicated by his importation of the specifically English word "spleen" as a defining symptom of modern alienation and by his "plagiats" from English poetry reworked to new effect. Tennyson's "it seemed always afternoon" ("The Lotos-Eaters," 1. 4) resurfaces in Baudelaire's "Le Voyage" ("après-midi qui n'a jamais de fin!"), but "Ulysses," Horowitz suggests, inspired the structure of Baudelaire's poem, since the Frenchman read Ulysses' obses sion with continuous voyaging as a trope of that "uniquely modern form of perversity called progress" (p. 119). One implication of Horowitz's revised literary history is that "Ulysses" might now profitably be reread in relation to "Locksley Hall." Parvin Loloi also tracks transnational literary history in "Hafiz and the Language of Love in Nineteenth-Century English and American Poetry" (Hafiz and the Religion of Love in Classical Persian Poetry, ed. Leonard Lewisohn [I. B. Tauris]). Loloi makes the case that Tennyson's own interest</page><page sequence="75">LINDÁK. HUGHES/ 421 in Persian and the poetry of Hafiz (a factor in the representation of ecstatic love in The Princess, "The Gardener's Daughter," "The Day Dream," "The Vi sion of Sin," "Akbar's Dream," In Memóriám, and The Lover's Tale) derives less from Sir William Jones than Goethe, whose own West-östlicher Divan (1819) was made possible by the translation into German of Hafiz's The Divan by Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall (1812-1813). John Holmes reassesses Tennyson's Romantic and classical heritage in "The Ionian Father: Tennyson and Homer" (Tennyson Research Bulletin 9 no. 4: 330-347), arguing forcefully that Tennyson worked out his response to Romanticism and its legacy of transformative imagination through his classi cal poems. The defining issue of Tennyson's early poetry inspired by Homer ("The Sea-Fairies," "The Lotos-Eaters," "The Hesperides"), Holmes suggests, is the threefold temptation of self-indulgent pleasure in idyllic nature, freedom from toil, and poetry as its own end. The narrative frames attached to the earliest classical poems register Tennyson's ambivalence about the imagination then unloosed in their narratives. Only in "Ulysses" does Tennyson enact the role of Romantic poet, a point confirmed in readers' long identification with the protagonist's resistance to mortal bounds and adherence to a high heroic ideal even though Ulysses is himself assigned the role of tempter who induces mariners to leave home for the joys of unending exploration. Holmes shores up his identification of Ulysses as tempter by freshly exploring accepted sources of the poem. In Dante's Inferno Ulysses never arrives home to begin with, since the desire to keep sailing overwhelms the mariners' desire for reunion; and in Book 14 of the Odyssey, when Odysseus meets his swineherd Eumaeus and denigrates the comforts of home relative to the delights of battle and voyaging, he is lying, pretending to be the illegitimate son of a nobleman. Tennyson's assumption of the Romantic mantle in "Ulysses" is thus atypical, and in "Tithon" Tennyson bid farewell to the Romantic poet he might have become, enacting his conclusion that the realm of the infinite is not suited to humankind and that it is better not "To vary from his kind" ("Tithon," 1. 21). "Ulysses" figures very differently in Emily C. Bartels' "Outside the Box: Surviving Survival" (Literature and Medicine 28, no. 2 [2009]: 237-252), one of several essays approaching Tennyson in terms of public or cultural memory. If Bartels' ultimate purpose is to probe the ontology of the cancer survivor (not ill, but often essentialized in a state of non-cure), she also critiques the misreading of "Ulysses" by Dr. Jerri Nielsen in Icebound: A Doctor's Incredible Battle for Survival of the South Pole (2001), which takes its epigraph from the poem (11. 6-12). If Nielsen embraces Ulysses' heroic potential but ignores his retreat into nostalgia after line 12, Bartels contends that the poem's central dramatic conflict is not domestic duty versus heroic questing but two forms of inauthenticity, an attempt to reenter a past forever closed versus unwilling ness to come to terms with a limited present. In this reading, the poem—as</page><page sequence="76">422 / VICTORIAN POETRY Tennyson said—is precisely about the need to move forward. Religion and memory intersect in Julia Courtney's '"The Kraken': Aunt Bourne, and the End of the World" (Tennyson Research Bulletin 9, no. 4: 348 355) and Devon Fisher's "The Becoming Character of Tennyson's Simeon Stylites" (VP 48, no. 3: 313-326). Courtney concurs with Gerhard Joseph's psychoanalytic reading of "The Kraken" as an exploration of coming into voice, but she argues that Tennyson's memory of his Aunt's Calvinist eschatology, post-Napoleonic millenarianism, and developments in marine biology of the 1820s and 1830s also figure in the poem's representation of an apocalyptic marine birth that is a death. Drawing upon the rhetorical theory of Paul Ricoeur, Fisher approaches "St. Simeon Stylites" less in terms of Simeon's subjectivity than a poem exploring how a fixed character (for example, of a saint) becomes permanently impressed upon cultural memory. The answer lies in the force of a public narrative imposed upon perhaps groundless facts rather than through verifiable facts themselves. Such a realization had pro found effects, Fisher argues, on Tennyson's subsequent career, as he sought to craft narratives that would allow, variously, Arthur Henry Haliam, the Duke of Wellington, Prince Albert, and King Arthur to enter public memory as exem plars of cultural ideals that helped (as did saints' lives) secure social cohesion. Aaron Yale Heisler ("The English Destiny of Tennyson's Camelot," Philological Quarterly 88, nos. 1-2 [2009]: 151-170) argues that the linguistic memory embedded in the opening lines of "The Coming of Arthur" foretells Arthur's inevitable doom, since their shift from primarily Anglo-Saxon words (king, daughter, other, child, fairest, flesh, earth) to "delight," derived from the romance languages—and glancing toward the female principle—recapitulates the entire history of a Celtic romance hero giving way to an English identity forged from an Anglo-Saxon and then Norman French conquest. Jonah Siegel's "Display Time: Art, Disgust, and the Returns of the Crystal Palace" (pp. 33-60) is another fine essay in the 2010 Yearbook of Eng lish Studies cited above. Siegel filters a complex, multi-layered consideration of modernity, memory, periodicity, and commodification through Tenny son's "The Palace of Art," the Crystal Palace in its original and Sydenham versions, and the theorizing of cultural memory and museums by Ruskin, Walter Benjamin, and others. Written before the nation had a "palace" for the permanent display of art, Tennyson's poem anticipates and embodies a specifically modern orientation toward art; even if ethical issues resulting from the Soul's appropriation of godlike power ends the Soul's initial residence, "The Palace of Art" enunciates the possibility of return that is intrinsic to the modern museum. Among the essays collected in Lorraine Janzen Kooistra's special issue of VP [48, no. 1] devoted to "Victorian Poetry and the Book Arts," Tennyson is a recurring point of reference but a sustained presence only in "Palms and</page><page sequence="77">ALISON CHAPMAN / 423 Temples: Edward Lear's Topographies" (pp. 73-94) by the late Richard Maxwell. If like Anna Barton in 2009 Maxwell takes up the counterpointed narratives of Lear's Journal of a Landscape Painter in Albania, &amp;c. (1851) and Tennyson's "To E.L., on His Travels in Greece" (1853), Maxwell discerns a less contesta tory relation between them. For if Tennyson effaces Lear's humor, he tacitly pays tribute to the power of Lear's book to transport him (in a double sense): "I turned the page/ And tracked you still" (11. 9Ί0). But Maxwell's principal focus is on Lear's projected book "Landscape Illustrations of Tennyson," which generated 200 artworks but never reached publication due to Lear's divided aims of documenting the vivid fidelity of Tennyson's pictorial details and executing sketches inspired by Tennyson's suggestive details (for example, the glimmering optical effects contingent on a day's cycle) after the manner of J.M.W. Turner's Liber Studiorum. Maxwell's account gains greater poignancy from the knowledge that Maxwell himself had begun a book-length project on travel narratives and landscape evocations but was prevented by cancer from completing it. Cancer claimed another fine Tennyson scholar in June 2011, with the sad and untimely passing of A. A. Markley, author of Stateliest Measures: Tennyson and the Literature of Greece and Rome (2004). Women Poets ALISON CHAPMAN 2010 has been notable for the attention given to Amy Levy, the bold, technically accomplished and politically radical late-nineteenth-century poet, essayist, short-story writer, and novelist. Naomi Hetherington and Nadia Val man's edited collection Arrvy Levy: Critical Essays, is an excellent contribution to the resurgence of interest in Levy (see, for example, Linda Hunt Beckman's Amy Levy: Her Life and Letters [Athens: Ohio Univ. Press, 2000], and Susan David Bernstein's 2006 Broadview editions of Levy's novels Reuben Sachs and The Romance of a Shop). The essays as a whole challenge and complicate Levy's relationship to Judaism and the tendency to read her work and life through her tragic suicide. Contributors circle around several important topics: Levy as an Anglo-Jewish novelist; Levy as a New Woman poet; Levy as an urban writer; and Levy's social, cultural, and professional networks. The collection aims to recover the literary contexts to her writing and addresses all the genres in which she wrote (including novels, short stories, essays, poetry, and cor respondence). Many chapters draw on the rich and fascinating material in the privately owned Beth-Zion Abrahams collection of Amy Levy material. Of particular concern for contributors to the collection are her relation to femi</page><page sequence="78">424 / VICTORIAN POETRY nist politics and scientific discourse, and the critical reconfiguration of Levy's complex sense of her own identity. Overall, the collection raises the profile of Levy's writing as a major force in the intellectual milieu of late-century Britain. The editors provide a compelling introduction, arguing for a multi faceted approach to Amy Levy that embraces her complex and sometimes contradictory intellectual, political, and literary influences. In addition, the selected bibliography gives a useful list of works by Levy, including a selection of those published in periodicals, and a selection of important reception mate rial. Three essays in particular will interest Victorian Poetry readers. Firstly, T. D. Olverson's '"Such Are Not Woman's Thoughts': Amy Levy's 'Xantippe' and 'Medea'" (pp. 110-131), which focuses on two of her most discussed poems as key points in the development of Levy's thought. Olverson argues that the dramatic monologue "Xantippe" and the closet drama "Medea" engage with Hellenism for political effect. Levy's Hellenism is presented in terms of recent critical debate that positions late-Victorian women as moving into the classics (rather than being excluded by it) as a way to challenge their contemporary culture. The essay presents the importance of Plato's Symposium to "Xantippe" as well as to Victorian debates about the Woman Question: "Levy's poem challenges not only the masculine values of antiquity but also the contemporary male writers and philosophers who threatened to reinstate and thereby culturally legitimize the same elitist and prejudicial attitudes in Victorian England" (p. 118). Olverson sees in Xantippe a provocative chal lenge to Plato's and Socrates' view of women and the intellectual sphere, even as it underlines Levy's own exclusion from male discourse, a discourse which women must learn in order to change. Xantippe, a "figure of angry protest"—leads to Levy's next development in her Hellenism, the closet drama "Medea." This classical figure, "disavowed and disenfranchised," allows Levy "to articulate her anxieties concerning her Anglo-Jewish identity and her feminist beliefs" (p. 122). While the broad strokes of this reading are in harmony with other critiques of Levy, Olverson is significant for the specific contexts of the Victorian interest in Medea (pp. 124-125) and especially the relation between Medea and Jewish immigration into England. The essay, in addition, demonstrates how Levy appropriates the racial terminology of the Austrian playwright Franz Grillparzer to engage in debate about Jewishness and national identity: "Medea's social isolation and eventual exile suggest the difficulty of maintaining a diasporic identity in the face of a (seemingly) hegemonic culture" (p. 128). Ultimately, this argument finds that Levy remy thologizes Medea into a pessimistic ending as the only way to demythologize: "Levy's Hellenistic poems can therefore be read not only as cautionary tales concerning the disavowed and disenfranchised but also as forward-looking contributions in revisionist mythmaking" (p. 130). Olverson is finely attuned to the complexities and contradictions in Levy's Hellenism, while also trying</page><page sequence="79">ALISON CHAPMAN / 425 to read it in a positive humanist light, just as Levy treats Medea in a humanist spirit, without the deus ex machina of Euripides. Alex Goody's essay, "Passing in the City: The Liminal Spaces of Amy Levy's Late Work" (pp. 157-179), is theoretically engaged, employing a feminist Deleuzian approach and also exploring the psychoanalytical implications of "passing." The analysis concentrates on identity and its contradictions, giving some nuanced readings of A London Plane Tree, and diverging from recent critical work on Levy and the city by seeing more ambivalence to urban mo dernity. Like Olverson's contribution, this essay is welcome for its unraveling of problems and contradictions in Levy, and for opening out Levy's range of concerns by relating her work to the modernists. There is also some interesting discussion of Levy's relation with Baudelaire, rather than James Thomson, to whom she is more often compared. The third essay to address poetry, "Verse or Vitality? Biological Economies and the New Woman Poet" (pp. 198-220) by Lyssa Randolph, compares discourses about gender and biology in Amy Levy and Constance Naden. In particular, the critique focuses on the late-Victorian understanding of female poetic genius, especially in relation to representa tions of Levy's and Naden's deaths in 1889, and how misogynistic accounts of the poets are challenged in the feminist press. This is fascinating material for its account of how critics grappled with Levy's pessimism and suicide and her departure from the female expressive tradition of women's poetry. The associations between biology, poetic creativity, and women's relation to power are compelling. The collection ends with an Afterword by Mari-Jane Rochelson, who makes some important points about Levy's relation to a traditional canon that, until recently, was mostly based on white Christian British men. In particular, while Rochelson acknowledges the accessibility of Levy's writing through recent critical editions and biographies, and its central ity to Victorian studies, she also remarks that Levy's "centrality resides in her marginal position" (p. 223). Hetherington and Valman s edited collection of essays consolidates Levy as a rich, nuanced, and complex writer who was actively part of impor tant intellectual networks and debates, thus challenging the conventional retrospective reading of her work through the lens of her tragic suicide while also being attuned to Levy's overt sense of displacement. My only hesitation about the collection overall is its implicit assertion of generic boundaries (not uncommon, of course, in Victorian studies), in the arguably artificial if not anachronistic separation of discussion of Levy's poetry from her prose. As women's poetry begun to be positioned centrally to Victorian studies from the 1980s, treating poetry as implicitly removed from prose was perhaps a defensible critical strategy to recover and privilege the genre. It may be time, however, for Victorianists to reconsider such a strategy, especially in light of Isobel Armstrong's recent comments for Victorian Poetry Network ("The Long</page><page sequence="80">426 / VICTORIAN POETRY Nineteenth Century: Where Have All the Women Poets Gone?" (http:// web.uvic.ca/ vicpoet/2011/01/the-long-nineteenth-century-where-have-the women-poets-gone/) about what she sees as the failure of the feminist recovery of nineteenth-century women poets, the origin of which she blames on the political move to treat them as a separate tradition from men's poetry, which raises a wider concern: the conventional critical premise, so pervasive that it is rarely even acknowledged, that separates Victorian women's poetry from other genres, including those by women. Criticism of women's poetry is, however, beginning to embrace the wider generic and contextual fabric of Victorian literature and culture. Indeed, several critics covered in this review are already moving towards a more holistic and inclusive reading of women's poetry. Another important contribution to Levy studies is the new biography by Christine Pullen, The Woman Who Dared. This carefully researched, lively account draws heavily on manuscript material and (contra Hetherington and Valman) charts Levy's intellectual and emotional life through emphasis upon her suicide from the outset, organizing the material around that moment. Pullen's biography is extremely valuable for its excavation of Levy's late-century context. Two of the major organizing motifs are Levy's desire to be financially and socially independent from her parents, with her simultaneous struggle with her parents' desire to conform to Victorian middle-class values, and her desire to maintain artistic integrity while also meeting the demands of the literary marketplace. Levy's European and British travel is uncovered as crucial to her development as a writer, as are the circles she cultivates through the reading room in the British Museum and the daring "Men and Women's Club." Of special interest to Pullen is Levy's unhappy friendship with Karl Pearson and his political and philosophical influence: in fact, Pullen directly blames Levy's suicide on her devastation at what she saw as Pearson's romantic betrayal, an interpretation that is controversial if intriguing. This biography is full of gems for the poetry scholar, such as its suggestive connections between Levy and Christina Rossetti (reading Levy's "Magdalen" alongside Rossetti's interest in sexual fallenness, her work for the Highgate Penitentiary, and her support for the 1883 petition to raise the age of consent and arguing that Levy challenges her precursor by treating Magdalen as a blameless victim [pp. 74-78]). Levy's important friendships with Dolly Radford, Mary F. Robinson, and Vernon Lee are also covered. Last year was also notable for a cluster of interest around another ac complished late-century woman poet, novelist, and critic, Mary Elizabeth Coleridge. Kasey Bass Baker's essay "Oh, lift me over the threshold, and let me in at the door!': Boundaries and Thresholds in Mary Coleridge's Poetry," published in the Summer 2010 issue of this journal, offers an important new reading of the much-discussed poem "The Witch," based on previously unpublished manuscript material in Eton College Library. The essay also</page><page sequence="81">ALISON CHAPMAN/ 427 addresses Robert Bridges' comments to the poem and Coleridge's revisions. Especially interesting is Coleridge's removal of quotation marks in a later version of "The Witch," erasing a firm distinction between the two voices in the poem: "she was evidently working to create this threshold moment, when we recognize a shift in voice" (p. 196). In an engagement with other critics who have explored Coleridge's fascination with boundaries, Baker offers a new analysis, arguing that Coleridge's poetry welcomes the moment when boundaries become thresholds (for example, suggesting that Coleridge invites her precursor and namesake's poem "Christabel" into her poem): "Coleridge experiments with poetry in order to portray these precarious moments when two subjectivities converge in mutual self-consciousness, an aesthetic and personal act she initiates and desires" (p. 200). In addition, Baker unfolds Coleridge's shifting poetics, arguing that "Coleridge's letters reveal that her poetry results from her experiences in a network of relationships she has created. She constantly modifies, re-creates, and negates her poetic identity through masks like 'Anodos' and through the poetic re-writings that her network produced" (p. 196). More sophisticated than a traditional biographi cal reading of Coleridge, this approach explores what critics have taken to be her secretive lesbian relationships as central to her poetic development and, Baker argues (endorsing Sharon Marcus), normative and not secret at all. If that is the case, however, why the secrecy, coyness and mystery around Coleridge's relationships and networks, something she and her later friends and memoirists cultivate? Baker acknowledges as much when she says: "If she did indeed understand her work as the product of a network of relationships and experiences, her central concern seems to be to tuck the poems in their contexts in the privacy of such networks, allowing future readers to hear only the echoes" (pp. 214). This contradiction might be fruitfully explored through the logic of the open secret, but in any case there remains a tension between understanding Coleridge's sense of poetic and personal identity, and in the end the poetry's shifting voices may frustrate any contextualization. Although the debate about the relation between Coleridge's life and her enigmatic poetry will continue, Baker's contribution is a fresh, original critical voice, and she offers a significant reinterpretation of a key poem based on some admirable archival material that has passed previous scholars by. Another very welcome contribution to raising Coleridge s profile is Simon Avery's selected edition of her poems, published by Shearsman Books (which, like Kingston Univ. Press, should be congratulated for its bold com mitment to promoting lesser-known Victorian women poets). This edition is very much a selection, presenting 90 of her almost 250 poems, and point ing to the shame that her complete poems, as well as reviews (especially her prominent reviews for the Times Literary Supplement), are not readily accessible in a modern critical edition. Nevertheless, Avery's edition is a good start. The</page><page sequence="82">428 / VICTORIA Ν POETRY text for the poems is taken from the first published volume edition and, for posthumously published poems, Henry Newbolt's Poems by Mary E. Coleridge (1908). Avery's introduction provides insightful biographical and important contextual background, which makes this edition especially attractive for teaching. Sharp in his assessment of Coleridge, Avery sees her as supremely contemporary and deeply interested in debates about art, theatre, science, psychology, and education, thus countering previous critics who have claimed that Coleridge is conservative and disengaged with political radicalism. Avery cites Sally Ledger's work on the New Woman to point out that late-century feminism took many different forms, and he cites Ledger's telling phrase that Coleridge was "nothing if not modern" (p. 13), exemplified, he argues, in Coleridge's choice to remain single, in her autodidacticism, and her cultivation of a professional writing identity within literary London. The introduction offers a reading of a range of Coleridge's poems that are usually sidelined for the more riddling and allusive Gothic poetry, uncovering their important contemporary contexts. This is a valuable selected edition, presenting a fresh approach to Coleridge's poetry, and it will hopefully attract more interest in the importance of Coleridge to the landscape of late-nineteenth-century poetry. Other women poets who have enjoyed renewed attention include George Eliot, whose poems are of course usually neglected in favor of her prose. In a powerful, innovative essay, Kyriaki Hadjiafxendi discusses Eliot's poetry in light of her literary career, especially her sense of professionalism. Hadjiafxendi focuses on the cultural politics of the poetic voice in the light of George Eliot's participation in the masculinized world of periodical print, arguing that she explores the gendering of artistic labor through the figure of the voice ('"George Eliot,' the Literary Market-Place and Sympathy," in Authorship in Context: From the Theoretical to the Material [Palgrave Macmillan, 2007]). The essay concentrates on the important poem "Erinna," about the Greek poet who died after being chained by her mother to a spinning wheel at the age of nineteen. The poem is read alongside Eliot's crucial essay about the seventeenth-century salonnière, "Woman in France: Madame de Sablé," which "contrasts the patriarchy of the modern publishing industry with the mixed-gender intellectual conversations of de Sablé's literary salon in the 1640s and 1650s" (p. 99). Eliot makes problematic the feminine ideal in terms of the domestication of female labor, deploying the trope of the voice to question the distinctions between amateur, professional, and domestic work. European literary salons "were for Eliot emblematic of her quest for a kind of a communal space that could enable solidarity between men and women through the promotion of female intellectuality" (p. 100). This discussion is an impressive contribution to the emerging interest in literary sociability, exemplified by Gillian Russell and Clara Tuite's edited collection of essays, Social Networks and Literary Culture in Britain, 1770-1840 (Cambridge Univ.</page><page sequence="83">ALISON CHAPMAN/ 429 Press 2002), and more recently the 2011 special issue of Women's Writing (vol. 18, issue 1), edited by Gillian Dow, devoted to Women Readers in Europe: Read ers, Writers, Saionnières, 1750-1900. Hadjiafxendi contributes to the debate by acknowledging the contrast between the aurality of salon culture and patri archal contemporary print culture, and the politically problematic nature of salon culture that, while historically giving women's voices an expression, is in opposition to the apparent and much-touted democracy of print culture. The essay argues that print culture silences women's voices in the name of "the public" (p. 100), and that this is reflected in Eliot's own anonymous contribution to the Westminster Review. "Erinna" is read in light of these is sues as Eliot's attempt to redefine female authorship through the recovery of Erinna's poetic voice, focusing on the trope of weaving and the spider (intriguingly connected to Anne Thackary Richie's 1874 essay for the Cornhill, "Arachne in Sloane Street," and to Eliot's own spider tropes in her fiction). Attuned to Eliot's interest in contemporary theories of prosody, in particular the relation between rhythm, readership, and affect, the essay concludes by accepting Eliot's poetics might be a productive failure: "The difficulty of the poem, ... to recover and maintain Erinna's lyric voice, marks the limits of Eliot's sympathetic imagination since solitude supersedes the communal and reinforces the ideology of separate spheres it aims to challenge" (p. 106). Another essay by Kathleen McCormack, "George Eliot: Poetry, Fiction, and European Spas," Journal of European Studies 40, no. 1 (March 2010): 9-22, treats George Eliot's "Agatha" in relation to another manifestation of European sociability, although in a more biographical reading. Augusta Webster was also the focus of two essays. Patricia Rigg's '"Enter ing into the genius of him': Augusta Webster and the Discourse of Translation Theory," Nineteenth-Century Gender Studies 6, no. 1 (Spring 2010), contributes to the ongoing interest of Victorian poetry scholars in the gendered politics of translation. Robert P. Fletcher, in "The Perverse Secrets of Masculinity in Augusta Webster's Dramatic Poetry" (Victorian Secrecy, ed. Albert D. Pionke and Denise Millstein [Ashgate, 2010]), examines the gendered politics of Webster's "In an Almshouse," "The Snow Waste," "With the Dead," and "The Manuscript of Saint Alexius." The essay disagrees with Angela Leighton's assertion that Webster's focus is not concerned with the morbidly obsessed (as with Browning) but rather with the ordinary. Fletcher argues that Webster is interested in "the voice of monomaniacal masculinity" but that she is caught between her commitment to Keatsian neutrality and her political beliefs (p. 149). Like Browning, Webster writes anti-confessional poetry, but Fletcher contends that she offers an alternative to the normative masculine violence and oppression through the figure of the secret. Moving to a poet from earlier in the period, an essay published in this journal by Anne Nichols explores Felicia Hemans' sonnets 'Female</page><page sequence="84">430 / VICTORIAN POETRY Characters from Scripture," from her last and little-studied volume Scenes and Hymns of Life ("Glorification of the Lowly in Felicia Hemans' Sonnets "Female Characters of Scripture," VP 48, no. 4 [2010]: 599-575). Nichols is a careful, astute reader of Hemans, sensitive to the important Wordsworthian contexts (Hemans dedicated the volume to Wordsworth) and to the related importance of poetic form (the sonnet sequence gives Hemans "a balance of form and freedom," related closely to Wordsworth's Ecclesiastical Sonnets [p. 561]), and she offers close readings of a generous range of poems. For Nichols, Hemans' sonnets reveal her discomfort "with large-scale social change," and she "uses these sonnets to reveal the price of separate-sphere ideology without completely rejecting its values" through offering biblical women as role models (p. 559). Ultimately, Hemans occupies a "middle ground" in debates about nineteenth-century religion, neither seeing religion as radical or compensa tory, but rather "a source of mediated agency" (p. 559), a profoundly telling phrase. Hemans' women get their earthly rewards, rather than waiting for the afterlife like so many other Christian poets in the nineteenth century. But, for Nichols, there is an uneasy tension in Hemans' work between upholding the domestic sphere and also desiring to raise the position of wo men. Perhaps this could be explored further through an interrogation of the very uneasiness within the domestic sphere ideology itself. Religion and Victorian women's poetry is also examined in Rebecca Styler's chapter on Anne Brontë's poetry in her monograph Literary Theology by Women Writers of the Nineteenth Century. The book considers a range of other writers too, such as Emma Worboise, Harriet Martineau, and Josephine Butler. Styler charts the curve of Brontë's short poetic career in relation to the "inner battle between religious ideals and emotional reality, from which she forges a tentative religious solution in which reason and morality come to the fore" (p. 43). Addressing a generous range of her poems, the chapter argues that Brontë's theology is an optimistic one, influenced by rational humanism, but Brontë also expresses "her ideal of religious experience [that] centres in an intensely felt epiphany which is shaped by Methodist and Romantic discourses" (p. 44). Testing her ideal against her experience, with the "frank realism" also evident from her novels, leads Brontë to disrupt the nineteenth-century expressive tradition of women's poetry, seeming to offer conformity to its lyrical affective conventions, but also giving "a conflicted subjectivity, characterized by deep frustration and religious anxiety" (p. 45). The chapter begins by mapping Brontë's humanism through her critique of Calvinism in "To Cowper" and "A Word to the Calvinists" (entitled in the 1846 Poems "A Word to the Elect"). In her early religious poetry and under the influence of Romanticism and Evangelicalism, Styler argues, Brontë reaches tentatively towards a fully felt epiphany, despite her rational belief in God. The discussion also covers the poetry's sense of what Styler suggestively calls a</page><page sequence="85">ALISON CHAPMAN / 431 "bereaved sensibility" (p. 54), for example in poems like "A Hymn," in the face of a loss of assurance about divine presence, even as the anxiety is countered with rationalism. Styler links this to Bronte's belief that human relationships can potentially connote the experience of the divine, and she explores the treatment of sympathy and fellowship, and its loss, in such poems as "Monday Night May 11th 1846," "Dreams," and "Fluctuations," which work through a bleak "isolated sensibility" (p. 58). The later poetry, from circa 1845 to Brontë's death in 1849, is for Styler distinguished "by a new sense of reconcili ation with the earthly condition" (p. 60), for example in "Views of Life" and "The Three Guides." Echoing Edward Chitham's view that hers is "a poetry of search, not statement" (cited p. 67), Styler treats Brontë's poetry in all its fascinating, contradictory, and tentative embrace of a pragmatic faith, while also imagining a felt, physical presence of the divine. This analysis is excellent for its sensitive and searching analysis of Anne Brontë's poetry in the context of an ambitious and wide ranging study of women writers and religion, and for taking seriously the intellectual heritage of her poetical theology. Hellenism, discussed above in relation to Levy, also emerged as sig nificant for other writers this year. Richard Dellamora's "Greek Desire and Modern Sexualities" (Imagination and Logos: Essays on C. P. Cavafy, ed. Pan agiotis Roilos [Harvard Univ. Press, 2010]) is a theoretically ambitious essay that grapples with the issue of homosexual/heterosexual binaries, as well as the configuration of Greek desire as "a much wider range of affective, rela tional, and cultural possibilities" (p. 121). Dellamora compares the poetry of Constantine Cavafy with Michael Field in this way, to examine their shared "historicist cosmopolitanism" that "provide[s] ways for thinking subjectivity outside the limits of the subject" (p. 140). The analysis concentrates on Field's Long Ago (1889), Underneath the Bough (1893), and Dedicated (1914), including a nuanced reading of "It was deep April, and the morn" as a cosmopolitan poem, a revision of the Elizabethan lyric. This poem addresses a forbidden love, "Against the world" (1. 5), and the critique of the poem attempts to tease out its difficult logic in terms of the ethics of love within the discourse of Greek desire. Identity in the plural is "permeable and indeterminate" (p. 140), and Field, along with Cavafy, "bring[s] into existence new modes of sociability" that are not straightforwardly "homosexual" (p. 140). A book-length study of the importance of Hellenism to women writers also appeared this year. T. D. Olverson's Women Writers and the Dark Side of Late-Victorian Hellenism contains readings of poems by Augusta Webster, Amy Levy (also published in Hetherington and Valman's edited collection of es says and reviewed above), Emily Pfeiffer, and Michael Field, and concluding with a chapter on Medea in Mona Caird and Vernon Lee's prose. Loosely chronological, the chapters suggest a development in women writers' relation to Hellenism, from its political freighting in poems by Webster, Levy, and</page><page sequence="86">432 / VICTORIAN POETRY Pfeiffer, to the aestheticism of Field which Olverson argues coincides with a waning of feminism. Hellenism was appealing to women writers for its "rich source of inspiration and creative inspiration" (p. 174), and in particular the Hellenic female characters were a vehicle for women's frustrations, anxieties, and desires. Olverson reads the Hellenism in women's writing politically, seeing that antiquity provides an expression for women's hope for a future with more equality and opportunity. While there may be a missed opportu nity in not directly addressing why so much poetry by women engages with Hellenistic myth—surely genre comparisons are important to draw out in a book that ends by turning without explanation to prose as part of its history of Victorian Hellenism—the study is valuable for bringing such a rich range of late-century women's poetry prominently to the foreground. The chapters uncover women writers' bold and active engagement with the classics, through women's readership, education and scholarship, translation, and editing, while also exploring what Olverson calls the "dark side" of Victorian Hellenism, a Dionysian "seditious Hellenism" (p. 19), its prejudicial, anti-democratic impulses. The study is excellent for tackling why women writers were drawn to Hellenistic myths, and the limitations and rewards of re-mythologizing Hellenic women. Standing out for its nuanced engagement with politics is the extensive and detailed reading of Webster's "Medea in Athens" in terms of the Divorce Court and debates about marriage, arguing that the poem puts emphasis on Jason's sexual infidelities that challenge the domestic or der, rather than Medea's actions (pp. 44-45). Another strength of the book is the insightful reading of Emily Pfeiffer's political Hellenism in her sonnet sequence "Studies from the Antique," first published in 1879 and expanded in 1880, and featuring representations of Klytemnestra and Kassandra that were a response to other women writers' revisions of the Petrarchan sonnet form. Overall, Women Writers and the Dark Side of Late-Victorian Hellenism is a superb study, carefully researched and argued, that gives an excellent account of how very politically and aesthetically productive women writers' revisions were to the transgressive and violent side of Hellenism.</page></plain_text>
