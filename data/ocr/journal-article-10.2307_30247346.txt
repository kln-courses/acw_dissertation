SPAIN Zuni Archaeology Program Pueblo of Zuni, New Mexico ABSTRACT Carved-wood Navajo figurines, of the type known as "dolls," are encountered on rubble mounds of prehistoric Anasazi sites throughout parts of Arizona and New Mexico. The disposition of these objects on archaeo- logical sites associated with the Anasazi and the sensitive nature of the curing activities surrounding their ceremonial use present a situation requiring a responsive interest on the part of the archaeologist and cultural resource manager. A specific example from west central New Mexico demonstrates these concerns, resulting in a mutually satisfactory course of action for both the archaeologist and the local Navajo community. INTRODUCTION Three carved-wood Navajo figurines, of the type known as medicine "dolls." were located on and adjacent to the rubble mound of a prehistoric Anasazi site approximately 30 km south of Gallup, New Mexico. These dolls were discovered as a result of initial Bureau of Indian Affairs road construction and subsequent archaeological mitigation activities at NM: 12:U2:62. This site is one of nine prehistoric Anasazi and recent historic Navajo sites situated within a BIA Branch of Roads road upgrading project (N7046) right-of-way. The focus of this project, the Jones Ranch Road, is the primary link with the New Mexico state highway system for the many Navajo families living in the area. This road is a central feature on and around which many important Navajo activities take place - one of these activities being the placement of ceremonial curing dolls on prehistoric archaeological sites adjacent to the road. DESCRIPTION AND CULTURAL CONTEXT OF "DOLL" FIGURINES The dolls were each carved from a single piece of unidentified wood, traditionally cottonwood root, and were between 1 I and 13 cm in length and 2.5 cm in width. Each doll was roughly carved and exhibited limited body relief; head. arms. legs. and feet were all clearly depicted. The feet of two of the dolls were painted reddish-brown, while the feet of the third doll showed no indication of paint. A ventral groove extends from the neck in each doll, and in two of them it extends to the groin with slightly enlarged depressions at each end of the 273</page><page sequence="2">274 SPAIN groove. It is quite possible that these depressions contained 'jewels" at the time of deposition, a "jewel" being any of a number of semiprecious stones, including turquoise, jet, and coral, or white shell. There was no trace of fabric or clothing adorning the dolls as one informant had remembered. The descriptions of the three figurines closely fit those presented by others as representing anthropomorphic figurines ("dolls") associated with the "Remaking of the Baby Figurine" curing ceremony (Gill 1974; James and Bradford 1974; Kelly 1972; Lang and Walters 1972; Reher 1977; Ward 1970). The "Remaking" rite is a relatively short and inexpensive ceremony directed at effecting a cure for individuals who have made certain transgressions against proscribed behavior. These transgressions generally relate to minor injuries of the human or supernatural form of animals or the breaking of other traditional taboos by pregnant women or their husbands, which result in subsequent illness to the woman or, more commonly, her offspring. When an illness is attributed to such a prenatal experience, a "singer" is contacted to perform the appropriate curing ceremony. The singer, or his assistant, who is many times a member of the sick person's family, carves the figurine. Upon completion of the ceremony, the doll is deposited upon a nearby ruin or other location easily accessible to the supernaturals (Franciscan Fathers 1910; Gill 1974; Haile 1947; James and Bradford 1974; Kelly 1972; Lang and Walters 1972). NAVAJO DOLLS: A MANAGEMENT PERSPECTIVE The final disposition of the dolls is an important event and holds special symbolic meaning. The placement signifies the return of the Holy Person (a supernatural) to its home - the place of origin - and a restoration to a former condition of balance and health for the patient (Gill 1974:65). A continued relationship exists between the figurine and the patient's health, and any disturbance or destruction of the doll may result in a relapse for the patient or illness to the individual involved in its disturbance (Haile 1947:9; James and Bradford 1974:74-75; Lang and Walters 1972:60-62). For this reason the deposited figurine is dutifully avoided and disturbance or removal of a doll, whether inadvertent or purposeful, results in anxiety and concern. This concern is exemplified in Navajo requests of archaeologists to leave undisturbed figurines that are on sites or to return those that have been removed (Kelly 1972:40: Lang and Walters 1972:60-62). I think most anthropologists would agree with James and Bradford's (1974:75) position: Because of their beliefs, and in respect of Navajo culture. any figurines found should be left where they are. By this means. the ceremonial context of the figurine would not be disturbed. ... Unfortunately, this has not been the usual practice, and it is quite difficult to implement in a contract setting where mitigation activities and project demands</page><page sequence="3">Navajo Culture and Anasazi Archaeology 275 may effectively remove the archaeological site on which the dolls reside. Thus, the ultimate removal of these dolls from their ritual context by archaeologists has exacerbated the general anxiety already present among the Navajo resulting from the archaeological excavation of the Anasazi. Most Navajo still maintain a healthy fear for the chindi (ghosts) of the ancient ones. We can obviate this legitimate concern, however, through active efforts to locate and consult with those persons involved in the ceremony which produced the figurines, and arrive at a mutually satisfactory course of action. The following example suggests this may not be as difficult as might appear at first. The first two figurines located at NM: 12:U2:62 were initially discovered by BIA Branch of Roads personnel and subsequently inspected by U.S. National Park Service and Zuni Archaeology Program archaeologists. The nature and significance of the dolls was assessed and made apparent to all agencies involved. A high level priority was established to deal with the figurines in a manner acceptable to the local Navajo community prior to archaeological mitigation. The author proceeded by attempting to locate the person(s) responsible for the placement of the dolls at the site. The first step was to contact the local Navajo Chapter Chairman (Chi'Chil'Tah Chapter) who would be familiar with the local residents, and might act as a liaison with the community. The chairman graciously offered to help find the "owner" of the dolls. He said he knew little of such matters but suggested we inquire at homesteads to the north of the site since medicine dolls are always placed to the south of the sick person's residence on places where the Anasazi lived. After talking with a few Navajo families in the immediate vicinity of the site. we visited a medicine man who said he knew who placed the dolls, but that he was not at home. The following day we returned to the man's home - approximately one-half km northwest of NM: 12:U2:62. He was present and said through the chapter chairman, who functioned as interpreter, that he was responsible for placing the two medicine dolls on the site 15 to 20 years ago. At that time two of his children, both young adults today, were sick with an unspecified illness. He further volunteered that the dolls were originally carved out of wood to human likeness with distinct physical features. Furthermore, the dolls were adorned with turquoise and fully clothed; neither feature of which was evident upon their recent discovery. Apparently aware of the potential effect of the impending archaeological and road construction work, and possibly our inquiry the day before, he informed us he had removed the dolls from the site earlier in the day and had placed them at an unspecified location north of the Jones Ranch Road. He said that he planned to return them to a location near their original position when the current road work was completed. When asked if it would be inappropriate to take additional photographs of the dolls, if desired at some time in the future, he</page><page sequence="4">276 SPAIN voiced no objection as long as he were not involved. These objects, after nearly 20 years, still retained or represented significant symbolic power to be of concern to him. He further stated that he had placed other medicine dolls in the vicinity of NM: 12:U2:62, as well as the two already mentioned. A third figurine was discovered two weeks later on the same site by a Zuni Archaeology Program field crew while establishing a provenience control grid across the surface of the site. The chapter chairman and I once again conferred with the informant about this doll. Without learning exactly who was involved in the placement of this particular medicine doll, it was both the informant's and the chapter chairman's opinion that the proper disposition would be for me to move it out of the impact zone and later return it to a position close to its original location. This advice was acted upon and the doll was removed to a spot about 30 m north of its in situ placement. DISCUSSION: IMPLICATIONS FOR THE FUTURE The example presented above illustrates the kind of directions archaeol- ogists and others can take to meet the legitimate concerns of native Americans toward their cultural resources - be those resources Navajo medicine doll figurines, gravesites, sweat lodges, or one of several other potentially sensitive objects or features. The hopeful outcome of such a policy is to, indeed, manage these resources by promoting input from those people most directly associated with the resource in question and allowing them to become actively involved in the planning and decision-making processes of projects affecting them. An explicit set of recommendations for use in similar situations is not a specific goal of this paper. Interactions with, and effects upon, local Indian communities as a result of archaeological investigations may be manyfold. requiring a multifaceted approach addressing the unique circumstances and conditions surrounding the particular issue. It is the author's opinion that individualized and creative approaches toward resolving sensitive issues affect- ing native American communities is the way to proceed. The only recommendations I would make, regardless of the resource in- volved. is that the mediation and resolution of a conflict be initiated, developed. and directed at the local level. Direct participation of those individuals most intimately connected with the object(s) of concern is, obviously, most preferable, although. in the example cited in this paper, contact with the local political unit. the Chapter house, helped facilitate a speedy and amicable arrangement. The involvement of groups or agencies beyond the local community could only add to the sense of frustration over the lack of control in one's own affairs and ultimately result in increased ambivalence or outright animosity toward those same groups or agencies. This, I suggest. is an alternative to be avoided if the effects of archaeological investigations are ever to be viewed by native Americans as beneficial to them.</page><page sequence="5">Navajo Culture and Anasazi Archaeology 277 In the case cited in this paper, the individual whose medicine dolls were in jeopardy of destruction or removal by others was very appreciative that we were concerned enough to seek his advice about the matter. Although leaving the dolls undisturbed would certainly have been the best solution, any consideration of alternative action was best handled by those with a clear understanding of the full cultural context of the situation. In this way, the adverse impact of removing the dolls was minimized through conscious, well-informed decision making with a clear view to the potential ramifications and their relative acceptability. This process brings us, as cultural resource managers, into unison with the spirit of cultural resource management as envisioned through legislation over the past 75 years. This is nowhere more apparent than in the recent legislation supporting the free exercise, use, and protection of American Indian religious practices, sacred sites, and objects as evidenced in the American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978 (P.L. 95-341), California's establishment of a Native American Heritage Commission (A.B. 4239), and a Navajo Tribal Resolution (CF-20-78) prohibiting the removal of figurines from locations of ritual deposition. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This report is a result of archaeological investigation sponsored by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Navajo Area Office. Window Rock, Arizona. I would like to express my appreciation to H. Barry Holt of this agency and Ed Bishop, BIA (NAO), Area Branch of Roads, for their continued support and interest in this project and to the Cultural Resource Management Program, Navajo Nation. for their aid in facilitating and accommodating the work schedule. A special note of thanks goes to Barbara Holmes and Ted Birkedal of the National Park Service, Santa Fe, for their valuable advice and stabilizing influence throughout the project. I owe a personal debt of gratitude to T. J. Ferguson. former Program Director of the Zuni Archaeology Program, for his total support and confidence in my implementation of the field research. Our role as cultural resource managers would have been incomplete if not for the concern and cooperation of those Navajo living along the Jones Ranch Road.
