<plain_text><page sequence="1">WE COME TO BURY BOSTON* KATHARINE SIMONDS BOSTON had once a certain greatness. There was nobility in her passion for learning, in her devotion to causes, how- ever unpopular, in her intolerance of injustice. For at least two hundred years, she bred great men. Some of them stayed at home; some with her blessing went out and stamped on new- er lands the patterns she had taught them; some-and perhaps they were the greatest-rebelled against her, and ran away, and sought the things that were not part of their rich inheritance, though, seeking them with the energy, the determination, the clarity of mind, the impatience with sham or compromise that remained an inheritance they could not disavow, they were recognized wherever they went as her true sons. She was long in dying and to those who knew her she seemed greatly changed. Even in youth, she had suffered many losses. Her graces had departed with the Tories, her grace abounding with Roger Williams, though it was briefly renewed by Chan- ning. At the end, little was left except her unattractive quali- ties; she was arrogant and rude, and reactionary, and blunt and cold and inhospitable; though she continued to set other people right, she was lax about her own household; and several of the convictions which she maintained to her deathbed with unabated fervor were as manifestly absurd and antiquated as her clothes. Her obituary notices were many, befitting one who was once great, and one who had relished funerals. The shrunken family went on living in the old house, on an income smaller but still considerable. They were not young either, and of * From the list of recent books about Boston, four have been selected as the point of departure for this essay: The Proper Bostonians, by Cleveland Amory (New York: E. P. Dutton &amp; Company, 19i47); When I Was a Boy in Boston, by Charles Angoff, with illustrations by Samuel Gilbert (New York: Beechhurst Press, Inc., 1947); The Boston Book, by Esther Forbes, with photographs by Arthur Griffin (Boston: Houghton, Mifflin Company, 1947); and Invitation to Boston, by Agnes Claire Lyons, with photographs by Samuel Chamberlain (New York: M. Barrows &amp; Company, Inc., 1947)- '47</page><page sequence="2">148 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY course they had been brought up in the tradition of her im- portance. They read her death notices with great interest and, since they had her dry sense of humor, they were as amused by the floweriness of some as they were offended by the note of con- tempt in others. But as time went on-fifty years, eighty years? it is hard to re- member when she was first pronounced dead-even the sur- vivors thought it strange how the obituaries continued. They were more and more varied. Van Wyck Brooks's was like that of a shy young admirer, who had often been invited to tea, and therefore was loving and diligent with paste pot and scissors. George Santayana wrote in mellow reminiscence, like an old beau; Lucius Beebe, like an indulged nephew. Some had a deep bitterness, as of a rejected and misunderstood child, like Henry Adams, or as of a betrayed fellow-revolutionary, like John Dos Passos; while others, like John Marquand, and Nan- cy Hale, and Louis Bromfield and Helen Howe, sounded the slightly waspish note of those unable to get along with a moth- er-in-law. Still younger generations of writers grew up, and for them, too, the glorious youth and middle age, the inglorious old age, the village pettiness, the cosmic comprehension, the hard strength, the feeble gentility, the pretensions, the understate- ments, the riches, the barrenness, the timidity, the ruthlessness, the eccentricity, the conformity, the complacency, of Boston continued to be a major theme, at which everyone must try his hand. But though the emphasis varied, and the anecdotes were not always identical, it was curious how uniform was the pat- tern of the conclusions. What began to emerge was a legend, which successive writers refined without re-examining; the bibliographies and the footnotes had become so extensive that observation was obscured. Few bothered to look and see if breath had indeed left the body; few seemed to wonder if the legend itself had not been based on a misconception. Extraordinary, indeed, is the list of books that have been</page><page sequence="3">WE COME TO BURY BOSTON 149 written about Boston and the Boston character within the last twenty years! Early Autumn, The Last Puritan, The Late George Apley, Wickford Point, The Flowering of New Eng- land, Indian Summer, The Prodigal Women, We Happy Few, Paul Revere, Boston and the Boston Legend, Yankee from Olympus, and Boston Adventure, to name only the ones that come readily to mind. Still more extraordinary, however, is the fact that almost every one of these books was a national best- seller. What other American city could claim any record approach- ing this one? And yet, since all agreed that Boston was dead or moribund, why should so many writers bother to explain Bos- ton, so many publishers publish what they wrote, and so many readers want to read their books? Let us examine a new collection of books about Boston. All four are written by people who know Boston well; what as- pects have they chosen as likely to interest the rest of the coun- try? Mr. Amory's book is concerned with the Boston legend, which is in his bones, since he is what Lucius Beebe was the first to call "a Proper Bostonian." Here is the Boston of the water side of Beacon Street, the western and southern slopes of Beacon Hill, the right suburbs, where lives that small aris- tocracy of blood and wealth and education, some of whose foundations were laid in the Puritan Commonwealth, but most in nineteenth-century trade; those born to the purple panes. This Boston of tradition is also the theme of Miss Lyons' and Miss Forbes's guidebooks, written to help the visitor-the school teacher from Indiana, the Chicagoan on his way to a vacation on the Cape, the new Big Rich from Houston, the Grange members from Kansas. Miss Lyons' chatty, amusing and well-documented guide takes her reader from shrine to shrine, presenting not only the large facts of history but also its oddities, and especially the oddities of those nineteenth-centu- ry Proper Bostonians who have been called "the east wind made flesh." Miss Forbes, as might be expected of the historian</page><page sequence="4">150 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY of Paul Revere, is more particularly interested in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Boston; her book is less a guide than an essay; deeper, better written than Miss Lyons' book: Boston recollected in tranquillity. The finished and lovely photo- graphs with which Samuel Chamberlain illustrates Miss Ly- ons' book show for the most part a city inhabited only by the ghosts of the great dead: posed in its Sunday best, it is free of the untidy living. But in the photographs by Arthur Griffin which appear in Miss Forbes's book, a different Boston emerges. Here are the familiar landmarks of traditional Boston: the brick shrines to liberty, the brownstone monuments to domestic comfort and security, the granite temples to business and finance. But they are seen as parts of a city not dead but living; a city of people sweating and shirt-sleeved and haggling over barrows in the summer, miserably bent against the east wind in the winter. Even Sam Adams-"statesman fearless and incorruptible"-be- comes less static when Mr. Griffin shows him with a pigeon cocked over one eye. Not only lives, but heights and spaces and winds combine to suggest a living city and not a quaint mu- seum. Citizen of this living city, child of a Boston unmentioned in the legend, is Charles Angoff. Like Mr. Amory, he was a boy in Boston; a Russian Jewish immigrant, he is part of the life that swarms in Mr. Griffin's pictures, unseen by the Proper Bos- tonian. Though it is true that the Angoffs are poor and newly arrived, they come of an intellectual tradition at least as old as the Amorys', and in some ways identical. Mr. Angoff's ances- tors played a great part in shaping the Amorys a long time ago, giving them their "Christian" names, their phraseology, and much of their religion and philosophy. Moreover, like many a Proper Bostonian, Mr. Angoff had a great grandfather who was eccentric, independent, longlived, famous for good works, and a faddist in matters of dress and health. Also, Mr. Angoff lived within the framework of the Amorys' Boston, learning its mythology at schools named "Bowdoin"</page><page sequence="5">WE COME TO BURY BOSTON 151 or "Peter Faneuil." To him, the Proper Bostonian is a tradi- tion as exciting as the Red Sox or Honey Fitz; he and a friend attended something they described as "a very exclusive club that all the Boston Brahmins belong to." And though their club house was a certain park bench, and they were the only members, the talk there was possibly as lively and intellectual- ly stimulating as that at a certain Park Street club. And he sub- scribes to the Bostonian conviction that Harvard is the best of all universities, and regrets that his poverty prevented him from going there. But to the casual visitor, Boston today would seem to be ob- viously composed of more Angoffs than Amorys. A city of two million inhabitants, where one may eat or go to church in a dozen languages, a great seaport, a loose and thoroughly famil- iar collection of subways, sailors' dives, honkytonks, depart- ment stores, and students-how can it be represented by the strange little group of legend? One could walk the streets for days without meeting the Saltoncabots of Frank Dahl's cartoons-the tart elderly women in Queen Mary hats, their angular and acid daughters, their sanctimonious and snooping husbands. Even in 1909, it seemed to Robert Grant that this group of legend had ceased to be representative of contemporary Bos- ton. Of the Proper Bostonian hero of The Chippendales, Hen- ry Sumner, he said, Already the social type for which he stands is waning fast before the pressure of foreign and visible forces. Let whoever doubts this face Boston from the region of the west when the setting sun transfigures the landscape of the Back Bay fens, and ponder. On what does the eye linger? On the commanding dome of the Christian Science temple, on the Saracenic top of the Hebrew Synagogue, on the official roof of the Roman Catholic see. Beyond this vanguard of conflicting old world doctrines, reincarnated on New England soil, lies an already cosmopolitan city, proud of its traditions and its glory. Richer than ever in the fruits of its industry and thrift, seeth- ing-still seething-with all the problems of the universe, will it</page><page sequence="6">152 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY hold its distinction as a moulder of thought and a quickener of con- science when Henry and his like slumber with the mastodon and the buffalo? That is for posterity to answer. Forty years later, the Henry Sumners are even less represent- ative of their own city; but still they have no inclination to join the buffalo and the mastodon. They may be recessive, but they are still breeding true. Unlike most other American aristocra- cies, they retain their vigor. Three generations does not see the Proper Bostonian from shirt sleeve to shirt sleeve; he may de- velop marked eccentricities, a fondness for digitated socks, an anxiety about germs on door-handles, a fanatical Canutism against vivisection or birth control or accurate transcription of the facts of love. But the very same person is more than likely to retain his ancestors' talent for business, for medicine, for law. He may even become a leader in new fields-discover a planet, popularize modern poetry, pioneer in abstract thought, in soci- ology, in atomic energy. The pattern admits of putterers but not of fritterers. There are Boston black sheep; the Boston spendthrift is almost unknown. There has even been an access of political energy among Proper Bostonians, furnishing Mas- sachusetts with a governor and two senators from the small ranks of Boston aristocracy. There are, then, two Bostons, the old and the new, and both are alive. Since the newer Boston does not partake of the legend and is in no way unique, we may disregard it in considering the Boston legend, and sticking to our last Puritans, try to de- cide what it is about them that has so captured and maintained the interest of the rest of the country. It cannot be merely that Boston is an old aristocracy; Charleston, Baltimore, Virginia, Philadelphia are old aris- tocracies, too, with all of those graces and charms which are supposed to adorn an aristocracy, and which are so conspicu- ously absent in Boston. It is not that Boston is rich, because there are other rich cities, and many in which the signs and amenities of riches are far more visible than in Boston.</page><page sequence="7">WE COME TO BURY BOSTON 153 Since it is not riches and not graces, and certainly not glam- our or romance, what can it be that gives the rest of the country a nostalgia for Boston? There is nothing else except Boston's apparent security. Over and over again, the writers about Bos- ton stress its security-and its complacency and arrogance which are security run to seed. In her best-selling Boston Adventure, Jean Stafford writes of the Granary Burying-ground: The sparse and lowly graves of the harsh garden testified to the city's conviction of its rightness and its adamant resistance to change. And Nancy Hale, in her popular The Prodigal Women, de- scribes a group of Bostonians: They were drinking their tea, smoking; invulnerable, untouched, untouchable. Armies could fling themselves against such people as these, and when they fell back, the people would be unscarred; un- impressed, drinking their tea. It seemed to Leda that at a word from these people the nations of the world fell down in hopeless subjugation: the negroes, the Ethi- opians, the Italians, the Southerners-what were any of these jerry- built people against the calm and imperturbable Bostonians? Peo- ple said that Boston was a joke, an exhausted backwash from the past; but the people of it would never be defeated because they were not paying any attention. Newly uneasy, insecure, doubting, distrusting, fearing, the rest of America turns to Boston as a symbol of security. Boston may look dull, anachronistic, absurd, but it looks solid. The country is right in thinking Boston is secure, but com- pletely wrong in thinking it solid. What they take to be rock is quicksand-doubt, skepticism, distrust, despair. Boston long ago accepted the insecurity that all America feels now; accepted it, allowed for it, compensated for it, and kept on going. The Bostonian's distrust begins with self-distrust. If there is any, thing that one Bostonian, one New Englander, knows about</page><page sequence="8">154 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY every other, it is precisely his insecurity, his disbelief, his doubt, his self-distrust. Henry Adams, who was one of the greatest of them, wrote to Henry James, who was another: The painful truth is that all of my New England generation were in actual fact only one mind and nature; the individual was a facet of Boston. We knew each other to the last nervous centre, and feared each other's knowledge.... Type bourgeois-bostonien! ... God knows that we knew our want of knowledge! the self-distrust become introspection-nervous self- consciousness-irritable dislike of America, and antipathy to Bos- ton. It was this Henry Adams who was celebrated among people who did not know him for his harsh and arrogant complacency. From self-distrust, the New Englander goes on to distrust of everything. Of such nihilism Brooks Adams was the most elo- quent and most sweeping exponent: If we gaze upon the heavens, we discern immeasurable spaces sprinkled with globules of matter, to which our earth seems to be more or less akin, but all plunging, apparently, both furiously and aimlessly, from out of an infinite past to an equally immeasur- able future. Whence this material mass comes, or what its wild flight por- tends, we neither know, nor could we, probably, comprehend, even were its secret divulged to us by a superior intelligence, al- ways conceding that there be such an intelligence, or any secret to disclose. Nothing could be more Bostonian than this statement; its nihilism, and the hesitancy to assert which accompanies its assertions. On this doubt of self, of the world, of the universe, Boston is founded. This insecurity, carried as far as human imagina- tion can go, and accepted, is the secret of New England strength.</page><page sequence="9">WE COME TO BURY BOSTON '55 For if you admit, again with Brooks Adams, "chaos as being the probable core of the universe" then it becomes your des- perate concern to evolve order out of it "if ever we are to cope with violence, fraud, crime, war and general brutality." You cannot wait for God's plan to work itself out if you do not be- lieve in a God or a plan; you have to draw up your own battle- lines, and impose your own purpose-small and irrelevant though you know it to be-on what you can isolate of the ran- dom. While you can, where you can, you must preserve what you cherish. Thus it was said of Oliver Alden, Santayana's "Last Puri- tan," that in order to escape chaos, "without imposing any fic- tions or any false hopes upon mankind, he would have been capable of imposing no matter what regimen upon us by force." Boston draws narrow lines, cultivates a small garden, con- serves rather than revolutionizes-and is called timid and un- imaginative. But the Boston mind has ranged so far beyond the flaming boundaries of the known world that it understands that all boundaries are arbitrary-acknowledging the cold air of outer space, and a non-anthropomorphic universe, it weaves around itself the comforting little chrysalis of known faces, known places, known purposes. The Adamses erected despair into a system-" Conservative Christian Anarchy" was Henry's name for it. They gave them- selves a kind of comfort by the eloquence and grandeur with which they announced to the world its approaching dissolu- tion along the lines they had charted. The rest of the country admired them, but in large measure disregarded them as over- intellectualized Jules Vernes, prophets of a doom which might never come, impressive phenomena but separate from any main current. But on the contrary they were expressing ideas common to many of their generation, and consonant with the steady current of New England thought. In late nineteenth-century Boston, in particular, there were many who felt so unhappy in this climate of doubt, self-distrust</page><page sequence="10">156 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY and despair that they tried to escape to strange foreign coun- tries and strange foreign religions; but most of them found oqlly a more flowery nihilism. George Santayana's Peter Alden was in many ways their prototype: That very tedium, that hunger for something less disconsolate, which had driven him to such places, drove him away from them .... Their own curious tenets and practices, after the ro- mance of novelty had worn off, he found unspeakably tiresome and foolish, except one only, which rendered all further religion and philosophy superfluous: namely that there is no power save Unsearchable Power, and that what will be, will be. Most distinguished and most beloved of such seekers was William Sturgis Bigelow. Motherless child of a great doctor, grandson of another, he studied medicine but never practised it. Like so many of his Boston contemporaries, he became a wanderer. He went to Japan; he became a Buddhist; he re- turned with the collection of Japanese art which is now once more to be seen in the Fine Arts Museum. He combined a pas- sion for Nirvana with a lifelong devotion to a European opera singer; worldly wit and brilliance and elegance with a scorn for the Wheel of Life to which the worldly are bound. He wrote Buddhism and Immortality without ever losing a mortal and Yankee taste in electric trains. When he died, his old friend Bishop Lawrence presided at his funeral, as he had requested. But it was confidently said that the Bishop knew that within the coffin to which in full Episcopal regalia he gave honor, his friend's body lay in the full regalia of a Buddhist priest. And some time later, as the three queens came for the dying King Arthur, two Japanese priests appeared, and carried Sturgis Bigelow's body back to Japan, where it is now en- shrined, in the security of a Nirvana still older, still more com- plete than that which Boston has been able to accept. Ordinary Bostonians feel doubt, insecurity and distrust as much as these extraordinary ones, but more tacitly, and they take less dramatic measures against them. Some build large</page><page sequence="11">WE COME TO BURY BOSTON 157 families into walls, stabilizing and protective, however illu- sory. Of them, Henry Adams wrote: Boston's purpose in life is to breed and to educate. The parent lives for his children; the child, when educated himself, becomes a par- ent or becomes an educator, or is both. But no further result is ever reached. Just as at twenty the parent reproduces himself in a child, so the teacher reproduces himself in his scholar. But neither as child nor as scholar does the new generation do more than devote itself to becoming in its turn parent and teacher. Nothing ever comes of it all.... When a society has reached this point, it acquires a self-complacency which is wildly exasperating. My fingers itch to puncture it-to do something which will sting it into impropriety. But the heart of this "self-complacency" is anguish, the tragic and futile wish to shelter the child against the shelterless uni- verse that awaits him. In this triple tutelage, in the cradle of his race, in the city familiar since his infancy, under the eyes of parents as long-lived as they are anxious, the adolescence of the Bostonian is prolonged. Thus, in the strong mold, with the strong example, it often happens-the phrase is Robert Grant's-that "the virtues of the fathers are visited on the chil- dren to the third and fourth generations." Intermarriage is another gesture of insecurity, another wall against the accepted cold horror of doubt. Jean Stafford discovered a Bostonian general principle; namely that everyone was related to everyone else, or if blood kinship did not obtain, something else almost as binding did; people had gone to dancing school together or their fathers had been law-partners or their mothers had been Red Cross nurses in the same village in France. In this warm little world, so Oliver Alden was taught, You may almost escape the scramble outside, the low boasts, the ugly language, the aggressive commonness of modern life, and its idiotic pleasures; you may smilingly disregard the press and the pulpit and the professors, not opposing them, since they are part of the extant system, and may be useful, but passing them by in</page><page sequence="12">158 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY your own mind. This is a dark age for the spirit, an age of secret preparation. We mustn't expect our people to understand their own predicament for decades, perhaps for centuries. Some Bostonians hedge against doubt by avarice, by making a virtue of spending only the income of their income. Others dedicate their energies to good works. Many of Henry James's characters were like these last; for instance, Miss Birdseye in The Bostonians, who belonged to every league that had been founded for almost any purpose whatever. She knew less about her fellow creatures, if possible, after fifty years of humanitarian zeal, than on the day she had gone into the field to testify against the iniquity of most arrangements.... She looked as if she had spent all her life on plat- forms. Such another was Mrs. Farrinder: the ends she labored for were to give the ballot to every woman in the country and to take the flowing bowl from every man. From The Bostonians to The Proper Bostonians, ladies like these have appeared in the books about Boston. Yet today, you may still see them coming out of brass-plated doorways on that upper slope of Mt. Vernon Street where organized virtue has been substituted for the organized vice which once gave it the name of Mt. Whoredom. For the most part, their revolution- ary zeal has been directed to foreign rather than domestic re- form: not until the Curleys began physically to uproot the bricks of West Cedar Street did the Proper Bostonian lady- crusaders unite in any effective opposition to municipal cor- ruption. Boston is still the largest charity city in the country, with the Proper Bostonians making the largest contributions and maintaining the directorships of the most important charities. But on the whole their favorite charities-the ones with the grandiloquent names, like the Massachusetts Humane Soci-</page><page sequence="13">WE COME TO BURY BOSTON 159 ety, the Home for Little Wanderers, the Watch and Ward So- ciety, are of a sort to mend the fences which protect Boston rather than to shake down and remake the structure of an un- equal social order, which, you remember, "is part of the extant system and may be useful." How did Boston and its Proper Bostonians arrive at this odd state of mind? How has it persisted so long in the face of factors which have modified the rest of the country? Its core is the product of coincidence heaped on historic co- incidence to such a point that it has come to look like an obe- lisk of purpose. The founders of Boston broke away from one ecclesiastical authority in England and came to this country to establish another. In a very short time the new authority was at least as rigid as the old. William Blaxton, the original settler, as he moved out, declared with a characteristic Bostonian dry- ness and rudeness: "He had left England because he did not like the Lord Bishops and he was leaving now because he did not like the Lord Brethren." In those who remained, the impulse toward freedom of thought worked under the menaces of loss of civil rights, tor- ture, death, and hell, but it kept on working. Dissidents of dis- sent, and protestants of the Protestant religion, born into an age of doubt, they doubted first damnation without representa- tion, and then taxation without representation. Their first re- volt led to the secularization of government, the second to en- franchisement from England. In many Proper Bostonians to- day, it would lead to secession-if only the Irish were willing. It has led to a kind of mental secession: from the naif opti- misms, and the equally naif panics of the rest of America. From the first, Boston provided itself with the greatest weap- on of doubt-education. Its leaders were all men of education, even scholars; and six years after they had reached this wilder- ness, they founded Harvard. Boston has always believed in Harvard; has built it up as a stable trust, a major beneficiary under Boston wills. If Lawrence Lowell contributed enor-</page><page sequence="14">16o THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY mously to its physical and financial security by persuading Harkness to endow it, he also made another characteristically Bostonian contribution; he founded with his own money the Society of Fellows, a self-perpetuating body of the intellectual elect, free of any restrictions or demands, free to learn, to con- clude, to explore, to challenge, and to undermine. The accidents of climate have combined with the accidents of history to shape the apparent unceasing purpose of Boston. Toynbee ascribes Massachusetts' "position in the intellectual sphere and to some extent in the industrial and commercial sphere as well" to "the severity of the physical challenge pre- sented by the harsh climate and stony soil." But one cannot even be sure of harshness in the New England climate, of the fierce cold of its winters and the fierce heat of its summers, since heat in December and snow in June are matters of record. Like the spiritual, the physical climate is one of doubt and un- certainties. Throughout all its history, Boston has been the capital of New England, a true capital, political, financial, industrial, ed- ucational, literary, defined, stunted, by-passed, preserved but not served by the great highways of the Hudson and the St. Lawrence. New England is geographically as well as philo- sophically centripetal. Boston has been a city for a long time, a great city for many years, but never a world city. Though it is a great port, though immigrants from all over the world have not ceased to stream in to it, its cultural tradition so far has proved stronger than any that have invaded it; unlike New York and San Francisco, which are civilized cities, Boston re- mains a city of superstition. Its development has been regional, inward, philosophic. Its people come from somewhere-from a city, from a state, from a region; they have a center and a hearth. They have a cult, they have shrines, they have a form, they have outward security. They are sheltered by the limita- tions which their history and their climate and their soil have set upon them; they are additionally sheltered by the limita- tions they have set upon themselves. And of this earth, this</page><page sequence="15">WE COME TO BURY BOSTON 161 realm, this New England, Boston is the center and the symbol. Founded on a belief on a doubt of authority in a land of fragile and capricious beauty and petty and persistent discom- fort, in a climate of hope deferred, Boston's obelisk of purpose stands supported by an infinity of conflicting tensions, seeming so strong because it yields to all. "It is," said Robert Grant, "the hotbed of every fad in crea- tion and the most conservative place under the sun." Apparent- ly unmoved, it sways a little in the winds of all doctrines-and how many winds and how many doctrines have blown over it! Bounded by the Mystic and the Muddy, it still remains clear, matter-of-fact, precise. Typewriter ribbons are worn to dust in explanation of the paradox, and the legend to which each writer adds. Best-seller after best-seller plods over the well-trodden footnotes, obscur- ing their true direction. Over and over again the novelists and and historians repeat that Boston is dead; and still the mummy rolls a bright and watchful eye. Still out of the camphor closet come people of national or even world importance; still char- acters from this dusty charade in which people play at being their own ancestors have a contemporary usefulness compar- able to theirs. Again and again the new generation in the dy- nasty, the new number in the series, proves able to fill the old function: Adamses turn up in Washington; Lodges in Con- gress; Saltonstalls as lawmakers; Bradfords as governors; War- rens as doctors; Lowells as poets. In a world growing ever more weak from want of certainty and security, Boston as a symbol of both continues to be an idol. Americans come to worship there each according to his nature, with blows and blandishments, tears and laughter, love and loathing, admiration and scorn, and Boston, guyed up by its conflicts, moved by all, is moved by none. Boston has seen panics before this; Boston has never believed in the Great American Myth, and will not be shaken if it fails; Boston never confused education, opportunity, and freedom with democra- cy, and long ago abandoned the hope of human perfectibility,</page><page sequence="16">162 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY which briefly aroused it in the early nineteenth century. Built on known quicksands, prepared for eventual dissolution, un- alarmed, unsurprised, strong because of her accepted weak- nesses, certain because of her accepted doubts, unterrified be- cause of her accepted terrors, there she stands, there she still stands.</page></plain_text>
