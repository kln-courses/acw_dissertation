<plain_text><page sequence="1">The 96th Annual Meeting of the Archaeological Institute of America The 96th Annual Meeting of the Archaeological Institute of America was held in conjunction with the 126th Annual Meeting of the American Philological Association in Atlanta, Georgia, on 27-30 December 1994. On 29 December, preceding the 116th Meeting of the Council of the Archaeological Institute of America, James Russell, President, presented the Institute's 30th annual Gold Medal for Distinguished Archaeological Achievement to Emeline Hill Richardson and the 14th Pomerance Award for Scientific Contributions to Archae- ology to Robert D. Maddin,James D. Muhly, and Tamara Stech. Stephen L. Dyson, First Vice President, presented the sixth annual James R. Wiseman Book Award to Frances F Berdan and Patricia Rieff Anawalt for The Codex Mendoza. In addition, the Archaeological Institute of America's Distinguished Service Award was presented to Anna Shaw Benjamin by President Russell. At the 116th Meeting of the AIA Council the following officers were elected: Stephen L. Dyson, President (two-year term); Nancy C. Wilkie, First Vice President (two-year term); Claire L. Lyons, Vice President for Pro- fessional Responsibilities (two-year term); Harrison Eiteljorg, II, Vice President for Publications (two-year term); Raymond L. Den Adel, Vice President for Societies (two-year term); and FrankJ. Wezniak, Treasurer (three-year term).

She was the first important American scholar in this field; her work The Etruscans: Their Art and Civilization (Chicago 1964) was the first comprehensive introduction to the Etruscans in this country, and as such was adopted as a textbook in many courses. Its influence has been strong, and in spite of the enor- mous increase in data on the Etruscans over the past 30 years, some chapters remain the best introductory statement on certain aspects of Etruscan archaeology. Emeline Richardson was drawn to archaeology by the thought of all that remained to be discovered and all that remained to be accomplished in the study of ancient civilization. A bent for chronological analysis was manifest early in her study of geology (in which she received her A.B. from Radcliffe College in 1932), but she soon turned to the more humanistic science of Classical Archaeology (she received her Ph.D. from Radcliffe in 1939) and specifically to the Etruscans. Her specialty within the discipline is Etruscan sculpture, and she has published a number of significant studies in this area. She contributed to archaeological fieldwork with her prompt publication of architectural terracottas from the temples at Cosa (MAAR 27, 1960). Her Etruscan Votive Bronzes: Geometric, Orientalizing and Archaic (Mainz 1983), the fruit of studies she began in the 1930s at the suggestion of Bernard Ashmole ("This needs doing," he had told her), is the definitive corpus of this material. At present she is nearing completion of the second major installment of her life's work, on the Classical votive bronzes of the Etruscans. In her teaching career spanning 40 years, Emeline Richardson taught at Wheaton College, Yale University, the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University, Stanford University, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. She also served the profession as Trustee and Charles Eliot Norton Lecturer for the Archae- ological Institute of America (1977), and as Director of a seminar for college teachers held by the National Endowment for the Humanities at the American Academy in Rome in 1979. She was Classicist in Residence at the American Academy (1977), jointly with her husband Lawrence Richardson, jr, with whom she collab- orated in many ways to the enrichment of scholarship in both Etruscan and Roman studies. This generous scholar has done much for others. She performed a major service to Etruscan scholarship when she prepared for publication the manuscript left by Otto Brendel at his death on Etruscan Art (Harmonds- worth 1978). Professor Richardson edited the text, wrote most of the final section on the Hellenistic period, wrote all the footnotes for the book, and selected its more than 300 illustrations. Her name does not appear as author on the title page, but it is unlikely that we would have this book without her important collaboration. Another significant example of her dedication to working for others lies in her work on Greek and Roman dress. In 1966, when the Archaeological Institute of America was holding a fundraising drive, Professor Richardson raised money by staging a grand fashion show at Duke University called "The Descent of the Toga." For many years the slides of the costumes continued to be sold by the AIA for use in classrooms around the country. Emeline Hill Richardson has published on a wide range of topics in Etruscan studies, including Etruscan mirrors, language, small bronzes, dress, iconography, and religion. Her publications, old and new, continue to be influential, and it is fair to say that she is the dean of Etruscan studies in America today. For her pioneering achievements in this discipline, her admirer George Hanfmann once characterized her as a "heroine"; her selection for the Gold Medal for Distinguished Archaeological Achievement serves to confirm this status.</page><page sequence="3">1995] THE 96TH ANNUAL MEETING 297 POMERANCE AWARD OF THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA FOR SCIENTIFIC CONTRIBUTIONS TO ARCHAEOLOGY ROBERT D. MADDIN, JAMES D. MUHLY, AND TAMARA STECH It would be difficult to find a better example of creative synergy in archaeological science than the archaeo- metallurgical research of Robert Maddin, James Muhly, and Tamara Stech at the University of Pennsylvania between 1974 and 1984. In this decade they fused historical, archaeological, geological, chemical, and metal- lurgical evidence into a steady stream of papers that transformed our understanding of the origins of metal- lurgy, the nature of Bronze Age metal production and trade, and the transition from bronze to iron. For these and subsequent achievements in the study of ancient metallurgy, we honor them with the 14th Pomerance Award. Robert Maddin received his Ph.D. in metallurgy from Yale University in 1948 and had a distinguished career in physical metallurgy and crystal physics at Johns Hopkins University and then at the University of Penn- sylvania, where he was Director of the School of Metallurgy from 1955 to 1972. James Muhly was appointed as Lecturer in the Department of Oriental Studies at the University of Pennsylvania in 1969, the year in which he received his Ph.D. in Near Eastern archaeology from Yale University. Muhly's dissertation (published in 1973 as Copper and Tin: The Nature of the Metals Trade in the Bronze Age) was a landmark publication in the history of metallurgy, providing a bold synthesis of the historical, archaeological, and geological evidence for the sources of tin in the Early Bronze Age of the Near East, Levant, and Anatolia. Muhly's work caught the attention of Maddin, and in 1974 their first joint paper appeared in the Journal of Metals. In that year Tamara Stech joined the program as Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering. She was one of the first to have formal training in both the humanities (a Ph.D. in Near Eastern archaeology, awarded by Bryn Mawr College in 1973) and in science. American research on ancient metallurgy had until then been largely confined to the study of belles pieces in art museums. The University of Pennsylvania program was the first in North America to undertake system- atic examination of assemblages of metals from archaeological sites. With major funding from the National Science Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities, they undertook studies of the metals from sites in Cyprus, Sardinia, Egypt, Israel, Anatolia, the Aegean, and Thailand, and of the cargoes of metal ingots from the Bronze Age shipwrecks at Cape Gelidonya and Ulu Burun. Their publications integrate chemi- cal and metallurgical analyses with archaeological and historical data, and have substantially enriched our understanding of technological innovation and organization, of the economic and social significance of early metallurgy, and of the growth of long-distance trade in the lands around the Mediterranean. This remarkably productive partnership dissolved when Dr. Maddin retired in 1984, but so much data had been generated by the project that publications continue to appear in the 1990s. Each of the three former partners has subsequently made substantial independent contributions to our understanding of ancient metallurgy. Dr. Maddin is not one to let the grass grow under his feet. Among his activities in "retirement" were the Honorary Directorship of the Center for Archaeological Research and Development at Harvard Uni- versity from 1985 through 1987, the editing of a major volume on early metallurgy (The Beginnings of the Use of Metals and Alloys, 1988), and a Humboldt Fellowship to study Roman mining technology in Germany. Dr. Muhly launched, with R.H. Dyson, the Mesopotamian Metals Project in 1985, and has written extensively on Bronze Age trade and on the long-running controversy over early sources of tin. Dr. Stech founded the re- spected journal Archeomaterials and was its editor from 1987 through 1992. We honor them today for significantly advancing our knowledge of the role that metallurgy has played in the development of civilizations, for their roles in developing appropriate scientific methods for archaeology, and for their intellectual productivity. But above all we honor them for demonstrating that interdisciplinary research differs from, and is superior to, multidisciplinary research in archaeology.</page><page sequence="4">298 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 99 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA JAMES R. WISEMAN BOOK AWARD FRANCES F. BERDAN AND PATRICIA RIEFF ANAWALT The Archaeological Institute of America is proud to honor Frances E Berdan and Patricia Rieff Anawalt for their monumental publication of The Codex Mendoza (University of California Press, Berkeley and London 1992). These four volumes - containing interpretation, description, facsimile, and transcriptions and translations - combine expert codicological and iconographic study with informative and stimulating ethnohistorical and archaeological analysis. Mobilizing a truly interdisciplinary team of authors (H.B. Nicholson, Wayne Ruwet, Bruce Barker-Benfield, Kathleen Stewart Howe, Elizabeth Hill Boone, and Edward Calnek) and contributing major chapters themselves, Berdan and Anawalt approach the Codex Mendoza, which records the domain of Metocuhzoma II for the instruction of King Charles V (for whom the pictorials were translated into Spanish) and is now in the Bodleian Library, from a wealth of different vantage points, never losing sight of the central importance of the document for art history, history, and archaeology. The Codex Mendoza contains precious information - ideologically shaped, to be sure - about forms of life in the Aztec empire immediately before the incursion of Cortez. Although replicating, in part, information known from other sources, the Codex has many intriguing, even unique features, and the editors have succeeded in establishing its art- and ethnohistorical importance. Throughout they have been very well served by their publishers, obviously committed to the high- est standards in reproduction and book production. Berdan and Anawalt have thought carefully about the needs and interests of many readers and they and their publishers have impressively realized their goal. In addition to an exemplary page-by-page description of the manuscript itself (volume II), the authors consider its "hybrid" style- European conventions of natural- ism were combined with indigenous iconic strategies of visual communication - and examine its status as a "victory chronicle"; assess its records of tribute and, more broadly, of Aztec life; address and imaginatively resolve questions of authorship and craftsmanship; and consider glyphic and graphic forms and icons as well as costumes and other paraphernalia depicted. Coupled with the facsimile (volume III) and transcription/ translation (volume IV), this level of detail and interpretive contextualizing vastly enriches the reader-viewer's experience of the manuscript. For serious specialists, the edition will be a major source of data and suggestive insights for decades to come.</page><page sequence="5">1995] THE 96TH ANNUAL MEETING 299 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA DISTINGUISHED SERVICE AWARD ANNA SHAW BENJAMIN The AIA Award for Distinguished Service goes today to Anna Shaw Benjamin, Professor Emerita of Douglass College, Rutgers University. But it probably comes as no surprise, at least to some in the audience, that the 1972 AIA Council earlier passed, by acclamation, a resolution recognizing Anna on her retirement as Editor of Archaeology magazine. It stressed her five-year editorship, describing her as selflessly diligent, imaginative, and determined. As was typical in those days, the editorship was unpaid, except for the honor, but it was dis- tinguished service of the first order. Many felt that, as Editor, Anna expanded the magazine's archaeological content, as she was to do later with the content of the archaeology program at Rutgers. By opening up the magazine to a broader world, she surely prepared her readers for the ecumenical Archaeology it has become. Our honoree received both undergraduate and graduate education at the University of Pennsylvania (M.A. 1947, Ph.D. 1955) and at the American School of Classical Studies at Athens. At the latter she held two fel- lowships, being a Thomas Day Seymour Fellow (1948/1949) and a Fulbright Fellow (1949/1950). She learned to turn a spade at the Agora and years later took it up again at the Aphrodisias excavations. Anna Benjamin commenced her devoted teaching career in 1951, as Instructor in Classical Languages and Humanities atJuniata College, a small institution in Pennsylvania, which she left for the University of Missouri- Columbia after receiving her Ph.D. in 1955. There, over almost a decade, she moved from Instructor in Classics and Archaeology to Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, Professor, and Chair. When Douglass College beckoned, she came as Professor (1964) and over the years until her retirement in 1987, she served as Chair, and Graduate Director in the Department, and developed an innovative program in archaeology that received approval by the state of New Jersey. Rutgers awarded her a number of grants and fellowships and, although retired, she presently serves as Coadjunct Professor, substituting on occasion for faculty at both Rutgers and Drew Universities. To say that she was popular with her students is an understatement; the better word former AIA President Martha Sharp Joukowsky used is "adored"! To return to the AIA: Anna Benjamin served many years on the Governing Board, organized an important symposium for the 1980 Annual Meeting, "Archaeology: Reason or Revelation?," and in 1990 was appointed Chair of the Publications Committee, charged with reactivating the Monographs program. Anna and the com- mittee began this difficult process, and when the first monograph in the new series, Nick Eiteljorg's The Entrance to the Athenian Acropolis before Mnesicles, was accepted, she commenced a labor above and beyond the call of duty. Anna took on the full editing job, selected the book designers, always aware that the Eiteljorg volume would be the model for the series. She advised, directed, and consulted with the author and designers over and over until the job was done, even though her position as Chair and committee member had been con- cluded. Incoming Chair, Ernestine S. Elster, working to organize the entire publication process, accepted this truly distinguished service with enormous gratitude. Indeed, at this meeting we can all see the results of Anna's diligence in the first monograph of the new series. To cap it off, Anna Shaw Benjamin took on the daunting task of editing the papers of a colloquium from the New Orleans Annual Meeting. This volume, Recent Excavations in Israel: A View to the West, by Seymour Gitin and seven colleagues, has become the first number in the new Colloquium and Conference Papers series. Anna said the Gitin manuscript was accepted while she headed the Monographs Committee and she considered it her responsibility to see it through. And so she has, admirably. In academia we are all challenged by research, but some of us are drawn even more to teaching. In Anna's case the exciting opportunity of introducing young minds to a multidimensional world drew her talents to the fore. Colleagues and students remember her as stimulating, open, and hard-working. To the AIA publi- cations units of Archaeology, the Monographs New Series, and the Colloquium and Conference Papers she gave dis- tinguished service, and her best editorial skills with humor and patience. Anna Shaw Benjamin, the AIA is proud to present this Distinguished Service Award and thanks you for your commitment, enthusiasm, and generosity of spirit; we feel fortunate to have received some of your gifts.</page><page sequence="6">300 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 99 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA CODE OF PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS Preamble This Code applies to those members of the AIA who play an active, professional role in the recovery, care, study, or publication of archaeological material, including cultural resources located under water. Within the Institute they enjoy the privileges of organizing sessions and submitting papers for the Annual Meetings, of lecturing to local societies, participating in the AIA committees that shape and direct the discipline, partic- ipating in the placement service, and of being listed in the Directory of Professionals in Archaeology. Along with those privileges come special responsibilities. Our members should inform themselves about and abide by the laws of the countries in which they live and work. They should treat others at home and in the field with respect and sensitivity. As primary stewards of the archaeological record, they should work actively to preserve that record in all its dimensions and for the long term; and they should give due consid- eration to the interests of others, both colleagues and the lay public, who are affected by the research. The AIA recognizes that archaeology is a discipline dealing, in all its aspects, with the human condition, and that archaeological research must often balance competing ethical principles. This Code of Professional Standards does not seek to legislate all aspects of professional behavior, and it realizes the conflicts embedded in many of the issues addressed. The Code sets forth three broad areas of responsibility and provides examples of the kinds of considerations called for by each. It aims to encourage all professional archaeologists to keep ethical considerations in mind as they plan and conduct research. I. Responsibilities to the Archaeological Record Professional archaeologists incur responsibilities to the archaeological record- the physical remains and all the associated information about those remains, including those located under water. 1) Professional archaeologists should adhere to the Guidelines of the AIA general Code of Ethics (see AJA 95 [1991] 285) concerning illegal antiquities in their research and publications. 2) The purposes and consequences of all archaeological research should be carefully considered before the beginning of work. Approaches and methods should be chosen that require a minimum of damage to the archaeological record. Although excavation is sometimes the appropriate means of research, archaeological survey, study of previously excavated material, and other means should be considered before resort is made to excavation. 3) The recovery and study of archaeological material from all periods should be carried out only under the supervision of qualified personnel. 4) Archaeologists should anticipate and provide for adequate and accessible long-term storage and cura- torial facilities for all archaeological materials, records, and archives. 5) Archaeologists should make public the results of their research in a timely fashion, making evidence available to others if publication is not accomplished within a reasonable time. 6) All research projects should contain specific plans for conservation, preservation, and publication from the very outset, and funds should be secured for such purposes. II. Responsibilities to the Public Because the archaeological record represents the heritage of all people, it is the responsibility of profes- sional archaeologists to communicate with the general public about the nature of archaeological research and the importance of archaeological resources. Archaeologists also have specific responsibilities to the local com- munities where they carry out research and fieldwork, as well as to their home institutions and communities. Archaeologists should be sensitive to cultural mores and attitudes, and be aware of the impact research and fieldwork may have on a local population, both during and after the work. Such considerations should be taken into account in designing the project's strategy. 1) Professional archaeologists should be actively engaged in public outreach through lecturing, popular writing, school programs, and other educational initiatives. 2) Plans for fieldwork should consider the ecological impact of the project and its overall impact on the local communities. 3) Professional archaeologists should not participate in projects whose primary goal is private gain.</page><page sequence="7">1995] THE 96TH ANNUAL MEETING 301 4) For field projects, archaeologists should consult with appropriate representatives of the local community during the planning stage, invite local participation in the project, and regularly inform the local community about the results of the research. 5) Archaeologists should respect the cultural norms and dignity of local inhabitants in areas where archae- ological research is carried out. 6) The legitimate concerns of people who claim descent from, or some other connection with, cultures of the past must be balanced against the scholarly integrity of the discipline. A mutually acceptable accom- modation should be sought. III. Responsibilities to Colleagues Professional archaeologists owe consideration to colleagues, striving at all times to be fair, never plagiarize, and give credit where due. 1) Archaeologists involved in cooperative projects should strive for harmony and fairness; those in positions of authority should behave with consideration toward those under their authority, while all team members should strive to promote the success of the broader undertaking. 2) The principal investigator(s) of archaeological projects should maintain acceptable standards of safety and ascertain that staff members are adequately insured. 3) Professional archaeologists should maintain confidentiality of information gleaned in reviewing grant proposals and other such privileged sources. 4) Professional archaeologists should not practice discrimination or harassment based on sex, religion, age, race, national origin, disability, or sexual orientation; project sponsors should establish the means to eliminate and/or investigate complaints of discrimination or harassment. 5) Archaeologists should honor reasonable requests from colleagues for access to materials and records, preserving existing rights to publication, but sharing information useful for the research of others. Scholars seeking access to unpublished information should not expect to receive interpretive information if that is also unpublished and in progress. 6) Before studying and/or publishing any unpublished material, archaeologists should secure proper per- mission, normally in writing, from the appropriate project director or the appointed representative of the sponsoring institution and/or the antiquities authorities in the country of origin. 7) Scholars studying material from a particular site should keep the project director informed of their prog- ress and intentions; project directors should return the courtesy. 8) Members of cooperative projects should prepare and evaluate reports in a timely and collegial fashion.</page><page sequence="8">THE 96TH ANNUAL MEETING ABSTRACTS OF PAPERS The abstracts of the papers appear in the order of presentation and are followed by an alphabetical index of authors. SESSION I A: COLLOQUIUM: BODY IMAGE AND GENDER SYMBOLISM: WOMEN, DRESS, AND UNDRESS PEEKABOO TO COVER-UP IN 20,000 YEARS: WOMEN'S STATUS GARMENTS IN SOUTHEAST EUROPE: Eliza- beth Barber, Occidental College Archaeological evidence suggests that human-designed clothing (i.e., something beyond a pelt for warmth) began 20,000 years ago in Palaeolithic Europe to mark women's status - indicating not wealth but the ability and perhaps willingness to bear children. Because of the continued im- portance of childbirth, versions of this original garment (the "string skirt," which covers nothing) continued in use in Greece and other parts of Europe through the Stone, Bronze, and Iron Ages- as archaeological and literary evi- dence shows- and even to the present in rural areas, with garments for modesty eventually added underneath. Mari- tal status was so important that other marks of it devel- oped. Hairdos differentiating girls from women appear in Crete and the Balkans from the Bronze Age onward. Headdresses, too, marked status: Andromache rips off her marital headdress in despair upon seeing her husband dead. Accumulation of significant wealth in the Bronze Age led both sexes to mark status accordingly. Increased tech- nology for producing clothing made differentiation easy: dyed thread and (therefore) pattern weaves became avail- able. Cloths decorated with friezes of humans and ani- mals, attested in the Late Bronze Age, became the (expen- sive) prerogative of princesses and goddesses in the Iron Age - compare Athena's peplos, and paintings by Sophilos. Color marked status too. Most famous was Tyrian ("royal") purple, expensively processed from myriad sea-snails and soon denoting the luxurious wealth of upper classes. Saffron yellow, however, became the mark of women, ap- parently because women used saffron to ease menstrual cramps. We see these associations among Minoans, Greeks, and Romans. FEMALE BEAUTY AND MALE VIOLENCE IN EARLY ITAL- IAN SOCIETY:John Robb, University of Michigan Throughout Italian prehistory gender ideology was re- produced through the symbolism of the body, archaeo- logically visible in body imagery and related iconography in cave paintings, rock carvings, figurines, stelae, and burial goods. This material is useful for understanding male and female gender ideologies within Copper, Bronze, and Early Iron Age societies. Copper and Bronze Age statuary defines males through weaponry, a socially produced and circulated symbol, and females primarily through natural biological attributes. In Italy, female gender seems relatively unelaborated in this period; using the human body's symbolic potential, a culturally constructed capacity for male violence was tied to social recognition and helped articulate exchange, pro- duction, and authority. With social stratification in the Late Bronze/Early Iron Age, the semantic core of gender distinctions persisted, but key symbolisms shifted to domains where wealth al- lowed distinction within genders. Male symbolism shifted from hunting to warfare, supporting an ethos of military aristocracy. For females, statues and grave goods display a great variety of finery, suggesting that an ideology of beauty was implemented via ostentation. Spinning and weaving provided a female task symbolically equivalent to male warfare, possibly with associations of seclusion and chastity. As female gender symbolisms, these were am- biguous: they both created valued positions for females and contained them within the values of male society. FUGITIVE NUDES: THE WOMAN ATHLETE: Gloria Ferrari Pinney, University of Chicago The idea that there existed in Athens initiation rituals for female children comparable to those of the males rests largely on the evidence of the "Brauron krateriskoi," on which are painted scenes of girls in a sanctuary, engaged in races or in choral performances (collected, with bibli- ography, by R. Hamilton, Hesperia 58 [1989] 449-72). These images are exceptional in showing female age classes- as though they were males-- and in having the older ones race naked. As for the boys, nudity here has been taken as an "initiatory costume," indicating that females too reach "adult" status of a sort, by performing the ritual of the arktos (scholia to Ar. Lys. 645). The general assumption that the krateriskoi refer to real events, whether the arktos or other activities, is question- able, however. While they may be expected to address con- temporary concerns, the pictures are not an open window onto what went on at Brauron, but representations. As such, they correspond not to reality, but to other representations; and they may be narrative, telling a story that has its own time and place. An examination of literary imagery reveals that, in ac- tuality, the notion of the nude female athlete provokes scorn and derision (as in Pl. Resp. 5.452a-b). In Plato's dialogues, however, we are also shown where this naked woman may be contemplated with a straight face: the utopian city of the future (Leg. 8.833c-d), and its paradigm, primitive Athens (Ti. 23-24; Criti. 110-11). One richer scene, on a red-figure krateriskos, locates the action precisely in the legendary past, by including a fleecy bear in the context of the race of maidens. The bear anchors the picture to a specific narrative context, that of the foundation legend for the arktos: the aition according to which that festival was founded in atonement for the killing of a bear dear 303</page><page sequence="9">304 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 99 to Artemis. The vases, then, refer to a state of things that preceded, and was radically changed by, the institution of the arktos. They explain why a female display of nudity that would signal a state of equality with men has no place in fifth-century Athens, although it may be contemplated from a safe distance -in a different place, such as Sparta, or in a faraway time, such as the future and the primi- tive past. NAKED AND LIMBLESS: LEARNING ABOUT THE FEMI- NINE BODY IN ANCIENT ATHENS:Joan Reilly, Bryn Mawr College An image that appears on some Athenian grave monu- ments during the Classical period depicts a young or adolescent girl holding a figure of a small naked female that is either fully limbed, or more often, without lower legs and lower arms. Terracotta and even marble objects that match these figures have been found in tombs and sanctuaries. These figures are called "dolls" in most interpretations. In one view, the "doll," due to its role in premarital dedi- cations, marks the girl as having died agamos, unmarried. Another view is that the image sends a message about her youthful innocence. The nudity and truncated form, however, are extraor- dinary, because they reveal and emphasize a mature fe- male body. Are these figures dolls? This paper proposes that they are not toys, but are votives. The truncated form provides the clue. It can be demonstrated that such figures are anatomical votives, objects tied to the worship of heal- ing gods. This imagery is evidence for social practices that ad- dressed fears about a girl's development into a woman, fears that are documented in ancient medical texts. The figures are dedications that will help the girl attain a healthy fe- male body that produces and nourishes children. In dedi- cating her votive she probably learned appropriate attitudes toward her body and sexuality, and she participated in socio- religious customs designed to develop her body as well as her character into correct feminine lines, even in her few years of life. MAKING A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE: GENDER, ASYMME- TRY, AND THE GREEK NUDE: Nanette Salomon, Col- lege of Staten Island/City University of New York From an unauthorized "outsider" position, this paper disassembles the asymmetrical constructions of masculin- ity and femininity created and "naturalized" by the most prestigious form of Greek art, the monumental nude. From Archaic to Late Classical times, the sculpted male nude youth was developed as a primary expression of the Greek ideal in "nature" and in art. The collaborative force of generations of Greeks perfected the "naturalness" of anatomy and stance projected by this warrior/athlete model. His history does not depend upon a single artist, but on Greek culture in its entirety. Similarly, his homoerotic sen- suality is not attributable to any single part but communi- cated through his entire form. By contrast, the female nude was created in Late Clas- sical antiquity by Praxiteles. His Knidian Aphrodite has her right hand to her pubis, a pose called "pudica" or "mod- est." This paper documents how this gesture, together with her other body language, communicates fear of a suddenly heard presence and the implicit danger and violence threat- ening her as a consequence. Praxiteles created the image of a woman on display whose primary characteristic is that she does not wish to be seen. As a feminine sexuality she is defined and "naturalized" by her psychic and social differ- ence from masculinity. I address these asymmetrical sexualities and their func- tion in the production of power hierarchies, and show how Praxiteles' formulation of femininity as sexualized and fe- tishized becomes the standard for the female nude, just as the complete sensual male youth as masculinity prevailed throughout Western European art and history. THE CALCULUS OF VENUS: NUDE PORTRAITS OF ROMAN WOMEN: Eve D'Ambra, Vassar College Nude portraits of women, a peculiarly Roman innova- tion, represented exemplary matrons in the first through the third centuries A.D. of the Roman Empire. The works, individualized portrait heads combined with full-length figures adapted from well-known statuary types of Aphro- dite, depicted both empresses and women of the lower so- cial orders, although the latter are the focus of this paper. Many of these portrait statues, juxtaposing the heads of mature women with frankly erotic bodies, adorned tombs of deceased women for whom the identification with Venus conveyed the moral authority of the wife and mother. Hen- ning Wrede (Consecratio in Formam Deorum, Mainz 1981) has catalogued the Venus portraits and analyzed their social context among the freedmen and freedwomen of Rome in the Early Empire, but the question of the female nude, its evocation of Venus in particular, and the meaning of the fertile female body are not discussed. In this paper the transformation of Aphrodite into Venus as a model for moral matrons is traced through women's cults and imperial propaganda honoring the mother of Aeneas. Gyne- cological texts and physiognomic theory offer images of the fertile female body and its proper functions that are pertinent to the nude. The paper concludes that the nude portraits project an image of domesticated sexuality: the self-control implied by the features of the portrait heads stabilizes the erotic bodies. SESSION I B: COLLOQUIUM: GREEK PRES- ENCE OR GREEK PRESENTS? THE MEANING OF PRE-HELLENISTIC GREEK IMPORTS IN THE LEVANT GREEK MERCENARIES IN PHOENICIA: NEW EVIDENCE FROM TEL KABRI: W-D. Niemeier, Archaiologisches Institut, Universitit Heidelberg</page><page sequence="10">1995] THE 96TH ANNUAL MEETING 305 The Israeli-German excavations conducted under the joint directorship of A. Kempinski (Tel Aviv University) and W.-D. Niemeier (Heidelberg University) at Tel Kabri (Western Galilee) have revealed, i.a., parts of a fortified Phoenician settlement that was destroyed by the Babylo- nians in the early sixth century B.C. In the destruction level, a considerable amount of im- ported East Greek pottery has been found together with local Phoenician pottery. We have fragments of Wild Goat style pottery, Ionian cups, transport amphoras, and coarse- ware cooking pots made of clay containing much mica, whereas the local wares do not have mica at all. Thus, these cooking pots were also imported. During 1994 the clays of the Greek pottery imports from Tel Kabri were analyzed and the results concerning their provenance are discussed in this paper. Do these finds of Greek pottery at Tel Kabri represent "Greek presence or Greek presents?" The decorated pot- tery alone could be interpreted as "Greek presents"' but not the cooking pots. These indicate that Greeks actually lived within the settlement of Tel Kabri. What was their function? In the ancient sources we mainly find two kinds of Greeks in the Levant: merchants and mercenaries. Since Tel Kabri is not a harbor settlement but an inland fortified settlement at the border between the Acco plain (the Kabul of the Bible, belonging to the kingdom of Tyre) and the highland of Galilee, the second solution seems the more likely one: the Greeks at Kabri were Greek mercenaries employed by Tyre, for which there is evidence in the ancient sources. GREEK POTTERY FROM ASHKELON, ISRAEL: HINTS OF PRESENCE? Charles M. Adelman, University of Northern Iowa As ceramist for the Leon Levy Expedition to Ashkelon, I have identified at our south coastal harbor site thousands of Greek and East Greek sherds (the latter often by way of the visible mica). Many sorts of vessels are represented: some as containers for traded goods; some for everyday functions; most decorated in a simple fashion, some elab- orately. Ashkelon echoes the same shift in trade patterns evidenced at other eastern Mediterranean sites with, e.g., the Corinthian and Chian wares of the late Iron Age being largely replaced by Attic wares during the Persian period. But do these shifts represent the choices of resident pop- ulations? Should we allow the mere presence of Greek cook- ing pots to conjure the presence of Greeks? Should we not examine the relationship between the Greek/East Greek and the other wares? Ashkelon has the quantitative evidence to investigate this problem. For example, of the hundreds of thousands of Persian-period pottery fragments, only two Greek cook- ing potsherds were found. In one typical layer at the site, the Attic material - as interesting as it is - only accounts for ca. 0.4% of the total pottery: the bulk is Phoenician. I focus on the contents and statistics of this large, im- portant layer as representative of the period, discussing a class of so-called "East Greek" decorated banded bowls abundant at the site and a selection of Greek finds. As tempt- ing as it is to read a Greek presence from these materials (and, in fact, believing that there was some Greek pres- ence at the site), the testimony from the ceramic evidence alone is, for the most part, weak. THE GREEK IMPORTS IN PALESTINE: ASPECTS OF FUNC- TION AND DECORATION: Robert Wenning, Seminar fiur Zeit- und Religionsgeschichte des Alten Testa- ments, Miinster In order to understand the significance of imported Attic Greek pottery found in Persian-period sites in Israel and Jordan, areas of the ancient world not colonized by Greeks, one must investigate aspects of distribution, context, quan- tity, shape/type, and decoration. The population of Persian- period Palestine comprised several different cultural tra- ditions and influences. Attribution of the Greek imports to particular population groups raises the question of what specific functions these imports served within each group. The shapes of the vessels and the quantity of the vari- ous types contribute to an answer. The selection of types compared with those found at Greek sites show differences that illustrate trade and market and define the functions of the imports as well. The decoration of the vessels also contributes to a better understanding of function and pro- vides at least one possible reason why these vessels were in demand. Although the majority of imports were black wares and vessels with non-figurative decoration, some of the vessels decorated with "narrative pictures" exhibit a special selection of subjects that are especially appropriate to the traditions of the Phoenician-dominated population of the coast and to the centers with intercultural contacts. Subjects found among other groups with stronger local traditions show a different pattern. Very rarely does the archaeological context (e.g.,favissae) illuminate the func- tion of the finds. EAST GREEK OR EASTERN LEVANTINE? SIMPLE PAINTED DECORATED POTTERY IN THE EASTERN LEVANT DUR- ING THE ACHAEMENID PERIOD: Gunnar Lehmann, Deutsches Evangelisches Institut fuir Altertums- wissenschaft des Heiligen Landes, Jerusalem Among the decorated finewares of Syria and Palestine during the Achaemenid period is a widely distributed group of pottery with simple painted patterns on a burnished clay surface, here referred to as "Simple Painted" pottery. The repertoire of the pottery forms consists of bowls, table amphoras,jugs, and craters. This group is frequently found in southeast Turkey, Cyprus, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, and northern Egypt. It has been called "East Greek" without explaining or tracing its distribution in the Aegean. This paper defines and describes the group with its forms and decorative patterns. I explain why these vessels form a coherent group and discuss the group's distribution and chronological development, suggesting further research on non-Attic finewares during the Achaemenid period in the Eastern Levant.</page><page sequence="11">306 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 99 While the "Simple Painted" group is related to certain productions in Ionia, I suggest here that this pottery was produced somewhere in the Eastern Levant, probably in Cyprus or along the Syrian coast. It almost never appears in the Aegean and the term "East Greek" should therefore not be used for this group of pottery. The "Simple Painted" group should be seen as locally produced fineware that successfully competed with the ubiquitous Attic imports in the Eastern Levant. GREEKS AND GRAVES IN THE COASTAL LEVANT: Jane C. Waldbaum, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Greek pottery is found at many sites in the coastal Levant (Syria, Phoenicia, Palestine) and its appearance has often been used to claim Greek settlement. While most of this pottery comes from occupation remains, some of it is found in tombs. Who were the occupants of these tombs, and can we identify Greek burials in this region with certainty? Tomb architecture, contents, and burial customs vary. In tombs dated to the Persian period (sixth-fourth cen- turies B.C.), Greek pottery may be found with either cre- mations or inhumations in simple pits, cist graves, or rock- cut shaft graves with multiple chambers. Most of the grave types, however, are local in character. At Atlit, for example, shaft graves containing Greek pottery were identified by the excavator as belonging to Greek mercenaries (C.N.Johns, QDAP 2 [1933] 56-57). The tomb types, however, were Phoe- nician and the contents included Egyptian, Phoenician, and local objects as well as Greek. At Tall Sukas terracotta rooftiles were found in possible association with some burials leading the excavator to suggest Greek practice (P.J. Riis, Sukas VI [Copenhagen 1979] 31). Here too, how- ever, contents of the graves were mixed and the Greek pottery types were limited, comprising primarily drinking paraphernalia. Examination of the tomb types, burial customs, and tomb contents and distribution among sites leads to the conclu- sion that there are no unequivocally Greek tombs anywhere along the Syria-Palestine coast. SESSION I C: THE ROMAN EAST EXCAVATIONS IN THE TEMPLE OF ZEUS MEGISTOS AT DURA-EUROPOS, 1994: Susan B. Downey, Univer- sity of California, Los Angeles The 1994 excavations in the Temple of Zeus Megistos at Dura-Europos had two goals: identification in the south section of the block of the elements used by Frank Brown in his reconstruction of its phases; and excavation of an area between the temple facade and two altars on the east side of the street in front of it. The complex history of the southern part of the block, originally a house, later part of the temple, was clarified. The altars on the east were apparently not visible at the time of the Yale excavations, but their placement approxi- mately on the axis of the principal sanctuary unit of the temple in the second and succeeding periods suggests a relationship between the two. This area, largely untouched by earlier excavations, provides undisturbed stratigraphy. A trench from the temple facade to the east of the altars revealed a hard-packed surface of earth, small stones, and decayed mudbrick, characteristic of street surfaces at the site; holes at irregular intervals would have held scaffold- ing for buildings. In front of the temple a gypsum paving was laid above this road surface following a period of aban- donment. The situation around the altars is more com- plex. A wall built after a period of abandonment was de- molished for the construction of the south altar and a building across the street. Thus, the temple and altars were not the first buildings on the site. This raises doubts about the Hellenistic date proposed for the first phase of the temple. EXCAVATIONS IN THE SANCTUARY AREA AT TEL DOR, ISRAEL: Andrew Stewart, University of California, Berkeley A team from the University of California, Berkeley, work- ing in the sanctuary area (F) at Tel Dor from 1986 to the present has reexamined the results of John Garstang's ex- cavations of 1923-1924, briefly and unsatisfactorily pub- lished in the Bulletin of the British School of Archaeology at Jerusalem 4 and 6 (1924) 35-47 and 65-75. We have estab- lished a relative chronology of the remains; revealed the sanctuary's southern entrance and documented its history and environs; discovered the main, central entrance and cleared a third, northern entrance; and surveyed, cata- logued, cleaned, and partially excavated the ruins of the huge Ionic "temple" itself. Contrary to Garstang's belief that the complex was early Hellenistic in date, we can now show that it is Roman (sec- ond century A.D.). We are still not absolutely certain that the Ionic building is a temple; if so, it is the largest pagan example in Israel and uncanonical in form. Soundings in- side it have revealed stratified architectural remains dat- ing back to the Iron Age. The latest of these, part of a com- plex Late Hellenistic structure with niches apparently intended for cult objects, was incorporated into the great Ionic building and may have continued in use in some form after its construction. THE PROMONTORY PALACE AT CAESAREA, ISRAEL: THE 1993 AND 1994 SEASONS: Barbara Burrell, Univer- sity of Cincinnati, and Kathryn Gleason, Uni- versity of Pennsylvania Recent work by the University of Pennsylvania Excava- tions at Caesarea has revealed further evidence for the form, date, and possible functions of the Promontory Palace on the city's southernmost cape. New finds show that it was approached through a monumental colonnaded courtyard, which mediated between Caesarea's theater and stadium, and may have served as a reception area; soil study may indicate a peristyle garden. A long rectangular caldarium with mosaic floor over stone suspensurae was installed on the courtyard's north side, and may have been connected with a series of plastered pools and a rock-cut underground chamber.

Intact de- posits of lamps and sigillata-style pottery tend to confirm an initial Herodian date. Subsequent alterations were made throughout the Roman Imperial period, with small pri- vate bathing suites replacing one another as they went out of use; bricks with the stamp of the 10th Legion have been found in situ. The large-scale and strategic placement of the building offered direct access to the sea and controlled entry from the adjacent theater and stadium built by Herod the Great for the pentaeteric games he founded in honor of the em- peror Augustus. The position of the palace may be asso- ciated with other such complexes in the Late Hellenistic Mediterranean, and may even serve as one of the prece- dents for later developments on the Palatine in Rome. JEWS AND CHRISTIANS IN A LATE ROMAN CEMETERY AT BETH GUVRIN, ISRAEL: Jodi Magness, Tufts University, and Gideon Avni, Israel Antiquities Authority In 1985, a Late Roman cemetery was discovered by archaeologists near the Ahinoam Cave, approximately half a kilometer south of the site of Beth Guvrin (ancient Eleutheropolis) in Israel. The following year, the cemetery was surveyed and mapped. Seventy-four burial caves were located, cut into the soft chalk of the rolling hills. Rescue excavations were conducted in several caves under the di- rection of Gideon Avni, Uzi Dahari, and Amos Kloner on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority. Most of the caves have a single room containing several burials, though some large complexes were also discovered. In a number of the simpler caves crosses were carved or painted on the walls, and in others, usually the more complex ones,Jewish sym- bols were found on the walls or on oil lamps inside. A total of 483 oil lamps or lamp fragments were recov- ered in the excavation of the Ahinoam Cave Cemetery. To- gether with the coins, they indicate that the cemetery was in use from the late second or third century through the first half of the eighth century. The evidence provided by the oil lamps suggests that, during this period of time, the religious orientation of the population using the cemetery changed. It seems that the initial burials made in the caves, from the late second to fourth centuries, wereJewish, while the burials of the fifth to mid-eighth centuries were Chris- tian. Thus, the oil lamps provide one piece of evidence for the transformation of the Ahinoam Cave Cemetery from a Jewish burial ground to a Christian one. PETRA: THE SOUTHERN TEMPLE PROJECT: Martha Sharp Joukowsky, Brown University The second season of excavation and survey of the South- ern Temple at Petra was held in 1994. This multidisci- plinary project seeks to understand the Southern Temple architecturally and interpret its relationship to its surround- ings. Under the auspices of the Jordanian Department of Antiquities, the 1994 Brown University expedition ex- amined further the canalization system found in 1993 in the temple forecourt, and determined the temple's archi- tectural plan after removing the overburden covering the structure. Before 1993, our first year of excavation, we wrote that "the Southern Temple . . . has never been excavated or studied." Our first days on site proved this not to be fact. And in September 1993, there was the surprise publica- tion in Syria 70 (1993) of a hypothetical temple plan re- ported by John P. Zeitler, who as part of a German team had surveyed and excavated the "Podium Temple" in 1989-1990. The German team suggests that the temple was divided into two main sections- a front propylaea build- ing with a double row of four large columns, plus a peri- style temple with six columns on the south and seven col- umns on each of the east and west flanks (the north face was uncertain). We have paused to consider this structure and its architectural plan. In our presentation we discuss and elucidate the temple architecture, as well as report on the findings of several other areas of the Southern Temple site excavated in 1994. ABILA OF THE DECAPOLIS 1994 EXCAVATIONS: W Harold Mare, Covenant Theological Seminary The Abila staff conducted its eighth season of excava- tion at Abila of the Decapolis, northern Jordan, from 11 June to 30 July 1994. The staff concentrated its work on the northern tell (Tell Abila), the southern tell (Umm el-'Amad), the civic center in the saddle depression between the two tells, and in the necropolis on the wadi slopes. Next to the Tell Abila church, a life-size, white marble statue of Artemis was found, no doubt belonging to an earlier Greek/Roman temple there, and its finding estab- lished more firmly that the church had been built on the foundations of the earlier temple. The excavation in the Tell Abila deep trench produced more evidence pointing to an extensive Middle/Early Bronze habitation at Abila. On Umm el-'Amad, excavation along the southern and northern outer walls of the seventh-century A.D. basilica uncovered further evidence of mosaic floors and auxiliary service rooms, and excavation at the nearby earlier church revealed that this latter structure was triapsidal. In the civic center, probing in the theater cavea uncov- ered a large statue niche and a large cache of glass goblets, pointing to a glassmaking installation. Excavation at the bath/nymphaeum complex uncovered three large settling tank vaults, and further excavation of the church down near the Roman bridge revealed that the structure was a cruciform one. Finally, the operation of the pottery kiln on the necropolis slope was further defined, and more of the looted Roman/Byzantine tombs were salvaged. TRADITIONS DIE HARD: THE CHANGING NATURE AND CONTINUED INFLUENCE OF EGYPTIAN RELIGION WITHIN A RURAL LANDSCAPE OF LATE ROMAN- EARLY CHRISTIAN EGYPT: Carla Goodnoh, Univer- sity of Michigan The centrality of the temple in the cultural landscape of pre-Ptolemaic Egypt has been fundamental to evalua- tions of Egyptian society. The temple fulfilled socioreli- gious, political, and economic functions that defined and reinforced the ideological and administrative basis of pharaonic rule and integrated various strata of society. By</page><page sequence="13">308 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 99 contrast, when assessing the influence and vitality of Egyptian religion under Ptolemaic and Roman rule, schol- ars have traditionally presented a picture of decline and dependency. In this scenario, the downward spiral began in the Ptolemaic period, was reinforced by crippling legal and economic blows under early Roman administration, and finally suffered an inevitable collapse in the wake of the early Christian church, in concert with an empire- wide economic and spiritual crisis in the third century. Most analyses of early Christianity in Egypt minimize the tenacity of traditional religion and argue that a decline in temple-based leadership "cleared" the way for Christian- ity as a social institution due to a weakening of communal organization and an end to popular religious expression and experience. This paper presents textual and archaeological evidence from the Fayum region to demonstrate that economic de- cline of temples in Late Antique Egypt does not signal an end to popular religious expression, ritual occasions, or the power of sacred spaces. Popular religious practices (fes- tivals, processions, and magic) and changing relationships within a sacred landscape continued to be socially inte- grative mechanisms and expressions of communal self- identity. This paper argues for a more nuanced portrait of early Egyptian Christianity, which incorporates an evolv- ing climate of religious adaptation, innovation, absorption, and transformation. SESSION I D: ARCHAIC AND CLASSICAL GREEK SCULPTURE MIMESIS IN ARCHAIC CHORAL POETRY: A GUIDE TO THE MEANING OF THE KORE TYPE: MaryJane Rein, Harvard University Archaic sculptural representations of women are mostly confined to the kore type, which renders richly costumed girls in a graceful, standing pose. Efforts to establish the meaning of the kore have focused on the basic alternative of whether a divine or mortal woman is represented. This ambiguity may, however, enhance the meaning behind the sculptural type. Choral poems, such as the Parthenia of Alcman, suggest that by means of song and dance bands of girls enacted Greek myths in the context of civic ritual. Through their performance and the process of mimesis, the participants in the chorus, especially the chorus leader, share in the qualities of the divinity whom they celebrate. The kore can be interpreted as a visual representation of the same set of cultural values as those expressed by lyric poetry. The carefully arranged costume, jewelry, and pose of the kore correspond to descriptions of the grace and beauty of the goddess whom the girls in the chorus seek to emulate. The gesture of pulling the skirt to the side, typical of many of the korai, is suggestive of the mimetic act of dancing integral to the choral performance. In the context of ritual, the moment for this civic recognition of a girl's beauty is reserved until she is ready for marriage. The kore may therefore be understood as an important document for assessing a key moment in the life of an aris- tocratic Greek woman. PHRASIKLEIA'S LrTUSES: Mary Stieber, West Chester University Discovered in 1972, the kore Phrasikleia by Aristion of Paros is not only one of the newest, most sensational, and least photographed attractions of the National Archaeo- logical Museum, Athens, but a unique addition to the small corpus of monumental Archaic female statues intended for funerary use. While there is no historical record of the young woman whose grave the statue marked beyond the statue base's famous epigrammatic inscription, the sculpted image itself may be counted a primary document of that missing record. Full of life and individuality, it appears to represent, within the technical and conceptual con- straints of its time, an aristocratic girl who was, by death, deprived of all that her status promised. A "portrait" such as this one is achieved as much through iconography as through physical likeness. This paper examines Phrasikleia's iconography, drawing on artistic and literary allusions to further the recent semiotic treatment by Jesper Svenbro (Phrasikleia:An Anthropology of Reading in Ancient Greece [Ithaca 1993] 8-23). Especially meaningful are the lotus buds that figure prominently among her accoutrements. The lotuses that are ubiquitous and powerfully symbolic in Egyptian art may have served as a source of inspiration, however incom- pletely their symbolism was understood or ultimately inter- preted. Their presence may also be a self-conscious pun on the Greek word XcoTtiapi meaning"flower" or, metaphor- ically, "fairest, choicest, best" (XoTriroiata and &amp;ttoXorico, by analogy, become, in Greek, "to cull the best"), alluding to the aristocratic background of the girl, her distinctive beauty, and her unfortunate lot. Phrasikleia's portrait is, then, an "iconographical likeness" that would have been perfectly comprehensible to the Archaic viewer unac- quainted with the photographic levels of realism in por- traiture to which the modern viewer is accustomed. SHORT ORDER: THE ORIGINS OF THE ATHENIAN IONIC CAPITAL: Elizabeth McGowan, Williams College Although not a primary center for the development of the Ionic order in the sixth century, Athens by 450 B.C. had produced a local form of Ionic capital with charac- teristics distinct from those of capitals of Ionia proper. Examples in monumental architecture include the capi- tals of the Athenian Stoa at Delphi and those of the Temple of Athena at Sounion. The Athenian capital differs from Eastern examples in two ways: 1) the decoration is painted more often than sculpted; and 2) the echinus is not the traditional torus decorated in relief with leaf-and-dart, but is in two degrees: the lower tier is a cyma reversa molding, the upper, a flat vertical band. Previous scholarship has not addressed the reason behind the change in echinus shape. The new capital appears to have been designed in the sculpture workshops on the Acropolis ca. 510-490 B.C. Smooth-faced painted capitals with torus-shaped echini were introduced to Athens by sculptors from the Cyclades where Ionic capitals were used as bases for kouroi. In Athens the change in echinus shape resulted from the change in the capital's function. The Attic capitals supported korai</page><page sequence="14">1995] THE 96TH ANNUAL MEETING 309 whose stance is more modest than that of striding kouroi, and thus demanded a shorter support surface. On the shortened capital the volutes are drawn close together, which, in turn, crowds the torus-form echinus. The new two-tiered echinus is the sculptor's elegant solution to the aesthetic problem of the overcrowded echinus. THE SCULPTURAL ORIGIN OF THE IONIC ORDER IN ATTICA: David A. Skoog, Bryn Mawr College The Ionic order first appeared in Athens in the middle of the sixth century B.C. in a series of votive columns on the Acropolis. These columns had very close affinities with the statues they bore, not only in the materials and tools used, but also in the motifs used to adorn both the capi- tals and the garments of the statues. This sharing of orna- mental motifs has previously been overlooked, because very few of the extant capitals have been successfully re- united with the votives they carried. The capitals, with their uncarved, painted surfaces and smooth planes, were kept relatively simple as a foil to the more richly carved and decorated statues they bore. In the motifs employed and the colors used, the statues and the capitals are closely linked. They formed a single visual unit, especially when the same ornamental motifs were repeated both in the garments of the statue and the abacus of the capital. With their horizontal orientation, the capi- tals served to separate the statues visually from the shafts of the columns, forming a base for the votives while rais- ing them to eye level or above. The elements shared by the capitals and the statues, as well as the exclusive votive function of the order, in- dicate that sculptors rather than architectural masons intro- duced and executed the Ionic order in Archaic Attica. This assertion is supported by the development of the Ionic order as a whole in the Archaic period. THE DEMISE OF THE ARCHAIC ATHENIAN FUNERARY MONUMENT: Karen E. Stears, University of Exeter This paper examines the evidence for the decline of the Archaic Attic sculpted funerary monument, both re- lief and freestanding. It assesses the validity of associations between both changes in the form of Archaic grave monu- ments and their eventual disappearance and the so-called post aliquanto sumptuary legislation restricting funerary monuments as described by Cicero (Leg. 2.64-65). The archaeological evidence for the funerary monu- ments in the last decades of the sixth century and the first decades of the fifth century B.C. is described. Evidence that fine-quality large-scale sculpted monuments were be- ing produced and erected down to ca. 480 B.C. is presented. The archaeological data are compared to the terminology of the Ciceronian text and the possibility that the passage refers to the disappearance of the Archaic monument is evaluated; in particular, hermae are equated with kouroi. Cicero's mention of public funeral orations is interpreted as dating the legislation to the 480s B.C., a date that would agree with the relative archaeological chronology. The Archaic sculpted funerary monument does appear to have been curtailed by the post aliquanto legislation be- tween ca. 490 and 480 B.C. The restrictive law was enacted by the emerging democracy in order to limit displays of conspicuous consumption within cemeteries by powerful aristocratic families in defiance of the emergent democratic ideological notions of social, political, and economic equality. TECHNICAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE PEDIMENTAL SCULPTURES FROM THE TEMPLE OF ZEUS AT OLYM- PIA, II: THE WEST PEDIMENT:John G. Younger, Duke University, and Paul Rehak, Loyola University, Chicago In this paper, the second of two on the pediments of the Temple of Zeus at Olympia (see AJA 98 [1994] 333-34), we concentrate on the west pediment centauromachy and discuss the evidence for ancient repairs: mortises, replace- ment figures, and what Pausanias saw. At least three phases of workmanship can be observed. The figures seem to have been installed unfinished. West figures B-U all preserve post-installation mortises in their backs. Since the corner figures A and V lack mortises, they may be later still. Apollo (L) has two kinds of mortises, suggesting two different stages of repair. Some severely damaged figures and groups may have been removed and cannibalized. The clasped two right hands now inserted over C and D cannot belong to these figures and must refer to a lost group; similarly, the drapery fragment inserted upside down as a patch in the shoulder of Lapith woman O must also come from another figure no longer extant. Finally, the notion that the pediment evolved considerably over time may help explain the problem of Pausanias's iden- tification of the central figure of the west pediment as the mortal hero Perithoos (5.10.8). Repairs to Apollo's badly broken lower legs may have removed his original plinth. In addition, his outstretched right arm, an integral part of the complete statue, undoubtedly broke off early, as its findspot, in front of the east facade, indicates (it is the only piece from a west figure to have been found on the other side of the temple). If Pausanias saw a short Apollo without his divine gesture, it would be understandable if he mistook him for the bridegroom Perithoos.

Stinehour, The Stinehour Press, and Karen Vellucci, University Museum, University of Pennsylvania This workshop is concerned with various aspects of the publication process: editing, production, printing and</page><page sequence="15">310 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 99 photography, and associated problems. House editorial rules cover everything from double-spacing footnotes to following spelling conventions. What are the obligations of the author and editor, what does an editor consider when preparing a manuscript, and what are the special problems of editing Classics manuscripts? Authors and pub- lishers have the same goal of seeing material in print, but misunderstandings can occur when authors are unclear about printing procedure. Each stage of production after acceptance-galley, page proof, and printed book-has its own problems. What should an author know? The printing of black-and-white halftones begins when the photograph is taken. The ultimate use of site and ob- ject photographs is for record-keeping and often for pub- lication. Many archaeological publications depend on photographs taken in difficult circumstances or on very old photographs. What can be done to make these and all other photographs legible and useful? Archaeological publications never go out of date; the need is to produce books that will last. Problems discussed include working with large detailed foldouts and sizing photographs. Important considerations are the limited audience, small print runs, and high retail price. Examples illustrate how various problems affect scheduling, pricing, and quality of production. SESSION I F: AIA/APA JOINT WORKSHOP THE CLASSICAL ATLAS PROJECT: PROGRESS AND PROS- PECTS: Richard J.A. Talbert, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill This workshop informs members of AIA and APA about the nature and progress of the Classical Atlas Project, and invites questions and discussion. The Project was fully launched in 1991, and is moving ahead on schedule for 1999 publication by Princeton University Press and Schol- ars Press. It represents a substantial first step toward rem- edying the disastrous lack of cartographic reference tools for the study of Greek and Roman civilization. The 168 folio-sized map pages are being compiled by 70 scholars worldwide. Among them they cover the entire classical world at two standard scales (1:1,000,000 and 1:500,000). In addition, there are five small-scale sweeps at 1:5,000,000, as well as close-ups of the environs of Athens, Byzantium/Constantinople, and Rome at 1:150,000. The de- tailed rendering of physical landscape derives from satellite- generated elements supplied by the Defense Mapping Agency; those at the 1:1,000,000 scale are available in digi- tal format. Cartographic design and production (wherever possible computerized) are by Donnelley Geosystems. Now that compilation work is well advanced, and in nu- merous instances even finished (according to staggered deadlines), members have the opportunity to examine maps at successive stages of preparation from physical base to proof, along with their accompanying texts, annotated gazetteer listings, and bibliography. Because the maps produced on computer will never need to be completely remade, the Atlas can be of lasting value for the forseeable future. Important matters for discussion, therefore, are the means by which these maps and their associated data should first be disseminated, and then re- vised periodically thereafter. SESSION II A: AIAIAPAJOINT COLLOQUIUM: THE MAPPING OF ANCIENT IBERIA THE TABULA IMPERIIROMANI AND THE STUDY OF TER- RITORY IN SPAIN:Javier Sdnchez-Palencia, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Madrid Since 1929, when Spainjoined the Tabula Imperii Romani (TIR) project, research on the territory of the Iberian penin- sula during the Roman period has progressed through several stages. Valuable contributions were first made by scholars working in the 1920s and '30s (Bosch Gimpera, Sainchez-Albornoz, G6mez Moreno, etc.), who laid the foundation for the first Spanish institutions devoted to the scientific study of history. Their work was marked by a synthetic viewpoint that permitted them to work effec- tively within the framework of the TIR proposed by its founder, O.G.S. Crawford; historicist principles inspired the project at that time. The Spanish maps produced during the '30s were but the "background," the physical frame- work upon which the main features of Romanization were plotted. Alongside the main urban settlement patterns articulated by the roads, we find mainly pre-Roman peoples. This emphasis on indigenous peoples was the result of dis- cussion at all levels about the role diversity or ethnic and linguistic complexity had played in the historical forma- tion of Spain. In the '40s, two main lines of research on the Hispanic territory developed: one, clearly connected to the German school of historical philology, was based on the first maps of Roman Spain elaborated at the time of the publication of CIL by H. Kiepert and E. Hiibner. Its programmatic proj- ect is the Iberische Landeskunde, especially the part deal- ing with geography and ethnography (A. Schulten) and the topographical investigations of the tribes and towns of an- cient Spain produced by A. Tovar. The other direction re- search took can be defined as the "defense of the national heritage." The production of regional archaeological sur- veys symbolizes this effort. Its scope went beyond the chrono- logical limits of the Roman period and had a clear "national- istic" goal: to build an archaeological inventory in order to protect the Spanish material heritage. Since the '40s, apart from minor contributions of limited regional or thematic character, there has been no global cartographic project encompassing all of Hispania Ro- mana. During the last two decades, however, the political evolution of Spain - the death of Franco and the rise of governmental autonomy- has had a great influence on re- search into territorial organization and settlement patterns of Hispania. New techniques have also been incorporated, although most of them have been directed at the study of cadasters, the relationship between settlements and the network of roads, and so on. Lastly, recent approaches (e.g., the investigation of"cultural landscapes") constitute a more</page><page sequence="16">1995] THE 96TH ANNUAL MEETING 311 global approach and provide useful tools to reach our goal, an integrated and complete cartographic view of Roman Spain. MAPPING SPAIN: INTEGRATION AND DIVERSITY: Adela Cepas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cien- tificas, Madrid The map of the northern part of the Iberian peninsula in the Tabula Imperii Romani is a complex image in both space and time. It reflects a concrete geographical reality upon which data of different types and from different time periods are presented. The historical goal was to elucidate diachronically the characteristic features of the Iberian peninsula under Roman rule. But taking into account both the chronological and topological diversity of the data used, the very success of integrating the different elements on only one map is itself an impediment to the understand- ing of the processes of transformation and change that are at work during so extensive a period. Nevertheless, this understanding can be achieved through analyses that inter- relate the various data. The different manifestations of the Roman presence serve as avenues of analysis of a historical process from the moment the work of identifying ancient topographic evidence with modern places has been completed. From a cartographic point of view, there are three basic elements that can be used to pinpoint this process: 1) settlement models that integrate units such as city, town, military camp, or mansio, as well as other forms of settlement that accen- tuate a greater degree of diversity (e.g., villa, native settle- ment); 2) temporal patterns of territorial occupation that can be understood as the result of the continuity, assimi- lation, or superposition of preexisting elements; and 3) the articulation of the territory observed in the network of roads in the administrative divisions. The roads pene- trate the various zones, while changes in the zones reflect either variations in the control system or alterations caused by processes of integration. Thus, the different facets of the Roman presence in Spain can form the basis of a criti- cal analysis of the historical process of integration. ETHNIC SPACES AND GEOGRAPHIC PERSPECTIVE: MAP- PING THE TURDETANI AND BASTETANI: Mary Downs, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill The ancient geographic and ethnographic accounts of the two main cultural groups occupying the Guadalquivir River valley in southern Spain contain numerous seem- ingly irreconcilable discrepancies. Attempts to define and map the territories of the Turdetani and the Bastetani and to define the spatial and ethnic relationship of these groups to each other and to the Turduli and Bastuli (subgroups?) are frustrated by the disagreement of the sources. A number of explanations are valid: 1) the texts (mainly of Strabo, Pliny, Mela, Ptolemy, and Avienus) derive from sources that range in date from the sixth century B.C. to the first cen- tury A.D.; 2) the ethnic territories described were them- selves evolving prior to and during the Roman conquest of southern Spain; and 3) the texts reflect different Greek and Roman historical, geographical, and ethnographic traditions. A number of recent studies focusing on cognitive as- pects of mapping have identified a basic problem in our understanding of ancient spatial perceptions that may be- gin to resolve some of the problems. Ancient geographers tended not to conceive of or convey geographic or ethno- graphic information cartographically but rather through linear relationships. Modern attempts to represent that information in cartographic form will perforce result in irreconcilable discrepancies. This paper proposes that the difficulties that we have encountered in defining Turdetanian and Bastetanian ter- ritory result from differences in ancient and modern con- ceptions of space. By examining the ancient geographic texts from a new perspective, we may be able to redefine the territories of these two ethnic groups. LANDSCAPE AND IDEOLOGY IN ROMAN BAETICA: SimonJ. Keay, University of Southampton Maps of the Roman province of Hispania Ulterior Baetica under the Early Empire are deceptive. The net- works of towns and roads can create the impression that under Caesar and Augustus Rome imposed an efficient administrative system upon a passive native population. In some cases earlier strategic considerations might have played a determining role. At the same time economic ra- tionale dictated the location of coloniae at key positions along the river Guadalquivir. An alternative view emphasizes social and ideological factors. In the first instance, the provincial landscape can be seen as the embodiment of a palimpsest of social re- lationships that had their origins in the pre-Roman period. Roman Republican "urbanism" was limited to the enhance- ment of those native centers of strategic relevance to "lim- ited" goals and largely carried out through the agency of Turdetanian, Bastetanian, and other settlement hierarchies. The geography of the large-scale colonization under Caesar may have been largely dictated by social constraints, namely the distribution of his personal clientela. This pattern was reinforced by the Augustan colonies, and provided the framework for the Augustan administrative "system." Im- perial ideology provided the motivating force for urban de- velopment in the province. The nature of indigenous so- ciety was such, however, that this did not begin in Baetica until the reign of Tiberius. THE LAND AS MAP: PROBLEMS OF ROMAN LAND DIVISIoN IN BAETICA: Evan Haley, McMaster University How little we know of the nature and extent of Roman land division in Spain is dramatically underscored by the recent appearance of a bronze cadastral forma- the first known from the Roman world- showing centuriation, prob- ably of the territory of the colonia Metellinum (Medellin, Badajoz province), according to an as yet unknown grid</page><page sequence="17">312 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 99 of 22 x 25 actus. Certainly Spain offers no dramatic paral- lel to the famous Orange cadasters but the meticulous analy- sis of the landscape through archaeological survey, aerial photography, toponymy, and historical cartography, among other means, reveals Roman parceling, mainly in the Ebro River valley, the eastern Mediterranean coast, and the re- gion of Augusta Emerita. Amid this geographical diver- sity the Roman province of Baetica (modern Andalucia) is conspicuous by its underrepresentation vis-a-vis regions known with certainty to have been subjected to some kind of Roman land division. Scholars have alleged Roman parceling in the territories of Italica, Carmo, Obulcula, Astigi, Ilipula Minor, and on the confines ofTucci, Urgavo, and Aurgi, and yet only the first two mentioned identifica- tions have received any widespread recognition, though not universal assent. A priori we should expect orthogonal parceling accord- ing to the actus to have been widespread in Baetica: epigraphy (CIL II, 3361) and the testimony of Columella (5.1.5) confirm that the designation acnua, which is a Latin synonym for actus quadratus (Varro RR 1.10.2), was com- monly used in Baetica. The term acnua decidedly does not refer to a pre-Roman system of land measurement as one recent writer on Roman Spain has suggested. Baetican epigraphy also yields a first-century A.D. agrimensor (CIL II, 1598). The search for Roman land divisions in the An- dalusian countryside must operate on the basis of the fol- lowing: first, many Baetican divisions may have been made not according to the system of centuriation but per strigas et per scamna- at least Frontinus De agrorum qualitate (La. 2-4; Th. 1) expressly says this type of strip parceling was used on provincial land subject to tribute; second, the puta- tive Roman grid must have a consistent orientation; and, third, the division must be clearly based on the actus. SESSION II B: MINOAN ARCHAEOLOGY: RE- PORTS FROM THE FIELD EXCAVATION OF THE ASHLAR BUILDINGS AT KOMMOS, CRETE: Joseph W Shaw, University of Toronto During 1994 we continued to define the limits and orig- inal forms of the two ashlar buildings, P and T, in the south- ern, civic area at Kommos. LM IIIA2 Building P consists of six broad, parallel roofed galleries facing the sea, and may have housed ships during the non-sailing months in the winter. In P we completed clearing Gallery P3 down to LM I levels; the eastern end of P2 was explored as well. LM I Building T is of palatial form, with groups of rooms (wings) arranged around a large central court 28.75 m east-west by 38.04 m north-south. Excavation in T was con- centrated in the area just south of the Central Court, where we revealed an LM I stoa of monumental scale, originally perhaps of two stories. In this open area, five of the six disc-shaped bases for wooden columns are preserved. Within the stoa, and presumably built after its destruction in early LM I, was revealed a well-preserved pottery kiln with many vessels and wasters in its four channels and in dumps outside. The kiln should add significantly to our understanding of Minoan ceramic techniques and local pottery styles. By itself Building T brings up questions con- cerning not only local Messara socioeconomic interrela- tionships, but also the general significance of the palatial "court-centered" structures that proliferated during LM I. EXCAVATIONS AT PALAIKASTRO, 1994: L.H. Sackett, Brit- ish School at Athens, and J.A. MacGillivray, Columbia University Excavation in 1994 was devoted entirely to work in the area of Building VI, partly revealed in 1991 and then given an MM IIIB/LM IA construction date (over earlier MM build- ings), with a final phase in LM IA. Work this year extended to all quarters of this building and the chronology was confirmed. The most interesting architectural features were found in the southeast quarter, where a monumental en- trance led to a paved central court measuring 7.30 x 10.70 m and adjoining a plastered area of similar shape and dimensions. The paved court was bordered by a pillared colonnade now preserved only on its south side. Beyond the colonnade on the south was a large paved room entered by a pier-and-door system whose piers were placed un- usually on cut bases of green serpentine. The rooms on the west side of the court remain to be excavated, but they were probably well appointed. On the east side of the court a well-paved drain ran down toward the street dividing Building VI from Block B. On the down- hill north side the limiting walls, mostly eroded below the LM IA floor level but surviving due to the deep terracing here, indicate that the original structure was provided with a massive enceinte wall. There is evidence for earthquake devastation during the LM IA period, followed by general demolition. Walls, columns, and even paving slabs were systematically dismantled and removed, leaving only the southeast corner of the colonnade partly in situ. On the resulting pitted surface apparently fell a deposit of vol- canic ash or tephra. The most substantial deposit (partly excavated) lay in a hollow near the easterly paved drain and the silty levels above it, in association with unusually rich deposits of snail shells, perhaps suggest a period of uncharacteristic rainfall. Thereafter the whole area seems to have been left open. Two wells belonging to this open area were fully exca- vated. Each provided an extremely valuable ceramic se- quence of both closed and open shapes, running from the LM IB primary deposits through LM II and LM IIIAl to a final rubbish fill of LM IIIA2/B character. In addition, a fragment of a remarkably fine stone rhyton with scenes of dolphins in a seascape was found, as well as sandstone horns of consecration, worn and probably deriving from the clearance of part of Building VI. 1994 EXCAVATIONS AT MOCHLOS, CRETE:Jeffrey S. Soles, University of North Carolina at Greensboro, and Costis Davaras, University of Athens The Greek-American excavations at Mochlos continued in 1994 at four different locations: on the island of Mochlos, behind the modern village on the coast opposite, in the LM III cemetery above the village, and at the site of Chalinomouri at the eastern end of the Mochlos plain.</page><page sequence="18">1995] THE 96TH ANNUAL MEETING 313 On the island we succeeded in pinpointing the date of the fort identified last year to the Late Hellenistic period, a little earlier than previously thought; an imported Proto- Corinthian oinochoe was discovered underneath this fort on the top of the island, revealing a hitherto unsuspected period at Mochlos. Excavation also uncovered remains of the Minoan settlement dating to the EM II, EM III, MM IB/II, and LM IB periods and additional remains of the Mycenaean reoccupation that began in the LM IIIA:1 period. On the coast the project completed the excavation of the LM IB industrial quarter, uncovering additional evi- dence for stone-vase making and pottery production in Building B, including a second kiln whose firing chamber was full of olive pits. We also completed work on the LM IB farmhouse at Chalinomouri, exploring the area outside and around the farmhouse as well, where the remains of terrace walls and a large clay-lined oven are located. In the LM III cemetery, 13 more tombs were uncovered, most of them containing pithos burials, bringing the total number of tombs discovered to date to 29. EXCAVATIONS AT PSEIRA, 1993-1994: Cheryl R. Floyd, Temple University, Lada Onyshkevych, University of Pennsylvania, and Joan Beaudoin and George Mitrakis, Temple University The Pseira Project continued work in 1993-1994, under the direction of Philip Betancourt and Costis Davaras. Field- work included the completion of topographic plans for the cemetery and architectural plans of houses in areas C and D. This aspect of the project provided new infor- mation on the development of the Minoan settlement of LM I Pseira, which contained ca. 60 buildings. Studies of the ceramic remains and other finds from Building BS/BV (the Plateia House) and the buildings of area AF continued and allowed for a better understanding of the activities once performed within these structures. Studies concentrated on the finds from area AF that presented a succession of strata from the Middle Minoan and Late Minoan periods. Five architectural phases were distinguished in area AF, which denoted three separate buildings (in phases II, III, and V). In addition, an LM IIIC reoccupation period was represented by ceramic finds that could not be associated with any new building activity. Fragments of at least two Linear A inscriptions on pithoi from the area immediately north of Building AF were dis- covered during the course of the pottery studies. These remains were associated with the phase V (LM IB) build- ing in area AF Human skeletal remains from the cemetery were studied by Kristen Borre and Laura Sappelsa. AN EARLY MINOAN I POTtERY ASSEMBLAGE FROM EAST CRETE: Donald C. Haggis, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill The relative chronology of Early Minoan I is inadequately understood. While elucidation of this phase is vitally im- portant for our understanding of the origins of Minoan culture, few well-stratified habitation deposits are known throughout the entire island. In East Crete, they are en- tirely lacking. This paper presents the results of a small- scale, stratigraphic excavation at Kalo Khorio-Istron, on the northeast coast of Crete, where evidence of an EM I house came to light in a test excavation in 1993. Excava- tion at Kalo Khorio produced a series of five habitation deposits within 11 stratigraphic units spanning the EM I period. The definition of EM I is derived primarily from un- stratified burial assemblages (e.g., Ayia Photia, Pyrgos, and Lebena) and a few closed deposits from habitation sites in Central and West Crete (Knossos Palace well, West Court trench FF, Debla, and Phaistos). These excavations have sparked controversies over the stratigraphic and chrono- logical relationship between FN and EM I, and EM I and EM IIA. Our knowledge and perception of a culture change at the beginning of the Bronze Age, and our ability to for- mulate models of exogenous influence or indigenous de- velopment have been frustrated by lack of evidence from well-stratified settlement sites. This paper presents the characteristic features of the East Cretan EM I ceramic phase, considers the stratigraphic transition from EM I to IIA, and briefly reexamines ques- tions of the origins of EM II culture in East Crete, as well as recent arguments for an EM I population influx into the island from the Near East or Western Anatolia. The results contribute to the definition and chronology of EM I culture throughout the island. THE GOURNIA SURVEY PROJECT: A PRELIMINARY RE- PORT ON THE 1992-1994 FIELD SEASONS: L. Vance Watrous and Harriet Blitzer, State University of New York at Buffalo The Gournia Survey Project was organized to document the natural environment and the history of settlement in the region of the Minoan site of Gournia in preparation for the excavation of the site. The geologist Zangger has found that the Gournia River was probably perennial in the Bronze Age (which would explain the siting of Gournia). The ethnographic work of Blitzer will be reported on separately. The Gournia archaeological survey has covered ca. 21 km2 and discovered 155 new sites. The region is first settled in the FN/EM I period; settlement expands in EM II. Trade is substantial in EM II; the production centers for Vasiliki ware may have been located. After EM II, set- tlement is much reduced and fortified refuge sites appear in EM IIB-MM IA; resettlement of the countryside begins in MM IA and expands in MM IB-II. Settlement drops slightly in MM III-LM I and sharply in LM IIIA-B. Settled in defensive locations, the LM IIIC population grows. An LM IIIC-Classical settlement, 5 ha in size, on the moun- tain peak of Profitis Elias, is the city-state of Larisa described by Strabo (9.5.19). Regional resettlement begins in the first century A.D. with the appearance of towns, villages, and farmsteads, some fed by aqueducts. Other survey discov- eries include Minoan beehives, dams, a double-galleried shipshed, and peak sanctuaries 100 m from Gournia and at Stavromenos north of Ierapetra.</page><page sequence="19">314 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 99 SESSION II C: GREEK ICONOGRAPHY KOMAST VASES IN ARCHAIC GREECE: THE QUESTION OF THE LAME-FOOTED DANCERS: Tyler jo Smith, Oxford University In 1965 Axel Seeberg published an article (JHS 85, 102-109) in which he examined the iconography on Corin- thian vases of the myth of the return of Hephaistos to Olym- pos. Komast dancers, commonly called "padded dancers," appear on several examples as part of the festive proces- sion, over which Dionysos presides. The oldest-known ex- ample of this scene appears on a Middle Corinthian amphoriskos, Athens NM 664. The youthful Hephaistos, identified by his crippled feet, rides a mule in the com- pany of padded dancers. Seeberg believed that this ver- sion of the myth was based on a cult procession at Corinth, whose theme may have been inspired by contemporary poetry. Seeberg was also the first to recognize the connec- tion between komast dancers and Hephaistos as not solely Dionysian, as the dancers themselves sometimes display the same lame feet. Komast dancers with crippled or deformed feet, as well as scenes of the return of Hephaistos, are identified on black-figure vases from Corinth, Athens, Boeotia, and La- conia throughout the first half of the sixth century B.C. With the exception of a few Corinthian examples and one Boeotian skyphos (Thebes 31.187), komast dancers, lame or otherwise, do not appear as members of the drunken entourage en route to Olympos. This paper suggests that komast dancers become dis- associated with the return myth once it travels outside Corinth. Although the original inspiration for the scene on vases may have been a local religious rite, there is no evidence that a cult of Hephaistos spread simultaneously with the transmission of the black-figure technique, or its stock human figure scenes. The occurrence of lame-footed revelers without their lame-footed leader (and without Dionysos!) is an iconographic phenomenon that probably reflects nothing about human life or belief in Archaic Greece. Rather, the crippled dancers form part of a travel- ing repertoire of black-figure komos scenes, whose original function, just as the "padding" itself, has long since been forgotten. NYMPHS, NOT MAENADS, ON ATric RED-FIGURE VASES: Thomas H. Carpenter, Virginia Polytechnic Insti- tute and State University The women accompanying Dionysos on most Attic black- and red-figure vases should be identified as semi-divine nymphs rather than as mortal maenads. The distinction is an important one. The conventional use of the term "maenad" for Dionysian women on Attic vases has led to misunderstandings of those women and of some scenes that, when used as evidence in discussions of cult practices, have led to erroneous conclusions. When narratives of the early life of Dionysos appear on Attic red-figure vases during the first half of the fifth century B.C., the women with him are clearly nymphs, his nurses, as they are identified in much literature (e.g., II. 6.132, Hymn. Horn. 26, Soph. OC 689). During the second half of the century some of these women, even in depic- tions of the god's infancy, are given symbolic names such as "Madness" or "Drunkenness," which replace an earlier iconographic signal of Dionysian madness whereby the god or a nymph holds up the halves of a torn goat or fawn. This early use of symbolic names is shown most clearly on vases by the Villa Giulia Painter, who paints many scenes from the god's life, and also paints scenes said to represent Dionysian cult on so-called Lenaia Vases. In fact, there is no reason to identify any of the women on the Villa Giulia Painter's vases as mortal, nor are there reasons to identify women with Dionysos in most generic scenes as mortal maenads rather than as semi-divine nymphs. A REPRESENTATION OF ACTION FROM A RANSOM OF HECTOR: Charles E. Mercier, Vassar College Only two depictions of tragic actors acting (as opposed to comic actors acting or tragic myths enacted) have been identified in recent discussions of the evidence, two Sicil- ian kalyx kraters by the Capodarso Painter (Caltanisetta and Syracuse 66557). This paper presents a third that has gone unremarked. A fragment of an Apulian Gnathia kalyx krater of the mid-fourth century at the Metropolitan Mu- seum of Art (10.210.17 a) shows actors on stage, one in costume, performing a scene from a Ransom of Hector. The painting is far finer an effort than those of the Capodarso Painter and the actors are performing an action we can explicate with precision with evidence drawn from fifth- century tragedy. Therefore, this image should take its place as a most important representation of tragic acting in vase painting and good evidence for the sophistication South Italian Greeks could bring to a depiction of tragedy. The fragment shows actors playing Priam supplicating Achilles for the body of his son Hector. A preserved stretch of stage floor, comparable in style to a number of stage floors in vase painting, especially by Asteas, is a decisive indication that theatrical performance is depicted. This might be Aeschylus's Phrygians or the Ransom of Hector, or, perhaps more likely, the Ransom of Hector of Dionysius I of Syracuse, which won the Lenaea of 376 B.C. The action performed is that of ritual supplication at the knees, an action that in its simplicity can be fully and significantly performed on stage, as is often the case in Euripides. Im- portant parallels in extant tragedy are the action of Helen's supplication of the seated Theonoe (Hel. 894ff.) and both Andromache's supplication of Peleus (Andr. 572-717) and Hecuba's of Agamemnon (Hec. 752-888), which show how long this action can be maintained on stage. If the vase depicts a moment from a revival of Aeschylus's Phrygians, it demonstrates a tragic antecedent to Euripides' use of the scenes, an antecedent not otherwise attested. If the vase depicts Dionysius's Ransom of Hector, it is evi- dence for the influence of Euripidean technique on his work, so closely does the vase illustrate our evidence from Euripidean tragedy. That the vase depicts tragic perfor- mance, but not literally (on stage but no masks, only one actor costumed), must complicate the rule recently artic-</page><page sequence="20">1995] THE 96TH ANNUAL MEETING 315 ulated by Taplin, that "paintings (of tragedy), like the drama they reflect, must not openly declare their theatricality." Tragic vases, like tragedy itself, are capable of a subtle metatheatricality. THE SPHERE-BEARING ANTHROPOMORPHIC FIGURINES OF AMATHUS, CYPRUS: Shawn O'Bryhim, Ball State University A number of figurines that depict women carrying large round objects have been discovered in tombs of Amathus that date from the Archaic period. Karageorghis identified these appurtenances as hand drums on analogy with the hoop-like instruments held by similar statuettes found in the Levant. Photographs of the Cypriot figurines indicate, however, that they do not hold hoop-shaped drums, but spheres. Therefore, a new classification for these terracottas is needed. The function of these spheres becomes clear through an examination of iconographical and literary references to them in the Levant. Small sculptures show them either on the lap of a seated Astarte or on her throne; coins de- pict them on her processional cart; bronze bowls picture them on tables in front of the enthroned goddess. Philo of Byblos explains that Astarte found a meteorite near Tyre and set it up in her temple as a baetyl, an aniconic rep- resentation of the goddess. This object appears in religious contexts on Cyprus as well. Stone spheres have been found in the sanctuaries of Kition and Aghia Irini, while the coins of Paphos show a number of them inside the temenos of the temple of Aphrodite/Astarte. It appears, then, that the sphere-bearing anthropomorphic terracottas of Amathus represent either the goddess herself or, more likely, women who are bringing these aniconic images of the goddess to her temple as dedicatory offerings. "APAKONTQAEIE KOPAI": ERINYES/EUMENIDES IN LAKONIA: Gina Salapata, Massey University Six fragmentary terracotta plaques with relief represen- tations were found in a votive deposit at Amyklai and can be dated to the Classical period. The plaques were all made in the same mold, and it is possible to reconstruct the orig- inal scene depicted on them as three standing female figures flanked by erect snakes. The iconographic scheme of a triad flanked by snakes is found nowhere else in the Greek world. The closest paral- lel is the representation of the Erinyes/Eumenides, who, originally conceived as snakes (Eur. Or. 256), were later imagined as women with snakes. Thus, on a group of Hel- lenistic stone reliefs from the Argolid are depicted three standing women holding two snakes or one snake and a poppy flower. Three of these reliefs are inscribed with dedi- cations to the Eumenides (ArchDelt 23 [1968] pls. 50-57). On the basis of the Argive reliefs, the figures on the Amyklaian plaques can be identified with the Erinyes/ Eumenides. This identification accords with the nature of the cult at the sanctuary where they were dedicated. The sanctu- ary has been securely identified with the hero shrine of Agamemnon and his consort, Alexandra/Kassandra, both of whom were murdered in Lakonia, according to an old local tradition. An inscription found near the deposit sug- gests that associated with the cult of Kassandra at Amyklai was a sacrificial propitiatory ceremony presumably insti- tuted to atone her murder. An offering with the represen- tation of the avenging spirits, the Erinyes, would thus have been very appropriate for Kassandra, who perished in a violent death that was never avenged. GENDER EQUALITY? Two-FIGURE CLASSICAL ATTIC GRAVE RELIEFS: Janet Burnett Grossman, J. Paul Getty Museum Two-figure grave reliefs composed of a man and a woman standing facing one another were recognized by A. Conze as a special group of 16 stelae and seven lekythoi (Die attischen Grabreliefs [Berlin 1893-1922] nos. 1082-1108). The antithetic composition and symmetry of design create an impression of equal status and intimacy between the two figures. On most, the focal point of the composition is the physical meeting of hands, symbolizing the couple's unity. Two examples of this type of stele are found among the grave reliefs from the Athenian Agora currently being studied by the author (S 499 and S 1508). On both, the female figures stand with their weight on one leg making the so-called "bridal gesture" with the edge of the mantles covering their heads. On one stele, the two figures shake hands while on the other the male figure gestures with his right hand as if speaking. This iconography is close to images found both on docu- ment reliefs and Attic red-figure vases. Scenes on vases with or without dexiosis, which predate the composition on the reliefs, are especially plentiful from 460 to 430 B.C., the period of cessation of Attic grave monuments, and may provide a precedent for the composition on sculpted grave reliefs. The impression of equal status conveyed by the two-figure reliefs suggests a more moderate view of the position of women in fifth-century B.C. Athens than has been suggested by recent literature. DIVESTING THE FEMALE BREAST IN CLASSICAL SCULP- TURE: Beth Cohen, New York Society M. Bieber (Ancient Copies [New York 1977] 59, 63) dis- cussed a "well-known Greek motif... the divesting of one breast," arguing that "divesting of clothes always had a definite meaning in accordance with the subject repre- sented." This paper reviews the potent visual imagery of the bare female breast in Classical sculpture. In the fifth century B.C. full female nudity was generally shunned. The motif of a bare female breast first appeared in negative, violent contexts. Women attacked by centaurs lose one of the pins fastening their peploi. Amazons' breasts revealed by loosely hanging upper garments denote their defeat in battle through injury and death. For female Niobids the breast bared from futile flight also denotes death. Contrast- ingpositive contexts appear during the century's final quar-</page><page sequence="21">316 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 99 ter: the windblown drapery of Nikai and female akroteria, an erotic symbol for Aphrodite and mortal recipients of divine love, and an expression of ecstasy for maenads. In these diverse images the garment falls loosely, fully reveal- ing the breast. The Barberini Suppliant, a Roman copy of a Greek original, ca. 430-420 B.C., differs from the norm - her garment cups her breast's underside. She mod- estly pressed the fallen garment under her arm after being denuded, but it has slipped down below the nipple of her breast. The Suppliant's partially covered breast, a specific narrative attribute, is reinterpreted here in light of Kassandra's rape. HPAKAEI IATPQN ANTI XAPIZOMENOY. HERAKLES AND HEALING CULT IN THE PELOPONNESE: Christina A. Salowey, Bryn Mawr College There is evidence for the cult of Herakles at 28 sites in the Peloponnese. Herakles' cult function at these sites generally falls into three categories: military, athletic, or curative. It is the curative abilities of Herakles that I ad- dress. This paper presents the evidence for Herakles' func- tion as a healing divinity, examines the permutations that his connection with healing cult takes in myth and ritual, and suggests an origin for his status as a disease preven- tion specialist. Herakles has a strong cult presence at the notable Peloponnesian shrines of Asklepios in Epidauros, Messene, and Abia. The epithet 6cstiKaKoq, attested for Herakles at Epidauros, Mantineia, and Melite, a deme of Athens, may reflect a disease-averting function. He is also credited with the discovery of the medicinal waters at the healing shrine of Hippolytos in Troizen (Paus. 2.32.4). At the site of Geronthrai (modern Geraki) in Lakonia, Herakles stands alone as a healing divinity. A fifth-century inscription from there records the dedication of a spring to Herakles in return for cures provided (IG V(1), 1119; the Greek quote in the title of this paper comes from this inscription). Herakles' connection with springs and hot baths is attested elsewhere and is one manifestation of his healing capabilities, but the origins of his doctoring talents may have developed from the mythological tales of his swamp-clearing efforts. Herakles conquered many beasts in his time and one of them may have been the most fear- ful of all, debilitating disease. GENTLEMEN DON'T HUG THEIR KNEES: QUARRELSOME ARES AND SOME HOSTILE POSTURES: Ann M. Nicgorski, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Ares, the hated god of war as well as one of the revered Olympian gods, is presented in Greek literature as a vio- lent and braggart soldier, a symbol of necessary evil, sor- row, and suffering. As such, he was acknowledged and feared but rarely loved by the ancient Greeks or by his fellow Olym- pians. For this reason, he is rarely represented in the re- laxed company of gods who gather on Olympos, for ex- ample, to listen to Apollo play his lyre. When, however, they gather for ritual occasions or important councils, where conflict might result, Ares is present although he generally appears at the extreme edge of the composition in the vicinity of Aphrodite, his only friend. On such oc- casions, Ares sits uncomfortably on the edge of his seat often with one knee drawn up into his arms, which are joined by interlaced fingers, as on the east frieze of the Parthenon or in the Ares Ludovisi type. Scholars have ex- plained these postures as expressions of Ares' restlessness due to his unwilling inactivity. A passage in Pliny (HN 28.27.59), however, suggests a more ominous interpretation. Postures of this sort, which involve knotting the limbs around each other, were thought magically to inhibit the action at hand and, for this reason, the Romans forbade them at councils of war or of officials and at sacred rites or prayers. Indeed, it was by this type of sorcery that Lucina stayed the birth of Herakles, allowing Alcmena to labor in vain for several days (Ov. Met. 9.281-315). SESSION II D: ROMAN ARCHITECTURE AND TOPOGRAPHY VITRUVIUS'S VIEW OF ANCIENT TECHNOLOGY: Thomas Noble Howe, Southwestern University This paper surveys Vitruvius's writing on Hellenistic science and technology and attempts to perceive his method for choices of inclusion or exclusion of material. The ad- vances in our knowledge of ancient technology in the last 30 years allow us to make such judgments far better than we could at any earlier time. Despite the numerous broad and specialized studies of ancient technology in recent years, there is none that at- tempts to survey the totality of the vast panorama of lib- eral arts and technology from which Vitruvius draws his material. When one attempts such a critical survey one sees a very active process of choice in Vitruvius's writing. He has a clear preference for machines that demonstrate modular design and those designed on a mathematical basis (e.g., the palintone ballistra vs. the repeater catapult), and explanations that can be related to general physical theory (climates, races, types of timber, etc., dependent upon inclinatio mundi). He also seems to have a clear no- tion of the distinction of "high tech" (catapults) from "low tech" (sapping trenches) and appreciates the relative merits of each. The purpose of his process of choice is to demonstrate the simple need of theory (ratiocinatio) in practice, rather than rule of thumb. The further point is to assert the need carefully to assess the role of theory and to argue that what really counts in practice is sollertia architectorum and not elaborate expense. This paper concludes that if one approaches Vitruvius from a holistic appreciation of the context of Hellenistic enkyklios paideia it increases our ability to distinguish theory from practice in the Libri Decem and enhances our ability to use Vitruvius as an archaeological source for technol- ogy as well as for architecture.</page><page sequence="22">1995] THE 96TH ANNUAL MEETING 317 ARCHITECTURAL EKPHRASIS AND VITRUVIUS'S BASIL- ICA AT FANO: Susan Tegtmeyer, University of Penn- sylvania The famous description of the basilica at Fano in Vitruvius's De architectura is one of only a handful of lit- erary descriptions of buildings that have survived from antiquity. Although no remains of the basilica have been found, the length and detail of the description have in- spired numerous scholars of architecture, from the Renais- sance to the present day, to reconstruct the building. In modern archaeological literature, discussions of Roman basilican architecture invariably make reference to this text. This paper assesses the value of the Vitruvian passage as a source for the study of basilican architecture by ana- lyzing the description and its function within De Arch.; by comparing it to other descriptions of structures found in contemporary technical treatises (e.g., Varro, Athenaeus Mechanicus); and by comparing the building, as it is de- scribed by Vitruvius, to the archaeological remains of con- temporary and earlier basilican architecture. Vitruvius's description of the basilica at Fano is not com- plete enough to allow for a secure reconstruction. Like other examples of architectural ekphrasis in Roman tech- nical writing, the Vitruvian description is intended to serve as an example of larger theoretical and practical ideas about good construction. Vitruvius's description acts as a complement to his discussion of temple architecture and demonstrates that, in his own work as an architect, he was both conservative and innovative: he adhered to principles developed by the Hellenistic architect Hermo- genes, but adapted them to the requirements of Roman civic building. THE DESIGN OF THE MAISON CARRIE IN NiMES:Jon Harstone, Toronto Society The Maison Carr6e was designed using a square grid with a module of 835 mm. The cella walls are one module wide, and fit exactly into the grid. The interior of the cella is 13 modules wide and 19 modules long. Except along the facade, the columns and half columns are three modules apart, and are located at the intersection of the grid lines. The module is approximately 2.8 Roman ft, which is improbable if the builder used Roman feet. More than one unit of measurement, however, was used in Gaul at this time. During the time of Trajan a foot was used called the pes Drusianus, which was equal to the Roman foot plus an inch and a half, or about 333 mm. The module used to build the Maison Carree is 2.5 pes Drusianus. During the Middle Ages many buildings were designed using a grid with a 2.5-ft module, where the walls were 2.5 ft or one module wide. The best-known example is the plan of St. Gall. The Maison Carree demonstrates that this de- sign method was used during the principate of Augustus. The use of the pes Drusianus at the Maison Carree shows that the temple was built by a local contractor who could follow simple design drawings. The drawings may have been prepared in Rome or produced locally. Finally, the design of the Maison Carree is the earliest evidence we have for the use of the pes Drusianus. LATRINES, BATHS, AND HEALTH IN POST-EARTHQUAKE POMPEII: Ann Olga Koloski-Ostrow, Brandeis University Walking on the streets of a Roman city could be a dan- gerous and dirty business judging from Juvenal's account of a passerby fouled and injured by the dumped contents of a chamber pot (3.269-72). A. Scobie (Klio 68 [1986] 401ff) is surely right that the Roman world was a tough, unhealthy place in which to live, and that disease and death lurked around every corner. Because there was an enormous gulf separating advantaged from disadvantaged in the Roman Empire with respect to access to the legal system, educa- tion, and medical care, terrible conditions often prevailed. But Roman planning within individual towns did take into account with some care the serious issues of health and sanitation. This paper explores the evidence in post- earthquake Pompeii. Although the standardized latrines of baths and those near fora were hardly free of problems (principally poor lighting and ventilation), there was a concerted effort to provide comforts for a large number of citizens at frequent, key points within Pompeii. In addition, recent discoveries show that virtually every house in Pompeii and Herculane- um had a cesspit/latrine. We now know that large house- holds sometimes had multi-seaters (accommodating two to six people). Studying the availability and distribution of public and private latrines and baths at Pompeii involves mapping the advances of civilization itself. When we also put the waterworks and sewers on this map we can see the serious strides taken to promote good hygiene during a period of major crisis for the city. BRICK LININGS ON VAULTS AT TRAJAN'S MARKETS: SOME EVIDENCE FOR THE ORGANIZATION OF THE BUILDING INDUSTRY IN ROME: Lynne C. Lancaster, Oxford University The use of brick linings along the intrados of concrete vaults occurs in two groups of rooms at Trajan's Markets. An examination of the contexts in which the technique occurs in other buildings in Rome and Ostia reveals that its use is unrelated to the form of the vault, the type of building, or the location within a building. Its use appears to have been left to the discretion of the builder. Other evidence at Trajan's Markets, such as the location of build- ingjoints and changes in the level of bonding courses, sug- gests that this technique can be associated with a particu- lar crew of workmen at the Markets. In addition, the distinctive hole found on all the bessales in the linings occurs nowhere else except in the Trajanic vaults supporting the latrine overlooking the Forum of Caesar. Each of these three groups of rooms may represent the work of a single crew of workers. If so, this would be one of the only known ex-</page><page sequence="23">318 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 99 amples in which the hand of a particular builder can be identified in separate buildings. From an examination of the epigraphic and juristic evi- dence, it is clear that private contractors were used for pub- lic works; therefore, each of the two groups of rooms with brick linings at the Markets could represent the work of a single contract (and possibly the same contractor). Since the two sectors occur in different parts of the complex and at different levels, the archaeological evidence suggests that one model for the way in which the construction of a large public building was managed is that relatively small, single- story sectors of the building were let out on separate con- tracts to different contractors. URBAN RENEWAL AT SEVERAN OSTIA: KEEPING UP WITH THE ANTONINEs: Joanne M. Spurza, Prince- ton University Fresh attention has been focused on the achievements of the Severan emperors in city planning and urban re- newal throughout the empire. The Severi left their mark on Ostia, too, and the renewed interest in Severan build- ing programs at Leptis Magna, Cherchel, and the city of Rome itself calls for reexamination of their work in the Imperial port city. Most conspicuously, the expanded theater at Ostia, inaugurated by Septimius Severus and Caracalla in A.D. 196, epigraphically took the credit for previous efforts (a habit to which Cassius Dio alludes, 76.16.3); it was crowned a decade later by the resplendent, adjacent arch to Caracalla. Other reflections of Severan commercial and military policies appear in maintenance of the extensive horrea system along the Tiber, in a grand emporium erected there, and in the rebuilding of the Bar- racks of the Vigiles, whose command was reorganized by Severus. No new Ostian thermae arise in the wake of the colossal Baths of Caracalla at Rome; but half the city baths do undergo major renovations at this time. From private initiatives come an unusually high number of dedications by individuals and by the increasingly powerful guilds, to the imperial family. These projects have been documented in the past in a piecemeal fashion; now a wealth of inscriptions, unpub- lished archival material, and more accurate architectural analysis can be brought to bear, to demonstrate compre- hensively the full effects of the Severan program at Ostia. With Rome as their model, the Severan emperors were the last to effect such thoroughgoing physical change at Ostia; indeed, theirs is the last dynasty to maintain consistently the venerable tradition of imperial upkeep of the port city, against rising odds, well into the third century. THE SESSORIAN COMPLEX: THE "OTHER" SEVERAN PALACE IN ROME: Susann Sowers Lusnia, Univer- sity of Cincinnati The Sessorian Palace complex located in the southeast corner of Rome near the Porta Maggiore was one of sev- eral major buildings constructed along the southern rim of the city by the Severan emperors. Its surviving elements include an atrium hall (now part of Santa Croce in Geru- salemme), an amphitheater, a circus, and a bath complex. A large domus of the early third century near Porta Mag- giore could also be part of the palace. The only major study of this area was by A.M. Colini. Despite the complex's ob- vious importance in Severan Rome, the nature of the palace has never been adequately explained. This paper discusses the unusual feature of the inclu- sion of both a circus and an amphitheater in this palace; the palace's relationship to other Severan buildings in the area; and finally, the functions that it may have served. The palace-circus-amphitheater arrangement is apparently unique. The presence of the amphitheater is explained by the proximity of the palace to the Castra Nova Equitum Singularium (also Severan); and the connection of the cir- cus and amphitheater by a vaulted passageway has a paral- lel in Lepcis Magna (birthplace of Septimius Severus). In addition to functioning as a retreat for the Severan em- perors, this palace probably served a dual purpose under Elagabalus, becoming the summer residence of his god Elagabal who, according to Herodian, was led from his Palatine temple in a great parade to a suburban location as part of what was undoubtedly a solstice observance. REEXCAVATION OF THE VILLA OF TORRE DE PALMA, PORTUGAL: Stephanie J. Maloney, University of Louisville Chance discovery of a few tesserae in 1946 led excavators to uncover the remains of an enormous Roman villa in Torre de Palma. From 1983 to 1986 archaeologists from the University of Louisville reexcavated the Early Chris- tian basilica associated with the villa. Constructed in the last third of the fourth century, the original double-apsed church was enlarged in the Visigothic period (sixth-seventh centuries). Because of the importance of the church we decided to expand the project to include the villa itself in order to determine when the villa was established, how it changed through time, its extent at the time of the con- struction of the church, and its duration. Reexcavation of the villa began in 1987. Although we have not yet been able to establish an ab- solute chronology for the many building phases repre- sented, the relative chronology is clear. Only a few vestiges of the first villa (first century A.D.) survive in the area ex- plored to date. From the hundreds of walls exposed by the original excavators we have been able to extract, primarily on the basis of a distinctive building style, most of the plan of a large villa complex probably dating from the second century. The villa urbana was expanded and major portions of the villa rustica rebuilt, perhaps as a result of earthquake damage, in the late third or early fourth century. The villa was occupied continuously from its foundation to at least the middle of the fifth century. It was most prosperous at the time the church was built. Fragile walls, clearly con- structed after the villa buildings had fallen into disrepair, may belong to the Visigothic period. Neither church nor villa continued beyond the Moorish invasions in the be- ginning of the eighth century.</page><page sequence="24">1995] THE 96TH ANNUAL MEETING 319 SESSION II F: AIAIAPAJOINT COLLOQUIUM: FROM OLYMPIA TO ATLANTA: STUDYING AND TEACHING ANCIENT GREEK SPORT THE OLYMPIC GAMES: ORIGIN, EVOLUTION, REVOLU- TION: Hugh M. Lee, University of Maryland, Col- lege Park Literature and archaeology suggest a humble origin for the first Olympic Games of 776 B.C. The program may have consisted of only a 200-m run (Paus. 5.8.6). In the next hun- dred years, additional footraces, boxing and wrestling, the pentathlon, and equestrian events entered the program. The four-horse chariot race, introduced in 680 B.C., en- dowed the games with special prestige and glamor. We may indeed speak of an Olympic revolution. Other societies played sports, and the Greeks themselves did so long before 776. The Olympic Games, however, transformed Greek so- ciety into one that bestowed unique prominence to athletics. Their success sparked the adoption of similar sacred Pan- hellenic contests at Delphi, Nemea, and the Isthmus. Par- ticipation in the Olympic Games did not, however, extend to women, although Greek women did play sports and even competed at Olympia itself in the festival called the Heraia. After a period of decline during the first century B.C., the Olympics reached the apex of their popularity in the sec- ond century A.D. But two centuries later, with instability in the Empire and the establishment of Christianity, the Games came to an end. The modern Olympics have sought to rekindle the an- cient athletic spirit, and have done so successfully. At no time since the end of classical antiquity has sport, with all its challenges and problems, played so pervasive a role in society. GAMES, PRIZES, AND ATHLETES: PATTERNS AND PER- SPECTIVES: Donald G. Kyle, University of Texas at Arlington Before 1975 traditional scholarship depicted a classicist scenario of the golden age, the tragic flaws, and the de- cline and fall of Greek sport. This paper surveys recent progress in demythologizing the moral didacticism and flawed history in that scenario. For nonspecialists, it also demonstrates the accessibility and value of the study of Greek sport for students and teachers of antiquity. Sport is a universal human phenomenon, but the Greeks were distinctive in their institutionalization of athletics with festivals and prizes. Games might be classed as fu- neral, crown, Panhellenic, local, or civic, but games, prizes, and athletes were found everywhere in Greece. As the word athletics implies, prizes were essential to all contests. Victors accepted any and all prizes, from wreaths to money, at the games, as well as additional rewards upon their return home, including cash bonuses and free meals. Moreover, from Homeric treasures to Panhellenic crowns to Pana- thenaic amphoras, prize-giving should be examined from the viewpoint of the donors as well as the recipients. The proliferation of rewards and the development of self- declaratory prizes promoted and marketed both sport and its sponsors. Finally, the once pervasive myth of Greek athletic ama- teurism is now moribund, but continued debate on the sociology (i.e., class origins, social status, and mobility) of Greek athletics suggests that we have more demythologiz- ing to do. "BUT THE MARE I WILL NOr GIVE UP": GREEK SPORT AS METAPHOR: Kenneth F Kitchell, Jr., Louisiana State University Greek sport is too easily divorced from the very matrix from which it sprang. Sports historians, archaeologists, and philologists alike run the risk of viewing it merely from their own narrow perspective rather than as an integrative social phenomenon. This paper concentrates on the earliest known instance of the use of sport in literature, the funeral games for Patroklos in book 23 of the Iliad, a book often given short shrift. Major teaching anthologies often leave it out entirely and literary commentators view the games as a sort of in- structive interlude. Sports historians use the scene pri- marily to discover the status of Mycenaean or Iron Age athletics. But there is one other way of viewing book 23 that is less often discussed. Why, at this crucial point in the story, did Homer turn to sport? It is not enough to say that funeral games were traditional, for Homer goes beyond this, care- fully linking book 23 with book 1 to mark the end of Achilles' wrath. Sport, then, becomes a metaphor for life. This paper analyzes book 23 from this point of view, with a special emphasis on using the chariot race to teach and elucidate the entire epic. Other examples of the an- cients' use of sport are mentioned and the paper ends with thoughts concerning the extent to which sport was at the very fabric of ancient Greek life at all levels. TEACHING THE OLYMPICS IN CYBERSPACE: Randall Stewart, University of Utah The ancient Olympic Games were interactive, sensory events: athletes perspired and grunted as they vied with each other for the victor's crown; trainers shouted advice to their charges; red blood flowed as priests offered sacri- fices; spectators sweltered as they watched and cheered. Yet we attempt to teach the Games and to instill an ap- preciation for their rich complexity from books that offer little beyond black text on white pages and the occasional color photograph of a Greek vase painting. Modern technology allows for so much more. Today's "textbook" should provide animated sequences depicting the athletic events, movie clips comparing ancient tech- niques with modern movements, voiced pronunciations of names and terms, as well as interactive maps and site plans. I am working on such a learning tool. It is interactive multimedia software that not only discusses the history of athletics in ancient Greece with descriptions of the major athletic festivals and the events they comprised, but also</page><page sequence="25">320 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 99 allows the user to plot the location of Olympia on a map, read about the history of the site and of the games, and hear a voice pronounce terms such as pankration and names such as Arrhachion. It also gives the user the opportunity to view animation depicting an ancient athlete throwing the discus and then compare the toss with a film clip of a modern athlete competing in the same event. My presenta- tion is a demonstration of this new "textbook," HyperSport: Athletics in Ancient Greece and Rome. SESSION III A: POSTER SESSION TRADE AT PSEIRA IN LATE MINOAN III: Philip P Betan- court, Temple University Building DA at Pseira, inhabited in LM III (the Cretan "reoccupation period"), is a small structure of unusual plan with a single room at the north and a staircase at the south leading directly from the exterior to the upper floor. The building's excavation discovered a series of unfired clay sealings that were attached to different types of packages and impressed with seals illustrating sailing ships and other motifs. Differences in the clay fabrics, the sizes and shapes of the sealings, and the methods of attachment to the pack- ages indicate a wide variety of goods was received at Pseira at this time. Imported pottery in Building DA confirms the picture of far-flung trade. It comes from many parts of Crete as well as from Cyprus and the Syro-Palestinian coast. The great amount of evidence for trade at such a small provincial center suggests the need for a reevalua- tion of the general availability of goods in outlying areas during this period. SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATIONS OF CORINTHIAN "PLASTIC" VASES: William R. Biers, Klaus O. Gerhardt, and Rebecca A. Braniff, University of Missouri- Columbia This presentation focuses on a research project carried out at the University of Missouri-Columbia over the last few years using advanced analytical techniques to analyze organic residues from the fabric of intact Corinthian "plastic" vases. A procedure has been developed to extract tiny amounts of residues from the interior walls of vases through the use of organic solvents and then analyze them by gas chromatography linked with mass spectrometry. This non-destructive procedure opens up the possibility of in- vestigating museum-quality vases without damaging them in any way. The procedure is described and the advantages and ramifications of its use on vases from museum collec- tions are presented. Some suggestions are made as to how to avoid modern contamination of pots found in excava- tion. Twenty-four "plastic" vases in all were tested and the data retrieved allow some speculations to be made about the makeup of perfumes and their method of manufac- ture in Corinth in the sixth century B.C. based on primary data rather than on literary references from much later periods. The scents may have been pungent rather than floral, and some may have had insecticidal properties. The question of the usefulness and significance for the field archaeologist of this procedure is considered in view of the quality and amount of data derived from the vases. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PASS AT AYIOS SOSTIS IN GREEK HISTORY: Mary R. Bynum, University of California, Berkeley Although it figured in the Greek War of Independence, the pass at Ayios Sostis in the northeastern Peloponnese was unknown to many early scholars, and its significance in the history of ancient Greece has likewise been neglected in the modern literature. It is a short, steep pass between the Corinthia and the Argolid, which carried a route that was, as Pausanias (2.5.1) says, suited for hardy walkers. It and the other north-south routes in the area figured in two episodes in Greek history. The first is the expedition of Aratos of Sikyon in 251 B.C. against the tyrant who ruled his hometown (Plut. Vit. Arat. 6-7). Based upon my study of the terrain, I argue that the ancient tower at the south end of the Ay. Sostis pass is the tower of Polygnotos, at which Aratos held a rendezvous with his supporters. He then led them through the pass to Nemea and on to Sikyon, which he liberated from the tyrant's control. The second episode concerns the maneuvers of the Lakedaimonian and Argive armies in 418 B.C. before the battle of Man- tineia (Thuc. 5.58-59). I propose that Agis sent part of his army (consisting of troops from Corinth, Pellene, and Phleious) through the Ay. Sostis pass in order to surround the Argives in the plain north of Argos and deny them the advantage of fighting in their own territory. An under- standing of this pass and its relation to the surrounding area elucidates two passages in Greek history that have remained obscure. THE AMASIS PAINTER AND HERAKLES AND NEREUS IN A TONDO: DeCoursey Fales, Jr., Emerson College The Amasis Painter decorated black-figure vases of vari- ous shapes with numerous subjects. Of Herakles' deeds, however, we have found only the struggle with the Nemean Lion, and in the interior of his cups, but less exceptionally, no large tondo. These two lacunae I eliminate by attributing to him the frequently reproduced figures on the lip-cup in the Museo Nazionale, Tarquinia, RC4194. In its tondo, Herakles is de- picted struggling with Nereus, encircled by miniature danc- ing Nereids. On the middle of the lip, the artist drew a racing chariot, distantly flanked by turning posts and on either side of the handles, a sphinx. The general arrangement and details are typical of the work of the Amasis Painter. The Nereids recall the women dancing around the shoulders of his two lekythoi in New York: three on one vase and four on the other are dressed and dance in a manner almost identical to the Nereids on RC4194. The racing horses on the exterior resemble closely those on his amphora in Munich; the wheel of the chariot, that on his band-cup in Berlin (ABV 156, 83). The details of the faces and limbs of Herakles and Nereus are also typical of the work of the Amasis Painter.</page><page sequence="26">1995] THE 96TH ANNUAL MEETING 321 GALLO-ROMAN NAVIGATION OF THE JURA REGION, SWITZERLAND: Ervan G. Garrison, University of Georgia On the lakes of the Swiss Jura-Bienne, Morat, and Neuchitel-Romanized Celts or Gauls carried on an ac- tive maritime tradition with roots that reach back to the Bronze Age and earlier. Much of the work presented here draws on the extensive body of research carried out in west- ern Switzerland since 1979, most notably by Beat Arnold. Arnold and other workers have compiled an impressive suite of whole or fragmentary watercraft together with a typology of these and other vessels found in the 19th cen- tury. A provisional chronology for this maritime tradition is presented along with its placement within the broader context of an often spectacular archaeology of recent years in the Jura region. ON THE USE OF DIAMONDS IN THE MANUFACTURE OF SASANIAN SEALS: Leonard Gorelick and A.J. Gwinnett, State University of New York at Stony Brook During the Sasanian period (ca. 224-651) the more an- cient Mesopotamian tradition of seal production continued to thrive. The purpose of our study was to determine the Sasanian method of seal manufacture and to compare this with our previously published research on Mesopotamian and Minoan seals and Egyptian scarabs. The material for our study was the corpus of 224 Sasanian seals in the Metro- politan Museum's collection, which had been documented in art historical and epigraphic detail by Christopher Brunner in 1978. Our method of investigation, previously described and published, involved a functional analysis including silicone impressions of the seals followed by light optical and/or scanning electron microscopy. About 150 silicone impressions were made. Some of our preliminary findings are the following: 1) Diamond drills had been used in about 15% of our sample. These seals form a distinct entity in size, shape, size of the drill hole, and drilling pat- tern within the drill hole. 2) The majority of the drills used were very likely made of iron. Evidence for the use of a tubular drill and a craftsman's error in drilling was also found. 3) Decoration of the outer surface of the seals was seen in 10 examples. Such decoration is unique in the his- tory of seal manufacture in the ancient Near East. Evi- dence for the method of decoration is documented. The Sasanian craftsmen clearly added to Near Eastern lapi- dary technology. GOURMETS, GLAMOR, GAMBLING, AND GLUTTONY: THE FAUNAL REMAINS FROM A PIT AT GRAVINA DI PUGLIA: Michael MacKinnon, University of Alberta Recent excavations at the site of Gravina located at the western limits of Apulia in southern Italy have uncovered an important pit full of a diverse mixture of table refuse and discarded items, dating to ca. 75 B.C. The results of an analysis of the faunal materials suggest that the occu- pants of the villa were relatively wealthy and appear to have conspicuously displayed their riches with social and dietary indicators. The collection is quite diverse. The remains of domes- ticated animals are common; many are butchered. Several lambs and a suckling pig are represented, as well as a few cattle elements and a collection of chickens. The remains of red deer, wild boar, lagomorph, and dove, however, in- dicate that wild resources were also hunted and consumed. A number of marine fish vertebrae and two cockle shells, one of which appears to contain some cosmetic, connect this inland site to coastal resources. An unusually large collection of in situ tortoise and snail shells may represent the remains of appetizers. Finally, worked-bone precursor materials and ground and drilled caprine astragali attest to a relatively sophisticated level of technology and a pen- chant for gambling. Based on the eclectic collection of faunal materials re- covered, it is possible that this pit contained the remains of a festive dinner party. One can imagine the host order- ing a luxurious banquet while his wife prettied herself with cosmetics. A game of astragali may have kept the guests entertained prior to the feast, when the prizes of the day's hunt and the pride of the animal stock from land, sea, and air were richly displayed and voraciously consumed. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF A ROMAN POTTERY ASSEM- BLAGE AT ANCIENT ISTHMIA:Jeanne Marty, Univer- sity of North Carolina at Asheville Between 1970 and 1972 extensive excavations were con- ducted at Poseidon's Isthmian Sanctuary under the direc- tion of Paul A. Clement of the University of California, Los Angeles, in an area immediately east of the main pre- cinct. Rather surprisingly, this "East Field" is a complex of what appear to be residences of the Late Roman period. Although the architecture is modest in character, a typo- logical study of the ceramic material has provided signifi- cant documentation of Late Roman wares in the Corin- thia and established important correlations with pottery found in the area east of the Theater at Corinth. Unfortunately, for reasons of storage much of the East Field ceramic material was discarded with only represen- tative pieces saved for research on the fabrics and the shapes that they represent. Recently, however, the material from that pottery dump has been reexcavated, offering the op- portunity to reconsider the assemblage. Building on our now-established typologies, we undertake a statistical analy- sis of this large body of material from the East Field. Our approach considers both the representative samples that were saved for study and the material resurrected from the pottery dump. The entire assemblage is analyzed and statistics used to aid in answering some questions (not asked in the initial excavations) about the area and the activities that took place there. Quantitative analysis of this assem- blage provides the best available evidence for understand- ing this important Panhellenic center in its final centuries as a religious precinct.</page><page sequence="27">322 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 99 ANALYSIS OF NEOLITHIC WARES FROM CHAERO- NEIA, GREECE: LOCAL AND FOREIGN INDUSTRIES: Douglas R. Parker and Hara Tzavella-Evjen, Uni- versity of Colorado Samples of pottery from Middle and Late Neolithic Chaeroneia have been subjected to various archaeometric analyses: petrography, X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence, and chemical studies. MN monochrome wares show pre- dominantly a quartz mineral with accessories of musco- vite, chorderite, and amphobolite. A few sherds (imports?) show basalt aplastic inclusions. Angular-shaped shale char- acterizes the gray and white wares. Distinctive changes, in- dicated by finely crushed granite temper, are observed at the later phase of MN. LN black wares show totally differ- ent raw materials: volcanic beach sand and micaceous clays pointing, possibly, toward contacts with Euboea. K. Hatzilazaridou (IGME) chemically analyzed only the white clay of the "Chaeroneia ware" pottery; the results show a high density of silicon and calcium, and the pres- ence of aluminum, magnesium, and minimal iron. An allu- vial origin of the clay is more probable than Neogene deposits. The predominant elements identified in the Neo- lithic ceramics and raw clays are iron, manganese, chro- mium, cobalt, titanium, and barium. Red, white, and "red on white" wares fall into one large group; black wares are divided into three groups. Some black wares with basalt temper or granite aplastic inclusions fall outside of the major categories. The MN ceramics were fired at ca. 6000C and, with few exceptions, all types could have been locally made. This is not the case for the LN black wares. ROBERT L. SCRANTON: IN MEMORIAM: Richard M. Rothaus, Oklahoma State University No abstract of this poster was submitted for publication. UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE-LEIDEN UNIVERSITY PROJ- ECT AT BERENIKE (RED SEA COAST), EGYPT, 1994: Steven E. Sidebotham, University of Delaware In January-February 1994 the University of Delaware and Leiden University conducted their first season of work at Berenike (Red Sea coast), Egypt. Berenike was an im- portant Ptolemaic-Roman emporium in the lucrative com- merce between the Mediterranean world, on the one hand, and India, Sri Lanka, Arabia, and sub-Saharan Africa, on the other. The project had several components. We drew a contour map and plan of Berenike, which when compared to one produced byJ.G. Wilkinson in 1826 revealed little signifi- cant natural damage to the site since that time; there has been recent vandalism by bulldozer. We began excavating two trenches to establish a ceramic chronology. There was a great deal of activity at Berenike (and elsewhere in the region) in the fifth-sixth centuries. Discovery of "native" ceramics raises questions about the origins of some of the port's inhabitants and their relationship with hinterland sites, the Nile valley, and the Roman government in this late period. We continued a survey (begun in 1990) of the roadsjoin- ing Berenike to the Nile emporia of Edfu (Apollinopolis Magna) and Qift (Coptos), finding two new forts, one at Rod el-Legah and another at the Samut gold mines. We began a survey of roads and sites near Berenike including a large (first-second and fifth-sixth century) and small (second-fourth century, possibly later) fort in the Wadi Kalalat, ca. 8-9 km southwest of Berenike, and fifth-sixth century sites (function unknown) at Shenshef and Hitan Riyan. We also visited the Ptolemaic and Islamic mines at El-Ileiga and the large Ptolemaic fort at Bir Abraq. Sur- face artifacts provided dates of activity at those sites; we pinpointed their locations and those of road segments and route-marking cairns using the Global Positioning System. BATHING IN LATE BRONZE AGE GREECE: Thea K. Smith, University of Cincinnati Examination of archaeological evidence furnishes sub- stantial information about bathtubs, bathrooms, and bathing in Late Bronze Age Greece. Texts from the Linear B archives at Pylos and Knossos augment the archaeolog- ical data. Larnax bathtubs are known from habitation contexts at a number of sites, both palatial and non-palatial. These larnakes exhibit similarities in size and construction, with some additional similarities apparent in decorative motifs and placement. Palatial bathrooms are known from Tiryns and Pylos, and have been suggested for Mycenae. The con- struction of these rooms and their layout and location all provide information about the practice of bathing in the Late Bronze Age. The location of these bathrooms near the megara of the palaces suggests the importance of bathing in Mycenaean palatial life. Finds in the bathrooms indicate how these rooms were furnished and appointed and suggest an elaborate procedure for bathing. Linear B texts relevant to bathing are found at both Pylos and Knossos. In some instances the texts probably record descriptions and inventories of bathtubs; in other instances they furnish personnel lists concerning bathing attendants. Some interesting correlations are found in the Homeric epic: all the major palaces have bathing facilities, as do some private homes. In epic, the duties of a bath atten- dant are described, and bathing scenes portrayed. COMPUTER MAPPING OF POMPEII: RESIDENCES, AM- PHITHEATER CAPACITY, AND POPULATION ESTIMA- TION: Glenn R. Storey, University of Iowa Estimating the population of ancient Roman cities is a difficult enterprise. Duncan-Jones (The Economy of the Roman Empire: Quantitative Studies2 [Cambridge 1985] ch. 6) set out the problems with most traditional approaches to population estimation. In my study, I take the approach of imitating a modern census by assigning occupant counts to the residences of Pompeii. I feature AutoCAD color- coded computer maps based on Hans Eschebach's 1981 map of Pompeii, which I used to identify and isolate exist- ing residential units and in which I reconstructed plausible residential architectural configurations in the unexcavated</page><page sequence="28">1995] THE 96TH ANNUAL MEETING 323 areas of the city. I present two AutoCAD maps of Pompeii that show two different approaches to the reconstruction of space in the unexcavated areas, one reconstruction as- suming a crowded urban scenario, the other reconstruc- tion assuming a less-crowded use of space. I also present the rationale for the occupancy counts applied to the resi- dential units. Finally, as a test of one method discussed by Duncan-Jones - the amphitheater capacity estimate - I offer a computer map of a capacity crowd at the amphi- theater to compare with the estimate made from the res- idence and occupant counts. I conclude by comparing my estimate with previous estimates, which supports the grow- ing consensus that the population of ancient Pompeii was around 10,000-12,000 inhabitants. MAPS FOR THE ATLAS OF THE GREEK AND ROMAN WORLD: Gavin A. Sundwall, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill This session provides an opportunity for colleagues to view the maps so far prepared for the Atlas of the Greek and Roman World, together with their physical bases and other accompanying materials, and to ask questions about them. Quite apart from the maps' intrinsic value, they can offer insight and illustration to anyone planning to make maps relating to classical antiquity for other purposes or at other scales. MULTIMEDIA APPLICATIONS FOR ARCHAEOLOGY: Thierry Vermeeren, Universite de Louvain-La- Neuve No abstract of this poster was submitted for publication. EARLY IRON AGE CERAMIC PRODUCTION AT TORONE, GREECE: A PETROGRAPHIC STUDY OF RAW MATE- RIALS PROCUREMENT: Ian K. Whitbread, Fitch Lab- oratory, British School at Athens A program of scientific analysis of Early Iron Age ceramics (organized by J. Papadopoulos) from Torone, Chalkidiki, excavated by the Australian Archaeological In- stitute at Athens, was in part prompted by the discovery of a Late Geometric kiln. The two primary aims of the analysis comprise identification of the local and imported fabrics, and determination of the potential sources of local raw materials. Samples have been taken of wheel-thrown and hand- built vessels, and of pottery found in association with the kiln. The range of local rock types (granodiorite, green- schist, limestone, and sandstone) meant that petrographic analysis played a major role in this investigation. Prospec- tion for clay sources was undertaken, focusing on lagoonal clays but also reflecting the varied regional geology in the area. A distinct range of clay sources was available to the an- cient potters. The sampled coarse wares generally reflect the granodioritic clays, and a good match was found with one of the clay samples of this type. Greenschist clays, closer in proximity to the site, appear to have been avoided. Sur- prisingly, pottery associated with the kiln occurs in a range of fabrics: some fabrics are granodioritic but others con- tain various local rock types. The latter fabrics are not well represented in the ceramic sample as a whole. IDENTIFICATION OF BEESWAX FROM ANCIENT BEE- HIVES: R.R Evershed, University of Bristol, and V Anderson-Stojanovic, Wilson College Samples taken from 41 vessels identified as beehives from Hellenistic and later deposits in the Sanctuary of Poseidon, the Rachi settlement, and the Fortress ofJustin- ian at Isthmia near Corinth have been analyzed for ab- sorbed organic residues by means of gas chromatography and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. This research represents one part of a long-term collaborative program of absorbed organic residue analysis between the Wiener Laboratory and the School of Chemistry, University of Bris- tol. The aims of the program are to assemble a mass spec- tra data bank of identified contents from ancient contain- ers from the Aegean, and to establish the degree of preservation and patterns of molecular degradation for specific organic components present in the contents of these ancient vessels. Lamps, storage and cooking vessels, and beehives are of particular interest. Preliminary results of analysis of the samples of ancient beehives from a variety of archaeological contexts at Isthmia demonstrate the good preservation of beeswax in archaeo- logical ceramic containers. These data have implications for the future identification of beeswax and honey in their role as important economic commodities, as well as their use for other domestic purposes, such as the lining of vessels, and the flavoring and scenting of oils used in cooking, lighting, and unguents. A REEXAMINATION OF HUMAN SKELETAL REMAINS FROM ARGOS AND LERNA: Sherry C. Fox, The Wiener Laboratory, American School of Clas- sical Studies at Athens The skeletal remains from eight individuals from the Hellenistic period, excavated at the site of Argos by the French School of Athens, and two individuals from the Roman period, excavated at the site of Lerna by the Ameri- can School of Classical Studies at Athens, are reexamined by noninvasive methods with an emphasis on the palaeo- pathologies of the entire skeleton. Previous studies of these skeletal collections by R.-P. Charles andJ.L. Angel were typo- logical, an analytical approach now considered obsolete by physical anthropologists. Furthermore, in the case of Charles's study, which focused upon the metric analysis of crania, palaeopathologies and anomalies of postcranial material were often overlooked. Occasionally, even Charles's determination of an individual's sex was incorrect. Today, more accurate methods for aging and sexing human skele- tal remains are possible. Angel's identification of "healed porotic hyperostosis" on the cranium of one individual is also reexamined and discussed. In addition to thorough cleaning of all the material,</page><page sequence="29">324 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 99 determination of sex, estimation of age at death, recon- struction of stature, and identification of anomalies and palaeopathologies were undertaken for each individual. Results of these analyses indicate that significantly more information can be gained from reexamination of skeletal collections using modern methods. ZOOARCHAEOLOGY AT PANAKTON: Yiannis Hamilakis, The Wiener Laboratory, American School of Classical Studies at Athens Zooarchaeology in Greece has entered a new phase in recent years, with more researchers working with animal bone collections and with the establishment of analytical facilities, such as comparative collections and specialized equipment. Still, its data base is biased toward certain periods and geographical regions. For example, historical periods are considerably underrepresented. The ongoing detailed study of the animal bone collection from the ex- cavations at Panakton (an upland site at the border between Attica and Boeotia overlooking the Skourta plain, which is thought to be the important Classical Athenian fortress) will help to rectify this situation. The excavation, carried out by Dr. Andreiomenou and Dr. Aravantinos (Greek Archaeological Service) and M. Munn (Stanford University), has revealed three main phases of occupation: Mycenaean, Classical, and Byzantine. The sample (ca. 8,000 identified fragments so far, excluding the material recovered by flotation) includes large mammals, microfauna, fish, and birds, and has been thoroughly col- lected, with dry sieving of the whole deposit and system- atic flotation, minimizing recovery bias. Its analysis and study will shed light on issues such as environmental re- construction, diet, animal husbandry practices, relations between polis and countryside, transhumance, sacrifice, and the symbolic and social role of animals. At the same time, this study will offer the opportunity to combine writ- ten sources and faunal material and, as a methodological exercise, to test the biases of both. A SYSTEMATIC PETROGRAPHIC STUDY OF ANCIENT LIMESTONE QUARRIES IN THE ANCIENT CORINTH REGION: Chris L. Hayward, The Wiener Labora- tory, American School of Classical Studies at Athens The study of construction stone and construction stone quarries can potentially yield a very large amount of in- formation and allow a wide variety of archaeological ques- tions to be addressed. The present study concerns ancient quarrying in the Corinthia. In this region, the conglom- erates and pure and sandy oolitic limestones of a Pleisto- cene transgressive sequence have been exploited as con- struction stone sources. The oolitic limestones with low siliclastic contents were the most widely used in the con- struction of ancient Greek and Roman public buildings, and this lithology forms the focus of the present study. An area of approximately 60 km2 in the region of Ancient Corinth, New Corinth, Isthmia, and Kenchreai was surveyed to locate ancient quarrying sites within the various lithological units of the transgressive sequence. Four major ancient centers of oolitic limestone quarrying within this area were selected for detailed examination. These centers lie in the region of the ancient settlements of Corinth and Kenchreai, and the modern village of Examilia in the northeastern Peloponnese. Each quarry has been geologically surveyed in detail with emphasis on the determination of the stratigraphic lithological varia- tion present. Each quarry has been systematically sampled, and detailed petrographic descriptions made of hand speci- mens and thin sections. Hand specimens are of very lim- ited use in differentiating unambiguously between oolites from different quarries. The thin section petrographic data, however, allow clear distinctions to be made between lime- stone from different quarries and also, in some cases, be- tween different areas within individual quarries. ARDUOUS LIFE AND VIOLENT DEATH IN BYZANTINE ATHENS: Lisa M. Little, The Wiener Laboratory, American School of Classical Studies at Athens The 1991 excavation of the Church of Agios Nikolaos in the Athenian Agora revealed a Byzantine tomb contain- ing a mature adult male. An examination of the burial's archaeological context and the pathological processes on the skeletal remains provides insight into life in Byzantine Athens. This tile burial lay to the west of the church in align- ment with its entrance. In the 12th-century wall, which crossed the foot of the tomb, an inverted column capital marked its location. All other burials associated with the church were located within multiple burial vaults in the church foundation. The tomb's common orientation with the church, as well as the uniqueness of the burial type and location, is explored for possible significance. Macroscopic and radiographic analyses of the palaeo- pathological evidence provide a view of health during the period. The observed pathological and traumatic lesions include cribra orbitalia, dental pathology, and antemor- tem tooth loss, a well-healed break of the left clavicle, spon- dylolysis of the fifth lumbar vertebra, os acromiale (non- fusion of the scapular acromion process due to physical stress), and osteoarthritis in the hands and feet. Cause of death, in most cases, cannot be determined from dry bone archaeological specimens. This individual is unique in that respect. An examination of the cranium reveals a violent death resulting from at least six blows with a metal weapon to the right side and back of the head. All of these aspects considered together give us an understanding of the health, life, and death of a Byzantine Athenian. RESULTS OF A FIELD SURVEY ON THE SOUTH SLOPE OF MOUNT PENTELIKON AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR SAMPLING: Scott Pike, The Wiener Laboratory, American School of Classical Studies at Athens The first systematic characterization study of the Mount Pentelikon marble quarries is currently under way. Recent</page><page sequence="30">1995] THE 96TH ANNUAL MEETING 325 research has suggested that there is a significant measur- able variation in petrographic, stable isotopic, and geo- chemical values among marble samples from different Pentelic quarries. Unlike previous provenance studies that have focused on obtaining a single characteristic signature for the entire Pentelic quarry region, the current study aims to derive signature values for individual quarries or groups of quarries. Before samples are collected, an exten- sive field survey of the quarry area is carried out. There are two goals of the survey. The first is to identify and record every ancient and modern quarry. The second is to gain an understanding of the local geology by taking geological and structural measurements. With this information a sampling program has been devised to assure that 1) a sample reference collection includes samples from all an- cient and modern quarries, and 2) the sample reference collection reflects the local geological conditions. This poster presents preliminary results of the field sur- vey on the south slope of Mount Pentelikon. A map dis- plays the location, size, orientation, and designation of every ancient and modern quarry, most quarry roads, and quarry waste piles. A geological map and cross-section dis- play the outcrop pattern and structure of the marble and mica-schist units. A brief interpretation of the maps is presented along with guidelines currently being employed on sample acquisition. A PHYTOLITH ANALYSIS OF RESINOUS SURFACE RESI- DUES FROM FIFTH-CENTURY B.C. SHERDS FROM THE ATHENIAN AGORA: Loeta Tyree, The Wiener Lab- oratory, American School of Classical Studies at Athens The purpose of this project was to determine if resi- nous residues from three fifth-century B.C. container frag- ments from the Athenian Agora contained phytoliths and, if so, if these were comparable to calcium phytoliths in modern wine sediment. Fresh white pine resin was also analyzed to determine if resin contains phytoliths but this work needs to be expanded to include other pines as well as heat-treated resin. The chance of recovering calcium phytolith from the ancient samples was slight due to the lack of visible evi- dence of wine and the likelihood that the sherds were cleaned with acid after excavation (with the consequential destruction of calcium phytoliths). Therefore, the oppor- tunity was taken to experiment with sample collection tech- niques and adapting nonacid phytolith extraction methods for modern plant material to small quantities of ancient residue. Although very few phytoliths were recovered from the ancient samples, they were comparable to calcium crystals from modern wine sediment and clearly distinguishable from olive oil sediment. An identification was not possible, however, because too few phytoliths were recovered, the forms that were found were not unique to grape products, and no single sample contained all three phytolith forms indicative of modern wine sediment. Consideration of prob- lems with possible ground water contamination was be- yond the immediate scope of this project. The project successfully demonstrated that calcium phytolith extraction techniques could be adapted to very small quantities of ancient residues from ceramic contain- ers. Samples as small as a 500-mg aspirin tablet were not only sufficient, with the use of 1.5-ml test tubes, but also allowed for replicates. Furthermore, the results of this proj- ect enabled the establishment of some basic guidelines for collecting ceramic surface residues for phytolith analysis. EARLY BRONZE AGE CYCLADIC POTTERY FROM NAXOS, KEROS, AND AMORGOS: Sarah J. Vaughan, The Wiener Laboratory, American School of Clas- sical Studies at Athens A long-term study of Early Bronze Age pottery from ex- cavated Cycladic settlements and sites on Naxos, Keros, and Amorgos has revealed both distinctive material tra- ditions and manufacturing technologies in the ceramic crafts of the period, in addition to evidence for trade and an interrelationship between the sculptors using local marble and contemporary potters. Pottery studied from the western coastal site of Grotta on Naxos (excavated by O. Hadjianastasiou) exhibits a rela- tively limited material range, consistent with the use of local clays, while the cave site of Zas (excavated by C. Zachos and A. Douzougli) reflects a wider range of ceramic fabrics, as would be expected from such a context. A comparable range of ceramic fabrics was found associated with the site of Kavos-Dhaskalio on Keros (surveyed by C. Doumas, L. Marangou, and A.C. Renfrew), though the presence of many imported fine wares distinguishes this site from the two on Naxos. Pottery studied from several Early Cycladic sites on Amorgos, including the fortified settlement of Markiani (excavated by C. Doumas, L. Marangou, and A.C. Renfrew), exhibits a marked preference by the ancient potters for two main fabrics utilizing local metamorphic constituents. One of these fabrics, Marble ware, is the subject of a spe- cialist study, as it provides remarkable evidence for a symbiotic relationship between the sculptors using the fine- grained marble resources of these three islands, and con- temporary potters who may have exploited marble debitage as temper for this ware, which has been identified on all three islands. SESSION III B: ROMAN SCULPTURE AND PORTRAITURE A LEAD-GLAZED TERRACOTTA EROS FROM MYTILENE: REFLECTIONS IN BRONZE AND CLAY: Kathleen Dona- hue Sherwood, Montreal Society Lead-glazed decoration is usually mentioned only in passing in handbooks on Greek terracotta figurines. Such figurines were produced for a short period of time - from approximately 50 B.C. to A.D. 50- at various sites in Asia Minor, most notably at Kyme, Myrina, Smyrna, and Tarsus. During this same period the streaked and mottled gold, brown, or green glazes also appear on pottery and lamps.</page><page sequence="31">326 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 99 S. Mollard-Besques (Les terres cuites grecques [1963] 90) sug- gests that the use of these glazes on terracotta figurines was an attempt to emulate the bronze patina or gilded sur- faces of similar statues in metal. InJune 1987 Canadian excavators at Mytilene unearthed a small lead-glazed terracotta statue of Eros from the area of the Hellenistic sanctuary of Demeter, which occupies the most prominent location on the ancient acropolis. It is now on display at the Mytilene Archaeological Museum (inv. 24231). Although the figurine is incomplete, it is pre- served from neck to lower legs and may be identified as Eros by the partially preserved wings protruding from its back. The youthful, muscular figure strides forward with left leg advanced and faces forward, while the entire torso and right leg twist to the right to face sideways. The left arm is raised and drawn back; the right is held forward and down. The pose echoes that of well-known figurines in terracotta from Myrina as well as small-scale works in bronze. This well-modeled, distinctively decorated figure of Eros illustrates the desire of poorer folk to imitate the fashions of the wealthy as well as epitomizing the shared artistic tradition current in both metal and clay, while plac- ing the city of Mytilene firmly within the sphere of influ- ence of the culturally dominant coastal cities of Asia Minor. APHRODITE NEWS: THE SO-CALLED SAPPHO HEAD FROM CORINTH: Mary C. Sturgeon, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Among the finest sculptures displayed in the Corinth Archaeological Museum is an over-life-size female head (T 246) found in the 1926 excavations of the Corinth Theater (T.L. Shear, AJA 30 [1926] 462-63, pl. VI). Although it was at first identified as Sappho, there is no evidence to support such an identification. Rather, the head most likely depicts a goddess, for the style and format bear a close relationship to heads of the Louvre-Naples Aphro- dite and Hera Borghese types. This paper investigates the figure's iconography, proto- type, and date of carving. The piece provides important evidence for late fifth-early fourth century sculptural trends. Its Peloponnesian origin contributes to its differ- ence from the largely Attic tradition. Furthermore, the clos- est parallels support an identification as Aphrodite. The statue is restored as part of the sculptural program of the Corinth Theater. SCULPTURAL COLLECTING AND DISPLAY AT THE VILLA OF MONTMAURIN (HAUTE-GARONNE): Lea M. Stirling, University of Manitoba From the villa of Montmaurin in the foothills of the Pyrenees comes a collection of stone sculptures that in- cludes statuettes of Victory, Venus, and Venus at the birth and death of Adonis, three male portraits, and a female head. I evaluate the reconstruction and iconography of the sculptures, offering a new interpretation of the Venus and Adonis groups, then discuss the display of statuary within the context of the fourth-century villa, and the sig- nificance of the collection to its owners. Findspots within the villa help reconstruct the display of sculpture. The most likely venues for display were the innermost court and reception room, the triclinia, and a nymphaeum in the bath quarter. This accords with evi- dence from other villas in the region, such as S6viac or N6rac. Sculptural decoration thus complemented the lavish geometric mosaics and marble revetment of the villa. The collectors' interest in portraiture stems from pietas and a desire to emphasize their family's distinguished line. A lit- erary expression of this interest is the Gallic rhetorician Ausonius's Parentalia, a series of poems describing his ex- tended family, and the elegy he inscribed under his father's imago (Epicedion). Aristocratic taste for both contemporary and antique examples of mythological sculpture derived from a Classics-based education and respect for traditional Roman culture. The choice of the Victory statuette may have been inspired by the Augustan victory monument at nearby Lugdunum Convenarum (Saint-Bertrand-de- Comminges). Through a close examination of the sculptural collec- tion at Montmaurin, I demonstrate methods for rediscover- ing the sculptural assemblages of Gallic villas and illustrate that, contrary to received opinion, Montmaurin and other Gallic villas were indeed well furnished with sculptural decoration. FIGURED PILASTER CAPITALS FROM APHRODISIAS: Sheila Dillon, Metropolitan Museum of Art This paper presents a group of marble figured pilaster capitals from the site of Aphrodisias in Caria. Found dur- ing excavation of the Tetrapylon area, these pilaster capi- tals seem to have decorated the upper story of a portico along the major north-south road leading from the Tetrapy- Ion to the theater. This refined series of figured capitals show Erotes engaged in a wide range of activities, includ- ing acorn picking, hunting wild boar, and fighting the chimaera. Two of the capitals are playful essays on famous Hellenistic genre sculptures: one shows an Eros as Sleep- ing Ariadne and another an Eros as a Spinario. This paper examines the iconography, style, and tech- nique of these pilaster capitals and compares them to other examples of the genre. The archaeological context and the date of the capitals are also discussed. The figured pilaster capitals from Aphrodisias provide a unique opportunity to study Roman architectural decoration in a public set- ting. These approximately 30 capitals are important evi- dence of the continued tradition and high level of creativ- ity of architectural decoration in Aphrodisias in the later Roman period. SMALL-SCALE PRIVATE PORTRAITS IN DOMESTIC CON- TEXTS: Georgina E. Borromeo, Chicago Society Despite the steady scholarly attention directed toward Roman portraiture, a particular type of portrait has still</page><page sequence="32">1995] THE 96TH ANNUAL MEETING 327 not been fully studied- the small-scale portrait. Two- and three-dimensional miniature portraits of emperors up to Caracalla have been discussed by Beate Schneider. During the same time period, however, portraits of imperial fam- ily members and unidentifiable Roman citizens were also made. Only the small-scale private portrait busts in the round are considered in this paper. "Private" denotes the persons portrayed - ordinary Roman citizens who were not members of the imperial family- and not the contexts of the portraits. "Small-scale" describes portraits whose di- mensions are smaller than life-size; in many cases they are half life-size and even smaller. Many of the extant small-scale private portraits of the Imperial period were originally displayed or used in do- mestic contexts. Some were undoubtedy ancestral portraits displayed in the alae of the houses of Roman aristocrats. As objects of commemoration, these portraits illustrate a continuation of the Roman ancestor cult. Along with these imagines maiorum, imagines illustrium were also show- cased in Roman homes during the Early Imperial period. The difference was that the ancestral portraits belonged in the atrium, and the portraits of illustrious men belonged in the garden. Literary sources indicate, however, that the imagines illustrium gradually made their way from the gardens into atria, and finally into the lararia themselves. By the time of Alexander Severus, portraits of ancestors and illustrious men from the past were included in the lararium, where previously only household gods and later emperors and members of the imperial family were allowed. It appears that the artistic aspect of the lararia as a group- ing of images gradually grew in importance and eventu- ally became as significant as the cultic aspect. Small-scale portraits of Roman citizens thus illustrate the continua- tion and enlargement of certain Roman traditions that allowed leading citizens to affirm their place in society dur- ing the Imperial period. IMPERIAL FACES: UNCANONICAL PORTRAITS OF TRAJAN AND HADRIAN IN ATHENS: Lee Ann Riccardi, Boston University The similarity of Roman imperial portraits from widely scattered parts of the empire has distorted modern studies regarding the faithfulness of provincial portraits to Roman models. Because imperial portrait sculptures are rarely found with intact inscriptions, they are generally identified by how well they recall models that do possess such inscrip- tions, usually numismatic portraits on official coinage. Por- traits that do not possess features similar enough to known types to be recognized are often misidentified or ignored. Two examples of imperial portraits that have been gen- erally disregarded in modern studies of faithfulness to official models are now in collections in Athens. The first, a portrait of a Roman emperor in the Kanellopoulos Mu- seum, has been identified as Galerius (G. Donatas, BCH 99 [1975] 521-33). A reexamination of this portrait in light of new research on provincial portraiture, however, sug- gests that it may instead present an unconventional image of Trajan. The second, a portrait of Hadrian from the Olympeion in Athens (M. Wegner, Hadrian [1956] pl. 26b), now in the National Archaeological Museum, likewise presents a portrait of an emperor whose official like- ness is well known, and yet this image also does not adhere closely to any Roman prototype. These uncanonical repre- sentations of Trajan and Hadrian, both long-ruling em- perors with recognizable official images, have important implications for the study of portraiture in Athens and the Greek world. A TYPOLOGY OF LATE ROMAN IMPERIAL HEAD- DRESSES: David Smart, Brown University A typological study of Late Roman imperial headdress types provides additional evidence to solve the identifica- tion and date of disputed portraits. Emperors were de- picted bareheaded or wearing wreaths or radiate crowns until Constantine, when a series of new headdress types appeared: the so-called "diadem," which quickly became standard on imperial portraits. The chronology of the Late Roman period includes many difficult problems, but im- perial headdress types are different from other surviving evidence. As the primary attribute on coins, they are leg- ible in sharp detail and a wide variety appears, often within a single reign. A securely dated series, therefore, can be assembled as the numismatic chronology is well established. Images of imperial headdresses proliferate in other media, and a comparison with coin types provides evidence for the identity and date of a number of Late Roman portraits. END OF AN ERA: A LATE ANTIQUE PORTRAIT FROM CORINTH: Catherine de Grazia Vanderpool, Ameri- can School of Classical Studies at Athens While the millennium-old tradition of marble carving seems to have dwindled almost to nothing in Late Antique Athens, across the Aegean and to the north the craft con- tinued to survive, if not thrive, well into the fifth century A.D. In late antiquity, Corinth, which had long turned to Athenian workshops and quarries for craft, materials, and inspiration, continued as a consumer of sculpture, if not producer, as attested by a relatively extensive archaeolog- ical record. As the Attic tradition faded, however, Corinth turned elsewhere. Among the most interesting finds of re- cent excavations in Corinth is a fragmentary male head that duplicates the well-known portrait bust of a man in Thessaloniki, itself grouped with a female portrait appar- ently carved as its pendant. The Corinthian fragment leads to a reconsideration of the Thessaloniki busts and related works from Sardis, Aphrodisias, and elsewhere, including Corinth itself. All share a sense of proportion, emphasis on chisel-carving over drill work, and plastic treatment of the flesh that recall a tradition descended from the best Attic workshops, a tradition that had by then perhaps "mi- grated" elsewhere, most probably to the north. This dis- tinctive style is in sharp contrast both to the Constantino- politan court style of imperial portraits and to a style typified by the highly expressive, but more abstract, ex-</page><page sequence="33">328 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 99 amples connected with Aphrodisias. The Corinth/Thessa- loniki group, portraying magistrates and priests, appears to be among the last examples of a tradition that soon yields completely to the different aesthetic of a Christianizing world amid receding paganism. SESSION III C: ROMAN GREECE EXCAVATIONS AT PHALASARNA, CRETE: FrankJ. Frost, University of California, Santa Barbara During the 1992 and 1993 seasons excavation at Phala- sarna concentrated on the complex of buildings to the im- mediate northwest of the harbor. In a large room were dis- covered four "bathtubs" cut from whole blocks of sandstone and then plastered. Excavation also continued along the edge of the harbor and in the eastern fortifications. At the north end of the harbor we cleared portions of a quay similar to that on the east side. Portions of the fourth- century curtain wall leading north from the large round tower were cleared, revealing a first-century inscription: a dedication to the goddess Akakallis, a west Cretan nymph/deity first mentioned by Apollonios Rhodios. During the same time, geomorphological reconstruction of the effects of two tsunamis by Pirazzoli et al. has made it possible to associate the geological record with literary descriptions of the same events. One stratum of large stones in the silted harbor may be dated to A.D. 66; the more extensive stratum, which probably coincided with the ca. 7-m uplift of all western Crete, is probably from the tsunami recorded by Ammianus Marcellinus, dated to 21 July 365. THE SO-CALLED APHRODISION AND ISAEUM OF KEN- CHREAI, GREECE: Richard M. Rothaus, Oklahoma State University Kenchreai, the eastern port of Corinth, was excavated throughout much of the 1960s under the direction of Robert Scranton. The excavators uncovered a variety of buildings and much of the harbor works. Two important structures-the Isaeum and the Aphrodision-have re- cently been reidentified and the stratigraphy of these struc- tures reevaluated. The removal of these structures from the realm of sacred architecture resolves many difficulties and changes our view of the nature of Kenchreai. At the northeast end of the harbor was a large, well- preserved brick building. Built in the first century A.D., it was enlarged in the fourth century to include a peristyle courtyard, multiple rooms (many paved with mosaics), a nymphaeum, and a large waterproofed room, apparently a pool. The structure was published as an Aphrodision, but this identification must be rejected. This building is, instead, a classic example of a Roman villa, worthy of far greater attention than it has received. Also problematic is the interpretation of the structure at the southwest end of the harbor as the sanctuary of Isis. The building is an apsidal construction, elaborately revetted, with mosaic floors, and a fountain centered in the apse. The apse is joined to a rectangular courtyard, apparently unroofed, and a colonnaded entrance "hall" The structure is a standard, but elaborate, nymphaeum. New stratigraphic and ceramic investigations have firmly dated the destruction of this structure, and the unique glass opus sectile panels found in it, to the decades around A.D. 400. DECORATION OF THE INTERIOR OF THE ROMAN BATH AT ISTHMIA:Jayne H. Philipp, University of Min- nesota-Twin Cities This paper presents the results of study of the interior decoration of the Roman Bath in the Sanctuary of Posei- don at Isthmia, and forms the first stage in the publica- tion of this material. The Bath was excavated in the 1970s under the direction of Paul A. Clement of the University of California, Los Angeles. The Ohio State University Ex- cavations at Isthmia, directed by Timothy E. Gregory, have recently continued investigation of this building, the ar- chitecture of which is being published by Fikret K. Yeguil. In some of its rooms the Roman Bath was elegantly dec- orated with pavements and revetments of colored marbles. In others, the floors were paved with mosaic. These were mostly non-figural, but the grand gathering hall preserves a monumental black-and-white style mosaic with Nereids and Tritons. Wall decoration included frescoes with vege- tal motifs and relief stucco in the Pompeian First Style. The Bath also contained a wealth of sculpture, including reliefs, figural pilaster capitals, and life-size and colossal statues. This paper offers a comprehensive interpretation of the decorative program in its architectural context through examining certain key issues. Of foremost concern is how the decoration of the Bath affects traffic patterns, influ- encing the visitor's movements and glances, and how it es- tablishes a hierarchy of spaces within the building. The iconographic implications of the decoration are also con- sidered, noting how its meaning corresponds to the loca- tion of the Bath within the Sanctuary of Poseidon. ATHENIAN BUILDING DEDICATIONS: A CASE FOR THE ROMAN STOA IN THE CITY ELEUSINION: Geoffrey C.R. Schmaltz, University of Michigan Recently the epigraphic record of Roman Athens has received renewed scrutiny. Still largely ignored, however, are the dozen or so building dedications surviving from the early principate (ca. 20 B.C. to A.D. 100). These dedi- cations are of two types, with renovations to existing struc- tures being recorded on commemorative stelae while new constructions carried more prominent dedications along their architrave. While these dedications have contributed to later Athenian prosopography, they have yet to be ex- amined as a distinct body of evidence. The first part of this paper highlights the potential significance of build- ing dedications for the history of Roman Athens. The second part presents a small case study, having to do with building activity within the city Eleusinion during the lateJulio-Claudian period. At this time a long stoa (over</page><page sequence="34">1995] THE 96TH ANNUAL MEETING 329 25.40 m) was constructed along the south side of the newly expanded sanctuary. Although this stoa was the first major addition to the Eleusinion since the fourth century B.C., it holds only a marginal place in the scholarship of the Agora because of the absence of a recognized superstruc- ture. Consideration is given to the distinct possibility that a contemporary architraval dedication (Agora I 678) rep- resents the remains of the stoa's facade, since it may be restored with the names of Demeter and Kore as the ded- icatees. Dated to the archonship of Herodes (IV) of Mara- thon (ca. A.D. 48/9), this dedication also provides evidence for the career and benefactions of that eminent Athenian. THE ROMAN ARENA IN THE GREEK EAST: ATHENS AND CORINTH: Katherine Welch, Harvard University Gladiatorial shows were as popular in the Greek East as in the Roman West. By the second century A.D. most Greek theaters had been converted for gladiatorial games. Athens undertook such a conversion first, in the late first century A.D. (the Theater of Dionysos). Dio Chrysostom (31.121) and Lucian (Demon. 57) record that the Athenians adopted gladiatorial shows out of ri- valry with the Corinthians, and Corinth is indeed one of the few Greek cities with an amphitheater. This amphi- theater remains unexcavated and its date undetermined. It seems likely, however, that it was planned and built dur- ing the Roman colonization of 44 B.C. This is suggested by its location at the edge of the colonial grid, and by its construction (rock-cut arena and probable wooden super- structure), which is similar to other Late Republican am- phitheaters. The precocious interest of the Corinthians in gladiatorial combat is explained best by the settlement of Caesarian veterans. Other Greek cities with amphi- theaters (Knossos, Patrae, and Gortyn) had the same colo- nial status and a similar population of ex-soldiers. In a colony such as Corinth, gladiatorial games served as an indication that the population was, in some sense, ethnically Roman, distinct from Hellenic communities else- where in Achaea. The adoption of gladiators by cities such as Athens was a response to this assertion of status. But why did Greeks convert their theaters instead of building oval amphitheaters as happened in the West? Per- haps amphitheaters were not needed because gladiatorial games were held only a few days a year during the impe- rial cult festival; yet this is not an adequate explanation since western cities also held gladiatorial shows for only a few days each year. It may not have been practical to con- struct amphitheaters, since most Greek cities already had theaters that could be converted for gladiatorial shows. I also suggest that the Greeks were not eager to adopt a building type that had Roman colonial and military associations. SESSION III D: CYPRUS UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA EXPEDITION TO IDALION, 1993 AND 1994 SEASONS: Pamela Gaber, Univer- sity of Arizona During the 1992 season of the University of Arizona Expedition to Idalion, Cyprus, a sacred precinct dedicated to a Cypriot god (identified in Greek as "Apollo Amyklos") was discovered. In 1993 and 1994 the University of Ari- zona team returned to the site to excavate the temenos. What may be the final five phases of architecture in the temenos were discovered in 1993. It became clear that plans of the sanctuary published by R. Hamilton Lang in 1878 combine walls that were constructed centuries apart. Several installations were found among the layers ex- cavated in 1993. One contained an oven set into bedrock. Sulfurous deposits consistent with copper processing were found in the ash deposits surrounding the oven itself, and a deposit of vessels and stone grinders found among the phase 4 walls. Tree pits cut into bedrock around the struc- tures may indicate a sacred grove. The peribolos wall was traced around three sides of the temenos area, revealing a 6-acre area within the temenos walls. During the 1994 season work resumed in the sacred pre- cinct. The Hellenistic entryway was found, connected to the northern peribolos wall on either side. Below the Hel- lenistic gateway, blocks are visible that may be part of the earlier Classical entrance. Two probes revealed a structure originally uncovered by Lang in the 19th century, together with a single wall of what may prove to be an outdoor altar. In addition, phas- ing of construction in the Hellenistic and Roman struc- tures was clarified, revealing a far more extensive phase 1 than previously recognized. Many pits cut into bedrock and stone-lined bins of unclear purpose were found to be- long to the earliest phase of construction on the northern terrace of the temenos. ATHIENOU ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROJECT, 1994: THE FIFTH SEASON OF INVESTIGATIONS AT ATHIENOU- MALLOURA, CYPRUS: Michael K. Toumazou, David- son College, R Nick Kardulias, Kenyon College, and Richard W Yerkes, Ohio State University The Athienou Archaeological Project, sponsored by Davidson College, conducted its fifth season of investiga- tions at the site of Athienou-Malloura and the surrounding valley between 7 June and 23 July 1994. The Archaic- Roman rural sanctuary was the main focus of this year's investigations. Our objectives were the horizontal expan- sion and excavation into deeper levels in order to ascer- tain the sanctuary's limits and earlier history. A new area (EU 12) and three long exploratory trenches (EUs 90, 92, and 94) were dug to the north and west. Moreover, geo- physical prospection (electrical resistivity and magnetome- try) as well as balloon photography were undertaken in the area. Despite heavy pitting, the south and east temenos walls, both measuring now ca. 19 m, continue into the balks in- dicating that the sanctuary, at least in its final phase, was larger than previously suspected. Beneath the Hellenistic- Roman "floor" enclosed by the temenos walls were found three walls associated with Cypro-Archaic II and Classical pottery, and terracotta figurines (e.g., helmeted warriors, chariots, horses, centaurs). A segment of a circular feature</page><page sequence="35">330 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 99 associated with intense burning may prove to be part of the sanctuary's altar. As in past years the majority of the finds comprised frag- mentary limestone statuary ranging in size from a few centi- meters to life-size. Most impressive is an Archaic/sub-Archaic life-size statue of a votary with intricately carved drapery. Another finely proportioned torso is draped with a sensi- tively-almost sensually--carved chiton; though clearly male, its generously proportioned upper torso suggestively recalls a Hellenistic Hermaphroditic figure. Aside from three Pan statuettes (also Hellenistic), the only other clearly discernible divinity was that of Baal-Hammon represented by two small reliefs of standard iconography, and associ- ated with the earlier (Archaic II/Classical) phase(s) of the sanctuary. A fourth rock-cut tomb (T.28) of Hellenistic-Roman date was cleared in the cemetery north of the sanctuary. In most respects it resembles tombs 25 and 26 (cleared between 1991 and 1993), comprising a broad stepped dromos with a spacious forecourt and a burial chamber with three benches. Though looted, the tomb yielded large amounts of disarticulated bones and pottery, some 20 coins, and a variety of other furnishings. The field survey in the Malloura valley has thus far re- corded 30 sites in the 20-km2 survey area. Site and artifact distribution data are being entered in a GIS data base, and a geomorphological survey of the valley is planned for the spring of 1995. AN APHRODITE AND EROS STATUETTE FROM ANCIENT MARION: EVIDENCE FOR CULTURAL PLURALISM IN CULT RITUAL: Nancy Serwint, Arizona State University Although a site of religious worship can be identified archaeologically by votive objects or architectural remains, distinguishing the nature of cult worship is less secure. No- where is this more problematic than on Cyprus where, in antiquity, multiple cultural influences from the Near East and the Greek world resulted in the coexistence of Hellenic and Eastern religious traditions. At the site of Marion in northwest Cyprus, well known for the imported Attic pottery found in its necropoleis, the excavation of a sanctuary of Archaic/Classical date has produced an abun- dance of votive objects among which was an Aphrodite and Eros statuette unique on Cyprus. Its iconographic and stylistic characteristics are similar to those of the group of Aphrodite and her son from the east frieze of the Par- thenon, thus confirming Greek influence. Its presence as a votive offering secures the identity of the cult of Aphro- dite within the sanctuary and corroborates worship of the goddess in her Greek aspect. Other votive objects found in close proximity to the Aphrodite and Eros statuette, however, are more appropriate to the goddess's Near East- ern counterpart. The coexistence of votives reflecting di- verse religious traditions indicates the cultural pluralism present at Marion, long regarded as one of the most Greek of the Cypriot city kingdoms. However keen the Greek persona of the goddess had been within the Marion sanc- tuary, the cult remained fluid enough to permit assimi- lation of elements properly belonging outside of the Hel- lenic world. A NEW KING OF SALAMIS IN CYPRUS DURING THE FIFTH CENTURY B.C.: Kaelyn A. McGregor, Univer- sity College, London Salamis, as the most important kingdom in Cyprus dur- ing the Archaic and Classical periods, is central for our understanding of the history of the eastern Mediterranean. Our knowledge of Salamis, indeed of Cyprus, in the sixth and fifth centuries B.C. is meager. Herodotos (5.104), our only historical informant, reports the list of the Salamin- ian dynasty from Euelthon to the time of the Ionian revolt. Literary evidence surfaces again only with the reign of Euagoras I (beginning in 411 B.C.), with the orations of Isocrates, thus leaving it to archaeologists and historians to investigate and fill in the names of the Salaminian dy- nasty for most of the fifth century B.C. Prior to this study, scholars had uncovered the names of two other kings of Salamis, Nikodamos and Euanthes, both reigning before the short period of Phoenician domi- nance, during the last third of the fifth century. New evi- dence, in the form of inscriptions, divulges the name of a king probably reigning prior to Nikodamos and Euanthes, during the second quarter of the fifth century. The Cyp- riot syllabic inscription clearly indicates the name of a King Phausis or Pausiose, a name hitherto unknown in this dy- nasty. With the addition of this new ruler, it is now possible to update, if not complete, the line of descendants of King Euelthon of Salamis. AN UNPUBLISHED INSCRIPTION FROM TALA: NEW EVI- DENCE FOR THE PAPHIAN CITY KINGDOM AND THE CULTS OF CYPRUS: Georgia Bonny Bazemore, Cyprus American Archaeological Research Institute, Nicosia There are few individuals in Cypriot history for whom we have more than one syllabic document. Satrapas is such a person. Two inscriptions of Satrapas were found in a rock- cut, subterranean cult area near the city of Nea Paphos; a third was found in 1988, built into a wall of an aban- doned church near the small village of Tala, north of Nea Paphos. In the summer of 1993, a fourth inscription turned up, again from the village of Tala, but this time a bilingual example, with an accompanying Greek text. This most re- cent inscription was written on fine marble, and seems, as the other inscriptions from Tala, to have been an archi- tectural piece. The only other person in the Paphian kingdom known from as many inscriptions as Satrapas is King Nikokles, the probable founder of Nea Paphos. Nikokles was the last Paphian king to use the syllabic form of writing and there- fore is a probable contemporary of Satrapas. Who is this Satrapas, if, as the alphabetic inscriptions lead us to be- lieve, that was even his name? What is the title of Archos,</page><page sequence="36">1995] THE 96TH ANNUAL MEETING 331 which Satrapas holds in all four inscriptions? What was the position of the site of Tala to the newly founded city of Nea Paphos? And perhaps most intriguing of all, why does such a seemingly important person dedicate inscrip- tions to deities other than the native Paphian goddess? The inscriptions of Satrapas raise many interesting ques- tions and provide tantalizing epigraphic clues for Paphian cult and politics in the fourth century B.C. REFLECTIONS OF THE PTOLEMAIC COURT STYLE IN THE ARCHITECTURE OF CYPRUS: Pippa Vanderstar, Oxford University Under the Ptolemies of Egypt in the Hellenistic period, Cyprus lost forever its independent city kingdoms and be- gan its existence as a province of Egypt. Ptolemaic rule was certainly felt on the island with a sizable military pres- ence. The Cypriot capital was shifted from Salamis to Nea Paphos on the south coast, closer to the capital of the Ptole- mies, Alexandria. The united island enjoyed a peaceful time. The benefits of Ptolemaic patronage were apparent in an increase in the number of cities, the flourishing of the arts, and enhancement of urban centers. Ptolemaic presence on Cyprus encouraged the Hellen- ization that is reflected in the epigraphical sources. A full range of public institutions is attested with renewed vigor, and to a degree unencountered before. The desire of local inhabitants to keep up with the ruling regime is seen in the religious, cultural, and artistic life, as Egyptian gods and the ruler cult are imported, along with a cosmopoli- tan Ptolemaic court style in sculpture and architecture. A rich corpus of religious and civic buildings provides solid evidence to place Cyprus in its wider context within the eastern Mediterranean during the Hellenistic period. An examination of the monuments and the traditional Greek orders draws the island firmly into the embrace of contemporary architectural fashion centered on the Ptole- maic court. Material from recent excavations both in Cyprus and Egypt, hitherto overlooked, and undated architectural elements stored in the museums of Cyprus attest to the sophistication and variety of the Hellenistic repertoire em- ployed on Cyprus, and provide stunning reflection of the architectural vocabulary of Hellenism. SESSION IV A: AIA/APA JOINT COLLOQUI- UM: RETHINKING NERO'S LEGACY: NEW PERSPECTIVES ON NERONIAN ART, LITER- ATURE, AND HISTORY NERO'S CHARACTER: FACILITATORS, RESTRAINERS, AND TURNING POINTS: TJ. Luce, Princeton University The reign of an emperor in the first century A.D. was frequently seen through the lens of his character, both how it came to take the form it did, and what effect it had on events writ large. One popular approach to this question among ancient historians was to examine "turning points" in a reign, which partially or in large part were triggered by a change that affected the character of the emperor. The most obvious example is the start of Tacitus Annals 4, where the pernicious influence of Sejanus is said to have led to a marked and precipitous turn for the worse in Tiberius. A second popular approach, sometimes com- bined with the first, was to look at the phenomenon of "facilitators/restrainers" on the emperor's character. Facili- tators (like Sejanus) pander to an emperor's fears and de- sires, initially most often secret ones, by encouraging him to act as he really wishes; restrainers (like Seneca in the case of Nero) attempt to rein in an emperor's evil procliv- ities in order to prevent an emperor's worst traits from coming to full expression. This approach to an emperor's character is well illustrated in Tacitus's portrait of Tibe- rius and his circle, which constitutes the emperor's retro- spective obituary (Ann. 6.51). Tacitus, Dio, and Suetonius are the chief sources for the reign of Nero, and all three used the concepts of character and restrainers/facilitators to explain events of the reign. An examination of Nero's character and its presentation in ancient authors may reveal how character was generally viewed: whether fixed at birth or changeable, and how much effect inborn character vs. environmental and external factors had on actual behavior. REVISION OF REVISIONISM: NERO IN MODERN HIS- TORIOGRAPHY: Vasily Rudich, Yale University This paper reexamines the appreciation of Nero found in what may be called "revisionist" historical writings, start- ing with the late 19th century, and continuing to the pres- ent day. It begins with the assessment of our extant sources in terms of Latin, Greek, and Jewish traditions with an emphasis on Nero's near-contemporaries, such as Pliny the Younger, Dio Chrysostom, Plutarch, and FlaviusJosephus. This is followed by a brief inquiry into the causes of Nero's popularity with the masses. The bulk of the argument deals with the tangle of methodological issues central to the mod- ern treatment of the available evidence and interpretation ofJulio-Claudian Rome: the criteria of plausibility in the accounts of our main authorities; the comparative analy- sis of their narratives; and their possible biases. I also offer a review and critique of the revisionist schol- arly views on Nero from H. Schiller onward, with com- ments on the characteristic opposition of political and eco- nomic, as well as literary and historical, concerns. I discuss the ideologies and philosophies of history that underlie the modern approach-historicism, Marxism, structural- ism, cultural relativism, social constructionism- and their effects on the study of Nero and his era; and I caution against some fallacies, like projecting upon the past our expectations of consistency in behavioral patterns and mental processes. The paper concludes with a few remarks on the subject of historical psychology regarding both the ancient authors and their modern interpreters as the means to elucidate the motives operating behind the traditional and revision- ist pictures of Nero.</page><page sequence="37">332 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 99 SISTERS AND MOTHERS OF TYRANTS: THE CASE OF AGRIPPINA, DRUSILLA, AND LIVILLA: Susan Wood, Oakland University During the reigns of both Caligula and Nero, women of the imperial family achieved uprecedented public honors. The vilification of both these hated emperors in later tradition, however, follows a predictable format that includes charges of disregard for the most sacred taboos, in particular the prohibition against incest. The reputa- tions of their sisters and mother, respectively, have con- sequently suffered "collateral damage" that distorts their true historical significance. This paper supplements a crit- ical reading of the ancient historians with the iconographi- cal evidence of coins and of sculpture, in which Caligulan portrait types for Agrippina II and Drusilla can be at least tentatively distinguished. I contend that Caligula's sisters owed their public honors to their potential to bearJulian children. Drusilla, the heir of Caligula's imperium in his will of A.D. 37, was probably intended to produce male heirs while her husband wielded actual power. Her untimely death must have been a dy- nastic disaster; her deification would be an attempt to put the best possible face on a bad situation by keeping her in public imagery as a symbolic genetrix of theJulians. Pro- vincial coinages suggest that the consecration was well re- ceived, while the public presentation of all three sisters in statuary groups seems to grow logically from existing practices among aristocratic private families. Caligula's glorification of his sisters, like his demand for divine honors, appears to have been a rational decision distorted by hostile writers as evidence of his psychotic arrogance, and set important precedents for the Neronian period. NERO IMPERATOR: MILITARY IMAGERY AND THE POR- TRAITS OF NERO: Eric R. Varner, Emory University Nero's famous words, qualis artifex pereo (Suet. Ner. 49.1), have ensured that he is remembered as Rome's most ar- tistic emperor, a dilettante interested in performance and poetry who was incapable of successfully quelling the in- surrections that plagued the last years of his reign. And in fact, Nero was not an active military commander and never led his troops in battle. Nevertheless, a close exami. nation of Nero's extant portraits, especially those that were reworked into likenesses of his Flavian successors, Vespa- sian and Domitian, reveals that military imagery was a cru- cial component of Neronian visual propaganda. Despite Nero's own personal inclinations and artistic pursuits, the military conception of the princeps, which had been established by Augustus, continued to be a vital part of imperial ideology. Over 12 sculpted, relief, and glyptic representations ofNero, as well as numerous numis- matic likenesses, portrayed the emperor as victorious im- perator. Furthermore, all four of Nero's established portrait types are represented among the military images of the princeps. Cuirassed portraits of Nero were first dissemi- nated when Nero was still a child during the reign of his uncle and adoptive father Claudius, and continued to be distributed until the end of Nero's own principate. Military depictions of the emperor may have been de- signed to counteract popular perceptions of the emperor as an aesthete and to indicate that Nero was in control of military affairs. Three surviving cuirassed statues of Nero, subsequently recarved to represent Domitian, were created between 59 and 68, and vicariously capitalize on Gn. Domitius Corbulds military and diplomatic victories in Parthia. The military images of Nero provide a crucial link between the portraits of his Julio-Claudian predecessors as victorious imperatores and the pervasive military iconog- raphy of the Flavian dynasty. THE TRAGICAL NERO: TRAGEDY AND TACITEAN HISTo- RIOGRAPHY IN THE NERONIAN HEXAD: A.R. Keller, Colgate University Tacitus's historiographical method is directly linked to the place of the Annals within the hierarchy of evidence for Nero's reign. Tacitus's allusions to the role played by the gods, fate, and fortune hold much significance for his version of events as outlined in the Neronian hexad (i.e., Ann. 12.43, 14.5.1, 16.13.1, 16.16.3, 16.33.1). His presentation of Nerds reign, while certainly grounded in the rhetorical technique common to so much of ancient historical writ- ing, is guided on another important level by his interpre- tation of Roman history in a tragic context. Tacitus describes how the general structure of the regime and particular episodes that occurred during it bear a striking relation- ship to the structure of tragedy. This Tacitean interpreta- tion of Nerds reign is made possible by his recognition of the relationship between actual events and the inter- pretation of those events given both by participants and onlookers. The latter group clearly includes public opin- ion and the historians from whom Tacitus drew his account. This understanding of the Annals is based on a reading of the Dialogus as the work in which Tacitus positions his historiographical approach between silver oratory and tragedy: Tacitus's histories seek to mediate the distance between an oratory that has been emasculated by the ex- igencies of life under the Empire and a Maternus's histori- cal tragedy of old Republicans that is overshadowed by the extraordinary- monstrous and magnificent- events of the day. Tacitus seeks to display how in the Neronian age the tragic sensibilities of all concerned played themselves out for each of the "participants" in the historical drama he constructs. In order to understand Tacitus's interpretation of events, one must distinguish carefully the variety of nar- rative levels present in the ways in which each of the characters- mothers and wives, philosophers and libertines, the populace and the princeps-interpret the events in which they are caught up. The role attributed to the extra- human in the Annals is readily apparent in a number of odd details in the narration of the deaths of Agrippina, Octavia, Britannicus, and Seneca, and the fire in Rome. Tacitus's own understanding of tragedy has a direct bear- ing on the valuation of the "historicity" of Tacitus's Neronian account. VIEWER AND VOYEUR IN NERONIAN PAINTING:John R. Clarke, University of Texas at Austin Research on art and its audience in the age of Nero has focused on the issue of theatricality. In the wall paintings of the Domus Aurea the representation of the scaenae frons</page><page sequence="38">1995] THE 96TH ANNUAL MEETING 333 takes on great importance. Although artists had used the scaenae frons to organize tromp lbeil representations of archi- tecture on flat wall surfaces since the mid-first century B.C., for many scholars its new prominence in the Fourth Style schemes of the Neronian age parallels Nero's own interest in the theater. The motif of the scaenae frons requires a different protocol of viewing from Fourth Style schemes that employ fictive tapestry panels or other plain devices. Figures appear either on the shallow stage at the base of the scaenae frons or framed by the rectangular slots of multiple, stacked aediculae. Although the viewer can under- stand the figures on the stage as actors in a drama, as in the House of Pinarius Cerialis at Pompeii, who are the men and women framed in the aediculae? Some of them descend stairs making it likely that they are actors about to enter the drama. Others, however, simply appear framed by the aediculae and looking out- either at the action or at the viewer. A second use of the device of the onlooker occurs in many of the mythological pictures that form the central focus of Neronian walls. The artist adds figures to otherwise straightforward representations of a narrative. D. Michel has identified them as stand-ins for the viewer, placed in the picture frame to increase the viewers' participation in the event (La regione sotterata dal Vesuvio [Naples 1982] 537-98). Although I accept Michel's premise in general, I would like to consider these onlooker figures together with the spectator figures in the scaenae frons decorations. Together, they invite the viewer to enter the spectacle through a kind of visual ekphrasis. These figures "embody" the fictive space of the scaenae frons or the mythological picture by standing where the viewer should imagine him-or herself to stand. In this way, the viewer loses his or her passive relationship to the visual representation and gains a vivid intimacy with the spectacle. These de- vices of embodying illusionistic space, whether the fictive architectural space of the scaenae frons or the pictorial space of the central picture, strengthen the return to illu- sionism that had begun, rather tentatively, with Claudian Fourth Style decorations. This artistic embodiment of the viewer makes him or her into a voyeur, paving the way for the often bombastic assault on the viewer that character- izes many Flavian painting programs (e.g., the House of the Vettii at Pompeii). SESSION IV B: AEGEAN PREHISTORY I RECOVERING GENDER IN THE GREEK NEOLITHIC: A VIABLE GOAL? Tracey Cullen, American Journal of Archaeology, and Lauren Talalay, Kelsey Museum of Archaeology In discussions of Greek prehistory, gender has often been attached casually or implicitly to various roles or oc- cupations: hunters are generally assumed to have been male, gatherers female; potters are usually female, and flintknap- pers invariably male. Early seafarers, itinerant artisans, and heads of households are surely conceptualized as male by most, however careful we have come to be in our use of pronouns. In considering the structure of social and po- litical relations during the Neolithic, some scholars envis- age a paradise of equality, while others have argued for matrilineal or patrilineal systems, often on rather obscure grounds. In this paper we demonstrate the insecure basis for many of these assumptions, and examine two aspects of the archaeological record of Neolithic Greece in which men can be separated from women: figurine production and funerary customs. The majority of anthropomorphic fig- urines in which sex is explicitly depicted are female, with clearly articulated breasts and pubic area. Figurines with male attributes are found much less frequently, while a substantial percentage of images appear to be sexless or sexually ambiguous. Moreover, male images generally do not receive decorative elaboration whereas females are often ornately painted or incised, suggesting ritual dress or body paint. The small mortuary sample from Neolithic Greece dis- courages generalization, but some grounds exist for sug- gesting that males and females received different treat- ment at death: in the location of their graves, the proximity to children's graves, and in the frequency and type of grave goods deposited. In short, males are not as visible as fe- males in either figurine or funerary samples. Our attempt to relate this observation to gender distinctions in Neo- lithic Greece is complicated by the symbolizing aspects of mortuary ritual and figurine imagery, and raises crit- ical questions about the feasibility of recovering gender from the archaeological record. THE PRODUCTION OF PERSONAL ORNAMENTS AND CRAFT SPECIALIZATION IN THE GREEK NEOLITHIC: Michele A. Miller, Boston University Recent studies have begun to challenge the traditional view of simple agriculturally based village communities of the Greek Neolithic and envision a more complex econ- omy including craft specialization and interregional trade during that period. Although the production, consump- tion, and distribution oflithics and ceramics have received more attention, the economic system of prestige goods dur- ing the Neolithic is comparatively less understood. This paper reviews evidence for the specialized produc- tion of personal ornaments, and discusses their possible role as prestige goods. Evidence from Franchthi Cave, along with ethnographic analogy and replication experiments, allows the detailed reconstruction of the manufacture of beads of Cerastaderma (cockle) shell and stone, and may indicate the specialized production of these objects. The identification of the bead manufacturing process and re- suiting dobitage at Franchthi has enabled the author to examine the evidence for specialized ornament manufac- ture at other Greek Neolithic sites. Further study will clarify the function and distribution of these ornaments and thus develop a picture of the economic system of Neolithic orna- ments as prestige objects. BOTHROI IN THE AEGEAN EARLY BRONZE AGE: Thomas E Strasser, Indiana University Bothroi are underground pits that are usually clay-lined or stone-cut. They are a seemingly common feature in Early</page><page sequence="39">334 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 99 Bronze Age sites in the Aegean. There has been, however, no evaluation of bothroi since 1935 when R. Hutchinson wrote a synthesis (JHS 55:1-19). Despite almost six decades of prehistoric research in the Aegean since Hutchinson's essay, no bothroi have been discovered on Crete or in the Cyclades. While Early Cycladic and Early Minoan excavated settlements are not as numerous as Early Helladic sites, the complete absence of bothroi in the Cyclades and Crete cannot be explained by sample size alone. This paper re- evaluates all known evidence for bothroi in the Aegean, and discusses reasons for their uneven spatial distribution. It is difficult to explain the absence ofbothroi from Crete and the Cyclades because their function remains elusive. Several interpretations have been suggested, but Hutch- inson concluded that they were either drainage sumps or silos. Hutchinson's interpretations have interesting ramifica- tions in light of the absence of bothroi from the Cyclades and Crete. If they were drainage sumps, their absence could reflect architectural differences, possibly roofing tech- niques. If they were silos, this could suggest that house- hold storage practices on Crete and the Cyclades were differ- ent from those on the mainland. In either case, the presence of numerous bothroi on the Greek mainland and in West- ern Anatolia is another indicator of the cultural similarity between these two regions. Conversely, their absence on Crete and the Cyclades reflects an aspect of daily life that differed among EBA societies in the Aegean and there- fore may be considered a reliable cultural marker in fu- ture research. A LATE MINOAN I OBSIDIAN WORKSHOP AT PSEIRA, CRETE: Heidi M.C. Dierckx, Culver-Stockton Col- lege, and Cheryl R. Floyd, Temple University The excavations at the Minoan settlement of Pseira (1988-1991), a small island off the northeast coast of Crete, have uncovered a substantial amount of obsidian chipped stone implements and debitage. A large concentration of obsidian debris was found in one building in the settle- ment in particular, Building BY, and also in adjacent areas (Building BB, Plateia BR, and the Byzantine monastery AL). The date for the use and deposition of the obsidian chipped stone in Building BY can be established from the pottery found in the same context; the last use of the build- ing can be dated to the LM IB period, when it was destroyed and abandoned together with the rest of the settlement. The obsidian from the adjacent areas is included as part of the assemblage because this whole area was heavily dis- turbed after the destruction when building material was reused in Byzantine times. This paper examines the different types and possible uses of the obsidian tools and debitage products; all stages of obsidian knapping can be distinguished. Additional evi- dence includes some ground stone implements used in the knapping process. The evidence strongly suggests the existence of an obsidian workshop in Building BY, located on the second story. This would be the first workshop of LM I date to be identified on Crete; two other workshops on Crete have been recognized of EM date at Knossos and Mallia. MINOAN STONE LAMPS OF THE MIRABELLO BAY AREA: UTILITARIAN OBJECTS AND SOCIAL ARTIFACTS: Ann C. Blasingham, American School of Classi- cal Studies at Athens A typology of Minoan stone lamps was first set forth by Peter Warren, in Minoan Stone Vases (Cambridge 1969). This typology was, however, based on only a few criteria relating primarily to form and motifs of decoration. New and more comprehensive criteria for establishing a typol- ogy of Minoan stone lamps are proposed in this paper, with examples drawn from major Minoan sites through- out Crete. The typology thus produced suggests that stone lamp making could be as sophisticated a craft in the prov- inces as in the palatial centers during the Neopalatial period. One provincial area in particular stands out as a pro- ducer of stone lamps for local use: the Mirabello Bay re- gion, and within it notably the sites of Pseira, Mochlos, and Gournia. In addition to a high standard of craftsman- ship applied to locally obtained materials, the artisans of these communities used a variety of moldings and decora- tive motifs, which appear in their most elaborate forms on products of the palatial centers of central Crete. The lamps of the Mirabello sites exhibit a much greater diver- sity of shape and size of both the lamp itself and the oil reservoir, including multiple reservoirs and wick cuttings. An analysis of the findspots of stone lamps from these three sites, together with the contextual material, suggests that multiplicity of shapes and sizes was a response to the functions of the lamps as both utilitarian objects (artificial lighting devices) and social artifacts (prestige goods and, in some cases, ritual objects). This lack of standardization, as compared to the stone lamps of palatial centers, should probably be seen as the result of both economic factors and a less rigid codification of social and religious practices. DIFFERENTIATION OF COMPLEX STRUCTURES IN MINOAN CRETE: Carol R. Hershenson, Miami University Large multiroom structures with spaces arranged in groups were common during all periods in Minoan Crete. Some of these complexes were composed of several autono- mous household units sharing party walls, with each room- group duplicating the same subsistence functions, while other complexes consisted of a single large building di- vided into several blocks of rooms, with each room-group having been used for different activities. These two types of large complexes, distinguished by the distributions of their finds when those are known, were of quite different social status; the multi-household structures were a com- mon form of Minoan vernacular architecture from the Late</page><page sequence="40">1995] THE 96TH ANNUAL MEETING 335 Neolithic period through at least the destructions of Neo- palatial Crete, whereas the functional block arrangement within a complex is typical of the palaces and Neopalatial "villas." This paper seeks to distinguish complex structures of these two types by different patterns of access and arrange- ment. In multi-household complexes, it was generally nec- essary to traverse exterior space in order to pass from one room-group to another. Moreover, the largest room within a household in a multi-unit structure, exhibiting evidence for the largest number of functions, was not generally placed against any of the party walls; these large, important "liv- ing rooms" were buffered from neighboring units by store- rooms or other small spaces of specialized function. The relationships between these two types of multiroom complexes have important implications for the architec- tural origins of the palaces; the arrangements of rooms in the palaces were clearly related to existing Minoan vil- lage organization. ACHILLES IN ANATOLIA: THE INSCRIBED "MYCENAEAN" SWORD AT HATTUAS AND ITS POSSIBLE IMPLICA- TIONS: Eric H. Cline, Xavier University An inscribed bronze sword was discovered in 1991 in the vicinity of Hattusas, capital city of the Hittites. The inscription states that the sword was dedicated at Hattusas by Tudhaliya II following his successful quelling of the ASSuwa rebellion in northwest Anatolia ca. 1430 B.C. (Unal et al., MUZE 4 [1991] 46-52). This is not a typical Hittite sword. It has no ready local parallels in Anatolia, or in- deed anywhere in the eastern Mediterranean. In fact, it was at first thought that the sword reflects Aegean inspi- ration, if not actual manufacture, for the best, although not identical, parallels are Aegean Type B swords, dating probably to the LH II period. The discussion is still on- going and is not yet resolved (cf. Mellink, AJA 97 [1993] 106, 112-13; Ertekin and Ediz, in Studies in Honor of Nimet Ozgii( [1993] 719-25). Since at least the time of Homer, and possibly back into the Bronze Age itself, the Greeks have told stories about Achaean warriors fighting on Anatolian soil prior to the Trojan War. The Hittites, too, spoke of Achaeans (Ahhiya- wans) fighting in western Anatolia during the mid-second millennium B.C., particularly during the reign of Tudhaliya II ca. 1450-1420 B.C. Overall, there is a fair amount of cir- cumstantial evidence attesting to interactions among the Mycenaeans (Ahhiyawans), the A'-uwans, and the Hittites during the late 15th century B.C. Such data might be simply a series of unrelated phenomena. They may also, however, suggest that the ASuwa rebellion might be seen as the principal historical event from which came the legendary stories concerning the earlier, pre-Trojan War, military en- deavors of Achilles, Heracles, and other Achaeans on the Anatolian mainland. If this rebellion were the historical "kernel of truth" underlying such Aegean legends, then it is conceivable that a number of these stories of Mycenaean involvement in the ASluwa rebellion during the LH II period, perhaps circulating as portions of earlier epic tales, as some believe, eventually found their way into the Iliad where they were interwoven into a single grandiose tale of "The Trojan War." THE SHRINE AT KAVOUSI: ITS PLACE IN MINOAN RE- LIGIOUS TRADITION: Geraldine C. Gesell, University of Tennessee, Knoxville Minoan religious tradition, particularly in the palace periods, is quite diverse, including private, public, and state shrines and ceremonies. Briefly, the main types of shrines include peak, cave, and palace sanctuaries, and town and rural sanctuaries. Although the assemblages of cult mate- rial including representations of deities, votive gifts, and sacral equipment vary from one type to another, there are many similarities both in equipment, such as libation tables and offering bowls, and in religious symbols, such as horns of consecration, double axes, agrimia, birds, snakes, and bulls. It is important to understand how and why features from the various types of palatial period sanctuaries are brought together and adapted for use in the LM IIIB and C shrines of the goddess with upraised hands. In partic- ular, the recently excavated LM IIIC shrine at Vronda, Kavousi, has provided both traditional and unique mate- rial-figures of goddesses, snake tubes, kalathoi, and plaques as well as a number of vessels of shapes not pre- viously connected with such shrines. It is interesting that the goddess figures and their equipment have been made from a variety of different fabrics. The goddesses, snake tubes, and plaques (but not the kalathoi) come in votive sets made of the same fabric. These sets occur in three basic colors - buff, red, and a dark, mottled red and black. Minoan tradition can explain buff and red, but "black" is a new color for the goddess figure, produced with the same fabric as cooking pots, and needs a new explanation. THE DEVELOPMENT OF A DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURAL UNIT THROUGHOUT THE EARLY IRON AGE: THE NORTHWEST BUILDING ON THE KASTRO, EAST CRETE: Margaret S. Mook, Iowa State University The Northwest Building is unique among the excavated remains on the Kastro at Kavousi, and perhaps in the archaeological record for the Early Iron Age in all of Greece. Here, the development of an insular architectural unit can be traced continuously throughout the duration of the Early Iron Age, that is, from the beginning of Late Minoan IIIC into the Archaic period. In LM IIIC the Northwest Building consists of a two- room dwelling, constructed when the Kastro is first oc- cupied. During Protogeometric (a protracted phase on the Kastro) there is a notable expansion; the main room of the LM IIIC house is subdivided and additional rooms are built contiguously on the downslope terraces, so that nine rooms now form four houses. The beginning of Geo-</page><page sequence="41">336 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 99 metric witnesses a maintenance of house size and number, and in Late Geometric there is only slight expansion in the Northwest Building, primarily consisting of the doubling in size of the smallest house by the addition of a second room. By the close of LG, however, there begins a gradual reduction in the number of rooms in use, and only two houses continue to be inhabited through the Orientalizing period. This gradual contraction in habita- tion is witnessed by both the complete abandonment of some houses and the deliberate reduction in the size of others in the Northwest Building. Spatial analysis of the architectural features and arti- fact assemblages permits the identification of specific households within the Northwest Building, while the long duration of habitation and attendant phases of growth may further suggest that the families of each household were related and evolved from the first nuclear family to build in this area of the Kastro. SESSION IV C: TECHNOLOGY AND TRADE PROCUREMENT AND PRESTIGE: PATTERNS IN THE PROVENIENCE OF PREHISTORIC MEDITERRANEAN OBSIDIAN: Robert H. Tykot, Harvard University Obsidian tools and flakes found at prehistoric sites in the eastern and central Mediterranean are evidence of a complex series of activities including procurement and transport of the raw material from island sources, produc- tion and distribution of cores or finished tools, and con- sumption and eventual disposal. The chemical analysis of more than 1,000 tools from sites in Italy and France triples the provenience data available for reconstructing central Mediterranean "trade" and provides a framework for inter- preting the specific cultural context in which their acqui- sition was embedded. Furthermore, the analysis of samples from each stratigraphic level of multi-component sites such as Filiestru Cave in Sardinia and Basi in Corsica allows for temporal control from the Early Neolithic through the Early Bronze Age. While differential use of the various ob- sidian sources has been recognized in peninsular Italy, it is apparent now that distribution patterns vary both geo- graphically and chronologically, and in ways not explained by differences in accessibility or functional suitability be- tween sources. Several possible explanations are discussed, including cultural alliances, the prestige factor in long- distance exchange networks, the role of middlemen and craft specialization, and the coexistence of multiple modes of production and distribution. Finally, the social and eco- nomic role of obsidian is compared with that of ceramics and other ground or flaked stone materials, and the central Mediterranean data are contrasted with those from Greece and the eastern Mediterranean. AN ANALYSIS OF THE ARCHIMEDEAN SCREW-PUMP: John A. Seeger, Northern Arizona University According to Diodoros, Archimedes introduced the screw-pump in Egypt where it was used to irrigate fields of the Nile Delta (Diod. Sic. 1.34.2). Remains of screw-pumps have been found in Roman mines in Spain. Also, they are shown in use in a Pompeian wall painting and on Roman- Egyptian terracottas. Vitruvius gives a detailed description of the construction of the screw-pump (Vitr. De Arch. 10.6.1-4). This paper presents an analysis of the Archi- medean screw-pump based on archaeological and literary evidence. Archimedes' screw-pumps are shown as a cylinder mounted at an angle and rotated by a person treading on cleats on the surface. Inside the cylindrical case are heli- cal blades. Water trapped between the blades is raised as the pump is rotated. Factors affecting pump capacity in- clude size and speed of rotation. Pump output also de- pends on the angle at which the pump is mounted and on the number and angle of the blades. In his description of the screw-pump, Vitruvius specifies eight blades and a mounting angle of 370. Pumps from the Roman mines in Spain have from one to three blades and are mounted at smaller angles. A larger number of blades reduces the pump capacity. A greater mounting angle reduces the output. Screw-pumps used in Egypt for irrigation have two blades and are mounted at small angles. A Roman-Egyptian terracotta in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo shows a screw-pump being rotated by two persons, indicating a large pump. Another terracotta shows a mount- ing angle approaching that specified by Vitruvius. ANOMALIES IN FLOW AND DISCHARGE AT THE POMPEII CASTELLUM: A. Trevor Hodge, Carleton University Hydraulic interpretation of the Porta Vesuvii castellum at Pompeii is as complicated as the physical layout inside it. Not knowing velocity of flow, only the cross-sectional area of the channels, we cannot calculate discharge; but that area (i.e., quinaria-count) still gives a basis for relative comparison, and three elements invite it. One is the supply aqueduct. The second is the three large delivery pipes leav- ing the castellum. The third is the total discharge for all private houses and fountains in the city. Aqueduct supply and city discharge are of the same order of magnitude, but the capacity of the three delivery pipes is excessive and they are unlikely to have run full. Inside the castellum is a further anomaly. Supposedly the water volume is divided by three "Vitruvian" weirs of different heights. The lowest one, supplying the public foun- tains, is so low in most reconstructions, and the pipe supplied so large, that it alone would consume nearly all the water, and the water level in the castellum would never rise high enough to serve the other two offtake pipes; the "private-house" network, in particular, would be left per- manently dry. There is no archaeological evidence that the three weirs were of differing heights. Paribeni, the excavator, found traces only of their existence, not their size, and the resto- ration is based on the confused specification offered in Vitruvius. I suggest here that it be rejected. A CLASSIFICATION OF ANCIENT LIGHTHOUSES: Robert L. Vann, University of Maryland</page><page sequence="42">1995] THE 96TH ANNUAL MEETING 337 Ancient lighthouses are generally compared to the Pharos in Alexandria and it has often been stated that the Egyptian example was the first of that type in antiquity. But lights or targets on shore had been necessary as long as sailors had been on the water. Before and after the third- century B.C. tower of Sostratus, there had been a variety of other targets and lights. The purpose of this paper is to propose a preliminary classification of ancient light- houses. The first signals were probably open fires on the beach or a nearby hillside. Later fires for sailors at sea were most likely integrated into extensive systems of signal towers known from the Greek world and its periphery. Recently published examples from Thasos demonstrate a series of towers on promontories leading toward the island's prin- cipal harbor. The final light in this series was probably the one best represented by archaeological evidence, the lighthouse at the entrance to the harbor basin. Examples of structures at the ends of breakwaters at Samos and Delos are usually interpreted as this type. Many of these lights were probably set on towers of the city wall circuit, which included and protected the harbor basin. In a case like Knidos it is likely that entrance into the small closed harbor might have been aided by a light on one of two towers that flanked its entrance. Greek lights were not always set on tall towers but often depended upon their siting on hill- tops overlooking the harbors. Roman builders continued both traditions; towers at Dover, Boulougne, and La Corufia are set high above their ports, while Ostia and Lepcis Magna repeat the Alexandrian model of constructing a tall tower to compensate for flat shorelines. WRECKING CHRONOLOGIES: THE PORTICELLO SHIP- WRECK AND MENDEAN AMPHORAS: Mark L. Lawall, University of Michigan Despite extensive scholarly attention, the Porticello ship- wreck continues to pose chronological problems for archae- ologists interested in sculpture, black-glaze pottery, and transport amphoras. The final report, coauthored by C.J. Eiseman and B.S. Ridgway (The Porticello Shipwreck, 1987), placed the date of the shipwreck between 410 and 385 B.C., despite the earlier date of 440-430 B.C. for the bronzes. D.W.J. Gill (IJNA 16 [1987] 31-33) proposed to date the wreck - "in the early years of the Peloponnesian War" - by the wreck's two black-glaze bolsals. A. Parker (BAR-IS 580 [1992] 333-34) suggests that the wreck could date to 425-415 B.C. The heavily looted cargo included 11 nearly complete Mendean amphoras. Mendean amphoras are known from a wide range of archaeological contexts on land. Although a closely related type existed in the second quarter and middle years of the fifth century, amphoras that match the Mendean type in form and fabric only appear in the second half of the fifth century and later. In tracing the Mendean development from ca. 440 B.C. into the fourth century one must conclude that the Porticello shipwreck's Mendean amphoras cannot date before 400 B.C. Such a conclusion has important methodological rami- fications. Although the chronology of fineware pottery is often better understood than the chronologies of trans- port amphoras, dates for shipwrecks and other commer- cial contexts are best established by the remains of bulk cargoes. Possible discrepancies between dates drawn from fineware, coarseware, and other artifacts stand as evidence for the practices and motivations of ancient commerce. SESSION IV D: ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE BALKANS AND THE BLACK SEA REGION EXCAVATIONS AT THE KONISPOL CAVE, ALBANIA, 1994: Karl M. Petruso, Brooks B. Ellwood, and Francis B. Harrold, University of Texas at Arlington The third season of excavation and related activities by the University of Texas at Arlington in collaboration with the Instituti Arkeologjik in Tiranie was carried out during the summer of 1994. Work focused again on a large cave above the town of Konispol at the southern tip of Albania, opposite the island of Corfu. The cave has revealed a clearly stratified sequence of occupation from Upper Palaeolithic through Neolithic, with sporadic use in the Bronze and Iron Ages. Efforts in 1994 concentrated on 1) isolating the transition to the Neolithic; 2) clarifying the ceramic sequence and nature of occupation in the upper- most levels; and 3) collecting archaeomagnetic samples, for comparison with the radiocarbon sequence established thus far (Antiquity 68 [1994] 335-39). Excavations in 1994 yielded more stratified geometric microliths, augmenting the sample recovered in the pre- vious season; a Mesolithic component at the site is now clearly documented. Analysis of the faunal remains from the 1992 and 1993 excavations continued. A typical Neo- lithic sheep-goat kill-off pattern has emerged, heavily weighted toward very young animals (predominantly males) throughout the sequence. Botanical remains identified from the earliest Neolithic levels include emmer wheat and vetch, which accord well with contemporary crop assemblages attested elsewhere in the Neolithic eastern Mediterranean. Juniper and other species (attested in wood charcoal) sug- gest somewhat drier conditions locally before the Neolithic. In the central part of the cave, where the floor level is highest, a new trench was sunk to a depth of ca. 1.60 m. A stratified sequence of pottery within and around hearths was recovered, dating to the Bronze Age, Iron Age, and Hellenistic periods. In the final days of the excavation season, a second cave, downslope from the Konispol Cave, was opened and ex- plored. This cavity, only slightly smaller than the excava- tion site, seems not to have been utilized in antiquity. It was likely connected with our site, however, and suggests that the Saraqint Ridge contains a larger and more exten- sive cave system. TRANSCAUCASIAN SILVERWORK: NEW FINDS AND OLD PROBLEMS: Karen S. Rubinson, University Museum, University of Pennsylvania In 1987, a burial excavated at the site of Karashamb in Armenia yielded a footed silver goblet decorated with bands of figural ornament. In form and style, the Karashamb</page><page sequence="43">338 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 99 goblet recalls that excavated by Kuftin from the site of Trialeti in Georgia. The excavator of the burial at Karashamb, V.E. Oganesian, dates the tomb to the "very beginning" of the second millennium B.C. and ties the imagery on the goblet to Indo-European myth. I have pre- viously dated the Trialeti goblet to approximately 1850- 1700 B.C. A reexamination of the art historical and archaeolog- ical parallels that yielded the originally suggested date for the Trialeti goblet, further excavation in Transcaucasia, and recent research by Christine Lilyquist on granulation sug- gest that the two goblets were probably made, and most certainly buried, in the period 1850-1700 B.C. The ques- tion of the ethnic/cultural context reflected in the imagery on the goblets cannot be answered with certainty, since thematic and stylistic parallels exist between the Karashamb goblet and both Anatolian seals and metalwork and the Hasanlu gold bowl. The possibility exists that the imagery reflects a Hurrian milieu. THE STRUMA VALLEY PROJECT, 1993-1994: LATE BRONZE AGE INVESTIGATIONS IN SOUTHWEST BUL- GARIA: Mark Stefanovich, American University in Bulgaria, and H. Arthur Bankoff, Brooklyn College Results of the 1993 and 1994 excavation seasons at Kamenska Chuka, a Late Bronze Age settlement in the Struma River valley near Blagoevgrad, southwest Bulgaria, are presented. Ajoint Bulgarian/American project has un- covered the remains of a large fortified structure on an imposing hilltop location overlooking this important riverine route between the Aegean and Central Europe. To date, analogous sites are unknown in the prehistoric Balkans. The multistory structure, destroyed by fire in the late second millennium B.C., is characterized by massive rubble-filled walls and large stone architecture. The ceramic assemblage closely resembles that known not only from LBA sites in Greek Macedonia, but also from contempo- raneous sites in Serbia, formerly Yugoslav Macedonia, and Albania. EXCAVATIONS AT OLBIA, A GREEK COLONY ON THE NORTHERN COAST OF THE BLACK SEA: Yvonne Dixon, Trinity College Olbia (southern Ukraine) is an important site on the fringes of the Hellenic world, which in the past has been difficult for Western researchers to study at first hand. Founded by Milesian colonists in the sixth century B.C., Olbia was the largest and richest of the Greek cities on the northern coast of the Black Sea. Well positioned on the estuary of the Bug River, Olbia profited from a sym- biotic trading relationship with the Scythians of the steppes to its north and east. Invaded by Sarmatians in the third century B.C. and periodically by other nomadic tribes, Olbia eventually declined irreversibly during the Roman period. Systematic excavations at Olbia have been going on since the early part of this century, and they continue at present under the auspices of the Institute of Archaeology, Kiev. While resident in Ukraine during 1993, I joined the exca- vation and extensively photographed the site. My report provides an update on current excavations in the west temenos and the southeast part of the Upper Town. I also present a historical overview of Olbia and a survey of its topography and monuments. A REEXAMINATION OF THE OLBIAN "CALENDAR INSCRIPTION": Lada Onyshkevych, University of Pennsylvania The "Calendar Inscription" is one of a handful of multiple-line graffiti from the northern Black Sea colony of Olbia. Published in Russian in 1980, this mid-fifth cen- tury B.C. graffito merits reexamination and comparison with the wider body of relevant material available to West- ern scholarship. Its significance is apparent in connection to questions of the local calendar and cults, local dialect and letter forms, and also contacts with Greece and Asia Minor. Found in the Olbian temenos area, this informal inscrip- tion appears on a fragment of an Attic black-glaze skyphos, which is dated to the second quarter of the fifth century B.C. The text on this fragment is notable primarily for its almost unparalleled list of the 12 months of the Olbian year. This list demonstrates a strong derivative connection with the calendar of the mother city, Miletos, and includes the names of three months previously unattested in the region (Taoreon, Poseidion [sic], and Artemision). The graffito also describes a dedication to Apollo, whose name is accompanied by a unique combination of epithets (Thargelios, Lykaios, Delphinios, and latros), some of them previously unattested for this area. While Apollo is known to be a principal deity in Olbia, this text illustrates the extent of his influence and the variety of cults associated with him in the region. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS-CHERSONESOS MUSEUM Ex- CAVATIONS ON THE HERAKLEA PENINSULA, CRIMEA, 1994:Joseph Coleman Carter, University of Texas at Austin, and Galina Nikolaenko, Archaeologi- cal Museum of Chersonesos In June 1994 the University of Texas participated in a joint project with the Archaeological Museum of Cherso- nesos in the chora of the colony of Chersonesos. This in- cluded excavation of a farmsiteite te 151) on the Heraklea peninsula, and a study of over 100 approximately contem- porary stelae and architectural elements of grave monu- ments from the necropolis, which are remarkable for their well-preserved polychrome decoration. A mound located at the west end of a plot of ca. 26 ha (the standard size for the division of the Heraklea penin- sula) was quickly revealed to be a square structure with a surface area of 400 m2. After four weeks the major areas of the plan are clear, the probable building periods have been defined, and sounding to bedrock has revealed major phases of the site. Many problems remain, however, espe-</page><page sequence="44">1995] THE 96TH ANNUAL MEETING 339 cially regarding the absolute chronology of the phases of construction. The one firm date-for a floor surface -is provided by a coin precisely datable to 210-200 B.C. The central feature of the plan is a square tower measuring 8.5 m on a side. This was subsequently reinforced on its south side, where the entrance is located, by a curving ("anti battering-ram") buttress. Symmetrically arranged perimeter walls complete the plan. Analogous structures have been excavated in the further territory of Chersonesos on the Tarkankout penin- sula. Their function seems to have been principally defen- sive, which is one possibility for site 151. SESSION IV E: GREEK ARCHAEOLOGY AND ARCHITECTURE THE PRAISOS SURVEY: A REPORT ON THE 1992, 1993, AND 1994 SEASONs:James Whitley, University of Wales, Cardiff Praisos is a site known from ancient sources (Hdt. 7.170- 71; Strab. 10.4.6-12) as the city of the Eteocretans, one of the five peoples of ancient Crete (Od. 19.172-77). It was investigated at around the turn of the century first by E Halbherr for the AIA (AJA 5 [1901] 371-92) and then by R.C. Bosanquet for the British School in Athens (BSA 8 [1901-1992] 231-70). Since 1992 a team from Cardiff has been engaged in survey work in and around Praisos. In 1992 the site itself was planned using an EDM, and ele- vations drawn of walls and rock-cut features. Most archi- tectural remains appear to be of Late Classical or Hellenistic date, though some walls appear to be Minoan. This was followed up in 1993 by a season of fieldwalking in the en- virons of the site, covering an area of ca. 9 km2. Sites of all periods from the Middle Minoan onward were en- countered. A discovery of particular interest was the LM IIIC-PG "refuge city" above Kalamafki, which, when ex- plored, proved to be much more extensive than had pre- viously been supposed. A report is also given of work in the 1994 season. More fieldwalking was undertaken in the region; the city of Praisos itself was studied using techniques employed in the Nemea survey (S.E. Alcock, Hesperia 60 [1991] 421-63), using the 1992 plan as a base; and the refuge city above Kalamafki was planned using an EDM. THE ERIDANOS AND THE AGORA: AlbertJ. Ammerman, Colgate University At the northwest corner of the Agora was one of the nodes in the topography of ancient Athens. This was a place where several roads met and where buildings such as the Royal Stoa and the Painted Stoa and monuments such as the crossroads enclosure and the Altar of Aphrodite faced on the Panathenaic Way. There is now good evidence that it was also an area where the landscape was once quite different. Originally, the Eridanos valley ran through this place. In the literature, we find that previous studies do not offer a clear picture of the natural setting here. Part of the reason for this has to do with the high level of the modern water table, which makes it difficult for excavations to reach the bedrock in this area. This report presents the results of fieldwork done over the last four years (1991-1994) with the aim of mapping the natural relief of this part of the Agora. On the basis of a series of hand borings made down to the bedrock, it is now possible to reconstruct the size and shape of the original Eridanos valley here. The report closes with a brief discussion of the program of works that led to the transformation of this part of ancient Athens by the fifth century B.C. By filling in the valley and placing the Eridanos underground in an artificial chan- nel, the Panathenaic Way could now pass through this place as a level road. At the same time, making good use of the newly available space along the sides of the road, part of the Royal Stoa (its northern end) and part of the Altar of Aphrodite (its south side) were, in turn, built over the valley fills. LOST AND FOUND: THE REMAINS OF THE ATHENIAN LONG WALLS: David H. Conwell, Academy of Fine Arts, Stuttgart During Classical and early Hellenistic times, three great structures known as the Long Walls joined Athens with her ports at Phaleron and Piraeus. Textual and epigraphic evidence demonstrates that major phases of construction occurred ca. 460-431, during the later 390s, and after 337, with a final phase of repair in 307-304. The Long Walls' remains were seen by many early travelers, subsequently covered by modern Athens and Piraeus, and finally redis- covered in recent decades during rescue excavations. The abundant new archaeological evidence was a well-kept secret until recent fieldwork fully documented the extant remains. Three different types of construction exist. There are a few instances of in-filled structures faced by either trapezoidal-polygonal masonry or hammer-dressed blocks. A larger group of remains consists of solid-block struc- tures, in which wall faces and core alike are composed of ashlar blocks. The masonry style of the hammer-dressed structures dates those remains to the 390s. The construc- tions built of blocks throughout should date to the 330s, when the relatively rare solid-block technique was popu- lar in Athens and Attica. By process of elimination, the trapezoidal-polygonal Long Walls can be assigned to phase 1, begun ca. 460. Nothing survives of the final repairs exe- cuted late in the fourth century. THE TEMPLE OF ATHENA AT SOUNION: A REEXAMI- NATION: Thomas A. Reinhart, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill In 1898, B. Stais uncovered the remains of an Ionic temple located inland on the isthmus at Cape Sounion. He identified it as the Temple of Athena Sounias mentioned in Pausanias 1.1.1. The building had a perplexing L-shaped colonnade that wrapped around the southeast corner of the cella. Stais restored the structure with a door in the cella east wall and with a gabled roof running east-west</page><page sequence="45">340 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 99 along the long axis. H. Thompson and W. Dinsmoor, Jr., restudied the building and their work follows Stais's resto- ration with minor alteration. This paper takes another look at the evidence and offers an alternative restoration. Vitruvius (4.8.4) describes an unusual class of temples and he lists the Temple of Athena Sounias and several other Greek and Roman structures as examples. He categorizes the group as having everything that is normally found on the front, transferred to the side. The unusual colonnade was thought to manifest this characteristic in the Sounion structure. This paper examines the other known buildings in the group, including the Erechtheion and the recently dis- covered plan of the Temple of the Dioscouri in Rome. These buildings are of the transverse cella type having a gabled porch extending off a long side. This design creates a third pediment in the buildings and allows ingress through a doorway in a long cella wall. The unique arrangement of the Sounion portico may also indicate such a gabeled en- trance on the south side. Reexamination of the remains in this light reveals evidence of a careful plan that em- phasizes the south, long side of the building. THE 1994 EXCAVATIONS AT THE TEMPLE OF ATHENA ALEA AT TEGEA: Mary E. Voyatzis, University of Arizona, Erik Ostby, Norwegian Institute in Athens, and GullogNordquist, Uppsala University The last of five seasons of excavations was completed in the summer of 1994 at the Sanctuary of Athena Alea at Tegea. This international program, directed by Erik 0stby, was carried out under the auspices of the Norwegian In- stitute in Athens and with the cooperation of the French, Swedish, and Italian schools in Athens, the Arcadian- Laconian Ephorate, and the University of Arizona. We continued excavating inside the cella, where we further investigated the two superimposed late eighth-early seventh century cult buildings found below the Archaic foundations. We focused on clarifying certain points such as the exterior width of the buildings, the construction of the walls, the details of construction and function of the postholes, and the relation of the floors to the cross- walls in the eastern part of the later building. Trial trenches dug into the deeper strata revealed activity prior to the two LG buildings, including evidence for an earlier struc- ture, postholes, fine pottery, and votives. Inside the Classical pronaos, the LG metalworking area was further explored. We found a series of pits for making small bronze objects, probably for dedication at the sanc- tuary. Below we uncovered a layer of compact silty clay covering what appears to be a bothros connected with the sanctuary. It contained a good deal of dark sooty soil, char- coal, masses of sherds, some burned and unburned ani- mal bones, and many small finds of bronze, terracotta, and gold. The bottom has not yet been reached but the pottery includes large quantities of PG and Laconian Dark Age pottery, of 10th-9th century date. In the northern sector we began digging a seventh- century destruction layer characterized by material com- ing from a building (probably not destroyed in situ), burned terracottas, white plaster, stones, a few sherds of fine pot- tery, and a good number of votive objects. A small trial trench nearby yielded a deep layer of apparently eighth- century date. Inside, a soil core sample revealed evidence for human occupation at a depth of 2.5 m below the eighth- century layer. In the sections of the Byzantine pit discovered in the northern sector in a previous season, we observed the pres- ence of what seem to be a series of structures with east- west orientations, destroyed by flooding and always rebuilt in the same area. The earliest of these structures appears to be Geometric in date and may be some sort of peribolos or retaining wall. OBSERVATIONS ON AN OLD PROBLEM: THE "TREASURY" AT FOCE DEL SELE: Barbara A. Barletta, University of Florida, Gainesville Excavations begun in 1934 in the Sanctuary of Hera at Foce del Sele led to the discovery of a small temple orig- inally identified as a treasury (P. Zancani Montuoro and U. Zanotti-Bianco, Heraion alla Foce del Sele II, Rome 1954). It was reconstructed with a four-column prostyle porch and cella, a rosette molding as wall crown, anta- and column- capitals, and 35 metopes. From the location of the north- east column drum, assumed to be in situ, six metopes were assigned to each end and 12 to each of the long sides, for a total of 36. Further work uncovered additional triglyph- metope slabs, which forced Zancani Montuoro (AttiMGrecia 5 [1964] 57-95) to lengthen the building and reject the northeast drum as in situ, but she did not offer a specific plan. That proposed recently by E Van Keuren (The Frieze from the Hera I Temple at Foce del Sele, Rome 1989), with an extremely deep pronaos and in antis facade, is unlikely to be correct. This paper reassesses the evidence for the "Treasury" and offers a new reconstruction. It maintains the prostyle arrangement, required by the anta-capitals, but extends the depth of the pronaos and for the first time coordinates the frieze with side interaxials. Evidence from the anta- capitals is used to eliminate the wall crown and reduce the depth of the architrave. The rosette molding, too large to serve as an architrave crown as suggested by D. Mertens (Der alte Heratempel von Paestum, Rome 1993), is assigned to another structure. The anomalous door crown is also eliminated. Contemporary and/or local parallels not only provide support for such a reconstruction but also place this so-called primitive temple more in the mainstream of early Greek architecture. THE OLYMPIEION AT AGRIGENTO: NEW OBSERVATIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS: Pieter B.EJ. Broucke, Yale University When the Carthaginians invaded Akragas in 406 B.C. the Temple of Olympian Zeus had not yet received its roof, and the building remained unfinished thereafter (Diod. 13.82.1). Extant variations in surface treatment confirm the near-finished condition of the construction: the stylobate</page><page sequence="46">1995] THE 96TH ANNUAL MEETING 341 and krepidoma on the flanks retain protective panels and margins - features paralleled at other unfinished building projects-while on the front of the temple these technical articulations were removed. The enigmatic cuttings on the inner face of the stylo- bate generally have been perceived as decorative. This inter- pretation resulted in the reconstruction of the floor level inside the peristyle 0.805 m below the stylobate level. Evi- dence gathered in the course of my fieldwork at the site suggests, however, that the cuttings served technical rather than decorative purposes. They were, in fact, hidden from view by the floor, which in my reconstruction was situated only 0.135 m below stylobate level, resulting in a more canonical situation. Similarly, the articulated two lowest courses of the col- umns have been considered as decorative bases that some- how compensate for the enormous size of the building. The general nature of Greek architecture, however, sug- gests otherwise: temples receive more decoration only as scale decreases. Moreover, column bases are unparalleled in fifth-century B.C. Doric architecture. Based upon on- site examination both of the building's unfinished parts and of these so-called "bases," I argue that the lowest two courses of the columns still retain their protective panels and simply remained unfluted at the time the building project was abandoned. SESSION V A: AEGEAN PREHISTORY II PALAEOGEOGRAPHIES OF THE EMBAYED COASTS OF GREECE AND TURKEY:John C. Kraft, University of Delaware, G. Rapp, Jr., University of Minne- sota, Duluth, Ilhan Kayan, Ege University, and Richard K. Dunn, University of Delaware Our geological studies of the evolution of the coastal zones of Greece and Turkey show a coherent scheme of initial transgressive and later regressive sedimentary se- quences up to 90 m thick and 30 km inland. Both large and small graben-formed marine embayments and flanking (continental) strands include variants of floodplains/back- swamps overlain by sandy and muddy shallow marine en- vironments, ultimately overlain by prograding and aggrad- ing wave and/or sediment distributary-dominated deltas, floodplains, backswamps, lagoons (sometimes isolated and bypassed as flanking lakes), and barrier accretion plains. Quaternary tectonics and pre-Holocene rock lithologies also play an important role. From 5000 to 7000 B.P., marine sediments frequently occur buried at or within several meters below present sea level, suggesting a mid-Holocene eustatic high sea stand. We have not yet attained a true eustacy curve. Accurate identification of sedimentary en- vironmental lithosomes and their lateral and vertical re- lationships, however, when used with local relative sea-level concepts, allows for precision in palaeogeographic recon- struction. Thus, historical (cf. Thermopylae) and other archaeological sites in coastal zones now can be placed in their varied palaeogeographic settings of the past 5,000 years. Ancient cities such as Troy, Ephesos, Tiryns, Oinia- dai, Miletos, Epitalion, Pella, and many others were clearly coastal cities and seaports. THE UNIVERSITY OF MANITOBA EXCAVATIONS AT ELEUSIS: Michael B. Cosmopoulos, University of Manitoba In the summer of 1994 the Department of Classics of the University of Manitoba started new excavations at the sanctuary of Eleusis, under the auspices of the Athens Archaeological Society. The purpose of the excavations is to recover new information about the stratigraphical sequence, chronology, economy, and social organization of the site, with particular emphasis on the Bronze Age. The excavations are part of a larger research program on Bronze Age Eleusis, which will also publish the unpublished and partially published Bronze Age finds from the old ex- cavations (AJA 97 [1993] 245-46). Two trenches were opened in the southwest slope of the Eleusinian hill, immediately to the north of the area ex- cavated by George E. Mylonas in the 1930s. The stratigraphy revealed a top layer of mixed pottery (EH through mod- ern), followed by a destruction layer of the Roman period. In trench 1 this layer lay directly on a floor and included fragments of plaster, tiles, bricks, glass, and numerous sherds. In trench 2 a Hellenistic floor with a well lay under the Roman layer. Bronze Age deposits were found imme- diately underneath this floor, but only the top stratum was excavated and yielded MH matt-painted and LH pottery. The project also conducted geological and palaeo- environmental studies of the site; faunal and botanical re- mains were collected from all strata and shipped for further study to the University of Manitoba; and ceramics were sent to the NSRC Demokritos for trace element (neutron- activation) analysis. THE PYLOS REGIONAL ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROJECT PRELIMINARY REPORT ON THE 1994 SEASON: JL. Davis, University of Cincinnati, S.E. Alcock, Uni- versity of Michigan, J. Bennet, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Y. Lolos, Hellenic Institute of Marine Archaeology, Athens, C.W Shelmerdine, University of Texas at Austin, Michael E. Timpson, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and E. Zangger, University of Heidelberg The final season of fieldwork for the Pylos Regional Archaeological Project (PRAP) took place in 1994, increas- ing the total area of intensive survey to about 34 km2. Work concentrated in three locations in the northern part of our permit area. Two new sites were discovered near the coast south of the Langouvardos River valley, and two more in the rugged uplands between Gargalianoi and Lefki. One of the latter was an unusually dense concentration of lithics associated with a few small pieces of Early Bronze Age pot- tery. Six new sites came to light in the Margeli valley east of the Aigaleon mountain range, one perhaps a Roman</page><page sequence="47">342 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 99 cemetery. Other new places of interest included a 19th- century site, a group of apparently Byzantine tumuli, and a dense coastal scatter of large Palaeolithic lithics. We also defined with greater precision the spatial and chronolog- ical extent of several sites already identified by the Min- nesota Messenia Expedition. Several sites reported on in earlier years were the focus of further work and artifact analysis. The gridded collec- tion of surface artifacts around the Palace of Nestor, begun in 1993, was completed this year. Other efforts included the use of a total station electronic theodolite to plan re- mains at several sites, including a Roman bath and villa at Marathoupolis Dialiskari. Geological fieldwork in 1994 took several forms. Cores were drilled to determine if an alluvial plain at Romanou represents a silted-up basin that may have been filled with water in the Bronze Age. The stratigraphy confirms the existence of a basin, probably artificially constructed. A combination of coring with magnetometric prospection indicated the presence of a large building (at least 60 m in one dimension) at the Late Hellenistic-Early Roman site of Bouka and substantial remains of large structures west and northwest of the Palace of Nestor. These locations were also the focus of soil studies. WORLD SYSTEMS THEORY AND AEGEAN BRONZE AGE ECONOMY: P Nick Kardulias, Kenyon College Overland and sea trade routes, both local and long- distance, were regular features of Aegean Bronze Age so- cieties. In fact, sophisticated exchange systems existed in the area during the Neolithic and Mesolithic, but did not possess the requisite traits of a world system. The Bronze Age, however, was a different story. Aegean societies in the third and second millennia B.C. attained social complex- ity (ranked, stratified, and finally state status), with well- organized redistributive - and later market- economies based on the accumulation of substantial agricultural sur- pluses, craft specialization, and distribution systems with a variety of nodes. The trade items included staple foods, utilitarian objects (e.g., pottery), and luxury goods. To place these activities in a proper context, this paper initially evalu- ates the world systems literature as it relates to antiquity. The paper then presents some specific evidence to support the contention that the Aegean Bronze Age economy was an adjunct to an eastern Mediterranean world system. While Wallerstein's model offers valuable insights into the opera- tion of trade networks, his approach has certain limitations. The report explores some of these limitations, in particu- lar the absence of periphery dependence on core areas that is a hallmark of modern capitalist systems, discusses re- visions suggested by other scholars, and demonstrates the validity of the altered model with data from the Aegean. Finally, the paper also suggests that the world systems ap- proach needs to place greater emphasis on production, not just exchange, as the crucial nexus of economic activity. THE EARLIEST MYCENAEAN ADMINISTRATION ON THE MAINLAND? Paul Rehak, Loyola University, Chi- cago, and John G. Younger, Duke University Three main phases in the development of Mycenaean administration on the mainland have been documented or postulated. The LH I shaft graves represent a proto- administrative use of seals primarily as non-sphragistic em- blems of status, and a limited awareness of Linear A. By LH/LM II-IIIA:1, however, Linear B had developed (an early archive in the Room of the Chariot Tablets, Knossos). But most of the mainland evidence for administration with tablets and sealings belongs to the LH IIIB:I and 2 periods. This paper examines the possible evidence for the first Mycenaean administration in LH I-II when seals were used as tokens of authority, before the creation of Linear B. At least six early Mycenaean burials included large col- lections of seals: a cist in the Vapheio tholos; two individ- uals in Routsi tholos 2; the Kazarma tholos; Gouvalari tholos 1; grave 2 in the Tragana tholos; and Mycenae chamber tomb 518. The Vapheio "prince" owned the largest hoard of 29 gems, but there are also links with and among the seals found on the chamber floor. The seals from each of these burials tend to fall into discrete pairs linked by similarities in shape (lentoids, amygdaloids, cylinders, prisms), material and iconography, and workshop or stylistic group of origin. We postulate that these paired seals served as tokens in a simple ad- ministrative system with little or no writing. Individual lieu- tenants may have been entrusted with one of each pair of seals, while the owner would retain the other. The number of pairs of seals may be an index of the relative power of individual owners, with the Vapheio prince able to dispatch many lieutenants at one time. After the end of LH II-IIIA, with the full development of Linear B, mainland graves seldom include large collections of seals, indicating that this simple system of seals as administra- tive tokens may have fallen into abeyance. A FRESH LOOK AT MYCENAEAN FOOD: Ruth Palmer, Vassar College The most frequently recorded foods in the Linear B tablets are grains, dried figs, wine, and olive oil, all of which, once processed, keep well in storage for several years. Spe- cialized tablets record herbs and spices, which also have a long storage life. Domestic animals appear as livestock to be slaughtered, and the only securely identified animal food product listed is cheese. Fresh fruits and vegetables have not been identified in the Linear B tablets. Seasonal foods have always played an important role in diet, so it is surprising that the Myce- naean texts do not list them. There are several possible reasons for this. Soft fruits and vegetables do not travel well for long distances, and have a short storage life. In the ancient world, fresh produce was brought to centers only from farms very nearby, so the palaces might not have tithed outlying farms for such perishable goods. Orchards and gardens belonging to the Mycenaean wanax or nobles (cf. PY Er 880) located close to the palace centers may have provided fresh fruits and greens at banquets. Or in the months when the tablets were written, no fresh fruits were available. The Linear B texts deal with foods with a long storage life, which could be collected over long distances and stock-</page><page sequence="48">1995] THE 96TH ANNUAL MEETING 343 piled until needed. PY Un 718 records such foods collected for a festival. Perishable foods by their very nature do not fit into these kingdom-wide redistribution schemes, but must have been collected and consumed on a local level. A BULL-LEAPING SCENE IN A FRESCO FROM MYCENAE: A NEW RECONSTRUCTION: Maria C. Shaw, Univer- sity of Toronto This paper proposes a reconstruction of a bull-leaping scene that for the first time pulls together information from painted plaster fragments found beneath the Ramp House at Mycenae in Schliemann's excavations (in 1876) and those by British archaeologists under the direction of A. Wace around 1920. The paper discusses the theme of bull-leaping in Aegean fresco and the conventional iconography associated with it. Comparisons are mostly with frescoes from the Palace of Knossos, but also with Minoan or Minoanizing bull- leaping murals recently found by M. Bietak in the eastern Delta in Egypt. The possible locale for such games and the question of whether they were held on the Mycenaean main- land as well as on Crete are among the issues examined. HOMERIC AND NEAR EASTERN BRONZE AGE CHARI- OTRY: Ralph E Gallucci, University of Central Arkansas That Homer knew nothing about chariots and their proper function in the Bronze Age is a common assertion among scholars. According to Finley, Kirk, Carpenter, Greenhalgh, Delebecque, and others, Homer's heroes used their chariots as a means of transport to the battle and then dismounted to fight; Near Eastern and Egyptian chariots, on the other hand, were used as a mobile artil- lery unit in which the spearman or archer did not leave his chariot to fight on foot. This paper examines pictorial and documentary evi- dence for Near Eastern and Homeric chariot tactics, argu- ing that 1) the chariot tactics assumed by Finley and others to be standard practice in the Bronze Age were used pri- marily by the Egyptians; 2) Hittite and Assyrian chariots were used to attack and scatter the enemy's infantry and to run down fleeing soldiers, but the spearmen dismounted to fight; and 3) Homeric chariotry parallels chariot usage in the Bronze Age Near East and is most likely a remem- brance of Mycenaean practices. SESSION V B: ANATOLIA RECONSIDERING SOME ARCHITECTURAL RELIEF SCULPTURE FROM KARKAMISH: Ash Ozyar, Bospho- rus University Karkamish is the most prolific source of architectural relief sculpture for the upper Euphrates region. Earlier research has focused mainly on stylistic criteria for chrono- logical purposes. The present reevaluation of the sculp- tured orthostats has been based on technological, struc- tural, and iconographic aspects. One of the key factors in establishing groups of relief that belong together has been to determine if relief blocks have been reused. It is a circumstance encountered more often than expected, probably because cut stone blocks, with or without relief, already available on any site were too precious to simply discard. If secondary use of mate- rial is overlooked, both the iconographic and architectural context of the reliefs remain blurred and prevent us from a proper evaluation and interpretation. This paper discusses a selection of sculptured material - fragments and complete blocks- from various parts of the site: the Water Gate blocks, orthostats from the Heralds Wall and from the Processional Entry, as well as several sculptured fragments without an architectural context from the foundation of the Hilani. The investigations have re- vealed that some pieces can be dated to the second mil- lennium and feature Hittite or Mitannian influence. Also noted are the affinities of some Karkamish pieces to sculp- tured blocks at 'Ain Dara. THE LATE BRONZE AGE IN THE TROAD: NEW INFOR- MATION FROM THE BESIK TEPE CEMETERY: Maureen Anne Basedow, Tiibingen University Located on the Aegean coast some 15 km southwest of Troy, the Late Bronze Age Begik Tepe cemetery represents the only extensive funerary remains known from the Troad. The lack of known burials, together with the limited ex- tent of excavated LBA settlement remains, had previously reduced any discussion about the internal and external sociopolitical relationships of the LBA population to speculation. The 60 Begik Tepe graves, nearly all of which date to the LH IIIA:2 period (Late Troy VI), allow us to expand upon what was a very limited picture. The variety of grave types and burial customs represented is unparalleled. This speaks for a remarkably diverse burial population. The finds from the graves suggest that this diversity is chiefly socioeconomic. The elite graves contain finds that point to participation in gift exchange relationships, if not out- right long-distance trade in luxury goods. Proportions of Mycenaean and imitation Mycenaean pottery are consid- erably higher in the cemetery than in deposits excavated on the Troy citadel, which may indicate a stronger Myce- naean influence than previously considered. The ceme- tery area was located along a colluvial slope 15 m from the sea. A low wall was built near the base of the slope to retain a fill offine, white sand, which covered the graves. Although never a tumulus--the effect being more com- parable to terracing- the construction probably gave the cemetery something of a monumental character. NEW WORK ON THE ARCHITECTURAL TERRACOTTAS FROM GORDION: Matthew R. Glendinning, Univer- sity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill A rich corpus of architectural terracottas was recovered from Gordion during the Kirte excavations in 1900 and</page><page sequence="49">344 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 99 those of Young from 1950 to 1974. A selection of the tiles has been published, but no agreement reached regarding their date. Akerstr6m's chronology has since been adjusted upward at several sites, e.g., Sardis and Samos. Based on restudy of the Gordion material this paper reports on simi- lar revisions in date as well as typology. Stratigraphic evidence, in the form of the destruction level on the Kiifik Hilyiik, is presented for tiles dating to the first half of the sixth century B.C. Several figural types are discussed and dated to the earlier sixth century on the basis of style and iconography. A diverse group of tiles, previously dated to the later fifth century, is also iden- tified as two roofs dating to the late sixth century. These finds corroborate the early sixth-century date proposed for the rebuilding of Gordion after the Cimmerian destruc- tion (K. DeVries, AJA 94 [1990] 371-406). They provide a rare glimpse of building activity during the Persian period, and they show close similarities to tiles at Sardis and else- where, thereby clarifying our understanding of Gordion's contacts with her Anatolian neighbors in the Archaic period. GREEK AND ROMAN EXCAVATIONS AT TROY, 1993- 1994: C. Brian Rose, University of Cincinnati The primary focus of excavation during the 1993 and 1994 seasons was the sanctuary on the southwest side of the mound. There was a rather extensive building program here in the second century B.C., and this lends support to Strabo's description of a revival in Ilion after the Peace at Apamea. It is now clear that the North Building was destroyed in the Fimbrian attack of 85 B.C., and that it was left as a ruin during the subsequent Augustan resto- ration of the sanctuary. The building was apparently in- tended to stand as a symbol of the wars that had nearly destroyed life in the city. In front of the North Building we discovered the foun- dations for another mid-second century B.C. building that must have been one of the largest Hellenistic structures at Troy. The foundations measure at least 20 m in length and 10 m in width, and it would have dwarfed every other building in the sanctuary. The southwest side of the mound was clearly an area of extraordinary importance through- out Troy VIII. Under the porch of the North Building we found evi- dence for two well-built stone buildings of Archaic date. An in situ column base in one of the buildings probably belongs to a large Aeolic capital found just to the south. We may have uncovered evidence for an Archaic temple here, although further excavation will be necessary to confirm it. The trenches did not yield large amounts of Protogeometric pottery, but there is enough to show that there was still a settlement here at the beginning of the first millennium. Excavation behind the skene of Theater C revealed a building collapse that included a cuirassed statue of the emperor Hadrian. The theater was built probably during the Augustan period, renovated under Hadrian, and re- paired in the early fourth century. In the Lower City, two Late Roman houses decorated with wall paintings and geo- metric mosaics were partially uncovered. One of the most important finds was a building dedication to Claudius, probably set up by King Mithridates VIII of Bosporos. EXCAVATIONS AT THE SANCTUARY OF ZEUS OLBIOS: Yasemin Scarborough, University of Wisconsin- Madison Under the auspices of the Turkish Ministry of Culture and the Silifke Museum, excavation and research continued at the Sanctuary of Zeus Olbios in Cilicia Tracheia in 1994. The sanctuary, located at Diocaesarea (Turkish Uzunca- burc), is one of the few, untouched Hellenistic and Roman sites displaying significant remains in Turkey. Strabo (14.5.10) says the Temple of Zeus was founded by Ajax, son of Teucer; the priest-kings were named Teucer or Ajax, confirmed by epigraphic evidence. The visible remains at the sanctuary, together with the evidence of coins and in- scriptions, show that the place flourished in the Imperial period. Excavations began in 1993 at the theater, dedicated to Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus. In 1994 work con- tinued at the theater; we uncovered the cavea as well as the orchestra and stage that were buried underneath de- bris. Excavations also focused on the Corinthian Temple of Zeus Olbios, the most prominent ruin at the site. The temple, remarkably well preserved, stands in a rectangu- lar temenos, whose west end was enclosed by the stoa dedi- cated by Seleukos Nikator. The temple suffered great dam- age in the fifth century A.D. when it was converted into a basilica. We unearthed the krepidoma of the original struc- ture and continued the inventory of the architectural pieces in the temenos. Our research will help determine the ex- tent and nature of the cult and settlement at the sanctuary and should eventually produce a clearer picture of the site's history in the Hellenistic and Roman periods. THE CITY IN THE SAND DUNES: A SURVEY OF A ROMAN PORT CITY IN CILICIA: Jennifer Tobin, Bilkent University In 1991 during a survey of the Hatay region of southern Turkey conducted by a team from Bilkent University, a site was catalogued along the Kucuk Burnaz stream. The site was a harbor town, located at the northernmost point of the Bay of Iskenderun, but today the ancient harbor has silted up and the site is covered in sand dunes. Until re- cently the site had been completely obscured by these dunes, but in 1987 mining for sand by a local company uncovered a series of large Roman and Byzantine build- ings that had been preserved in good condition by the mantle of sand. The ancient identity of the settlement is not yet known, but it probably can be associated with the reorganization of Cilicia by Pompeius Magnus following his successful campaign against the pirates in 67 B.C. In our two-week season (1-14 August) we conducted a survey of the site, collecting pottery, glass, coins, marble revet- ment fragments, and painted plaster. Although the pottery awaits detailed analysis, preliminary study indicates it dates from the first century B.C. through the 13th century A.D. Traces of at least 19 buildings were drawn and planned,</page><page sequence="50">1995] THE 96TH ANNUAL MEETING 345 demonstrating the grid plan of the settlement. Buildings include two monumental arches and several structures con- cerned with water storage. These last may well give a clue as to the purpose of this site. Located on the Bay of Iskenderun and along a major Roman road, the settle- ment may well have served as a watering station both for sea and land traffic. The size of the settlement, however, as well as the degree of luxury indicated by the frescoes (adhering both to the interior and exterior of several struc- tures) would indicate that this was not merely a service installation, but a settlement in its own right. ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH AT APHRODISIAS IN CARIA, 1993-1994: Christopher Ratte and R.R.R. Smith, New York University In 1993 New York University initiated a new program of field research at Aphrodisias. The goals of this program are to reexamine the monuments uncovered in earlier seasons, and to try to understand them better in their larger urban context. In 1993 and 1994, cleaning and excavation in the Sanctuary of Aphrodite yielded new evidence for the layout of the sanctuary, and for the date of the con- version of the temple into a Christian church (in or after the late fifth century). Examination of the area south of the sanctuary helped to clarify the connection between the sanctuary and a complex of civic buildings, including the bouleuterion, arrayed along the north edge of the agora. On the south side of the agora, the first-century basilica was reexamined, and renewed investigation of the triconch church southwest of the basilica yielded new evidence sup- porting Robin Cormack's suggestion that this church was built around a Roman Imperial tetrakionion, which orig- inally marked the intersection of two streets. Indeed, clean- ing and excavation north and east of the church have now revealed parts of both streets. Reused in the pavement of one of these streets, which ran north-south to and from the "Portico of Tiberius" (the south agora), was a slab in- scribed with a series of letters from the emperor Hadrian to Aphrodisias. In addition to field research, work continued on a pro- gram of study and documentation of the earlier finds (espe- cially the sculpture) begun in 1991. Other projects under- taken in 1993 and 1994 include the construction of a new depot and conservation workshop, the reinstallation of the Zoilos frieze in the Aphrodisias Museum, and the in- auguration of an archaeological survey of the region around Aphrodisias. SESSION V C: ROMAN ART AND ICONOG- RAPHY THE IMAGE OF THE HEROIC RIDER IN REPUBLICAN ROME: Myles McDonnell, University of Puget Sound It is a paradox that although members of Rome's belli- cose aristocracy customarily fought from horseback, rep- resentations of mounted warriors remained rare in Rome until the Late Republic. Between the first example recorded in 338 B.C. and the late second century, only five equestrian statues are attested and these honored truly exceptional achievements. In addition, Livy (8.13.9) explicitly states that in the early period such statues were rare. Numismatics tells the same story. Until 129 B.C. the only representations of mounted warriors on Roman coins were the Dioscuri. Afterward mounted warriors became common both on an- cestral reverses and in statuary; equestrian statues honor- ing Sulla, Julius Caesar, Octavian, and Lepidus, among others, are recorded. The rarity of the figure of the heroic rider reflects a Roman aristocratic aversion to the image of the mounted warrior due to its association with kingship. The associa- tion can be traced to the Archaic period through refer- ence to various institutions, e.g., the celeres (mounted body- guard of the rex), and the dictator, who was forbidden to ride a horse. Contact with Hellenistic kingship, a principal symbol of which was the heroic rider, reinforced the tra- ditional Republican aversion. A connection also existed between the heroic rider and the cult of Virtus. The Re- publican cult was patronized only by Romans who at- tempted to overcome aristocratic restrictions by empha- sizing their extraordinary martial prowess; its founder, M. Claudius Marcellus, was described by Virgil as a heroic rider: hic rem Romanam magno turbante tumultu/sistet eques, sternet Poenos Gallumque rebellem (Aen. 6.857-58). ROMAN DWARF FIGURINES AS TINTINNABULA: Michael Garmaise, McMaster University Included among the hundreds of surviving examples of Hellenistic and Roman bronzes depicting human dwarfs is a remarkable group that forms the focus of this paper. These 10 figures have not been discussed together before, and only two are well published. They are hanging figures equipped with rings for suspending bells and often lamps. I wish to place the group within the larger context of bells, or tintinnabula. In antiquity, many tintinnabula served purely practical uses, but others took on a mystical, amuletic func- tion as wards against evil forces. These dwarfs are known only from the Vesuvius area and represent a logical development from less elaborate apotropaic charms. The figures combine the efficacy of the bells with the dwarfs' own apotropaic properties: not only their atopia, but also the extreme ithyphallism, which reflects the protective value of male fertility over centuries of tradition. It is manifested as well in contemporary do- mestic statues of Priapus. With the frequent incorporation of lamps into these complicated figures, their function as sources of light takes on stronger overtones as dispellers of dark forces. The iconography of the figures is open to dispute. Those that wield weapons may merely be performing an appro- priately aggressive action, which occurs on other known depictions of composite attacks on the Evil Eye. The sig- nificance of dwarfjockeys may lie solely in the amusement and whimsicality, themselves apotropaic features, that they add to the more focused potency of the phalli and bells.</page><page sequence="51">346 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 99 ARTISTIC FORGERY IN THE EARLY ROMAN EMPIRE: Ellen Perry, University of Michigan References to a forgery scandal of significant propor- tions survive in a handful of literary sources dating to the Early Roman Empire. This scandal concerned silver cups of Roman manufacture that were fraudulently signed with the name of Mys, a silversmith of the fifth century B.C. An examination of the written and material evidence seems to indicate that these fakes were manufactured in response to fading public interest in contemporary craftsmanship and a concurrent increase in appreciation for antiques. This particular scandal can teach us a great deal not only about the taste of Roman artistic patrons in this period, but also about ancient forgery in general. The phe- nomenon of forgery was by no means confined to silver- working but was also practiced by the sculptors and painters of the day, who signed the names of acknowledged masters to their own, original works in order to increase their profit. The signature of a great Greek master on a sculpture or painting of the Roman period may thus be a cause for sus- picion: sculptural copies, as is now well known, were gen- erally inscribed with the name of the copyist. Consequently, the appearance of a Greek master's name on a work of art manufactured in the Roman period does not necessarily indicate the replication of a famous prototype. Scholars of copy criticism must, therefore, beware of the potential danger of taking artists' signatures at face value. WHO WATCHES THE WATCHMEN? THE SPECTATOR'S ROLE IN ROMAN PAINTING: Michaelf. Behen, Yale University Roman paintings showing mythological scenes frequently include figures peripheral to the main action of the nar- rative. Scholars have identified these extras as Roman fea- tures, added to Greek originals to mediate the relation- ship between the viewer and the work of art. In several instances, the depicted spectator ceases to occupy a sub- sidiary role and becomes central to the story and its de- piction. Roman artists used a variety of strategies to ex- plore the issue of spectatorship. On the most basic level is a series of myths involving a passive sleeping figure viewed by a second figure. These paintings, including the stories of Bacchus and Ariadne and Diana and Endymion, are compositionally similar, showing a collapsed figure in one corner viewed by a standing figure diagonally opposite. The central action is the act of viewing. A second group of myths presents a more active version of voyeurism. These myths focus on doomed youths- Actaeon, Pentheus, Hylas-who either are voyeurs detected and punished or themselves the object of voyeurism. These myths are often set in a watery landscape that provides an opportunity to display nudity. A further strategy, gen- erally associated with female figures such as Venus and Medusa, involves reflected images. Reflections in mirrors, shields, and pools allow artists to explore sight and de- picted images. The Narcissus myth, another myth relating the dangers of voyeurism, presents a rare case of a reflected male, sometimes amplified by placing the scene by an actual pool. On one level, the depicted myths, with their empha- sis on erotic scenes, reinforce gender roles. These central spectators, however, may also be considered in the same vein as the manipulation of fictive space in Third and Fourth Style paintings, in which Roman artists show them- selves to be not slavish copiers, but clever manipulators of artistic forms. THE SHIELD OF ROMA AETERNA: Fred C. Albertson, University of Memphis Two Late Roman poets, Claudiar, and Sidonius Apolli- naris, each describe a decorated bronze shield borne by the goddess Roma. On this shield appears a scene com- bining two events from Rome's legendary foundation: the she-wolf nursing Romulus and Remus, together with Mars encountering Rhea Silvia in the presence of Cupid and the Tiber. Both events are depicted within a landscape setting. C. Duliere (Lupa Romana [1979] 234) rightly connects these literary accounts with the shield accompanying the cult statue of Roma, which stood in the Maxentian resto- ration of the Temple of Roma Aeterna and Venus Felix on the Velian. There is strong evidence, however, that the Maxentian shield reproduced the original Hadrianic version. If one traces the evolution of the encounter of Mars and Rhea from its beginnings in the early first cen- tury B.C., the personification of the Tiber joins the group only during the Hadrianic period. A bronze medallion of Diva Faustina from A.D. 141 perhaps reproduces much of the shield's imagery: on the reverse Mars stands within a landscape viewing Rhea reclining on Tiber's lap. Cupid as well appears with Mars and Rhea Silvia for the first time during this period, as evidenced by coins, gems, silverwork, and reliefs of the Late Hadrianic and Antonine eras. Thus, in the same way that the Temple of Venus and Rome served throughout its history as a symbol of the city's past and future greatness, so too its decoration highlighted Rome's auspicious beginnings and acted as a source for later gen- erations of artists in depicting those scenes. THE MEMORIALIZATION OF THE MILITARY CLASS: ROMAN FUNERARY PORTRAITURE AND POLITICS IN THE EASTERN ROMAN PROVINCES: Virginia M. da Costa, University of California, Santa Barbara The intermingling of indigenous artistic styles with Roman portrait traditions resulted in unique sepulchral memorials for the newly recruited inhabitants of the East- ern provinces who died in the service of imperial Rome. Anatolian relief sculpture, Greek funerary stelae, and Persian and Hellenistic rock-cut tombs may have provided the initial inspiration for the art of commemoration; the Roman contribution toward portraiture and burial prac- tices themselves perpetuated the memory, achievements, and virtues of the deceased and elevated the status of"bar- barian" enlisted men to one of respect and honor. This phenomenon is most apparent in the ostentatious portrait</page><page sequence="52">1995] THE 96TH ANNUAL MEETING 347 facades of rock-cut tombs at Adamkayalar along Turkey's Mediterranean coast, at Qatura in Syria, and at Petra in Jordan, which pay homage to the memoriae of soldiers through grave monument commissions. Numerous ex- amples of military memorials on funerary stelae, altars, urns, and sarcophagi portray the likenesses of Roman soldiers as well. The Eastern provinces of Rome are especially interest- ing in providing examples of funerary portraiture (both in situ and in museum collections) with stylistic corre- spondences between East and West. Rome's military pres- ence seems to have subsumed the local traditions of sepul- chral symbolism in favor of imperial iconography and portrait depiction of the deceased, yet some element of the indigenous aesthetic was never fully eradicated. The study of funerary portrait monuments that memorialize individuals in the military class provides an interesting commentary on patronage, commemoration, and aesthetic considerations in the social hierarchy of the provincial East and the politics of Roman portraiture. SESSION V D: LATER IRON AGE AND ROMAN ITALY MATER MATUTA IN COMPANY: A REDISCOVERED SANCTUARY AT ANCIENT SATRICUM: Birgitte Ginge, Gettysburg College The ancient site of Satricum, ca. 40 miles south of Rome, was first excavated in 1896-1898 and again in 1907-1910. The focus of the 19th-century excavations was the Mater Matuta temple, known through authors such as Livy, and the spectacular remains of architecture and sculpture underscored the ancient fame of the Mater Matuta cult at Satricum. Preliminary reports were published and the material was displayed in the Villa Giulia Museum. The results from the second campaign were never published and the artifacts remained in storage for more than 70 years. A recent project to recover these finds and retrieve the information that they hold has resulted in new insights into various aspects of the site, including the rediscovery of a sanctuary to an unidentified deity. I have studied the finds and records from the 1907-1910 excavations at Satricum and demonstrated that, in addi- tion to remains from the Iron Age settlement and necrop- olis, the excavators uncovered the foundations of a small temple in the southwest corner of the site. According to the field record, this structure had the characteristic form of an Italic temple. Since no trace of this building is left today, our understanding of its cultic significance rests on the daybook and the recovered artifacts from the associ- ated votive deposit. Albeit on a smaller scale, this sanctu- ary appears to represent the same chronological periods and cultic characteristics as the Mater Matuta temple and it is most likely that we are dealing with a fertility cult simi- lar to other Hellenistic cults in central Italy. This new South- west Sanctuary at Satricum provides an important addi- tion to the rapidly increasing corpus of Latian and other Italic sanctuaries. ARCHITECTURAL MOLDINGS AS EVIDENCE OF INTER- PRETATIO ROMANA OF SANCTUARIES IN SOUTHERN ITALY: Ingrid E.M. Edlund-Berry, University of Texas at Austin The most characteristic architectural feature of a Roman or Romanized sanctuary was the presence of an Etrusco- Italic temple placed on a high podium. As shown by L.T. Shoe (Etruscan and Republican Roman Mouldings, Rome 1965), not only the floor plan of such a temple but also the use of variations of the "Etruscan round" for the top and bottom moldings indicate that the builders of these temples fol- lowed Etrusco-Italic rather than Greek traditions in Italy. Since the publication of Shoe's study in 1965, new evi- dence has appeared that shows that the use of the "Etrus- can round" allows us to identify the cultural and chron- ological context for buildings and other structures displaying this kind of molding. Examples come not only from monumental sanctuaries such as those at Pietrab- bondante, but also from small mountain shrines in Samnite territory (Vastogirardi, Schiavi d'Abruzzo, S. Giovanni in Galdo, and Trebula). These and other sites show that the interpretatio romana of sanctuaries in southern Italy in the second and first centuries B.C. tied local cults and cult places to Rome not only by the use of Latin or by votives of an Etrusco-Italic type but also by architectural details such as the "Etruscan round." THE 1993-1994 FIELD SEASONS AT CONTRADA MELLA (MAMERTION?) IN SOUTHWESTERN CALABRIA: Paolo Visond, University of Colorado at Boulder The 1993-1994 excavations of this Italic settlement, to be identified possibly with Strabo's Mamertion, uncovered two segments of a cobblestone plateia nearly 7 m wide flanking a block of Hellenistic houses on the westernmost terrace of the site, and confirmed the existence of a stenopos tersecting this major artery at right angles (Klearchos 32 [1992] 69-103; AJA 97 [1993] 320). The width and paving technique of the plateia are without parallel at other Bret- tian sites. Since both streets were probably laid out before the houses were built, this sector of the town may have had a regular grid as early as the third century B.C. After the destruction of the settlement in the second quarter of the first century B.C., a house was constructed largely with reused brick and tile on the eastern side of, and di- rectly upon, the pavement of the plateia. Fragments of Italian sigillata and of roof tiles with Latin stamps were found in the foundations of two of its rooms, and date this building to the beginning of the Empire. A fragment of Roman cast gold-band mosaic glass (similar to D.E Grose, The Toledo Museum ofArt. Early Ancient Glass [New York 1989] 238, no. 607) came from the debris layer upon the plateia, which may have remained in use, albeit as a pathway, until the first century A.D. In the vicinity of the Roman building the cobblestone pavement was overlaid with patches of a beaten earth surface containing sherds of sigillata, and was partly robbed out. Recent farmwork, however, appears to have caused the most extensive robbing of the street pavement.</page><page sequence="53">348 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 99 THE SOUTHERN MESSAPIA SURVEY: 1994 SEASON: Duane W Roller, Ohio State University, Lima The Southern Messapia Survey is a long-range project examining the area at the extremity of the heel of Italy, northwest of Capo di Leuca. The third season centered on areas to the north and west of those previously surveyed, in particular along the western portions of the Serra di Pozzo Mauro, and along the Serra Casa Vecchia, whose name is suggestive of early occupation. The eastern portion of the Serra di Pozzo Mauro was an area of Late Roman and Medieval farmsteads, and this pattern should continue to the west. The Serra Casa Vecchia lies just north of a well- watered area of Hellenistic and Roman farms. A principal goal of the 1994 season was to see if the pattern of popu- lation shift to the east in Late Roman times, discovered immediately south of this area in 1991-1992, continued on the Serra Casa Vecchia. In addition, the 1994 season made an intensive survey of ancient Uxentum, a Messapian center that was a free city even into Late Republican times, issuing its own coin- age. Although there has been some examination of its walls, and casual finds have been discovered, no systematic survey of the town site had ever been performed. Particular at- tention was paid to plotting and drawing the massive Hel- lenistic city walls, the most visible remains at the town site. The project also continued its long-range plan of mak- ing the first archaeological map of the heel of Italy, inte- grating aerial photographs, existing 1:100,000 maps, and the field results. RECENT SURVEY AND EXCAVATION OUTSIDE THE PORTA DELLA GIUSTIZIA AT POSEIDONIA-PAESTUM: James Higginbotham, Bowdoin College, andJohn Grifiths Pedley, University of Michigan The University of Michigan and Georgetown University under the auspices of the Soprintendenza archeologica delle Provincie di Salerno-Avellino-Benevento completed a field survey in 1992 and their first season of excavation during the summer of 1993. Study focused on a field in the Localita della Santa Venera directly south of the Capo- difiume and the Porta della Giustizia (South Gate) of Poseidonia-Paestum and adjacent to the site of the sanc- tuary excavated by the Universities of Michigan and Perugia in the 1980s. Building on the results of surveys of the Paestum area (by Marialuisa Maiello and Antonio Curzio under the auspices of the Universita di Salerno and another by Mikels Skele of Southern Illinois University), an area was selected that exhibited the potential for yielding material in suffi- cient quantity and variety to warrant more intensive study and excavation. During the summer of 1992 an intense systematic survey was conducted in the zone outside the Porta della Giustizia. This survey provided artifact density and distribution and identified likely sites for subsequent excavation. Excavation of this area in 1993 revealed extensive un- disturbed deposits and yielded ancient materials that ranged in date from the Middle Bronze Age (14th-12th centuries B.C.) until the later years of the Roman Empire (fourth century A.D.). This includes the remains of a Roman necropolis of Imperial date. The most compelling discov- eries were associated with original Roman colonization of this city during the third century B.C. Initial results from our excavation suggest the existence of a large paved "plaza" outside the southern gate of the city replete with a foun- tainhouse and assorted architecture. In addition, aided by aerial photography we were able to locate a large build- ing in this area that will also serve as a focus of future excavation. These structures bear witness to the varied activity outside the walls and hold out promise for further- ing our understanding of the colonial chora. UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA EXCAVATIONS AT LUGNANO, ITALY: FINAL REPORT: David Soren, University of Arizona The University of Arizona recently completed five years of excavations at Lugnano in Teverina, near Orvieto, Italy. Attention was given to the largest infant cemetery ever to be scientifically investigated in Italy. The 47 burials, dat- ing to the fifth century A.D., were distributed over four rooms. Choice of burial site and elaboration of the tomb depended to a large extent on the age of the child, with younger children receiving little or no attention. Amphora, Capuchin, small house, and a coppo burials were found along with simple inhumations. Many ancient Romans feared recently dead infants, who were believed to possess magical powers (Plut. De gen. 22.590F). This fear may explain the inclusion within the cemetery of such magical or apotro- paic items as 13 puppies, each five to six months in age, a raven's claw found on one child's skeleton, and a toad skeleton on another. Palaeopathological studies of the infant bones by the Arizona State Museum revealed evidence of porotic hyper- ostosis and rickets. The massing of infant burials in groups of up to seven at a time and the bone pathology suggest the possibility of an epidemic of falciparum malaria. His- torical studies by Frank Romer attest to widespread dis- ease, probably malaria, in Umbria in A.D. 467, cited by Sidonius in his travels along the Via Flaminia just west of Lugnano (Ep. 1.5.6-9). It is possible that the present exca- vations have unearthed the infant victims of a major re- corded malarial epidemic.

SESSION VI A: AIA/APA JOINT COLLOQUI- UM: ARCHAISM IN GREEK ART, HISTORY, AND LITERATURE UNDER THE ROMAN EMPIRE ARCHAISM AND THE ATHENIAN RELIGIOUS REFORM OF 21 B.C.: Sara B. Aleshire, University of Califor- nia, Berkeley In 1980J.H. Oliver claimed that about 21 B.C. there took place "a serious change . . . in how the Athenian consti- tution worked." Although some type of reform occurred at about this time, undoubtedly there was no "serious change in how the Athenian constitution worked," since the in- scription of prytany lists down to the third century A.D. shows the continued existence of tribes and demes, pry- taneis and the boule. Even from the evidence that Oliver cited it is clear that what the reform affected was not the constitution but rather the parallel structure dividing the Athenian citizen body into the four religious (Old Athenian) tribes and their constituent entities; further evidence-- here assembled for the first time - indicates that the Athe- nians also made significant changes in eligibility, tenure, and method of selection for most priesthoods. In addition, close reading of [Plut.] Vit. X orat. 843c reveals that the organizer of the reform was the daidouchos Themistocles Theophrastou Hagnousios. It is the purpose of this paper to argue that Themistocles attempted to establish the struc- ture described in Aristotle's Athenaion Politeia as pre- Cleisthenic. The reform should therefore be viewed along- side similar attempts to revive ancient forms in cult practices, legislative procedure, and epigraphic design as evidence of a significant archaizing movement in Augustan Athens. DEFINING ARCHAISM: STYLE AND RETROSPECTION IN ROMAN SCULPTURE: Mark D. Fullerton, Ohio State University Prior to any comparison between archaism in sculpture and archaism in literature, architecture, or epigraphy, it is necessary to consider the varying usage of the term "ar- chaism." Whereas in these other fields "archaism" gener- ally indicates the appearance of any anachronistic traits, sculptural studies tend to speak more specifically of Archaistic, Severizing, and Classicizing styles, each refer- ring to the formal traits that recur in the "archaizing" work. To validate the comparison with literary and other mani- festations of archaism, one must apply the parallel con- cept of archaism to the study of sculpture, thus including under the one heading not only several different styles but also many related types of sculpture (i.e., copies of earlier works, so-called Idealplastik and Neo-Attic reliefs). The crea- tion of subcategories in sculptural studies is based on the twin assumptions that definitions should be conceived for- malistically and that an archaizing image derives meaning primarily from its source. It is, however, less than obvious that these sculptures signify through conscious reference to historically linked prototypes or styles rather than through the employment of a continuous tradition wherein certain visual forms were associated with certain ideas. Moreover, we need to acknowledge how such terms as Archaistic, Classicizing, Severizing, etc., although defined according to strictly formal traits, reflect in themselves cer- tain assumptions about issues of intention and reception. Thus, primary to our understanding of archaism in all its manifestations is the inaugural problem of coining terms and developing definitions that adequately designate phe- nomena yet avoid prescriptive statements about sources and semiosis. EPIGRAPHIC ARCHAISM IN ROMAN ATHENS: Patricia A. Butz, University of Southern California No systematic analysis exists of the individual elements involved in the composition of an archaizing inscription, nor anything approaching a complete historical compendi- um of inscriptions displaying those characteristics com- piled in support of such an analysis. Nevertheless, groups of archaizing inscriptions, as well as single examples, have been identified and discussed (A. Raubitschek, DAA nos. 135a-b, pp. 146-52, esp. 149). These valuable studies sug- gest that certain periods produced many more archaizing inscriptions than others: in particular, two periods in Roman Athens, the Augustan and the Hadrianic. This paper first attempts to define ways in which an in- scription can be archaizing, including the text, the inscrip- tion proper, and the materials used. Analysis of an impor- tant archaizing inscription that may be considered a precursor to the Imperial examples, IG XI, 4, 712, honor- ing Scipio Africanus on Delos, according to these guide- lines, stresses the selection of elements, hence the self- consciousness involved in achieving the final product. Comparison of the form and degree of archaism in a number of inscriptions from both the Augustan and Hadrianic periods emphasizes layout versus letterform. The use of stoichedon in formatting an epigraphic text is the quintessential structural choice, and comparative analysis demonstrates how this element distinguishes Augustan from Hadrianic examples. Finally, an analysis of a catalogue of archaizing inscrip- tions from Athens during the Imperial period uses their content and social contexts to evaluate the meaning or pur- pose of epigraphic archaism during these periods and differences between Augustan and Hadrianic usage. PLUTARCH, HADRIAN, AND THE PROJECT OF AN ATHENOCENTRIC GREECE: Robert Lamberton, Wash- ington University Plutarch's Parallel Lives constitute the principal docu- ment in the high Empire's reinvention of classical Greece.</page><page sequence="55">350 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 99 What emerges, of course, is a vision of the Greek world as half of a diptych, face-to-face with, mirroring and mirrored by, the Roman world. Some of the implications of this bizarre project seem to have been too little appre- ciated, both in relation to the radicality of the distortion of Greek realities introduced by Plutarch's procrustean box of mirrors, and in relation to the implications of those distortions, not just for imperial Roman conceptions of classical Greece, but for all subsequent conceptions as well. The process of rethinking of the Greek past in terms of a contemporary reality dominated by the military, po- litical, and cultural power of Rome was centuries old by the time Plutarch made his contribution. More than one model had been tested, but that of Polybios can reason- ably be taken as normative. The destiny of the Roman people and of Roman rule takes firm hold of center stage. Greece is rethought as marginal. Delphi may be the center of the world, but the center of power is Rome, and it is only in relation to the irresistible growth of that power that the experience, interaction, and history of the Greek states can find their legitimate place in the scheme of things. The Lives, by contrast, are ahistorical or even antihistori- cal in the manner in which they abstract their subjects from any such concept of history. The box of mirrors pro- vides the new context, the substitute for history, but in its odd way it amounts to a re-creation of history along new and idiosyncratic lines. The culmination of Rome's retrospective revision of clas- sical Greek cultural history can perhaps best be seen in the Hadrianic institution of the Panhellenion, by virtue of which a panel sitting in Athens became the arbiter of Greekness throughout the Mediterranean world. But a gen- eration before the establishment of that institution, Plutarch's influential literary contribution to the imperial rethinking of the Greek past had laid the groundwork for these developments, and ultimately for what is in our own minds when we use the decidedly odd and imbalanced phrase "Greece and Rome." THE ROMAN FABRICATION OF GREEK ETHNICITY: Antony J.S. Spawforth, Newcastle-upon-Tyne University This paper explores the consequences for Rome's Greek- speaking subjects of Roman ethnic attitudes toward East- erners. It starts by reconstructing Rome's "approved" ver- sion of Greek ethnicity, one deeming the Greeks of Europe superior to those of Asia and among the former privileging a few communities in particular (Athenians, Spartans, Arcadians, and Argives) on essentially archaizing grounds. It then asks why Eastern cities were so concerned to define their ethnicity under the Principate and argues that the most bizarre aspect of this phenomenon, the fact that Athens, Sparta, Arcadia, and Argos are repeatedly claimed as city-founders, while it makes little historical sense (the first two communities are famous for not colonizing in early Greek history), is understandable as the strategy of East- ern cities seeking to reshape their ethnicity in line with Roman preferences. Third, it is argued that Hadrian's new organization of"Greek" cities, the Panhellenion, which ad- vertized sharply ethnic criteria of admission (Hellenized ithageneis, "aboriginals," were excluded), functioned to vali- date local redefinitions of ethnic identity. Fourth, the ambiguous status of Macedonian ethnicity under the Prin- cipate is explored. While there was official approval from Pompey on for the figure of Alexander, Rome's greatest foes included Eastern rulers of Macedonian descent- most obviously Cleopatra. How far did Roman denigration of Macedonian colonial stock as deracinated (found in Livy) and the apparent fact that no Macedonian foundations in the East were admitted to the Panhellenion, even though European Macedonians certainly were, reflect a Roman ethnic strategy distinguishing different categories of "Macedonian"? SESSION VI B: ITALY AND SARDINIA: LATE BRONZE AND IRON AGE RECONSTRUCTING THE PALAEOECONOMY OF PREHIS- TORIC SARDINIA: EXCAVATION OF A LATE BRONZE/ EARLY IRON AGE VILLAGE: LenoreJ. Gallin, Diablo Valley College Excavations at Nuraghe Santa Barbara, Bauladu (1986- 1989) provide important information on prehistoric Sardinia, already noted for achievements in monumental architecture and prolific metallurgical activities, includ- ing the production of highly prized miniature figurines. Nuragic culture has been inadequately documented and poorly understood, primarily due to the paucity of exca- vated sites and the lack of a verifiable data base. The quan- tity and quality of archaeological material retrieved at Nuraghe Santa Barbara is filling in many of these gaps. The multi-towered complex and five-acre 12th-8th century B.C. village provide evidence for an intensity and array of socioeconomic activities, and the site is unique because it contains the first excavated metallurgical workshop dis- covered on Sardinia. Hundreds of metal objects and clay molds used for lost-wax investment expand the poorly doc- umented history of bronze casting in ancient Sardinia. Since the island sits at the crossroads of the eastern and western Mediterranean, with important parallels and links to other developing societies, material from Santa Barbara sheds light on the direction and date of the transfer of metal- lurgical technology between regions. A large assembly of faunal material from good Nuragic contexts permits inter- pretations relating to both the ancient Sardinian diet and stock-raising practices. Retrieval of ceramics from Nuragic, Punic, Roman, and Medieval phases contributes to a chrono- logically controlled ceramic sequence with the potential to trace culture change and shed light on a period in Sar- dinian prehistory in which early Mycenaean and Phoeni- cian contacts are documented but poorly understood. How REAL IS REAL. AN ETRUSCAN TOMB GROUP FROM CHIUSI RECONSIDERED: P Gregory Warden, South- ern Methodist University A group of objects from Chiusi, now in the University Museum, Philadelphia, has been well known since its pub- lication (E.H. Dohan, AJA 39 [1935] 198-209) and was re- constructed as a tomb group of the seventh century B.C.</page><page sequence="56">1995] THE 96TH ANNUAL MEETING 351 on the basis of the seemingly incontrovertible evidence of a published excavation report. The objects include a rare terracotta vase with plastic decoration, as well as bronze vases and furniture, a small table, and an undersized "throne." The group itself seemed all the more unusual because it found its way into an American collection while seeming to preserve its archaeological context and integrity. For the last 20 years, however, this material has not been on display and its authenticity has been questioned. Close examination of these objects reveals that their fabric is not uniform, that parts are clearly modern, and that some of them have been assembled from a number of pieces. While not outright fakes, some of the objects are pastiches, but others may be original. The group, however, was prob- ably a 19th-century creation of a dealer who assembled the pieces and sold them along with genuine material. That the objects were published as part of a genuine excavation context is a sobering reminder of the duplicity and inge- nuity of the antiquities trade, even a century ago. HERAKLES AND HERA IN ETRURIA: A GROUP OF ARCHAIC BRONZE TRIPODS FROM VULCI: Anne C. Leinster, J. Paul Getty Museum Although bronze tripods were common in the Mediter- ranean area since the Mycenaean era, it was during the Archaic period that their production and distribution was greatest. The human, animal, and mythological figures used to decorate a large number of Archaic examples evince a shift from functional vessels to prestige items, richly em- bellished with imagery. Bronze tripods were certainly popular in Greece, but perhaps the most prolific tripod makers were the Etrus- cans; the site of Vulci in particular has yielded a large number. Scholars have classified the Etruscan tripods ac- cording to their decorative elements, techniques of manu- facture, and context. The iconography of the figural groups, however, has not received the attention it deserves, per- haps on account of the assumption that the Etruscans simply adopted Greek motifs and used them in random groupings in a purely decorative manner. This paper examines a set of figures that adorn many Vulcian tripods, depicting Herakles defending Hera from the silens. Although the ancestry of this story can be traced back to a Greek tradition, visual representations of it are more common in Etruria and Southern Italy, as is witnessed by its appearance in the metopes of the Temple of Hera at Foce del Sele, to name only one example. I propose that the motif of Herakles and Hera had a special relevance for the Etruscans; its occurrence on these tripods was not coincidental, nor were the images chosen at random from the Greek repertoire. THE THEME OF PERSEUS AND THE GORGON ON ETRUSCAN MIRRORS: Evelyn E. Bell, University of Santa Clara The theme of Perseus and the Gorgon appears on at least 16 Etruscan engraved mirrors. Various episodes of the legend are represented, including Perseus's visit to the Graiai, his slaying of Medusa, and his flight from the Gorgons' father Phorkys. These specific narrative scenes appear on the earliest mirrors, which belong to the fourth century B.C. The later mirrors display symbolic motifs, such as Perseus holding up the Gorgoneion, or Athena reflect- ing its image for the hero in a pool. An unpublished mirror in Berkeley (Phoebe Apperson Hearst Museum 8-3228), of the early third century B.C., represents Perseus running with the head of Medusa in his hand. To either side of him sits a youth, one semi-draped in a himation, the other clad as a warrior. Neither figure seems to be connected with the Gorgon legend. The Berke- ley mirror appears to be the work of the same engraver as a mirror in the Villa Giulia (no. 51108), which repre- sents Athena displaying the Gorgoneion to Perseus and two onlookers. As a mirror motif, the theme of Perseus and Medusa is highly suitable. The Gorgon head, particularly when por- trayed as young and beautiful, becomes a metaphor for the user's own mirror image. The motif of Athena reflect- ing the Gorgoneion in a pool is an obvious play on the reflecting quality of the mirror. Finally the Gorgoneion could serve as an apotropaic device to protect both the mirror and its owner in the afterlife. The popularity of the Gorgon myth among the Etrus- can women who owned the mirrors suggests that they were familiar with the story from attending the theater. Such narrative motifs as Perseus's visit to the Graiai may have been inspired by performances of Aeschylus's Perseus tetralogy, one play of which, the Phorkides, dealt with the arming of Perseus and the slaying of Medusa. THE SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE ITALIC HOUSE, 800-550 B.C.: Owen Doonan, Bilkent University The development of architectural form in central Italy is all too often considered to be the product of diffusion, an ill-defined process that leads to weak generalizations about the "Hellenization" of Italy in response to Greek col- onization. But when innovations in domestic architecture are examined as responses to the changing role of the house in structuring daily life, a different picture emerges. Be- cause the house structures and is structured by social ac- tivity in a complex dialectical relationship, it is possible to isolate the effects that specific social institutions have on domestic form. Domestic architecture at Marzabotto, Acquarossa, Luni sul Mignone, Tarquinia, Sorgenti della Nova, Rome, and Satricum is examined with its material assemblage in order to provide a reliable archaeological base for changing ac- tivity within an architecturally defined frame. Develop- ment of social institutions like banqueting, patron-client relationships, changing structure of domestic production, and aristocratic competitiveness are considered in the light of architectural changes. The stresses generated by these evolving institutions within a domestic setting are then related to the solutions adopted by occupants. In each case, specific social institutions encouraged a variety of inno- vations in house form, influencing the kinds of choices made by house occupants and builders. The result is a model of architectural development that emphasizes na- tive innovative process and the changing relationship be-</page><page sequence="57">352 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 99 tween houses and communities in structuring public and private activities. SESSION VI C: NORTH AFRICA AND EGYPT THE LEPTIMINUS ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROJECT: PRELIM- INARY REPORT ON FOUR SEASONS OF URBAN SUR- VEY OF A PORT TOWN IN TUNISIA: David L. Stone, Kelsey Museum of Archaeology, Sebastian ES. Heath, University of Michigan, DavidJ. Mattingly, University of Leicester, and Nejib Belazreg, Insti- tut national du patrimoine The site of Leptiminus, a major port town on the coast of the Tunisian Sahel, is the object of a long-term program of research begun in 1990 and conducted jointly by the Institut national du patrimoine of Tunisia and the Uni- versity of Michigan. The urban area of ancient Leptimi- nus is today largely open agricultural land, primarily given over to barley fields and olive orchards, situated around two seasonal riverbeds (wadis). Four seasons of intensive survey work have concentrated on the 1.5-km2 townscape. The Leptiminus survey has proceeded on a field-by-field basis, collecting information on the last 2,500 years of human occupation at the site. The primary objective of the project is to examine variation in chronology and in the use of different areas of the settlement throughout its long history as a Phoenician colony, Roman town, and Vandal, Byzantine, and Islamic center. The surface archae- ological record indicates locations of cemeteries, domes- tic housing, public buildings, ceramic and metal produc- tion, water storage, and a harbor. Of particular interest are amphora and African Red Slip ware production areas, which are being investigated through a variety of tech- niques. In the last year the project has begun mapping standing remains and topography using a total station. This has allowed the accurate integration of all facets of the project into a geographic information system (GIS). This paper concentrates on the presentation of the results of the first four seasons, but also considers survey method- ology and data analysis. The survey benefits from other aspects of the Leptiminus Archaeological Project, which is a collaborative interdisciplinary research effort involv- ing geologists, geophysicists, palaeobotanists, palaeoste- ologists, palynologists, and archaeologists specializing in field survey, excavation, and ceramics. SUBURBANA OEENSIA: ROMAN VILLAS IN THE REGION OF TRIPOLI, LIBYA: Jj. Rossiter, University of Alberta The Roman city of Oea (modern Tripoli) in Libya re- mains the least explored of the three cities of ancient Tripo- litania. Unlike its sister cities, Sabratha and Lepcis Magna, Roman Oea lies largely lost beneath a huge modern con- urbation. Beyond the modern city, however, traces of Roman construction have often been recorded - mosaics, cisterns, tombs, etc.- giving us some idea of the nature of Roman development in the suburban territorium of the city. This paper considers the form and extent of this archaeolog- ical evidence, and by comparison with what is known of other North African cities, in particular the neighboring city of Lepcis Magna, presents a revised picture of the ter- ritory of Oea in Roman times. Special emphasis is placed on the development of luxury villas, with discussion of their relationship both to the city and to the Tripolitanian hinterland. A revised map showing the distribution of villas in the region of Tripoli is included (cf. the version by D. Mattingly, LibSt 19 [1988] 21-41). The history of villa con- struction in the territory is reviewed in an attempt to iden- tify regional characteristics of villa design and local build- ing styles. Finally, comparison is made between the archaeological evidence for suburban development around Oea and the written testimony of Apuleius, whose Apolo- gia contains several references to villas and farms in the area. THE ROMAN ODEON AT CARTHAGE: NEW DISCOVERIES: Colin M. Wells, Trinity University The odeon at Carthage, the largest in the Roman world, was first excavated by P. Gauckler in 1900 and 1901, with further unpublished excavations by M.A. Driss in the 1950s. Even a casual walk over the exposed remains suffices to show that neither of the published plans (M.E. Sadoux in Gauckler, RA 1902, 24; A. Lezine, Architecture romaine d'Afrique [Paris 1963] 56) is either complete or accurate. A new sur- vey of the site was begun by E.R. Haldenby (University of Waterloo) in February and March 1994, and continued in July, with fresh excavations under the direction of Wells taking place in May and June. These excavations showed that the vaulted structures running along the front of the stage and through the central axis of the auditorium are indeed drains, as Gauckler claimed, and not underground corridors, as was Lezine's theory, but they do not meet in a T in front of the stage, as published plans indicate, nor do they appear to discharge the water they carry into the massive cisterns that are a feature of the site. How the cis- terns were fed, and exactly how the drains functioned re- quire further investigation. We have cleared the surface of the orchestra, and it is now possible for the first time to plot the massive concrete foundations of the seating and of the outer wall of the odeon. The concrete proves to extend southward out to the line of decumanus V, where massive masonry in situ appears to represent the foun- dation for a portico or monumental entrance. Both Sadoux's and Lezine's plans are particularly inaccurate in this part of the building. In the southeast and northeast corners of the building we have now found stratigraphy undisturbed by earlier excavation, and we expect further excavation next year to reveal more of the history and lay- out of the building and of its relationship to the adja- cent streets. THE AFRICAN DOMESTIC NYMPHAEUM: Diana K. Brulhart, University of Alberta A distinctive type of mosaic-lined basin is found in the peristyles of almost every Romano-African house. In 1980</page><page sequence="58">1995] THE 96TH ANNUAL MEETING 353 Darmon (Nymfarum Domus: les pavements de la Maison des Nymphes a Neapolis, 1980) published a basin from the House of the Nymphs at Nabeul, Tunisia, which carries the mo- saic inscription "NYMFARVM DOMVS." This discovery led him to argue that these basins are a form of nymphaeum and to make a few preliminary observations on the sub- ject. Despite these observations, no formal study of these basins has been carried out and they have yet to be gener- ally accepted into the canon of Roman domestic nymphaea. I have recently completed a study of the basins of this type in Tunisia and conclude that they should be placed in the category of nymphaea, with all the religious significance such a designation implies. Yet there is also a pronounced secular character in these African nymphaea. Italian basins differ in appearance ac- cording to function, so that although the sacred nymphae- um and the decorative or utilitarian fountain basin are both placed in a peristyle context, they are separated by location, design, decoration, etc. The African nymphaeum, however, combines all of these designs in one structure, thus merging the sacred and secular functions of water. It also employs common regional mosaic motifs, different from those found on Italian nymphaea, but which have been skillfully adapted to the sacred function of the nymphaeum. As the nymphaea in Tunisia date from the second to the fifth centuries, later than the examples known from Pompeii, their merging of functions may be seen as a move toward divesting the water-related mosaic of its purely sacred connotations, the later evolution of which can be seen in Luxorius's description of a mosaic-lined nymphaeum used for watering horses. EARLY ROMAN AMPHORAS IN THE COLLECTION OF THE MUSEIE DE CARTHAGE, TUNISIA: Joann Freed, Wilfrid Laurier University, and Jennifer Moore, McMaster University Since 1990, one of us (J.E) has been cataloguing the col- lection of traded amphoras in the Musee national de Carthage, with the kind permission of Site Director Abdul- majid Ennabli. The collection comprises about 500 Early Roman amphoras, of which 225 are more or less complete and 275 are fragmentary. Many correspond to finds in epi- graphic publications of A.L. Delattre that appeared between 1882 and 1912. Delattre dug a "wall" of amphoras on the southeast face of the Byrsa Hill (the amphoras date between 43 and 15 B.C.) and a second "wall," near the sea, dated to the mid-first century A.D. We now document a mini- mum of 115 amphoras, nearly all fragments, that corre- spond to the epigraphy from the "First Amphora Wall"; seven amphoras correspond to the "Second Amphora Wall," and many more stamped fragments of Early Roman am- phoras correspond to other published Delattre finds. These amphoras are crucial evidence for the economic history of Early Roman Carthage. Our research shows that the new colony imported a range of wine amphoras com- parable to that of contemporary Rome, but identification of types and fabrics combined with the dated contexts and epigraphy lead to many new observations. For example, the Augustan foundation of Carthage is contemporary with the process in which the Koan-derived amphora forms (Dressel 2-4) become dominant in southwestern Italy; the evidence of the "First Amphora Wall" shows that the change was not gradual, but immediate and widespread. THE CLAY SEALS FROM THE CARTHAGINIAN TEMPLE ARCHIVE: Dietrich Berges, Archiiologisches Insti- tut, UniversitUt Hamburg Between 1989 and 1993, approximately 4,000 clay seals were unearthed at the excavations carried out by the Deutsches Archaiologisches Institut at Carthage under the supervision of E Rakob. They date from the Punic settle- ment period and can be considered the remains of an archive. This archive probably was part of a temple estate, the foundations of which were unearthed by the German excavations. The clay seals include numerous seals with regal cartouches of Tutmosis III, which can be considered evidence of the archival administration, as well as impres- sions of (Western) Greek seal stones and rings, which testify to an early and lasting Hellenization of Punic Carthage. As the excavation findings and the stylistic attribution of the oldest seals prove, the archive- the remains of which have survived in the form of clay seals-was constructed in the late sixth or early fifth century B.C., and it perished during the destruction of Carthage by the Romans in 146 B.C. The originally unfired clay seals were hardened by the fire that destroyed the city during the conquest of Carthage, and thus they were preserved as sole witnesses of this only known Punic archive. EXCAVATIONS IN THE ISLAMIC CITY OF AYLA: Donald Whitcomb, The Oriental Institute, University of Chicago The Aqaba project of the Oriental Institute discovered the Early Islamic city of Ayla in 1986. Subsequent seasons have revealed the extensive city wall with its towers and four city gates, all preserved some 4 m in height. These excavations have produced an extensive artifactual inven- tory documenting some four and a half centuries of oc- cupation, from ca. 650 to 1100. Phase A (650-750) is the period in which the city plan and artifacts testify to the gradual transformation from Late Byzantine into Early Islamic styles in the time of the first caliphs and the Umayyad dynasty. Aqaba has made major contributions toward our understanding of an Early Islamic city, an ex- ample of an amsar. Phase B (750-850) began with the earth- quake of 748, followed by energetic reconstruction into a new, more prosperous town under the Abbasids. Phase C (850-950) is our mystery century. Apparently nothing dra- matic happened; neither political nor natural events marred its tranquility. Phase D (950-1050) was, by dramatic con- trast, a period in which Fatimids warred with Byzantines and Seljuqs. In this anarchy, the town was sacked by the Banu Jarrah, which may have resulted in two hoards of gold dinars. Finally, phase E (1050-1100) was the aftermath of the 1068 earthquake, which ended with the arrival of Crusaders and abandonment in 1116.</page><page sequence="59">354 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 99 This historical outline is the result of detailed strati- graphic evidence. The 1993 season marked a new stage in the archaeological investigation of Aqaba. The entire effort was focused on a single structure, hypothesized to have been the main Congregational Mosque of the city. The structure uncovered is indeed a very early mosque but with structural anomalies that need further investi- gation. The mosque was the first and most important of the central institutions of this Early Islamic city. Fu- ture seasons will examine the nearby administrative and economic institutions, the governor's palace, and suqs (marketplaces). SESSION VI D: COINS AND JEWELRY HIPPOKRATES, NOT MORGANTINA: THE MEANING OF A MONOGRAM: Brooks Emmons Levy, Princeton Uni- versity Library Hoard evidence confirms a Second Punic War date for the small gold and silver series with ethnic SIKELIOTAN. These coins also bear a monogram. Looking like Iota Sigma joined by a horizontal bar, it used to be read [H]I[eronos] S[yrakosiou]. But Sjoquist, judging the ligature palaeo- graphically indefensible, proposed viewing it sideways as MT, for M[organ]T[ina]. His reading and mint attribution have been doubted, but no better solution has appeared. This paper proposes the reading [H]I[ppokrate]S, which assumes "abbreviation by contraction," attested for some Phoenician and Punic coinages. Unusual for Greek, it is used on the Greek-inscribed silver of two Hellenistic Phoe- nician mints: Tyre (rarely) and Arados (regularly). More- over, at Tyre a ligature might join the pair of letters, pre- sumably to show one word was represented. That offers a parallel for Iota Sigma in the SIKELIOTAN series. Hippokrates was the grandson of a Syracusan exiled in Carthage. As Hannibal's envoy he tried to detach Syra- cuse from Rome. In summer 212 the Sicilians, wary of clandestine Syracusan negotiations with the Romans (Livy 25.23), swore to maintain their mutual alliance and en- trusted themselves to Hippokrates; they sent him supplies and a large expeditionary force (App. Sic. 4). The SIKELIO- TAN series may represent their initial support for this enter- prise, marked with their ethnic and their Graeco-Punic general's monogram: the date must be mid-212, and the terminus ante quem Hippokrates' death. IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF BYZANTIUM: THE EARLY SECOND- CENTURY B.C. PRODUCTION OF POSTHUMOUS LYSI- MACHI FROM SMALLER MINTS: Constantin A. Mari- nescu, Columbia University At the beginning of the second century B.C. the greatest percentage of coins minted posthumously under the name of King Lysimachus was produced by the city of Byzantium, which had been minting such coins for over 50 years. Dur- ing the next half century, however, several smaller mints also emitted posthumous Lysimachi although their out- put never rivaled that of Byzantium. This paper discusses these secondary coinages in an attempt to understand bet- ter their chronology and relationship to Byzantium's series and to one another. Prominent among these coinages are the tetradrachms of Chalcedon, the sister city of Byzantium across the Bos- porus. A peculiar characteristic of Chalcedon's coins at the dawn of the second century is the convention of writ- ing out the name of the magistrate in full, a practice seldom seen elsewhere. Clearly struck by the same workshop as Byzantium, these coins cease being made sometime before 150 B.C. Other mints involved in minting similar Lysimachi include Perinthos, Tenedos, Chersonesos, Abydos, and Herakleia Pontica, the last two mints also striking drachms. Closely related to them is an unattributed series of tetra- drachms characterized by a magnificent thunderbolt as an exergue symbol. Stylistically the dies of these coins- particularly those of Abydos and Perinthos- show great affinity to the ones from Byzantium, indicating that the same engraving workshop was busy supplying dies to sev- eral cities; chronologically all these coinages fit comfort- ably in the first half of the second century B.C. It becomes clear, therefore, that during this period sev- eral cities in the Propontic and Pontic areas decided to produce Lysimachi, a popular coinage that was undoubtedly meant to meet the requirements of international trade. The engravers employed by many of these mints were the same men who worked for Byzantium, and their workshop is likely to have serviced numerous cities in the neighbor- ing region. THE SECOND-CENTURY B.C. SILVER COINAGE OF EPHE- sos: Elizabeth Kosmetatou, Ohio State University A die study of the second-century B.C. Attic-weight silver drachms of Ephesos is long overdue. The chronology of this important series was established by Head in his study of the mint of Ephesos in antiquity and by Le Rider in his recent study of the coinage of Ephesos and Arados, but was not based on a die study. This report's proposed chronology is based on a die study of Ephesos drachms and on hoard evidence. More than 500 coins in major collections and published in sales cata- logues are included. Head and Le Rider's studies included fewer than 200 specimens. The type represented by this series was traditional for the mint of Ephesos: obverse with a bee seen from above, ethnic E and F; reverse with a stag standing in front of a palm tree. The moneyer's name is on the right. My die study and consideration of the hoard evidence suggest a large silver coinage spanning the years ca. 202-150 B.C. and circulating throughout the Hellenistic world, with the names of at least 151 moneyers given. This series was first struck during the city's brief period of independence, from 202 to 188 B.C. After the Peace of Apamea, Ephesos became part of the Attalid kingdom, but retained some degree of autonomy, since it continued to mint its inde- pendent series. The Ephesos drachms were struck until</page><page sequence="60">1995] THE 96TH ANNUAL MEETING 355 ca. 150 B.C., when the Attalids probably gave up their Attic- weight coinage completely and henceforth only minted cistophori. Its wide circulation was taken over by the con- temporary and similar silver drachm series of Arados. CURRENCY IN THIRD- AND FOURTH-CENTURY CAR- THAGE: NEW EVIDENCE FROM THE 1992-1993 UNI- VERSITY OF GEORGIA EXCAVATIONS: Liane Houghta- lin, Randolph-Macon College, and John D. Mac Isaac, Mary Washington College Active excavation at Carthage by many teams over the past 20 years has produced thousands of numismatic finds. Typically, these finds came from two sources: either from layers formed during the Late Antique period or from very disturbed layers. The sheer volume of coins found, how- ever, and the fact that the finds range from the Punic period to the last days of ancient Carthage have led some numis- matists to draw conclusions about the circulation of cur- rency for every period of Roman Carthage. The 1992-1993 University of Georgia excavations in the Yasmina necropolis at Carthage uncovered relatively un- disturbed levels from the second to the fourth centuries A.D. and provide us with a new perspective on the coins in circulation during those centuries. The finds from these excavations show that, contrary to previous speculations, Roman Carthage did in fact make significant use of large module bronze coins such as sestertii during the first half of the third century. They demonstrate that official Roman issues from A.D. 250 to 273 circulated in greater numbers than previously thought and that barbarous radiates of apparently Gallic origin played a hitherto unsuspected major role in the currency of Carthage during the second half of the third century and possibly the first quarter of the fourth. Finally, they offer a solution to the question of whether the barbarous radiates with a "fifth-century" module date to the earlier fourth century or to the second half of the fifth. ILLUSIONISM AND REVISIONISM: THE DESIGN AND DATE OF A PENDANT AT DUMBARTON OAKS: Stephen R. Zwirn, Dumbarton Oaks For over 50 years, a gold necklace and pendant in the Dumbarton Oaks Collection have been considered fine but rare examples of Early Byzantine jewelry. Acquired as an ensemble, but eventually separated and treated as dis- sociated pieces, the pendant and necklace have nonethe- less retained the same attributions: Egypt (?), early seventh century. The necklace and pendant have, however, remained iso- lated among Early Byzantine goldwork. Critical to a re- evaluation and reattribution of these works is a revised "reading" of the pendant's shape. Believed to represent a cross, and catalogued as cruciform, this perceived shape supported an attribution to a Christian society. A cross does not really exist, however, but is the result of three aesthetic effects: optical illusionism, Gestalt perception, and, as a case study in the history of collecting, a predis- position to see with "Byzantine" eyes. Analysis of the pendant's design demonstrates that the "cross" is interstitial, not a positive element. Among Early Christian and Early Byzantine realia, no crosses are known to have been created as negative shapes. Dissociated from a Christian context, both the pendant and the necklace can be dated to the Roman Imperial period, most likely the third century. Comparisons are made with extant jewelry and representations of jewelry in painting and sculpture. This revised chronology removes them from their isolation among Early Byzantine works and restores them as an ensemble, reflecting Roman taste and style. LOVEMAKING OR BANQUETING? Faya Causey, Cali- fornia State University, Long Beach A multi-figured pendant dating to the Archaic period found at Falconara, Italy (in ancient Picenum) was bought early in this century by Pierpont Morgan and then entered the collections of the Metropolitan Museum in 1913. From the time of its first appearance, the large pendant caused a minor sensation among those interested in the art of pre-Roman Italy and in the ancient amber trade. Despite the hundreds of figured ambers that have since come to light, the Metropolitan pendant still stands out as one of the most important amber objects of pre-Roman Italy. The pendant was the object of important studies by Carlo Albizzatti (1919) and Friedrich Kredel (1924), both of whom emphasized the stylistic and iconographic significance of the piece. Each scholar was convinced that the main figures were mythological in nature, suggesting that they repre- sented the lovemaking of Aphrodite and Adonis. The peculiarities of the style led Albizzatti to identify it as an Ionian Greek work produced for a local Picene client. Kredel identified it as a Greek work for a Greek client living in Italy. In 1940, Gisela Richter catalogued the pendant in the handbook to the Etruscan collections as "Etruscan or made by a Greek in Italy" and accepted the mytholog- ical interpretation. Until now, this has remained the gen- erally accepted opinion. This paper presents a reevaluation of the amber pendant in light of recent scholarship in anthropology, carved ambers, and Etruscan and Italic art. It is argued that this object should first be considered as a grave furnishing, that it was produced locally for a native Picene client, that the subject and the style are strongly influenced by Etruscan art, and that the pendant represents a reclining couple with attendants at a funerary banquet. TWO UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS OF GOLD-GLASS IN PTOLEMY'S GRAND PROCESSION: E. Marianne Stern, Toledo Society The most exquisite glass of the Hellenistic period is sand- wich gold-glass: intricate foliate designs in openwork gold</page><page sequence="61">356 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 99 leaf sandwiched between two layers of transparent glass. The production of such vessels is commonly ascribed to Alexandria. The mention of two unidentified objects of glass interworked with gold (hyalina diachrysa dyo), carried in a festive procession of Ptolemy II Philadelphos in Alex- andria, ca. 279-278 B.C., is often quoted in support of this theory (Ath. 5.30.199F). Chronological, contextual, and technical considerations, however, argue against identifying the objects carried in Ptolemy's procession as sandwich gold-glass cups. No other evidence exists for assigning the production of sandwich gold-glass to Alexandria or Egypt. Therefore, a new inter- pretation of this important literary citation is offered, that these objects were plaques of glass backed by openwork gold leaf. The technique of cutting out figures in gold leaf and mounting them on transparent glass is documented as early as the second half of the fourth century B.C. in northern Greece. Small rectangular glass plaques backed with figural scenes in openwork gold leaf decorated the funerary furni- ture found in several rich tombs, including the so-called Tomb of Philip II at Vergina. The Greek term hyalina diachrysa would be an appropriate description for objects made in this technique. Ptolemy, himself of Macedonian descent, would have known about such Macedonian novel- ties. It is here suggested that the objects in the Grand Pro- cession were two large plaques made in this technique, mounted upright for exhibition on sideboards (kylikeia). The plaques might have been fancy serving trays for use at symposia. INDEX OF AUTHORS Each author's name is followed by the page number(s) in this issue on which his or her abstract is printed.
