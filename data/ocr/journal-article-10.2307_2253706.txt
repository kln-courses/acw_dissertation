<plain_text><page sequence="1">Memory and Mind. By NORMAN MALCOLM. Ithaca and London: Cornell University Press, 1977. Pp. 277. ~9.75- The underlying assumption of this study of philosophical, and psycho- logical, accounts of memory seems to be that it is a mistake to look for some common core or nature, phenomenon or mechanism, for all instances of memory, whether of memory in general or of the particular varieties that might be distinguished. Even Malcolm's own previous writings are not exempted from this error, in thinking that the different types of remembering all involve some element of remembering that. Yet even if Malcolm's particular criticisms are correct, it still seems to me implausible to insist that there can be no common strand, or strands, linking the different types and cases of memory. It can hardly be mere accident that we use the same term throughout, or that different instances of remembering can be usefully categorized together. However Malcolm's attack is divided into two parts, one against 'theories of mental mechanisms, the other against theories of physical mechanisms. Accordingly Part One discusses and dismisses such sug- gestions as that memory necessarily has the past, perhaps even past experiences, for its object, that memory consists in a direct awareness of the past, that 'genuine' memory involves specific memory occurrences, that remembering provides a source of information, that remembering requires representations of what is remembered. The argument is, for the most part, familiar enough, and sometimes rather ponderous. Most of the writings discussed are pre-war, 'historical curiosities' as Malcolm himself describes them, and unlikely to be acceptable in their original form to anyone, post-Ryle and Wittgenstein. At the same time Malcolm makes curiously heavy weather of some points, evidently because of a failure to appreciate that the traditional theories tend to concentrate on what has variously been termed personal, event or perceptual memory, to the exclusion of other types (just why this should be is a matter which seems never to have been properly explored). Thus it requires no great effort to show the implausibility of the claim e.g. that memory is essentially of the past, once it is extended to cover factual memory (cf. remembering that 7 x 7--49) or practical memory (cf. remembering how to tie a clove hitch). Yet in developing this point at length, though not in these terms, Malcolm leaves quite untouched the original suggestion, that personal memory, at any rate, is essentially of the past. Again, he ascribes</page><page sequence="2">632 BOOK REVIEWS the picture theory of memory, the idea that to remember something is to form a mental picture of it, to the picture theory of thought, the idea that to think, e.g. that the window is near the fire, is to picture it. His criticism of this latter theory incorporates a useful discussion of the position of the earlier and later Wittgenstein, yet it is surely not the case, as Malcolm believes, that the.picture theory of memory arises from a mistaken emphasis on factual memory. It is, rather, personal memory to which the theory most naturally applies, and of which, for all that Malcolm says, it may yet be true. On a more personal note, Malcolm simply repeats his earlier argument that it is logically impossible for all a person's memory beliefs to be mistaken, without considering the various criticisms which have been made of it (see my Memory pp. 120 ff., and references there); and in rejecting the idea that memory provides us with knowledge, fails to notice a case where, it has been claimed, a memory representation might indeed provide us with information which we did not previously know (see Memory pp. 83-4). The busy reader is best advised to go directly to Part Two, which would have constituted a suitably challenging monograph on its own. In physical theories of memory the memory image gives way to the memory trace, for which three claims have been made: that it plays a causal role in bringing about memory responses; that it provides for the retention or storage of experiences and information; and that it constitutes a representation of what is remembered, in virtue of some structural similarity or analogue. On the first score Malcolm allows that memory involves a causal element, but insists that this need not require a causal process mediated by a memory trace. In its place he defends the idea of mnemic causation, causation across a temporal gap, though without endorsing the idea of mnemic causal laws. Yet Malcolm's supporting examples may not, as he thinks, be instances of causation across a temporal gap without benefit of an intervening process. Most are examples of reasons for acting, as when I refuse to see someone now because he lied to me two weeks ago. But strictly, what causes and explains my present refusal is not his previous lying but my present belief that he did lie to me: it is only insofar as I believe it so that his lying causes or explains my action, and that belief would cause and explain my action even if I were mistaken, even if he did not lie to me. On the second point Malcolm rejects the assumption that retention involves storage, though without invoking Squires' useful argument that retention need not involve a causal process either. As regards the third claim Malcolm argues persuasively that remembering need not involve any representation of what is remem- bered, and that the variety of possible memory responses shows that there need be no structural similarity between what is remembered, or for that matter the memory trace, and the remembering of it. But this seems to leave untouched the claim that there will be some structural similarity between the original experience and the trace which is supposed to make this variety of responses possible. However there is much in all that which deserves more attention than I can give it here. In the course of these arguments Malcolm is rightly contemptuous of</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 633 what might be termed 'brain anthropomorphism', whereby brains are ascribed properties and abilities properly pertaining to people. A final chapter rejects the possibility of establishing an isomorphism between the structural properties of experience and the structural properties of neural processes, largely because of the impossibility of finding a common structure for certain forms of experience; pours merited scorn on Harman's attempt to derive a structure of experience from the structure of language; and, in an appendix, usefully summarises a recent study which questions the likelihood of one-one correlations, sufficient to warrant a claim of identity, between mind and brain. If Part One is rather disappointing, Part Two is contentious and raises several matters for further discussion. As usual we have to thank Professor Malcolm for the extreme clarity of his prose, his steadfast refusal to disguise or obfuscate his argument with jargon or formalism, epigrams or contrived elegance. It is a model of philosophical writing which might usefully be studied in this country, as much as in his own. UNIVERSITY OF WARWICK DON LOCKE</page></plain_text>
