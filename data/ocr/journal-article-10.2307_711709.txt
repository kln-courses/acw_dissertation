<plain_text><page sequence="1">417 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW auspices of the British Academy. An Introduction (pp. xv-xix) outlines what is included (the western part of Hadrian's Wall with its northern outpost forts at Netherby and Bewcastle, and, in a separate section, Carlisle), arrangement, what is excluded (architectural sculpture apart from decorated window heads and door lintels, and undecorated altars), the problem of' Celtic heads', new finds, dating (most if not all second or third century A.D.), distribution (clustered around the Wall and forts), materials (nearly all local buff sandstone, or local red sandstone which can occur in white, yellow or purple forms; unfortunately the other materials occasionally used - limestone, bronze - are not discussed, nor is there an Index of Materials), methods (including covering with gesso, and painting) and workshops. 535 items are then catalogued, as follows: Part I, Hadrian's Wall west of the river North Tyne: (1) Roman deities (Aesculapius, Apollo, Atlas, Victories, Cupid, Diana, Disciplina, Fortuna, Genius, Hercules, Jupiter Optimus Maximus, Mercury, Minerva, Neptune, Numen Augusti, Nymphs, River God, Silvanus, Triton, Victory), (2) oriental deities (Attis (?), Attis or Men, Cautes, Cautopates, Cybele, Juno Regina, Jupiter Dolichenus, Mithras, Regina Caelestis, Sol Mithras, Sol, Sol Invictus, Sea Suria), (3) Romano-Celtic deities (Blatucadrus, Belatucairus, Cocidius, Coventina, Epona, Genii Cucullati, Latis, Maponus, Mars Thincsus, Mars Cocidius, Mater, Tres Matres, Matres Domesticae, Ratis, Sattada, Vitiris, Hueteris, Veteres, the Vitires), (4) portraiture (Commodus bronze statuette), (5) funerary monuments (all gravestones), (6) building records (dedication slabs, building stones, both often with relief decoration), (7) altars to unknown deities, (8) unidentified anthropomorphic figures, (9) animals (sea-monsters, horse, bird, sheep, quadruped, eagle, deer, boar, ox-head, bull, canine, Capricorn, Pegasus), (10) miscellaneous sculptures (including phallus reliefs); Part II, Carlisle: (1) Roman deities (Genius, Hercules, Mercury), (2) oriental deities (Cautes, Sol), (3) Romano-Celtic deities (Genii Cucullati, Tres Matres, Mater), (4) funerary monuments (gravestones, statue, lions, pine-cone and snake, pine-cone), (5) altars to unknown deities, (6) unidentified anthropomorphic figures, (7) animals (boar, dog, hare (?), bull), (8) miscellaneous sculptures (phallus), (9) sculptures of unknown provenance in the City Museum, Carlisle. There are indexes of deities, military units, persons, places and animals and phalli. Illustrations are acceptable (117 deserved better), and the text good, apart from an almost total lack of description of stonecarving techniques regarding each stone item-a CSIR requirement, and all the more surprisingly absent as Phillips himself has written on the subject elsewhere: these deserved brief description, and inclusion in an Index. Some highlights are pieces from Chesters (Juno Regina, 117), Housesteads (described- perhaps slightly over-enthusi- astically - in 1725 by the British antiquarian Stukeley as' deserving to be accounted the Tadmor [Palmyra] of Britain', p. xvii) and Carrawburgh with its Mithraeum; all, however provincial in style, show the rich interplay between Roman and regional culture. Westfield College, University of London MALCOLM A. R. COLLEDG E NORBERT HEGER: Die Skulpturen der Stadtgebiete von Aguntum und von Brigantium. (Corpus Signorum Imperii Romani: Osterreich, III, 4.) Pp. 69; 27 plates. Vienna: Osterreichische Akademie der Wissenschaften, 1987. 6S 630 (paper, oS 490). This is a catalogue of Roman sculpture from two separate areas in Austria, treated separately but put together in one volume because the material from each is too meagre for a book to itself. The first is the territory of the municipium of Aguntum, modern Dolsach, near Lienz, which lay in SW Noricum. The second is Brigantium, modern Bregenz, in the Vorarlberg, W. Austria- in the Roman province of Raetia. In each case a brief introduction gives the history of the district in Roman times and of its archaeological exploration, followed by a catalogue with full details of each object: where found, where now located, size, material, state of preservation, bibliography, description, with some conclusions about the nature of the piece concerned and, where possible, its date. The pieces are all more or less fragmentary. For Aguntum, 8 entries are fragments of bronze statues: hair with rays attached from a statue of Sol, bits of togate statues, a tiny piece of a third-early fourth-century portrait and of an equestrian statue. There are two fragments of stone statues and 17 fragmentary reliefs: the majority are funerary, the subjects typical of Roman Noricum. The most curious item, however, is a stele of local slate, inscribed Popaius Se[n]ator, with a roughly worked head which may (or may not) belong to it. The date and even authenticity of both have been questioned, though some authors have seen them as 0009-840X/89 $3.00 ?

For Brigantium there are 13 entries under bronzes, all of them from the area identified as the Roman forum: apart from the first item, a hand holding what may be the end of a cornucopia, the fragments are very sma,l and generally undatable. Among the stone items are an attractive relief of Epona and an altar dedicated to an undisclosed god. Brigantium does not appear to have produced funerary monuments, but there are several fragmentary reliefs of uncertain function decorated with vegetable and animal motifs. As the volume is in the Corpus Signorum series, the aim is documentary completeness rather than an analysis of the overall significance of the sculptures (which is virtually lacking) - however it is admittedly difficult to see that much could have been made of entries such as Brigantium no. 7: a bronze fragment, identified as possibly the stalk of an acorn, conceivably from the corona civica of an imperial statue. University of Edinburgh G L E N Y S D A V I E S ANNE-MARIE LEANDER TOUATI: The Great Trajanic Frieze' the Study of a Monument and of the Mechanisms of Message Transmission in Roman Art. (Acta Instituti Romani Regni Sueciae, Quarto Series, 45.) Pp. 130; 56 plates. Stockholm: distributed by Paul Astroms Forlag, 1987. Paper, Sw.kr. 350. As the title and subtitle indicate, the authoress is firm for Trajan, rather than Domitian, being the original patron; she is also set on analysing the 'codes' used here for conveying the Monument's message to the spectator. The result is a very worthy example of a dedicated, tireless and courageous study, which goes into immense detail and is well supported by enviably clear plates. There are some extremely interesting and original contributions to at least some of the relevant problems: e.g. on the dating, on the attribution of alleged fragments, on the underlying 'workshop' organisation, on the original setting (an arch at the NW end of the Forum Complex might be added to the list of possible sites), and on the masons' methods of work. On this last point, it seems to me quite plausible in the case of this monument (as opposed to the Column) to suppose that it was carved in situ: but the perfect matching at the borders of slabs (p. 114) and the drill-holes noted by Pfanner (p. 88) near the edge of a slab do not really prove the point, for such areas might always be finished off and matched up at the joins in situ even when the bulk of the carving was done upright on the bench. Nevertheless, for two main reasons (neither of them the fault of the authoress) the work can hardly be said to fulfil all the claims made for it in the 'Abstract'. In the first place, there is a double language-barrier here which clogs the understanding of the argument. It may seem churlish to complain of the English used, seeing that I could not have understood a word had the work been left in the original Swedish. But (for example)' ascertain' is not used in England with the meaning of' ensure' (pp. 27, 123) and we may have low opinions but do not (at any rate in normal conversation) refer to them as 'reductive visions' (p. 9). However, we can fairly easily make allowances for that sort of thing. But when we come across passages like ' the great extension of the Frieze... offers a unique opportunity to investigate the details' reciprocal relations - how they work together and establish the codes which constitute the only sure and palpable world of a work of art: its artistic reality' (p. 38) we recognize at once that the divisive jargon of art-historians is also at play. A certain amount of 'jargon' is of course inevitable: it is very hard to convey in ordinary words the emotions generated by works of art. But even music-critics have in some cases found acceptable means of surmounting this difficulty. At times one wonders if scholars in some other fields have even tried to reach down to the simple reader, who may well suspect on occasion that these modern analysts are being over-subtle. Such suspicions are reinforced when one reads the comments of ancient authors on works of art (e.g. Pausanias, quoted by the authoress on p. 37). If an educated man could miss so much, how about the ordinary passers-by? Learned monographs like this (much like 'State Reliefs', as stressed on p. 122) involve three parties: an author with a thesis to put across, a publisher prepared to print it, and some 'willing and able' readers. All three would surely benefit by clarity of exposition: the book would make more impact, the publisher would make more money, and the readers would make more of a crowd. Further, we should be able quite quickly to distinguish the grain from the chaff. The other main handicap is provided by the Monument itself. Its date, original position, total 0009-840X/89 $3.00 ?
