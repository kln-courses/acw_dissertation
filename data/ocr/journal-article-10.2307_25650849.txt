The 'enshrinement', or apologia, is meant to cover up the revolutionary moments in the course of history. (Walter Benjamin)1 In a clutch of recent books dealing with Picasso's inter war output, one or two gesture towards total interpret ations of the ceuvre. The latest instalment of John Richardson's A Life of Picasso, subtitled The Triumphant Years 1917-1932, continues a project - first mooted almost 50 years ago when the author knew the artist - which has moulded Picasso's popular image. Not coinci dentally Richardson has long advocated biographical criticism as the key to the meaning of the work. Volume III duly restates this position. While Richardson has claimed his project to be amethodological,2 which is to say natural, his Life nevertheless advances a hermeneu tic programme. The three volumes completed thus far represent an achievement that is - to use a term of approval frequently employed by Richardson's reviewers - monumental. But, one might ask, to which Picasso is this a monument? The Triumphant Years is readable, entertaining and, within limits, informative. What strikes me as especially limiting is its approach to the artworks. Here I want to address the tacit 'methodology', or ideology, that determines Richardson's exegesis. First Richardsonian axiom: the production is subordi nate to the genre of portraiture. Richardson's Life began as an attempt to map the artist's 'development through his portraits', focusing on Picasso's 'women'; soon he came to apprehend the entire corpus as (self-)portraiture, its anthropomorphism a persistent, often hidden imagery of the artist and his companions.3 Back in 1980, Rosalind Krauss attacked Richardson's 'art history of the proper name' for reducing the work to a roman a clef,4 but he has stuck with it, describing, for instance, the 1929 sculpture Femme au jardin as a literal 'sculp ture a clef depicting a woman with whom Picasso once ran off. Portraiture submits the visual sign to maxi mal dependency on a prior, personal referent, and Richardson's assumption throughout is that each art work conceals a biographical referent, which it is his task to reveal. This point of view is germane to the bourgeois tradi tionalism of the late teens and early 1920s, where Richardson can identify obscure sitters in naturalistic portraits, such as the old music teacher of Picasso's tra gically unhinged acolyte Georges Bemberg. Richardson is in his element amid the glamour of what Max Jacob called Picasso's 'epoque des duchesses', recounting 'social history' - his phrase for beau monde anecdotage - with an insider's insouciance. The Beaumonts, the Murphys, the Marchesa Casati, Coco Chanel, Jean Cocteau - the acid gossip flows (Cocteau gets burnt, as do Clive Bell, Andre Breton and others), and the world beyond the elite fades into insignificance. There is an impressive accumu lation of detail about Picasso's movements during the Ballets Russes years, and the book benefits from the photographic archive of his ballerina wife, Olga. (A fair few artworks are illustrated, though given the cost of Picassian picture rights it seems a waste not to give figure references in the text. On the design front, some readers might wince at the difference in format between this and the previous volumes.) The second half of the book addresses material that both invites and exceeds Richardson's approach. Biographical positivism has split Picasso's 'surrealist' imagery between Olga and his young blonde mistress Marie-Therese, and Richardson rehearses the binary. In 1986 Rosalind Krauss broached the matter with refer ence to the 'pairing of two women, one fair and one dark' in a 1926 sketchbook, flipping the normal order of priority to argue that there 'is indeed a relationship between art and life, [...] but it goes in the opposite direction from the one supposed by the naive autobiogra phical reading of Picasso. Picasso dreamed a type; and then he found her'.5 Krauss's point was that Picasso did not meet Marie-Therese till 1927, so that the production prompted the biographeme. In order to pooh-pooh this hypothesis as 'fairy-story' nonsense, Richardson traves ties it as a misidentification, chiding Krauss for falling victim to a book that misdated the lovers' first meeting to 1925. But this bad date was not published until 1988, two years after Krauss's essay, which holds to the same chronology as Richardson. Richardson's empiri cism will not admit a sign without a prior personal refer ent, to the extent that it distorts the facts, evading critique and conserving the myth of the artist as a crea tive individual antecedent to representation. To denaturalise Richardson's model of autobiography is only to allow that dimension of Picasso's practice its complexity. Krauss's 1998 essay, 'Picasso/Pastiche', argued that the interwar output deployed concealed self portraiture, and a diaristic form with encrypted and mythologised content, to simulate an authorial self that was 'something like the phenomenological subject: the individual who is fully present to himself.'6 That is to say, the transcendental signified of Picassian biograph ism might be a fiction of the work. For Krauss, the encoding of persons - specifically Marie-Therese, as in those 1927 Guitars that encipher her initials - mimes the interpretive protocol of manifest and latent content, and indeed the 'exposure' of a hidden sexual object is OXFORD ART JOURNAL 32.1 2009 157</page><page sequence="3">Reviews consistent with the modern location of truth in sexuality. Yet it must be said that identity itself often founders on Picasso's polymorphous perversity. At the beginning of Picasso: Architecture and Vertigo, Christopher Green historicises the problem of Picasso's self-fashioning by demonstrating how the artist helped to construct his own reception. Revisiting a 1993 article that anticipated Krauss's discussion of the painting-as-diary trope,7 Green links the fact that at the end of the 1920s Picasso started dating almost every item, to his collaboration with the publisher Christian Zervos on a catalogue of the ceuvre (the first volume of which appeared in 1932). To constitute an ceuvre is to constitute an author, assimilating the production to a chronological bios. Zervos was at pains to promote an image of a unified subject transcending the differences of the production. Yet as Green points out, at the same time, in his achronological hang for the 1932 Galeries Georges Petit retrospective, Picasso staged the pro duction as atelic and heterogeneous. As ever, Picasso was Janus-faced, by turns perpetuating the self-present authorial subject, and fragmenting the autos of autobiography. The question of what kind of subject is at issue here brings us to the second axiom of Richardsonian bio graphism: that meaning is located in the person of the artist. The limit of meaning in the work, the radius of reference, is the radius of proximity to the artist's person. Genital contact is primary, followed by contact with other humans, animals, and things. Like a mon arch's second body or the Lacanian Phallus (the origin of signification), the artist's person is less a biological than a metaphysical principle. The body qua humanist idea. This may be a function of Picasso's status as an Artist or Author: The author is a modem figure, a product of our society insofar as, emerging from the Middle Ages with English empiricism, French rationalism and the personal faith of the Reformation, it discovered the prestige of the individual, of, as it is more nobly put, the 'human person'. It is thus logical that in literature it should be this positivism, the epitome and culmination of capitalist ideology, which has attached the greatest importance to the 'person' of the author.8 It has been pointed out that the sub-genre of the artist's biography, in its Early Modern incarnation, idealised the body of the 'absolute artist'.9 Hence Richardson's pre cursor Vasari tells of Michelangelo's miraculously uncor rupted corpse.10 The figure of the absolute Artist looms large in Picasso's reception, even to the extent that a Christology emerges from the literature. Picasso himself made the identification more than once. The Triumphant Years ends with the artist's own words: 'I am God, I am God, I am God.' This fantasy is cognate with the ideology that underpins Richardson's project. We are dealing with an Artist analogous to Barthes's 'Author-God', exegesis of whose works might release a 'single "theological" meaning'.11 Again, the collusion Barthes outlines between the Author and bourgeois individualism corre sponds with the consumerism of the Picasso brand, whereby a mass-produced car is advertised as able to paint itself free (could there ever be a Citroen Duchamp?). Biography too is a lucrative branch of the Picasso industry. Richardson's interpretation exhibits exactly the positivism Barthes describes. And like the Author's Critic, Richardson mixes positivism with mystification. Alongside his apparent empiricism, Richardson repeat edly substitutes the 'sacred fire' of inspiration for the historicity of agency. Moreover, he imputes an actual theology to Picasso, referring to the production several times as 'Mithraic'. This association with the ancient Roman mystery religion of Mithraism goes back to a 1930 article where Georges Bataille compared the Picassian viewer with the sacrificed bull of 'Mithraic' rites.12 Bataille's archaeology was confused; the grue some taurobolium pertained to the public cult of the Magna Mater, rather than the secret rituals of Mithraism.13 The text in any case is an example of Bataille's mythological anthropology, inscribing an anti idealist operation in Picasso's painting, rather than positing a referent. The referential impulse has led scho lars wrongly to identify Mithraic iconography in the 1930 Crucifixion, on the basis of Bataille's article.14 Doubtless Picasso was interested in bull-sacrifice, and late in life referred to the notion that Mithraism was at the origin of the bullfight (a conceit in place at least by Henri de Montherlant's proto-fascist 1926 novel, Les Bestiaires).15 One might conjecture - though Richardson does not - that 'Mithraism' signified to Picasso a decontextualised, atavistic primordium of sacrificial ritual. However, in the early twentieth century, Mithraism was most closely associated with solar mono theism, as a rival and predecessor of Christianity. Given the complete absence of any intra-cult textual record, his torical Mithraism remains exceptionally obscure. Since Richardson does not elaborate, making no reference to Mithraism's historical status as Orientalist, homosocial and militaristic, or to its modern historiography, it is difficult to understand his appeals to 'Mithra' (Mithras) as anything more than appeals to myth. Content to upbraid fellow scholars with whom he dis agrees, Richardson is freer with his own tendentiousness in deducing iconographical sources on the basis of mor phological resemblance. Some claims, however, more than stretch credibility. He states as fact that the Musee Picasso's crucial 1926 Guitar assemblage con sists of 'a mopping-up cloth that Picasso had spotted on the floor while taking a bath. After cutting a round hole in the cloth, he hammered it onto a canvas from the back so that the points of the nails protrude menacingly from the front'. The unacknowledged debt is presumably to Lydia Gasman's 1981 dissertation, which must be one of the most influential unpublished PhDs (Richardson draws heavily on it throughout the 'surrealist' section of his book).16 Gasman's source for the bathroom story 158 OXFORD ART JOURNAL 32.1 2009</page><page sequence="4">Reviews was Roger Maillard's 1956 'biographical study', which is suspect not least for conflating two of the large 1926 Guitar constructions.17 Like Richardson, Gasman described the nails as 'hammered into the coarse cloth from the rear of the canvas';18 on examination, the nails are sandwiched between the canvas and the rag, which is glued to the support. Richardson also claims that the other important large Guitar construction in the Musee Picasso is 'sewn onto the canvas', when it is nailed to a panel. There is some doubt as to whether the rag Guitar should hang vertically or horizontally. Most evidence indi cates the vertical; the exhibition history is ambiguous. When, in 1955, he and Douglas Cooper asked Picasso, the artist said horizontal to Richardson and vertical to Cooper; but against the data, Richardson is adamant: 'I stand by what Picasso told me' (italics added). Contiguous with the artist's Word, the critic's person is the medium of certitude. Here is the final Richardsonian axiom: the critic's (this critic's) proximity to the artist authorises the interpretation. In old age, when he knew Richardson, Picasso tended to bolster the autobiographical Artist. Witness the state ment he gave to Roland Penrose in 1965 about the Tate Three Dancers (1925): While I was painting this picture an old friend of mine, Ramon Pichot, died, and I have always felt that it should be called 'The Death of Pichot' rather than The Three Dancers'. The tall black figure behind the dancer on the right is the presence of Pichot.1' Pichot's 'presence' is a metonym of the humanist Author; likewise, the renaming limits the meaning of the work to a single message from the life, which is at odds with the picture's Dionysian affirmation of indeterminacy. Curiously, Picasso's identification of the Pichot figure, recorded in a Tate publication, is missing from the tran scription given in Elizabeth Cowling's otherwise exemp lary edition of Penrose's notebooks and letters.20 To be sure, Visiting Picasso is an important addition to the historiography, opening up the Penrose archive at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art to academics and amateurs the world over. A scholarly apparatus frames a resource full of telling asides and snippets of conversation jotted down by Picasso's first English biographer-friend. Cowling's lucid commentary weaves the material into a moving 'biography of a friendship'; a double or meta-biography in which firsthand immediacy and objective, sympathetic retrospect intertwine in a narrative of rare honesty and insight. Picasso scholarship has sometimes been hindered by an uncritical willingness to project backwards from the artist's later statements without due regard for the context of the utterance. Take, for example, Picasso's oft-cited 1955 remark that surrealism had no influence on his work, apart from in 1933, 'at the moment when the serious mari tal problems began which would soon lead to his separ ation from Olga'.21 For Picasso to foreswear surrealism in 1955 - on the occasion of a monographic retrospective - was to disavow a movement to which he had once been close, but from which he was now divided by Cold War poli tics distinct from those of the interwar years. He would admit only a single moment of influence - and immediately reaffirmed his author-ity with an autobiographeme. Richardson is openly hostile to surrealism, disparaging the writers en masse as 'poetasters', and Breton in par ticular as a tyrannical 'weirdo'. To absolve Picasso from the surrealist association, he summons the arche of 'sur-realisme', the neologism Apollinaire applied in 1917 to Parade, his play Les Mamelles de Tiresias, and even a general notion of modernism or TEsprit Nouveau'. Picasso's continuity with this Ur-sur-realism supposedly detaches him from 'the word "surrealist"'. Terminological anxiety is also evident in Anne Baldassari's essay, 'The Sur-realist Picasso', which likewise looks to the genesis of the term sur-realisme (which Picasso once claimed to have invented) in the discourse around Parade (she gives the ballet a founding role in the formation of Picasso's 'sur-realist' mode). Apollinaire's remark that 'sur-realism' reconciled contra dictions resonates with Breton's later formulations of Picasso's art, but amid all this concern with lexical own ership it is important to remember that Apollinaire was no theorist - and neither was Picasso. We should be careful not to hypostatise a labile metalanguage over its objects. If we are to reiterate the dogma of Picasso as cause, it might be more productive to focus on what sur realism took from cubism. Peter Read's Picasso and Apollinaire: The Persistence of Memory (a revised translation of his 1995 study, Picasso et Apollinaire. Les Metamorphoses de la memoire) concludes by stating how 'fully [Picasso] sub scribed to Apollinaire's original conception of the term Surrealism'. Read is an astute commentator in command of his material; the publication of an English version of what was already a standard work is cause for celebra tion. Expertly splicing art and literary history, he attends to the pre-war dialogue between Apollinaire's texts and Picasso's images with subtlety and comprehensiveness. The 1918 death of the painter's most cherished friend is only the beginning of the story, cogently related by Read, of Picasso's commission to design a memorial for Apollinaire's tomb in Pere Lachaise. Though never realised, the monument project provoked radical shifts in Picasso's sculptural thinking which, in the post-war con flict over Apollinaire's legacy, traversed surrealist territory. Picasso's connection with surrealism has always been tricky to negotiate, not least since he occupied a para doxical position of transgressive seniority, straddling the pre- and post-war avant-gardes. Breton, with his liking for genealogy, gave Picasso's cubism a founding role in surrealist painting comparable with that of Lautreamont in writing; but Picasso was a living ancestor, subverting his own recent commodification, disseminating a newly violent and desirous output through surrealist channels OXFORD ART JOURNAL 32.1 2009 159</page><page sequence="5">Reviews of publication and exhibition. Read rehearses the argu ment that Picasso was too real for surrealism, quoting his later statement that 'I seek always to observe nature. I cling to resemblance, to a deeper resemblance, more real than the re,al, attaining the surreal. That's how I understood surrealism, but the word was used in a completely different way'. Defining surrealism as the 'free expression of the subconscious and dreams', Read distances Picasso from automatism because he made preparatory sketches. It must be said that he did not always - witness The Three Dancers - and of course other painters in the surrealist milieu, Miro, for example, made preparatory drawings. Read sidesteps the problem nicely with an apothegm: 'Picasso's art is to Surrealism what war is to politics: its continuation by other means'. Either way, the distinction is unstable. A unique definition or essence of surrealism is as elusive as one of Picasso. For one thing, surrealism was continually redescribing itself. Breton himself pre-echoed Picasso when he called surrealism 'a will to deepen the real, to develop in an ever clearer and more passionate way, a consciousness of the tangible world'.22 Picasso compul sively (dis)figured the (primarily feminine) body, but it was a body reticulated by anti-classicism, infantilism, eroticism; a surrealist body, in the purview of psychoana lysis. Myth and magic were also zones of imbrication; but for Breton the crucial intersection was dialectical, in that he understood both Picasso and surrealism to sublate contradiction. If you had to choose a presiding motif for surrealism, you could do worse than contradiction. The same goes for Picasso, but, with the exception of David Lomas's The Haunted Self, postmodern Anglophone revisions of surrealism have marginalised or repressed his practice.23 There is little mention of the artist in Hal Foster's Compulsive Beauty or Steven Harris's Surrealist Art and Thought in the 1930s;24 Rosalind Krauss's enlistment of the Bataillean ('dissident surrealist') anti-concept of the informe sidelined Picasso and excluded his painting altogether.25 The past decade has seen some progress. Exhibitions about surrealism have incorporated Picasso (the Tate's Desire Unbound, the Pompidou's La Revolution Surrealiste, in the context of Documents the Hayward's Undercover Surrealism); Picasso scholars (Elizabeth Cowling, Lisa Florman) have addressed the 'surrealist' phase.26 Anne Baldassari's 2005 show at the Fondation Beyeler, 'Picasso Surrealiste', generated the luxuriously illustrated (if dodgily translated) book, The Surrealist Picasso, augmenting Baldassari's high spirited catalogue essays with excellent pieces by Etienne-Alain Hubert on the surrealist prosody of Picasso, and Jacqueline Chenieux-Gendron on Picasso's place in surrealist magazines. Until the late 1930s Picasso was politically uncom mitted. He did not sign the surrealists' collective declarations. But he published in their magazines, exhib ited in their shows, and befriended them. In any case, surrealism was less monolith than assemblage, in its sociality as much as its production. Breton came to lead the group from the Right Bank, but there were break aways, not least around the Left Bank studios of Miro and Masson, where jazz, Nietzsche and Dostoyevsky, infra dig to Breton, were the (dis)order of the day. This faction, which included Georges Bataille and Picasso's friend Michel Leiris, would hive off towards Documents after the split of 1929. It is disappointing that Richardson provides no new data in this area. Documents' offices were on Picasso's street, but there is no mention in The Triumphant Years of Kahnweiler's friend Carl Einstein. Richardson accounts for the lacuna of a documented relationship between Picasso and Bataille at that time by speculating unverifiably that the artist suffered from a 'superstitious fear' of the writer. A reading of Bataille informs the dialogues Christopher Green develops between Picasso's production and var ious interlocutors (Zervos, Leiris, Henri Rousseau, Braque, Lipchitz, Miro) in Picasso: Architecture and Vertigo. Green builds contexts expertly; the chapter on Picasso and the ethnography of magic alone would ensure the book's usefulness for decades to come. But further, Green seeks to construct a thematics pertinent to all of Picasso's work 'from at least the Demoiselles in 1907'. Antithesis - Apollo/Dionysus, Beauty/The Monster, Eros/'Thanatos', Europe/Africa, Classicism/ Cubism etc. - is the central trope of the Picasso litera ture. Green proposes a variant: 'architecture' versus 'ver tigo'. To an extent the new antithesis, which Green describes as an 'opposition', 'binary', 'confrontational relationship' or 'oscillation', organises its precedents. In effect Green installs a lopsided table of opposites in which the master terms govern two columns of ana logues. With 'architecture' go law, civilisation, classi cism, Eros, structure, form; while 'vertigo' oversees transgression, eroticism, ecstasy, the sacred, magic, monstrosity, sub-Saharan Africa, the death drive, 'disrup tion of structure' and the informe. While the 'architec tural' chain of analogy is conceivably consistent, the terms of the 'vertiginous' are less so. Green calls his scheme 'Bataillean', after Bataille's 1929 Documents 'Dictionnaire critique' entry 'Architecture' (supplemented by Denis Hollier's classic study, Against Architecture), and a notion of the 'vertiginous' drawn partly from the much later text Eroticism (1957), and loosely from the postmodern informe. In fact Green could have gone straight to Bataille circa 1930 for a comparable vocabu lary, in the 'polarised human impulses' of 'appropriation' (or 'homogeneity') and 'excretion' (or 'heterogeneity'). Located somewhere between use-value and affect, Green's 'vertigo' set recalls the ragbag of depenses sig nalled by excretion and heterogeneity (forerunners of 'general economy').27 Yet Green demurs from detailed elaboration. He does not survey Bataille's usage of the noun vertige (vis-a-vis the abyss, for instance), or pursue the specificity of Picassian painting in the Bataillean text. 'In this book,' he writes, 'vertigo can be many things' (though never 160 OXFORD ART JOURNAL 32.1 2009</page><page sequence="6">Reviews the vernacular Hitchcockian kind, with its suggestive conjunction of desire and fall), and the play of transposi tions serves in part to keep Bataille's writing at a dis tance. Unlike excretion, vertigo, which is emphatically a 'metaphor', defers scatology; but already, at the outset, to inaugurate the rule of metaphor, the law of equival ence, over performatives such as transgression or informe, is not only to confuse function with theme, but to assimilate or homogenise the unassimilable or heterogeneous. That said, this is not a systematic theorisation. Notwithstanding his disclaimers about both terms being affirmative, Green locates 'vertigo' in an opposition that grants 'architecture' ontological priority: 'there can be first architecture, then vertigo'; 'vertigo is created by architecture'. At the same time, the informe 'is not simply an equivalent of the vertiginous, but that which creates the conditions for such an experience'. The polemical thrust of Green's rhetoric is indeed on the side of 'architecture', against what he sees as the pernicious 'non-aligned cultural neo-liberalism of our current intelli gentsias', exemplified by the Kraussian informe. For Green the latter 'requires the comprehensive demolition of "architecture"; requires its total negation within an oppositional relationship that is not strictly dialectical, but rather opposes the two and refuses synthetic resol ution'. But the undecidability of the informe is not pro duced by an opposition between form and informe. The \nforme cannot be held within any opposition, since it is precisely the function of informe to undo bivalence - as in the 'textbook case' of the ambivalent 'alteration' of sexual positionalities in Giacometti's Suspended Ball.28 Krauss tried to think the informe 'not as the opposite of form but as a possibility working at the heart of form'.29 Although Green's attack on postmodern relativism might suggest otherwise, the 'oscillation' he posits as the condition of interchange between 'architecture' and 'vertigo' mimes the aporetic movement of the informe, resisting the 'synthesis' of the (caricatural) Hegelian Aufhebung. The relationship of this oscillation to vertigo, transgression and informe, which in themselves perform movements of spinning, crossing and undifferentiating, is not readily apparent. Green's thematics poses as a dia lectics, in that it pretends to opposition (although the diffuseness of the thematic sets renders their bivalence questionable) and then, in the place of contradiction, pri vileges a third term of 'oscillation'. In order to avoid sub lation, Green wants to think architecture and vertigo 'non-dialectically as affirmations that do not negate each other' - this despite his characterisation of 'vertigo' as 'disintegration', 'loss of self and so on. Green does not acknowledge it - it seems to enter his language doubly mediated through the secondary literature on Bataille (primarily Georges Didi-Huberman)30 - but there is a Nietzschean echo here. Green does not work through the tension between dialectics and the affirmation of differ ence that marks his text; a tension that also marked the internal divisions of the avant-garde in interwar Paris. Apparently TJ. Clark's 2009 Mellon Lectures about Picasso's interwar production have taken The Genealogy of Morals as their key text. Might Picasso studies at last be saying Yes to Nietzsche?
