<plain_text><page sequence="1">Creepy-crawlies: Gilman's The Yellow Wallpaper and Kafka's The Metamorphosis During her lifetime, the feminist writings and novels of Charlotte Perkins Gilman ( 1 860- 1 935 ) were well-known, but her early novella, The Yellow Wallpaper (1892), was seen simply as the chilling record of a personal experience of mental breakdown and only in the 1 970s took on the status of a feminist classic. It is a first-person narrative by a woman with a young baby, who is living with her doctor husband and his sister on a short-lease in a crumbling colonial mansion. Her low spirits are intensified by her husband's insistence that she should do no work, especially not writing, but spend her time resting in a room at the top of the house, an old nursery with barred windows and horrid yellow wallpaper. The wife gradually comes to perceive the figure of a woman crawling behind the pattern in the wallpaper and shaking it as if trying to get out. In the last section, the woman in the wallpaper has emerged and crawls over the recumbent body of the husband who has fainted on finding his wife crawling around the room. For convenience, I shall refer to the narrator in her double aspect as either the Wife or the Wallpaper-Woman. The Metamorphosis ( 1 9 1 2) by Franz Kafka (1883-1924) tells the story of the travelling salesman, Gregor Samsa, who woke up one morning to find himself transformed into a huge insect and then, unredeemed by his family, gradually starved to death. It has often been read in biographical terms, but rarely dismissed simply as an expression of personal neurosis - the American critic Edmund Wilson is a notable exception.1 There is no question of any influence of Gilman on Kafka, though there may be indirect connections through their reading of European literature. Dostoyevsky's insect metaphors and doubles or alter egos (a common topos from the Romantics onwards) are a possible link and there is a room with horrible yellow wallpaper in Crime and Punishment ? Kafka certainly knew Keller's Die drei gerechten Kammacher with its painted-over hibernating insect which starts to crawl in the Spring, though Gilman cannot have. My choice of texts is determined not by influence, however, but by the common motifs of enclosure in a room and doubles, by the leading metaphor of crawling, and by the echoes of Gothic horror and the Märchen as genres within the wider category of the fantastic. I shall Paragraph Volume 13 © Oxford University Press 1990</page><page sequence="2">20 Paragraph examine these features as ways of representing subjectivity and sexuality, then discuss the mode of narration and elements of irony and humour in the two texts, which despite their different provenance display symptoms suggesting intertextual connections of a socio-cultural nature. The paper is a postlude to Gilbert and Gubar's study of nineteenth-century fiction by women, The Madwoman in the Attic , and examines what happens when the attic has become the bedroom of a petty-bourgeois man in the early twentieth century. A room of one's own The Wife and Samsa are both confined in rooms which shift in meaning within each text and have comparable and contrasting values as between the texts. Initially, the Wife's room has lurid associations with its barred windows and metal rings in the wall, and the stairs, the only means of escape, are blocked off by a gate. At the top of the house, the room confines the notorious madwoman in her attic. It is, however, also a nursery: the bars and gate suggest protection; the rings are perhaps the remnants of some apparatus for children's games. The nursery encloses, however, not a child protected by parents, but a Wife/Mother imprisoned by a Husband/Father. Metonymically, the prison/nursery conveys the imprisonment of women in the social roles of wife and mother, the infantilization of women in bourgeois ideology, and patriarchal power asserted by means stretching from sadistic violence through to psychiatric medicine. A historical shift in the surface form of power is fleetingly suggested: an educated, middle-class family move into a crumbling colonial mansion and an older patriarchy of material powers and brute strength gives way to mental torture disguised as medical expertise and loving care which the Wallpaper-Woman eventually sees through: 'as if I couldn't see through him' (32).3 As a psychic metaphor, the attic room and its inhabitant suggest a woman's body imprisoned in a subjectivity moulded by oppressive social conditioning. The metaphoric value of the room shifts, however, towards the end: the Wife's prison is metamor- phosed into the domain of the Wallpaper-Woman who marks her territory by the smooch on the paper and signals her power by crawling over the husband's body. The room has changed from a prison into a narrating I's room of her own, sealed off from a hostile environment, where she can represent her self in writing. It is unclear, however, what the status of that self is, whether a true essential self, or an unstable changing subjectivity, always still shaped by social relations, but about which truth can be told. Samsa's room shifts from being a room of his own to become a prison. In contrast to the Wife in the nineteenth century, confined in the private</page><page sequence="3">Creepy-crawlies 21 sphere of middle-class femininity, denied social intercourse and work, in the early twentieth century Samsa seeks relief from the burdens of petty- bourgeois masculinity: the room is his refuge from oppressive work in a ruthless public sphere. It is his room in a way the Wife's is not, for he chose the apartment on behalf of his family, he pays the bills, and he locks his door at night, a habit picked up from his travels as a salesman. The Wife is not allowed to lock her door, though the Wallpaper-Woman does and so asserts her privacy as a subject whose body and psyche are no longer open to penetration. On ceasing to pay the bills, however, Samsa immediately loses the power to lock his door and after the agonizing struggle to unlock it on the first morning, his room thereafter is open to endless penetrations. Nevertheless, the transformation does liberate him from a hateful job and sends the chief clerk, come to fetch him to work, screaming down the stairs, a victory comparable to the Wallpaper-Woman's triumph over the recumbent husband. But Samsa's victory comes early on, not as a triumphant close, for The Metamorphosis starts where The Yellow Wallpaper leaves off and goes on to explore the domain won through transformation. Samsa associates freedom from the timetable of work with femininity, comparing men who can afford to linger over their meals with harem women: the transformation marks if not feminization, then demasculation. The Wife is such a harem woman with nothing to do but eat and lie around, a blissful prospect for a travelling salesman, and at first Samsa almost enjoys his confinement as his sister brings him tempting morsels, though not harem sweetmeats but rotting food for an insect. Eventually, however, he loses his appetite, as, no doubt, do harem women surfeited with sweetness and indolence. Samsa explores his domain, crawling up the walls and across the ceiling to mark his territory and at first is glad that the furniture is to be removed to leave more space for wandering. Still attached to his humanity, however, he changes his mind and tries to stop the full transformation of the human-room ('Menschen- zimmer', 56) into an insect domain.4 But the family exclude him from human community; he must eat alone in his room and eventually loses his appetite even for insect food. Having lost his social identification as a man, son, brother and breadwinner, he starves to death in a limbo. The limbo is not empty, however, for his room is by the end cluttered with old bits of furniture discarded by the family as he too is discarded and finally disposed of by the charlady as a piece of rubbish. And perhaps Samsa's room was never a room of his own, for it was in the double privacy of a bed in a bedroom at the heart of the private realm where bourgeois man seeks recuperation from alienating work that, after a night of troubled dreams, the transformation occurred. The division between the public and the</page><page sequence="4">22 Paragraph private spheres is illusory: as a psychic metaphor, the room suggests a subjectivity vulnerable to social penetration, and as with the wallpaper double, the status of the insect double is unclear: is it Samsa's true self which emerges in resistance to his social subjection or is it simply the revelation of his subjection which culminates as he miserably succumbs under the continuing thrusts of that penetration? So far I have argued that the room as social metonym and psychic metaphor conveys how material circumstances and social relations contribute to shaping the characters' subjectivity. Gilman, a woman writing before full legal, political and economic emancipation, conveys the imprisonment of a woman in the domestic sphere; Kafka, a man writing in an age dominated by ruthless early capitalism and by imperialist, racialist and patriarchal ideology, explores the sufferings of a man who fails to be manly. The shifting meanings of the rooms reflect the different positions: initially, the room means exclusion from work and society in Gilman's story, refuge from work and society in Kafka's. Ultimately, it means a kind of liberation in Gilman's story, but deadly isolation in Kafka's, an outcome foreshadowed, however, in the deeply ambiguous close of The Yellow Wallpaper , whose mad inhabitant will surely be immured as completely as the insect. Both texts suggest, then, that subjective transformation in a private domain is not enough; the self cannot be walled off without going mad or dying, yet accommodation with society produces the pressures which culminate in madness or death. Nonetheless, The Yellow Wallpaper is a less pessimistic text than The Metamorphosis as I shall argue later when considering the narrative mode of the two stories. At this point, however, I want to turn to gender and the motif of creeping or crawling. Creeps and crawlers The texts convey the differential impact on a woman and a man of the sexual division of labour under capitalism: the middle-class woman suffers through exclusion from work; the would-be upwardly mobile, petty-bourgeois man through an excess of work. In Gilman's text, society means the male-dominated institutions of marriage, medicine, finance and actual husbands, doctors and formal patriarchal laws. In Kafka's text, it means competitive capitalism and the patriarch who lives on in the mind, even as formal father-power was crumbling (though the father retains a literal meaning here which diminishes in Kafka's later work). In both texts, then, the social powers are gendered as masculine, reflecting actual male dominance in society. The texts are written from different positions, however, and the rooms have different sexual meanings. In Gilman, the room is the scene of a denial of idealized motherhood and passive</page><page sequence="5">Creepy-crawlies 23 femininity as the Wallpaper-Woman transforms the nursery/prison into a room of her own and rejects the desires of the Husband. In Kafka, it is a refuge from masculinity, but it cuts off the insect from fatherhood and from access to the object of desire. Comparison of the two stories suggests that while some aspects of gender are flexible and in particular that femininity can change, masculinity is more intractable and sexuality is least susceptible of being affected by the material changes which have transformed so many aspects of relations between the sexes. Both texts represent changing subjectivity in terms of doubles. In The Yellow Wallpaper there is a gradual shift of focus from the Wife to the Wallpaper- Woman marked by a change also of evaluation. The descrip- tions of the wallpaper combine images of movement, geometrical horizontals, diagonals and verticals, less ordered curvings of the pattern, anthropomorphic figures and parts of bodies, a few other likenesses such as seaweed, colour, touch and smell, aesthetic and emotive epithets and a gradually emerging order of a top pattern of imprisoning bars and a sub- pattern of a crawling woman. The Wife at first sees a pointless pattern which she wants to follow to some conclusion; she wants to find some common centre amidst the seemingly random diagonals and horizontals created by the sections of paper, and gradually she does discover coherent images by seeing the paper on two levels of surface imprisoning pattern and underlying female figure. Overall, then, the movement suggests a revelation of something hidden underneath an imprisoning surface. Initially the emotive words the Wife uses of the wallpaper suggest horror and disgust, but later she comes to like watching the paper. Since the image that finally emerges is that of a crawling female body, the earlier descriptions and epithets can be read as ways of seeing and feeling about the female body which appears as a site of conflicting meanings. The metamorphosis of the Wife into the Wallpaper-Woman is the outcome of a battle over the body and its meanings. A Wife/Mother is confined in a nursery; there are separate beds; the husband seems to have a separate room and he constantly addresses the Wife as if she were a child. These details suggests the Wife as a virginal, desexualized girl detached from the sexual and maternal body. As a Mother too the narrator is treated as a delicate, innocent virgin-mother detached from the bodily processes and the sheer hard work of mothering. Such a femininity was a cult of the affluent middle classes and is reminiscent too of the cult of the pre- adolescent body in the art nouveau or Jugendstil fashion of the 1890s. The shapes in the wallpaper are the adult female body as it might appear to a shameful young virgin: full of 'lame, uncertain curves', 'sprawling', 'flamboyant', 'florid arabesques', 'unheard of contradictions', 'lurid',</page><page sequence="6">24 Paragraph 'unclean', 'sickly', 'waddling columns of fatuity', 'wallowing', a nauseat- ing smell. Dehumanization is suggested in the crawling on all fours, in the filthy smooch like a slug marking its passage, and in the vegetable images of seaweeds and toadstools. In a Lacanian reading, Mary Jacobus takes the emergence of the Wallpaper-Woman as an uncanny literal metaphor of the absence that is repressed in the order of language; the absent repressed here assumes the figure of the castrated female body so that the censor, Doctor John, 'catches the text, as it were, in flagrante delicto '.s I see the repression not as a universal aspect of phallogocentric language, but as a historically specific alienation from the mature female body produced by the bourgeois construct of an innocent, childish and asexual femininity. The emergence of the Wallpaper-Woman is a defiant assertion of that body by way of reverse discourse, as Jean Kennard suggests in a reading which does more justice to the element of triumph at the close than Elaine Hedges who sees only total defeat. Yet as both Hedges and, in a similar reading, Annette Kolodny admit, liberation from the sanity of the Wife into the insanity of the Wallpaper-Woman may subvert but does not overthrow the patriarchal meanings.6 Kafka's insect too has many nauseating features with undertones suggestive of a disgusting feminization. When Gregor wakes up, he is lying on his back with his many little legs in the air, and his great swelling tummy is almost exposed in its vulnerability as the bed-clothes are slipping off. An animal on its back is in the position of surrender which, seen anthropomorphically, is also the female position. In all the highly detailed description of the body, there is no mention of the normally obtrusive male organ. Indeed because of the tummy, Gregor cannot see the lower part of his body, though it seems peculiarly sensitive to pain when he inadvert- ently knocks it against the foot of the bed, suggesting an already existing wound or raw surface. Instead of a penis, he has feelers emerging from his head, a ludicrous image of the impotence of the mental as compared with the seat of phallic power, and instead of the white engendering fluid of the Father he emits a disgusting brown fluid from his mouth, a hermetic reference perhaps to words as diarrhoea and to Kafka's sense of literature as a sickness cutting him off from full manhood. Like the smooch in The Yellow Wallpaper, the insect here leaves a trail of slime suggesting his slimy creepiness (the metaphors work in German as in English). When the patriarch-father bombards him with apples, his body is penetrated like a woman's, but from behind through his armour-like back, a masculine image ambiguous between aggression and defence. Demasculated, he is a monster who is neither woman nor man. To Samsa his humanity seems to be co-extensive with his sexuality and the loss of manhood is the loss of</page><page sequence="7">Creepy-crawlies 25 humanity. Hanging in his room is a picture cut out from a magazine which he has put in a gilded frame. First mentioned prominently as early as the second paragraph, it shows a woman in a fur hat and wrap and holding up a fur muff, evocative of the furry animality of the female sexual organ, like the fur coverings of the heroine in the Grimms' Märchen, Many-Pelts. When his mother and sister start to clear out the human furniture, rather than his desk or the fretwork tool-cupboard - symbols of intellect and creativity - it is the picture of the furry woman he clings to, spreading his insect body over it. The Wallpaper-Woman throws off the Wife's sexual subjection: her crawling over the husband is not desire to reverse the missionary position, for she does not linger but crawls on over; rather it is an anti-erotic act. While the insect plastered over the furry woman is as anti-erotic in effect (though which is the greater turn-off may depend on the reader's sex), it expresses the insect's own desire, whereas the Wallpaper-Woman's crawling expresses rejection of another's desire. Thus, where the woman thirsts for work and finds freedom in her room from sexual demands, the man escapes work, but suffers frustration of sexual needs; in escaping the social duties he loses the sexual rights of masculinity. Gregor's disgust at his own body can be associated with his divided feelings for women: on the one hand animalesque desire for the animalesque female which he defends against the mother and sister who come to take it away; on the other hand love for his mother and idealization of his sister, the taboo, asexual women of the household towards whom Gregor has hitherto played the role of chivalrous protector. He has projected on the sister his own ideals of creativity and spirituality. When she plays the violin he is drawn to her, like the animals tamed by Orpheus, and might be humanized, like the frog prince humanized by the pure love of a virgin. But his incestuous desire for the taboo sister and his lust not for the spirit but for the furry body are too disgusting to be redeemed: he would pollute the sister. Ironically, the sister is only too ready to escape from the idealized feminine role. However ideal the vocation the brother has in mind, it is his vocation for her, and she chooses instead to train as a shorthand-typist and earn a wage rather than remain in tutelage to her brother. She throws off too the caring feminine role of servant/nurse to her afflicted brother and in the closing words of the story stretches her young body. But her typical service-job as typist and the parents' hope of finding her a good husband are sinister signs that economic equality and liberated female sexuality have not yet arrived. Nonetheless, these signs of change in women's role are a factor in Gregor's demasculation: as the sister strengthens, the brother weakens. The Wife's crisis of femininity and Gregor's crisis of masculinity have</page><page sequence="8">26 Paragraph common roots in the contradictory construction of woman by bourgeois patriarchy. On the one hand there is the virginal woman enclosed in the household, to be protected by the chivalrous man or idealized as the Utopian redeemer who will save man from alienation and self-division between animal and spirit. On the other, there is the animalesque sexual woman and the messy business of child-birth, menstruation and lactation which nineteenth-century medicine pathologized. Infantilization and idealization necessarily stigmatize the mature sexual or maternal body, alienating women from their own bodies, and making the mature body frightening also to men; male sexuality becomes either an ever repeated rape of innocence or a shameful lust for something disgusting. From the late nineteenth century through to the First World War, this division appears in the motif of the Wife/Mother versus the Whore and the crude preference by radical male intellectuals for the Whore over the Mother. Gilman's and Kafka's texts deserve their classic status in probing deeper to uncover the effects on the Wife and on the male psyche of the contradic- tions in bourgeois sexual ideology. Comparison of the two texts suggests, however, that the masculine social role and heterosexual desire in both sexes will remain deeply problematic despite the recognition in both texts of the roots of the problem in patriarchy. The Wallpaper-Woman crawls on over the Husband, but crawling remains intractably an image of powerlessness; the most Utopian image is of a woman in the open country creeping as fast as the shadow of a cloud in a high wind, but even in this image the woman is the creeping shadow, not the cloud on high. The partial psychic liberation of the Wallpaper-Woman is not followed through into upright power in the social world and to social recognition of transformed femininity. From the dominant patriarchal perspective the Wallpaper-Woman is mad and until almost the end the Wife retains that viewpoint: she will tie up the Wallpaper-Woman if she gets out (34), and even the Wallpaper-Woman feels safer tied and does not wish to leave the room (35). The final emergence is limited to crawling over the Husband inside the room (36). Thus the story subverts, but cannot convey a non- existent structural overthrow of patriarchy. Nor is there any liberation of female sexuality. The Wallpaper-Woman throws off the status of passive sexual object, but she is not a sexual subject: the closing triumph of the disgusting female body does not bring sexual fulfilment which within a heterosexual economy of desire would require transformation of men, not just of women, nor is there a lesbian sub-text, at most narcissism in the act of writing about her own body. This touches on an old dilemma in feminism. Mary Wollstonecraft was so concerned by the reduction of women to sexual objects that she urged us, in the interim, to deny</page><page sequence="9">Creepy-crawlies 27 sexuality altogether and grow more and more masculine, by which she meant rational. The Yellow Wallpaper is a step forwards in valuing the female body, but the Woman has no Other but herself through whom to find sexual joy. She does not try, as Wollstonecraft suggests, to become more rational and masculine, but rather rejects rationality as defined by patriarchy. She does not, however, escape the patriarchal categories since as a social being she is mad. Feminism must surely seek not to elevate madness but to redefine rationality and attack a culture which drives women mad. As it is, the Wallpaper-Woman's victory over the Wife is pyrrhic in risking the isolation of the subject, suggesting that there can be no simple pitting of feminism against femininity. The social meanings of gender must be renegotiated and the masculine transformed as well as the feminine. The Metamorphosis does show a transformed man, semi-feminized or at least demasculated in his loss of social status as breadwinner. But the transformed man and all the other characters still see through the normative spectacles of patriarchy: a man who is not masculine is a creep in his own eyes and in the eyes of others. After the brief illusion of freedom to crawl over walls and ceiling and the early triumph over the chief clerk, Gregor starves to death in an isolation of spirit and body with no hint of final triumph. Gilman's is the more hopeful text in a number of ways. Firstly, there is the narrator's sense that there are many creeping women, and in creeping on over she has ceased to be a creep. Gregor, by contrast, has no such feeling of potential solidarity and remains isolated as a creep incapable of resistance. Secondly, where Gregor loses his human voice, Gilman's first-person narration allows the emergent Wallpaper-Woman finally to find a voice. Early on, the written 'I' emerges against the 'we' referring to Husband and Wife: while 'we' are asleep, 'I' watches the paper (25). In the last section 'I' oscillates rapidly between the Wallpaper- Woman and the Wife, but remains a narrating-T. Such continuity suggests the possibility of transformation without total loss of identity, which here has the double aspect of a body and a written 'I' who, after the fluctuations, achieves at the very end the narrative mastery of a stable epic preterite. Gregor, by contrast, is presented by a covert, cruelly mocking narrator. Thirdly, both stories have an undertone of gruesome comedy which emerges in The Yellow Wallpaper in the question at the end: 'Now tell me, why should that man have fainted?' (36)- a question implying dialogue with a listener who shares the mentality of the Wallpaper- Woman and can enjoy her sly irony. Gregor, by contrast, cannot address a reader, since he cannot rise from his diegetic level up into the extradiegetic level of the masterly narrator: we smile with the Wallpaper-Woman; we</page><page sequence="10">28 Paragraph are forced, unwillingly perhaps, to laugh at Gregor who is quite incapable of irony. The irony here is either at the level of the third-person narrator or is authorial and, in as far as it is authorial, is deeply masochistic. Fourthly, the Wife seeks self-expression through her writing and uncovers her alter ego: writing is a therapy which liberates her from the sanity of the Wife, albeit only into madness, but for the reader there is the pleasure of a kind of victory. In The Metamorphosis Gregor projects his aspirations towards creative self-expression on to his sister who is to become a musician, though only an executive violin-player, not a composer. The most he contemplates for himself is fretwork, a safely masculine handicraft. Kafka regularly embodies artists as feminine or at least as unmanly, for example the circus girl in Up in the Gallery, Josephine the singing mouse, the child- like acrobat in First Sorrow or the puny hunger-artist. Artistic sensibility was not a masculine attribute within the petty bourgeoisie or in the nationalistic and militaristic culture of the time Kafka was writing - intellectuals, especially Jewish intellectuals, were the very antithesis of manly, hence were feminine. The Gregor of the photograph, proud in his military uniform, cannot transform masculinity through music or writing which are activities for women or unmanly creeps. In the cruel irony of the text, such subjection to patriarchal definition is yet a further sign of Gregor's insecthood. In sum, comparison of the two stories suggests that women and the feminine are more open to movement where masculinity is more intractable. Hence the social and psychological emancipation of women must involve more than a purely textual politics of feminine jouissance in writing or mere reversal of patriarchal categories to elevate irrationality. Women must intervene, as Gilman did, to fight the political battle and to contest the definitions of rationality and perhaps the crawling woman and the insect might some day make common cause and stand upright.
