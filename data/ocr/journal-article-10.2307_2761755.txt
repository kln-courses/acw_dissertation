<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOCIAL GENESIS. CONTRIBUTIONS TO SOCIAL PHILOSOPHY. X. THE word genesis, unlike telesis, is in common use in most or all modern languages, although it is employed with different meanings. Derived from the obsolete Greek verb yezv, of which the reduplicate middle form yc(volkat was the one chiefly in use by classic authors, it partakes of the radical signification of that verb, which is to become. It was probably this neuter significa- tion which led the Greeks to prefer this miiddle form, and the possession by the Greek language of such a form constitutes one of its distinctive characteristics. It is something quite distinct from the passive, and the Latin fieri poorly represents the Greek word. A passive implies an active, and this an actor. This whole idea is wanting in the Greek middle, and a form of action is recognized which is not associated with any agent intelligent or unintelligent. It recognizes one of the most important truths in nature, that there are processes which go on independent of any external conditioning being or thing, that are self-active, and although the absence of adequate causes is not implied, those causes are conceived as inherent in the objects that are regarded as active, and the phenomena are contemplated as pro- ducing themselves. The progress of science has constantly contributed to confirm the legitimacy of this conception, and its great work has consisted in the steady transfer of one field of phenomena after another from a supposed active or passive condition to this independent middle condition, rescuing them from anthropomorphic conceptions and demonstrating the self- activity of the universe. This has gone so far that today all things are looked at from the standpoint of evolution, and evo- lution is only an expression for universal genesis. Although genesis is sometimes translated creation, yet at bot- tom it is the precise opposite of creation (Iroisqo). The Latin 532</page><page sequence="2">SOCIAL GENESIS 533 language, as already said, imperfectly expressed this middle sense by various uses of the passive voice, but modern languages, developed more under the influence of scientific conceptions, have partly supplied the defect by the almost universal use of a reflective form. The Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Ger- man, and Russian languages all make extensive use of this form, and the Russian, which has many of the elements of the Greek besides its characters, resorts to this method even more than the Romance languages. The English is perhaps the poorest of all modern languages in this respect, but there are many ways in which we are able to avoid the implication of an agent in natural phenomena. We borrow largely from other tongues and possess many terms to express simple becoming. Although there is no Anglo-Saxon equivalent in use in English for the strong German word werden, still the advance in scien- tific thought towards the conception of a self-existent, self- adjusting, and self-active universe has nowhere been greater than in English-speaking countries. Progress in this direction has taken place somewhat in the order of the complexity of the phenomena considered, and the external agent conceived by Kepler was first eliminated from astronomical ideas. Somewhat later it disappeared from physi- cal and chemical conceptions, and it has now nearly abandoned the field of vital activities. It still lingers in the realm of mind, and anthropomorphic conceptions are still dominant in social thinking. There is, however, in this last department, as was seen in the eighth paper of this series, and as will be more fully shown in the eleventh, a scientific basis for the idea, in conceiving man as an intelligent agent modifying his environment. In other words, while there is no miore room in sociology than in any of the simpler sciences for a theo-teleology, there does exist an anthropo-teleology' which becomes an increasingly inmportant factor as intelligence advances. In the present paper it is proposed to ignore this factor as completely as possible, and to concentrate the attention upon z Dynamic Sociology, Vol. I, p. 29.</page><page sequence="3">534 THE AMFRICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY society as a pure becoming-as a strictly genetic product- as much so as the vegetable and animal forms on the earth's sur- face, or even as the world systems of space. Still, as society is an exclusive product of mind, the influence of mind cannot be omitted, and the only part of the psychic factor that can really be thought away is the social mind-the conscious agency of society itself intentionally modifying its own condition. Dynamic sociology is the homologue in human society of development in biology. The modus operandi is not widely dif- ferent from that of natural selection, and is, in fact, a sort of social selection. In it, however, the Lamarckian principle of individual effort is more prominent, only, as pointed out, instead of modifying to any great extent man's bodily structures, these efforts modify his environment. But the principal resemblance to which it is proposed to call attention in this paper is the common character of both processes of going on spontaneously, or without design or thought oh the part of the beings that put forth these exertions and produce the effects. This is the qual- ity which I distinguish by the term genetic, and the social prog- ress that takes place in this manner does not differ from any of the other forms of evolution, not even from inorganic evolution. For although, as in animal development, psychic forces are the chief agents, these act spontaneously and in a sense uncon- sciously. The treatment of this form of social progress I formerly denominated " passive or negative," as distinguished from "active or positive" dynamic sociology, which latter, instead of being genetic, I recognized as teleological, for which I now prefer the shorter form telic. The following is the definition which I then gave: "' Passive, or negative, progress contemplates the forces of society as operating in their natural freedom, subject only to the laws of evolution in general. Here society is regarded as passive in the sense of being sirnply acted upon by the forces that surround it and operate within it. It is conceived as neg- ative from the absence of any force extraneous to these regular</page><page sequence="4">SOCIAL GENESIS 5 3 5 natural forces operating in the direction of their limitation or modification. Such, it is believed, has been the nature of most of the progress thus far attained by society, as it is of all that which has taken place in the animal, vegetable, and inorganic kingdoms of nature." ' The concluding chapter of that volume (chap. vii) contain- ing over 250 pages, is chiefly devoted to this passive or negative aspect of social dynamics (see p. 456). In the present paper only a few of the most general principles can, of course, be treated. That work, as the name implies, was limited to this class of considerations. This was stated at the close of the volume cited: "It has therefore been the mnovement rather than the status of society, which it has been sought to explain, the causes of social phenomena and social progress rather than the condition of society itself. The status, or condition, of society is to be learned by the consideration of the indirect, or functional, effects of what have been denominated the social forces. The study of the indirect effect of the preservative forces of society would lead to an acquaintance with the nature of the objects which have been employed by man as means of subsistence-a subject only touched upon in this chapter, because, if legitimate, manifestly too large for the limits of the work. The consideration of the indirect, or functional, results of the reproductive forces would lead to a discussion of the most important of all social institu- tions, the family-a subject which has already been ably treated by many writers. Still less could we afford to attempt a survey of the wide field of aesthetic art, the deep currents of human morals, or the intellectual condition of mankind in past ages, as would be required by a consideration of the indirect effects of the non-essential forces. These indirect, or consequential, results constitute what I have called the objects of nature, for securing which the desires and passions of men have been developed by the law of natural selection. As already remarked, they have no necessary or real connection with the object ol man. which is to D Dynamic Sociohogy, Vol. I, pp. 56-57.</page><page sequence="5">536 THE AMVERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY enjoy, and the harmony between the two can only be accounted for, as stated, by adaptation."I I have quoted these passages to show how careful I was to draw the distinction clearly between static and dynamic sociology and to disclaim all pretension to having attempted to treat the former subject. I would not have done so if there had not been numerous indications that certain persons, teachers of sociology in our great universities, look upon my works as practically covering the whole of that great science. I certainly deserve no such compliment, and positive harm might result, not only to the student but to the science, from perpetuating the mistake. All I have pretended to do has been, after looking over this vast field and discovering certain neglected patches, to proceed as best I could to cultivate these, leaving the larger areas to those better equipped for their culture. But I certainly did exert myself to draw the boundary lines as carefully as possible, and to show in the most fundamental way how the statical phenomena differ from the dynamical ones. Much more stress was, of course, laid upon the essential nature of dynamic agencies in society. Starting upon the basic distinction of feeling and function, I rang all the changes that could be produced upon this fundamental antinomy. Indeed, so forcibly did it strike me that I made an exception in its favor, and departed from my otherwise fixed policy of publishing no part of my philosophy in advance of the complete work, and three years before that work appeared I read a paper on "Feeling and Function as Factors in Human Development" before the section of Anthro- pology of the American Association for the Advancement of Science at its meeting in Boston in i88o, reports of which appeared in the daily press,2 and an abstract prepared by myself was published in Science,3 in which not only was the general principle fully stated, but a classification of the social forces was given, substantially identical with that finally drawn up and published in Dynamic Sociology (Vol. I, p. 472).

This was subsequently worked out, and the passages already quoted sufficiently express the latter of these laws, which is the basis of social statics. The former or dynamic law was formulated in the introduction to the classification of the social forces,' but perhaps the clearest expression of it occurs in the treatment of the reproductive forces, in connection with which the principle comes forward with the greatest clearness, and it is stated that "the first of these classes of effects may be denominated direct or causal, the second indirect or conse- quential." 2 We see, then, that the primary characteristic of genetic social progress is that it results from the actions of men that directly flow from their efforts to satisfy their desires. It is this, too, which gives it its distinctively genetic character. Genesis is becoming, and whatever is genetically produced is the result of a vis a tergo molding it into shape by successive impacts. The impinging body is in direct and intimate contact with the one that is being molded. The change produced is gradual and the process- is one of development or evolution. Social progress is in this respect analogous to organic progress, or even to cosmic progress. It is never sudden or rapid. It does not take place by leaps or strides. Increment after increment is slowly added to social as to animal structures, and in the course of ages habits, customs, laws, and institutions are changed, or abolished and replaced by others. As the object of all these activities is always the fuller satisfaction of desire, and as such satisfaction results in self-preservation and race continuance, the effect in the long run, under the ever-present law of selection, is to pro- duce superior races. This effect, however, is biologic, or rather ethnologic. The sociologic effect is to adapt the environment, i. e., to improve the conditions of existence. This is social I .Dynamic Sociology, Vol. 1, p. 469. 2 Ibid., p. 603.</page><page sequence="7">538 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY progress, but, like organic progress, it may and does result in the extinction of deficient and the preservation of efficient races and institutions. Reverting to the figurative expression employed in the fifth paper, we may now perceive that just as the origin of feeling, except as a condition to function, was a matter of entire indif- ference to Nature, so this social progress, like organic devel- opment, is equally immaterial from the standpoint of Nature's purposes, and only useful in so far as it incidentally com- passes the furtherance of those purposes. In other words, just as Nature does not care whether desire is satisfied or not, so long as life is preserved and perpetuated, so she in like manner has no concern for this social progress in and for itself, but only in so far as it becomes a means to her ends. Still more broadly put, it is no part of the scheme of Nature to bring about change, but only to secure growth and multiplica- tion. Everything else is extra-normal and unintended. It certainly seems a startling proposition that social progress forms no part of the scheme of Nature, but it is true in this sense, and civilization itself belongs to the class of extra-normal products. This would of course be a futile speculation but for the important practical truth that flows from it as a corollary. This is that man is living under a new dispensation. He has cut loose from his natural moorings and is afloat upon a great sea. He has started on a voyage in search of an El Dorado. He left the mother country against the protestations of his country- men, and now he must, like a real hero, discover the rich land of his dreams or else he must ignominiously perish. He is too far out now on this great voyage of discovery to turn back, and therefore he can only go forward. He is therefore pushing on, and already the dim outline of the distant land is looming upon the horizon. To drop the figure, this blind genetic progress which has, without man's knowledge or solicitude, wrought out the civiliza- tion that we have, has nearly reached the point at which society itself will awake to collective consciousness and usher in an era</page><page sequence="8">SOCIAL GENESIS 539 of telic progress, the end and nature of which cannot now be forecast. But its object cannot be other than that which the individual man has always pursued, viz., that of turning to higher and higher use the capacity to enjoy with which Nature unwit- tingly, and for her own totally different purposes, originally endowed him. Genetic progress, the blind, unconscious working of the social forces making for human perfectionment in the collective state, is what is generally understood by social evolution. Every stage of ethnic culture, from savagery to enlightenment, is a product of this genetic, unconscious social evolution. For most writers on social science this is the only kind of social prog- ress recognized. Long before sociology was named there were many such writers. With the habits of abstract reasoning which all that passed for philosophy had encouraged, it was the prac- tice of such writers to make use of the few facts that their edu- cation, observation, and experience had given them to work out by logical deduction from these facts the most general laws that they were capable of formulating. Much of this reasoning was sound, nearly all of it was logical, i. e., did not violate the canons of logic, and many of the conclusions reached were correct, but so narrow was the induction, and so many and important were the unknown or neglected premises that the general fabric of their philosophy was worthless. Such was the greater part of the so-called political economy which the present age has inherited from the age that went before it. Most of the pre- Comtean sociology comes under this head. A few publicists, like Montesquieu, wrote rather from the standpoint of jurispru- dence. Hobbes was the panegyrist of political power, and Mal- thus, although really following the same lines as Adam Smith and Ricardo, put his work into the form of a sort of philosophy. All this, as well as the French physiocracy that preceded it and largely inspired it, had the merit at least of regarding soci- ety as a domain of law, and its chief defect was in failing to rec- ognize a sufficient number of factors and in omitting some of the most effective ones, as we shall see in the next paper. These</page><page sequence="9">540 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY men saw in human society a theater of wide general activity which proceeds from the inherent nature of man. They per- ceived that if men were left quite to themselves they would, in seeking their personal ends, spontaneously initiate and carry on all the industries of society. Owing to the manifest abuses of power by the ruling classes in seeking to raise revenues for their own uses, conquer other nations for their own glory, and other- wise satisfy their own greed and ambition, whereby the free flow of these natural activities was checked, industry and commerce were stifled or misdirected, and the general prosperity was inter- fered with and diminished, they felt called upon to counteract these tendencies and advocate the liberation of the natural forces of society. In taking this course at such a time they accom- plished a worthy purpose and inaugurated a wholesome reform. No one denies that the unrestrained activities of the human race would work out some sort of social development. The analogy with organic evolution in the subhuman sphere is also a true one. Though qualified in its details by the differences between men and animals, even by the immense difference between the human mind and the animal mind, with a corre- sponding difference in the results, the principle according to which these results are accomplished is essentially the same. Those reformers who maintain that the monopolistic tendencies so prevalent in society under the apparent absence of external restraint or collective influence are peculiar to human affairs, and wanting in the lower domains of life and mind, simply betray their lack of acquaintance with those domains. In fact, the fundamental condition to biological development is monopoly. Natural selection operates on this principle exclusively. What is called the survival of the fittest is simply the monopoly of the strongest. It does not work here either in the mild manner characteristic of human society, viz., that of allowing the weaker to exist, only under conditions of reduced activity and stunted growth, but it is thoroughgoing and crushes out the unsuccessful competitors completely. It is only paralleled in human society in those rare cases where a superior race overflows the domain</page><page sequence="10">SOCIAL GENESIS 54I of an inferior one and utterly eradicates it- does not enslave it and allow it to lead a life of subjugation, much less, as is the more frequent case, partially commingle with it and ultimately absorb it, but destroys it root and branch so that it utterly ceases to exist. This is the method of nature in the animal and vegetable kingdoms, and thus is organic evolution brought about. At least such is the tendency and frequent result, but of course the competitors are often so nearly balanced in this monopolistic power that they coexist for long periods or indefinitely. The expressions natural selection and survival of the fittest give only the positive side of this general law. There is a nega- tive side which brings out the nature of the law even more clearly. Selection implies rejection, and survival suggests extinc- tion. It may be looked at as a process of elimination. The sur- vival of the fit means the failure of the unfit. The selection of the strong is the destruction of the weak. The rejected vastly outnumber the selected. Throughout nature this is the law, and the result is, or has thus far chiefly been, progressive develop- ment or structural perfectionment. Up to a certain point this law must have operated on man as on the animal; the only men with whom we are now acquainted have gone beyond it, or at least greatly reduced its effects. As already stated, sociology has nothing to do with struc- tural changes in man, and social development consists in modify- ing the environment. But even here the law of natural evolu- tion may and does apply. Monopolistic tendencies are apparent in all social operations. They assume a great variety of forms. The self-aggrandizement of rulers is one of those forms. One of the principal mistakes of the social philosophy under discus- sion, and one still largely prevalent, is that of assuming that the desire to rule differs in some generic way from other desires, that it is not natural, and does not belong to the class of natural laws. It certainly admits of no such distinction, and must be reckoned with along with other monopolistic tendencies. And it cannot be doubted that the efforts put forth to satisfy this desire have resulted in some of the most effective steps in social evolu-</page><page sequence="11">542 THE AMEARICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY tion. To this influence is largely due the founding of great nations, and there is probably no one factor in the progress of society more potent than the crystallizing and humanizing effect of bringing great areas and vast populations under a single set of regulative agencies. But taking for the moment the standpoint of the physiocratic school of writers referred to, and separating the natural forces of society into the two classes, which may be called industrial and governmental, let us endeavor to form an idea of what the result would be if the former alone existed. In the face of the obvious fact that if the latter class were at any moment wholly in abeyance it would immediately resume operations and soon restore the existing duality of conditions, let us make a com- plete abstraction of all this and seek to represent to ourselves the normal result of the industrial forces working alone. Some such attitude has always been tacitly assumed by those who habitually condemn the governments of the world and conceive them to be hostile to society. These misarchists see the benefi- cent influences of natural law in the industrial world interfered with by what seems to them an extraneous power, which most candid persons will probably admit to be in itself, at least as commonly defined, non-progressive or only negatively progress- ive. But the class I refer to take a part and declare it repress- ive and obstructive of progress. The celebrated "parable of Saint Simon" gives perhaps the most extreme expression to this view that has thus far been uttered, but Mr. Herbert Spencer, although he would not abolish government, is unquestionably its severest modern critic, so much so that anarchistic organs openly claim him as their philosopher. Now if we could imagine that no single member of society would for a moment think of such a thing as the formation of a governing body, and conceive of each of its members as simply pursuing his individual ends in a private way; taking possession, each as best he might, of some portion of the soil, cultivating it for his own use, exchanging his surplus products with others who, choosing as now other occupations, should produce other</page><page sequence="12">SOCIAL GENESIS 543 useful things; making contracts, not indeed legal, but moral, conditioned ultimately on each one's individual power to enforce them; building cities and entering into mercantile and other kinds of business; adopting a mutually accepted medium of exchange, or carrying on a banking system based on the much- praised principle of credit and trust; establishing manufactures of all kinds and disposing of the products; building railroads and operating them without any other restrictions than those imposed by the laws of business and the conditions favorable to the maximum profits; conducting educational institutions wholly on "business principles; " each one worshiping as now in the manner he prefers; and in all other respects acting individually and without collective restraint-if we could conceive, I say, of such a state of things, we might gain a clear idea of society dis- tinct from government. The two things are not essential to each other, at least in thought, and it would be a great gain to the sociologist to be able to separate them. Even if it be admitted that government is a necessary part of human associa- tion, it would be an advantage temporarily to abstract it just as we can abstract any other one element of association. Some, of course, will say that the things specified could not be done in such a state ; that government is a condition to conducting the normal operations of society, and that the hypothesis involves the assumption of higher moral attributes than humanity possesses. Such an assumption would render the hypothesis worthless. This, therefore, is precisely the question to be asked and answered. If it is held that without government society would defeat itself and succumb and the race disappear or lapse into a purely animal or non-social condition, then the inquiry is ended. But given the mental powers possessed by man, few will go so far. The real question therefore is: What would have been the condition of society had no government ever been framed? How many and which ones of the existing institu- tions and operations of society would exist, and what other ones would have been developed ? These are difficult questions, but they are legitimate ones for the sociologist to raise and, as far</page><page sequence="13">544 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY as possible, to settle. This is especially the case at a time like the present, when able philosophers are calling in question the very raison d'7tre of government. Unquestionably these are the ones upon whom it devolves to answer these questions, but aside from all controversy it is profitable to consider them. Assuming that society would have survived a pure state of anarchy from the beginning, it is obvious that there must have been some kind of organization. This is implied in the idea of association. Gregarious animals have no rulers or laws, but they still have a social organization. There are social forces that hold them together. So it would be with men-. It is claimed with much truth that government is never the result of a desire to be governed, but always of a desire to govern. Peo- ples never clamor for a ruler, but rulers rise up spontaneously and assume gubernatorial powers. If there were no ambition to rule, no desire to hold office, no love of glory, and no expec- tation of emolument beyond what private life affords, would the members of society ever take steps to have a government estab- lished? Perhaps not, and yet there is no doubt that many institutions would arise under such circumstances. In fact we may regard all the institutions of society except those that form a part of government as having arisen in this spontaneous way. The multitudinous forms of association that prevail belong to this class. These are all limited as to membership, which is more or less voluntary. They exist for a great variety of widely different purposes, and the same person may belong to any num- ber of them at the same time. It is clear that these would exist even if no government existed, and the various objects of these associations would be accomplished. The primary social forces would be in full activity in a state of anarchy the same as under any form of government, and men would put forth the normal efforts to preserve, continue, and mitigate life. If, as has been assumed, human nature was what it is, the egoistic propensities would exist as now, and even if no one wanted to undertake their control society would certainly adopt some means of holding them in check. This is proved by the way in</page><page sequence="14">SOCIA L GENESIS 545 which the citizens of frontier districts, in the absence of ade- quate governmental protection, deal with adventurers and des- peradoes who disturb the peace. Vigilance committees may be regarded as incipient spontaneous governments, without any motive of ambition or emolument. So far as mere protection from anti-social tendencies is concerned, they seem to prove that government would always originate itself spontaneously. How far it would go if these motives were permanently absent seems, then, to be the real question. It is therefore clear that society would not only exist with- out other government than that which would originate spon- taneously from other causes than the desire to rule, but also that it would progress in some degree. This progress might be regarded as typically genetic, and the exclusive product of the normal action of the social forces directly modifying the environment in the interest of society. I have stated this hypothetical case in order to draw the dis- tinction as clearly as possible between genetic progress and telic progress. So large a part of even past social progress has been telic that it is extremely difficult to separate the two. Still, from a certain point of view, nearly all the progress thus far attained may be regarded as genetic. In the sense of being the result of the normal action of natural laws all of it must be so regarded. There is a sense, then, in which society makes itself, is a genetic product, and its progress takes place under the general law of evolution that prevails in all departments of natural phe- nomena. In organic development new principles are constantly coming in, but none of these exempts the resultant phenomena from the action of the law of evolution. That law applied to plants after each of the successive steps, sexuality, exogeny, phanerogamy, gymnospermy, angiospermy, apetaly, polypetaly, gamopetaly, insect agency, etc., had been taken, the same as before. In the animal kingdom it was not affected by the suc- cessive appearance of the several higher types of structure from moners to mammals and to man. Even the psychic faculty, the</page><page sequence="15">546 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY gradual growth of which resulted in an almost complete reversal, from birds upward, of the conditions that governed all creatures below and including the Reptilia, did not visibly check the onward march of organic progress, and the appearance of man with his rational faculty, while it has not wholly arrested phys- ical development, had the effect of transferring the evolutionary forces to the social field to go on at an accelerated pace. No more has social telesis interfered with social genesis, and the telic progress which individual men have secured to society becomes an integral part of the natural evolution of the human race. We may even rise to a higher plane and take into the cosmic conception the past, present, and prospective conscious and intentional social modification, and thus bring the whole into one great scheme of social evolution.
