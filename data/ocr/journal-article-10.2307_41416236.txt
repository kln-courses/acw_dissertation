<plain_text><page sequence="1">BECOMING-ANIMAL TRANSVERSAL POLITICS IRVING GOH This essay began as a response to the treatment of Deleuze and Guattari's concept of becoming-animal in Deleuzo-Guattarian scholarship, in which there remains a general hesitation in considering becoming-animal's political potentiality. There are certainly Deleuzo-Guattarian scholars who explicate the concept of becoming-animal; and while they do not hesitate to extend its application to literary works, they do not tend to discuss its political possibilities.1 Then there are those who are keen to define the ambiguous political terrain of Deleuze and Guattari's philosophy, and yet stop short at including becoming-animal within that political cartography.2 In other words, when it comes to elucidating the politics of Deleuze and Guattari's philosophy, becoming-animal is very much a missing concept. The motivation of this essay then became an endeavor to fill that gap, that is to say, to begin thinking the political force of becoming-animal. Such an en- terprise can have critical stakes for a resistance against a certain geopolitical delimitation within which the twenty-first-century world finds itself bound, since becoming-animal can break with, or rather sidestep, this delimitation. As such, I would argue that there is both a pertinence and an urgency to finally take into account the political potentiality of becoming-animal today, so as to prevent the enclosure of the world by the aforesaid political delimitation.3 However, one must not delimit, in turn, becoming-animal within the domain of poli- tics or the political. Certainly, becoming-animal can be effective, as said, in counteract- ing certain oppressive State politics; in the face of such oppression, becoming-animal can take on a resistant political trajectory. And yet, as this essay will eventually show, becoming-animal is not defined by politics or the political. Politics or the political are never the ends of becoming-animal; becoming-animal does not reduce itself to such lim- its. Becoming-animal understands that there is more to life than politics or the political, and that which surpasses politics or the political is none other than life itself. That there is life, there, if not here and now , beyond the confines or limits of politics or the politi- cal, is what becoming-animal always keeps in mind and strives for, even though it un- derstands that occasionally it will have to take on a political trajectory in order to make that approach. It is on this point of life free(d) from politics that this essay finds its reso- 1 See for example Bruns, Colebrook, and Penny. 2 See especially Bontà and Protevi, Buchanan and Thoburn, and Patton. 3 At this point , my essay might seem to echo Bennington, since he, following Lyotarďs L'inhumain, seeks in " the inhuman, " or what Bennington is inclined to refer as "animality, " some " would-be revolutionary politics " [24]. Bennington, however, does not really specify the motivations for the latter, nor its objectives. And, if I may say so, Bennington's endeavor resembles a deconstruction of anthropocentric and/or anthropomorphic political ontology, showing that politics has always been predicated on some animal trace, or that politics is always animal politics or " always somewhat animal " [34]. I am not inclined toward such a binding relation between animals and politics. For me, animals do not let themselves be delimited by politics: they free themselves from such limita- tions. diacritics Volume 39.2 (2009) 37-57 © 2012 by the Johns Hopkins University Press</page><page sequence="2">nance with Laurent Dubreuil's call for a "negative" politics or "apolitics." This is because "apolitics," like becoming-animal as I read it, is nothing short of "leaving politics" as Dubreuil puts it in an earlier essay, "breaking] ranks with politics" in order to recover life that has been captured by political determination, to affirm "life in excess of the political force that handles it" ["Leaving Politics" 95, 97]. The assertion of such a life becomes more insistent, if not more radical, in Dubreuil's "Preamble to Apolitics." There, "livable life" that is "non-political," or life that escapes or resists all "political formatting," is to be pursued with "the desire for an even greater defection" from politics and the political, with "the urge to get rid of politics" [7,5]. To put in place such a rejection of politics or the political, or more precisely the rejection of the delimitation of life by politics or the political, Dubreuil also posits that one must " say and show that there is life in life. Live politics and leave politics" ["Leaving Politics" 98]. In a way, my intervention here, in its sustained elucidation of becoming-animal, is also a response to that challenge, showing how becoming-animal "lives politics" by positing a political resistance to the delimiting geopolitics of the twenty-first century, and how it "leaves politics" by going beyond such political engagement as well in order to reaffirm life free(d) from politics.4 Despite a certain commonality between my following of becoming-animal and Du- breuil's "apolitics," which perhaps can be expressed in Maurice Blanchot's terms of "the right to disappear" [le droit de disparaître] [36] from all structures or organizations that seek to confine life solely within a political totality, there is a divergence as well, specifi- cally on the question of space. When Dubreuil calls for "the affirmation of an outside" ["Preamble" 12] he seems to suggest that there must be a space set apart for life that wants nothing from politics or the political. As I will point out later, there is, however, a certain danger in proclaiming such an outside in our present twenty-first century. Furthermore, once apolitics articulates for itself an outside or a place apart from existing political spac- es, such a measure tends to risk politicizing those spaces (should they ever exist as con- crete spaces), and therefore apolitics as well. This is why I prefer to hinge my interven- tion on the term "transversal," which implies perpetual, and even uncertain, movement. Everything bears on the "transversal," and this is the case for becoming-animal, when it moves from taking on a political trajectory in order to resist State politics to freeing itself subsequently from politics in order to live life. The "transversal" element, that is to say that which prevents all hypostasis or localization, is what enables becoming-animal to sidestep the capture of politics or the political. 4 1 do not forget that Dubreuil is also sympathetic to Deleuze and Guattarťs philosophy. Dubreuil does not touch on "becoming-animal, " but makes the link between " apolitics " and Deleuze and Guattarťs "micropolitics" (which I also deal with here).

[Deleuze and Parnet 61] To the inhumanness of the " diabolical powers ," there is the answer of a becoming- animal: to become a beetle , to become a dog, to become an ape, " head over heels and away, " rather than lowering one ys head and remaining a bureaucrat, inspector, judge, or judged. [Deleuze and Guattari, Kafka 12] Let me now return to what first motivates this essay, which is the hesitation in considering the political potentiality of becoming-animal in Deleuzo-Guattarian scholarship.5 That refusal may be said to be an anthropomorphic and/or anthropocentric reflex, even though Deleuze's philosophy of becoming, if not Deleuze's philosophy tout court , explicitly mobilizes against such a reflex. That reflex becomes evident when Deleuzo-Guattarian scholarship makes appeals to "actualized or actualizable elements of democratic political normativity" [Patton, "Becoming-Democratic" 190] or to "limits of what is possible un- der present [political] conditions" [Patton, "Utopian Political Philosophy" 49-50]. Such appeals are undeniably anthropomorphic and/or anthropocentric because "what is possi- ble under present [political] conditions" tends to exclude considerations of animals or the animal condition of life.6 Only the (rational) voice of the human reverberates within the limits of "present political normativity" ["Utopian Political Philosophy" 49] .7 Even when 5 1 am referring to Deleuzo-Guattarian scholarship published in English. In terms of non-English scholarship, the collection of French essays in Antonioli, Chardel, and Regnauld must not be ig- nored , but again, the question of becoming-animal and its political potentiality marks a signifi- cant absence there. In another collection in French on the animal question, Marrati-Guénoun's "L'animal qui sait fuir" argues for a transhistorical politics of faciality of becoming-animal. The transhistorical perspective is where I depart from her work, since I contextualize becoming-animal here within contemporary global politics. 6 Patton's vision of a Deleuzo-Guattarian politics " to achieve . . . improvements in the conditions of a given people " [" Utopian Political Philosophy " 47] is undeniably anthropocentric. Becoming- animal does turn up in Patton 's earlier Deleuze and the Political, but he does not explicitly suggest how becoming-animal can posit a potential political force . In the more recent Deleuzian Concepts, Patton brings in becoming-animal in an essay on the literary treatment in J. M. Coetzee 's Disgrace of the politics of colonization or post-colonization , but leaves it out in the section " Normative Po- litical Philosophy. " 7 1 note too that such political thought is a legacy of an anthropocentric and/ or anthropomorphic reading of Aristotle 's Politics throughout history. It reads in the Politics a separation between hu- mans and animals via the element of logos or rational speech, denying its presence in animals; consequently, deprived of logos, animals, unlike humans, are judged to be unable to organize their lives via the labor of jurisprudence, or demand or institutionalize a right to justice in the face of a wrong done to them. This canonized reading of the Politics has granted humans the category of " political animals" and not animals. Bennington's deconstructive reading in this collection will show that in Aristotle, humans are only more political than animals, and that animals can have logos, except they cannot transform the latter into rhetoric [31-34]. Becoming- Animal / Irving Goh 39</page><page sequence="4">the issue of animal welfare turns up as an element in so-called political normativity, it can always be reduced to a gesture made in the name of the ethical progress of humans; or when it concerns the protection of animal lives in relation to ecological sustainability, it is but in the name of perpetuating human habitation and alimentation in the world. In short, it is only in the image of the rational human, if not "the average adult- white-heterosexual- European-male- speaking a standard language" [Deleuze and Guattari, Plateaus 105], that development in political thought is recognized and put into practice.8 Any figure less than or in excess of this rational human being will not count in the space of such a thought, and so animal life will not form any part of "present political normativity," especially not becoming-animal, which, as Deleuze and Guattari say, makes the rational human figure reel. This explains the rejection of the question of becoming-animal in Deleuzo-Guattarian political thought as long as it predicates itself on "present political normativity," since its inclination as such cannot or is unable to conceptually and empirically account for it. The anthropomorphic and/or anthropocentric limits that haunt Deleuzo-Guattarian po- litical thought however, must not prevent thinking becoming-animal as integral to the politi- cal force of Deleuze and Guattari's philosophy. As the second epigraph to this section from Deleuze and Guattari's book on Kafka indicates, or as they say in more general terms in A Thousand Plateaus , "there is an entire politics of becomings-animal" [247], a politics that constitutes for example, in Kafka's stories, a counterpoint to the striating bureaucracy or op- pressiveness of institutional politics. The political potentiality of becoming-animal must not be marginalized or ignored, therefore. There is even a certain urgency, if not necessity, to recognize or even put into effect the political force of becoming-animal. And this is because there exists, on the one hand, a certain trap in constructing political philosophies that remain within "present [democratic] political normativity," and on the other, a certain impasse in contemporary radical politics that seeks to counter such normativity. A few notes on the trap in remaining within "present [democratic] political norma- tivity" are in order. It is by now undeniable that the horizons of democratic thinking and practice in our early twenty-first century, i.e. the post-9/11 world, have been under siege. Exploiting the global anxiety for an international democratic peace and security, those horizons have been captured by the sovereign State war-machine, namely the American one, such that international democratic politics is thinkable only in terms of a total sub- mission to a global "war on terror." Every state in the world, every democratic citizen of the world, must accede to support the "war on terror" and not resist it, no matter what form that war has taken, and no matter if its proceedings were adequately justified or not. Such politics has also demanded that every entity in the world presents itself as a singu- lar, identifiable body, meaning that none must resist its exposure to the State's globally prevalent technics of surveillance or identification (CCTVs, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles [UAVs], body scanners, biometrie passports, etc.) that seek to contain that body within that politics. Nothing less than a politics of identifiability is at work here, and preemptive strikes will be "justified" not only against a territory but also against an individual body that has appeared to deviate from this politics. This condition, which echoes Deleuze 's fear of a "world State ... of absolute peace still more terrifying than that of total war" [Deleuze and Parnet 139], has more or less institutionalized itself as the sole normative dimension of so-called democratic geopolitics today. Certainly, the Obama administration has replaced the Bush administration in 2009 and has ended American military operations in Iraq. However, a sign of the world com- pletely free from the "war on terror" remains wanting. One does not cease to describe 8 Deleuze and Guattari identify this figure as underlying all existing political thought and argue that it must be critiqued and combated against. 40 diacritics / summer 2009</page><page sequence="5">our contemporary situation as a time of war, and not without justification, since reports of UAVs taking out terror suspects in Pakistan or Afghanistan continue, not to mention that in early 2010, the United States and Great Britain considered extending the "war on terror" to Yemen. Nor has one witnessed a reduced intervention by the State's global military and surveillance technics in public spaces under the Obama administration. The increasing affirmation, if not celebration, of security imaging as a highly competitive and therefore profitable enterprise points to the fact that neither the U.S. nor other democratic countries are moving toward dismantling the politics of identifiability and its militarized surveillance structures. Instead, such politics and technics, to reiterate, are becoming nat- uralized as a norm in democratic states the world over, regardless of if one is still in the "war on terror" or not. It is as such that there is a certain trap in deploying the rhetoric of "democratic political normativity": one risks being delimited within the horizons of the State's politics of identifiability; worse, one risks being implicated as acquiescent to such State politics. In any case, it is evident that political thought, especially one that seeks to inscribe a veritable democracy, cannot go far by deferring to "the limits of what is pos- sible under present conditions" when those limits are essentially captured or determined by a questionable State "democratic" geopolitics. In place of a political thought that defers to "democratic political normativity," radi- cal politics unfortunately does not present a real alternative. Under the militarized archi- tecture of "democratic" geopolitics, radical politics, or in fact any other similar form of politics that seeks to counter the ideology and technics of a State-determined "democra- cy," appears to be at an impasse, if not impossible. This is because, as stated above, State surveillance apparatuses and preemptive strike machines will guard against any minimal political deviation. This is not to say that one has stopped conceptualizing radical political thought in the post-9/11 world. Contemporary theorists such as Hardt and Negri, Virno, Galloway and Thacker, and Casarino have tasked themselves to construct radical politics in and for the twenty-first century. Their point of attack however, is not the highly milita- rized horizon of the post-9/1 1 world. The imperative, for them, is to critique and undo the capitalist network empire (structurally not unrelated to the militarized world of surveil- lance technics), which has captured and controlled communicative discourses of people everywhere. In opposition to that empire, they have called for either a "multitude" or a "common," with an idiosyncratic form of communication that both eludes the appropria- tion of the network empire and undoes the empire's demand to convert all discourses into economically productive information.9 More radical is the strategy suggested by Gallo- way and Thacker, who call for "tactics of nonexistence" [135], which seek to smash that empire network by creating a counter-network from within. Such network-based radical politics run certain risks however, if not a certain nihilism, if the State's advanced military and surveillance technics is not taken into consideration. For instance, one can sense how "tactics of nonexistence" easily risk falling short, just by the reminder of the existence of the Eighth Air Force, a combat-ready squadron created and tasked by the American State war-machine in 2006 to locate and destroy such counter-networks in cyberspace. Present radical political thought is therefore quite inadequate or ineffective to side- step the force of the State war-machine. However, that does not mean that one should then give up resisting the ideology of existing State-determined "democratic" geopoli- tics, no matter how impossible such resistance may seem. Resistance remains necessary, a necessity that Deleuze and Guattari insist on via their lament that "we lack resistance 9 See Hardt and Negri, Casarino and Negri, and Virno. Largely inspired by Deleuze 's philosophy, the question of becoming-animal is interestingly absent in their works. For example, instead of becoming-animal, Hardt and Negri will speak of a "becoming-Prince ," which is " the process of the multitude learning the art of self-rule and inventing lasting democratic forms of social organi- zation " [Commonwealth viii] . Becoming- Animal / Irving Goh 41</page><page sequence="6">to the present" [What is Philosophy? 108]. I would argue that becoming-animal is that trajectory of resistance we need today: becoming-animal can resist or sidestep the force of the State war-machine, and hence lead one out of the impasse of contemporary radical political thought. One has to recognize, therefore, the political potentiality of becoming- animal today. But before eliciting the political promise of becoming-animal, I note here that becoming-animal is not exempt from the preemptive violence of the State's military and surveillance apparatuses, which would seek to obliterate it with force and accelera- tion the moment becoming-animal presents itself as an explicit affront against the State. Resistance needs a subtler strategy today; it must not hypostasize into a political program, or give itself an explicitly defined political contour. Becoming-animal, as I understand it, proceeds with such a strategy, and that is its critical political force in the face of our early twenty-first-century "democratic" geopolitics.10 2 The Politics of Becoming- Animal To accept becoming-animal, one must be prepared to push existing political thought be- yond its anthropocentric or anthropomorphic limits. One must in fact be prepared even to depart from existing models of political thought, rather than to assimilate or even tame becoming-animal within their norms or normativity; it is this very departure that constitutes becoming-animal's first steps in sidestepping the striation of State-determined "democratic" politics.11 According to Deleuze and Guattari, becoming-animal is a matter of spatiality- a zone of proximity with the animal- and the temporal immersion into that spatiality. It is an experience of being-at-the-edge, a border experience, or "a phenom- enon of bordering" [Plateaus 345] opened up between the human and the animal. And this border experience of becoming-animal is about sensing the animal, or the actualiza- tion of the force or affect of the animal within us, which is the effectuation of a power of the pack that throws the self into upheaval and makes it reel . Who has not known the violence of these animal sequences, which uproot one from humanity , if only for an instant , making one scrape at one 's 10 This is where I deviate from Thacker 's take on becoming-animal. Thacker argues that becoming- animal is a sort of swarming animality and suggests that its potential for radical politics lies precisely in the faceless dimension of its very entity as a swarm. Without a facial profile to identify itself as friend or foe , becoming-animal as such unhinges the Schmittian definition of politics as the decisive determination of a friend-enemy distinction. In place is another politics , which poses " local actions and global patterns " and an " ambivalent , tensile topology " against sovereignty and control [Thacker 181]. In my view , such politics presents itself too hastily as a too-explicit affront against State politics , which only invites the violent intervention of the State 's surveillance and military apparatuses. 11 Three notes here: firstly , departure is not yet a question of " leaving politics " as Dubreuil wants it, since a certain political intervention by becoming-animal, in order to counter State politics, is still required at this stage. Secondly, becoming or becoming-animal, according to Deleuze, is never a form of derivative politics, as if it needs to refer to existing norms or normativity of political thought. (See Deleuze and Parnet 125.) Thirdly, in many ways, I share Calarco's vision of radical politics, whereby it is " unrealistic and Utopian " to continue looking to existing democratic politics for an ethicopolitical project that will take into consideration nonhuman animals. A departure from " present humanist, democratic, and juridical orders " is necessary [97-98] . Calarco discusses De- leuze and Guattari 's becoming-animal [41-43], but too briefly to allow him to elucidate its political potentialities, strategies, implications, and effects. 42 diacritics / summer 2009</page><page sequence="7">bread like a rodent or giving one the yellow eyes of a feline? A fear some involu- tion calling us toward unheard-of becomings . [Plateaus 240] We must respond to those calls and it is in responding to those animal affects that one can begin that traversing or "crossing" [passage ] [Marrati-Guénoun 203] toward an animal space. In taking that step toward an animal space via becoming-animal, one in fact initi- ates the process of counteracting the militarized surveillance architectures of State poli- tics. Now, "present political normativity," or conventional anthropocentric or anthropo- morphic politics, which also includes contemporary State "democratic" geopolitics, has hardly concerned itself with animals: it largely leaves them to be. In other words, as long as politics remains logocentric and anthropocentric or anthropomorphic, animals are never subjected to the same political determinations, delimitations, and obligations that humans experience as "political animals." Put in another way, animal spaces largely escape the gaze and capture of politics. This also means that by recovering the very space of exclusion occupied by the animal after it has been left aside by the frames of normative politics, critical thought has a space to slide into and means to sidestep State politics.12 One must however be meticulous to ensure that this animal space is not outside of the militarized s/State of contemporary global politics, or that it explicitly marks a space that tears away from the State. I make another precautionary reminder here that seeking such an outside is nothing short of a death wish today.13 Rather, it will be an adjacent space that escapes the gaze and capture of State military and surveillance apparatuses, where becoming-animal can posit a political resistance that counters and goes beyond the terror and limits of early twenty-first-century "democratic" normativity.14 But perhaps one must be more meticulous and state that this adjacent space would allow becoming-animal not only to slip toward the blind spot of the gaze of State politics, but also to remain before all technics of identifiability, hence preserving itself from all State preemptive violence. As I would put it, this adjacent space is where becoming- animal can let play its doubling effect of I remain, I become. This subtle strategy, espe- cially critical in the face of militarized surveillance architectures, and which is no less an artifice or ruse and not without humor,15 is suggested by Deleuze and Guattari: "becoming 12 The definition " political animal " might even suggest that such spaces are recoverable, since the term " animal " would seem to constantly retrace that which the definition, according to a long line of anthropocentric and/ or anthropomorphic political thought, puts aside. An animal space can be recuperated by rethinking the term " political animal, " by which the term must no longer concern a human-animal separation or distinction, but how the human might cross over to the animal. For Bennington, the term "political animal " became anthropocentric through the exploitation of logos (which animals can have, in Bennington's reading , following Labarrière) into rhetoric, which is to say, deliberative phrases that decide, in human terms and language, what is good and evil, just and unjust. But Bennington also argues that something always remains or is recoverable that is shared between humans and animals , which he calls " a residual phônè, a kind of persistent animality of language" [34]. 13 This is where I diverge from Dubreuil's call for an outside or to create " tears in the political fabric " [ " Preamble " 8] . ,4 I am keeping in mind here Deleuze and Guattari 's point that one must not delimit counter-thought to the outside. When the outside is impossible, there is always the alternative to resist from within- and one can do that by creating an adjacent space. ( See Plateaus 353.) 15 There is no doubt something of "treason," if not a " treacherous " humor [Deleuze and Parnet 68], in the doubling effect of I remain, I become before the technics of identifiability. It makes light of the latter, and is therefore an unbearable humor for the political apparatuses that are putting in place such technics. This " treacherous " humor is also surely close to DubreuiVs statement on the political force of mockery: "se moquer de la politique c'est aussi faire de la politique " ["Leaving Politics " 97]. On the element of humor in Deleuze and Guattari' s philosophy as "a strategy of dis- sent," see also О' Sullivan 73. Becoming- Animal / Irving Goh 43</page><page sequence="8">is always double" [Plateaus 305]. As they will explain, in becoming-animal the original entity, the human for example, remains as he or she is. This part of his or her entity can still present itself as a singular, identifiable body before any technics of identifiability, so as to be preserved from the State's deadly preemptive measures. However, something happens at the same time at the edge of these bodies: imperceptible molecular move- ments are taking place, deterritorializing themselves from the anthropomorphic body and traversing towards an animal affect. Becoming-animal here involves an almost literal disappearance, as it puts forth "an objective zone of indétermination or uncertainty" [Pla- teaus 273], or tends towards the in- visible or "the imperceptible" [249]. In a way, the disappearing if not dis-appearing condition of becoming-animal disrupts the real, or it dislocates the perception of the real [239]. It makes itself difficult, almost impossible, to be located in the real, but it is nevertheless real and not the stuff of dreams or fantasies [273]. It is a problematic real therefore, a real that is non-deitic, undefinable, unidentifi- able. In other words, one cannot capture in visual terms that aspect of human life that is becoming animal, that aspect that is in- visibly occurring at the edges of the human form: becoming-animal proceeds by being "something more secret, more subterranean" [237] than what the real would like it to display to visibility. If traversing towards an animal space constitutes becoming-animal's initial sidestep- ping of State politics, the dis-appearing part of becoming-animal is its challenge or re- sistance to the State's technics of surveillance, while letting the visible anthropomorphic body remain before those same technics.16 In other words, it is with the I become of becoming-animal that one may speak of a political trajectory of becoming-animal that counters or resists State politics: its dis-appearing aspect always remains difficult for any identifying technics of the State to trace or chart at present or in advance. It always slips into an adjacent space that is the blind spot of the gaze of State politics, where the body is not limited to a singular form but can fully and freely engage (with) its own multiplic- ity. In the face of a politics of identifiability, becoming-animal surreptitiously contests the demand for a totalizing coming to presence and presents at best a haziness before all gazes of the State apparatus. In that sense, and in keeping in mind that the dis-appearance of I become is a matter of molecular investment in an animal affect, one may also speak of a "molecular politics" [Plateaus 277] or even "a revolutionary micropolitical action" [Guattari, La révolution 242] of becoming-animal. As Deleuze and Guattari will tell us, "molecular politics" or "micropolitics" resists any apparatus that attempts to striate or delimit a body to a singular entity according to codes determined by that apparatus; and "molecular politics" or "micropolitics" will counter such striating operation by setting free the "intensive multiplicities" [Guattari, La révolution 245] or "diverse modalities" [Guattari, Psychanalyse et transversalité 84] that a body desires to express- multiplici- ties and modalities that exceed and escape all codifications by the apparatus.17 3 The Aisthësis of Becoming- Animal Before one can put into effect "molecular politics" or "micropolitics," there is always the question of how one becomes-animal, a question that arises for readers of Deleuze and Guattari's philosophy, since they give us only a vague sense of the process. As Deleuzian 16 It is as such that becoming-animal , in the context of a militarized post-9/11 world, is the wiser strategy in relation to the tactics of existing radical politics of constructing a " multitude " or " com- mon " via explicit " tactics of nonexistence 17 See also the section on " Micropolitics and Segmentarity" in A Thousand Plateaus. 44 diacritics / summer 2009</page><page sequence="9">scholars do not fail to underscore, becoming-animal is nothing like a mimetic repetition of the animal form; this means that to become-animal one cannot rely on an image of a particular animal that the human form will gradually take on or resemble. And if there are no visual signposts to point toward becoming-animal, Deleuze and Guattari will add to the difficulty of becoming-animal by insisting that there is no prescriptive methodology, "no logical order" to it [Plateaus 250] . In other words, one cannot refer to any foundation of reason, logos , norms, or normativity to become-animal. In becoming-animal, "Being expresses [the human and the animal] both in a single meaning in a language that is no longer that of words, in a matter that is no longer that of forms, in an affectability that is no longer that of subjects" [Plateaus 258; emphasis added]. To put it briefly, becoming- animal cannot be pinned down by rational human discourse. Common sense and intel- ligible sense serve no purpose here; they are powerless before becoming-animal. In a sense, becoming-animal just becomes, without need for, or rather without any lack of, the linguistic and rationalizing performatives of logos. According to Deleuze and Guattari in A Thousand Plateaus , it can even be "done with enough feeling" [275] , although they will be quick to underscore that this feeling is nothing subjective: "the affect is not a personal feeling" [240]. Instead, this particular affect or feeling opens one to a plural alterity or heterogeneity within and without. Becoming-animal, as said before, is then a question of being worthy of such affects, of opening oneself to the sensation of animal affects and responding to them affirmatively, rather than allowing any anthropomorphism or anthro- pocentrism to block those responses. This particular "feeling" or sensation of animal affects may perhaps be found in the originary and communicative aisthësis that humans and animals share. Ai st he sis, as Aristotle observed, is the irreducible feeling of "pleasure and pain" that both humans and animals sense, and which enables both humans and animals to immediately "communi- cate" a wrong done to them.18 To cross to the adjacent space of the animal, it is perhaps a question of recovering that originary aisthësis then, i.e. of recovering a sensation of the milieu19 of aisthësis that humans and animals originarily share.20 Originary aisthësis has to be recovered because we have somehow lost it when Aristotle supplemented it with an anthropocentric logos in his political philosophy. Now, it could be argued that originary aisthësis , in its immediate sensing and communication of pain or wrong done to a human or animal, is of political potentiality, i.e. aisthësis in itself is already adequate to demand, without delay, an addressing of the wrong committed against a human or animal. Aristotle, however, refuses to recognize the political potentiality of aisthësis as such. For aisthësis to become politics "proper," Aristotle insists on the supplement of 18 See T. A. Sinclair's note 19 to aisthësis in his translation of The Politics. Heller-Roazen has also argued that the Aristotelian aisthësis is that which reconnects the human and the animal. Any en- deavor to define , in sharp opposition to the animal , what is proper to the human (e.g. the faculty of reason, as it has been claimed throughout history) always " produces a remainder, which cannot be attributed with any exclusivity to either human or inhuman beings, " a " region " or " sensation [aisthësis]" that is " common , by definition, to all animal life " [93]. 19 I deliberately use " milieu " and avoid the word " territory , " because a territory always defines itself through some identifiable limits or boundaries. The point here, as this essay is suggesting, is to think of a space that is unidentifiable or escapes identifiability, and the term "milieu" would suit such a space. As Grosz puts it, and with reference to the animal and to non-identifiability, "a milieu ... is not yet a territory. A milieu is what the fly inhabits, an indeterminable but limited space " [46] . She also goes on to contrast the milieu to territory, which she defines as " the delimitation of a milieu " [47]. 20 Such re- sensing of aisthësis shared between humans and animals is largely at work too in Heller-Roazen. 46 diacritics / summer 2009</page><page sequence="10">rational speech or logos , which will transform aisthěsis into an all too human "perception of good and evil" and "a sense of justice" that "decides what is just" in an institutional or legalistic manner [60-61]. From here, it could be said then that to recover aisthěsis be- fore it is supplemented by an anthropocentric logos is not only a way toward the adjacent space of becoming-animal, but also an unveiling of becoming-animal's potentiality for a future political project of justice. Participating in an affect "that is no longer of words," becoming-animal becomes invested in an immanent response, "here and now" in De- leuze and Guattari's words [What is Philosophy? 174], to the injustices enacted against any singularity with or without logos , without the delay entailing legal processes that translate injustices and corresponding legal actions into the linguistic performativities of institutional jurisprudence.21 Such a project of justice that has no need for logos certainly departs from, if not displaces, the economy of illocutionary exchanges that sustains the spirit of democratic parliamentary discussion. However, as suggested, its immanent re- sponsiveness might even be more effective than all existing political normativity based on some communicative action that is in turn conditioned by some preexisting common knowledge or linguistic idioms shared between speech actors.22 The shift to originary aisthěsis , or the refusal to predicate itself on any logocentric system, gives becoming-animal a further radical political edge as well. Being an experi- ence that is hardly rationalized or rationalizable (since it is an experience without method and without program as noted above) and therefore barely known or knowable, becoming- animal can be said to disrupt, in a word, biopolitics, a political condition that regulates life in a hegemonic manner, and which thinkers such as Agamben have considered the contem- porary world to be in.23 Biopolitics, as Foucault has already analyzed it, is perfectible only if it has knowledge of its subjects, or if its subjects are always knowable; biopolitics cannot consolidate its management of its subjects if there exists a life, such as becoming-animal, which resists conceptualization.24 With becoming-animal's refusal to be conceptualized, we 21 For Bennington, following Lyotard, all these would be a question of the "vocalization or a vocifera- tion " of the " quasi-animal affect-phrase " or différend that cannot be articulated or represented in anthropocentric rhetoric [25]. As Bennington makes clear, the question of justice is also at stake with the Lyotardian différend, where justice is not decided on solely by the human and oftentimes manipu- lative rhetoric of institutional jurisprudence. (See also Lyotard and Thébaud.) 22 In this sense, becoming-animal perhaps goes further than the radical politics proposed by the aforementioned theorists such as Hardt and Negri, Virno, and Casarino, or even the Udissensus " politics of Rancière ( elaborated in Disagreement). "Communication" -based counter-networks and " disagreements " not only risk being captured eventually by the logos-based State apparatuses, but also restrict the extension of immanent justice without delay to those who do not share the capabil- ity to articulate a disagreement, or the idioms of the " multitude " or "common." I further note that Rancière1 s "dissensus" hardly takes into account animals or animal beings. In a later interview, Rancière extends his thesis on "dissensus " to state that politics proper must include the "struggle over words" [Agamben et al., Démocratie 97]. Without "words" in the sense of those that are ex- changed in present political domains, the animal or becoming-animal is once again not included in this "struggle." 23 For a critique of the too-hasty translation of the contemporary political situation in terms of biopolitics, and especially Agamben's hasty separation between bios and zõê, see Dubreuil "Leav- ing Politics." 24 Biopolitics, for Agamben, is put in place by an "anthropological machine" that "functions by means of an exclusion " of those it deems unmanageable or unconceptualizable (e.g. the animal ) [The Open 37-38]. To disrupt such biopolitics, Agamben argues that one must leap into a "zone of indeterminacy" where one enters into a relation with that which is unknowable (e.g. the animal), rather than to exclude it. For a critique of Agamben's unconscious need to maintain the human- animal separation produced by the "anthropological machine " such that the leap into the "zone of indeterminacy" can take place, see LaCapra, "Reopening the Question of the Human and the Animal," in History and Its Limits. Becoming- Animal / Irving Goh 47</page><page sequence="11">are once again in the domain of "something more secret, more subterranean" of becoming- animal's politics, which we have seen in its molecular trajectories. A certain posture of secrecy is no doubt at play here too in becoming-animal's escape from any methodology that seeks to pin it under a rationalizing gaze. In fact, as Derrida has noted, there has always been a secret to the animal, the secret of what it thinks and whether it even thinks at all: the animal, as such, can therefore never be the complete epistemic object of total knowledge, its secret always remaining to be a madness for any economy of rational thought, which hence always troubles philosophers.25 Yet its secret is also precisely that radical condition that al- lows it to be free from any conceptual capture that Man is subjected to, like his or her striat- ing categorization as political-being or "political animal."26 Becoming-animal, which reiter- ates the unconceptualizable secret of the animal, challenges any (State) politics that seeks to totalize and homogenize every human life as its knowable, singular, political subject. Speaking of the unconceptualizable contour of becoming-animal, one may perhaps transpose the aisthěsis of becoming-animal to an aesthetic modality, or more specifically, to the Kantian experience of aesthetic sensation, which is derived not only from art objects but also from nature. The proximity between the Kantian aesthetic sensation and the aisthěsis of becoming-animal is almost undeniable, since they share many similar traits. For one, if the originary aisthěsis that concerns becoming-animal is of an (immediate) communicable feeling of pleasure or pain, one finds a corresponding "universal communicability" in the Kantian aesthetic sensation.27 And if aesthetic sensation, for Kant, escapes the grasp of human cognition,28 or is essentially and ultimately unknowable and contributes nothing to knowledge [42; §1, 71; §15] or is without concept [70; §15], all these traits are cer- tainly encapsulated by the unconceptualizable contour of becoming-animal. The aisthěsis of becoming-animal can be even said to be close to the Kantian sublime aesthetic sensation, considering that Kant has argued that we sense such sensation through things in nature that exceed what our existing knowledge of nature has prepared us for, or that exist beyond the limits of recognizable or humanly perceptible forms [90-91; §23]29- and becoming- 25 See Derrida, The Animal That Therefore I Am 9. Resonating with Derridďs and Deleuze and GuattarVs discussions of the animal's secret, Agamben has written that there is in the animal a " zone of nonknowledge- or of a-knowledge- that ... is beyond both knowing and not knowing " [91]. On another note, Derrida in fact disagrees with Deleuze 's treatment of the animal, not so much with the question of becoming-animal, but with Deleuze's suggestion in Difference and Rep- etition that bêtise or stupidity, or even devenir-bête or "becoming- stupid, " is properly the essence of humans and not animals [150] . See the 30 January 2002 seminar in The Beast and the Sovereign. 26 Derrida 's treatment of the animal and its secret can also be said to leave all forms of politics predicated on fraternity and alliance or friendship (e.g. democratic politics) suspended, undecided, or undecidable, which then allows all existing forms of politics to be questioned or historicized, opening the thinking of politics- and this has no doubt been Derridďs objective in The Politics of Friendship- to elements that political thought has always rejected, marginalized, or forgotten (e.g. the animal ). Derrida makes that intimation when he says that the animal is " like the every other that is every (bit) other found in such intolerable proximity that I do not as yet feel I am justified or qualified to call it my fellow, even less my brother. For we shall have to ask ourselves , inevitably, what happens to the fraternity of brothers when an animal appears on the scene" [The Animal 12]. 27 Kant, "General Remark Upon the Exposition of Aesthetic Reflective Judgment " [Critique 128-29] . Subsequent references to this edition of The Critique of Judgment will be indicated by a page num- ber and section number. 28 See the Preface to the 1790 First Edition of The Critique of Judgment 5 and the introduction 36. 29 According to Kant, the formlessness of sublime things gives us a sensation of " negative plea- sure " [91; §23] [or " displeasure " [108; §27]. Perhaps that is the pain of the sensation of becom- ing-animal that critics experience when they stand before it, not knowing how to conceptualize it within their political projects. 48 diacritics / summer 2009</page><page sequence="12">animal, as discussed above, is of such a thing. Now, Kant has also said that things of the sublime are of an immense magnitude beyond measure [99; §26]. However, becoming- animal, as seen, proceeds at the molecular dimension, and hence, if there is a magnitude to becoming-animal, it would be at a level of what Deleuze and Guattari would call an n-1 degree of magnitude. Despite this difference, what remains critical for the attainment of either the Kantian sublime or the aisthěsis of the Deleuzo-Guattarian becoming-animal, is an affirmative receptivity via an immanent response, an enthusiasm [Kant 124], or the free play and movement of thought and imagination [Kant 58; §9]. 30 4 The Politics of Aisthěsis Deleuze and Guattari do not fail to inscribe the aesthetic dimension of the aisthěsis of becoming-animal.31 As they say in A Thousand Plateaus , "it is through writing that you become animal" [187]. There is no doubt that Deleuze and Guattari frequently turn to art to locate the nascence or emergence of becoming-animal. And if sensation is the critical mode of responding to animal affects in becoming-animal, they reiterate the importance of art in relation to this aspect of becoming-animal: "the aim of art" is but "to extract a bloc of sensations, a pure being of sensations" [What is Philosophy? 167]. But the question that I would like to pose here is if it is necessary to turn to art in order to elicit and elucidate becoming-animal and its political potential as a counterpoint to State politics. No doubt, art, such as the cinematic arts, as Deleuze argues in L'image-temps, has the political potential- ity to articulate a "people to come" or a yet unthought-of assemblage such as the "intensive multiplicities" of becoming-animal, in opposition to the State's proclamation that no other assemblages exist except those it had constructed and organized. However, Deleuze also warns us that such art risks being eventually appropriated by the State, which would then transform it into State apparatuses serving to disseminate State politics.32 Furthermore, art is always in a way untimely: it comes too early in expressing or projecting sensations such as becoming-animal before they are recognizable or acceptable by the world. Any turn to art in order to finally pursue the trajectory of becoming-animal is always too late a gesture. In that sense, perhaps looking elsewhere will allow us to respond immanently to the sensation of becoming-animal, and hence put in effect an immanent political response to State politics. As Deleuze and Guattari will tell us, this elsewhere is none other than life itself, or rather the experience of the space of everyday life where perceptible and imperceptible matter or elements traverse one another. In that sense, one may perhaps regard the sensa- tion of becoming-animal as an "ambient awareness" of the "intensive multiplicities" or "diverse modalities" around oneself.33 According to Deleuze and Guattari, this would be 30 See also " General Remark on the First Section of the Analytic " 89. 31 On the importance of art in the philosophy andlor political thought of Deleuze and Guattari, see for example de Bloois, Houppermans, and Korsten; Zephe; O' Sullivan; and Bogue. 32 In this case, aesthetic endeavors imminently face a similar fate as the logos -based radical poli- tics of the " multitude " or the "common," where it is only a matter of time when the State captures these modes of expression and neutralizes their radical political force. On the State appropriation of the cinematic arts, see Deleuze, Cinéma 2 282. 33 ' Ambient awareness " is a term social scientists have recently used to describe the phenomenon where a person claims to be able to sense the mood or feelings of another whom he or she is connected with via virtual- or tele -technology. I am borrowing the term here to articulate the sensitivity to sur- rounding elements or matter existing in a virtual state in the Bergsonian/Deleuzian sense, which is to say, things that really exist but do not yet or do not need to assume a physical, concrete, actual form. Becoming- Animal / Irving Goh 49</page><page sequence="13">the sensation of "life lines" or "real becomings that are not produced only in art . . . that do not consist in fleeing into art, taking refuge in art, . . . [and] that never reterritorialize on art" [Plateaus 187]. Life itself, if not only life itself as Deleuze and Guattari will claim, contains enough creative force to engender those multiplicities or modalities [What is Philosophy? 173]. There is always already an aesthetic trajectory in life itself, which is also to say that the sensation of these molecular multiplicities or modalities can already be found in life itself, prior to any fabrication of artworks seeking to express such a sensation [What is Philosophy? 183]. That is also why Deleuze and Guattari will say that "art is never an end in itself' [Plateaus 187] for becoming-animal or for becoming tout court. It is more critical that one immerse oneself "in life, in real life" [Plateaus 187] and be affirmatively receptive and responsive to the encounter with all its molecular animal affects. As Deleuze would also suggest, there is always a political potentiality in the par- ticipation in such molecular dimensions of life, a certain power or subversive con- tour in the molecular "art of encounter outside knowledge," or in short, in "aesthetic existence."34 I would argue that such encounters break with what may be called the politics of (dis-)friendship that underlies post-9/11 State geopolitics. In claiming to defend international democratic peace and security, State politics of (dis-)friendship has demanded that one should not offer friendship, support, or hospitality to forms of life that disagree with, or resist, the technics of identifiability. Otherwise, one would, like those who resisted the "war on terror," be given the name of "rogue," a name that would only announce a "justified" preemptive military force against the thus-named.35 Such State politics has the effect of ultimately discouraging the building of any affin- ity with anyone, even someone who might be an advocate of the politics of "war on terror." But even without the dictum to alienate deviant forms of life, even without the threat of labeling those who befriend such deviants as "rogues," the global military and civilian surveillance apparatus itself already has the force to discourage relations. After Foucault, one knows that the logical end of institutionalized surveillance would only be the translation of surveillance practices into the individual itself. In other words, the individual is conditioned to adopt not only a consciousness of surveillance but also a surveillance-consciousness , whereby individuals begin to conduct surveillance on themselves and on others. Such individualization of surveillance surely hinders the construction of any friendship or trust, and such has been the politics of friendship of the early twenty-first century, where the State has been advising its subject- implicitly and explicitly -to be wary of the next person, whom the State would conjure in the im- age of a possible terror- suspect, terror-perpetrator, terror- advocate, terror-mastermind, or rogue-terrorist. Becoming-animal, in its molecular encounters with "intensive multiplicities" and "diverse modalities," breaks with such State-conjured paranoid narratives of human in- teraction or the State's biopolitical will to manage its subjects by the relations they form. In contrast to the State's determination to control and delimit relations between beings, becoming-animal's "transversal communications between heterogeneous populations" 34 See Deleuze , " Le simulacre " 279 , 298. It is at this point that one may note another difference between the sublime experience of Deleuze and Guattarťs becoming-animal and that of Kantian aesthetics. Deleuze and Guattari maintain the unconceptualizable or unknowable sublime out there, in nature , while Kant will eventually give it an anthropomorphic and anthropocentric reduction by saying that " sublimity should, in strictness, be attributed merely to the attitude of thought " [134; §30]. 35 See Derrida, Rogues for the deconstruction of the word " rogue ," or more precisely, a critique of the political (ab)use of the word " rogue " by the Bush Administration in the post-9/11 world on its political enemies, while not recognizing its own roguish ways. 50 diacritics / summer 2009</page><page sequence="14">[Plateaus 239] open a body to an unlimited relation with any (number of) living entities. In other words, becoming-animal invites unrestricted participations; it constructs its own milieu of friends, its own politics of friendship or assemblages: There is an entire politics of becomings-animal . . . which is elaborated in as- semblages that are neither those of the family nor of religion nor of the State. Instead, they express minoritarian groups, or groups that are oppressed, prohib- ited, in revolt, or always on the fringe of recognized institutions, groups all the more secret for being extrinsic, in other words, anomic. [Plateaus 247] "Micropolitics" in this case offers, as Dubreuil would argue, nothing less than "the op- portunity to approach the organization of the collective from somewhere other than from within the established system of politics ..." ["Preamble" 8] . But to return to the passage above: the alliance with the "anomic" is indeed how becoming-animal sharply challenges the State's politics of (dis-)friendship. The "anomic" is an "exceptional individual," with whom "an alliance must be made in order to become-animal" [Plateaus 243]. But this "anomic" individual is not exceptional in the sense that it is outside the law, or "outside rules or goes against the rules" [244], as how one tends to think of the exception. The "anomic" and the becoming-animal that follows it are more subtle or discreet than to announce themselves as being outside the law or directly antithetical to the State. The "anomic" and becoming-animal understand that doing so will only invite their destruction by preemptive militarized politics. The "anomic" therefore remains within the boundar- ies of what is politically determined as normal, except it is always at the thresholds of those boundaries. It is like a shadow there, and one can never be sure if the shadow has already inclined toward the outside or adjacent spaces. One can never be sure which way the "anomic" is going to turn: back inside, outside, or to the side? Like the animal and its secret, the "anomic" is the figure of uncertainty, "the unequal, the coarse, the rough, the cutting edge" [244], the figure without conceptualization. It does not violate the law but it disturbs the stability or equilibrium of the law precisely because of its undefined or ambiguous political alignment. And yet one should note that an alliance is not a necessary condition for becoming- animal. This is particularly helpful in the case when the "anomic" treads too close to being outside the law, which would then attract the attention of the State's surveillance apparatuses and hence put becoming-animal at risk of a preemptive strike by the State. This non-dependence on an alliance for becoming-animal can be elicited in Deleuze and Guattari when they state that the sensation of animal affects within us does not require an actual, physical proximity with animals. In other words, the empirical pres- ence of an animal is not a necessary condition for becoming-animal. The desire to exceed our singular anthropomorphic selves can already be sufficient. Deleuze and Guattari suggest this when they question the necessity of an outside: "A fascination for the outside? Or is the multiplicity that fascinates us already related to a multiplic- ity dwelling within usT [Plateaus 240; emphasis added]. In What is Philosophy? they would add that the affect of becoming-animal "is a question only of ourselves, here and now' but what is animal, vegetable, mineral, or human in us is now indistinct . . ." Becoming- Animal / Irving Goh 51</page><page sequence="15">[174; emphasis added].36 All these imply that an adjacent space, which is at stake in a politics of becoming-animal, need not be one literally beside our bodily forms: it can also exist within us. In responding affirmatively to becoming-animal, i.e. to the sensa- tion of animal affects within, an adjacent space can be created involutionarily within us: "Becoming is involutionary, involution is creative" [ Plateaus 238] . In this case, the "involutionary" creation of a free space from within one's bodily form avoids the hasty determination to articulate an outside or to form an alliance with a rogue "anomic" in explicit opposition to State, thus evading the fatal intervention by the State's preemp- tive military and surveillance apparatuses. 5 Becoming- Animal: A Life It is always a question of freeing life wherever it is imprisoned, or of tempting it into an uncertain combat. [Deleuze and Guattari, What is Philosophy? 171] To be sure, elucidating the political trajectories of becoming-animal today, which no doubt resist or challenge State politics, will not be about disseminating the ideologies or advocating the conductivity of terror as it is understood and executed in contemporaneous times. If becoming-animal assumes a combative anti-State posture, it is because it puts into question the supposed "democratic" normativity the State has claimed necessary for the defense of a global democratic peace and security. It is also because the State would have first delimited the freedom of becoming-animal in that process: it is when the State seeks to determine becoming-animal's possibilities of relations with other beings, and when it demands a totalizing singular presence from becoming-animal, that becoming- animal will adopt a different disposition from "organizations such as the institution of . . . the State apparatus" and "continually work them from within and trouble them from with- out, with other forms of content, other forms of expression" [Plateaus 242]. In short, it is only when its freedom is at risk that becoming-animal "is accompanied, at its origins as in 36 At this point , one may question the focus on the animal side of things in becoming-animal: what about becoming-vegetable, becoming-mineral, and becoming-woman? Thacker has even claimed that "becoming-animal has nothing to do with animals per se " [ 1 72] . That may be true to a certain extent, especially when Deleuze and Guattari in A Thousand Plateaus gravitate toward becoming- woman as the most critical term in becoming [277]. Yet there are instances where animals seem to be of equal critical significance. Before turning to becoming-woman, they would in fact have already stated that " becoming can and should be qualified as becoming-animal " [238; emphasis added ] . Deleuze would also turn to becoming-animal when speaking about the sensation or affect of paintings in Francis Bacon or about philosophy, as is the case in an interview in Pourparlers, where Deleuze associates the philosophical task of concept-creation with becoming-animal first, before linking it to rhizomes. In that same interview, Deleuze goes asfar as to say that becoming- animal is not so distinct from " relations with the animal " [Negotiations 144, 146]. The passage from A Thousand Plateaus quoted earlier on affect also shows that Deleuze and Guattari 's pre- ferred references are specifically to animals: we scrape like " a rodent " or gaze with the yellow eyes of "a feline." And as is evident in the epigraph from Deleuze and Guattari's Kakfa, politics for Deleuze and Guattari proceeds via becoming-animal more than other becomings. Here again, specific animals are named: a beetle, a dog, an ape. But Thacker 's caution about taking these ani- mals as particularly specific is heeded, since Deleuze and Guattari will say that " every animal is fundamentally a band, a pack " [Plateaus 239]. The point might be about the multiplicity of a pack or a band, but I would argue that that multiplicity nonetheless is invoked, if not possible, only by passing through specific animals. 52 diacritics / summer 2009</page><page sequence="16">its undertaking, by a rupture with the central institutions that have established themselves or seek to become established" [247]. And yet, as it may already be evident, becoming- animal in fact does not launch an explicit combat with the State. The political force of be- coming-animal is always more a matter of "uncertain combat," if not "war without battle lines, with neither confrontation nor retreat, without battles even: pure strategy" [353]. That also means that, unlike the radical politics mentioned at the beginning of the essay, there is never a clear political directive, program, or contour with becoming-animal, and that is how it will always escape the capture and destruction by twenty-first-century State- militarized "democratic" geopolitics. At this point, I would also like to point out that becoming-animal does not reject democracy tout court. Like Patton in his essay "Becoming-Democratic," I do believe that a spirit of democracy remains a backdrop to Deleuze and Guattari's philosophy, only if democracy is meant to be the constant project of recognizing the freedom of life, or the right to life, of anyone or anything in its heterogeneous terms or voice. I have suggested that becoming-animal can further open the terrain of democratic thought as such when it goes beyond the boundaries of a rationalizing logos , which only serve to reduce exist- ing democratic normativity to an anthropocentricism or anthropomorphism. Becoming- animal, in departing not only from all anthropocentric and anthropomorphic political nor- mativity but also from anthropocentric and anthropomorphic thinking in general, allows a non-logocentric terrain to emerge, which negotiates the freedom and justice due to each living entity- human or animal- via the fact of the entity's singularity. In other words, this negotiation will not make acceding to logos (or "rhetoric" in Bennington's reading) a condition for justice, a condition that only creates, as said, a delay, if not an obstacle, to the due address of a violation done against a singularity. One could perhaps say that above everything else, the question of a life free(d) from any form of striation is the ultimate concern of becoming-animal- and here I return once again to my proximity with Dubreuil's endeavor to affirm life that always sidesteps politi- cal determination, appropriation, or to use Dubreuil's word, "formatting." It is in the pur- suit of such a life that becoming-animal will trace a "line of flight" towards an adjacent space that sidesteps a space of capture. The horizon that one must keep in sight, if there is one, when thinking about Deleuzo-Guattarian politics is therefore life, the freedom of life to be precise, and a Deleuzo-Guattarian political gesture would always be engaged in undoing apparatuses that delimit life.37 Todd May is accurate to say that the premise of a Deleuzo-Guattarian political philosophy of life, or "what is often most 'vital' about life is its capacity for disorganizing what is organizing and repressive" [25] . However, I am a little uncomfortable when May puts the question of politics and life in Deleuze as such: "life is what politics is about and, concomitantly, politics suffuses life" [28]. I would like to think that life and politics do not necessarily turn around each other endlessly; that life is not always striated or reterritorialized by politics. I would like to think instead that there is life beyond the frames of politics. Or, according to Dubreuil's "apolitics," there is always "a non-political real" in life ["Preamble" 8] . Politics must not be the unsurpassable limit for life. To think life as only political through and through, not only because it is captured by State biopolitics, but also because it is absolutely committed to some political movement for the good of itself and others, would only risk letting life be "imprisoned" by the domain of politics. In this case, one must then "[tempt life] into an uncertain combat" as Deleuze and Guattari say, and wrest it away from the confines of politics. I am not saying that the "question of freeing life" 37 Deleuze would say likewise of philosophical literature too. As in the essay " Literature and Life," or in his interview with Claire Parnet in Dialogues, he would argue that if philosophical literature engages itself with politics , it would only be a militant commitment to liberate life where it is cap- tured, striated, restricted , or delimited. Becoming- Animal / Irving Goh 53</page><page sequence="17">from political capture or from politics in general need not involve any political moves. On the contrary, I do recognize that certain political steps must be taken in order to "[free] life wherever it is imprisoned," hence my endeavor so far to trace becoming-animal's political potentiality to critique and resist contemporary State "democratic" geopolitics, and to open up a terrain of political thought beyond the limits of anthropocentrism and anthropomorphism. If I am arguing at this point for a life beyond the frames of politics, or that a life free(d) from politics is the ultimate aim of becoming-animal, I am saying, without denying the political potentialities of becoming-animal's trajectory, that a politi- cal contour must not define the ends of becoming-animal.38 To be sure, I also do not mean any return to human or anthropocentric life here. Instead, I follow Deleuze's definition of "a life," according to which, "the life of the individual has given way to a life that is impersonal but singular nevertheless, and which releases a pure event freed from the ac- cidents of inner and outer life; freed, in other words, from the subjectivity and objectivity of what happens" [Deleuze, "Immanence" 4].39 One could indeed raise an objection here and cite Deleuze and Guattari's A Thousand Plateaus where they say that "politics precedes being" [203]. That phrase in itself could suggest that politics does seem to be the first and last concern of Deleuzo-Guattarian phi- losophy. But a careful reading of its context would indicate otherwise. That phrase follows from Deleuze and Guattari's reading of how schizoanalysis perceives the "lines of flight" traversing a living body (lines that can also pertain to the trajectory of becoming-animal since there are also "animal lines of flight" [202]). The fact that these "lines of flight" are read by schizoanalysis as political, however, could also mean that "lines of flight" in themselves are not necessarily political. They become so only under the interpretative lens of schizoanalysis. To put it another way, their political disposition is only a supplemental aspect given by schizoanalysis. Following Fernand Deligny, Deleuze and Guattari will in fact state that "these lines mean nothing" [203] . They will also elaborate that these lines are essentially "without a model," "have nothing to do with language," "have nothing to do with a signifier, the determination of a subject by the signifier," "nothing to do with a struc- ture," and are without "imaginary figures nor symbolic functions" [202, 203] . As such, they inherently do not articulate a "politics" that one can associate with any existing political thought, be it democratic or revolutionary. Or in other words, "lines of flight" do not essen- tially belong in any a priori way to politics. Like becoming-animal, they exceed politics or any endeavor to confine them within political frames. They are ultimately just "life lines," life lines that however can in fact be unbearable to any form of normative anthropocentric and anthropomorphic political thought because of their disavowal of all political norms [203, 205]. It is as such that normative political thought, finding these life lines an affront to existing political normativity, renders them as political or rather counter-political, which hence gives place to the false judgment that "politics precedes being." 38 largue that there is nothing bourgeois or idealistic about the notion of life free(d) from politics. It is not an idle sitting back that lets political struggles be fought by others. In fact, as my intervention here has tried to demonstrate, a certain political battle would already have been fought along the trajectory of becoming-animal. The question of a life free(d) from politics concerns the aftermath of such a battle. Rather than being sucked into the temptation to extend or even reify one's political commitment into something of an eternal war, one must always keep in mind that there is life out- side all ideological struggles. Deleuze has in fact warned us of the danger of a life wholly absorbed by one 's own politics, of not knowing how to depart from our politics: the danger of creating a personal " black hole " of "micro -fascisms, " where " each embeds himself in his own black hole and becomes dangerous in that hole, with a self-assurance about his own case, his role and his mission, which is even more disturbing ..." [Deleuze and Parnet 138-39]. 39 See also Colebrook: " Rather than turning back to life, [becoming-animal] is the course away from various processes of social organization towards the confrontation of the machine of the socius as such that is at once the trajectory of capitalism and the goal of Deleuze and Guattari's project " [152]. 54 diacritics / summer 2009</page><page sequence="18">The sense that becoming-animal is not ultimately delimited by politics can also be elicited when one brings to mind again the ends of becoming-animal. I have noted that for Deleuze and Guattari, the end of becoming-animal is becoming-imperceptible [Plateaus 248] . The ends of becoming-imperceptible or dis-appearing surely have little use for poli- tics as we know it, especially when it pertains to prescribing a political program.40 But it should be noted that this becoming-imperceptible is not a reductive, nihilistic gesture. On the contrary, it is something generative. In becoming-imperceptible, a body's form loses its organized totality; it loses molecules at the edge of its form, but from then on, they come into contact with or are exposed to other molecules riding on a cosmic force that moves the world and that flows through the world. Becoming-animal, in becoming- imperceptible, "brings into play the cosmos with its molecular components" [280]. And it is this active and affirmative interplay with the world's molecules that the becoming- imperceptible of becoming-animal regenerates a thought of the world. In contrast to the apocalyptic teleology of twenty-first-century State politics, the becoming-imperceptible of becoming-animal "is to world, to make a world or worlds," leading us "to be present at the dawn of the world" [280], the dawn of life.41 To reiterate, there is a life to live beyond the frames or domains of politics. So far, human life in this early twenty-first century has almost been absolutely captured as po- litical subjects of a global State politics driven by the perfectibility of an international democratic peace and security. I have tried to suggest that to retrieve the freedom of life from the appropriation of the State, human life cannot do it on its own today but must approach the animal. In becoming-animal, one is also presented the possibility to create an adjacent space where life is free(d) from the capture of striating State politics. Such a process no doubt implicates becoming-animal in a certain political trajectory, as elu- cidated here, but the point, once again, is not to place politics as the horizon of such life or life-liberating strategies. One can put it simply by saying that politics must only be a means of liberating life but not an end in itself. If there is a politics to becoming-animal, as Deleuze and Guattari do not fail to acknowledge, this politics must be understood as something transitional or transversal, a political affect where affect here would mean "purely transitive, and not indicative or representative," as Deleuze articulates elsewhere [Spinoza 49]. Becoming-animal, in other words, as it charts or traverses a politics against the State, also transverses such politics, leaping on a line of flight towards a life beyond the frames or striation of politics. 40 Philippe Mengue will argue against any politics of becoming-imperceptible , which can be con- sidered the virtual in the Deleuzo-Guattarian sense. According to Mengue, what is virtual or what is not grounded in actuality only "misses the central and proper object of politics" [230]. For Mengue, " Politics has to deal with a people that is other than virtual, potential or yet to come. A people that fears for its safety, that has borders to defend, that hopes to improve its well-being, a people that is territorialized, such a people is the proper object of politics" [231]. Evidently, Mengue's anthropocentric take on Deleuzo-Guattarian politics has no place for becoming-animal. 41 This is in contrast to the highly militarized post-9/11 world, where the American State war- machine is prepared to take out even the world to obliterate the slightest sign of terror. Apart from unmanned combat vehicles, it also has stores of thermobaric armament that can hit subterranean bunkers to make sure that no life or living condition is possible in the depths of the earth. In 2005, Donald Rumsfeld, then secretary of defense, even said that earth-penetrating nukes made all the sense in the world. Such apocalyptic horizon only proves Virilio and Lotringer 's thesis according to which the logical end of a militarized logic will be where " everything just has to be uninhabitable. That way there's no more problem " [173]. Becoming- Animal / Irving Goh 55</page><page sequence="19">WORKS CITED Agamben, Giorgio. The Open: Man and Animai. Trans. Kevin Attell.
