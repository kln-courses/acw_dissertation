<plain_text><page sequence="1">ABANDONMENT OF SITES, valleys, and regions has long been a topic of interest to archaeologists and the general public. Countless museum exhibits pose the question aWhy did they leave?" Much less attention has been devoted to understanding what people did after they abandoned an area or the circumstances that might have encouraged them to move or reorganize.l We ar- gue here that consideration of postabandonment events is essential to an understanding of abandonment pro- cesses and is significant theoretically because it directs focus toward the agency of the people who left. That is, in all but the most extraordinary circumstances, aban- donments probably involve some combination of push" factors that negatively impact people's present circumstances and apull" factors that suggest better possibilities elsewhere. People make the deciszon to leave based on these and other considerations. Aban- donment decisions are made within a social context and have social consequences. Mimbres Regional Reorganization In the 150 years before A.D. 1150 some of the largest early villages in the American Southwest, many with more than one hundred rooms, were built in southwest New Mexico (e.g., Anyon and LeBlanc 1984; Shafer 1991a, 1991b). Although densest in the Mimbres Valley, these large villages are present across southwest New Mexico west of the Rio Grande, and Mimbres remains extend west into easternmost Arizona (the San Simon drainage) and south into northern Mexico (Figure 1). Numerous contemporaneous small sites are also known. In general, Mimbres Classic sites are archae- ologically distinctive in that they have single-story cob- ble masonry rooms, Mimbres Corrugated utility ware, and Mimbres White Ware. Other kinds of pottery are rare. Mimbres White Ware, particularly the latest type (Style III [Brody et al. 1983]), often has highly detailed figurative designs that are unique in the Southwest at this time. Intexpretations of these designs suggest some insights into preabandonment cosmologies. A number of Mimbres designs depict what appear to be scenes from Puebloan mythology and the Puebloan world of the dead (Brody 1977). This imagety, and the associa- tion of many of the figurative pots with burials, has prompted some researchers (e.g., Brody 1977; Crown 1993) to posit a Mimbres acult of the dead" that was con- trolled by a restricted segment of society. In addition, a number of Mimbres designs- including many masked figures, horned serpents, and at least one scene of a be- heading are reminiscent of iconography associated with the repressive civilizations of Mesoamerica. Over- all, the imagery, in the context of large villages, subsis- tence intensification (Herrington 1982), and increasing subsistence stress (Minnis 1985), suggests that fairly stringent social control may have been part of life in MICHELLE HEGMON is an associate professor in the Department of Anthropology, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287.

The Mimbres region and the southern Southwest. , By about 1150, the large Mimbres sites throughout the region were mostly abandoned.4 In the Mimbres Val- ley, ethnobotanical evidence suggests that the abandon- K - - - L ment was associated with resource depletion probably Mimbres Classic villages. Such social control probably is not manifest in economic or material differentiation (Gilman 1990). Instead7 social control may have in- volved unequal relations based on knowledge or ritual power (see Brandt 1994), or it could have been the re- sult of strong horizontal pressure for conformity even in the absence of marked hierarchical relations. The research described here focuses on a region that is east of the Mimbres Valley and southeast of the Reserve-Tularosa area (Figures 24). This area is well preserved archaeologically, and parts of it, particularly along the Palomas drainageX have been intensively and extensively surveyed.2 Prior to 1150, two kinds of Mim- bres Classic sites dominated the settlement pattern in the eastern Mimbres area. A few substantial farming vil- lages (50 to 100 rooms) were present, primarily in the most arable areas along the major drainages, and there are numerous very small sites (three rooms or fewer).3 The small sites often have fairly insubstantial architec- ture (e.g., jacal construction, three-walled rooms, and few domestic features), and they appear to have been occupied intermittently. Thus, they are best interpreted as seasonally used field houses (Nelson 1993b). These field houses may have been used by residents of the larger villages as part of a wide-ranging logistic strategy (see Lekson 1988). Figure 3 Detail of Figure 2. Locations of excavated sites on the lower Palomas Creek.</page><page sequence="3">150 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST * VOL. 100, NO. 1 * MARCH 1998 and also indicative of a continuous occupation (Nelson in press). Finally, there are continuities in the pre- and post-1150 material culture, and new forms of material culture are mixed with the old. While it is certainly pos- sible that some of the residents of the Postclassic ham- lets were new to the region and that there was some in-migration at the individual/household level, any im- migrants would have joined already existing communi- ties. There is no evidence of large community-scale mi- gration (sensu Haury 1958). We refer to this post-1150 occupation, at least in the eastexn Mimbres area, as Postclassic, but not Post- Mimbres. Although carefully selected, this terminology is potentially problematic. Some researchers have ar- gued that the 1150 abandonment resulted in the aban- donment of the Mimbres region and marks the end of the Mimbres sequence.5 Our more recent research, how- ever, demonstrates that populations dispersed within the region, and Mimbres-style pottery and architecture are definitely present in post-1150 contexts (see also Lekson 1992). Work in the southeIn Mimbres Valley is also revealing evidence of occupational continuity (Creel in press). Thus, we argue that the term Mtmbres is applicable to the post-l 150 period. The term Postclas- stc refers to a period following the abandonment of the large villages that were occupied during the Classic period, but it does not imply the end of the Mimbres sequence. Several lines of evidence direct attention to social change as part of the Postclassic regional reorganiza- tion. First, the reorganization involves a move from ag- gregated villages that often housed hundreds of people to dispersed hamlets that contained only a few house- holds. Such a change in scale must have affected social relations; for example, in the small hamlets scalar stress (Johnson 1982) would have been minimal, but mainte- nance of social networks potentially important for risk reduction (Rautman 1993) and mating (Wobst 1974) would have posed other problems. Second, in contrast to the Classic villages, the small Postclassic hamlets have a diverse array of pottery types, as is docu- mented below. These types are associated with many different areas of the southern Southwest, and their presence suggests that the residents of the small ham- lets had established wide-ranging social and economic ties. Finally, although Mimbres-style pottery is clearly found in post-1150 contexts, the iconography possibly associated with social control does not appear to con- tinue after 1150. We investigate some of the social processes in- volved in this regional reorganization through analyses of change and continuity in material culture, specifi- cally domestic architecture (intramural mealing and heating/cooking features) and pottery. Technological style is an important component of these analyses be- cause of its potential to provide information regarding Figure 4 Detail of Figure 2. Locations of excavated sites on the middle Palomas Creek. LA 37690 is the Anderson Site; LA 37691 is the Phelps Site. brought on by intensive farming, population growth, and climate change. Paul Minnis (1985) documents these changes and argues that the inability of village groups to effectively implement changes in human rela- tions and land use was a maJor cause of the abandonment. At about the time the villages were abandoned, new construction occurred on the field houses in the eastern Mimbres area. Many were remodeled into small hamlets (5 to 15 rooms) with substantial masonry construction and a full range of domestic features. Other hamlets were built in new locations. This construction is dated primarily with obsidian hydration and radiocar- bon to the post-l 150 period (see Nelson 1993b). Analyses of subsistence remains and artifacts indicate that the residents of these sites continued to rely heav- ily on cultigens (Nelson and Diehl in press). Architec- tural details indicate that each structure was used inter- mittently over a long period of time, suggesting a pattern of high residential mobility (Nelson in press). Assemblage composition also suggests that some rooms were temporarily abandoned while others were occupied. This pattern of land use is similar to that seen among the Tarahuman (Graharn 1993; Hard arld Meuill 1992). There is strong evidence of occupational continu- ity between the Classic and Postclassic occupations, in- dicating that many of the people who built and used the field houses stayed on in the hamlets (Nelson and Heg- mon n.d.). Specifically, architectural details such as the transformation of jacal into masonry walls indicate that the rooms were remodeled rather than collapsed and built upon.

RUTH 151 population movements or major changes in interac- tion.6 SpeciElcally, technological styles (such as the technology of pottery production or techniques for us- ing a hearth) are probably learned and developed through the course of generations. New styles can cer- tainly be learned, but changes in technology are not usu- ally undertaken casually, especially in traditional socie- ties not spurred on by market forces (Arnold 1985; Cancian 1980). Because pottery and architecture involve different contexts of production and use and may have different degrees of visibility, they can provide complementary kinds of information (see Carr 1995). Architectural fea- tures would be seen only by the people who enter a room, while pottery could be used in various contexts. Built-in domestic features may directly influence or structure daily activities, and they are part of the habi- tus of the built environment (sensu Bourdieu 1977). In contrast, because pottery is often moved and/or ex- changed, it can be a source of information regarding re- gional patterns of interaction (e.g., Habicht-Mauche 1993; Plog 1986). The decoration on pottery may also be part of stylistic traditions that are relatively inde- pendent of technology and that may involve deliberate messaging. In addition, the differences in the architec- tural features that we note would likely influence how they are used, while the differences in the pottery are not likely to affect how vessels can be used technologi- cally. Finally, important differences between the pot- tery and architecture concern their production. That is, architectural features were probably made when the rooms were built, thus their construction was a rela- tively uncommon event; in contrast, pottery production would have been a regular activity. It is likely that women were involved in both the construction of do- mestic features and the production of pottery, although there is some suggestion (Hegmon and Trevathan 1996) that men were also involved in the production, or at least the decoration, of Mimbres White Ware in the Clas- . . S1C perloc L. Pottery Diversity and Technological Style One component of the Mimbres regional reorgani- zation is a major change in the pottery assemblages and the appearance of an array of new types and wares. The analyses presented here are intended to document this change and to investigate patterning that provides clues to the social significance of the change. To what extent was the new pottery a result of movement? Did people adopt new technological styles of pottery production, suggesting that they learned from others already famil- iar with those technological traditions? Or did people copy and adopt new decorative styles, suggesting that they were attempting to establish or symbolize new so- cial ties? The analyses that follow draw data from three sets of contexts. The analysis of traditional tpes and wares is based on tallies from various sites across the eastern Mimbres area (Table 1). Compositional analyses are also summarized to provide information on the sources of the types. The more detailed attribute analyses in- clude only sherds recovered in excavated contexts on four well-studied Classic and Postclassic sites along two drainages in the eastern Mimbres area (Table 2). The architectural analyses, presented in the next sec- tion, include a broader sample from several areas be- cause the eastern Mimbres sites could not provide a suf- ficient sample and because broader comparisons were needed. Types and Wares The change in material culture is well demon- strated by counts of traditional types and wares (Table 1). The pre-1150 Mimbres Classic assemblages from the villages are dominated by Mimbres types; nonlocal pot- tery (i.e., that most closely associated with other re- gions of the Southwest) is rare and constitutes less than 1 percent of the total assemblages or only 1.3 percent of the decorated assemblages. Nonlocal pottery is far more common in the Postclassic assemblages from the farming hamlets; nonlocal types and wares constitute 5 or more percent of the total assemblages and more than 17 percent of the decorated assemblages. These types and wares are scattered across the Postclassic sites, and there is no apparent association of any type of pot- tery with any particular site. Compositional analyses of several of the decorated wares indicate that they were made outside of the east- ern Mimbres area.7 These could have moved through wide-ranging exchange networks, they could have been brought in by people from other regions who moved into the area, and local people might have traveled widely and brought nonlocal goods home. Whatever the specific process, the presence of pottery associated with the west (White Mountain Red Ware, probably from eastern Arizona), the southeast (E1 Paso Poly- chrome from the area around E1 Paso), the south (Pla- yas Red from the southern Mimbres Valley and further south), and east (Chupadero Black-on-White, probably from east of the Rio Grande) on the post-1150 sites clearly indicates that residents of the small hamlets in the eastern Mimbres area participated in extensive re- gional networks. In this way, they were very different from their ancestors in aggregated villages. The movement of pottery through extensive social networks does not necessarily account for all of the nonlocal pottery in the eastern Mimbres area; it is also</page><page sequence="5">Nonlocal Nonlocal Nonlocal typesa as % of as % of decoratedb total Classic sites Anderson siteC CHUP 0.6 CWW EPB R/T RTCor Las Animas Villaged EPB 1.3 0.5 JP (N = 2088) (N = 12037) WMR Postclassic sites Phelps sitee CHUP 24.6 12.6 CWW (N = 126) (N = 2198) EPB EPP RTCor WMR LA 37728f CHUP 17.4 4.9 CWW (N = 92) (N = 680) EPB EPP Playas RTCor WMR LA 37726/27f CHUP 35.9 5.5 CWVV (N = 287) (N = 2385) EPB EPP Playas RTCor RedCorr WMR a CHUP = Chupadero Black-on-White, CWW = Cibola White Ware, EPB = E1 Paso Brown, EPP = El Paso Polychrome, JP= Jomadapainted (red-on-brown orpolychrome), Playas = Playas Red, RedCorr = Red Corrugated, RF = miscellaneous/unidenti- fied red-on-terra-cotta, RTCor= Reserve/Tularosa corrugated, WMR = White Mountain Red Ware. b Decorated categoxy includes painted and/or slipped types, total includes decorated and undecorated. c Gilrnan and Mills 1984; Nelson et al. 1984.

Petrographic analyses indicate that a substantial portion of this ware was made locally (Hegmon et al. n.d.). Thus, the technological style asso- ciated with the Reserve-Tularosa region was somehow imported into the eastern Mimbres area. The new tech- nological style may have been brought by people from the north moving into the area (possibly as small house- holds or as a result of intermarriage). In addition, east- ern Mimbres residents may have developed close ties with people to the north and thus learned their techno- logical style. In either case, the presence of a new, lo- cally used technological style is indicative of intensive social interaction involving shared learning contexts and possibly the movement of people. Attribute Analyses In order to further our understanding of the nature of social interaction between the eastern Mimbres area and the Reserve-Tularosa region to the north, we focus on the white wares, speciElcally Mimbres and Cibola White Ware.8 Mimbres White Ware was made in a number of locations across the Mimbres region (Gilman et al. 1994; James et al. 1995), including in the eastern Mimbres area. Cibola White Ware is fairly common in the Reserve-Tularosa region, but it was probably made further to the north (i.e., approximately 100 kilometers from Palomas Creek) on the southern Colorado Plateau (Burton and Simon 1993; Zedeno 1994:72). These two decorated wares were selected to complement the analysis of utility wares summarized above, because both were present before and after the 1150 abandon- ment and reorganization, and especially because we had noted that some white ware specimens had charac- teristics of both, suggesting that the two technological styles were combined. Several technological attributes traditionally differentiate Mimbres and Cibola White Wares. Sherd temper appears in Cibola but not in Mim- bres, and white slip appears on the interior and exterior of bowls, which is common on Cibola ware but not on Mimbres. The slip was generally polished on Cibolapottery 152 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST * VOL. 100, NO. 1 * MARCH 1998 Table 1 Frequency of nonlocal pottery (sherds) on eastern Mimbres Classic and Postclassic sites. Table 2 Frequency of eastern Mimbres pottery (sherds) with combination of Mimbres and Cibola technological attributes.a</page><page sequence="6">MIMBRES ABANDONMENT / MICHELLE HEGMON MARGARET C. NELSON AND SUSAN M. RUTH 153 and the designs then added, whereas Mimbres pottery is usually polished primarily on the paint. Oxidation re- sulting in a red-on-white color is more common on Mim- bres than on Cibola. The two wares also have different styles of painted designs, although the differences can- not often be discerned on sherds and therefore are not considered in detail here. Clearly, pottery traditions are not isomorphic with cultures," and general material culture similarity does not correlate directly with social interaction (see Heg- mon 1992:52S527; Plog 1978). When contrasted with the pre-1150 homogeneity, however, the appearance of new kinds of pottery or new pottery technologies is likely to be culturally signiElcant, and analyses of the particular attributes that change or appear can provide information regarding some social processes. There- fore, we recorded a series of attributes regarding pro- duction technology and design style including paste and slip color, presence and extent of slip and polish, and presence of various design elements. These data can be used to consider the nature of eastern Mimbres social interaction and examine change between the Classic and the Postclassic periods. The most striking conclusion is the fact that most (99 percent) of the sherds fit the traditional ware defini- tions; that is, they have only Cibola characteristics or only Mimbres characteristics. Thus the technological styles associated with the two white wares remained mostly distinct throughout the Classic and Postclassic periods. This distinctiveness was maintained at the same time the northern corrugated style was adopted in the eastern Mimbres area. The small sample of sherds (N - 24) that do not fit the ware definitions provides additional information. None of these sherds are conJoinable; they came from various contexts on different sites, and it is likely that they represent vessels made by a number of different potters. Thus, although the sample is small, it is likely to be culturally meaningful. The majority (15/24) of these sherds have a dark Mimbres-like paste but a Cibola-like finish, including a highly polished slip and matte paint; some also have sherd temper, another Cibola character- istic. Overall, these attributes indicate that at least 24 vessels were made by people familiar with both Mim- bres and Cibola technological styles. In addition, the relative frequencies of these sherds provides informa- tion on changing social processes. In the Classic Mim- bres assemblages, both Cibola White Ware and sherds with combinations of attributes are rare and constitute less than 1 percent of the assemblage; the Mimbres technological tradition appears to be relatively distinct (Table 2). In the later assemblages, sherds with a combination of attributes are significantly more common (10 percent). Interpretation of the designs is hindered by the fact that many of the same elements are used in both Cibola and Mimbres designs, and the distinctive design charac- teristics often cannot be identiEled on sherds. There is no evidence that eastern Mimbres residents copied northern designs, but we cannot rule out this possibil- ity. None of the sherds with combined technological styles, however, have typically Mimbres designs (such as multiple rim lines or anthropomorphic elements), suggesting that any messages expressed by the Mimbres designs may not have been relevant to the growing in- teractions with the north. Domestic Features and the Built Environment Evidence of changes in the built environment pro- vides an important complement to the analysis of pot- tery in understanding the processes of abandonment and reorganization. These changes are manifested by differences in the domestic features found in the Clas- sic Mimbres villages and the Postclassic hamlets. The focus here is on domestic features that are present in sufficient quantities to facilitate comparative analysis. The primary database for the architectural analysis is from six excavated sites in the eastern Mimbres area, all located along the Palomas Creek; pottery from three of the sites was included in the attribute analysis.9 All of these sites were Postclassic farming hamlets; at least four were initially occupied as Classic Mimbres field houses. Within the six sites, 18 rooms, dated to the post- 1150 period, have evidence of domestic features. Their contemporaneity is indicated by the wall constIuction patterns, ceramic assemblage composition, and radio- carbon and obsidian hydration dates (Nelson 1993b). The domestic features of these Postclassic hamlets are compared with those from preceding Classic Mim- bres villages and with those from substantial villages in the Reserve-Tularosa area to the north, specifically from the Pine Lawn Valley. The latter, Tularosa Phase villages, were selected because they are organization- ally similar to the Classic Mimbres villages but possibly contemporary with or immediately subsequent to the Postclassic eastern Mimbres hamlets; the Tularosa Phase villages have predominantly Cibola White Ware pottery. Data from these Tularosa Phase villages pro- vide a basis for determining if the differences between large Classic Mimbres villages and small Postclassic hamlets are best understood as temporal or structural phenomena. Classic Mimbres domestic features in the eastern Mimbres area are not well known. Most of the Classic sites are field houses with few or no features, and many of the larger villages have been badly looted. Classic Mimbres architecture, however, is well known in the Mimbres Valley. Therefore, data for this study are drawn from 27 rooms in two extensively excavated and</page><page sequence="7">154 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST * VOL. 100, NO. 1 * MARCH 1998 reported Mimbres Valley sites, the Galaz and NAN Ruins (AnyonandLeBlanc 1984; Shaferl990, 1991a, 1991b). What information is available on Classic Mimbres fea- tures in eastern Mimbres residential sites is also in- cluded. These eastern Mimbres Classic data are from a total of five rooms at three sites, specifically IjA 37726, Anderson Pueblo, and Las Animas Village. 10 These rooms are similar to those in the Mimbres Valley. Addi- tional comparative architectural data are drawn from three Tularosa Phase villages, all constructed in the late 1100s or early 1200s. Domestic Features Only four kinds of domestic features occur consis- tently within rooms in the sites included in this study: hearths, mealing facilities, storage pits, and post de- pressions. The latter two vary little in form and are not discussed here. Hearths and mealing facilities occur in many rooms and vary within sites, among sites, and among regions. Hearths include any areas within rooms in which wood was burned, apparently for heating and/or cooking. Mealing facilities are built by setting bowls into floors, constructing platforms, and/or plac- ing slabs in the floor to delimit the facility. Metate rests (and sometimes manos and metates) are evident in these mealing facilities. Most rooms have only one hearth and one grinding feature. Feature remodeling was rare, and in only one case was the form of a Post- classic feature (a hearth) changed as a result of remod- eling. Most hearths and mealing features are found in- side rooms; thus differences between the periods and areas cannot be attributed to changes in the locations of features. In order to explore technological traditions and patterns of variation across the sites and areas, a series of variables was used to characterize the features. We distinguished six different hearth forms and six differ- ent mealing facility forms based on characteristics that would have been visible when the features were in use (Table 3). The hearth forms are differentiated according to shape, presence of rocks or slabs, and presence of adobe collars. The mealing facilities have different numbers of bowl depressions and variable platforms, collars, and slab dividers. Hearth forms are quite homogeneous in the large Classic Mimbres and Tularosa Phase villages (Figure 5). Nearly every hearth on these sites is square or rectangu- lar and most are lined with slabs.l2 Hearths in Classic Mimbres rooms from residential villages in the eastern Mimbres area are similarly standardized although of a different form; all five are oval and adobe lined. In con- trast, the small Postclassic eastern Mimbres hamlets have a variety of forms, including those seen in the large villages as well as new forms. Adobe collared hearths are most common, but still comprise only 50 percent of the sample; four other forms are present as well. These various forms are not site specific; five of the six sites have two or more different forms. Variation in mealing facility form follows a similar pattern (Figure 5). The large Classic Mimbres villages lack formal grinding facilities; where metates are pres- ent they appear to have been placed directly on the floor without an associated fixture. Tularosa Phase villages either lack formal mealing facilities or have slab-lined bins with space for one to three metates, with or with- out adobe collars surrounding bowl depressions. In contrast, the Postclassic hamlets in the eastern Mim- bres area have various forms of grinding features with various numbers of bowl depressions and different combinations of platforms, collars, and slab dividers. Only one site lacks an intramural built-in grinding facility Table 3 Variables coded for the hearths and mealing facilities.

Some of the eastern Mimbres forms are similar to the Tularosa Phase forms, others appear to be innovations not clearly associated with other areas. The Postclassic increase in feature diversity ap- pears to parallel changes in the pottery assemblages. Before the architectural variation can be interpreted in social terms, however, its relationship to room and fea- ture use must be assessed (see Ciolek-Torrello 1985; Lowell 1995). Because all of the Postclassic features are from small residential hamlets, we assume the variabil- ity cannot be explained in terms of differences in site function. All but two of the rooms considered in this study are classiEled as residential (i.e., they are fully en- closed and have domestic features). The two excep- tions, both from the Tularosa Phase pueblos, are identi- fied as above-ground kivas and are assumed to have been used ritually (Martin et al. 1956). These possible kivas have the same hearth and mealing facility forms as the other Tularosa Phase rooms, suggesting that feature form does not vary directly with room function.

Room size may relate to feature use and form in various ways. Room size is associated with factors such as household size, the organization of activities, and the availability of construction materials. In turn, hearth size and form may be related to the size of the space that must be heated, the number of people who use the hearth, or the size of the group for which food must be prepared. Similarly, grinding-feature size and form may be related to the size of a group, the organization of grinding, and the number of people for whom food must be ground. The association of hearth form and room size (converted into a ranked variable) is shown in Ta- ble 4; for cells in which marginal totals are sufficiently large, observed and expected values differ very little and there is no statistically significant association (X2 = 11.40, d.f. = 6, p &gt; 0.05). The lack of relationship be- tween hearth size and room size is shown in Figure 6. Both the small and the large rooms have various sizes of hearths. Similarly, hearth form is not related to hearth size.l3 There is some association between mealing-facility form and room size, although the pattern primarily re- flects areal differences. Mimbres Valley Classic rooms tend to be small and lack grinding features (Form A); Tularosa Phase rooms tend to have large rooms with slab-lined features (Forms F and G).

It is possible that variation in the form of the two features may be related, either functionally or as a re- sult of technological traditions. We have already dem- onstrated consistency in feature forms in the Mimbres Classic and Tularosa Phase villages. At issue here is the possible association of forms of the two features in the Table 5 The relationship between grinding-facility form and room size (floor area) on the eastern Mimbres Postclassic sites. highly variable sample from the eastern Mimbres Post- classic hamlets. The relationship is shown in Table 6, and no association is evident, although the sample is too small to evaluate statistically. The various analyses presented above fail to ex- plain variation in hearth and grinding-facility form in terms of room use or other apparently functional char- acteristics. Rather, the high degree of variation in do- mestic features apparent in the eastern Mimbres Post- classic hamlets contrasts with the homogeneity of features in the earlier Mimbres Classic villages and the contemporaneous Tularosa Phase villages to the north. The residents of the Postclassic eastern Mimbres ham- lets made and used the Classic Mimbres forms, the Tu- larosa forms, and various other forms, all in various combinations. This diversity of feature forms parallels similar patterns apparent in the pottery assemblages and the attributes of black-on-white pottery.

NELSON AND SUSAN M. RUTH 157 Table 6 The relationship between grinding-facility and hearth form on the eastern Mimbres Postclassic sites. the eastern Mimbres area contrast with the homogeneity in the large Classic Mimbres and Tularosa Phase vil- lages. This large-village homogeneity could have been created by the imposition of an expectation of conform- ity and/or by a stable social and learning context. While we do not wish to argue that the styles of features or pottery should be read as indicators of Ua culture,S' it is reasonable to expect that people use or interpret simi- lar styles to indicate sameness at some level (see Wiess- ner 1983). Thus the new diversity of feature forms and pottery in the Postclassic hamlets suggests that the change in settlement involved significant social reor- ganization following the abandonment of the Classic Mimbres villages. This reorganization could have in- volved a number of components. The movement out of large Classic period villages probably involved a breakdown of existing social rela- tionships, and the absence of large villages or ritual cen- ters across the eastern Mimbres area during the Post- classic suggests that there was no single, unified, organizational structure. Instead, it is likely that the residents of the Postclassic hamlets would have estab- lished or maintained extensive regional or interregional social networks or alliances for various reasons includ- ing insurance against subsistence shortfalls, mating, and ritual responsibilities (see Rautman 1993; Wobst 1974). The presence of variously distributed imported pottery in the Postclassic hamlets is evidence of interre- gional circulation of goods through such extensive net- works. More intensive social ties are also indicated by the existence of new technological styles of domestic features and of pottery. The similarity of these new styles to those found in the Reserve-Tularosa area to the north suggest ties were particularly strong with this area, though interaction with other areas is certainly not precluded. The specific characteristics of architectural con- struction and pottery production provide additional in- sights. The architectural features on the Postclassic hamlets show little evidence of remodeling; the new forms were built when the rooms were constructed shortly after 1150. Thus, the people who built the ham- lets created and maintained an architectural diversity that contrasted with the homogeneity of the large vil- lages. Traditional forms from the Classic villages and from other regions were combined and new forms were added as old rules of conformity were cast aside and a new way of life was established. Some of the pottery found in the Postclassic ham- lets must have been made during the length of time the sites were occupied and thus can be intexpreted in terms of ongoing social processes. At least two techno- logical styles were used to make corrugated pottery, one associated with the region to the north and the other local. The detailed analysis of the white ware is particularly important for understanding the applica- tion of different technological styles. Specifically, white ware that combines traditional Cibola and Mimbres technological styles is rare in the pre-1150 period and becomes more common in the Postclassic. The pres- ence of pottery made with a combination of technologi- cal styles indicates that potters schooled in different traditions were learning from each other and/or that new potters were learning and combining aspects of both traditions. Thus, any group distinctions that might have been associated with different technological tradi- tions were being dissolved in the Postclassic hamlets. It is reasonable to expect that most of the features and pottery we consider here were made and used pri- marily by women. Granting this assumption means that the Postclassic diversity of technological styles was produced by women from a variety of backgrounds and by women who were learning and combining new styles. This process has implications regarding gender rela- tions, particularly if women (some of whom may have moved into the area) were maintaining their own net- works independent of men. Consideration of the local context provides a different, although not contradictory, perspective. Domestic ar- chitecture creates a context for day-to-day interaction</page><page sequence="11">158 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST * VOL. 100, NO. 1 * MARCH 1 998 that may involve or be reinforced by pottery and other movable items. UTechnological styles are not merely tradition-bound choices arbitrarily selected from a range of all possible solutions," they are guided by atti- tudes and values and are "central to meaningful action" (Dobres and Hoffman 1994:21S219). As Polly Wiessner (1983) notes in her study of projectile point forms used in southern Africa, people responded to unfamiliar forms by expressing their discomfort with the potential behavior of the makers; they stated that they would not know how to predict the behavior of those who make forms different from their own. The use of standardized material culture in the large villages may have been a vi- sual indication of conformity. Such symbolic marking may have been less important in small hamlets. Whether the diversity of hearth and mealing forms across the Postclassic hamlets involved a rejection of rules of con- formity and/or the establishment of multidirectional al- liances, it also would have been a daily reminder to the residents that they do not share basic styles and tech- nologies. If Wiessner's (1983) experiences apply to this archaeological context, the technological and stylistic diversity may have created a sense of unease, a sense of the unpredictability of others, reinforcing the need to direct one's interaction outward from the hamlet. How can such a social situation be understood? The answer may lie in two strategies important to the success of small horticultural communities in an arid environ- ment. The first, discussed above, is the maintenance of far-reaching interregional networks. The second strategy is residential mobility. Fre- quent movement is indicated by artifactual and archi- tectural analyses (Nelson in press). Among the residen- tially mobile Tarahumara agriculturalists, houses in a village are not all occupied at the same time and com- munity composition varies annually and through the an- nual cycle (Graham 1993; Hard and Merrill 1992). If the Tarahumara case is a reasonable analog, we should ex- pect that intrasite community coherence was not an im- portant aspect of life in the Postclassic hamlets. In- stead, small groups (often nuclear families, in the case of the Tarahumara) would have been the basic unit of mobility, and each may have maintained different net- works and alliances. Thus, after 1150 communities may have been much more far-reaching and less bounded than before. Conclusions: Abandonment and Reorganization Archaeologists have tended to focus on the causes and processes of abandonmente Less often are the so- cial consequences of movement, resettlement, and reor- ganization considered, even though expectations of these consequences may have been part of people's de- cision to abandon an area. Movement is integzal to Native American land use in the Southwest and is an important theme in native histoxies (NaranJo 1995). Communities reorganize, and people may even redefine who they are. New contexts of face-to-face interaction are created and influence the processes of community formation and continuity. These aspects of abandonment have been the focus of our analysis. We suggest that the processes of social change that accompany village abandonment may be understood at some level through the analysis of the social relations that developed at the new settlements. The reorganiza- tion in the eastern Mimbres area after the abandonment of the Classic Mimbres villages involved more than a change in settlement patterns; it invoked changes in re- gional and interregional social relationships. Prior to 1150 the entire region appeared to have a strong UMim- bres focus," with a homogeneous material culture. At least in the Mimbres Valley this focus may have involved the fairly strong social control necessary to organize large aggregates of people and cope with the increas- ingly over-exploited environment. They made beautiful pottery, but their lives may have been fairly difElcult. Af- ter the large villages were abandoned and populations dispersed, community and regional relations were rede- filned. Networks and alliances expanded, as is indicated by the presence of imported material, new technolo- gies, and the mixing of previously discrete traditions. Materially homogeneous Classic Mimbres villages, in- dicative of a strong sense of community, were replaced by small hamlets with a high degree of material diver- sity. This diversity, combined with evidence for high residential mobility, suggests that community might have been deElned at a broader and less restrictive level. Notes Acknowledgments.

NELSON, AND SUSAN M. RUTH 159 2. Survey along the Palomas drainage is described by Lek- son (1984, 1989) and Nelson (1986, 1989, 1993a). 3. Well-documented large sites include Las Animas Village (Hegmon and Nelson 1994; Nelson and Hegmon 1993, 1995), the Garfield site on the Rio Grande (Mayo 1994), and the Anderson site along the Palomas (Nelson et al. 1984). 4. Although the Mimbres abandonment is not precisely dated, what chronological data are available suggest that the abandonment began by around 1130 and was mostly complete by 1150 (Anyon et al. 1981). However, see Creel n.d. 5. This argument was previously made by one of us (Nelson 1981) and has also been made by Anyon et alia (1981), Le- Blanc (1989), and Shafer (1990). 6. The concept of technological style in archaeology was first proposed by Lechtman (1977) and has recently been developed by Lemonnier (1992) and Stark (in press). Stark et alia (1995) and Zedeno (1994) use the concept in studies of migration and interaction. 7. Compositional data are summarized by Creel et alia (1995). Specifically, there is strong evidence that the E1 Paso Polychrome was manufactured in the southern part of the Jornada region. The best evidence for the production of Chu- padero Black-on-White is from the area east of the Rio Grande. While the source of the Chupadero found in the Mimbres region is not well established, it is unlikely that it was made in either the Mimbres Valley or the eastern Mim- bres area. Playas Red Ware was probably made in the south- ern portion of the Mimbres region and in areas further to the south, but not in the eastern Mimbres area. The White Moun- tain Red Ware found on eastern Mimbres sites has not been subjected to compositional analysis, but it is assumed to have been imported because it occurs in only very small quantities and is macroscopically indistinguishable from typical exam- ples in eastern Arizona (Carlson 1970). 8. Mimbres White Ware is described by Hawley (1936:62, 104) and by Brody et alia (1983); Cibola White Ware is de- scribed by Martin and Rinaldo (1950:502-503), by Reid et alia (1995), and by Rinaldo and Bluhm (1956:177-180). Mimbres White Ware is sometimes given an end date of 1150 (e.g., Anyon et al. 1981; Shafer and Brewington 1995), but this is primarily because of its strong association with sites that were abandoned by 1150. At least in the eastern Mimbres area it has been found in well-dated post-1150 contexts (Nelson n.d.). The Cibola White Ware on the eastern Mimbres sites is primarily Reserve Black-on-White (ca. 1100-1200) and Tu- larosa Black-on-White (ca. 1200-1300) (dates according to Reid et al. 1995) although the distinction between the two types is subtle and often cannot be made with sherds. 9. The three sites on the middle Palomas (LA 37726/27, LA 37728) and the Phelps Site (LA 37691) are described in Nelson and Hegmon 1993, 1995 and Hegmon and Nelson 1994. The three sites on the Lower Palomas (LA 45103, LA 70258 and LA 70259) are described in Nelson in press. 10. LA 27726 is described by Hegmon and Nelson (1994) and Nelson and Hegmon (1995, 1996), Anderson Pueblo by Nelson et alia (1984), and Las Animas Village by Hegmon and Nelson (1994) and Nelson and Hegmon (1993, 1995). 11. Specifically, the data are from five rooms in the 40- to 50-room Apache Creek Pueblo (Martin et al. 1957), from two rooms in the 23- to 25-room Valley View Pueblo (Martin et al. 1957), and from five rooms in the 30-room (or more) Higgins Flat Pueblo (Martin et al. 1956). All of the rooms in these samples are from single-story structures. 12. The larger proportion of hearths without slab lining in the Tularosa Phase sample reflects a lack of data on construc- tion details; in cases where the reports were unclear regard- ing slab lining, slabs were coded as absent. 13. A chi-square analysis of the association between hearth form and size yielded a probability of greater than 0.05 that the variables are independent.
