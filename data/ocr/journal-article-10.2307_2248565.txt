<plain_text><page sequence="1">VIII.-PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. Vol. xv., No. 1. W. Fite. 'The Experience- Philosophy.' [The fundamental proposition of the experience-philosophy (that experience and it alone is 'given' or ' immediately given') is its fundamental error: the thing in space and time is as good a datum as experience; neither is an absolute datum; and the search for absolute data is illusory and logically unnecessary.] G. H. Sabine. 'fHume's Contribution to the Historical Method.' [Any theory tending to the recognition of the intilnacy of the social relation is also indirectly a contribution to the growth of the historical method. Here Hume's merit is unmistakable: his view of the social nature of the individual and of the organic structure of society is far more adequate than that of the bulk of his contemporaries. His direct contribution is, naturally, less clear; though he did good service by directing attention, in his History, chiefly toward manners and customs.] W. B. Pitkin. 'The Self-Transcendency of Knowledge.' [A plea for differentiation of terms. The self-transcendency of knowledge is used at present to mean the onflowing of experience towards an unknown; the experiencing of things not ' here,' i.e., temporally or spatially remote ; the non-deducible char- acter of the order and way in which new contents appear; the excess of meaning over process; the representative or symnbolical function of experience ; the superiority of concept to percept.] Discussion.

Notices of New Books. Summaries of Articles. Notes. Vol. xv., No. 2. J. Dewey. 'Beliefs and Realities.' [The writer first outlines the con- ception of the 'common man,' that beliefs are real, and manifest their reality in the usual way, by modifying and shaping the reality of other real things. He then sketches the history of thought, showing how beliefs have been subjected to preconceived notions of knowledge and of reality as its monopolistic possession. Thirdly, he traces some of the motifs which make for reconsideration of the supposed uniquely exclusive relation of logical knowledge and reality. Finally, he seeks to prove that the pragmatic point of view unites the fullest acknowledgment of moral powers and demands with thoroughgoing naturalism.] F. Thilly. ' Psychology, Natural Science, and Philosophy.' [Rejects various argu- ments in favour of making psychology a natural science: that mind may be studied in connexion with matter, that the mental series of itself does not form a continuous line, that psychology employs scientific arguments. On the other hand, psychology is indispensable to philosophical studies, while there is no absolutely presuppositionless psychology.] H. H. Bawden. ' Evolution and the Absolute.'

Special problems: (1) Logic as science and as art. " It is the descriptive and explanatory aspect of logic that constitutes its scientific character, while it is the specific normative aspect that con- stitutes its logical character. . .. The actual methodology of the sciences is logic as art." (2) Logic and psychology are coordinate. (3) Logic is purely a science of evidential values, not a science of content, as are the natural sciences and metaphysics.] W. R. Wright. 'Some Effects of Incentives on Work and Fatigue.' [Ergographical experiments. More work is done when a task is set than when no definite aim is proposed. Known inability to fulfil prescribed conditions decreases the total work. Fatigue is less when a task is set, though the output of work is greater.] Discussion. L King. 'The Problem of the Subconscious.' [The sub- conscious is not diun consciousness; not something psychic, but not self-conscious; it is rather a mass of physical (neural) dispositions, tensions, actual processes, which are in some degree organised,-the remnants of habits and experiences which have either lapsed from consciousness or have never penetrated to the central plexus.] J. B Pratt. ' The Place and Value of the Marginal Region in Psychic Life.' [Ideation and sensation are small islands, bathed in the sea of vital feeling. This sea extends from the subconscious up to maximal differ- entiation, and is in a state of spontaneous turmoil, constantly throwing up products of all sorts on the shores of the clearer consciousness. It represents the primary form of consciousness; gives value to life; de- termines character and personality.] AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY. Vol. xvii., No. 1. C. EBrowne. 'The Psychology of the Simple Arithmetical Processes: a Study of Certain Habits of Attention and Association.' [A study of the processes involved in addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division, both as written exercises and as mental arithmetic. As the title shows, the author lays chief emphasis upon the functions of association and of selective attention, though full introspective reports of imagery, feelings, etc., are included. In many cases the analysis can only be regarded as preliminary; but the report is so detailed that future work may begin where the present study leaves off.] S. I. Franz. ' The Time of Some Mental Processes in the Retardation and Excitement of Insanity.' [Ex- periments on rate of tapping, simple and compound reactions, adding, discriminating and marking letters, etc. Excited patients show no con- sistent increase of speed as compared with normal or depressed patients: the maniacal condition is one of increased motor diffusion, not of increased motor ability. Retarded patients are slow at the beginning of all series, but the retardation is not regular. Retarded patients are susceptible to practice. Only in a few cases are the average variations greater for the insane than for normal subjects.] A. F. Chamberlain. 'Acquisition of Written Language by Primitive Peoples.'

Ferree.</page><page sequence="3">PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. 283 'An Experimental Examination of the Phenomena usually attributed to Fluctuation of Attention.' [Liminal pressure and electro-cutaneous stimuli give no fluctuation. The intermittences of sensation resulting from minimal visual stilnuli or stimulus-differences are explained as adaptation phenomena somewhat obscured by the special conditions. Adaptation is in itself a continuous phenomenon, but its continuity is interfered with by eye-movements, blinking, etc. The theory is sup- ported by a wide range of observations, and by elaborate experiments with variation of intensity and area of the stimuli.] DM F.

[An analysis of the complex combinations of rhythms found in the music of the Malays of Sarawak, and showing that, whereas modern music has developed complexities of harmony, primitive music is char- acterised by complexity of rhythm and rests on the possibility of apprehending 'relatively long periods filled with measures of diverse length . . . as an organic whole or "phrase".'] James Ward.

Miiller, inakes it probable that black is not a positive sensation.] W. M'Dougall. ' The Illusion of the " Fluttering Heart " and the Visual Functions of the Rods of the Retina.' [The term 'fluttering heart' covers two different illusions, which ought to be distinguished. One of these illusions is observed in bright light only, and its explanation is physical, viz., difference in the refrangibility of the light-rays employed. The other illusion is observed in dim light only, and with dark-adapted eye, and nmust be explained with Von Kries as due to the fact that the rods respond to stimulation more slowly than the cones. This supports the theory that the rods are a special apparatus for vision in dim light, and if so, it is an argument in favour of Helmholtz as against Hering's Theory of Vision.] W. M'Dougall.

'Le Prejuge intellectualiste et le Prejuge finaliste dans les theories de l'expression.' [The expression of our various sentiments is essentially a biological fact and can be ex- plained by the variations of the muscular tonus and innervation in a very much clearer and simpler way than through psychology. M. Dumas criticises two main tendencies in the theory of expression, i.e., the finalist tendency as represented by Darwin, and the intellectualist one as re- presented by Wundt. Opposed to both, he holds he has succeeded in explaining clinically and experimentally, from the physiological point of view, the expression of joy, of sadness, of anger, and of fear.] H. Luquet. ' R6flexion et Introspection.' [In psychology the aim of reflective consciousness is to discover the identical under the diverse: it endeavours to form a scientific representation of the inner world, copied from that of the external world, and this kind of artificial know- ledge is intended to serve practical purposes, as it does in objective sciences. Introspection, on the contrary, is disinterested, and its aim is to find again the differences under the common characters, to reach the immediate data of consciousness in their original fluency, spontaneity, and purity. Its nature is sesthetic rather than scientific. Science sub- stitutes symbols for the datum; art alone tries to apprehend it in its reality for us. Reflective or scientific psychology is incomplete and therefore false, and must needs be completed by the introspective psy- chology. A valuable contribution to the study of method in psychology.] G.

The author summarises the mnain results of his careful study in the following psychological and philosophical conclusions: Visceral sensa- tions are the essential element in emotions. The feeling of concrete duration is nothing else but visceral sensibility. " La duree viscerale " is to be distinguished from " le temps intellectual infini " and from " la durde sensori-motrice ". Inclination is possible without any emotion whatever.

The elementary functions of know- ledge (perception, memory, and association of representations), its com- plex manifestations (imagination, judgment, general notions), and the atrophy of altruistic feelings, as they appear in this " distinctly morbid passion," are carefully and clearly described and analysed by a physician who is also a psychologist.] G. Prevost. 'La Religion du doute.'</page><page sequence="7">PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. 287 [Doubt about all the revealed religions is the main characteristic of our time. But is it not possible to lay on this very doubt the foundation of a kind of religion which would not abolish the positive religions, but rather include them and even lead to higher moral consequences ? M. G. Prevost undertakes this task and delineates what he calls the religion of doubt. His leading ideas, in which the reader will recognise both a very old doctrine of a noble inspiration, and an uncritical attitude of mind, are the following: God should be conceived as the necessary ground of all, and the unknowable Infinite. The existence of the human soul has had no beginning and shall have no end; we have lived anterior lives of which we have vague reminiscences, and in the continuity of its future lives the soul will probably pass, by personal, intellectual and moral endeavour, into more perfect states. The modern ideas of evolu- tion and the recent theory of matter are advocated by the author as confirmative of his general views. Meanwhile, certainty in the know- ledge of our destiny would eradicate in man the desire and the merit of action: doubt is the greatest gift for mankind. The author holds it possible to build up on the basis of his principles an ethics of a practical and very high character which shall afford an adequate sanction to our sentiment of justice.] Revue Generale: G.

'Ein Fall von Ueberlegung beim Hund ?' [Case of supposed reflection on the ground of general experience (licking frost off a window pane) in a dog.] J. Segal. 'Die Bewusste Selbsttauschung als Kern des asthetischen Geniessens: eine kritische Betrachtung.' [Critique of Conrad. (1) Methodological. Two experiences which have opposite names (e.g., agreeableness and disagreeableness) need not consist of precisely opposite mental contents; and to explain sthetic pleasure we must have recourse, not to a single complex and unanalysed process, but to the elementary processes into which by analysis the total attitude may be resolved. (2) Psychological. As a matter of fact, we have no consciousness of self-illusion in testhetio contemplation; moreover, it is not true that the greater the illusion the greater is the sesthetic pleasure.] E. Duerr. ' Zur Frage der Wertbestimmung.' [Critique of Kreibig, Meinong, von Ehrenfeir, Cohn. "Wert ist jede Lust und alles, worauf unsere Lustgefiuhle sich beziehen in der eigenartigen Weise, die wir meinen, wenn wir von einer Richtung des Geftihls auf Objekte spre- chen." Five types of this reference are provisionally distinguished.] F. Kiesow. 'Ueber einige geometrischoptische Tauschungen.' [Notes on some rectilinear illusions of variable extent, which are made to lead up to the Miiller-Lyer illusion. Contrast and perspective are subordinate inoments; the explanation must be sought pre-eminently in the motor rnechanism of the eye.] L. Botti. 'Eimi Beitrag zur Kennntis der variablen geometrisch-optischen Streckentguschungen.' [A parallel in- vestigation to that of the previous paper, dealing with divided lines, filled an empty space, filled rectangles, etc. Same conclusion as before.] G. Stoerring. ' Experimentelle Beitrage zur Lehre vom Gefuhl.' [(1) Distinction of sensory pleasantness and pleasantness of mood or disposi- tion: the former attaches to the stimulus complex (taste), the latter spreads over the whole consciousness; the former is attended by quick- ening, the latter by slowing of respiration. (2) Pneumographic curves of unpleasantness are distinguished by diminution of the average value of the quotient obtained by dividing length of inspiration by length of expiration. (3) Dynamometrical experiments, aimed to trace the re- lation between feeling and external voluntary action, show that un- pleasant feelings may be a direct motive to action.] F. Kiesow. ' Ueber sogenannte "frei steigende" Vorstelluingen und pldtzlich auftretende Aenderungen des Gemtitszustandes. Sind die Verbindungsglieder, welche hierbei in Frage kommen, unbewusst oder unbemerkt?' [Concludes that there is, in all probability, no reproduction without association; that sudden changes of mood are also mentally motivated; and that the connecting links are unremarked or unnoticed, not unconscious. An interesting and valuable paper; but written with a triviality of circum- stance that renders it unnecessarily long.] W. Ament.

Naturalistic m-iethods based on a spiritual principle ultimately reduced to mere appearance; whereas a more philosophical investigation disentangles the spiritual life from the empirical and sensuous and shows that it is a living, in- dependent reality. It functions and preserves itself in experience giving that its meaning and drawing it over to itself. The Reich ideeler Grissen not merely existing in reflexion, but an actual and increasingly conscious power in the governing of life. In dealing with logic, ethics and religion we have nothing to do with a naturalistic Betrachtung von unten, but grasp teleological necessities deriving from a triumphant spiritual reality.] D. Adolf Muler. 'Quellen und Ziele sittlicher Entwickelung' (Schluss). [Deals with the question of evil and the problemn of develop- ment.] Dr. Ernst Schwarz. 'Uber Phantasiegefuhle.' [These not identical with weak serious-feelings, but qualitatively different. Wundt is wrong in holding that they precede the imaginary presentation: they are rather coincident with it. They do not, like weak feelings, have the power of strengthening dispositions of feeling.] Anna Tumarkin. ' Bericht uiber die deutsche asthetische Literatur aus den Jabren 1900-5, iii.'

' Die Grundlagen des nattirlichen Monismus bei Karl Christian Planck' (Schluss). [Deals principally with Planck's ethical doctrine. Morality is conscious unity with the universal law and end of the world-the law of Concentration. The highest possible creation is man-or some similar being-a central point formally governing the external world, in which the real uncon- ditional-materiality with all its forces--has created-as spirit the formally unconditional. To round things off it only remains to make mankind a perfect organism, and to do so we must have collectivism. The external, mechanical idea of the state must give place to the berufs- genossenschaftliche Selbstvervaltung. But morality has no extra-human aspect, after all, since man remains in opposition to Nature; religious conceptions are banished, and his life is made a mere sportful product of eternally parturient Nature.] W.

[Deals, so far, only with the philosophers of the seventeenth century, omitting Spinoza, and explaining at length to what extent Leibniz in particular applied mathematical methods to philosophical constructions.] B. Varisco. 'La fine del Positivismo.' [Positivism may be out of fashion; but the temporary vogue of a philo- sophy has nothing to do with its truth. The writer takes the oppor- tunity of reaffirming his own positivist convictions, illustrating them by a discussion on the question of determinism, which for his part he re- asserts, simply as a fact of experience.] G. Buonfiglioli. ' Tertulliano e la Filosofia Pagana.' [With all his contempt for heathen philosophy, which he regarded as part of a vast Satanic system, Tertullian found himself obliged to borrow its methods for the organisation of Christian doctrine, choosing by preference Stoicism for the purpose.] Rassegna</page><page sequence="12">292 PHILOSOIHICAL PERIODICALS. Bibliografica, etc. Fasc. iv.. September-October. E. Juvalta. 'Per una scienza normativa morale.' [Ethical science cannot after all be reduced to a mere analysis of i'acts. It. demands an ideal. The writer's ideal is absolute justice-the giving equal chances to all citizens of enjoying the goods for whose attainment society exists. Egoism is no more reasonable than altruism, for reason does not prescribe ends but means.] G. Buonfiglioli. ' La Psicologia di Tertu}liano nei suoi rap- porti colla Psicologia Stoica.'

' Vicende del termine e dell concetto di legge nella Filo- sofia Naturale.' [The idea of natural law shows three historical phases. In the first physical uniformities are explained as divine volitions of an arbitrary and changeable character. In the second these volitions are conceived as invariable and necessary. In the third natural law is identified with the impersonal order of phenomena; but while one school regards this order as a fixed necessity, another school regards it as merely contingent.] S.
