This is the celebrated ostinato motive underpinning the first shark attack in Jaws (1975), shown in Ex. 1 in its stripped-down, most widely remem- bered and, indeed, iconic version. An exploitative 'horror flick'. Jaws misrepresents sharks and their behaviour. Ironically, such a misrepresentation is contingent on the ability of music to represent. Throughout the film, to adopt Kendall Walton's terminology, John Williams's notorious motive makes it fictional that the shark is about - and about to attack.1 Jerrold Levinson writes (1996, p. 261) that 'the musical "shark" motto is the only reliable signifier of the shark and so has an ineliminable fact-conveying function'. Kevin J. Donnelly, in his discussion of the power of music to convey presence, claims ofWilliams's music that it does not merely signify the presence of the shark - 'it is its presence' (Donnelly 2005, p. 93). Although they focus on different aspects of the score's impact, these statements are symptomatic of a broad agreement that the music of Jaws is representational. Taking stock of this consensus, my intention in this article is to investigate the conditions of the score's widely acknowledged representational force. In particular, I will review in some detail the sequence of the first shark attack and argue that selective attention is the pivot around which representational film music of the kind employed in Jaws revolves. Revisiting the remarkable early stages of the film will also bring to light an element of representational excess in the music, which I will go on to interpret as an attempt at capturing the world as seen, as it were, from the shark's own vantage point. Let me begin by reviewing the moment in which the shark attacks 'the first victim', as the relevant music cue calls her.2 The attack is shown in a handful of simple yet terrifying shots that exemplify the moments, and attendant moods, which define the horror genre: tension (or suspense), shock and horror-inducing action.3 The music reflects this trajectory: a suspenseful motive is followed by a shocking stinger and finally a climactic tutti.4 The first image is a moving shot of a young woman, Chrissie, seen from under the water - a shot that we gradually associate with the point of view of the approaching shark (Figs 1-3). For this image, Williams has devised an ostinato motive con- sisting of the alternation of two notes, moving a minor second apart (E-F) at moderate speed, and played both staccato and marcato in a low register (Ex. 2). This is interrupted by a tone cluster, its sinister sonority tempered by a hint of 306 Music Analysis, 29/i-ii-iii (2010) © 20 1 1 The Author.

After the cut, we see a middle close-up of the young woman from above the waterline (Fig. 4). The visual cut is masked - justified, almost - by the appearance of a striking new sonority. As the shark touches the swimmer from below, the two-note motive suddenly gives way to a jarring tritone in the high register of the woodwinds - a tried and tested example of a stinger.6 This is in turn followed by a closer shot of the woman as the shark drags her underwater. By the time the audience (or those viewers already in the know) sees the subsequent attacks, the connection between the minor-second motive and the action becomes Pavlovian in its reflexivity.7 As such, the motive generates con- siderable suspense or, as Lester D. Friedman (2006, p. 174) amusingly puts it, 'apprehension'. Not everyone agrees. Amongst the more knowing spectators is Nigel Andrews, who quipped of the beginning of the film: 'I remember feeling uninvolved for about ten minutes. All that "whoomp-whoomp" John Williams music and shark-attacking-defenceless-blonde imagery had been hyped and trailered on TV for what seemed months' (1999, p. 2). His view of the music notwithstanding, Andrews raises the important question of the role of prior knowledge in studying the effects of film music. Did the onslaught of pre- release publicity plant the motive's shark associations in viewers' minds? And if so, would that challenge the score's status as a paragon of film-music rep- resentation? Turning these questions on their head, I would argue, in fact, that pre-release publicity was partly instrumental in clarifying the motive's role - a ploy understood and exploited early on by the filmmakers and studio execu- tives. At the same time, Williams's music taps into the history of visual and musical motives at a depth sufficient to enable communication with viewers who may have been untouched by this publicity. Most important, I contend that much of the motive's power lies in the sheer subtlety of its use in the film. Music Analysis , 29/i-ii-iii (2010) © 201 1 The Author.

It is to this system that I now turn. The shark's musical baptism is somewhat unconventional, compared to how Leitmotiven in classical Hollywood cinema are normally presented. As Justin London has suggested in his discussion of proper nouns in language, a Leitmotiv is typically forged 'by ostension' (London 2000, p. 87), through the simultaneous introduction of music and character. He shows that this often takes place within the opening credits and in two stages: the normative version of the designating music is featured first, followed by a version indicating either a different shade of the character's personality or a foreshadowing of his or her destiny.8 When the motive recurs later in the film, the music may function as expressive garb, aural close-up or, at worst, the proverbial visiting card decried by Debussy in his criticism of Wagner and by Adorno and Eisler in their critique of film-music commodification . 9 Pace London, the association of music and character at the opening of Jaws is not simultaneous at all; in fact, what is fascinating about the motive is that its link with the shark is established only gradually, as the creature approaches its victim. The effect turns on the film's unusual use of memory. In all of London's examples, memory conventionally activates a link that has already crystallised or that is aided by a corresponding image (or both). During the shark's first attack, by contrast, to recall the music is actually to create that link, on account of the somewhat obscure fashion in which the motive is buried in the opening credits. Following the initial lick, heard just after the producer's logo is seen, the motive appears in a slightly differ- ent form - there is a further dip down the register to D - and also en travesty as it were, for it soon becomes an accompaniment figure to the title theme, scored for tuba, and is eventually buried under a series of rather Stravinskian percussive and syncopated tutti. At the onset of the first attack, then, the ability of the music to call up the image of the shark is tenuous, or at best a work in progress. This widens the range of possible responses to the particular relationship between music and image employed there, for suspense depends on the specific knowledge of a specific kind of threat, knowledge that one gains only in the course of the attack sequence itself. Otherwise put, one learns about the plausibility, then possibility and finally inevitability of the attack only as one goes along. Even after the shark touches the unsus- pecting swimmer, some viewers may wonder - as does the victim herself - what exactly is happening. It is only when we see the consequences of the upwardly moving shot, at the sound of the victim's screams, that the motive is wedded once and for all, if in retrospect, to the shark's 'instinctual, relentless, unstoppable' urge to attack (John Williams, quoted in Andrews 1999, p. 60). It is at this point, to use Anahid Kassabian's terms, that what might have otherwise passed as 'one-time music' has become a 'leitmotiv' (Kassabian 2000, p. 57). 10 Music Analysis , 29/i-ii-iii (2010) © 201 1 The Author. Music Analysis © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="5">310 GIORGIO BIANCOROSSO Exordium The first attack is the climax of an extended exordium which begins with the credits and whose aim is not merely to introduce the main topic of the film, but also to train the viewer to respond appropriately to its particular brand of audiovisual language. It is important, in this respect, to distinguish the motive's delayed identity as a Leitmotiv from its immediately available connotations of menace, many of which flow from the character of the minor second. This motive, in Kassabian's words (2000, p. 45), 'serves its purpose of signaling "menace" from the first time it is heard'. According to Ronald Rodman, as a dissonance with a long history of uses in both the vocal and the instrumental repertoire, the minor second signifies instability and harshness, while the low register is expressive of the 'sinister' and 'ominous' (2006, p. 124). The use of deeply pitched strings, unresolved dissonances and what Donnelly (2005, pp. 90-1) calls the 'tension ostinato', moreover, marks the music as appropriate to a horror film.11 These connotations and genre identifiers are present at the begin- ning of the film independently of the emergent threat of attack. The latter, more specific threat is understood by Rodman as an instance of denotation, according to his semiotic model. Kassabian, for her part, speaks of how the motive 'signifies the danger of the shark specifically ' (2000, p. 57; emphasis added). A third and simpler option, as I will explain below, is to describe the welding of music and narrative situation as a case of musical representation, or 'hearing-in'. Termino- logical and methodological differences notwithstanding, the crucial point is that the equation 'music = shark' is not a given but must be earned in the course of the film. In this regard, the first attack is arguably the point at which this link is cemented, hence its significance for the theory of representational film music I am proposing here. The process by which the music is tied to a specific type of menace, and a particular kind of action, is paced with great care. Halfway through the title sequence, after the underwater shot synchronised to Williams's title theme, we move suddenly to a scene depicting partying on the beach (Fig. 5). In hindsight, the straight cut suggests a classic example of cross-cutting. Unbeknownst to us, the credits have plunged us into the midst of the action from the start: the shark is swimming in the nearby waters at the same time that the people are enjoying their gathering on the beach. But since we cannot know this yet, the cut comes across as untoward, jarring, almost confusing. After all, the contrast between the first half of the title sequence, underwater, and the second half, on the beach, could not be starker. Against the black sky, a very different colour scheme dominates the frame, the various figures emerging as patches of reds, browns, dark orange and ochre. Gone are the dark seabed, the jerky camera movements and Williams's menacing music. People chat, make out in front of the bonfire and play the guitar or harmonica. And yet, as Stan Link has remarked about a later attack, foreshadowed by the unlikely children's tune 'Do You Know the Muffin Man?', the impromptu music © 201 1 The Author.

While 'Do You Know the Muffin Man?' functions as an ironic premonition because of its frank innocence, the folksy sounds of the guitar and harmonica are suspect for flaunting their distance from the orchestral music which immediately precedes them. I propose that we hear this juxtaposition of these radically distinct sound worlds as an extension of the Hollywood tradition of planting two contrasting versions of Leitmotiven in the opening credits. As the credits end, Chrissie makes eye contact with a young man. The sounds of the party fade away, and we see her run towards the sea and then undress to swim - as much a signal of sexual interest as an act of deferral. The colour scheme darkens to blues, greys and greens as the camera tracks her with hori- zontal motions. Chrissie is seen swimming, staying just out of the young man's reach. As the tracking camera following her emphasises horizontal motion, blues, greys, dark greens and browns come to dominate the screen again. We have entered a new zone. Soon we again see Chrissie swimming while the boozy young man tries in vain to catch her. It is not he, but the shark, who will get the girl.12 Chrissie calls to the boy, and there is a cut to an underwater shot of her (Fig. 6 and Ex. 3). At this juncture, Williams's music suddenly reappears, in one gesture wiping out the evocative soundscape so artfully established in the previous shots: the lapping water, the distant, staccato chime of the buoy and the voices of the two protagonists themselves. We are, of course, underwater again, hence the absence of ambient sounds. But the music is not intended simply to mark the exclusion of the auditory object. Its appearance coincides with what seems to be a point-of-view shot representing not just the position in space of a living being, but its lurking beneath and attending to the moving body of the swimmer (the work of attention is suggested by the camera's pan as the woman crosses the Music Analysis , 29/i-ii-iii (2010) © 201 1 The Author.

The shark motive is there too, albeit a semitone lower than before (Dlt-E), and, once again, only a single strand of a complex texture: two quick, simple arpeggiations across two versions of the whole-tone scale, repeated with increasing speed and widening register, anchored to a bass drone and capped by an expansive, slow-moving motive in the strings' upper register. The motive is now more easily identifiable than in the credits, seemingly ges- turing to assert itself as a discrete, independent musical entity. But the associa- tion between this textural complex and an intentionality to kill (in response to the swimmer's sexual provocation) becomes apparent only in hindsight. The appearance of the music also induces a change in our relationship to the sea. Caught in the glow of dawn in a very long shot, the sea no longer looks like the setting for a sexual game of hide-and-seek; the continuing music transforms it into a sinister expanse of water hiding a menacing presence which is both underlying and all-encompassing (Fig. 7 and Ex. 4). The attack proper is set to the third and most memorable appearance of the motive, the camera moving vertically upwards (Fig. 8 and Ex. 4 at 3'54"; also see again Ex. 2 and Figs 1-4). The cut to the underwater shot coincides with a new cue: the motive transposed up a semitone, subtly suggesting a shift in viewpoint from lurking observation to active aim at a target. The composer foregrounds the motive by turning what in the credits was the accompaniment figure into a theme in its own right and bringing its pulse aggressively to the fore. The accelerating rhythmic subdivision of the two-note motive creates the dual effect, which cannot be conveyed by the visuals alone, of decreasing distance (between shark and victim) and mounting intention to attack. Synchronised with the upward- moving camera, the motive has become the locus of agency.13 While the camera draws us ever closer to Chrissie's body, the music makes us dread the imminent attack. It is in this respect that the attack establishes music's role as the bearer of truth (significantly, when a later attack fails to materialise, it is unaccompanied by music). The camera cuts to a shot of Chrissie above the water line; although we do not actually see the shark connect with its prey, this is conveyed sonically by a tritone in the winds. The enormous force of the eventual attack is conveyed by bursts of furious string writing mixed with the victim's screams. The scene, in Linda Williams's words, is a paradigm of cinematic 'excess': c[t]he spectacle of a body caught in the grip of intense sensation or emotion .... Excess is marked by recourse not to the coded articulations of language but inarticulate cries of pleasure in porn, screams of fear in horror, sobs of anguish in melodrama' (1991, p. 4). 14 The scenario is enhanced by the fact that the shark is both silent and invisible - it is only the frantic music which suggests its motion, and the victim's cries which attest to the attack. These cries may even transcend their status as symptom of this attack: underscoring the disturbingly extended images of the helpless victim being dragged to and fro, her screams push the music to the background and, through an extraordinary transfer, become themselves the expression of the animal's will to kill.

The moment is so densely informative and induces such strong emotional reactions that the music's configurational aspects - its sonic components - escape my attention: melody, timbre, rhythm - the very stuff of music - vaporise, as it were, into pure content.15 But I hear music nonetheless. To be precise, and to paraphrase Richard Wollheim on the subject of pictorial representation, I hear in the music.16 1 hear the shark's ominous pres- ence in the combined effect of music and camera movement, just as I read meaning into typographical signs laid out on a page or see landscapes or faces in images.17 With respect to painting, Wollheim insists that the experience of seeing-in is twofold: we simultaneously see the marks on the surface and something in the surface. These, according to Wollheim, are not two separate experiences, but two aspects of the same experience - the twofold impression of one and only one object or mark. 18 The theory has experimental support.The psychologist M. H. Pirenne, for instance, has demonstrated how constant subsidiary awareness of the canvas as a surface allows the viewer of a perspectival representation to make the slight adjustments necessary to retain a coherent and undistorted view of the whole.19 Without such an awareness - as in some trompe Voeil paintings, for instance - a change in the viewer's position results in ungainly distortions of the visual field (such as one experiences looking at the painted dome and nave of the Church of Sant'Ignazio in Rome, for example, or the nave of the Church of the Jesus, also in Rome). The singularity-yet-duality of the experience of pictorial representation, moreover, accounts for how we appreciate style and stylistic differences as properties not of the surface, but of the representation itself. Without the recip- rocal, and constantly shifting, relationship between configurational aspects (the marks) and recognitional ones (the image), it would be impossible to explain why naturalistic representation in art has a history, or why it has taken - and continues to take - so many forms.20 If looking at a painting as a surface and seeing its represented content were two separate experiences, rather than a singular - if twofold - one, a painting would merely be a trigger for a wholly imaginary experience, in the manner of a novel.21 But this cannot be the case, for the experience of painting is quintessentially perceptual - a point, I argue, which applies just as strongly to a vividly perceptual medium such as cinema.22 In the case of the first shark attack in Jaws&gt; the richness or manifold aspects of the music - its materiality as sound, structural organisation, performative dimen- sion, and so forth - could well pass unnoticed. The viewer, his or her perception channelled through the images, might be too absorbed by the represented content to be able to dwell, say, on the quality of the performance. Perhaps the structural elements of Williams's score are not parsed by the viewer in the manner academic discourse often associates with music listening tout courts or what Nicholas Cook has termed 'musicological' listening (1990, p. 152). To hear the shark in the music Music Analysis , 29/i-ii-iii (2010) © 201 1 The Author. Music Analysis © 20 1 1 Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="11">316 GIORGIO BIANCOROSSO is essentially, then, a process of disambiguation underpinned by selective atten- tion. This is not to say that alternative aspects of the music go unperceived; rather, our attention is fixed firmly on what the music represents (its 'recognitional' aspect) - the 'shark' - rather than on its formal (or 'configurational') aspect - the motive qua motive. In the words of Michael Polanyi (1959, p. 30), we are 'subsidiarily' aware of selected aspects of the music while 'focally' aware of its narrative import. Polanyi compares this to the situation when we hear speech, in which we are subsidiarily aware of its phonetic, grammatical and syntactical aspects while focally aware of its content.23 That is why my transcriptions should be taken as mementos (cues which can be used to call to mind particular moments in the film) rather than literal representations of the full experience. From this perspective, the phenomenology of musical representation turns on a central question: not whether perception occurs, nor whether it is of a 'sub- conscious' or 'subliminal' kind, but rather where focal attention falls. For it goes without saying that music's structural aspects are fundamental to our grasp of the film's action, even if we attend to them subsidiarily. That is why London is correct in stressing that altering a motive's basic shape entails losing its desig- native function.24 Alteration can also be a matter of performance or recording: if the motive is recorded in a way that calls my attention to some peculiarities in the performance style or choice of instruments, I will not be able to hear the shark in it.25 Agency does not have a tangible shape or perceptible manifestation - or even an outwardly visible symptom - which can be depicted in any literal sense of the term. The representation of the shark's agency, therefore, must have little to do with resemblance or aural mimicry. Indeed, in Carolyn Abbate's words, it is 'contingent upon the distance between the musical fabric itself and the state, event, or feeling we perceive it to express' (1991, p. 26; emphasis added).26 To hear within the motive the shark's mounting intention to attack is to cover that distance through an act of imagination. Like inner states such as the feeling of fear, the flashing of an idea and the will or intention to act, the experience of passing time lacks the visibility of a thing or an event. But in the cinema, as in the performing arts, it can be made a putative object of representation. Thus the two-note motive represents (indeed, measures) the passage of time through rhythmic subdivision, repetition and diminution, imparting to the scene its sense of teleology and suggesting the shark's movement through space. Wollheim, somewhat controversially, denies that imagination (as well as resemblance) plays any role in seeing-in. For Wollheim, seeing-in is a strictly perceptual act: less connected to the will, more responsive to the detail of the marked surface and requiring that we fix our eyes on this surface.27 Walton (1990), on the other hand, leaves room for imagination (or imaginative percep- tion) in his own account of our experience of representation, while endorsing much of Wollheim's position (such as the rejection of resemblance and a com- mitment to the simultaneous singularity-duality of image reading). His motives are to keep in sight the fictional status of what is being represented, even where © 201 1 The Author. Music Analysis , 29/i-ii-iii (2010) Music Analysis © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="12">The Shark in the Music 317 characters and locations are captured with photographic realism in sustained narratives - as in films. Walton's differentiation between ecological and cinematic-fictional perception is crucial, as I have said elsewhere.28 As an ingre- dient of cinema's complex storytelling machinery, music is an excellent candi- date for a theory of representation which, like Wollheim's, wants to dispense with the idea of resemblance; after all, what literal resemblance could there possibly be between a creature charging towards its prey and a sonic configuration? And yet this is the very reason Wollheim is wrong about imagination. It is precisely the radical inequality between the representans - the music - and the representatum - the presence of the shark - which predicates our capacity for imaginative per- ception in films such as Jaws. Musical Representation and Cross-Media Interaction Music's capacity to convey threat and intentionality is grounded, ultimately, in the nature of sound. From an evolutionary perspective, sound can signal the unknown or ominous, such as a distant menace or a fast-approaching threat requiring immediate response. Insofar as the music partakes of the creation of such scenarios, it may be placed alongside memories of sounds heard in real-life situations and thus be treated, at least indirectly, as a natural sign. Our response to such a sound would have to be, at least to some extent, wired into the brain.29 The issue of environmental sound (including the actual space it traverses - that of the movie theatre) is crucial, because the music is intended, after all, for the knowing spectator, not the unknowing swimmer. This is not to say, however, that our position as epistemically superior to that of the fictional character distances us from the action. On the contrary, the film works only because we are not mere onlookers, but rather conduits through which the representation holds together. And we are drawn into this process because unanchored sounds instil a sense of imminent danger. At the same time, as I will show in due course, this real-life scenario works in counterpoint with an alternative phenomenology - that of the shark's own experience of the attack. I will also claim that it is important to analyse the sequence as a species of musical representation, focus- sing on its use of specifically musical processes. But first, let us consider the motive as a species of what, following Ernst H. Gombrich, I term 'trigger.' A trigger, as Gombrich defines it, is a contrast of texture or tonality in a painting.30 According to him, such sensorial triggers are responsible for creating illusion - or what Wollheim terms 'seeing-in' - in that they help us perceive outlines, shapes and areas of colour as images of something. With auditory perception, sensorial triggers take the form of variations in loud- ness or pitch, which can prime us to hear environmental sounds as musically structured tones - for instance, hearing a sequence of car honks as a motive or tune.31 With film music, I argue, triggers are not sensorial so much as culturally defined. Filmmakers use different kinds of music as culturally defined triggers Music Analysis , 29/i-ii-iii (2010) © 201 1 The Author. Music Analysis © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="13">318 GIORGIO BIANCOROSSO which cue us to hear in the music a range of possible roles. Claudia Gorbman, for instance, discusses film music's production of meaning in terms of an interaction among three kinds of codes: the purely musical, the culturally musical and the cinematically musical.32 Thus, when I hear a film score, it is not sufficient that the music's sound patterns trigger my perception of those sounds as music (as when I hear music in the sounds).33 I must also recognize the music as that particular kind of music; that is, I must grasp the music in terms of broadly shared cultural values as well as certain properties specific to how films employ it. I must attend to its genre vis-a-vis other types of music and other modes of film scoring. I also compare it with the different sorts of music in the film at hand or in the director's other films. Furthermore, I read the music as being symbolic of particular feelings or attitudes.34 Only by recognising these various properties am I able to hear the music perform a certain kind of work in the context of the film. This is most evident when filmmakers draw on well-known pre-existing music, a famous example being Stanley Kubrick's use of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony in A Clockwork Orange. The music's role in this film is crucially dependent both on my recognizing it as Beethoven's Ninth and on my knowl- edge of the work as an icon ofWestern culture.35 With Jaws , these processes turn not on our recognition of any pre-existing work, but on our familiarity with a stylistic and generic tradition. We read the film in terms of a dictionary of cine-musical tropes. At issue is not the association of the minor-second motive with a shark, which is unique to Jaws. The point, rather, is that we are taught to make such an association through a living cinematic tradition - a broad ecology of fact-conveying music acting in concert with the moving image. Examples are legion. A classic precedent in the 'monster' or 'bad-guy' tradition is the music for Fritz Lang's film M (1931). There, it is the tune of 'In the Hall of the Mountain King' from Grieg's Peer Gynt that announces the presence of the serial killer, who whistles it offscreen.36 The virtue of these motives is that they are short and very memorable. They can be associated with an event, character or mental state either during the credits, as in Jaws , or near the beginning of the film, when the monster or criminal perpetrates the first, strategically timed action.37 Once the association is forged, the musical cue recurs later in the film (perhaps slightly varied) playing a range of functions: warning the spectator of the danger before the characters themselves are aware of it, thereby creating suspense; suggesting danger in an otherwise ambiguous or overdetermined situation; or, metonymically, replacing the sight of the monster- killer altogether. In My the 'Mountain King' theme remains recognisably the same throughout the film, despite its being deliberately whistled in a tentative fashion by the director himself. Its stability - which stems partly from its pre-existing the film - reflects the tune's grip on the killer. By contrast, the very fact that a freshly composed score is not tied to any pre-existing original version frees it to vary motives which reflect nuances of characterisation and mise en scene. Roman Polanski's horror film Rosemary's Baby (1968) is an interesting case in point. Not © 201 1 The Author.

Rosar has traced to the operatic topic of ombra : angular melodic lines, tonal dissonance, sudden dynamic contrast and unusual (typically low) instrumentation.39 Ombra scenes in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Italian and French opera dramatised the announcement or appearance of supernatural beings, benign (oracles) or other- wise (witches or demons). Pivotal to the plot, they inspired a sublime terror, an effect compounded by spectacular sets and lighting effects.40 Jaws does not in fact partake of the central elements of ombra - slow tempos, flat keys and church music. But it does suggest the metaphor of the approaching shark as an encroaching shadow, akin to the shadow of the offscreen-whistling Hans Beckert in M. Closer at hand for Williams is the world of late nineteenth-century opera and modernist works such as Stravinsky's Rite of Spring , whose thunderous synco- pations are quoted almost literally in the credits just before the cut to the beach.41 Williams drew also on the tradition of Hollywood monster movies.42 Rosar has traced Dimitri Tiomkin and Bernard Herrmann's music for The Thing from Another World (1951; dir. Christian Nyby and Howard Hawks, the latter uncred- ited) and The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951; dir. Robert Wise) to the dragon motive in Wagner's Siegfried (upwardly zigzagging octave contours, angular inter- vals and tubas). Rosar hears these motives as mimetic of the monsters' actual movements.43 In Act I, scene I, of Siegfried , the motive both represents the dragon backstage and conveys its qualities. The representational economy shifts when, in Act II, scene II, the monster is seen onstage. Emotion without Representation? Jaws also affects us emotionally. With my knowledge of the threat, I am over- whelmed with fear for the unknowing swimmer. Phenomenologically speaking, my experience of the music seems impervious to analysis because I cannot disentangle perceptions from responses. Rather, they seem to cohere in a single act of consciousness in which hearing is inseparable from knowledge, and knowl- edge from emotion. In Polanyi's terms, I am focally aware of my fear and subsidiarily aware of the music and images which elicit it.44 What exactly is responsible for my fear? According to Ben Winters (2008, p. 4), filmmakers have used 'the sound of a heartbeat, or a musical representation thereof, to realise their narrative aims in the realm of... suspense'.45 The two- note motive's third appearance, just before the attack (not the initial version with the sforzando on the first beat so much as the later, syncopated variant) suggests Music Analysis , 29/i-ii-iii (2010) © 201 1 The Author. Music Analysis © 201 1 Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="15">320 GIORGIO BIANCOROSSO the pounding of a heart under great stress (see again Ex. 2). In this respect, the heartbeat increases as the rhythm accelerates. To hear a heartbeat in the music would, in Donnelly's words, 'provide the music with the function of being a non-diegetic sound effect, where the conventional function of diegetic sound has been systematically and powerfully adopted by an aspect of the musical score' (Donnelly is here describing the drones evoking the foghorns in John Carpen- ter's The Fog [1980]). 46 But whose heartbeat is it? The shark's, under its own athletic stress? It cannot be Chrissie's, because she is not experiencing fear herself. Perhaps, rather than simulating her fear, the audience imagines a fear it knows she should be experiencing. It remains an open question whether the musical heartbeat is a cause or signal of the emotion or merely the appropriate accompaniment to it. More important is the issue of knowledge, or even its absence. The motive's primary mission is to convey knowledge and thereby arouse fear. This knowledge, however, emerges out of a unique multimedia construction: the heartbeat is effective also because the accelerating rhythms are precisely synchronized to the images, so that it functions as a countdown. The tightness of this synchronisation between rhythm and image captures, in Kassabian's words, the extent to which ' [d]ramatic scoring maximally matches visual action' (2000, p. 45). It also illustrates the way in which such a 'maximalist' approach to scoring minimises the 'ability for perceivers to shift positions within the fantasy scenarios offered' (Kassabian 2000, pp. 45 and 108). Under such a strictly regulated handling of narratively salient information, there is no choice for the spectator but to experience suspense. The resulting emotion is complex, however. We fear for - if not with - Chrissie; at the same time, we feel compelled to wonder about the course of events, and we even anticipate her spectacular death with some relish. This combination of negative and positive affects is a familiar feature of suspense (in this case, sympathetic fear blended with the thrill of anticipation). This admix- ture of pleasure and terror is one of the ways real-world fear differs from what philosophers have termed fictional fear or quasi-fear,47 including that experi- enced in or generated by cinema. In fact, I would argue that fictional fear is tantamount to our concept of suspense. Lydia Goehr has suggested that, because the film's suspense subsumes visual- auditory motives, the spectator is unaware of the shark and experiences emotion without representation.48 If Goehr is right, then the sequence becomes a fear- producing mechanism emptied of representational content. Fear remains an intentional state, but without any specific object: we do not fear something we know will happen, we fear that something (we do not know what) will happen. Meanwhile, the gulf between unknowing character and increasingly distressed spectator widens to a point of crisis.49 There is also the element of irony. On a second or third viewing, Williams's score, rather like a friend's wicked joke, frightens us with a wink, bracketing its own cliched characteristics.50 Given the immense popularity of the film and its music, it is even possible that first-time viewers may hear the motive with a © 201 1 The Author.

Conversely, an informed viewing may serve to fore- ground the very features by which the shark's motion and agency were originally grounded. To be sure, the successful triggering of visceral emotional responses on the one hand, and the full-blown representation of action, locale and character on the other, are not mutually exclusive. But we cannot bestow our full attention on both processes simultaneously. Whether we remember the shark attack as a paragon of fear-inducing cinematic gimmickry or as a fine instance of audiovi- sual representation depends ultimately on the circumstances under which the film is screened and our own interests and proclivities as viewer-auditors. 'Unheard Music'? Hearing the music as pointing to a state of affairs, while responding to it with fear and subsequently horror, serves us well. It also serves the film well. Imagine a viewer focussing only on the music's acoustical dimension, praising its quality as a fine instance of performance or appreciating it as technologically manipulated sound. In the context of Jaws , this would be like looking at a portrait by Rembrandt while standing too close to the canvas: the figure would disintegrate into patterns of brushstrokes, and the viewer would miss the painting's repre- sentational content.51 Or think of someone who appreciates the music as formal patterns which are simply interesting in themselves. This would be like under- standing a landscape painting only as a play of shapes and colours, without actually seeing the landscape in it. To pursue my analogy with vision: just as our capacity to see an image representationally is contingent on our ability to take in the whole without focussing on each mark of the paint, so, too, to hear Williams's music in Jaws requires that we not hear it too 'close up'. It also requires a certain degree of blindness (or deafness) to the music as a discrete, self-standing flow of information.52 But fact-conveying film music such as one hears in Jaws is no more self-effacing than framing or lighting is in film, or than colour or outlines are in painting or tone, accent or mannerisms in speech. When filmmakers use music in this way, they are encouraging one particular mode of music cognition: the selection (driven by narrative interest and the limits of our attention) of one amongst manifold aspects which the music affords. In a film such as Jaws, there are actually several alternative means of conveying the shark's presence. The filmmakers could have shown a counter shot of the shark itself, with or without the music; a point-of-view shot from a third party looking on as the scene unfolded; an image of the shark as a flashback; or, although this is far less likely, they could have chosen to use a voice-over or an intertitle, as in silent films. Compared to these alternatives, my cognition of the shark's presence through music and camera movement might seem more indi- rect, perhaps pointing to a reality which other conscious states recognise and name more exactly or more explicitly. But that does not necessarily make my perception unconscious or subliminal. When I see the shot as an image of a girl in the ocean, I perceive it representationally; that is, I am imaginatively exploring Music Analysis , 29/i-ii-iii (2010) © 201 1 The Author. Music Analysis © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="17">322 GIORGIO BIANCOROSSO the material and formal features of the image as if they were those of a young woman in the water - or, better, a fictional character swimming in the water off the coast of Amity Island (the locale of the action). Simultaneously, I hear in the music (particularly through the motive's rhythmic acceleration) the shark's approach, its upward motion, its intention to attack and its strategically orien- tated motion towards its prey. What renders the image of the swimmer representational is a high-resolution correspondence between the actress as a sitter, of whom the film is a photo- graphic document, and the actress as a model for a fictional character - Chrissie, a demure, attractive blonde enacting the role of the sacrificial victim.53 The music, for its part, represents the shark's agency through its symbiotic link to the moving camera, as well as a special kind of referential power whose rules of functioning I learn as the film progresses. However, in its broad outlines the process of conveying the presence of the shark through music shares an impor- tant similarity with the visual representation of Chrissie: in both cases, we recuperate stimuli, whether visual or aural, as attributes of a fictional world. We do this through a perceptual act shot through with imagination. It is strange, given these parallels, that notions of subliminal or unconscious perception have been applied much more frequently to music than to images. One possible reason may be that our culture views images - unlike music - as straightforwardly representational and unproblematic in their ability to depict. Photographic images, in particular, have a clear denotational level and are the paradigm of transparency, an understanding of images codified by language as the norm. Nevertheless, this has the curious effect that the very word 'image' is rendered ambiguous, so that it refers equally to the medium and to that which it resembles, the scene which it represents. Whether we attend to a painting's material support, its formal features or its representational content, we say that we are seeing an image. Whether we remember props, facts, characters or their specifically visual traits, we say of a film that we remember its images. By the same token, if we forget the particular composition of a frame, the hue of a color or the lighting of a set, we do not say of a film that we forgot its images. Not so with music: when we do not remember the melodic profile or instrumentation of a score, we say that we have not heard it. Admittedly, along with the music for the shower scene in Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960), the shark motive in Jaws may well be the most easily recognisable cue in the history of Hollywood cinema. Unlike Herrmann's glissandi in the earlier score, however, Williams's motive is also eminently hummable and memo- rable and through the years has come to represent, in the memory of audiences the world over, both the film and the peculiar brand of horror associated with it. This does not make my argument less applicable to other, less well-known scores, however. Take other segments of the score for Jaws - the music for the Fourth of July sequence, for instance. The cue, for all its merits, can hardly be called memorable, and it has never been subjected to the same level of scrutiny. But this is not because it is any less consciously perceived; it is just that the © 201 1 The Author. Music Analysis , 29/i-ii-iii (2010) Music Analysis © 20 1 1 Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="18">The Shark in the Music 323 famous motive has over the years acquired the weight of a character - so much so that, to give a further twist to Donnelly's claim quoted at the beginning of this article, the motive is the shark. What Is It Like to Be a Shark? I have thus far referred to the music's power to induce emotion. I have also spoken at some length of the music as a conventional type, in the long historical line of cinematic representations of unseen monsters and mysterious menaces encroaching upon unsuspecting victims. Yet the first attack of Jaws presents us with such a nuanced and visually deliberate version of this narrative trope as to make one wonder whether conveying the presence of the attacking shark, and an impending sense of danger, is the scene's sole effect (whatever the intended purpose). To answer this question we must first raise another: what is at stake in leaving the shark unseen? The representation of the swimmer, let it be stressed, is very definite and very closely guided by an objective correlative, by what I see on the screen. There is a distinctly perceptual aspect to my seeing the actress in the scene as a swimmer who is unaware that she is in danger. Conversely, my inference of the shark's underwater movement is drawn from camera movement and music. It is an act of imagination. I seem to experience the shark's undeclared presence - and therein, perhaps, lies the unique appeal of the sequence. But while I look at the swimmer, I also simultaneously see the shark's furtive motion through the water, experiencing it vicariously through what I soon learn to recuperate imaginatively as a view from the shark's own perspective. Looking at the floating girl and seeing through the shark's eyes are two aspects of the same shot; they are inextricably linked - indeed, interdependent. The first shark attack falls in the onset movement of what Carroll has called the 'complex discovery plot' (1998, p. 99). At this juncture of the film, an unforgettable and unmistakable link needed to be made between the felt pres- ence of a threat and the music which gradually came to mark such a presence. The music had to act, first of all, as a guarantor of the veracity of what was being insinuated and, second, call up such a presence even in the absence of the relevant images.54 In the first attack, the need to forge a bond between the shark and the music seems to have pushed the filmmakers to the edge of the plot- driven structure proper. What emerges here, arguably, is nothing less than an interest in representing a moment in the life of the shark's consciousness, 'something that it is like to be that organism - something it is like for the organism' (Nagel 1974, p. 436). After all, it was the suggestion of a consciousness behind the camera that had originally posited the unseen shark's presence. That such a representation, and my own account of how it is achieved, verges on the anthropomorphic is somewhat fitting. It follows from Nagel's tenet that, since consciousness is expressive of a perspective or point of view, the point of view of a creature such as a bat is ultimately opaque - unknowable to other Music Analysis , 29/i-ii-iii (2010) © 201 1 The Author. Music Analysis © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="19">324 GIORGIO BIANCOROSSO Fig. 9 A view from beneath creatures. Hence we can only fictionalise the consciousness of other species in terms of the familiar: we re-imagine the conscious life of another being in our terms. All Spielberg and Williams can do is 'present what they think a human version of what a shark's-eye view might be like. Uninterested in the philosophi- cal truth of that imaginary recreation, spectators are quite happy to collude in the world created on the silver screen' (Eric Clarke, personal communication, 6 April 2010). Inevitably, music also imbues such reimagining with human qualities and as such serves as the vehicle for the expression of fears or aspirations - intimation as much as representation proper. In this respect, the shark may be said to incarnate our fears, and Jaws to be about the unnatural element within us. Sharing the shark's peculiar vantage point also results in a peculiar form of estrangement of the familiar. As seen from below, in the equivocal glow of the underwater world, Chrissie and the beachgoers who form the essential backdrop to the first part of the film seem utterly transfigured in their appearance and behaviour. The above-the-water shots of them crowding the shallow waters surrounding Amity Island conform to our expectations; but these shots only serve to reinforce the estrangement effect once the camera goes underwater again. Think of the shots of legs hanging just above what we will soon learn is the shark itself, only seconds before the third deadly attack (Fig. 9). Here, in Antonia Quirke's vivid description, nothing can be heard except 'the faint whoosh of liquid passing through the thrusting legs of so many bathers'. These wonderfully estranging images are rare and hardly add up to a full-blown picture, sustained across the film as a whole, of life as seen from what Quirke has called a 'beneath', 'the seriousness [of which] is an argument so unanswerable that no debate is necessary' (2002, pp. 51-2). When, later in the film, the threatening creature is feared to be approaching from afar or is shown explicitly, the shark is deprived of its own gaze, and the increasingly familiar music is reduced to a signal or code: effective as a conveyor of information, to be sure, but far less rich for it, the entirety of its message conveyed with its first instant of sound.55 By then we will © 201 1 The Author.

Bobby Tsai's assistance was crucial in the preparation of the musical examples.

I was unable to obtain the cue sheet in time for this publication. 3. See Hayward (2009), p. 6. 4. Remarkably, the rubrics 'suspense' (Spannung) and 'climax' ( Hohepunkt ) account for the entire first section ('Dramatische Expression') of the Allgemeines Handbuch der Film-Musik, see Becce and Erdmann (1927), vol. 2, pp. 1-38. 5. Becce and Erdmann (1927) features several examples of suspenseful or tension- inducing music labelled 'magic' and 'vision' (p. 7). Many of them originate in opera and bear generic features similar to those of Williams's score: slow or moderate tempos, chromaticism, sparse textures and exotic timbres. 6. See Donnelly (2010), pp. 160-1. 7. A stinger is a single, sustained note or chord, often attacked forte or fortissimo, used to mark a pivotal moment - as in Hitchcock's Vertigo (1958), when, to the sound of grating horns, Scottie (James Stewart) discovers that Judy (Kim Novak) had posed as Madeleine; or in Michael Curtiz's Casablanca (1942), in the famous scene in which Rick (Humphrey Bogart) is shocked to see Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) in the cafe. A stinger can also provide closure or precipitate a transition between sequences, as in the latter-day interpretation of the technique found, for instance, in John Sayles's Passion Fish (1992). 8.

I understand the term 'leitmotiv' as used by Kassabian to refer to any recurring themes or motive that accrues a specific representational mission in the course of the film. Because of the different meaning of the term as applied to the mature works of Wagner, I will here refrain from using the term, preferring the generic term Music Analysis , 29/i-ii-iii (20 10) © 201 1 The Author.

For a critical overview of the appropriation of the term 'leitmotiv' by early writers on film music and practitioners, see Paulin (2000), pp. 67-73. 11. Donnelly also observes how the ostinato and the drone, in horror-film music, 'are not closely related to minimalism in art music, with its gradual-systemic develop- ment. They are more additive, exploiting the phenomenon of repetition's cumula- tive effect, like mantra, religious ritual music or even repetitive dance music'; Donnelly (2005), p. 91. 12. The delayed, indeed posthumous, encounter between the boy and the girl takes place later, as he recognizes her horrendously dismembered body, washed up ashore, under the blinding light of midday sun. The image of her torso and head, crabs crawling all over it brimming with excitement at the unexpected feast, is the alternate countershot to that of him clumsily trying to make his way into the water, and brings the 'boy meets girl' plot to a gory and mercilessly premature end. 13. The shark does come across as a live creature with a will, and the flexibility with which the E-F motive is used in the first part of the film is partially responsible for that impression. For a comparison, think of the 'mechanical heartbeat' in James Cameron's The Terminator (1984) and Terminator 2 (1991), which points to the breakdown between the sonic dimensions of the organic and the mechanical; see Collins (2004). 14. On the 'excessive aurality' and the 'aural onslaught' produced by the victims' screams in Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1973), see Coyle and Hayward (2009), pp. 132-3. Commenting on the applicability of Williams's theory of excess to Psycho , Fenimore notes that in horror 'immoral, sexually active "bad" girls must die so that the moral, non-sexual "good" girls can survive'; Fenimore (2010), p. 87. Indeed, many horror films apparently do subscribe to such a puri- tanical view of the relation between sex and moral character, often complying with what one critic refers to as 'Old Testament justice - fornicate and you're dead'; see Andrews (1999), pp. 24-5. While such a scenario applies only imperfectly to the film version of Jaws, it does in fact fit the novel's original plot like a glove. There, not only do Chrissie and her boyfriend have sex just before the attack, but the tearing apart of Chrissie's body is described in gory detail, as if to deny the beauty and appeal of the body as glorified by sex; see Benchley (2005), pp. 10-13. 15. Here I am paraphrasing Arthur Danto: 'The medium ... is of course never really eliminable: there is always going to be a residuum of matter that cannot be vaporized into pure content'; see Danto (1981), p. 159. The significance of the 'residuum' Danto refers to depends on the nature of the medium vis-a-vis the object of representation as well as the position of the viewer or spectator: attention is as important as the physical facets of the work in determining whether the medium vaporises into content. In our example, the substitution of a stream of musical sounds for the agency of the shark ensures that some awareness of the medium will always be lurking beneath the threshold of our attention. But by the same token one could also argue that rather than calling attention to the medium, the deployment of music heightens the impression of an unseen presence, stressing as it were the absence of the image, and further driving attention away from the sonic medium as such. 16.

Glossing on the so-called inaudibility of film music, Cohen (2000), p. 366, draws an instructive analogy between inattentiveness to the music in a film and obliviousness to the font of the text we are reading. But surely there are instances in which film music, being itself the privileged channel of communication, amounts to more than the equivalent of a font in a written text; in that case, the analogy ought to be between film music and the printed text tout court (rather than merely the font in which it is presented). 18. The philosopher Andrew Harrison insists on how it is important to distinguish between twofoldness and transparency, the latter implying that the there are two experiences, one of the canvas, or any other picture-surface, and the other of the image as seen through or across it; see Harrison (2001), p. 44. 19. See Pirenne (1970). 20. See Wollheim (1989), p. 73. 21. See Walton (1990), pp. 300-1. 22. Walton's observation on the difference between perceptual (painting) and non- perceptual imagining (novel) reminds one of Wittgenstein's point about the per- ceptual nature of seeing , as opposed to merely imagining or interpreting, an image; see Wittgenstein ([1958] 1974), pp. 193-214. 23. See Polanyi (1959), p. 30, and (1969), pp. 181-2. 24. See London (2000), p. 88. 25. In this respect, representational film music is a fine illustration of the fundamental difference between subsidiary attention and what we may call 'fringe' conscious- ness. While the object of the former is essential in grounding my perception of the representation before me, that of the latter isn't: it simply lies at the margins of whatever it is I am occupied with, 'relations and objects but dimly perceived'; James (1890), vol. l,p. 258. 26. There are echoes in Abbate's formulation of earlier interpretations of meaning as deriving from the radical inequality in status between language and the things meant or conveyed by it. So, for instance, Suzanne Langer wrote that 'little noises are ideal conveyors of meaning, for they give us nothing but their meaning. This is the source of "transparency" of language on which several scholars have remarked'; cited in Polanyi (1969), p. 193. 27. See Wollheim (2001), p. 249. 28. See Biancorosso (2001). 29. Hence, I take it, Donnelly's statement (2005, p. 90) that the employment of film music in the horror genre is 'based on fundamental notions of presence/absence, perceived origin and physical volume'. 30. See Gombrich (1990). 3 1 . Perhaps the ability to hear a melody in a sequence of pitch-differentiated sounds is hardwired in our brains, as is our ability to see images in the clouds.

Hamilton (2009, p. 146), too, has put forth an application ofWollheim's idea of twofoldness to musical perception. His stimulating contribution unfortunately reached my desk too late for detailed discussion in this article. I note that Hamilton's primary examples are mostly drawn from 'absolute' - that is, non-representational - music in the classical, high-art tradition. I engage with the implications of divorcing the idea of twofoldness from the experience of representation in a study currently in preparation for the volume Music and Representation , edited by Joshua Walden (Cambridge University Press, forthcoming). 34. It is important to stress, with Kassabian, that '"competence" of this kind requires none of the specialised training in music theory and composition that makes a person not merely competent but musically "literate"'; Kassabian (2000), p. 20. 35. Discussing Kubrick's use of prestigious works of classical music in The Shining (1980), Donnelly (2005, p. 36) has coined the intriguing concept of 'foreground music'. While Donnelly's concept aptly describes the overwhelming power of the music in shaping the viewer's experience of that film, here I am more concerned with the question of just how recognisable a piece of music is, what one recognises in it, and how this results in a continuum of sorts between pre-existing and original music. For a historical and critical survey of the uses of pre-existing music in narrative cinema across a wide spectrum of genres and periods, see also Powrie and Stilwell (2006). 36. Though heard in a widely circulated version of the film, the orchestral version of the tune heard over the credits of the film is spurious. In the original version, the credits are unaccompanied by any music and Grieg's tune is first heard as whistled by Hans Beckert on the occasion of the first murder (Criterion DVD, B00065GX64). This has important consequences for the audience's response to the tune at that junc- ture: even those who recognise the tune as Grieg's, thus placing it in an extra- or inter-textual web of references, cannot anticipate its intra-textual role, namely that it is the murderer's tune, until its next occurrence. 37. Noel Carroll calls this the 'onset' of a four-part 'complex discovery plot', the remaining three parts or 'movements' being 'discovery', 'confirmation', and 'con- frontation'. The description seems tailor-made for Jaws; see Carroll (1998), p. 99. 38. The film remains ambiguous on the status of the mysterious forces that so upset Rosemary. On a psychological reading of the film, the film does not so much chronicle the intrusion of a body external to Rosemary's - the devil - but rather the gradual unravelling of her mind as a result of repressed desires and the guilt associated with them: a monster, as it were, from within herself. 39. See Rosar (2010), pp. 157-8. 40. For an overview of ombra music in opera, see McClelland (2001). 4 1 . However mediated and diluted by countless paraphrases, the influence of operatic music is ensured by the reliance of early film scores on operatic precedents. Note that the bulk of the examples found in Becce and Erdmann (1927) originate in opera, particularly in works from the second half of the nineteenth century. 42. From Frankenstein (1931; dir. James Whale) and King Kong (1933; dir. Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack [uncredited]) and beyond, 'monster' music has featured many recurring elements that may have caught Williams's attention as he © 201 1 The Author.

A complete list of potential candidates would be impossible to draw up in the context of this article, but a few suggestions include Mysterious Island (1961; dir. Cy Endfield, score by Bernard Herrmann), The Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954; dir. Jack Arnold, uncredited music by Henry Mancini, Hans J. Salter and Herman Stein) and The Monster That Challenged the World (1957; dir. Arnold Laven, score by Heinz Roemheld). One commentator, in an unedited Web posting, has also suggested an intriguing parallel to the non-diegetic music in Walt Disney's Bambi ; see Tylski (1999). The influence of television series is not to be discounted, either; nor is that of Godzilla (1954; dir. Ishiro Honda and Terry O. Morse). For the role of Stravinsky's music in Akira Ifukube's score for the latter, see Hosokawa (2004). 43. See Rosar (2010), pp. 156-7. 44. Discussing the allocation of attention in audio-visual experiments, Cohen stresses what she sees as 'the mind's ability in the cinematic context to exploit the semantic, affective dimension of music while ignoring the acoustical aspect not anchored in the image'; Cohen (2000), p. 368. The formulation is especially appealing in that it suggests not 'unconscious' or 'subliminal' perception as much as absence, or poor perception of, certain aspects of the stream of sounds as a result of selective attention. 45. I leave out the rubric 'horror' here since it more accurately describes our response to the segment of the narrative - Chrissie's death - that does not feature the notorious motive. 46. Donnelly also observes how the equivalence between music and sound effect 'means that the appearance of the drone without the appearance of the fog still indicates that the fog is present'; Donnelly (2010), pp. 160-1. The point, mutatis mutandis , applies to Jaws as well. But it remains to me unclear how '[t] his is beyond representation', as imitation and above all the principle of substitution are central to representation as we know it. 47. See Currie (1990); Walton (1990); and Carroll (1998). 48. Personal communication. 49. On the 'disanalogies' that in his opinion define the relationship between character and spectator in the horror film, see Carroll (1998), pp. 88-96. 50. The motive or, as it is popularly known, the 'shark theme', became notorious soon after the film's release. Airplane! (1980; dir. Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker), for instance, features a well-known spoof near the beginning, when the motive comically underscores the breaking of the aircraft's 'fin'. 5 1 . 'Don't poke your nose into my pictures', Rembrandt is reported to have said, 'the smell of paint will poison you'; Gombrich (1961), p. 196. 52. See also n. 43 above. 53. On the difference between a sitter and a model, see Wollheim (1 980), pp. 207-9. On the difference between 'motive' and 'model' in painting, see also Danto (1999), p. 217. 54. The music is in this respect an important factor in what makes Jaws a horror in the manner of a thriller, rather than a mystery. Music Analysis , 29/i-ii-iii (2010) © 201 1 The Author.

The success of the sequence, it is argued, turns on a bold and sophisticated use of preparatory material in the minutes preceding the attack. It is also suggested that, during the attack proper, it is the role of memory and the limits of attention that underpin the viewer-auditor's response to John Williams's famous motive. Drawing on the work of Richard Wollheim on the phenomenology of painting, it is proposed that the spectator 'hears-in' the music, and to buttress this central claim various articulations of the notion of 'hearing-in' are offered in the course of the discussion. The article ends with a rebuttal of the idea that music is heard unconsciously or subliminally. Music Analysis , 29/i-ii-iii (2010) © 201 1 The Author.
