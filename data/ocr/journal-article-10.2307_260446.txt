<plain_text><page sequence="1">John E. Bowlt Through the Gloss Darkly: Images of Decadence in Early Twentieth-Century Russian Art Investigation into the phenomenon of Decadence in Russian art is a complicated and hazardous undertaking. Although the general theme of Decadence, especially of the European fin de siecle, has received much attention over recent years, its role in the evolution of modern Russian art has not been clarified or even recognized.' Western historians tend to disregard the issue and their Soviet col- leagues misconstrue and misinterpret it. One consequence of this desultory attitude is that certain artists who happened to depict 'Decadent' images - such as Mikhail Vrubel - have been relegated carelessly to the category of Decadent, even though they did not align themselves with the movement; other artists such as Konstantin Somov have been misrepresented so that Somov, who was fascinated by prurience and necromancy, is now praised for his 'flexibility of feeling, mobility and dynamism of experience...a professional in the highest sense of the word'.2 In spite of commen- dable efforts to rehabilitate the Russian Silver Age (art, literature and music of the period just before and after the 1917 Revolution), Soviet historians in particular still ignore the 'undesirable' aspects of artists such as Lev Bakst, Alexandre Bemois, Boris Kustodiev, Somov, Sergei Sudeikin, etc., an anaesthetizing procedure that has led to a virtual repackaging of the Russian fin de siecle for Soviet consumption. Although the word Decadent was first used in the Russian press in 18893 and, thereafter, was often applied to certain tendencies in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Europe, it was also used later, in the Soviet period, Journal of Contemporary History (SAGE, London and Beverly Hills), Vol. 17 (1982), 93-110</page><page sequence="2">Journal of Contemporary History to describe virtually any art movement that digressed from the prin- ciples of Socialist Realism. This particular Soviet application of the term Decadent warrants separate examination, and its relation to the concurrent use of 'entartete' in Hitler's Germany would make an intriguing topic of research. But even if we confine our enquiry here to the Russian fin de siecle, we find that the concept of Decadence (in Russian dekadentstvo or upadochnichestvo) was used also in diverse ways: the apologists of Realism such as the painter Ilia Repin and the critic Vladimir Stasov called the Sym- bolists Decadent, and the Symbolists called the Realists Decadent; the Symbolists themselves tried to divide their own generation into 'real' Symbolists and 'pseudo-' Symbolists (i.e. Decadents); moreover, few, if any, of the artists who dealt with 'Decadent' themes called themselves Decadent. This confusion derives partly from the fact that the Russian Silver Age was an extremely varied, contradictory and elaborate phenomenon. All the more reason, therefore, for considering the question of Decadence not simply from our own, contemporary standpoint, but also from the stand- point of those who, consciously, applied the word to themselves and their colleagues. Numerous examples of Decadent art (in the conventional understanding of that term) can be found in the art of the Russian Silver Age. Necrological and erotic motifs, images of violence and ecstasy, hysteria and frenzy, themes of decline - from fallen women to fallen stars - can be found in the work of primary and secondary artists such as Boris Anisfeld, Isaak Brodsky, Bakst, Nikolai Feofilaktov, Nikolai Kalmakov, Vasilii Masiutin, Dmitrii Mitrokhin, Somov, Sudeikin, etc. In Russia the very epoch of Sym- bolism and Decadence (ca. 1890-ca. 1920) witnessed a final, brilliant irridescence in her literature, art and music. It was a time of luxurious artistic growth, of hot-house flowers 'elegant and often deceptive, bearing the suspicious smell of a cadaver'.4 Much of this art, while splendid in form, munificent in colour and line, seemed to lack a central purpose and, no longer obedient to a par- ticular esthetic or ethical system, spun out of control on a long, spectacular descent from the rarified ether of Symbolism to the mundane concerns of social and political reality. The story of this downward flight is the story of Decadence. Even artists of the Silver Age, identified normally by propriety and restraint, such as Benois and Mstislav Dobujinsky, experienced darker moments, and depicted scenes or allegories of excessive sin. 94</page><page sequence="3">Bowlt: Decadence in Russian Art A number of artists who later became pillars of respectability such as the Socialist Realist Isaak Brodsky, one of Stalin's 'Court Painters' in the 1930s, started their careers with imaginations filled with devils, monsters, femmesfatales; and Nicolai Fechin (Nikolai Feshin), in emigration a famous interpreter of the Wild West, also favoured more grotesque subjects in the early 1900s.5 That Russian society was fascinated more than usual by the more morbid ex- periences of life just before 1917 is indicated by the fact that during the period 1907-17 - the 'most disgraceful and shameful decade in the history of the Russian intelligentsia', as Maxim Gorky said later6 - an unprecedented number of books and articles appeared on physical, psychological and artistic deviance and abnormality, from the 1912 translation of Auguste Forel's La question sexuelle to E. P. Radin's Futurizm i bezumie [Futurism and Madness].7 The list could be supplemented by the many books on fin de siecle ar- tists such as Aubrey Beardsley and Felicien Rops,8 and by the many risque collections of verse and vignettes such as Le Livre de la mar- quise (first edition 1908) with Somov's illustrations, and Alexei Remizov's Tsar Dodon (1921) with Bakst's illustrations.9 It is rele- vant to add here that Nikolai Riabushinsky, playboy and financier of the Symbolist review Zolotoe runo [The Golden Fleece], even organized a competition for the 'best' depiction of the Devil in 1907, although, in spite of contributions by Anatolii Arapov, Feofilaktov, Dobujinsky, Nikolai Krymov, Pavel Kuznetsov and Vasilii Milioti, he did not find any of the entries worthy of the prize. Reference could be made to many such outward manifestations of what is often identified as Decadent art, but, of course, they are only the symptoms or gestures of a deeper, more essential impulse of Decadence. In order to place such images of sex and violence in their meaningful context, we should attempt to understand the 'idea' of Decadence, at least as it was interpreted by its practi- tioners in Russian culture in the early 1900s. Unlike their French and Belgian colleagues of the later nineteenth century, Russian writers and artists did not constitute a distinct, cohesive school of Decadents. Antagonists to Symbolism and the public at large used the word indiscriminately to describe any poet or painter that revolted against Realist and Academic art, whether Sergei Diaghilev or the patron Princess Tenisheva,10 the poets Konstantin Balmont or Baudelaire, Somov or Thomas Theodor Heine, Vrubel or Moreau. However, generally speaking, Russian artists then saw 95</page><page sequence="4">Journal of Contemporary History themselves as part of a cultural Renaissance, not decline, in Russia, since, as the critic and poet Sergei Makovsky, editor of the review Apollon [Apollo], wrote in 1910: Over the last ten years Russian art has done the work of a whole century. As for artistic culture in particular, I am profoundly convinced that Russia has never experienced a more fertile epoch. What many call derisively 'modernism' is a symptom of the real growth of our esthetic self-awareness. 1 Consequently, the Russian Symbolists, 'on the crest of a wave',12 looked down from their Olympian heights on to the art movements that had preceded them, and, with some justification, declared them - not themselves - to be Decadent, inasmuch as movements such as Russian Realism had often bastardized canons of taste that had been established many years before. Diaghilev made this quite clear in his persuasive lead article for his magazine Mir iskusstva [The World of Art] in 1898, an article that he called 'Complicated Questions. Our Imaginary Decline'. Diaghilev argued that the Rus- sian nineteenth century had attained no Parnassian heights and that it had managed to produce merely three kinds of degenerate artist: (1) the Decadents of Classicism, our most decrepit and hence incorrigible enemies; (2) sickly sentimentalists, fainting away to the sounds of Mendelssohn Lieder.. They are the Decadents of Romanticism, terrible enemies; (3) a very recent group [the Realists, J.B.] which imagined it had amazed the world with its audacious discovery - dragging peasant shoes and rags on to the canvas - whereas this had already been done incomparably better and with much more vigour fifty years before by the great Balzac and Millet... They are the Decadents of Realism.13 Actually, Diaghilev was emphasizing what some Russian writers and artists had been declaring throughout the 1890s. For example, in 1892, the poet and philosopher Dmitrii Merezhkovsky, later a contributor to Mir iskusstva, published his manifesto 'On the Reasons for the Decline and on the New Trends in Contemporary Russian Literature' in which he asserted that Our time should be defined by two opposing features - it is a time of the most extreme materialism and at the same time of the most passionate idealist im- pulses of the spirit. We are witnessing the grand and meaningful encounter of these two views of life.14 96</page><page sequence="5">Bowlt: Decadence in Russian Art Similarly, in an article of 1897 entitled 'Decline or Renaissance', the artist and critic Igor Grabar also censured the epigones of academic or 'materialist' art and praised the new generation of stylists.15 It is tempting to accept these sentiments as the basis of a common policy identifiable with the Russian Symbolists or, specifically, with the World of Art group. But, there again, the opinions and attitudes of these writers and artists were so heterogeneous, so mercurial, that a point of view delineated one day might be contradicted or disproved in a statement issued the next. For example, only six years after Diaghilev wrote his 'Com- plicated Questions' with its rejection of derivative art and its sup- port of individuality at all costs, Benois published an essay entitled 'Artistic Heresies' which advocated almost the reverse: Does not individualism - the cornerstone of contemporary artistic life - teach us that only that has value which has arisen freely in the artist's soul and has poured forth into his creation freely?... Artists have scattered into their own corners, they amuse themselves with self-admiration, they beware of mutual in- fluences and at all costs try to be only themselves. Chaos reigns, something tur- bid which has scarcely any value and which, strangest of all, has no physiognomy.16 In his 'Complicated Questions' Diaghilev was, as usual, brusque and autocratic. Actually, some of the Realists such as Repin and Vasilii Surikov made a vital contribution to the development of Russian painting, although their epigones such as Konstantin and Vladimir Makovsky, Timofei Nef and Genrikh Semiradsky did, in- deed, represent a decline. No doubt, Diaghilev had in mind the sen- timental scenes of Vladimir Makovsky such as Declaration of Love (1889-1891) or the luscious nudes of Nef and Semiradsky such as Young Girls in a Grotto (by Nef) when he referred to the Decadents of Romanticism and the Decadents of Classicism. This distinction between the original and the imitation, depth and surface, inner purpose and mere ornament, implicit in Diaghilev's argumenta- tion, helps us in turn to clarify the meaning of the term Decadence as it was applied by intellectuals ca. 1900. For all parties concerned, Decadence was an art devoid of idea, an art that was left to its own devices, an expenditure of technical energy without an accepted philosophical intent. In other words, the concept of Decadence was (and is) not necessarily connected with artistic ability or inability or with a particular stage in cultural development, and, as Salvador Dali once said of Surrealism, 'it has existed at all times and in all 97</page><page sequence="6">Journal of Contemporary History countries'. 1 Furthermore, Decadence does not, essentially, have to do with an abundance of necrological, demonic and erotic motifs, although the concentrated use of such motifs often constitutes a protest against the taboos of a given society and, from the view- point of that society, is, therefore, a deviation and decline from moral and cultural standards, a denial of conventional philosophy. Finally, the fact that we tend to identify Decadence with the Euro- pean fin de siecle does not give that epoch the exclusive right of possession. To the Russian consciousness of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the question of the philosophical content of art was of paramount importance. Remembering the grand idealism of the nineteenth century, the Russian Symbolists cultivated - even as Nikolai Gogol, Alexandr Ivanov and Lev Tolstoi had done- the 'internal' meaning of art. For many of the Russian Symbolist writers, e.g. Andrei Bely, Alexandr Blok and Viacheslav Ivanov, and for many of their artist colleagues, e.g. Benois, Viktor Borisov- Musatov, Kuznetsov and Vrubel, art was supposed to embody an ideological message: 'Unity is the Symbol... the Word is the Flesh', wrote Bely in 1909.18 Of course, there were some Russian Symbolists who did not share completely the notion that the arti- fact must possess an arriere pensee, and, in response to Ivanov's 'Symbolism would not have wanted to be and could not have been "only art","9 issued sharp counter-claims. In this respect, the poet Valerii Briusov liked to think of himself as a Decadent, even though he certainly had ideas to express. Briusov emphasized for- mal structure, and even in his most energetic, erotic poems, remain- ed impassionate, but his intellect was too assimilative, too incisive to remove art totally from philosophy. Even so, Briusov's art is more contrived and, in this sense, more Decadent than that of Bely, Blok and Ivanov, and it is not fortuitous that Briusov's review Vesy [The Scales] attracted a number of young graphic designers, especially Feofilaktov, who also adopted a Decadent pose. Bely recalled, incidentally, that Briusov was the only poet in Moscow ca. 1900 to be genuinely interested in magic, the occult and hypnosis.20 An extension of the above formula for Decadence, i.e. form without content, is to be found in the conception of style and stylization, symbol and symbolization formulated by Bely in 1909. Bely argued that the authentic symbol denoted the outermost fron- 98</page><page sequence="7">Bowlt: Decadence in Russian Art tier of cognition and that anything beyond that was meaningless: Symbolization is a false denotation of things that exist in terms to , hich nothing corresponds ...The symbol is the limit to all cognitive, creative and ethical norms. In this sense, the symbol is the limit of limits.21 For the Symbolists, style, like the symbol, was the natural expres- sion of the inner content of the work of art - what Vasilii Kandin- sky called the 'inner sound'.22 When, however, an artist borrowed only the formal manifestation and applied it to a work for its own sake, this became stylization. Consequently, Bely and his col- leagues contended that a stylized work of art was secondary; Kandinsky called it 'decorative';23 we might call it Decadent. As an example of literary stylization, Bely adduced the plays of Maurice Maeterlinck which, he maintained, relied on all the Symbolist devices, but, actually, were devoid of idea. As Bely concluded, Maeterlinck and other Decadents practised mere estheticism which 'as a form of liberation from the will... was the consequence of the philosophy of a dying century'. Put more bluntly, Maeterlinck, for Bely, embodied an 'ideology of sleep'.24 If we approach the Russian visual arts of the 1890s and 1900s from this viewpoint, what examples of Decadence (stylization) do we find? Indeed, if we sympathize with Bely's argument, why should we even trouble to discuss 'secondary' art? Or is there, paradoxically, 'good' and 'bad' Decadent art? Examination of the work of several Russian artists who clearly depended on stylization for their effect in order to communicate their own visions might help to resolve these dilemmas. Somov, Kalmakov, Feofilaktov, Anisfeld, Brodsky and Fechin are among such artists. Konstantin Somov is perhaps the most intriguing of the Russian Decadent artists.25 On many occasions Somov declared that he sup- ported no philosophical system and that his art was linked to no idea apart from the expression of his own individual impulses: 'I am an individualist, the whole world revolves round me, and, essentially, it is no concern of mine to go outside the confines of this "I".'26 Consciously and skilfully, Somov took images from other artists, particularly from Beardsley and Heine, transferring a Beardsley composition such as one of the illustrations for The Rape of the Lock to the cover for a Moscow fashion magazine called Parizhanka [The Parisienne] in 1908. In this respect, Somov, as an epigone of English Art Nouveau, might be called a Decadent. At 99</page><page sequence="8">Journal of Contemporary History the same time, for the custodians of Realism, Somov was a Deca- dent because he used images which could not be accommodated within their vocabulary - as Repin, at one time Somov's pro- fessor, affirmed when he referred to the 'deliberate idiocy and deceit in affecting such a childish absurdity in colours' in the con- text of Somov's first Decadent paintings.27 Somov's father once mentioned that Konstantin, as a child, 'loved to play alone... and very often used to play with dolls, like a little girl'.28 In 1916 Kuzmin referred to the 'doll-like theatricality of Somov's world, the comedy of eroticism, the colourful diversity of his masked monsters'.29 These words allude to a very important aspect of Somov's work and of the World of Art output as a whole - the element of grotesquerie. Of course, on one level the numerous Harlequinades, the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century lovers in masks, the gay rainbows and fireworks relate to the Sym- bolists' cult of retrospectivism, to their passion for the theatre and to their interest in Beardsley, Heine and Julius Dietz. But on another level, Somov's grotesquerie expressed his real attitude to his contemporary society. In the Columbines and Harlequins at play, in the 'cripples and lilliputs'30 making love beneath arabes- ques, in the flowers and butterflies of elegant bosquets, we see a magnificent dance of death. Critics referred to the cold moons and suns that 'beget putrefaction'31 in Somov's love scenes, but for Somov love is a mere diversion, a foil against death: 'Hinter jeden bliihenden beeligten Madchen steht unsichtbar der Tod'.32 Somov's caricature of love between man and woman derived in part from his own homosexuality and from his ambiguous attitude towards women, but, in any case, Somov admitted that he had no 'love for, or interest in, people'.33 Somov derided woman in many of his paintings - from the doll-like maiden in Echo of Time Passed to Lady in Pink (1903), from the Lady Asleep in a Blue Dress (1903) to Mouth of a Certain Young Lady (1909). Although Somov did not paint men in so devastating a manner, he still parodied them: the cavaliers of his period pieces such as The Ridiculed Kiss (1908) and its winter version The Skating Rink (1915) are as hideous as the women they seek to amuse. That is why it is misleading to interpret Somov's fetes galantes as 'nostalgia for the wretched, but enchan- ting past'.34 Humanity in the age of Versailles appealed to Somov no more than humanity in the twentieth century. Somov once said 'the essence of everything is eroticism'.35 This banal sentiment had been expressed, no doubt, many times before 100</page><page sequence="9">Bowlt: Decadence in Russian Art by Beardsley, Mikhail Zichy, Rops, Franz Stuck, etc. However, even for Rops the fascination with sex seems to have been rather more than a wish to gratify a yearning for sensual pleasure, and to have related to an aspiration to learn of the Idea of Eros. In his monograph on Rops in 1910, the playwright and critic Nikolai Evreinov indicated this when he wrote of the work of the 1860s that 'Woman now attracts him by other charms. He wishes to divine her. He torments himself over the idea of Woman.'36 For Somov, Kalmakov and Feofilaktov, sex was no more than a sybaritic pastime that did not connect with a higher dimension; for them the sexual act was a source of carnal pleasure that was not supposed to raise consciousness beyond physical life (whereas for many Sym- bolists, including Zinaida Gippius, Ivanov, Merezhkovsky, even for Bakst, sex was regarded as a source of liberation). In other words, here was a surface motif that could be used to titillate and to alleviate emotional frustration in comparison to the erotica of Beardsley and Rops. In this respect, Somov's artistic relationship to Beardsley and Rops is rather like Erte's to Bakst. If Somov diluted the intensity of his sexual imagery with all man- ner of literary and musical connotations and contexts, and if he disguised his erotic symbols in the sumptuous elegance of an aristocratic society at play, his disciples Kalmakov and Feofilaktov made no attempt to conceal their voluptuous moods. Kalmakov, for example, signed his paintings of Ledas, Salomes and odalisques with initials in the form of a stylized phallus, and his set design for the Temple of the Goddess of Love for Act I of Salome in St. Petersburg in 1908 was the explicit depiction of the female sexual organ - a creation which, even for the St. Petersburg demi-monde was too extreme, necessitating the cancellation of the production after its dress rehearsal. Kalmakov was only one of a number of St. Petersburg artists who indulged in erotic and necrological excess, and who made their debut at exhibitions just as Symbolism as a positive worldview had passed its zenith.37 By the mid-1900s artists and writers were begin- ning to doubt the validity of Symbolism as a transcendental idea and, accordingly, their work came to reflect disenchantment and weariness. Blok's poem The Stranger (Neznakomka) of 1906 typifies this development, as does Kuznetsov's painting of late 1907 called Night of the Consumptives (a paraphrase of Bocklin's Isle of the Dead).38 Until this moment, both Blok and Kuznetsov had believed in the force of the symbol, but, in their deepening 101</page><page sequence="10">Journal of Contemporary History disbelief, they turned to symbolization - to stylization. In turn, ar- tists of lesser calibre took advantage of this development and soon constituted a 'Neo-Symbolist' group in Moscow and St. Petersburg. For example, in November 1907 two exhibitions open- ed in St. Petersburg - the 'Fall Exhibition' and 'Auer's Commer- cial Exhibition' - at which Kalmakov and his colleagues presented highly erotic, demonic and necrological pictures. The canvasses of Kalmakov, Avgust Ballier, Andrei Dmitriev et al., with dedications to, or epigraphs from, Bely, Briusov and Ivanov, incorporated all the favourite Symbolist motifs. For instance, a sketch by Dmitriev bore a quotation from Briusov as its caption ('Uncherished dreams fade in my heart, flowers of a ridiculed spring perish')39 and depicted a corpse, a young girl and an old woman. Ballier was represented by the Wreath, a picture of a skull in water. Other paintings contained similar motifs - a skeleton in a field with a cannon on its back, corpses, a sphinx, a pink river, a cemetery, doves, etc. Benois, who reviewed the 'Fall Exhibition', described these 'symbolizations' as follows: Hitherto, we in St. Petersburg, have not had any 'formal' Symbolists. Well, now they have appeared. In more progressive Moscow, they have existed already for several years. And, of course, I'm not talking about Vrubel...The 'formal' Symbolist creates profound and enigmatic things on purpose and becomes a real specialist. This specialty arose in France and Germany in the 1880s. .Now we have 'formal' Symbolists in Russia, both in Moscow and in St. Petersburg... Dmitriev's and Kalmakov's intentions are, in most cases, very suc- cessful . . Kalmakov is more literary, more philosophical, more distinct. His pic- tures 'narrate themselves' without particular difficulty . . Dmitriev has more of a purely visual talent. It is hardly possible to find the key to his sadly mysterious masks, to his crazily grimacing compositions.40 Much indebted to Somov and sympathetic to Kalmakov was Feofilaktov, the 'Moscow Beardsley'.41 This epithet alone indicates the nature of Feofilaktov's work, a curious pastiche of Beardsley, Rops, Stuck and Somov. Feofilaktov contributed many graphic decorations to Vesy, Zolotoe runo and the Symbolist almanac Severnye tsvety [Northern Flowers], although he felt his real voca- tion to be oil painting, arguing that he was forced to be a graphic artist from financial necessity. Feofilaktov loved to depict buxom ladies in various states of undress, enhancing their forms with feathers, stockings, wide-brimmed hats and palm-trees, and exag- gerating their 'imperious, naked thighs'.42 Feofilaktov's flowers of 102</page><page sequence="11">Bowlt: Decadence in Russian Art the night were collected into an album entitled 66 risunkov [66 Drawings] and published in Moscow in 1909. These are episodes from the diary of a sensuous observer who lacked the technical pro- wess of either Rops or Somov, but who relied upon them for in- spiration. For example, his lugubrious picture called Autumn (1910)43 is a direct paraphrase of Somov's famous Sorcery (1902). Obviously, Feofilaktov's 66 risunkov was meant to shock the public just as Briusov's poem Oh, close your pale legs had done fif- teen years before. Not surprisingly, Briusov admired Feofilaktov's work, and he decorated the walls of his Moscow apartment with the artist's pornographic drawings. Indicative of their lasting friend- ship was the fact that the 1933 Soviet edition of Briusov's poetry carried a cover and illustrations by Feofilaktov. Bely also liked Feofilaktov, and often encountered him in the editorial offices of Vesy, as he recalled: Feofilaktov used to loll about on a blue divan either picking his teeth with a toothpick or dropping his profile into his palms; he had a profile like Beardsley's; don't pay attention to his 'peculiarities' - a really good, straightforward fellow.44 Somov, Kalmakov and Feofilaktov were among many Russian artists who used motifs of sexual abundance and perversion for their own enjoyment or for the entertainment of Edwardian Moscow and St. Petersburg. Moreover, their heightened interest in sex was countered by an artistic cult of violence, manifest especially in the mid-1900s. This cult was expressed most clearly in an unex- pected context, namely in the radical caricature journals of 1905-06, journals which are regarded normally by Western and Soviet historians as organs of the revolutionary cause, socially con- scious and humanitarian. Still, a closer investigation into the iconography of these journals indicates that the numerous images of death and sickness, the freaks and monsters, the serpents and nocturnal spirits may have been dictated not necessarily by a given artist's social conscience, but rather by his psychological fascina- tion with Decadent motifs. In other words, it is reasonable to assume that a number of prominent Russian artists - Brodsky, Sergei Chekhonin, Dobujinsky, Fechin, Anisfeld, Boris Kustodiev, Evgenii Lanceray et al. - used the caricature journals simply as vehicles for the depiction of subjects that, in another context, would have been socially taboo.45 103</page><page sequence="12">Journal of Contemporary History However, this is not to say that Russian artists were politically unaware in 1905-06 or that they were indifferent to social reform. Many intellectuals were highly discontented in 1905, especially after the ignominious failure of the Czarist government in the Russo-Japanese War, but their mood was by no means a uniform one. Maxim Gorky saw the insurrections of 1905-06 as an oppor- tunity to destroy the 'stupid gluttons and syphilitics from the House of the Romanovs who have ruined and shamed Russia';46 Diaghilev saw the events as a 'wild bacchanalia' and he wished he could 'get the hell out of here';47 Dobujinsky, in the manifesto en- titled 'The Voice of Artists', co-signed by Benois, Lanceray and Somov, welcomed social change, but feared that 'beauty will be abolished and forgotten in the mighty wave of urgent, practical needs'.48 Some of those artists who wished for reform and who sud- denly moved from their complacent stance of the early 1900s to a more aggressive one in 1905 did, indeed, begin to use caricature and cartoon to express their contempt for the status quo. Works such as Dobujinsky's Pacification (depicting the Kremlin almost immersed in a sea of blood) and his October Idyll or Kustodiev's Entry. Moscow (in which a giant skeleton rushes from behind the workers' barricades towards the Czar's troops), all of which appeared in the journal Zhupel [Bugbear], are clear examples of this new orienta- tion. The journal Adskaia pochta [Hellish Post], named after the satirical journal published under, and eventually closed by, Catherine the Great, maintained the same high artistic standard as Zhupel, partly because its editor was the artist Lanceray. One of the most effective pieces that appeared in Adskaia pochta was Lanceray's Funeral Feast: this not only had symbolic meaning from its title and from its bestial distortion of Czarist officers,49 but it also echoed an actual episode when officers of the Semenov Regi- ment went on a drinking-binge after their massacre of workers. But although transmitting its message forcefully, this caricature, like those of Anisfeld, Brodsky, Fechin and sometimes Chekhonin, Dobujinsky and Kustodiev, uses an unwarranted measure of horror and distortion. It would seem that in such caricatures another stimulus, outside the political and social one, was operative, i.e. a concern with the macabre and the bizarre for their own sake. No doubt, therefore, the monsters of Anisfeld, the corpses and skeletons of Brodsky, the coffins of Fechin, the blood of Dobujin- sky, etc. derived not only from a sense of civic indignation, but also 104</page><page sequence="13">Bowlt: Decadence in Russian Art from a more expressionistic, psychological urge, as was the case, for example, with Alfred Kubin's and Franz Kupka's contributions to L'Assiette au Beurre or with the many macabre and erotic il- lustrations for Simplicissimus. The Revolution of 1905-06 provided a clear condition in which the forces of good (liberation) and evil (reaction) could be distinguished and identified immediately with the attributes of the insurgents on the one hand, and the Czarist order on the other. Consequently, the images of monsters, snakes, chains, bloodbaths, corpses, cemeteries, etc. could now be used 'legitimately' and could be justified, if necessary, not simply by an artist's love of 'Deca- dent' motifs, but rather by his alleged condemnation of the status quo (even though the reverse might be true). It is paradoxical that this Decadent style, now being used ostensibly in the service of social emancipation, had been - and would continue to be - con- demned as a style that deflected attention from the cause of freedom.50 In any case, the most forceful cartoons in the revolu- tionary journals are those that rely upon negative images, and not those that depict the forces of good (red banners, demonstrations or smiling faces of workers). Furthermore, the artists who favour the images of violence and death - Anisfeld, Brodsky, Fechin, Dobujinsky - concentrate almost exclusively on them and give no attention to their positive counterparts - another reason for presuming that such artists took a prurient pleasure in using them. The 'legitimization' of Decadent imagery in the revolutionary journals of 1905-06 provided an important precedent for Russian artists later on. Of course, the artistic treatment of monsters, devils, freaks, death and decay was not new to Russian art, and particular mention should be made of the grotesque and super- natural elements in the paintings and book illustrations of Elena Polenova and Mariia Yakunchikova of the 1890s,5' but the most horrifying renditions of sex and violence were executed between ca. 1908 and ca. 1920 - especially by the engraver Vasilii Masiutin. His album of nineteen sheets called Grekh [Sin] of 1909 includes perverse visions such as Woman-Mask, Woman on a Beast, Woman with Tails, Life and Sickness. While inspired in part by Altdorfer, Daumier, Goya and Rops, Masiutin preserved his own faultless technique and idiosyncratic imagination, and his monstrous visions such as Life (1909) and Death (1911) have never been equalled in the history of Russian art.52 Many other graphic artists began to give free reign to their morbid fantasies in the late 105</page><page sequence="14">Journal of Contemporary History 1900s. Alfred Eberling produced haunting illustrations to a de luxe edition of Lermontov's poem Demon in 1910; Sergei Rafailovich's cycle of poems called Speculum Animae of 1911 contained grotes- que illustrations by Anisfeld, Chekhonin, Dobujinsky, Sudeikin and Alexandr Yakovlev. Mstislav Farmakovsky and Mikhail Kurilko produced sophisticated combinations of serpents and tigers, and Chekhonin drew anthropomorphic flowers that threatened to encroach upon the world of man, while his swords and roses in blanc et noir allegorized parts of a different kind. This type of Decadent art continued to manifest itself throughout the Revolutionary period - even when the very con- cept of figurative art was regarded as Decadent by the adherents of Constructivism and industrial design. Some artists, particularly Somov and Kalmakov, pursued their erotic and demonic visions in emigration, but they themselves withdrew into their internal worlds, merely reiterating subjects that they had painted many years before. In the Soviet Union, Somov, Kalmakov, Feofilaktov and their colleagues were criticized, and, when Socialist Realism became the exclusive doctrine that determined the further evolution of Soviet art, they were rejected out of hand for their 'bourgeois hedonism, Decadent Romanticism of the old nobility and refined estheticism united by a common cult of individualism taken to ex- tremes'.53 But, paradoxically, as we look back to that time, we realize that the Stalin style was also a regression, for it was a styliza- tion of Realism. The smiling faces and golden corn of Socialist Realism were not less the product of symbolization and stylization than were the rainbows of Somov or the femmes fatales of Feofilaktov. In this sense, Socialist Realism was itself a Decadent art form - and just as the Decadents of the fin de siecle scattered 'flowers, flowers above the black void',54 so Stalin's artists deflected attention from the horror of their own epoch. Perhaps the day is not far off when these artists who condemned the Rus- sian Silver Age for its Decadence will themselves be dismissed for that very same quality. 106</page><page sequence="15">Bowlt: Decadence in Russian Art Notes 1. No serious discussion of Decadence in Russian art has been published un- til the present, although books dealing with Russian Symbolism do, of course, refer to it. For general information on the position of Russian art vis-a-vis Sym- bolism and the cultural context of the 1890s and the 1900s, see Janet Kennedy, 'The Mir Iskusstva' Group and Russian Art 1898-1912 (New York 1977); John E. Bowlt, The Silver Age: Russian Art of the Early Twentieth Century and the 'World of Art' Group (Newtonville 1979); N. Lapshina, 'Mir iskusstva' (Moscow 1977); Carl Proffer and Ellendea Proffer, The Silver Age of Russian Culture (Ann Arbor 1975). Important illustrative material is provided by A. Sidorov in his book Russkaia grafika nachala XX veka (Moscow 1969). The re- cent article on the graphic illustrations and decorations for the Symbolist review Vesy is also directly relevant to the topic under discussion. See M. Kiselev, 'Grafika zhurnala "Vesy"' in D. Bisti et al. (eds.), Sovetskaia grafika '78 (Moscow 1980), 200-224. In spite of its promising title the book Eroticism in Russian Art by A. Flegon (London 1976) holds little of interest. 2. A. Gusarova, Konstantin Andreevich Somov (Moscow 1973), 8, 13. 3. V.

Princess Tenisheva was a patroness of the arts and provided a subsidy for Mir iskusstva. Thanks to this and to her collaboration with Diaghilev and his col- leagues she was labelled the 'mother of Decadence' in the Russian press. See M.

There is a striking resemblance between Lanceray's picture Funeral Feast and the drawing called Chorus by Bruno Paul which appeared in Simplicissimus in 1898 (reproduced in Richard Christ, Simplicissimus [Berlin 1978], 38). That there was a close interchange of ideas between the World of Art artists and the Simplicissimus group is demonstrated by many such parallels. T. T. Heine, for example, borrowed the composition October Idyll (1905) by Dobujinsky and repeated it in Simplicissimus for 1910 (reproduced in Christ, op. cit., 222). 50. For example, in 1908, the artist A. Vasnetsov wrote that the 'art of the modernists as well as the Decadent, depraved, Sodom-like literature, has been in- vented on purpose it would seem to deflect the eye from the struggle for liberation' (A. Vasnetsov, op. cit., 122). 51. For some information, including relevant illustrations, pertaining to E. Polenova see E. Sakharova, Elena Dmitrievna Polenova (Moscow 1952); on Yakun- chikova see M.
